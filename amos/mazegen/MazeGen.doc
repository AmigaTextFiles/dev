Maze Gen V1.0

Maze Gen allows you to create random mazes and save them in
various formats.  You can save them in 2 color IFF file, or
if you are an AMOS programmer, as a TAME map.
You can save them as 2 state or 16 state maps.  A two state
map has only walk ways and one type of wall.  (thus 2 state)
A 16 state map has walk ways and 15 types of walls.  The
15 types of walls are used to create a more interesting
playfield.  The maze that the intro screens come up on is
a 16 state map.

To use the program, click on its icon.  Wait a bit then
click your way through the many screens until you get to the
program itself.

Once in the program, click on Define.  Drag the mouse to
tell the program how big of a maze you want.
Now, if you want you can click on Blocks to place open
areas onto the maze area.  Drag the left mousebutton to
draw open areas, the right to erase them.
Press the ESC key to exit this option.
Now simply click on MazeGen and click on the point where
you wish the maze to begin drawing.  It doesn't really
matter since the maze is one path only.  Whereever you
decide to put and entrace and exit, there will be only
one path through the maze.

At any point you may exit an option (especially if you think
the mouse is stuck) by pressing ESC.  You can continue a
previously stopped maze by clicking on MazeGen and clicking
where on the map to start drawing again.  If you restart
on an open area, the new maze drawing will never intersect
with the old.  If you restart by clicking on an existing
pathway, they will connect at that point.  There will still
only be one path through the maze!

Now we can save the map if we so desire.

To quit, click on the EXIT button with BOTH mousebuttons.
This is to prevent accidental exit.
