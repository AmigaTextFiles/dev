@NODE Introduction "What are the AMOSPro GadTools?"

What are the AMOSPro GadTools?
------------------------------

The AMOSPro GadTools are an Include-File for AMOS Professional V2.00.
That is: You must link it with the 'Include'-Instruction of AMOSPro on your
Mainprogram. (Please read in addition to it also @{"Important !!!" LINK Important})
Then have you 34 Instructions for any GadGets. I have programing the GadTools
so that you have not only any Buttons, but also an complete Packet to create
very easy Screens & Masks that showing in the OS3.x Look. You can so very

How to use the GadTools?
------------------------

With it you can using the GadTools, you must including the GadTools
on your Mainprogramm. In addition to it can you use the 'Include'-
Instruction of AMOSPro V2.00. Go to the last Line of your Program
an type now:

Include "Device+Path/GadTools.Inc"

For Device+Path must you now insert the correct Path, whit it AMOSPro
can it found.

(Please read in addition to it also @{"Important" LINK Important})

@ENDNODE


@NODE Examples "Example-Listings."

Example-Listings.
-----------------

In the Path ':Beispiele/' can you found any Examples to all possibly
Buttons of the GadTools. In this Path can you found the Example-Listings
to all ScreenModis. (Lores/Hires/Interlace) All examples are in ASCII and
can you loaded directly with 'Merge ASC' into AMOSPro-Editor or even showing
with any TextReaders. Possibly must you change the last Line (Include)
with it the Listings can also found and loaded the GadTools.Inc. I have
creating the Listings so, with it you can very easy understand it.

@ENDNODE


@NODE Guidelines "Guidelines"

Programmer-Guidelines, Look out this.
-------------------------------------

With it you get now problems, look out to any Instructions that you use.
If you will set more Instructions in one Line, please look out that you
type always an (Space " ") before you insert an ":" or the next Instruction.

For Example:
------------

_PushButton_Hit : If Param=1 Then Goto Label ...
               ^ ^
               | |

               2 x Space (" ")

This is the correct Editing. Normally will it AMOS insert, only not when
it is an Instruction of a Procedure. Then will AMOS Interpret it as an
AMOS 'Label'.

(Please read in addition to it also @{"Reduction" LINK Reduction})

@ENDNODE


@NODE Reduction "Reserved Local Variables & Banks."

Reserved Local Variables & Banks.
---------------------------------

The GadTools is an Include-File (Procedures) and not an directly AMOS-
Extension. Therefore exists in it also Variables & Banks. Please look out
that you not use the same it in your Mainprogramm. Therefore here now
an List of all Variables & Banks that the GadTools will using.:

Variables : A-I, X-Z, A$, B$, C$
AMOS-Banks: 501-531,601-631,701-731,801-831,901-931,1001-1031,1101-1131

I have not using Global Variables. Therefore can you use the same it in
your Mainprogramm, when you using it as Local Variables. The AMOS-Banks
holding all Datas to the Buttons. For Example; Bank 501 = PushButton 1,
Bank 502 = PushButton 2 and so. All these Banks allowed not using in your
Mainprogram. Otherwise get you problems. ;-)

@NODE Important "AMOSPro-Monitor & Compiler!"

Important!
----------

Some Users have problems with the Monitor (F4) & Compiler if using the
GadTools. It is NOT a Bug of the AMOSPro-GadTools, but any Bugs of the
AMOSPro-Monitor & Compiler.

That is:

1) No Compiling possibly, if the GadTools will Including with the 'Include'
   Instruction.

2) The AMOSPro-Monitor (F4) shows no Lines, if you debugging your Program.

To 1) must I say, that the AMOSPro-Compiler will accept no Include-
      Instructions. (Any real AMOS-Bug)

Remedy
------

Before Compile your Program, remove the 'Include-Instruction' from your
Program and insert the File 'GadTools.inc' directly in your Mainprogram.
(Option 'Merge' into AMOSPro-Menu) Now will the Compiler accept your
Program.

To 2) must I say, that the AMOSPro-Monitor (F4) cannot showing Lines,
      if an AMOS-Program will loaded with 'Include' on the Mainprogram.
      It is so not in AMOSPro-Editor.

Remedy
------

How 1). Remove the 'Include-Instruction' from your Mainprogram and insert
the File 'GadTools.inc' directly in it. (Option 'Merge' into AMOSPro-Menu)
Now will the AMOSPro-Monitor again showing Lines, if you Debugging your
Program.

Please look out that you all 'Include' mentions in this Guide only using
with the AMOSPro-Interpreter. If you will Compile or Debugging (Monitor)
your Programs, observe this Info and you get no problems. Otherwise you
get problems, because AMOSPro have some Bugs.
