@{b}What is Clipper?@{ub}

Clipper is a program designed to make it easier for AMOS programmers to
create icons and bobs. It allows you to 'clip' them from an ILBM screen
and also provides some useful facilities for managing icon/bob banks.

I know AMOS comes with an icon/bob editor but I find it's better to
create icons/bobs in a paint package such as DPaint and then clip them
out afterwards. Since I continually alter image banks during game
development I needed a utility to speed up the clipping process and so
Clipper was born!

@{b}Installation@{ub}

Clipper is provided as a compiled program to be used within the AMOS
environment. To install it simply copy the Clipper program and docs to
your hard disk or AMOS system disk.

@{b}Minimum specs@{ub}

Clipper was written on an A1200 with a 4 Meg Hawk memory card.

It runs OK on a standard A500 but it will slow down when displaying the
@{"magnified view" link SC_3.4} while clipping, etc.

@{b}Messages and requesters@{ub}

Sometimes Clipper will need to inform you that an operation has failed or
ask you to confirm your choice, such as when you quit. These messages
will be displayed in the title bar of the control panel. If a reply is
needed you will be prompted to press either the left or right mouse
button depending on the options presented.

are to be clipped.

@endnode
@node SC_3.3
@title "3.3"
@{b}Icon/bob display@{ub}

The icon/bob display shows the currently selected icon/bob if there is
one. If the display shows a bob it will indicate the position of its
hotspot with a flashing pixel.

@endnode
@node SC_3.4
@title "3.4"
@{b}Selecting points and areas@{ub}

When you clip an icon/bob or set a bob's hotspot, etc you will need to
define an area or point in the ILBM display or icon/bob display. When
this is needed the control panel will disappear and a cross hair will be
shown as well as a magnified view of the area around it. The cross hair
can be positioned with the mouse or 'nudged' using the cursor keys. The
zoomed view can be toggled on/off with the spacebar.

To select a point place the cross hair over the desired point and left
click the mouse or press the return key.

To define an area select one of its corners and then select the
opposite corner.

The operation can be cancelled at any time by clicking the right mouse
button.

 * When clipping from hires and/or laced screens the crosshair will move
   in lowres coords. This is caused by a bug in the way AMOS reads mouse
   positions.

@{b}About the author@{ub}

Hi!

I'm the CD Editor for MacFormat magazine (don't worry I still like Amigas!)
and I've been dabbling in computer programming ever since I got my first
8-bit machine, an Amstrad CPC 464.

Clipper was the first Amiga program I finished, or at least got to a stage
where it's safe for people to use (no major bugs!) I've already
used it to create several games which I will be releasing soon. Because I've
recently switched to programming in AmigaE these will be my last AMOS
programs. I hope Clipper will be useful to all you AMOS developers out there.
