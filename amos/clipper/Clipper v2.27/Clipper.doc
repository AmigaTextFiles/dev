1 What is Clipper?
------------------

Clipper is a program designed to make it easier for AMOS programmers to
create icons and bobs. It allows you to 'clip' them from an ILBM screen
and also provides some useful facilities for managing icon/bob banks.

I know AMOS comes with an icon/bob editor but I find it's better to
create icons/bobs in a paint package such as DPaint and then clip them
out afterwards. Since I continually alter image banks during game
development I needed a utility to speed up the clipping process and so
Clipper was born!


2 Installation
--------------

Clipper is provided as a compiled program to be used within the AMOS
environment. To install it simply copy the Clipper program and docs to
your hard disk or AMOS system disk.


2.1 Minimum specs
-----------------

Clipper was written on an A1200 with a 4 Meg Hawk memory card.

It runs OK on a standard A500 but it will slow down when displaying the
magnified view while clipping, etc.


3 The interface
---------------

Clipper is composed of three parts;

    an intuition style control panel,
    an IFF screen display and
    an icon/bob display.


3.1 Control panel
-----------------

The control panel gadgets are arranged into groups;

    Title bar,
    Icon/bob bank gadgets,
    File gadgets,
    IFF gadgets,
    Autoclip gadgets,
    Hotspot gadgets and
    Tool gadgets.


3.1.1 Title bar
---------------

 Hotkeys are shown in [] if available.

 Drag bar     - This lets you drag the control panel. It also shows the total
                number of icons/bobs in the selected bank, the selected
                icon/bob's number, size and colour depth and the amount of
                free chip memory. Messages and requests are also displayed in
                the title bar.

             automatically loads the file into the correct bank.

 [O] Show     - Hides the control panel and icon/bob display so the current

3.1.5 Autoclip gadgets
----------------------

 Hotkeys are shown in [] if available.

 [T] Start  - This sets where autoclip starts. Clicking on this gadget allows
              you to select the start by hand, alternatively it can be set

              block of the grid of blocks to be cut. Note that the Size and
              Gap must be set first.


3.1.6 Hotspot gadgets

 Hotkeys are shown in [] if available.

 [H] Hotspot - This sets the hotspot of the currently selected bob.

 The hotspot gadgets on the third row set the default hotspot position
 for newly created bobs...

 Cross hair  - This makes the values of the hotspot gadget the default
               hotspot position for new bobs.

 Presets     - Clicking on one of these gadgets will make that position
               the default hotspot position for new bobs. Right clicking
               on one of these gadgets will also set the currently
               selected bob's hotspot to the specified position.


3.1.7 Tool gadgets

 Hotkeys are shown in [] if available.

 Sound          - Toggles sound effects. It is off by default.

 [1] Cut        - Clip an icon/bob by hand.

 [2] Autoclip   - Automates clipping icons/bobs. The autocut gadgets must
                  be setup as desired first. The new icons/bobs will be
                  placed starting at the currently selected icon/bob. If
                  autocutting will overwrite icons/bobs currently in the bank
                  you will be asked if you wish to continue.

 [3] Point      - Lets the user clip an icon/bob by clicking on it. For this
                  to work the icon/bob must be surrounded by colour 0.

 [4] Palette    - Loads the screen's palette into the currently selected bank.
                  This is useful if you change the colours used in a screen
                  but don't want to recut the icons/bobs you have originally
                  clipped from it.

 [5] Horiz flip - Flip the currently selected icon/bob along its horizontal
                  axis.

 [6] Vert flip  - Flip the currently selected icon/bob along its vertical
                  axis.

 [7] Compress   - Attempts to remove any blank space around the currently
                  selected icon/bob.


3.1.8 Messages and requesters
-----------------------------

Sometimes Clipper will need to inform you that an operation has failed or
ask you to confirm your choice, such as when you quit. These messages
will be displayed in the title bar of the control panel. If a reply is
needed you will be prompted to press either the left or right mouse
button depending on the options presented.


3.2 ILBM display
----------------

The ILBM display shows the currently loaded screen from which icons/bobs
are to be clipped.


3.3 Icon/bob display
--------------------

The icon/bob display shows the currently selected icon/bob if there is
one. If the display shows a bob it will indicate the position of its
hotspot with a flashing pixel.


3.4 Selecting points and areas
------------------------------

When you clip an icon/bob or set a bob's hotspot, etc you will need to
define an area or point in the ILBM display or icon/bob display. When
this is needed the control panel will disappear and a cross hair will be
shown as well as a magnified view of the area around it. The cross hair
can be positioned with the mouse or 'nudged' using the cursor keys. The
zoomed view can be toggled on/off with the spacebar.

To select a point place the cross hair over the desired point and left
click the mouse or press the return key.

To define an area select one of its corners and then select the
opposite corner.

The operation can be cancelled at any time by clicking the right mouse
button.


4 Bugs
------

 * When clipping from hires and/or laced screens the crosshair will move
   in lowres coords. This is caused by a bug in the way AMOS reads mouse
   positions.


5 New features
--------------

New features added in Clipper v2.27;

 * Hotkeys for most buttons. Note: for buttons which respond differently
   to left and right mouse clicks, pressing a hotkey simulates a left click.

 * The zoomed view shown when clipping, setting a hotspot, etc can now be
   toggled on/off with the spacebar.

 * Tabbing and shift tabbing between string gadgets is now supported.

 * A nice colour change 8-).

Hi!

I'm the CD Editor for MacFormat magazine (don't worry I still like Amigas!)
and I've been dabbling in computer programming ever since I got my first
8-bit machine, an Amstrad CPC 464.

Clipper was the first Amiga program I finished, or at least got to a stage
where it's safe for people to use (no major bugs!) I've already
used it to create several games which I will be releasing soon. Because I've
recently switched to programming in AmigaE these will be my last AMOS
programs. I hope Clipper will be useful to all you AMOS developers out there.
