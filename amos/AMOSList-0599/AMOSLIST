   Well, I think I have a solution:


   keep it in GUI Amiga 0 mode, and add a multi wait.

Do
   Timer=0
   Repeat
      GUI=Gui Event
      If GUI=-1 Then QUIT

      *Multi Wait*
      
   Until Timer>3595
   SAVE_TIME
Loop

   the reason it was easting CPU was you left it running as fast as it
possibly could, so no time for other tasks.

   with a multi wait in there it should use very little CPU time.

(I'm sprised it didn't eat all the CPU time in Gui Amiga 1 as well...)


See ya.

Hi Everybody,

   Noope, you have to use 'Multi wait' because even with Wait Vbl amos eats
all the available processor power...

   My Philosophy to work the Loop detector problem is that the
Computers memory already has all the facts it needs to sort
them into usefull data without the need for fraction calculation.

   It needs only to know:
   1) The total number of Branches;
   2) The Node numbers FROM and TO for each Branch;
   3) The number of Nodes skipped between FROM and TO for each Branch.

   As each Loop can be imagined as a Circle (obviously), my original
intention was to somehow use Tangents from each Node as they are all
layed out in order round the Circumference. Way too complicated and
uses slow, fractional numbers.
   If, however, you can imagine (or draw) a Circle which is discected
around its circumference by the total number of Branches in your
Network, it can then be pulled-out to form a Table to base a Linked-List on.
The List length therefore becomes the total number of Branches stored in
memory.
The first column of the List contains the Branch number, second column
contains
FROM and TO Node connections for that Branch and the third column contains
the "length", or number of Nodes skipped (in order) to meet the TO Node.
   All fairly basic so far and no risks of crashing your machine at all!

   If you take the "lengths" of the Branches (as defined in the third column)
and re-order them diagramatically back into the circle, not bothering about
how much they overlap at this stage of thinking, you'll notice that they
share in common, "shears", making definate segments where the relationship
between each one is defined where they start and end. You'll notice that by
tracing with your finger around the circle, each Loop could be defined this
way.
   Stretch this diagram out again and it resembles a Brick wall with holes
where you couldn't find a row of Branch-lengths to fit exactly on top of
one another. This, for me is the tricky bit, which is why this method's
only theorised!

   By sorting the Branch lengths in their Number order, it is always
possible to form a "Brick Wall" with no holes, therefore, a Linked-List.
Once this list has been formulated, the Computer has a very logical view
of the data and can count very fast the relationships between Branches
and Nodes from an organised body of data at any time.

PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy and is a public key encryption program.
PGP encrypted mails are close to impossible to decode if you don't have the key.

Real Amiga or emulator?
REAL

How long have you been using an Amiga?
Ten years (on and off).

If you have a real Amiga, what is it's specification?
I've collected several A500's and am now starting on AGA
Machines now their prices have dropped.

What is your main Amiga activity?
It's always been used for the usual Text processing and
Game playing but the scope of programming is so broad
for this machine that I've become a Jack of all Trades...

How long have you used Amos?
About six years.

What version of Amos do you have?
All the versions.

What Amos extensions do you have?
Pro compiler and 3D, I'd like to hear what the others
can do though.

Other computer languages used and competence level:
Dabbled in the most popular, but I believe that
the real financial credit should go to those programmers
who can provide decent all-round applications so that
"US" can interface with the machine without the hassle.

Amos achievements:
It helped with programming the Amiga for my Degree Show
Installation.

Amiga achievements:
Reverse of the above!

Your Website:
It's VIRTUAL.

Website recommendations:
Just read my Mind.

Other interests/achievements: 
I'm currently collecting Electronic "Junk", which may one day come

It does indeed do something interesting.  Public key encryption.  An
easy to use way of encrypting files so only one person or group of
people can read them, a way of authenticating that a file or email is
genuine, and you can find out for sure who it belongs to, a way of
creating read only email that can't be saved via normal means, a way
of securing an area of your hard drive from all prying eyes, a way to
protect your online privacy.

The signing of keyfiles means, "I know who that bloke is", and anyone
who knows you, and trusts you, will believe who "that bloke" really
is.  Lets say someone writes a new version of mui and releases it to
aminet, and it turns out to be a fake, or something nasty.  With PGP,
you can sign the file, and people will know if it is genuine or not,
and if it comes from the real author.  The latest peecee version even
does photographs.

Lets say someone else sent you an email with a whole bunch of personal
stuff on it.  If they had your PGP public key, they could encrypt the
data so ONLY you could read it, not even they can read it unless they
use multiple keys to encrypt with.

Alternatively, if I wanted to send a demo to the amos list, or
something, (which would be a bad thing since it is a big binary) I
could encrypt it so only the registered beta testers could read it,
and be totally secure in the knowledge that no-one else could read it.

When it arrives to be decrypted, you need the secret key which you
create at the same time as the public key, and a passphrase, so even
if you have a multi-user system, you still have at least one level of
security to break, and those passowrds are encrypted, big time.

Don't need it ?  Why do you use envelopes in the snail mail service
and not postcards ?  Do you have something to hide ?  You must be a
drug dealer, or some kind of criminal.  I mean, who would use an
envelope on their post ?  Only a real criminal.  The governments must
be able to open your mail at any time, to see what you are up to.  The
same goes for email, except everyone already uses postcards, and very
few use envelopes.

Even if you don't think you need it, someone may prefer to send stuff
in secure format to you at one time or another.  It's worth having it,
even if you don't need it right now, you may need it later, and if you
have a keyfile that everyone knows about, it will be easier than if
you have one that no-one can vouch for.

It is FREEWARE and costs NOTHING to use.  There are commercial
versions available, but don't ask me about those.  You can get them in
the high street.  The encryption is so strong, the US government
classes it as munitions technology, and is annoyed they can't break
it.

There are versions for unix, atari, amiga, msdos, windoze, win95/98,
and probably a few others.  In fact, amiga is very public on the
site..  Paranoid lot us.  The version on aminet is a very old one, the
keyfiles it generates are still usable, particularly the larger ones,
although it has trouble reading the newer ones.  Version 5 Amiga is a
bit more complex to set up and install, but there are gui's available.
 It also plugs into email software - at least some email software
anyway.  Elm for example.  (email of choice on unix/amiga)

I would suggest you use it to "sign" email, just so people know you
are who you say you are, if nothing else.  Since you have my PGP
public key, you can check this email to see if it really does come
from me.  Of course, if everyone signs my key and confirms who I say I
am, and you know one of the signers.. Make sense ?

Pietro added an extra parameter to his =Gui Read() command to give it 4

were written in the old style. Anyone know what the last parameter should
be? I used to know but cant for the life of me remember. Thanks.

Hi Everybody,

   I know this was asked a while ago, and I know /I/ answered it, but has
anyone got a good routine to check if two lines are crossing? Speed *is*
important, so it can't check it graphically, it /has/ to be mathamatical.

   And also, does anyone know a way to check if a point is in a closed
polygon of any shape? (you know, like the lasso tool in dpaint)

See ya.

I don't have any routines, but I think you'll find the answers (with examples)
in any
3D Graphics Computer Book. The Crossing Lines Algorythm would be under the
subject
of Vectors (for Ray Tracing) and enclosed points should be dealt with under
the 
subjects of Hidden Line removal or Plane definers.

Hi,
   I've finally uploaded my rogram launcher, NetDOCK-2 to aminet, it's in 

pub/aminet/util/wb/nd2-unreg.lha

Ignore the readme file, the reg price is now £5. very reasonable :)

Oh yeah, this mail is totally irrelevant to this list, 'cos Nd2 is written
in Blitz, cos AMOS is shit for writing WB apps. No offence :)

IntOS is crap anyway, before people start writing in complaining.

Now, while I am talking aobut AMOS, how the f**k do u use AMOS 3D??? And is
there an AMOS Pro version of it?   
Cya!

Blitz sucks.

U R up2date my friend...... THINK NOT, have U tryed the GUI.Extension or the
OSDevKit??? IntOS is OLD and not even an extension, it's not supported
anymore, IntOS goes way back to 1993, I do not know who mad the IntOS,
and if they are on this list I'll have to say sorry, but IT IS SO BAD, it's
not worth using, you have no background in what you claim if the newest
you have tryed was IntOS, go grab the GUI.Extension and play with it,
then come back and tell us how happy you are ;).

It IS possible to make WBapps in AMOS and it's VERY easy, give it a try and
you'll be surpriced, you even use GadToolsBOX to make you'r gui in so why
wait, JUST DO IT.

Status: O
X-Status: 

From: <cheila@saintolaves.demon.co.uk>

Hi

Here is a nice algorithm to check if line segments cross:

Input:

Line1: x0,y0 - x1,y1 
Line2: u0,v0 - u1,v1
(with _1 >= _0)

Step 1: Check bounding boxes

if u0 > x1 then not cross
if u1 < x0 then not cross
if v0 > y1 then not cross
if v1 < y0 then not cross

Step 2: Check cross

line1: x = x1*t + (1-t)*x0, y = y1*t + (1-t)*y0
line2: x = u1*s + (1-s)*u0, y = v1*s + (1-s)*v0

solve for s, t (simultaneous equations, simple)
if 0 <= t <= 1 and 0 <= s <= 1 then cross

Step 3: Find intersection (may not be needed)

substitute t or s to find x, y


I think this is one of the best algorithms, but there may
be some more.  There are more complicated versions for
polygons in 3D (if that's what you're doing).

Hope this helps

Claude

Subject: Re: [amos-list] point in polygon
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: <cheila@saintolaves.demon.co.uk>

Hi

The simplest way to check if a point is in a polygon is to
draw a line (in any direction) from your point to way 
outside the shape.  If the number of intersections of this
line with edges of the polygon is odd, then you are in
the shape, otherwise outside (mmm, topology...).  You
might have to be careful about corners though, you might
slip through a non-existent gap or cross twice because of
rounding errors.

This might be slow, but you could always pick a simple line
(always horizontal, say) and optimise the line intersection
calculation for that (check y bounding box first, and only
one edge of x box).

I did read a good book on it ages ago, with all the algorithms
you would ever need (including line drawing, polygon filling,
drawing circles, splines, and other mad stuff in 2d and 3d),
I think it was called Fundamentals of Interactive Computer
Graphics but I'm not sure.

Incidentally, are you using integers or floats?  I'm not too
good at using integers (need to many "tricks"), but floats
are slow.

Subject: [amos-list] CGX/P96 Screens and Amos.
Status: RO
X-Status: 

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   Does anybody know ANY way of taking an Amos screen and copying it to a
CGX/P96 screen? 

   It'd have to do some kind of panalar2chunky (ha ;) coversion or
something. So, any ideas? Does something like RTGMaster libs cover this?

   How about the GUI extention v2? Can that do it?

   Talking about GUIv2, where the heck is it? it /should /have been released
ages ago, how long can it take to write a doc? (or are there some last
minute bugs holding it up?)

   If you like I can beta test it for you, /I/ don't care if the docs are
unfinnished.

See ya.

I have the docs for most of it, but the TCP is being rewritten. Also, other
commands, such as zones are being added. You know the old rule:

This is probably going to sound really dumb, but the basic fact is
I don't know how to compile programs which utilise extensions...
well, Turbo_Plus anyway.

I tried to compile a game I'm doing in AMOS Pro, using Pro
Compiler, but I just get the error:  Extension not loaded!

What do I need to do?

Are you using the compiled version of the compiler? If so, simply recompile
the compiler.amos program in AMOS Pro as a CLI/Workbench executable, and all
the current extensions will compile from within the new compiler. You will
have to recompile the compiler each time you get extra extensions that you
want to be compiled.

It isn't too much work.

Load compiler_shell.amos into AMOS Pro. Run it. Usual functions, Source AMOS
file, Destination WB/CLI exec, compile. Make the compiler use the
compiler_shell.amos, and compile to another file.

It seems a little long winded, but hey, we live and accept because it is
AMOS.

It's an unregistered version, so it won't compile. Is this the free version
that is supposed to be a full release or a demo from aminet?

Simply load every extension you can find into AMOSPro, and then manually
compile the compiler program from within the editor. This way, you never
have to worry about getting the error again, as you have every extension
preset inside it. BTW, the compiler program is the only AMOS program that
uses every extension, your own programs will only compile extension code if
there was a command used in it. Boring info there, hehe

There are several extensions that have demo versions that are full releases,
but they have a code in them to abort compiling.

   when I installed the compiler it added some menu items in the user menu,
on which loads the compiler shell as an accessory etc. That works fine with
any extention and lets you compile the current program etc.

   maybe if you re-install it it'd do that for you?

See ya.

I did something similar to this, where i had a map editor for a game
which stored the sprite image of each map location to a file, so in my
game, i simply loaded this file and the map appeared.  I have attached
a sample of the code in which i used to load and save.  Mine only
writes 1 variable but it would be easy to adapt it to accept more.

Hope this helps

   To save:

Open out 1,"ChrData"
Print #1,a
Print #1,b
Print #1,c
etc etc...
Close 1.
   (remember the close 1 bit at the end)

   To load:

Open in 1,"ChrData"
Input #1,a
Input #1,b
Input #1,c
etc etc...
Close 1


PS. The order and position of the Print #1 and Input #1 variables have to be
the same, or you get the wrong variables loaded.

Gui Read() with 4 arguments?? It just use 2 arguments... probably you're
talking about the Tcp Read command :)

the syntax is:

A=Tcp Read(tcp/ip channel,buffer,len,user data)


the new "user data" param allows you to specify a value, wich will be
returned, when you receive the reply to the Read request, using the Tcp User
command.

It's usefull if you've several requests out, maybe be on different servers,
for example a HTTP request and a NNTP one. In order to distinguish the HTTP
and the NNTP you can set the User Data of the HTTP request to 80 (the
default HTTP port) and the user data of the NNTP to 119 (anyway you can set
them as you want!)

So using the Tcp User command you know if you've received the reply of a
HTTP or NNTP request. I use this method in AmiGate because it's able to handle
HTTP,FTP,SMTP together dinamically, and so i need to know wich kind of
request has been replyed in order to call the right procedure.

Gui Read() with 4 arguments?? It just use 2 arguments... probably you're
talking about the Tcp Read command :)

the syntax is:

A=Tcp Read(tcp/ip channel,buffer,len,user data)


the new "user data" param allows you to specify a value, wich will be
returned, when you receive the reply to the Read request, using the Tcp User
command.

It's usefull if you've several requests out, maybe be on different servers,
for example a HTTP request and a NNTP one. In order to distinguish the HTTP
and the NNTP you can set the User Data of the HTTP request to 80 (the
default HTTP port) and the user data of the NNTP to 119 (anyway you can set
them as you want!)

So using the Tcp User command you know if you've received the reply of a
HTTP or NNTP request. I use this method in AmiGate because it's able to handle
HTTP,FTP,SMTP together dinamically, and so i need to know wich kind of
request has been replyed in order to call the right procedure.

Run the Compiler Shell, and deactivate the "Copy libraries to RamDisk"

Subject: [amos-list] AMOS screen -> gfx card screen copying.
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   Ok, heres what I want to do:

   I have an 32 colour bitmap AMOS screen. I *want* to now convert this
screen into a chunky screen and paste it on a GFX card's screen.


In short I want to copy an amos screen to an RTG screen.


   So, how would I do this? I have sent a small program that does
'Amos Iscreen Copy' with the int. extention to a few people to see if it
works, but I havn't got a reply from them yet. I think it won't work
though,


So, does anyone know how to do it, either using an extenion or library or
somethin? 


See ya.

 Is possible to have a optimized version of compiler for 030,040,060 ?
 for use it with a ascii source , because the tokenise phase is too slow
 with my big source >16000 lignes and >570000 text length :-)

   Ok, I've changed my mind, it does work (on a P96 screen anyway.)

I guess that means it works on a CGX screen too ;)

See ya.

From: "Chris Coulson" <chris@bay13.demon.co.uk>

Hi there,

I`m using OS DevKit v1.61, and I was wondering about a few things...


1. Is this the last version, or is it still being worked on?

2. Is it possible to get a version that doesn`t include the 10 second 
startup delay?  The documentation provided with 1.61 seems to imply a 
registered version is available, but neglects to explain how to go 
about getting it...

3. Will the documentation ever be completed?  Some of the 
undocumented functions I can figure out with reference to the RKMs, 
but not all of them.

4. Anyone got example routines showing how to use the datatypes 
functions to load and display images?


Thanks
Chris

X-Status: 

From: Lee Marchment <Lee@rgb-bbs.freeserve.co.uk>

Hi,
It's been a while since I wrote to this list, i've just beem lurking in the
background! 
anyway i was wondering is anyone had any idea ho to make a CD ROM tray
opener/closer program in AMOS? 
I've had a go using Dev Open command but with no luck.

also, I have a Creative Labs CDROM and it has a remote control which allows
you to move the mouse on the computer and stuff but the software was written
on a PC so I was wondering if it would be possible to read the commands being
sent from the CDROM and interprate them in AMOS

cheers.....

Dev Open opens a logical device, no such things as CD-ROM trays.
You have to send the correct command to the CD-ROM using
Send IO or similar I guess.

A question that I am hoping someone can answer......

If I am using the Gui Bar command to clear a section of a window every now
and then, will the window be thrashed after time?

Forgive me if this sounds a silly question but I want to know for sure
before proceeding and using this method.  Or is there another way to clear a
section?
Thanks.

Declan.

Ive used the above function many times. It should be OK so long as noone
resizes your window, as I believe that will cause the data to be
re-written. I always use fixed sized windows, so aint too sure on that one.

There is a cdplayer.library on Aminet (dev/misc ?) that
contains all the useful commands (like play, eject etc)
for SCSI CD-ROM (and IDE emulates SCSI), and OS v40 (CD-32?)
has cd.device that has the same and more.

Subject: [amos-list] Compiler problem
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Alastair Murray" <malcolm.murray@virgin.net>

I've recently ran into a problem with the AMOS Pro compiler.
When using it in the CLI I always get an Out of Memory error error
whilst tokenising the program.

This is compiling programs that used to compile fine with no changes
made to them.

Set Buffer BIG doesn't help.
The LONG option doesn't help.

I can only think I've changed my system somehow but I'm not sure how
or why its affecting the compiler.

Can anyone help?


Thanks,
-Murray

   Is it possible to hack an IDE port into SCSI?
   Where can I get information on the OS3 Kernals on the Internet?

   Please.

From: Leto Kauler <letok@netspace.net.au>

Okay.  I did a bit of rummaging and managed to find
Compiler_Shell.amos again.  I load it up and /try/ to run it.
Error.

Well... so I try to install the Compiler again.  Click past a few
questions.  *Do you have AMOSPro v2?*  *The Compiler only works*
*with v2* ............ I clicked YES.  Then it went and checked,
discovered I was lying and quits!  This is totally dumb!  I can
run the stoopid compiler fine separately... but not thru AMOS.

So, I guess upgrading to version 2 is going to cost money...?  Or
is it a free upgrade?   I think I'm just going to not use
extensions....

The 2.0 pro compiler comes with a 1.12 to 2.0 upgrader.

Subject: [amos-list] Sprite Banks
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Gavin Qureshi <gav@mc68k.demon.co.uk>

I've just started amos and was wondering how you put more than one
sprite into a bank. I'm making a Zelda style RPG and I also need to know
how to create icon banks. I'm using the Object Editor and Amos Pro so
could some one please help me. Cheers,
-Gav

--=====================_1242213562==_
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I have a small request to ask. Would all those lovely people with Amiga's
connected to the internet, please run this program and enter the
information into it. It will ask for your name, email and mailserver, and
there is a section at the bottom for any comments that you have. The
program will proceed to email both you and I a copy of the mail.

The reason im asking this to be tested, is previously in my older programs,
a lot of countries couldnt send an email to me via the program. Im hoping
this will solve it for me.

It was written with an older version of the GUI extension (Please get the
docs for the TCP commands done, I can't figure the damn things out too well
without them!!)

If anyone wants the source code for this, just ask in the comments box  =))

Mush

The OS DevKit is a part of the AMOS upgrade, and so you'll obtain it for
free!

Errmm... some problems:

I've not a 040/060, and anyway the DevPac doesn't support the 060 :(
I've a 030, but anyway the tokeniser doesn't use CPU intensive routines,
and so a '030 optimized version doesn't produce a considerable result. The
only way to gain speed would be to be able to fit the routine in the CPU
cache, but obviously it's not possible due to the routine size.

   I don't know off-hand ('just quickly looking through message list), but
I have got the Amos Pro Reference manual here:

Sprite Bank = Bank 1 only. Permanent Bank type (means it is created with the
program
and saved to Disk, rather than being generated by the program at run time).
The Bank will be allocated Chip Memory automatically. Chip Memory = Amigas own
(not
added Memory, like Cards, etc').

1) Draw some Images on the Screen using the current Amos program, or
   define the Screen using a seperate Paint program and load it as a
   visable IFF file;
2) Grab the seperate Bob / Sprite Data from this Screen using 
   "Get Bob X, , , To , ,"... in a Loop "X",incremented by the number of
   images you want to save in the Object Bank;
   ("Get Sprite..." is identical / interchangeable to "Get Bob...")
3) When the program returns to the Editor, save it to Disk.
   Bank 1 (Sprite Bank) will be automatically generated and saved with
   the program!
4) You can then alter the program to utilise the Image Bank/s further.

   Icons can be generated and stored nearly exactly as the Sprites
mentioned above, but they use Bank 2, instead of Bank 1.
Use the "Get Icon..." command instead of "Get Sprite..." to do it.

   Amos Pro also has built in Help, so to get the correct syntax for 
these commands, it might be worth looking them up and making notes
of them.

Subject: [amos-list] A bug within Amos Pro V2?
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>

I came across something that crashes Amos Pro and my Amiga every time I do
it so I am hoping someone else can test it out and see if it crashes their
machine.

In the Amos Pro editor, move to the very last line of your code, press Enter
to leave a blank line between your code and the code you are about to be
entered.

Type : Data "1.0",

Now mark and copy the "1.0",

Move the cursor to the space immediately after the comma on the same line
and paste the copied section and repeat.

I find doing the paste a few times causes the crash, so can some of you guys
do the same and see what happens.  Thanks.

Declan.

Subject: [amos-list] FAST gfx card support with amos, HOW?
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   Ok, I know I as this every week, but does anyone know a fast way of
copying an amos screen to a gfx card screen?

   I know I said that it could be done with the intuition extention's
"amos Iscreen Copy", but when I sent a small test program off I found that
it not only ran rather slow on some peoples setup, it actually flickered as
though it were a panalar mode, but on a chunky gfx card. (only on some
peoples though.....)

   The only system it acutally ran well on, was bloody WinUAE, where it
updated the P96 emulated screen at full frame rate ?!?!?! (WinUAE! on
Windoze!!! Faster then a real amiga!!!!!!)



   So, ·sigh·, does anyone know a good way of copying an amos screen to a
gfx cards screen???

Or, does anyone know why it works so strangely?

See ya.

Hello Declan

I've just tried it and it didn't crash. Maybe it's your text buffer running
out of space? Try increasing it.

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   Does anybody have a copy of Yam2 P7?

   If so try this: 
Just type this on a seperate line in the internal editor like this:

   yep, thats 'amos (amos with a ' before it). And put it on a seperate line
in the editor (thats right up to the side) 


   then try to put a space after it.


   When I do it, yam crashes!! It crashes!!!! CRASHES!!!!!!!!!!

(ok, ok. I know all it needs is 'a to crash it, but thats not the point)

Hi Everybody,

   I need a way of listing all the devices installed on my amiga.

I wrote this little program:

d$=Dev First$("D/**")
Repeat
  Print d$
  d$=Dev Next$
until d$<>""

but instead of just printing devices, it prints assigns as well!. (acording
to the manual typing "D/**" only lists devices.

   Anyone know a way to get it to just list devices?

See ya.

 Ok but is not possible to compile with a pur ascii source not token ,
 bevcause the E compiler is very speed with a simple MC68000 7Mhz ?

 Is juste an idea to use for example Golded to create the source .

If you compile a already tokenised program, the AMOSPro compiler is fast as
the E Compiler.... 

If you consider the tokens+compile time it's slower... but AMOS is a
*interpreted* language, and E is a *compiled* language! In AMOS the tokens are
essential, and the compiler is based on the tokens, a pure ASCII support
is not possible.

> Is juste an idea to use for example Golded to create the source.

Several people use this method... and anyway it's not so slow... with a
512K source code the E compiler is slow too :)

   Yeah, optimizing the compiler pretty insignificant when people could be
working on an optimized version of AMOS its self. (aka AmosNG, where HAS it
gone? I thought it was due the end of 98!)

Subject: [amos-list] Could someone please help me with Device listing.
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   I really need a way of listing all the devices installed on my amiga.
 
 I wrote this little program with help from the AMOS pro manual:
 

 d$=Dev First$("D/**")
 Repeat
  Print d$
  d$=Dev Next$
 until d$<>""

 
 but instead of just printing devices as it /should/, it prints assigns as
well, which is no use to me!

 (acording to the manual typing "D/**" only lists devices. I've tried LOTS
of variations with no luck).
 
   Does anyone please know a way to get it to just list the devices? (eg:
DF0:, DF1: DH0: RAM: etc.)

   I'd be really greatful if anyone could help...
 
See ya.

Hi ppl

I just encountered an odd problem with the compiler...

If i dimension an array bigger than the standard variable space,
(even if I Setbuffer with insanely high numbers) the compiled program just
exits with "illeagal instruction" error...

does anyone know how to fix this?

(it's probably something really simple that only _I_ can't see:P )

Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Ashton, Paul" <Paul.Ashton@uwe.ac.uk>

I program in Amos Pro of which I have version 1, but the 
the thing is I can't get any extensions or the Pro compiler 
to work!

I read somewhere that you need a later version to use 
extensions, Can I get an upgrader? Or am I doing something 
wrong?

When I try to use the compiled compiler it says it can't 
find a config file, and it doesn't work running it from 
Amos Pro! A config file wasn't included in the arc!
Anyone?

At the minute I have to use Amos 1.34 and the old Amos 
compiler to compiler my programs

Oh God why hast thou forsaken my AmosPro and compiler?
Damn You!

Any body else got the same trouble?

Most of Basics don't like huge arrays, whatever your buffer space
is.

If you store numbers or short strings, use a bank.
If you store big strings (like names), use a random-access file,
located in RAM:, it's fast enough for most operations, but your
code will grow a little bit ;)
Put your file on disk if it is *VERY* big, but never forget that
people don't all have plenty of ram. Or hard drives.

Hi Paul
On the 17-May-99 you said something about [amos-list] Amospro and compiler troubles,Oh extensions to (oo-er). so now I am going to offer a witty retort (well maybe :)


PQ: From: "Ashton, Paul" <Paul.Ashton@uwe.ac.uk>

PQ: the thing is I can't get any extensions or the Pro compiler 
PQ: to work!

PQ: I read somewhere that you need a later version to use

I don't know about the extensions, but you need 2.00 or above of
AMOSPro to use the compiler :)

I got version 1 of amospro too(which i love...much better than amos 1.3)
dont try running the compiler from amos. instead, autoboot the compiler as
a standalone(from outside amos)and it should be able to compile your
amospro programs. it works for me,

Subject: [amos-list] ?Math bug
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Rod Whiteley <rwhiteley@magnet.com.au>

G'Day all,
I'm writing a little utility that requires the use of floating point integers,
and I've noticed that AMOSPro (new version library) seems to do funny things
with them. For example if you type in 
A#=0.485
it gets converted to 
A#=0.4849998 or 0.4849999
I realise that this will only make a minor difference to the outcome in my
utility since I'm only doing first order math, but if this were being
compunded, then some very real errors will be introduced. I've even noticed
that occasionally 
30.00-30.00
gives a result of 
0.01
up to as high as
0.04
Is there any way of forcing more precision? (short of multiplying everything
by, say 10,000; then dividing by 10,000 at the end)?
If not, then what's the easiest way to include this utility written in C into
AMOS?

Cheers,
Rod Whiteley
P.S. I'm now feeling very sheepish about all the wisecracks I made to my PC
mates when the Pentium math bug was demonstrated, so help, please!

G'Day all,
Well, like an idiot, I wrote a query before I RTFM (blush).
Set Double Precision
seems to solve most of the problems, then answers still aren't exactly
correct, but they're getting much closer. If anyone knows how to get exact
results, I'd still be keen to hear from them
Cheers,
Rod

   Easy Pease:

type 'Set Double Precision' at the top of the program.

(it worked for me)

From: eydieux@esigelec.fr

Hello every amos coders,

I subscribed to the amos mailing list for the first time one hour ago.

I recently finished my first amiga game called Super Bubble Remix. As it is programmed using amos, you can be interested in downloading it to see what exactly it is.

You can find it in aminet ( directory "game/misc/" name "SBRemixV1_2.lha"). Don't hesitate to contact me to tell me what you think about that.

Bye

Hi

Computers use powers of two, so 1/2 can be exactly represented
but 1/3 can't (just like 1/7 can't with decimal fractions).

A solution is to use arbitrary precision rational numbers
(using long bitstrings, but very slow and awkward)
but this isn't really necessary - the order of operations
can make a big difference with floats.  Always try to avoid
finding the difference of two similarly sized numbers, or
adding a small number to a much larger one.

Hope this helps

Claude

Hello Matt,

>of dowloading and installing the latest libraries for AmosPro?

You need the official AmosPro updater disk in order to perform the update.
I am not sure if it is still available but I got mine from F1 Licenseware in
the uk.  I'm afraid I don't have an address.

You will need to have a window opened to use the menu functions. As for
using the same menu's for all windows, im not sure, unless you save the
main window and load it back in to gadtoolsbox and arrange it for the new
design.

Most Amiga applications that have menu options have a window of some kind,
try it. I dunno if it could be done opening a screen, I doubt it very much.

X-Status: 

From: Declan Gorman <declangorman@tinet.ie>

Hello All,
    Whenever I create an application with AmosPro and the Gui Extension, the
first window in the bank works out to be the main window.  The menu items
seem to only work with this window and any other window opened requires
it's own set of menus defined.  I am now wondering if it is possible to
have the application to continue even if the last window is closed and to
have the menus work on the screen and not just the window.  My thinking is
no as gadtools needs a window to create an application, or am I wrong.  I
have gone through the manual but could find nothing, so far.

  Can anyone help?

Declan.

Intuition screens can't have any extra gadgets or menus,
but if you open a full sized backdrop window (borderless)
then you can add menus to that.  This is the technique most
applications use (like OctaMED), and works well.  (Just 
remember to have a quit menu option...)

I am not at my Amiga at the moment and I am wondering if it is possible to
open borderless windows with Gadtools and the Gui Extension?  It is the
OctaMED idea that I was looking for, open any number of windows or zero
windows and still have access to all windows.

Just to give you an idea of what I am trying to achieve I will explain my
application.

It is a visual editor for my Yamaha AN1x synthesiser and I am using a
separate window for each of its features.
Window 1 : Common Attributes - Name, Voice Type, Midi Controllers, etc.
Window 2 : Effect Type 1
Window 3 : Effect Type 2
Window 4 : Effect Type 3
Window 5 : Effect Type 4
Window 6 : Sequencer
Etc.
Etc.

Each of the windows can be opened using the menu but I want to be able to
access the same menus from each window and not have to click on Window 1 all
the time.  I guess I could duplicate the code for each windows procedure but
I hate doing that.  At this stage I am just looking for ideas.  Thanks.

Declan.

AFIK you only have to copy the menu you've made in GadToolsBox to all
the other windows. Then you won't have to duplicate the AMOS code.

Hi all,

My HD has developed a very loud grinding sound on power up..
its very scary :) -  and I think it may only have days left.
the trouble is , I only have two pounds and sixty four pence in
my bank account so obviously I can't afford a new HD, and I
won't be able to for a while.. 

The thing is, when the HD spins up to speed it works fine,
no probs, no corrupt data.. 

My question is:-

How long could I leave my computer on for at one time..?
it is in a tower and has 2 fans, one on the psu and one on
my PPC060 accelerator..

I don't want to overheat it and blow something :)

so guys, how long do you think would be okay..?

   As a guideline, here's a couple of questions:
   Do you meditate Yoga in the programming position

   Would you rather take two LONG no-stop days to write
a line of Code, or WHAT?
   Can you even be bothered to wash?
   Does half of the 40K wage go towards Police protection

   Can you go to the Bathroom (for our American readers)

   ooookay,

Take my game 'Wizards Of Odd'. I wrote it because the game 'The Teller'
didn't work on my A1200. What was achieved was that I won £50 in the AF
readers game compo.

   well, there you go.

See ya.

I wrote a little AMOS program to mess around with my Voyager cache.  A
friend of mine had pictures of his baby on his web site, and I wanted to
save them.  When I went to use the Cache Browser program, it would
constantly crash.  I checked my settings and my cache limit was set for 100
megs as the limit instead of 10.  I guessed that there was too much in the
cache, and that's why it would crash.   So, I figured out how the files in
the cache were save and wrote a program to delete and file form certain
site and to delete certain MIME types.  I got my cache to about 15 megs,
but the Chace Browser program would still crash.  It turned out that one
files were corrupt and that was the whole reason why the Cache Browser
program would work.

G'Day Ashley
The motivation for the bigger things I've written in AMOS have all been
work-related. I'm a physiotherapist and 8 years ago when we started our
practice here there was no professional software aimed at physios to do our
billinig, accounting etc. So since I had to write it myself, I thought I
should do it in the most comfortable environment I could find. The actual
writing happened initially over about 3 or four days of coffee fueled
intensity, for many hours a day to get a working version running.
Subsequently, I keep making modifications as bug fixes and more major
modifications as the need arises. The most recent addition is a nice little
GUIExt add-on that calculates tax payable for our employees. I actually quite
like this little utility because I now reckon I'm getting the hang of the
GUIExt, and find it wonderful. I've never bothered to compile any of the
stuff I've written because it all runs on my machine (so I just run it
interpreted) this way corrections can be made 'on the fly' much more quickly.
Also the couple of tiimes I've compiled it, it hasn't seemed quite as stable.
I think I might compile the little tax calculator, and release it to Aminet.
On second thoughts, how many people would find use from being able to
calculate P.A.Y.E. tax in Australia on their Amiga? Oh well, as ever, the
motivation for writing remains entirely internal. Oh, I also wrote a few
little apps for my wife's work as a paediatric speech pathologist (little
educational things).
Cheers,
Rod

Personally, I do not look beyond my own needs.  If there is something
missing from my Amiga environment and it is not available elsewhere, I will
do it myself.  So far, any applications that I have written are based around
my music studio needs, librarians for my synth, a synth editors and a plugin
for OctaMED.  So there you have it, I am a selfish programmer.

Declan.

Well, abouts the only almost decent thing I've coded in AMOS is my
*explosiveCHAOS* bomberman clone game.  Looking at it now, it is
rather old and yucky....

But at the time, it was certainly a great acomplishment in my
programming.  It was designed as a 2 player game, and my sister
(13) and I still play it b'coz it is fun in a co-operative way
rather than as enemies.

So for me, I code mostly for personal satisfaction. And of course,
if other ppl enjoy it (and make the time to send comments) then
that's even better :)


Inspiration: not much.  Games on other platforms sometimes. 
Things which I would like to play, but don't have....

Motivation: initial ideas and the excitement of starting something
new........... which wears off within a few days.

From: "Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>

Hello All,
  I am looking to have a string gadget that holds a maximum of 256
characters.  Normal string gadgets have a rectangular shape and the entered
text normally fits.  I am looking to use a string gadget much larger than
the regular shape where the text entered wraps around and fits into the
gadget.  Gadtools only seems to centre text in the middle of the gadget and
any text entered beyond the gadget width is pushed out of view.

  So my question is, is it possible to achieve what I want with a standard
string gadget?  Or has anyone got any ideas on how to achieve what I want.

  Thanks in advance.

Declan.

   They arn't string gadgets, there text editor gadgets. I don't /think/
that the GUI ext. can do them. It might though...

I am a newbie (to this group only - not to AMOS) I programmed a lot some
years ago. With AMOS i was able to take out the maximum out of my A500. I
stopped programming as my hardware wasn^t anymore supported by AMOS. Now I
have an A4000/060 + CV3D and i hope that something is done on AMOS.
Does anyone know the status of those works ?

Hello Amos list,

I thought i'd just introduce myself as i've just joined the list. Well
i've used the original amos since about 1993-ish, and have made
alot of programs, my biggest project was a bomber man clone called
Bomb the Farm with various objects like pitch forks etc but I never
finished it. Some of you may remember Number 100 from Amiga
Format issue 100 reader games, well i'll own up to that, that was
my 'effort'.

These days I don't have much time for Amos but still like to have a bash
now and again.

My main project at the moment that some of you may know about is my
magazine called Amiga Information Online (AIO) which has been running
for two years. We've now released 24 issues with the latest issue
being released last saturday (22.5.99)

If you'd like to download the latest issue you can from aminet or our
website.

URL : http://www.aio.co.uk

Aminet : Docs/Mags/AIOV24.lha  (de.aminet.net)

If you've ever ventured to #amos on IRCnet then you might see me there,
i'm running kEwlb0t there which is #amos's new bot since Shell run by
Citrone is less than stable.

You can catch me on IRCnet's #amos at

Saturday, 00:00am - 2:00am

Saturday, 8:30pm - 00:00am (midnight)

This is BST/GMT (+1 hr for CET)

So if you havn't already tried #amos then why not pop by using any
IRCnet server,

irc.stealth.net
irc.cifnet.com
irc.demon.co.uk

etc.. etc..

You'll need AmIRC for the Amiga or mIRC for the PC.

Ya got me.  Maybe it rolls to the floor or something.  Or maybe it's reborn
in a new cheese in it's next life.  Maybe it just gets eaten.

From: Gareth Griffiths <gaz@jokerd.freeserve.co.uk>

Hi,
   I just realised that because of the last hard drive crash (which
every1 laughed at might I add :-( I had lost all of the source code
for my AMOS games and Blitz stuff.

Because I compiled all my Amos games, I ain't got the source no more.
So, could somebody look thru their AFCD Collection and possibly lend
me the following CD's:

Issue 102 (AFCD18)
Issue 103 (AFCD19)
Issue 107 (AFCD23)

or could u email me the following files from each one:

Issue 102: The Alien Pong Trilogy v2 drawer from the ReaderGames
drawer (I don't know what the drawers called, prolly summat like APT2)

Issue 103: The Shoot Out drawer from the ReaderGames drawer (prolly
called ShootOut or SO)

Issue 107: The Shoot Out 2 drawer from the ReaderGames drawer (prolly
called SO2)

IT would be VERY appreciated, as I need the source to take screenshots
of my AMOS screens, cos AMOS is not OS-freindly :-(

Cheers. This message is also going to the AMOS-list and the AFB, even
tho I don't subscribe to the latter now :)
Cya!
Gaz.

   I presume someones already sent them, but the best way of screengrabbing
