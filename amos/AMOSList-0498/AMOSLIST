 Hello,

 I'm now making a new game called Island 51,  with the complete support of Vulcan software (sorry, I have to boast)..

 Anyway, I need to have realtime scaling, like in Monkey Island, I, II, Indiana Jones and the fate of Atlantis etc.

 So if I click in the distance, as the character goes towards it, he gets smaller, how can I do this REAL-TIME (at around 12-20fps) in AMOS?

 All help will be noted, and stuck into the credits of the game :)

I get that too occassionally. Not when I first bootup AMOS but sometimes when
I've switched to the workbench-screen and wants to get back to the AMOS display.

And this is on kickstart 3.1 and AGA.

OK. Sorry. I forgot about the curly bits on letters like y right?
Then instead you should have:
X, Y-H+1   to   X+Text Length(A$),Y+1

Sound right?

Hi,

I also get totally lockup and a black screen with the new amos.library!
I have an  A500 with kick 3.1. Since I have that interlace bug, I wouldn´t
mind getting that library to work!


Regards,
	Andreas Näckros

	Is this version only for OS 3.x and/or AGA?

I think there's a little work left in that bug, 'course when I start AMOS
with the new library, then the workbench goes laced, quite anoying to look
at.. Result is that I've changed back to the old lib again..

URK..

Switching workbench/Amos/workbench/amos about a dozen times or so, I can duplicate
this bug.

Luckily I don't do that a lot and save every 3 or 4 seconds.

That works on Topaz 8 and 9, but not on bigger fonts like times-24, also some
compact fronts like tiny-6 don't fit on that. To make it work with all fonts
you need to know the font-size (height) in advance, as you do with the 'H'
then the folowing calculation is needed:

X,Y-Text Base To X+Text Length(TXT$),Y-Text Base+H

(Perhaps a bit tricky)

Oh yes, just a note: If anyone thinks about using this to put a box around some
graphic text with the 'Box' cmd. Then remember to do something like -2 for X 
and Y for UL-corner, and +2 for Y and X for BR-corner. Else the box would be on
top of the text and not around it...

What a strange way of quoting you have. I only said the third part

The Netherlands, but the name is Yugoslavian (whatever that means
these days). It's from a Dutch book that both my parents liked.

A few things. First I feel a bit guilty about all these suggestions
for improvements to the GUI extension considering all the hard work
Pietro is allready doing! Anyway...

I REALLY need to be able to position a screen as you would using
screen display. I want one screen over the top of another except the
screen on top should be lower than the screen below so they overlap a
little bit. There doesn't seem to be anyway of doing this.
Can anyone tell me some Dos Call or any solution what so ever to move
screen positions??

If I create a program using the GUI extension will there be any
restriction on what OS it will run on? Also, what librarys does it
use?

Heres a few commands I think would be useful:
Screen Clone Logic/Physic(screen)
screen=GUI Mouse Screen
GUI Screen Task Name (screen,NAME$)
A$=GUI Gadget Name/Label (window,gadgetID)
GUI Grab Image N,Screen,X1,Y1 To X2,Y2  (Aga images)
GUI Paste Image N,Screen,X,Y
GUI Mouse X=x
GUI Mouse Y=y
GUI Get Bob Palette
GUI Get Icon Palette

and one which doesn't relate to GUI really but would be very useful if
any extension maker can put it in theirs: 
x=Bob Hot Spot X (N)
y=Bob Hot Spot Y (N)

Finally, something I came across which I found quite funny. I'm sure
any other Microsoft haters will do too.

"Star Trek Lost Episodes" transcript

 [Picard] "Mr. LaForge, have you had any success with your attempts at
 finding a weakness in the Borg? And Mr. Data, have you been able to
 access their command pathways?"

 [Geordi]"Yes, Captain. In fact, we found the answer by searching
 through our archives on late Twentieth-century computing technology."

 [Geordi presses a key, and a logo appears on the computer screen.]

 [Riker looks puzzled.] "What the hell is 'Microsoft'?"

 [Data turns to answer.] "Allow me to explain. We will send this
 program, for some reason called 'Windows', through the Borg command
 pathways. Once inside their root command unit, it will begin consuming
 system resources at an unstoppable rate."

 [Picard] "But the Borg have the ability to adapt. Won't they alter
 their processing systems to increase their storage capacity?"

 [Data] "Yes, Captain. But when 'Windows' detects this, it creates a new
 version of itself known as an 'upgrade'. The use of resources increases
 exponentially with each iteration. The Borg will not be able to adapt
 quickly enough. Eventually all of their processing ability will be
 taken over and none will be available for their normal operational
 functions."

 [Picard] "Excellent work. This is even better than that 'unsolvable
 geometric shape' idea."

  . . 15 Minutes Later . . .

 [Data] "Captain, We have successfully installed the 'Windows' in the
 command unit and as expected it immediately consumed 85% of all
 resources. We however have not received any confirmation of the
 expected 'upgrade'."

 [Geordi] "Our scanners have picked up an increase in Borg storage and
 CPU capacity to compensate, but we still have no indication of an
 'upgrade' to compensate for their increase."

 [Picard] "Data, scan the history banks again and determine if their is
 something we have missed."

 [Data] "Sir, I believe there is a reason for the failure in the
 upgrade'. Appearently the Borg have circumvented that part of the plan
 by not sending in their registration cards.

 [Riker] "Captain we have no choice. Requesting permission to begin
 emergency escape sequence 3F . . ."

 [Geordi, excited] "Wait, Captain I just detected their CPU capacity has
 suddenly dropped to 0% !"

 [Picard] "Data, what does your scanners show?"

 [Data] "Appearently the Borg have found the internal 'Windows' module
 named 'Solitaire' and it has used up all the CPU capacity."

 [Picard] "Lets wait and see how long this 'solitaire' can reduce their
 functionality."

  . . Two Hours Pass . . .

 [Riker] "Geordi whats the status on the Borg?"

 [Geordi] "As expected the Borg are attempting to re-engineer to
 compensate for increased CPU and storage demands, but each time they
 successfully increase resources I have setup our closest deep space
 monitor beacon to transmit more 'windows' modules from something called
 the  'Microsoft fun-pack'.

 [Picard] "How much time will that buy us ?"

 [Data] "Current Borg solution rates allow me to predicate an interest
 time span of 6 more hours."

 [Geordi] "Captain, another vessel has entered our sector."

 [Picard] "Identify."

 [Data] "It appears to have markings very similar to the 'Microsoft'
 logo"

 [Over the speakers] "THIS IS ADMIRAL BILL GATES OF THE MICROSOFT
 FLAGSHIP MONOPOLY. WE HAVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF UNREGISTERED
 SOFTWARE IN THIS SECTOR. SURREDER ALL ASSETS AND WE CAN AVOID ANY
 TROUBLE. YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS"

 [Data] "The alien ship has just opened its forward hatches and released
 thousands of humanoid shaped objects."

 [Picard] "Magnify forward viewer on the alien craft"

 [Riker] "Good God captain! Those are humans floating straight toward
 the Borg ship with no life support suits! How can they survive the
 tortures of deep space ?!"

 [Data] "I don't believe that those are humans sir, if you will look
 closer I believe you will see that they are carrying something
 recognized by twenty-first century man as doe skin leather briefcases,
 and wearing Armani suits"

 [Riker and Picard together horrified] "Lawyers !!"

 [Geordi] "It can't be. All the Lawyers were rounded up and sent
 hurtling into the sun in 2017 during the Great Awakening."

 [Data] "True, but appearently some must have survived."

 [Riker] "They have surrounded the Borg ship and are covering it with
 all types of papers."

 [Data] "I believe that is known in ancient venacular as 'red tape' it
 often proves fatal."

 [Riker] "They're tearing the Borg to pieces !"

 [Picard] "Turn off the monitors. I can't stand to watch, not even the
 Borg deserve that."

THE END!

arrgh! I'm being driven mad by the GUI extension (still)

Its so amazing I just can't stop working with it but I'm getting very
frustrated with a few things I either don't understand or can't do.

It appears that if I open two screens, I can't use them both, only the
last one opened.
In direct mode using GUI GFX 1,0 would allow me to use screen 0 but
when used in an AMOS program this command comes up with a error (no
description though!) I think this is a bug!

Also, is there no way of giving your screen a public name?
e.g. When I have my program running and run the PubMan example program
it gives the only screens as being Workbench and my DOpus running. I
cannot get it to regonise my program as a screen.

And of course theres still that GUI Screen Display problem....
I would have attempted a bit of poking and doking or doscalls but I
can't even read the screen base of a GUI screen!

HELP!
Sorry for being so impatient but I really want to get this done!!!

Thank for any help,
-Murray

Hi,

Ive been messing around with GUI 1.7, specifically the Gui Display Iff
command.

It seems that it destroys the screen if it already exists, displays the
IFF loaded into a bank, goes back to WB and then the next time you load
another IFF into the bank it destroys the last screen.  Can this be
overcome so that the screen stays in front, and loads another iff screen
into itself without going back to WB everytime?

Here`s what I`m doing...

Open In 1,IFF$
P=Lof(1)
Reserve as Work 10,P
Close 1
Gui Amiga 0
Repeat
   Bload IFF$,10
   Gui Display Iff 10 to 0
   Wait 10
   'get next IFF$
Until <event>
Gui Amos

...also I can`t get any controls while Gui Amiga 0 is on.  I`d like to
scan for input during the display time.

Finally, I can`t get the GUI commands to compile.  The compiler reports
'Extension Not Loaded' (I`m running the Compiler from floppy with the
same AMOSPro_Interpreter_Config in it`s S: folder).

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer,
Andy H.

You have to use ModePro or such to make Multiview use a pubscreen.

I've never seen that operate correctly, either.

 AM> Would I NEED a monitor?

To take advantage of any new sceenmodes offered by a graphic card you
would need a new monitor, yes.

I will use the terms SVGA and Multisync interchangeabley here, as all
new monitors are multisyncs. SVGA used to mean 31.5 KHz, but today
that's where it starts. My multisync can handle frequencies from 30
KHz to 66 KHz. My A-3000 has a de-interlacer built-in, so it's minimum
output is ~31 KHz.

I can't plug a 500 into this monitor. I can use a 1084 on my 3000
without the de-interlacer. I can also use a 1084 for video out from my
VCR, but the multisync monitor can not interpret a signal from the
VCR (it won't sync so low.)

BTW, how do you plan to add a card to an A-1200?

 AM>                         What else would I need? (I've never used

If the graphic board comes with a de-interlacer or you add a
de-interlacer,  PAL and NTSC screenmodes are doubled to ~31 KHz so
AMOS screens will be displayed on an SVGA monitor.

Odd screen modes like Euro 36, productivity, dblscans, will not be
promoted, and likely will not display properly on an SVGA monitor.

AMOS 3 promises support for retargetable graphics (RTG). The GUI
extension promises support for RTG.

We'll have to wait and see how well these are implemented.

 AM>                                       Would I have to plug my
 AM> monitor into a different socket to use it? I heard one (picasso I
 AM> think) had some extra port you could use or something? Is this
 AM> true? Is this the same for Cybervision? Questions questions
 AM> quesions...

AFAIK, any graphic card should come with a 15 pin d-sub socket, just
like the multisyncs use. There wouldn't be any point to having it
otherwise :)

Picasso IV has a de-interlacer on board. All NTSC and PAL modes are
passed through at the higher frequency needed to feed a multi-sync.

Cybervision sells one as an extra, but supposedly it's not a pass
through. So you won't see the boot or GURU screens via the new
monitor. Then you would need a monitor switch or two monitors. Bummer.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

 AM> Thanks for any help,

 It sucked.

 Because its CD only, it may be expected to run on an A500, and that would slow it down badly.
 
 There's no plausible way that would work smoothly enough. I would however like to see how they did it in Flight of the Amazon Queen (since it was made in AMOS).

 While I'm at it, is it possible to have multiple bob bamks  at once, instead of adding it to the end of the current bank..

 IE:
  Main character set (around 50 frames)
  Other character (around 30 frames)

  Is there a way I can open up a temp setup for this, or am I stuck with adding it to the existing 50 frames?

 Hi...

 I made a program that was working fine up until now.. It says its out of data, and to be honest, DATA statements have always left me out in the cold.

 If you can help, I'll mail you the prog (its only a beta version) and the assosiated files.. luckily its only one room so far.

 Please note that this is a BETA version and is NOT TO BE GIVEN OUT TO ANYBODY (as said so by Vulcan software, and I know why).

 The sooner you reply to this the better!

:(...
I downloaded the new version of amos.library today and replaced the
old with the new one (not throwing away the old ofcourse :)).
Actually I almost never use an interlace screen but anyway, as I was just
using a lowres screen in AMOS and used Amiga-A to switch to DPaint suddenly
Interlace was activated. Pretty annoying and useless to use a lowres
screen with interlace don't you think? :).
Luckily, when you switch to another screen the interlace bit is being
deactivated again.

Please fix this bug because whe can't use a new one :(.

Why before April 15th if I might ask !?
Is there something special about it or did you just
pick it as an deadline ?

Anyway, has anyone seen the programs I've uploaded to mush's
ftp site. (AMOSLife.lzx, Cells.lzx, Computerface.lzx, GfxProgs.lzx).
They are some of my older programs. Especially check out
computerface :)).

Hi!

Thanks for the several reports... but i've a terrible suspect about the bug of
my amos.library :(

Anyway attached here there is a "new" amos.library... this is the orginal
code, i've not modified nothing, just reassembled the source code. Try it, and
let me know if there are problems...

Ah, this version (.. and the other) works with AmosPro 2.0 only!

P.S I'm *sorry* for the message length, next time i'll put the archive on my
homepage....

Well I've already done all your suggestions but the only solution is
still when I either cut some code out or cut some variable space out.

Now I'd love this problem to NOT be the fact thats its too big as I
can't solve that but its still the only explanation I've got...

Hmmm.. depends how big the characters are. If they're about Monkey
Island size, you could try use the ZOOM command.
So.. say you need one of the walking frames or something.. say frame
7... paste it onto the top left of a hidden screen, the use the ZOOM
command, and do a GET BOB and use the end of the sprite list or
something as a temp place where you hold the newly scaled (but
temporary) character - you don't want to overwrite the original
graphics.
So in a way, you'll have all your images loaded as sprites/bobs, but you
only ever display the last one (zoomed one) for your character.
It has a few problems though:
You wont be able to use AMAL 'cause it's always the same image you will
be using.. but that isn't too huge a problem.
It may get a bit annoying to code when you have variable numbers of
people on the screen that move around. So either they can't move
anywhere or you'll have something like   Length(1) is the main
character, Length(1)-1 all the way to Length(1)-bla  for all the other
characters.

There is also the speed thing. The ZOOM function takes a while to do...
but it shouldn't be noticable unless you have huge characters (as I
said, Monkey Island size should be fine), also, compiling should reduce
that a bit too. You may run into trouble if you're moving around 5 or so
people.
It's also a bit untidy to be constantly pasting, zooming, copying the
characters. I'm not sure how many frames of animation your characters
have but I guess it's probably to large to hold on some hidden screen so
that you don't actually load a sprite bank, you just have a screen with
all the frames on it.
There is another, much faster way... it involves a routine used in the
Sprite/Object Creator accessory given with AMOS, there's an assembler
program called Fast Zoom or something, it seems to be pretty damn
quick... shame I have no idea how it works, but if anybody else knows,
maybe they can help.

One final note about scaling, it looks cool when your character walks
away into the distance, but when they get close to the camera, they get
pretty chunky, so either you're gonna have to draw the characters big,
or just have a limit where they reach the foreground and not scale any
larger.

Well.. hope it helped, if anything sounds stupid or confusing, just yell
back.

Good Luck.

Ricky.

Hi!!

I've used the amos.library (without interlace bug) since it came out,
and it works like a charme.

I can flip betwen amos and wb multible times without problems, the old library
used to make gfxgarbage and lock the system very often, but that problem is
gone.

The amos.library sendt to the mailing list is exactly the same as the one that
followed my original amos v2.00, so nothing has changed since that time :).

I'm using:

A4k
CyberStorm 060 MKII
CyberVision 64/4
CyberSCSI MKII

KS/WB 3.1 (KS:r40.68/WB:r40.42)

Perhaps the problems that some people has, is related to the 500/KS 3.1
combination,
or maby in the Revision of the KS/WB.

For those who are interested, a mate of mine made a small animation for the
new AMOSPro logo. It can be grabbed from my FTP site in /pub/newamos/ as an
AVI file, and also an AnimGIF. Please give me your comments to the list if
you prefer, that way the points can be argued out.

No, just change "256*1024" (in the first line) to "256"
You could say that my program was designed to move big chunks of memory, but
it should work with small blocks as well :)

X-Mailer: YAM 1.3.5 [020] - Amiga Mailer by Marcel Beck
Subject: Gui Help Needed
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: O
X-Status: 

I've been trying to use the Gui Extension to add a proper front-end to a
little file conversion utility I wrote some time ago. I'm using GUI 1.7beta.

I've created my Gui in GadtoolsBox--no problem.
Converted the Gui into an AMOS bank--OK so far.
Thus far, everything works when I run the Gui alone.

I want the user to press a button to bring up a file selector(I'm OK with
bringing up the selector-thanks to Mush's example code). How do I know if a
button has been selected? What does it return when pressed?

Once the file is chosen I want the file name to be displayed in a text box (is
this the right gadget to use?). How do I get the file string into the text
box?

As well, I'd like another text box to display the data as it is being
processed, but I imagine this is the same as above.

I realize that the complete docs are about to come out but if anyone can help
I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Dale

OK, the easiest way to check, is to look in GUI FILE$ and GUI DIR$ for the
values. If the user hit CANCEL then the 2 should be emptystrings.

Simple. FILE$=Gui Asl$():Gui Set window,gadget,0,VARPTR(FILE$)

Use a similar method as above

:(
On my system, almost the same as yours,  the library hangs everything
with the black screen...
Too bad, because I miss the interlace mode very much.

I'm using:
A3000
CyberStorm 060 MKII
CyberVision 64/2
KS/WB 3.1 (KS:r40.68/WB:r40.42)

I'm also using MCX, ModePro and Dopus566 as patches...

A will return the button number.

 What does it return when pressed?

Gui Code or something will get you the rest of the info. This is all in the
docs, you know. Q8-{) Don't worry, Mush is doing more examples, and I'm
working on the tcp demos and commands. It will come clear soon.

Yes.

Thanks  :-))   Glad you like it.

I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to explain it well enough,
so I'm glad it made sense to you :-)

Always, when I write a program, I ask myself how can I save variable space?
Doesn't matter what language I use, that's just the kind of programmer I am.


Oh well... any other programming problems to solve?  <grin>

Right. Firstly, sorry this took a month to get a reply, but I'm not getting
the amos-list mailled to me right now... my boss objected to me getting
so much mail  <hahahaha>   :-(
So I only saw this when the list was uploaded to Aminet.

Anyway, here's my reply, for what it's worth.....

=-=-=-=-=-=-

Ok. Garfield's method will work, but it takes double the memory required
for the task - ie his array for a 50x50 map is (50,100).

If you want to do this using just a 50x50 array, and a minimum of extra
mem, it can be done with just four spare variables, rather than a copy of
the whole array.

The only caveat is that your array *must* be square for this to work (ie
same number of elements length and width)... but then rotating it would
be tricky without that being the case, whatever....

It's a little (ok.. a lot!) more complicated, so I appologise in advance if
this is a little long-winded.  ;-)


Lets draw up an array to demonstrate with:

      A B C D E
      F G H I J
      K L M N O
      P Q R S T
      U V W X Y

Basically, you're going to do the same job as Garfield's code - moving
rows into columns, but we'll move only four array fields at once, so we
can avoid having to copy the entire array.

Starting with the outer corners, copy the variables at each corner (A, E,
U and Y) into your four scratch variables, then copy them back out to
their new position (ie A goes to E, E goes to U, etc, or the other way
round...).

So we now have:

      U B C D A
      F G H I J
      K L M N O
      P Q R S T
      Y V W X U

This would be in a loop, of course, so we increase the loop, and do the
same job for the second in the array position after the corners - ie the
variables I've called B, J, X and P.

Keep going till you've done the outside edge of the array....

      U P K F A
      V G H I B
      W L M N C
      X Q R S D
      Y T O J E

....and then (you'll need a second loop for this), move inward, and do the 
next 'layer' of the array (G, H, I, N, R, Q, L), starting at the corners,
like before.

When you get to the middle, if the array is an odd number of elements, you
can even save yourself having to rotate the centre point (M stays the same
however you rotate it).

Ok... This is a rough outline of how the code would work...
It's almost Amos code, but not quite. (I'm using semicolon for comments, etc
;)
Anyway, it should be adaptable for most of you.  Hope someone finds it useful.


DEPTH=50; Map size

Dim MAP(DEPTH,DEPTH); The map itself
DIM TEMP(4); Those four scratch variables.

   :
   :

Procedure ROT_CLOCK
   LY=DEPTH/2
; You might want to hard code LY for speed and
; accuracy (ie to avoid wasting time rotating
; the M in my example if it's an odd-sized array)

   For LAYER=1 to LY
      For POS=LAYER to DEPTH-LAYER
         TEMP(1)=MAP(POS,LAYER)                 ; A  (or B or whatever...)
         TEMP(2)=MAP(LAYER,DEPTH-POS+1)         ; E  (or J...)
         TEMP(3)=MAP(DEPTH-LAYER+1,DEPTH-POS+1) ; Y  (or X..)
         TEMP(4)=MAP(POS,DEPTH-LAYER+1)         ; U  (or P)

         MAP(POS,LAYER)=TEMP(4)                 ; A becomes U
         MAP(LAYER,DEPTH-POS+1)=TEMP(1)         ; E becomes A
         MAP(DEPTH-LAYER+1,DEPTH-POS+1)=TEMP(2) ; Y becomes E
         MAP(POS,DEPTH-LAYER+1)=TEMP(3)         ; and U becomes Y.
      Next
   Next


To do an anit-clockwise rotation, simply change the last four lines
that set the new values of MAP, so they the TEMP subscripts go
in a different sequence - 2, 3, 4, 1.
In fact, you could turn the whole thing over 180 degrees in one go,
as well, by putting the subscripts in the sequence 3, 4, 1, 2. (that
would be a rotation, not a y axis flip).

You might gain another slight memory and speed bonus by not using
an array for the temp variables. I have used one here more for clarity,
so you can see what I'm saying, than for any other reason.


Ok. That's my say!

What kind of program is it, and what does it do exactly? have you tried a
counter-effect in the program to verify all your data you entered.

Thats old news. The only bit which "doesnt work" when you think about it,
is there are only 2 of the 6 disks that the updator disk needs to update. I
know plenty of people who have the coverdisk version of AP and bought the
compiler from me with no problems.

I just bought a copy after searching for over 2 years. Im holding onto mine
for life now. hehe.

> Question.1)

Yes, so long as it doesnt use any Pro-only commands. Extreme AMOS 3 was
written using amospro and compiled with Classic AMOS.

Heh.

Hi,
I'm not sure what the so called interlace bug is - I have 3.0WB - is
it 3.1 it happens with? Anyway my old libray worked ok, the second
47000 in size caused WB to be in interlace when flipping between, the
third is grand. One related(?) problem I have always had on my A4000
is that if a screen of size less than about 128pixels wide is
"wrapped" 1/2 way around itself - this was never a problem with my
A500.

Well, firstly, are the sliders >0 to activate the procedure, as this will
be called every procedure unless they are at 0. If your just looking for
movement, try putting a Gui Event before each one:

v=Gui Event : If Gui Read(1,0) then Proc 0

If your looking for just small movements, use a variable as well:

If Gui Read(1,0) And VAR<>LAST then Procedure 0

Explain the situation a little better!!

Thanks Andy.K for clearing up a couple of things.

Can anyone now tell me how I should install the original *1.3*
compiler onto the Amiga Format *Pro* coverdisks. I have tried the
standard way, but the install program asks for the *1.3* executable
(renaming Pro didn't work).

Again, sorry if this is all a bit basic (no pun intended), but we all
have to start some where.

Ta.

     I am not quite sure if this is a GUI related problem but I am using 
     GUI V1.7 beta in my program.
     
     My problem is that each procedure in my program is being called even 
     when I do not have any code specifically calling them.  My programs 
     main loop goes something like this......
     
     Repeat
     
     G=Gui Wait
     
        If Gui Read(1,0) then Procedure 0
        If Gui Read(1,1) then Procedure 1
        If Gui Read(1,2) then Procedure 2
     
     Until G=-1
     
     Each of the Gui's are sliders so I am basically asking that if a 
     slider is moved jump to the designated procedure.  What is happening 
     is that every procedure is called regardless.  Can anyone help?
     
     Declan.

Hello,

Here's a couple of things that annoys me on the GUI-compiler. I write it in the
hope that the author reads it ;-).

1) Why can't we get an option to compile the current program, just like the old
   compiler ???

2) PLEASE make a 'save prefs' option, I always forget to change the options I use.

3) I know the 'built-in' packer don't work, but how about an option to do a
   PP-pack on the compiled program (Or stonecrack or Intui...)..

Except from these things, it's a great piece of work, thanks...

Can anyone recommend the best way to compare colours and get a figure

   Excellent design!!  It's not complicated at all, in fact it's so simple
   it's brilliant (the mark of a great design!!).  Well done.  :-)

If I understand you right then you have two colours that you want to compare.
Use somthing like

MISMATCH=(3*(R2-R1))^2+(5*(G2-G1))^2+(B2-B1)^2

which can be optimized to

MISMATCH=9*(R2-R1)*(R2-R1)+25*(G2-G1)*(G2-G1)+(B2-B1)*(B2-B1)

which can be further compiler-optimized to

RD=(R2-R1)*(R2-R1) : GD=(G2-G1)*(G2-G1)
MISMATCH=8*RD+RD+16*GD+8*GD+GD+(B2-B1)*(B2-B1)

the lower MISMATCH, the better match. That is if MISMATCH=0 then we have
perfect match.

(
It's normal to weigth red 3 times and green 5 times. That just means that the
green is 5 times as important as the blue.
The reason why I square the differences is that it's better to have all three
colours differing a bit than to have two colours matching perfect and the
third one differing a lot; it's normal to square differences if you are to sum
them...

Nope, thats the only way to do it. When the extension is remade with new
commands, some of the tables are messed up a bit. This is standard for
every AMOS extension when upgrading to a newer version. Its in the docs of
all extensions.

Its a good idea, i`ll start it by posting one of my older tutorials from

Any screen, with a window exactly the same size as that of the screen you

You cant. ModeID`s are the same on all machines, so just use the A=Gui

you go.

Yes. One of my examples shows the command off fully.

Well, heres a tutorial I wrote a while ago and placed in Extreme AMOS. I
thought I would "Christen the ice" on this subject. The attachments are at
the bottom, in UUxT format.

NOTE that this tutorial, along with others, can be found on my FTP site in
/pub/amos/docs/tutorial/ when you log into mushy-pd.dyn.ml.org as
anonymous. I hope others who place tutorials here, place it in the drawer
(with examples) and upload it to my FTP site. Thanks.

                                    PART 1
                                    ~~~~~~
                            What is an IFF font ?
    
        I daresay you have loaded and played a game, where there is a nice 
    attractive font that appears on the screen, to display either the
    instructions or maybe the hi-scores. With a hi-score table, there are 
    endless possibilities for the names that you enter into it. One way of 
    doing this, is to read a font stored on the disk, but displaying these 
    can be a bit slow, so the need for an IFF font is called.
    
        A IFF font is a screen full of letters and numbers, that can be 
    called at any time from within the program, to be displayed anywhere 
    on any screen. These characters are all coloured in the same style as 
    the rest, to classify the screen as an IFF font screen. This screen is 
    then packed, and is saved to the disk along with the program. IFF 
    fonts use a lot less space than if you just had lot's of screens with 
    the IFF font displayed as instructions, or everything placed in a 
    sprite bank to be displayed later on.
    
        There are 2 kinds of IFF font, the first being a simple "Square" 
    layout, where each of the characters has the same height and width. 
    These are the easiest kinds of font to work with. The second kind of
    font is a non-proportional font, in which the width or height of the 
    font can change with each of the characters. These fonts take a little 
    more time to prepare, but still look just as good.
    
        Fonts can range from simple 3 or 4 pixel squared images, right
    through to a full screen in size. The number of possibilities that can 
    be acheived from the font is endless.
    
                                    PART 2
                                    ~~~~~~
    
                         How does an IFF font work ?
    
        An IFF font is really very simple to use, in any kind of program.
    The routines which I have supplied you will demonstrate how easy it is 
    to install a font into your program. An IFF font is read from a grid 
    in memory. Each grid space can either be a "Square" font, or each 
    piece can vary in size. The program creates an array with all the X
    and Y coordinates for each of the possible pieces, which is called by 
    the other routines. There is also another part to the array which
    contains the width of all the different characters available, which is
    more usefull when the font is non-proportional.
    
        Let me try and give you an example. Let's say that you decided to
    use an array called FONT. The program would create 5 offsets from that
    array, FONTX, FONTY, FONTXX, FONTYY, AND FONTS. FONTX and FONTY
    represent the top left hand coordinates of the top of the character in
    the list. FONTXX and FONTYY hold the bottom right-hand coordinates for
    the character. FONTS hold the width (in pixels) of the character just
    defined. Another way of doing this, is to eliminate FONTS completely,
    and use the algorythym FONTXX-FONTX, but the way I have described is
    easier to follow.
    
        The next step, is to create a string of all the available
    characters in your font. Let's say "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ". Now,
    when the INSTR command is used against the letter we are looking for,
    it will return with the number inside the string. Say you were looking
    for the letter "D", then INSTR would return with 4. So, it would use
    the SCREEN COPY FONTX(4),FONTY(4),FONTXX(4),FONTYY(4) To destination..
    and paste the letter "D" into place. It is highly important that the
    string containing all the letters is typed in the same way the
    information is entered into the array, otherwise the letters will
    come out different than what you have requested.
    
        The routines I have developed, have been coded to allow you, the
    user, to apply as little AMOS knowledge as possible. All you have to
    do, is assign the POSX and POSY graphics coordinates on the screen, for
    where you want the text to go, and the string you wish printed. If you
    decide to use the centring routines, then the POSX coordinate is not
    needed, as the program will automatically work out the position for
    you.
    
        All the routines in ALL my fonts use the same kind of parameters
    for different functions. Some of the routines have scrollers, and
    centering routines, which can easily be called in your programs. The
    variables I tend to use the most are :
    
                 TEX$ - The string to be drawn on the screen
            POSX - The X coordinate of the destination of the font
            POSY - The Y coordinate of the destination of the font
           SC$ - The text which is to be scrolled across the screen
           NUM - The character being drawn, according to the array
                  _SCREEN - The screen number to be drawn on
    
        I have eliminated the need to add loads of parameters onto a
    procedure call, saving space in the text buffer, so the program runs
    off the CURRENT settings of all the variables called. It is important
    that you make these values GLOBAL, or SHARED, otherwise they will be
    read as 0 by the routine.
    
        Any other variables are called from within the routine, and are
    not really all that important. If centering the piece of text, then
    you only need assign the POSY value with the true number, and the TEX$
    string to be displayed. _SCREEN does not need to be changed more than
    once unless you are working on a different screen number.
    
        If using the scroller, you can determine how you would like to
    leave the routine. I usually place a small routine in the code which
    will allow me to leave the routine if the mouse button is pressed, and
    I have taken this out of some of the examples. Remember, CTRL+C will
    break you out of the program, and back to the editor.
    
        If you define the statements as global values, you can also
    maintain the values of the last drawing, which is handy when on an
    options screen for example. You could have "Quit? (Y/N)", and then
    when the key is pressed, you could recall the draw routine and print
    the character, before moving onto the next piece of text.
    
        One thing which I like about IFF fonts, is the fact that they can
    be used in any screen mode, providing the font has enough colours, and
    does not contain more than the desired screen resolution. This means
    that you can fit more text onto a line if you go into hi-res mode, or
    less, more detailed characters on the screen if you decide to opt for
    a lower resolution.
    
        Because the program uses SCREEN COPY, the results it produces are
    almost instantaneously, especially if there is not much to copy. If 
    the font is small and are quite a few lines to be done, then it may
    take a couple of seconds, but it is even faster when compiled. The 
    only drawback, is that you can't merge the font onto an already-drawn 
    background, as it copy's the black bits from the font screen, over to 
    the destination screen. In order to get round that problem, you will
    need to use GET BOB, and PASTE BOB, which is slower to use than SCREEN 
    COPY.

                                    ~~~~~~
    
                   How to create an example font that works
    
        OK then, I am now going to create a simple program, which will 
    first create a non-proportianate font. Also included, is a scroll 
    routine, which when activated, will scroll a piece of text across the 
    screen using that IFF font.
    
                         Load and run EXAMPLE_01.AMOS
    
        As you can see, the font scrolls across the screen. If the screen 
    was not in DOUBLE BUFFER mode, it would flicker and jump quite badly. 
    You can also see all the DATA statements, which make up this kind of 
    font. Now, I think it is time for a proportional font.
    
                         Load and run EXAMPLE_02.AMOS
    
        This is a nice 16 colour font, which means that it can also be
    used on a hires screen, with some good results. Look at the DATA
    statements, and see how I built up the size array, using the TEMPA and
    TEMPB arrays alongside it. Again, I have chosen to use the scroller
    routine.
    
        Now, I think it is about time I demonstrated how simple it is to
    use the _CEN and _DRAW routines from within a font. The next example
    uses the same font as in example 2, but will centre a few words. If
    you look at the listing in which you need to actually perform the
    task, you will see that you only need to assign 2 values before
    actually running - The text string to be printed, and the vertical
    position of the text. The draw routine is called from within the
    centering routine, but you can actually move this around, and call it
    seperate of the routine.
    
                         Load and run EXAMPLE_03.AMOS
    
        See, dead simple. The hardest part of the entire thing, is 
    defining the font to create. Once the routines are installed, it is so 
    easy to use, in all kinds of screenmodes. This font actually works in 
    Hires, and so does the first example.
    
                                    Part 4
                                    ~~~~~~
    
                      How to create your own IFF fonts!
    
        Hmm, you do need a paint package to do this, although I am sure 
    that there is a program somewhere in the library that will actually 
    make the data statements for you. If not, I shall get onto making one 
    very soon.
    
        First of all, you will need to place all of the possible 
    characters onto a single screen, without them lapping over each 
    other's boundary's, otherwise you will get ghosted letters appearing 
    on the screen. It is best that you use a single screen, to any size 
    you need, as you would need to create another element in the font 
    arrays in order to determine which screen you are going to copy from.
    Now you will need to go into personal paint, or any other paint 
    package that you have, which will allow you to magnify the picture, 
    and show the X and Y coordinates of the screen. Now, write down a list 
    of all the possible characters available, and get the coordinates by 
    following these instructions :
    
      Proportional fonts
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
        Simply write down each horizontal coordinate of each letter, by 
    letting the crosshairs of the mouse overlap onto the first pixel on 
    the top, and the left-hand side of the letter. Write down the 
    coordinates. Now do the same for the bottom right of the character, 
    but ensure that the crosshairs are NOT overlapping onto any of the 
    pixels. You must also write down the 4 coordinates for all the 
    characters on the left hand side of the screen, and use an array 
    similar to what I used, with the across number of letters going 
    across, and the down going down in the loop. Also make a note of the
    width of the character in pixels, to be used instead of NINES()
    
      Non-Proportional fonts
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
        Unlike the above, you must write down all 4 coordinates for each 
    letter, and also the width (in pixels) of each letter, so the program 
    can add the space accordingley. Take the coordinates using the same 
    method as above, and draw a line from the left hand side of the char, 
    to the right, and the screen should tell you how many pixels it takes 
    (before you let go of the mouse). Pressing UNDO should remove the 
    line, unless you clicked on something else first.
    
        Once you have all of your coordinates, you can place them into 
    DATA statements like I did, spacing them out, with each letter being 
    on one line during testing, to iron out any small bugs that you may 
    have overlooked. When you know it is working correctly, you can then 
    reduce the number of lines.
    
    
        Well, I think that just about covers it. As you know, every month 
    I give away new IFF font programs, so you should never be short of an 
    IFF font to use in your own programs. Most of the IFF fonts were drawn 
    by people other than myself, yet the program was written by me, so 
    remember that in your credits should you decide to use any of my 
    routines.
    
        If you want to know more about any other AMOS subject, then why 
    not drop me a line at the above address. I also have other tutorials 
    available (all with source) which cover a whole array of different 
    subjects :
    
                              Graphic Equalizers
                           Tracker Tutorial Prt. 1
                           Tracker Tutorial Prt. 2
                               Databases Prt. 1
                               Databases Prt. 2
                                  IFF Fonts
    
        You can get any of these tutorials by sending an SAE and a disk, 
    or 4 first class stamps, to me at the address above. If you are 
    sending a disk, then why not fill it with some AMOS PD so I can place
    it in the library. All letters will be replied to as soon as possible.
    
        If you would like to contribute any articles to Extreme AMOS, then
    include them on the disk as well. Remember, any articles I use, you
    will receive a copy of the first issue they appear in. I would
    prefer it if you sent AMOS articles, but other things such as reviews
    etc. are welcome.

Newbie question I'm afraid.
 
Just getting into the whole Amos thing once more, and my first
project, like many others I'm sure, is a Breakout clone.

But I have a wee problem!

I have the Ball's Bob coords as x,y, and its direction as XX,YY. When
ever the Bob hits a wall, or a brick, the XX,YY are simply reversed.
But I stumped when it comes to the bob hitting either the side or the
top of a brick. eg-
 
 XX=1
 YY=1
 .
  \
   \
    *O*
    ___________
   |   |   |   |
 
 ...would result in YY being reversed to -1, yes?
 
 
 But what about-
 
 XX=1
 YY=1
 .    ______

In both examples, the ball comes from the same direction, so how can I
determine wether it needs to bounce up (as in the first ex), or
continue down (as in the second)?

I've read the manual on Hot Spots, but this seems to be more
/positioning/ than /detection/.

Any help very much appreciated.

Thank you all, and hello from Australia.

I am the editor of "Australian Amiga Gazette" the only Amiga magazine
dedicated to Amiga users downunder.

I would like to produce a series of Amos tutorials for our readers.
Even those Amos is looked down apon by many misinformed 
programmers I for one use it offer to meet a specific need when
no PD program can.

If anyone would be interested in devoting the time each month
to write a page for the magazine please contact me.

I am also interested to hear about any  projects you guys
are working on, possibly write a review on it when completed.

Thanks again

Hiya all,

Can  anyone  tell  me  if  they  manage  to  get Amos (or any compiled
jobbies) to display on a DbPal display?

I'm   sick   of   having   to   switch   between  my  monitor  display
(MULTISCAN:PRODUCTIVITY) to the video output via the TV Amazing box.

I  have tried ModePro to promote a few Apps and games which work fine,
but promoting Amos via this fine util seems to do nothing at all :(

Can anyone help?

Also,  will  it  ever  be  true  that  Amos Interpreter will run under
intuition and be displayed on any screenmode? Eh Pietro? :-)

Oh yeah, I have started my web pages and uploaded the first few pages.

Feel  free  to  have  a  look  and  tell  me what ya think so far. I'd
especially  like  to hear if they display fine on your system/browser.
Be it Amiga, MAC or PC.

If  anyone  wants  me  to  add  a link to their site, please send me a
banner and I'll gladly add it to the Links page (when it's ready :)

TIA. Andy Gibson

Hi Michael,

I'm making a graphic adventure in the same format as Kings Quest/Space
Quest/Quest for Glory.  So far, I have a joystick controlled character
that can walk around objects i.e. trees, rocks, buildings, etc,
collision detection, water depth detection, screen boundaries, and 
a parser routine.
Next additions: Swimming ( I should've done this once I had the
character walking in water ) & Map routines. 
The programming is no problem.  The graphic editting is even easier;
it just takes a freakin' long time.  Depending on how many foreground
objects that a screen has, it can take a good 6 hours to clean them up
and generate screen data.  If you'd like to see a screen shot, let me
know.
I'm trying to put together a 12 screen demo with a few puzzles to solve.
It'll have nothing to do with my storyline; just to see how everything
runs together.

Feel free to e-mail me anytime,
Ken

the only way to restore them by re-installing the old version, exporting

Hi all,
I have a couple of questions for which I hope there are some simple answers in
regard the GUIExt 1.70
1. Is there a way of writing a listview that supports multiple selection of
items (i.e., the ability to select many of the items on the list rather than
just the one)?
2. The GUI Clone command looks great. To use it I imagine I'm going to have to
open either a public screen, or a window on an open screen. 
2 (i) How do I find a list of the Mode ID's for the available screens to
specify in Gui Screen Open?
2 (ii) Is it then just a simple matter of using Gui clone 1,True to copy my
current programmes to a public screen/window in an OS friendly way?
Thanks in advance

managed to configure UAE so that it uses the internal modem.  Everything is
fine, as I managed to call a BBS from the emulated Amiga.  Trouble is,
AmiTCP is *evil* in comparison to Windows 95 with regards to setting it up
for Internet usage.  It's asking me lots of stuff which I've got no idea
about.  Can anybody give me help on setting up AmiTCP?  I can retrieve some
information from Win95, but I've got no idea if it's all that I need.  If
anybody can give me any information regarding the setup of AmiTCP (v4.0,
that is), retrieving information about my internet connection or anything
at all to do with this problem I would be *VERY* grateful (of course, this
is all assuming that AmiTCP is the right software to use for a
non-networked dial-up internet connection).  The information I have managed
to retrieve is as follows:

* GENERAL:
----- User name: "nsl"
----- E-mail: "nsl@clara.co.uk"
----- IP address according to mIRC: "195.8.78.15"
----- E-mail when I do a whois on myself on IRC: either
"du-1112@claranet.co.uk" or 
"du-1116@claranet.co.uk" (I suspect this means I have a dynamic IP address)

* DIAL-UP NETWORKING:
** SERVER TYPE:
*** TYPE OF DIAL-UP SERVER:
----- I'm using a "PPP dial-up server"
*** ADVANCED OPTIONS:
----- I don't "Log on to network"
----- Software compression is enabled
----- It doesn't "Require encrypted password"
*** ALLOWED NETWORK PROTOCOLS:
----- Network protocols "NetBEUI" and "IPX/SPX compatible" aren't allowed,
"TCP/IP" is.
**** TCP/IP SETTINGS:
----- I have a "Server assigned IP address"
----- Primary DNS: "195.8.69.7"
----- Secondary DNS: "195.8.69.12"
----- I don't have "Server assigned name server addresses"
----- Primary WINS: "0.0.0.0"
----- Secondary WINS: "0.0.0.0"
----- I'm using "IP header compression"
----- I "Use default gateway on remote network"

* NETWORK PROPERTIES:
** DIAL-UP ADAPTER:
----- I use "IPX header compression"
** TCP/IP: 
*** IP ADDRESS:
----- I "obtain an IP address automatically"
*** WINS CONFIGURATION:
----- I "use DHCP for WINS resolution"
*** DNS CONFIGURATION:
----- DNS is disabled.
* WINIPCFG
** HOST INFORMATION:
----- Host name is "NSL"
----- Node type is a "hybrid".
** ETHERNET ADAPTER INFORMATION:
----- Adapter address is 44-45-53-54-00-00"
----- IP address is "0.0.0.0"
----- Subnet mask is "0.0.0.0"
----- DHCP server is "255.255.255.255"

The information I need to know is - domain name, destination address,
netmask, default gateway IP address, IP addresses of the name servers,
domain names to search. 

Oh, and if anybody else wants to know how to get past this problem
(unlikely, but it might happen) I might be able to help with the
information that I receive (please!)

If anybody could recommend internet software that would also be helpful.
Please give full instructions on how to get the software, as I'm an
internet newbie, and I've never accessed Aminet before.  I've figured out
how to use e-mail, ftp, telnet, www, irc and usenet on Windows though.

Hello,

I want to know is it possible to make a timer in Amos that would display in
1/100's of a second? I know it can only be updated in 60th's(ntsc) but still

the timer and Amcaf's clock commands are only in ticks (1/60th)(NTSC) ne1 have
any ideas?

I'm approaching the end of the programming of my game, The
Turtleminator and now I've got to create loads and loads of levels....

This gets a bit boring for me after 20 or so levels so I've been
getting other people to help (such as the GFX artist etc.) 
This has the further benefit of adding variety into the level designs
as well.

Anyway, its still going slow so I was wondering if there is anyone on
the list who like to help a bit by designing a few levels.

The game is a cannon fodder style. The levels are quite small (but are
linked together) so it doesn't take that long to draw a single map.
The level editor is not the easiest thing in the world to use but its
not bad and anyway, all I really need is a basic level layout and
baddies etc. put in. Anything that is too complicated such as
switches, I can add in myself.

Anyway, any help at all would be nice. E-mail me and I'll send you the
game with the level editor. Please only ask if you do intend to try
and make some levels because I don't want to give it out to everyone
just yet.

Thanks,
-Murray

	Tobes,
	The secret is to check for Horizontal and Vertical collisions
	seperately, so instead of looking to see if your ball hits a brick
	see if it hits the top/bottom of a brick and also as a seperate
	process see if it hits the left/right side of a brick
	if it hits vertical side flip just Y direstion
	if it hits horz     side flip just X direction
	One way I can think of quickly to check for these two
	types of collisions seperately is to colour code the
	side of the bricks, and then check the colour next to your ball
	with Point(x,y) so make your brick like this

	01111110
	2      2
	2      2
	2      2
	01111110
	
	where the number reffers to the colour value at that point
	so hitting colour 2 would mean hitting a brick form the side
	hitting a colour one would mean hitting a brick on the top/bottom
 	hitting 0 wouold be hitting a corner (flip both X and Y directions
	get the idea?  Obviously you can use any colour values you
	want not just 0,1,2,3 and you can fill the brick in any colour
	you like, also to make solid colour bricks just make all
	these colour values have the same colour (ie all $fff for a
	white brick) anyway if I've lost you by now, just mail
	me and I'll try and put it into better words, till then
	happy programming! :)

Actually, it isn't impossible.  You can use the scan line position to help
you.
Just use this code:

TIME=Timer*2
If Y Beam<=(Display Height/2) Then Inc TIME

TIME will know be your time in 1/100ths of a second.  This is assuming that
you have a command called Y Beam, otherwise substitute it for your scan line
position reading command.


(oh, oops, minor mistake.  This will count in 1/120ths of a second on NTSC
modes - you'll just have to figure out the math yourself - I've had no sleep
and my brain's about to shut down...)

As far as I know it's impossible.

The screen you see isn't known to intuition so it cannot be promoted.
It's made by directly writing to the gfx registers :(.

It would be great if that's going to be the case.
I'd love to see the AMOS editor on a multiscan screen :)

It works with IBrowse(but you allready knew that).
The page looks great. Nice texture on the background, good contrast

   Forget about Vbl syncing as it limits you to 50 or 60 cps as you
   have pointed out.

   Check into the CIA timer, TOD clock, etc.  The CIA timer would
   probably be your best bet.

   I'm not sure what the default is for Timer A/B, but it seems likely
   it's around a 1,000 clicks per second or higher.  You'll need to
   perform some tests.  If I have some spare time I can check into
   making a little timer for you, but I'm damn busy at the moment so
   just take a look around for info on the CIA, TOD, Timer.device, etc.

It would seem that DynDNS had a couple of problems last night, so noone
could get on the irc server. Its working right now, so why not pop on for a
look, and see who else is there.

Heh, that's me again.

Ok, I have fully working samples from fast mem, so compile your samples as
iff files if I remember, and create a list of them, then run the "encoding"
thingie, and then the playback routine later.

I'll dig them up when I get a chance l8r.

Bobs from fast ?  Errr, dunno.

A couple of questions.

I've found out that the GUI resizes itself if someone is using a
different font.

e.g. on mine with Topaz 8, I have a window to fill up a 640x220
screen. However, on someone else's with a different font, the window
is smaller and looks a bit weird.

If I do GUI Sensitive Off, am I right in thinking this would solve the
problem and use Topaz 8 for all fonts?

Also, when using a scroller gadget which looks fine on mine (I use MCP
to change to xen gadgets) someone else cannot see the inside bit of
the bar at all (its the same colour as the rest of it).
This seems to me to be something wrong with his setup. Is this true?
Is there any way around it?

Thanks,
-Murray

Hi all,

I`d like to add some machine code stuff to Amos specifically fast
scaling and fast polygons, but I have no idea how to write to a
currently opened Amos screen.
Where can I find this stuff out, like the screen address, the memory
layout, how to plot a pixel etc?

I want to do it like this.

A) set the Dregs to point to the screen and set up the function inside
my machine code prog
B) call the machine code prog
C) reset the Dregs.

I don`t want to write an extension.  Can any one offer any help?

GUI Extension V1.70 Finally completed!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

        After all the problems and such i had been experiencing with my
machine, the GUI Extension V1.70 has finally been completed. The docs are
totally finished, and several interesting example programs have been added
to the archive. The archive is 272K (LZX Archive) and can be obtained from
me directly by sending an email to mushypd@redrose.net

        The library is also available for download directly from my
homepages at http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk

                             ****************
                             *IMPORTANT NOTE*
                             ****************

        The library has been changed within this archive, from the one in
the previous V1.70 release. Whilst writing the examples, Pietro fized a
couple of bugs that occured, and also added a few new commands (which are
in the docs). Please save your old programs as ASCII before installing the
newer lib, and there is no need to re-convert GUI banks made with the
previous V1.70 release.

Hi everyone reading...

Just  a  quick note to tell you that I have updated my web pages a bit
today and made some improvements.

Please  check  them out (should be available by Tues night) and let me
know if you feel anything needs changing.

Please  look at the links page also. Note that the AREA 51 site is not
ready,  so  can  any  of the A51 guys get to work on at least an index
page?

If anyone wants a link added, please send me a banner and your URL.

Speak to you soon....

Be nice to find a amos-kind  fr pc to make some money that then you can
spend on the amiga. Well, I just found this great pc prgram,
authorware by macromedia(www.macromedia.com), is kinda lie visual
basic,but you could do a simple game like an interactive movie-book in it.
Whats good is that is easier to use than amos, and it imports all kinds of
files, like avi and mpeg anims, digital video and sound, etc.
So you could even render an anmation in your amiga, convert to mpeg, then
use it in a pc game!!!!

Ok, I actually have 2 questions:

1.  Is there anyway to speed up the Bob drawing process.  I have 
about 12-20 Bobs on screen at once and the time to complete my loop 
is astonishingly slow for so few Bobs.  Is there any way to speed up 
the Bob drawing process of AMOS.  BTW the bobs are only about 16x16.

2.  I would like to know the syntax of the commands in the Turbo Plus 
extension.  I have figured out some of the basic ones from the demo 
docs (which simply lists the commands but not their syntax) but I 
would like to use the other commands too.  Can anyone help me by 
sending me the syntax of the commands?  Who is developing Turbo 
anyway?  I can't ever seem to get a hold of the author to register 
it.

Thanx,
	Mike

Where?? I've been over that page several times and couldn't find a trace of it.
Should be in the extensionslist I reckon but no.

The mouse pointer uses colours 17,18,19 (unless you've made your own)
and so you'll have to fade all colours except them manually
using Fade 4,0,0,0,0,  etc.  sort of thing.

If the picture you are fading uses those colours then you're in
trouble. :)

There's a error in your code. You first have to store the startposition
of the beam and reset the timer to 0. The following program I made today
works correctly and doesn't need the Y Beam command.
If you don't want to know how the reading of the beamposition works than
just skip the explanation and remove the comment lines.

There's only one little problem with this approach:
When the beam was on the last scanline and is only one scanline further
(position 0) this is 'rounded' up to 1/100 sec.

In reality this shouldn't really be a problem ;)).

' Timer based on timing of the screen that counts  
' ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' Author : Mark de Jong
' Notes  : - Based on Nathan Reynolds idea.  
'          - Timing can be done even more precise.
'            The beam position can be determined to 2 pixels precise ! 
'            And furthermore the Amiga has 2 timers if I'm not mistaken. 
'            (just beginning to learn assembler).  
'          - Using a more precise timer would be useless I think,
'            because AMOS isn't fast enough to be that accurate.

<sniff>  Every code fragment I send to the list has an error in it
somewhere.  <sniff>  Of course, I've only sent two pieces, but, well, you

	Hey everybody,
	Here's a quick but important question, does
	NTSC amos count in 60th of a second so
	wait 60 would wait 1 second as opposed to
	PAL amos where wait 50 waits a second?
	The manual for AmosPro makes no such distinction
	between AMOS NTSC and AMOS PAL and I've always timed
	my games based on 50 vbls = 1 second, but as an NTSC
	user I guess I could be doing it wrong, also
	lately I've been trying to code a game set
	to certain sampled LEd Zeppelin riffs, but the timing
	has been a pain, so maybe this 60/50 vbls a seocnd thing
	could explain my troubles, adn I thouhgt maybe amos
	was just slow in initiating the play of large samples!	

			Thanks,

     Is your loop slow when compiled?  Compiling your program may give it the 
     extra speed it requires.

X-Status: 

Hello.

First i want to thank Rune J. Keller and Alastair Murray for helping me 
with the Mousepointer & fading problem i had, sometimes i am so stupid!

But here is a couple of more problems i need a solution to before my Diskmag 
code is finnished.


Is there a way to get amos to check if the mousepointer isent inside a 
zone that is set up with The set zone command??

Something like this:  If mouse zone=no zones then do some suff 


And is there a good way for displaying fonts in your code and store them in 
some sort of a memory bank??

I've tyed the font commands in Amcaf from Aminet, but each time you change 
the font it takes up some memory, like this.


(set up 2 font banks with diffrent font)

Do
Change bank font 10
Text 10,10,"Amos REWLS"
wait 20
Change bank font 11
Text 10,10,"AMOS rewls"
print chip free+fastfree
Loop

If you run this proggy you will see that your memory runs down until 
you're out of memory, so i need some way to have the fonts in a bank and 
be able to change between two fonts many times without loosing memory each
time i change the font to the other one.

And last, i dont really understand the Gui Clone command, can someone explain
that command to me a little better, and will i finally be able to open a 32
colour hires screen with the Gui extension V1.7 and the gui Clone command 
and be able to print text, place bobs and fade the screen??????


Oki, help me out with those questions you know.

Thanx.

Morten Bolstad.

You might be interested to know that I seemed to have solved my
problems with Backbone.
One of the problems was that the AMCAF tool types command crashes my
computer if I don't run Newicons!  Sounds weird I know, but if I boot
my computer with one startup command missing "Newicons" then the
program crashs unless I remove the tooltype command.

Another does appear to be the fact that the program was too big. The
GUI extension has helped this as I no longer need all the custom code
to make my own interface.

Now, if I run a GUI program on its own 8 colour screen, normally
evrything is fine. But if I boot with no startup-sequence so all my
custom Gadtools prefs etc. are reset to normal, and run the program,
the slider gadgets have invisable sliders! Any one know why this
happens (its not to do with two colours being the same) or any way
around it? 4 colour screens seem to work fine however.

More GUI questions: Is there any way to detect whether your screen is
put to back/brought to front?
My problem is that I have two screens open, one is a normal screen and
the other is a overlaid screen that contains various things using the
GUI Clone command. What I'd like to happen is that when you put the
main screen to back/to front the other screen moves with it.
But what actually happens is that the screens are totally independant
and you have to manually set up the screens to be in front of each
other if you want to swap to workbench or another application.
Any ideas here?

Finally, look out for Backbone2  !!!  :)
Should be on aminet soon (if it ever gets fixed) and uses the GUI
extension extensively. I think its a good example of what can be done
with the extension. Its not just a simple, one or two wiindows on the
workbench like most demo's are. It uses several screens and tons of
windows, creating a large (and finally OS friendly) application!
Alternatively, E-mail me if you want me to send it!

Excuse the advertisements, but I've been working on it constantly the
last week to convert it to use the GUI extension and I'm relieved that
its done..... although it still needs updates...

Hi All,

   I am wondering if any one out there has or knows where I can get
a copy of the AMOS 3D library that will work in AMOSPro. I still have
the original version, so is there any way of getting it to work in
AMOS pro?

Also, does anyone know why some commands in the Intuition Lib V1.3b 
don't work (Set IFont, slider commands etc.)?


See ya.

Hi there,

Is there any way to get AMOS (preferably Pro 2, but I`ll use Classic 
1.36 if necessary...) to read/write to the *standard* serial port 
faster than 19.2 kbaud, using 8n1 RTS/CTS settings?  I`m writing a 
small utility to communicate with a digital camera, and the camera 
itself supports transfer speeds of 57k6 and 115k2 in addition to 19k2 
and below, so I`d like to have the software support them as well - 
downloading a camera-load of images at 19k2 is sloooooow...

I`ve found a variety of replacement serial.devices on Aminet which 
all claim to allow these sorts of speeds with the standard hardware, 
but I can`t figure out how to use them with AMOS, and if I simply try 
setting a baud rate of >19k2 within AMOS itself, I end up with no 
comms at all.

Is it possible?


TIA
Chris

If you can get the FD files for some of these libraries, then use the FD
extension to turn the library into a set of AMOS commands for use with
AMOSPro.

You need to have V1.12+ of Amos Pro, then select 'latest news' from the
'help' menu, and there's a description on how to use the old compiler
and the 3D with Pro (If you're running Pro 2.00 you have to step back
through the 'latest news' listings to find that of 1.12..

Try and grab 'Lserial' extension from Dev/AMOS on AmiNET, or get it from my
homepages (It think MUSH has it somewhere too), it gives a much better
control of the serial coms, and also hosts some usefull special
commands for processing information from the serial.device.. Then try and
combine it with the 8n1.device from AmiNET, but DON'T change your setup
in WB-prefs, use it in the LSerial 'Open' command. That's the most powerfull
combination of AMOS and the internal serial-port I can think of right now..
(Perhaps the baudbandit.device is better, I don't know..)

Hello,

Right on, after about 2 weeks delay, I've got a new version of the AlienBreed
3D-II Level Editor ready, It can be downloaded from my homepage in the moment
of writing, I'll also see if I can get it on AmiNET, I had some problems
uploading the last version, but we'll see..

I've jumped the version number, as I've got all of the editor running on public
screens now, I'd planned for a version 2.16 to fix some bugs, but as I went on 
I thought it would be foolish to release V2.16 and V3.00 with app. a week
in between.. After I recived V1.60 of the OSDevKit extension for AMOS, it all
went so smooth...

Anyway, as you can see on the changes list below, I've included some ideas
given to me, I've got a few more on the drawing-board, including a system
where the 'define zones' also defines the points as you go.. 

One of the most importaint news in this version is the full support for the
bitmap-frame-data used by the game, so the space-wasting, and always missing,
'.dta' and '.hqn' files can now be removed..


News in V3.00 (Released: 18-04-1998)
  ! RELEASE NOTES !
    - This Version 3.00 is running 100% on intuition screens,  Also  some  of
      the 'old' converters has been removed, as they were proberly never used
      anyway (Floor/Texture).. This version is  also  the  first  since  2.13
      that has been optimized, so it's quite fast and don't waste  memory  on
      useless stuff.. As a side-effect on the convertion to  intuition,  I've
      found some stupid bugs, especialy in  some  of  the  setup  procedures,
      they should've been delt with a long time ago, but has never been  done
      proberly... ENJOY !!!..
  * NEW
    - 'Build Archive' function, packs level and/or changed game-setup  in  an
      archive ready to send to others (Lzx/LhA/Custom). You should  read  the
      docs on how this works before attempting.
      !!! Thanks to Tiziano for the Idea !!!
    - Editor now uses the 'ptr' and 'wad' files for objects  which  the  game
      also uses, rather than the sometimes missing 'hqn'/'dta' files..
    - 'Vector-file-setup' converted to intuition-screen..
    - 'Set Obj GFX frames' converted to intuition-screen..
    - 'Define Bullets' converted to intuition-screen..
    - 'Define Guns' converted to intuition-screen..
    - 'Define Aliens' converted to intuition-screen..
      (The setup is split on 2 pages if you run on half-height screen)
    - 'Define Objects' converted to intuition-screen..
    - 'Define Players' converted to intuition-screen..
    - 'Define floor stats' converted to intuition-screen..
    - 'Level-Intro-Texts' now runs on intuition-screen..
    - Wrote a new general requester to define animation-frames..
    - Changed 'Delete' in the define animations to delete the  chosen  frame,
      and NOT the last one as before..
    - Added 'Insert' in the define animations..
    - New option: 'Level GFX', replaces 'Set Wall GFX', 'Set Floortiles'  and
      'Set Texture Tiles'...
    - New  option:  'Samples',  replaces  'SFX files',  'Background SFX'  and
      'Echoed SFX'...
    - The editor can now open  with  half-height-screen,  this  is  done  for
      those who can't stand laced  screens  and  who  don't  have  access  to
      dblpal/ntsc modes (See Tooltypes)..
    - 'Copy' and 'Copy All' is back in 'define heights'..
    - Point 'marker' is back, shows 'snaped' position of point..
    - 'Snap' can now be disabled..
    - 'Convert ObjFrames' moved to 'tools' and converted to intuition..
    - 'IFF->Walls' moved to 'tools' and converted to intuition..
    - 'Convert HQN' moved to 'tools'..
    - 'New Converters' now respects the chosen screen-mode..
    - 'Frames->IFF' changed to use the data the game uses..
    - 'Convert HQN' and 'Convert Frames' don't save the  now  useless  files
      '.hqn' and '.dat'..
    - Copy removed in 'Define Bullets', the import data function is  capable
      of doing excatly the same..
    - Copy removed in 'Define Aliens', Use import data to do the same..
    - Copy removed in 'Define Objects', Use import data to do the same..
  * FIXED
    - A left-over would make the 'old' screens look odd after painting walls.
    - Zoom now centers proberly..
    - Editor didn't show points at the very buttom of the screen..
    - The Editor sometimes set up some useless work-assigns, removed..
    - Removed some screen-swaping errors when requesters were needed in 'old'
      sections..
    - Fixed some crashes when calling requesters..
    - A stupid screen-swap was done when starting up..
    - Path in 'Play Music'..
    - 'New convertes' used some wrong colours on older versions of datatypes.
      (Why didn't anyone find this ??)
    - Editor now clean up memory better than before..
    - A large number of potential bugs, that would happen in very rare cases.
  * INTERNAL CHANGES
    - Wrote new general selector-routines..
    - Optimized some code in the screen-drawing..
    - Removed app. 100 Kb unused code and data..
    - Now compiled with OS DevKit V1.61 and AMCAF V1.50..
  ! NEW TOOLTYPES
    - 'OldSM' opens on a 664*266 Hires-screen, just like before V2.14. Except
      this will still be an intuition-screen. Overrules 'AskSM'...
    - 'ARC=' Sets custom archiver used by 'Build Archive'..
  ! New locale-strings:
    - 95,96,859,1202,1203,1204,1205,1206,1207,1208
      2100,2101,2102,2103,2104,2147,2148,2149,2200,2201,2202,2210,2211,2212,
      2213,2214,2220,2221,2222,2223,2224,2225,2226,2227,2228,2229,2230,2240,

Hello,

I have stupid problem, and the reason for me not solving it is proberly that
the solution lies right in front of me..

Anyway, I need a way to see if 2 straight lines crosses eachother.

Detailed information:
- The lines are defined on a 2-dimensional grid (X,Y) by their starting and
  ending points.
- The check MUST ensure that the lines actualy cross, it's not a 'they-would-
  if-they-were-longer' check I need (That's realy easy to to)..
- Speed of the checker is NOT very importaint, the accurency is..

I hope someone can help on that, I've thought about it for ages now..
Oh yes, both mathmatical descriptions and actual code is welcome ;-)

Code-segments may use 'AMCAF', 'EasyLife', 'LDos', 'Turbo +', 'Craft' if that
makes it easier to explain to a nut like me B:-)..

	Jens,
	The problem seems simple to me, check if the lines cross
	in the infinite case, and then see if the point of intersection
	is within the finite range you want to look at (ie the screen)
	Since any non paralell lines will cross this will work fine
	just solve the equations of the lines for any intersect
	point and then check if that point is in the allowable
	range.  Does that make sense, seems really simle so let
	me know if you tired it already and if so why it
	didn't work.
			Thanks,
				Scott Matott sXe

Well, I had the this same problem some months ago when I was about to write
a  collision  routine  of two polygons. These are the results of my effort.
Should be nearly the fastest method:

Screen Open 0,320,256,4,0

There is a directory on one of the productivity disks that has the
amospro_3d.library file in it. You replace the old one with that and 3d works
with pro.

Because Andy lost interest in debugging the program.

Subject: [AMOSList] Bunch of questions
Status: O
X-Status: 



  Hello all! Sorry if some of these questions are very basic, 
i'm very new to newsgrups!

- I have heard that there have been fixes in AMOS library 
(lace problem on 3.1) Where can i find those fixes?

- Now that development continues, where can i send bug
reports? I know some nasty AMOSPro bugs that are somewhat
strange and annoying...

- I have been coding in AMOS+Devpac for years, and I have
buyed a Blizzard PowerPc. Does anybody know a way to call a
simple Power assembler program from AMOS? I have the assembler
pasm, and the warp os and phase 5 ppc library docs.
A simple example would be cool...

Thanks in advance!

Hi,


   I tried to use AMOS' zone functions, but I just couldn't get the
hang of them so I wrote this custom routine which I think works
better anyway ;)

   
   You should be able to use this source in your own programs :)


See ya.

Let's see...

The solution is quite easy. If speed is not what you really want, the
trivial way is a system of two lines. There are 2 equations for 2 unknown
variables and so you get just one solution: X,Y. Now you have to check if
this point belongs to both the lines and you can do that just checking that
X is higher than the starting X of both lines and lower than the ending X
(obviously if you sorted the starting and the ending X). Then the same with
Y. If both these happens, then X,Y is where the two lines meet each other.

I hope I was clear... if you need I can write it in formulas or in Amos
code.

Bye

Hei Morten....

Please CHECK YOUR CLOCK !!!!


On 14-Jun-78, Morten Bolstad smashed the keyboard with:

Uhh I'm not sure if you mean a specific zone or ANY zone so we take both:

Not inside ANY zone:
If Mouse Zone=0 Then ......

Not inside a specific zone (1 for demo)
If Mouse Zone<>1 Then .......

First of all, you CAN'T compile a program that uses the unregistred version of
AMCAF (Ok, I know you can Crack it, sorry Chris..)..

Uhm, the easylife extension has some font-handeling, but I'm not sure if that'll
do what you want...

Hi,
I remember a while back reading that the use of global could cause
problems (crashes?) with some versions of Amos/Pro. Can anyone tell me
exactly what the problem is/was? 

Also assuming that it is okay to use global is it quicker to use
procedures? I know that Procedures are slower than gosubs because
variable space has to be set up and all that but if you only use
Global variables would they be faster?
