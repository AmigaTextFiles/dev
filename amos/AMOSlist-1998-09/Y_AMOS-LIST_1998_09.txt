TOME & Me!

Tue Sep 1, 1998 6:02 am
<pbrowne@qantas.com.au>


Hi there,

I just joined the AMOS list! Just how many people read these things? I
hope someone does!

Anyway, I've programmed with AMOS off and on since it first came out 'til
the present day. It used to be just part of my Amiga activities, now it's
about the only thing I use my Amiga for! Better than nothing, though...

I've written some various garbage programs (some useful, most just trivial
experiments) - nothing really worth noting (anybody need a Hexagon drawing
routine? or another AD&D character generator? - didn't think so :)

My first (and really ONLY) attempt at writing a game was some years ago,
making use of the TOME extension. Several versions of AMOS and AMOS PRO
later, and I find that I can't use TOME any more! My version of TOME is
well out of date (I can't remember what it is off hand, but I DO remember
that it's ancient!)

Does anyone know how I can get hold of the latest version of TOME (AMOS PRO
version!)? If not, what would be a good if not better substitute?

Thanks,

Phil 8-)

Dunno how many (can someone help me out here?) but you'll
find people from all across the globe here, well almost.

Same here. Too bad I havn't got as much time I need now a days
for my programming.

I think that that is because of two very good games - SkidMarks and Worms -
which are made in Blitz, and everyone knows that they are made in Blitz,
while I was surprised to hear that Vulcan's Valhalla is made in AMOS.

Rem Hello. I'm trying to get this snowfall to work...

Rem AMOS says Array not dimensioned >>> Plot SNOWXPOS(REP),SNOWYPOS(REP),0
Rem Might be more errors...

Rem Maybe some of you brainy guys could help me more with this one too...

dictionary layout

Tue Sep 1, 1998 9:15 pm
Hakan Venderlof <grok@flashback.net>


I'm planning to make a little dictionary,
the idea is to let the user input one word,
let the program search for the existence of that
word and then display a translation if it exists.

Little, but still there could be thousands of words in it.

Anyone got some idea or exampel for the basic layout
of such a program where the most important thing is to
make it as easy as possible for the programmer to extend
the database...

You need to globalize all your variables when using procedures!

--- Global NUMFLKS, SNOWXPOS(), SNOWYPOS(), SNOWYSPD()

Also the variable SNOWCOLOR is missing!

--- SNOWCOLOR=1
--- Global SNOWCOLOR

> REALSCRN=0 : _COLSCRN=1
> Screen Open REALSCRN,320,240,64,Lowres

You need to load an IFF pic here with some text for the snow to fall on -
backgorund must be color 0. Try with just

--- Cls 0

> Rem We have the new position, now check for collision...
> Screen ColSCRN

Have to be:

--- Screen _COLSCRN

The program still doesn't work that great due to some double buffer stuff.
Rewriting it would mean more work than doing a new routine, so... Try to
disable Double Buffer.

Well, I said there might be errors... wrote that "off the top of my
head" in e-mail program on PC. However, it just so happens that I
have my Amiga on at this very moment, so I will boot up AMOS and
throw together the snow demo...

Tome eh? I've never used it myself but I've heard that it's slow and
hard to use, is it? Anyway I'm afraid that I've never heard of an AMOS
Pro version, but you could try using the AmosTurbo extention. It doesn't
have any map commands, but it has /fast/ Icon commands (and other fast
drawing commands) Any I've used these icon commands to write a full
screen scrolling routine that can update at full speed, 50 fps, if you
use sprites and 25fps if you use bobs.

If anyone wants to see it then I can post a copy onto the list. (it's
quite big though, and *very* complex)

See ya.

Hey! All of U out there.... SNOW DOWN!
Right! Try and find an alternative 2 using point as it is a BLOODY slow command!
Try Using DMA or a gfxcall()... or maybe an extension!!!
I'm working on using DMA as it can be faster depending on how many bitplanes you
use!
There is GFX call... U can Use it for public screens outside Amos so I don't C
why you can't use it
in AMOS..... I'll include dat GFX along with my SNOW Program in my next E-mail
As I don't have access 2 my amiga at the moment...
Does Ne one know how 2 use the parallel port with a network cable.. like Parnet
or pronet as I can't get the parallel commands 2 function properly....
Also Does ne 1 know how 2 use bobs on a public screen controlled from amos!
I can do every thing else in dos int and gfx calls but I don't fully understand
the BOB Format!!!
I know how the Image Data is put 2 gether but I'm not sure about the rest!
PS.. Does Ne1 out there want me 2 program an Isometric snow demo for a game or

Hi Everybody,

> preferably where snow slowly builds up in bottom of screen...?

I've dug this one up from my 'programs that never got finnished' and,
er, finnished it. I had to do a complex work-around to stop the snow
making huge spikes going up the screen and its not very fast, but when
using AmosTurbo commands + compiled I get about 20fps with 200 flakes on
my 040/25mhz :) .

PS. I've left the turbo commands in there, change F Plot to Plot and
F Point to Point if you don't have AmosTurbo.

Enjoy

"John Glanville" <John.Glanville@btinternet.com>


Hey! Look! At this… Ne1 want a piece of code that turns the joystick input 2 +
or -..

Eg.

J=Joy(1) ;J=2 ; Joystick is Down!

K=J-2 ;k=0

P#=J/4.0 ;P#=0.5

P=P# ;P=0

I=Sgn(J) ;I=1

if P#=P ;This isn’t true 0.5<>0

X=Sgn(J-6)*I

End If

If P=0 ;This is true

Y=I*(K+K+1) ;Y=1

End If

Say you push the joystick up it returns y=-1 X=0!

If You Push Joystick Left then X=-1 Y=0

If You Push Joystick left Diagonally Up X=-1 and Y=-1

You Could use this in a game!! Something similar 2 tron!

Where U only need the direction in +1’s or –1’s!

I’ve used it and found it gets rid of annoying and slow If statements!!!!

Or U could just Delete this as it is a pointless waste of Virtual Paper! Unless
You have printed it in which case! Help!

Hey! Usefull tip For People Who want 2 scroll... DMA Scrolling doesn't change
speed dependant on what size of graphic it is moving... It may be slow at moving
small stuff... But if say you want 2 scroll a screen on 2 a screen... Screen
copy starts off fast but slows down as U get more of the screen scrolling..
where as doing it by Direct Memory Access doesn't....

So There U Go... If You want 2 Know what I'm on about check out the Logbase(#)

You can Use DMA 4 Tint effects 2!

Subject: [amos-list] TOME & Me!
So here's a reply...

Hi there everyone,

> Does anyone know how I can get hold of the latest version
of TOME (AMOS PRO
> version!)? If not, what would be a good if not better
substitute?

Well Phil, I have Tome which works with Amos Pro plus all the
examples etc! I can't rememebr where it came from or how long
I have had it for....

Dunno if it is illegal or not, but I have never used it to be
honest! It does work and seems stable enough.

The archive is quite big due to examples etc, but if you want
it, email me and I will send it. If this is illegal, I'm sure
someone on this list will tell me so :-)

Anyway, the offer is up for anyone who wants it either way.

I'm sure the author of Tome is long gone by now anyway and
seeing as Tome is not available to buy any longer, no harm
done...but again, if I'm wrong, tell me...

Tarra....

GUI Ext Silly Problem!!! (fwd)

Wed Sep 2, 1998 1:16 am
Andy Gibson <andy@agasinc.demon.co.uk>


Hi there,

From: Andy Gibson
Date: Sunday 30-Aug-98
Time: 02:41:25
Hi there guys,

I am using the command GUI Display Iff 10,2

Wich works well, it shows the iff image held in bank 10.

I can also clode this screen with GUI Screen Close 2

So far so good, but what I can do is:

GUI Display Iff 10,2
GUI=GUI Wait
If GUI=-11
GUI Screen Close 2
End If

I can't seem to get anything from the mouse at all on this
screen. It only works when i flip back (Amiga & M) to my GUI
screen 1 (created with Gadtools). If I click on that one, the
mouse is read and the GUI Screen Close 2 command then
works!!!

Anyone got ny ideas How I can access the mouse butons on a
screen created with the GUI Display Iff command?

Cya.

Hi Everybody,

> Hey! Look! At this Ne1 want a piece of code that turns the joystick
input 2 + or -..

Hmm, this seemed a bit too complicated, so I decided to check it out
(and I managed to kill 5mins at the same time ;)

I built a timing loop to test the 2 versions :

'different way
Timer=0
For A=0 To 100000
J=Joy(1)
K=J-2
P#=J/4.0
P=P#
I=Sgn(J)
If P#=P
X=Sgn(J-6)*I
End If
If P=0
Y=I*(K+K+1)
End If
Next
Print Timer


' Old way
Timer=0
For A=0 To 100000
X=0 : Y=0
If Jup(1)
Y=-1
End If
If Jdown(1)
Y=1
End If
If Jleft(1)
X=-1
End If
If Jright(1)
X=1
End If
Next
Print Timer

before compiling the Old way was a lot faster, but after compiling it
was a lot closer:

no joystick movement

Old:155
New:143

Holding down on joystick
Old:154
New:193

Although new is quicker when there's no joy activ. it slows down when
the joystick is pressed.

But, 50vbl out of 100000 loops isn't going to make a lot of difference
anyway so you may as well just use whichever you prefer.

Looks good to me ;), I've just updated my code with this idea, and it
seems to be a little faster now. Here is the new ver.

The New Official AMOS Factory!

Wed Sep 2, 1998 10:51 am
"Rune J. Keller" <keller@vip.cybercity.dk>


The allnew official AMOS Factory is now online!

There are a completely new design, support from the AMOS Development Group,
info about upcoming AMOS projects and much more.

This is going to be THE AMOS site so please help us to maintain and improve
the site with information about your new work.

To celebrate the day we have the ALL new AMOS Lib 2.2 (NOT the one sent to the
mailinglist a few days ago, but a new bugfixed version!) by Pietro Ghizzoni.

Even though the site is currently located at my server you can still enter it
through http://www.seta.it/amos. We hope that all AMOS users out there will
use and support the site and thus helping AMOS to be even better.

Rune J. Keller
Webmaster at AMOS Factory

DMA... Its all in the Bitplanes! 4 graphics Ne wa

Wed Sep 2, 1998 10:26 am
"John Glanville" <John.Glanville@btinternet.com>


DMA Can Be usefull but it also can be slow.... say for instance u wanted 2 Use a
tint effect in a game or something... Okay sure U could Use point.... read in
all the pixels... then change their colour accordingly 2 the tinted colours in
your pallete! Then again you must have a vastly Excellerated Computer!!!!!!! So
Instead U could Use DMA.... If U know how Screens and Bitplanes work its easy
from here.....

Screens work by layers of bits... take a 64 colour screen... it has 6 bitplanes
2 keep under control...
this is why the more colours U have when doin graphics the slower things can
be.... All of the first 4 bits, if they all =1 then the number produced from
11110 is 31 meaning colour 31... so if U turn the last bit 2 a one U are infact
adding 32 2 the original 31 coz Binary works like this

1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
1 1 1 1 1  0

Col=1+2+4+8+16
Col=31

and what happens if u add 32 to a number lower than 32 in a EHB palette? Any
guesses!!!
You change the colour 2 Half Brite....
So if U were 2 make a prog 2 just change the bits at bitplane 5 on a 64 colour
screen you would get darkening effects.....

But just wait till u use it with 256 cols on a public screen!! HEY HEY! Thats
fun!
Here is a bit of code 2 change the bits on a screen from your coords.....
Don't Let anything go out side the confines of You screen especially on the Y
axis
coz what You R seeing is memory on your screen so if You poke past the set
memory 4 Your screen U R likeley to crash!!!!
Use a clipping procedure or like i have 4 the mouse.
Limit Mouse 128,42 To 320+127,255+41
L0=Logbase(0) ;This can change depends on
what U want 2 do!
Do
MX=X Screen(X Mouse)
MY=Y Screen(Y Mouse)
PX=MX/8
AX=MX-(PX*8)
Bset(7-AX),L0+(MY*40)+PX ;All ways make sure that
L0 is at a logbase though..
Loop

You could also use copy or fill on the screen 2 get large chunks of Bitplanes
changed.....
Also if You want shapes just open another screen with 2 colours ( 1 bitplane )
draw the shape then grab that pitplane and paste it 2 where U want.. or U could
Use a BOB system!

Hooked...

Hi folks,

Summer is gone and I'm back.
In fact I've been here all the time but I haven't got any time to write anything
(We have a three-months-old little lady who have taken all of our spare-time).

I just uploaded my game, Hooked, to Aminet. Go and look at it, will you?
I think it's a nice try but it's not what I want it to be; I think Hooked should
be Intuition-based game (I've got only classic Amos so I can't use
Gui-extension).
If any of you like Hooked and want to see it working on a window I will gladly
send source-code to anyone who love to read crappy code and write an
Intuition-version of it.

I also have written a PC/Win-version of Hooked using C++. PC-Hooked is what
Amiga-Hooked SHOULD be - I'm sorry to say it, but that's a fact (let me know if
you want a peecee-version).

I invalidated my hard drive EVERY DAY with FFS, AFS, well, it's twice a
year, and you can almost always get yer files back quickly. Trouble is,
when it breaks, it breaks hard. Quarterback won't back it up at the mo.
In a few days (next time I see my friend with a few spare gig on the drive)
I'll be copying the whole partition over, reformat, and back again.

Interesting. Not familiar with that proggie. I never got on well with ffs.
Slow, nasty. At the mo, I have some of my drives AFS, and some FFS. It works,
and I hardly ever (twice a year !) get problems with any of the drives, and
I have an almost complete backup on other partitions. Unfortunately, the backup
suddenly failed for no good reason this time (it says the archive is corrupt
when it validates it) so I'm stuck with the data in the mess it is. At least
I bypassed the problem. AFS has the lovely :.deldir, and the lovely
removedirentry program, which are lifesavers.

FFS really did invalidate like every day. I was spending two hours loading the
machine on a regular basis, and running disksalv (or qbtools) every week or so
for a day and a half. AFS really helps.

I'd say FFS is more software recoverable, and MUCH more prone to problems, but
AFS has fewer problems, and the data is practically ALWAYS copy-recoverable.
I want a disksalv proggie for AFS.

Hi there all

Very cool page
the only thing I would like to see changed
is in the front page.
There , it is a mention that "we will try to announce that amos is
still alive and running"
ok it may sound picky of myself
but in my opinion this mentions make it sound like amos is dead and
we are trying to revive , in my opinion this mentionts should be
removed.
Anyway , I will send details of my project soon
and also gfx for developers.
See ya!

Just a note to the person asking about TOME. There is an update to
allow TOME to work in AMOS Pro, I had a feeling it was done by Chris
Hodges but I'm not sure. I also think that its on Mush's site.

Now my question....
All of my AMOS created programs work fine on UAE except one, Backbone.
Does anyone know what there could be about it that causes a crash in
UAE? I can only think that it is its large size and memory
consumption...

Thanks,

Challenge for AmosPro Programmers...

Thu Sep 3, 1998 12:30 am
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

I have a challenge for any AmosPro programmer, I am currently writing
an RPG based on ChronoTrigger, (I may need beta testers for it after I
sort it out propperly) and I have developed a full screen map scrolling
routine. The only problem is, its not very good: Because AMOS seems to
update screen offsets 1 vbl after screen swaps the bob updates became
unsynced so my routine has to waste a VBL to fix this problem. It also
has various other problems in it and its messy and slow.

I'd be happy if someone could write:

A map scrolling routine for 16 colour 16x16 icons in a display
288x160 32 colours (the screen can be any size)
It must be able to display 32 colour bobs.
It must be able to handel tile animation.
It must be as fast or faster then my own (mine can go at full 25fps
even with a bit of tile animation). Preferably running at 50fps based on
hardware scrolling although if you could get software scrolling at a
good speed...

I have the AmosTurbo extention, and you can use ASM procedures, DMA
etc.

If no-one wants to write one of these off the top of there heads (I
took me a while for me to sort mine out) then I could rip mine from my
sorce and post it so someone can optimise it.

I'd be greatful if someone did manage this for me ;)

See ya

Well, if you can cast your mind back to the days when the Commodore 64
ruled, you may remember a game named R.O.B.B. (Raid Over Bungling(?) Bay) -
a simple yet fun helicoptor game. The view is from above the chopper, and
it basically rotates in the centre of the screen while the ground below
scrolls beneath you (in many directions). Lots of jets trying to shoot you
down, and patrol boats, guns, etc...

I was trying to make an AMOS/Amiga version of this. Having never really
attempted to code a game before, it was quite fun and challenging. I got
the helicoptor flying about the screen, shooting stuff, and I used TOME to
scroll the background. Unfortunately, this last part failed miserably -
the scrolling was REAL slow and had some other nasty bugs. And for
whatever reason, I left this project on the back burner and have only
really gotten back to it lately - which is when I found that my version of
TOME didn't like AMOSPRO.

I'd like to give this another shot.

Yes, it appears to be quite slow, though the demos that came with my
version seemed fast enough... might be just me and my program!!

AmosTurbo huh? Sounds like it might be worth a try. How can I get hold of
THAT extention? (Just add it to my AMOS christmas list? ;)

I program for a living (hands up all those other professionals!) and play

True, I guess. I'll make a list of the programs I've written and anybody
who wants to look at them can have them!

My biggest project was a Solar System generator program (taken directly
from the old Sci-Fi RPG "Universe" - I like "computerising" things like
this.) I was going to incorporate this into some Game/Utility - but as
usual, never quite got there. Maybe one day...!

Amos to DirectX (slightly off-topic)

Wed Sep 2, 1998 2:25 am
Andy H <geosync@ozemail.com.au>


Hi all,

I don`t want to come out sounding like a smug bastard or a Microsoft
supporter, but I've been learning DirectX code and I believe it is
encouraging news for us AMOSers.
I`ve got this book 'Windows Game Programming For Dummies' by Andre
LaMothe, and it's a gem. Andre used to write Amiga games and it shows
in his code. Using DirectX w/ VC++, he has recreated much of AMOS
functionality but on a IBM platform.
I thought this DirectX stuff was going to be difficult and I found it
can be quite easy. Admittedly it's a bit of a grind to wade through
complexities of COM and methods for DirectX, but once you have read that
bit, the rest becomes a breeze.
This is starting to become a book review....Anyway my main point is,
using DirectX, us guys can get our Amiga games onto multiple platforms
with a bit of study of DirectX. I know it's defeating the purpose of
defending the Amiga and AMOS but wouldn`t you like more people to check
out your games? The new Sega console supports DirectX so you could
theoretically get you game onto that too.
FOOD FOR THOUGHT ANYHOO...
Andy H.

And while on the topic of this, MYSELF has been learning how to use
DirectX with (ugh, ) Visual Basic 5. Its acually pretty simple,
and I've started to write a little module that begins to emulate some
amos commands...

And while programming DirectX in C is fine, VB is a lot easier!!! :)

I just recently wrote the beginnings of a Compact Disc Catalogue program,
with the emphasis on it being able to write out a random access file in
alphabetic/numeric order. The user would input a name of the CD and some
other details and that data would then be inserted into the file at the
correct point.

This, I think, could be easily adapted for your Dictionary idea.

If this is at all interesting to you (or anyone else), I will post the code
to this list. It's not pretty, but it DOES work.

BOBs & bit-planes

Thu Sep 3, 1998 11:05 am
Ömer ÖZYILDIRIM <km97y019@students.itu.edu.tr>


Hi there
I have problems about bobs such as:

- Suppose I have a bob with only 1 bitplane (2 colors). How can I
get AMOS to display it with different colors on a screen with 4 bitplanes
(16 colors). That is I will use only one bob instead of 15 for all color
combinations and it will be only one bit deep instead of 4 resulting a
1/60 of the data size.

- Relating the previous problem, suppose I have a 32 color screen
& 16 color bobs. How can I get AMOS to display bobs with alternating 16
color of the palette (i.e. 0~15 and 16~31)?

These sound like to be solved with PLANE ON/OFF & PLANE PICK
parameters I found in AMIGA's font structure plus bit-shifting during the
blitting process. BUT I really don't know how to get AMOS accomplish these
tasks. May be minterms or something or an extension.

PLUS I need to combine two BOB banks during loading into a
program. Suppose I have N bob banks to be merged in my program which I
will load in pairs. Otherwise I'll have to combine the banks in the bank
editor and have N*N bob banks resulting in a bizzare size of data!


If ayone has the answers please let me know. By the way I had to
give up my AMOS 3D project due to the lack of a good obj editor or a
converter which would be an AMOS Tekken clone.

Thanks.

Guess Set Bob is the command you're looking ofr?

Ah yes! Broderbund's Bungling Empire trying to build a battleship.
A great game, watch out for those homing missiles.
Was bombing factories one of the objectives?
Shouldn't be to difficult for AMOS Pro.

Hi Everybody,

Well, I don't know exactly how you'd do it, but I've got a pritty good
idea how it'd work (I cant remember the right commands)

You'd have to set the bob mode/mask so that you could select which
bitplanes the bob should display. I think you'd have to convert it to a
16 colour bob and colour it colour 15 so that the original used all of
the bitplanes, then you could disable the ones you don't want. (I think)

What you'd have to do is create a copy of all the frames of that
bob, making a 32 colour bob that is completely colour 31 (like a mask)
and then draw that bob directly over your 16 colour bob, and set the
masking bobs bitplane to only use bit 5.

I can't remember which command to set bobs bitplanes, but I know it can
be done with no extentions (I've seen it in an old AMOS demo)

I can't help you with this one I'm afraid because I don't use Bob banks,
I've got my own system of loading bobs using IFF screens. If anyone
wants to know how then I can distribute the routines source.

I know, its crap isn't it. And if you'r thinking of tekken, foret it
with the current Amos3D as it has no real support for animation, It was
hard enough animation a simple 4 frame character.

Ok! Here it is, for what it's worth.

As I said, it's not the prettiest code in the world, but it's fairly simple
and should be adaptable.

Feel free to recode! I'd like to see what it SHOULD look like.

The program as-is is pretty small (and has much room for expansion!)

Check one of my other posts for the code.

Broderdund! Ah yes, It's all coming back to me now (it's been a while
since I saw/played it).

I agree that it shouldn't be too hard, in fact that's why I tried in the
first place (a simple enough concept that I could code). OK then, I'll do
it! But give me a couple of years... :)

And yes, bombing factories was the objective (plus bombing the destroyer
itself) - naturally, the more factories you destroyed, the more viscious
the jets got. We (my friend and I) never did take out all the factories -
but we got close!

Damn, now I want to play it again!!

The quick answer is that it makes realistic solar systems.

In "Universe" there was a complex, fairly thorough method of creating solar
systems that could be visited by the players in that RPG. First you pick a
star (type) and then determine such things as number of planets, moons for
each planet and asteroid belts. Then for each planet and moon AND asteroid
belt, you determine other things like size of the planetoid, temperature
and etc. Each planet is broken down into segments (as little as one for a
small moon through to fifty or so for big planets) and the terrain for
these segments is then determined.

What I've written is a pretty big program that does all the above plus
draws the planets (when selected) and gives some details on them. I guess
it's about 80% complete. What I wanted to do was draw continents and etc
on the planets, based on the terrain for each segment. I never could quite
work out a way to do that, though. (What is drawn is a planet with lots of
ringed segments filled with a certain terrain "picture" - the end result
doesn't look at all real, but it does convey the general nature of the
area).

Other things like civilization level, population, etc have not yet been
coded (in the game, it was up to the GM to determine such things, often
based on proximity of the solar system to Sol (the centre of of the
civilized Universe in this case).

The program (like many of my programs, in fact) needs a decent interface.
Not very user friendly, I guess. :)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I discovered the problem of samples looping forever. I got round it by using
the channel masking, so that not all 4 voices were used by the sample. I
cant remember the exact details but if you look in the Amos manual it
explains voice masks better.

You can use an extension - this ALWAYS happens with the AMOS Music Ext. What
you CAN do, however, is to do some tricks with loading it as a binary file and
then convince AMOS that it is a MED file. I can't remember exactly how, but I
have done it this way.

There definetly IS a solution to this, although I can't remember it.

I don't think it's lha. I think it's uuencoding. I was having some trouble
sending anything to a friend until I switched over to base64 encoding.

hey folks,
alot of your mail is coming to me in two parts, one a text file
and one an HTML formatted file. I use Pine for unix which will let me
view the text part but it takes a few steps and is a pain. The html file
is identical to the text file and I think some of you with HTML or WEB
based email services are getting your mail sent as both plain text and
HTML. I find it a slight hassle to deal with but not that bad, still if
you didn't realize this was happenign you may want to check the settings
on your email service.

Thanks,

That would be "Sam play <sample num>, <voice mask>" and the mask works like
%1010. Each number of the mask representing an audio channel of course :).

Thats all,

Hi,

Another big message :).... please read it, and talk about its contents.

Very well... a lot of good things are now moving.... first the new Amos
Factory site. Now AMOS has is real home! ALL the Amos world is here, news,
programs, infos and much more... a *BIG* thank you to Rune J. Keller for the
excellent site design!

We're are working hard in order to support the Amos community, but now you've
to support us! So, send us immediatelly infos about your projects! Game,
utilities, misc programs, everythings you're coding in Amos is of our (your)
interest... *The AMOS Factory projects page is waiting you!* Increase your
programs interest by publishing them on our site!!* now! *Very, very
important...

Your ICQ uin isn't listed in the developers page? Doh! Send it
immediatelly....

The main AMOS support resources are now ready and working:

- the official AMOS site - The Amos Factory (http://www.seta.it/amos/)
- the new official AMOS PD Library - (http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk)
- the new great mailing-list (Thanks Michael Cox!)
- the upcoming GNU Amos Distillery (see belove)
- AmosZine is coming back!!

But i want even more! :) There are again a lot of AMOS users who doesn't
know our site, the mailing list, the development work and so on..... we need
local support!!! So.. we've created the headquarter, now we need the local
branch of our factory :) The AMOS clubs must be opened again!

If someone is interested in this project, please contact me. I'm searching the
local coordinators for the several countries! Now you'll not be alone, but
thanks to internet you'll a member of our great family.

Other projects are under construction... now i want spent some words about
the *GNU Amos Distillery.* What is it? oh well.... this is my dream! Probably
you've heard something about the Free Software or GNU programs.... please
visit now the Free Software Foundation at http://www.fsf.org, you'll find tons
of infos about this great concept!!!

The GNU Amos Distillery will be the support site for GNU Amos projects... i
strongly belive in the Free Software power, and the site will share this power
with all the amos community!

``Free software'' refers to the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute,
study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to three
levels of freedom:

The freedom to study how the program works and adapt it to your needs.
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can share with your neighbor.
The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the
public, so that the whole community benefits.

A Free program is updated 10 time faster then a commercial one!

Several attempt to create mailing-list projects has been made in the past
period.... in the near future you'll have the oppurtunity to make them a
reality using the Free Software formula! Several famous projects are available
as Free Software.. one name: Lynux!

Please visit the Free Software Foundation site! This project will let us to
produce good quality software, and show to the other the real amos (.. and its
community) capabilities!


_*Anyway YOU are the succesfull key of our projects! without YOUR support*_
_*our efforts are vanished!*_


Phew..ok... it isn't finished :) As i want always offer a good support, visit
the Amos Factory, and soon in the download section you'll find a demo version
of the OsDevKit Extension! Many users doesn't know this powerful
extension.. this is the /demo/ version of the commercial version released some
time ago by Quartz Informatique (France). *ATTENTION:* it doens't reflect the
actual status of the extension! Now it's bigger (90k! this is 47k!), easier
and powerfull! anyway it give you a clear idea about its capabilities! Enjoy!

A little GUI Extension V2 demo program will be also available for testing....
so you can see in action some new features! ;)

LHA Trashing

Fri Sep 4, 1998 1:20 am
Andy H <geosync@ozemail.com.au>


Hi all,

On the subject of LHA's being corrupted, I have found that some servers
don`t recognize the LHA suffix and treat it as some sort of unspecific
binary file (ergo goodbye LHA). The easiest way to stop this from
happening is to archive as usual using LHA but rename it to #?.ZIP when
sending it over the Internet. Most servers respect the archive
structure of the IBM ZIP file and wont tamper with it. When the user
recieves the "fake" ZIP file they can simply rename it and unpack with
LHA.

So you want to use a 24 bit palette in AMOS? I'm afraid that isn't
supported propperly by amos at the moment. I think the only way to do
this with an AMOS screen is to ether mess around with the copper list or
find an AGA extention.

See ya.

Okay Thanx... I have some source code from someone that is pretty good... it
takes 2 16 colour screens ( 4 bit planes ) and merges them with use of a
custom copper list... But I don't actually want 2 use RRGGBB in amos I want
2 use it on a public screen... i was just wondering if any body new what
pointer 2 change 2 do this!
Thanx Bye!

Does anyone has any ideas, how to write a prog like this? (hmm looks VERY

Obviously, if tested on an accelerated Amiga the performance will be
greatly increased (ie. smaller times) and it is much shorter as well.

Hi,

did ya know? if you load "mouse.abk" from the amos-system-dir into the
spritegrabber, you can change the outlook of the three mouse-phases. just
replace them with your own favourite mouse-pix, and save that thing back into
"mouse.abk". thats all!!
now you have your own designed REAL mouse useable in your programs!!

Hey!!! I WAS BORED OKAY!!!! I didn't think ne1 would be strange enough 2
even reply... Let alone do a speed test on it!!! Now I have had 2 replys
this is getting crazy! Ne way... I had no Idea that those amos commands
existed! true I had ceen them before but i just never though about it!...
basically You can do the same thing as U have done 2 keystate commands..
which is what i do! So if I had known about those commands I would never
have bothered 2 write the code! So why is everyone so strange???????
Ne way! Have fun! and I'll be Round so if u want ne code lengthened or made
more complicated! I'm right here! BYE!
oh by the way... if u want it 2 go faster use variables instead of the 1's
it most probably wont make a difference for a single digit.. but it takes
longer 2 read in any numbers and work out there values that it does 2 read a
variable.. thats why it is faster 2 open a screen if u write
Screen open 0,640,256,16,Hires
instead of....
Screen open 0,640,256,16,32768
as Hires is an internal variable!

BYE!

don't mean to sound anal. With all your "Ne1, 2, ceen, etc.."'s... I

See ya.

Well, I've got some code that rotates+scales a picture in real time
(slow), and I have a full 3d rotating vector map complete with lense
flare (a bit slow).

If there any use to you just ask ;) (ps. when you say Isometric, do you
meen like Head over Heels / Solstice gfx?)

Exactly, right down to the -1 return value when the port buffer is
empty.

I'm playing with that right now! I haven't done any texturemapping yet,
but have worked with cage vectors and filled vectors. I'm doing that in
C, but befora that I wrote an AMOS program that rotates a beercan ;) and I
could also give you docs which helped me to write it. It is much easier
then it seems :)

Fast texturemapping(?)

Sun Sep 6, 1998 7:36 pm
SLin <samali@utu.fi>


I have an idea of using blitter to draw fast(?) plots, etc. The problem is that
I'm not so familiar with assembly, so I can't optimize it. I'm not 100% sure
that it is the fastest way ever to draw textured objects but I think it could be
!

So, if you are an assembler-coder and want to join this project, e-mail me!

So what you're looking for is the UFO game engine. Well the code I
ws talking about Im afraid is nothing like that, but you or someone
might be able to use these.

I'm afraid that I have no idea how to do isometric gfx engine.

See ya.

replying to:

Thanks for optimizing it, but you left a few bits out. Here is a working
version which will let you move about the map as well.

BTW. How are you going to use this in an isometric engine? I think
theres probably a much quicker way of rotating isometric blocks by 90
degrees. (if thats what youre doing)

See ya.

Rotating Stuff

Mon Sep 7, 1998 2:47 am
<pbrowne@qantas.com.au>


Hi again AMOS people,

In regards to those people Rotating graphics, I have just recently started
yet another little project (maybe I should just call it a "challenge", that
way if I don't actually finish it I won't be disappointed! - I can say I
satisfied the challenge rather than stopped the project).

Anyway, my challenge was to make an object made of a series of (x,y)
co-ordinates, joined together by Draw commands and then Rotate that object
about a nominated point (central to the object, naturally - or close to
it). The points (x,y)'s would be recalculated and then Draw(n) together
again.

Not quite so complex as rotating a full colour graphic object, but all I
wanted was to emulate an old Star Trek game I played once or twice MANY
years ago. It was a two player game, each player controlling a Starship
that flitted about a screen with a Star in the centre acting as a gravity
well.

It's probably been done (and easily a lot better than what I'll come up
with) - but what the heck! :)

And yes, I could just as easily draw the object in a paint program, rotate
it a few degrees many times over and make those little piccies into a
sprite... but where's the fun in that!?!

I think this is due to the fact that netscape trashed the <cr> or
something. The same thing happends to mp3 files.

There is a tool on aminet for fixing this files i think.

The easy way to do this is not to store the points in (x,y) but as
(angle from center,distance from center). Then use Sin and Cos to draw
the lines in. To convert an X,Y point you'd have to use trig. functions.
If you give me a little while then I sould be able to make a routine for

Yes, but this should be NO excuse. I use Outlook Express on my PC (and I
have for quite some time now). Even tho it's a Text/HTML mail reader, I'm
able to send my messages as text, and I think you would know WHY, too. :P

I would think that he (James) could configure his mailer (which is Hotmail,
isn't it?) to send his messages as text. When using Hotmail, you CAN do
this, as I used to use them, so I know that I'm right on this.

It is posible to split any big file to chunks of 720k using eg. NC (you can
also use rar) and transfer them to Amiga using DD disks, you can join them
using system command join (join file1 file2 file3 ... to file) or using very
easy DOpus5 join module (if you will use rar then you can use UnRAR from
AmiNet to unarchive it).

Rotating+Zooming line vectors!

Mon Sep 7, 1998 7:07 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

I've now done a program that lets you create and then load/save a
real 2d rotatable+zoomable line vector object using only AMOSTurbo
extention, which is easily converted to standard amos code. (take the F
off 'F draw', 'F plot' etc.)

(The editor is a bit crappy and you can't load into to level editor,
only after you finish in it and go into vector view mode ;)

It could do with some optimisation, but it isn't too slow, I've
included 2 example objects:

A Starship Enterprise, an XMas_Tree , a simpler Enterprise and a simple
object.

The Enterprise and XMas_Tree updates at 25fps after compilation and the
simpler ones
updates at full speed (50 fps) on my 25mhz 040 ami ;)



Please feel free to optimise/use this code in your games, but I'd like
to see the end result please ;)



See ya.

I see what you meen now.

The only way I can think of making it any faster (although it did
run at a useable speed on mine before compiling) is to re-write it in
ASM and import it into an ASM Procedure (or maybe C if you could import
that into amos).

Or you could wait for the next version of AMOS which should be
faster, and might support generating PPC code (that *would* be fast!)

See ya.

AP Libs not working on 060/PPC

Mon Sep 7, 1998 10:34 pm

Hello all...

I was wondering if anyone has problems running AMOS Pro V2 on a Cyberstorm
060/PPC. I've tried all the ones that Pietro sent to the list, some he sent
me, and the one on the AMOS Factory, but I can never expect when AMOS will
run (or if it does, when it will crash).

JOINZSPL.LHA

There are some programs to split files, one is
JoinSplit which you can use on PC and Amiga.

Don't remember where I got it, maybe Aminet.

Hey you could try an append program or an archiving facility... if Lha
doesn't do it try using zip and unzip it on the Amiga! or get a Pc
network... PC-AMIGA Cable! Sorry I can't help You any further! Unless You
have a PC Drive for your Amiga so that it can read 1.14m Disks!

I ahve a 68060/PPC604/200 and have never experienced any problems when running
AMOS. Have you by any chance just changed to CyberGraphX v3? That caused some
problems for me.

Subject: [amos-list] Fast texturemapping(?)


From: SLin <samali@utu.fi>

I have an idea of using blitter to draw fast(?) plots, etc. The problem is
that I'm not so familiar with assembly, so I can't optimize it. I'm not 100%
sure that it is the fastest way ever to draw textured objects but I think it
could be !

So, if you are an assembler-coder and want to join this project, e-mail me!

SLin


Nope I'm not really an assembler programer... i only know some... i'm more
an AMOSPro.... Pascal.... Java sort of person... but i find the best way to
learn is to see other peoples code and as i am working on a rotating project
could you send me any code you have about the texture mapping!
thanx... james!

Yes! That's what I thought (you should see all the little trig sketches on
the program listings scattered about my desk...:) I sat down to write the
routine the other day, but I had the flu and lost all motivation and went
and watched "Dune" instead (I told you I was sick!)

But feel free to write the routine yourself. What I really need is a nice
means to store the object (like and editor or something to create it).

Have fun!

Actually, no. It I left it till later on in the day to write, must just

I'll send a copy when I'm finnished.

Turbo

Tue Sep 8, 1998 2:15 am
<pbrowne@qantas.com.au>


Hi all,

Ok, time for dumb question number 47. In the short time that I've been on
this list, I've noticed a lot of talk of the Amos Turbo extention.

I figure if a lot of people use it, then it must be alright (then again, a
lot of people use IBM's with Windoze... :) But of course the Amiga
community is much more discerning. :)

So what's it all about? What can Turbo do for me and my humble Amos
programs? Is it PD? If so, can I grab a copy of it from someone. If not,
then can someone give me an email address to write to (and how much will it
cost me?)?

And please, don't tell me to go the http:\ blah blah blah, as I only have
E-mail access... sorry!

Many thanks in advance,

Phil 8-)

Personally, it's not the SIZE of the e-mail that was buggering me (I don't
care how big it is, so long as it's within a reasonable size, ie -100k?).
The HTML messages weren't really bugging me either, just everyone else. As
I said, I also use Outlook Express which will read HTML messages, I just
don't like them. I would prefer text since it's MUCH easier to read.

Btw: I've been using Outlook now for almost a year now (8 mos.) and I've
worked through it's bugs (as these Microsoft things go) and most all it's
features. If you have any trouble or need some help, just yell. Also, it
shouldn't be that difficult to configure it to send your messages as text
if you just have a look in the options ("Tools..Options/Send tab").

Yes, ever since James joined the List and started the hot topic of the week
about Isometrics, the Turbo Extension has come up a few times. :)

> I figure if a lot of people use it, then it must be alright
well, I use it some (it's quite handy). I'm not sure myself of the number
of people on this List who DO use it? Anybody care to take a count?

> But of course the Amiga community is much more discerning. :)
We know those who AREN'T discerning were the ones who defected to the PC.

> So what's it all about?
Turbo's 'dad' was the Craft Extension, which came with about 180 cmds..
Afterward, Andre (the author) release an update which is Turbo Plus. As far
as I know, it's not supported any more (not directly by Andre at least).

I'm not sure if it's 'considered' PD or not. Naturally when it was released
it wasn't, but since then this may have changed (?) I can send a copy to
you via e-mail in .DMS or .LHA form if you need. I don't see any need for
charging any fees for it, unless you want a disk version (to cover S&H).

Btw, Andy and Hakan: I'm sorry I couldn't get a copy to you guys earlier.
Do either of you still want/need a copy of Turbo..? If so, please tell me.

Yes, ever since James joined the List and started the hot topic of the week
about Isometrics, the Turbo Extension has come up a few times. :)

> I figure if a lot of people use it, then it must be alright
well, I use it some (it's quite handy). I'm not sure myself of the number
of people on this List who DO use it? Anybody care to take a count?

We know those who AREN'T discerning were the ones who defected to the PC.

> So what's it all about?
Turbo's 'dad' was the Craft Extension, which came with about 180 cmds..
Afterward, Andre (the author) release an update which is Turbo Plus. As far
as I know, it's not supported any more (not directly by Andre at least).

I'm not sure if it's 'considered' PD or not. Naturally when it was released
it wasn't, but since then this may have changed (?) I can send a copy to
you via e-mail in .DMS or .LHA form if you need. I don't see any need for
charging any fees for it, unless you want a disk version (to cover S&H).

Btw, Andy and Hakan: I'm sorry I couldn't get a copy to you guys earlier.
Do either of you still want/need a copy of Turbo..? If so, please tell me.

Could you send Turbo to me?

Subject: [amos-list] Fast texturemapping(?)


From: SLin <samali@utu.fi>

I have an idea of using blitter to draw fast(?) plots, etc. The problem is
that I'm not so familiar with assembly, so I can't optimize it. I'm not 100%
sure that it is the fastest way ever to draw textured objects but I think it
could be !

So, if you are an assembler-coder and want to join this project, e-mail me!

SLin


Nope I'm not really an assembler programer... i only know some... i'm more
an AMOSPro.... Pascal.... Java sort of person... but i find the best way to
learn is to see other peoples code and as i am working on a rotating project
could you send me any code you have about the texture mapping!
thanx... james!

Actually, I haven't got any code to draw texture-mapped objects, but I do have
an idea (and a piece of bad code) of drawing points and textured vertical lines
using blitter. When optimized these routines should kick ass (at least in
theory) and could be easily used in any stuff from zoomers to texture mapping!
I can't explain it to you shortly because all is based on a different screen
structure. I am really hopeless 'cause I think this idea could be big but I
can't write it:-(
I NEED A GOOD ASSEMBLER-CODER!!!

Hey I can send u a copy as well if u like but it sounds like Adam here has
a better version... but i got mine off the net so my version doesn't need
any charge! Ps I use Turbo a lot as I prefer graphics programming and the
one thing amos needs if faster graphics... especially when handling 256
colours
although i don't know how to use commands on screens other than amos... it
all helps!

Yes but it doesn't free the memory and other sources allocated by

Hi there Steve,

Err....to be honest, I don't think it'd be worth the
hassle!!!

As much as I loved Az and working on it and with you and the
guys, I don't think the Amiga/Amos market would pay for a
disk mag anymore! They get all the help on The Amos List ya
see!

Remember when Az was doing the rounds? Remember that everyone
on the Amos List didn't buy it? Well...no wonder...help was
at hand 24 hours a day on the list etc!

In saying that, they don't know what they missed coz Az was a
firkin' shit hot magazine,

But if you think it's worth doing another mag...go ahead...

I don't think I'd have the time though :(

Sorry m8, but I will at least do anything I can to help you
out. Let me know your decision....

Tarra...

Hey there... this prog i have just dug up from my amos drawers tints an
image using bobs!
Using the Plane control in the command....
Bob bob#,background,Planes,Miniterm...
By only changing the bits on a certian Bitplane of a screen you can produce
a tint effect if your palette is set up properley...
You should set up the palette like so....
colours 00 - 07 is the normal palette of the image...
colours 08 - 15 is all the above 00 - 07 colours tinted to a colour... say
blue!
colours 16 - 23 is the 00 - 07 colours tinted another colour.... say red!
colours 24 - 32 is the 00 - 07 colours tinted a mix between blue and red..
purple!

Just if you didn't know! Sorry if you already new that but there are people
out there that don't and I know how annoying it is to not know how to do
something!

See ya.

You can't use *REAL *Virtual memory without an MMU in you processor,
and even if you do, you can't control it in amos propperly. If you set
up your system for virtual memory then AMOS should be able to use it. Of
corce, you don't have to use real vmem. You can buffer things on disk
from your AMOS program as much as you like, that would cover for virtual
memory fine.

Hi Everybody,

Now my vector drawing program runs all my shapes at 50fps on a
lowres 2 colour screen when compiled. its still quite slow, but it does
work quite well. (might make a game with it when I've sorted out my RPG
engine)


See ya.

uhm, although I havnt done TextureMapping before, I know how to do it
and if you come up with any probs feel free to ask, but I dont have much
time on my hands these days - so if your looking for someone to write a
tmapping routine for you in 68k and just plug it into amos, I dont have
the time to do that as TGE is my MAIN priority, BUT if you like....

If you send me decent amos code with a super slow tmapper I'll
convert it into 68k, however your code must work first.
Also, Im stuck for time these days, I'll need 2 weeks
(max) to convert it.

By 'Decent' AMOS code, I mean *NOT* spagetti code!!!
Goto's i dont mind, but NOTHING even NEARLY like:

A: .....
goto F

B: .....
if x then goto C
gosub E
goto D

C: ....
if y then gosub E
goto A

D: ....
if q or p or r then goto B
goto F

E: .....
if abc<>def then goto C
if def<>x+y then goto D
return

F: gosub E
goto D


I think you get the point ;}
no mumbo jumbo stuff!!!!

no,
and you'ld be best not to try ;}
the reason for using memory is RAM is MUCH MUCH MUCH faster
than reading off HD. IF you want to minamize the ram usage
you should load things as you need them, and the second your
about to load something else free all the other things in mem
or as many as possible!

Hey I'm almost insulted! LOL! Yes that would be good thanx but i don't know
if my prog is atually a proper texturemapper... what it does is it turns an
over head view to an isometic view that rotates! To gain speed it has a sort
of Fake Chunky system! LOL! Not really all it does is instead of ploting
single pixels it uses blocks... okay so its not great detail but all i want
it for is walls and floors of an isometric RPG!

Thank you very much!
I try and optimize my code so i know what slows and speeds code... and your
example would be slow! Anyway the code is only about 20 lines long and the
equation is 4 lines! so not much room for sloppy programing! although i may
stand corrected if it is sloppy and I'm just a bad programmer!

Bye! Phil!

So could you explain to me how you are supposed to send an Amos Prog that
has banks.... even if i seperated the prog from the banks and sent the
amosprog as asc. the rest would still have to be attached?
Sorry! I will try but i don't C how? or Why? I do send any progs that are
just code as asc. thought!
Apart from the reason that all these messages get compiled and the attached
files wont be included I don't C Why? can you not recieve attachments? If
you use Hotmail... Hotmail seems to have a problem with attachments!

Okay is there any one else out there who wants to say something about how i
send my mail, coz if there is I'd like to get it over and done with?

James!

Well, I haven't talked personally with Mush for quite awhile now but from
what I heard recently he's been busy setting up a 'massive PD empire' <G>
with a few networked Amiga's running thru his PC on 2 56k lines as a
backbone. As for whatever else?, I'm not sure.. Anyhow, this is probably
why you haven't been able to logon to his FTP server.

In future dont be so impatient, send the code if someone wants it and that
means sending it so them directly and not this list.

Thanks

Well, if you do this, send me a copy! I've been looking at ways to speed up
my CBATNAM level, as it's not been so much the maths that are slow but the
grahpics bandwidth that's sucking up the CPU (all those darn colors).

I've got a copy of a perfect, albeit slow, tmapper on my AMOS Productivity
Disks which you should also have. If you don't, tell me and I'll send it to
you. I'd convert it myself (and may still) but just like you, I don't have
time, and also I'm just getting into Asm (I have yet to do any gfx).

Also, for any of you other guys who might need help on Texture mapping,
I've got several demos I can send you. I've also had some experience
working with the concept so I might be able to give a few pointers.

In the reply to Adam Parrott about Turbo extention, the most important
question got dropped. What's it all about. There was a mention of 180
commands, but what kind of commands. Is it mostly graphics stuff, or a
wide range of commands. Also what are the main features of it. Is it
twice as fast, or simpler to use because of commands that make coding
easier, like maybe rotate/flip/distort etc... commands.

Hi!

uhm, although I havnt done TextureMapping before, I know how to do it
and if you come up with any probs feel free to ask, but I dont have much
time on my hands these days - so if your looking for someone to write a
tmapping routine for you in 68k and just plug it into amos, I dont have
the time to do that as TGE is my MAIN priority, BUT if you like....

If you send me decent amos code with a super slow tmapper I'll
convert it into 68k, however your code must work first.
Also, Im stuck for time these days, I'll need 2 weeks
(max) to convert it.

Ok, one more try:
1) I DON'T want any texture mapping -engine. I have an idea of fast drawing
routines which could help when DOING tmapping, scaling, etc.
2) I only want someone write to me an optimized line-drawing routine (I have
used a "simpleline" code from "Hardware Ref. Manual" and it is too slow) and
maybe a special screen opening routine ( I have an amos-code of that). If you
want to help me, I'll gladly explain more.

I have a compiled game that I wrote a couple of years ago. Since getting an
accelerator, parts of it run too fast. I now know how to fix that problem.
However I cant find the source for it. It must have been lost during hard
disk problems.
Is it possible to decompile Amos progs?

It`s Ok dude, I have had mmajor 2nd thinks. In fact I was hoping you
wouldn`t be interested. I just all excited in the letter.
What I did was read al l the old AZ`s and realized what a brilliant job
we had all done, it really was the best ever amos mag without a doubt
and I have read them all.

>But if you think it's worth doing another mag...go ahead...
>I don't think I'd have the time though :(
I reckon I could start it again but as I said, na fuck it. Anyway apart
from the dozen or so regulars who got it free we never got any real
support money wise did we, fucking thanks you get on the Amiga innit! if
we were doing it for Vis Basic on the PC we would of been rich I reckon.

I know you are pink moist and fluffy like that, but don`y worry, let`s

Any news on OC task V4.x? This is really important to me,
It will run Win 311/95 prob v slowly but I need acess to MS Word,
desperately amongst other things, I have win311 on floppy and just got
it on my HD if you want I can lzx it onto about 14 amiga disks.

I am about to go public with my very first paper based magazine and all
the fikles were done on a PC which I don`t now have, so I am fucked.
I`ll tell you jmore in a letter or next e-mail.

See ya m8

Good idea, but making a copy of all frames with color 31 is
neither easier, nor less memory consuming than making a copy with new
colors. But the previous idea was good really.

No matter! I'm planning to write the animation system myself. What
I only need is to display a 3D obj. fast enough & without going into
details of the projection equations or algorithms. Of course an easy
way to create a 3D object too. By the way is there a replacement extension
to 3D ext.?

Thanks in advance.

In YAM 2, display raw format shows that it is supposed to be Base64 encoded.
The message was sent via a MS proggy, so I guess that explains it :)

mega error with limit bob!

Wed Sep 9, 1998 3:45 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

I have found a /very/ odd problem using limit bob!

if you limit a screen area with these rough proportions:

Limit bob 160,0 to 320,100

then it clames to be an 'illegal function call'.


Does any one know why this is, and is there a way around it?

I hope that someone could help me with this because it's
buggering up one of my games engine!


See ya.

No it isn't possible :(. Not back to AMOS sourcecode anyway.
The only program which claims that it can decompile AMOS
programs is actually a virus.

Does the command use hardware coordinates? if so, you would need something
like

Limit Bob 288,50 To 447,150

Nop, it doesn't and theres no reason why Limit bob 160,0 to 320,100
fails. Have you tried it on your copy of amos/ could my copy have a
bug in it?

Interlace Bug.

Thu Sep 10, 1998 12:10 am
<pbrowne@qantas.com.au>


Hi again!

Here's a problem I've had so long now that I've forgotten about it (I tend
to work around it or just ignore it) - but seeing how as I now have contact
with many wise AMOS/Amigans, I thought I'd ask for some advice.

The problem is with AMOS and Interlaced screens plus the addition of a
Spectrum/Holobyte graphics card on my A3000.

Before the card, all was fine and dandy. Once the card was installed, the
screens "lost" their "lacing" (now look like blocky lowres screens).

Is this a familiar problem to anyone else?

I seem to remember reading (long ago) that AMOS didn't like (or display)
interlace screens, but introduced it just to prove it could! (and because
people wanted it).

Thanks for any wisdom you can pass on...

Phil 8-)

Well, I tried the code that you did supply... and I gotta say, I'm damn
impressed!

I don't normally praise anyone else's code (no one praises mine, so why
make a fool of myself?) but your's was enough to make me break with
tradition!

My only question for you is the editor - why the "snap-to-grid" like
functionality? Easier to code or use?

I can't use my AMOS, so this is going without a manual, or a test.

Maybe you have to keep the limit within actual screen coords. I'm not sure
but 320 actually be off the screen on a 320x200 screen, so try 319 instead.

Hello,

This problem also happens when an interlace screen is shown on a Scan
Doubler set-up (usually when an Amiga used a VGA monitor). It`s ugly
and not very nice :)

Try 8 pixel boundaries ie 160,0 to 320,96 or 160,0 to 320,102.

A simple ASCII source attachment for the snow demo. I mailed this

I while ago a version of Amos pro was given away on an Amiga Format
cover disk. If any one had that version (like me, but i've installed
stuff like compiler) then that would be freely distributable (i think)

I've tried every thing, but I've come up with a solution:

Instead of opening a 640x400 I'll open a 640x512 and move all gfx. opps.
down by 112 pixles. Down the bottom part Limit bob works perfectly. (!?)

Thanks, Its the first time I've done vector work. The grid in the
editor is to make shapes easier to draw. If you don't like it then you
can adjust it/turn it off with + and - (I can't remember whether I put
those instructions into the sorce).

Anyway, it could still do with improvements - the conversion isn't
100% accurate and sometimes I've seen lines overlap strangely. Its also
a little slow (probably bacause of slow line commands, although
AMOSTurbo shouldn't be that slow.)

Now I hope you can make a decent game with em. You could try doing a
version for filled shapes (using polygon) and write a game like
'Bratwust' (is it called that? I can't remember! ;)

Happy programing ;)

See ya.

If ya come up with any asm probs, let me know!
I can give you 'Amiga Hardware bashing Manuals'
aswell, which make you achieve ultimate speed,
but no compatibility on gfxcards ppc or anything!

Theres no Tmapper on my productivity disks!!!!!
but there is one on the compiler extras disk ;oP
its quite fast, but before I cocnvert it I wanna
check to see if this routine would be ok for that
other guy ?

I think its fast enough, as in 68k it will rocket
and you could achive good speeds with it in games.

Ok, I'll send you a copy of the Tmapper, and I might(notice MIGHT)
through it in TGE too ;oP

PS: I replaced the Cos&Sin in the example Tmapper to use the TGEsin&cos,
it took 1079 vbls with amos, and 836VBls with TGE ;oP
(That WAS through the interpreter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

theres no need to do that, I wont be converting your code THAT directly,

AMOSPro *is not* yet a PD product..... the AMOSPro installed on your HD is a
commercial *copyrighted* product, and *you can't* spread it! It's illegal...
in
the deal with Lionet and Europress i've obtained the sources (with a Non
Disclosure Agreement, so the sources will never be released to the public!)
and the
permission to upgrade and distribute AMOS for *non-profit* reasons.

When in December i'll release my reworked version, AMOS (my version, not the
EuroPress one!) will be PD and freely distributable. The complete AMOSPro and
Compiler package will be available for free download on the Amos Factory site.

*The EuroPress AMOSPro package is not a PD product!! Don't spread it!*

Yeah, the mag was great and anyone who missed out on it,
should go and check it out (if F1 are still selling it of
course!).

Mostly three disks with articles and LHA archives of planty
of source code - much of it exclusive to Amoszine too :)

But this is turning into a review :)

Ahem! Well, I have never used VB at all. I still usse Amos
and the Amiga and I'm happy with that. Sure, we all wanna
make money, but if that was the case, then sure I would
probably have taught myself another langauge on another
platform by now.

For me though, Amos and the Amiga is a great hobby which I
really enjoy (when i find the time of course).

Maybe with the AmigaNG, and AmosNG, we may all get a chance
at some money making :)

> Any news on OC task V4.x? This is really important to me,

Erm, dunno if that was aimed at me or not and to be honest, I
think you are lost yourself! I dunno what OC V4 is!!!

Maybe someone on this list knows....

If so, can ya help Steve out with a demo copy or summat?

Why do I want Windoze on my Amiga? Nah thanx! Anyway, I have
a Wondows 95 CD Rom here gathering dust! By the time i could
afford a PC to use it, Windoze 98 will be ready for binning
and Windoze 2K will be ready for installing and f*cking up
peeps PC's ;-)

Well? I'm interested in reading this and getting involved
maybe too. Sorry to hear you are f*cked though! Then again,
tht's what happens when ya move to the PC and return to the
Amiga! It isn't the done thing! You should never have left in
the 1st place ;D

Yeah, please do, but I bet everyone on this list is
interested in your mag now! Please keep us all updated on the
progress Steve and nice to see ya back with the Amiga and
hopefully Amos also :)

Then you have two options:

2. direct access to the hardware.
This is a non system friendly way, but works with the Classic range of

If you interested, i can send you my proggy, which access an external

Sound sample

Hi

Has anyone got a sound sample they would be prepared to let me have? I don't
care whether it is in raw or Amos bank format, only so long as there is no
copyright or other impediment to it.

I am writing a silly game for someone and want to play them a brief fanfare
(trumpets or full orchestra, etc) at the successful conclusion of each level.
I've found almost all the other sound samples I wanted among PD stuff, but the
fanfare has eluded me so far.

I haven't noticed any overlap problems, and the speed (on my A3000, at
least) is more than adequete, especially considering that I don't have
AMOS-Turbo (nobody has gotten around to sending me it...*sob* :()
But as I said, I haven't really given it a GOOD test. Even try it an my
old A500 perhaps.

Which version of Turbo is this?

Eh? I thought you were offering Turbo!?! Why do you want it
if you have it? Guess you were sleepy when ya typed that :-)

> SLin

Sure, gimme info on which version of Turbo you have
please....

Anyone looking for Craft, I'm sure Epic still sell it. I have
the original with box and manual and to be honest, Craft
isn't that much used. Well, it used to be mainly for it's
updated PTracker commands, but even that is dated now :(

Still, Craft is nice to own :)

So what's Turbo? I'm sure I used to have it, but never
bothered with it to be honest. Wasn't there a couple of
different versions?

Great speed increases, Pete. TGE is living up to expectations then?

It's on the productivity disks. Only the lib in apsystem needs to be replaced.

The name 'Turbo' has been abbreviated lately. You should know it better by
'Turbo Plus', the successor to the Craft Extension. I don't think there had
been any diff. versions (except a few rev's to Turbo itself) since Craft.

Thanks, but I did happen to pull off most of the RKM's

Sorry, my mistake. The tmapper sHOULD be on the Compiler disks, not the
Productivity ones (when you have all those disks in one dir on your HD, it
get's a little confusing, especially when you haven't looked for them in
ages). But sure, go ahead and see if it'll work on their routines first.

Sounds great. Anything faster may help future development.

Coolness! Send 'em here when you're done! :D

Hm.. well, as Giark pointed out, we can't the TGE and GMS combo in CBATNAM,
and since I may implement this routine in the Dungeon.. you know. So,
before you send the source, replace all your TGE Cos/Sin maths with plain
ol' AMOS maths and I'll find something just as fast for them (Turbo/AMCAF?)

I'm not sure about it being interesting to EVERYONE, but I wrote a little
demo-type program that makes use of the Vu meters. What you've got is a
four sided polygon floating randomly about a screen, but each corner jerks
with addition gusto in proportion to a selected sound channel. All to the
sounds of "Smoke on the water"...

Sounds weird? Funny, I called it WEIRD.Amos !

If you haven`t already done so copy C3D.LIB into the same directory the
WB executable resides.
Also try compiling to include the AMOS.LIB.

hehe :) I've found the bug... i've never noticed it in 7 years!! :)
I've fixed it immediately, and you'll find the update on the Amos Factory site
as
usual ;) Just a moment....

I take the oppurtunity to remember that the Official Amos HomePage address is:

http://www.seta.it/amos/


I've to say that the example program supplied by Andrew Crow is bugged too :),
since he doesn't use the Limit Bob command correctly. i.e:

_CUT_

/Limit Bob 320,0 To 639,200/
/Print " Now if we put a bob on you see it doesn't work!";/
/Box 320,0 To 639,200/
/Bob 1,280,180,1/

Yes is true... it doesn't work, but it's correct! Only the bobs present on the
screen *BEFORE* the limit bob command will be effected. If you put a bob on
the
screen after limit bob it doesn't work. RTFM! :))))


/Print "but if we call different Limit bobs they works fine";/
/Limit Bob 0,0 To 320,200/
/Wait 50/
/Limit Bob 0,200 To 320,400/
/Wait 50/
/Limit Bob 320,200 To 640,400/

Now it works because the bob is already present on the screen......


/Print "But now if we call the original function with the bob"/
/Print "on then it bombs out with 'illegal function call'! "/
/Print /
/Print "Does this happen on your copy? does anyone know why"/
/Print "It gives that error when trying to limit a bob to the upper"/
/Print "Left corner?"/
//
/Limit Bob 320,0 To 640,200/


well... this is a Amos bug! :) There is (was) a stupid bug in the coordinates
check routine...

Limit Bob x,y To x1,y1

if the x coord is greater than the y1 coord, you'll get a 'illegal function
call'
:)) Now fixed.... remember that the x and x1 coords will be rounded up to the
nearest 16-pixels boundary.


Enjoy!

Hey! Sorry! I was just a little pissed off that day.... Girlfriend trouble!
Sorry! For moaning at you.....

| BASIC programmers never die, they GOSUB and don't RETURN. |

Thankyou for your advice!
Cool! nice message! Hey.... You see I'm new to this list... but i'm not new
to amos or the Amiga.... So i do know how computers work! Sorry it's just i
get really annoyed coz I think i'm quite good at programming its just no one
who i know appriciates that so I have no-one to exchange ideas or show progs
to, and it just seems all my work just goes to waste as i am not organised
enough to get something ready for release!!! I just wanted to see what
people thought! Oh and you are very right.... I am using a DREADED PC! and
i'm sorry... just wait till i get my own phone line and an amiga modem!
I promise my mailer is saying i'm sending this mail in text but my trust for
pC's is about as long as the buglist for windows! I appoligize 2 any one out
there who recieved a very large file.... i guess i didn't think about other
people!
From no one i will send it directly.... but could you tell me how to upload
to the aminet? As i said i'm new to this side of the net!

"If you don't gosub a program loop.... you'll never get a subroutine!"

Hey! I've just started at a college... and its REALLY Annoying that we have
to use Pc's for the computing course... i'm going to see if i can use my
AMIGA for any part of it! Hey and guess what I have 2 Learn PASCAL.... Hmmm!
What a GREAT language!!!!!

Ps... I do know how Amos works... I've been studying how Amos saves progs
out... but I haven't got very far... does anyone have a piece of code in
amos to convert an asc file to amos code from amos!

SORRY!

Bye!

The above is the list of people who have asked me for a copy of Turbo Plus.
At present, these are the only people who are going to get it from me (if
you asked me for it, I should have seen your message by now!). If you want
a copy, you'll have to mail me and I'll get it to you later.

|Note|: These files are copies of the original coverdisks from CU Amiga. I
CANNOT and WILL NOT be held responsible for any of you using or accepting
the copies of Turbo Plus you are being sent. You use them at YOUR risk, and
in using them you consent to releasing me from any legal issues that I
would otherwise be held responible for. (In other words, I'm offering them
as PD for free, and since CU just died I don't think that they would mind
me giving these away. If you have any problems, take it up with them).

PS: If your name is mentioned above and you are reading this but have not
received your Turbo Plus yet, please be patient. All copies are being sent
out immediately after I finish sending off this message. ALSO: All copies
are BEING SENT to the e-mail addresses listed with your name above. If you
wish it sent to another address, then you should have told me. :)

IMPERATOR FAQ

Sat Sep 12, 1998 2:30 pm
Bernie Noel <bnoel@club-internet.fr>


Hi listers,

_Dozens_ of people have been sending me remarks and questions about IMPERATOR,
apparently one of the most popular games ever made in AMOS!

First thing I wish to say is: Thanks to all of you! Keep sending 'em in, as
such feedback is vital in the process of enhancing a product and briging it
closer to the user's wishes. You are the makers of Imperator 2!

Here are answers to the most Frequently Asked Questions on IMPERATOR:

/Q: Is Imperator commercial or shareware?/

A: Imperator is a commercial game. It will be published by Epic Marketing and
will come at least in English and German. Epic plan to release it at the
Cologne fair (13-15. November).
The demo you found on AmigaFlame states that the game is shareware, but this
is no longer true. Only the French version is still shareware and I have the
right to distribute it myself.

/Q: Was Imperator actually made using AMOS?/

A: Absolutely. It was entirely written in AMOSPro2, with a hint of Turbo and
Craft. (The gfx were made with PPaint)

/Q: Has the game been reviewed by magazines yet?/

A: Apart from France, where it got 2 enthusiastic reviews, not yet - to the
best of my knowledge. You can read the preview on AmigaFlame, or... send me
questions! Epic Marketing are in charge of the communication process and they
plan to have the game reviewed in every Amiga mag in the World.

/Q: Any differences between the shareware and commercial versions?/

A: The major difference is the music. It has been rewritten by Ruben Monteiro,
probably the greatest musician on the Amiga scene. (He volunteered to write
the music and you bet I accepted his offer :-) )
The dialogues (in English) have been rewritten by John Girvin.
There are a few other cosmetic differences.

/Q: Why are the Barbaric opponents so stupid?/

A: Because they are so superior in terms of brute force, they can't be made
too clever, otherwise the game would be downright unplayable. Anyway most of
your enemies in the full game are much tougher than the ones in the demo.

/Q: Is Imperator playable by modem?/

A: That could make sense for the tactical part (the battles) but it wouldn't
for the strategy. However, I'm considering the option of making a standalone
battle-module that would be playable by modem. _If_ that idea gets enough
support.

/Q: What about AGA gfx for Imperator?/

A: I have yet to find an AMOS extension that handles AGA completely and
without bugs... Any suggestions?


*Imperator (preview and demo) on AmigaFlame:*

AMOS page...

Sat Sep 12, 1998 5:23 pm
"Garfield Benjamin" <gbenjam@sosbbs.com>


Hello. I notice we have several new people on the list, so just thought
I'd give the URL for my AMOS page:
http://www.sosbbs.com/~gbenjam/AMOS.HTM

It hasn't been updated since spring and there isn't much there, but if
you need a good development tool for grabbing bobs/sprites/icons,
then you'll definitely want to check out the AutoImageGrabber.
This utility will scan an .IFF picture and automatically grab the
images and store them in the appropriate bank. It's easy, fast and
effective... (72k .LHA file)

Anyway, I think there is also a very simple source for reading the
mouse directly through hardware and a bit of reading...

Actually, I have tons of old source, utilities, games, etc. and some
day I might put them on my page. :)

"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


I made a slight mistake after I sent out the copies of Turbo Plus to those
who had asked for it (this was pointed out to me by Giark): NO DOCS! I
forgot that there are no electronic docs on any of the disks and the docs I
had were photocopies of the manual that Chris (Evans) sent to me (oops).

To solve this problem, I'm going to scan all the pages of the manual and
save them off as images (.jpg, .bmp, etc.), .zip them, and send them to
everyone. If you guys want this, tell me and I'll get it to you as soon as
it's done. Please specify the image format you want the pages to be in too.

(Btw, I believe Johnny (Bintz) and Hendrik Andreasen also asked me for a
copy of Turbo Plus. I'll get both of these to you guys as soon as I can.)

I tried to convince Jens of doing it for the AMOS Factory page, but he seemed
to get lost? No more internet, Jens? I will probably add the extensions
myself, if he doesn't show up soon.

In the techno Sound manual it explanes how to make a sampling prog. I
tried doing one in amos, but its crap - if you try recording it to
doesn't record propperly at all (must be amos' slow Peek/Poke speed). If
you put the output to lines you get a nice ocillascope effect though!

I can post a copy if you want.


See ya.

I've spoken to him, and the intuition ectension is discontinued.

The latest version is Free Ware but its full of bugs. (more then the
last version)

get him to change his mind then thats who you speek to.

You know, I thought I tried everything (and I'm sure I DID) - except puting
the above LIB in the same directory as the executable (I'd have thought
just having it in LIBS: would work, but no-ooooo...)

Now everything works fine!

Thanks again!

A note: I just sent out the second 'shipment' of Turbo Plus disks. So far
this makes: Giark, Garfield, Johnny (Bintz), Omer, Hakan, Hendrik
Andreasen, Phil Browne, Andy Hawkins, and Sasu Lintula. Anyone else? :)

Also, it seems that everyone who requested the doc's asked for .jpg, so
.jpg it is then! (thanks for making my job a bit easier!) :) I'll get them
scanned and sent to everyone as soon as I can. Btw, Garfield: You asked for
some step-by-step install instructions? hehe, you can't without the docs!
Rest assured, all the [easy] install instructions are in the docs.

To throw my bit in, could you add a two columns to your listing:
Contact - who to contact for info, registration, etc.
Location - where to find the extension (aminet, mush's, amos page, etc.)

And maybe a brief line about the main use of the extension.

Well no, I -meant- Turbo, I just phrased it wrong. I meant that all the
install instructions are in the doc's, but as with ANY Extension, you don't
really NEED any docs, just the slot number (which is 12, yes). :P

Just wanted to thank everyone who wished me happy birthday. Cheers!

Btw, on the Turbo docs, I also wanted to thank everyone for being patient
(me being a busy student and all, not having much time.. hehe). Chris
(Kossa) had an idea of posting them up on a site for everyone to
view/download. I've decided to go with this, and although my site hasn't
been updated for months, I -will- be posting it there. If anyone else wants
to grab it and post it elsewhere for tute purposes (maybe Amos Factory?),
then feel free to do so, but I'm not liable for anything you do to it. :)

When I have the manual all scanned and ready, I'll mail the List with the
URL. Until then, try to figure out the commands from those exmaples! :D

Yeah, well it doesn't get any better... (time that is). ;)

Sounds like a great idea... no hurry for me at least as I won't be
installing the extension until later this week or weekend.


> Until then, try to figure out the commands from those examples! :D

Well, as long as it installs fine then I'm sure it will be no problem
sorting out the commands from the examples.

BTW- Thanks for sending it (and so quickly)!! :-)

LDOS - Arexx

Wed Sep 16, 1998 8:55 am
"Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>


Greetings,
I am trying to convert the following Arexx script to work with AMOS Pro
using the LDOS extension.

/*In OctaMED, switch Midi On*/
address octamed_rexx
op_set midiactive on

I have tested this script and it works fine when run from the CLI. My
conversion into AMOS Pro, using the LDOS extension, is as follows.

HOST$="OCTAMED_REXX"+Chr$(0)
MESSAGE$="op_set midiactive on"+Chr$(0)

FAIL=Arexx Exist(HOST$)
If FAIL=0
Print "Port cannot be found":End
End If

Print "OCTAMED_REXX is available."

MSG$=Lrexx Send Msg(HOST$,MESSAGE$,0)


AMOS does recognise the OctaMED arexx port but does not seem to send the
command. I have tried typing the command various different ways but nothing
seems to work. Can anyone help?

Declan.

p.s.
You have no idea what this would do to my current project if I got it
working......

Look in your manual for Amos Pro. It is located at the last like 50 pages or
so.

Turbo Plus news.

Wed Sep 16, 1998 11:26 pm
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


Well, after a little learning and a few suggestions, I've decided on a few
things regarding Turbo Plus, it's distribution, and the doc's. ReAd oN:

1. Although my site (Parrottsoft) hasn't been finished yet, I have pretty
much decided on the final 'design', or layout if you will, for it.
Therefore, I've pretty much decided to put up the main section first, and
then the other areas will come after. This being the case, I'll make an
area in the -Downloads- section for Turbo Plus AND the docs. You can
download and distribute the disks (.DMS) -AND- the docs all you want!

2. To those who haven't gotten, didn't get, or still want Turbo Plus, I'll
still send it to you if you want, but it'll be MUCH easier for you to wait
a bit longer and go download everything off the site. I may even setup an
area for you to read the doc's on-line as well (another convenience).

BTW: Anyone that -does- download the disks and plans to distribute them
from their site, please tell me or Rune (Amos Factory) so we'll know. :)
..I think this should cover it. Just awhile more on those docs. :D

Change Mouse M

Thu Sep 17, 1998 3:10 am
Jeff Coney <coney@socs.murdoch.edu.au>


I can't get the instruction CHANGE MOUSE M to work properly.

Setting M to values from 1 to 3 invokes in turn the three mouse pointers
provided as standard. However, the manual states that setting M equal to
values larger than 3 also allows the pointer to assume the form of an image
from the sprite bank. The image is indexed by i=M-3. Thus, setting M=4
will result in the mouse pointer being taken from Image 1 in the sprite
bank, for example.

This does not work.

Can anyone help??

Jeff

This is probably because the sprite which you want to use must a) only have 4
colours and 2) only be 16 pixels wide.

I invalidated my hard drive EVERY DAY with FFS, AFS, well, it's twice a
year, and you can almost always get yer files back quickly. Trouble is,
when it breaks, it breaks hard. Quarterback won't back it up at the mo.
In a few days (next time I see my friend with a few spare gig on the drive)
I'll be copying the whole partition over, reformat, and back again.

Interesting. Not familiar with that proggie. I never got on well with ffs.
Slow, nasty. At the mo, I have some of my drives AFS, and some FFS. It works,
and I hardly ever (twice a year !) get problems with any of the drives, and
I have an almost complete backup on other partitions. Unfortunately, the backup
suddenly failed for no good reason this time (it says the archive is corrupt
when it validates it) so I'm stuck with the data in the mess it is. At least
I bypassed the problem. AFS has the lovely :.deldir, and the lovely
removedirentry program, which are lifesavers.

FFS really did invalidate like every day. I was spending two hours loading the
machine on a regular basis, and running disksalv (or qbtools) every week or so
for a day and a half. AFS really helps.

I'd say FFS is more software recoverable, and MUCH more prone to problems, but
AFS has fewer problems, and the data is practically ALWAYS copy-recoverable.
I want a disksalv proggie for AFS.

In order for the instruction CHANGE MOUSE to work , you sprite/bob must be
defined as 4 colour (2 plane) bob. I had this problem for years. Id only use 2
or 3 coluors in my bobs, but they were defined as 16 colour(4 plane) bobs.
Check your bobs, that`ll be your problem !

What were you running on your amiga that made it devalidate so often?

I only use FFS and I only get devalidated once in a while (usually after
something crashes or somin')

I think the easiest way to avoid devalidation is to find which programs
are crashing it and replace them for ones that work propperly;)

And a program like MultiReset helps too, it writes the bitmap *and* can
show a little pic and play a sound when you reset :)

See ya.

for quite a while now though.

Load images

Fri Sep 18, 1998 8:56 am
"floquet" <floquet@hp-sc.univ-lille2.fr>


Hello everybody,

I would like to know how to do to load images, as fast as possible.
No matter the time it will take to create and save the pix, I want
the fastest load. No matter either the size of the file(s), the
images will be loaded from hard disk or DCrom.
I'm trying to simulate video sequences in a game, the only way I know
is "Load Iff" in a loop, but it is sllloooooowwwww (about 3 frames/sec)
because -I guess- of the IFF compression. I use 320x200x16 pix.

Anybody has a solution, something like a RAW load ?

I have had a Microvitec Multisync monitor with my 1200 for about 3 years. It
dynamically autoswitches resolution. The cost is somewhere in the region
you mention. I am at work writing this but If you like I will have a look in
Amiga Format for a supplier & a price.
I originally used Commodores Euro72 or Multiscan Productivity modes with
this monitor, but I was a little disappointed to discover that the display
left a grey strip on either side. My monitor has vertical but no horizontal
adjustment so I was unable to do anything about it.. To minimise the effect
I used 'Neagrey' in the startup sequence, this just clears the unused
display to black, which looked a lot better. However, I recently found a new
version of Super72 display driver, (mail me for a copy) which I use in
hi-res laced 800x600 with excellent results. The screen is now fully filled.

I have seen adverts for scan doublers which claim to allow you to use
cheaper PC monitors. I don't know all the pros & cons of these, perhaps
someone else on the list can comment.
Regards.
Neil Ives.

This usually happens if you save a picture with a stencil. If this was the
case, load it in you drawing program and switch off the stencil and save it
agian.

Turbo Plus Questions.

Sat Sep 19, 1998 3:38 am
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


Someone asked me (sorry, I forget who atm) what Turbo Plus IS and what type
of commands it offers. I thought I would breifly answer: Turbo Plus,
successor to the Craft Extension, is basically a set of 'turbo' commands:

Graphical (which makes up the bulk of it)..
3D Drawing, Zones, Starfields, Vector Objects,
Blocks, Icons, Scrolling, Scenes, and Bitplane;

Also many Miscellaneous and Bitwise Operations.
Comes complete with Scene Editor and IFF Font maker.

It features commands such as:

F Plot, =F Point, F Draw, F Draw To, F Circle, R Home, R Bar, Blit Clear;
Set Planes, Plane Offset, Plane Swap, Plane Shift Up/Down, Plane Update;
Reserve Stars, Define Star, Display Stars, Stars Draw, Stars Speed/Erase;
Scene Load, Scene Convert, Scene Copy, Scene Fill, Scene Bank, etc.;
Bilt Int On, Blit Int Off, Blit Int Wait, Blit Int Change and MANY more.

As I have reported, I am working on getting the docs scanned and saved off
into .jpg format. I've also been talking with Rune (webmaster of the Amos
Factory) into getting the coverdisk copies I sent out onto the site. When
either of these happen, the List will be informed. If anyone has any
FURTHER questions regarding Turbo PLus, please mail me. If you have any
questions regarding commands, etc., please wait till the docs are up.

I tried, and I have ~18 fps from RAM disk, and ~12 from hard, similar
results for compressed and uncompressed pictures. Maybe it would be a bit
slower for more complex compressed pics, but I realy don't see how did you
got 3 fps.

Try typing in CLI

tco

and see what is realy sent, and where. You can also try monitoring with
SnoopDos3.0 .

If everything else fails you can always use

Exec "RX "+chr$(34)+"address octamed_rexx ; op_set midiactive on"+chr$(34)

There is a program called DiskSafe (disk/salv/DiskSafe.lha) which captures
reset signal, caused by both keyboard or software, and delays reset long
enough to write bitmaps. I think that is *the* solution, however it
doesn't work on every Amiga...

I don't like such programs. I want do do something on the computer while it

Can any give me some prices on the following...

To suit an A1200...
a) CDROM & Squirrel kit (or any other CDROM configs to suit)
b) Accelerator board/RAM (50MHZ)
c) C/C++ (various packages...which one's the best?)
d) Amiga Developer CD.
e) PCMCIA Ethernet adapter.

Hi Nikola,

The only problem with using animation is they take up huge chunks of
memory. Keep going with the Load iff idea. I used it in StarFighter
for all my cut scenes. To get the best frame rate you need to use
'addbuffers' using the Exec command to the drive you are loading
multiple images from. Also letter-box the image down to about 320*192,
this gives a bit more speed. You can load up to HAM 5 images though the
best rates are achieved using 64 colours or lower.

Scan doublers make interlaced screens look chunky. Blech!

Put it in slot# 12. This goes for both AMOS 1.3 and Pro.

Or, you can develop an animation stream player, which loads one frame from
the animation at a time. Use the Frame Load command with a section of
memory, then double-buffer pate the new shot on the screen. I have a 3.5
meg anim I made for the (non-existant) CD-ROM version of Final
Existence, which plays at about 12 FPS (from an original 15) direct from a
SCSI Zip disk. Play around with that, and i fyou need code, I'll putll it
out and post it up.

"Mr. Giark To You" <giark@hicksville.ddns.org>


So, I was working on the SoloTrek III module editor and got busy on IRC. I
thought I'd shut AMOS down, so I fired it up and loaded the program. I didn't
mess with much code and saved it, then quit AMOS. A bit later, I couldn't
remember if AMOS was still running or not, so I flipped to it. It was, so I
closed it. I forgot that and tried to flip to it again. Lo and behold, another
AMOS was running!

No one mentioned this particular fix. Now you can run multiple copies of AMOS.
Beware!

Well met and godspeed,

Um, thats no a fix, I've been able to do that with the original
AMOSPro.

They don't multitask though, one copy locks the other out.

There is a patch though, which patches your compiled programs so that
they can multitask with other amos programs. I've got a copy if anyone
wants it.

See ya.

Yes, but tables and accuracy dont go togeather 8)
TGE genorates its tables, and so it has them VERY accurate
and yet as integers. There also the fastest tables ive seen.

How do I detect if an AMOS app is running, and what app it is (so that I can
put a message up, and abort the launch of the second copy)?

Maybe my Hard disk is slow (250Mb 2,5" IDE), and my amiga is only a
68020/25Mhz...
I load thousands of images, so the Amiga cannot bufferize all.

That's why I'm looking for a fast code.

I have also tried to address DOPUS and sending a simple command like

I will try this out.

really isn't in the code, I mean how much faster could you make a picture
loading loop? Try loading from ram, but if you don't have enough you
may just flat out be in trouble. Anybody got a copy of AmosPro they can
sell our friend cut rate? :)

Yes, the amount of free memory can be found by adding CHIP FREE to FAST
FREE, e.g:

MEM=Chip Free + Fast Free

Read the bloody manual!

Hey, are you aware that the following SHORT section of code does EXACTLY the

J=Joy(1)

Hey! Look! At this… Ne1 want a piece of code that turns the joystick input 2
+ or -..

Eg.

J=Joy(1) ;J=2 ; Joystick is Down!

K=J-2 ;k=0

P#=J/4.0 ;P#=0.5

P=P# ;P=0

I=Sgn(J) ;I=1

if P#=P ;This isn’t true 0.5<>0

X=Sgn(J-6)*I

End If

If P=0 ;This is true

Y=I*(K+K+1) ;Y=1

End If

Say you push the joystick up it returns y=-1 X=0!

If You Push Joystick Left then X=-1 Y=0

If You Push Joystick left Diagonally Up X=-1 and Y=-1

You Could use this in a game!! Something similar 2 tron!

Where U only need the direction in +1’s or –1’s!

I’ve used it and found it gets rid of annoying and slow If statements!!!!

Or U could just Delete this as it is a pointless waste of Virtual Paper!

hahaha ! Well, I think I'll try to reduce the images size (160x100?),
'cause effectively I have no much ram (4Mb fast, but 32 are expected for
soon), but I want to stay compatible with most configs, even the small
ones (2Mb chip, no fast).

Will I have to build my own animation-system ? Why not ?
Seriously, there is really no way to make a RAW save (bitplane by
bitplane if needed) and then RAW loads ?

Thanx for your answers, all of you.

Re: LDOS - Arexx

"Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>


The Arexx command TCO or TS do not display any entries for Arexx commands
sent from AMOSPro using LDOS. It does display info on scripts I execute
from the CLI.

What does this suggest?

Exec "RX "+chr$(34)+"address octamed_rexx op_set midiactive on"+chr$(34)
works fine but slows down my program, so is not a realistic option. Thanks
anyway.

Arexx host names are _case sensitive_, maybe there is a bug in Arexx Exist

Try typing in CLI

tco
ts

and see what is realy sent, and where. You can also try monitoring with
SnoopDos3.0 .

If everything else fails you can always use

Exec "RX "+chr$(34)+"address octamed_rexx ; op_set midiactive on"+chr$(34)

Are you using F Paste Icon? These work rather badly, although fast.
There seems to be a bug in it which causes it to write to the wrong part
of mem or something.

You should use F 16proc Icon / F 32proc Icon as these have no such
problems.

(I think its a bug in the blitter routines or something)


And with the compiler, is there an S drawer in your amospro drawer?
If there is then go to interpriter config, load default config and save
it in S:

Then delete the S drawer in AMOSPro drawer, that should fix it I think.

I guess a PC version will only happen after AMOS NG, which will be

If LDOS should send commands in a standard way (which means that it would
not work without RexxMast), that means that commands aren't sent. If it
sends commands to Arexx port directly (like e.g. scmsg), that still
doesn't means anything.

Are you sure that you don't need to somehow 'Open' port before sending
messages to it? If you are, then... I don't have LDOS, and I realy don't
know what is the problem, sorry.

/Maybe/ it would help if you make RX resident.

Giark,
I was not aware that there was any Arexx specific commands in the GUI
extension. As far as I knew the GUI extension gave a more OS friendly way
of handling Arexx. Am I wrong? Can you give me more details. Thanks.

Yeah, don't wait... just DO IT!!
How far along are you? What PC language will you be using (C,
C++, Assembler, etc)?? Will you be creating an interpreter,
RunTime Environment, true compiler, etc???

I had actually planned on making an AMOS to BLITZ source
convertor at some point, but Paul Burkey has already started on
such a program (which I think the first version may already be on
Aminet)... and now after listening to my brother and many other
people complain about the lack of a PC AMOS style language
(combined with the fact that I now do almost all of my programming
on my PC), I am considering working on an AMOS compatible PC
language... not 100% compatible as I wouldn't include that horrible
Amal subset language and probably would force the use of a
Bob Clear... Bob Draw structure.


Anyway, I think that by using C and Allegro, a programmer could
easily create an AMOS style language, but obviously you would
need many support utilities: graphic convertors, data bank
convertors, sound convertors, music convertors, etc.

The point is there would be a lot of work involved in such a project,
which is probably why no one has finished an AMOS compatible PC
language yet... they start and make reasonably good progress, but I
think they haven't planned out the project, so when they keep finding
more and more sub-projects that need to be completed, they
ultimately end up "burnt out" and say "the heck with it!".
Bear in mind, this is just my opinion, but I imagine that's pretty
close to what actually happens.

Anyway, I would be interested in hearing your plans for this PC
equivalent of AMOS... perhaps this is something we could work
on as a group project. Define the whole project, EXACTLY WHAT
NEEDS TO BE DONE, list these items (parsing, conversion utilities,
code generation, support libraries for audio-video, etc.) and then
let four or five PC programmers each take one task and work on
it. Once completed, we grab another task until soon we have it all
done and behind us... instead of continually hearing people ask
"Where can I find a PC AMOS?" and saying "there is none, but
maybe we could make one", we could finally say "Here, try this!!"

What do you think?

Hi all,

Here's a thought on the PC AMOS question... didn't Mr Lionet write
something for the PC? "Klik'n'Play" or something?
Now, that's not really a solution, but maybe he can back track a little and
continue with a REAL language...and we can get PC AMOS written by the
creator himself!

But he's probably sick and tired of STOS, AMOS, EasyAMOS, AMOSPRO... so
it's probably not an option.

What the heck happened to him, anyway?!

Amos is not the best. It is just the best for begginning in all
purposes... Do you remember what "B.A.S.I.C." means ?
It stays anyway a very good language.

Amiga is the best, I agree !

If you mean printing a screen, then use 'Printer Dump'. This simply
send the current screen to the printer device.

Does anyone has ideas, how to use for REAL a sampler on the parallel-prot?? (i
mean real sampling to disk or ram and playback, realtime effects)
i no one of you had some ideas, i will start to program a extension myself.
(trying to do...) what do you think about a SamplingExtension??

Well, I made a series of article about how to make extensions in a local
paper mag. It is in hungarian tongue.
If it helps, I can send you the text.

Bob Off alternative

Mon Sep 28, 1998 5:35 pm
"Service" <service@emed.com>


I think there might've been a question in the past about
turning off specified BOBs related to the Bob Draw command.
Here's a technique if anyone's interested:

Here's the simplest way of drawing a Bob on screen:
Bob n,x,y,image
Bob Draw

Since there is no such command as Bob Off n,
how about re-locating the Bob out of view.
Example: on a 320x200 screen
Bob n, 350,0,image

This is assuming you don't have a super-wide Bob,
if that's the case just increase x-postition.
Of, course it depends on the Hot Spot how far the Bob is positioned
off screen so that no part of the image is appearing on screen.
If the Hot Spot of the Bob is at 0,0 you could
Bob n,321,0,image.

But you guys and gals probably already knew this,

Laterz,
Ken

Dim array() problem.

Mon Sep 28, 1998 11:03 pm
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


While in AMOS lately I quickly compiled a program I was working on and ran
it. Much to my surprise, it didn't get past the first few instructions (it
returned an "Illegal function call"). I went back, did some debugging and
found it was a Dim statement I had made to an array. Here's an excerpt:

Set Buffer 1024..
Dim _VAR(G*5,G*5) (G=64)

I made a small program to see if I could solve the problem and found that
nothing over G*3 worked, even if the Buffer was over 5000k! Assuming my
calculator doesn't lie: 64*5=320, 320^2=102400, 102400/1024=100k, which
tells me that a Set Buffer 1024 should be more than enough. :/

I was just wondering if anyone could help with this problem. I have one or
two ideas, but since I'm not at my Amiga, I have yet to try them. If anyone
has a quick solution or sees something I've missed, please mail. Thanks.

Ah yes, I had this problem too. It seems that AMOS doesn't like dim'ing
anything with over a certain ammount of arays. The only way to get
around this is using a memory bank insted.

eg. Reserve as work 5,(G*5)*(G*5)+10

This'll save memory and speed.

See ya.

Yep! I try no to use Arrays if i can help it... but instead of using the
Amos reserve bank why no use a call and reserve memory through the propper
channels... its a lot better! I don't have the right call on me right now
but i'll be back!

Hmmm, I'm pretty sure I've made arrays waaaay bigger than that (although it
had many more levels/subscripts/arguments/whatever they're called). I'll
have to check when I get home.

Hey! I reckon we should prove AF wrong and compile a demo with everyone
heres work in it... I already have lots of setions i can compile together..

3d rotating shade Clusters
Snow Demo
3D Isometric Rotaion
Musical Spline Curves
Rainbow tinting + normal tinting
256 colour public screen contol (To load good images!)
fast scrolls....
And so forth.... Can any one out there add to this?
I think we need to show what our language can do...!!!
Anyone with me?

Hi,

The last comment is half true, using memory banks is a great idea especially
if you want to allocate additional array elements (redim) but as for
speed........ its far slower reading values from a memory bank than an
array.
