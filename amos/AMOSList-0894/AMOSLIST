I think and wish that more AMOS programmers or user's in general would 
upload there work/programs to the Aminet via FTP at wuarchive.wustl.edu
for all to check out, use, and enjoy them. It's so hard to find any AMOS
stuph proggys here in San Diego as far as PD, SHareware, Freeware ones
go and it would be great to see what others have done and created such as 
games, utilities, extensions, whatever ...

I have uploaded my latest program to the Aminet it is called: FSelExt.lha

What it is an extension to the FSel$ command. When used in conjunction 
with, you can return:

- Just the filename with no drawers, ect...
- Get the bytes of the filename
- Return the path where the file is located
- And also just return the device

Comes with an example to show you how to use it in your programs.

Well I for one don't care if any games or programs are made with AMOS 
since I enjoy AMOS very much and use it much more than Blitz Basic 2 as I 
have both, I enjoy them both and use them both, but I like AMOS much 
better and since I have a A600Hd I don't have too worry too much about 
those enforcer hits. I just wish there were more AMOS programs on the 
Aminet since it would be in it's own drawer dev/amos as with Blitz BAsic 
2 programs as well and if someone who doesn't want it well then that's 
there choice, but if they don't well what would they be doing in the 
dev/amos drawer to begin with. I'm sure there are many others out there 
as myself who do, so don't let that discourage you from sending your work 
to the Aminet or any other programs that have been written with AMOS 
that's what the directory is there for (dev/amos) just for AMOS programs 
for AMOS owners and user's !! 

C-ya

P.S If you have any procedures that you have written I would like to see 
them if you don't mine or even use them with your permission of course. 
Just send them to me in uuencoded form via e-mail to my address:

gcox@ctsnet.cts.com

Thanx!

Have you downloaded FSelExt.lha from the Aminet Vincent ? If so, how do you
like it ?

Greg

Can you give me more information on this, please?  I understand the

More or less - the main problem is that it's hard to use real Intuition 
stuff, so you have to fudge it a bit - I've written my own (monstrously 
ugly) procedures to simulate cycle gadgets, etc, and I always make sure 
that I do the easy things like having "Quit" at the bottom of the 
left-hand menu, etc...  Sadly AMOS isn't all that good for applications 
programming - C is the only way to go.  AMOS is really looking a bit 
dated now:  it's too clunky for applications, too slow for games, and too 
big for just knocking up a quick program - I usually have a copy of 
HiSoft BASIC loaded for writing little snippets of code or for use as a 
calculator. :)

Commodore has released a set of guidelines on what the interface(s) to 
programs should look like... AFAIK it's just a book with these 
'reccomendations' in it..  If it's anything like the RKM's, I wouldn't 
think it's worth buying. ie. TOO EXPENSIVE!

  Try the Intuition Extension (by me :-) ).  You can open Intuition screens
and windows with a single simple command.  You can have menus attached to
your windows, and use all sorts of requesters.  Gadgets are in testing now
and will be in the next release (probably in a couple of weeks).

  If you want more information, let me know.

Copper Experts:
	I want to learn to program the copper.  I saw a short little 
program in the turbo plus demos that uses only the copper to wobble the 
screen back and forth.  I browsed the code, but its all hex. no comments 
or anything.  I have a couple questions.
1.  What kinds of things is the copper in charge in the system?
2.  Is there a comprehensive list of copper instructions somewhere?
3.  I've heard of an 8-way copper scroller(i.e. for games)  can this be 
implemented in amos?

You don't live in Australia, do you...

MOST of the Addison Wesley RKM etc. books are about $60-$70 here.. :(

A roommate's girlfriend recently gave a 'psychedelic' party and I 
provided the 'computer visuals'. First I thought I could get enough 
demos to show the whole evening, but most demos on Aminet seem to 
be all vector graphics and scrolly messages of sub-adolescent 
standard, so I knocked something up in Amos to show between the few 
useful demos I could find. I would post this programme to the net 
if my computer would not still be in the room of my roommate's 
girlfriend, who is still on vacation.

Well, if you looked on Aminet::dev/amos you might find a file 
called ProcLib3.0, which is a library of all kinds of usefull 
procedures (compiled by Andrew Church). Maybe you could send Andy 
your Fsel-extension for inclusion.

Which reminds me, I used the two AMAL-procedures in the Procedure 
Library as the basis for my pschydelic programme. The ProcLib IS 
being used!!! As soon as I have got my Ami back I will upload the 
source as v.001 to dev/amos on Aminet. That may not be before 
september however. The executable final version might find its way 
also there, if I ever get to finish it.

The one your thinking of Paul is SoundTracker2_1.AMOS there is an update 
out there that debugged all the bugs out of it, if someone has it please 
send me a copy of it.

Thanx!

P.S. I would just like to have the updated version in my collection and 
for me too use since I have or can find very little AMOS stuph out there 
in San Diego. If anyone has any other killer utilities, accessories, 
extensions that they have made, or games for that matter feel free to 
send them to the Aminet or mail me a UUENCODED copy of it.

Hi all.

I have AGA machine, so I tried 24bit copper on AMOSPro.  My AMOSPro
does not support AGA, so I used custom-copper list.  And I watched
very beautiful copper, but there is FATAL probrem.

		    I became can't use Bob!!

Is there nice way??  I programmed with AMOS's sample program(there
is simple copper sample program).

Thanks!!

Yes, and Manuel is working on it - it will probably be copperwrap 
(vertical wrapping of a bitmap, top wraps to bottom), combined with 
screen offset.  This means no blitter, and lots of speed.

other than this, i don't know much about the blitter.

Is there some way to load or display dctv pictures using AMOS?  AMOS 
says it can't load it.  Its my understanding that DCTV pics are 
regular pictures, but decoded by the hardware.  Is there some way to do this?

I thought you may be interested in this letter received by Commodore's
UK distributors this morning.

I seem to be forwarding a lot of letters today! :)

Dom

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the past few months the speculation about Commodore, and in particular
about the future of the Amiga, has been rife.

I would like to put "the record straight" so to speak, and bring you up to
date as to the latest position.

Our parent company, Commodore International Limited, and its subsidiary
Commodore Electronics Limited, are both in liquidation, under the
jurisdiction of the Bahamian Courts (C.I.L. and C.E.L. are both
registered in the Bahamas).

The liquidators, Delliotte Touche, are actively seeking to sell the assets
of both C.I.L. and C.E.L.

There are a number of bids in place for various combinations of the assets.
Colin Proudfoot and I, along with two senior executives of commodore
International (but not Mehdi Ali) have made a bid, which if successful
will give us the rights to manufacture, sell and market the whole range of
Commodore Products, past, present and future, on a world-wide basis.

We have raised the necessary finance and believe we will be successful
in our to purchase this business. If we are successful, we will give
priority to our core business, the UK and ensure that the loyalty that has
been shown to us will be rewarded.

Our budgets do include a significant level of advertising spoend, which
we will use to the very best effect.

The Amiga CD32, Amiga 1200, Amiga 4000 and CD 1200 will be produced and
sold during the Christmas period.  It is anticipated that if all goes to
schedule, we will be delivering product around the first week of November,
possible the second week.

It is our belief that by far the majority of retailers will be out of 
current stock by the end of September/early October, so there will
only be a short delay before new bundles arrive.

Rest assured, our plans include the best packs we have ever offered.

I know these are trying times for us all, but I give you my personal
word that we are doing everything in our power to ensure that not only
do we keep the Amiga family alive, but that we also lift the brand up
to its righful place at the top of the market where it belongs.

Thank you for your highly valued support, without which we would not have
a business worth fighting for.

Very best wishes

They wouldn't tell you about it now.  You have to go higher than the 
letter answerer to get real information.  Its just Francois' idea right 
now, he may not have even suggested to anyone in europress yet.

I wouldn't discount it yet.

Yes, unless they release the source PD.  PD means PD, unless there are 
restrictions to it.
Who know what the heck they'll do...

I wonder the legalities of making something that replaced (or patched) 
parts of amos system....

Hello everybody:

Recently I've joined to the list and this is my first message.

My name is Angel and I am 26 years old. Yes, Michael, I am (and live) in Spain.
I am the only spanish-man in the list? :-(

I am working in a game with AMOS Pro v1.12, but I've a problem with the bobs
and their colours. At the end of this message, I include a part of my program.
It loads the bobs and a graphic. You can move the bob with the mouse and change
the bob's image pressing the space bar. The problem is related with the bob. It
changes its colour on several parts of the screen. Why? It's a bug of AMOS? I
could be wrong? If someone can help me, please, email-me to angel@labein.es.
Thanks in advance.

What version of TurboPlus is included in CU Amiga?

I bet that C= Germany and C= Canada are backing up C= UK.

Ok, about the updated LDos:
Version number jumped from 2.5 to 2.6.
LAnsi now supports 16-color ANSI escape code sequences.
There is a new C-like Lstrcmp-function for comparing strings.
And a couple of other little things... Can't remember them all.
Except that according to the docs, AmosPro trashes memory if the dir$ 
when a program exits is not the same it  was when the program was 
run. Someone check this out :-) Might explain some weird Amos crashes.

ach!  I screwed up and lost the file about commodore from c=uk.  Does 
anyone have a copy they can forward to me? Sorry to be a pest. 
While you're at it, cc: a copy to witbrock@cs.cmu.edu and go check out 
his web site-

http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/MainPage.html

Go there with mosaic for a nice colorful treat!

I know this is off the topic, but I am interested if anyone has ever created
anything with either:

o Pinball Power
o Wargame Construction Set

If so, then I would like to see your work. Send them to me via uuencoded
e-mail or upload them to a ftp site, but specify which one you sent it too.

Thanx!

Because it has something to do with Amos, it doesn't work as it should :-)

Subject: windows
Status: RO

Grrr.......
I've got a problem with opening a window in amos.
I'm using the Interface resouce, ie, a few buttons and and Active list as
the main screen. I wanted a window to open on this screen with some info
for the user at certain events.
The problem is that the area under the screen does not appear to be saved.
When I close the window(I only open 1) it does not remove itself from the
screen.
I can only get the window to remove itself by using 2 wind close commands.
ie. 
    palette , $a86,,,,
    paper 2
    <interface program bits here>
    ............
    wind save
    wind open <parameters>
    print "message text string in here"
    wait key
    wind close: rem nothing happens!! The window still exists!
    wind close: rem window closes but the saved window is not restored!

This clears the window, but leaves me with a black rectangle on the screen.

It only seems to happen when using the interface. Opening a screen and
saving windows work Ok otherwise, even when I change the paper palette.

I'm stuck...
Any ideas? Is it another bug? Can I work around it? How?
Please help as another sleepless night will do me no good.:-[

I know this is off topic, but does anyone use XPK on their hard drive to
compress files?  I am running out of hard disk space and want to compress as
much as I can, like in the MSDOS Stacker world.  What do I need to get?

Thanks!

That shouldn't be a problem, as long as you don't distribute any of
the original AMOS code in your patch.

  I use it all over the place.  My entire sounds/music partition is
compressed, as well as various directories (including the assembler/C
include files, which I use in my Intuition Extension... see, I managed to
thread AMOS into it! :-) ) on my main partition.

  To use it, download util/pack/xpk25usr.lha from AmiNet, along with any
other compressors there that you want (SQSH is good for sound samples).
It's full of instructions on how to set it up.

Look for fleetv1.lha under game/think.  It is a tactical star fleet battle

I'mmmmmm back. (And loaded with new AMOS programs, so you better read all
of this crap or missout, as I've burried the announcments deep in this
message). There's also replies to many of the messages of the past few weeks.



"Please send me a uuencoded copy of ..."
========================================

I've noticed a lot of these messages recently. Can I say to the recievers /
senders or "..." to upload it to /dev/amos, if it's legal. Or, if you can't
upload to aminet, mail it to someone who can (E.g. Me, if you can wait a
week or so for my next visit to college, Mike Cox, Ryan Scott, etc. (Who
I'm sure will thank me profusely for volenteering them...)).

Greg Cox, upload dump, if you haven't already, and that Sound Tracker if
it turns up.





Parrallel port address
======================

It's in the $BFExxx or $DFFxxx range somewhere, but can you just use 
Open Port "PAR:", then the normal IO commands?




'Psychedelic Parties'
=====================

I have this vision of about 14 people trying to dance in a 10ft. by
14ft. bedroom in front of a 14inch portable T.V. flashing pinky purpley
sort of colours. As for the computer in the roommates girlfriends
apartment, I found a guide to lock picking on cybernet (Sorry to all those
intelligent computer users for using the that prefix) complete with
diagrams, and execises.





Legalities of something that patched / replaced parts of the AMOS system
========================================================================

I don't see that it could be illegal, as long as you don't distribute
parts of europresses code. Differicult, but not illegal...






Amiga E V3.0
============

I agree that E is a rather nice programming language, but if anyone has
managed to get MUI Builder to work with E, please let me know how - I
seem to have an mui.m file missing. Also, Andy, is it possible to get
the intuition extension to support MUI?



http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/MainPage.html
======================================================================


You can also get aminet via mosaic, and to this page from aminet. Just
http to the /pub/aminet/info/www drawer of your local mirror, if that
site supports WWW.




XPK
===


You need the XPK compression package on aminet in /util/pack. Also, there
is an XPK archiver package which is brand new, and introduces XPK
archives. The XPK compressios package includes an XFH file handler which
mounts a device name to a directory, which is similar to assigning to
a directory, but when you use the XFH device name, the file is (de)compressed
with an XPK packer first.

>From AMOS, Easylife has commnands to save/load XPK data without using XFH.
Also, whoever was writting the program to load powerpacked AMOS programs
into the AMOS editor,

 a) Is it done yet?

 b) Any chance of converting it to use XPK.





Easylife Problem (Grrrrr.....)
==============================

Well, the problem is not with Easylife, which is the extension, but with
the variable checker. This is one of only 2 replies I got about the
variable checker - has anyone else used it? Did it work? (Mail me, not
the list). As for the problem code, I can't say what causes it offhand
without looking at my source, but it is probably because it didn't 
consider infix operators such as 'mod' in the first part of an If. Anyone
else find problems, or are you all too scared to check your old programs?

However, Mike Cox has found a real easylife bug in the Elin Get command.
Anyone else notice anything???



My New Uploads
==============

Here's the important bit - 2 new programs:

 - Zone Editor V3.0. The AMOSPro version of zone editor, complete with zoom
   mode, and the ability to read/write set zone commands  in your source
   code.

 - Editor enhancer. Replace the AMOS Pro editors crippled search & replace
   with something that works, and add a few new features to the editor.
   
 - An Improved default resource bank, and documentation on which elements
   to use for which purposes.

All of it is in the file ZoneEditor3.0 in /dev/amos (Or it will be
eventually) on aminet. Have fun....

 




Is there an aminet listserv?
============================

Here's the full information on how to connect to src.doc.ic.ac.uk. Aminet
files are in /pub/aminet.

Yes, the LOF() returns bytes.

TURBO PLUS is commercial, Intuition is shareware(?), and AGA is still being
worked on as far as I know.

You know I'd like to have a separate listserv where we could upload all 
our files....  I don't mind getting a few megs a day (I don't have a 
quota! but many folks wouldn't have trouble with a meg or two they can 
delete if they don't want)....

Does anyone agree (I think greg cox wouldn't mind and I'd like it)???

I could host the listserv - but maybe theres an easier way to do this.  
I just hate having to dig through a site for what I want I like to get it 
in the mail.  Maybe I'm just a baby. ;-)

Hmm... I was just thinking - how many people are on this list?  Only a 
core of about 10 people do all the yapping.  Come on folks dont be shy!

>Anyone else find problems, or are you all too scared to check your old 
programs?

Yeah, well it found things I left in there on purpose... I guess thats 
the way it goes.  I like mostly to watch it work.

You can get the file size this way: (easiest way)
I'm doing this from memory, btw, might not work first time ;-)

f$=filename
If Exist(f$)
	Open In 1,f$
	L=Lof(1)
	Close 1
Else
	file doesn't exist
Endif

l = the length of the file, 0 if none


About TURBO PLUS, Intuition, AGA - well TURBO PLUS and Intuition are 
going to work together to bring you AGA!  Intuition is displaying the 
screens and TURBO PLUS is slamming AGA icons on them superfast!  

Its all in progress - look for release sometime in the future.

Meantime support our work with your cash dollars and suggestions!  Thats the 
best way to insure it keeps going.

Mike,

Following my previous mailing, here is the Europress fax number
you're wanting. Just add the US international code before;

                       +44-625-879962

BTW, the receptionist didn't sound stupid. She sounded quite nice
really ;^)

Hope this work.

I always thought that was the case, too.  What error message does AMOS 
give?  Maybe DCTV Paint (or whatever source the pictures are from) 
doesn't save in IFF - will DPaint load the pictures?  If not, send me one 
and I'll see if I can decipher it...

Hi all,

Next week, (Aug. 15+)  NorthWest Public Domain will be receiving CDPD 4, 
CD disc number 4 in the excellent series by Almathera.

"A new CD? Big deal."  Ah, but this one is a big deal, it contains the 
AMOS PD library up through about disk 600.

To all nonbelievers, this CD will be $19.95 US, but for all the members 
of the amos-list we are going to special price it at $16.95.  That's 
right call me, say you saw it on the list, give me your email address, 
and get $3.00 knocked off the price.

John

Actually, Intuition is commercial and AGA is not being worked on 
anymore as a standalone product.  But Intuition does AGA and TURBO PLUS 
is working with Intuition to be completely AGA.  Right now you can't do 
totally AGA stuff, but in the near future, yes.  Look for it soon.

I may be wrong, but are you not offering a free extra service to

If anyone has been getting duplicates of my post .. the one where I was 
requesting for some programs, well I have no idea why it keeps showing up 
on the list as I posted it along time ago and it just showed up again, 
very strange indeed. So just ignore it, thanx!

Thanx for re-sending the "amfiles.lha" again as you mentioned my first 
one was corrupted as I am not using ELM, but instead using PINE.

Thanx! again

 Yoo!

 Does anybody have 'AMOS Professional' manual on disk?

I DO have a legal version of AMOS PRO bought from my local dealer.

I DO have a manual in the form of a book, but I am NOT so keen on

typing the manual into ascii format.

If YOU have a manual, please mail it unpacked in ascii to me directly.

BTW...English is not my native language.

FTAM is GOSIP for File Transfer Asomething Management.  At least that is the
only FTAM that I know of.  Not very popular, I think.

Thats a tough one - I vote for Scorched Tanks.  I like Roach Motel, but 
thats because I wrote it.  

Wanna take votes on this?

I think Scortched Tanks is on Aminet somewhere - a newer version is 
on L!AB (305) 456-126.    I have it in my library btw.

And please re: uploading to Aminet - please don't send things to me to 
get uploaded to Aminet.

Well you know, maybe I can come to university and teach some amos classes 
- give you lots of amos related homework - "Scan the net for AMOS!" 
"Deluge all newsgroups with AMOS propaganda!"

Thanks to all.

I (and my brother) are finishing a game, it is really good, only
one problem... will be shareware, or will be Freeware? we think the best
option is freeware, and if somebody want, could send, no money, best
a postal, or anyting.

I asked about the best program written in amos because i think our program
can be one of these, well you will see it latter. Maybe in one or two weeks 
I
will upload it to Aminet, is called Chaneques.

Please Add a little sing in the bottom of your messages,
When I read one, the header only says "From Amos-request"
(I think because I use Microsoft Mail) and I sometimes I don't
know who really send the message.

Thanx for sending me your FontBankMaker Neil, it is very impressive the gfx
is outstanding ... however what's the easiest way to convert it to work 
within NTSC as it is too big and doesn't fit on my monitor in NTSC mode ? 
It looks like you have it pre-config for PAL.

I also don't think I got the Twilight ZOne program you talked about as 
the only thing I got in the UUENCODED file was the FontBankMaker program. 
Also I can get large E-Mail UUENCODED files as well since I am connected 
to the Internet with full access, so the file size isn't a problem :)

Thanx! again

Greg

Is anybody else out there running AMOS under Kickstart 3.1.

I've only just noticed, but AMOS won't display interlaced screens properly
on my KS3.1 A500+. It worked fine with KS2.0. All I get is a non-interlaced
screen that jumps up and down.

I've only tried this with AMOS Pro at the moment, but I presume AMOS v1.36
will be the same.

The AMOS Pro manual is copyrighted, and may not be distributed in ANY
form without written permission from Europress.

I don't think anyone but Europress has it on disk anyway.

I was under the impression that DCTV pictures WERE IFF except that a 
small portion in the top corner was sacrificed to contain the special 
palette information required - DCTV Paint could then recognise this and 
display the picture in DCTV form.

I did get this down but on my A500 (1 Meg) it stops loding in the middle
of the loading screen and just sits there.  Oh well...that's one more 
PD game I won't be getting.

Hi,

Very cool update to the Zone Editor accessory ... I was curious on how 
you did the routine that when you select the amostoback option from the 
ZoneEditor how did you get it to pop up a window with a close gadget and
the title in it. Could you send me a uuencoded copy of a routine that 
just does this ... that is if you want to tell me how it's done, that 
would be great :)

Thanx!

Greg

Well I'm here, but because everyone else seems to have Amos Pro while I
only have Amos I don't get to talk much.

Hi Carl,

Not really ther's alot of user's on this list that only have AMOS or both 
for that matter. I have AMOS v1.36 and AMOSPro v2.00 and still go back 
and use AMOS because there are extensions out there that are only written 
to work with AMOS v1.3x (The Creator) and not AMOSPro. So don't let that 
stop you from posting any questions about AMOS someone on the list will 
be happy to answer them for you :)

It could be that something has changed in 3.1 that AMOS isnot friendly to. :(

I was reading Europress' "End of Project Report" on AMOS Professional
last night.

One of the `Initial project objectives' was:

`To keep the AMOS family of products alive for another 2 years'

and another was:

`To be released in September 1992'

By my reckoning, that gives AMOS a little over 2 weeks to live!

There is a simple solution to this.... :)

Once you start using AMOS Pro, you won't want to go back to AMOS.

I gathered that, Mike! :)

I've tried it with AMOS 1.36, and it's the same, it squashes the screen
up to fit into the space, missing out alternate lines, and jumping
around randomly.

I've got AmosPro too, but I don't believe that there is a great deal more
AmosPro coverage that Amos Classic.

Besides, just 'cos you're still using Amos classic doesn't mean that
you can't give you're 2-peneth ( $.02 US currency ;^)

BTW, any chance of shortening your Sig ? It is a tad large #8^0)

TTFN.

I'm looking for any kind of Intro/DemoMakers for the Amiga, especially 
any written in AMOS, if you have any could you upload them to Aminet or
mail me a UUENCODED copy of it.

Thanx!

This is not true, CDPD4 does not contain ANY AMOS PD disks.

Nope.  Are they on Aminet anywhere?  Is it all AMOS?  If any of it is AMOS and
on Aminet, let me know so I can put the filenames in the FAQ.

Hello again,

This is Jam typing away during his lunch break (in the UK). I just thought
that I'd send u lot a message, to see what's happening.

Mike - I can't get software on the internet, I'm using a strictly email
only system.

I hate PC's, every1 at work uses them, and all of IT roughly know how crap
they are. So why are PC's popular? Well, I suppose it's the tonnes of
pieces of software that is developed for them. Anyway, the reason I
mentioned PC's is bcoz I saw a compiled Visual C++ program, it opens a
window and says, "Hello World!" in it.
Okay, u all say, but then u look at the size of the file - 1.13 Mb !!! I'm
not lying, that's a fact! And every1 thought AMOS produced big files!
1.13mb is the MINIMUM for a windows program. I said to the coder when he
added a simple circle to the window, "Will that be another 500k to the
program lenght?".
PC's, urrgghh!

I've written a poem about AMOS:-

AMOS PRO,
AMOS CLASSIC,
AMOS COMPILER,
AMOS JURASSIC,
----
AMOS'LL GO MAD IF YA PUT ASSEMBLER INTO IT!

Okay, its crap but I don't care!

Does every1 on here have a sense of humour (or insanity!) bcoz with me, u
have 2!

Anyway, on Amos Classic(!) does any1 know how 2 make several text files a
single file which can then be read into a diskmag quickly? Hmm...

Jam.

Yes, way behind - I had to get a 'real' job... I work from 9 to 9:30 or 
so with an internet provider (fun stuff), so the newsletter is being

Well email addresses for those things wouldn't do much good.  There is a 
blitz mailing list!  ask to the amos mailing list 
and someone will let you know what it is...

There's some amazing stuff on the world wide web for nasa and evertyhing 
else - but you'll have to wait for that type of thing til you have real 
time accesss.

I've read that PageStream3 is almost done!  it looks very very powerful, 
its targeting Quark X Press type quality!!!

Hello once again,

Oh flip, it takes f'ing years for these mail messages to get over the sea!
The time now is 4:09pm if it wasn't 12:00pm for the US (where u are Mike)
then it really does take the best part of a day for a round trip email.
I tell u what, I'm gonna get a modem for home use so I can dial direct to
a BBS with a free email facility so I get my emails out faster, GGR's mail
hubs are sllooowwww.

Well this is my 4th message I've done today global and personal, but I
won't be on at the weekend unless I find a modem to get onto Spud's Xanadu
(free email). I wish these messy were faster at travelling. Any1 know a
fast route for email?

Mike, the group I'm in isn't an Amos group, it's a scene demo group in the
UK, there are real coders in it but it isn't that well known.
Okay, I've only just started on the Internet, how does the Aminet work, and
is it a domain for u/l and d/ling files? Oh, and whats a PAQ?

It's nice to know other people are insane as well! ;)

By the time u will get this u will have my other message about the CD-ROM,
so send a reply soon.

One last thing, how many different countries do people come from on here?

Jam.

But, you can encode it to send via email and I can upload it to AMinet.

Well, in the PC world (which is what I work in) disk space is so cheap that it
is starting to not matter. :(  I wish the same was true for Amiga.

I am sure we all do.

Perhaps find the size of each text file: TOTAL = LOF(1) + LOF(2) and then
Reserve as Work BANKNO,TOTAL : Then bload each text file into the bank,
adding the start address to the LOF(1) for the start of file2.  Then BSAVE
the whole bank.

He Daryl,

If you have ftp access the look on Aminet it's already there as that is 
where I got it from (wuarchive.wustl.edu in the dev/amos drawer).

There's a program on the Amos Creator EXTRAS: Disk called
IFF_Brush_To_Sprite.Amos that turns a Brush into a one-bob bank.

Also, IFF Brushes are basicaly the same as IFF Screens except that
screens MUST have an X co-ord evenly divisible by 16.  As long as
your brush's X Size is a multiple of 16 it'll load fine with a
Load Iff command.

Hi all! (original, isn't it)

I have a couple of questions, too:

Currently I am using Amos Pro 1.2.
Where do I get this 2.0? I am going to look for it on Aminet/Swizerland
and Funet/Finland but I thought I ask it anyway...

What is that Playfield you are talking about?

Do Amos PROgrams speed up when compiling them? How many times faster?

How do I get DUAL DISPLAY off?

How to know whether the screen # is opened already or not?

What extensions are there for this A-Pro 2.00 and how do they get
compiled?

Is there a way I can use AGA-pictures in A-PRO? Or do I have to
compile them to for example ham-8 => ham-6 / hires-ham => lores-
ham? Can Amos (talking only about PRO) make use of dynamic-HAM?

Is there a better version of displaying animations than the one
in the manual (page 07.05.06)? It's blinking when re-starting
the sequence.

If I can't use AGA-pictures from Load Iff, I have to use
picture-players from DOS with the Exec-command.
What is the best viewer both for animations & pics?
I have Mostra & ViewTek but I don't
know how to use them properly...

Ryan,

I didn't understand your message at all.
Maybe it's because I'm novice and from all away from Finland and
everything.
What's going on?
What's this Amiga Home Page?
What did the rest stand for?

  You have to order it from Europress (AFAIK).

  An AMOS magazine.  It used to be produced by Ryan Scott... I think he
still takes orders (do you Ryan?).

  Yes, and many.  Depending on the program, you can get a speedup of
1000% or more after compiling.

  I assume you mean "Dual Playfield"... no way that I know, except by
closing the screens.

S=Screen
Trap Screen NUMBER_TO_TEST
SCR_EXISTS=Errtrap

  All AMOS Pro extensions work with Pro 2.00.  Ask Mike Cox for the
FAQ - it lists all the extensions that currently exist for AMOS and
Pro.

  AMOS does not have AGA support.  The Intuition Extension does.

Hello,
   I asked about this a while ago but I thought that perhaps things had 
changed in the mean time...
   There seems to be a problem when implementing parallax scrolling with 
a dual playfield display.  If both screens are scrolled with the screen 
offset command, they begin to 'jerk' around.  It seems when one screen 
offset reaches a multiple of 16 the other screen 'jumps' back to the 
nearest multiple of 16 as well.
   I've come up with two unsatisfactory solutions: don't use offsets that 
cause this problem (very limiting), or 'freeze' each screen before it 
reaches a 16 pixel boundary then 'unfreeze' the screen once it has passed 
it (still quite jerky).
   I was told this is a problem with AMOS (and AMOS Pro) and not the 
Amiga.  Has anyone written any code that eliminates this problem?  If so, 
I'd be forever grateful if you'd share :)  I'm completely stuck!  Thanks 
in advance...
                                                            - Tim Wright

I thought it was pretty good - it explains the scroll offset scroller

Depends on the cost, of course.

Oh, sorry about that....  If US Amiga users call Electronics boutique at 
the number i supplied, we may be able to get them to carry it in their us 
stores (big chain).

The amiga home page can be reached by a world wide web browser such as 
lynx or mosaic, or something like that.  I forget the url for it 
(universal resource locater - its address in other words)...

You can use sprite grabber (supplied with amos) or use a converter (also
supplied with amos). I don't remember the exact names of the programs cos
I don't use them anymore but they're there

Hello All,

I'm not really Mr J Andrews - I'm Jam. KeaTerm just sticks that stupid `Mr'
in front without asking me!

Mike, thanx for the single file advice, but I've adopted a new method for
my diskmag which is probably better going to be better for what I need. The
reason for this is I can still change each article file individually if I
want to edit the text.

Oh, [anyone] how do you send data(binary) files using email, I'm using
KeaTerm on a PC and it does have a Kermit transfer (protocol?) on it.

Here's a little flashing routine which look like you are decrunching using
Powerpacker, etc ...

_FLASH
Procedure _FLASH
        cls 0
        randomize timer
        for t=1 to 20000
                doke rnd(4095),$dff180
        next
End Proc

colour register addresses:

      0               $dff180
      1               $dff182
      2               $dff184        etc.....

As you can see the address goes up in 2 - thats cos you are using DOKE!!

Got 2 go...

Jam.

Yes, I told Francois about this months ago, I can't upgrade to 3.1 until 
I finally leave AMOS Pro forever.

If you're writting programs in AMOS which require any graphics then
please let me know.

Although I program a little, my real forte is graphics (In fact, my
main use for AMOS is for displaying my work).

So, if you want any graphics AT ALL, please e-mail me. I will only
refuse if I am already too busy 8^)

Current hardware set-up;
A4000/030/25Mhz+68882/25Mhz
2Mb Chip RAM
4Mb Fast RAM (Hopefully up to 8Mb soon ;^)
80Mb  HDD used for Workbench/Comms
430Mb HDD used for Applications/Graphics
1084S Monitor (Soon to be MultiSync ;^)
Going to buy a new mouse v.soon ( LBM is on its way out <8^( )

Software in use;
DPain(t) AGA,
Brilliance (upgrading to v2 v.soon)
ADPro v2.5
ImageFX,
Scenery Animator
Lightwave v3.0a (AKA LightRave) (soon upgade to v4)

Hope to hear from you.

Cheers,

AMOS Listserv
=============


 A good idea, but don't let it stop you also uploading files to aminet. Ryan, could you provide FTP access to the files sent to the listserv?



Guest niftp (command usually called  cpf, hhcp, fcp):
=====================================================

I haven't a clue what they are, I just copied the file from the README at src.
If you have any of them, you now know you can use them on aminet. Otherwise,
don't worry - it they were that good, they'd be more popular.


>Also, Andy, is it possible to get the intuition extension to support MUI?
==========================================================================

MUI needs kickstart 2.04+, and anyone who has this should immediately
download /dev/gui/mui21usr.lha, /dev/gui/mui21dev.lha, and /dev/amos/Am-Mui10.lha
which I am about to upload, then you will have you interface problems solved.

As for andy's intuition extension, you can put the MUI windows on screens opened
with it, but for some reason, they are of the opinion that the intuition screen
only has 2 colours. Other programs on amos intuitions publics screens also do
this - the word 'bug' springs to mind.


Speaking of bugs...
===================

I have also uploaded a fixed version of the variable checker which solves
the "B mod 2" problem pointed out by ben marty. /dev/amos/VarCheck101.lha

You could also use Grab 3 or the upcoming Grab 4 (with animation) to 
automatically grab all the enclosed objects from the screen.  
Automatically sets the hot spots, etc.  So if you go and make a change on 
the iff in dpaint, then go back into Grab, it automatically cuts them all 
out again, incorporating the change.  Its a good program.  Not PD

Ryan, PLAYFIELD!

I wrote this rather neat little program called `Insult-o-matic' this
morning. You can use it to generate random insults to add to your
.sig file.

Just like this one:

 `---------------------------------------- dom@dynamo.demon.co.uk ----'

or this one:

 .--------------------------------------------------------------------.
 |   Get your dodgy flamingo off my football!                         |

If anyone wants it, I'll upload the (AMOS Pro _ONLY_) source code. You
can edit it to suit your tastes (or distastes), and insult everyone
you send mail to! (Or news of course.)

See ya!

This may be tough one: (hope not)

I'm currently making an fx program w/ Amos Pro.
I'd like to include into it a sound sensing system...
I have a stereo digitizer in my parallel port (Golem if U
want to know). How can I make it work together w/ my AMOS
PROgram?
Do I have to activate the digitizer somehow?
And when done what I will be getting back?
My guess is that all these sounddigitizers have the
same 'language' or how is it?

Show me some AMOSPOWER!

most likely.  I'm really looking into doing a home page on the web.
I'd like to make a PLAYFIELD! home page with progs and tips people can 
submit to.  Build a nice info database...  Please send me your home page 
for amos, or point me at it please.

How many users are using a graphic client for the web? (I fear not too many?)

Gee, a half hour day!!!  Heh heh.
I'm only part time (two days a week), but my hours are 7:30 to 3:30.
Just think how lucky you are to get the extra sleep (I have to get up at
6am!).

  Use uuencode and uudecode.  The Amiga versions can be found on AmiNet

Try something like this:

Cls 0

   If S>THRESH
      Colour 1,Rnd(4095) : Wait Vbl

Loop 
----Cut Here----

I don't know if it will work with your sampler, but it works with mine.
Try adjusting the THRESH value if it doesn't work properly.

Hello everyone,
I was away from the list the last six weeks.

Is there anything important to be known ?

Is an intuition and/or an AGA extension available now ?
If yes could you tell me where I can find them.

Thank you very much.

Status: RO

Following my last mail-shot asking if anybody required GFX for their
programs, I have this to say (and I should have said it originally)

To save alot of initial to-and-fro-ing between me and you (whoever
wants the gfx) PLEASE give me as much information on the style,
look and feel that you wish to gfx the invoke.
Other information is also necessary;

What size (in pixels) do you want your sprites?
Are there any special frames of anim other than walking (ie. jump,
punch, kick, vomit, moon, copulate, etc, etc.8^)?
What degree of gore am I allowed to incorporate (lots, hopefully)?
How many frames of anim am I limited to?
What is the maximum number of colours for the sprite and BG map/tiles?
What direction would the character be viewed from (top/side/back front)?

You get the gist?

OK. I've had several request for GFX within the first day of post, so
if I can't do yours, it's because I'm too busy. 

But please don't be afraid to ask :^)

Right, hear from y'all soon.
G.

AMOS Has never had a problem loading a DCTV picture, I used one for about 
6 months without any problems, just don't let the picture go above screen 
position 28 or was it 26, because it then screws up.

' Uses AMOS Pro specific "Exec" command to run the AmigaDos echo 
' command to create the sig file. Looks for the default config file:-
' s:insult.config, or an alternative file specified in the command line

' names / insults for different types of mail or news. You must not alter
' the format of the config file, but you can have up to 100 of each type

Subject: 3D realtime rendered Polygon

From: OdaMan the AMIGA <odaman@rocky.unoke.pfu.fujitsu.co.jp>
Status: RO

Hi, all.

I made program to display 3D realtime rendered Polygon graphics.
And it has custom Copper list.

	Can I upload it to this list with LHa and uuencode??


Of course, I'll erase music from it to make it small.  I want
advices from you about this program.  I think this speed is
limit of AMOSPro, if someone can make it more FAST, let me know.

It has very wonderful Copper.  You'll watch very beautiful Copper.
There are 13 polygons with 16 shaded colours with 16x16=256 shaded
colours in its background, and it runs on normal AMIGA!!  But I
recommend you fast MPU(over 68020/14Mhz.  I made it on my A1200).
Because Polygons and "making copper list on AMOS" needs more MPU power.

If you have AMOS-compiler, COMPILE IT AND RUN!!  I don't have
compiler, so it is quite slow, but if it is compiled, I think it is
more and more FASTER!!


If someone says me "don't put large data on this list", I'll not
put this program.


OK, if someone want to say about it, mail me.
Or reply it if I can put quite large data on this list.

Bye!!

Hi, all.

I got analog joystick for PC/AT.  This joystick has 2 buttons and
15pin connector.  If someone know how connect it to AMIGA, let me
know.
And I want to know how to access it on AMOS if I can connect it to
AMIGA.


Thanks for your reading!!  :)

Amiga pages:

Commodore Amiga Information Resources

These two pages point to all other Amiga pages that I know of.
Maybe this is something for in the FAQ, Michael?

I know there are hardware devices that will connect them.  I don't know what
the hack is, if there is one to do it without the hardware.

My programming partner and I are writing a horse racing prediction
system in AMOS. He knows a journalist on the UK magazine `Personal
Computer World', and this journalist has written a full page article
about our program in the current (September 94) issue of the mag.

Now, this journalist has received a call from someone on the top
British `society' magazine, `The New Statesman', who is interested in
our program!

I don't know if they're going to do an article on it, but if they do
I think I'll have to start getting ready for my TV interviews... :)

Yeah, this code has 70Kb over size, so I don't upload it to this
list.

Unfortunately, I don't have way to upload to AmiNET.

Oh, very Thanks!!  But(again), I can't mail to only UK...  I don't
know reason why, I can't.  So I reply to this list.

Hello all I'm a new memeber to the list and because I'm new to AMOSPRO 
and a general programing newbie so I ask a little tolerance if my 
question seem obvious...now onto my question:

I'm working to automate a roleplaying game, the game system is of my own 
design as well.  but my first question is twofold, I need to know if 
anyone has something like a CASE statement for amos, or if one exists and 
I've somehow missed it.  this would make life doing random tables alot 
easier I get alittle tired of all the elseifs needed.

secondly I like to make tables that are used by the computer for results 
(like weapons and armor and monsters etc) user alterable so that they are 
in a easy to read format, when I've used the random access files I have 
been inable to alter the contents and still have the file work.
am I missing something that should be plain or is it not possible in AMOS

thanks I hope I have stated this as clearly as possible, if not ask me 
for clarifictions.

I vote yes.  If someone objects can you just email ME a copy (with music)?
I wrote a similar program in Amos Creator last year and I'd like to
compare the two.

  If you want a file to be easily understood and modified by humans, the
best way to go is a text file.  I'm not quite sure what you're trying to
do, but in my own RPG, I need lists of data for lots of things - treasures,
doors, items, etc.  What I do is to create a special file which contains
those things in an easy-to-read format, then use a special program which
takes that file and converts it into one that is easy to use for the
program (i.e. binary data).

  If this isn't what you wanted, please explain further.

Hello,

Somebody, please - tell me how to get my email to the list faster than 5
hours! Does every1 have this problem? If I send a mail in the morning (UK),
I recieve it, with the replies from people late afternoon.
Could it be that the mail is only sent on the internet at specific times
during the day?
If I mail a specific address will it get there faster than if I mailed to
this list?

Does any1 want an AMOS tone dialer? I have made one !!

Mike - Soz, can't FAX today I 4got to bring INDI's FAX number to work
today!! I'll do it tomorrow. :(

Where do you get Kickstart 3.1?, and is that THE kickstart 3.1? When did it
come out, is it software/hardware and is it good? Questions, questions...

I suppose that as Commodore's R&D is actually based in the US, so u over
there are likely to get it first.

Want 2 know about sound SAMPLERS?

Right...    (the following gets jumbled up cos of a dodgy old KeaTerm)

Peeking the parallel port at address $BFE101 will return u a number roughly
between -250 to 250, I'm not definite cos its been a while. This number is
the volume level coming into the Amiga, well its not really the volume but
u can use it as that.

Try:

Do
   F=Peek($BFE101)
   Print At(0,0);"Sound Level:";f
Loop

Right, that will get you the "volume" of the sound coming into the sampler
- make sure you have some music coming in - amplified! You can then make it
so that when the input source is quiet the value is low, by subtracting
however much it is off f, thus:

Do
   F=Peek($BFE101)-130               130 is just an example number, okay?
   Print At(0,0);"Sound Level:";f
Loop

Then u can put in an if statement, so IF the value of f is over,say, 100
then screen flashes - u can do that, its not hard.

NOTE: Not all sound samplers use address $bfe101 it could be different.
Play about and see what address work best - b careful though! Save first!

Any Questions?.....

Unfortunately, not in the default set of commands.  There is a simple one in the
AMOS CLUb extension.  However, you must be a member of the AMOS CLUB UK to get
a copy of it.  :(

Well, it is quite possible to alter the contents of random access files, which
is their main purpose.  Perhaps you can explain what you did to alter them?

would you be able to implement the case using on procs or on gosubs?  If 
I saw a segment of code, i could probably make it a bit more readable 
using on procs (probably ;-)

Thats ok, except for the possibility that their is a LOT of data - text 
files are extremely slow to load and then you'd have to convert.  It'd be 
better to use random access files, you'd need only a few blocks of data 
in memory at a time, could access new rooms easily...

I'm going to start the web site probably this weekend.  I'd like to make 
it a place we can all get some source - an archive for AMOS users...  But 
before I do that, I would like to know how many of us are able to 
traverse the web...  If your system has lynx or you are using any type of 
browser you should be able to get to the site.
If you are email only, then you're out of luck, sorry... 

I'd like response from people that think this is a good idea, can access 
it, whatever.  Just reply to rscott@gate.net and give me some feedback.  
I'll be more inclined to do this if I get positive feedback.

Ryan, PLAYFIELD!

  The idea is to do the conversion *separately* from running the main
program.  The conversion would only have to be done once for each text
data file (unless it was changed), and the main program could read the
converted data in and process it quickly.  I would never use text files as
actual data files - as you said, they're far too slow.

	I thought since the random insulter has been posted, some of you might
be interested in a non-insulting funny sentence maker (whose grammar is
always right... I think).  Sometimes the sentences don't make any sense
(incompatible prepositions & verbs), but the grammar, I believe, is always
correct.  (I hope this works right...)

	I should tell you all (whoever's interested in random sentence making)
that that program opens the printer port so if you don't have a printer

Here are some examples of output:
My unusual second was stupidly stuffing this silly music around these disagreeable refrigerators for all to see.
Some silly floors are foolishly smelling the wet wristwatches.
Some kind stuffing directs a impossible wad through my disagreeable foam.
A disagreeable book regrettingly sits to my bouncy juice.
The dry jokes cried to this sleepy tongue whenever.
A kind mouse was blowing to that distant skin pronto.
My hard cloth is creating this disagreeable toejam.
My boring knobs were promptly forcing some wet mice toward that kind dirt.

Ok, yes I wanted a form of text file that user can alter or different 
files can be used for different game world, you metioned exactly what I 
wanted, BUT I need to be able to access this file randomly, so how would 
I go about do this so that the files that the computer uses can be alter 
easily by the user, I've tried forcefeeding the program text from a file 
it did not create (a random access file) and it didnt go over very well.
Once I get this block out of my way I'll be ready to link the utils to 
menus and add all the other goodies...

On the matter of a CASE statement, before I started using random access 
files I was using a real simple if..elseif loop to give me the random 
results I needed for character generation, these loops pull up looks, 
occupations, skills etc and make it a very long program when I know it 
doesnt have to be....I saw the insult-o-matic file and that looks closer 
to what I was trying to do, but I need the tables alterable easily by non 
AMOS users....

hope I made that clear enough, and thank you all for the help you've give 
me so far!

Hello!

After finding out another problem I now realise what the hell is going on.
Thanx to every1 who replied when they finally got my mails, the reason of
the slowness was due to three reasons :

1 - The internet gateways at my work got congested - yes, congested!
2 - It takes a while for my mails to get to the US in the first place.
3 - PC's are crap. Hang on, how did that get there??

I'm quite glad a few of my mails actually bounced - u lot will never seem

Erm, you broke off a bit. What were u trying to say. If D0-D7 refers to

I have just found the PC version of UUENCODE on the network at my real
work. I can definitly use the program (do I include checksums?).

NOTE: How do u use Kermit transfer?, there are loads of options and after I
have selected the file to send it doesn't ask me for a destination. I
think.

Cant! I dont have FTP, etc. I could to some1 who did though....

Random access files are by default not user modifyable, because 
there will always be users that do not stick to the instructions. 
However, AMOS does have the possibility to randomly access 
sequential files. I do not know the name of the instruction that 
does this, so lets say it's called grab(N) where N can be anything 
between 1 and the length of the file. Grab(n) will set the point 
where Amos will start to read the file to N.

Now suppose your file                  ...and this is what
looked originally like:            the user has done to it:

   123456789                           123456789
00 #1name:Go                        00 #1name:Th
10 rf #2stre                        10 e Great O
20 ngth:-1 #                        20 ne #2stre

As you can see, it is quite readable (I hope :-)), but random 
access would not work, because your RPG would expect the strength 
paramater to start at position 26 and the user has tampered with 
the file.
That's where the grab() command (it really is not called that, look 
up the real command in your manual) comes in. You grab(14) -in the 
original file this is where '#2strength' is- and then read in say, 
the next 10 characters. In the string you get this way you look for 
the #2 sign. If you find it you will know where to find the 
strength parameter. If you find #3 you will have to jump back to 
grab(4) and if you do not find anything or just #1, you will have 
to jump forward.

Although this method is the only one I know of that allows for 
randomly accessing user-definable files, it is far from foolproof.

Personally, I would go for the extra work and design an editor for 
the programme.

The ugly option, but the easiest to implement and maybe also the 
friendliest to the user would be to store all your information in 
many little files instead of one big one.

I thought US and UK tones were different. Does the program account
for this, or does it just work in the UK?

If I had written Insult-o-matic "nicely", I would have used ON....GOSUB
instead of lots of If...End If statements. But then Insult-o-matic was
never designed to be "nice".

Status: RO

	Just to put my two one-hundredths of a dollar's worth in:

An empty string (or null character) is the least you can have.  Hence,
the traditional != (not equal) in basic "<>" is one character too
long.

	If A$>"" is exactly the same as If A$<>""!! 

thank you for your time

Content-Length: 1031
Status: RO

	Hey Everyone!  Version 1.25b of TechnoVenture has bee Uploaded to
Aminet.  This game won the Playfield! programming contest so, if you haven't,
I suggest you try it.  I realized that powerpacking it caused many problems
on some Amigas so in this version, it is no longer powerpacked (or did I do
that AFTER I uploaded it?)  so if you have a powerpacked version of Techno-
Venture (less than 100k), try running it backwards through Powerpacker and
then saving it (nothing special about running it backwards, just load and
save), then see if it works.
	IF YOU GET TECHNOVENTURE, be SURE to read the text that is
displayed when you run it at some point or another (the same text that you
can double-click to read from Workbench) because it tells you how to load
other maps, save games, record games, control speed and more!
	I'd like to hear back from anyone who tries TechnoVenture.  I hope
someday that there will be many more maps out there created by all of you
so I can know what it's like to play a map I've never seen before.

I just ran a little test on this:

Multi No 
A$="sdfsdf"
G=Timer
For T=1 To 500000
   H=A$<>""
Next T
Print Timer-G;"<>"
G=Timer
For T=1 To 500000
   H=A$>""
Next T
Print Timer-G;">"
Multi Yes 

(you can skip the Multi No, Yes if you don't have TURBO PLUS)

The results when compiled:
728<>
738>

Its just a tiny little bit *slower*.  Why, I don't know.  Thats AMOS for you.

  Not quite.  For integers, all comparisons would be equal, since all that's
required, in a compiled program anyway, is a CMP (compare) and a Bcc
(conditional branch) instruction.  For strings, an equality comparison is
relatively quick - you just need to compare the lengths and, if necessary,
the strings themselves; a less-than/greater-than comparison requires each
character of the string to be checked until an inequality is found.  In the
case of the null string, there's not much actual difference, but I'd bet that
if you used two strings like "asdfgh" and "asdh", the '>' comparison would
take significantly longer than the '<>' comparison.

I hate to say it but I doubt it was done that way.  Most likely a more 
general purpose way was developed that was much slower.  I would like to 
*hope* it was done by first comparing lengths...

Make your screen slightly larger than the playing area and reduce the 
visible size :

Screen Open 0,352,200,32,Lowres
Screen Display 0,,,320,

then when a monster dies, just move the horizontal position off the screen...

(Or, alternatively, have the movement compensate itself - as you reduce 
the number of monsters, increase the number of frames of animation.  More 
complicated, but more elegant, too...)

  For one thing, compile!  It dramatically increases the execution
speed of your program.

  If you need consistent timing in this kind of situation, you should
use the Wait Vbl command at the end of your loop.  This way, once all
the operations are done, AMOS will wait until the next vertical blank
interal - the blank area at the top of the screen - no matter how long
your main loop took.  If your main loop takes longer than a single VBL
(1/50 second in PAL, 1/60 second in NTSC), you'll need something like
the following:

Do
   TIME1=Timer
   ...
   While TIME1+X>Timer : Wait Vbl : Wend
Loop

where X is the maximum number of VBLs your main loop takes to complete.
To determine this, add the following to your program:

'Initialisation stuff

_MAX_TIME=0

'Main loop
Do
   TIME1=Timer
   ...
   Wait Vbl
   TIME2=Timer-TIME1
   If TIME2>_MAX_TIME Then _MAX_TIME = TIME2
Loop

  After your program has run for a while, quit it (or break it with
Control-C) and, in Direct mode, enter "Print _MAX_TIME".  This will
give you the value of X your code needs.

Sami,

There are a few different ways.

1. You can speed your game up enought that it always goes at 60/50 FPS,
then a Wait VBL will keep it at a constant speed.  But this isn't always
possible.

2. Time the main loop each time it runs (if it runs fairly slowly then
this will work prety well), and if it runs in less than a certian number
of VBLs then Wait some more VBLs.  That will keep a comstant speed,
bu it'll always be as slow as with lots of enemies on screen.

3. Re-code your game so that all speeds and X/Y Co-ords are recorded in
some portion of one pixel.  Say in 1/16ths of a pixel.  So if you wanted
an enemy at screen X position 100, it's internal X Co-ord would be 1600.
Then you just divide each X/Y Co-ord by 16 in the Bob command.  To make
this all work, you time how long the main loop takes each time it loops,
and you use that number to move your objects.  Then if your loop starts
out taking, say, 4 VBLs to run, then later on with less enemies it takes
2 VBLs to run, then things will be moving half as much each frame and
they will appear to be moving the same speed as before.

OK now I've had two suggestions that sound really good, one is to write a 
seperate editor for my files, that sounds really good to me, 'cept for 
one little detail...I havent a clue on how to go about it!

the second suggestion said that random lines can be pulled by useing a 
command (walks across room for manual) and I cant find any command that 
even reads close to that! anyone know the command that was metioned?

Thanks again for everyone help, I was going to assci dump my code tonight 
but it seems I got my idea across well enough now.

Gee and I thought I picked something nice and simple to start with...but 
at least once I get this part done I'm home free
thanks again

	Perhaps the reason that "<>" is quicker than ">" is because "<>" IS
A SINGLE OPERATOR.  It's just represented by two characters in BASIC-like
languages.  It's a lot easier to check if two things are equal than it is
to check whether it's greater or less than.  I'm assuming that when the line
with "<>" is tokenized, the "<>" is tokenized as a single keyword meaning
"not equal to."

	If you use Wait VBL, I think you can control the speed of the
monsters without slowing them down to start with.  That is unless displaying
all the monsters takes more than 1/60th of a second.  Wait VBL will just wait
until the beam reaches the bottom of the monitor before continuing, therefore,
if your program finished the update early, it will wait longer and if it
finishes late, it will wait shortly, as long as it hasn't taken so long that
the beam has returned to the top.  If it does take more than 1/60th of a
second, you may want to keep track and make sure that all updates take the
same number of 60th's of a second using Timer.  So for instance if it takes
3/60ths of a second for all the monsters to update at the beginning, do this:
Set Temporary variable = Timer
Update
Wait 3-(Timer-Temporary variable)  (maybe + 1?)

	I haven't thought about all this very carefully so anybody feel free
to comment.

On possiblity is to not turn him off, but to place him offscreen.  During 
the monster control routines, if the monster is off screen, it just skips 
past the control code.  The slowest part is drawing the monster on 
screen, not the control code, generally, so by keeping him on screen the 
speed should stay more constant.  

Another possibility is to set V=Timer at the beginning of the main loop, 
then when you get to the end of the main loop, Repeat: Until Abs(Timer-V) 
>= 2 will keep the main loop running at 2 or move vbls.  It should make 
it consistently one speed (slow!)   I prefer method 1!

Here's ANOTHER way of doing it which gets slightly more complicated, but 
I'll try and explain it sensibly...  Basically, you assign a velocity to 
each monster, say 16 pixels a second, then time each screen redraw and 
adjust their speed-per-frame accordingly, like this.

SPEED=16
F=16
Do
   A=Timer
   For N=1 to NUMBER_OF_MONSTERS
      ' Update BOb position with X=X+(SPEED/F) and Y=Y+(SPEED/F)
      ' The longer each frame takes to draw, the further each BOb
      ' will move in one frame.
      Bob N,X,Y,
   Next N
   ' Rest of routine goes here
   F=(Timer-A)/50
   ' Change this to 60 for NTSC.  This has the advantage of making the game
   ' play at exactly the same speed on NTSC and PAL machines, and even
   ' on accelerated machines...
Loop

It needs a bit of tidying up, but I tried it out earlier and it works 
more or less.

I have started the web site for AMOS - it can be accessed with any web 
browser like lynx or mosaic or whatever you use.  Its JUST begun so don't 
expect it to even *work*, but go ahead and give it a go.  I'd like lots 
of feedback and lots of participation.  Keep in mind I work a *lot* so 
don't expect rapid fire miracles or bug fixes.

I'd like it to be a repository of information for AMOS - a more permanent 
fixture than the mailing list.  I want to incorporate *everything*, like 
pointers to the mailing list archive, how to sub, programs you wish to 
contribute, graphics for games, advert for yourself if you can do 
graphics, coding damn near whatever you want.  I won't restrict much 
unless it gets out of hand!  

Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.

Remember, I just started so its just a minor beginning.  I want feedback 
on all of it - how its arranged, what you'd like to see, etc.  I figure 
we can discuss it on the mailing list, unless there are major objections 
to it.  I can't set up a mailing list here yet but if its necessary, I 
will move it to one at the earliest possible time.

BTW: I am going to solicit other sites to point to it, even some 
commercial ones because I'd like to sell some of PLAYFIELD!' stuff on it, 
so we should get some visits.

Ryan, PLAYFIELD!

You should also consider whether you want your game to run faster on faster
machines. With method 1, the code will run faster on faster machines
(but still at a consistent speed). Method 2 slows your program so there
is a constant delay between updates, no matter how fast the machine
(apart from the fact that Timer units are 1/60th sec on an NTSC machine
and 1/50th sec on PAL machines).

Also, Roach Motel was originally written using plain vanilla AMOS 
commands.  When enemies died or were not on screen, they were OFF.  It 
wasn't that noticable on an A500.  When I went through and converted all 
the map lookup Functions to Scene Check commands, and map pokes to Scene 
Changes, the program ran so fast that the fact that there were no bobs on 
screen really made the program *fly*.  It became unplayable, actually, it 
ran so fast.  It would run like crazy until the enemies came out, then 
run considerably slower.  It was both a tribute to TURBO PLUS and a vivid 
demonstration of the complete lack of speed in the AMOS Bob commands.  

This is the reason there is no Roach Motel TURBO floating around - it 
requires rewriting to use method 1 - keeping the bobs somewhere offscreen 
instead of just turning them off.  I think I will do Roach Motel TURBO, 
but when the bob commands are sped up to the same degree the icons are.  
Then I don't think I'll have to use method 2 - the bobs will be about up 
to the speed they should be.

A person that bought my extension wrote to me with the same problem..  I 
think that there is an address you have to toggle first to wake the 
sampler up.  I'll have a look at the letter at home tonight and post the 
results (if any)

I have just written my first demo in Amos,  called Narcosis Its 
been uploaded to

Aminet (wuarchive site) but how long it takes is another matter.

Needs a A1200 of 1.5MB on 1.3 (run it from workbench) Its powerpacked.

If it does work for you, any feedback appreciated.

Subject: Zappo CD-ROM
To: amos-list@access.digex.net
Status: RO

Hello,

I have made this mail global incase any1 else is interested in buying a
Zappo CDROM for the 1200 from Indi Computing, UK.

I faxed INDI several days ago for Mike C, and I have only just recieved a
reply, it came last Friday though.

Indi said:

"I have recieved a request from a Mr. M Cox to fax a price of the CD-ROM
for the A1200 over to you, the price would be 165.95 UK pounds after the
VAT has been deducted [over here we have to pay VAT!! Jam.] , then the
delivery via Datapost International would cost 30 pounds extra"

In other words any1 in the US has to pay the same as what we pay in the UK,
you lose the tax but have to pay for shipping. I hope there are no other
additional costs as they didn't mention what taxes u have to pay in the US.

Any questions?

Random access files are by default not user modifyable, because 
there will always be users that do not stick to the instructions. 
However, AMOS does have the possibility to randomly access 
sequential files. I do not know the name of the instruction that 
does this, so lets say it's called grab(N) where N can be anything 
between 1 and the length of the file. Grab(n) will set the point 
where Amos will start to read the file to N.

Now suppose your file                  ...and this is what
looked originally like:            the user has done to it:

   123456789                           123456789
00 #1name:Go                        00 #1name:Th
10 rf #2stre                        10 e Great O
20 ngth:-1 #                        20 ne #2stre

As you can see, it is quite readable (I hope :-)), but random 
access would not work, because your RPG would expect the strength 
paramater to start at position 26 and the user has tampered with 
the file.
That's where the grab() command (it really is not called that, look 
up the real command in your manual) comes in. You grab(14) -in the 
original file this is where '#2strength' is- and then read in say, 
the next 10 characters. In the string you get this way you look for 
the #2 sign. If you find it you will know where to find the 
strength parameter. If you find #3 you will have to jump back to 
grab(4) and if you do not find anything or just #1, you will have 
to jump forward.

Although this method is the only one I know of that allows for 
randomly accessing user-definable files, it is far from foolproof.

Personally, I would go for the extra work and design an editor for 
the programme.

The ugly option, but the easiest to implement and maybe also the 
friendliest to the user would be to store all your information in 
many little files instead of one big one.

  If this "1" is really there (it wasn't when I tried), that could explain
AMOS's floating point problems - the hexadecimal values you list are not
equal to the corresponding decimal values!

  Anyway, this is standard Motorola Fast Floating Point (FFP) format:

	3      2       1
Bit #	1......4.......6.......8.......0
        --------mantissa--------SEEEEEEE

  The mantissa is a binary value with an assumed binary point after the first
digit.  It can theoretically take on any value from 0 to just under 2, but is
normally not less than 1 (except in the special case of 0).

  S is the sign bit, 0 for positive or 1 for negative.

  EEEEEEE is the 7-bit exponent, biased by 65 ($41).  In other words, to find
the actual exponent, subtract 65 from the biased exponent.

  (For those of you who aren't familiar with scientific notation, it takes
the form (mantissa) * (base)^(exponent), where the mantissa is a value at
least 1 but less than the base [except in the case of 0].)

  For the curious, here are the IEEE single- and double-precision formats:
(AMOS Pro uses IEEE double precision when you execute Set Double Precision)

	3      2       1
Single:	1......4.......6.......8.......0
        SEEEEEEEE--------mantissa-------

S = sign bit
EEEEEEEE = 8-bit exponent, bias 127

	6      5       4       4       3       2       1
Double:	3......6.......8.......0.......2.......4.......6.......8.......0
        SEEEEEEEEEEE----------------------mantissa----------------------

S = sign bit
EEEEEEEEEEE = 11-bit exponent, bias 1023

  In both of these formats, the mantissa has an assumed 1 and a binary
point at the left, so a mantissa value of "000..." is actually "1.000...".

To whom it may concern :)

I am doing some GFX for R.Scott to go on the Amos WWW site.

My question is;

Is there a standard palette layout for WWW pages? (Bit like in WB)
Otherwise, how do different .gif's look OK when loaded.

Maybe I'm just being dumb, but need to know ASAP.

To all who answer; Thanks, I'll buy you a beer if I ever in your area ;^)

TTFN,

Hello again Ryan, and one more time (sorry!) could you send me the cost of
Turbo Extension and the subscription to Playfield! again? I think this time
I will got money (hope!). And please the payment metod. I promise save
the reply and dont't ask you again! :-)

If you are searching for some graphics for your mosaic, please  tell me, I

I a review two months ago was written that the Archos Overdrive CD
(exactly the same as the Zappo drive) doesn't work with a GVP TurboII
A1230 board.

In other reviews they didn't point out any problem like that one.
The developpers at Archos said the the first review never tested it and that
there never was a problem with a GVP Board.

So is anyone out there using a such drive with a GVP A1230 TurboII board ???

The drive is available at 1990 french francs, you can deduct 17 percent of VAT
if you don't live in the EC. However I don't know how much they want for PP.

Hello,

I've tried your intuition extension and I have a query about it.

When I use the Iscreen open command my machines guru's a lot. I'm using
Amos Classic on my a1200 (you should have seen my stats on some of my mails
if not 030-40/4mb fast/80m hd) and it guru's all programs that you have
made on that LHA file.
This is how I tried to open an intuit screen:

Screen Close 0
Iscreen Open 1,320,256,32,256+AGA,"Test Screen"
Amos To Back    ----------- [Note I have put ATB b4 and after Iscreen Open]
Do
   Multi Wait
Loop

Am I correct in putting AGA after the 256 colours?
Please help!!!!

Also:
In the help file here's an idea : why do you put some examples with certain
commands, ie. the more complex ones.

I want to move my AMOS Pro directory to another drive.  I copied it over
easily enough, but it still sees things as being on my first drive and makes
all the assigns to it.  Where is this info located?  I only saw one reference
to my original location, and I changed it but no luck.  :(

Or, would it be easier to make the assigns in my user-startup?  Will AMOS
overwrite them?
