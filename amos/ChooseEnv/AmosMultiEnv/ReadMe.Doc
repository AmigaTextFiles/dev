Disclaimer:

	The program PatchAMOS will modify your AMOS1.3 program.
	I take no resposibility if it wreck's it - make sure you
        have a backup.

	I also take no responsibilty explicitly, implicity, and all
        that other legal crap if something else that you didn't want
        to happen does, 'cos i'm in an irresponsible mood today!


Distribution:

	Whatever - modify / copy / hack to pieces. Please post me
	back any improvements - these are my first E programs, so
	the sources can probably be improved.
	

Files:

	Amos			A Script file to load AMOS.
	Amos.info		An Icon To Execute the script.
        GetAMOSEnv		A Program to select an envoironment.
        PatchAMOS		A Program to modify AMOS1.3.
	Readme.Doc		This File.

	GetAMOSEnv.e		The Sources 	
	PatchAMOS.e		

Requirements:

	AMOS V1.36 - NOT AMOSV1.3,AMOSV1.34,AMOSV1.35 etc. A few
	bytes are overwritten in the AMOS program file - they may
        be at a different location in different versions of AMOS.

	ReqTools Library - Any version will probably work - I only
        use the file requester.


Overview:

	When you load AMOS, it searches for one the files:

		:AMOS_System/AMOS1_3_Pal.Env
		:AMOS_System/AMOS1_3_Ntsc.Env

	And loads the appropriate one for your country. These files
	contain your amos configuration. Running PatchAMOS modifies
        AMOS so it only searches for T:AMOS1_3.Env

	GetAMOSEnv opens a reqtools filerequester in your AMOS_System
        directory from which you can select an envoironment to copy to
        T:AMOS1_3.Env


Hard disk Installation:

	1) Make sure you have a backup of the file AMOS1.3.

	2) Run PatchAMOS, and select the AMOS1.3 file.

	3) Copy the file Amos, Amos.info and GetAMOSEnv to
	   your main AMOS directory.

	4) Edit the first three lines of the script file, Amos,
           with your favourite editor:

	Line 1 - C:Assign T: RAM:T

	    Usually this is already done. Remove this line if so


	Line 2 - C:Assign AMOS_DAT: HOME:Amos

	    Not required by this system - I just like to assign
            a device to where I keep my AMOS programs.


	Line 3 - GetAMOSEnv SYS:AMOS_System

	    If your amos_system drawer is somewhere else, change
	    the path.
 
	5) Delete the AMOS1_3.info file.


Floppy disk installation:

	Follow the same procedure as the hard disk installation,
	but if you normally load AMOS directly from the startup
	sequence, insert the script file into your startup
        sequence in place of the AMOS1.3 command.



Usage:

	Double click on the AMOS icon. 

	Select An Envoironment.


Notes / Hints:

	Create a default envoironment call AMOS1_3.Env, as this
	is the default name in the file-selector.
	
	The AMOS compiler uses the envoironment specified by it's
        own configuration files - Not the envoironment you select
	with this filerequester.


Credits:

        GetAMOSEnv, and PatchAMOS were both written in E. Thanks
        go to Wouter van Oortmerssen for a rather nice language.

	Reqtools.library is written by Nico Francois.

	And thanks to whoever it was that posted to the AMOS list
	about removing/installing extenions for the inspiration!
