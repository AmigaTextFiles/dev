It sounds like it could be trying to load extensions that are not there. Check

When  I first bought Amos Pro, a couple of my original disks (straight
from the box) were gubbed! I simply used QBack Tools and it sorted 'em
out.  I  made  backups  and  installed  it  with  ease.  I did contact
Europress  for  new  copies,  but  I  never  received  'em!  (Surprise
Surprise).

Anyway,  this isn't your problem, but I suspect you would do better if
you  totally  removed  Amos  from your HD (and any assigns) and simply
re-install from scratch.

It  seems  Amos can't find some of your required files. Maybe you have
some extensions missing or summat?

Anyway, do the above and see how you go...

Hope  this  has  been  of some help (probably a late reply, but I have
been busy), so fogive me if you already have the problem sorted.

cya, Andy

BTW Does anyone on this list think it would be immoral to send someone
new/working copies of some Amos Pro disks to replace gubbed ones? What
with  Europress buggering off and leaving us to fend for ourselves `n'
all?  I  know  it's still piracy, but surely if someone can prove they
have  the  original disks, this shouldn't be a problem? Where else can
we turn to for new copies.

And  before  anyone  says anything, I do NOT need new disks, I got 'em
from somewhere else :)

Tara...

Hi all,
does anyone know of any way of getting an icon (4col/MWB/NI) image into a 
bob?

Something along the lines of

Procedure ICONTOBOB[BOBNO,ICONNAME$]
     blah, blah
End Proc

... would be ideal.

Wayne.

Hello guys

I have a small problem that I would like some help to. I am creating
a game and on the intro-screen I would like a picture to show up.
First the palette would be $FFF on all 16 colours, but they would
slowly fade down to their origin colours. Please... I really need
a routine like that.
If you guys even get this mail then please reply on it. I'm not sure
if my mails gets to the list... =/

Well... Seeya... /Marco

The Fade command can do it. You just make the pic, then set all colours to
$fff. The use Fade Speed,Colour1,Colour2,etc.

It was on the night of 01-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Marco jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop
shouting about "Fade routine" until I was forced to knock them out:
-> Hello guys

-> I have a small problem that I would like some help to. I am creating
-> a game and on the intro-screen I would like a picture to show up.
-> First the palette would be $FFF on all 16 colours, but they would
-> slowly fade down to their origin colours. Please... I really need
-> a routine like that.
-> If you guys even get this mail then please reply on it. I'm not sure
-> if my mails gets to the list... =/

Here are 2 small progs which you may find usefull, for both IFF pictures, and
bobs+icons.

Here's 2 examples of how to do this:

-------------------------------
Screen open 0,640,256,16,hires
Rem Load your gfx here
Dim C(16)
For i=0 to 15
   c(i)=colour(i) : Rem Save current palette in c()
   colour i,$FFF : Rem Set current palette to $FFF
next i
Rem Fade to saved palette at speed 5
fade
5,c(0),c(1),c(2),c(3),c(4),c(5),c(6),c(7),c(8),c(9),c(10),c(11),c(12),c(13),
c(14),c(15)
-------------------------------
Screen open 0,640,256,16,hires : Screen hide 0
Ink 4 : Bar 10,10 To 50,50 : Rem Load your gfx here
Screen open 1,640,256,16,hires
Screen copy 0 To 1 : Screen 1 : Rem Copy  the contents of screen 0 to Screen
1
For i=0 to 15
   Colour I,$FFF : Rem Set palette to $FFF on screen 1
Next i
Fade 5 To 0 : Rem Fade screen 1 to the palette of screen 0 at speed 5
-------------------------------

Hope this helps,

        // Mike

     I have a problem linking a listview and text gadjet, which Pietro is 
     aware of and looking into for me.  So at the moment I have written a 
     simple piece of code to replace the link.
     
     Basically what I want to do is display the slected item from the 
     listview in a text gadget.  It works fine only whenever I select the 
     first item in the listview it will not display it.  Every other item 
     is diplay without a problem.  The code is as follows......
     
     S_VCE$=Gui Read$(1,0)
     If Gui Read(1,0) the Gui Set 1,9,0,Varptr$(S_VCE$)
     
     To test the workings of this code I also added Gui Text 250,200,S_VCE$ 
      which also displays the selected item.  This does display the first 
     item in the listvew when selected.
     
     Any ideas what is going wrong?

I read you clearly :)

It can be done with something like this:

'if your screen is nr. 0
'open a small screen, use same screen mode and nr. of colours..
screen open 1,32,2,c,res
screen 1 : get screen palette 0
screen 0 
' now set your colours to $fff
palette $fff,$fff,$fff....
screen 0
fade speed to 1
screen close 1

Happy greetings, Yours..

I seem to be stuck on a problem of detecting bob collisions.  My 
problems is that I need to test for so many.  I have a total of 12 
(or slightly more)  objects all of which must look out for eachother. 
Putting the collision detection routine in a loop is far too slow.  
Basically I have to call the collision detection procedure 100+ times 
per frame.  Is there an ultra fast way to do this?  My game is down 
to about 2 fps.  :(   Is there any way to do it without getting a 
special extension?  Or is there and extension which would seemlessl 
fit into my current program?  HELP!  I've been stuck on this for 
ages!

Although I am no longer on the AMOS Mailing list, I thought you might be
interested in the following info.

Audio tracks on CDs will not be playable on a standard CD player unless
they are written first.  I think I discussed this earlier, but I spoke to
many people for my own knowledge and they all said the same thing.  On a
Computer CD player it does not matter, but in a Car stereor, Stack system,
Boom Box, etc.  If the audio tracks are not first it will be unplayable on
them.

So when doing music audio tracks lay them down first.  Then do the data
tracks.  It will be safer as some newer non computer CD players may void
this statement, but it is known that this is the preferred method.

   What sort of design are you using?
   I normally rely on an optimized program-design to achieve the speed
   in my projects, so...

   First, you need to set up your procedure _FINDHITNUM as well as
   declare the global for it...

   Procedure _FINDHITNUM[FIRST, LAST]
      HITFLAG=False : Rem  ...reset collision-flag
      Rem  Run through the Col-list to see which Bob was Hit
         For CHECKIT=FIRST To LAST
            If Col(CHECKIT)
               HITFLAG=CHECKIT : Rem  ...set flag to ID of object hit
               CHECKIT=LAST : Rem ...my way to exit a loop
            End If
         Next CHECKIT
   End Proc
  
   Global HITFLAG

   You have 12 objects which need to collide with any of the other 11,
   so using Bob Col() you can "quickly" see if an object is colliding
   with any of the others...

   This can be processed as follows:

For OBJECTNUM=0 to 11
   Rem  Is this the first object?
   If OBJECTNUM=0
      Rem  yes, so need to check only against all "higher" objects...
      If Bob Col(0, 1 To 11 )
         _FINDHITNUM[1, 11]
      End If

   Else
      Rem  Is this the last object?
      If OBJECTNUM=11
         Rem  yes, so need to check only "lower" objects...
         If Bob Col(11, 0 to 10)
            _FINDHITNUM[0, 10]
         End If
      
      Else
         Rem  ObjectToCheck is between lowest and highest, so we 
         Rem  need to perform two checks...
         Rem  One for the objects lower than OBJECTNUM...
         If Bob Col(OBJECTNUM, 0 To OBJECTNUM-1)
            _FINDHITNUM[0, OBJECTNUM-1]   
         Else
            Rem and a second for objects higher than OBJECTNUM...
            If Bob Col(OBJECTNUM, OBJECTNUM+1, 11)
               _FINDHITNUM[OBJECTNUM+1, 11]
            End If
         End If
       End If
   End If
  
   Rem  This object has been checked, so we analyze the result...
   If HITFLAG
      Rem  If here, OBJECTNUM and HITFLAG objects have collided
      Rem  so, do your processing...   
   End If
Next OBJECTNUM
    
This is a reasonably optimized design and AMOS should be able to
sort out the collisions reasonably fast... :)

Let me know how you make out!!

   Amazing isn't?  How you can write something and then later take a
   look at it and the foolishness is no very obvious...

   In my previous reply to the collision-detection I made a rather  
   stupid design, resulting in the collision-detection being MUCH
   slower than it should be, not quite sure what happened there, 
   sorry.  :)

   Anyway, the new design is:

   For OBJECT1=0 To 10
      If Bob Col(OBJECT1, OBJECT1+1 To 11)
         For OBJECT2=OBJECT1+1 To 11
            If Col(OBJECT2)
               Rem  Objects OBJECT1 and OBJECT2 have collided, so
               Rem  do your collision-processing here...
            End If
         Next OBJECT2      
      End If
   Next OBJECT1

   Now, THAT IS AN OPTIMIZED DESIGN!!!!
   
   The advantages over the first one:
  
   1.  The MAIN advantage is that each collision between any two
        objects is only performed once so we only need a total of 66
        Col checks, AND these Col checks are only performed if
        AMOS has detected a collison, so it should be VERY FAST.
   2.  The actual loop-processing is very tiny which means it will be
        quite fast.
   3.  We're no longer utilizing an external Procedure call, which also
        makes this version a bit faster.

   Finally, the whole thing is highly stream-lined and is the essence of
   creating an optimized design!!

   If this doesn't speed up your game then the problem MUST be
   something other than the collision-detection...

   Let me know what the new frame-rate is!!

Hello all,

I have been researching Serial Comms within Amos and I was wondering if
anyone had written Modem-to-Modem utilities?  Is it possible to do

Also does anyone know how to link 2 Amigas together over a phone line

Okay.. just wondering about that.
 
>> Work is almost finished with the Taxman
> Level takes priority!

Yea, yea, I know, but I have to have some enemies *FOR* my level. 
Plus, mine being the last one in the game, and him being the boss, 
AND me being one of the Graphics guys (no one having done anything up 
for him), I HAVE to do it. But yes, I see your point..

PLEASE do. It would be nice if I could chat with you one-on-one about
some things concerning the Project (last minute things, ye know)..

I take it there's no chance of pushing the either of the dates back a 
couple or days (not quite a week, but the final release?) As I said, 
I SHOULD be able to make the first date for final code, but remember, 
I JUST got this raycaster working with those features, and I'm doing 
*GOOD* to implement HALF the things I have on my To-do list for this 
next (and final) demo (and code).

Working working I am, but you may have to wait a couple more days on 
mine after Sunday (even though I'm doing everything I can night and 
day to finish it up, plus studies through the day). Anyhow, the 
optimizing part can wait (for my level) seeing as how I'm sure SOME 
of the guys MIGHT be able to speed up my code, but not many, and 
frankly I just dont have the time to wait on the extra optimizations 
from passing it around. I'm just basically asking for a little last 
minute patience.. you'll get what you want (from me and the guys).

Hi again...

I have been thinking about my Icon>BOB request and have realised that there 
may be an easier way to solve my problem.

I have a MUI program which I would like to be able to display the WB Icon of 
a program.
I am using the Easylife extension.
My original idea was to convert the icon into a bob which I know easylife 
will let me display using MUI.

Does anyone know if easylife will allow you to display a WB icon in the same 
manner?

Thanks, Wayne.

 Hey all, (most likely Garfield).

 Could you make me an AGA ANIM player that can load anims from disk (making the buffer larger depending on the amount of RAM), and stretch the image to fit the screen (IE: 160x128 would be double (2x2) to fit the screen)?

 It would need to be script based, and proboly need to be able to play a mod.. Could you do this and keep the animation speed ABOVE 12.5 fps? (25 would be ideal, but its probobly not going to happen)...

 The smallest computer it would be forced to work on would possibly be a A1200 020 2meg chip and 4meg fast.

This patch is very unstable! Two Amos programs cannot run togheter! The
only method is to use the GUI Compiler... but obviously the are some
limitations :(

the first item of a listview is the number 0.... and so the above 'IF' skip
it! Just use:

S_VCE$=Gui Read$(1,0) : Gui Set 1,9,0,Varptr$(S_VCE$)

I got this letter from someone who tried to run one of my programs.
Is this true? Does compiling it with a 68020 make it bugger up on
68000's?

Subject: Fleshee 2000 Work
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: Text/Plain

Status: RO
X-Status: 

I'm currently working on a game which I have entitled Fleshee 2000.

I have done very little on the actual game coding, but am almost finished
the editor.

What I'm trying to get to is, I am having small problems dealing with
screen drawing and saving.

The screen refresh procedure for when you move from one map to the next
runs at a fairly fast speed, but it is not as fast as I need/want it to be.
Can someone give me some code to quickly draw 10X10 icons on the screen
with a grid of 29X15?

Right now I'm using this arrangement (very simple)

(Grid variable is 11)
(The Map variable is a dimensioned variable for all screen data)

For XPOS=0 to 28
   For YPOS=0 to 14
     Paste Icon XPOS*GRID,YPOS*GRID,MAP(CURMAPX,CURMAPY,XPOS,YPOS)
   Next YPOS
Next XPOS

Is there anyway to make this display faster? Such as in TechnoVenture (for
those that have played it)


My other problem deals with the saving method I am using. Basically what it
does is run through each screen and saves each little block. It will run
fine with about 10 screens or so, but when it is at 100 screens (the max
for my editor) it takes a horribly long time when it only has to save about
41K of information.

What would be the fastest way to save this assuming any map configuration
from 2X2 to 50X2 and each screen has to save 435 variables?

Mr Giark, due to the new sound routines, my level will fit into 1 meg chip,
as long as it has enough fast.  Should be ok on 2meg chip only as well.
Works best on at least 32meg fast and 2meg chip ;-)

I'm gonna need to tap in a MORE configable sound system, ie use samples in
chip mem, or use samples in fast mem.  Whatdya recon ?  It'll be (probably
unnoticably) faster on machines with more chip that way, and it'll work on
older systems, probably at a nice speed reduction.  Hang on, unless the
people with 1meg chip only have fast processors (68020+) it'll probably suck
anyway.  Hmmm.

Shall I allow for both, or convert the whole thing to 1meg chip ?  Now ALL I
gotta do is finalise the graphics and staple it all together.

In short, yes!
You will need to get your hands on one of the (many?) MUI or GUI type 
extensions which are around.

For MUI apps, I use the EasyLife extension.
I think that there is one simply called GUI but I have never actually used 
it.

Question from me...
What do people think is the easiest to use GUI extension?
Although I have been using EasyLife recently I have found that it is a 
little bit fiddly and sometimes a bit temperamental -although probably just 
due to my coding ;-)
The advantage of EasyLife though is that it allows you to create MUI apps 
which allow the user to customise them very easily to fit in with their own 
WB.

Wayne.

Hiya

I'm creating a level editor for a game and I need some routine help.

1) Is there a way to check the size of a bob?
2) Any asm-coders that can help me with an assembler-screen-copy-
   routine? The one in Amos is WAY to slow. Maybe there is a faster
   on some extension...
3) How does the 'BobspriteCol' and the 'SpritebobCol' commands work?
   Can you check collisions between the mousepointer-sprite and a bob?

That's all I can think of now... Bye

 /Marco

I haven't used Easylife for a long time, since GuiExt is out.
Moreover the bad side of easylife is that you have to distribute
easylife.library. :-(

This is rather right.
But there are also a lot of people who hate Mui... and a lot hate Amos... so,
try to give'em an Amos program that uses MUI!!! :-)))

The GUI extension (Freeware) is the the most easy to use but it sometimes
ties you a up a little. The Intuition extension gives greater control and
is still quite easy to get to work.. The JDint (PD) is useless as far as
I can see.. The best and most difficult way (personal oppinion) is the
OSdevkit extension (Comercial/Shareware ?), it gives complete control of
everything and access to many other parts of the system (locale, datatypes,
etc.), but it's quite tricky to use...

Try and visit the extension-list at my homepage to get the 'overview' :)

shouting about "screen" until I was forced to knock them out:

Its possible with the GUI extension, which should be available to the public

Stock the variables and maps in a bank (Tools extension is good at this), 
and then save the bank (save or Bsave)

NB: Turbo+ is a comercial extension..
Tools extension is PD (Aminet or my homepage..)

   Hmmm... use samples in fast mem?! 

   I'm assuming you're allocating XXX amount of ChipRAM to hold the
   sample-data for each voice then utilizing some kind of super-fast
   memory-copy to transfer the sound data from FastRAM into the
   ChipRAM voice-buffers, correct?

   Radical stuff!!!!  

   We should all submit any cool routines we've developed for our
   stages into some kind of Dev-Pool.  This way, each list game will
   have more resources to draw from and so, theoretically each list
   project will be easier to make better.  After two or three projects,
   we'd have one heck of a development-pool filled with ultra-fast,
   advanced routines and such.

   I've donated two utilities, you can pitch in your SoundPlayer and
   the other guys could pitch in a module or tool to kind of lay the
   foundation for the guys who follow us with the second ListProject...

   
      Take  care,

If you look at the AMOS manual on how the banks are stored you can
actually peek the basic values out. But you'll only get the X size to
16 pixels.

Actually, I find the screen copy routine quite reasonable. All the
other GFX things are bad though.
I find most extensions that are supposed to speed up GFX routines are
rubbish and its actually the other things that make the difference.
e.g. Using Qsqr from AMCAF has doubled the speed of one game that used
Sqr alot.

It works as it says in the manual.
You cannot detect the mouse though. A solution would be to call Hide
On and then define your own mouse with a sprite and amal which you
could then detect.

Introduction
------------
Jotre stands for Jolly THX Replayer and is an AmosPro extension you can use
to play the new THX 2.x format introduced by Dexter/Abyss a few weeks ago.
This version of Jotre handles the basic stuff like playing (obviously),
handling the volume and filterdata used by the replayer. The next version
will be able to play THX instruments next to your music (so you can use
instruments for SFX), control certain effect commands so you can time
on-screen routines to the music, and more.

Installation
------------
Please read the supplied guide how to install Jotre. It should be easy
enough for most AmosPro users.

About THX
---------
THX is a great freely distributable musicprogram with which you can create
near-C64 quality music. The latest version includes filters, and for the
next version ringmodulation is planned. If you are looking for great THX
music then look no further than   http://thx.home.ml.org   which has some
great music by various talented composers, oh and I am in there too but
don't let that stop you. THX is found in  mus/edit  on Aminet or you can
get it from the THX homepage mentioned above.



Er, and that's it. Stay fresh.


--- JaZz.

This is the fastest zoom routine I have in the library, but it is limited. See

It was on the night of 06-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Adam jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting
about "CBATNAM things." until I was forced to knock them out:
-> Greetings.

-> Thought you might want to pick up on CBATNAM, i.e. go back over some 
-> of the variables, anything else that's needed (besides all our code!) 
-> and things like that. I've had to go back and read through some old 
-> messages to get some of the variables I need to put in my code! 
-> Nonsense I say. Anyhow, it would be last-minute helpful.

-> Also, does ANYONE know of (or better yet HAVE) any FAST Zoom-like 
-> drawing routines (name off Extensions, some of which I have, or ANY 
-> Assembler). That's the only way I'm going to get my level sped up at 
-> all. I've used AMCAF, but it uses zoom factors (with Bzoom), and I 
-> dont have time to do up any equations to handle them. (Plus, Giark 
-> has to compile the code, and I'm not sure he has it. Neither do I, 
-> well, demo version, haven't registered yet, but plan to). Help!

-> Any help SOON would be appreciated. Thanks.

Greetings.

Thought you might want to pick up on CBATNAM, i.e. go back over some 
of the variables, anything else that's needed (besides all our code!) 
and things like that. I've had to go back and read through some old 
messages to get some of the variables I need to put in my code! 
Nonsense I say. Anyhow, it would be last-minute helpful.

Also, does ANYONE know of (or better yet HAVE) any FAST Zoom-like 
drawing routines (name off Extensions, some of which I have, or ANY 
Assembler). That's the only way I'm going to get my level sped up at 
all. I've used AMCAF, but it uses zoom factors (with Bzoom), and I 
dont have time to do up any equations to handle them. (Plus, Giark 
has to compile the code, and I'm not sure he has it. Neither do I, 
well, demo version, haven't registered yet, but plan to). Help!

Any help SOON would be appreciated. Thanks.

Hi there!

I need someone to draw some very easy gfx for me... very easy, but not for
me!! :-))
For more details, please email me: at the moment I just say that what I want

I hope to receive help.

Thank you very much

Hiya,

 Is there a way of editing the EBH palette ?

I tryed to with PPaint7 & the AMOS object editor but neither of them let you edit
the last 32 colours diffrently, eg. If I was to change colour 58, colour 16 would also change.

Anyone know a way around this ?



thanks,

Sounds normal enough.

Use AGA and not EHB.  (errr, that was a no by the way, these "problems" are
supposed to happen.  EHB means that the high colours are Half as Bright as
the low colours, its just a shading mask as opposed to real colours)

   EHB, stands for Extra Half-Brite mode and the name comes from 
   the design of the video-mode.

   You can change colours 0-31, but colours 32-63 will be half as brite
   as colours 0-31.

   Say you made colour 1 white with $FFF, the hardware would then 
   make colour 33 grey with $777.

   It's a neat mode really.  You have to put a bit more thought into
   palette-design, using the brightest colors for the first 32 registers, 
   but you can get some nice shadows and such.


      Take  care,

That's what EHB mode is about. The second 32 colours are the same as the first
32, only half as bright (hence the name)

It's a hardware limitation, not software.

Greetings.

Yes, change it from within AMOS if you want. (Palette$ command)

The reason for this is in EHB (Extra Half Brite mode), the Amiga 
takes its 32 color registers and SPLITS those colors (brightness) in 
half (giving 32 more colors that are HALF as bright as the FIRST 32), 
hence you have your 64 EHB color palette.

Therefore, when you change, say, color 16 as above, color 48 is going 
to change as well (16+32=48). Any of the first 32 colors that are 
modified will have a DIRECT effect on the last 32.

> Anyone know a way around this ?
Depends on what you want to get around. :) As said, there's no way to 
change the Half-bright colors (last 32). If you want, just get AGA.

On ECS machines? None. The EHB (extra half-bright)  palette  is  calculated
from  the  first  32  colours  by hardware (shifting the colour bits to the
right).

On AGA machines set the KILLEHB flag in BPLCON0 and modify the palette  set
the 'normal AGA colour setting way'.

Aaaaarrrrggghhh!!!

Ahem, just in case you were wondering, im still being so inundated with 
requests for Extreme AMOS, that I am now officially back on the job!

Issue 4 was almost finished enginewise, and the reason it was stalled 
was because noone had sent a single article, just congrats on the third 
one, which literally stormed me with greets etc.

Im making a public plea, PLEASE SUBMIT ARTICLES/PICS/TEXTS of ANY KIND 
which you would like to see included. Once the Bubba project is shuffled 
to the side, i'll be working full time on issue 4. I hope to make it a 
monster 3-4 disk monster issue this time!!

If you are not familiar with the workings of Extreme AMOS, it was a disk
magazine I originally worked on with another fellow, who later left after a
mild controversy. Anyhow, I put together a large, tutorial packed issue
(the third) which turned out to be the most popular release of the magazine
to date, with over 300 copies mailed out personally, and countless
downloads from my AMOS homepages. I also received hundreds of mails telling
me what a great magazine it was, and how it helped people solve particular
AMOS problems, but unfortunately only received several small articles back,
and I wasnt prepared to spend another 7 months writing articles for an
entire issue again!!

Any questions whatsoever, I can be contacted at mushypd@redrose.net

Thanks

Well, the code is effectively done apart from a few tweaks, the sound
is done (apart from maybe a tweak), and a lot of things have improved.
The new graphics for the levels are about done, as is level design,
but not yet implemented, and will be coming as an update VERY shortly.

Subject: F2000 Bank Problems
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: Text/Plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Status: O
X-Status: 

I am having a small problem with my Fleshee 2000 map editor saving aspect.
I have no screwed around with the code for it to work from reserved work
banks and saves fine when I use the 'Save' command.

The only problem is that when I use the 'Save' command it also includes my
icon file (obviously), which is small but an annoyance nonetheless. But I am also
having problems with 'BSave', because between banks 10 and 11 there is a
large gap of space that AMOS itself uses. So when I attempt to save from
the beginning of bank 10 to the end of bank whatever it includes ALL that
data, which sums up to over 300K.

How do I get around this?


Now, on other things.....
As I have mentioned on my web page I need people to help me make good
maps. So I am wondering if anyone wants to help and is not involved with
CBATNAM ;). What I can offer you is the full version of the game when it is
completed (if it ever get completed...).

If you are interested EMail me... I will fill you in on any details (if
they exist?!?).

Why would you want to play a THX song next to a PT song?

THX reserves that for filters, it precalcs the filters instead of doing
that on the fly (which would use way too much cputime). It's probably
possible to not use this function if the song doesn't use filters (have to
consult this with the programmer) as older songs do not reserve this memory
as they don't use filters. Anyway, the memory can be given back if you're
not playing a song.

I like THX so there. ;)

Subject: Final Hi-score routine uploaded to giark
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: O
X-Status: 

Okers, I have sent my final hi-score program to giark to be sent to the
homepages. I havent sent him the source code just yet, as im gonna hold
onto it till monday night to make sure there are no bugs in it (plus I need
to document it for him, hehe).

OK, some things you should know. Firstly, it creates a random "score" to
decide wether to enter you into the table. There is a section to say you
didnt make it, and also, the bit that you did, derrr. I have used a SID
file, as with all these THX problems with the extension, its actually more
memory economic to use a true SID file than a THX (IMHO), and it has 2
tunes, one for when you get in, one for when you dont. The tune BTW is by
Maniacs of Noise, Cybernoid 2.

The system can be controlled by either the joystick, or the keyboard.
Keyboard keys are O, P and Space, or ENTER on menu's where prompted. Slide
the scroller to the left/right to pick letters, fire/space to select them.
The square character is the space character, <- is delete, and arrow down
is exit.

I already know about the mouse pointer being there, so thats one error you
need not report, hehe. I have tested it in bits, but not fully, so please
exploit it to its limits!

CBATNAM coders, If I forgot to put your name in the default scores, gimme 
a shout!

When the scores are being drawn on the screen (a seperate procedure, for
use within the main title screens for displaying the scores) press either
fire/enter to exit the routine.

Included in the archive is playsid.library for all those who haven't got it.

   Well, I actually devoted four hours earlier today to working on the
   Final Boss phase.  Trying to find the right design as I want it to be
   interesting (at least a little).  Think I have it sorted now , so it's
   just a matter of implementing the remaining control-modules and
   Phase Four will be complete...

   Of course, after I get that done I need to work on the remaining items
   on my work-list, most notably:

   1. Adding a "[G]rab" option to allow Mush (or myself) to take a few
       snapshots of the display.  Won't take long to implement, just
       need to create a simple remapper to convert the Dual-Playfield
       display into one 16-color screen which can be saved out to disk.

   2. Cleaning up.  This involves several tiny (although important)
       modifications.

   I'll try to at least finish the FinalBoss Battle and add the "Grab"
   option tonight, but I'm afraid I will have missed the deadline as the
   clean-up won't be complete until at least tomorrow and possibly
   Tuesday...

   I'll do what I can, but if the other guys are all done then just go 
   ahead with the next phase (code-optimization?) without me and I'll
   "be there" as soon as possible...

   Sorry guys, hate to let you down, but things didn't turn out as 
   expected and I ended up losing (most of ) Thursday and Friday as
   I simply did not feel "up to par".  However, I am back 100% now!!!!


      Take  care,   
      GARFIELD

Hi: Mushy 

Why not do a best of the AmosList section. You can pick out some of the
interesting things we've written about, and cleanly put the threads 
together.

Before I joined the list I read some of the Aminet AmosList archives, and
thought that it would be nice if someone would organize this mess.

Has anyone got a util to convert AMOS source into an ASCII file?

or...

Is it possible to write an AMOS program which can in turn load a source and 
save it as ASCII?

or...

Does anybody know the format in which source is stored?

I am after something which I can use via DOpus - Just double click the 
*.AMOS name and it appears in a readable format.

Also, can anybody send me some instructions on how to create installer 
scripts?
(Please don't point me at Aminet as I don't have full net access).

Thanks in advance,
Wayne

Er, all the musics are being converted to PT format so you won't need to
use the THX tunes. They are just there to let you hear how they will sound.

And besides, they're far better then what MON have ever done. :)) Ofcourse,
if y'all want to use different musics I'll just throw my 28 Bubba tunes in
the bin and go home.

You know that AMOS gives an 'out of memory' error message for all
sorts of things right?
I know it does it if you try ti run two amos programs together anyway.

Well what else does it do it for? Missing librarys? Some people are
gettign this message when they've plenty of memory so I'm trying to
work out what's really wrong.

Thanks,

 Hi,

 I think this is directed to Garfield, or one of the people with a good voice... Oh well, anyway, I need some samples digitized...

 I need them in 8bit (yuck), 44100 (yay), and I want the following said in a "nerd" deep intelligent voice..

 "We have lift off in 20 seconds..."
 "15 seconds"
 "Engines start, all primary power systems online"
 "Engage Thruster sequence"
 "All functions online"
 "All functions have passed check point"
 "And in 10"
 "9"
 "8"
 "7"
 "6"
 "5"
 "4"
 "3"
 "2"
 "1"
 "We have lift off, repeat, we have lift off"
 "Course is set"
 "Engage and control automatic guidence system"

 If you can do that in a really deep, cool HUMAN (it has to sound human like), then I'll be glad to get the samples from you :)

Yeah I'm still busy... whoosh... for example the Harrier music is about 30
minutes long if you play it all in one go, 12 musics, 130 or so patterns.

I'm glad I don't have to convert it :) Still, there will be 28 or so musics
in the game total. Maybe we should call it "The Captain Bubba Music Show,
with a game thrown in for free" :))

Run CMD then load your amos source into the the editor and print.
It will be saved in an ASCII file..

Greetings.

Sorry Giark that I havent had a chance to get on IRC and have some 
last minutes talk with you (for long enough, namely).

Just an update on the stage: It's almost done. I'm implementing 
objects now (which is giving me a little trouble, all of these 
routines for sorting the objects, plus all of the variables involved, 
I'm having to go through and debug my source).

Anyhow, after that, I'll put in the routines for the Taxman (which 
will include a "real-time cinematic sequence" when you come up 
against him.) I also plan to implement support for enemies (just your 
basic STAB, the Taxman's minions) and of course objects (said above), 
ammo, health, and treasure. The banks will also be able to be 
completely modifiable by Giark (only the textures and objects). I 
also think I told some of you (programmers mainly) that I've updated 
and added graphics (new status bar and textures, it all looks COOL!)

Other than that, it should be the end of the week before I can have a 
(demo?) for you guys to see (wont send source directly, as I want the 
guys to see what I've got upto that point, then afterwards take the 
next day to work out any extra bugs). Plus, EJ said it would be 
"later this week" before he could have my music, so tada..

Please be patient and stay tuned (you wont die, I assure you).

I explained to you on IRC ages ago, that until the mods are released as

MON were one of the best SID artists in the business, alongside them cool

SID (IMHO) is much more c-64 like than THX could ever be, but ive heard a
couple of good THX sounds, so things could look up. I'll never prefer THX over
SID...

If you have used easylife commands but they don't have the lib, it will say

Heh, you don't need to convince me about SID music, I have about 60mb of it
right on my HD and I listen everyday. Shows you what a life I've got. :)

Galway's my favourite, his tunes are incredibly brilliant. Dunn was a
horribly underestimated musician, Hubbard was very good until he started to
use digitized sounds (with the exception of Skate or Die! and maybe BMX Kidz).

I was ofcourse joking about my music being better than MON. I hope I will
come near to them some day in quality.

Have you heard some of my THX conversions of C64 music? They sound like the
real thing, at least, people still ask me what program I use to convert SID
files to THX. :)) (check out THX.HOME.ML.ORG for a lot of great tunes. And
a few by me :) Besides, ringmodulation is planned for the next THX release.
THX may be no sidmusic, but it's damn close.

Anyway, I wish there was something like THX for the C64, as I'd really like
to compose on that machine and I can't really get into those C64 music
editors.

Sorry to bore you like this but if someone mentions the words "Sid" or
"C64" there's no stopping me. :)

There's a conversion of SidPlay going around, have you looked into that one?

I have been having some strange troubles with samples in my game. For some
reason they ALWAYS loop over and over, even though I've never turned sam
loop on. Hell, I've even tried putting sam loop off in dozen's of places
but it still persists!

Does anyone know what's going on? could a 640X400 hires laced screen be the
cause of it?

This is not a virus ! I think, it's a bug in the THX extension (Jotre) because 
i've got the same problem during the development of my extension (DOOM Music Extension). 
But i've removed this bug. :)

You can use the DME for playing THX sounds with different commands like
Thx Vu,Thx Continue,Thx Voice (for playing SFX) etc. It's available on Mush's homepage.

   If you can wait a day, until I complete this latest version of my

   speech is like "normal" (my normal nerdy voice I guess), but if you
   need them really DEEEEEEEEP, I can certainly do that as well...

Greetings.
 
> No good. The game is going to be finished this sunday. No exceptions.

Well, I'm bustin my hump trying to get all done that I can, but, I'm 
sorry, it will HAVE to be good enough. You can't do the game without 
my level (and without the Taxman), and I say you'll have to wait a 
bit longer (Garfield was behind a bit too, wasn't he?) :P

I'm don't want to (or am) trying to slow the project down, but 
there's just not been enough time to put everything I want into the 
level AND get it finished on time.

Btw, my ISPs been having some major problems lately, so anything I DO 
send may get there a little late (unless they finish their upgrades 
before the end of the week).

Try and meet me on IRC sometime for a chat.

Well, a 640x400 will prevent your proggie running on WB3.1, but hte sam loop
problem is a known amos bug.  Quit amos, and reload, and all will be fine.
It happens when you flick to workbench and back as far as anyone can tell.

INTRODUCTION
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

        Welcome to the December copy of the Mushroom PD Mailinglist mail.
Well, its that time of the season again, where fat blokes dress up in red
suits and dont feel bad about themselves ( ;) ) and lots of little brats
wanting everything under the sun for christmas gifts, and wives who like to
break their husbands at the bank. Still, theres all the booze at the
christmas party's to look forward too, so lets get on with it!!

        In the issue this month, I have a few announcements to make, which
will surely blast Mushroom PD into the next millenium, never mind next
year. We also have the latest on the AGA situation, and some interesting
news which will allow any AMOS programs to run on graphics cards, WB
screens etc. with even more ease of use.More of that in the AGA REPORT
section of the mail. I have been getting a lot of questions recently about
the AMOS mailing list, mainly does one exist, so ive written a few short
paragraphs on what it is, how to join, and how it works etc.

        Ive also decided to re-release the much-talked-about "Extreme AMOS"
disk magazine, which I own and run. Ever since issue 3 was released lat
year, I have received countless numbers of emails to restart, and so have
decided to do so, but i'll need your help to send me Amiga articles!!!

        We also talk a little bit more in-depth about a worldwide AMOS
project named "Captain Bubba and the Nasty Alien Menace", in which I am
involved. I'll also explain about when it will be available, and where you
can get some juicy screenshots from.

        As usuall, I have the list of the most recent uploads, with a few
mentions for programs which I feel have stood out exceptionally well to me.
See the appropriate sections for more information.

        If you wish to contact me for any reason at all, feel free to email
me at mushypd@redrose.net with any questions/queries you may have, and i'll
be happy to help you the best that I can.


ANNOUNCEMENT - * Mushroom PD Re-releases Extreme AMOS issues*
-=-=-=-=-=-=

        Due to so much overwhelment by the public in the last 12 months, I
have finally decided to begin work on Extreme AMOS once more. After the
third release, and lots of controversy with other members etc. the magazine
made a shaky second release into the PD. Once the trouble had sorted itself
out, I hid for 7 months and created the third issue entorely by myself (and
with the help of some of Paul Burkey's Squidger routines for GFX) and
released it into the PD. Issue 3 turned out to be the best ever release of
the issue, and I was constantly being sent email requests to have it
mailed, and my homepages received an immeasurable number of downloads.
Altogether, I must have received a good 5 or 6 hundred mails about the
issue, saying how great it was, and wandering when the next issues were
going to be released, but unfortunately, only less than 1% actually sent me
any articles to include, so I had to leave it on the side.

        Issue 4 was ready to be released, as I had worked on a rather
impressive engine for it, only I didnt have very many articles, so when I
get a collection together, I shall release issue 4 of the magazine. Despite
any previous issues/owners comments, the magazine will remain entirely PD,
with advertisers such as software houses, parts suppliers, can bribe me to
battle for the limited advertising space in the text and IFF categorys!! ;)

        For questions on Extreme AMOS, or if you wish to have issues mailed
to you, simply contact me at mushypd@redrose.net where I will be happy to
sort you out. Please send articles to the same address in no wider than 76
character ASCII form.

        Advertisers, if you wish to contact me about advertising in both
IFF and text form, contact me for availabilty. Im not charging anything to
advertise, but I do have limits for diskspace per issue. Please note that
bribes of free software/A4000's do take a rather high priority in the mag! ;O

        Issue 4 will be written in AMOSPro with the GUI Extension, so
everyone will be able to run the magazine, no matter what kind of
screenmode/monitor they have, plus I shall be using true AGA graphics! (see
the AGA REPORT for more info on AGA with AMOS)

ANNOUNCEMENT - *Mushroom PD signs contract with F1 Software to begin
-=-=-=-=-=-=   distributing licenseware titles*

        This deal is now complete, and I have signed the contracts and
necessary bits and pieces with Phil Wilkinson
(http://www.ware5d.demon.co.uk   Email: phil@ware5d.demon.co.uk) and have
recieved the first selection of my master disks. I am hoping to begin sales
in early january. At this time, im re-writing the catalogue disks, and if
anyone would like a copy when they are available, email me at
mushypd@redrose.net

HOMEPAGES - *Changes made to the Mushroom PD Homepages this month*
-=-=-=-=-

        Ive made a couple of minor adjustments to the pages this month, and
one major change. The minor changes involve updating the index page, and
adding a few animGIF files to make it a little more presentable, as well as
fixing the odd spelling mistake, and also changing some of the link palette
colours so that they are readable on all browsers.

        I have also removed the mail order section from the library. The
mailbox was getting swamped with files, and I still have a lot left to go
through, so if you have anything still waiting, then i'll get round to it
as soon as possible!  Another reason why I removed it, was so many people
were giving me false email address' and a lot of accounts, like geocities,
had limits on them (which noone bothered to check half the time) and I
would have to spend all day downloading the bounced mails I had just spent
the night uploading.

        The FTP site is online a majority of the time now, so unless I get
lots of requests to have the mailforms turned back on, you should keep
trying the FTP site. Note that in January, i'll be getting another
telephone line installed, and the system will be online almost 24 hours a
day without interruptions.

COMPILER - *AMOSPro Compiler selling like hotcakes! Only 4 copies left!!*
-=-=-=-=

        Since I have started selling the compiler, ive been inundated with
requests for it, although only 6 people have paid up for it and had it
delivered. Many thanks to all those who have purchased it, and I hope to
see your compiled programs in the library very soon!!

        If you wish to get your copy, then visit my WWW page for more
information on ordering. Price in the USA is $23.50 including postage. If
you live outside the USA, then the cost may be different due to extra
postage costs, so get in touch with me first!!

AGA REPORT - *Just how far have these AGA extensions progressed since the
-=-=-=-=-=   last report?*

        In the last report, we covered the issue of the AGA situation in
AMOS, and how it can be acheived, and with what extensions. The most
commonly known extensions for which the *TRUE* effects can be acheived, are
the GUI Extension, and the barely-workable "AMOS AGA Extension" which used
to be available from F1, but wasnt very good and was removed. The Intuition
extension and OS Development kit are rumoured to be able to open true AGA
screens on the Workbench, but im not too sure at this time.

        Other extensions which are supposed to be AGA AMOS include the
much-controversy JADE extension (which looks as though noone will ever see
it, other than the beta I have) and the "Game Extension", which I might add
adds quite a few other usefull commands into itself.

        The only extension i've had any feedback on, is the GUI Extension,
in which a brand new version will be released very soon so im told!! One of
the new commands added to the system, is GUI CLONE which will copy *ANY*
AMOS screen to either an intuition screen or window, without any other
commands needed. This makes any existing AMOS program extremely simple to
convert to use the system, so that graphics card users, and those with
silly PC monitors, can see your programs.

        Out of all the possible AGA extensions I have seen, the best so far
is by no doubt the GUI Extension. The OS devkit has released a brand new
version which is supposed to be even simpler to use, but seeing as I havent
seen any compiled demo's, or even sent an evaluation copy of the library,
then im unable to review it.

        The GUI extension will open absolutely any screenmode, with any
number of colours available, by either specifying the limits in a GUI
SCREEN OPEN command, or simply using an ASL screenmode requester. Any
screenmode available is accessable, and all colours are available with full
support for palettes and gfx. The newest addition which will be programmed
into the extension is an AGA tiling system, so that "images" can be grabbed
out of windows, and stored in a new bank format to be pasted back down
anywhere on-screen. This is absolutely essential, as the current bob system
is limited to only a few colours. Other new commands also include LOAD IFF,
SAVE IFF, as well as GUI PUT and GUI GET which reduce the lengthy
repetition process of having to open a file, grab its string, and then
close it. Just simplify the process by GUI GET File$,String$  GUI PUT does
the same, but writes it to a file.

        Rest assured, as soon as the new version of the GUI extension, or
any other AMOS extension for that matter, i'll be sure to inform you all.

AMOSLIST - *What exactly is it? And how can I be a part of it?*
-=-=-=-=

        Over the past few weeks, ive been asked by a few people, exactly
what, and where the AMOS mailinglist is located. The majority of these
people are those who are new to the net. The AMOS Mailinglist is an
AMOS-dedicated mailinglist, in which all AMOS users/interestees can
communicate by email with the whole group. Anyone who wishes to respond to
your mails may do so privately, or to the whole list.

        One of the things I do personally, is echo the entire list to the
official AMOS newsgroup, alt.religion.amos which was set up about 18 months
ago. It was unavailable on most servers up until January of this year, when
I was able to boost it to servers all around the world. All news postings
sent to this list which are AMOS related, will also be echoed to the list.

        To join the list, simply send an email to
amos-request@access.digex.net with the subject line as SUBSCRIBE <your
email address here> and you will be added to the receivers list. To post a
message, simply mail it to amos-list@access.digex.net. The AMOS Mailinglist
is owned and maintained by Mike Cox (mcox@access.digex.net).

        One of the features coming to my homepages very soon, will be every
AMOS mailinglist mail ever sent to the list, which is now about 5 years
old. Keep your eyes posted on my homepages for more info!!

PREVIEW - *Worldwide programming efforts produce a new top-quality Amiga
-=-=-=-   title*

    There is a new AMOS game in the works, called Captain Bubba and the
Nasty alien Menace. Its a world-wide effort being the first international
game to really come out from AMOS. There will be several different kind of
games merged into the one large game, with levels such as a tekken-type
fight, a raycaster, an excellent blood money-type level, plus a few others
which I wont spoil for you just yet!

    There are approximately 12-15 programmers (including myself) working on
the project, and we are hoping to have it finished in time for christmas.
The joint effort will be available to purchase exclusively from my
homepages at www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk and as the release date gets nearer,
I will let you know. I am collecting screenshots of various parts of the
game, so keep your eyes peeled for a full in-depth review!!

        My personal reccomendations this month, are the 2 Giga production
demo's, as these contain some excellent routines. The game/shoot/tomcat
contains some very nice live footage, but the game is probbaly not as good
as what it could have been for a demo. If you are interested in running
your own mailinglists, them utils/internet/MPDMailpostV2 could be the archive
for you to use! The games Starboy, Skimmers, and Teeny Weeny are all demos
of upcoming F1 titles, so why not check them out!

Hiya list members

Me and a friend is making a skateboard-game.... I'm coding and he's 
making the gfx. So what's the problem? Let me put it this way.
A simple equation will show it...
GROUP - THE CODER GUY - THE GFX GUY = THE MUSIC GUY..... Eh.. =)
So. What we need is a musician for making SID of THX modules. The ongs 
should be happy. Reply me with a private email if you're interested.

And I have another problem. On Andrew's Amos-homepage, I can't download 
the Doom extension. All the other extensions works fine. Am I he only 
guy in the world with this problem. Perhaps someone can mail me the 
extension..

So. That's all. Bye... /Ravon

Probably not. A problem I often find is if you're using amos and
switch to workbench and use something there that uses sounds (octamed,
multiview a sample etc) and then flip back to amos the sound has gone
mental. This is because (among other things) amos not reserving the
sound channels (as octamed does) essentially this prevents others
progs interfering with the sound. One solution is to quit amos and
start again and don't run other stuff. Another is get the AMCAF
extension (Hi Chris!!) which has better sound support and can put a
lock on the Audio so external interference should no occur. Happy
sampling!

You don't know what you're missing if you don't buy Amcaf! It's not as
if it costs an arm and a leg either :)

We've  all  said  it  before,  Amcaf  is  a  MUST  if  you're  an Amos
programmer.  The  features  it  provides  are  great.  If peeps didn't
support  Chris by registering for Amcaf, we would never have been able
to use the great commands it provides.

(and of course the future ones in the FREE updates to registered users
too).

Have you even tried the free demo version of it? Go on....

BTW What exactly is Fleshy 2000 then? Have I missed something?

Tarra, Andy

outside of the running prog. But I found out specifically that the MED I
was playing in my Intro was causing the problems.

I'm now wondering would an AMOS Music Bank get around this, because my
simple text intro depends entirely on the music for that *evil* atmosphere,
especially when I fade the title in. If the music bank does get around it
how do I go about converting a med to a AMOS Music Bank?

Also, does the Doom Music Extension handle MEDs better? I might consider
using that if it does (I've already gotten it of course).

I'm not one for commercial extensions (hope ya don't mind Hodges), because
I prefer freeware. It seems to make more sense because I've already paid 
for AMOS and the compiler. Besides, I'm trying to get a beta version of
Fleshee 2000 up on my page ASAP, so I don't feel like getting yet another
extension.

I think I wanted something to do it on the fly. He said he was looking for
a tool to add to DOpus and display the sources as ASCII files, without
storing the ASCII files on the hd.

Unfortunately I can't help on this.

If the MED player library or similar Tracker type library have been
loaded (usually from playing a MOD before playing a sample) then any
AMOS samples will loop repeatedly.

I use AMCAF to get around this although there is a bug in that which
means that long samples get cut off..... not too much of a problem
really.

WHAT!!!???

Where did THAT problem come from? I never heard that before and I
specifically asked the list if WB3.1 had any problems with AMOS just 2
weeks ago!

Please give me more details...

Thanks,

   Well, I'm putting some time in, but I wouldn't say I'm bustin' my hump
   trying to get it done.  Just steadily chopping away...

   Now, for a quick update on the sideshooter stage's progress:

   The Final Boss battle is now up n' running and the SnapshotGrabber
   is implemented (in fact I've already sent Mush four snapshots)...

   Now, it's on to the important clean-up and fine-tuning bits.  The thing
   is with this being the absolute LAST version of our stages I have to
   keep working on it until everything is fully implemented, cleaned-up
   and fine-tuned, otherwise I'd send a new demo now and work all this
   stuff into the next one...

   Anyway, here is the remaining items on my worklist:

   1. Complete Final Boss Battle by adding SS_FBDESTROYED
       module.

   2. Modify keyboard-code to use player's key-prefs (variables) rather
       than the current hard-coded key-values.

   3. Decrease the stage length to the minimize needed for the stage
       and convert the long-word size map-data to byte-size map-data.
       I already have created the utility to do this, so just need to 
       determine the final map-size then run through the convertor.

   4. Replace the current "SpriteBob Col()"-based collision detection
       with my custom rectangular-based collision-detection routines.
       I converted to SpriteBob in the last demo as I thought it might be
       faster on the low-end machines like stock A500s and such, but
       the SpriteBob are no faster (and are slower on faster machines)
       and also error-prone.  The scrolling screws them up.

   5. Add support for music playing.  One thing I've always found with
       Amiga programming is it's so limiting having just four voices, and
       sound effects add so much to a game that I never even bother
       with music as I tend to need all four voices just give good audio
       feedback.  
       Giark, I need some way to determine if music is being played.
       Rather than using the variables you listed, I'd rather make a
       more dedicated design for handling music to maximize the 
       audio-feedback.

   6. Tweak the asteroid phase, it should be faster.

   7. Tweak the MidBoss phase, it needs to move off-screen further
       when destroyed and then, of course, all bobs need to be freed.

   8. Add a slightly more interesting "beginning" to the stage.

   9. Design a simple "death-sequence" and implement that as just
       fading out the disply and saying Bubba has been obliterated is
       pretty "cheap".

   10. Design a simple "victory sequence" and implement that as just
        saying Congratulations, Bubba has cleared the SideShooter is
        also pretty "cheap".

    Finally, I'm really not happy with the speed (or lack of it actually),
    so I'd like to boost the speed on lower-spec systems.  Probably not
    possible as just the gfx-updates seem to be pushing AMOS to the
    limit. :(

    I'm not giving a date for completion as there's no sense in it.  As
    soon as I have everything done and all working satisfactorily, I will
    send Giark the source and executable.


      Take  care,   
      GARFIELD

   I don't like being a main part of the reason our project is delayed, so
   if it would help, I can send you the source and support files for the
   current version.

   This way, you can start plugging them in and when I complete the
   remaining items on my work-list, I can just send you the new modules
   and relevant bits that have been changed...

   What do you think?


   BTW - here's another update:

   2.  keyboard prefs have been implemented
   3.  stage-map has been minimized and converted to bytes. Result
        is binary map now consumes only 10,800 bytes compared to the
        previous 57,600 bytes.
   6.  the asteroid phase has been tweaked and is now a bit faster.
   7.  the midbossbattle phase has been tweaked and is now "clean".
   8.  I've added a slightly more interesting beginning to my stage.

      As soon as I mail this, I'm going to work on the final module for
      the FB Battle destruction...


      Take  care,   
      GARFIELD

There is a program called.... Eh.. Forgot it's name... Anyway.. It can 
convert MED to ST-format. Later on you can convert ST to ABK by using an 
Amos converter that comes with the AmosPro_Extensions disk. BUT! 
Converted ST-modules usually fucks up because they (most of the ones 
I've converted) switches the filter on and off all the time, so they 
sound quite awful. Perhaps there is a way to get away from that problem.

Thats exactly what I meant.
I attempted to start writing a conversion program lst night but didn't get 
very far.
I was trying to get it to just do REM statements initially but had trouble 
splitting up the file into the bits I wanted.

So far I have got a header of 20 chars (using AMOS Pro v2 - probably 
different on other versions) and a trailer of 10(ish) chars.

If I strip these bits of I am left with the main program in some encrypted 
format.
Coding a small program...

Rem a
Rem b

...shows me that the HEX string for the REM statement.
Now if my program is just 1 line then I get approx 8 character back which 
seem to map to the REM followed by some junk followed by the actual remark 
(a).
With the program above I would expect just for the string to be repeated 
with b replacing a and maybe a decimal 10 and 13 stuck inbetween - no such 
luck though!
It seems that it just sticks what it likes in the file.

At the rate I am going its not looking very promising - it would probably 
take me a couple of years to find out the format.

Do I recall correctly that the source for Amos is now PD?
If so, does anyone know where I could get it.
I think if I had the source then I could just pull out the LOAD, BLOCK ALL 
and SAVE AS ASCII commands and stick them into an executable .

It was on the night of 11-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was

shouting about "Re: AMOS>Txt + Installer docs" until I was forced to knock
them out:

The source for AMOS has been speculated for a while, but so far nothing has
ever become of it.

Doesnt the Pro Compiler APCmp export as ASCII? I'll have to read thru one
of the manuals.

Yup, glad you liked it! The command is still a bit unstable, but pietro
assures me he will be cleaning it up a little, and it should be in the next
release. Its just a simple command that copys the current AMOS screen, so its
a lot less hassle!

So any 640x400 AMOS screen will not work on WB3.1???
Sounds weird.
What about 640x512?
How about 320x400?
How about 640x401?

How specific is this bug?

Thanks,

You can all relax. The release date will have to be pushed back to January 1.

I got my 1200, but a buyer for the 500 showed up almost immediately. I'm
scrambling to get a system set up for net and all on the 1200 before the 500
is out the door. Don't stop working and to those of you who were on time, I'm
sorry for the delays.

For Christmas, of course. It should not have taken this long as it is. (In

You can if you want, but I may not be putting anything up on the pages

It was on the night of 12-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Eric jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting
about "Re: MPD Announcement: F1 Software deal clinched!!" until I was forced
to knock them out:

-> Catalogue disks? Are these like prog,cost,description if so will this be on
-> your web page, or do they have demos on them as well, and if so can we down
-> load the disks from your web page, and how many of them are their?

Each program isnt individually priced, it goes off the number of disks. I dont
get to set the prices either, but I do get to modify what goes on the disks. I
will be holding descriptions of every title in the library, with the
possibility of screenshots etc. Depending on space on the disk, there may be
demo's, but I have at least 30 links to demo versions of many F1 titles at
this time, so I may just leave demo's as links on the homepages. I shall also
be trying to squeeze my Mushroom PD indexes on their too.

It will be downloadable from my homepages, as well as a fully-updated HTML
version.

The catalogue will be a single disk in size, so people can even mail it around
to mates etc.

Eh... Sorry about that... Of course you can use the commands
MED LOAD and MED PLAY. Don't really know what I was thinking.

Hey guys

Just wanted to inform you of our homepage. I know it has nothing to do 
with Amos butwe just want some opinions about it. It's a page with music 
(stored in .mid-format) from various console games.
Please take a look at it and tell me what you think...

Yes, depending on how much power, etc. you have. It's a chance to beef up/get

No, you have to support your level only.

It's a bit better :) .... the Gui Clone command change the RasInfo
structure of the specified GUI screen, and so the GUI screen will display
the AMOS screen without spent time in slow screen copy... with this method
you can turn on/off the amos screen clone.

You can't promote:

- color fading
- rainbows
- sprites
- double buffer (... for now)  You can do it by calling again Gui Clone,
but now it isn't fast enough

all the other stuff will be promoted without problems.

Hi there..

I'd like some ideas for the folowing problem:

When preparing the next version of the AB3DII-editor I'd like to be able
to detect empty areas in surrounded by zones, something like this:

XXXXXX
XX  XX
XXXXXX

How can I detect that there's a 'hole' in the middle ??

The problem is made worse becouse the folowing MUST NOT be detected as
a hole:

XXXXXX
    XX
XXXXXX

The surrounding block can be made by a random number of zones, and I have
the cords of the corners of the zones, also the zones can have from
3->10 corners...

Please help me fast :)...

Thanx in advance...

-- 
Happy greetings, Yours..

It was on the night of 13-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Jens jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting
about "GUI extension.." until I was forced to knock them out:
-> Hello..

-> I've started to use the GUI extension (great stuff) but a few questions
-> has popped up:

-> 1) The command 'Gui Title' is noted in the guide, however that command
->    does not exist (Looked in the lib with a hex-monitor and found that
->    the command is called 'Gui Titles')..

This is a known bug in the guide file. You also have to have 2 entries for
each command, where IIRC the guide said you could use just one.

-> 2) While looking in the lib I noted that the extension calls up the
->    'Gadtools.Library'. Is this a rom-lib (like exec) or should it be
->    in my libs: (it isn't there but the extension runs great anyway)..

It works fine without it, as it is a ROM lib.

-> 3) There's a slight bug in 'Gui Asl', if I pad the path with '/' (like
->    'ab3:includes/' then the returned filename holds two '/' in row 
->    ('ab3:includes//test.lnk') and the file can't be found by amos..

Yes, I fixed this problem in one of my examples for the next release of the
extension. Le,mme get the code...

   If A=9
      ' Grab a file from the user
      Do 
         F$=Gui Asl$("Pick a List of Email
recipients..."+Chr$(0),Dir$,"",Chr$(0))
         F$=Gui Dir$
         If Mid$(F$,Len(F$),1)<>"/" and Mid$(F$,Len(F$),1)<>":" : F$=F$+"/" :
End If 
         F$=F$+Gui File$
         
         If Gui File$="" : Exit : End If : Rem Exit 
         
         If Exist(F$) and F$<>""
            Dir$=Gui Dir$
            TEMP$="" : Gui Set 1,2,0,Varptr(TEMP$)
            TEMP$=F$ : Gui Set 1,2,0,Varptr(TEMP$)
            Exit 
         End If 
      Loop 
   End If 

This is the code I use in my MPDMailpostV2 routine, and it handles it all
fine. It also handles the bug for when you change directorys, as it will
only add the / onto the end if it really needs it.

Any other questions, just ask!

Nah, only a couple of us really know how to use the full power of the
extension, as we get the beta versions and have to test everything, hehe.

No... color fading/flashing cannot be displayed in my screen. you must
change directly the colours using the Gui Rgb command.

What about mouse pointers? Would I be able to read the workbench mouse
pointer to use if the AMOS pointer isn't promoted?
And what would happen if two screens were promoted? Is that possible?
Say I had a 320x200 screen and a 320x56 screen directly underneath it.
Would I be able to acheive the same effect on the WB?

The interfaces/resources will be displayed without problems, but you
can't interact with them :( When Amos is 'to back' it doesn't detects the
user inputs like key press, mouse keys and so on.

I'm working on this problem (.. i want promote the AmosPro editor too), but
it's very hard! A little explanation:

Amos install a input handler with a high priority (100)... when Amos is 'To
front' the handler takes all the user inputs and 'freeze' the OS, when
it's 'to back' the handler ignore the user inputs and so the OS works fine
and AMOS is 'freezed'.

I've tried to hack the handler code, but is a masochist work :)

Does this mean we won't be able to use anu of the AMOS input
commands, like Input$, wait key, et cetera? Are there GUI Ext
equivalents that can be used instead?

I hope that this barrage of questions isn't botering you. It's just
that this is probably the most exciting AMOS announcement since...
well, AMOS, I guess... Now if I had a convenient way to do ADTs,
I'd be a happy man...

Hello, Sample-trouble online :)

I'm in a bunch of trouble with a sample-loader I'm trying to build into
a program. I want it to load several different formats.. BUT:


1) How do I get the sample-rate of an IFF-8SVX file ??

2) How do I convert a WAV (PC) sample to a raw one.. (Or just the file-
   format :)..

3) The file-format if an AIFF file ??

4) If I want to scale a 8-bit sample (to another rate), is it as simple
   as scaling GFX ??, is it just a matter of taking out, say every 3rd
   byte or is there some nasty trick that needs to be done ??
   (calc. average of two bytes to make it even better ??)

I'm in trouble with some .au files, they're very noisy. I fact so noisy
that it's almost imposible to hear the sound. I've written about this
before and got some advice on '8/16 bit', 'flipping', 'signing' and the
'sample rate'.. I've tried several processing-programs but with no luck.
Is there any sample-expert who can solve it (I can send one of the
samples if someone would like to look at it..)


I hope to get something from this, as I need it very bad, Thanx...

For some reason Easylife makes AMOS very unstable when I start using its
XPK options, it locks up almost everytime. Is anyone else experiencing
this, or am I just crazy?!?

Since using XPK through easylife is unstable, I was planning on possibly
making calls to the xpk library. Unfortunately, I have no idea about the
appropiate commands such as telling the library to compress/uncompress a
file with SQSH and a password. Can anyone help me out here?

Hehe, I wrote this one last week.  Scan the file for VHDR, and then
add 20(ish) to it, and do a deek.  If you find it jibberish, do a -1.

Err, use an external proggie, there are loads.

No idea.

Try it, you'll be suprised.

Hello..

Anyone knows a way to get a 256 colour IFF (AGA system) loaded in AMOS.
I don't need to display it, just to get the colour values of the various
points..

Will the GUI extension supports IFF loading or DataTypes in the future ??

Hi there....

>a program. I want it to load several different formats.. BUT:

>1) How do I get the sample-rate of an IFF-8SVX file ??

Hmmm...duno about this one, sorry! If you just wanna know it off hand,
load  it  into any sample editor and read the value I guess! If you're
talking  about via your own prog, then you'll need to Peek or Leek the
file  probably as the value will be held in the file. (as long as it's
not RAW).

>2) How do I convert a WAV (PC) sample to a raw one.. (Or just the file-

Get  a  copy  of OctaMed sound Studio. Load the sample and save it out
again as Raw Data. Eay peasy Lemon Squeezy :)

>3) The file-format if an AIFF file ??

Never heard of this one, sorry :(

Get  hold  of  Audio  Master IV. It allows time stretching and you can
alter the sample rate easily too if you want. I've just heard of a new
program  named  Sound Probe which should be of use to you also. See CU
Amiga. There's a demo of Sound Probe on CUCD 18 too :)

Try  contacting  CU Amiga's Tony Horgan on this one. He's a real sound
expert.  He's bound to know the answer. Tell you what, I'll email your
question  to  the  CU  Amiga Mailing List and ak for an answer on your
behalf....

>I hope to get something from this, as I need it very bad, Thanx...

I hope you do too :^)

Tarra, Andy Gibson

Merry Xmas BTW

Sorry to bother everyone again but hopefully some of you may shed some
light on the problem here.  Recently I posted to the list about my not
being able to run AmosPro after my HD crashed but I still haven't been
able to get it to work.  Here are a couple of things:

1. I'm loading no extra extensions (except whatever came on the default 
   system disc)
2. I'm using a fresh copy of the original disc (Version 1.12)
3. To the best of my knowledge, there are no old configuration files or
   anything else lingering on the HD that might be conflicting with the
   new install
4. Someone suggested I run SnoopDos so here is the logfile when I tried
   to run AmosPro

 C Process Nam Action    Target Name                   Options  Res.

 4 [7] amospro FindTask  _Switcher AMOS_                        Fail

What is this _Switcher AMOS_ task?

Does anyone have a clue as to what might be causing the conflict here?
Thanks for the help.

Robert

I always forget about Aminet when I'm looking for such things. <sigh>

Of course, thanks for the help!

   Okay, I have finally acceptd it. I have failed with the SideShooter
   stage... :(

   As you know, my original goal was to make a highly playable shooter
   running at a full 50/60fps on 14 MHz A1200s w/FastRAM or better...


   I have been finding it increasingly difficult to bring myself to work on
   this project as it seems futile when you know that you have already
   failed, and even after you add everything making your stage
   complete you have still failed, as it's not going to run at a steady
   50/60fps on 14MHz A1200s w/FastRAM...

 
   I've stopped work again for another 4 days due to this, but I'm not
   giving it any more thought and am just going to throw together the
   remaining bits and call it "done".

   
   Anyway, sorry about this.  I really tried to reach a solid 50/60 fps,
   but in the end I am unable to hit that goal.  No matter what I do in
   the code, it's impossible to speed things up as the gfx-updates
   are using so much time there is very little left for the actual code
   processing.

   If the AMOS gfx-commands were just a little faster, about 20%
   would make all the difference.  As they currently are, it's simply
   impossible to have everything running at a solid 50/60fps with no
   slow-down!!!!!

   Next time, I'm scaling back on the game-design or else sticking
   with a 25/30 fps frame-rate...


      Take  care,   
      GARFIELD

Quit whining. Q8-{)

25FPS is standard for smooth movement. Anything faster than that is just
showing off.

Hello, i know this has nothing to do with amos itself.
But in order to use the GUI extension, i have to use the gadtoolsbox
to design my gui's.

The problem is that when i try to start gadtoolsbox, it just ends up
in a guru!

I have tried the program on all my machines (see signatur), with the
same result on all machines.

My copy of gadtoolsbox is from the aminet (dev/gui/gadtoolsbox20c.lha),
so i don't think there should be a problem with it (like viruses).

If some of you have got it to work, please let me know as i really
want to use the GUI extension.

Hope for a quick ansver, Martin Mller.

      Haha...  Okay, maybe I did go just a tiny bit overboard... :)  
      oh well, I guess I needed to be humbled anyway!!

      I have that 1Vbl-update firmly ground into my mind and so, always
      am shooting for it. 

      Anyway, no need to worry Giark, I will finish the stage within the
      next day or two.  Oh and no more whining either... ;-)

      Actually, if I had written this in CENSORED, then I'd have 1Vbl
      and you wouldn't have had to put up with my whining... the best
      of both worlds...


      Take  care,

It worked fine for me. Maybe you need to update a library or it could be the
screen promotion.

I tried the nofrag.library from the gadtoolsbox archive (both versions)
and the rest of the libs in the archive.
The only machine using screen promotion is the A4000, on the A500 i made
a fresh bootdisk from my original WB2.04/1.3 disks, and started it from
DF1. So it should work, but i don't :(

Well, i hope someone is able to help me.

The _Switcher AMOS_ task is used to detect when the user presses
'Amiga-A' and then switch the screen between WB/AMOS (Well i think so,
let me know if i'm wrong!)

I read you'r letter on 30/11-97 and noticed that the AMOSPro.Lib was
missing in you'r APSystem drawer from the AMOS system disk!.
Try replacing it, and see if that solves you'r problem.
It should solve the updater problems anyway!

Also try the program 'APSystem/Locate_APSystem' on the compiler disk,
remember to start it from within the APSystem directory on you'r
harddisk, or it wont work!.

Hope this helps.

BTW. Sorry for sending a mail directly to yesterday, i don't know hwat i was
doing, just
ignore it! :)

Martin.

You could use commands such as Multi Off, or I use E=Errcall(-132) (-136 to
turn it back on again before doing anything in AMOS) but you will lose things
such as keyboard uses (although one extension overrides that) as well as disk
access.

I used to try to not use extensions when I wrote games, for example, Twinz
never used any, but unfortunately, AMOS requires a lot of commands and
instructions which dont always work as well or as fast as a prticular
extension command. Take the GUI extension, for example...

Ive never heard of the file system, but the AMCAF disk commands seem to be
quite stable. I did experience heavy crashing when I combined the AMCAF
extension with the JD extensions, so I removed the JD from my setup, and it
cured my program completely.

-> Also.... anyone know why my clock would ALWAYS set itself back 10

I often get my clock completely screwing up when I crash my Ami, its just
one of those wierd things due to the way it saves the clock to the card, hehe!

I've had reports that my program goes wrong with PFS (Profi File
System - or something) 

This could either be AMOS or just the disk reading AMCAF commands.
Any idea which? Any solutions?

Also.... anyone know why my clock would ALWAYS set itself back 10
minutes upon reset????

Thanks,
-Murray

I know that when I had PFS installed, programs like web browsers (mainly the
cache part) would mess up my computer.  Usually, when there's a lot of
reading and writing of small files on PFS hard drives, there is usually
problems.

GUI is still in beta stages. You would have to ask Pietro about the latest
public release or visit Mush's pages.

It will be out in January.

Hello.

I'm Timo Engman, and programming a new extension - which is called 
"Second-Hand Extension", the current version is 0.01d6 but please, all 
AMOSPro users - mail me and let me hear if I may add new commands to this 
extension that the users want...For now, the extension have five commands 
:-) pretty lame. But i learning how to program the graphics...

Bmove x,x - move bytes quick as hell much faster than Poke (no checking)
Wmove x,x - same here but words much faster than Doke
Lmove x,x - same here but longwords , faster than Loke

I mean 4-5 times faster !!!

and then two shitty commands

Shand Version
Shand Stage$

The extension uses slot 22 but mail me and I may change it to whatever.
Check the aminet/dev/amos/ for this extension...later...
Maybe I mail the .Lib file soon, to the Mailing List.

A Problem: How to return a string from a routine (and change it's length) 
from it, the string is in the extension

dc.w TheLength
dc.b "TheString",0
even

Hope that all peoples understanding my bad english (I'm swedish)...

      Haha!!  Yes, I know... you are a riot, Giark.


      If I remember correctly,  we have two voices to use:
      BUBBA_FX and BUBBA_SP
      So, now I just need to determine the best way to "compress"
      everything to use only two voices as I have been using four voices
      for the sound effects. I figured we'd just have a flag set for the
      music option and if the user did NOT want music, we'd
      conditional-in the sound effects)...
      I still think this would be the best/easiest way to handle it.  Give
      me a variable to check for the music-status and I'll just add a
      conditional-check to the sound calls.


      BTW - The frame-rate will be a bit more stable as I have dropped
                a few procedure-calls by joining a few together. The
                "engine"-limits have been scaled-down: used to handle
                a max of 29 bobs simultaneously and this final version can
                handle a max of 20 bobs simultaneously.  Hopefully, this
                will make a few people happy (I'm not the only one who
                wanted to eliminate the slow-down).

                Also requested in many beta-reviews - improved gfx:
                two enemies in phase one use an orangish-scheme
                and I've tweaked the palette in phases one & two.


   Just remembered, my stage doesn't support multiple-lives, so I'll
   need to add a routine or two to handle losing a life as well as the
   standard flickering-in while invincible.

   That's it, once I have support for music (FLAG please) and Bubba's
   multiple-lives my stage WILL be complete!!!!!
 
 
   
      Take  care,   
      GARFIELD

   CBATNAM Team,

   Just had another thought and since I plan on completing my stage
   tomorrow, thought I'd consult with you guys now...

   How are we handling the demo-version of CBATNAM?  As in the
   demo Mush sends out for CoverDisks and such.

   Obviously, we can't be giving out the full game, so I assume we (the
   stage-programmers) are to be supporting a demo-version, correct?

   Just want to make sure this is what you want, although I don't see
   how else we could do it as effectively...

   It's no problem, just give me another flag (DEMO) and if it's true
   I'll limit the duration of the game-play to about 30 seconds of Phase
   One (or maybe ten seconds each of Phases 1, 2 and 3)...

   I think this would be just enough to "bait" the player into purchasing
   the full version.  We have five stages, so if we all gave a 30-second
   preview then we'd have a solid two and one-half minute playable-
   demo.  Actually, we could reserve the Bonus Stage for the
   registered users (more incentive to order the full version), but I
   have enough to think about, so you guys can sort that out... :-)
  

   Anyway, just give me some feedback guys (Giark, Mush)... should
   I go ahead and add this demo-mode support?

   If this has already been discussed then I apologize - I missed it...


      Take  care,

A flag which supports the demo mode will be fine, say, 15 secnds. Ill be
playing with the code a bit anyhow for the demo version, so i'll be cutting
unused bits out. Should also show a still of the boss, and some text about it
so the player gets to miss out n the fun, hehe!

Hmmm...   How about a demo variable, with 30 seconds or whatever plugged into
it, and we count it down to zero...  

Of course, on the real version, demo=-1

Thats a long demo.

Well, as per your idea, I will be implementing a timer in the demo variable
as above unless info to the contrary is received Giark.  Perhaps stick 
"DEMO TIMER = 30" on the screen counting down.

It hasn't AFAIK.

Hello..

Well I thought I had something great when I managed to use datatypes to
load samples. Well it works right, but:

Is the NO way to play long samples, I've tried to load samples with a
length of 378052 bytes in 8SVX format with my new datatype procedure,
and I only get to hear the first bit. If I save the converted raw-data
out and play them with a cli-util there's no problems at all, so it
isn't my data-conversion that's wrong..

I've tried to play the samples as raw with the original commands, with the
sample commands in the unregistered version of AMCAF, with the replay
routines in DME.. But no gold.. 
NB: I have to replay 'em raw, or it won't work in my project...

Help, please...

Happy greetings, Yours..

Hi, Ryan ,

I have  testet the DME and found the problem. It is a bug in the original Amos
Extension and not in in the DME. For currectly sample playing, please use the 
version 2.0 of DME with the DME Sample Commands and your computer will not
crashed.

      This sounds fine to me. If DEMOTIME is greater than -1, I'll count
      down, once it hits 0 the stage ends... Great Idea!!
      Giark can simply set DEMOTIME in the Main Code and it will
      apply to all stages...

   > Thats a long demo.
 
      Yeah, I wondered about that. 30-seconds sounded good, but the
      overall 2 1/2 minutes does sound a bit long.  Maybe go with 15-20
      seconds per stage.  Anyway, using your idea Giark can set the
      timer to give just enough of a "taste" to hook people...

   Very good... I will go ahead and implement this in my stage also.
   The "DEMO TIMER = XX" sounds good as well.  I'll put that right in
   the status bar using the "oh so simple" Print command...


           --------<SLIGHTLY NEW SUBJECT BEGINS HERE>--------
   Giark, are you still alive?  I post a message bristling with frustration
   and you are right there giving encouragement, but I haven't heard
   anything about the MUSIC and DEMO support...

   Anyway, I will implement the MUSIC support based on the status
   of CB_MUSIC (that's the name I'm using unless told otherwise)
   Basically, I'll replace the main sounds calls with BUBBA_FX and
   BUBBA_SP and the other sounds will be conditioned in with
   If Not(CB_MUSIC)
      Sound Played Here
   End If

   Also, I'll use DEMOTIME to count down the demo...


      Take  care,   
      GARFIELD

AMCAF uses the normal dos commands to provide the disk reading functions. I
don't see why it shouldn't work with PFS.

On the other hand, PFS does not provide FileNotification, but neither  AMOS
nor AMCAF need Notification.

Bug in clock? Virus? Battery failing? Dunno.

I've found out that it's the best file system to  use  with  floppy  disks,
especially  together  with  the diskspare.device (nearly one MB per DD disk

so I switched back FFS.
