From: Arash Tavakoli <arash@online.no>

I finally got around to testing all of the algorithms suggested:)

The only one that seems accurately is Claudes:)
The Michener algorithm seems totally identical to the amos/turboplus
routines:)

now for the task of figuring out what it's doing...:))

btw for those who wonder i'm trying to make curves for a vector drawing thing
i'm making... (which gets considerably harder whan i have no idea how to
rotate Michener generated curves:)
(maybe i should have asked for a spline algorithm instead... but got a bit
gobsmacked when i couldn't even draw a circle:)


to Peter Cahill:
It would be really nice if you could send bresnhams line and circle
algorithms:)
(then i could check out which algorithm is best for the intended use:) 


BIG thanks to the all who have helped,
Arash Tavakoli

Its not actually complicated. I can explain it if you like ;oP

If you need rotation, you should get a Ellipse routine, not circle.

Ok, Ill code them up for you later. The "Michener" looks like just
a copy of the bresnhams ones. The OS and AMOS and everything use the
origional bresnham ones cos they rock :)

For those of you interested, I have all the telnet RFCs for making a telnet
prg. It is easy to switch this over to be a data port for netgaming. The big
reason for using the telnet port, instead of opening your own, is that the
telnet port is already fairly secure.
 
Well met and godspeed,

From: "Rev. Giark To You" <giark@ragemail.com>

Here's a good question:

We all know that the gui extension can open a telnet port, but how do you get
it to act like a server and wait for a remote call? If I set it up to wait for
a connection request (miami inetd setup) and then launch my prg, how does it
know what address to connect to? Can you pass a parameter from miami/amitcp
with remote address so the prg knows what address to connect to?

I made a test.
The smallest radius on which the two routines do not do exactly the same is
2051.

That is: If your circles has smaller radii than 2051 then the two routines
make identical circles.
If your circles are getting bigger then a few pixels now and then will be
different.

Check out my new program, The Cartman Show, on aminet. It should be in
game/gag as TheCartmanShow.lha. It needs 2MB CHIP (maybe 1MB if you have no
startup) and a CD32 pad. It will work with just a joystick, but you won't be
able to access all the functions.

Subject: [amos-list] Faster Blitter?
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   I could really do with a way of speeding the blitter ops up, and I'm
wondering, doesn't AGA have a birst mode that speeds up blitter access by
x4 or something?

   Is this always active, or if not, is there a way of accessing it from
AMOS?

See ya.

Nope, the blitter is right as slow as it was in the very first A1000 :-(

You probably think about the fetch modes.
If you are running in high resolutions then the birplane DMA steals some time
from the blitter ops - and the blitter works slower. The higher fetch mode the
lesser time the DMA steals. I hardly think it possible to change the
fetchmodes in AMOS.
in the lowest fetchmode (in which AMOS runs) you can run in upto 16 colours
lowres or 4 colours highres with full blitter speed.

1. I've found that I can't get the mouse pointer below "XMouse=
   312"! I need it to reach about 400 or so..... Is it something 
   I'm doing wrong?  I have set Limit Mouse to 400 and it still
   doesn't work...

2. How do I write data to /normal/ text files?  It's possible to
   make files with the PC format carriage return, but I can't see
   how to make one with the standard Amiga type.

   I use -- Open Out #1,file$ : Print #1,variables

3. Do you think it's selfish to expect money from Amiga products?
   As in... maybe comic strips....

    312 is the sprite hardware limit I think...

You can use this to get round it, it moves a 'mouse pointer' in an infinite
plane. The only problem is you can't have the original pointer visible.

You can set its limits to whatever you like

See ya.

G'Day fellas,
Anyone have any idea how I can implement the internal clipboard with the GUI
Ext (just to cut & paste text)?
On a related theme, I remember a prog previously which let you use the miggy's
256-level clipboard which most apps seem to ignore. Any clues?

Cheers,

Is there any way to create transparency effects in AMOS?  As in,
maybe a bob which is partially see-through over a picture
background.....?

Thanks for the help,
                    -- Leto

Well that would seem logical, and I tried it, but it doesn't work!
In that AMOS doesn't recognise the command......

Hello Leto, you said

>background.....?

Only colour 0 is transparent, so I suggest drawing the part of your bob which
is see-through like the checker board below, using the X positions as the
colours of your bob, and leaving the 0 positions as colour 0. In effect, this
creates a `ghostly' bob with holes through which the background passes
unchanged. When the bob stops moving you can optionally swap it for the
fully drawn version. This is less than perfect, but it works.

   You can use the classic bitmap hacks. I'm sure someone must have an
example of it somewhere...

You could do bitplane tricks, like only writing to certain planes or making the second half of your palette a darker/brighter copy of the first part and make the bob 
appear on the last bitplane:)

(not really sure if what I said is technically correct, 
 but i did manage something like that with the Set Bob
 command... with experimentation.. as i've never fully
 understood the SetBob command:)

You could also use the AMCAF shadebobs and shadepixels:)

(for some reason I once managed a very clever transparency 
 of a small multicolour ship bob by using a bob grabbed in a 16
 colour screen and displayed on a 32col screen, but I never
 figured how it happened coz I lost the source and pics when I
 unknowingly repartitioned my drive...)



Hope this was somewhat helpful,

   Does anyone have any tips for making a multiplayer game with

   I'm trying to add netplay support to some of my games, but I can't
manage it ;(

   Any tips etc?  By the way, has anyone every made an amos program
that uses the internet to communicate with another copy of its self?
Can it be done with the TCP commands in the gui ext?

See ya.

I have that kind of routine lying in my drawer somewhere, just have to find
it. I wrote it 'cause I wanted to have transparent explosions in my game. It
works nicely and is fast (and uses Set Bob command)...

What I mean by that is commands that would allow the program to wait for
access (monitor a port), then come on in response to the data being sent from
remote.

Ok, here's a little explanation what Set Bobs 'bitplanes' -value does:
It is possible to set this value from %1 to %111111 to define which
bitplanes' bits blitter can change when drawing bobs.
If you set 'bitplanes'-value to %1 you will see following results:
'bitplanes'    Background colour    =>    Result
     %1                            %0(0)                     %1(1)
                                       %1(1)                     %0(0)
                                     %10(2)                  %11(3)
                                     %11(3)                  %10(2)
                                          etc.
etc.
You can see what the blitter does is a bit change operation to backgrounds
1st bitplane ('bitplanes'-value). The result is that colours 0 and 1 change
places
in background, same as 2 and 3 up to 14 and 15 (if you have a four bitplane
screen). Ok?

If you set 'bitplanes'-value to %10 all effects will be on 2nd bitplane, so:
    %0    will be     %10        0 => 2
    %1        ""          %11        1 => 3
  %10        ""            %0        2 => 0
  %11        ""            %1        3 => 1, and so on...


I can write for you a simpler version later in which you'd be able to see
better all those colour mixs.
But now I have to go to sleep...

To get transparent bobs, save them as 8 colours and load them into a 16
colour screen.  Use the SET BOB command to only draw in the first 3
planes and you will get a transparency effect. 

The same works for higher colour screens as long as your sprites colour
planes are less than the chosen screen planes.

Blended colours are made from colours higher in the palette so you may
want to reserve the top 3 or 4 for exactly the right colour you desire
after a blend.

Screen Copy using bit patterns also works, and with logical operators
such as AND OR et. al.

The other option you have is to make transparent shapes from the POLYGON
command setting the fill pattern so it's a checker pattern.  You will
see the other graphics underneath.

I just need more quirks, I gotta admit it looks patently

Well that's why I need your help!!
Come on AMOS guru's you know amos is loaded with wierd programming

lump the messages together a month at a time, I need one message

Hi Everybody,

> To get transparent bobs, save them as 8 colours and load them into a
> 16 colour screen. Use the SET BOB command to only draw in the first
> 3 planes and you will get a transparency effect.

   What I've found is that if you pick up a bob from, say, an 8 colour
screen and display it on a 32 colour screen then it is tansparent (if
you use it in the right way) already, without fafing about with set bob.

   The same goes to screen copy, thats how I got my shading in James
Bond :) (using a 64 colour screen with the right palette, and the
shading drawn down then copying the 16 colour screens noto it ;)

See ya.

I have to agree about James Bond, it is rather a good game. I found myself playing
it for ages on my own, even though it's a multi-player game! I especially like
the intro and music.

   Grab a copy of httpresume, it'd let you carry on d/l ing it if it
stops.

   By the way, the game is basically a cross between Goldern Eye and Extreme
Violence.

Thanks for all the help!  I've yet to try out all these ideas, but
they sounds good.

Also, well done to Andrew Crowe for the great results with James
Bond!  I'm downloading it at the moment (hm... just stopped :(
It's great that "even" AMOS can do some impressive things......
(even though I don't really know what the game's abouut...)

hehe

Just got kinda curious abt this...
What happens if only 10 ppl call in?
Would you be paying out of your own pocket?:)

(that problem is why most non-scam competitions run with donated prizes,
or the cost of the prizes comes out of the ad budget:)

Good luck with it tho:)

Hi all,
what I explained to Leto of Set Bob 'bitmap'-values wasn't of course correct
at all. Here's real results what you get when using Set Bob -command on a
screen with 4 bitplanes:

'bitplanes'    bgcol    result
%1                    0            1
                          1            1
                          2            3
                          3            3
                          4            5
                          5            5, etc...
This happens when you use odd numbered colour in your bob.
The result is opposite 1=>0, etc. when using even numbered colours.


%10                  0           0
                          1            1
                          2            0
                          3            1
                          4            4
                          5            5
                          6            4
                          7            5, etc...
Like before effects are opposite when use even colours.

%11                  0            1
                          1            1
                          2            1
                          3            1
                          4            5
                          5            5
                          6            5
                          7            5
                          8            9, etc...
This happens when you use ink 1 in your bob. If you have f.e.x colour 2 in
your
bob results will be: bgcol 0 to 3 => 2, 4 to 7 =>6, etc...
The results'll be same for every fourth colour so there's no point using any
other
colours in bob than 0 to 3.

%110                0            0
                           1            1
                           2            0
                           3            1
                           4            0
                           5            1,...
                       ...,8            8
                           9            9
                         10            8, etc...
This happens when using ink 1 (or 0). Like before the results'll change when
bobs
colour is other than 0/1. There's no point using more than lower eight
colours for
bob as the results'll be same on every 8th colours.

%111                0            1
                           1            1
                           2            1,...
                       ,...7            1
                           8            9
                           9            9, etc...
Like before the result colours are dependent from bob colours.

%1110              0            0
                           1            1
                           2            0
                           3            1,...
                     ,...14            0
                         15            1
This is what I used in creating transparent explosions. All colours
will be masked to those two colours used to draw bob (0/1,2/3,4/5,...).

%1111            This is normal bob - all bitplanes in use.

Hope this help you to create nasty effects:)
btw, it's vice to use Set Bob command when you have bobs that don't use all
bitplanes.
Mask out all unnecessary bitplanes and you can easily double number of bobs
/ vbl.

Hi All,
        Old Wrinkly again, still on the subject of fitting a hard disk =
from a PC to my Amiga.  I now have the hard disk, but I'm even more =
puzzled than ever.  Its not just a case of making room for it (which I =
am not really concerned about), but the connections.
The hard disk in question is a Seagate 1GB. No. ST31081A.  There is an =
IDE interface connection (40 pin) and a power connection (4 pin).  The =
interface cable is 50mm wide.
The hard disk I am taking out has an interface connection of 44 pin and =
no power connection (I assume its included in the interface connection.
How on earth do I work this one out?
Can I get a suitable cable from one size to the other? What do I do =
about the power connection and how do I find out what each of the four =
pins are?
I need hardly say one mistake could prove costly, so softly softly =
catchy monkey.
Can anyone help, in plain English please.
                    Old Wrinkly

   Thats a standard 3.5" connection.

   Thats a standard 2.5" connection. The 4 power connections aren't
actually included, only 2 of them (2.5" hd's don't need +/- 12v)

   You can't use the 2.5" connector with your 3.5" harddrive. You'll
have to ring up power computing or someone and get an A1200 3.5" IDE
cable (A1200 IDE interface -> 3.5" hd port) and power cable. (the power cable connects to the floppy power connector with a splitter for the disk drive)


   Hope that helps.

See ya.

If I remember well here is a solution :

Create a dual playfield, with the same image in back and front screens.
Both screens have the same palette.

If you use color 8 in a bob, you will see what's in the back screen.

If you modify all colors a little bit darker for this screen, you get a
nice shadow effect.
If you make them brighter, you get a spotlight effect.

Sorry, I've lost the sources I wrote about that, but it worked fine.
I plan to use this to create à 20th-century like intro, with the DCA
effect.

Hi Everybody,

   I remember someone has a routine for copying bob images to and fro
fastmemory, but I can't remember who, so could I please have a copy?

   I need someway of having a few bob images which I can use as a
buffer to copy stuff from fast ram to and then display them using the
standard AMOS bob routines, does anyone have a copy of it?


(if not I could probably (try) to write one myself...)

See ya.

hi leto,

sorry, i missunderstood your question :)

if you want to write a ascii-file with amiga-returns you have to add a
chr$(10) after the charakters, i.e.

standart-amiga-files:
open out 1,"ram:test"
print #1,"bla"+chr$(10)+"bla"+chr$(10)
close

standart-unix-files:
open out 1,"ram:test"
print #1,"bla"+chr$(13)+"bla"+chr$(13)
close

standart-msdos-files:
open out 1,"ram:test"
print #1,"bla"+chr$(13)+chr$(10)+"bla"+chr$(13)+chr$(10)
close

you can use this to break a line when you print the output to a standart
console:

open out 1,"newcon:0/0/300/100//"
print #1,"test"+chr$(10)+chr$(10)
close

hope i could helped you now

The same goes for ethernet gaming! I would love to have network gaming in my
stuff but just can't seem to perform the task.

That seems to be the problem... I think Giark is looking into it, but it's a
tough job. Maybe there are more guys out there with some knowledge on generel
ether/inter networking?

Andrew seems pretty keen on implementing Internet-play into his
games, and to be honest, I'd really like to know how to!

What I'd like to know, though, is are there any current extensions
for AMOS which will allow Internet gaming?  If so, has anyone
successfully created a game which can be played over the 'Net.

If not, will there be??  Is this the sort of thing the new GUI
extension will be catering for?

I think Internet play is a big deal nowadays, but Amigans don't
really seem to have many options when it comes Net games.  It
would be good if we could do something about it :)

My suggestion:  a big AMOS tutorial on all the conventions and how
it applies to programming, etc.  Hm.... of course someone would
have to know how to do it in the first place.... :|

I've released a few games onto aminet with Amos source if anyone's
interested.

You can find them in game/misc

or use this link:

BTW, anyone know what's wrong with the UK mirror of Aminet. I haven't been
able to connect for a while now.

   The problem is not communication across TCP, its actually writing
the protocall the game uses to communicate with its self:

   I tried rigging bomberblaster to run between two Amigas over a
serial cable. It actually worked, until someone set a bomb off and the
whole thing suddenly slowed right down, got totally out of sync and
filled the serial buffer.  

   Does anyone have any ideas? The only net protocall I've been able
to do is SerialPaint, a very simple protocall indeed.

See ya.

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   On the JustAmiga mailing list we have found that the following
files:

FastIPrefs 40.37 (11.07.99)  optimized by H.-W.Schober 
   filesize=17,428

PoolMem 1.45 (9.7.99)
   filesize=7,672

are infected(?) by a program called zakapior that does /something /on
the internet. I have no idea what it is doing but if you have those
installed I'd bin them straight away. Also if you have zakapior in
your task list then I'd stop it before going on the internet and
disable your startup programs to find what else might be infected...


   Does anyone have anymore info about this thing? 

See ya.

I've looked closer at at and from what I've seen in the half
dissasembled code I think it tries to sends one of those messages every
minute
If it can't find the bsdsocket.library it uses to send its message
it also waits a minute before it tries to open the library again.
(3000 ticks/50=60 seconds)

So basiclly it waits for the user to start Maimi or AmiTCP and
then keeps trying to send an email every minute to president@amiga.com

It doesn't destroy files and doesn't infect virusses either,
it just installs itself in memory upon loading one of the fake/altered
programs. I now heard on a IRC channel that 3 programs have this
'virus':
CMQ060, PoolMem 1.45 and FastIPrefs 40.37

He (/she?) could probably have used the time to do better things :(

The last I heard, Pietro was reworking the TCP commands (perhaps adding daemon
commands?). I have a beta 2.0 release that I am writing docs for, but I have
not heard anything from Pietro in a long time.

According to the scuttlebutt, it sends an email to the Amiga people saying
"Fuck you, you nazi bastards, you are killing the amiga" or words to that
effect.

I was just wondering...
Wouldn't It be possible to use Amarquee.library in some way? 
(It promises hassle-free TCP network usage for programmers:)

Subject: [amos-list] Gui Text and Windows
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>

Hello All,
  I have a question about Gui Text within windows.  I may have missed this
in the manual but I did look and I am kinda stuck at the moment, so my
problem is......

I am using the Gui Text command to place text into the currently active
window but this does not seem to happen as it should.

The syntax for this particular command is Gui Text x,y,text$

I have two windows, Window_1 and Window_2, each window has a procedure
determining what happens while it is selected and active.  So within each
procedure I have a counter which increases each time a window is selected
and becomes active and a Gui Text command that should write the value of the
counter within the window, ie. Gui Text 10,10,str$(WIN_1_COUNTER) for
Window_1 and Gui Text 10,10,str$(WIN_2_COUNTER) for Window_2.  So ideally
whenever Window_1 is selected, the value for WIN_1_COUNTER should be
displayed within Window_1 and whenever Window_2 is selected, the value for
WIN_2_COUNTER should be displayed within Window_2.  This is not the case,
regardless of what window is selected and active, the Gui Text command
places the WIN_1_COUNTER and WIN_2_COUNTER within the same window.

I hope I have explained this enough and I guess my question is if this is a
bug within the Gui Extension Version 1.75 or am I missing something in the
manual.  I do have an small example program on this issue if required.

Any help would be appreciated.

Declan.

I might be wrong but I beleve there's another command you have
to use to change output-window.

OK, I did some research and found the following text in the manual:
***
Instruction: Set the following graphics output.

   GUI GFX type,number

GUI GFX sets where following graphics operations are carried out. The
parameter type, can be:

   0 - Window.
   1 - Screen (not yet implemented).

The parameter number tells which window or screen to set it to. For example,
to set the current output to window 7...

   Gui Gfx 0,7
***
Good luck

	Magnus

Thanks Magnus.  I guess I just did not put Gui Gfx and Gui Text together.  I
will try it out and let you know how it works out.

Gui Active X
Gui Text X,Y,TXT$

It might be a different command than gui active, but, just like amos screens,
you have to tell it which one to draw in first. If you do that, but just
didn't mention it in your description, then I am stumped.

Hey All,
I've officialyl changed the Amos Quirks page to
the amos Help page, due largely to the nature of
the "quirks" sent to me by Andy Crowe, they were more like
general help than bugs in amos, but hey that's no problem!
I put the new pages up (with some additions, tell me if their
no good Andy)  
Anyway I am hard at work on setting up a searchable
archive of the Mailing List records, just so I don't work
so hard for nothing, there isn't such a thing out there already is
there??

With permision I'd like to put the Amos Optimization Tips
from the aminet onto the page, it's a really good file
I'd like to put it on my search engine.  

Ok and again I implore everyone to check out the site and send
their Amos knowledge this way!  Thanks,
scooter d. matott sxe

BTW-
Andy, I was unsure if I should include your error trapping routine,
it is good, but I am worried it has some extension commands in it,

Oh and while I'm thinking of it...
the official amos cite or the aminet has a coy of the Amos Pro Manual,
am I clear to put that jub up on the cite for searching??
thanks...

	Thanks,

   wu-hey, not bad.

I've got a few suggestions for the system though:

1. Could you have it, instead of having the codename of the email, have its subject, date and size to identify it in the list? 

2. How about stripping some of the email header?

   PS. If you like I could write a quick amos program to strip the headers and rename the files to its subject/date/size. Or you could, and probably do a better job of it too ;)

3. Finally, how about having an option to search all the years, as well as individual ones?


   anyway, great page, keep up the good work ;)

See ya.

Subject: [amos-list] GUI ext, JD & Text files
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Leto Kauler <letok@netspace.net.au>


I recently downloaded JD and GUI extensions from AMOS Factory.  I
wanted to have a look at GUI's TCP commands but there are no docs
included in the archive for them!  Apparently Giark has them... if
so, could you please send them to me, mate :)

Regarding how to create text files with standard Amiga line
returns:  it seems JD ext. has a command "Jd Setoutput Amiga". The
problem is, even with the ext. installed, AMOS doesn't appear to
recognise the command!  I put "AMOSPro_JD.Lib" in slot 22.

In the JD archive, there are numerous other extensions too. What
are these for, and where do they go?

The GUI Compiler

You don't need the GUI Compiler for your GUI Extension programs. You can =
use
the standard AMOSPro compiler without problems. The GUI Extension is a
standard AMOSPro v2 Extension and so it works fine with the AMOSPro compi=
ler,
too.

If you use the GUI compiler ALL the AMOS commands work without problems. =
It
is when you use Gui Amiga 1, shutting off unnecessary AMOS functions, tha=
t
you may run into difficulty.

How does the GUI compiler work? What's the difference? The main differenc=
e
between the GUI and AMOSPro compilers is that the compiled code generated=
 by
the GUI compiler hides all the AMOS "system unfriendly" code. If you zap =
the
code you'll see nothing AMOS related. If you zap the code generated by th=
e
standard AMOSPro compiler, you'll find tons of AMOS stuff, like the names=

of all the AMOS extensions installed in your system and other preferences=
=2E

If you trace an AMOS compiled program using SnoopDOS or other programs,
you'll notice other AMOS activities, like search for and freeze any other=

running AMOS programs, search for the mysterious AMOS_Switcher and other
stuff. The GUI Compiler removes these useless operations.

If you run a virus checker together with AMOS, it will probably pop up a
warning message because some system functions have been modified.

For experts:
- Graphics.library   LoadView() only on AGA machines
- Intuition.library  EasyRequestArgs()
- Intuition.library  AutoRequest()

the GUI Compiler removes them as well.

So essentially the GUI compiler:
- hides the AMOS rubbish in the code.
- makes your AMOS programs able to run in multitasking with the other AMO=
S
  programs. As you know you can't run two or more AMOS programs together,=

  because only the last one will run while the others will be freezed. No=
w
  you can!
- makes your programs more "clean" and virus checkers warnings free.

Since so many AMOS tags have been removed from the code, it is not a good=

idea to use it in AMOS games, for example. The GUI Compiler is specifical=
ly
designed for {B}Workbench{UB} applications. If your program runs in the W=
orkbench
environment, it doesn't need all the AMOS patches and hacks. For this rea=
son,
Pietro has created the GUI Compiler.

If you need to open AMOS screens and related stuff, use the AMOSPro compi=
ler.
If you need a nice Workbench GUI for your programs, use the GUI compiler.=


About the commands that don't work anymore, this isn't a GUI Compiler eff=
ect.
It happens if you put the Gui Amiga 1 command at the start of your progra=
m.

What does Gui Amiga 1 do and why don't some commands work anymore? Simple=
=2E
The Gui Amiga 1 command disables other AMOS internal functions in order t=
o
make your program a bit more OS friendly. In particular, this command rem=
oves
the AMOS interrupt routine. Because of this, all the VBL/interrupt-based
commands/functions don't work.

Mainly:
- Music
- Samples
- AMAL
- VBL commands and timer
- AMOS gfx

If you're creating a Workbench program, usually you don't need the above
commands, so it's a good idea to disable them.

If you do need them, don't call Gui Amiga 1 and everything will work as
usual. Therefore, Pietro suggests that you use other extensions for music=
 and
samples, because the AMOS music extension is really badly coded.

=3DTcp Address

Returns the address of the last asynchronous TCP/IP packet sent. This is
only useful with @{"Tcp Set" LINK "Tcp Set"}.

Example:
A=3DTcp Read(1,Start(10),100,0) : ADR=3DTcp Address

In order to obtain the right value, you must call this command just after=
 the
asynchronous call or at least before another asynchronous call or gui wai=

=3DTcp Free()
This will return the first free socket, starting from the specified one. =
This
command is useful if you have to handle a lot of TCP connections and need=
 to
know which sockets are free for a connection.

Example:
You are currently using TCP channels 1, 2 and 3.

A=3DTcp Free(1)

A will contain 4.

command is @{I}synchronous@{UI}. The program will halt and wait for a
message to come from the TCP connection.

This command can be set to time out by using the @{"Tcp Limit" LINK "Tcp =

The function returns the number of bytes read.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Tcp Limit"

The function returns the number of bytes sent.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Tcp Put$"

@TOC "Main"
=3DTcp Put$(<logical file number>,<string$>)

Send a string to the TCP port

e.g. X=3DTcp Put$(1,"NICK Giark")

This command works the same way as @{"Tcp Send$" LINK "Tcp Send$"}. The d=
ifference is that Tcp
Put$ is a @{I}synchronous@{UI} command. The program will halt until the d=

The function returns the number of bytes sent.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Tcp Read"
@NEXT "Tcp Remove"
@PREV "Tcp Put$"
@TOC "Main"
=3DTcp Read(<logical file number>,<buffer>,<size>)

Get <size> bytes from the channel, and put them into the <buffer>, a
previously defined AMOS bank.

e.g  S=3DStart(10) : X=3DTcp Read(1,S,100)

Using the bank as a buffer allows the command to run asynchronously. The
command doesn't wait for data to become available, it just sends a reques=
t
to the channel. When there is data to be read, Gui Wait will inform you.

A very simple example:

S=3DStart(10)
A=3DTcp Read(1,S,100)
B=3DGui Wait
If B=3D-9 : Rem TCP/IP message received
 D=3DTcp Code : Rem D=3Dnumber of bytes received
 B=3DTcp Buffer : Rem B=3Daddress of the buffer where the data is stored

=3DTcp Send(<logical file number>,<buffer>,<code>)

Send the specified number of bytes, starting from <buffer>, to the channe=
l.
Like @{"Tcp Read" LINK "Tcp Read"}, this command is asynchronous. The com=
mand doesn't wait for the
end of the transfer, but quits immediately so your program can continue i=

work. When the transfer is complete, you will receive a TCP/IP message. S=

@{"=3DTcp User" LINK "Tcp User"} command. You can change the value of the=
 user
data using Tcp Set.

Note: You can only modify this value @{b}before@{ub} calling Gui Wait. If=
 you

You can safely use this command to modify a Tcp Signal packet because it

=3DTcp Signal(<Tcp Channel>,<Mode>,<User Data>)

Tcp Signal is a major improvement to the TCP handling system. Using this
command activates the signal mode on the specified channel. Whenthere is =
data
ready for download, you will be informed.

Gui Wait will still return a -9 to indicate a TCP message, but @{"Tcp Typ=
e" LINK "Tcp Type"}
will return 20 to indicate a signal. You can also use the @{"Tcp Packet" =
LINK "Tcp Packet"} command
and compare its value with the packet ID returned by Tcp Signal. You only=
 need to
call Tcp Signal once.

The advantage is that, unlike @{"Tcp Read" LINK "Tcp Read"}, nothing will=
 be downloaded or
modified. You will just be informed that there is data to be dealt with a=
nd
you can decide for yourself how best to handle it.

This command is the asynchronous version of @{"Tcp Check" LINK "Tcp Check=

   Actually, does anyone have any example code of a program that comunicates with something via TCP (didn't someone have a telnet client written in AMOS?)

   I'd like to investigate creating a TCP networking game, but I'm not sure how these commands would relate to sending stuff over a serial link (which is what it uses now)


See ya.

hi,

its a great idea and it works almost fine. almost? well, when i enter the
keyword (maybe iam looking for my nick "citrone", i got some results where the
keyword cant be found but my real name. You have to add the full email header
to the search results. Further it would be easier if you can search through the
whole archive, from 199x-today.

i like it :-)

While we're supplying ideas, how about a next-message-in-sequence,

This is just a quick update, will answer all your questions when I get
more time, thanks for checking out the cite,hope you find it useful
I already have... :)

1) I have added a multi-year search feature
	Try it from 1993 and 1999 to see why I left it out the first time
	it take forever and returns more hits than is useful, esp.
	if you're not good with keywords...

2) sped up the search a bit (eliminated need to drag up a 
	directory of all the files, now it just hops through them
	on it's own, makes it a bit faster...)

3) I will answer all the other questions and such in a larger 
	letter, need time to explain how the searhc works, then maybe
	you can suggest how to add wanted features...

thanks again, glad you like it, 



	Thanks,
	      Scott Matott sXe

Subject: [amos-list] Inserting data into memory banks
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>

Hello all,
  I have a bit of a dilemma with a new project I have just started.
Firstly, the project is just a small utility that reads digest emails
created at onelist.com and converts them to Amigaguide files.  So my program
looks for specific keywords and adds the appropriate amigaguide command text
into the email which is stored in memory.  Once complete the amigaguide file
is saved to disk.

  The problem that I am having is that when I add the amigaguide command
text to the file it over-writes existing text and what I want is to insert
it and move everything else along not unlike a text editor.  I am thinking
that I will have to copy parts of the memory bank but am checking if there
is an easier way to do it.  Any ideas?
Thanks.

Declan.

From: Rod Whiteley <rwhiteley@magnet.com.au>

G'Day all,
I've just read Oliver Wagner's white paper on the Amiga and Y2K at the
amiga.com site, whilst most of our OS is Y2K-proofed since it uses the Unix
style 'days since an epoch' method for describing a date, I am now just a
little bit worried because I have an A1200 with an external battery backed up
clock. How many other people have A1200's who put a third party battery
backed up clock in, which Oliver describes as having more or less the
standard PC type 2 digit year field Y2K problem? More worryingly,  there
seems to be no immediate solution. Oh dear. Any ideas?
Cheers,
Rod

Hi Declan,

I'm not sure how you're going about this task, but have you tried the Insstr$
command from AMCAF? I did something similar to this a few years ago(converting
HPGL plotter files to an ancient form of binary compressed code so I could use
an OLD HP plotter with the Amiga). For that I used the Ldos ext especially the
Lreplace command. I basically loaded the entire file into a bank using Sload
did the Lreplace and Insstr$ stuff and then saved the whole mess in one
operation with Ssave. As I recall it workedd really well, though others will
probably have a truely elegant solution.

Hope this helps.

Dale

The way I would do it (probably not the best, most efficient etc, but its my 
way) would be to create a second bank and copy the first sequentially. 
Whenever I hit a a specific keyword, i`d tag on the Amigaguide command and 
continue, repeating as necessary.

Usually it is best to generate output as you read the
input, so there isn't lots of hassle moving things
around in memory.  You should be able to get away with
reading one line at a time and processing that, if the
digest format is anything sensible.

Eh?  Is this for adding links between mails to follow
keywords, or to follow threads?  Or are the "keywords"
parts of the email header?

You could have a linked list containing sections of
text, this would minimise copying.  Have a new node in
the list for each line, and then if that line needs
commands it can be split into lots of nodes, so only
the data on that line has to be copied.

Example:


This is
some /example/ text
for conversion.


1: "This is"
2: "some "
3: "@{i}"
4: "example"
5: "@{ui}"
6: " text"
7: "for conversion."


No real commands, just using /italics/ as an example.


Hope this helps.

Claude

Hi,
Could anyone please help? I managed spill water on my computer desk. Miggy
and most of my disks on it survived but Pinball Fantasies   -disks are now
corrupted:( I know this sounds a bit lame but is it possible for anyone to
send them to me? This is irritating 'cause those disks were really
original:(((  I really need those disks - I use PBF to evaluate all ball
movements and hits with my Pinball Construction Kit. I've already downloaded
demo of it from aminet but it's nothing like the original:(

At the same time I could ask if there's anyone volunteer for beta testing of
PBCK or actually just player-version of it. I think I can manage to complete
a beta of it within a month!  Just send me (directly) your miggys specs...
The beta-version is meant especially for Blade Runner -fans;)

G'Day all,
A terrible thought just entered my tiny brain: as a means of avoiding the
aforementioned Y2K problem with the battery backed up clock in my A1200's, I
guess I could entertain the idea of new hardware, which made me wonder how
stable, functional, useful, is UAE on a PC with respect to AMOSPro. Before I
get flamed horrendously, let me explain that this would, of course, only be a
stop-gap measure until our new machines come out at the end of this year (?)
It's probably best to reply privately to me rather than bore the rest of the
list, so if anyone's using UAE and AmosPro+extensions, let me know please.
Cheers,

I allways loved playing FirePower! Some ideas!

- Really I splitscreen on 1 comp. for two player game.
- Maybe some ground troops that can "break you up".
- Maybe some villages a long the way.
- Landmines!!!!!!
- Offcourse enemy from the air (helicopters, airplanes, zeppelins?)

I will come up with more.
Some notes: I think we can call Pittfal (The Project) dead. Really I shame. 
I do have very little time (Work, study), so cannot start I project of 
myself, because it never will be finished.

hmm...  the Y2K problem won't make your amiga fail or anything... 
It'll just reset the clock when you reboot...  
and i'm pretty sure someone is working on fixing that:)

In any case it won't affect amos pro at all unless you're writing something that has to have the exact time and date:)  (and anyone with an inet connection can install one of the many clock synchronizers and have their time corrected when they go online:)

This May sound nuts, but I have a VERY simple y2k solution for all of you...
Just rip your friggin battery out!
I did it to my A3000, now every time I start it up the machine thinks
it's 1978!  None of my files are ever date-stamped right, BIG DEAL!
Honestly i can't see how a home user could care...

From: "Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>

 Ok here is my promised explanation...

My search engine does this...
It has 4 loops!

1) Loop by year

2) Loop by month

3) Loop by File
	load message file
4) Loop by Pattern
	Search for patterns in message text
	This loop is short as it aborts as soon as it fails
	to find a pattern entered with the AND operator
	And OR searches can be done all at once,
	so scott AND matott takes at most two loops
	scott OR matott takes only one pass..
 
4) next pattern

3) Next File

2) Next Month

1) Next Year

	It loads the ENTIRE file as one big string and searches it...
	This is the fastest way otherwise we'd need a 5th loop
	between 3 and 4 to loop by line in file searchign for the pattern
	and things would get VERY slow!!

	If it matches all patterns, then it stores the file name
	in an array which is later printed to the HTML page 

	This makes certain things impossible...
	1) Show Message Subject as part of the Links List print out

		This can't be done, I'd need a way to get to the
		SUBJECT: line of file, but since I load the entire
		file up there is no way to goto just anyone line..
	I guess I could use a split command to try and work it out...

	2) Similarly a NEXT MESG IN THREAD feature is not possible.
		To be honest I was a bit peeved at this suggestion...
	 I understand how nice it would be to have, but all the same
	 I felt like "If you want the bloody thing you code it yourself!"
	 I mean can you imagine the headache it would be to try and
	 sort out threads from the mass of messages I have??
	 It'd be one thing on NEWS-GROUP ARCHIVE, but the mailing
	 list is just a stack of messages divided by date...
	AND dont' anybody wirte in saying how easy this would be unless
	they have perl code to hand me with their cheap words!!	

	I'm sorry, esp to Keith, it wasn't an ureasonable suggestion
	it's just one of those things that sounds maybe easier than it
	is to do, also it's the kind of thing user's like to take
	for granted when it's there...
	
	Anyway, thanks for all the postive words I will be listing the
	cite with Amiga Web Directory today so it is more or less done in
	my eyes, well enjoy!

	Thanks,
	      Scott Matott sXe

Has anybody got the AMOS PD CD out there??
why hasn't that archive ever been made available ofr
public download on some ftp??
The music files and sprites would be useful,
also the samples, obviously I could get them by
plunking out for a copy of the CD, but if the stuf
is really in the Public Domain why don't we put up
for downloading??
I could provide space and a cite to host it...

Subject: [amos-list] New game? Or Fantasy...
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Leto Kauler <letok@netspace.net.au>


I've come up with what I think would be a ripper game. What I need
is comments, suggestions... etc, etc.

Do you all remember "Firepower"?  That tank game where you go
capture the opponent's flag and make it back to base to win...
Well, I'm thinking a doing a 'remake'.  There is actually a nice
game called Firepower on Aminet which was made in AMOS, but this
lacks a lot of things.

Firstly, I've been planning for your tank to be controlled with
the keyboard (that the body, direction bit), but then you can use
the mouse to control the aiming of the turret!  It might sound
strange, but I lurrrrrve the idea.

The graphics are "3D" rendered, 32 colour, sorta top and front
view.

I was thinking of having "hills" over which to drive, with slopes
changing the angle of driving, aiming, etc.  How to do this
escapes me at the moment... but it sounds nifty.

The big clincher though would be Net play, which is why I was
asking those questions earlier.   I want to have Net play, and the
ability to have "mugshots" of yourself which gets sent to whoever
you play with..... and you get theirs.

Then maybe split two-player on same comp.  With different types of
games.... deathmatch, capture flag, co-op, etc.

So... yeah... I lotta work, which I don't know if I could pull
off, but send along your ideas, etc.

Hi all,
Have you seen Personnal-extension on Aminet. Go and check it! It supports
aga screens, fast icon commands, and multiple color rainbows!
I liked it although it's little slow and it's only a demo. It makes also
Amiga to crash when exiting but hey, so does Turbo (at least on my miggy). I
think this extension has a potential:)

   Well, I haven't used the AMOSPro editor on WinUAE, but I have run some of my games on it. There is a problem with text if you set the CPU to highest emulated priority, but apart from that it all seems to work.

   Like Snes SmashTV eh? You should have an option to use a CD32 pad: + pad to move the tank and the buttons to fire in the resective direction, as this'd make it easy to 2player.

(or use two joysticks, and have support for the 4pl adapter)

   And if you had two keyboard players, then you could have 4 human players which would be even better ;)

   Well, you'd have to store the Z level of the tanks too, and move the shots in Z as well. 

   Although, this may not help gameplay, by making it hard to judge shots etc.

   use screencopy to have 4 players, even better ;)

Why on earth would anyone want to rip the battery out?:)
The effect would be the same as leaving it in:)

I don't have any perl code, but I think it is
possible,
by extracting all of the messages with the same
subject
(excluding Re: and [amos-list]) you get an entire
thread,
then sort this by date.  After that you can move 
forwards and backwards through a thread.  Dealing with
Was: might be trickier.

just flipping through the messages here, and oddly enough...
I do own FirePower, I found it in the back of some used software
shop with a tag that read $20, it was the only piece of Amiga
software I'd seen on a retail shelf in 3 years (this was back in 97)
I told the clerk I'd give him $5 for it, he looked at said
"Do know what an Amiga is?"
I said "I own one!"
"$5 it is."
:)

The game actually sucks, terrible control, but the idea is sound,
so sound there is a playstation send-up out there which is quite 
a bit of fun...

some notes:

1) I too love the mouse-aim, keyboard-drive idea, but
	that makes net-play a must, as two players
	is the only way to go, one player is such a bore...

2) The PSX send up feature several kinds of vehicles you could use
	this offered some variety and made for fun situations
	like a jeep trying to out-run a heuy-copter after 
	stealing the flag...

3) One thing about the games I never liked was that the bases were
	pre-generated, you could get just as lost in your own
	base as in the other guys!  
	Adding a base-build/design phase may seem tricky, but
	it coudl add lots of replay to the game...

just a story and some ideas...

I have some AMOS code to read a second mouse, so you
can plug two mice in and 2play.  On its way soon...

Getting into Command&Conquer territory, which is
probably a bigger project than you need...
Maybe design bases in a paint package (different
colours = different buildings?)

	yes but it's not like the messages are in some handy
database for me, it's not like Subject: means anything, it's
just some line of text in the mail message, it's only your
mail program that makes Subject: look like it's anything fancy
A mail message looks like this:

>From sdsfdsfds@thsgd.dsfds,rt. to ...
	blah blah blah describing where the message traveld to get to you

From: fsdf
To:
Date:
Subject:
(message text)

There is no standard to how far down (ie what line) Subject: appears
on because the top header describing the path the message took can be
as long as it needs to be, depending on ho many hops a messages takes to
get home...

Also there isn't even a (real) standard for the normal header that we're used
to, it doesn't ahve to be there by anymeans, on a unix box type
sendmail johnny@wherever
then type anythign you want followed by a line wht justr a period like
.
and wahlah, johnny will get a message with NO subject header, No Nothing!

Email is just text, nothing more, nothing special,
if I wanted to sort these messages by subject or by date
I'd have to build the data base myself!

	It's ok, I kind of went off the handle the other day, guess I was jsut
sort of exhausted with the project, I knew that people would want things by
subject when I was doing it, there just didn't seem to be any real easy
way to do it.   
	My idea was more or less just to get the archives up and
searchable, and even w/o subject sorting the are still quite useful,
the search takes a bit, I could have used a scheme like Glimpse
to make it faster, but unless the cite starts getting some ungodly
number of hits that shouldn't be necessary.

Anyway, I really like the atmosphere on this list, especially the
freedom people have to make suggestions for and even critize one 
another's work and I just hope I haven't spoiled that any by my
errant reaction to what were really very, very reasonable suggestions.

So I was diggin through the archives this mornign cause I knew
the question'd been flown around the list about a million times
and I discovered to get Amos3d working under AmosPro one needs
amospro_3d.lib off productiivty disk #2 no less, :)
Well I of course have this disk, but it's tucked away
safely in a closet back home in New York and I am here at 
school in chicago, so...

unless the library is copied to one's hard disc as part of the strd install
(in which case I got it)
I was wondering if anyone had a copy they could zap me real quick.

Hey I would like to start add an Archive of banks to the Help Pages,
I was thinking wouldn't it be need if there was a just amos archive
of good snd/fx and useful bobs/icons.
I know over the years I have amassed a pile of snd/fx and
some good icons what about putting together a cite 
with .abk files arched with a small readme?

I have got it in the productivity2/extensions/ drawer, and as I never
did anything with it, I suppose it was put there by the standard
install.

From: Rod Whiteley <rwhiteley@magnet.com.au>

G'Day all,
sorry to bring this up again, but a couple of responses seemed to suggest that
the Amiga has no Y2K type problem, whilst this is almost correct (since it
uses the Unix style days since a given epoch date method, rather than the
standard DDMMYY) the devil is in the detail. The worry for me as I said is
that the battery backed up clocks (3rd party ones that is) for the A1200 DO
use the dreaded DDMMYY notion. There are some other Y2K type issues depending
on your machine and OS, but they are rather more complex. It's probably
worthwhile looking at the Y2K paper that Oliver Wagner wrote, you can find it
at www.amiga.com
Oh, and btw, I do need to have accurate date and time every day, I use my
amiga here at work for all our accounting/billing procedures (a proggy I
wrote in AmosPro), and it would be a pain in the arse to have to re-enter
date and time every time I start up. Unfortunately, it's sounding like that's
what I'll have to do
Cheers,
Rod

Anyone worried about this needs only to set their clock with the Preferences
programme to 11:58pm 31 December 1999 then switch off and cold start their
machine a few minutes later. I did this and the Preferences programme
correctly displayed the year as 2000, and February as having 29 days. Not all
clocks are the same, of course, but checking this now will allow you time to
buy another if necessary.

You ought to disable programmes in the WBStartup drawer which use the date
(like Remind) before doing this. Temporarily move them somewhere else.

David

   Ah, using home written programs? Excelent, here's what you do:

Simply put your clock back a few years, and then modify your program to automatically adjust to it.


   Or, if you use your amiga online a lot, get a clock syncroniser, I think there is one on aminet that grabs the correct time/date everytime you go online, therefore bypassing your batterybacked up clock.


   Anyway, you've still got plenty of time left (famous last words) so who knows? You may buy (or be given? ;) a better accelerator with a battery backed up clock on it ;)

See ya.

Oh dear.  Yawn.  Do I have to solve the Y2K alleged "problem" with amigas ??

You are all programmers.

You know how to get the date from a shell.

You know how to add.

You know how to set the date from a shell.

How hard can it be guys ??

In the unlikely event your clock can't deal with it, it should take you 5
mins to solve.  Stop messing about, you aren't brainless peecee owners.  (If
you were brainless, you wouldn't be on the list)

Subject: [amos-list] Compiler 'send amos to back on booting' problem
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   I have found that if I select 'send amos to back on booting' in the compiler menu, then my compiled program becomes rather unstable, especially around error handeling routines. (even if I call 'AMOS TO FRONT' during the program)

   Does anyone know why it does this, or how I can fix it please? I'd like amos not to put its custom screen straight up when it starts...

See ya.

News Release 24/7/99
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amiga Information Online has set up a Utilities PD Toplist. So if you
have three favourite Utilities that you would like to give credit to
then why not show your support for those programs and send us your
votes.

It is very simple, all you have to do is give 3 points to your favourite
Util, 2 points to your second favourite and then 1 point to your third
favourite utility of all time.

The only restriction is you can only vote of PD/Shareware type software
and not Commercial. By commercial I mean you don't register. It still
holds it open to vote for Utilities like Miami, AmIRC and the like.

If you are interested please return the form to the address below,

-Cut-

1st Util (3 Points) : [Enter util name here]
2nd Util (2 Points) : [Enter util name here]
3rd Util (1 Point)  : [Enter util name here]

Subject: [amos-list] Anyone remember Mr Amos Club and Totally Amos?
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Neil <neily@chilled.club24.co.uk>

Hi, how's it going, just subbed, so I thought I'd introduce myself to all
you lovely people.  Joined up for this list in a fit of nostalgia, been
playing C64 games all week, and got to thinking of the amount of fun I had
with Amos.  Decided to have a quick hunt on Onelist, and was delighted to
find this list.

Anyway, anyone here remember the Mr Amos Club, run by Brian Bell (helped by
me, Neil Kennedy), or does anyone remember Totally Amos, run by Anne and
Len Tucker?  Both of these were great disk-mags, are they available on the
net anyplace by the way?

I had fun contributing to those disk-mags, and the reason that I've been
getting nostalgic about this sort of stuff, is because I've remembered how
much *fun* I had back then.  Computing was a real laugh back then.

Anyway, I can already feel myself getting tempted to plug the Amiga 500+ in
again, and fire up that dusty old copy of Amos Pro.  I'll just have a few
more games of Sentinel and Ghost-busters first though, lol!

Cheerio
Neil

Hi Everybody,

   Ok, um, what ever happened to AmosNG??

Come on guys, we're going to need a portable version of AMOS for when the AmigaNG comes out, or were all out of a job ;)

So, is AmosNG still in developement? If not, WHY NOT.


PS. On the subject of over due stuff, where's the GUI ext. version 2? Did I miss it?

See ya.

Use the /open default screen/ option instead. Then, either leave it black or
put up a "loading" screen. If you do this, remember not to use screen 0
without opening in first.

Pietro is AWOL. I have a beta and am writing the docs for it. The last I
heard, he was doing a major revamp of the tcp section of the code. That was a
few months ago. Either his dairy business is taking up all of his time, he has
lost his net connection again, or his amiga has died.

Well, there's nothing that hasn't been on the maillist. However the last major
message form Pietro to the list was removed from the site due to some
copyright trouble or something. So, sorry, no news you aren't aware of
already.

   no no no no no no, thats not why I want it: 

I want it not to put the AMOS screen up, because I'm making it gfx card compatible, and before I had to call 'amos to back' straight away, but still flashed the pal display up on loading, and apparently mucks CGX up.

Anyway I've worked it out, so I've got no problem now ;)

See ya.

I remember both as my brother used to get them :) And the Witby Amos Club
disk magazines as well.

Brian Bell got millions of orders for his Charlie Chimp Amiga Format
winning game remember :)?

He made loads of money and then moved into a special building and a few
days later all his computer equiptment was stolen and he had to spend
most of the money buying new computers :(

Yeah, actually that's how I met Brian, through ordering a copy of his game,
which was brilliant.  Then I started writing loads of stuff for the MAC
disks, and ended up being elevated to "sub-editor" or something, lol.
Brian was/is a great guy, and we used to spend hours on the phone
discussing programing and stuff (I live in Belfast too).  We were planning
to start work on a few projects together, and I was writing, among other
things, an Alien Breed clone in Amos.  I also wrote an agony column, with
some made-up "funny" letters, and some real ones that I received from
places as far away as Australia.  It was great fun working on that diskmag,
and I was proud to be a part of it.  

It was very different to disk-mags like Totally Amos, with it's rave music,
and funky graphics.  Brian was a very talented programmer, and the disk-mag
engine was fantastic back then.  Still got the source code for it here
somewhere, I should give it to you guys, because I don't think it was ever
actually released.

>He made loads of money and then moved into a special building and a few
>days later all his computer equiptment was stolen and he had to spend
>most of the money buying new computers :(

Yeah, he used to work in a wee caravan/trailer-type thing in his back
garden before that.  Big things were going to happen for him, Ashley (his
graphics man) and me, but then he got all his stuff nicked, and I dropped
out of the computer scene altogether for about 3 years, to drink beer and
smoke dope.  Got back into computers last year, but sadly I'm not on an
Amiga.  Yet 8)

I'm glad someone else remembers the good old days though, I know that Brian
put a lot of work into all his projects, and we both had a great laugh
working on the diskmag.

Oh God, I'm busting to fire up Amos Pro now, but my mates got my old
power-brick.  It's a shame there was never an equivalent version of Amos
for the PC.  When I first got on the net last year, I hunted around for
Amos stuff, and could only find something called "Multimedia Fusion" which
Francois had been working on.  Seemed crappy though, not a real programming
language from what I could gather, and it never seemed to actually get
released.

Hi,
   Man, I'm back after two weeks of non-computery stuff. Well almost,
I was at the WOA on Saturday (nice!). Geez, i's been TWO weeks since
I've done any real typing, and doing this now feels weird, so
apologies in advance for any typos :))

Right. I'm now replying to mails again (wahey!) so any queries
directed straight at me (like, why didn't I come to the WOA dressed as
a chicken?) to the usual addy :)))

BTW, that Sandra out of Annex is HOOOOTTTTTT!!!!!

But havin' said that, I f**ked my g/f last night. And then she goes
and spoils it all by throwing up on me (she was pissed) :)
Cya!

Hello Neil,
  Mr Amos Club, I remember it well.  You can find issues 1-6 and a few other
things at http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Campus/6256/amos.html

  I actually remember some of your contributions, did you do the article on
artificial intelligence?  You were right about one thing, it sure was a
great diskmag that had some excellent tutorials and example code.  If you
are aching to get back into programming Amos Pro why not try WinUAE for your
PC, I am assuming you are using a PC, and run Amos Pro on it.  WinUAE is an
Amiga emulator and it and numerous other emulators can be found at
http://madjock.emulationworld.com/.  I have WinUAE running Amos Pro here in
work and toy around with it whenever I get a spare half hour, I really did
it to see if I could and it works perfectly.  Enjoy......

Declan.

It would be a problem if you were not an amos programmer.. if you have y2k
problem with your battery backed up clock, then here is an idea:
set your clock eg. 01.01.1980 and save it.when amos reads clock from system,
add 20 years to date within your accounting program and it will be
"01.01.2000", you can write a date modifying sub routine also, to correct
day names.

note:
if you can understand something from my bad english, you can fix y2k problem
also :))

Brilliant!  I never even thought of that,even though I've been running a
C64 emulator all week.  Winuae works brilliantly, but now I have a problem.

There doesn't seem to be any way to get my PC to read my original AMOS Pro
disks,,,is there anywhere I can download AMOS Pro from?  

I'll have to get a way of transferring files eventually, because I've got
about thirty disks of source code, including the source for the MAC diskmag
engine!  I would like to eventually do a special episode of MAC, to clear
up what happened last time.  I could call round to Brians house, get stoned
with him, and then do an interview for the mag.  Should be a good laugh,
and I have loads of source-code to stick on there.

So, anywhere I can get Amos Pro from?  I'm gagging for it!

Hi Declan and all. I went to the madjock link and it listed KickStart
as required file (Kick13.zip or Kick30.zip) I tried for the latter, but
after two days the link still seems dead. Aminet has no Kick30.zip, but
it does have a program to copy the Kick ROM to file. What did you use,
Declan?

Hello Michael,
  The file used to copy your 3.0 rom to a file is called Transrom and should
come with the WinUAE archive in the Amiga Programs directory.  Another small
utility in the same directory is transdisk which copies your amiga disks to
files for use in WinUAE.  If you still cannot find them let me know and I
will send them to you.

Declan.

Nope, been hunting for it all night, with no joy.  

Does anyone have any ideas where a copy of Amos Pro would be?  Or can
anyone email it to me?  I'd be very grateful.

Same thing happened to me each time I installed AMCAF. I asked Chris Hodges
about it, and he was a bit puzzled, saying that it shouldn't have happened.
The first time I did it (AMCAF v1.44 I think), I just re-installed AMOSPro,
then all of the extensions, and finally AMCAF, but chose not to install the
AMCAF help files, and my original help files were left unmolested. Then, like
the dill that I am, when I installed the full version that I reg'd from
Chris, I asked to install AMCAF's help files... so it was re install time
again as my help files were then trashed. Then along comes the new version,
and, wait for it, yup I tromoped on my help files again. This time I haven't
bothered to re-install (and when I posed this question to the list, no-one
had a quick fix). So now, I keep the AMOSPro book close at hand, and wait for
a simple solution to fall across my Incoming folder....please...

This is almost 100% certain! The new CPU in the new Amiga's wil be 
Transmeta, from the company Transmeta. Also Linus the maker of Linux works 
there. And the new Amiga's will contain a Linux-based kernel.


p.s. If anyone knows more about it, let me know!

	Yes you can Leto, you just ahve to let your mind go, use
the Amiga multi-taksing force!!
	AMCAF comes with complete docs in AmigaGuide Format
open the docs in AmigaGuide on your workbench, load amos and then use
left-Amiga-A to switch back and forth between the Workbench and Amos
this is actually better than using the Amos Help docs because is
it spares you the trouble of loading up the danged Help interface 
all the time.
enjoy!

	Who did the extension again, If I can get the Pt commands working
right for use in my Movie Maker project I will send them the cash anyway,
it is very nice!

	If you already have the original disk you don't need to go score
illicit copies.  of course the PC can't read an Amiga floppy, but an
Amiga can read a PC floppy, arc the disks and copy them to PC floppy
then to your PC.  Obviously you will have to fire up your old 'Miggy
for this, but it'll do you some good anyhow.  :)

	As for WinUAE and kickstart files, I'm not surprised the links
you found busted out quickly.  Amiga still owns the Copyright on those
roms and is VERY serious about hanging onto it, largely because they are
still developing OS 3.5, they have a big stake in not seeing the AmigaOS
become freeware.  Of course so does Clanato, that Italian Company responsibl
for Personal Paint (bet they're sad to see Amiga Inc Signing with Corel,
though Corel Draw ain't much better IMHO) who are also trying to Hauk
a modified version of UAE with Amiga Inc. certified Roms for 40 USD.

While was writing that last message (about WinUAE and roms)
it occurred to me to ask you guys a quickie:

Anyone planning to pick up OS 3.5??

It looks like a sizeable enhancement over OS 2.1 that I run,
but over 3.0/3.1 that most you all have??   Any thoughts?

Also when is it going to be released already, the NG amigas
are supposed to be out in winter...

The Amiga's icon is the Boing Ball, and Linux's icon is Tux the
Penguin.  This can mean only one thing...

Penguins with Balls!

Wasn't the Boing sound a mangled recording of a cricket bat hitting the
side of a garage?  That makes for very tough Penguins if they have been
hit in the Balls with cricket bats B-).

Anybody wanna do a graphic?

Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Leto Kauler <letok@netspace.net.au>


I don't know if there's been a reply about the AMCAF docs
question, but I also recently installed it after finding that it
is now fully released on Aminet (but it certainly would've been
worth the shareware fee).

I found that the docs which the installer is supposed to append to
the internal AMOS Help stuff only works for pressing the [help]
key while the cursor is over a command.  There doesn't appear to
be any additional menus added.

This is a pain b'coz you can't nicely browse thru AMCAF's
commands!

BTW: Which slot does GUI extension go in?  I thought it was 8, but
AMCAF goes there and GUI refuses to load if I put it in 8!

Transmeta recently passed a brand new patent this week for a truly amazing
piece of microchip. maybe it will be in the new Amiga!

Let's just say that this will make an incredibly fast microchip  =))

   nah, I'm not bothering with 3.5: waste of time for me as a) I don't have the 3.1 roms and b) I don't need anything else for my A1200, all the patches I have make it look nice and I already have more internet software then I need.

   And of course, I'll need to save up as much money as possible to buy an Amiga NG ;)

See ya.

   Nah, wait 'till they get quantum processors working! Now that'd be fast.

(actually, I wonder what the current dev. status of 'em are, last year they had a quantum transister working didn't they? or is going a little too offtopic?)

Yep, kind of guessed that I could do that, but I was looking to get AMOS

mates.  I'll have to look at transferring the files tomorrow if I can get
the power supply back. I had an old copy of Messydos knocking about, that

I actually OWN a legal copy of Amiga Forever by Cloanto, which comes with
the latest version of PPaint, which runs quicker than a standard 1200 on my
new P550, but seems slower than my 68060 based amiga.

Sounds like a great idea !  As does the new gen amiga, the a\box, the
pre\box, the amiga "vacuum" cleaner(well, maybe not), ppc chips and amiga
emulators.

It would be soooooo nice to see it working.  Wake me up when it does.
(PS, if any of that didn't sound serious, it actually was meant seriously)

	yeah, if you run any OS past 2.1 it will have CrossDos built in too,
but if not messyDOs should do the trick, though I advise keeping your files
sizes as small as possible, I used to get lots of errors with MessyDOS and
somehow learned to associate it with files > 400k.
good luck!

Wow!  Downloaded the MAC disks and ran them for the first time ever
last night, believe it or not the Club was kind of before my time (not
to make anyone feel old, I was still hacking a c64 back in those days...

Well I gotta say they are NICE!  The menu prog won't run right
on my NTSC machine, but the sample programs run fine and man am I
impressed....
I already ported the Iff font routine for simple use in my programs, love
it!  
Of course I have one big question...

Where did you guys learn to draw like that?!!!!
Charlie the chimp looks georgus (well as georgus as a monkey can look anyhow)
The extra gfx on there are great as well, really like the (very big!) Metal
Man for the SF clone...  ANd the all the backdrops looked so good!

I would kill for that kind of gfx talent, how'd you guys get so good??

Andy,

I am in the same boat I guess, with OS 2.1, I'm not sure OS 3.5 is worth 
the trouble, but honestly in my heart I feel as if I should buy a copy,
I mean the Amiga's survived hell to see a new product release, OS 3.5
is like the beginning of the great revival, I feel like I ought to
support it...

Subject: [amos-list] Sample Playing, PT Raw...
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>

Awhile back I asked about PT raw and somebody replied
saying the custom audio chips could only handle samples
so big and anything bigger needed to be buffered in,
well it's taken me forever to get backon this one, but

Pt Raw truncates nearly every sound I give it, so does the sample
player for Doom Music!

it starts terds out very early on big sample and dies jsut
before then end of small samples...

I am very saddened by this...
I am writing the Movie Maker theing to put snds and anims together
would be great to be able to add music, esp. to be able to support
so many music formats as does DME, but as always, playing 
a sample messes up the playing of the music.  saerched the
list archives, no luck with Pt Raw, does it run fine on your guy's
machines???

Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Arash Tavakoli <arash@online.no>

Hi ppl:)

this is to all those who worried abt y2k for miggys:)

I re-read the Amiga y2k page on amiga.com, and I found I had mis-read something which
others probably have too:)

(this is abt amigas and not badly-written apps:)

As far as I can see, the only time problems amigas with 3rd party battery backups
will have is in the year 2078 when the rom reads the 78 as 1978, and in 2046
when the signed 32bit integer  "rolls over" :)

a value between 00 and 77 is interpreted as 2000+value
a value between 78 and 99 is interpreted as 1900+value

So DDMMYY doesn't matter for amigas.

(for some reason i thought the 00 would be read as 1978... I think it was a magazine not-to-be-named-here that confused me into thinking that...)


(sorry if this seems sooo obvious to those of you who weren't as confused abt
it as me:)

Regards,
Arash Tavakoli

The limit is 131072 bytes (or close), due to Paula.
To get around this you can use AmigaOS audio.device,
sending max-length blocks one after the other until
the sample is all played (the iorequests are queued).

>From AMOS I don't know.  I could probably give code
for playing one long sample, but more than one would
be pretty tricky.

Try chopping samples up into smaller samples. 
(Tricky)

Try transposing the samples an octave up (resample)
and playing them at a lower pitch.  (Poor quality)

Basically, if you chop 131072 bytes from the end until
there is less than that left, that is what will play.
So a 140000 bytes sample will play only 9000 bytes.

Personally I get a bit worried if someone tries to
make me feel guilty if I don't buy something from
them.

Hi

Here is that code I promised to read the second mouse
port. I
haven't tested it myself, but it looks feasible, and
was from
a mag (I think Amiga Shopper).  Not exactly OS legal,
but that
doesn't matter anymore.

Someone asked quite a while ago though...


Claude




' magic registers

_JOY0DAT = $DFF00A  ' standard mouse port
_JOY1DAT = $DFF00C  ' second mouse port

' initialise

mousex = 0
mousey = 0

counterx = Peek(_JOY1DAT+1)
countery = Peek(_JOY1DAT  )

DO      ' main loop

    ' should probably waitvbl, but not strictly
necessary

    oldcounterx = counterx
    oldcountery = countery

    counterx = Peek(_JOY1DAT+1)
    countery = Peek(_JOY1DAT  )

    deltax = counterx - oldcounterx
    deltay = countery - oldcountery

    ' counters wrap, correct deltas
    IF deltax < -128 THEN deltax = deltax + 256
    IF deltax >  127 THEN deltax = deltax - 256
    IF deltay < -128 THEN deltay = deltay + 256
    IF deltay >  127 THEN deltay = deltay - 256

    ' do fancy effects (eg acceleration, gravity) here

    mousex = mousex + deltax
    mousey = mousey + deltay

    ' keep within screen bounds here

LOOP
