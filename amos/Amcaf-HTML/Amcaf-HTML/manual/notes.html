<h1>Notes</h1>

<br>

<p>
If you haven't already installed AMCAF, you should do so as soon as
possible, because no example program runs without the AMCAF extension
(which is quite obvious ;-) ).</p>

<p>
The installation process is quite easy and quickly done. Just read the
instructions carefully which appear when you start the installation
program.</p>

<p>
During the process you will be asked to enter your name, if you are using
a registered version. Please enter it correctly. It will be encrypted and
saved into the extension file. Remember that you MUST NOT copy the
registered version of AMCAF to anybody else. YOU have paid for this
software, why should someone else get it for free?</p>

<p>
AMCAF can either be written directly onto hard disk or onto a copy of your
AMOSPro_System disk. When installing to disk, AMCAF allows you to either
delete some files directly on the disk to get some free space for the
extension or to copy the system files to a new disk (preferably FFS),
which is formatted by the program directly.</p>

<p>
Due to lack of space on the examples disk, the file "mod.no good" has been
written onto the installation-disk. The only program that needs this file
is the demo "NoGood.AMOS". It automatically loads the file either from
the install disk or hard disk.</p>

<p>
To unleash the power of the command "Set Rain Colour", the main Amos Pro
library must be modified a bit (or better: a byte). So please first start
the program "SetRainColourPatch" and then restart AMOS Professional. This
patch remains permanently so you have only to start it once.</p>

<p>
The examples haven't been written for you to start them, look at them for
a moment and then load the next. Most of the programs are well
documented and allow you to learn something new.
Take your time, it's worth it.</p>

<p>
Some commands are very sensitive against abuse. Do save your programs
regularly, especially when you've added a new routine.</p>
