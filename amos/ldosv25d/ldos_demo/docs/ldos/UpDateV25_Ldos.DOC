Ldos V2.5(3) is (c) Copyright by Niklas Sjöberg
See LdosV25.DOC for information about how to register and/or send bugreports.

Changes from version 1 to version 2
-----------------------------------
o Fixed a bug in Lpp Mem. Due to some aritmethic error files >64 kb
  would show a totally wrong value and you could easily crash the
  machine by reserving to little memory.

o Added Lmatch		- Powerful patternmatching, KS2 only.

o Added Lcrypt		- Crypting of datafiles.

o Added Ldecrypt

o Added Lset Var	- Routines for using environmentvariables.

o Added Lget Var	- KS2 only.

o Added Ldelete Var

o Fixed 'bug' in all Ldevice-routines. Could cause an AMOS-task to still
  survive when AMOS was quit. This meant that trying to start AMOS once
  again directly after (often) had no effect. I still don't know if this
  was due to a 'feature' of AMOS or Ldos. Rewrote most of the code, remo-
  ved all stack-usage and, voilá...

o Added Lchk Data	- Calculate checksum for OFS datablocks.

o Added Lchk Boot	- Calculate checksum for Bootblocks.

o Added Lansi		- Powerful ANSIhandling-routine.

o Added Lcat Push	- Commands for handling of recursive "Lcat"-ing.

o Added Lcat Pull

o Added Lpos Freq	- Force position of the filerequester.

o Added Lcust Freq	- Customize size of device-field, filename-
			  field and number of files displayed.

o Added Lfontsize Freq	- Used when the filerequster is in font-mode.

o Added Lback Hunt	- Backwards hunting in buffers. Very useful in
			  page/line-oriented applications.

o Added Ldev First	- Listing and separating of 'hard' devices, disks
  and   Ldev Next	  assignments and volumes.

o AMOS (and Ldos) now boots correctly even if some libraries can't be
  opened.

o Added Lwords		- Used to count words in strings. Handles multiple
                          spaces, commas, tabs and doublequotes. Mainly
                          used in conjunction with Lword.

o Added Lword		- A command being able to mask out any word from a
                          string (without modifying it). Very much similiar
                          to the ARexx-command 'WORD'.


Changes from version 2 to version 2.1 (just released V2 :-( )
-------------------------------------------------------------

o Lfile Type no longer crashes when dir/filename doesn't exist.

o Added Lwild which can find out if a string contains a valid AmigaDOS
  wildcard so that Lmatch won't produce an error (overflow) if it is
  called with a non-wildcard string.

o Added Lset File Date which allows you to change date and time-stamps on
  files and directorys. KS2 only.

Changes from version 2.1 to 2.5
-------------------------------

		THANK YOU ALL WHO HAS REPORTED BUGS!
		------------------------------------
                Thank you for registering. It wasn't to many
                but it is nice to know that Ldos/Lser helped
                some of you. Also nice to receive letters and
                discuss AMOS among other things.

There is a big bump in the version number but since so many lethal
bugs have been fixed I thought it was best to use a high version number
(more people wil bother to download it and this will result in more
stable programs)

o This is probably the final and last release of Ldos. It seems to
  be pretty stable now. Most commands will trap user-erros, some
  won't. You still have to be a bit careful with some commands
  (for instance make sure there's enough room in banks etc.) but
  generally Ldos seems to be quite safe now.

o Never say never. There is a possibilty that there will be further
  bugfixes :-)

o Updated manual a bit. The important/new things are marked (see doc)
  but there might be some new hints for some of you, not marked.

o V2.1 was a rush-release. I had just started to fix some bugs when you
  guys started to register :-) Thought it would be best to ship you
  the latest release, and thus had to change the revision number in order
  to avoid confusion.

o Added some new examples. LineInput might be useful for all you lazy
  ones ;-)) It is hard to find both meaningful and useful programs to
  write..

o Lfreq can now be called like A$=Lfreq("",FLAGS) without crashing. Thanks
  to Alexander Folkesson in Sweden.

o Alexander Folkesson noted (just like me..) that when you changed Dir$
  Lopen etc. still worked in the directory that was AMOS start-dir. LLdir$
  was thus implemented. See docs for additional information.

o Fixed the command ESC[y;xf in Lansi. I KNOW I've fixed this before, but
  somehow there must have been a mix-up with some older routine several
  versions ago :-( Most fullscreen- readers/editors frequently use this
  command to locate the cursor. Thanks to Joao Carvalho in Portugal and
  Alexander Folkesson.

o Fixed the command ESC[y;xH in Lansi to properly locate cursor at 0 if
  requested. It used to stop at position 1 before. This of course also
  applies to ESC[y;xf.

o Added check that makes sure that all strings that Lrexx* need are NULL-
  terminated, otherwise an errormessage is produced.

o ... (didn't catch his name) reported that Ldisk Font had caused his
  computer to crash. After a closer look, check for fontname of length
  zero was added. Also found out that you need V36+ of diskfont.library
  in order to specify a separate path for the font you wish to load.
  (yet another reason to rush out an by your AmigaDOS upgrade)
  It is still valid to call with a requested fontsize of zero, if anybody
  wants to do that :)

o Fixed a bug in Lseek, which sometimes caused Lseek to only return the
  current position, instead of moving. This only happened on files >64Kb,
  and just in some cases.

o Lmatch now generates an error if your strings isn't NULL-terminated
  (STRING$=STRING$+Chr$(0)) If they aren't 0-terminated this can cause
  stack overflow, or a valid wildcard to be regarded as non-valid.

o Added short (but full) on-line help. See Help.DOC for more information.

o Fixed a bug in Lstamp which would subtract one day from the date if
  the current year was a leap-year (all other leap-years was OK).
  All date routines should work OK now. (Up to year 2099 at least)

o Now shipped with a new version of rexxhost.library. Throw loadlib into
  Trashcan!

o If rexxhost.library failed to open (due to missing or user hasn't got
  the whole ARexx-package (libs and server)) an error is generated when
  Lrexx Make Host is called. None of the other functions will warn you since
  any program that is Rexx-compatible always would set up a port first.
  If you call other functions before Make Host and rexxhost has failed on
  startup your computer will most likely crash!
  Thanks to Micke Palm in Sweden.

o MAJOR BUG! Micke Palm reported that Ldos crashed when he exited to the
  system. Somehow I forgot to remove the code which opened locale.lib
  (not used in Ldos) and when all the libraries where to be closed, locale
  would _only_ be closed if it wasn't open (!). This was safe under V36+
  but not on lower versions of the KS. All locale code now removed.
  (I tend to forget to check the easy things, sorry.)

o rexxhost.library is now closed when AMOS/compiled program is quit and can
  thus be expunged later on (it is so small though). Thanks to Micke Palm 
  again who made me check startup/quit code (wihtout knowing about it :-).

o MAJOR BUG! Due to fault in my own includes files left open (Lopen) would
  not be closed on exit. Last lock() (Lcat*) would not be de-allocated.
  Now fixed.

o Lword now handles words of length 1. Used to add garbage if last word
  was only one char long, or hang if first word was one char long.

o Lbstr sped up by as much as 50% on large strings. Thanks to Manuel Andre
  in Belgium.
