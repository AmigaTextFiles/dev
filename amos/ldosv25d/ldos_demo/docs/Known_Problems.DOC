Known problems and other strange things:
-----------------------------------------

You can't specify a path to Ldisk Font unless you have diskfont.library
V36+. Yeat another reason for upgrading :-) You could solve the problem
by using Lexecute to re-assign fonts: to the place where your own fonts
are, use Ldisk Font and restore fonts: to SYS:fonts/ with assign. I have
not tested this, but it ought to work.

---

Somebody reported that Ldisk Font crashed.
It can NOT crash due to failure to open diskfont.library since Ldos detects
this and produces an errormessage: 11: Unable to open diskfont.library
(The bug with fontnames of 0 characters have been fixed. (Somebody
always find these holes :-))

However, AMOS might crash if it can't open diskfont.library. (At
least older versions could).

---

Even though AMOS tends to open something which looks like an intuition-screen
(and uses a window for all AMOS-screens) it isn't possible to pop up the req.
library file requester on an AMOS-screen. AMOS's screen _really_ looks weird
to me..

---

If AMOS seems to lock or get heavily busy and slow, make sure that your
not running any screenblankers on the WB! ASwarmIII for example completely
locks AMOS (especially Lserial-routines) until left AMIGA-A is pressed.
