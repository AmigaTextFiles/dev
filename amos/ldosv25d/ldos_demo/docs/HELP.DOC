To use the quick-ref:

Installing:
Copy Help.ACC to the same path as AMOS is located in. If you wish you
may change name/location in your configuration-program. Please note
that if you specifically haven't configured the HELP-key HELP.ACC MUST
be located in your (and AMOS's) current dir when you press the HELP-key
the first time. (You could also select Acc/New/Load). Once HELP.ACC is
loaded it will remain in memory until you quit AMOS.


Index:
Press HELP while cursor is located at none Ldos-/Lserialcommand or on an empty
line.

Short ref.:
Type the command. WITHOUT any parameters. Put cursor at the start of the
word(s). Press HELP.

Expanding:
If you like (and have the patience) you may add the rest of AMOS's commands
to the references. Look in the HELP.ACC program and you will see how to
do it. Just add a label which starts with "_" and then the full name of
the instruction, without any spaces. If there is a "$" (like Inkey$) in
the command name, simply remove it (labels can't end with $). The last
data-line must be "-1".

Example of new entry:
_LOWER:
data "S$=Lower$(N$)"
data "-1"
_SORT:
data "Sort A(0)"
data "Sort A#(0)"
data "Sort A$(0)"
data "-1"

etc. etc.

Example:

HELP (index pops up)
Lload

|_ Cursor located here, press HELP, and info pops up.
