I was seriously thinking about going, and taking some F1 stuff with me, but
turns out I cant make it  =/

Somehow, I dont think Pietro will be able to put in an appearance from
Italy, hehe  ;)

Once again hears my Amos wish list.

#1 bobs & sprites that can be rotated and scaled like Apple soft vector
graphics.

#2 3D bobs like that mushy raycasting thing.

#3 to be able to load a IFF as a background, or FOREGROUND.

#4 collision detection between 2D, and 3D obj's.

#5 easy JoyPad combination reading like 
             IF JPADUP(1) AND JPADRR(1) AND JPADR(1) THEN 2000
JPAD  UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT, FF, RR, P, R, B, G, Y.

#6 multi-mouse support, so can read the mouse in both ports.

#7 translucent screens, so I can open 3 256 Hi Res screen, so I can draw
background on 1, midground on 2, and foreground on 3. (mem should be the
only limit)

#8 milti screen collision detection system for #7.

#9 new 3D modeler with point & click coloring (select color from pallet then
click on face,face changes to that color), surface detailing on the faces not
on a grid, surface detailing tools (line,dot,square,circle.), shape modiling
on the shape (pulling she 3D obj to form it), bent face modeling, in side
out function (for working on the inside of the obj), real color shape system
, assign number or colors command( 2,256 ), assign color block command(if a
obj has 4 colors you can get that block of 4 colors from 0 to 253), get
pallet command(load pallet from IFF).

#10 3D map maker

#11 2D map maker

#12 move map commands up, down, right, left, and rotate & scale.

#13 3D obj texture bit maping.

#14 light sourcing command.

#15 time & date read commands  IF TIME > 12:44:52pm THEN 2000

#16 variable bank save & load commands (save all variables from a program to
a .bak file, or gust some of them)

#17 multi-tasking loop commands. (exe lope with > priority if any free CPU
cycles open up they go to the next loop < priority, and, so on)

#18 point&click zone maker.

#19 new easier 2D editor (scalable image widow with vertical,and horizontal
sliders, cut and past widow (load IFF's in to it), and drag, and drop for
completed bobs, and sprites.)

#20 new 3D drawing commands (draw,box,polygon,etc...)

#21 Icon tool type read/wright commands.

#22 read/data .bak file system

#23 run asynchronously command

#24 ascii read command.

#25 color font text editor with file read command

#26 make the Amos custom screens mode promotable. (like with NewMode)

#27 built in environmental variable support.

#28 complete on line manual with Quick Basic type command index.

#29 new Amos editor like the Pro one, but the edit screen area, and the
direct mode screen area will work like a normal amiga widow so you can lift
up the bottom of the edit screen, and keep both the edit & direct mode screen
up, so you can check something in direct mode, and then type it in the edit
mode widow, and I like the bigger sliding bars of Amiga DOS widows, and the
horizontal bar, and the REPEAT key click arrows.

Well thats all I can think of for now.

I take it you are referring to my Texture mapping demo's i did not long ago
(the ones with pics of Queen and T2). Those were true Tmapping, using
internal maths, to lookup tables and the ZOOM command (pretty quick even for
zoom). I can send the source of them if ya want them, tho theres nothing to
rip.

I know I've comented on this before, I agree it would be nice to run the
editor
itselve in a true intuition system. As for the program we write I think an
excelent way of doing Intuition is the OS DevKit or the upcomming GUI
extension,
why not simply consider the new GUI extension as 'standard' it's even written
by the same guy :) (I don't know how much the editor/finished programs is
linked together with screens, so it might be both or none for intuition..)

100 % Agree, AGA is given with intuition support, RTG should be placed as a
couple of extra commands opening for work on 2.04 (No RTG in that)..

Priority no. 1, this is the MOST importaint thing to do at first..

When moving to intuition-screens (2.0+) you get a very good and free gift from
the GAD-TOOLS library, the central aspects of GUI extension relies on this :)
But for people (like me) doing step-by-step convertions of programs to run
on intuition it would be nice to keep the interface, I just don't see any
reason
for using time to debug that part, as I'm actualy using some bugs in those
commands to make interfaces in an easier way :)) Removing commands would
proberly
interfer with the 'token-list' of the main library, so I don't think it would
be wise to begin to do this..

 
> 5.  Standard intution compatiable menus and file-requesters, I know I
> mentioned them before, but these are important.
> 

GADtools.library and ASL delivers those on OS2.04+, and should be very easy
to implement (Runs great from GUI, OS DevKit and Intuition extensions :))


> 6.  Optimized compiling
>    The compiler needs omptimizing but I'm sure everyone will agree with
this.
>    Perhaps processor specific code?
> 

YEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ, THATZ right, and making smaller code-output would be very
nice
too, a switch to 2.0+ intuition-screens should reduce the size of compiled
code 
by huge amount, as all the screen-control could be handled by the standard
libraries (intuition.library, graphics.library, exec.library..)...


> 7. AmigaDos 2.0+ or even 3.0+ 
>   I know there has been debate about this lately, but if your still using
> 1.3, then stick with amosPro2.0, or upgrade your ROM

Uhh, 3.0 is proberly to ambitious, there are many people having an 'old'
amiga next to their PeeCee, and it would be stupid to push them away, that's
also why I still think it should be posible to make programs that can run
on 1.3, but I guess I'm outnumbered there... :( Besides the basics of
2.0 and 3.0 is very much the same, the major inovations with 3.0 was
the datatypes and RTG. And it should be easy to avoid 3.0 specific
functions in the basics..

Here's a couple of my own wishes:

gadtools.library support direct from commands, sort of like the OSDevKit,
where gadgets can be defined like:
 _gt Button NR,X,Y,W,H,FLAGS,TEXT$
for a simple button, makes it easier to create your interface while
working out the basics..

locale.library support (No further explination needed :)
fileid.library support :)

The last two could be included in, say, the IO-Devices extension or
another standard extension :)
(The locale extension for locale.library works just great, but it's a
bit stupid to use an entire extension-slot for so little commands)

I'll be putting bob rotation and scaling functions in to TGE,
but it probably won't be in v1.0, I think I'll have the functions 
in the version after v1.0.

Im hoping to get TGE out within 3 months, so there will most
likely be a version which will support rotating (X/Y/Z) and scaling
sometime this summer. I'll let you know when the version is released.


thanks for the idea 8)

Ha!!

So is there anything you actually want to write yourself?

How about a command MAKE GAME <expr> where you just type in a
description of the game (in any language) and it is automatically
made?

Oh and surely he doesn't actually have the 3D extension source code as
it was made independantly in which case half of these commands
couldn't be done anyway.

I'm a designer not a coder I want a high level language that has the 
commands, and tools necessary to let someone like me make 2D, and 3D games
with a minimum of muss, and fuss. If I wanted to figure out every thing that
needs to be done to make games work for my self I would have chosen ASM, or
C.

Thats a stupid idea, but typical of a coders mentality. You coders have all
the creativity of a rock which is why most games suck. If some one gives us
designers a language that we can really use than you will see what games are
suppose to be like. As an example if a designer made that question it would
look more like this.

How about making Amos artificially intelligent, and give it a voice recognition
system, so you can explain your ideas to it, and it will create the code?

Well then maybe he will get the code, or better yet make a new Amos 3D as
Amos 3D sucks, and only a masochist would love it.

No thanks I probably wouldn't understand it thats why I want 3D bobs.

Sheesh, did anyone actually get 2.0 or 2.1 ????  Personally, I went from 1.3
straight to 3.0 with no stop inbetween, and the upgrade is incredibly easy.

AmosPro is still THE best way of doing stuff on old amigas, but seriously, hands
up those who are using 1.3, 2.0, or 2.1.  I have dusty old machines with old 1.3
chips in them, but I took out their 3.0 chip so they would be "standard" and I
could use the newer machines for newer things.

With newer programs, we need to be able to compete on a similar level to that of
say, the peecee, which these days has a very fast processor, much quicker than
the "standard" 68020, or an upgraded amiga, more memory than the amiga, and
hard disk and graphics card.  Ok, we on the amiga as standard have some memory, 
but not enough, a dinky little floppy drive, and a graphics chipset that will give
older graphics cards a run for their money, but at a much slower speed.  How many
peecee guys even THINK about supporting anything as old as a 486 these days ?  Not
many.  How old is a 486 in comparison to a 1200 for example ?  Yeah, ok, here we
go.

Why do I want a new amos ?  What do I look for in a language ?  I want something
thats gonna run on as many machines as possible, ie amos.  Something with a good
interface.  Amos.  Something that is fast and powerfull.  Ok, amos, but getting
iffy by modern standards.  Look at blitz.  Quick but unstable as hell.  Lousy
interface.  Does it support 1.3 ?  Barely.  Should amos ?

What kind of amiga should we all be using ?  Hands up those who USE their
unexpanded A500 with old chipset anymore.  Hands up those who know someone.
Right, thats not many.  Now, who wants a new version of an old classic, updated to
cope with new chipsets, new graphics cards, and (hopefully) faster processors ?
If some of the code can be updated for 68020 minimum later down the line, should
we REALLY care that the 16bit machines can't run it ?

Yeah, comes down to money again.  You get what you pay for.  If you don't pay for it,
you don't get it.

Much as I hate it, I end up spending money on my peecee nearly every damn 
month for upgrades.  It's driving me nuts.  I spent twice as much money on
 my new amiga a few months back, and can buy little else for it.  It's already
"expanded".

Do you WANT software that holds back the machine, or pushes it to its limits ??
Do you REALLY think YOU will write software for the A500 in 1998 ??
Do you want to be able to access "new" hardware like AGA and gfx cards in amos ??
If you were writing something, WHICH WOULD YOU CHOOSE ??

It comes down to choice.  AmosPro ALREADY exists in a damn good form, with loads of
extensions that can handle 1.3 through 3.0 well.  It can't handle 3.1 properly.
WB3.5 and 4.0 are ON THEIR WAY, slowly but surely.  What the hell do you think
will happen with old machines then ??

I agree it isn't a good idea to push older users away, but how are you gonna keep
an amiga A500 user happy, with a programming language ??  Yeah, right.  He sees what
the peecee is doing, and thinks, thats a bit better than mine.  He doesn't upgrade.
He compares the latest peecee technology with an unexpanded amiga.  Pointless.

Take the guy who expanded his amiga, with memory, hard drive, and preferably a
faster processor, graphics card, monitor, included as standard these days on
peecees.  He knows the difference between the machines, and knows that one 
thing remains true, on both platforms.

	EXPAND OR DIE.

If you don't expand it, your machine WILL die.  Software needs to cope.  Should it
support old machines ?  Preferably.  In the long run ?  Time=money.  Ghizzo has
the source for amos, and has already produced some good stuff for amos, and is
having fun trying to decode someone elses bad days.  Should he:
	a:	Get it working as fast as possible to get people using amos
		and their amiga again, by using new features and facilities
		built into the operating system ?
	b:	Spend ages duplicating the work already done on the newer
		operating system to complete a similar working interface that
		doesn't quite work the same as the new workbench that runs on
		all machines, that takes about a hundred times longer to
		write and debug that means we all end up screaming for a new
		version while we might as well just keep using what we're
		using, and use blitz when we need aga or something.  If we're
		that desperate for old system compatability, use the amos
		interface commands.  THEY WORK.

It's the MUI argument all over again.  Should we use mui, which is "slow" and
memory hogging, or should we spend ages duplicating it under OS calls and the
like.  Answer: Depends how much memory you have, and how fast your processor is.
One MUI task hogs memory, yeah, sure.  Two or three, and it gets efficiant.
Slow ?  What the hell processor are you using ?  Why are you still using it ??
Upgrade dammit.

Why am I still on an amiga, and still using amos ?  Because of the interface
superiority.  What can we expect of amos3 ?  Complete multitasking.  Faster
graphics access using AGA and graphics card modes.  A few less bugs.  A few
more commands.

The MINIMUM amiga that I personally will support has AGA graphics, 2megs chipmem,
a hard drive, preferably a CD drive, and at LEAST 4 megs of fast memory, but use
8 just to be on the safe side so you can load something else at the same time.  
A 68020 or better is REQUIRED, and anything slower is UNUSABLE by todays standards.
68020 is TOO SLOW these days as well, but at least it will run on it.  Since no
machine with AGA is using less than 3.0, that is a good minimum too.  Personally,
as soon as I get my hands on the new workbench 3.5, or 4.0 or whatever it ends up
being, it will be softkicked immediately, and the chips levered into place as soon
as possible.  Even if you have an A500, a new 3.1 OS is EASY to get.
  
	UPGRADE OR DIE.

You have to.  You know it makes sense.  If you DON'T want to upgrade your amiga,
to a sensible level, then why the hell are you still using it ?  THINK about it.

>  Shift to the left!  Shift to the right!  Pop up, push down, byte, byte, byte!

!

Sorry to all I just offended in the previous section, I'm not normally that 
agressive, I just want the amiga to be able to compete on a sensible level
with other platforms, and the only way to do that, is to compare similarly
spec'd machines.  Hands up who supports windows version 1.0.  Hands up who
has seen it.  W2.0 ?  Didn't think so.  W3.1 ?  Ah, one or two hands.  W95 ?
Oh look.  There they all are.  W98 ?  One or two..

Sorry, but the new amos, and new amiga software NEEDS to take advantage of
anything the developers can get their hands on, otherwise they might as well
just stick with an A500 while the rest of the world moves on.

I can see a software title in the not too distant future requiring a multi-
processor machine, with 68060 for workbench compatability, PPC processing, and
retargeted graphics, maybe siamesed with a Pentium3.  Scary huh.

3.x is more reliant on FAST RAM than 2.x is. You will probably notice a gain
in CHIP RAM free.

Not if you have at least 1 meg of each now. But the 3.x ROM is very flaky when
it comes to A500s. I had to softkick it, because the ROM would not work in my
500.
  
>     Also does 3.x require an 030+ processor?

No. It would help, but 3.1 will run on a stock 68000 processor.

     Does 3.x require any more memory to run than 2.x  If I was to upgrade 
     from 2.04 to 3.x my worry is that I also have to buy extra memory.  
     Also does 3.x require an 030+ processor?

OK this is only my opinion but I think it's high time for Amiga developers 
in general to push 3.0 as the STANDARD for development.  I realize all the 
1.3 and 2.04 users out there but we can't expect much further development 
(3.5 or 4.0) until more people are using 3.0.  3.0 is much better in my 
opinion also and it doesn't cost very much to  upgrade.  So I think the 
decision to not support 1.3 is a wise one.   These days I think and 030 and 
WB 3.0 should be the minimum standard for Amiga development but you guys 
may disagree.  Just a thought.

Hi!

Ok.. after the words the facts... the beta version of the .fd files support
kit is ready for download. I've sent it today to Mush, and so soon or later
it should be available somewhere on his homepage.

Aahh... now the Mushroom PD is the new official AMOS PD Library :) Have a
look... at least now we have again a official and working library. Come on,
submit your material, comments and ideas.

And now a important request:


                           *GFX guys i need you!!*


Take the oppurtunity to design the new AMOS logo! It must be cool, modern,
and not a fake 'AMOS' like the original. Send me your creations, and
between 15 days there will be a public votation for select the new logo :) 

Ok, that's all...

You mean SMB, not NetBEUI (spit!).  We already have Samba, which is
pretty good but doesn't yet have an Amiga file-system built on it.

Well I both deisng my games and code them. Knowing what you can and
can't code means I'll never do what you just did and ask for a whole
load of unrealistic commands.

Also I think you misunderstood me. My comment about MAKE GAME was a
joke brought on by you asking for commands that would virtually
create half a game instantly (and is therefore stupid).

Well, it would be available for download, only he forgot to attach the mail

It will be there as soon as he gets his mail in the morning and sends it to

TCP/IP isn't really a file-oriented protocol, actually. It's
Packet-oriented. That's why you have to run services like FTP,
Telnet and NFS over the top of it to get any useful human-level
transmission happening. TCP/IP is a transport. 

That's what makes it perfect for AMOS... if we can get hooks into
it at the socket level, we can establish real-time network
communications between different machines. 
 
The TCP: device which Branko was talking about, is something with
which I am completely unfamiliar. Maybe it's some kind of handler
which sets up a virtual drive over a TCP/IP link.. I dunno. Sounds
really useful, but it still won't allow AMOS to transmit
commands and data using sockets.

Ciao for now.

Hmm, I womdered why the GUI Guide didnt get updated too much, hehe  ;)

Well, if my wife goes to montreal next month for work (she will be
integrating some logistics stuff) then I'll be going with her, so I can
train (or do you americans/canadans call it "subway-ing") it down to where
you are.

Depends on what goes on tho, if they want me to do some net stuff for them,
then I guess I might not be able to make it  =/

Why  don't you STOP coding then? Design away until your hearts content
and  let  the  programmers  do  the  hard  work. If you're such a good
designer, why haven't you designed the best selling game yet?

I  guess  you  want  the  best of both worlds. Design and code? But it
seems  to me like you can't do either by what I've read in your email!
Forgive  me  if  I'm  wrong, but you certainly don't seem to belong on
this  list!  This  list is for Amos coders, not some self hyped up guy
who thinks he is the bee's knees at designing!


>How about making Amos artificially intelligent, and give it a voice

>system, so you can explain your ideas to it, and it will create the code?

You  don't want much do you? I bet you even want a remote control that
can  open  and  shut  the  curtains  for  you? In fact, I bet you even
designed a system that does that already :)

Eric, do us a BIG favour, send in your design ideas and we'll tell you
if  it's feasible or not. Only the coders can REALLY tell you if it is
possible or not.

Work with programmers, not against. We all have to work together these
days.  No point in holding all the fame to yourself. So c'mon, what is
the next big game you are designing?

Tarra....

Your source code/compiled programs can be emailed directly to me at
mushypd@redrose.net (in a packed form, such as Lha or LZX) with a small
.Readme file attatched. If you have access to an FTP client, then upload
them to mushy-pd.dyn.ml.org (logging in as anonymous) and placing them in
/pub/amos/incoming/

A new (and large!) MPD Report will be released in less than a week's time.

I meant a user sending files or other data (either in real-time or
not) over the network. Example - FTP'ing a file. Example - flying 
his jet fighter simulator over the network.

As for relevancy, well, that's for the individual to decide.

I would assume that if AMOS had socket support, you would still
be able to access the TCP: device exactly like you can now?

There's no-one forcing you to use sockets if you really hate them
and especially if you don't have a practical application for them.

I have, but being a good designer, and only a mediocre coder I can't tackle
the tough stuff needed to make the game.

Your forgiven for being wrong. If you had read my original E-Mail on this
sub. then you might have figured out that what I am after are some new tools
,and commands that will make it easier to make 3D games, just as Amos has 
tools, and commands to make 2D games. To sort of quote some thing I read 
"The hardest thing about making new RPG's these days is you first have to 
reinvent Quake". It is my hope that a new Amos will come with a easy to use
prefabricated 3D engine, so the mediocre coders like my self don't have to
try to reinvent Quake gust to make a new game.

And this list is for any one who uses Amos, or is trying to use Amos, not
just four you hot dog coder types.

I gather that you don't understand that, that was an example of the 
differences between coder thinking "type in description" which is like
coding, and designer thinking talk with Amos which is like working with 
another person. I don't expect Amos3 to work like that, but I can envision
a future software development system working like that.

I not an idiot I know that the present Amiga can't handle my full game
design, but it can handle the little 15mb one.

Its called Privateer Elite If you think you can handle it send me a 360 3D
single fixed point 4 color (white,light gray,dark gray,and a few MWB peach)
star field with smoke gray stellar gas clouds (like the blue ones in 
frontier)on a black background in a Star Trek 25 sized bridge screen capable
of forward, and reverse views, and to show movement I need frontier type
space dust, but not as many particles. This needs to be controlled by a CD32 
JoyPad Up pitch down, Down pitch up, right yaw 360+, left yaw 360-, FF roll
360+, RR roll 360-, Y accelerate, B decelerate, G+Up forward view, G+down
reverse view.    
 
> Tarra....

If you didn't guess this is for a Frontier Elite type game want to make it
a list game?

How about give AMOS 3 support for datatypes? If AGA why not DTs
Since new datatypes are developed all the time it would be easy
add/update
support for picture/sound loading.

 Just a personal opinion on this , don't take it personally (James)
 If possible , extend the language to be a full new generation 
machine compatible-only and for it.
 Would piss us off and force us to choose a new amiga 
 But if that is what we wanna see , it would help on the amiga 
comeback and help software development on the new plataform.

 See ya!

I've noticed a new 3d library on Aminet. Anyone feel up to looking it over and
setting up some amos procs to take advantage of it? Maybe someone could use it
as the core of the much-touted possible 3d graphics extension for AMOS?

These are complicated commands and whereas these ARE possible, you
would moan that they were too slow because they would have to have all

Light Sourcing command???? Come on.... realise something, to code on
an amiga you have to be tight and controlled with your code. If AMOS
provided all these commands (which is not going to happen) then
because they would be general rather than game specific (like coders
actually have to code to be as optimal as possible) they would be FAR
TOO SLOW and a complete nightmare for whichever fool tried to create
the commands.

I think theres something you need to know.

AMOS is a PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.... FOR CODERS!!!!
It is not a games designing system. Go and make something with SEUCK.
I'm sure you'll have NO complaints whatsoever about that.
  
> Your the one how misunderstood.  I knew you were joking.

I'm sorry, I found your English a little confusing in places.

I noticed one of them too. It has an .FD file (I downloaded ALL of util/libs
EEK) so can be used. I'll maybe have a quick go at it later, but maybe Andy
Hawkins or someone who uses the 3D extension, might be better at doing this.

Why reinvent Quake? If you're so good, invent something new!!!!
And like your going to get a Quake game running on AMOS..... come on,
get a grip.

I was going to respond to that but I'm sure EVERYONE knows that you

As I've said before. If you want to do complicated 3D stuff then AMOS
isn't for you (well at least until AMOS gets updated alot and the
amiga gets more powerful)

You CAN make nice 3D games but you need a bit of skill and to know
what you can and can't do with it, its not easy.

Subject: MPD Announcement: AMOSPro FD Extension Released - Most powerful yet!!
Status: O
X-Status: 

AMOSPro Extension Release - FD Extension V1.0
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Ever wanted your AMOSPro programs to have more power, by using things like
MPEG video, datatypes, AHI, multi-langual translation, or lots more? Now
this is possible through the new FD Developers kit, which enables you to
convert regular AmigaDOS libraries directly into usable extensions.

AMOSPro FD Extension is a powerfull new extension just released for
AMOSPro. It allows you to convert the .FD and includes from almost any
AmigaDOS library, and transform it into an extension ready for immediate
use! This powerful tool has been written by Pietro Ghizzoni, author of the
excellent GUI extension.

The extension will allow you to use any number of FD files, and will
compile them all into the 1 extension, so that you dont have to worry about
many different files lying around the place. Once compiled, the extension
made goes into slot 25 of your configuration.

The extension is available for download from my homepages at
http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/fd.html along with a selection of libraries
for immediate use. The list of libraries I have found at the moment are
listed at the end of this mail. If you would like the extension emailed to
you instead, simply contact me at mushypd@redrose.net and I will send you
the file.

Known Libraries
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The following is a list of libraries that contain FD files. I havent tried
to use any of these libraries yet, so if anyone experiences problems, they
should contact me, telling me which library they were using, and the
problems they encountered. On the FD extension page, these libraries have
links so you can download them directly from Aminet. You can also read the
information .readme file on each archive to check if it is the one you want.

If you have any FD libraries (with documentation) that dont appear hear,
then archive the whole library, sources, docs, and other pieces and email
it to me. All of these files will also be on the Mushroom PD FTP site in
the next day or 2.

Subject: Gui 1.70 FAQ + Tutorial ideas wanted!
MIME-Version: 1.0

X-Status: 

Does anyone have any ideas for tutorials in the new GUI Extension releases?
I can cover the basic stuff, such as gadget types etc. which will be in
there as standard, as well as the problem of opening on graphics cards etc.
What I need, is some really good ideas to work along with.

I also want to know what kind of questions you have for the FAQ section, as
I only have the basics there. Think of anything good, because believe me,
the OS devkit looks pants compare to Gui V1.70!!

Pietro, just 2 simple questions:

1) How do I change the name of my Pubscreen to what I want it
2) Is there a simple way to change the text of a button?

Oh well, see ya soon!

Subject: New Compiler ideas wanted
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: O
X-Status: 

As some of you know, ive been working on the new GUI Compiler (which will
also work with the regular compiler, as it will run on GFX cards too) and
wanted to hear everybody's ideas for what to include.

Ive put the complete basics in, as with the V1.62 gui compiler, and also
added error messages (missing from V1.62). Ive also give it the option to
open on a Pubscreen of your choice, and it has an interface which has some
MWB pics on it over top of buttons.

All feedback is appreciated, as I want to make this program so that
everyone can use it. Oh, and it runs at the same time as AMOSPro, so you
can compile whilst on the fly!

To take up a minute of your time:

For those who care [everyone needs to know these things] :) I'm off to
Dallas (Texas) for the next couple of days (for a few, actually: till
Sunday) to check up on a job opportunity and look around the town and
such (for a possible move). If you mail me, just wait for a response (hehe,
I'll reply to it after I read through all the mail that's piled up here)!

Also: I haven't read much of my mail for the past couple of days (haven't
had time really). Most of it has been the talk on the the AMOS updates and
unceasing "upgrade" war. Anyhow, I'll be reading it all when I get back.

Now you're informed. Thanks for reading. We now end this breif message. :D

This should have been done when Amos 3D came out.

   For the sake of simplicity, the code below assumes you're useing a
   two-dimensional array to store your map.  Obviously, a one-
   dimensional array or particularly a binary array would be more
   effiecient, but you can apply the design to whatever method you're
   actually using...

   Okay, the idea is simple enough.  To rotate your map counter clock
   wise, you need to transfer the map rows (top to bottom) to the map
   cols (left to right)...
   ABCDE                       EJOTY
   FGHIJ                        DINSX
   KLMNO                      CHMRW
   PQRST                      BGLQV
   UVWXY                     AFKPU

   And for clockwise rotation, you simply transfer the map rows (top to
   bottom) to the map cols (right to left)...
   ABCDE                      UPKFA
   FGHIJ                       VQLGB
   KLMNO                     WRMHC
   PQRST                      XSNID
   UVWXY                     YTOJE

   Of course, that is simply the way I am viewing it, you could look 
   at the process in a number of ways, but moving on to the code...:)

   BTW- I'm on my PC and just did a quick test in C (these routines\
             work fine), so if I make some syntax errors in the AMOS
             version (created on the fly below), you'll know why...

  I'm going to use a 5x5 matrix for this example, as my creation code
  fills a 5x5 MAP with the characters in the above examples...
  just change the MAPWIDTH and MAPHEIGHT values to 50.

  --------<CODE STARTS HERE>--------  
  Dim MAP(50,100) : Rem Double-height BUFFERED map...
  Shared MAP(), MAPBASE, MAPWIDTH, MAPHEIGHT

  Procedure ROTATEMAPLEFT
    DESTBASE=MAPHEIGHT-MAPBASE
    DESTCOL=0
    For REP=0 To MAPHEIGHT-1
      SOURCEROW=MAPBASE+REP
      DESTROW=DESTBASE+(MAPHEIGHT-1)
      For SOURCECOL=0 To MAPWIDTH-1
        MAP(DESTCOL,DESTROW)=MAP(SOURCECOL,SOURCEROW)
        Dec DESTROW
      Next SOURCECOL
      Inc DESTCOL
    Next REP
    MAPBASE=DESTBASE  
  End Proc

 Procedure ROTATEMAPRIGHT
    DESTBASE=MAPHEIGHT-MAPBASE
    DESTCOL=MAPWIDTH-1
    For REP=0 To MAPHEIGHT-1
      SOURCEROW=MAPBASE+REP
      DESTROW=DESTBASE
      For SOURCECOL=0 To MAPWIDTH-1
        MAP(DESTCOL,DESTROW)=MAP(SOURCECOL,SOURCEROW)
        Inc DESTROW
      Next SOURCECOL
      Dec DESTCOL
    Next REP
    MAPBASE=DESTBASE  
  End Proc

  Procedure MAPVIEW
    For YPOS=0 To MAPHEIGHT-1
      Print "          ";
      For XPOS=0 To MAPWIDTH-1
        Print Chr$(MAP(XPOS,MAPBASE+YPOS));
      Next XPOS
      Print
    Next YPOS
  End Proc 

  ' ----------------------------
  ' MAIN CODE HERE
  '-----------------------------
  MAPBASE=0 : Rem Toggled between 0 and 5 for buffering
  MAPWIDTH=5 : MAPHEIGHT=5

  Print "Initializing Map..." : PRINT
  TILE=Asc("A")
  For YPOS=0 To MAPHEIGHT-1
    For XPOS=0 To MAPWIDTH-1
      MAP(XPOS,MAPBASE+YPOS)=TILE 
      Add TILE,1,Asc("A") To Asc("Z")
    Next XPOS
  Next YPOS

  Print "Map defined as follows:"
  MAPVIEW

  Print "Original Map rotated CounterClockWise:"
  ROTATEMAPLEFT
  MAPVIEW

  Print "Original Map rotated ClockWise:"
  ROTATEMAPRIGHT : ROTATEMAPRIGHT
  MAPVIEW

  Wait Key
  End
  --------<CODE ENDS HERE>--------
  
  Everytime you call these rotation functions, the MAPBASE is 
  changed, so you'll need to use MAPBASE+ROW to access your map.
  I used a buffered design as this is faster than having to copy your
  MAP into a temporary workbuffer then rotate "back" to the MAP
  array...

  Anyway, hope this helps... :-)

Better late than ever, ey :)

Ok, let's start with the basics, the AMIGA uses a set of standard libraries to
do almost anything, the advantage is that with new models (like AGA) you just
get a new library. Unfortunaly some programers write their own commands to
take
care of eg. GFX and disc-operations and that's one of the main reasons for
some older games not working on AGA/KS2.0+..

Normaly AMOS handles the access to libraries without you noticing, it's caling
the 'exec.library' when you need memory (Banks), it calls 'dos.library' to
handle
disc and devices. (Funny note: when you're accessing a library with 'open
library'
on AMOS, you actualy call a function in 'exec.library').. 

The number of libraries is increasing rapidly, some are more usefull that
others, 
but they all serve a purpose. As AMOS is not updated (until now) then there
are 
many interesting calls that are not included. One of the most importaint is
the
'locale.library', two AMOS-extensions opens up for that, but as standard AMOS
can't
handle it. Anyway what the new extension does is giving you easy access to
some
of those great supporting libraries (just look in 'libs:' on your HD, you
should
have at least 30 there if you're using the amiga for anything other than
games..)

You can ofcourse always begin a big dissucion on what libraries should be
included
for use (I'd like to see more of the 'standard' libraries there, but that's
just
a personal note..).. If you're making games, there's proberly not much to find
in
the list that we've seen, but for utilities there's endless possibilities. A
neat
feature is access to the high-accurate calc-libs and detection of expansion
boards
on the system.. I think the same about libs as I think about AMOS-extensions,
it
all comes down to what you're making with AMOS.. There's a few usefull
extensions
and libraries for games, countless for utilities...

And, just a thought, why not write games supporting 'locale.library' so anyone
can make a version in another language ???..


Ok, enough blah... FD-files..
This is a set of files mainly used by C-programers, they could also come of
use
for AMIGA-Basic and Blitz users. They are basicaly just a list of the
functions
for the libraries, they define what parameters are needed, and in which 
registers the information is passed. For C-programers this is a 'front' for
the
library that ensures that they don't write something stupid and crashes the
computer with wrong parameters. The new extensions is (as far as I can see) a
similar front for AMOS, that takes care of syntaxes and formating for the
functions...

Hope it helps :)

1. When will the Gui extension V1.7 be released, and will it let me use aga
   in my productios, or will i only be able to show a AGA picture with the 
   GUI extension??


2. Is the new version of OS devkit released, and where can i get it from???

Hello,

Ok, I've looked a bit at the FD-extension and it looks great to me, but as
it's sort of a compiler that generates the extension-code while looking
through the FD-files, I wonder if it were posible to make a version with
a user-selected extension-number, as slot 25 allready has a long list of
extensions while there are several that only hosts one (7 and 9 to be
specific).. Becouse of the various FD files selected to be used by the
various authors the extensions would not be compatible anyway, so it
might as well be located where it suits the single developer best...

Hello,

To the new developers of AMOS Pro.....

WE NEED MORE EXTENSION SLOTS...

With the (hopefull) great new update of AMOS, chances are that the amount of
users will grow, as a simple result we will get new extensions for various
tricky things (kinda like the 'locale' extension) so the number of slots
must be increased for these to find room....

Kind regards from

Once I get the new one, I can do a tutorial on making an IRC client and using
the tcp commands.

>I also want to know what kind of questions you have for the FAQ section, 

-Why does the gui I design not look right when I use it?
-GadToolsBox MUST be run on a non-interlace PAL hires screen using the Topaz/8
font. Remember to leave a bit of extra space in your buttons, too, since some
of the proportional fonts can actually end up wider than the topaz font!

MAGIC FUCKING WORKBENCH?!? Are you trying to make it something that no one
with a brain would use? MWB is the second best way to get me to toss a prg in
the trash. First best is to use MUI. Unless you actually run MWB, pics from it
look aboslutely hideous. Personally, I prefer buttons with words. Pics that
seem easy to understand for one person are cryptic puzzles to another.

Its a regular library, so it will go in LIBS:

The extension which is compiled will go into the APSystem drawer in slot
25. I havent tried to compile any extensions at this time, so am unaware of
any extra requirements by the program (such as library includes etc.).

No it doesn't. You have to load on to a seperate screen and THEN amos
copys one screen over the other (very roughly described I think).
You can do this with AMOS with the screen copy command but you'll
probably need 3 screens open to do it.... memory!

As far as I know you can't dual playfield 3 256 colour screens on AGA.
On ECS you could do a couple of 8 colour screens but NOT 2 32 colour
ones never mind 3 screens!
On top of that... think  of the memory usage!!! Find a sensible
solution to translucent screens. Use a coding trick! You can't just
expect hardware to do all these impossible things!

Well how about the 3D map maker as well. You obviously know nothing
about how 3D games work. You can only make a map maker to suit the
game not a general 3D map maker.

No I want AMOS which is why I use it. You don't seem to have grasped a
few simple differences between Designer and coder. YOU are the one
thats moaning about AMOS, YOU go use ACE basic.

The SEUCK was a joke. It the Shoot Em Up Construction Kit. Basically
it does what you want, it makes the game and you just design it....
and guess what... its crap!!!
Why?
Because YOU CANNOT create a general game maker like you want without
either severe constrictions or having to code it yourself!!!

I suggested a while back that the original extension system be scrapped,
and a new one put in place. This would simply mean placing all the
libraries into a drawer, and the program reads them all in regardless of
how many are there, and it doesnt matter what order, as there are no
physical "slots" to put them in.

Old extensions should still be compatible, or at least be able to convert
to new format with a converter which could come with the package.

If you download the library from Aminet (I have an up-to-date of all
libraries I know on Aminet with .FD files) or my page at
www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/fd.html there is usually an FD file in there with
it. If not, then its a little more difficult to use. Heres an example of
what one looks like:

** $VER: mpega.library 1.0 (25.10.97) (C) 1997 Stephane TAVENARD

I should also add that full documents for the commands contained in the
library usually accompany, else you just have to guess.

Hello,

Here's a little trick I found the other day, hope somebody can use it..

To store an integer-array you would normaly open a sequentiel file and dump
the data with a loop.. Well try this instead:
MX=50
Dim A(MX)
-
Bsave FILE$,Varptr(A(0)) To Varptr(A(0))+(MX+1)*4

And to reload:
Bload FILE$,Varptr(A(0))

You can simply replace Bsave with Ssave if you'd like to have more than one
Array in a file. Or use Copy to put in a bank :)

Steady, Eddy. Magic Workbench itself is a pile of crap, I agree. Im just
using the palette (I fully customize a 16 colour palette for all icons)
just to give it a nicer look. I personally, think the 8-colour palette
works very well. It wont just be pictures, but words/buttons/pictures etc.

MUI? Hahahahahahaha.....

I always use an NTSC Hires-laced screenmode when designing GUI's (as 99% of
people using the program will never have their screenmode that low in size
anyway) and have never experienced any problems. I sometimes use NTSC
Lowres for small things/detail.

I'm not the one who thought up translucent screens it was being thrown around
awhile back it's just bit masking like in bobs, so what's the problem here.

A 3D map is the same as a 2D map it's just viewed from a deferent angale, 
and 3D is just a bunch of blocks with, or with out surfaces, and 2D bobs
that stay facing you as you turn. A general 3D map system is possible.

   Yes, this is very efficient and is the method I used in my SideShooter
   stage for loading the arrays with file-data.  MUCH faster than the
   standard "loop and load" approach and just all-round more 
   efficient, so I'd recommend using this as well... besides, once you're
   used to seeing everything as binary-data (which everything is in
   the end), you can move between languages like AMOS, C, 
   Assembler, etc. much easier. :-)

   Another thing to consider is writing a small array-to-binary
   convertor as many times you don't need 32-bit (long word) values.
   For example, I ran the scrolling-map (used in the SideShooter)
   through a simple convertor I threw together which saved out an
   8-bit binary data file, resulting in the map file size decreasing to
   just 25% of it's original size and loading MUCH faster as well. ;-)

On its way, OK ?

The existing library(ies) on aminet is(are) a tad slow and
wierd for my liking, I'd prefer to be able to use an amos screen,
or at least a new amos screen.  Hmm, maybe gui & 3d together might
work.  Still probably too slow.  Grr.

I'll be releasing when I get something that runs "respectably"
fast on my 68060.

Either that, or get one of the 3D libraries of the aminet.  All
the ones I can get to work are really quite slow.

Expect something that does more than just objects, and also less
than objects, and is different from most 3D's you've seen.  Also
expect it to use c2p or something similar that (hopefully) doesn't
care how many colours you are using.  Also expect a wierd hybrid
of amos, C, lib calls, and hopefully some asm.

I have enough source and examples (&skills!) to come up with
something quite respectable, as soon as I get enough time.

I know its been done so many times, but yes, I do have to reinvent
the wheel, yet again.  Grrr.  At least most of the hard stuff has
been done, and I'm not starting completely from scratch.

What sort of object/coordinate system does everyone like, I wanna
make it as usefull as possible.

Anyone care to donate an object editor ?

Strings don't work :(
All regular integer-arrays work (A(n), B(n)) etc.. With a little change it
is possible to use multi-dimension arrays. The (MX+1) should just be changed
to the number of elements in the array, so if you have a Dim A(6,6) then the
(MX+1) is changed to (7*7) element 0 is the first, resulting in 7 in each 
dimension..

Integer holds numbers from -$80000000 -> $7FFFFFFF wich equals to 
-2.147.483.648 -> 2.147.483.647, if you'd like to use floating numbers like
A#(n) then the *4 is changed to the length of each element in the floating
set (Still *4 if you're using Single/Fast float, but *8 if you are using
Double Precision numbers..)..

Subject: Alien Breed 3D II - LevelED
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

X-Status: 

Hello,

A new version of the Alien Breed 3DII LevelEditor (V2.14) is now availeble 
to download from my homepage.. This time however it's a bit different, I'm
in the middle of moving the entire editor to the very powerfull OS-DevKit
intuition-screens-system, so far my tests seems that these screens are
about twice as fast as the old AMOS system (A 256-colour-screen matches
the old 16-colours in updating). In V2.14 the main editor is converted, 
and preparations is made to move most of the rest, I'm releasing it to try 
and get a grasp of the errors in the sections I've done so far..

Please note that this version proberly holds some new bugs from the last
version, for the same reason I won't send it to AmiNET, so please think of
this as a test-version..

Oh, yes. I just discovered I forgot to remove a test-procedure in the startup,
so the editor will start out with a note stating 'AQUA Rulez', please ignore
this and click one of the buttons, as I won't make up a new version with this 
single fix...

- News in V2.14 (Released: 06031998) !!! Test-Version, limited release !!!
  - Entire main level-designer runs on intuition-screen..
  - User-difineable screen (only colours for now :(
     16COLS [Default] -GFX's is shown as 8-grayscale..
     32COLS           -GFX's is shown as 16-grayscale..
     256COLS          -GFX's is shown in true colours..
  - Temporaly disabled options:
    Level-Checker, Optimize Zones/Points, Statistics and the options for
    selecting grid and objects/controlpoints shown on screen..
  - Define heights rewritten..
  - Program startup optimized..
  - Both Metric and 'Real' heights is shown when defining heights..
  - Fixed a stupid bug in the Metric-heights calculation..
  - The packing of levels is now done directly by the  saver,  so  the  'pack
    level' option has been removed from the menu :)
  - FINALY added a (working ??) internal sample-replayer..
  - Killed the prefs system, it will be taken over by the tool-types..
  - New Tool-Types:
    '16COLS', '32COLS', '256COLS', 'FastGFX', 'CacheGFX'.
  ! NEW locale strings:
    92,93,206,1197

Hehe :) Right! The builder is already able to do this... don't worry
this is only a preview of my work... coded in 3 days ;) Between some days a
new and more complete version will be available. In the meanwhile have fun
with the FD Builder ;)


P.S Tomorrow (saturday 7) i'll be at the MIPS-A meeting in Italy...
someone? :))) There is a cool discussion about the advanced use of the
graphic.library and AGA  Hoo-Hoo-Hooo :)

X-Comment: Posted via MPDMailpostV2b multi-personell mailer program
X-Comment: This program will post the same piece of text to all recipients
X-Comment: In a list which you can specify. If you would like a copy of
X-Comment: Of this program, email me at mushypd@redrose.net
X-Comment: This program is not to be abused, or used as a mass spammer

From: Mushroom PD <mushypd@redrose.net> (Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett)
To: amos-list@access.digex.net
Subject: MPD Announcement: MPDMailpost V2b Now Available!
Status: O
X-Status: 

MPDMailpostV2 is a handy little utility which allows you to create the same
email, for an infinite number of different people. The program supports
mailers such as YAM, YAM2, UUSPOOL, and many different programs including
your own. You can easily add attachments to mails with hardly any effort.

The second release of V2 is now available, either from me (by emailing me
at mushypd@redrose.net) or Aminet in Comm/Mail. If you have any questions,
feel free to email me. The program is freeware, which means there are no
restrictions in it.

Main Improvements from initial V2 release
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

 * Added YAM2 support, and user's own directory support
 * Have up to 200 attachments per mail
 * Ability to use RAM: instead of diskspace for temp files
 * Improved speed slightly

Thanks for reading

Since working with the GUI Extension, and also on my Mailinglist software=
,
ive been asked by several AMOS users how it is possible for the betateste=
rs
to send their information directly to me via the net (without saving it t=
o
YAM/UUSPOOL first). Included in this mail, is the source code for placing=

such a form in your own creations. Attached to this mail is a file named
Mailform.WIN which you should simply load as a window in your GadToolsBox=

file, and save accordingly. You will also need to change the Gui Open/Clo=
se
commands to react correctly with it. This program should work with Gui V1=
=2E62
although I haven't tried.

Feel free to use this program in your own productions, just give me and t=
he

comments/questions about this routine, feel free to email me or the list.=

Ehhh, depends on how complex the thing needs to be, but if you have
some info on the expected format, then drop a line..
(Do you know the OM from AMOS-3D, something like that, but ofcourse
much more usefull ??)

Hello,

I know I've written this before but I didn't get anything from that..

Plain and simple, does anyone have a procedure/routine to scale/resample
a sample, like changing it from say, 10000 to 8000 rate ???

have now been fixed (mainly with the mailform not exiting, and the PATH

(the readme file says FIXED).

Not off hand, but it should be as simple as streching the horizontal rate,
and leaving the data bytes alone.

Just one thing, You have shown in your text that you have a line-feed
between the numbers, if you have that you should use this way to get
the data:

S=Start(BNK)
C1$=Peek$(S,100,Chr$(10)) : Add S,Len(C1$)+1
C2$=Peek$(S,100,Chr$(10))
C1=Val(C1$) : C2=Val(C2$)..

If you have number as you write above then this should work:
C_VALUE=Val(Chr$(C_ASCII))

Ehh, Right... Just one thing:
I don't know anything about the way samples work, I just know I can load a
raw sample with Bload into chip-mem and play it with the Pt Raw command
in AMCAF....

On Thursday 05-Mar-98 at 22:58:36, a nutter named Eric Hyland
had wet pants when they typed about `Re: My Amos wish list.'.

>Well that's only one school of thought, and nothing that I have asked for

I agree with Alastair Murray on everything he has said so far!

And  I still stick with my own comments regarding you when i said that
this  list  isn't really for you! It's for Amos Coders, not self hyped
up designers with ideas that are not possible with Amos!

You  may think of great ideas Eric, but only us coders can REALLY tell
you  if  they  are  feasible in Amos. Most of yours are not! Maybe you
should go and try the guys on the Blitz Basic ML....

Please do tell us though, what do you actually code? Anything?

Someone mentioned you should try SEUCK, I agree :)

Either  that  or Brian Bell's REALITY may be what you are looking for.
You  design  the game and it makes it for you. Piss easy to use and no
coding required. Right up your dead end street....

 Just a personal opinion on this , don't take it personally (James)
 If possible , extend the language to be a full new generation 
machine compatible-only and for it.
 Would piss us off and force us to choose a new amiga 
 But if that is what we wanna see , it would help on the amiga 
comeback and help software development on the new plataform.

 See ya!

Ok, here ya go.  The ratio between original rate and processed rate is
identical to the ratio between length and original length.

Oh dear,  this sounds familiar,  I've been doing digital signal 
processing for a year, I should know this.  That could be another 
fail!!!
I'll have a look through my notes later.

Yup, Delphi (and Paradox7, also from Borland), and some of the newer Win
stuff is very cool. Still say that someone is missing the boat not
finding/purchasing the source to CanDo and updating it into a tool
comparable to ... Delphi, for example... where VCLs and DLLs can be
written in C/C++ and plugged into the IDE as additional components.
This would be truely cooool.

Very good point

Hmm, a /_*LOT*_/ (enough emphasis? ;) of work would need to be done to make it
comparable to Delphi 3, but it could compare very favourabley with VB3, though

TCPI/IP network support! So that it can be used to write network
games. An implementation of sockets communication would be
ideal.. 

File sharing and locking! So that the TCP/IP thingo can also
transmit and update config files on the fly without crashing the 
AMOS app.

A better debugger which supports multiple breakpoints, multiple 
variable watchpoints, etc.

A date/time set and read functions would be great too.. it's such a
pain to have to use the Operating system with its bizarre BCPL
calling conventions to get and set the real time clock.

What else? Dunno.. that should be heaps for a start!

This is AMOS but does the opposite of what you are thinking.
It would set 'a' to the ASCII value of the string "5".

What you want to use is VAL I think (although I have forgotten what you were 
originally trying to do now!).

But, remembering bits, you were PEEKing a value from memory and trying to do 
some maths on the result...

so a bit of your code is a=PEEK(start(16)) which returns the ASCII value of 
"5", you need to convert the ASCII value to a string using CHR$, then 
convert the string into a numeric...

a=(VAL(CHR$(PEEK(Start(16)))

No it don't, a will be set to the ASCII code of the character '5', this is
$35(=53) as far as I remeber off hand..

Use 
a=Val("5") or the more tricky: a=Asc("5")-$30

I have just remembered a function which could cut this down a bit...

a=(VAL(PEEK$(Start(16))

should do the same as above.

PEEK$ should return the value of the string at the location specified 
instead of an ASCII value so you don't need to go on to do the CHR$() part.

Sorry if this is tiresome, but we all have to start start somewhere.

Does the AmosPro Compiler compile third party extensions?

Would the AmosPro Compiler work with the Amiga Format *"Pro"*
disks they gave away years ago?

Thanks.

	Could it also be Char or does that doe the inverse, give you the
string value of an Ascii code number?  Woah wait asc("5") will give you
the acs character code for "5", if you want to turn the string "5" into
the number "5" don't you use Val("5") or something like that?
	Just some thought,

Making 3D easier is one of the most important things on the amiga at the
moment.  We need a fast, and easy to use 3D.  The "unrealistic" ideas 
requested are all good ideas, and they do need to be addressed.  Yes
everyone writes code differently, and a lot of things need reinventing
for each type of game, but some things are reusable again and again.

I am working on something that will be easy to use.  Fast ?  I hope it will

Be on the list if you want.
Give all the ideas that you want.
But when someone points out than an idea is impractical and who
obviously knows more about it (Eric is not a coder as he's so fond of
saying) don't get aggressive and insulting (all that stuff about
typical coders mentality) because I've made heaps of programs and
games and I would take a reasonable guess hes never made anything in
his life. I think that gives me the right to argue over it.
Be on the list but realise what the list is all about, its not for
that attitude and it is mostly for coders so putting down the people
who make it happen(me)  rather than the people who dream about it
happening (eric) isn't a good idea.

Hey all, 
I'm a little worried about asking this question seeing as everyone has a
short fuse on this list, but here goes..

I'm too aquainted with extensions, but I'm under the impression that they
are "add-ins" for amos.. right?
Now, I have 2 pc's <it take 2 to equal 1 amiga ;) > and I do some coding in
Visual Basic <if you can call that coding>, one feature I like from VB is
the SELECT CASE thingy.. I've been looking at alot of my AMOS coding and I
see alot of "if x = "XXX" then... : if x = "YYY" then..." statements and I
could save myself alot of coding if AMOS had the SELECT CASE statement.
Would it be possible for someone to make an extension to allow that?
For those of you who don't know how SELECT CASE works..

IF.. THEN Statements:
---
INPUT X$

IF X$ = "Hello" THEN PRINT "Hello right back, Buddy!!!"
IF X$ = "Goodbye" THEN PRINT "Ok, seeya!!!"
---

SELECT CASE statements:
---
INPUT X$

SELECT CASE X$
	CASE "hello"
		PRINT "Hello right back, Buddy!!!"
	CASE "Goodbye"
		PRINT "Ok, seeya!!!"
END SELECT

   Well, stack space is limited.  The program begins by calling the
   procedure S1 which in turn calls procedure S2 which calls
   procedure S1 which calls procedure S2 calls S1 calls S2 calls
   S1 calls S2 S1 S2 S1 S2 S1 S2... Phew - finally broke out!!

   Everytime you call a procedure (or Gosub a routine) some data is
   pushed onto the stack, at the end of the procedure this data is
   retrieved from the stack.  However, both of your procedures are
   calling each other instead of exiting, so the data is never removed
   from the stack where it keeps accumulating until finally you have
   completely filled all available stack space...

   How can you remedy this?
   Well, you need to take a good look at what you're trying to do...
   why do you want these procedures to call each other in an endless
   loop like that?

   If you're trying for some type of recursion, you need to insert a
   counter in these procedures some place.

-----<REVISED CODE BEGINS HERE>-----
GLOBAL COUNTER
Procedure S1
   Paper 0 : Centre "Procedure S1 Here!"
   Wait 1 :  Cls 0
   S2
End Proc
Procedure S2
   Paper 0 : Centre "Procedure S2 Here!"
   Wait 1 : Cls 0 : S1
   Inc COUNTER
   If COUNTER<5 Then S1
End Proc
COUNTER=0 : S1
Do
Loop 
-----<REVISED CODE ENDS HERE>---

   Of course, as usual I'm typing this on my PC, so I don't really know
   how well this will work... ;-)  You need to determine exactly what
   it is you're trying to accomplish as there is most likely a better
   way to achieve what you're after. :-)

	This is a classic programing pit fall, every time you jump to
one procedure from within another, all the data (variables) from the
procedure you are leaving are tossed on the 'stack' basically they are
stored in quick temporary memory so they can be recalled quickly when you
return to the original procedure.

ex.
Procedure FUN_TIMES
x=100
y=320
ght=345

Proc GOOD_TIMES

End Proc

	Now when the program hops to GOOD_TIMES in that last line all the
variables (x,y,ght) are thrown on the stack, and then recalled again
whenever GOOD_TIMES returns.  Follow all that?
	Wel the problem arises when you have too many nested or looped
procedure calls, then too much data gets stuck on the stack and it fills
up, giving you an out of stack erorr, so:

Procedure GOOD_TIMES

y=1002
x=1232


For I=1 to 50
proc GOOD_TIMES
Next I

End Proc

Will quickly use up the stack since each time GOOD_TIMES is called anew x
and y are dumped on the stack not to be cleared until the new GOOD_TIMES
returns. (which I actually think is never in this case)  So too many x's
and y's build up on the stack (yup even though they all have the same
value, since Amos doesn't know that) and you get an out of stack error. 
Hpe that clears things up a bit, I deleted your bit of code before I could
see where your stack error was but bottom line too many looped procedure
calls or Gosubs (Gosub exhibits the exact same problem, this time because
the old location (where to return to) is stored on the stack ) 
 Well hope that wasn't too dense.  Let me know if you've anymore

Your the one who started off by insulting me, and I don't just roll over,
and take it I fight back. Just because you think your some kind of hot
shot coder doesn't give you the right to tyr, and belittle my ideas.

   Sure, there is always a way... :-)

-----<CODE BEGINS HERE>-----
Global GRABVALUE

Procedure GRABDIGITS[MEMLOC, NUMDIGITS]
   GRABVALUE=0 
   While NUMDIGITS
      DIGIT=Peek(MEMLOC) : Inc MEMLOC
      ' IF this is really a digit, add it's value to the total...
      If (DIGIT>47 And DIGIT<58)
         Add GRABVALUE, DIGIT-48         
         Dec NUMDIGITS
      End If
   Wend
End Proc

' Main Code here... 
R$="text.txt"
Open In 1,R$ : TFSIZE=Lof(1) : Close 1
Reserve As Work 16, TFSIZE : ABC=Start(16)
Bload R$, ABC 
GRABDIGITS[ABC, 2] : TAL=GRABVALUE
Print TAL : Rem ...should be 13
End
-----<CODE ENDS HERE>-----

   That should do the trick... It won't matter if the digits are seperated
   by commas, spaces, carriage returns, etc. as GRABDIGITS will
   simply skip over non-digits until it has gathered the quantity you
   specified.

   Really, this would be better if implemented with a parameter
   returned from the function, but I really don't like the Param
   style AMOS uses, it makes more sense to me to use a GLOBAL
   variable (GRABVALUE in this case)...

   Suggestion for AMOS Version 3.0 = Support for "REAL" function
   style procedures, as in:

                       Print GRABDIGITS(ABC, 2)
                                   or at least
                       TAL=GRABDIGITS(ABC, 2)

Hi chaps (and chapettes),

Thanks all for your help regarding AmosPro. I'm trying to get the
manual and compiler now.

A couple more questions, if I may?

AmosPro doesn't seem to like the old source code I load into it from
the AmosPD CD. It has a problem with *labels*. I thought it was
backwards compatible!

In the *HELP* guides included, it mentions that the original
1.3 compiler should be compatible with Pro, and that I need the
*AmosPro_Compiler.lib* from one of the Pro disks. Well, I have the
original compiler, but only the "Amiga Format" disks - and no
compiler.lib. Any way around this until I shell out for the Pro
Compiler?


Thanks again.

...tobes

Okay, now for a (perhaps) really silly question:

Can anyone assist me in how to use the combo of the fd-extension and identify.library?

The function I'm trying to use (in vain so far) is the IdHardware function. I've never
really tried to utilize system-calls in AMOS before so I'm quite stumped on
how I'm supposed to do this.

The systemcall is:

identify.library/IdHardware                        identify.library/IdHardware
   NAME
        IdHardware - get information about the system, string (V3)

   SYNOPSIS
        String = IdHardware(Type,TagList)
         D0.l               D0.l   A0.l

        STRPTR IdHardware(ULONG, struct TagItem *);

        String = IdHardwareTags(Type,Tag1,...)

        STRPTR IdHardwareTags(ULONG, ULONG,...);

   FUNCTION
        Gets information about the current system environment. The result
        is returned as read only string. This function is fully DraCo
        compatible!

        Once a information has been read, it will be cached internally, so
        changes will be ignored. Use IdHardwareUpdate() to clear the cache
        contents.

   INPUTS
        Type          -- (ULONG) Information type. These types are known:

                IDHW_SYSTEM     -- What system is used?
                        (e. g. "Amiga 4000")


If you take a look with the tokenlist program that's shipped with one of the
craft-extensions, all parameters should be numerical. Any ideas?

The BSDSocket procedures are finally on Aminet.  They're in dev/amos
(obviously) and are called BSDSocket.lha.  The commands aren't too
difficult, and if you've ever used the Internet beofre (besides
click-point-click), you should have them figured out easily.

Remember, though, you'll need a lot of memory to do a TCP/IP stack and
Amos at the same time.  WebView development had to be halted because my 2
Meg board fried, and 3 med was not enough to run both oprograms.  (exchuse
my shcpelling).

I did send this to the author already. I guess he's to busy to answer so I'll
let you guys answer it instead :)

Just downloaded the FD extension. After having started the program I click
Add to include some fd-files. No matter how many I try to include none of them
shows up on the listview! When pressing the Build button I get the message
that I haven't included any fd-files!

What is wrong? I use the real fd-files (some of the suggested ones from Mush's
page) and I have the libraries. Do I need anything else? Is it a bug?

If you still have old amos, load the program in that and highlight it all, so
you can save it as ascii. Then use merge ascii in AP to pull it  in again. It
should work fine after that.

Regarding my earlier questions,

F1 Software say that the AmosPro (AP)  Compiler will definately *NOT*
work with the Amiga Format verison of AP, and that I'm to tell you,
you're /"all wrong"/.

Blitz Basic will probably do all that I need. But I hate it. It's
unfriendly, It's ugly, it's dull and it probably supports Man Utd as
well (no offence to all Man.U fans in Cornwall).

Could somebody pleeeeeaaaase clear this one up for me. All I want is
any Amos and its compiler. I have:-

_SOFTWARE_ 
 /Amos Pro/
 /Amos 1.3/
 /Easy Amos/  - All from Amiga Format coverdisks.
 /Amos Compiler (1.3)/ - orig.

_HARDWARE_
 /A1200 HD/
 /Blizzard 060/
 /Printer, modem....bits and bobs/

- Amos Pro is the only one that seems compatible with my system. I
can't anyone (UK) willing to sell me the original  - yet someone
mentioned that they have the coverdisks and compiler running....how?

Question.1) 
  /Is original compiler compatible with Pro as stated in docs?/

Question.2)
  /Help....pleeeeassssseeee/


Blabbering over.

I get that on some fd-files. It seems like it's very touchy on which ones it
wants to use. It refuses (at least here) to use the fd-file for mpega.library.
identify.library, scalos.library and datatypes.library goes fine. I
have yet to figure out how to pass the parameters I want to though.

Hello,

New V2.15 of AlienBreed 3DII-LevelED released..

OK, after the little test-version (2.14) with the first steps towards a
editor running in 100% intuition, I think the worst bugs have been
found and the next full version is now ready. Please note that the new 
version is NOT running 100% intuition, I have some troubles with some of 
the conversions, but they'll come. Another reason for me releasing this 
is that I hope to get people hunting bugs in regular usage of the editor :)..

Unlike V2.14 the new one will be sent to AmiNET later tonight and then
it'll take a few days to get around. It's availeble from my homepage in
the moment of writing,  but I know that some people have problems getting
stuff from my server :(

Please check it out, I'll be looking towards any comments...
(Please don't write me on the missing 'copy' functions in define heights,
they'll be in the next version..)

Visual Basic's SELECT CASE statement has nothing to do with upper or lower
case... what it does is 
replace "if..then..else.." statements. Here's another example..

--AMOS--
line input "How old are you?";Age
if Age >10 then print "You are less than 10 years old."
if Age =21 then print "Hey!! Now you can drink alcohol in the U.S.!!"
if Age >22 then print "WOW, You're OVER 21!!!"
--end--

--VB--
line input "how old are you?;Age
SELECT CASE Age
CASE < 10
print "You are less than 10 years old."
CASE =	21
print "Hey!! Now you can drink alcohol in the U.S.!!"
CASE > 22
print "WOW, You're OVER 21!!!"
END SELECT
--end--

Hey again, 
I have a little question..
why does this cause me to get an "Out of stack space" Error and what can
I
do to remedy it?
Thanx in advatz!!! :)

You can always increase the stack space with the set buffer command
but that will not solve the problem. It will only eat more memory
but its takes a little longer before the error ocurse. 
My advice is that you dont call a procedure within another procedure.
Do a loop outside the procedures instead. You can exit the procedures
with the 
pop proc command.



do
  proc s1
  proc s2
loop

Well I was going crazy trying to compile an Amospro prog with the older 1.3 
compiler. But I hunted around for a coverdisk with the 1.35 compiler on it, 
BAM! it worked perfectly without doing any of the stuff in the Pro help 
file. Ive only got a bog standard A1200 though.

Hi, this is mush. Im sorry for all those who have been trying to get on my
FTP site for the last 2 days, and those who have emailed me. I have been
putting my A1200 into a micro tower, and it took a lot longer than expected
as its now in a 12 inch high tower. When I bought the tower, i didnt realise
that by "compact" they meant a tiny tiny tiny inside space for the
motherboard. Anyhow, its all in there now, and fully works. I cant reply to
any emails, as the PC keyboard adapter I ordered from england hasnt arrived.
Ive also had to send my whippet back to UK, as there is no way it will fit
in my tower, and I have ordered a "Port Plus Jr." instead, which will give
me 2 460K serial ports =))

Just letting everyone know whats happening. My machine is online at this
time, so the FTP site should be working OK, only i cant type a thing. Im
gonna send a couple of replys back to thge list from what I can see on my
monitor. In a couple of weeks im gonna put ssome pics of the insides on my
homepage, as im very pleased with the result, especially the sizes I had to
work with.

Later

OK, I think it was Raynar who requested this. 
I do have a blizzard 1220 with FPU in it. My pin setup (the row of pins on

are as follows:

      ..

the -- is where the connector pin goes. Its on the very bottom of the row.
This is the only one I have, and I do have a manual if you still having
problems.

Mmmhhh... do you have your FD files in the FD: directory? .. and the file
names follows the standard fd style? i.e intuition_lib.fd   exec_lib.fd 
dos_lib.fd

the _lib.fd at the end of the name is important...

Probably a stupid interpretation of my program... the newest version will be
much more intelligent ;)

Hello,

When I promised to put the new version of the editor on the AmiNET, I didn't
take some net-problems into acount. I have big troubles connecting to
the AmiNET at padderborn so it may take some time before it's out there.
But if you can't wait then get it direct from my homepage....

Since this function return a pointer to a string, in Amos is:

A=Lvo Idhardware(0,0) : AMIGA$=Peek$(A,255,chr$(0))

IDHW_SYSTEM=0
TagList = NULL (0)


if you want the CPU type:

A=Lvo Idhardware(1,0) : CPU$=Peek$(A,255,chr$(0))

IDHW_CPU=1
TagList = NULL (0)

Never tried VB, but in C it's:
   switch(Expression) {
     case Constant:
       Do Your Stuff for this case here;
       break;
     case Constant:
       Do Your Stuff for this case here;
       of course, Your Stuff can extend across many lines,
       being a part of the case up until the "break"
       break;
   }
Interesting that Visual Basic has apparently expanded on the
switch...case style to allow case Expression instead of being limited
to testing for equality.

AMOS currently allows you to use the If conditional in a structured
manner:
   If AGE<10 
      Print "You are less than 10 years old."
   End If
   If AGE=21
      Print "Hey!! Now you can drink alcohol in the U.S.!!"
   End If
   If AGE>21
      Print "WOW, You're OVER 21!!!"
   End If

As you can see that is very close to the style of your Select Case,
the only drawback being that (in C at least), the switch statement
is faster as it won't check every condition, so the equivalent AMOS
code would be more like:
   If AGE<10 
      Print "You are less than 10 years old."
   Else
      If AGE=21
         Print "Hey!! Now you can drink alcohol in the U.S.!!"
      Else
         If AGE>21
            Print "WOW, You're OVER 21!!!"
         End If
      End If
   End If

   This would be exactly the same as your select...case except the
   AMOS code is messier.  Anyway, those are your two current
   choices: clarity with slower execution or messy with faster
   execution.

   Looks like AMOS needs support for those Select Cases as they
   give the best of both worlds: clarity and maximum speed. :-)

Thanks, but a new problem crept up. Where does one get hold of the extension
which has the TagList command? Or is it some .fd file that always have to be
included?

One tip for a future version of the fd-extension while I'm at it. I don't know
if it's possible but...

Let's say I've added 4 fd-files but in one specific program only uses one. The
compiled program still tries to open the other three as well. When I used
the binary datatype on one small program I compiled just to test I saw that
all four libraries included in my extensionfile was listed in the output.

As a substitute for select...case I don't think either is good. They're both
messy. Try this instead:

If AGE<10
	Print "You are less than 10 years old."
else if AGE=21
	print "Hey!! Now you can drink alcohol in the U.S.!!"
else
	print "WOW, you're OVER 21!!"
endif

Smallest, and tidiest in my humble opinion.

Is my approach good enough in the meantime? Hey, even old GFA-BASIC
had select...case. It's quite handy at times since you could have like
this for instance

select age

case 10,11-13,18

Print "You're at an age where something exciting's going to happen to you"

case 80

Print "You're older than when most people die".

Look at the shoes you're filling, look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing, the way we've always done before
Look at the doubt we've wallowed, look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed and I don't wanna hear no more

Don't worry if it doesn't work right. If everything did, you'd be out of a job.

Greetings from Limbo.

I have retured from my trip (for those who care, this is a small
informa-tive message, btw.) I meant to mail back the List this past Sunday
(the 8th) when I had arrived back from Dallas, but forgot to, now wishing I
had! I now have over 130+ messages to read! Oh joy. I'm getting right on
'em.

   Well, problem is this won't work. First, you need to match every
   If with an End If and second, the logic is not the same.  To write
   it in the above style, so it will work in AMOS while retaining the
   original logic, you'd need to do something like this:
If AGE<10
   Print "You are less than 10 years old."
Else If AGE=21
      Print"Hey!! Now you can drink alcohol in the U.S.!!"
   Else If AGE>21
         Print "WOW, you'r OVER 21!!"
      End If
   End If
End If

   That being said, this might be a bit clearer (arguably the "best"
   method for AMOS) but it still lacks when compared to the
   Select...Case style.  Anyway, the point is you are still looking at
   the same two basic methods, the If...End If and the If...Else...EndIf


> Hey, even old GFA-BASIC had select...case. It's quite handy at
> times since you could have like this for instance...

   You don't have to convince me, I agree with you (I'm a bit of a
   nut for "clean" code). If there's enough interest, when Pietro has
   everything sorted out, perhaps he'll implement Select...Case in
   AMOS version 3.0 :-)

MIME-Version: 1.0

Hiya all,

I  was  wondering if anyone knows how to copy a bob from a sprite bank
to a new position in a sprite bank?

ie.

I  have  100 bobs in the bank (all different) and I want image 3 to be
the same as image 49.

I know Amcaf has a command to swap images, but obviously this is of no
real use.

Do I have to put a bob on the screen and grab it?

(I know how to do this and how to get it in the correct position using
the Del Bob and Ins Bob commands)

Surely there must be a simple command to copy one bob over another?

Thanx for any info you guys can give me :-)

Cya...Andy

Greetings.

With all the talk of AMOS3 on the way, further Amiga upgrades, future
development, and my being a programmer & coder (needing updated hardware),
I've been thinking about some 3.1 for myself (my one Miggie that I use for
programming is set up: A2000 '040 with 1M Chip and plenty of 32bit Fast,
but still with 2.04, not too bad, but having two kick's would be nice).

I had inquired several months ago on the subject of "soft" and ROM kickers
for my 2000, and got something from Giark (albeit the 500 is quite similar
to the 2000, since he was using his old 500 at the time). He didn't quite
help me much in the way of referencing any good kickers ;) and after trying
quite a few on Aminet, I still WASN'T kicking WB3 on my Amiga!

After a few tries I stopped looking and working with all the kickers I had,
having other (better) things to do (at the time CBATNAM). But as I said
here, I'm wanting to get back to looking for a kicker that will help.

I recently got word that someone I have contact with could get me an A4000
Toaster (supposedly a good load) for a relatively good deal (still no word
on this yet). It's been awhile since I heard anything from him, and since I
really haven't the time right now to wait on him :) it comes down to this.

I'm basically looking for a good kicker (archive with some .docs, plz) that
will kick WB3 on my 2000. As I mentioned earlier, some of the ones I tried
(ReKick, mKick, et al.) didn't work, namely to a few things (the #1 thing
was that they "claimed", or were supposed to, keep the ROM resident in
memory, allowing me to cold reboot without losing the image. Wrong!). I
also think my '040 accelerator and hardware config or setup might have
disagreed with a few of them, thereby wonk'ing it and them not working.

If anyone here has, uses, or could point me to a few good kickers, I would
be a happy camper. My A2000 setup is (once more): '040 25, 1M Chip, 18M
Fast, couple of internal boards, 2 SCSI and several externals. For those
that want more or need any extra, mail me and I'll give you a more detailed
listing of my current hardware setups, etc. Anyhow, help is appreciated.

Amos explicitly implments "else if".

Yes it will. I tried it.

Both. If and endif is coupled the same way as select ... case ... endselect
is so I can't see the problem. The logic is the same too. Select..is just
more advanced in that it offers some extra features.

That would trigger the error-system. One if and three end-ifs is plain
wrong.

Yes but does it really matter? The result is what is importand and the

if...

else if ...

else

end if

structure is quite close to the select.. syntax.

Two small questions regarding the GUI-plugin and I hope someone has the answers.

1. Is it possible to ghost the menus when they're not supposed to be available
(and unghost them again of course). I couldn't find anything about this in
the manual, only regarding gadgets.

2. Is the GUI TITLE supposed to be working? It isn't recogniced as a token here.

And one possible bug in the FD-extension...I don't know exactly how it works
for obvious reasons but having entered some fd-files earlier I was about to
remove some of them. No luck there. They disappear from the listview and the
program claims to have built a new .lib file. The old commands are still
available though.

Oh, and is there a way to check if the audiochannels are available?

      Very strange as I just tried it as well and AMOS gives an error
      (missing End If) just as I suspected!!  The only thing I can 
      assume is that you and Keith are using AMOS Pro which must
      have changed things a bit.  In AMOS v1.36 it will NOT work.


> The logic is the same too. Select..is just

   The logic is NOT the same.  Look at the above code again.  This
   will print "WOW, you're over 21!!" as long as AGE is greater than
   9 and unequal to 21... 


>>If AGE<10
>>   Print "You are less than 10 years old."
>>Else If AGE=21
>>      Print"Hey!! Now you can drink alcohol in the U.S.!!"

      Try it... it works fine. Look at the source, there ARE three Ifs.
      It's the only way you can do it in AMOS v1.36 to use the style
      you suggested.

      Of course not.  Actually, I don't even know what we're debating
      here!!  I was simply responding to the VB-guy's post about
      Select...Case.  In the end, it doesn't matter to me: I'll use If...
      EndIf, If...Else...EndIf, as it's six one way and half a dozen the
      other, but the whole point of this thread was that it might be
      nice to have support for SELECT...CASE in AMOS.  :-)

Stupid me, why didn't I think of that? 

And since you say it's been corrected, what's the current version of it? The
version I have is 1.62. Is that the latest one?

Yup, you're right. It's AMOS Pro that allows it. Just ran Classic too
and tried it. Error right away.

Ooops! You're completely right. But if we take another piece of code
then, like this.

If A=1
	print "Hello"
else if a>1 and a<10
	print "A is now between 2 and 9"
else
	print "A is 10 or higher"
endif

and the same code using select

select A

case 1
	print "Hello"

case 2-9
	print "A is now between 2 and 9"
case default
	print "A is 10 or higher"
end case

Not much of a difference. This is assuming one is using Pro, where the above
syntax of if else if holds true. Here the logic is exactly the same. If clauses
or select clauses is more often than not completely interchangeable. Sometimes
select is far more efficient though.

Just did. Pro claims it's endif without if. In classic it worked as it should.
So we were both right.

Didn't Europress claim that Pro was a 100% compatible to classic, beside the
extensions? Well, it isn't apparently.

Nice it would be indeed, especially for those stuck with Classic it seems. But for
me there are other things that should be higher up on the prioritylist. Hopefully
whoever is upgrading it thinks the same (hopefully for me that is). Only reason
that I don't know that is that I just recently resubbed here. 

Shall we put this debate to end now? It seems we're basically agreeing.

Would that be the one that Claes Ahlberg wrote? If so I can't find any use
of it since it only lists what extensions I have installed, not what commands
they contain. I have one small program that came with the Craft extension that
lists the commands but it's quite buggy.

Where? I couldn't find it there anyway. A new version of the DME extension caught
my eye though.

      Very interesting.  You're right, it seems there are some subtle
      differences between the AMOS Classic and Pro versions that
      neither of us realized.

      
> Nice it would be indeed... But for me there are other things that

      I agree.  Select...Case would be a nice touch, but there are
      certainly more important issues (which have been addressed
      by others, so I won't repeat them here).

   Welcome back to the list. 

   Pietro Ghizzoni is the man responsible for securing the AMOS
   source code and the leader of the development team (I think
   there is a team, there was some mention of it on this list)
   responsible for the updated AMOS version 3.

   AGREED. :-)

   Hmmm... don't know of any actual AMOS command that does this,
   but then again I'm not very familiar with AMOS Pro.

   For a "quick and easy" solution, I'd just use the method you
   mentioned above, wrap it up in a procedure and you have your
   own custom command:

   Procedure CLONE_BOB[SOURCEIMAGE,DESTIMAGE]
     CURRENTSCREEN=Screen
     IMGSTRUCT=Sprite Base(SOURCEIMAGE)
     IMGWIDTH=Deek(IMGSTRUCT)*16
     IMGHEIGHT=Deek(IMGSTRUCT+2)
     IMGDEPTH=Peek(IMGSTRUCT+5)
     Hot Spot SOURCEIMAGE,$0
     Screen Open 7,IMGWIDTH,IMGHEIGHT,2^IMGDEPTH,Lowres
     Curs Off : Cls 0
 
     Paste Bob 0,0,SOURCEIMAGE
     Get Bob DESTIMAGE,0,0 To IMGWIDTH,IMGHEIGHT
     
     Screen Close 7
     Screen CURRENTSCREEN
   End Proc

   NOTE: This routine will set the image-handles to 0,0 


   This requires 1 Vbl to clone a 64w X 64h 64-colour bob on my
   14MHz machine (probably not much faster on any CPU due to the
   heavy reliance on the blitter), so whether it's fast enough to be

No extension. BASIC Amos:

You can use: ON X GOTO/GOSUB
It's similar to a SWITCH (X$)/CASE in C.

--

XT$="hg" : Rem It's quicker to define the string when
'          you will use it often.
'          And it's easier to change :)


_Choice:
Y$=Lower$(Left$(X$,1))
X=Instr(XT$,X$)
On X Goto _Hello,_Goodbye
'                           X= 1 or 2, not 0 or 1
'                           I use GOTO so there's no RETURN to here.
'                           The next RETURN will go back to the
'                           calling function.
'                           This is a fallback statement.
'                           INSTR will set X=0 so you know that
'                           the INSTRing search was unsuccessful.
Print "Command not recognized"
Return

_Hello:
Print "Hello right back, Buddy!!!"
Return

_Goodbye:
Print "Ok, seeya!!!"
Return

Nice work really. I thought Europress was really adamant on this subject that
it shouldn't be available to none but them and Francois Lionet. So, congratulations
to Pietro for pulling it through.

Hm, is there a backlog of this list or something where one can check what's
been suggested in the past and what the current status is? BTW, what kind of
status will the updated AMOS get? Freeware, Shareware, Licenseware, Commercial
or what?

Since it needs quite a lot of upgrading I'm really curios. I have used several
differnt languages on the Amiga over the years but for some reasons I tend to
come back to AMOS every now and then. Nothing beats it when it comes to 
power compared to the easy of use ratio. Probably the reason why I still use it
despite that I have several other languages installed as well. Including 
BlitzBasic (powerful but lacking ease of use and valuable tools), Hisoft Pascal
(pretty useless) and GCC (powerful but not easy to use).

Okay, see if someone can help me out here. What I want is to take an ordinary
textfile and process in certain ways. What I need to do is to

1. Determine how many lines of text it is in it. How?
2. Use the above value making a for-loop like

For a=1 to <the value mentioned>
	grab one line of text and insert it in t$(a)
next 

I've tried with input # and line input # but they seem to want to grab the whole
text in one chunk.

Any help appreciated.

     Greetings,
     
        I have a problem with sorting data that I cannot seem to get my 
     head around and am hoping someone can help me out or point me in the 
     right direction.
     
     My program has a memory bank which consists of 128 blocks of memory, 
     each 256k in size.  Each memory block has a name and category and I 
     want to be able to sort the bank by either.
     
     When I sort by name and category the sort works fine but only the 
     names/category have been sorted.  I need the memory blocks sorted to 
     conicide with the newly sorted names.  Where do I start?
     
     I hope I have explained it clearly.  Thanks inadvance.
     
     Declan.

I'm not exactly sure how you're sorting.  Are you using a reference
list?  Or messing about with the internal structure of the bank?

Send some source code to me or the list.

Not a problem. And, for making regular text files, don't use standard Print
#1,A$.

Use Print #1,A$;Chr$(10);
That will output in the standard format.

If you used your own sorting technique rather than the one built into
AMOS, things will be easier.  With 128 blocks the speed difference shouldn't
really matter.

Here's a code fragment for you to mess around with.
I'm typing this straight from my head, so it isn't tested.

For FOO=1 To 128
  For FOO2=1 to 128
    If NAME$(FOO)<NAME$(FOO2) And FOO<>FOO2
      Swap NAME$(FOO),NAME$(FOO2)
      Swap BANKNUM(FOO),BANKNUM(FOO2)
    EndIf
  Next
Next

As well as the NAME$() array, I've also added a BANKNUM array which
relates to NAME$() to tell you which bank has which name.

You may be able to get a better sorting algorithm yourself.
Oh, and I'm not sure if the logic in the If statement is correct.  You
may have to adjust it to NAME$(FOO)>NAME$(FOO2).

Maybe I'll be able to do more when I get the source.

Hope it works,
              Nath.

     Each block name is stored in an array, NAME$().  So when sorting, I 
     use SORT(NAME$(0)) and this only sorts the array.  I need to sort the 
     blocks associated with NAME$() in the same order.  
     
     I will have some source code tomorrow.

I'm not exactly sure how you're sorting.  Are you using a reference 
list?  Or messing about with the internal structure of the bank?
     
Send some source code to me or the list.

Hi there...

Many thanx for your help. It works nicely. Many many many thanx :)

Shame there is no Bob Copy command though! :(

Hey,  maybe one of the guys such as Peter Cahill or Chris Hodges could
do one for their extensions?

For  those  of  you who want to know...I wanted to copy a bob from one
position  in the sprite bank to another position in it. ie Summat like
a simple command:

Copy Bob 49 to 4

Without  all  the  hassles  of  having  to paste a bob and grabbing it
again!  Seems  silly. Amcaf has a great swap bob command, so why not a
copy command???

A bunch of memory! :-))) Are you sure they are 256K each?

Anyway I cannot understand what you reallt want to do: you'd better explain
the bank structure and what exactly fails.

Grab the JVP-NoKids V1.01 extension from my homepage and stuff it in slot 25
(If you use Amos Pro). It holds a very fast binary string-sorter, that also
has the ability to remap the sort, like making NoCase/Case sort or doing it
reverse. Just up to you.. Average sorting speed for that command is about
4000 strings/sec on a 030/50 Cpu... The extension is freeware :)

Hiya Jonas,

Here  is  a  nice  bit of code which I have been using for a long long
time in many disk mag coded productions (eg. DMC, BTF etc).

Simply  cut  this  out  and use the Merge ASCII option to load it into
Amos to fiddle about with it...enjoy.

Hi.

Look, I know you probably mean well, but will you please refrain from sending
binaries to this list in the future? Especially if they are the size of the
ones you sent? Sending files to the list won't help in getting them onto the
Aminet; much better to ask how it's done instead of dumping them here.

Regards,
Maarten

Don't use something like this: it repeats 128^2 times the same operations,
even if the data are already sorted.

exit from the loop.

Hello!

I don't know how to upload files. Can anyone upload
these two programs I have made to Aminet? I have
sent them there via Email but they were not put there.
All the best!
