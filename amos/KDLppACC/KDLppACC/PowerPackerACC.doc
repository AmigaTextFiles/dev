INSTALLATION
------------

  To run PowerPacker Accessory v1.5 you should have installed EasyLife 
extension ( It's extension no 16 ). 
I've included old version of this extension which is freeware, but there's 
latest version available on Aminet - dev/amos Easy1.lha, Easy2.lha, Easy3.lha.
So I recommend you to get the full package.

You should also copy powerpacker.library to your LIBS directory.

You have to load & run my program as an accessory.

-----------

  However this is UNREGISTERED VERSION, and there are some limitations...
You can't load & decrunch AMOS programmes which are bigger than 10 kb
(decrunched size of course). And you can't save and crunch your program which
is bigger than 10 kb (decrunched size of course).
When you exceed this limit you'll hear bell...
