          PURPOSE

          This little program is dedicated to all AMOS Pro programmers
          that are lucky enough to own the  version 2.0 (or higher) of
          this amazing piece of software.

          It allows you to use an Intuition-friendly  control panel to
          build a command  line  that  will  be  sent  to  the Execute
          function of the dos.library  (That  is: compile from the CLI
          without typing a single chacacter).

          All the commonly used  options  of  the compiler are present
          and activable with a simple click; the mighty reqtools' file
          requester is used to  select  source  and  destination  and,
          if necessary, APsystem location and temporary folder.
          Please  refer  to  your  compiler  manual  for  an  in-depth
          explanation about command  line  options; also be aware that
          the program does not check  the  availibility of the  system
          files needed by AMOS Pro  (e.g.:  the S: folder MUST contain
          the interpreter configuration file).


          SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

          Every Amiga with OS 1.3 or higher will do.

          Of course, you don't  need  this  program  if you don't have
          either AMOSPro V2.0+ AND the dedicated Compiler.

          Additionally, you need a copy  of  the reqtools.library V37+
          in your LIBS: folder.
          The reqtools.library is  copyright  by Nico François and can
          be found in every good PD library.

          Finally, you must  have  a  few  AMOS  programs  to  compile
          (obvious or what?).


          HISTORY

          V1.0    it works; nothing special.
          V1.01   forced to use TOPAZ_HEIGHTY, 'cause some people seems
                  to like huge and funny-looking fonts on the WB screen;
                  many tanks to Pietro Ghizzoni for pointing out - and
                  solving - the problem.
