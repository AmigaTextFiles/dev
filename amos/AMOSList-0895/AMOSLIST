So the screen lines swapping is missing...

Try out the following lines on a interlaced screen:

Doke SC,Deek(SC) Or 4 : View

If the upper solution does not work, the copper list generation is at
fault, so doking directly into Amos' Copperlists would help. Or a bug
correction patch on this routine would to the trick. Does anyone know
where the view-generation code is situated?

This is the library containing all the base-commands of AMOS Pro.
However, this library has only been implemented with AmosPro V2.00.

I can't! :-( Some of the hacks performed with SetRainColor won't work
correctly, but there is no workaround yet. However, you could try to
perform this patch on the main AMOS Pro file, if you're lucky, it
could work aswell.

And they ignored it. They wrote their track loaders, that make a lot
of noise and could damage your drive because of the fast step rates.
They were coding their own copperlists, their own gfx routines etc...

Some day, there were more and more users having faster processors,
harddrives, gfx boards, newer kickstarts, aga machines, and
-surprise, surprise- most of the programs did not work anymore.
Although they were aware of this failures, they kept on coding
directly on the hardware...

Why? Because most of the users
- don't own a harddrive, NDOS disks can store a little bit more than
DOS-disks you know.
- don't have other machines than a stock A500 or A1200. There's no
need to make the games compatible with faster machines.
- don't use VGA-monitors with their machines. All the users have 50Hz
Pal (or 60Hz Ntsc) TVs. No need to use intuition screens for mode
promoting or graphic boards supportment.

DL> Now, some of the extensions (no offense guys, but I've seen the source for
DL> some of the extensions

AMCAF does also hit some hardware registers. These are:
- The audio registers for protracker replay. The audio channels can
be reserved in a system conform manner using the Audio Lock command.
- The cia registers for protracker cia replay. The CIA timer is
allocated in system conform manner so no other program gets disturbed
by this.
- The blitter registers are written into by most blitter commands.
The blitter chip is locked against system usage using
BlitterOwn/Disown and WaitBlitter().

As you can see, there is the possibility to hit the hardware in a
mostly system conform manner and multitasking enviroment.

DL> I have hit the hardware directly on my 3000 and it works OK. I don't know
DL> about the really fast machines, such as the 4000, but I don't see why it

I think you are right. No machine is fast enough to shorten the time
between two dokes to such a marginally time which will cause the
operation to fail. However, in assembler, this can be very dangerous.

DL> The best method is to use the LIB's, so dig out the ROM manual (it's about
DL> 10cm thick and find what you want-taking a day or two).

One RKM is about 5 cm thick, but there are about 5 of them, each with
over 1000 pages... ;-)

DL> Oh yes, to read the parrallel port, such as for an audio digitiser, you
DL> have to hit the hardware. Even commercial software does this!

There is a system legal way to reserve the parallel port for direct
access (using the misc.resource).

DL> Just be
DL> careful and test it on a few machines to make sure it works.

A few machines is just too few... there are thousands of different
hardware constellations and you never know how the hardware will
behave in specific conditions.

VARPTR does not work correctly (all the time) when compiled if the string

 Week? Just a week? I've started eating the coffee right out of the

DL> I'm tracking down exactly what causes some of them.

 Speaking of bugs. In one or two of the old Amoslists I read about
a Amos Bug list someone made. Does anyone have it? I think it would
help some of us new to the list. If anyone has it could you please
post it to the list, or maybe put it on Aminet or Andy's WWW site?
It would be a great help to me to know beforehand if my game will
run once compiled or if I will have to rewrite parts of it yet again.

 I would also like to point out that the address's posted for the
Amos Pro Compiler did not have it in stock. The First (North West)
said they could not get it and the second said check back in two or
three weeks.

               To Chris the author of AMCAFExt...
 Your suggestion that I compile one of the demo's with 1.36 worked!
I got the Not registered screen. So anyone who has Pro and the 1.36
compiler can register the extension. It will compile the programs
with the 1.36 compiler. My check will be in the mail as soon as my
next payday comes around.

  Help with 1.36 Compiler please.
 I'm wanting to write a utility to run under DOpus which means it
needs to be a Shell or CLI executable. I need to be able to pass
arguments to the program at startup (HELP!). Now heres the problem.
I read that 1.36 Compiler will NOT make CLI executables. What can I
do, if anything?

 My offer still stands to BUY any Amos Pro Compiler. If you know of
someone who has it but does not use it any more please tell them I
will PAY for it. I have read about people who left the list and the
Amiga for the IBM but can not get in touch with any of them. If you
know anyone like this or someone who has left Amos for another of the
programing languages please ask them to get in touch with me.

Are you very sure ? The compiler-shell from the 1.36 compiler shows
the 'AMOS','CLI','WB' icon on the rightmost 'output-type' field.
This suggest to me the possibilty of CLI-files. Also the compiler
(when run from the directmode prompt with the 'compile' command)
had the possiblity of making an CLI exec.

Anyway, you can start an AMOS-wb from the cli-prompt quite well.
Also, the AMCAF-extension will let you READ the commandline that
was supplied with your CLI-command. So this would let you do so.

Hope this helps.

   Sorry the adress's I posted didn't have the compiler.
   I have a question, when loading an amos-compiled program from
   workbench, why does it get messed up if you move the mouse while
   loading, but if you load from cli then it will always load
   correctly?
   2- this game I was working on, it unpacks a iff pic, then it 
     displays the sprites, when you move the sprites they change color
     according to the background color, why? why can't the sprites
     retain their original color?  Is it because there is a mask
     you have to set in order to maintain color when sprite moves?

Subject: compiled procedures
Status: RO
X-Status: 

I've got a problem I can't solve.

My program has 11 procedures. When I compile it, it compiles and runs fine
from the editor. When I make it a WB executable it still runs, but when it
ends, it causes a guru.

The program uses the Interface to drive the procedures.

I've knocked out procedures and have found that when there are 6 procedures
it will not cause a guru when ending. However, 7 or more procedures cause
the dreaded guru to pop up.

It's not the procedures that cause the error, but the number of them.

My system A2000, 4Mb ram, WB 1.3, Amospro 2.0, Craft extension, Turbo
extension, compiler 2.0.

There could be several things happening. If you've got a sprite that is 
wider than (I think) 16 pixels, you get some strange effects with the 
colours. How to fix that I don't know. Usually I find sprites too much of 
a hassle to work with them.
The other is stated by the manual. If you work with 4-colour sprites on a 
32-colour screen, the sprites take their colours from somewhere in the 
upper 16 colours of the screen. Look in the manual for how to deal with it.

There's hardly a difference between WB and CLI executables except
that the WB ones have an icon created and the CLIs not. (Moreover,
there's a bug in the AP Compiler which will always make a cli
executable 'run' type, so it will unhook itself no matter what the
switch has been set to.).

So just create a workbench executable and delete the icon. You can
read the command line using the AMOS '=Command Line$' instruction
(but do it early in the program because Francois has located this
string buffer somewhere in the gfx-buffers).

However, there are no automatic argument parsing routines in AMOS for
templates like 'FROM/A,TO/A,QUIET/S' etc.

This is not perfectly correct... AMOS itself supports a function to
read (or set) the command line. This works with WB executables as
well as with CLI executables.

However, AMCAF contains commands to check if the program has been
started from CLI (and which process number) or Workbench and has the
capabilities to read the tool types of any icon or the own program
using the '=Command Name$' function.

I guess people weren't interested.

Andy mentioned once that he was going to post a list on his WWW page,

Do you mean that some parts of the iff image show thru? That's because
colour 0 is always a show thru colour.

Can you give us some more info?

fB>      according to the background color, why?

If you are using computed sprites (sprite numbers greater than 7),
any currently free sprite at this specific screen line is taken to
display it. So if some sprites change their vertical order, they will
change their colours. This is only valid with 4-coloured sprites,
sprites with 16 colours remain intact.

fB> why can't the sprites retain their original color?

The sprites palette is set in the normal colour registers from 17 to
31. If your picture uses these colours, they have to be 'compatible'
or similar to the sprite colours.

For four colour sprites, each sprite uses the following colours:

Sprite    Used colours
 0,1      17,18,19
 2,3      21,22,23
 4,5      25,26,27
 6,7      29,30,31

Colours 16,20,24 and 28 are transparent. 16-colours sprites use the
whole range from 17 to 31. So you have to take great care when
designing the graphics (or use a colour remapping tool afterwards).

(PS: The AGA Chipset allows you to select base colour page for the
sprite palettes, so you could use the colours 241 to 255 if you
wanted to).

	I have a few bugs for you. These are what I have noticed
from my version 1.35 of Creator.

Math Error-- Seems to do calculations in wrong order. Fix by
simply putting brackets around calculation.

String Error-- Amos doesn't seem to create new memory areas for
copies of strings. This error would screw up my program code
because I would read a string from a Data line, alter the string
without changing it's length and I would corrupt the Data line.
It is as if it doesn't allocate memory, it simply views the new
variable as a pointer to the old location until change the size
of the string by adding or subtracting. Fix it by adding and then
subtracting a space from the new variable or allocate the memory
youself and then use copy to transfer the data.

Wait Error-- the Wait n command does not seem to work with
variables. It works fine with constants but not variables.

If Error-- cannot compare more than one string value in an if
statement. It would simply ignore any extra conditions. 

For Next Error-- has problem doing negative stepping in loop
using variable as the step. I haven't thouroughly tested this one
but I think Amos doesn't do the calculation correctly in the step
field. Fix it by calculating the step before the loop.

I probably have more but I have to think a little. Don't take
these as general errors because these are only errors that I have
discovered in my version, and possibly they may be fixed or there
might be something I am doing wrong( I just didn't spend the time
to solve each and every one. That is a lesson I learned from C
programming. If one command doesn't work right, select one of the
other 30 commands that seems to fit the job. :)  ).

 Arrghh!!! Well so much for my quick and easy way to avoid debugging
what looks like a prefectly good program in the editor. I tried your
problem with VARPTR. And your right it only returns 20 characters.
This might be one of the string bugs that Andy mentioned.

 Well I knew you could run any WB prog from shell, never thought of
passing one an argument. Thats the double click stupids I get for
having such a nice OS. But its nice to know about the AP Comp Bug.
Did you catch that one Darryl? I'll add it to the ones in your
AMCAF guide file. I might need it in the future.

 Okay I'll do that. Sounds like the string buffer being in GFX is the
reason Amos has string problems. Stands to reason with most programs
having large amounts of graphix operations.

CH> However, there are no automatic argument parsing routines in AMOS
CH> for templates like 'FROM/A,TO/A,QUIET/S' etc.

 Okay so I need to make sure the full path for the file to be sent to
my program is sent to the '=Command Line$'. That should not be a
problem.

 Oh by the way Chris, I just got your RandomFile today and played with
it. I found one thing about it I dont like. A bug maybe? The file that
it copies is being left flagged as in use by the OS. Nice file except
for that. I ran it thru my gif dir, 150+ files, no problems. Two other
random selectors failed that test. One at 25 files and the other at
100 files.

 I also used your AMCAF updater today and it was fine this time. I like
having the commands in the help file. Nice very nice. Hurry up payday.

Ultimatum was on aminet for about 2 days but was deleted because I 
accidentally included a couple of workbench libs in the archive. That was 
for the best probably because I find it wasn't working too well on some 
Amiga's - though it worked perfectly on my A1200.

I think I may have found the problem, so I should be uploading it soon. 
I'll reannounce Ultimatum was it goes back on aminet.

There is one that is funilly enough called Gox, although I do not think 
it was derived from your name :-). It is programmed in Amos Pro by two 
Dutchmen. The Dutch word for gambling is 'gokken', so that is probably 
where the name comes from.
The program is shareware and apparently included in the PD series of 
'Amiga Magazine'. I'll see if it's on Aminet. If it's not, I'll try and 
contact the authors to see if it can be uploaded.

I tried the following program:
For I=1 To 100
	T=Timer
	Wait I
	Print Timer-T
Next I

This works fine. I tried replacing 'Wait I' with 'Wait I/2+1' and that 
worked fine too. What it won't do is 'Wait 0' or instead of 0 any 
expression that will end up as 0 (for instance I/2 when I=1). The error

On my machine it gives a Type Mismatch error. However, if I parenthesise 
it heavily, it will work. Only the 'Not' constant will cause a Syntax 
error when included. Not will work with integers, though. String 
evaluations will work with or, and & xor. 

Note (though I have not tested this yesterday) that the 'or' statement 
will only evaluate the expression on its left, if you do not use parentheses.

So 'If A$="a" and B$="b"' must be entered as 'If ((A$="a") and 
(B$="b"))'. Otherwise it will generate an error.
'If A=1 or B=2' will not generate an error, but will only evaluate the 
first expression (is it called an expression?). To make it work, you will 
have to use 'If ((A=1) or (B=2))'.

This does not sound like a bug: If you mean that you used something like:
For I=10 To 1 Step STP
	STP=-(I/2+1)
	'Do your stuff
Next I

then you did something that is not allowed in Amos. (Of course this bit 
of code is the same as 'For I=10 To 1 Step -(I/2+1)' etc.)

I use Amos 1.36 on a 2+4 meg A1200. The 1.36 upgrade docs only mention 
the AGA fix.

Could you give some example code for the bugs I did not write about 
(Math, String and while your at it For-Next)? I did not understand 
entirely what the problem is.

Let's get this buglist going :-).

  I think AMOS has no idea of equal-priority operations - it always does
division before multiplication, for example.  Maybe someone could compile a
comprehensive list of these?

  This is in Pro too, but at least it's mentioned in the manual.
(Incidentally, this is a problem for any string assignment; C programmers
can equate it to the mistake of

char *a, *b;
a = b;

instead of

strcpy(a, b);

to copy a string.)  I think that adding an empty string, i.e.

A$="test string"+""

should work, but I haven't tested that (it may be that the compiler
optimizes such an expression out, though I strongly doubt it).

  BTW, Intuition Extension users: if you've noticed memory loss while
repeatedly calling Igadget Read$ in a loop, that's related to this
problem, and I'm working on it.

First, I uploaded the messages received/posted during the month of July to
AmiNet.  Look for AMOSList-0795.lzh in dev/amos

Second, bug reports.  I am to blame.  I haven't been compiling a list like
I should have been and adding it to the FAQ.  So, here is what I propose:
1.	We need a simple ASCII form for you to fill out
2.	Send the form to me.  I will then format it to make it look pretty
	and send it to a list of people willing to try and duplicate the 
	bug.  After the results are in, I post to the mailing list either 
	a confirmation and/or workaround or an explanation as to why it is
	not a bug but it is a ?????.
3.	I'd like to get a group of people with different machines.  I do
	not use AMOS v1.36 so I can not test those bugs.  I can test AMOS
	Pro v2.0 w/compiler on my system.

I will go ahead and create the form and send it to the list later today
(Monday Aug 7th).

Third, if you upload an AMOS file to AmiNet, please send me the one line
description that will show up in AmiNet's INDEX file.

Thanks and I hope to become more responsive to the lists needs in the near
future.  Going to school, working, new house, cars, etc. takes a lot of my
free time.

Hi all,

Lets get this bug-list going.

This bug is probably well-known:

-If you use 'TextLength (a$)' in an expression
 (Print TextLength(a$)*8) it will often give totally
 weird values. And crash your amiga too.
 This can be circumvented by using paretheses:
 Print (TextLength(a$))*8

-Varptr will not give a suitable addres to a string that has
 been tampered with: a$="this"+chr$(10)+"and"+chr$(10)+"that"
 using Varptr(a$) now will give an address that can not be trusted.
 I used the 'Free' function for Garbage Collection but noted that
 this will not always solve the problem! You can poke$ the string
 to a bank and use that pointer...

Hiya folks,

I lost my access there for a while (man I _hate_ that) but now I've resubscribe 
d. Judging by all the WEB stuff I just got through browsing at Andy Church's 
page there is a LOT going on.

My current projects: Just finished renovating that old Harrier animation to
                     a demo that scrolls the landing field by and circles
                     the plane.
                     Smoothing of the rough edges on a graphic utility
                     Smoothing of the rough edges on a graphic utility
                     Ran into a rut implementing my Vizhier of Vor game
                     (sound familiar? that's the one)

And of course I'm juggling 50 other eternal works in progress as well.

...Good to be back. -Daniel

Instead of an ASCII form, I will make a program where you  input the data
and save it to a file.  Then, all you do is mail me the file.  This way it
will be easier for me to find duplicate bug reports, etc.

I can also make a form, in case there are those on the list who have
trouble uploading/downloading files on the internet for email.

    I have just recently started to use Amos 1.3, and although I made
   3 games already, I always used it in NTSC mode, which is the automatic
   boot mode for my amiga.  Even though I knew you could use it in Pal
   I just newver did it until yesterday, when I wanted to see the difference.
    WOWWWW!!!! As soon as I loaded Amos from the HD I was impressed with
   the beautiful colors I've been missing out before.  I loaded the
   new game Im working on (an RPG fantasy adventure) and I noticed that
   the editor screen is larger in Pal mode (whick I like) but my game screens
  (Iff lowres32 +text) that were done in ntsc do not fit the whole screen.
   Im gonna look it up in the manual but I can't resist the temptation to ask
  and get the free fast cheese:  How can I do to write text at bottom of 
screen in PAL (if I just use locate+print it wont get to the bottom-but I 
think it will print an Iff done in pal that takes all screen) ???

You can pass an argument from the workbench too! ;-) Simply first
click on the program, hold down the shift key, and select another
icon on your workbench. The full path and name of the object can be
found in =Command Line$.

JW> But its nice to know about the AP Comp Bug.

There are quite a lot bugs in the compiler, you know? Have I ever
mentioned, that you should not use the compiler-squashing routines if
you program contains samples and musics? The packer won't mock up, if
a bank could not be crunched, resulting in a corrupted executable...

No, that's another story... it seems that Francois simply has been to
lazy to reserve another buffer for the command line and so he has put
it in the temporary raster bitplane or so...

This phenomena is also called 'reserves a lock and does not free it

It has been a really tiny bug, the only thing I had to do was to
replace a D0 by a D1.

Anyone wanting the fixed version?
(the executeable is only 1712 bytes, the archive 1190 bytes, maybe I
should post it here?)

As long as your directory has less than 1000 files, everything is
alright ;-) My raytracing textures and workbench pattern directory
contains of over 700 files, so I had to set it that high for my
personal pleasure ;-)

Goody... somebody else told me that there is a clash between the

7 chars long).

JW> ... Never test for an error you don't know how to handle.

Grin... this is especially a problem for cli applications... what
should you do if your program has been started from workbench and the
dos.library is still Kick 1.3, but your program needs 2.0 and no
output window has been created and... :-))

I found one on AmigaFormat CoverDisk 29. 'AmosCoinDrop' by John

and it will drive you crazy until you've got it running ;-)))

Open screen with height 256 (or something like that) and load your iff

And now general question: 
How high screen is visible in ntsc systems? (ok, 200 is standard, but is
224 seen?)

On my monitor, you can display up to 240 lines. You'll have to
play around with the Screen Offset a bit but generally that
should fit on most NTSC screens. For my game I have two screen
offsets, one for NTSC and one for PAL(so it doesn't look weird
sitting off in the corner somewhere :) ) I get so annoyed when I
can't play a PAL game because the most critical buttons just
happen to be located at the bottom of the PAL screen!

Why don't you set the Gr Writing to XOR mode and draw a bar (or
whatever you want) in color 32 over the portion of the screen
that you want shaded.

Gr Writing 1
Ink 32,,
Bar SomeX,SomeY To AnotherX,AnotherY
Gr Writing 0
Locate X,Y
Print "White on shaded background..."

If you are using graphic fonts (ones loaded from disk) then you
can  print the text once in color 32 and then revert to Gr
Writing 0 and print the text again in the desired color but
offset by one or two pixels to give it a really nice shaded
effect!

X-Status: 

Hi folks, can you sort out this problem:

I've got a 64EHB screen and I want to shade it *quickly* so I can place some
white text on top of it, without it merging into the background. What I want
it to do is to take the colours 0-31, add 32 to their index (to make them half
as bright), and take colours 32-63 and turn them to colour 0.

Does anyone have a routine that does this, instantly?
ie NOT this:
  For X=0 To 319
    For Y=0 To 255
  ...etc...
but maybe this:
  Doke &353624,Leek(&33637) or something equally as complicated and
  meaningless :-)

Do this:
  Screen Open 0,320,256,32,Lowres
  Flash Off : Curs Off : Cls 0
  Load Iff "screen"

Okay? :-)

I must add my two cents to those of the person who was aggravated because
some neccesary gadget was located just below his visible screen. I think a
screen height of 240 is a really good compromise for NTSC and PAL users.

With recent bad news concerning ESCOM's plans in North America, it is 
imperative that NA users latch onto and integrate with their counterparts
around the world. This is something that would help.

If a programmer just _has_ to use those lines after 240 then put a static
graphic there or something, something not related to the actual operation 
of the program...

To show an ascii-text on screen you could try to make use of the Peek$
command (amospro)
So you would load the file into a bank using Bload and then read out
the bank with peek$.
This will work quite happily like:
Open in 1,f$
reserve as work 6,lof(1)
close 1
bload f$,1
print peek$(start(6),length(6))

This means you will have to read in all of the file.
Smaller patches of file can be used too:
Reserve As work 6,buffer  <-you choose size
p=0
Open in 1,f$
Repeat
pof(1)=p
Sload 1 to start(6),length(6)
add p,length(6)
print peek$(start(6),length(6))
until p>=lof(1)
close 1

This needs some tinkering still, but shows the general idea.
You could still use the 'LineInput'-loop instead of sload and
peek$ but you will see that it is MUCH slower

(Andy- can you run cgi scripts on your server?) - I have the some cgi
scripts we use on a our internal WWW server for bug reports. Basically,
you fill out the form, and press the submit button, the information is 
sent to the WWW server, and it composes a mail message and sends
it. This would aliviate the need for reformatting, but there should also
be a manual method.

This should also be added to the WWW server. Also, if the bug
relates to a particular command, I could add it to the entry for the
command in the AMOSPro_Help.guide file - thats where it would 
be most useful.

Here are some ideas for the form (Not formatted very well):

Re: AMOS NTSC view

The largest overscanned screen I can get in AMOS on an NTSC machine is:

Screen Open1,672,468,16,Hires+Laced
Screen Display1,112,26,672,468

I guess a non-interlaced screen would be 672X234.

Hope that helps.

I've tried all types of Gr Writings but they either distort the colours, clear
the screen or do nothing.

I've got the Turbo extension so some of its Plane Swap commands might do the
trick? All my experimenting crashed the computer! Is it possible to achieve
this effect using these commands?

 Hi there.

 I see that you all collect those AMOS Bugs here.
 This is a good idea,well if sometimes anybody (or Mr. Lionet again????)
 will update Amos Pro etc.. he has the complete list of bugs in his
 hands and so he can start his work very fast.

 Well I did not mention one of the bugs listed here on the list,but I
 found one (nerving !!) bug in my Amos Pro Compiler.
 In the Amos pro Compiler you can select CREATE DEFAULT SCREEN.
 My Program works with Intuition Windows on the WB Screen.
 So I do not need any AMOS Screen.There for I slected `NO` to tell the
 compiler I do not want any AMOS Screen opened.But every time I execute
 the program at the beginning my screen flashes,because the compiled
 AMOS program opens a Screen and closes it immeadetly so the screen is only
 open for less a second.This is of course VERY nerving on a multiscan
 Monitor.Is it possible to patch the Pro Compiler so the screen won`t be
 opened or if it MUST be opened it should NEVER come to front so the
 screen would not flash ???

 I am using Amos Pro 2.0 with Compiler 2.0,AMCAF Extension 1.18 and
 the AMIPS Extension 1.05
 I own an AMIGA 1200 with 2MB Chip and 4MB fast on a Blizzard 030 50 MHz
 Board.

 This is the only bug I detected upon now,but I have to say that I mostly
 use AMCAF and AMIPS Commands because I wrote up to now only Programs for
 Usage on WB Screen.I never used the AMOS Interface or AMAL Commands.
 And I have to say:I really like AMOS.With those extensions I use I am
 able to write really professional looking programs... in a little time
 and with the Amos pro Monitor Debugging is really easy.So if those bugs
 that where found by all you here on the list,would be fixed
 AMOS Pro could be the really BEST Amiga Basic language.
 Will anybody fix those bugs?????Has Mr. Lionet dropped ALL actions and
 support for AMOS pro and Creator etc.. ? Or will he make an update
 now,until the Amiga Situation has REALLY changed ???If not,is anybody
 able to fix most of the bugs?? If there will never be any more support for
 AMOS,why does Mr. Lionet not give the sourcecode to a couple of programmers
 who could make an update ????????

Adding 32 to color indexes 0-31 is simple, just somehow (dunno about new 
commands) put plane 6 on in all places.

But that 32-63 ->0 is problematic. Only way I see to achieve this is
by using plane 6 as mask and then pasting it to planes 0,1,2,3,4,5
with minterm $20. This way all original pixels of color 32+ are changed 
to color 32 (if 0 is black, this is too :). Remember to do this before
setting all pixels in plane 6 on (to darken picture)

But, I dunno if there are new commands to do this effectually. With original
Amos creator commands I would simply set plane 6 on in all places and
leave it that way.. :) (or reserve special color for writing which I would
not use in background pic and then simply change color palette)

	I obviously missed that last part about th 32-63 colors
being set to black. What I told you will create the shaded affect
but assumes that you havn't used colors 32-63 in the background.
In order to deal with that problem you will have to either alter
the screen info directly by peeking and poking in the planes or
grab a portion of the screen using Get Icon and alter that data
but regardless, I can't see any simple solution to your problem.

I'd got that far (in theory :-) )

Okay, I understand all that, but how can I write directly to one bitplane?

Command(s) to add to AMCAF, maybe Chris?

Bit of a disappointment really, they only had two pages on it :-(

Are any of the winners on this amos-list?

Based on comments made, the games were:

Ricochet - table tennis / pong game
Gunslingers - cowboy game based on a coin-op
Amphibious - game a bit like Apidya except with a tadpole growing to a frog
It's Only Rock'n'Roll - sim of the music biz
Gonks - Lemmings/Bill's Tomato Game type game, have to guide a thing from one
        side of the screen to the other
Falling Down - a puzzle game that wasn't explained very well in the mag
In The Pipeline - Pipemania
Blox - Splitting Image / Split Personalities game, sliding blocks
BOMB - Dynablaster game for 4 players with awkward controls
Enforcer - A well'ard platform game
Return to Zantir - Relics of Deldroneye with a different name :-)
Boomin'Eck - Dynablaster again but with a lego theme
MASH - Like Team 17s "Worms", cross between Lemmings and Cannon Fodder

The bloke's conclusion was that AMOS Pro is a bloody good piece of software.

Really? Never have guessed that...

I am still looking for someone that has used the TurboPlus Scene Editor to not
only create scenes, something I can manage, but also use them to create a
game. I have used arrays to create backgrounds including walls and areas of
free movement but I don't know how to do this with scenes creates in the scene
editor. I wrote my own program to create array type scenes (in CanDo) but I
still would like to use the scenes from the Scene editor.
I used CanDo because I used it a lot before starting with Amos and it was
easier for me at the time. 

thanks for the list,

To write to one bitplane only you can use AMCAF, it has drawing
commands that will allow that.

Also, you can use the Fill-instruction (to fill a block of memory)
to fill a (part of a) bitplane.
The =ScreenBase function will return a number that is the offset to
the first bitplane. The ScreenBase+4*6 should return the pointer to
the 6th bitplane.
bitplane=Leek(ScreenBase+4*6)
Then you might Fill (look up the command) from there to the end of
the bitplane.
You might think of using the direct blitter commands from amcaf to do
this as the Fill is probably the processor at work and with EHB that
is slow (cycle stealing by Agnus).
The blitter is faster on 68000 amigas anyway.

Maybe this helps or gives someone else a (better) idea.

Assemble these lines into a bank, then call them for each bitplane
with:

	 Dreg(0)=Num Longwords in a bitplane
	 Areg(0)= Address of bitplanes (0-4 on each iteration)
 	Areg(1)=Address of bitplane 5	

Do this before you fill bitplane 5, and it should convert all colours
0-31 to 0. Then the fill will convert them all to colour 32, but they
will still be black which is what you wanted.
 
		Bra 		skip
loop:		Move.l 	0(A0,D0.l),D1
		And.l 	0(A1,D0),D1
		Move.l 	D1,0(A0,D0.l)
skip:		DBra 	D0,loop
                   Rts

P.s. This assembler is untested, but it is roughly right. You might
have to split the And into a move and an And if it doesn't take this
addressing mode.

This was very successful! I think this is what a few other people have been
hinting at, but I wasn't sure on how to use the Screen Base command :-)
If you look at my original request, I asked also for colours 32-63 to goto
colour 0. Without, it looks good, but if anyone can see a way of doing it,
I'd be very grateful :-). For anyone who's interested, this is what I got:

  SCRPOS=Leek(Screen Base+4*5)
  Memory Fill SCRPOS To SCRPOS+(320*160)/8-1,Chr$(255)

This was using Turbo's Memory Fill command, but just Fill could be used. I
didn't use it 'cos it needed to be a four byte pattern, which is something
like (2^32)/2-1 for four 255s in a row in memory!

I was reminded by someone that my technical problems with my computer
have no place in the mailboxes of 50 or so amos-list subscribers. Sorry
about that. This post however is necessary to put some of the questions
I raised to rest; I'll make it short.

It was pointed out to me that the problem with my Amiga is probably a
hardware fault. I agree (now). The machine did some quirky things and
I had never had a computer die on me before. My suspicions of the
comms program were the next thing to sheer paranoia. Enough said.

Back on topic: can two different amal programs (say, a movement and
an animation) be channeled to a single bob at the same time? I can't
seem to make that happen. -Daniel

(Using AMOSPro v2.0 on an A1200HD)

Here's a problem I've been having with displaying bobs:

I "Get" a bob from an 8 colour screen and then assign it to bob 0.
However, when I try to display the bob on a double buffered
16 colour screen the following two problems occur:

1. The bob is only displayed on alternate attempts.
On closer inspection Bob 0 does not exist half the time. In other
words the Bob 0,?,?,? command appears to only work on alternate 
occassions. I've temporarily got round this by repeating the 
Bob 0,?,?,? command directly afterwards - but this is not ideal)

2. The colours on the 16 colour screen which fall in the range, colour 
8 to 15, interfere with the colours on the bob (Note - I have made sure that 
bob 0 is the front-most bob). Here's an example:
   Where colour 6 on the bob is directly over any colour between 8 and 
15, the colour 14 (=6+8) is shown. Clearly, this is because when the 
colour register for that pixel is updated, the 4th bit is ignored 
(instead of being set to zero) and only colours 8 to 15 already have 
their 4th bit set to zero and so are the only colours affected.
I've tried getting round this using Set Bob, but I can't seem to get 
it to work, and I'm not entirely sure whether this command will do 
the trick - I also suspect I will need to use the Autoback command, 
which I am also not too familiar with.

Incidently, the program runs with Synchro Off.

If anyone could help me with either of these problems, I would very 
much appreciate it.


Cheers,


Mark

If you use bob flipping in your program, and the bobs were last used
in their upside-down or mirrored orientations before you opened
the object editor, it will think this is the normal orientation of 
the bobs, and they will remain that way forever!

The solution is to use the Editior_Enhancer.AMOS program supplied
with Easylife V1.10 which will add an "Unflip Bobs" option to your
user menu, which you should call before entering the object editor.
Come to think of it, I can probably make it call the object editor
afterwards if it is given a particular command line, and then 
replace the call to "Object Editor" in the user menu with a call to
unflip bobs then object editor. Look for that in the next version...

Well, I'm back!  My Demon account (which I was sharing from someone 
else) was closed before I even knew it.  Anyway, I have now returned 
to ask more patronisingly obvious questions about Amos!  Hoorah!

First one...

I have never been able to properly combine BOBS and stuff with 
background graphics (because I'm thick I'm suppose).

What is the best way to detect a collision between a rectangular zone 
and a normal bob?

At the moment I'm using screen zones, but they seem very slow as I 
must check every point in the bob to see whether it hits, or it will 
only detect the hot spot bit.

Please help!!

Thanks, byeeee!

I wrote a little program, doing as you described, and it didn't flicker.
However, when I put a Bob Update in the loop, it did. How you got this
in there?

If not, try changing your Wait Vbl into a Wait Key, then you can run the
program frame by frame, to see if it really is flicking on and off.
Naybe that will highlight the problem.

I had that problem once - I fixed it by changing the sprites to 16 cols.
Why don't you just use a 16 col screen, instead of 8 col? That would
probably fix the problems, and it won't take much more memory.

Well, your eyes might have noticed that PAL only is 50 Hz and

I like PAL screens very much, too ;-)

If you want to load your NTSC pictures to a pal screen and use the
bottom piece for your texts, just open a screen with the desired size
and load it with Load Iff, but don't give the screen parameter.

Or you could just open a new screen with the height of 56 pixels and
place it down there ;-)

AMOS would tokenise Circle first creating 'Circle F'. :(

Fill Logbase(5) To Logbase(5)+(Screen Width/8)*Screen Height,-1

Will make all colours EHB. (0-31 are shifted to 32-63)

Using AMCAF:

Blitter Copy Limit screen
Blitter Clear screen,5 : Rem probably you don't need this.
Blitter Copy screen,5 To screen,5,15

To set the colours from 32-63 to 0:

Blitter Copy Limit screen
For A=0 To 4
  Blitter Copy screen,A,screen,5 To screen,A,16
Next

"What is the best way to detect a collision between a rectangular zone
and a normal bob?"

I've only used the zone detection in conjunction with the pointer and
it seems to work as advertised. But if you're having trouble with speed,
try this somewhat cheesy solution:

Get a bob from the zone in question, stick it where the zone was, and
check for a collision with _that_.

What kind of program is it anyhow?

What on earth do you mean?

> What is the best way to detect a collision between a rectangular zone 
> and a normal bob?

A diagram is what's needed:

        x1,y1          x3,y3
          +-----+        +----------+
          |     |        |          |
          | BOB |        |   ZONE   |
          |     |        |          |
          +-----+        +----------+
              x2,y2               x4,y4
    
This will tell you if the bob hits the zone:

  If X1<X4 and X2>X3 and Y1<Y4 and Y2>Y4 Then Yep, it's hit it!

Or, if this is any simpler to understand/impliment:

  x1=x pos of bob    x2=x pos of zone
  y1=y pos of bob    y2=y pos of zone
  w1=width of bob    w2=width of zone
  h1=height of bob   h2=height of zone

Then...

  If x1<x2+w2 and x1+w1>x2 and y1<y2+h2 and y1+h1>y2 Then Another hit!

Or... you can download Easylife from aminet, and use =El Overlap() :-)

	I wouldn't use zones myself... I would use a Collision Table
	method... In its simplest form, thsi would just be a 2
	dimensional array that represents the 'rectangular' grid
	you would impose on your screen..

	For example, if you break your screen into squares of
	say, pixel size 16x16.. then to represent the Collision
	grid on a 320x192 you need an array that was:

		320/16 = 20
		192/16 = 12  --> 20x19 ie. Dim A(20,19)

	Then you can assign a value to the array index to 
	represent the state of that 'cell'... For example
	0 could mean that there is no collison for this
	Cell and a 1 could mean that there is..

	this would test if there is collision:

		if ( CTABLE(x_bob/16,y_bob/16) = 1 )
			'Do collison stuff..

	For example if your BOB was 20x16 pixels you could
	test to see whether the BOB could move right by:

		'assumes the hotspot is at 0,0
		CTABLE( (x_bob+20)/16 , (y_bob+0)/16 )

	This type of method applies really well to screens
	that are made up from Tiles.. If you to also test
	inside a cell for collisons, then use this method
	to do a quick test to see if you should bother
	doing the inner-cell collison test... which would
	probably be bitwise AND'ing the 'collision masks'
	of the cell and the object... if the result is
	zero there was no collison.. (of course you
	only do this over the overlapping regions of
	the 2 objects)...

	if you have any more questions, just ask..

I usually open a screen:

	Screen Open 0,320,256+56*Ntsc,32,Lowres

This will automatically adapt to NTSC/PAL screen sizes Also,
if it is an AMOS accessory instead of a game, you can copy the
editor screen size - Look at the startup for AmosGuide.AMOS
in easylife for an example.

X-Status: 

Thanks to everyone who helped with my 64EHB mode problem, it is now working.

I now have another problem:

Does anyone know how to write a command interpreter? (I don't think that's
the right description) Something that will take a text string and interpret
what command it is, but *quickly*, and not using tree structures. Kinda
like the CLI/Shell or even AMOS, but not as complex.

Thanks,

Thanks for the replies about the zones.  I'll read them later when 
I'm sober (ahem)  Really quick responses, though.... thanks!

Another couple of questions...

1) How do I compile using extension commands?

2) Wahey!  Going to upload my first program to Aminet soon and it's 
hugely fun although presumably I get into trouble if I advertise 
here.  But it's called SCROTAX and it's very original.  Anyway, 
the point is, I suppose I have to compile it using the "include the 
amos library in the file" technique (I'm sure it's known by better 
things).  I suppose there are still some people out there who don't 
have it, are there?

3) Also, just before I "left" demon, I read a message about proper 
bob techniques.  Unfortunately, I thought "Ohh that looks 
interesting, I'll read it later" and then never did.  Then, (as it 
was a PC) the hard drive got completely wiped when Imoved house and 
so I could not look at it anymore.  So I missed it.   Anyway, the 
point is that all my bob routines are like this :

AUTOBACK 2
DO
<bob bits>
WAIT VBL
LOOP

That sort of thing, which I know isn't exactly speedy or well 
programmed, is it?  It works OK for Scrotax 2 (but only when 
compiled), what's the better alternative?

4) To the person who asked what the program I'm writing was, it's a 
shoot-em-up (but an original, simple and quite addictive one, 
honestly!)  Anyway, the particular routine in question is a very 
simple bonus game.  I'm going to try to do a diagram of it, but it 
might not work because the font on this godforsaken PC is not a 
proportional one and none of the diagrams anyone else does seems to 
work:
 
                 |             |
          |      |      |      |      |
  <>   |             |            |  goodies


Right, the <> represents you.  You control a ball that bounces up and 
down.  The | is the wall which you have to bounce over and under to 
get the goodies.  Basically, it needs to detect whether you hit the 
wall or not.  It's only 3 pixels wide, but quite high.

If you follow these steps you can create your own interpretter:

Step One: Input the string
Step Two: Using the space as a divider separate the string into
          words which you can place in an array. You can use the
	  command Instr(COM_LINE$," ") which will give the first
	  occurance of the space in the command line. Clip out 
	  the text using =Left$ and assign it to the array if it
	  matches any of the reserved words otherwise discard it.
	  Remove this text from COM_LINE$ and any extra preceding
	  spaces and repeat the process. Until you get 0 back
	  from Instr.
Step Three: For each room there should be a list of objects that
	  can be manipulated or a global list for the game which
	  also holds the location of the object. The list should
	  include descriptions, flags for what can be done with
	  the object, if  it is a container...etc and data such 
	  as weight and so forth. Either index the words you have
	  obtained and use On Proc or On Gosub or use if 
	  statements to combine the actions words with the
	  objects.

	  If COM$(0)="LOOK"
		OBJECT_ID=Match(OBJECTS$(0),COM$(1))
                Print OBJECT_DESC$(OBJECT_ID)
          end if

	  If you indexed everything when you parsed the command
	  line then you could use the following:

	  On COM(0) Proc NORTH,SOUTH,EAST,WEST,LOOK,GET,...

	  and then have code similar to above in the procedure. 


	I assume you are writing some form of Infocom adventure
with rooms and so on... if not perhaps you might elaborate on
what you wish to accomplish.

I've just finished installing APME. I'd advise all serious programmers to
get it.
It allows you to choose different extensions when booting. Why would you
want to do this? We'll I've just spend 2 weeks tracking down a fault I
thought was caused by the compiler. It was caused by Turbo extension. With
APME I could have just selected a different startup that did not inculde
turbo at the click of a mouse. It would have saved a lot of time.

 From now on I'll be checking my programs with different extensions to
ensure that there are no bugs ( or less bugs :-)  )

The only other thing you'll need is a copy of the INSTALLER 1.25 or similar
(available on aminet) as the installation script is written using it.
(It took me a while to figure out what the installer was. I didn't realise
it was a program. In the words of Homer Simpsons "D'OH!" )

I've had that trouble, when running the ProCompiler on it's own. They
can be compiled by running the compiler through AMOSPro, but it often runs
out of memory (on my 2mb :( A1200 anyway)

Hey, what's wrong with that? The <bob bits> could be replaced by
<sprite bits> but I can't imagine many other ways... except this:

For the main sprite/ship/little man/character, use the Every On
command. Then, the screen scrolls smoothly, the er.. thing you
control moves smoothly and maximum effiency is attained. Do it like
this:

Every 1 Proc _EVERYPROC
Every On
Do
   <bob/sprite bits> (not the main thing you control)
   ' Keeps the game in a specific frame rate
   Repeat : Until Timer>=2 : Timer=0
Loop
Every Off

Procedure _EVERYPROC
   ' Needs this next line, otherwise it stops calling this proc?!!?
   Every On
   <movement of thing you control>
   <eg...>
   <If Jleft  Then Add X,-4>
   <If Jright Then Add X, 4>  (Does anyone else wish AMOS didn't take
   <If Jup    Then Add Y,-4>   out all the unneeded spaces? Extra
   <If Jdown  Then Add Y, 4>   spaces make it neater, as shown <= )
   <Sprite 0,X,Y,IMAGE>
End Proc

Okay, you haven't mentioned the radius of the ball, so I'll take it to be
er... D pixels :)

Now the tricky bit. With each of the "|"s, surround each one with a
border D pixels wide, with, say, colour 1. Then do a Colour 1,$0, to
make the borders invisible. Then to check if the ball has hit a "|",
do this:

If Point(XBALL,YBALL)=1 Then Cripes, I've hit a deadly "|"

A goofy way I know, but it's better than checking all around the ball
or putting each of the "|"s into an array.

  Wow.  I remember this stuff from graphics class.  Real messy for the
general case, at least as far as I got in it... I never actually finished
implementing it.  I'll try to explain as best I can... but it's going to
use some advanced math.  (Anyone else who has time and knows this, feel
free to explain further, or correct me as necessary, or write up code.  I'm
way too busy for any of that. <sigh>)

  First off, you have the mapping direction backwards.  Although it's
counter-intuitive at first, you have to map *from* the polygon *to* the
320x320 bitmap.  This is so that you draw each pixel on the polygon exactly
once.  If you go the other way, then you'll either draw the same pixel
multiple times (if the polygon is smaller than the bitmap) or you'll have
spaces between pixels (if the polygon is larger).

  Second, those have to be 3D coordinates, not 2D.  You'll need a Z
coordinate to go with each of the Y coordinates.  I usually have Z increase
going away from the viewer, with the screen being a plane of the form z=c
(c is a constant).

  Anyway, this is the algorithm:

- Pick one corner of the polygon to be your origin.  (Let's use X1,Y1,Z1.)

- Let the two edges containing the origin be vectors p and q.  (I told you
  this was going to use advanced math...)  Keep in mind that these will be
  3D vectors.  For this example, p is (X1,Y1,Z1)-(X2,Y1,Z1) and q is
  (X1,Y1,Z1)-(X3,Y2,Z2).

- Let the two edges containing the matching corner of the bitmap be vectors
  p' and q'.  Ugh, that was a messy sentence.  Let me use a diagram:

       ________p________             __p'__
      /.................\           |......|
   q /.    .......       \          |..    |
    /.            ......  \       q'|. .   |

- For each point M:

    - Find values of a and b such that ap + bq = M.  For the general case,
      this gets tricky; if you know that one of the vectors is horizontal,
      though, it becomes easier.  Smething like this should work:

A#=((M(x)-X1)*1.0)/(X2-X1)
B#=((M(y)-Y1)*1.0)/(Y2-Y1)

      That may look like it won't work because X3-X4 seems longer than
      X1-X2.  But in 3D coordinates, those are actually the same size.
      Those two lines are obviously not the most efficient way of doing
      things; they're merely pseudocode.  (I use the M(x) notation to mean
      "the x component of M".)

    - Find the corresponding point M' on the bitmap; M' = ap' + bq'.

    - Get the color of that pixel on the bitmap and plot it in the polygon.


  It's late at night, so I might have missed something, gotten something
completely wrong, etc... again, anyone else who knows this stuff, just
correct me as necessary. <yawn>

Greetings one and all

I want to map a picture of 320x320 pixels onto a polygon of horizontal
top and bottom edges, kinda like this:

     X1_________________X2        Y1
      /                 \
     /                   \
    /                     \
   /                       \
 X3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~X4    Y2

If you know the four x,y coords, (X1,Y1 X2,Y1 X3,Y2 X4,Y2) how can this be
best achieved? I've tried for an hour or so, but I can't get it to work :(
and I'm doing A level maths! I bet I'm missing something really obvious ;)

To Chris Hodges, of AMCAF fame :)

   I was using Vec Rot X(x,y,z) earier in this program, and it says
   "Illegal Function Call" whenever x=0 ??? It doesn't say anything
   about this condition in the AMCAF.guide, or help file. Is it a bug?

Bye people

I have fixed this problem now, the procedure to draw it was being passed
the wrong parameters :( doh! and doh! again.

However, new ideas have arisen...

What I want to do now, is map a picture, still of 320x320 pixels, onto a
four sided polygon with coords at any position, sort of like this:

Sorry, no diagram... I tried, but it was too hard! ;-)

Subject: Sprite -> Screen
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Is there was a way of treating a sprite as a screen, so the graphical
operations would work directly to it? At the moment, the only way to
alter a sprite's appearance is to plonk it onto a screen, draw all
over it, and then do a Get Sprite. Understand so far?

The only way I see of doing this rather marvellous feat, is to change
the bitplane pointers of the screen to point to each of the bitplanes
of the sprite, as well as setting the screen width/height/colours to
the sprite width/height/colours.

Does anyone know how to do this? I've tried altering the addresses
at Screen Base with values from Sprite Base() but nothing much really
happened (except AmosPro crashed when I quit it!)

Comments are requested, but not required :)

I just have to load the sprite bank (which I manually created using

sprites are upside-down or currupted (I never used bobs in this

I don't use the object editor aswell ;-) I hate all of the supplied

  The reason you're running into trouble is because the arctangent function
always returns values from -pi/2 to pi/2.  What you need to do is something
like this: (assuming the two points are not the same)

Degree
..
DX=X2-X1
DY=Y2-Y1
If DX=0 : Rem Be careful not to divide by zero!
    If DY>0
	ANGLE=90
    Else
	ANGLE=270
    End If
Else
    ANGLE=Atan((1.0*DY)/DX)
    If DX<0
	Add ANGLE,180
    End If
    If ANGLE<0
	Add ANGLE,360
    End If
End If

  You'd probably want to use a lookup table instead of calling Atan() every
time, but that's the basic algorithm.

	That was very good Andy. I am always running into such problems.
Get the old Geometry book out. But sometimes it does not help. Right now 
I am stuck on what is probably a simple problem. Trying to get a bearing
angle. I'll try to explain.
	I am trying to write a tank game. It is in 2D (For now). I can 
get the range from point x,y to x1,y1 on a grid. But how do I get the bearing
angle between the two points. The books says angle 0 = tan -1 y/x. But 
this does not seem to work when I apply it in my program.

	Any help will be appreciated.

Another Question To All.

		I have Amos 1.36 and the Compiler 1.36. I also have Amos3d.
Is there any way to compile a program with Amos3d commands in it.

			Thanks...
					Joe.

Joseph Muscat was asking about calculating a bearing angle:

	What is this bearing angle that you are trying to
calculate. Is it the angle between the directions of two tanks?
Is it simple the direction of one of the tanks? Regardless, I
don't know how you plan to determine direction only using a
single point?!? Assuming that tthe coordinates are the
coordinates of opposite corners of a tank figure then you will
have to let x'=x1-x and y'=y1-y and then calculate the angle
using:

	Degree 	            'To set AMOS into degree mode
	ANGLE=Atan(y'/x')   'y' and x' should be float type

I haven't experimented with this so there may be a sign problem
that you will have to deal with. If I'm way off base then please
explain the problem in a bit more detail.

I've invented my own way to find an angle as you describe, it's not the
"offical" way, but it works just as well :)

 DIST = Sqr((X-X1)^2+(Y-Y1)^2)  <=Distance between the points
ANGLE = Acos((Y-Y1)/(DIST*1.0))
IF (X-X1)<0 Then ANGLE=360-ANGLE <=Change the 360 if you're using rads

This can be made faster by replacing (X-X1)^2 with (X-X1)*(X-X1), as with
(Y-Y1). Sqr can be replaced by F Sqr for Turbo ext or whatever it is in
AMCAF (I think there's a command).

If this doesn't work, it'll be because I've got the X/X1's and Y/Y1's the
wrong way round, simply swap them around if need be.

I've had this problem with any extension commands being compiled. The only
way round it is to compile from the Pro compiler in AMOS Pro. Sorry!
Does anyone know a way around this?

Also, can anyone compile programs with Include statements in them???

This is not possible, as there is a lot of information in the screen
base structure (Screen size, bitplane pointers for
double buffered screens, etc.) that is used by most drawing commands 
that simply isn't in the sprite base structure.

Sorry, I miss read that one - If you are poking the sprite base
addresses into the screen base, make sure the screen & sprite
are the same size, and that you keep the old screen base pointers
so you can put screen & sprite back to normal before you exit, or you'll
get memory freed twice/ or corrupt memory list errors. Also, remember
that there are 2 sets of bitplane pointers in screen base (And 3 for
a double buffered screen). The first are at the start of the 
structure, the 2nd are at screen base + 48.

*HOW* is all the screen data stored at Screen Base, I've scanned the Pro

I *never* save banks along with the program. It makes AMOS need more
memory to edit with and to compile with and I am always short of memory
with 2Mb :(

If you save your sprites separatly, you can get some *really* high
compression ratios using Powerpacker (mid 90s) and save millions of
"k"s :-) Then you can scramble/encode them so no cheeky buggers get
their hands on them. And if you end all the filenames with .bin then
everyone will think that you programmed it with m/c and they'll be
really impressed ;-)

So do I! I draw all the sprites in Dpaint and write a program to
automatically grab them off the screen for me :)

Compiled programs with amos 3d are tricky for one simple reason:

The c3d.lib does not get compiled in!

So, just put the c3d.lib in the same dir as your program and the compiled
version will work fine.

It would have been nice if the makers had put this little tidbit in the manual,
eh?  I spent days trying to figure out why my prgs would run uncompiled but
fail when compiled.  I finally got out SnoopDOS and found the problem.

Well met and godspeed,

Any ideas or did I miss something?

      Well, the problem I had with sprites was obviously because I had
a 32 colour IFF and 4 color sprites.  Thanks for the answers explaining
why the sprites took background colors. I'm dissapointed that Amos
handles them like that, but I'm going to try from now on to grab the
sprites from an Iff screen made in Dpaint.
 Q1: is there a limit in size on a pic (iff)that you will grab to make into
     a sprite?
 Q2: I'm working now on a roleplay adventure, Ntsc with lowres graphs. I 
just decided to instead change the graphics to hires to have something 
bettter and I was thinking to just use PAL to get the extra size.
 Q= do more people prefer pal than ntsc if you get better graphics this
   way?  is it hard for some ntsc users to switch to pal screen before 
loading a game? what do you want to see in a roleplay adventure game?
 do you prefer hires graphs to lowres?
 Q3: how do you upload a file to aminet? just use ftp and put file in a
    partititon (how will people know the file is there?)?

Sorry to bring up the subject of amos in pal again, but I have a question
(which has probably already been answered ;-) )

I am programming a "thing" that uses screens of 256 pixels in height. All
space is being used fully so I can't shrink the screen to Ntsc size. My
question is this: can Ntsc screens be squashed to Pal, like Pal screens
can be streched to Ntsc? Does the AMCAF command Set Pal, set ntsc machines
to pal, or is it just when pal machines have been set to ntsc, to go back
to pal?

Thanks

Hello all,

    I have a feeling that my mailer has screwed up and unsubscribed me again,
so:
    Subscribe

    Anyway.  I was glancing through AF just the other day and noticed an ad.
by Amiganuts.  They are selling an AGA extension to AMOS!!! :-)  All though I
don't own an AGA machine, I thought I'd pass the info. on, on the slim chance
that none of you had heard the news yet!
    I have no idea how it works or the features it has, but it is cheap.

    I hope this is useful info. !!!!

Tim.

Hi,

I'm currently struggling to make Amos Pro work on a 4Mb A1200. It works fine on 
the unexpanded machine, but crashes randomly when the memory is installed. 
There also seems to be a problem with Amos compiled programmes running with the 
memory expansiion installed.

It is very important that I get Amos Pro running with the extra memory because 
I currently have a very large program written in Amos which could benefit from 
the use of extra memory. For this reason using C or assembler is not an option. 

I've never heard of anyone else complaining about this problem, would it be 
solved by using a 4Mb expansion instead of the two, with proper 32-bit memory?

Is it possible that there is a patch to fix this problem? Europress are not 
producing any further upgrades to Amos or Amos Pro.

Has anyone else experienced a similar problem? Can anyone help? I'd appreciate 
it.

	Thats odd!  I receive all the list mail until I send something up.  In the
past this has not been a problem and have received replies and the updates on
the list.  It's only recently that this problem has started occuring!  It's
probably our mail system!!
	Any suggestions on a way round this?

tommorrow or thursday.  If you get the mail!

Most North American Amigas are NTSC only and although they can
view PAL images, the bottom 1 inch of the screen is unveiwable.
There is a small program that I found that switches the screen
into interlace mode when it detects a PAL screen but I am not
sure if it works at all with AMOS programs. PAL screens do not
offer in any way better graphics, the only difference is the
extra 50 pixels that can be viewed. Unless you are using
interlace mode, HiRes looks kinda stupid with it's rectangular
pixels but if you use interlace then any animations that you have
will not look very good(due to the flicker). I myself am using 64
color lowres graphics and have created many nice animations and
3D backdrops. What sort of role playing game are you thinking of?
Text- graphic, top down view, 3D perspective?

     This is what the role-play game I started looks like:
   It is based on the mud's (which I used to be addicted to) that plague
   various colleges and many people play on the lab, only difference
   this is like a grphic mud (ntsc lowres) and I plan to have a plot
   with many puzzles and locations to do things. The screen has a window
  in the middle where you see the graphic of the current room (2d lowres 
  iff 32 colors) ans you can see 5 lines of text for each room. You won't
  input text strings as commands (but I liked the past msgs about commands
  interpreters), instead you use command keys (like n=north, a=attack, etc)
  for whatever action you want to take.  I just started to work on this few
  weeks ago, and got like 12 different rooms w graphs/text so far, (but the
  skeleton of the game is there, just have to add more rooms and the 
puzzles) and professions like ninja,samurai,fighter,ranger etc, regular
  races like dwarf,elf,human,giant and 'manimal'.
  I really want to work on this game but I can see it will take a long time
  to finish. I prefer the lowres ntsc becuasde otherwise the gfx will 
take long time to make and I just want to get something done to learn
to make roleplay games as I make them. The story is something like
an evil wizard transformed the land in a desolate place and there is
no one to stand up to him, that's where the player (one-man fantasy army)
comes in and tries to save the world :)
  I'm using icon get/paste to get the pics from iff and paste on game 
screen, planning to make a bank when all gfx are done, and just load the 
bank with all gfx in when game is ready.
  Hope I finish it soon :)
    and someone likes it
  
      Fernando

Did it say the price? I didn't see it...

I haven't come across one. I think it can be up to 65536x65536 but you
can't open a screen of that size :(

Try to make it compatible with both types, open a bigger screen on Pal.

Look for a file called README.BEFORE.UPLOAD (I think). It's in new/ or
recent/ (I think). If you can't find it, tell me and I'll email it to
you :) People won't know it's there :) Tell all us if it's amos related,
we'll download it :-)

Sorry, I was thinking of bobs ;) I didn't read the question very carefully.

Not on Amos ;-)

I think the factor is actually 2, so it's a 256 pixels wide sprite. But maybe
this is wrong too :-)

Greetings Maarten, and all. You sent this mail to me directly, but I think
it was meant to be sent to amos-list, judging by the content. I know exactly
how it happened, you were replying to my message and forgot to change the To:
email address to the amos-list one. I've done that many times :-)

So here it is:

Wrong -- there's a hardware restriction on the size of a sprite. You may be
able to 'grab' it, but there's no way you can display it entirely. Since a
sprite (under ECS) can only be 16 pixels wide (in 4 colors), the maximum
you can obtain is 128 pixels wide: 8 sprites times 16 pixels.
If you use attaching-tricks, you increase
the number of colors to 16, but the maximum width halves. There are no 
restrictions to the height of a sprite, however.

Since the dataflow has been increased with a factor 4 under AGA, my guess iP.
that you could use a 512 pixel wide sprite... Hmm. Has anyone ever seen this?

BTW, AMOS is in no way to blame for allocating 'background' colours to the
sprite -- it's a built-in feature of the hardware.

See the difference, right in the middle.

Sorry if you've already replied, telling me to use the Match command. I'll
know better next time. <I've just slapped my wrist>

The parameters are either string ($) or integer(#), so a typical, made-up
command might be this:

Load $ Into #
or
Execute $ As Task #

These are just examples, and are not in the program, so don't ask me what
they do.

Thanks again

    I'm pretty certain the price was shown!  I did not make a mental note of
it though!  Sorry everyone!  I was talking to M. Cox about it yesterday.  I
promised to post it here soon.  I forgot to look last night, sorry <cringe>.

    Also, as a by the by, my mailer demon (at the Uni. of Brighton) seems to

Well, mr. Named Again, it is too much to ask. Nevertheless, since it will 
not take up too much of my precious time:

If the dictionary is not too large, you can match it against the 
input-string. Suppose we have two input-strings:
A$="A=0"
B$="Set Colour A"

And suppose the dictionary is:
D$[1]="="
D$[2]="Set"
D$[3]="Set Colour"

Now, what you first want to know is whether you have a command as the first 
token or a parameter/argument to a command. You only know in advance what a 
command looks like, so you look for a command first; everything else is a 
parameter/argument:

MAXLL=0
INDEX=0
MAXLL2=0
INDEX2=Len(A$)+1
For I=1 to ARRAYLENGTH
  A=Instr(A$,D$[I])
  Rem Assuming the format is Instr(HAYSTACK$,NEEDLE$)
  If A=1                   '\
    LL=Len(D$[I])          ' \
    If LL>MAXLL            '  \
       INDEX=I             '   } 1
       MAXLL=LL            '  /
    Endif                  ' /
  Endif                    '/
  If A>1                   '\
    LL=Len(D$[I])          ' \
    If LL>MAXll2           '  \
      INDEX2=I             '   } 2
      MAXLL=LL             '  /
    Endif                  ' /
  Endif                    '/
Next I                     

Block 1 checks for commands at the beginning of the input.
Block 2 checks for commands somewhere in the middle.
Of course you can split this routine in two, as some commands will not 
appear at the beginning (=), or for your purposes there will never be an 
argument/parameter at the beginning (as in adventures) or there will 
never be a command at the beginning (postscript interpreter).

If after this routine both INDEX and INDEX2 evaluate to zero, you have 
invalid input.

The parsing you will have to do yourself, as this is completely 
implementation dependant.

If there can be more commands on one line, it is easiest to reduce the 
input-string by taking of the recognised part. This is partly dependant 
on how and when you parse the input, so I won't deal with that matter 
here. It is simple enough anyway.

So how does it work for the example-strings?
A$ will be recognised by the second block, because a terminal from the 
D$[] array is at position two. '=' Takes arguments on both sides, so 
you store 'A' as a variable name (or a constant, depending on the 
application) and depending on your parsing method you parse what you have 
got and reduce the input, or you tokenise further from position 3 onwards.
B$ will be recognised by the first block. It will single out the longest 
token (that's what LL and MAXLL do), as you probably do not want 'Colour' 
to be recognised as the argument/parameter with 'Set'.

Supposing you have commands that come in this shape: 'func(VAR$)', where 
VAR$ can be anything, but 'func(' must be closed with a ')'. You could 
put 'func(VAR$)' as 'func(' in the D$ array and then implement a 
rule somewhere in the tokeniser or parser that the parentheses must be 
closed again, before parsing can be continued. An other method would be 
to use regular expressions. EasyLife promises great handling of regular 
expressions, and has some other tricks up its sleeves, so I suggest you 
check that out too.

Good luck,

First: yes it is much to ask because it is very much work to do it
properly (or at least: intelligent)
If you 'just' want to know the 'number in the array' for each word
in the input, you will find that the described method is probably the
only one!

You could make use of an array (single index) which contains the
words you want to be reconized.
This array must be sorted with 'Sort' and therefore the array
must either be fully used or you will get all the empty elements in
front.
The sorted array can be 'searched' with the 'Match' command and
this will give you (quite fast) the element you wanted or the
element most closely like it. (see manual or 'help' in amospro)

You should know that 'Easylife' also contains commands to search in
the Easylife-structured variabeles and do so using a wildcard
(*,? and the like). Read the Easylife-manual for it!

The rountine would then be (and this is as described earlier!)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Input a$
a$=a$+" "
'if not terminated by a space, the last word will not be found
a=0
Do
   va=a
   a=Instr(a$," ",a+1)
   Exit If a=0
'the " " is what the words are separated by
   b$=Mid$(a$,va+1,Max(0,a-va-1))
'the Max is needed to keep out of errors in case of two spaces   
   c=Match(array,b$)
'do something with the c...
'maybe put it in an array or so, so you'll get the numbers of
'the words for all of a$
'I don't know the exact format for 'Match' !
Loop

--------------------------------------------------------------
Hope this helps.

I`m using AMOS to writing programable graphical presentations for 
CATV studio (teletext, timer, weather report, etc).

My problem (I thing,not only my)is :
 
To display screen from AMOS (compiled and nocomp.)programs using 
genlock ,I must always connect external synchro - signal source (from 
camera or video) , otherwise only colour 0 is displayed on monitor 
(contected via genlock to Amiga).  
I`m searching in AMOS Cooper list, but all looks OK (genlock bit is 
set) , so where is solution !

Other (not AMOS) programs works fine with my genlock.

 So I have a Question about that.. the trick of you above this works fine,
 but WHY isn`t it possible that the 3D routines will be compiled like ALL
 other extensions?? This would be MUCH better,or?? Is it possible that the
 extension would be compiled,too???

 And I have something about the APro Compiler:
 I can switch CREATE DEFAULT SCREEN on or off... I can select ANYTHING!
 but always the screen flashes when my program starts.Isn`t it possible to
 patch (or something like that) the compiler so this would NOT m flash ??
 It is VERY nerving for MultiSync users !!

Well, in the regular AMOS Pro menus, you do: Menu Inactive, which is listed
on page 06.05.08 of the User's Guide.

I really don't understand the problem.  Maybe it's the genlock you are using.
Almost every program I write has been used with the genlock at one point or
another and AMOS sends everything fine.

How can a genlock tell amos not to send information?

That really does not do what I want.  When you look at a menu
on the workbench for instance, that is what I mean
not the way Menu Inactive does things.

Hold on, a while ago I had the same problem when I was working on a 
Saboteur style game. Back then I wrote a routine to "promote" sprite

But I actually meant this:

I'll get it right soon ;-)

Here are examples from the *actual* program, which will be a point and
click adventure creator (maybe one day) :

IncVar # - eg IncVar 57
Character # Walk To #,# - eg Character 2 Walk To 160,100
Character # Say $ - eg Character 11 Say "I've got nothing to say"
Exit On #
etc
Get the idea?

Thanks

  Sure - just add the "wb" option to the compiler command line, or select
"Send AMOS to back on booting" from the Compiler Shell.

	Why don't you take your command string and turn all
numbers into a # sign and then all non-recognised text strings
within the command string into $ signs(storing the values and
text strings in two arrays indexed by their appearance in the
command line.) Once the new command line is formed you can check
it against the possible combinations that appear in your command
list simply using the match command in amos. If match returns a
-1 then you have an error in your parsing routine. Otherwise you
simply use the index returned along with the variables stored in
the number and text arrays to either run a procedure or a gosub(I
guess) using On INDEX Whatever....

So what you would need is a procedure or routine that would take
the command string and traverse it using the Instr command.
Identify each sub string(Using match and a sorted list of all
command substrings) as either Command Portion, Number or
Unidentified Text Portion. The Command Portion simply gets added
to the new string. The Number portion gets a # added into the
string, the number is stored in the NUMVAR array and the index
for that array is incremented. The Unidentified Text Portion gets
a $ added to the new command string and the text gets stored in
the STRVAR$ array with it's index being incremented.

After this parsing, simply match the new command string to a
sorted array of command possibilities and use the index to jump
to a procedure. The NUMVAR and STRVAR$ should be global or shared
arrays so that your routine can access the values and use them.

The error routines for each of the command routines could check
that all values are less than 256 or whatever.

> Get the idea?

But now, I've remembered that I've already solved half this problem. My
solution is using semi-Bacus Naur notation, to match the command with
parameters. Sorry, I forgot that I'd done this much, I hadn't got
round to implimenting it in my program. The method used involves pattern
matching with Easylife or AMCAF commands. A command could be written as

"Character "+(0-255)+" Say "+(Text) (Character # Say $)

The (0-255) isn't recognised as a number from 0-255 so a bit of logic
is involved, to work out what it should be. This could be done as this:

(0-255) = "([0-2][0-9][0-9])"

But this takes any number from 0 to 299, and all the numbers that are
inputted have to have leading 0s, eg 001, 064, 242, etc

To cut a long story short, this is basically what I got (it could be
wrong 'cos I re-working it out as I'm writing this) :

([0-9]) | ([0-9][0-9]) | ([0-1][0-9][0-9]) | ([2][0-4][0-9]) | ([2][5][0-5])
^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  0-9   or     0-99    or      0-199       or    200-249     or   250-255

I know it looks ugly, but if you follow it through it all makes sense.
And leading 0s don't have to be added. Even if they are added, it should
be able to cope with them. Every possible integer between 0-255 should work
with the above. If you think otherwise, please tell me :) Of course, they
can easily be altered to cope with other ranges of numbers.

The (Text) part is *much* easier. It's done like this:

(Text) = Chr$(34)+"[*]"+Chr$(34) (where Chr$(34) is a speech mark)

So, with this, a function can be constructed to check that it is right:

=Pattern Match(SOURCE$,COMMAND$) in AMCAF    \ I think these are right
=Elpat NoCase(SOURCE$,COMMAND$)  in Easylife / Swap parameters if not

Where SOURCE$ is the inputted command, and COMMAND$ is the current command
being checked for. Obviously, I have to check through each command until
I find the matching one, but there are only 30ish commands.

Anyway, that's the first part of the problem done for you/me. Now you/I
have to work out what the parameters are, given that you/I know what the
command is. That's much easier, but I want a universal function that
will work for all commands.

Thanks

	What I think you have to do is when you define your menu,
each item that can be deactivated must include as the third
option the shaded version of itself.

For example:

Menu$(1,2)="An Option",,"(Shade On)An Option"
...

Menu On

...

Then when you want to shade it you use:

Menu Inactive(1,2)

To unshade it use:

Menu Active(1,2)

---
The Menu$ function uses the following:

Menu$(,,)=normal$,[selected$],[inactive$],[background$]

any of the items in []'s can be left out. To remove a definition,
simply set it to "". Commas should be used to hold options that
you don't want to change.
I am not 100% sure that you can use Shade On as an imbedded
command but if you can't then you can call a procedure as an
imbedded command and within that procedure you could set the
Shade On. Normally if the inactive$ is left out, italics is used
to show that the item is inactive.

I never use menus, and I doubt I ever will, but I do know that menus can
call procedures, whilst they're being drawn with inbedded commands. If
you did this, you could print the ghosted items with the Shade On command.
I don't know how, because I've never used either command, but that's how
I reckon it can be done in AMOS.

Greetings Clay, you wrote some text on the subject platforms, and now I'm
going to answer it.

You shouldn't use zones for platforms, nor bobs. They slow the game down
and it's "unprofessional". This is the way it should be done, which
happens to be the way commerical m/c programmers do it :-)

Use a two dimensional array, say LEV() to hold the map details. You have
to break the map down into 16 by 16 pixel blocks and draw icons of this
size, containing all the graphics needed. Make sure that they fit together
nicely. Then you'll have to create a map editor. There are a few on aminet
but I always prefer to create my own. This code ought to do the trick:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Screen Open 0,320,192,32,lowres
Flashoff:Cursoff:Cls 0

Load "Icons.abk"
Get Icon Palette
' B=Block/Icon to draw with
B=1

Repeat

   XM=Xscreen(Xmouse):YM=Yscreen(Ymouse):MK=Mousekey
   XB=XM/16:YB=YM/16

   ' Place a block
   If MK=1
      Paste Icon XB*16,YB*16,B
      LEV(XB,YB)=B
   Endif

   ' Delete a block
   If MK=2
      Cls 0,XB*16,YB*16 To XB*16+16,YB*16+16
   Endif

   ' You could insert a bit of code in here to alter the block that you
   ' are currently using, maybe using the left and right arrow keys?

Until Keystate(69) : Rem Press escape to save the level

' Save the map
Openout 1,"Level"
For x=0 to 320/16-1
   For y=0 to 192/16-1
      Print #1,LEV(x,y)
   Next y
Next x
Close 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

That will save your map as a sequential file, not the best way to do it,
but the easiest ;-)

Now, the game:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Screen Open 0,320,192,32,lowres
Flashoff:Cursoff:Cls 0

Load "Icons.abk"
Get Icon Palette
Load "Sprites.abk"

' Load the map
Openin 1,"Level"
For x=0 to 320/16-1
   For y=0 to 192/16-1
      Input #1,LEV(x,y)
      If LEV(x,y)>0 Then Paste Icon x*16,y*16,LEV(x,y)
   Next y
Next x
Close 1

X=x pos of sprite (Sprite is 16 by 16 pixels)
Y=y pos of sprite (and the hot spot is in the top left)

XSP=0:YSP=0 : Rem Speed of sprite

Repeat

   Add X,XSP:Add Y,YSP
   XSP=XSP/1.1

   ' Look directly under the sprites feet
   If LEV(X/16,(Y+16)/16)=0 and LEV((X+15)/16,(Y+16)/16)=0
      ' Nothing there so drop
      Inc YSP
   Else
      YSP=0
      ' Jump if push up, it's on land
      If Jup(1):YSP=-10:Endif
   Endif

   If Jleft(1):Add XSP,-2:Endif
   If Jright(1):Add XSP,2:Endif

   ' Place Sprite, not animated, you can do that yourself :-)
   Sprite 0,XHard(X),Yhard(Y),1

   Wait vbl

Until KeyState(69)

End
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This *should* do it, but I've probably missed out something really
obvious, as I often do ;-) It will probably be more slippery and slidey
than Technoventure, but that can be altered by increasing the 1.1 in
XSP=XSP/1.1

I hope this has helped, I hope you can follow my code. I can never follow
other people's, but this is pretty simple. To check if the sprite has
walked into a wall, it is pretty much the same thing as looking under
the sprites feet, except you look left or right. Tell me if you want a
better explaination, a more complex explaination or a more confusing
explaination if you need to.

Why does everyone apart from me have problems with the 3D extension. I know
it's a crappy extension and OM is a terrible piece of software, but it
doesn't need WB1.3. It works fine on my A600 (WB2.something) and my
A1200 (WB3.something). I don't have to use degrader, fake fast, Relokick
etc to get it to work, it just does.

Can't anyone else get OM to run on anything more than a 1.3 Amiga?

    OK all.  I checked the ad. for the AGA extension last night.  I was in

AmigaNuts themselves to find out more details!

    Sorry about that.  I don't have the time to find out more myself at the
moment.  There is only one other company that are distributing the extension
but I don't know who they are.  Any one else know?

    If someone does get hold of it then let us know what it's like!!!!!

Tim.

I haven't tried for a while but my A500+ will only run OM if I switch to 
1.3 ROM - someone did tell me the way to get Amos3D working with AmosPro 
but accepted that OM only works with WB1.3

Well, if you do some risky and tricky operations on the screen base
and the sprite bank, it would work (I think).

However, you could lower the crash-risk by just copying the screen
memory into the sprite image (if you copy the right amount and the
sprite size is fixed).

It's simply the way the Amiga Custim Chips handle sprites. However,
you can create really fancy effects etc using sprites. Sprites hardly
need any cpu power, but they have their limitations.

fB>  Q1: is there a limit in size on a pic (iff)that you will grab to make into
fB>      a sprite?

One Sprite always 16 pixels wide. Using all eight sprites will allow
you to use a 128 pixel wide sprite in 4 colour mode, or an 64 pixel
wide sprite in 16 colours mode.

fB>  Q= do more people prefer pal than ntsc if you get better graphics this

I'd prefer PAL, but there are many people out there which prefere
NTSC screens because of the higher refresh rate.

fB>  is it hard for some ntsc users to switch to pal screen before

You can switch to pal yourself in your program...

fB> loading a game? what do you want to see in a roleplay adventure game?
fB>  do you prefer hires graphs to lowres?

Hires gfx would be neat, but you can only use 16 colours on a hires
screen on ECS Amigas.

fB>  Q3: how do you upload a file to aminet? just use ftp and put file in a
fB>     partititon (how will people know the file is there?)?

I upload my files in a special bbs, which sends the files to the main
ftp server... This way is not very reliable. I've tried to upload
Tubes there 4 times (3 times it didn't came to U.Mller and the last
one he told me, that he accidentially had erased the Tubes archive
:-(((( ).

That's quite true ;-) I usually have 3.5 megs of ram free after
starting AMOS... this is sufficient for working with programs having
really big banks ;-)

I can crunch my sprites along with the program using any packer. (I

If they really want to get the data, they can get it, even if it's

There's the chance that your program wants to use chip memory but
does not demand a memory chunk of chip-ram type, so it crashes the
machine, when it get's fast memory?

In fact, I never have such problems (well at least not in conjunction
with expansion ram et al).

What are the main memory allocations you do in your program, what are
you generally doing in memory, which extensions do you have (and
use)?

MW> I've never heard of anyone else complaining about this problem, would it be

Note that it is pretty discouraged to use 16 bit memory and 32 bit
memory at the same time.

Try out something like this:

Screen Open 0,320,200,2,0
Curs Off : Flash Off : Paper 0 : Pen 1
Degree 
Do 
  MX=X Screen(X Mouse)
  MY=Y Screen(Y Mouse)
  Wait Vbl

  DX=160-MX
  DY=100-MY
  If DX<>0

    If DY<0
      W=90
    Else 
      W=270
    End If 
  End If 
  If DX>0 Then Add W,180
  W=(W+360) mod 360
  Draw 160,100 To 160+Cos(W)*16,100+Sin(W)*16
  Locate 0,20 : Print W
Loop 

Not very optimized, but it works ;-)

rs is a counter which is increased by a specific value:

rs.l adds 4 to the counter. Used for longword values (read out with Leek)
rs.w adds 2 to the counter. Used for word values (read out with Deek
			    (or if it is 'signed' use Sdeek))
rs.b adds 1 to the counter. Used for byte values (read out with Peek).

The number behind the rs.x statement tells you how many of these
longwords/words/bytes are stored there.

Examples:

EcLogic  - begins at offset 0. Contains (only) 6 longword pointers to
	   the current=logic bitplanes (Lionet suxx! ;-(((( ).
			      .----------------^

It just set's the screen to a 50 Hz display, so it's a PAL type
screen. Moreover, the execbase is altered to think it's a PAL system.

No. It will work the otherway round aswell... so you can set any NTSC
machine to PAL with this command.

I tried it myself and couldn't reproduce this bug. (I tried again at
this moment and know what's wrong)

You have forgotten to precalculate the vector matrix and/or to set
the camera to the right values (that means, that the z distance is
not ZERO).

Have you tried setting the inactive$ parameter of the Menu$ command?  Maybe
I am not sure what you are trying to do?  If you mean have it look eactly
the style of the WB inactive menu items, I am not sure how you would forma
it to get the same results.  But, 6.5.3 talks about inactive$ and it says
you can change the appearance with it.

Well, I am finally starting to grasp the AMOS Pro interface language.  I
don't know why it has taken so long but it has!  Thanks to Mr. Hickman for
his improved Resource bank and his guide to what images are good for what.

I am using the interface language to create the interface for the AMOS Bug
report program.  Coming along quite nicely, except that I want to use radio
buttons.  Making the buttons turn off and on when another is selected is
very simple.  However, how do I know WHICH radio button is on when the user
wants to save the information?  I am using radio buttons for Amiga model,
CPU, OS, and a couple other things.  I thought I had the answer when I
found the RDIALOG command on page 9.3.4.  It basically says each button is
also an object and is numbered from 0 to whatever.  However, if I have 4
buttons numbered 1,2,3,3 (with button 3 being radio buttons) then the
object numbers are 0,1,2,3, respectively.  However, when the command
rdialog(1,3,2) is executed it says Interface Channel not defined or
something like that.

Anyone familiar with this?

Michael

Maybe it's genlock, but why ALL others programs (like Scala ,DPaint, 
games (not AMOS games) works fine ,only AMOS programs & interpreter 
not ???. It's not a big problem because in tv studio I have always
external synchro source, but problem WHY ?.  
What a genlock are you using ?

The original version of OM just would NOT work on my A4000/030, only
on my 1.3 A500.  However, the version of OM that one of the Amiga
mags gave away a while ago DOES work on my A4000.

Therefore, you might like to check the version of OM you have, if
you are having probs with running on anything more than a 1.3 Amy.

> Severity:		Crashes Amiga!

	When using large 2d arrays, declaring them does not cause an error!  Even
when you set the variable buffer to large amounts of memory (e.g. 50 - 100!!).
The problem occurs when you try and write to the array at a position some way
into the array.
EXAMPLE: Declaring a 100*100 array, trying to write to location 100,81 causes
the machine to freeze.  Reset time.  I did some checking myself and found that
the machine location for the array is not continuous!!!
	Varptr(a(0,0)) = 254000   // rough example!
	Varptr(a(0,1)) = 254004   // or equivalent step (maybe not a Long Word)
	.
	.
	.
	Varptr(a(0,79)) = 26xxx   // rough...
	Varptr(a(0,81)) = 16000	  // !!!!!!!!!!!

	The editor is reserving enough memory for the array, but because of the
memory chunk management is not actually reserving it as a continuous block!
The referencing functions however, reckon it is!!  So when you write to where
the array storage should be but isn't.........  you get the picture.  A whole
manner of different crashes can be obtained!!!
	This is obviously NOT GOOD!!  Problem can be got round by using data banks
and (P/D/L)oke & (P/D/L)eek commands!

Well, I dunno perhaps I am expecting too much? :)
I know that in AmigaBASIC (gasp) you could actually use
the same structure or whatever to ghost menu items.

I think that perhaps turning text shading on is
the best I will get...

I will have to try this, it is probably as close
to what I want as I will get.

I might get it soon, but buying AMCAF has left me a bit short on money :)

I'll ring up and ask some really hard questions about it ;) like:

   Will the packing routines work with AGA screens?
   Which extension slot does it take? (Are there any free slots?)
   Is it an extension, or a patch on the AMOSPro.library?
   Has the object editor been altered/rewriten? (Never use it anyway)
   Can hires sprites be used?
   Is it compatible with my A600? ;-)))
   Can 8 layer dual playfields be created? :)
   Can the bi-tripilator be made to work with the hormet 442 chip? ;)

Anyone got any other questions to ask? Make them really technical! I hope
there's a really thick bloke on the phones, or even better, a *woman* who's
doesn't even know what an Amiga 1200 is, let alone AMOS! ;-)

1) I have tried to patch the Amos Pro help file with both AMCAF and 
EasyLife, but neither seems to actually do anything!  What am I doing 
wrong!?

2) I got that program on Aminet (can't remember the name, something 
like APME or something starting with AP) which lets you choose 
between different configurations when you load so you can load 
without extensions if you like, so I created two config files, one 
with all the extensions, one with none, but both do the same and load 
up with all of them.  Is there something obvious I'm doing wrong here 
too?

3) Also, I've asked this before, but how do I compile outside the 
Amos Pro Editor program using extensions?

Thanks!

Greetings Chris, you wrote some text on the subject Re: amos in pal (again),
and now I'm going to answer it.

> BW> Does the AMCAF command Set Pal, set ntsc machines

Does it wobble? When I put my Pal amiga in Ntsc, bottom of the screen
wobbles a bit (not when changing, all the time)

And, is the picture clear?

Do Ntsc users "mind" if I change the mode (and change it back when
finished) ?

How about this... the program I am writing is mouse operated and there is
no room to make the screen any smaller, so how about having the screen
scroll up and down, so Ntsc users can use all the icons, etc?

Greetings Semprini, you wrote some text on the subject Extensions, and now
I'm going to answer it.



First, can you stop putting loads of spaces before the subject. Or is it
the mailer you are using? Try to get it to stop.



Now, what seems to be the matter...

An idea!

Use the command line version, unlike the shell, it loads the extensions.
Something which I've only just found out :)

eg. ApCmp Program.AMOS TO Program

I had the same problem.  What I have done is edit the AMOS script that is
put in the same directory as AMOSPro.  Add a line where it copies
T:AMOSPro_Interpreter_Config to S:

Well, you use the command line compiler, apcmp (I think it is).

Looks like ppACCESSORY has finally made it to Amiga Shopper magazine
Issue #52, August 1995 !! :)

Welp to keep ya all posted I have been working for quite sometime on the 
next version and is about 3/4 complete. I have added a whole new interface
that is much better/professional looking with all new requesters as well. 
Not only have I added a new look, but have added the ability to crunch 
your source code using IMPLODER as well as PowerPacker. ARexx will also 
be suppported in the registered version.

This version which will be known as ppACCESSORY v2.0 will now be considered 
SHAREWARE as well as being a unregistered version. Not to fear because 
I have not disabled any functions and it is fully workable, but has a few 
irritating requesters that the unregistered version will not have.

ppACCESSORY has come along way since I first started work on it and I 
hope that someone has found some use for it. I know that I use it all the 
time to save on the disc space :)

Is this *a* discovery, or is it common knowledge?

Hi everyone!

I just uploaded my new game ULTIMATUM to Aminet, so if you're interested 
in a 3d tank sort of game (programmed in Amos3D) then check it out. You 
can find it at:

	phoenix.doc.ic.ac.uk
	ftp.wustl.edu
	ftp.luth.se

...in the /pub/aminet/game/shoot directory.

Here's the .readme file if you want some more info about the game:

Short:    Great 3D Tank Game!
Uploader: co314519@student.uq.edu.au
Author:   co314519@student.uq.edu.au
Type:     game/shoot


NOTE: ULTIMATUM IS A SHAREWARE GAME - SEE DOCUMENTATION FOR MORE INFO.
                     ^^^^^^^^^

Version 1.2 - Release Date: 16/8/95

   Ultimatum is a 3D tank game in the vein of Battlezone and Cybersled.
You play the Vindicator Rick Murphy and must fight Eight opponents -
Seven Transgressors and their leader Traxxion. Each fight is one on one
and takes place within the city's Battle Arena. The game is very fast
and furious and includes:

   - A full 3D arena
   - Intelligent and varied opponents
   - Standard Laser and Missile weapons
   - Over 10 special Power-Ups and Extra-Weapons
   - Digitised Speech for the Opponent, Commentators and Crowd
   - Digitised Sound Effects
   - Full Music score
   - Practice mode
   - In-game Help Screens
   - AmigaGuide documentation
   - Options to suit your playing preferences.

New stuff in Version 1.2:
   - options are saved and restored automatically
   - skip the intro by pressing any key
   - exit to WB by pressing <ESC> at the Main Menu
   - specials can be destroyed with your missiles.

Enjoy the game!  Let us know what you think of our game.
It doesn't take much effort to send some email :))

It has been mentioned before, but not for a while. This was back in
the pre AMOSPro days, and the problem when was that although
AMOS supported Xor, the compiler didn't. That may well have been
fixed with the pro compiler.

I don't know what AMCAF does, but easylife doesn't change the
help file - it creates an amigaguide file from it. The original help
file shouldn't be changed. Also, easylife expects an AMOSPro2.0
help file to patch from.

APME I admit is not that nice - I was fed up with constantly 
installing various versions of easylife when I was developing it, so
I changed 2 bytes in the AMOSPro executable with a hex editor so
it look for the AMOSPro_Config file in T: instead of S:, and wrote a
program to copy a selected config file to T: then run AMOSPro. It
does check the AMOSPro version number before changing it, but I
suppose its possible that there are different real versions of 
AMOSPro with the same version number. Mike solution should work,
copy the config file from T: to S: in the shell script, but this 
means if you use AMOSPro without APME, you'll get the last APME
configuration, not the default one.

It won't.

If you DRAW the graphics in the right aspect ratio, you won't see

I don't know if an amiga version exists, but there is something 
called 'cvs' which sits on top of RCS and provides a much better
less tedious interface, particularly if a group of people are working
on a file. If it exists it would be better to interface cvs than rcs. 

And as a general note to anyone doing group projects on unix/windows,
get cvs and use it instead of rcs.

No, not at all. If you have a manual it implies it quite plainly
by simply not talking about it at all. Of course AND and OR are
commands that are in AMOS and they are left out of the manual so
logically you would have to assume the existence of XOR based on
it NOT being referenced in the manual :).

Other commands that do not appear in my manual... Chip Free, Fast
Free, Squash, UnSquash andI'm sure there are many others yet to
be discovered!

Hello,


Doese anyone know how to make Amos creator support either genesis joystick
buttons or the 2nd mouse button in the joystick port.
I have a library for using genesis game pads, but I dont know how to use
it with AMOS.

This is of course using AMAL.

	Sounds pretty good for a first crack at it. I started a
similar game many years ago using Amiga Basic but temporarily
abandoned it due to the slowness of Amiga Basic. I go AMOS and
have since put that program through 3 or 4 metamorphoses before I
arrived at my present product. Currently it is an entirely 3D RPG
which is totally modular so that I can effortessly tack on or
update the maps and graphics at any point. It is essentially a
large relational database which include graphics, that way I
don't have to continually reinvent the wheel. Once a graphic is
made I can use it anywhere at anytime. I have included a large(an
increasing every day) number of animations as well as the ability
to play huge sound files so that hopefully I can add speach to it
later. The music I have can be different for each map segment so
that the mood is set correctly( I have a friend in Regina making
them for me and he seems to be really skilled at making RPG
music.) In all I have 17 subraces and over 30 subclasses, 50
skills, 20 or so weapon classes, only about 20 spells now and a
meager 40 or so items. All of these are stored relationally 
so that I can continually add to them even after the game is 
released! Each skill, spell , item is meticulously detailed to
add to the adventuring atmosphere, you can virtually tailor-make
you characters to make thousands of significantly different
character types which I might add are not hard to create in the
game( about 6 clicks or so). The player screen includes a page
where you can see the equipment actually on the body of your
character and this is where you do all your equipment actions.
everything is point and click, unless I need the characters to
type a certain word or type in the characters name for
generation, the keyboard does not have to be touched. All in all
I think it's a pretty good RPG... If only I could stop myself
from continually adding features then I maight actually release
it. Seriously though once the combat for the game gets fixed I
will be giving it to the beta testers that volunteered a while
back and it should (barring unforseen massive bugs) be out very
soon.

			Robert Currie

P.S. Let me know when you release yours. I always love to play
new RPG games.

Look on the AMOSPro_Productivity1 Disk in the Equates directory it's 
under the filename: Editor_Commands.Doc

Actually due to the very powerful script language that I have
written for the game, I hope to make the game much more than a
hack and slash. With the script language I can customise each and
every encounter or trap so that it requires true role-playing to
reach the end of each quest. I will avoid railroading by having
several alternate routes planned and available for the characters
to explore. My goal is to have as open an evironment as possible,
so much that the players do not detect manipulation. Also most of
the skills and abilities come into play without the slightest
effort of the player. If a hallway is sloping downwards and you
have a player with mining skill, he or she will helpfully chime
in informing the player of this event(of course this will only
happen once so that it does not become annoying :) ) Anyways I'm
sure you can see how excited I am that I should be able to
release it soon, it's too bad you are too busy.

It works fine on my WB2.x and WB3.x with no problems (with AmosPro)
It was the Amiga Computing coverdisk version... but that wasn't without
it's problems, I had to send it back 'cos it was corrupt :( Amos3D *had*

I`m using AMOS to writing programable graphical presentations for TV 
studio (teletext,quiz, timer, wheather report, etc).
My problem (I thing,not only my)is : 

To display screen from AMOS (Pro and Creator)programs using genlock ,I 
must always connect external synchro - signal source (from camera or 
video) , otherwise only colour 0 is displayed on monitor (contected 
via genlock to Amiga). Is not e big problem because in tv studio 
always we can to get external syncho source, but problem ... 
 I`m searching in AMOS Cooper list, but all looks OK (genlock bit is 
set) , so where is solution ?!
Other programs(like Scala, DPaint etc) works fine with my genlock.

FYI AMIGA+GENLOCK (AX-PRO)+Amos is most popular configuration in 
polish little TV and CaTV stations

  On the contrary - just do "put file.txt file.readme" and it'll store the

I don't know why you'd get in trouble. I personally like to hear about

I too, have been trying to get rid of the annoying screen flash when 
the compiled program starts:

I had a go at using "Send AMOS to back on booting", with "Create 
Default Screen" turned off and so long as the "Amos To Front" command 
is called after the first screen is opened, the flashing no longer 
occurs. However, now I get a white hollow rectangle spanning the 
width of the visible display (not the screen) at the top of the 
display about 10 pixels deep. This flashes on and then disappears, 
but makes the startup look quite unprofessional. (I setup my screen at 
startup with all colours on screen set to black).

In short, what appears to be a blank menu bar, appears just after the 
Amos To Front command, and then disappears - I do not use any menus
or menu commands in my program.

Any ideas?

Cheers,

Mark

Why not use my anim2bob converter.
The latest version (now under beta testing - to be released in a week) now
handles anims, single iff's and Imagine 3D files.
It's automatically finds the smallest area to grab the graphic, useful if
you keep running low on memory.

  In the strictest sense, no.  However, you can return values from a
proceudre:

Procedure _MIN[A,B]
    If A<B
	RET=A
    Else
	RET=B
    End If
End Proc[RET]
..
_MIN[X1,X2] : X0=Param

and similarly for floats and strings.

>	2/ Does AMOS or AMOS Pro support structures/records?

  Not directly.  I believe Paul Hickman's Easylife extension has some
support for them, though.

I have also had the same problem. I fist thought it was working. Now I know
it doesn't. 
I've run snoopdos (now that is a neat program-don't know how I did without
it) and it doesn't seem to copy the files to the S: or T: directories. 
Perhaps we should make a standalone (compiled) program in amos that would
do it. The source is in APME, so all we really have to do is convert it.

The only problem I've had is that when using radio buttons, you can

solutions?

	I have recently been put off programming in AMOS because of the need
to resort to "bad" or "unnecessarily long" programming.
	What I want to know is:

        One line functions which AMOS supports is not very useful.  
        Here is a C/C++ example to clarify what I'm talking about:

	int NAND(int x,int y) 
        {    if (x==1 && y==1)
                 return 0;
             else
                 return 1;
        }

	Or in Ada:

        function NAND(x: integer; y: integer) return integer is
        begin
            if x=1 and y=1 then
                return 0;
            else
                return 1;
            end if;
        end;

        Even though the NAND function can be achieved in AMOS with
not(x and y), that is not my point, as you can see, having functions with
mulitple statements which can be used in expression is a powerful tool.

	I needed something like this when I was working on my game in AMOS
recently, but I have almost lost faith in AMOS because of it's lack of
function support.

	2/ Does AMOS or AMOS Pro support structures/records?

	This is something else which I needed for my game.  It can prove
extremely useful when keeping track of players etc...  Without these,
programming becomes messy and it is hard to keep track of all tho
