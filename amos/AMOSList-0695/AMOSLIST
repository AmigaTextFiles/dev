	I know I have to use the execute function of AmigaDOS, but:

 - as already written I need to finish this work under Amos classic (not Pro, I don't have any EXEC command!)

 - I don't know exactly how to do that, Ive tried something (looking the example in the extras disk), but it doesn't work at all...

	Can someone tell me something AFTER a test? Try if you can



		Thankx a lot.

But that about 1.2/1.3 - these functions won't be there. What about

  The calling format is Execute(command,input,output):

  - 'command' is a NULL-terminated string containing the CLI command.  In
other words, CMD$="myprog param1 param2..."+Chr$(0).  Pass in D1.

  - 'input' is a DOS filehandle for the program to read input from, or 0
for NIL:.  Pass in D2.

  - 'output' is a DOS filehandle for the program's output.  Pass in D3.

  So you could use:

CMD$="next_program_in_chain"+Chr$(0)
Dreg(1)=Varptr(CMD$)
Dreg(2)=0
Dreg(3)=0
DUMMY=Doscall(-222)
End

Unfortunately it doesn't work exactly the way you describe. The program 
you mention runs the other program. It returns to Amos as soon as it has 
failed or managed to start. This means you have no control over the other 
program anymore (you won't know if and when it has stopped). I tried to 
use this program to build a Wasp interface, but it gurud the machine.

Subject: Phantom Collisions
Status: RO
X-Status: 


I sent this 2 days ago but didin't see it on the listserv.  My apologies if you 
get it twice:
You start something simple and all hell breaks loose.  I began to write a 
'colorforms' type program where kids could arrange a bunch of bobs on a 
background.  My first step was to flesh out a routine to detect bobs with the 
mouse and drag them if a mouse key was depressed.  I began getting collisions 
with transparent portions of my bobs--but only to the left of the body.  I 
decided to test this rigorously and used a cross pattern for the bob (+) 
~100x100 and small boxes for the sprite. A 1X1 sprite worked as advertised with 
collisions taking place only when actual overlap occured.  However a 2X2 sprite 
collided with the cross about 12 pixels too early when approached from the left-
-but correctly when approached from the right. You can sneak into the left 
quadrant of the cross by moving the mouse down into the quadrant a few pixels 
left of the upright arm without collision.  However when you then move the 
mouse left (away from the cross) it snags something invisible and a collision 
occurs.  Using larger sprite images changes the number of pixels between the 
images where collisions occur--until you use a sprite 32X32 whereupon the 
routine functions correctly again!!!  I haven't tried multicolored sprites yet 
or other screen modes--I'm assuming that I can work around this problem when I 
get to my actual images.

I'm curious whether this behavior can be reproduced.  You might keep this in 
mind if you keep getting killed in a shoot-em -up when nothing has actually hit 
you.  It seems someone took some shortcuts in the collision detection routines.

I had posted a few of these in a program to do all types of things, OS
version, processor type, FFP, etc.
If enought people are interested, I'll repost it, or you can find it under
the last (I think) archive of this list on aminet.

Hi all.
  I hope someone can help me with this!! First off, I have a 500, KS2.04,
1 meg chip, 4 meg fast, AMOS Pro 2.0, and AMOS Pro Compiler.
  My problem is this: I have a program that is about 25K (source). It
runs fine from the editor, but it won't compile. It gets to around 20%
and freezes (just AMOS. WB and other prgs still running). I've tried 
various options on and off (include lib, long, etc.). Other programs
will still compile fine. Also tried it from shell. I've tried starting
a new file and adding chunks of code, but it doesn't freeze on the same
chunk of code each time. The program doesn't have many global variables,
no fancy gfx functions, doesn't use any extensions that didn't come with
AMOS. Mosty it does a lot of bank data examining/changing (Peek,Deek,
Poke,Doke). Thats all the info I can think of. This is really driving
me crazy, so I hope someone can shed some light on this!

Thanks!!

Easylife has a function =Elcompiled which will return TRUE if the 
program is compiled. When you use these functions in a program you
intend to compile, or release to the public as source code, put:

	If Not Elcompiled Then ....

In front of such commands so that if others compiled them, they will 
work. The compiler extension probably was a similar funcition, but 
thats not a whole lot of use to those who have not bought the 
compiler.

It would probably be of use if someone who does have the compiler (I 
don't) would post a list of exactly which AMOSPro commands won't 
work.

Dunno if AMOS Pro compiler shares code with AMOS Classic compiler,
but setting element 116 of any array will crash the compiler during
compilation:

e.g.    VAR(116)=23

You might be doing this...  (On the other hand, the compilers are
riddled with bugs and you've probably just found another one)

PS  Is there *ever* going to be another version released of the AMOS
Classic compiler???

Of course, your wonderful program is included in the following archive

AMOSList-0395.lzh    dev/amos   100K+Messages about AMOS during March 1995

(in Aminet, of course)

BTW, some people are posting very interesting routines, programs and tricks.
I think it is a good idea to include them in the AMOS Web Site (Andy?) or/and
in the library of AMOS procedures ProcLib3.0 (Anyone is updating it?).

Sorry, but that doesn't help. (Itried it).  As a matter of fact I can turn 
double buffer OFF and still see the same effect. (which means everything is 
happening on 1 screen).  Remember the bob is stationary and I can move the 
sprite slow enough so that there's no way its position can be that far ahead of 
where I can see it (were talking about a >12 pixel discrepency--which gets 
smaller as the size of the sprite increases!).  Also doesn't explain why 
routine works for 1 pixel sprite!  It seems like the MASK  of bob 2 has been 
corrupted somehow and that corruption is based on the size of the image 
preceding it in the bank and that there's a shadow of the vertical line of bob 
2 12 pixels to the left--but any portion of the bob that touches its left 
boundary is not shadowed any further to the left i.e. collisions to the 
horizontal line work normally.

 Did the fix work on your syestem? Are collision detections wired into Agnes or 
the ROM?  Could this be a bug in wb1.3?    Joe Zaccardi

Joseph,

	Perhaps the fact that amos stores it graphics like bobs, icons and such
in 16 pixel chunks, might be your problem. The bob itself knows that it is only
2x2 but in effect it is stored as 16x2 in the bank. This would explain why it
allows you to get closer and closer when you increase the width of your bobs. The effect should only be seen on the right hand side and only horizontally if this is the actual problem. Try pasting your bobs without the mask on,and you will
see that they are in fact a multiple of 16 pixels wide. Hopefully, even if this

First:
Are you poking directly into strings?
Do you use data banks?
Do you use Data lines?
Do you use Text Length?
Have you used Set Buffer, and how high did you set it?


Suggestions:
Try to save it as ascii (open all procedures before doing this), then
reset your computer and merge it again.
It could be that you've destroyed some internal bank data directly in
front of the actual bank. Try to save each data bank indivually as
binary (e.g with Bsave), and then reload them again into memory
(after you have resetted your machine, just to be sure).

  I haven't been doing much with it, primarily because of lack of others'
interest (the last thing I was sent was sometime last October, I think).
I've grabbed a few things from the list recently, and now that I'm done
with school (finally!) I may have time to update the library.

I havn't changed whatever the default is.

I'll give the saving and merging a try.

I've found that if the first thing I do when I turn on the computer
(not just a reset) and use the compile from disk instead of the
current program in the editor, it will work most of the time. So, I'm
not quite as distraught as I was, but it still bugs me!

Thanks to you and the rest that replied!!

It opens an 'AGA' screen so you can draw hires pics in it. It is a hack,
but it does show that amos is capable of AGA extensions. Perhaps I'll write

Priority: normal
X-Mailer: Pegasus Mail/Windows (v1.22)
Status: RO
X-Status: 


Prompted by Darryl Lewis' question about adding items to the user 
menu, I have been working on a program to do this, and make the other 
modifications to the editor configuration necessary to install all 
the easylife accessories automatically. In this file is my prototype 
version. 

I am posting it here in the hope that some of you nice people will 
test it - it doesn't matter if you already have the easylife 
accessories installed - it is supposed to cope with that. What 
happens is you load AMOSPro and run this program, and it generates a 
file "Easylife_Config" in your APSystem dir, which is your default 
configuration with the easylife accessories added to the search,user 
& help menus. Load this using "Load Configuration" from the config 
menu.

Then E-Mail me to let me know if it did or did not work. If it 
didn't, please include a uuencoded copy of your AMOSPro_Editor_Config 
file. I am particular interested it hear from people who have the 
AMOSPro compiler installed, and people not using AMOSPro V2.00.

NOTE: This program assumes the easylife accessory programs are in the
AMOSPro_Accessories: drawer. If they are not, modify the variable 
ACC$.

The idea of this program is that when finished, it will make a backup 
of your editor config, then overwrite it  and end with a "system" 
instruction. Then it will be called from the installer script to make 
installation completely automatic (I already have another  program to 
install the easylife extension itself, which is just a hacked version 
of the AMOSPro Interpreter_Config.AMOS program which doesn't bother 
with the dialogs)

Please let me know if this does/doesn't work - if it does It will be 
useful for anyone (such as Darryl) who is writting accessory programs.
The same set of routines can also be used to create a utility for 
sorting the items on the user menu. (Which will be in the next 
Easylife release if things go well).

  To fix that, you have to use the Set Stack command of AMOS Pro at the
beginning of your program.  Try "Set Stack 64" or some large number.  (It
has nothing to do with the "Stack size" field in the icon information; it
changes the size of the internal stack AMOS uses for procedure calls and
such.)

Hey Chris,
          First off, thanks for the STDIN help.  There is a problem with the
new procedure, though.  It works ok if I am in a cli or if the bbs is running
the prg locally, but it will not accept any input from a remote user.

I'm using the routines in an olg.

If AMOS wasn't so stupid about things, I'd be using the serial port commands,
which will grab one character and go on.

input(2,1) will not grab a character until there is a return mark at the end of
input.  Your routine worked, but not for remote.  Any ideas?

Well met and godspeed,
                      Giark

Im really sorry to bother you all, but does anyone know how to solve the
 'out of stack space error' ? Changing the stack in icon information does not
work. Many thanks. MXAZTURVEYA@UNL.AC.UK

Changing the icon stack size should work if you run AMOS(Pro) from 
the workbench. If you run it from the CLI / Startup Sequence, run the
command 'Stack=NEWSIZE' first.

What is causing your error -the only time I've encountered it is from 
recursive procedures, which in AMOS are a bad idea.

Why don't we all compile a list off all the extensions available and a
description of what they do and what they are good for. for example I just
found out that there is a VIRUS extension available that lets you detect
viruses from amos.

PS, any of our German readers feel like translating the JD extension

Here it is, the demo beta version.
Fixed from the first version, it now displays an image as it is converting

fair bit to the conversion time, but at least it is more visually
interesting.

I'm still waiting to see if Andy Church and Paul Reece will send me their
exetensions. If so I'll post the registered version to the list for all to
use.

There is an extension list in the FAQ of this mailing list (which 
never seems to get posted). It is on Andy Church's WWW site I 
believe.

Now that things are looking up for the Amiga, we need to make the Amiga 
as appealing as possible- by means of bundling good software with it 
(this is important in the US, and "game-paks" don't sell well here)
 
We know MicroSoft AmigaBasic sucked.  We need to replace it. AmigaVision 
is nice, but ESCOM should approach Mr. Lionet/Jawks/EuroPress/etc. about 
bundling it with the forthcoming Amigas.  This would make it an Amiga 
standard, and encourage them to finally totally debug it.
 
I've heard quips about AMOS being ported to the Wintel clones.  But it 
will never be a standard on that platform.  They don't stand a chance!  
MS VisualBasic has the market, and AMOS/IBMOS won't ever change that.
 
So being bundled with Amigas not only helps the Amiga, and us, it also 
would help Lionet & Co.
 
The question is, who do we lobby to accomplish this?  
 
What about Lionet/Jawks/EuroPress/etc selling AMOS to ESCOM for further 
internal development?  God knows, they can't do any worse than the 
bug-riggen software Lionet/Jawks/EuroPress/etc has been writing.
 
I think these are things we should press for via an email lobbying campaign.

Could be some memory corruption or virus in your system. What tools

A very up-to-date list is in every mailing list archive on AmiNet.

This is a list which should be rather up to date (with a few
execeptions).

5)  What extension slots are being used?

Erm, considering AMOS is about the least amiga OS compliant language 
availble on the machine, it would be just about the last choice for 
the "standard amgia language". I'm all for new versions of AMOS, but 
frankly there is not a hope in hell of selling it this way. What it 
really needs is an object oriented encapsulation of the OS libraries, 
maybe in C++, maybe in some Visual Basic/TCL style language.

I would be suprised if the opposite happened, and they tried to port 
VB, or something similar to the amiga. (Although Microsoft would 
never be bothered to do this, they do now seem to be granting a lot 
of 3rd partly licences to port thier software to other machines).

Here's a better idea - everyone E-Mail the BBC, and ask them not to

Hi all,
   I lost the name of the person who told me that JD lib needed fast  
ram to work.  Thankyou who ever you are.  I managed to get it to work with 
2MB chip and no fast.  If anyone else is having problems the solution is 
to get a copy of RUNIT, sorry but I dont now who wrote it or where you 
can get it.  I got mine from a mag cover.  If you are interested I can send a 
copy. Then execute RUNIT with the halffast option.  The machine will 
re-boot and as if by magic I now have 1MB chip and 1MB fast.  Plus AMOS with JD 
works.

On to another extension, Easylife.  H-E-L-P !!!!!  I dont know if I 
have a test version or what but its accessory's either do strange things 
to my system or wont work.  I have Amos-Pro v1.12 running on a 1200.  I 
am trying to get to grips with the structure commands but the 
struct_compiler wont work.  I tried a few of the other accessories and they all seem 
to work sometimes but more often than not they dont.  Generally when 
they fail I get a bad syntax error on the NULL=Dialog Run(1).  Im not hot with 
the interface language but I assume it is set-up and executed in the same 
manner  as AMAL.  Therefore the error must be in the definition.  Has anybody 
else had the same problem and if so how did you rectify it.  Secondly has 
anyone mangaged to get the replacement Search/Replace menu items to work.  
Every time I try to use search it moves the cursor to the top of the 
listing. If I then do a search next nothing happens.

If you can help with any of this or can tell me where I can get hold 
of the most up-to-date version of Easylife (FTP if poss.) please help.

Steve,

I had not such wicked problems with the serial commands, but I only
used them once for one program.

Please send me the part of the program and I'll see what can be

At the moment I haven't got one idea, why this doesn't work
correctly.

that these are also available off the web site, URL below (the links

Is this version PD? I think the version placed in Aminet and the AMOS site is
4.6, which doesn't has any english document (only german)

It is run like AMAL. I have had a few reports of the extensions not 
working due to bank not reserved errors on bank 12, and AmosGuide 
isn't the most reliable piece of software I've written (New version 
out soon which is a little more stable, and has a MS Windows Help 
style history list), but this is the first time I've heard of 
problems with the interfaces.

It could be AMOSPro V1.12 - Could anyone who *has* successfully used 
easylife with V1.12 let me know so I can eliminate that from the list 
of possibilities.

>  Has anybody

Not that they have told me about. Have you installed the new default 
resource bank that was supplied with easylife into the APSystem 
directory - some the accessories use images that were not in the 
original.

Make sure you have put the correct keywords on the command line for 
each menu item. You could also try the auto config program I posted a 
few days back (Please test this for me folks).

Andy's AMOS FTP/WWW site, or /dev/amos on any aminet mirror.
AS andy said there are 3 files + a patch file. (Well, actually some 
new versions of the accessories & extension to copy over the existing 
ones).

YUCK.The phrase "What idiot wrote this?" springs to mind. And the 
answer "Someone who doesn't have any other extensions" closely 
follows...

Sounds like the author either:

a) Doesn't understand that there is no need to 
splitup extensions because only those routines actually used are 
compiled into compiled programs, and it doesn't make a difference to 
interpreted programs.

b) Is trying to be kind to users with low memory so they can only 
install the parts of the extension they need, an fowling things up 
for everyone else.

c) Is just plain awkward.

Mind you, the person (We all know who) who come up with numbered 
extensions in the first place was asking for it...

I have 1.12 (I think: It is the coverdisk version) and have had no such 
problems. The only problem I encountered was the bank not reserved error 
Paul mentions.
Have you (the original poster) tried to get the structured programming 
examples to work?

Because AMOS has a limited stack depth (57 calls by default- Change 
it was set stack in AMOS Pro - fixed in AMOS1.36), and 
since most recursion can be converted to a more efficient  loop, 
there isn't much point. I even wrote quicksort (The most famous 
recursive program in the world)  iteratively in AMOS!
(It's in the procedure library on aminet, and sorts 2500 elements of 
8 arrays & banks in 30 secs. on my A1200)

P.s. For those who are wondering what recusion is, it is a procdure 
or subroutine that calls itself. E.g The factorial of a number could
be calculated:

In Miranda (A functional lanugage designed for this sort of thing):
	fac 1 = 0
	fac n = n * (fac n-1) 

In AMOS:
	Procedure FAC[n]
		If n=0
			r=1
		Else
			FAC[n-1]
			r=param*n
		End If
	End Proc[r]

Of couse anyone in their right mind would write:

	Procuedure FAC[n]
		r=1
		For a= 2 To n
			r=r*a
		Next
	End Proc[r]

Hi there.

Well, just answer the question :-). Since Europress has dropped all support,
does that mean also they've stopped selling the program? It's kinda hard
to obtain a Pro-program here in the Netherlands. If some kind soul can
supply me with an address, I'll be very happy indeed :-).

No!!! Please DON'T! Lionet is a very bad programmer and should not
write any more programs on amiga computers. The Amiga has an very
open architecture and M. Lionet has not understood this yet. He
should try to keep his programs on PC Clones, where he again is

Sorry, but I cannot welcome this idea. Let's go for a completely new
basic *compiler* based on the amiga os and without any hardware
hacking probably written in C to port it to RISC Amigas easily.
However, many commands from AMOS could be taken as good examples for
a easy-to-learn basic.

There's no point on only debugging it. AMOS doesn't work with
Gfx-cards and does not support a single AGA resolution. Moreover, not
even the ECS Dual Playfield is handled correctly. The whole AMOS core
code has to be rewritten and that would mean, that rewriting it from
scratch would be less work.

Half a year ago, Franois Lionet and Yves Lamoureux wrote Klik &
Play, some Windoze programming 'language'. All you have to do is to
place some predrawn graphics on the playfield and give them some
attributes and movement patterns. Very limited and (the version I saw
was) very buggy.

No. Please abolish AMOS and go for a new Basic Compiler...

Only from the lame Software Society. But I think I will spread the
*update* over AmiNet soon. Or better I'll send it to Andy Church,
it's only 110 KB.

Updating is only possible from the original AMOS Creator Tome 3.10,
Tome 4.23 and Tome 4.24 versions.

Yes it is. And this version also comes with the german docs but one
file contains
english descriptions. The coder Joerg Dommermuth can be emailed at

I'll ask him to join the mailing list. ;-)

Yeah... I for myself had similar problems... first, AMCAF was on slot
18 and after I heard, that it was used by craft already, I moved it
to 16. A few months ago, I saw, that easylife uses the same slot. So
I decided to put it to slot 8 for overseas.

Yeah... perhaps because the main extension has become to big.

When I started AMCAF, I asked Europress for a free number and got no
reply. So I went for slot 18, as Thomas Noelker got for his intuition
extension slot 17 reserved from Europress.

wing problem
I have writen my first amos prog called RadarRatRun.
I can get it to run from floppy disc ok by assigning
maze to RadarRatRun:maze/maze1.
What I want to do is make it possible to move the game
to hard drive but how do I make it look in the curent
directory for its maze.
I know I can assign RadarRatRun to dh0:
but I want it to look in the directory the game is in

PS  to Paul Hickmam I have tried your
auto.config program on my system of AMOSPro V2.00
with compiler and it works like a dream. The only slight 
undocumented feature I can find is when I select
from the user menu ADD OPTION a requester comes up
saying   Delete User Option  This is not a 'User' option.
So this means I can't add any other items to the user menu.

  And it'll be on the web site as soon as I can get the LZX dearchiver and

  This I can believe, because of that stupid 32k limit on extension code
size (due to you-know-who), although why he split it up into 5 extensions I
have no idea...

If the game is on harddrive, the user will no doubt enter your current
directory (ie "RadarRatRun") to play the game. Therefore you will already 
be in the current directory. So in your program you need only reference 
the subdirectories you need to access, and the actually volumes can be 
ignored. For example, you have in your program: Load "maze/maze1" -- and 
this will search for a maze directory in your current directory.

I hope this is clear. I have programmed a game that works equally well on 
floppy and HD, so I know the problem you're talking about. Email if I 
haven't made myself clear enough :)

Yesterday, some other user (in fact, an AMCAF User) called me, having

I'll try to check that problem with a null-modem cable connected to

Well, I'd like to see the routine you use and how :-)

I suggest avoiding assigns. These are only annoying for the hard disk
users and a look in the current directory would do the same...

Just don't use a pathname... use

"maze/maze1" instead of "RadarRatRun:maze/maze1"

or if the user only starts the game from workbench use:

"PROGDIR:maze/maze1"

PROGDIR: is a local assign for each program started from Workbench
since Kick 2.0+. From CLI, however, PROGDIR: is non-existant.

Hi everybody,

    I have just started teaching myself about vector gfx and have one 
big problem, SPEED, or lack of it.  I have plans for a game, 3d wireframe
graphics with hidden line removal.  Can anyone give me advice on 
speeding things up or should I learn C or Assembly ?
I have 1200 with AMOSPro V1.12, extensions: Easylife V1.10, TURBO

Look out for my Football League program, coming soon!

In advance thanks,

Try to compile your routine with Pro Compiler. If that doesn't speed 
things up enough, learn Assembly. =)

Also get fastmem if you don't have one...and using asm WITH AmosPro
is great way to speedup you program...(asm Procedures...)

Hi there !
I'm creating a Monopoly-game in AMOS Pro which I'm, so far, very proud of.
But there seems to be a problem I can't handle:
From the begining all streets are grey. When a player buys a street, I want=
=20
it to change colour into the same as the player's colour.
So I simply tried to fill the area with that colour. Since the bobs are not=
=20
part of the background picture I thought that it would fill under the bob,=20
but it left an unfilled rectangle surrounding the bob (the same size as the=
=20
bob in the Object Editor).
Then I moved the bob away from the street, filling it and moved it back,=20
this gave the same result.
My final solution was to make a bob instead of using the fill command. So I=
=20
moved the player's bob away from the street, pasted the "coloured street"=20
bob on the background and then moved the bob back again, surprisingly this=20
also gave the same result.
I suppose this have something to do with the bob's mask or something like=20
that.
I hope that someone knows the answer to this so my programming can=20
continue...

MusiCRAFT is a small extension provided with CRAFT. It includes commands to
play ST/NT/PT modules, enabling some voice....

   
This extension is not necessary if you own AMOS Pro. Commands to play ST 
modules are provided with it.

Yes, you've got to set the bob's mask. Look in the manual or any 
hypertext version thereof how to do it.

It is a program I posted to the list UUEncoded about a week ago which 
automatically installed the easylife extension & all its accessories 
into AMOSPro, to save you having to manually add each one to the 
AMOSPro editor. I'd like people to test it to check it doesn't 
destroy anything.

COULD SOMEONE WITH AMOSPRO V1.12 PLEASE TEST IT SOON,
AND E-MAIL TO LET ME KNOW IF IT WORKS. I'm hoping to release 
a new version of easylife soon, and I'd like to know this works. 
Also, one person has said it makes the Add option on the menu menu 
fail to work. Has anyone else had such problems?

Try turning of Bob Update, calling Bob Clear before filling to remove 
the bobs, then calling Bob Draw to redraw them. If you don't wan't to 
handle bob updates manually throughout the program, just turn the 
automatic Bob Update back on again afterwards.

P.s. One idea for your game - put all the place names text file, so 
people can write in their counties monopoly places - maybe even 
distribute a few with the game - how about monopoly with internet 
sites! Suggestions anyone?

You should have MusiCRAFT too, if the CRAFT is not pirate one?

The main difference between MusiCRAFT and AMOS Pro ST instruction is that
you can disable some music channels and play samples there and enable them
again. This ensures that you can play samples without any trash noises during
module playing.

3D, eh.  It's slow even on a 486 if done with none of the stops pulled.  
To speed it up you have to take lots of shortcuts and if you use floating 
point get rid of it NOW.  Finally to get speed you will want to use C or 
assemler to do the graphics, particulrly the drawing.  The line drawing 
function of the blitter may be helpful as well.

Depends on how long I leave it, but don't expect too much yet - it 
will mostly be bug fixes for the accessory programs. AMOS guide now 
has menu shortcuts, and a history list similar to (well, ripped off from) 
MS Windows help. It is like a file selector with the titles of all 
the pages you have visited, and you can select one to either jump to 
it, or retrace back to it (retracing removes pages you have visited 
from the history list).

Not yet - XPK has a decidedly weird way of writing to files if you 
don't want to just write one continous block of memory. What I might 
do is hack around the problem - write a procedure that stores all 
your bobs in a normal Chip Work bank, then Elxpk Saves it. Then 
another procedure which generates a sprite bank from the work bank by 
puting pointers to the images in the work bank in the sprite bank. 
This means you won't be able to add/remove sprites from the bank, as 
it will corrupt the memory but at elast you will be able to write the 
program then compact its images afterwards.

[ memory fragmentation after loading and freeing multiple music files ]

  Unless you're playing around with screens and stuff, you shouldn't be
getting fragmentation.  If you have, say, a 400k block of chip memory free,
then loading the intro music will take up the first 350k of that.  Then,
when you free the music memory, you're back to the 400k block again.
However, if you open a screen (for example; in general, anything that takes
up chip memory) before freeing the music memory, you've just fragmented
that 400k block.  If you make sure you open all your screens before loading
any music, you shouldn't run into problems.

  (BTW, did I already mention I'd like to playtest this?  If not, then I
do.)

Subject: Music help

X-Status: 

	One of the aspects of my new game (which I will be sending to a few of
you shortly for playtesting) is the ability to have multiple music files. These
would be loaded and played at specific times in the game(such as when you enter
into a dungeon, mone dungeon-like music is played). The trouble I am having is
with memory fragmentation. My main into song is approximately 350K in size,
wherease some of my other songs are 150K - 250K so when the main song gets 
replaced by a new song, the memory allocated to the old song get broken into
smaller chunks and after a couple of loads of music, Amos cannot find a large
enough chunk of memory to load the main music file(the 350K one). I am trying to
find a way around this. One possibility is for all the music files to be padded
to the exact same length, but this is wasteful with respect to disk storage. What I really want to be able to do is to allocate the music bank at a certain sizeand then load the music into the bank without Amos reallocating memory(there
would obviously be unused space for some of the music files). Unfortunately it
seems that when amos loads a music bank, it automatically deallocated the bank,
places the memory on the stack, allocates a new bank of exactly the size needed
and loads the music bank into that area of memory, thereby fragmenting the
memory. Is there any way around this? How is the music bank structured as far
as the header is concerned? I have taken a look at the conversion routine and
it seems fairly complicated( I would almost have to create my own music bank
format to store the pointer offsets with the music and then use those pointer
offsets by pokeing them into the bank header!) Is there a n easier way?

I am currently using Amos creator v 1.3x with the music extension that it comes
with. Someone please help me!

  No, that's not how it works at all.  Think of the Amiga's memory as a
long row of boxes, each of which can be empty (unallocated memory) or have
a marble in it (allocated).  To use the same example as above, you start
with 400k of those in a row, all empty.  When you allocate 350k for the
intro module, you fill the first 350k boxes, and the remaining 50k are
empty.  Then, when you free the music module (deallocate the memory), you
take the marbles out of the 350k full boxes, and you're once again left
with 400k consecutive empty boxes.  At no time do any of the boxes move
around, as you suggested memory being "dumped on the stack".  The stack is
a separate region of memory used for storing return addresses, saving
CPU registers, etc.

  So... I have no idea why you get that fragmentation problem. <shrug>  If
I had your code, I might be able to determine more.  Maybe it's (yet
another!) bug in AMOS.

	But isn't what happens when you use any chunk of memory on the Amiga,
is that it first looks on the stac 
k and sees if there is any chunk large enough to fit what you require. If there
is then it divides that memory chunk into what you need and what is left over
(unless it is exactly the size you need). So if I loaded a 350K music bank,
Amos would look on the stack and say it found a 400k chunk, then it would assign350k to the bank and put the extra 50k back on the stack. Then lets say I load
a 250k music bank, the 350k gets put back onto the stack, the memory manager 
looks for a 250k chunk and finds a 350k chunk which it takes 250k of and dumps
100k onto the stack...thereby fragmenting it. All my graphics and such are beingdeclared at the beginning of my program except for the music because they are
all of different lengths. Therefor I am left with my problem.

	If this isn't the way it works then please let me know how exactly it
does work because this seems to be my only major problem right now.

I've got a different type of solution. I'm not sure what sort of music 
you've got in your game, but if you use similar samples in the different 
music modules, perhaps you could combine them into one module, and then 
in your game simply start the music playing at different points in the 
play sequence.

I'm not sure if you can do this in Amos, but you can do it with Paul 
Reece's EME.

A nice hack, but not really practical when the modules are 150-350K 
each, unless there are a lot of shared samples. Another soluition 
which may work:
	
	Reserve a work  bank the size of your largest module at the start of 
	the game.

	When you load any module, free this memory, then load the module

	When the music stops, free the bank, and re-reserve the work bank.

In this way, you force all other memory allocations not to fragment 
the block, unless they are made whilst the music is playing. It may 
also help whe you load the module to reserve a work bank which is the 
size of the difference between the module loaded & the largest model, 
but there is no garuntee that this will be allocated immediately 
following the music bank.

The best solution is to hack the bank load code - the source code 
for the music extension is provided with AMOS. Look for where it 
allocates the memory for the bank, then make a version which uses
preallocated memory.

  Make sure it's "Chip Work" as the modules are always loaded into chip RAM.

> [ memory fragmentation after loading and freeing multiple music files ]

To avoid fragmentation, load small stuff before the big stuff, and, if 
you can, keep the small stuff in memory or reuse it (withOUT 
deallocating).  This keeps the rest of memory free for your music to load 
in and out.

Memory fragmentation happens when some small allocated area sits between 
two blocks of memory, splitting the maximum available size in half.

Like:
            200K - free
	    56K  - alloc
	    256K - free

If this is your chip memory, you just lost the ability to load anything 
>256K into chip until the 56K allocation goes away.  This would be easy 
to do.  The following code would cause the above fragment to occur:

	reserve as chip data 1,200*1024
	reserve as chip data 2,56*1024
	...some code...
	erase 1

Hopefully, if you know what causes fragmentation, you can write your code 
to avoid it:

	reserve as chip data 2,56*1024
	reserve as chip data 1,200*1024
	...some code...
	erase 1

The second example will not fragment memory.  Another way to avoid 
fragmentation is to approach your memory allocation like you would a 
stack (the first thing allocated is the last thing deallocated).  The 
closer you get to this kind of setup, the less fragmentation you'll get.

In short: Allocate first the memory areas that change the least (by change
I mean change of allocation, by deallocating and reallocating.) ie: fonts,
player sprites, etc.  Allocate transient memory areas (constant
allocation/deallocation as in the case of music tracks) last.  This 
avoids fragmentation.

AMOS has a _few_ bugs? This has to be the understatement of the decade. AMOS'
strongpoint is indeed the ease with which you can program. But you pay a
price: weird, illogical bugs; no system-conform programming; relatively slow
in comparison with C; compiled programs are big; etc. etc. I mostly use AMOS
for quick&dirty little programs like conversion utilities or routine testing,
when I want results in minutes, not days.

Well, some of the keywords need an overhaul. For example, can someone explain
to me how the Rainbow-command works? I've tried to master its use ever since I
got AMOS (in 1991), but to regret of my little sister, I still can't get the
effect _she_ wants. Answers in 1.36-compatible format (or ASCII), please.

Putting AMOS-commands in include-files won't do you any good. You need
to design those commands in C or assembly, just what Lionet has done five years
ago. You still need to learn C, and you require a C-compiler. A C-compiler is
pretty expensive (or needs huge amounts of space and RAM), and why would you
want to make a hybrid C program with AMOS commands when you can do the entire
thing in AMOS? What I would like is a real AMOS-compiler, so you could _link_
your C-modules with AMOS ones.

Get in touch with Escom (or AmigaTech, whatever it's called nowadays), and ask
them for support. THEN demand the source code from Europress.

C64 on my hard disk. It uses your 9-pins Epson compatible printer for output
(it _must_ be old, then). It's not exactly environmentally friendly to waste
lots of paper, but if the demand is great enough, I'll write a manual and
distribute it. Anyone for a print :-)?)

Your're quite right with that, but this is not the point. The amiga
exec handles the memory in so called memory lists. Theses hold the
AREAs that are currently FREE (I suppose Daryll meant that with the
actually wrong term 'stack'). If you require memory, exec searches
this list and chops a piece off an existing free memory list. When
you free it, exec just creates another memlist structure, that
contains the (old) memory block. But exec has got mechanisms to aviod
memory fragmentation. E.g it tries to link memory lists together if
possible. As this process takes some time, it's only performed on
actions like _LVOAvailMem or Memory Flushing.

Further, I think AMOS does not free the old memory block of a bank
before reserving the new one, I think, it does it afterwards.

My conclusion for this problem is: Place an 'Erase' instruction and a
'dummy=Chip Free' in front of the loading process. This *could* help.

Moreover, I suggest the use of Protracker Musics, which can be saved
as binary as well (and therefore could be loaded using Bload into an
existing permanent 250 KB block).

I'll try to find another solution... stay tuned. ;-)

...time passes...

Back again!

Try out this procedure! :-)

' First set up the bank using up the most memory 
Reserve As Chip Work 3,200000
' Then load the appropriate music  
_LOADMUSIC["Musik/abks/LostInTime.abk"]
Music 1 : Wait Key : Music Off 
' Load the next... 
_LOADMUSIC["Musik/abks/Mind.abk"]
Music 1 : Wait Key : Music Off 
' and another one. 
_LOADMUSIC["Musik/abks/Thing.abk"]
Music 1 : Wait Key : Music Off 
End 
Procedure _LOADMUSIC[F$]
  Open In 1,F$
    L=Lof(1)-20
    If Length(3)<L Then Stop 
    Pof(1)=20 : Rem don't load abk-header
    Sload 1 To 3,L
  Close 1
  Loke Start(3)-8,$4D757369 : Rem changes the bank name. 
  Erase 999 : Rem forces a Bank-Check call   
End Proc

I hope this solves your problems.

I don't hate Amos, I hate Francois Lionet for failing at making a

I've speed a long time and money on coding with AMOS and /for/ AMOS,

Ugh.  I use it pretty much exactly as you outlined.  I'll try to get a

routine that you put up and then modified for timeout (but I'm not using
timeout routine as it didn't work remote).

If you have an email address, I can send you an archive copy of it, since you
helped with the in/out.

Well met and godspeed,

[ my analogy of memory and marbles ]

[ Chris's description of memory blocks and lists ]

  On the contrary, freed blocks will always be merged into existing blocks
if possible.  If you run a well-behaved program (i.e. one that frees
everything it allocates), then, assuming no other programs are also
allocating memory at the same time, the free list before and after running
the program will be *identical*.

>Further, I think AMOS does not free the old memory block of a bank
>before reserving the new one, I think, it does it afterwards.

  That would be incredibly stupid.  So, given AMOS's programmer, one ought
to expect it. :-/

>My conclusion for this problem is: Place an 'Erase' instruction and a
>'dummy=Chip Free' in front of the loading process. This *could* help.

  The first, yes, if AMOS is as stupid as you suggest.  The second, no.
The only "free" type function that works with is AMOS's Free, which works
only with variables.

  Which would have to be in chip memory, of course, as your routine below
does.

Andy,

   Hello once again!!! I know it has been awhile since I written you, but 
alais I am once again finding some time to get back to coding. (Finally!)

   I am having a slight problem with the Intuition Extension. (Probally 
operator error on my part, but was hoping for some enlightenment!)

   Background:
	Tring to use IRequest Screen, to set-up a new screen of the users
	choice, and then run the application from there. (This is in an
	attempt to be as compatable & as friendly to the users system as
	possible; reguardless of display limitations/enhancements.)
		- My test:
		  Configured with Spectrum EGS system, and run 800x600 WB.
		  Would like my application to open an 800x600/16 color.

   What I tried to do:
	Gather information on the desired screen via IRequest Screen, by
	using the requester. Then taking those same settings (Width, Height,
	Colors, and mode) and opening a screen with IScreen Open.

   Results:
	IScreen Request
		IReq Scr Colour:	16
		IReq Scr Height:	600
		IReq Scr Mode:		4
		IReq Scr Width:		800

	IScreen Open
		Used as taken from requester, line follows:
		IScreen Open 1,800,600,16,4,"Predictions"

	What I see
		The opened screen appears to be a standard 640x400
		screen. (I open a few windows offset, and they get chopped
		off.)

   I know I am missing something, but I can not seem to get the "Plain-
   language" (ie: Hires; Superhires; VGA; ect) screen modes like the ones
   that appear in the requester. (Your requester DOES give the same
   options that I get from the Prefs ScreenMode, so I know that they are
   there and your extension is seeing them.)

   What I would like:
  	To know what I am doing wrong, and to be able to have the user select
	a screenmode, even if it is not one of the "Amiga standards". I have
	also taken a look at the Env Archieve: screenmode.prefs; but do not
	know how to decode, parse, and read the file from AMOSPro. (It is an
 	ILBM Form.) And without a definitive listing of the most commonaly
	used screenmodes, makes it that much harder.

   I appreciate your help!!!

Has anyone considered on working on a AMOS BBS?  To where the software would
truly take advantage of the Amiga???  If this is a "multimedia" computer 
shouldn't there be a "multimedia" bbs for the Amiga? 

I had consider writing one in C but after starting it I got bogged down in
to many minor difficulties with timings and other little things....

Anyways I would like to know what you guys think about a BBS that would 
send IFFs, sound, use pull down menus, look and operate very much like 
the workbench does, and have multiplayer graphic games, (like tank wars 3D!)
something like doom in 3d and multiplayer....

Etc....what do you guys think????

Probably meaning slow, right?  If AMOS is so bad, why are you on this list?

What do you mean by "support"?  Couldn't you just called the Intui=20

Maybe you're right.  AMOS is nice, but perhaps an AMOS compatible,=20

So what the hell are you on this list for, if you despise AMOS so much?

  AMOS does have a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, due to Francois'
incompetence, that's all it is - potential that can never be realized.
The problem in stomping the hardware is that it (a) opens the door for
future problems if the hardware internals change - note that hardware
stomping is specifically discouraged by any style guide I've ever heard
of - and (b) means you can't take advantages of improvements in the
hardware, at least not without a *lot* of difficulty.  The closest any
program should ever get to the hardware is graphics.library calls like
MrgCop() and LoadView(), and even then, you lose some upward compatibility,
although I'll admit that it's sometimes necessary or helpful.

  Because AMOS is preferable to e.g. Blitz (at least from his viewpoint),
and it is excellent for getting things done quickly.  I am an expert C and
assembly language programmer (in my not-so-modest opinion :) ), yet I still
use AMOS quite a bit, because in AMOS, you don't have to worry about all
the little details like setting up Intuition NewScreen structures and such.

  Have you ever tried to open an Intuition screen in AMOS by manually
creating the NewScreen structure and calling OpenScreen()?  You'd have to
agree that it would be much simpler to use a single Iscreen Open command to
do the same thing.  As for AGA support, there is *Intuition* AGA support,
in my Intuition Extension for example, but there is no way to open an AGA
screen on AMOS's custom display.  Among other things, the AMOS screen
structure only has room for six bitplane pointers, not eight.  (The
graphics.library BitMap structure, on the other hand, has had eight
bitplane pointers since the first version of the OS.)

  The ECS "dual playfield" mode allows two playfields (screens) to be
displayed one on top of the other; color-zero pixels in the top playfield
are actually transparent, and pixels from the lower playfield show through
in those locations.

  We *could*, but it wouldn't be worth it.  There are more problems with
AMOS than simply its hardware stomping (I like that term :) ) and bugs.  A
new language with the same fundamental idea (ease of use) would be a much
better idea, and that is in fact what we're working on.  Or what we were
working on, anyway, before school got in the way.  (Pesky thing...)  Hey,
guys, let's get back to work, shall we?

>What has Lionet had to say about the AMiga's rebirth?  Would he consider
>coming back and correcting his software?

  Again, one can't simply "correct" AMOS; there's too much inherently wrong
with it.  It needs to be rewritten or, better yet, replaced.

>So what the hell are you on this list for, if you despise AMOS so much?
>What Basic Compiler do YOU use?

  Hey, watch it!  There's no call for flaming here.  He's simply saying
that AMOS is terribly buggy (which it is) and badly written (which it is),
and should be replaced by another language/compiler that will do the same
job AMOS currently does, which is to make programming simple, yet be
system-friendly and well written.

  Then why did you include Chris's 10-line signature, hmm?  I smell an

  This was Ireq Scr Mode(0), right?

  You need to add the display ID parameter on the end, which can be taken
from Ireq Scr Mode(1).  So:

		Iscreen Open 1,800,600,16,4,"Predictions",Ireq Scr Mode(1)

	There is already in existance a BBS that does all that. It is fully
OS friendly, point and click windows and such. It is called IceBBS. I'm not
sure if you are aware of it, it was created in Calgary, Alberta Canada by
a guuy named Steve Vermeulen. It works extremely well and although there
have not been any graphical multiplayer games attached to it yet, it has
the capability to do so. If anyone wants to know more, send me mail
directly ('cause this really doesn't have much to do with AMOS)

Hello all,

   First I guess I should say sorry about the last message subject. 
(Using Pine locally, and the bug in the To; cc; attach; and Subject 
fields still throw me off!)

   Alright, down to business. Included is a UUEncoded file that displays 
this error. (Please note that some of the values may need to be modified; 
and it is set-up to run on an 800x600 Workbenck screen.)

   The basic problem is when I check for a mouse click, it seems that it 
is detected twice. (Gadget clicks only detect once as they should; and
I still have not been able to Iscan/IShift and keypresses to work 
properly). 

   If you have the time, I would appreciate you looking at this, and 
letting me know what you think.

   Thanks again!!!

Sorry about that, Yes Ireq Scr Mode(0) = 4
and also	      Ireq Scr Mode(1) = 0

I will try that, Thanks... But as written above, the Display ID was 0???
		Ireq Scr Mode(1)=0
---------


   By the way, I just saw a message flying around, Is it really true that 
yourself and a few others are working on a new Basic-type programming 
environment??? - Flexible & OS friendly (No serious hardware hacking???)
   Sounds GREAT!!! Please add me to your information list (if one 
exists), as although I really am only a "BEGINNER" in the programming 
environment; I may be able to help in other areas. (Test & Eval; 
Documentation drafting & Composition; - Anything!!!) This is because I 
REALLY Love the AMIGA platform and strongly support anything that 
benefits our beloved machine...

   Thanks again!!!

Hi, Andy!

How far along is your project (AMOS replacement)? My friend and I have 
been working on a hi-res lace game (layered playfield and control 
screens) which works fine on every system except for Amigas using OS3.1. 
Since I use 3.1 myself, you can tell that I'd like to get rid of that 
problem and get back to testing the game on my machine.

Will your project allow easy porting of AMOS code?

Let me guess, is it a racing game? The one from Commodore Dossier, no doubt.

Hello everyone !

I'm coding in AMOS Pro on my A1200-030 and I'm about to realise this 
products on Aminet :

- POWER Procedures 1.10
        * Interface procedures (all the gadtools gadget !)
        * Request procedures (file requester, palette requester, ...)
        * String procedures (parsing procedure, formating procedures, ...)
        * Number procedures
        * System procedures (time, date)
        * Sorting procedure
        * Amigaguide documentation
        * ...

  This procedures are Shareware (100 FF/ 20 US$), but the demo version on 
Aminet will be fully functional with a limitation of 200 calls to the 
procedures at each execution. I think it permit you to test it and maybe a 
little more without having to register.

- POWER Recent 
        * Uses the POWER Procedures
        * Permits you to parse the INDEX file on Aminet
        * Permits you to select the desired directories
        * User ineterface with gauges, ...

   See you soon...

Yes.

It is possible to do - I've traced through AMOSPro's extension 
loading loop, and the current extension slot number is on the stack, 
or in a register (I can't remember which) when the extensions 
initialisation routine is called, so therefore it can return the same 
number as its extension number.

However, the huge drawback is that if the extension is in a different 
slot to the one it was in when a program that uses it was saved, the 
program won't work, so it would be impossible to send programs to 
other people, and everything could go wrong if you add a new 
extension to your system. 

In conclusion, it is possible, but not sensible.

P.s. Has anyone heard of type1.library? Apparently it allows you to 
use Abode fonts as amigas fonts. E-Mail me direct if you know 
anything - I'll post a summary of what I find out here.

I`ve written a program in AMOS and I want to be able to distribute 
keyfiles with it, so if you have the keyfile, certain options are enabled!
I`ve mssed around with a few systems, but not found one I`m happy with!

I was hoping someone could either mail me or put a message on the list 
with some code for handling keyfiles!!

Thanks

First of all hi, Steve

I have made some programs using 3d vectors. Making some rough calculation 
you can update about 60-100 line per second on a interlaced screen 4 colors.
This with an A1200 with fast RAM and not compiled code.
This means that you can update smoothly about 10 lines per second, 
depending on the graphic engine you use. 
Compiled programs run about 3-4 times faster. However, for very intensive 
vector calculations, AMOS is not very good. It is very simple but slow!

I'm going to learn C.

Hello,

I was just wondering if anybody knows how to use DATATYPES from 
Amos...I have absolutely no idea how to do that, and it will probably 
be impossible. But one can allways ask...

Thanx,

All scrollers should sync on the raster beam, so a text scroller

If possible, just look at my demos in the PrgCollection.lha archive
in AmiNet. Most of the scrollers/demos run in 50 Hz frame update rate
on a stock A500 (don't know if compiled or not) :-)

But I never managed to get an eight directions map software scroller
to run in one frame.

    Hello,

        I have two questions that I hope someone can answer!


a)  The Amos 1.36 creator update and Amos 1.36 compiler update need to
    be unarchived onto a disk to work. The updater looks for a disk
    with a certain name. What name is it or is there some other problem
    that I don't know about.

b)  There are two commands Squash and Unsquash which I am trying to
    figure out the exact requirements for.(Typically, these commands
    are undocumented). This is what I've figured out so far:


        =Squash(Start Address,Length,?,Compaction Speed,Cycle color)

        Compaction Speed=4095->256 which translates to V.Slow->V.Fast
        Cycle color= the color register that gets cycled during compaction

        Returns the new length of the file after compression


        =Unsquash(Start Address,Compressed Length)

        Compressed Length=the length of the compressed file

        Returns a flag that indicates the success of the decompression


    I'm am not 100% sure about all of this so if anyone has any more
    information about these routines please let me know. I would
    really like to know what the third parameter of the Squash routine
    does as well as exactly the returned values for both routines.


    Thanks,


                                Robert Currie

I have uploaded my anim2bob(graphics converter) program to aminet as well

Check them out and give me feedback. 
The reason I loaded anim2bob onto aminet was that my service provider to
the net is under going heavy modifications for a few weeks. I am unable to
send large UUencode files for a while. I can still receive them. If you
have any messages to me bounced back, just send it again and I will
eventually receive them.

Those commands are at least in AMOS Pro Compiler manual. You can use 
those commands to pack data with Powerpacker.library.

Or returns zero if interrupted with Ctrl-C, or <0 if the packed data 
exceeded the size of the original data. (ie. Overflow)

The third parameter is for memory reserve. If it is 0, then it reserves 
little buffers but packs slowly, if 1 then it packs fast but it reserves 
big buffers.

The fourth parameter only means something if the third parameter is zero.

I'm finding it hard to find the time to do all the coding that I want. I've
decided to limit myself to just a few programs at a time (like the AGA hack
and improving the anim2bob grabber).
This means that there are a lot of my programs half finished.
Is anyone interested in helping me finish them?

Star Trek- fully written, just needs conversion from amiga basic to Amos. I
have raytraced a set of new graphics to be included with it, so if you
convert the program, we can load in the new graphics.

Lunar lander - talk about bad coding! yech! It's a mess. But it is my

I'm not quite sure about what you mean, but if you have a file
containing BANK1-data, BANK2-data and then the seq.file you could:
(Using AmosPro!!, otherwise you'll need the LDos-extension, for
 it contains a sload and ssave type of command)

Bsave bank1, then 
Open In 1,file=the saved bank-file,
put the POF(1) at the EOF(1)
and then Ssave 1,start to length/finish (not quite sure)

This way you have the two banks sticked together in one file and
then you can (after closing it) Append to the file and write you
seq.data

Loading it means: Open In 1...
then: Sload 1 to start,length (note the different command lay-out
for sload and ssave !!, I might be wrong here but they ARE different!!)
then: Sload 1 to start,length (the Pof should have been placed ok
 by the last read-command, otherwise you'll have to Pof-it youself)
Then placing the Pof at the right place, you can start reading your
sequential file.

I hope this helps.

Is there an easy way of controlling 2 mice at once within the AMOSPro programming environment, without using an extension.
I have an old copy of the Sticks Extension but cant get it to load and want to write my own  mice specific version.
Maybe I need some Peek addresses.
I`m interested in 2 people painting at once.....art wars.

MP> Hey Chris, how's the STD timer routine coming along?

Some seconds ago, I tried the routine with AMOS calling from <>SER:
and as you have already found out, _LVOWaitForChars does not work
with non-interactive file handles. I hope, I can write a workaround
for this problem, either using Packets or it might work with
_LVOFGetC, but I still have to try this out.

A more wicked thingy would be to install a slave task, which only
transfers the characters to AMOSPro using some MsgPort... but this
would be very difficult really. :(

For Marco Smetz: It perfectly worked with the Write Cli command in
that aspect that the text was written into my terminal at the same
time the program was running and not after. The problem could be
FastCall (nothing surprising at all) or any other thing. We'll keep
in touch.

I got a bit of a suprise on saturday when I bought the July issue 
(88) of amiga computing, which had a registered version of MUI on the 
coverdisk, and  "8 great MUI utilities". When I actually read it, I 
found that one of the "great MUI utilities" was written be me!

For some reason they have put my AMOSMui program from aminet on their 
coverdisk. My first reaction was "Wow, famous at last!". My second 
reaction was "Why did that pick this piece of s***?".  The whole 
point of it was to prove it was possible to use MUI from AmosPro, 
not to provide a support system for doing so, as the magazine makes 
out it does.

If you do want to write MUI programs properly in AMOSPro, then use
Easylife which contains the proper support commands. But its worth 
getting the mag anyway, as its cheaper than registering for MUI!

P.s. UK residents: Since we've had a few days of nice weather, to 
you think the grass at wimbledon will be dried out enough to burn
properly yet?

Well, when I wrote that message I wasn't at home, so I didn't remember 
and couldn't check were those routines documented or not.

Just wondering if anybody knows a way to remove or change the screen-
flashing that occours when powerpacked files are being decrunching after
they are loaded with the "PPload FILNAME,BANK" command in AmosPro V2.0
I'd be happy for an answer.

Hello guys...

this is my little contribution for the AMOS comunity....
This program load a resource bank, and CREATE the EXACT copy of the IFF
picture from wich the graphics elements was grabbed.

This utility is useful for two reasons:

1- when you lose the IFF picture of your bank
2- when you have a resource bank, but not the picture, and you want modify
the graphics elements.

I'm waiting your opinions.....

P.S I have created the AMOS INTERFACE LANGUAGE EDITOR (AMILED), someone
interested? It's freeware :) ... and powerfull. Major features:

- you can easly draw your interface (...like GadtoolsBox Editor), and the
  source code is automatically created!!! :)
- you can use any resource bank
- you can edit/debug directly your source code (like AMAL EDITOR)
- powerfull online help
- the interface is vey nice and intuitive (obviously i have used the AMILED!)

Enjoy......

would you please E-Mail it to me (in ASCII) ?

 Thanks !

Keyfiles should always kept in PROGDIR: (S: or ENVARC: is not a
preferable drawer anymore). Moreover, the keyfiles should at least
contain a serial identification number and (why not?) the full name
and perhaps the address of the registered user. Then there should be
a checksum in the regdata to verify that nothing has been modified
(the checksum could be a simple CRC, but more complicated and
algorithmic checksums are prefered ;-) ). The keyfile should be
encrypted using some very tricky algorithms (there's no chance
cracking an AMOS program, because Francois has written AMOS ;-)) ).
Please look up a encrypting book (which you will certainly find at
your local library). If you think, you don't need such a book, please
take care that even the most wicked looking routine could be really
easy to hack (read the PGP docs for more information on flaws of
crypting if you want to). Optionally, you could add a second checksum
of the encoded data ;-)

To do all this encrypting work, the data should be stored in a fixed
size memory bank. This keyfile can then be saved using Bsave.

To load the file, reserve a bank and call Bload. Then compare the
outer checksum. If it's correct, then decrypt the reg data, and again
compare the inner checksum. If everything is correct, you've
hopefully got a unmodified registered keyfile.

Example of a very simple keyfile:

KEYSIZE=256 : Rem Set the size you need for your files.
Reserve As Work 9,KEYSIZE
ST=Start(9)
' To make the hacking process harder, first fill all bytes with
' random data.
For A=0 to (KEYSIZE/2)-1 : Rem All data is written
  Doke ST+A*2,Rnd(32767)
Next
Loke ST,SERNUMBER
Poke$ ST+4,NAME$+Chr$(0)
' You could poke more information if you want.

' Now create the inner checksum (in this case, it's only 16 bit):
SUM=0
For A=0 To (KEYSIZE/2)-3 : Rem the inner checksum itself is excluded
  SUM=(SUM*11+Deek(ST+A*2)) And $FFFF
Next
Doke ST+KEYSIZE-4,SUM

' Now encode the data. Very simple encoding method.
' Please invent your own.
EC=0
For A=0 To (KEYSIZE/2)-2 : Rem the inner crc is included, but not the outer.
  OD=Deek(ST+A*2)
  OD=(OD And $FFF0)/16+(OD And $F)*$1000
  OD=(OD+EC) and $FFFF
  Doke ST+A*2,OD
  Add EC,$DEAD
Next

' Now create the outer checksum:
SUM=0
For A=0 To (KEYSIZE/2)-2 : Rem the outer checksum is not included
  SUM=(SUM*17+Deek(ST+A*2)) And $FFFF
Next
Doke ST+KEYSIZE-2,SUM

' Now save the keyfile:
Bsave "PROGDIR:Keyfile",ST To ST+KEYSIZE



Ok. Now the appropriate decrypting code:

KEYSIZE=256
Reserve As Work 9,KEYSIZE
ST=Start(9)
Bload "PROGDIR:Keyfile",9

' Check the outer checksum:
SUM=0
For A=0 To (KEYSIZE/2)-2
  SUM=(SUM*17+Deek(ST+A*2)) And $FFFF
Next
If Deek(ST+KEYSIZE-2)<>SUM Then Print "Intruder alert! A lamer tried to hack the keyfile!" : Stop

' Now the data has to be decoded.
EC=0
For A=0 To (KEYSIZE/2)-2
  OD=Deek(ST+A*2)
  OD=(OD-EC) and $FFFF
  OD=(OD And $0FFF)*16+(OD And $F000)/$1000
  Doke ST+A*2,OD
  Add EC,$DEAD
Next
' Check the inner crc:
SUM=0
For A=0 To (KEYSIZE/2)-3
  SUM=(SUM*11+Deek(ST+A*2)) And $FFFF
Next
If Deek(ST+KEYSIZE-4)<>SUM Then Print "A cute guy hacked the first barrier but could not get past the checksum!" : Stop

' And at last, you have your registered data back again:
SERNUMBER=Leek(ST)
NAME$=Peek$(ST+4,80,Chr$(0))



Everything was typed in from scratch and from mind only. :-) I hope
it works ;-)

All scrollers should sync on the raster beam, so a text scroller

If possible, just look at my demos in the PrgCollection.lha archive

on a stock A500 (don't know if compiled or not) :-)

But I never managed to get an eight directions map software scroller

RC>         =Squash(Start Address,Length,?,Compaction Speed,Cycle color)

>From the AMOS Professional Compiler Manual:

------------------- cut -------------------
 
L=Squash(Address,Length,Flag,Ahead,Colour)

Squash compresses an area of memory into a fraction of its normal
size. The squashing process can be stopped at any time by pressing
Ctrl-C.
  Address holds the address in memory of your selected memory block.
Usually, this will be start of an AMOS memory bank but you can also
compress other memory areas with this system as well.
  Never atempt to squash a sprite or icon bank. These are not stored
in one continuous memory block, so they can't be compressed using a
simple Squash operation. You can however, freely squash all other
banks including those containing samples or menus. Length specifies
the number of bytes of data to be compacted.

*Warning!* The squasher will automatically overwrite your existing
data with the new packed version.

Flag toggles the squasher between two modes:

Flag=0:     Sets SLOW MODE. This reserves the absolute minimum space
	    for the compression process. As the name suggests, the
	    squashing may take some time to complete.

Flag<>0:    Activates FAST MODE and compacts the data in a separate
	    memory area for the maximum possible speed. In order to
	    use this feature, you'll need enough RAM to hold a memory
	    block at least twice the size as the original data. If
	    you run out of space AMOS will automatically flip back to
	    SLOW mode.

If SLOW mode has been set, ahead specifies how far (in bytes) the
squasher will search ahead during the compaction process. The higher
the figure the greater the compaction ratio and the slower the
execution speed. The minimum is 256 (fast but inefficient) and the
maximum is 4096 [Ed: In fact, it's only 4095] (very slow). A
reasonable value to use is about 1024.
  Colour is the number of a colour (0-31) to be flashed on the screen
while the data is being squashed. After your data has been compacted
the squasher will return one of the following values:

L>0:    This indicates the squash was successful and returns the new
	length of the compressed data.
L=0:    The squash was halted with Ctrl-C.
L<0:    The compression has been aborted because the squashed length
	turns out to be longer than the original. This is very rare
	but it can occasionally happen. The worst offenders are sound
	samples or banks containing compacted IFF screens. [Ed: Take
	care when compiling programs with squashing enabled. The
	routine used is the same as Squash, and the compiler will not
	take care of non-packable music and sound banks!]

------------------- cut -------------------

Moreover, the length of the original data can be found in the last
longword of the compacted data. ;-)

RC>         =Unsquash(Start Address,Compressed Length)

------------------- cut -------------------
 
L=Unsquash(Address,Length)

Unsquash restores a block of data to it's original state. It's used
after a Squash instruction to unpack the selected memory area.
  Address holds the address of the first byte to be unpacked.
  Length specifies the number of bytes to be e-compressed. This
should be the length of the packed data returned by the Squash
command.

*Beware!* Unsquash completely overwrites the current contents in your
chosen memory block. So you'll need to reserve a bank of the original
(unsquashed) length to hold the new data. You can then Bload the
packed data at the beginning of this bank and call the Unsquash
function.

Michael, there is no AMOS Pro compiler for AMOS Pro V1.12.  The AMOS Pro 
compiler only works with verison 2.0.  To get version 2.0, you have to 
purchase the AMOS Pro Compiler.  Included with the compiler is an AMOS 
Pro updater disk which will update AMOS Pro to v2.0

Hi Paul,
   I read the other day your looking for 1.12 owners to test you 
auto.config prog.  Well if you can send me detail on how to get the 
program from your E-Mail in to amos I'll be happy to test it for you. 


Hi everybody else,
    Why has everybody started sending their progs embedded into 
E-Mail?  Its a pain and it makes the files I have to download 
extremly big.  Just remember 4k limit.  Also some of us have to pay 
per bit, so please if you have a prog mail a message and let those 
who want get in touch or put it on AmiNet.

Well thats my winge out the way for this year. 
(good news about Amiga coming back on line eh?)

Hello Everyone,

Another "New Guy" on the list...  Everyone knows everyone else, right?  Right,
so I'll say a few things about myself and then get on to a short list of
questions.

My first computer:  Ohio Scientific Challenger 1P (1980), 4K RAM, 8K Microsoft
BASIC in ROM.  I never could get enough of that PEEKing and POKEing!...  Anyone
else have one of these classics?  I still have mine...  Other systems included
TRS-80 Color Computer (It could multitask!), IBM compatibles (They could not!).
Along the way I picked up Turbo Basic, and I've made a few inroads with C.
Tried to learn structures and pointers, and other indirect programming methods.

My now computer:  Amiga 500 (1990), 9 Megs RAM, WB 2.04, huge(!) 80 Meg Hard
Drive.  Got myself into Videotitling and animation stuff.  Picked up SAS C 5.0
(kind of confusing), and tried to learn Amiga System Programming (way indirect
programming)!  Got Amos Professional + Compiler last summer, and now I'm PEEKing
and POKEing again!  Finally going to get my fill of that dangerous stuff!

I have enjoyed many of the archived AmosLists.  Several questions I have had
were addressed in the List.  Any stupid questions I might ask haven't been on
the List in 4 months (or maybe a week ago, not archived yet...), so I'll just
ask away!

1.  Bug Report

I found a bug(?) in the Interface command DIgit.  The value returned, if
negative, when converted to a string interprets the minus sign as a 3 digit
number (253, or something like that), so for example, entering a -11 in a DIgit
zone when converted to a string becomes: 25311 (or whatever that 3 digit number
is...).  Is anyone else aware of this?

The Global command won't work if there are quotation marks.  For example, Global
A, or Global X() work fine, but Global "*", or Global "AnyString" generates a
Syntax Error.

2.  You guys love to hate AMOS!  For a while, you had me scared half to death
that AMOS would be utterly useless to develop with...  However, I asked one
fairly prominent List member and he reassured me that most of the errors, bugs,
frustrations, and gray hairs were related to extra extensions and AMOS code
which pushes the system to the limits.  If I don't need real speed, and keep it
simple, AMOS will compile good code that will run on most any Amiga.  Is this
really, truly the case?  I sure hope so...  If I don't need to use C; I don't
want to hassle with it.

3.  3D Extension.  With AMOS Pro I received a 3D extension, and nothing in the
documentation about using it.  Do I need another program (AMOS 3D)?  I tried
running a tutorial program on 3D and although the Editor properly recognized and
formatted the commands, it couldn't run properly.  Is there anything (file,
program, expert user, etc.) which can help?  I really could use those 3D
commands...

It's good to be on the List.  I look forward to many informative messages!

One of the most annoying bugs my friend and I have run into has been with 
how AMOS interlace displays are incompatible with WB3.1 ROM and OS. You 
have to try it for yourself to know how annoying it is. It's a price paid 
for not having an intuition-friendly program. AMOS has many merits, but 
this isn't one of them. *8^)
