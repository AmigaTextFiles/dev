   * ASCII signitures have been rebuilt where possible.
     Unfortunately Yahoo store messages in a way which means more than 1 space
     is stored as just 1 space. Viewing the message source, and then trying to
     view HTML source in Firefox didn't make any difference.
     Where I have been unable to rebuild the ASCII signitures I have simply put
     "ASCII Signiture As-Is" by the message number.

     Thanks to Mark de Jong (from the AMOS-LIST) for helping me with rebuilding
     Floquet's ASCII signiture. (who else would keep emails for 7 years?!)

     Thanks to Andrew Allen for preserving Peter Cahill's ASCII signiture for
     me (see message 1613) in November 1998.

     Thanks to Michael Cox, as I was able to cross-reference some emails from
     the Onelist archives with ones posted to the Yahoo one to reinstate email
     addresses that Yahoo has discarded, and rebuild some ASCII signitures.


   Message From Archivist
  ------------------------

   I hope everyone enjoys reading the messages and appreciates me archiving
   them. It took hours of work to get all the info into this file and then 
   rebuild the ASCII signitures as best as I could.
   Don't forget to join, or atleast visit, the Y! AMOS-LIST group:

I'm with you on this one, look the things that amos is good at (2D
scrolling, Sprites/Bobs, Screen Handling, ect. ect.) are percisely the
thing the Amiga is good at, whereas the things Amos is bad for (maths, 3D
texture mapping/Ray casting, scaling ect.) are percisely the things the
Amiga is bad at. And just to be really annoying, I don't think Amos is
the best language to learn on, PASCAL is really (it has no GOTO command!)
Amos is good to use but it'll let you get away with too much sloppy code
to be a good beginer's language. Maybe I'm misstepping here, but it seems
the oldest, wisest folks on the list are those who've had experience
beyond Amos, I know I never wrote a decent piece of code until my first
"Hello World" in C, but still I always come back to Amos when I want to do
something serious, why? Because it's the best, fastest way to turn an
Idea in your head into a game on your screen. That is just so long as
your idea isn't for a 3-D guradu shaded texture mapped wonderland.

Exactly! I've had this arguement with my friend several times! I wanted a
program to change all my MAME Roms (over 85!) that were in directories into
ZIP files. In less than 5 minutes with AMOS (plus the AMCAF extension) I
had a program up and running! I didn't have to learn how to use libraries
to make a file tree..blah blah blah. Sorry, I'm just too lazy to learn how
to do all that! :)

Okay you have obviously not used amos outside of amos!
The good thing about amos is it allows use of assembler and doscalls and so
on... so it isn't just BASIC! its much more... I mean you compare Qbasic and
AmosPro they are totally different! And as for PASCAL! Ha! I admit i have
only learnt the basics and a little extra.. but it is no where near as good
as Amos... Okay it may be good that you have to setup everything and i don't
know about wether amos is faster or not! But so far the only good thing to
do with Pascal that i have found is its variable structure using TYPE! But I
don't think AMOS is just a starting language... its a good starting language
but its a middling language too = ) ! I do agree though that the more
experience with other languages you have the better! And again I agree but i
only find a problem with speed... I can do anything any other language can
do with 10* more ease but 10* less speed! Coz Amos can handle 3D and
Tmapping.. its just too slow! But with using DMA you can do alot! And thats
what i try to do with my progs. Use the lowest level I can possible do in
amos to get the most power and speed!

We all know. Amos is so much more than that. It is probably the best
implementation of "BASIC" I have ever seen. Yeah you can get a bit
faster, or a bit more OS friendly, but you sure can't get anything
easier to develop in. Everything is already there.

Oh yeah, there are alternatives. Loads of them. All more expensive
and a heck of a lot harder to use. Some of them you need to study
and study and study, and then use library calls to do anything with
anyway. Yuk.

Note to Ghizzo: Ditch GOTO from AmosNG...

Note to "you know who you are": You can learn to live without goto ;-)

Just as a matter of interest, can people, errrr, finish editing their
emails so what they are quoting and what they are saying are SEPERATE
and easy to read, without reading lots and lots of unformatted text
inbetween please ?

(Oh yeah, and turn off HTML if you can.. Either that or MIME seperate
it or something. Everything is running together and looks awful in
RAW text - the REAL format of email.)

Please ?

It'll make things easier for everyone to read...

Ah, yes you can't do much with PASCAL but I submit it is the best
learning language because it is forceably structured, there's no bouncing
around from here to there and back again in pascal you've got to divide
every task into it's own seperate and discrete function. Thus pascal does
what I think amos can't and that's teaches you to think about code in an
orderly and efficient way. Amos by contrast will let you get away with
anything and so it's not as good for learning structure.

Ah then we agree anyway, I guess you're just not a fan of PASCAL
that's all. :) But I'm totally with you on AMOS as a middling language to
use your words. It is very powerful and so easy to use, maybe if you
really, really need the speed it can fail you, but if you're only making
2D old school style games (the kind the Amiga itself was designed with in
mind) it is plenty fast enough.

And again I agree but i

Yeah although what I was saying was that you should also consider
that the amiga itself is slown at these things, I mean the main bottle
kneck with ray casting is getting an entire new screen worth of pixels
written every 50th of a second. The amiga just isn't made to update that
much of the screen at once.

But with using DMA you can do alot! And thats

it's a good call about assembler, thus amos can be flexible, easy
when you want it and fast when you need it.

Wyatt (he was on amos list, I think) wanted to make language called POP
which would have advantages of both basics and C, but he stopped
developing. If he succeeds, that will be a hell of a language!

Yeehaaa !
It seems that I started a war, I was not my intention.
All I wanted to say is that Amos has some lacks in communicating with
the WB. Have you tried to Lprint sth in "Times 10 Bold" ? Did you run
one of your "pal only" progs on a friend's Amiga that has a VGA screen ?

I know that Amos is a very good language (that's why I'm here). It has
great abilities, so far that I wrote a MIDI sequencer with it !
AMOS is a real MULTIMEDIA language. It supports images, sounds, musics,
and anims with Amos Pro. Who could ask for more ?

I started in C some years ago, on PC/Dos (nobody's perfect), so I have a
small Ansi knowledge of C. I tried to do my 1st steps on Amiga
recently.. It's hard. I never went below "Hello.C" !!! And it was a real
victory when at least I achieved to compile it. 8)
So I still use Amos ! And I like it.

Hey Keith...

PASCAL is great to learn on, because you are forced to think things out and
produce well written code.

> Note to Ghizzo: Ditch GOTO from AmosNG...

I think GOTO can be helpful during developement, like if you wanted to skip
a section of code while debugging instead of trying to comment it out, or
make it into a Proc or Sub.

If you ever have some free time on your hands, could you fix the bug
in the new amos screens ?

The problem is that if You press leftamiga+a loads of times
(about 20-30+) amos doesnt return right, and gives a black screen!
then youve got to reboot......

keep up the good work!

Hey! I might be biast here but I'm with Nikola... Pascal Is one of the worst
languages I have seen... apart from Q basic... Its ggod for learning I
agree... i got a book out of the library and in a few days I could do most
of it! But it goes no where... I am currently 'learning' it at college! But
the annoying thing is i already new the language before i started the
course... you may ask why did i take the course then because i thought i may
be able to learn Java which is a cool language! I hardly know any C as I
havn't been able to get a nice compiler i like working with and i just
havn't had the time... and my assembler days are up for the moment since i
have lost Devpac 3 which is the best assembler I have found! So I stick with
amos for the time being learning About how everything works.... Okay i know
how to use all the commands... But know I'm working out how and why they
work and how i can find a better way of doing them... I have found I have
learnt loads about the AMiga the system and amos !
I don't wanna start any arguement as I've had a pretty bad week and I just
want people to be happy.... So peace to all.... Keep The momentum Going with
AMIGA! And have a merry Birthday! When ever that maybe!

Does anyone out there know a way of moving the mouse in workbench via a
pointer or call? I don't really need to know its just buggin me coz i can do
loads with Workbench without extensions i just can't do that!

Thanx 2 you all!

And a reminder to everyone if anyone has any command lists for extensions
they want put into the amospro helpfile prog i'm making please send them to
me..... or if anyone has any ideas for what they would like to see in it!

At the moment i'm hoping to cover...

Fully customizable Menu system.... Buttons can be moved around, snapshotted
and cleaned up and all the sections can be put where you want them....
Your own notes can be made on the commands and stored with that help
section... and then sent out to other people on the net to add to their help
file!

I'm hoping to put a function that can grab commands from extension.txt's and
put them into the help file!

Just as a novalty I'll add in ability to make the gui look nice and so on...
if anyone thinks its a good idea? I'm not sure it is!

It will be able to say where the command is in the help file when you
directly jump to it by pressin help over the subject command coz that really
annoys me about the Current Amos Help!

And the Help file will be as compact as possible... not 10* bigger than it
needs to be!!! And trust me! its tough work re writing the damn thing!

I'm working on an idea to make it so that example source code can be put
directly to the Amos Paste buffer so that after looking in the help file,
Example text can be copied to the program directly!

Also all the syntax and notes on the commands will hopfully be rewritten...
coz some explanations for commands are weird! But as I said the Help File is
BIG!

So has anyone got any ideas or does everyone think i should just go and
program a 'hello world' program and leave you all alone as I'm scaring you
all with this over long email!

Bye! Phil!

Well, no sooner than I sent off my message for help than I went to my AMOS
Pro manual and discovered that AMOS is restricted to 65,000 elements/array
(which would probably explain my problem; I was up to 100,000+ elements).

Anyhoo, thanks to everyone for your suggestions. Looks like I'll have to
give banks a try and see how they work out. If all else fails, "MIcRoSoFT!"

True, because when you benchmark the Amiga, it's raycasting abillites
really aren't much beyond that of a Super Nintendo (near a Playstation with
an AGA o4o/o6o). Nevertheless, it IS capable, maybe not as easily in AMOS,
but the Amiga IS capable (take for instance ClickBoom's recent Quake port).

Yep... or even something a bit more like C/C++ as follows...

DEBUG=True

If DEBUG=True
'stuff to skip...
End If

Of course it's actually exactly the same as your idea, Keith, but I
just like the lable as it adds a bit more clarity. You can also do
things like...

DEBUG_ONE=False
DEBUG_TWO=True
DEBUG_THREE=False
etc. etc.

IF DEBUG_ONE=True
'First section to skip...
End If

IF DEBUG_TWO=True
'Second section to skip...
End If

IF DEBUG_THREE=True
'Third section to skip...
End If

Now, simply changing the status of the DEBUGS at the top of your
program would enable/disable the execution of each section.

Again, it's really all the same principle, but kind of a new twist.

My whole point was that it's easy to do. It's just a way I was taught to
use the GOTO command, instead of sending you all over a program. I just
felt like sticking up for the least liked command among better programmer.

I think anyone from TBL could do it, with a few asm procedures ;).

Infact any decent demo programmer /could/ write a super 3D extention.

We could pester, say, TBL to write a TBL 3D extention for amos, but I
don't think they'd bother. Havn't seen anything from them for ages :(

PS. If you don't have a PPC, then you don't know what your missing :
VenusArts PPC demos are the best.


PPS. For that 'show off to amiga format' demo, I've got some AMOS3D
objects with a nice lens flare, but the 3d objects look straight from
the 80's. Prehaps we should wait for the new amos?

See ya.

Hi all.

First of all I'll introduce myself.

I'm Stephen Thornber, 36 (ouch!), unemployed, and a 3D freak.
I've just got myself Amos, and I'm trying a code a few simple utils
and maybe a game or two. But I'm very very thick, and know 0 about
coding, or maths. so I may ask lots of sad questions, please
forgive me :)

I'm currently running on an a1200 030/42.7 MMU FPU, 35mb ram
- (which still isn't enough) heh heh,
quad Cd-rom, citizen abc printer, 250mb hd. But I'm getting
a ppc+040 soon (mainly for LW and Imagine :)
So I hope amos works with a ppc.

I would like to ask a couple of questions.

(BTW - I'm using AmosProV2.0)

a:- Can Amos do gui's..?
(I want to open a window on wb with buttons, and
sliders in it.)

b:- Can anyone recommend an amos book for thick people.
(like me ;)

c:- When I told people on irc that I was trying to learn Amos,
I got slagged off and told it was pathetic, etc.
why is that.?

d:- sometimes when I load AmosPro the top of the screen
flickers like mad. (where the menu bar is)
its annoying, how do I fix the problem?

e:- is there an ftp site where I can get example source code,
help files, amos utils, etc..?

f:- I've heard a lot about "Extensions" exactly what is an
extention..?


BTW - Before you say RTFM, I don't have one.. sob sob ;)

Thanks in advance for any help

Steve

ClickBooms Quake port is really bad! Surely it works (and thanks to CB for
DOING the port), but it is extremely slow. I have tried out some of the
"illegal" ports, and they are MUCH faster. Thus: CBs Quake does NOT show the
Amigas full potential when dealing with raycasting abilities.

Second: Someone has done a really convincing Wolfenstein/Doom clone (not the
chunky one with pathetic textures) in Amos using ASM-routines. I can't
remember WHERE I saw it (a long time ago) but it was really good, almost like
Alien Breed 3d - I shit you not! Anyone else who has seen it or know where to
get it?

LW + Imagine? They don't use PPC do they? Shouldn't you be looking at
tornado3d?. Anyway AMOS works fine on my PPC so no probs.

PS. DON'T upgrade your Flashrom untill futher notice, its really
buggy and causes problems for WarpOS.

You can't use the WB GUI with amos alone. You need to install an
extension. GUI 1.70 extention is aparently quite good, I sugest you get
a copy of that.

An extention add commands that AMOS didn't have originly or wasn't
very good at.


I'd also recomend Turbo+ extention for the fast drawing commands, I
could send it to you if you want.


There is also a 3D extention, but I wouldn't bother with that: its
not very good.

You can get that along with other 'goodies' from
http://users.cybercity.dk/~ccc21504/amos/front.html

> b:- Can anyone recommend an amos book for thick people.

Its really, well, Easy. I don't know where to get a copy from though!

Because, to be honest, its un-system friendly and slow-ish.

I can send you some of my junk. I've got:

*A 3D vector map routine

*A rotating+scaling texturemap mode 7 style

A fast 2D line vector rotator/scaler/editor.

A workaround to AMOS' paralax scrolling routine.

And somemore stuff as well.

Nope they don't, but I don't have my ppc yet, I'm still saving

Nope, the only thing I have running is Dopus Magellan as

Heh heh, you must be joking, that lot is WAY over my head,

No problem... no offense was intended. I was just interested in seeing
how other people debugged their programs and thought I'd share my
approach.

Personally, I haven't used the Goto command since back on the old
C64... funny as I often used Gosub in AMOS, but then that is a more
modular-oriented command. Procedures are the way to go... and
like my friend Ben Wyatt told me many times... "You can fold them
right up"... a very addicting feature.

Oh, while I'm here...

"Rune J. Keller" <keller@vip.cybercity.dk>


I have been contacted by Amiga Format, who would like to put the Amos Factory
site onto their cover cd-rom.

If anyone with material on the site - that would especially mean you Pietro -
have problems with that, please let me know as soon as possible.

Also remember that from now on, anything posted on the site, may end up on
their cover disc, unless you direct me to do otherwise.

Guess they weren't THAT discontent with Amos anyway :)

Stephen Thornber <SThornber@steve1.demon.co.uk>


Hi Amosians.?!? :)

I've been trying to create a gui, but I stumbled at the first
fence, so to speak.

I read the docs to "gui170.lha" and installed it successfully,
then got myself "GadToolsbox v2.0b" and created my first little
gui.

But - uh, ohh. here it comes :)

GuiConvert won't convert the gui file I saved.. doh!
it opens a requestor asking for a ".gui" file, but when I select
the one I created "StevesGui.gui" 600 bytes. it just
re-opens the requestor, asking for the ".gui" file.. Doh.!

What am I doing wrong??

(I thought I read all the docs properly.?)

Great, how about a prog that opens a requestor and you pick a file
then the program gives you the version info on the file you
picked. I'd love a util to do that, but I wouldn't have a clue
how to code it.. ??

Gui probs.?

Sun Oct 4, 1998 2:50 pm
Stephen Thornber <SThornber@steve1.demon.co.uk>


Hi all

I have a little problem, here's my code:-

Load "Dh1:Amos/gui.abk"
Gui Bank 20
Amos To Back
Gui Open 1,1
Do
GW=Gui Wait
If GW=-1 Then A=Gui Close(1)
Loop

Now that opens my gui very nicely, but when I click on the
close gadget, not only does the gui close, but so does AmosPro
and It wont re-load without a boot.?

is there no way to keep AmosPro open as well as the gui, so
I can modify my code.?

Its a hassle to have to reboot every time I run my prog. :(

BTW - Please don't slag off my code, I've only been using amospro
for 2 days. (although constructed critisism is welcomed)

Steve

You were TAUGHT to use goto ????????? What the heck were they thinking !!!

I stopped using them long before I was even told structured programming was
a good thing - I derived that from first principles.

You've sent amos to back, but never brought it back to front. Also, install
the ams command in c:. If amos locks while your gui is running, ams will take
you back to the amos environmnent.

>is there no way to keep AmosPro open as well as the gui, so

Yes, but you have to remember to bring amos back to front at the end. Using
Gui Amiga 0 and Gui Amos are the best bet.

I'm also sending you my gui tutorial, that will get you over the next 50

Hi guys.

sorry for bothering you again.. (blush)

But I'm having problems (whats new, I hear you say :)

I'm writing text to my gui via the Gui Text command,
but when I run the program amos complains that I haven't
set the gfx output.

I read the docs and according to that I should use

Gui Gfx 1,1

But whenever I do that, amos gives me a very weird error.
somthing like %&$ on line 10
or sometimes ,$ on line 10 ?!?!?
(the line it gives me is the line that Gui Gfx is on.)

what am I doing wrong..?

You should have seen some of my high school programming classes! My PASCAL
II class, which was supposed to give me college credit, was turned into a
"who can beat Lost Vikings the fastest" class.

Well, when they were teaching me QBasic in high school, about 6 years ago,
that's what the teacher said. Then again, he was also a coach, and the
books we had were pretty out dated, they considered the C64 a brand new
computer on the market!

I never use GOTOs for anything other than skipping over a little code while
trying to fix some code. I do not support any other use of it. :)

Hi all,

As i no longer have time for Amos or my amigas for that matter, would anyone be
interested in finishing off an application i started? let me bore you with a
very brief overview:-

Its a demo maker if you would, using a simple point and click interface allowing
the user to piece together a script that will play timed events, it allows med
modules to be paged in and out of memory allowing a continuous stream of music
etc... anyone seriously interested and I mean interested I will e-mail you the
compiled version and we'll take it from there, i dont want time wasters OK.

Later

Yep! It can with the Gui ext. but i don't use it much i prefer doing things
my way with Dos,Int,gfx and librarycalls!
So i'm not much use when it comes to GUI

But JD extension is cool you should get that! Its readily available and
found on any Aminet Directory!

I have a good amos book that started me off! can't remeber the name I'll get
back to you on that one... Oh and by the way don't put cha self down like
that everyone has to not know about things to start with otherwise there
would be no learning and no idividualism because everyone would know
everything! I mean did einstein know that he wos gonna get a sore head coz i

Coz it isn't and people who don't work with it don't find out what it can

an RRGGBB Screen.... my Amiga for an RRGGBB screen!

Sun Oct 4, 1998 9:08 pm
"John Glanville" <John.Glanville@btinternet.com>


Okay! I'm not giving my amiga away to any of those who took what i said
above literally! No way! But the thing is I need help guys! I'm currently
working on a game that uses a Public 256 col screen... Without using
extensions... except for Jd file size! My problem is that the Pub screen i
open (Using a call) is only RGB colour... Where as I want an RRGGBB colour
screen and to all of those of you who know about images those extra letters
can make all the difference!

I was hoping if anyone can tell me how to open an RRGGBB screen 256 cols.
meaning a screen that uses 256 quantities of Red green and Blue! ) I prefer
a Dos or int call or perhaps someone out there knows what all the tags do
when setting up a screen! Coz I use my procedure that opens the screen with
an intcall and I only know what half the flags do!

Can anyone help! I need this becuase I want the screen to load in 256 colour
images... and in RGB they just loose their quality! And i mean we cant have
lousy quality on a Tron game can we?

Also does any one know how to use data types from amos coz at the moment i
am having to save the image out as Raw in PPaint and then Copy each bitplane
to the logbases of the destination Pub screen! which can get a bit tedeous!
as the Colour pallette has to be loaded seperatley!

Okay! Thanx for listening coz i know i tend to warble on so...
Bye! Phil! Once I get this sorted DepTron Should be finished soon!

TGE screens operate in $RRGGBB, and they also support gfx cards, aga
and chunky8 and chunky16.

The notes I've left arn't very good, but you can use online help with
commands you don't know:


(just cut that section out, save it as ver.asc, and merge it as ascii in
the amos FILE menu)

------------------------------------------------------
F$=Fsel$("")
' Opens AMOS file requester.
'
' (You can use ASL requesters with some extentions ;)


Open In 1,F$
' Opens that file for input (we won't input from it though)

L=Lof(1)
' Gets the size of the file in input

Close
' Closes that file


Reserve As Work 5,L
' Reserves the right ammount of memory to load that file

Bload F$,Start(5)
' Loads the file to the start of memory bank 5


P=0

For A=0 To L

Scan through the file with variable A

S=Start(5)


If P=0

' P is a tempory marker to show whever we've found '$VER'

P1=Peek(A+S)
P2=Peek(A+S+1)
P3=Peek(A+S+2)
P4=Peek(A+S+3)
' Reads from memory bank 5 + A at various offsets

If Chr$(P1)="$" and Chr$(P2)="V" and Chr$(P3)="E" and Chr$(P4)="R"

' Check if we find '$VER'

P=1

End If

End If
If P=1

P1=Peek(A+S)

If P1=0
End
End If
' Check for end of $VER

Print Chr$(P1);
' Print version


End If
Next
------------------------------------------------------

As for the simple demos, I'll get back to you in a day or too.

See ya.

Urk. A goto has no useful function, and can lead to very bad programming
and impossible to read programs. (Ask any cobol programmer) A goto
allows you to jump around in your code all over the place, without proper
control. A program should flow naturally, and be nice and easy to read,
amd preferably make sense (at least to the programmer) and contain proper
comments. (You know you want to...)

> (Sorry if this makes me sounds stupid or ignorant, but I'd

In simple terms, you don't need them. If you NEED to resort to a goto, you need
to read more manuals. ;-)

GOTO is an instruction unuseful and dangerous.
Unuseful because with a good program structure you don't need it. That
forces you to think about your program before you start typing.
Someting like :
AGAIN:
' some code
If _lifes>0 then goto again
Must be coded :
While _lifes>0
' some code
Wend
You naturally think "I play while I have lifes".
So your code is more "natural" and readable. In 6 monthes you still will
be able to read and understand what you write now.
Dangerous besause you can code this:
If blabla then goto SHMURTZ
' lots of code
Gosub SHMURTZ
' lots of code
SHMURTZ:
' something
Return
If the "blabla" condition is rarely true, your prog may work, until that
day where you'll get a "RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB" and hard way to find why.

That's for Amos. But in general case, avoid GOTO. I daily program at
work with a language with no goto, and I've no problem with that.

The only language that obliges you to use GOTOs is COBOL !!!

hehe, seems you have a memory like mine :)

I'm not putting myself down, I'm just being truthful ;)

when it comes to 3D I'm great, when it comes to coding, I'm
crap.. but I have only been using amospro for 3-4 days now
so I shouldn't expect to know much yet?

>Coz it isn't and people who don't work with it don't find out what it can
>do! Like 'You don't know until youv'e tried it!'

oh right...

I did try Blitz2, but I was so hard to do the slightest thing,
and it kept crashing.. also the manual for blitz is pathetic
and it assumes you are already a coding expert.!

>RTFM????

"Read The F***ing Manual" ;)


BTW - Do you have any small ( less than 50k ) games/utils
that you've coded with amos..?
I'd like to see what it can do, before I really throw myself
into learning it.

a couple of problems :(

Mon Oct 5, 1998 2:52 pm
Stephen Thornber <SThornber@steve1.demon.co.uk>


Hi Guys.

I've come across a couple of problems,
one is just annoying, the other is my main concern.

1:- (the annoying one)

I designed a simple gui (a slider and 2 buttons)
it works fine, so I added a bit of code to
print the current setting of the slider on the gui,
using "gui Text", well that works fine.. BUT

If I move the slider to a high position, the gui will
show, say errrm "12", then when I move it down to something
like "5", instead of "5", I get "52".

Its not printing over the last piece of text..
I tried several ways to fix the problem, the most obvious
one was to print " " at the same co-ords, just before
it prints the number. (to clear the last number)
but this doesn't work... now for something wierd.
If I change the " " to something like "___" or "XXX"
it works fine, overwriting the previous text..
but ___ or XXX looks ugly..
the question is... why doesn't 3 spaces work the same..?!?!

I eventually fixed it by using "gui bar" to wipe out the
text, but I'd rather use the " " method..

(sorry for the looooong text, but I couldn't explain it
any easier ;)

2:- (the main problem)

I added some code to my simple gui to iconify itself
when I clicked on a button, this works fine.
but I'd like it to uniconify when I click on the close
gadget of the iconified window. I can't get this to
work at all, in fact it won't read the close button
at all, when its iconified. and I have to use Ctrl+C.

my code is like this:-

Procedure ICONIFY
Gui Iconify 1
X=0
Repeat
GW=Gui Wait
If GW=-1
Gui Uniconify 1
X=1
EndIf
Until X=1
Endproc

Anyone tell me how to read the close gadget when my
window is iconified..?!?!

(Please forgive my sloppy code, I am learning, but
slowly... :)


Thanks in Advance :)

GOTO's

"Ives, Neil, IVESNJ" <neil.ives@bt.com>


I must say this discussion of Goto is just what the Amos list is for, it
makes useful reading material, these are the type of mails that I save.
I have read experienced programers slagging-off Goto and have discovered the
problems with it myself, but beginners need to know these things. However,
the use of Goto to *temporarily* jump past a bit of program to test
something is very useful though, I bet most Amos coders glance over their
shoulder and do that dirty thing sometimes. (indignant outrage follows!)

Thanks, people, keep it up.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yes! your right. I bought Blitz thinking it would be like Amos but able to
use new screen modes and stuff but I was so disappointed with the manual. It
seemed to assume a knowledge that was not appropriate to a version of Basic,
which after all is supposed to be a beginners language. I have never created
anything with it, it just sits on my hard disk taking up space! The manuals
that came with my Amos original and AmosPro have taught me almost all I have
learnt about programming. I have my manual near me so I can refer to it
often. Message to any future Amos publisher..produce a good manual...please.

So your the Author of TGE huh! Cool! where can i get it? I've been looking
for it but to no avail! Thanx I'll try it! Is there a command to return the
Rastport of the TGE screens? Coz i will need that to use the screen! Is the
Bob speed faster than the TurboBobs Ext? Also I don't suppose you can turn
the mouse pointer off outside of Amos using TGE?

Thanx once again! I'll send you The game when its finished if you want! Its
call DepTron... The Game is pretty simple! Its just got an interesting twist
( Where have i heard that before? ) I know there are enough Tron games
already, but I have so many different versions in my AmosProgs I though I
would compile them into one game... Then as i was doing this i came up with
another idea for Tron...! Is the Chunky System fast? Coz that would be very
usefull for the Demo I'm working on!

Bye For now! Phil!
Anything i can do for you?

The chunky is faster for games where the full screen completely changes,
like 3D games for example, as drawing pixels is dead slow!
like just a or.w #%1010101010101010,(a0) is dead slow, as its
writing to chipmem (yuk!)
where in chunky it writes to fastmem, and the C2P will covert it into
chip mem & planar, so it does turn out faster there.
Where as for 2d games like platformers you can use the blittler to draw
but then with rtg....

I might use kalms c2p routine, as its one of the best ive seen, its used
in loads of demos and some doom ports, also Im good friends with him
so getting permission shouldnt be too hard.

>Bye For now! Phil!

uhm, probably not atm. Unless do you know how to do a

but I dont want a 'plz insert volume GMS:' to pop up.

Im prepareing TGE for its first public release atm, a few days
ago I hit command 100(yayyy) I think at about 130 there will be a
release. Which will be a 0.9, then on the ADCD there will be
a MEGA demo, with FMV, rotating plasmas, dot tunnels, maybe light sourcing
and heaps of stuff, and CDDA music, and stuff.

Thats Why I haven't replied to those probs... Coz I don't know myself!

>What do you mean by Dos,Int,gfx and library calls.??!?!


Amos has some internal commands that don't need any extensions or any
extralibries because they call apon the system libraries...
These commands are called
Doscal (-X) - Has control over OS
IntCall (-X) - has Control over Intuition
GfxCall (-X) - Has Control over Graphics!
-X is the Library offset! Basically a library is a store of other peoples
code... Code that is very usefull... You need to know the offset in the
library to get the right bit of code! But I wouldn't try these commands out
as a begginer they are very powerfull and basically have no saftey
precautions so if you get it wrong... you crash! And me just talking about
this will just confuse things... Unless i'm completley wrong and you are a
very quick learner... But I know when i started I tried these commands and
just though they were put there so that you would RTFM (Thankyou! for
enlightening me! = P) and find nothing on these bloody commands! But if you
want I will explain in more detail!

I'm not surprised for some reason ( I think its because worms was programed
in it!)
people think blitz is better than Amos... Duh! hello! Why? i tried it got no
where in it after a week.... Found Amos..... Was doing fine in it in a few
days! And its not just that Blitz is for better programers because I went
back to it and now thanx to the understanding i have developed from Amos I
can uderstand it more.... But its still C**P! Mind my language... Not
AMOSPRO!

ps. I've just noticed that You use LightWave thats suposed to be good! Is it
better than Imagine? by the way I used Imagine on my old A600 with 2mb of
ram... So perhaps thats why it was so slow! But I still found it
unuserfreindly.... And i din't have a manual... I managed to create a box
with legs and a fish scene (Two tutorials that was in AF or something!) but
thats as far as i got! Great huh!

>What sort of speeds are you getting?

Okay! I'm guessing that this was to me! As no one else really seems to talk
about the calls! I only have a limited knowledge of Calls... I know more
GFXcalls than anything else.... And they seem to be pretty fast!

heres a list of someof the things that I can do with calls!

Open close Windows + Pub. Screens... Wow! Amazing huh?
refresh and redraw Windows + screens
DisplayBeep!
Plot on win + screen
Return the Colour of a Pixel(on a screen) (the same as the Amos Com.
Point(X,Y))
Draw, Bar, Box, and circle on Pub screens.
Clear Screen!
WriteText - I'm still tryin to figure the Flags for this one!
Return the WB + Screen + Window rastport
Make your own Guru Alert!
Execute a Program!

Okay! This may not sound like much.... but once you have the Rastport of a
screen you can do anything with that screen! Resize it... refresh it. Move
it. Change its palette... Close it (Amazing!) ... Put the Graphic Functions
to it!.... Load 256 col images! Read the mouse coords from any screen!

Some Progs I have that are in Sendable state are!
Load 256 col image to Pub Screen!
Grab the workbech Screen!
And my Tron game that uses a Pub screen! (This isn't finished yet tho!)

I can't think of anything else yet! It may not look like much on paper...
But it took me and Andi AAAAGGGGGEEEESSSSS to work them out manually! Thats
a lot of crashes! coz put the wrong param and Bye Bye Amiga!

I will send you these if you want? I Hope they will be of use....

Okay! Does anyone have any idea why the workbench screen and its bitplanes
is so strange... its set up totally different to any other screen! To Grab
it you have to read in one row of bytes... then jump rows*(depth of
BitPlanes) and read in again... and so on..... WEIRD!

Does anyone know how to load in libraries without Amos Crashing? At the
moment I am stuck just using the set Int Gfx and Dos! I don't suppose you do
jono?

I agree that it could be dangerous if you don't know how to use it. But I
disagree that it is unuseful.

f> Unuseful because with a good program structure you don't need it. That

One good place for using goto is exiting from nested loops. In Amos we can
Exit 2 or Exit 3 , I don't know for Pascal, but in C, there's no such
thing, and the best way to exit nested loops is to use goto.

A place where Goto could be useful in Amos is:

Procedure SOMEPROC
'a lot of init code
Do
'a lot of code
If SOMETHING
For I=WHATEVER To WHATEVER2
If SOMETHING_ELSE
Goto _EXIT
End If
Next
End If
'a lot of code
Loop
_EXIT:
'a lot of cleanup code
End Proc

Now, when you need to exit from procedure, you can't Pop Proc because that
would skip cleanup code, you can't Exit 2 because For loop is inside If
block, and you can't set some exit flag and use While instead of Do because
you have a lot of code which could do something unexpected. Even if you
could do something of that, in this case, Goto is most readable solution.

So, I would conclude, that Goto is bad, but sometimes it is neccesary :)

I spent a hundred quid on blitz, less than 50 on amos, and amos convincingly
wins, for a couple of blindingly stupid things in blitz.

One: Blitz insists on your procs being in order.
Two: Its as solid as a blancmange.

Oops, forgot to skip "a lot of code"

BTW, your code forgets to dereference the next, and the if, and the other
if, and the loop. You are relying on the "end proc" to close everything
down for you. Yuk.

Procedure SOMEPROC
'a lot of init code
Do
'a lot of code
If SOMETHING
For I=WHATEVER To WHATEVER2
If SOMETHING_ELSE
i=whatever2
skip=true
End If
Next
End If
if not skip
'a lot of code
end if
Loop
'a lot of cleanup code
End Proc

Which is a horrible way of writing code, but its better than the goto, as
everythng is closed down cleanly. I have had to debug other peoples work
before, and people make such a mess.... The dominant code in your loop
is a "lot of code", rather than the use of a goto, which is a conditional
chunk, so rewrite the condition out of the loop, or seperate your loops.
Why are you putting so much in ONE procedure ? Would it be easier to
seperate them out perhaps ? Now your excercise for today is to rewrite
your loop nice and cleanly with the code to skip outside the loop.

:-P

Next goto for me to kill please..

Goto is useless.

Exactly!! Keith, have you been looking at my code again?! This is
the same method I use to break out of loops, whether they be in
BASIC, C or whatever... it is logical and safe.


> Goto is useless.

Well, I wouldn't say it is completely useless, but completely
unnecessary... hmm, I guess that sort of equals the same thing in the
end, doesn't it. haha. :)

Anyway, someone was asking about Goto and why they are advised
not to use it...
Goto is a throwback to the first programming languages, there was a
time when Goto was the ONLY command we had for passing control
around a program. As the size and complexity of programs
increased, Goto became increasingly more cumbersome to work with
and introduced what is known as Spaghetti Code, not a good thing.

A major evolution occured which was the dawn of structured
programming, definitely a good thing. These languages added
powerful contol structures such as Repeat...Until, While...Wend, etc.
all things which programmers were previously forced to implement
by relying on Goto...

Anyway, that's about the way I remember it... I can remember being
so amazed when I was first exposed to a While... Wend loop
structure and real procedures... radical stuff at that time. This was
before they were commonly accepted, but it was obvious they were
preferable to Goto!!!

Lightwave is superb.. much much easier than Imagine.

If you want I'll send you an example of my Lw work

Yeah an FPU makes an enormous difference, and some software won't
even work without one. (without an FPU you lose loads of rendering
speed and you can't use things like Forge and Texture Studio.
also you can only use approx 8 of Imagine's 120+ procedural
textures as they require an FPU.)

For my next trick, this is how to implement a looping on/off thing
without messing about much.

while 1
a=1-a
print a
wend

Well, I suppose you could use it to scramble code, make it unreadable,
jump all over the place and fill the stack with unreturned values,
crash the system with an illegal call and suddenly return to the
wrong part of the program when you finally pop the stack...

I would strongly advise putting your conditional tests at the beginning
with while...wend as opposed to repeat...until. Trust me. You have
a lot more control over while/wend. Repeat/until is only usefull if
you absolutely, positively, HAVE to run a loop at LEAST once.

If you don't mean 'load in' the same way in which 'Lib Open' works then I

FORTRAN Gotos

Tue Oct 6, 1998 12:35 am
<pbrowne@qantas.com.au>


Hi all,

I have to add my two cents on the GOTO debate.

I use FORTRAN at work, and it's probably the most widely used command in
our entire system. I must confess to using GOTO's regularly in my FORTRAN
code (I tried once to go without it, but it's amazing how ugly and
unreadable to code becomes (and inefficient!) when everything is
conditional). DO loops are the main culprit, as jumping out of the loop is
much better than letting the loop complete until it's end (DO loops are NOT
conditional in FORTRAN - at least not the version of FORTRAN I use).

However, in all my playing around with AMOS, I think I used a GOTO once -
and only as a simple debugging tool that I discarded once I had my problem
solved. The Conditional Loops available in AMOS are good. They make
things much easier and more "structured".

So kiddies, don't use GOTO's unless the alternative is worse or
non-existent. In AMOS, I don't really see the need at all.

Phil 8-)

p.s: For your consideration: is an Exit command just as bad as a GOTO?
(Probably not, now that I think of it, as GOTO's can go BACKWARDS... which
is what makes them REALLY bad if misused!)

Amos 3D - OM

Tue Oct 6, 1998 1:24 am
<pbrowne@qantas.com.au>


Hello again,

I need some help. I tried to use OM (the Object Modeller for Amos 3D) on
my A3000 last night... and it doesn't work! (I get a flickering mess of a
screen that just doesn't WORK). It's been a while since I last used it,
probably before I upgraded to OS3.1 - I think that's the problem. However,
I remember long, long ago when it first came out, that to run OM on an
A3000 (or maybe just WB2.x) something needed to be done in the
startup-sequence. Of course, I cannot remember what this was!!! Can
anyone remember? Does anybody know what I can do?

I really want to start using Amos 3D again - I know it's slow, but I think
that with some thought, it's features can be exploited usefully. If worse
comes to worse I can do my modelling on my A500 - but it's a hassle
transferring back and forth...

Thanks to anyone who can help me!

Phil 8-)

Haha... and there you have it from Braneloc, The Amazing himself.

What is it with all of these numeric literals... I prefer something
like...

NOTDONE=True
While NOTDONE
A=1-A
Print A
' ...Insert conditional check for exiting loop here
Wend

The problem is that you are going to have people saying "well, you
just don't know how to use Goto effectively... if you're really GOOD,
I mean a REALLY REALLY GOOD programmer like me then you can
use Goto without causing all of those problems!!"... haha.

Not to mention that if you move to C or C++ there is no direct
replacement for Repeat...Until, but there is the same old While...
Wend structure. Of course, you can use Do...While in C/C++, but the
logic is reversed. Actually, I have always found Repeat...Until to be
quite effective in AMOS, but you do need to keep in mind that
your code will be executed a minimum of one time, as Keith has
pointed out.

And there you have it... your weekly lesson in entertainment and
good programming practice brought to you by Keith Hill, floquet and

Dear all,

Im sick and tired of everyone bitching about how crap Blitz is in comparison to
Amos, first of all you obviously havent used blitz to come to that conclusion
and secondly you obviously havent used amos enough to know its limitations.

Blitz's strength is its compiler and integrated AGA and intution support, not to
mention messing with DMA, its biggest draw back is its documentation and its
poor editor.

Amos's strength is its easy to use editor and almost crash free environment, its
drawback is its poor performance.

All programming tools have their strengths and weaknesses, put their strengths
to good use!!!!!

Is this true? (no pun intended...)

That would have to be a serious bug in the compiler!

Well, that's go to apply to AMOS only because it is common practice to
define TRUE and FALSE as constants in other languages... Weird,
how many little bugs like this are found in AMOS...

Its other biggest drawback is lack of forward declarations and other missing
concepts. It does have powerful features, is slightly faster, and has
genuine aga, but you have to really study to use it, and the code only works
on most machines, most of the time. I spent a lot of time and money on blitz,
and it can't even do some of the most basic concepts, and that just drives me
nuts. If you think I havn't used blitz, why is my suggestion at the top of
the blitz things to do list ? Ah well.

..and is old, one or two of the commands are a bit buggy, and one or two of
the commands don't compile properly. As a real programmer, I can work round
and bypass the limitations of amos, but without the facilities in blitz,
if it won't allow you to program cleanly, how can you bypass the problems ?

I suppose I just want my hundred quid back.

No. First there Is a concept called "the stack". Program jumps like gosub
or procedure calls put temporary variables here in a fifo format, and the
"return address" of all calls is put here. Goto bypasses this, allowing you
to jump anywhere and do anything, but does nothing with the stack, hence
all of a sudden error messages if you are not carefull. Exit uses the stack,
and pops out of the loop by artificially popping the stack and returning to
the correct point in the program.

That was a public information broadcast.

Are you talking about me? Well, I'm not a really really good programmer
speaking both about my programs and amount of theory I know (very little).
But I don't want to be dogmatic about anything, and if I couldn't think of
a good example for Goto, I would probably reply that there might be some
cases where Goto is usable, but I don't know them. Have you seen all
programs in the world, so that you can tell that there is not a single
usable Goto in them?

BTW, goto for exiting from nested loops is *recommended* for use in C by
authors of C themselves. I have tried it, and I agree about that.

BTW2, I still don't know how to exit nested loops in Pascal...

That logic has always confused me, and for a long time I wasnt sure will
Repeat Until condition be looped if condition is true or false. Bwyatt in
POP had
a solution to this:

Do While
Loop

Do
Loop While

Do Until
Loop

Do
Loop Until

You could even make combinations like:

Do While
Loop Until

We should convince him to continue work ;)

So? End Proc can do that. Tell me honest, if you were doing something like

Why do you use this instead of Exit? It doesn't skip any code you might

But that code has to be inside a loop. And loop had more exits except this

Hi there!

Okay cool! I have to wait then... oh it looks like i was too slow to answer
you last one andrew got there before me! How do you go about writing an
extension? do you have to have extensive knowledge of Asm? And with using
Asembler how do you get graphics on to the Amos Screens.... you must need
the Rastport or something? so how do you get it in asm? do you use a call?
Actually you would need to get a whole load of information of Amos to get
the commands working alongs side? so how is it done?

Sorry for askin somany questions i'm just curious.. as I would love to make
my own extension... It would be to do with Maths and Graphics! And lots of
different versions of the Copy command.. to give more control with the data
that is being moved? I mean it would make things so much easyier..
especially when manipulating Bitplanes to have a copy command that doesn't
write the 0's coz then you would have a masked copy! etc. Also a Better
Polygon command.... one that uses a proper polygontable and Flags! or maybe
a polygon to and a poly end command coz a the moment the problem is you have
to set the data the polygon uses at the beginning of the prog and that
amount of sides i fixed when ever you run the prog...
but you cant build a pollygon like this!...

for i=0 to 100
polgon to x(i),y(i)
next i

Somethin like this would be good!

Start polygon 1
for i=0 ti 100
polygon 1,x(i),y(i)
Anyway thanx? Till next time! Phil
End Polygon 1
Draw plolygon 1

or to be able to create a polygontable and get a command to use the table!
Do you have any ideas how i could learn to make an extension? Docs? or
source code? or should i just go write a 'Hello world' program coz an ext.
is way out of my league?

Bye! Phil!

Book Swap..!?!

Tue Oct 6, 1998 2:40 pm
Stephen Thornber <SThornber@steve1.demon.co.uk>


Hi all


I was given an Amos book yesterday by a friend, but the book is
way over my head and only deals with games.

I'm wondering if anyone has a good amos book they wish to swap
for mine..?

I'm paticularly looking for Amiga Formats "Ultimate Amos"
by Jason Holborn

but any other good amos book would do.?

My book is called "Amiga Game Makers Manual" by
Stephen Hill.

(published by Sigma Press)

its 400 pages and it is in prefect condition, not a curled
page or a tear anywhere.

BTW - I live in Blackpool, Lancs, UK


Steve.

Arise Sir Floquet! It isn't that hard It started off hard by
peeking,pokeing,dokeing,deeking,loking,and leeking at the places which would
be logical... You need to have an understanding of how the Amiga works
really!
but then I managed to get hold of The Official Library Includes and they
helped by telling the offsets and the params... but you still need to work
things out... I'll try and compile a list of the useful ones and send it to
you... but I started off by trial and error so it can't be that hard!

Ps. If you ever want Dma to the Amos Screens the Answers in the Logbase!


Us? theres more than one of you?

Cool! I agree with Nikola... it can be useful I don't use it but it can
be... So now thats been sorted pehaps this argument about a simple stupid
command could stop!
I don't like the if statement but hey! Its usefull but it is quite slow! I
think Amos should have a Case statement too!

"Oh leave me alone..... I'm walkin out of the door..... Leave me alone!"
- Natalie Imbruglia! Coz it what i'm listening to!
- What you don't realise is that Natalie was singing about a Certain command
in Amos!

Try this:

Add a,2^2

In my opinon should give a=4 and b=4, right?

I get a=-2147483325 and b=4!

Well, in a previous post I said that I don't think Goto is completely
useless, but rather it is completely unnecessary due to advances in
programming languages. It's another question whether being
unnecessary equals useless. It's all a matter of style really... of
course you could use Goto in loads of places and anyone is obviously
free to do so, but some of us are simply saying there are better ways
to handle this... for every place someone might use a Goto, we could
provide a "non-Goto" (copyright 1998 Garfield Benjamin) solution.


> Have you seen all programs in the world, so that you can tell that
> there is not a single usable Goto in them?

As a matter of fact I have... haha. Of course I have not seen every
program in the world, but then I do not need to. I have seen and
written enough programs to know there is always an elegant
solution to replace a section of code relying on Goto.

It's really a matter of preference and programming is a very personal
thing... we each have our own style to a degree and no one can say
what is right or wrong for someone else, we only know what is
right for ourselves. However, there are certain aspects of
programming which are universally true and structured programming
or object oriented programming introduced new methods which are
"better" in many ways.

Wow, I haven't used Pascal in a long time... from what I remember,
it was a very nice language... kind of a cross between BASIC and C.

Why not simply set your loop variables to equal the EndLoop states?
Example in AMOS code ( to help us stay focused )

For REP1=1 To 10
For REP2=1 To 100
For REP3=1 To 1000
If NEEDTOEXIT
REP3=1001 : REP2=101 : REP1=11
End If
Next REP3
Next REP2
Next REP1

That's the method I use in AMOS, BLITZ, C, etc. Of course, you can
Pop out of AMOS and BLITZ's loop I believe, but I have always found
it's easier to find a good solution then stick to it... that's part of
the benefit of choosing the "right" solution... it is 100% portable
between languages.

Haha... yes, Ben is a clever guy. Hmm... that idea about the
combination looks a bit strange, now doesn't it? We have a Do While
loop condition at the top combined with a Repeat Until condition at
the bottom... very unique. Ben what were you thinking there? Was
this simply to illustrate that the programmer has complete flexibility??

Okay, this has been interesting... talking about programming style is
always a good thing, but we better stop and get back to pure AMOS,
and I think that's where this thread began... :-)

To make a extension you will need:

a assembler (get phxass off aminet)
|Music.s (AMOSPro_Tutorial:Extensions/)
and thats it.

Read |Music.s, its the source for the (useless) music extension,
it has all of the extra amos functions and macro definitions and stuff.

you'll need some knowledge of assembly, |music.s
and all amos extensions are compiled with GenAm,
which is crap compared to Phxass.

Phxass does everything that GenAm does, but its much faster
at compiling, for example, it takes GenAm about 10secs to compile
TGE, and PhxAss would do it in about 2secs.

I'll help you with any probs you encounter with extension coding 8)

I wouldnt say that, you just need to know move.l 8)
and things like shifting, swapping and stuff, its
all pretty basic, it just is harder to debug 8)
heres a tip tho that I used when coding TGE:
Dont Write Bugs.

it saves hours of time 8o)

Hi all.

Well after having AmosPro for just about 5 days, I'm 100% hooked on it.
I may not be the fastest learner and my code may look sloppy to
most of you, but hey.... this is FUN..!!

For the past 5 days, every spare few minutes I get, I've been
hammering away at AmosPro, hey, I'm enjoying this.... :)

(although my fiancee isn't too happy ;)

I know this mail is mainly a waste of time/space, but I just
wanted to tell you all I'm having fun, and I'll be on this list
for a very long time to come.. :)

I think we have a genuine programmer here... if this isn't the
trademark of a great programmer trying to "break out", I don't what
is...

Haha... you have hit on AMOS's greatest strength... I have written
programs in many languages and across several machines, but
there is something about AMOS that actually makes it that much
more enjoyable (although more frustrating at times also... haha).

Um, I don't mean to be critical of your code, and please correct me if I'm

No problem... you can be critical... haha. Well, I don't know what
to tell you other than I have always done this and never
encountered any problems...

Perhaps there is some weird aspect of FORTRAN which makes it
a "No-No", but that really makes little sense... why not try it in
FORTRAN, after all manuals are known to be inaccurate from time to
time... :-)

Anyway, I'd be interested in hearing what happens... I can't imagine
why you couldn't use this method, it works in every other language
I've tried. I mean you're only changing the value of a variable, it
doesn't matter whether it's used in a loop or not... again, unless
FORTRAN is doing something really strange.

I know of several free e-mail providers if you need some. You might want to
try Net@ddress (http://netaddress.usa.net), which I use. They're both a Web

Another good one is iName, and of course almost every search engine under

OK, just quickly 'cause I'm supposed to be WORKING ;) , I re-read my
manual, where it states quite clearly...

"the DO-variable of the DO-loop can neither be redefined nor become
undefined during execution of the range of the DO-loop. It is your
responsibility to ensure that such redefinitions don't occur."

Ignoring this, I tried to alter the DO-variable as you suggested, but the
compiler didn't like that one bit! ...

DO 1501 II = 1 , 12
II = 13
1501 CONTINUE
*ERROR 1902 at line 550 Assignment result 'II' is an active DO variable

So, it seems the responsibility wasn't mine at all! :) (as mentioned in
the manual).

Silly bloody thing... but that's FORTRAN for you! When I started work here
8 years ago, I already thought FORTRAN was dead... and I'm STILL coding in
it!!!

I can only hope AMOS lasts as long!

Very interesting... I wonder why it won't allow it? Anyway, I'm glad
you tried this as I would not have believed it... haha. As they say,
you learn something new everyday. :-)

Yes, I thought FORTRAN was dead... haha. It's really amazing how
COBOL keeps hanging in there and actually appears to be growing
in popularity.

Well, thanks again for sharing that... perhaps the loop problem is
caused because FORTRAN is such an old language and they probably
thought that actually changing the loop variable was too advanced
or something... remember at the time FORTRAN came out, our
industry was very, very young and basically, the knowledge that
people had was pretty limited compared to now. Haha.

Whoa, hold on. Why shouldnt we discuss Amos programming? I'm learning stuff
here!

Those correspondents who maybe work in computer programming can be a bit
high and mighty. Amos on the Amiga was for me the next generation of
hobbyist programming after the BBC micro and BBC basic. I missed that phase
but I have been hope & poking around with Amos for quite a few years. I'm
probably never going to create commercial software, ( oh all right, I'm
NEVER going to. See my Othello game on CUAmiga CD(26?) if you dont believe
me!! ). I just love the programming experience. I have no contact with other
programmers, other than here and have learnt all I can from the Amos manual.
You will gather that there are areas of skill that I havnt picked up. I have
been studying the program snippets in this correspondence and trying to
understand them. Please remember that there must be other readers at the
same stage as myself. Thank you all for your patience.

(Yet Another Message About Goto) 8)

Hello,
Here are some personal opinions:

Concerning the trick consisting of changing the value of the iterator in
the loop is... a trick !
You'd better use this:

I=MINVALUE
COND=False
While (Not COND) and (I <= MAXVALUE)
'(code setting somewhere COND to True)
Add I, MYSTEPVALUE
Wend

I've been a professional programmer for more than 10 years. Understand
"I'm paid for this" and not "I am a genius" 8))
I've been programming for more than 15 years.
Computing is a science. So there are rules to be respected. When I was
studying comp-science, no teacher told us about GOTO.
I don't intend to teach you how to do, but there are 4 main structures
used in programming, in EVERY language :
- The sequence : Some instructions one after the other
- The condition : If/Then/Else/Endif
- The unconditional loop : For/Next
- The onditional loop : While/Wend or Repeat/Until.
A code respecting these structures can be easyly ported into another
language (Amos->C, QBASIC->Amos, Amos->DbaseIII, etc...)
There is no place for Goto in these structures, except for low-level
languages, where you need to convert:
REPEAT LABEL1:
blabla >>Into>> blabla
UNTIL CONDITION IF not CONDITION GOTO LABEL1

Concerning EXITs, POP PROCs and other ways to quit a loop, a program (or
procedure, subroutine,etc) must have a beginning, a body and an end.
Using Exits or Pop procs don't allow the end of a procedure where you
could do some interesting things.

You can find the equivalent in other professions:
For example, you can put at home a wallpaper upon another, but pros
don't, they remove the old one before. The result is the same : You get
a blue room.

You are FREE to use gotos, I don't want to disgust you (all) from using
Amiga & Amos. Hobbyists are not bad programmers because they use GOTOs.
Pros just prefer to use the good old rules. Experience shows that a prog
without GOTOs is easier to debug or enhance. It works better, too,
because you _have_to_ analyse your needs before coding.

One last thing : Even some Pros use Gotos !

I apologise for being long, but I had to say that.

Hi Andrew!

I found your "version" code, fascinating.
and I'm currently coding a gui front end for it, which also
uses the asl file requester.

(I'm crediting you for the main code, I hope you don't mind me
altering it..? - I hate the amos file requester.)

I should have it tested/finished and compiled in a day or so.
would you like a copy of it when its done..?
(it'll only be somthing like 25k..?)

BTW - I'm hoping to incorporate a progress bar in the gui,
so you can tell how far it has searched through the file
you picked. but it may be too hard to do..? anyway, I'll try.

okay this is still on the subject of Variable errors but not to do with the
add function!
I Think either My AmosPro 2.00 has gone strange, I'm going strange or I have
A Virus! Coz Everytime I try a load Amos now it loads okay but all my progs
and the commands are doing very strange things! For example I run a
program... The program runs... it runs fine... i exit the program... The
program exits... return to Editor and my whole program has bits of Machine
code and Jibberish in it!

Also Normally when you type:

Print A

and A is'nt define... it returns a 0 but now all my variables Have strange
numbers and don't start off at 0! For example

A=-32655
B=12
c$= Now this string caused Amos to Spill out the whole contents of my memory
to the screen!

And then Sometimes I just get straight forward... AMOS HAS CRASHED!

the reason for all these weird things... I think is that something is
illegally poking Memory... It is poking over the stored locations of the
variables and is just filling them with Jibberish! That would explain the C$
printing out memory coz it doesn't have a CHR$(0) at the end of the variable
contents!

Or something is chaning Amos's pointers so that everything pointing to the
wrong things! This could be done by a Virus Quite Easily....

also Serval times i have had a small little box of fuzz apear at the corner
of workbench.. just like something was Poking dircetly to the Logbases and
BitPlanes of the screen! can anyone suggest some thing else coz i can't seem
to find the Virus! so perhaps it isn't... i dunno but i have to sort it now!
Otherwise i can't send things to people here or work on amosprojects!

Bye! Phil! I'm Having fun here! NO REALLY! (Sarcasm!)

Any ideas?

Not to bother your project, but why don't you just use the CLI command
Version? You could just make a Version button in your DOpus, which would then
tell the version number of your selected files.

Due to my experience this is not the whole truth. I believe you have problems
when you do:

If NOTDONE

This will go crazy when compiled

If NOTDONE=True

Works however. The two lines should do exactly the same thing, but they don't
when being compiled.

Exactly... I agree. I generally use a While structure... they are made
to allow premature exiting, so to speak. In AMOS, of course you can
use Repeat... Until in the same manner.

Because, I'm pretty sure that Pascal doesn't support that... haha.

The original poster said he was unable to find a way to exit from nested
loops in Pascal... I have found that the above works fine BASIC, C and
C++, and obviously Assembler.

However, it is worth mentioning that you should rely on one of the While
or even Repeat loop structures if you are planning on prematurely
exiting the loops, they were designed to handle that.

Uhm, If you can't use libs then I advise you not to touch extension
coding for the time been 8o)
You'll need a much bigger and complex understanding of the amigas chips,
the CPU you code for( TGE is coded for 030...) and you'll need librarys
the whole time, espically exec. All the librarys you'll need will be
in the ROMS, so no files will be needed.

PS: Although Ive said TGE is coded for 030, it works on 000 but
030 for best performance on the tmapping and such(complex gfx).

Hang on a sec! Thats right I get that bug too! WEIRD!

Also Does anyone know where these commands come from! The thing is I don't
know wether they are from an extension or actuall amos Commands that aren't
listed in the help file!

Follow
Check

I don't know thier sytax... And i have no idea what they do but Amos will
except Follow as it is! But if you run this command Amos returns a Sytax
error while the prog is running? WEIRD! = 7

I also thought this was a command to...

Remove

But all it is is a Rem statement of ove
same as!!!
'ove

I can use libs... I know exactly how to use them... in several languages..
But the Command just doesn't seem to work! For me anyway! I can use Libs in
asm. Easily!
So don't worry! Oh and I do know a bit about the Chips.. I know more about
how the software that uses the chips.. As I'm more into software than
Hardware... But I seem to find I learn more by doing it... So as long as i
can practice... I can learn!

I mean i knew nothing about Libraries and I couldn't understand any asm.
books i got really, but i got as far as i needed from working things out for
myself.. I found this also help with me remembering the stuff 2! Thats the
one thing that annoys me around where i live is that no one really like
computers or programing so i've got no one to compare with so i don't know
if i am any good! I just think that i want to move on to some more
interesting stuff!

Well I use Exec the most! Move.L $4,A6!!!!!
I know how to use those libraries quite happily!
the thing is to learn how to use extra libraries i need the includes which i
don't have... I have the main includes But nothin else....
So please don't strike me off A someguy who doesn't know what hes doing coz
i think i do! Okay I'm not the Best but i'm not the worst!
Its just so long since i've done any asm. i just have to get back into it!

I know I could do it that easy, but I'm doing it with AmosPro and
the gui extension for several reasons.

1:- I'm a newbie to Amos, so this is experience for me.

2:- I'm learning the how to use the gui extension

3:- Hey I'm having fun, don't spoil it. ;)

If you baught AMOSPro you got the disk..if not you didnt...
also if you baught amos pro you get the entire manual built-in,
and a example demos of every command.

I think platon released better source, I'll send you it.

how could you use DevPac without hearing of genam ?!?!?!?!?!!?

like when you by devpac you get:

graphics.library/Text

NAME
Text -- Write text characters (no formatting).

SYNOPSIS
Text(rp, string, length)
A1 A0 D0-0:16

void Text(struct RastPort *, STRPTR, WORD);

FUNCTION
This graphics function writes printable text characters to the
specified RastPort at the current position. No control meaning
is applied to any of the characters, thus only text on the
current line is output.

The current position in the RastPort is updated to the next
character position.
If the characters displayed run past the RastPort boundary,
the current position is truncated to the boundary, and
thus does not equal the old position plus the text length.

INPUTS
rp - a pointer to the RastPort which describes where the
text is to be output
string - the address of string to output
length - the number of characters in the string.
If zero, there are no characters to be output.

Could you make list of things that could be easily done with lib calls and
send it to Aminet? Also you could make a guide on how to call some function
of some library. I know almost everything, except how to find function
offsets. I know that there is such list for Blitz...

Stacey Abshire <sabshire@kanawhascales.com>


Do you guys have nothing better to do? When it all comes right down to it,
EVERY program that has any sort of loop structure has a GOTO in it. Whether
it is a WHILE loop with the WEND GOTO, or whether it is a FOR loop with the
NEXT GOTO, etc, etc, etc... SO can we stop? This is boring, and most
uninformative.

It is better to have tried and failed than to have failed to try, but the
result's the same.

yep, it will preform a bit better than the 030@50 as it does dual cpu cycles
but the 030(single cycle) would be a bit slower, the 040 woul d do it in about
1.2-1.5 times faster

un-iconify

Stephen Thornber <SThornber@steve1.demon.co.uk>


Hi all

I still can't read the damn close gadget when my prog is
iconified.. I've treid reading the docs, but no help there.

my code is:-

Gui Iconify(1)
Do
GW=Gui Wait
If GW=-1
Gui Uniconify(1)
EndIf
Loop

But it doesn't work :(

It iconify's great, but won't uniconify.. doh!

> Stacey Abshire commented:

Not true, which is precisely why this discussion is so valuable...
Every GOTO is a jump, but not every jump is a GOTO.

> Whether it is a WHILE loop with the WEND GOTO, or whether it is a FOR loop
> with the NEXT GOTO, etc, etc, etc...

Aaarghhhhhhhh!!! Loop constructs *don`t* GOTO, they JUMP. A GOTO is
a programmer-defined jump to any point in the program, a loop
construct jump can *only* jump back to the start of the construct.
And since GOTO gives us that much power, we can use it to do some
highly stupid things...

Consider this perfectly legal piece of AMOS code:

A
1 Stop

Procedure A
B
2 Goto 1
End Proc

Procedure B
Goto 2
End Proc


This is, quite simply, an appalingly bad piece of code. And only
GOTO makes it possible... Now, whilst no-one in their right mind
would ever write a piece of code that was so obviously wrong, if
you`re developing a long program with GOTOs, then it`s possible that
you might inadvertantly create something with the same structure. If
you don`t use GOTO, it`s impossible to make this mistake.

> This is boring, and most uninformative.

It`ll be uninformative once everyone is aware of the problems that
GOTO introduces, not before...

Fact is, with the exception of certain languages that have no
alternative, the use of GOTO (or the equivalent command) is shunned
by any serious programmer, with good reason. We`re not making this
up, GOTO really is a dangerous command when misused, and it`s all too
easy to accidentally misuse it.

Why not using the FD extension???????

You don't need to know the functions offsets and registers.... you can use
in-line code and the function name like:

T=Lvo Text(RP,ST,L)

instead of:

Areg(1)=RP : Areg(0)=varptr(T$) : Dreg(0)=Len(A$) : T=GfxCall(-xxx)

Read the doc carefully :))) Expecially the Gui Wait command.

When a GUI is iconified, if you press the close gadget Gui Wait returns -6
(..uniconify message) and not -1.

so your code is:

Gui Iconify(1)
Do
GW=Gui Wait
If GW=-6
Gui Uniconify(1)
EndIf
Loop

> It iconify's great, but won't uniconify.. doh!

Nope :) Enoy.... the GUI Extension V2 will offer TRUE iconify using AppIcons
and a Iconify gadget in the window title bar like MUI.

The key word here is "misuse". I find GOTO a pretty useful command but only
for short jumps to skip a couple of lines of code and agree that it can get
very messy if "misused".

I don't guess you have used assembly have you? And when it comes down to
it, your AMOS code, C code, Pascal, or whatever, will use in essence a GOTO.
A JMP command is a GOTO. I am condoning GOTO at all. I just think that
this is a useless discussion.

I bought a load of stuff off a Guy... He was selling games, AmosPro! so I
bought it off him! But I didn't get AMOSPro_Tutorial:! I've got Loads of
examples and (back at the beggining! )i also bought the AmigaFormat book
Ultimate AMOS which came with a Disk called AMOS_BOOK: which had every
example under the sun!

So perhaps thats why i never got the disk! The guy must have forgot! = /

I could never find a way of disabling Casesensitivity in Devpac! but i see
what you mean about that in PhxASS!

Oh! And I have Downloaded PhxAss! Along with the Gui prog I found! But
Evertime I i use the Gui it says Wrong number of Arguments... Even when I
think i have put every Argument! This may just be the Gui Prog! I dunno..!
What are the minimum arguments PhxAss needs coz In the manual it says Input
and Output.. (Unless i'm reading it wrong) But when i type "PhxAss
Hd1:PhxAss/Examples/Phil.Asm Ram:Phils.o" it say wrong number of arguments!
Do you have to type out all the arguments evertime you need to use it?

And why do some of the Files say PhxAss and others say PhyAss?????

>just turn case sensitivity off 8o)
>only in E you have to use case sensitivity.


And Devpac... I think?
And some Pascal Compilers too! They are reaaallly C**p though!

> string - the address of string to output
> length - the number of characters in the string.
> If zero, there are no characters to be output.

oh! Thanx! But I just found the include with that in yesterday so i know how
to do it.... but good description! Is that yours or is it from somewhere
else? So How much do you know when it comes to libraries?
i don't suppose you know how to put bobs to the screen? Actually don't tell
me I like working things out for myself, I seem to learnmore that way!!

Does this speed up using the function because Using Areg(0) and all that
slows it all down? I've tried usind FD lib but i can't get it to work

There is a command: Gui Writing x
This is sets the writing mode. It seems to you have a writing mode with
XOR, so the empty points not printed.
Use the Gui Writing %001, and you can print spaces.

But, why not use a text gadget, for your output. It is a more elegant way.

O.k. You are right about the importance of a good manual, but the quality
of the manual
not equal to the quality of the thing, which described in it.

I don't need any flame, but I think Blitz Basic is more closer to the Amiga
OS, than Amos.
I'm using more often Amos, because I have more experiences with it. This is
my only reason.

So keep the Amos discussion! Leave the Blitz critics to the Blitzlist.

Well, I have been programming for about 17 years now and I have met numerous
female programmers. And mind you, many of them were quite competent in the
field dominated by us males. So for the females, I think that they deserve

I don't know but when I wanted to use temporary arrays, I use the fact
that procedures have local variables, so I declare my arrays at the
begining of the proc and end the proc when I want to erase them.
Yes, it's not a good way to have nice code but that can help !

You are very very right to mention that females are as competent as males in
the field of programming (and in every other field of course), so I wish to
commend you for abiding by the rules of political correctness, to which
everybody on this list and everywhere should submit immediately.

BUT you omitted to stress the fact that BLACK female programmers are as good
and competent as white male programmers, and this is a *very very suspect*
omission. Do you want to imply that black female programmers are inferior in
some way? Now this will not do.

I must remind you of the only unquestionable truth on this earth, which is
that all individuals are absolutely equal in every domain. Moreover, you
should realize that black females are creditable for 99% of major scientific,
medical and cultural achievements on this planet. Or at least they would, if
they had not been oppressed by dominant fascist phallocratic white males.

So I want rounds of applause for BLACK FEMALE PROGRAMMERS immediately,
otherwise I shall denounce everybody on this list to Ted Turner, Jane Fonda
and every respectable autority among the Thought Police, and then all of you
ignorant white racist sexist nazi phallocratic programmers will be castrated
at once.

And now I want to see many, many messages of self-flagellation from repentant
former white male oppressors.

With my best politically correct regards,

Bernadette

Wrong. And it`s partly because I have used asm that I know what a
misused "goto" can do to a program. When you have to take care of
the stack yourself, you get pretty paranoid about making sure your
program flow between subroutines is absolutely correct. And if you
could have seen some of the convoluted student code I`ve had to try
sorting out in asm practical sessions, you`d know why I`m so against
the use of arbitrary leaps from A to B, such as GOTO permits.

Even in asm, it`s quite easy to think in terms of WHILE WEND or
whatever, and write your loops accordingly. That you`re using a jmp
or a bgt or a dbne or whatever is beside the point - you as the
programmer *know* what that jump represents. It`s when you start
using branch/jump commands without them mapping onto some higher
construct that the problems start - in other words, when you start
using them as if they were GOTO`s...
I can`t recall the last time I ever used a branch in asm without it
being part of such a higher construct, just as I can`t recall the
last time I ever used GOTO in AMOS (examples of GOTO misuse aside :-)

The point I was trying to make with that GOTO/jump comment earlier is
that you as the programmer don`t use GOTO to return to the start of a
loop in AMOS, you use WEND, UNTIL, NEXT etc. They`re all jumps, but
they`re not all GOTO`s. You *only* use GOTO if you want to introduce
a jump that has no other purpose in life other than to jump
unconditionally from A to B - it isn`t part of a loop, it isn`t part
of a subroutine call, it`s just a jump. And in all the languages I`m
familiar with, there is NO good software-related excuse for doing
this. Hardware limitations may be an excuse, but not in AMOS`s case.

> it, your AMOS code, C code, Pascal, or whatever, will use in essence a
> GOTO. A JMP command is a GOTO.

Only if you choose to use it like that, and it`s also (when combined
with other mnemonics) a WEND, UNTIL, NEXT etc. OTOH, there`s no need
to combine GOTO with other commands in AMOS to achieve a WEND or
whatever, because the language already provides those commands
directly. So the only thing that GOTO is good for is unstructured
leaping around, which is bad.

JMP *can* do the same, but it doesn`t *have* to. And unless they`ve
got a superb reason for doing so (embedded controller programming
with limited memory springs to mind here), any semi-competent asm
programmer isn`t going to use JMP as a GOTO, because poor programming
style is poor programming style, no matter what language you`re
using.


> I am condoning GOTO at all.

I really hope you left out the "not" in that comment.

> I just think that this is a useless discussion.

I wish it was, but there still seems to be a little bit too much
confusion over exactly what GOTO entails for the thread to die down.

I dunno yet, I'll check that. If you want to clear the input buffer,
just do a SERIAL CLOSE and SERIAL OPEN.
Do the same if you want to suspend temporary reading the serial port.

> Serial Check() works for Serial Send, what checks the serial status for Serial

Nothing.

I have a question, too :
Is it possible to replace "SERIAL SEND 1,a$" with a bank instead of the
string. Not the whole bank, of course !
I would like another solution than:
For I=0 To NBBYTES-1
X=Peek(Start(MYBANK))+I
Serial Send 1,Chr$(X)
Next I
(I'm searching for a faster solution)

The DevPac editor is rubbish, your best off to use CED or GoldED,
and just assemble with genam. when using genam just do a:
genam <srcfile> nocase
it wont be case sensitive.

OM functioning

Thu Oct 15, 1998 4:55 am
<pbrowne@qantas.com.au>


Hi again,

I'd just like to that Declan for passing on the OM coverdisk - it seems to
work just fine on the old A3000, so life will be a bit easier for me now
(no more passing disks between my A500 and A3000 !!)

In my playing around with Amos3D, I've already noticed some speed problems
and am having to compromise a little on detail to gain that little extra
oomph. But I'm quite pleased with what I DO have thus far. (If anyone's
interested: its gunna be a little 3D-type shoot'em'up based on the old
"War Of The Worlds" film from the '50's (plus some help from Jeff Wayne's
musical rendition) - I just love that HeatRay!

The OM (Object Modeller) is remarkably good, considering - I'd forgotten
just how easy it is to pick up the basics of it's use and produce quite
GOOD results! Naturally it isn't perfect, and some things are very
difficult to achieve (just FORGET about curved surfaces!) and it has
crashed my A500 numerous times (but I'm pretty sure that's related to an
old screen blanker (Blankette?) that I still use).

Anyway, that's it for now... I just wanted to post something totally
unrelated to GOTO's and unnecessary file attachments!

Wish me luck!

Phil 8-)

AMOS Pro & MUI

Thu Oct 15, 1998 9:13 am
"Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>


Has anyone worked successfully with MUI interfaces in AMOS Pro? Is it
possible?
My next project requires more of a GUI than the standard workbench GUI has
to offer and I am looking into using an MUI interface.

Any help or advice would be appreciated.

There is an acrhive on AmiNet which is called AmosMui (in dev/amos) or
something like that. I've never used it, but I believe it is supposed to do
just what you need.

I was subscribed ages ago. But never folloewd thru with getting blitz or amos.

At that time when I was looking for an amiga basic compiler I heard about
ACE. And picked it up from aminet, did a little experimentation with it.
contacted David Benn re:ACE (He's the author). Though he has discontinued
development by him on ACE, he's released the full source code. I created an
ACE mailing list here at onelist to hopefully get people interested in
customizing and upgrading ACE to what WE want in a basic compiler. Did I
mention it's FREE ?

ACE was and is fully functional as is. Those of us on the list now are hoping
to make ACE even better.

Come on over, you could learn something about C and basic programming as we
work out the upgrades to ACE..

On Break Broke?

Fri Oct 16, 1998 1:05 am
Bob Jordan <bjordan@soest.hawaii.edu>


What am I doing wrong? I can't seem to get any of the ON BREAKs to work.
I've tried procedures, gosubs, and goto and none seem to work. The
Procedure complains of a syntax error, and the gosub and goto forms are
ignored as if the ON BREAK statement is not being recognized. Also the
help example has comments about this statement, but doesn't actually
implement them in the program. I entered the commented program and got
same results. Any clues would be appreciated. Following is what I tried:

On Break Proc BROKEN1
Do
Print "unbroken"
Wait 10
Loop

Procedure BROKEN1
Print "broke out of loop"
End Proc
'-----

On BREAK Gosub BROKEN2
Do
Print "unbroken"
Wait 10
Loop

BROKEN2:
Print "broke out of loop"
Return
'-----

On BREAK Goto BROKEN3
Do
Print "unbroken"
Wait 10
Loop

BROKEN3 :
Print "broke out of loop"

nnnng.

I hate on break. Oh well. You could do this:

break off
while loop=1
do whatever.
gosub breakcheck
wend
end

breakcheck:
q$=inkey$
if q$=chr$(3)
loop=0
' error 42 rem or something.
end if
return

Or something like that if you wanted to check for ctrl-c. I don't personally
mess with break checks much.

Thanks for the suggestion. I was hoping for a way to make ON BREAK work
though. That would give me an interupt driven break instead of a busy
checking for a break which eats more execution time.

Is there a way to make ON BREAK work or is it truly broke?

Thats funny, it works fine on my copy of AMOS Pro. Which version do
you have? I'm using V2.0 but I guess it should work for any version.

What doesn't work is when you compile it, because once compiled it
doesn't recognise Ctrl-Break. If I were you I wouldn't use On Break, you
may as well assign a Key to it, like say ESC to quit you program.


See ya.

ExtensionList Updated..

Sat Oct 17, 1998 8:47 pm
Jens Vang Petersen <top_cat@post8.tele.dk>


Hello, Everyone..

I've finaly got around to update the extensionlistings on my site
(URL Below).. I would like every amos-user to take the time to drop by
and see if they have aditional information to add to the site.. ;-)

And just a note: The style is the same as the one on 'AMOS Factory', this
is done by request from Rune, as soon as we solve some minor technical
problems the two sites will be merged into one, but for now the listings
are made as 'stand-alone' pages..

I'll be adding an 'FAQ' and some information on how to write extensions
on the site in the future. Please send me any ideas you have to improve
existing sections, or to make new ones, to me.

I'm also planning a 'recomended' listing, so if you use extensions
and there's one/some you think noone should live without then let me know.
(please write what kind of programs you make with the extension(s)...)

And just a note: The new construction is FRAME-FREE, just for those of
you who hated the old version....

NOTE: The URL has been changed for the AMOS-section, so please enter
through my 'main page'...

Thanks in advance for helping me to improve the listing.. ;-)

Hmmm, ok, see ammendment....

Actually, afaik, amos treats break checks as busy. Ghizzo ?

> Is there a way to make ON BREAK work or is it truly broke?

Yes, but it's a dodgy command, and it's very tricky inside procedures, and
makes the whole thing a mess. Actually most of the interupt stuff in amos
is a bit dodgy.

I think we have the problem now. I'm still in amos version 1.00.

It's probably on old bug long dead and gone, only kept alive
in the farthest reaches of the universe, like Hawaii.

Can anyone provide clues on how to upgrade my amos?

I have source, It turns out that the routines I have are
THE worlds fastest, and there unreleased atm. I'll
ask kalms about releasing them or me giving you a copy,
they are simple, just run the initroutine then just the c2p routine.

its not to hard to do,
just use Call(amos command), and have precompiled your c2p.
you'll need to pass some args and stuff to it, but no more than 10mins work.

and pass args via Dreg(). and for a better speed
put fixed screens into the routine, so that
you just tell it the screen to use in init() instead of doing it for ever c2p.

Andy,

I have an A3000 and Hires/laced screens work fine (now) since I got the new
AmosPro library.

(I have the library here if you want it (v 2.20?), though a newer one is
probably available on one of those AMOS websites people here talk about.)

The amos library needs updating on the other machines. The lib is on a
couple of amos sites I can't name off hand. Is it on aminet yet Ghizzo ?

There is an example on aminet.

Searching an array

Mon Oct 19, 1998 4:58 am
Rod Whiteley <rwhiteley@magnet.com.au>


Dear AMOSer's
Any ideas?
I'm altering a search utility, and would to know if there's a command to
search an array, preferably with pattern matching options. The AMOSPro 'Match'
command only works at all after a sort (I'm searching about 7,000 items, so
this takes ages) and doesn't work very accurately. I note there's a command in
the Jd Extension, but it's poorly documented, and I couldn't get it to work. I
couldn't find an AMCAF command (which surprised me.)



BTW, I sent Chris Hodges some DM for the extension and haven't heard from him
since; before I start hassling him, has anyone else had this problem?)

Try this:
Result=Jd Compare(STEACH_CRITERIA,STRING_TO_CHECK)
Wildcards (* and ?) can be used.
Result=True if match found.

Example:
If Jd Compare("AMO*","AMOS Pro")
Print "Match found !"
End If

It should be something like that.
I don't got the "manual" in front of me though.

Magnus

TGE has cd32 pad support, but for it you will have to wait
until Nov15th.

TGE DOES REALLY have cd32 support. I never said its impossible without
extensions.
BUT it is a hell of alot faster with extensions.

Um, I didn't meen that TGE having CD32pad support was incorret, I
ment that having to wait until Nov15th to use CD32 was incorrect.

No hard feelings ;)

Will the CD32 support in TGE let you If " Jdown(1) and Jff(1) and Jred(1)
Then " ?

What is TGE ? Is it an AGA ext. ?

Why doesn't anyone just wright a CD32 joy ext. ?

Help with Arexx

Tue Oct 20, 1998 8:43 am
"John P." <amiga3k@usa.net>


Can someone explain how to use an external arexx function from inside Amos?

From an arexx script for the Video Toaster I would:

Call addlib('PROJECT REXX PORT',0)

Call Croutonpick(last)

(no this does nothing, but you hopefully get the idea)

And so forth, as the Toaster software is implemented as a function host.
But how to do this from Amos or AmosPro?

Searching for a string

Tue Oct 20, 1998 5:47 pm
Bernie Noel <bnoel@club-internet.fr>


Hi listers,

Somebody asked about how to find a string in an array.
A quick way of finding a string in memory is the function Hunt:
Address=Hunt(start To finish,string$)

The problem with string arrays is that the strings are not stored in a
contiguous way (unlike numeric arrays). For instance A$(1) can be at one end
of the memory and A$(2) at the other end. (A slight exaggeration, but it's the
general idea).

So I'd recommend using a data bank instead of an array. The first chunk of the
bank could be used to store the offsets of the strings, and the rest of the
bank, the strings themselves.

If your purpose is making a Database, you might look into the "Random Access
Files" section too.

Best regards

Bernie

Hi people :)

Today I renembered a bug in AMOSPro I discovered 5 years ago.
When you use

Input "text",WHATEVER$

And the text is so long that the textline almost reaches the
right border of the screen amos freezes.

Well amos is full of weird bugs like that I guess :( ;)

Try to switch the arguments like Jd Compare("AMOS Pro","AMO*").
It should work with wildcards.
Anyway I'm gonna take a closer look at it after work.

If anyone wanna help me optimize the whole game , or a module of it

convert it to run on 2 vbl?

Have you tryed 'AMOSOptimizer.amos' ?

If not I can send you a copy of the latest version.

Replies for all :)

Pietro Ghizzoni <ghizzo@agonet.it>


Hi!

i'm sorry for my fugitiveness, but in this period i've not many time for my
Amiga :(
Anyway now i'm here to reply to all the questions posted on the mailing-list
and other details.

Please find the time to read the full message, because it covers different
arguments :)

I've noticed the restart of 'Amos good, blitz bad"... mmmhhhh.. boring. No one
has really stress the difference... both Amos and Blitz are GOOD languages. The
REAL amos advantage over the others is only one:

most computer languages require that you think like a computer rather than a
human to work with it. AMOS works in human terms. All the functions and
commands are easy to learn due to the self-explaining names, and are easy to
use due to the AMOS philosophy 'i do everything for you'.
This is the reason of the Amos success.... several persons says' the Blitz is
faster'... yes is true, but it's no true!! You can't compare Blitz and Amos
because they works in a different way. Blitz works in a more 'low-level' way,
and is up to the user to code everything. The Blitz 'background' doesn't need
to check nothing.. if you're a good coder your programs will works fine, if you
sucks your programs will crash :) (.... for this reason the 70% of the blitz
programs crash soon or later)

Amos works in a high-level-human way. You can setup complex scenarios using few
commands... all the complex job is done in the Amos background. This is a
*good* and *bad* feature. It's good for the beginners, since they don't need
any programming/OS knowledge, is bad for the experienced users because they
can't
optmize the effect speed and the working method. Amos is 'slower' because it
needs to check tons of things in the background (several times uselessly),
and so it can't optimize the program execution.

If you're reading this, you prefer AMOS and its intuitive structure, so we
don't need to know that Blitz is bad :)

Another point.. i've received again some questions about the FD Extension...
probably i've not published enough my work :) First visit the AMOS Factory and
its download section, and get the FD Extension V2 archive. In the archive
you'll not find a Amos extension :) There is only the FD Builder. This cool
program allows you to real-time create AMOSPro extensions starting from
the standard .fd files of your preferred libraries. Just select some .fd
files,
and then click on the Build gadget... after few seconds a new extension with
ALL the functions described in the selected .fd files will be created and saved
in your APSytem directory. The advantage? Now you can use intuitive functions
calls
with their names instead of the offsets, and you don't need to know the
function registers.... example, graphics.library function Text:

Standard Amos method:

Areg(1)=RP : Areg(0)=varptr(T$) : Dreg(0)=Len(A$) : T=GfxCall(-xxx)


FD Extension:

T=Lvo Text(RP,ST,L)


much better no? You can use the function name, and pass the parameters without
remembering the right registers, everything will be setup correclty for you.
Now you can import as standard Amos commands all the libraries functions that
you
need like MUI, BsdSocket, etc, etc. without boring Areg(), Lib Open, Lib Call()
ecc. commands. The program will be faster too.. in the above example you use 1
command instead of 4 (..or more!) !!

What are you doing here? Download the FD extension kit!! it's freeware as
usual.


Several guys are looking for the AMOSPro Compiler or the AMOSPro upgrade, or
AMOSPro V2.... these programs are out of stock, and so it's really hard find
them
somewhere. The programs are commercial and copyrighted, and so YOU CAN'T SPREAD
THEM!!!

Please be patient, as stated in a previous message, in December i'll release
the complete AMOSPro+Compiler package for *FREE DOWNLOAD* on the AMOS Factory
site. Ah... the AMOS Factory site if _#THE OFFICIAL AMOS SITE#_, the url is:

http://www.seta.it/amos/

put it in your browser's bookmark.

Some details about the upgrade. The difference between your AMOSPro copy and
the mine released in december is just some bugs fixes. The MAIN Amospro core
will not be updated... why?

There is a reason.... too many years are elapsed since the last AMOS update..
the today hardware, software and OS situation is totally different. Now gfx
cards and so retargetable gfx and audio, PPC, AGA and so on are a reality, and
the internal AMOS structure is not ready for this. Everything is based on the
old Amiga500 system....the direct hardware access, the OS support and
integration, the programming style etc...... upgrade AMOS with the actual
standards mean TOTALLY rewrite it!!! I'm not so stupid to spend so many time
when between 1 year a totally new amiga will be available!

The AGA support.... add it should be possible but.... the problem is the
compatibility! If we rewrite AMOS and the amos.library with AGA support, all
your previous programs and expecially your extensions will never works
again! I don't think that broke the backward compatibility is a good idea now.

But fortunately AMOS is modular, and so instead of rewrite it we can
add/replace new
functions trough extensions. For this reason i've contacted the best
pd/shareware extensions coders and created the Amos Development Group. We've
joined our efforts, and we'll release our works together as a REAL upgrade.
Thanks to our extensions you'll obtain:

- AGA and gfx cards support
- intuition and gadtools support
- boopsi
- datatypes
- locale
- CDDA
- fast gfx commands great for games coders
- 100% AmigaOS support
- database support

and many, many other cool stuffs.

Some last minute news... in the update you'll find the *FULL* registered
version
of #LDos# and #LSerial# extensions with examples and .guide docs! Thanks to
Niklas
Sjoberg I'VE the licence to spread them.

Another great news.... thanks to Làzàr Zoltan and his /#DBase Extension#/ now
Amos
has a easy and quick dbase files handling!! The extension will be included in
the update, and posted on the AMOS Factory soon.

I'm working on a special licence for the Amos Developer CD buyers.... i don't
know if i'll obtain it.... stay tuned for a (i hope) nice surprise.

Speaking about the CD... now *i need your help!!!!* I need someone with all the
neccessary *hardware*, *software* and *knowledge* to produce the CD.

This is a tender.. if you can do it send me your offer. Tell me how
much you want for every CD... the best offer will win the contract :)
Important:
you also need a full internet connection, because we have to send you all the
materials trough the network (IRC,e-mail....)

OK.. sometime ago i've promised the GUI Extension v1.8.. a little sad news ;)
i've dropped this project because now i'm full working on the #GUI Extension
V2#.
It's a complete rewriting of the original, with some extra cool functions like
GUI locale support, app icons, app window, MUI-like iconify ecc. Anyway i'll
release a bug fixed version of the GUI Extension v1.7 (..V1.75)

Phew!!!! ... you've reached the end of this caotic message... well done :)


P.S About the On Break problem.... AMOSPro V1.x is really bugged, and the On
Break is one of this problem... since you (... now i don't remember who ) have
the V1 the problem is explained. With AMOSPro 2 On Break works fine.

TGE Announcement

Wed Oct 21, 1998 1:12 am
Peter Cahill <cahill4@iol.ie>


Hello!

As some of you know I have now set a release date for TGE!
On 15th November I'll release TGE0.9Beta, it may contain bugs and stuff
but I know of NONE, and all found bugs will be removed.

Today, Ive uploaded some Tge demos to my website
(Http://www.iol.ie/~cahill4/peter/amos.html)
It has 6 demos, nothing too fancy but it just is a small demonstration
of the speed of tge, all gfx commands are 2-5times faster than
the AMOS ones and support aga and rtg. Only the loadiff demo
uses aga/rtg though 8o)

Please visit the site and download the demos, and report
all comments,bugs and life storys to me.

thx,

Hi Everybody,

> frogs/players.

Nop, you don't want to do that. It would be too mesy and every time
you wanted to change the game engine you'd have to change 4 things at
once.

I think you should change all the player variebles to arrays :


dim x(3),y(3) etc.

and then put all the players code into a for...next loop:


do

for p=0 to 3

if jleft(1) then x(p)=x(p)-1

bob p+1,x(p),y(p),p+3

etc etc.

next

wait vbl

loop

this would be /slightly/ slower, but its much easier to develop.


> Problem is that the speed is not holding.

Oh dear. Speed is always a problem in amos ;(

What amiga are you using? Also have you tried it compiled?

Well, I can try. I've had to optimise many of my games so I should be
able to help. Just send the sorce.


> Also , the game is to run in 1 vbl , what is the easiest way to
> convert it to run on 2 vbl?

Heres what you do:

Timer=0

do

T=Timer
Timer=0

For a=1 to T
----
---- Program code
----
next

----
---- Screen update code.
----

loop



That should make sure that the game runs at roughly the right speed.

I know a lot of people say its a bad idea reseting the timer, but I've
had no problems with it.


Anyway, as I said, I could have a go at optimising it for you ;)



See ya.

If you've only got the original AMOS then you could try and get hold
of AMOSPro as this is faster. Also, extensions like the Turbo
extensions will speed up your code.

You said your code is modular - does that mean you call a lot of
procedures? I've found that calling a lot of procedures - especially
from inside your main loop - can slow down your programs.
The amount of optimisation you can do to your code depends on how
optimised it is already. The most basic optimisations come from
changing things like:

A=A+2

to:

Add A,2

(Remember A=A-2 goes to Add A,-2...)
Also A=A+1 can go to Inc A, and A=A-1 goes to Dec A.
Also, if you've got any code like this:

X=X+2 : If X>10 Then X=0
you can change it to Add X,2,0 To 10
This is even more helpful in something like
X=X+A when A can be negative - as your code could look like this:
X=X+A
If X>10 Then X=0
If X<0 Then X=10
This can be changed to just Add X,A,0 To 10
Another point for optimisation is the way you check for joystick
movements. If my memory is right, calling 'If Joy(0)=1...' is quicker
than 'If Jup(0)...' (I can't remember if 1 is up or not though. I
think it's 1=Up, 2=Down, 4=Left, 8=Right, Fire=16 and any composite
direction/fire is just an addition of these, but I'm sure someone
will correct me on these as I haven't got AMOS handy...)
You should also store answers to sums in variables if you use these
answers in more than a few other fuctions.
eg. Add ploy(1,1),16*SCORE-32*(2-LIFE)
Add PLOY(2,1),16*SCORE-32*(2-LIFE)
Add PLOY(3,1),16*SCORE-32*(2-LIFE)
Add PLOY(4,1),16*SCORE-32*(2-LIFE)
should become
X=16*SCORE-32*(2-LIFE)
Add PLOY(1,1),X
Add PLOY(2,1),X etc...

One other little innovation I include in my code (well, an innovation
for me anyway) is that I only update the 'enemies' every certain
number of cycles - and I only update a certain number of those
enemies in any given cycle... That is to say the player never slows
down, but the enemies might sometime. To make things clear, consider
this:

NUM_TO_UPDATE=15
CURRENT=2
MAX_UPDATE=10

For X=1 To 4
Update players...
Next

OKAY=True
A=0
While OKAY=True
..
Update enemy 'CURRENT'
..
Add CURRENT,1,1 To NUM_TO_UPDATE
Inc A
If A=MAXUPDATE Then OKAY = False
Wend

Thus only 10 enemies are updated every cycle (if I've coded it right
which I probably haven't)

Anyway, that's all I can think of for now...

David

Hello!

Ive noticed the Screens in amos2.21 work 100% no errors, well done 8o)
but is there any chance of you fixing the Do&loop bug ?

It goes like this:
after a LOT of loops it just hangs and the screen distorts.
It normally only happens on 030+ as other cpus never do enough
loops to cause a crash ;)

Also, maybe its just me but I think that the number of loops
BEFORE the crash has increased in 2.21.

thanks!

I believe so , currently the things are the old copy and paste way

I have a copy of amos pro around somewhere

I will try extensions if all dosen't work

uhh , yep.Actually the main loop is composed ONLY by procedures
It calls around 10 procedures
If this is what it is slowing down , I can try converting it to
gosubs

Hi Everybody,

That should be plenty enough to run the game full speed with out
compiling it. I guess theres a bug in your code thats eating the CPU
time.

No prob.

>>

Yep, but the object movement should take very little vbl time, where
as screen refresh usually takes up a lot (epecially if you have bg
anims.)

You /could/ do it by taking the value of the timer and moving the
player fowads by that ammount, but if there was a sudden interuption in
the program (CD-Rom spins up, amiga having to wait a while) then the
timer value would suddenly 'explode', and the player would be thrown
into the middle of a block or something.

See ya.

Andy H <geosync@ozemail.com.au>


Hi all,

Here`s my tips on optimising.

1) Use Procedures for your front end/ back end stuff like intros, high
scores etc.
2) Put your main game code up the top in a list of SubRoutines, using
Gosub.
3) Replace for/next loops with repeat/until loops (inc the loop var
yourself)
4) Use INC, DEC and ADD.
5) Process only 1 or 2 aliens per cycle. (this is a great speed
increase) but make sure they still move in other cycles
6) Pop Proc or Return from Procedures / SubRoutines as soon as your code
is done, don`t let it run through all cases unless you need to, and make
each condition modal. ie I have a Range(x,y,mode) proc which tests for
ranges between obj's x and y. mode determines the type of case.

Procedure RANGE(x,y,mode)
if mode=0
...
pop proc
endif
if mode=1
...
pop proc
endif
...
End Proc

7) Use as many colours as you can without a speed loss (and make this
element one of your main focuses for optimisation) because people prefer
more colours and it looks more professional.
8) Process everything thats large in small segements. So if you need to
check the collision between 30 sprites, break it up into 5 sprites per
cycle and check for 6 cycles (at speed this only takes 12vbls - so the
player wont notice). Cue up lower priority tasks when the speed isn`t
important.
Example

Cycle 1 - Process 2 enemy (inc ptr to nxt enemy), Check 5 collisions
Cycle 2 - Update scores, time, check mission status
Cycle 3 - Process 2 enemy (inc ptr to nxt enemy), Check 5 collisions
Cycle 4 - Do nothing
Cycle 5 - Process 2 enemy (inc ptr to nxt enemy), Check 5 collisions
Cycle 6 - Do nothing
Cycle 7 - Process 2 enemy (inc ptr to nxt enemy), Check 5 collisions
Cycle 8 - Set up new enemies, clean up maps etc, normalisation cycle.

Make sure you process the player every cycle though!!!!

9) When using 3d keep the frame rate up, not the number of enemies. 3
well designed enemy ships are harder to kill when the frame rate is
smooth than 10 enemy that just fly in and the frame rate is slow enough
to allow the player to think.

10) When using sprites, keep the number of planes down.
11) When scrolling maps, only paste what the player can see plus a
little off the edges, and when processing enemies off screen give them a
cycle every 2 compared to the ones on the screen.. The player will never
notice.

I guess that`s the thing I found out. When you have a decent frame rate
but the enemy is updated every 2nd or so cycle the player doesn't notice
because the action is speeded up.

Seeya,
Andy H.

Upgrade questions.

Fri Oct 23, 1998 3:23 am
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


The other day I let my mind wander (which probably signifies something
dangerous) :) and I began to think about upgrading my Amiga. Questions:

1. Where and for how much could I find a new A4000(/Tower) (in USD)?
2. Where and for how much could I find a good used A1200 or similar?
3. What graphics cards are compatible with my ECS A2000? Which are
recommended and for how much could I obtain one (CyberVision, Retina)?

These are just some things I've been thinking about, and if I can find some
good deals, I may go in on one of them; however, with the recent talk of
Gateway and some 3rd-parties planning a new Amiga, I may wait (but I won't
hold my breath, or else I'll be decomposed by the time they release it).

Hi Andy

You cant imagine how much help your 11 tips are
Thanks really!

Although I'm skilled
I program in a very ancient way
I guess it was that TRS-80 Color Basic...

Problem is , that after reading
the tips , I got kind a very hapy
about how would my code fit this rules

See , although the code is modular
, I guarentee the modules are
messy inside

So now I feel like rewriting it
as your tips convinced me
I can use 32 or 64 colors
and get the bobs bigger

Whatta dilema!

Thanks a lot!

I believe so , but I'm not that smart to use it

They are very small

But it was too much a hazard (specially colorwise)

for 3d, ONLY use intergers and not the normal amos commands,
Also, a c2p thing would increase speed ALOT!

3-D Optimizing (was 'Optimizing')

"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


>Any more? (especially related to 3D as that's my favorite "toy" right now)

Well, if you're thinking along the lines of Doom or Wolfenstein:
1. Use integers, and nothing else! Be sparing on the Floating Point!
2. It helps to precalculate as much as you can and store it in tables.
3. Peter was right: any type of c2p conversion routines are helpful.
4. It also helps to optimize everything you can in Assembler yourself. :)
5. When writing a Doom-er, KEEP YOUR CODE MODULAR. It's neater that way.

I'm sure these same principles will apply to other types of 3D programs, as
well as a few other genres of games. I may have missed a few, but these
should be enough to get you started (if you weren't aware of any before).

Worlds Fastest C2P's

Peter Cahill <cahill4@iol.ie>


Hello!

I remember a few people here mailed me, looking for those
new C2ps that I have They will be put up on my WWW this sunday
so you can download them then, I'll also put the amosOptimizer up
there also. you CAN use these C2Ps from AMOS. Its not hard to do
it wouldn't take more than 5mins to do, all 3D games will benifit
greatly from them, but you can only do 'Plot' to the chunky buffer.
Which you should do like:

Poke C2PBUFFER,C

where C2PBuffer is your place in fastmen that has the c2pbuffer
and 'C' is the colour number. Seen as amos only does
up to 6bitplanes, with the 6bpl version of the c2ps
you'll get about 45FPS at least on the 030.

PS: I'll also be releasing new C2P modules for DoomAttack,
so you'll get to play in fullscreen smoothly!

arghhhhh!

why cant people just look at the ones that come with amos ?!?!?
its not as if there hidden or impossible to find. for the final time:
*AMOSPro_Tutorial:Extensions/*

Ive replyed to at least 5-7 mails in the past 3 weeks
(some to list some private) about extension source,
all other extension coders found it, so its not hidden

If you pirated amos and therefore dont have the source then
you cant get the source, or you'll have to wait until the ADCD comes out.

I'm really not sure - I presume the entire AMOS Pro package - the
place I read the ad was 'comp.sys.amiga.marketplace' and the bloke
selling it was 'tron@cmh.net'... That's all I can really tell you

Worlds slowest C2P

Sat Oct 24, 1998 8:03 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

Just for the record, heres an experimental AMOS only (?!) C2P.


Although uncompiled its a lot slower then just plotting it, when
compiled its a lot faster. Ofcorce as its all in amos its still horribly
slow, but what the heck ;)


See ya.

Nop, AMOS3D games won't be any different. and any that use

...You'll get 45fps with just the C2P, but amos' poke is so slow it
takes a whole second just to fill a 320x200 buffer, let alone all the 3d
calculations as well.

If you want a 3D game in amos with out using something like AMOS3D or
plain lines, then you /really/ have to do most of it in asm.

See ya.

AlienBreed3D editor V3.03

Sun Oct 25, 1998 9:38 am
Jens Vang Petersen <top_cat@post8.tele.dk>


Hello, Everyone..

I've only recived a few bug-reports since I released V3.02 of the AlienBreed
3D-II LevelED 3 months ago. So either there's not many bugs left, or noone
uses the program anymore. Anyway I've decided to release a version that
should fix the few bugs that's been reported. As it seems like the interest
for the editor is dropping I've decided to close the project for now, but
if I might reopen it later on if the interest is present..

As usualy the editor can be downloaded from my homepages, and it should
be availeble on the AmiNET in the near future (circle time)...


Anyway the new version handles the folowing topics:

NEWS in V3.03 (Released: 25-10-1998)
! RELEASE NOTES !
- More bug-fixes..
- It appears that the interest for the editor is dropping so this might
end up as the last version :-(..
* FIXED *
- Crash in 'Set brightness'..
- 'Add objects' would crash when entering values directly..
- 'Define Objects frames' had some old left-overs included..
- 'Define Bullets' also had some old left-overs there..
* INTERNAL *
- Now compiled with amos.library V2.21

Several extensions have asm-source included in the archives, off-hand I can
name 'SLN', 'MISC', 'COLOURS' and my own 'JVP-NoKidz'. You can find them all
on the extension-listings on my homepages...

Normaly this problem shows up when doing very fast loops like:
Do
W$=Inkey$
If W$="".....
Loop

Put a 'Multi Wait' inside the loop and it won't happen..

Then just wait for the ADCD as AMOS extensions and AMOSPRo are diffrent!

The ADCD will be out in december.

ADCD stands for Amos Developer CD and it's something

C2P is a routine to convert from Chunky to Planar graphics.

Arexx again....

Tue Oct 27, 1998 7:15 am
"John P." <amiga3k@usa.net>


I posted earlier, but got no responce, so here it goes again.

What is the best way to use Arexx functions from within AMOS?

The only thing I can think of so far is to write small scripts that open
the libraries then perform one function. I'd need one script for each
function, plus it would run very slow as AMOS would have to call a
script and wait for the return each time it needed a function.

I looked into LDos, but it didn't seem to do what I need. Am I wrong?

Sorry to post again, but I really need the help.
Thanks,

I believe so , but I'm not that smart to use it
Unfortunantly , all Im using are bobs (bob command)
They are very small
I tried changing the frogs bobs to sprite
But it was too much a hazard (specially colorwise)

I believe the reason for his garbled message(s) is that his mailer (Outlook
according to the message source, Declan?) encoded them as Base64 (instead

happend, except the loss of time and date, of course.

Hello, all !

Here is another tip to speed up yous progs:

Repeat
Add x,Jleft(1)
Add x,-Jright(1)
Add y,Jup(1)
Add y,-Jdown(1)
Bob 1,x,y,1
Until fire(1)

It is a VERY useful lack in all Basics, the "logical" type does not
exist, booleans are in fact integers, so you can use them !

In the same way, if "Wmove" is a 0/1 flag, you can replace:
If Wmove = 1
Inc X
End If

with :
Add x,Wmove

I started to use this tip on my ooooold Sinclair ZX81, where speed and
byte-savig were absolutely needed. 1024 bytes of total memory is short !

What he ment was that you might end up with your battery leaking

Re: Arexx again....

Thu Oct 29, 1998 8:20 am
"Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>


John,
You could try the Exec function within your AMOS program to execute an
Arexx command or script. The following is a command line I use in one of my
programs, Midi Companion, which addresses the OctaMED Arexx port and sends a
command to turn Midi Active on.

Exec "RX "+chr$(34)+"address octamed_rexx op_set midiactive on"+chr$(34)

It can slow down your program but if you make RX resident it does speed up a
bit.

I tried LDOS which would be great if I could only get it to work properly. I
couldn't get LDOS to recognise the OctaMED Arexx port. LDOS has some good
Arexx commands and if you haven't tried it out yet, you should. It might
just work for you.

Declan.

From: "John P." <amiga3k@usa.net>

I posted earlier, but got no responce, so here it goes again.

What is the best way to use Arexx functions from within AMOS?

The only thing I can think of so far is to write small scripts that open
the libraries then perform one function. I'd need one script for each
function, plus it would run very slow as AMOS would have to call a
script and wait for the return each time it needed a function.

I looked into LDos, but it didn't seem to do what I need. Am I wrong?

Sorry to post again, but I really need the help.
Thanks,

According to Paxtron, a company here in the US, says that the average Ni/Cd
battery life is about 4 years, then it starts leaking. They also sell
Lithium (which should last longer) or Ni/Cd batteies to replace the
original battery.

You Can Replace the battery on a 3000, but doing so involves
yanking out your mother board and sodering the old battery off
and the new one on from bottom side of your MB. All in all a
ridiculous amount of work.

On my 4000/060 I get

Modifying the code by using standard optimisations (a=a+b turned to

Well, doing thats all well and good if your only moving a simple
opject, but it doesn't allow for propper anims and block collisions.


Any anyway, with the joystick rouines they'll only be called once in
a vbl, so speed isn't /that/ important. Also adding support for
different control setups isn't easy like that either.


I use this method:

---------------------------------------------------------------

cont=0 :Rem Type of controls eg. 0 is joystic 1, 1 is joystic 2.
frm=1

do

gosub chkcont


if l
frm=1 : x=x-1
end if
if r
frm=2 : x=x+1
end if
if u
frm=3 : y=y-1
end if
if d
frm=4 : y=y+1
end if

if f
exit
end if

Bob 1,x,y,frm

wait vbl

loop


chkcont:
if cont=0
if jleft(0)
l=-1
else
l=0
end if
if jright(0)
r=-1
else
r=0
end if
if jup(0)
u=-1
else
u=0
end if
if jdown(0)
d=-1
else
d=0
end if
if fire(0)
f=-1
else
f=0
end if
return
end if

if cont=1
if jleft(1)
l=-1
else
l=0
end if
if jright(1)
r=-1
else
r=0
end if
if jup(1)
u=-1
else
u=0
end if
if jdown(1)
d=-1
else
d=0
end if
if fire(0)
f=-1
else
f=0
end if
return
end if

return

---------------------------------------------------------------


I know its not the fastest, but its modular, easy to use and easy to
add different control configs.


See ya.

It should be .AMOS

Its just another version of packman.


PS. (to author)

Next time, could you at /least /pack it or someting. Anyway, whats
wrong with uploading it to Aminet?

And I think its a rather boring version. Theres already too many
versions of packman. Try a more original version ;)
