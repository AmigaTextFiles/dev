                 AMOS Pro Program Shortener Version 1.00 
                 =======================================

                    By Paul Hickman (ph@doc.ic.ac.uk)
                    =================================



OVERVIEW
========

The program shortener simply makes programs shorter! It does not compress
them - it actualy shortens them! This is done in 2 ways:

1) Removing all comments and blank lines

2) Replacing the names of long variables/label/procedure names with shorter
   ones.


REQUIREMENTS
============

Any version of AMOS Pro. Enough memory to load the accessory,
and the program to shorten simultaneously. Easylife V1.4+


DISTRIBUTION
============

This progam may be freely distributed, as long as no profit is
made from doing so. It may not be put on a disk together with 
programs for which a profit is made from distributing them.



USAGE
=====

Load the Program shortener as an AMOS Pro accessory program, and the
program to be shortened into the buffer. Then test the program to be
shorten, and run the accessory from the 'AMOS' menu. Select the method
of shortening, and wait...

Variables:	Remove comments & Blank lines, and shorten variable,
                procedure and label names.

Comments:	Remove comments & Blank lines only.


Comments will work on any program. Variables will not work on 
programs which use wildcards in Global / Shared statments, or contain
procedures which cannot be unfolded and have argument variable names
of 2 characters or more.


NOTE: If you abort a 'variables' mode shortening, midway thourgh the
      program will not be left in a runable state.

NOTE: If your program contains any goto or gosub statement for which the
      label to branch to is calculated, no labels in anywhere in the
      program will be shortened - only variables & procedure names.


Comming in V1.1
===============

  - Production of a symbol table of new & old variable names.

  - The bug with procedure which cannot be unfoled will be fixed. (I Hope)

  - Singing, dancing, and rollerskating aardvark.
