          IFF 2 AMOS Source Code By Manu Evans

#########################################################

Short:

        To convert an IFF picture to amos source code to
        be included in your code or loaded as an
        accessory.

Requirements:

        * An Amiga ...
        * WB 2 or above
        * Reqtools.Library (Included)
        * Some IFF's
        * A minute or 2

Usage:

        Run the program and follow the on screen prompts.

        Input file - The IFF for input.
        Picture width - The width in pixels of your pic.
        Picture height - The height in pixels of your pic.
        Colours - The number of colours
        Screen mode - The screen mode AMOS will open to
                        the screen in.
        Output file - The file to save to .. eg.
                        DH1:Programming/Amos/Pic.Asc

Info:

        The converter converts the bitmap to an amos
        procedure named _Picture[S]. The "S" being the
        screen number u want the proc to open.

        Sorry bout the screen width and height thing ...
        I'll fix that in the next version. Just couldnt
        be bothered making it autodetect and I dont know
        how autodect colours ...

        Send me an email and tell me that u use it and
        improvements that I could make. If anybody
        has ever seen a program just the same as this,
        tell me of it ..

        Thanx to Peter Gordon for the ReqTools Procs
