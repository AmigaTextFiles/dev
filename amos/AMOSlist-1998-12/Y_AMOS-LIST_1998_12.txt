   * ASCII signitures have been rebuilt where possible.
     Unfortunately Yahoo store messages in a way which means more than 1 space
     is stored as just 1 space. Viewing the message source, and then trying to
     view HTML source in Firefox didn't make any difference.
     Where I have been unable to rebuild the ASCII signitures I have simply put
     "ASCII Signiture As-Is" by the message number.

     Thanks to Mark de Jong (from the AMOS-LIST) for helping me with rebuilding
     Floquet's ASCII signiture. (who else would keep emails for 7 years?!)

     Thanks to Andrew Allen for preserving Peter Cahill's ASCII signiture for
     me (see message 1613) in November 1998.

     Thanks to Michael Cox, as I was able to cross-reference some emails from
     the Onelist archives with ones posted to the Yahoo one to reinstate email
     addresses that Yahoo has discarded, and rebuild some ASCII signitures.

A kind of EEPROM. Keeps just like ROMs whatever stored
even without power, but can also be reprogrammed.
In this case, Phase5 stores their firmware there.

To everyone: Although I had planned on getting the new pages for
Parrottsoft up this past Friday, I ran into some (usual) server-side
problems and I have instead planned for an opening THIS Friday.

In the meantime, I thought I would offer anyone who has an Amiga-related
site the chance to linked to the Parrottsoft site. If you would like to be,
please mail me at the address below. All links will be considered and I'd
say most (if not all) will be posted, but be aware that ALL are subject to
submission. Please get any and all links to me as soon as possible. Btw,
if you want a banner with your link, I will have some banner rules posted
shortly on the site so that you may include one w/your link.

Hi, everybody


Just a mail to inform the amosians that there's a playable demo of
*SuperDrive* on the Amos Factory (thanks to Rune).

Up to 4 players on one screen, it can be terrible. So ...
... test it, find bugs, new ideas, suggestions, and enjoy it.

Yes, Amos can drive cars too, eh, eh !

Last thing, I looking for people who would be interested in drawing
circuits, contact me, thanks to all.

Bug fixed and upgrading!

Pietro Ghizzoni <ghizzo@agonet.it>


Hello,

finally the "trouble compiling" problem is fixed, and on the Amos Factory
you'll find the new versions of AMOSPro.Lib and amos.library.

A sad note.... due to the fix i have to drop a project.. IED... the
Intuition Editor for Amos. In order to promote the WHOLE amos editor in a
intuition screen, the amos.library needs to be heavly hacked. Unfortunately
some systems and in some case the compiler doesn't like the hacks :(

Some extra news... in the next days i will be off-line because i'll upgrade
my Amiga1200. i've bought a Ateo Tower and the Pixel64 gfx card. Finally
with a true RTG system i'll be able to add a good RTG support in the GUI
extension :)

Is there a way to call the command parser and stuff externally? Maybe a set of
lib calls? Rather than a full rewrite promotion, could you set up some sort of
passover so a gui program could be written and use the amos functions like run
and test?

What about a separate amos.library for the editor with the hacks, and a
second
for the compiler, which hold only bug fixes?

I am going to buy a video card, then how can I use Amos with a 31kHz
monitor?

I refer back to my older idea: someone could write a GoldED module
with amos commands in, then you could just import it into amos, or I
think the compiler can load ascii files as well.

Anyway, I think that delevopement should be centered more on making
that portable 'AmosNG' as the time of the 'Classic' amiga is to be
honest, coming to an end with AT developing a new range. And as AmosNG
will be in C or whatever, it would be a brilliant multi-platform
development kit.

Sure it would be nice having a more OS friendly AmosPro, but surly a
propper OS replacement version would be much better, even if we had to
wait a while.


As with amos on a 31kHz monitor, you could always get:
1. A cheap TV for all the older stuff on Amiga.
2. A scan doubler


See ya.

1.3 ?? There is an option on 2.0 to set that sort of thing on the config
screens. Go have a look, I can barely rem,embver 1.3

C is portable, but stuff you code in C isnt :)
ie. IF you use the C standard stuff it will
be portable, but with the standard stuff you cant do
gfx, guis or anything, so it would be pretty much useless

Well, it can't be that hard to port gfx engines etc. Look at the
ports of Doom/Quake from the PC. If you write nice code then it
shouldn't be /too/ hard to port to other systems.

it still has a lot of rewriting involved. both doom and quake
used c2p, so all that needed to be changed were the drawpixel
and screen handling routines, and music and that. But anything like
Bobs is impossible to port easily.

Um.... sorry. If anyone wants to I 'spose they can simply send me
an email with the Country they are from, and all their Amiga

The interpreter (editor) and compiler can use different
configuation files. It can be quite frustrating. Track that
down and make them both point to the same one, or make them
both the same.

You probably have both
s:AMOSPro_Interpreter_Config
Amospro_system:AMOSPro_Interpreter_Config

or something similar.

A few years ago there was an Amos disk magazine being distributed called Mr
Amos and the person behind it was Brian Bell. I have all issues of this

tutorials. My main conern is copyright as I would not like to infringe by
distributing the disks. Does anyone know the whereabouts of Brian Bell or

I have just looked, but I only have the Interpreter config in S:
-- there is none in the AmosPro_System directory.

Also, what's the difference between "AmosPro_Compiler.lib" and
"Compiler.lib" -- I have both of these in AmosPro_System.

leto,
Don't take my word as gospel but I'm guessing Compiler.lib is the
the Amos 1.3/Easy Amos version of the compiler library and
AmosPro_Compiler.lib is the AmosPro version. Maybe
Compiler.Lib is the basic compiler library and AmosPro_Compiler.lib
is like and extension lib with the extra stuff for compiling AmosPro, that
would explain why you needed both of them. Well that's my guess.

If you want a faster command use 'Cls' as it does the job faster, and the
ink command is included all in one..
eg. Cls 2,100,100 to 200,200

Hmmm, I've just taken a look at the website, and this new basic thing
looks like a cut-down version of EasyAMOS with a stupid Power-Goo like
interface. From what I've read about it, its designed for lerning Basic,
not writing anything really good and with only 120 odd commands it can't
possibly be as diverse as AMOSPro (which has 700+).

Of corce, I could be completely wrong. This could be much better then
AMOS. Perhaps someone will buy this and report back to the list if its
worth buying it?


But, even if it is /better /then amos, we'd still need to use it on an
icky PC! (can't be anywhere near as fun as on an AMIGA ;)

See ya.

Well, the point wasn't to imply that it is better than AMOS...

There are some people on this list who have been looking for a PC
version of AMOS... this looks very close to AMOS on the PC and
MAC... it might not have the full command set of AMOS Pro, but
I never used more than a hundred of the commands anyway and this
is only the beginning (as in FIRST version) of the PC/MAC development
kit, so in time... :-)

I havnt used it, but I saw its syntax, its horrible !

Example:

Dim X
Dim Y
Dim Z
Dim A$
Dim....

you cannot dim more than 1 var on a line, yuk!
it also looks like, a language for beggineers only.

amos else if bug

(Date unavailable)
"Alastair Murray" <malcolm.murray@virgin.net>


Can I just point out an annoying bug in AMOS in the hopes it will be
repaired soon.

The compiler freezes if a program contains a whole string of "else
if"'s.

In the absence of a "case" command the else if speeds up a program
quite a bit from lots of ifs, endifs but if there are more than ten or
so it won't compile!

Thanks,
-Murray

LOL... well, I am not so sure that you have to Dim everything
individually like that... I think that is probably for illustration
purposes only.

To us... as programmers... something like...
Dim X, Y, Z, A$, etc
... might look "better"

But they are trying to target new people into programming, just
like AMOS did, so the examples are kept very straight forward
and more readable... as in...
Dim X
Dim Y
etc.
... this makes things a little more clear and easier to follow.

At least I hope that is what they are doing... LOL I don't know,
personally I use C/C++ and am about to get into PC Assembler,
but I still think this new PC Basic development is of interest to
some AMOS programmers on this list.

Compilation Error!

Thu Dec 10, 1998 8:28 am
"Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>


While trying to compile my first program since downloading the new library
updates from the AMOS Factory site, I ran into a compilation error. I am
using the GUI compiler shell and the error I am getting is

Cannot Load AMOS.Library
Work:AMOS_Pro/APSystem/GUICmp failed return code 20

This error is only given when I compile with the library included. When
compiled with no library, my amiga crashes when I execute the newly compiled
program.

Any help would be appreciated.

Declan.

Pretty much , thanks

plus allegro and maybe plus direct x , since I work on multimedia

Just type...
lha -r a RAM:ArchiveName.LHA RAM:DrawerName/*
...for example. This would archive the entire path and contents of
RAM:DrawerName into an archive called ArchiveName.Lha which would
also be created in the RAM drawer.

Thank you. Glad to see that someone found the info useful...
beginning to think I had stretched my neck across the chopping block
for no good reason. This is the AMOS list, but it is always good to
keep up to date on other developments and new languages and
tools... at least in my opinion.

I don't care for some of the PC development stuff either. In fact I
still use Personal Paint on my Amiga to create any new hand-drawn
artwork, just have not found anything on the PC which has the same
"feel". Paint Shop Pro is excellent for image processing but I cannot
seem to draw anything with it!!
On the other hand, POV-Ray is the first rendering software I have been
able to make anything with. LOL

Anyway, sure... always available to help out a fellow programmer.
Well, gotta move... can feel that axe coming down! LOL

It seems like your amos.library, as it says, can't be found.
If you compile a program without the library included it'll crash
your Amiga
when you try to run it and the library aint in LIBS: or any other
valid path.
AFAIK this happens only under WB3.0/3.1. In earlier vesions you'll
get an error message.
Check the library name, spelling and that there's no
leading/trailing spaces.

Well, of course it is... heck the experience alone would make it
worthwhile.

Also, the BASIC offered by Interplay is not directly compatible with
AMOS (or anything else for that matter)... it adds new audio/video
commands to BASIC like AMOS did, but they are not the same.

So... if you can make a TRUE PC version of AMOS then certainly it
would be worth continuing!!! Well, there's my opinion again. :-)

Off course it is , first , no one is really excited , just babling

very beguinners , its potencial has no use to us. Although it may be

OK, for all those that are interested here goes. My project is ....well Its
moving slowly ! Ive come up against some barriers, some of which even
proffesors of Stanford University in America can`t even help me with ! But I
think my problems lie in the fact that Im thinking Amiga Hardware. Ive
recently gone back to the drawing board and decided to make a few changes
which has set my "end of year" dead line back a while. But It is coming
along. The good thing about my project is that it is written by a Die hard

After 9 months in the military, I'M BACK! :)

In the LEqu.s - file there is a lot of strange label. But it is only a very
few of them that AMOS will accept (i.e. AMOS refuses to start if my extension
calls L_CopOf)
Is there no way in which an extension can turn off the amos copper list...?

Well the reason for this question is that i'm planning on creating an
AGA-extension. Yeah.
Am I too late out...? Has such a thing been created (I don't know much about
any late events since I've been in the Army)...

Sorry for very short letter.

Hi all!

This is totally AMOS-unrelated, but I thought there could be
SOMEONE who could make use of this new program I discovered
called "PowerSnap"! It is especially useful for users of YAM1.3
(and perhaps YAM2). What it does is allow you to copy and paste
from anywhere to anything! This means I can copy a URL from a
Read email in YAM (!) and paste it straight into iBrowse, or
anywhere else for that matter. It makes replying personally to
messages from the AMOS List a breeze.

Do a search for it on Aminet.

It's recommended.

Leto :)

Also, if anyone knows of where I can a /cheap/ 2nd hand 060 card
for my A1200 (with 8+ Mb RAM) ... I'd be interested :D

Season's Greetings from my side of the globe.

While I'm here, I thought I might as well tell everyone about my new toy:
'tis a brand new PII-450 with 10GB HD, 128MB SDRAM, CDR/RW 6x/2x, DVD
32x/5x, Voodoo2 Banshee, nVidia TNT, etc. What's more is that it's a
Gateway! (yes I said Gateway).. lol, I can just hear the flames now! So
you'll have to excuse me if I'm a little wanky in any future messages. :)

This new "cow", though, is the reason for my absence this week, as I've had
to port, configure, and reconfigure alot of things (and rest assured I'll
be tweaking settings for many more weeks to come.. ah, what fun!). Btw, for
those who've been to my site this past week.. thanks. I fully intend on
getting the rest of the areas up over the next few days. Anyhow, laters.

Dim() problem.

Sat Dec 12, 1998 7:07 am
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


I had this problem awhile back and mailed the List about it. Predictably
enough, as soon as I had mailed the List, I found the answer to my problem:

Why won't these statements work?
Dim(64*5, 64*5) eq. 102,400 elements
Dim(1920, 10, 5) eq. 96,000 elements

The manual rendered the answer: "You can define an array with any number of
divisions, with upto 65,000 elements." (paraphrased). Anyhow, I found (like
it said) you can only define an array with upto 65,000 elements. Since I
found the answer to my question, why am I mailing the List with it again?

Namely for the fact that I need to use arrays bigger than this (and don't
NO ONE mention banks right now; I know what I'm talkin about and if I
WANTED to use stinkin' banks, I would) :) I would prefer arrays at least
double what AMOS allows, so, in namely talking to Pietro: is there any
chance of fixing this, Piet? It shouldn't be to hard to do this, I wouldn't
think? Just curious as to your thoughts on this. If you do it, lemme know.

Hurray! AGA extension. (not much use when the new version of AMOS
comes out though)

Anyway, I guess you'll just have to say "call 'Copper Off' at the top
of your program before using the AGA commands".

That'll turn amos's copper list

See ya.

Off-Topic: Amiga Devices

Sat Dec 12, 1998 6:33 pm
"Rune J. Keller" <keller@vip.cybercity.dk>


I'm currently experiencing a lot of trouble with my Phase 5 Fastlane
SCSI-controller and the appropiate z3scsi.device. I used to have an old
version which couldn't handle CDDA-data due to some bug. Thus I got a new
version, which works better, except now I can't use my SCSI scanner anymore!

Of couse I COULD change the EPROM chips (the one I have updated) everytime I
had to use my scanner, but that is obvious a poor solution. I guess the idea
would be to change the device software-based. However Phase 5 haven't released
the device files. They do however have released some ROM files which I guess
is to be used for burning the EPROMs. But these files doesn't work as Amiga
devices (eg. they're not executable).

So finally my question is: how can I get the device ROM file (either from disk
or directly from the EPROM) to work as a standard device.

If anyone can help me just slightly, please write me and I can explan further.

Thanks.

Amos programming desires

Sun Dec 13, 1998 6:52 am

I'm getting back into programming a game with Amos Pro. The design I'm
working with is okay for now, but could the guys who are programming the
fixes check into a couple of things for me?

1. Can it be possible to use screens large than 1024x1024?

2. Can we open screens with more bitplanes, up to eight? Same for Bobs?

3. Is there a way to keep the stored graphics in Fast Ram instead of Chip
Ram?

If the code can't be patched to allow for these things, is there another way
to accomplish this?

I need to be able to open a display ideally 2048x2048 in 64 or 128 colors, I
plan to use Bobs, up to 64 at a time, with at least 32 colors if not more.

Please help,

storing graphics in FAST RAM help needed!

Sun Dec 13, 1998 8:04 am
Cori Skagen <lskagen@ssm.ca>


Okay, I'm writing a dungeon game, ala Dungeon Master or Eye of The Beholder,
but its full screen, and in 64 colours, now each different wall takes up
about 140k, I use paste bob or paste icon to put them on a double buffered
screen, but I need to store other walls as well as doors, archways, ect.,
all taking up the same memory, as you can see my 1 meg of chip memory isn't
going to be enough, but funny thing is I have 16 megs of FAST ram not being
used hardly at all,

Keep in mind that each wall or doorway or whatever consists of 28 different
images for all the possible angles and distances of them.

I need a way to be able to paste them onto the screen with masks, and store
them in FAST ram, and using multiple bob banks won't help, because they are
all stored in chip memory, also loading bob banks as I need them out of say
the RAM disk is still way too slow (I have to draw 28 images for every step
you take, and thats for just the basic dungeon),

Unless I can paste some of these images directly from fast ram, I'm afraid
my game won't go any further.

Now something interesting I found, is that the C BLOCK commands, are pasted
to the screen, from Fast Ram, unfortuntealty, they don't have any mask
whick I need, pre loading the images into c blocks before a level is
started wouldn't be a problem and they are fast(just as fast as paste bob
or icon).

Any ideas? please I'm desperate, this is a problem that must be solved.
I'm amazed nobody has come up with some assembly code to do this, If I knew
more about assembly and Amos screen structures I could probably do it
myself, but I don't.

By the way anybody intererssted in looking at the game engine as it is so
far?
you can walk around a dungeon (walls only+floor & ceiling), and I'll include
my simple map editor(very simple, not nearly finished)?

just e-mail me and le me know

Well, with the current version of AMOS you can't do these things, but
a new version of amos is on the way which covers AGA etc. I think there
is an extention that lets you store gfx in fast though, but I can't
remember what its called.

As for your idea, why do you need such a huge screen? It would actually
be impossible to create a screen that big with more then 8 colours
because it would take more then 2megs, which is the chip ram limit.
(A 2048x2048x128 screen would take 3 megs!)

If you want to scroll a huge tile-based map around with
hardware-scrolling, then I've managed to put together a routine that can
scroll an infinite 16x16 icon map around, 50fps, with animated tiles on
my 040. (it drops below 50fps if theres a lot of anim tiles though).

I'm sure someone could probably develope a better routine then my
one, as it has some probs. with bob updates.

See ya.

Lets see. A quick calculation reveals that 2048x2048 with 128 colours
would use up more than 2 meg (more than all the chip memory in any
amiga)
And thats without double buffering.

Opening screens that big is not possible and I can't imagine why you
would ever need too. Use software scrolling!

Hi Everybody,

Does anyone mind a 85k file coming through this list?

The file in question is my new rpg's map routine, which features *FULL*
*SCREEN INFINITE(ish) ICON MAP SCROLLING WITH ANIMATED TILES AND ALL AT*
*FULL FRAME RATE ON MY 040 AMIGA!!!!!*
/Phew!!/

I have, of course, taken all other game routines out, but the map
scrolling and bob display routines work.


This source comes with one simple licence,

If you want to use this, you *MUST* do the following:


1. Get it faster, Clean up the code, Fix all bugs & Send me back a
copy when you've done that.

2. Send me a copy of anything you write using it.

So anyway, if I get less then 20 people's objections to me sending
it, then it'll be on the list tomorrow.



PS. Is this the most over-hyped thing since the PentiumII? Probably ;)

See ya.

TGE announcement

Sun Dec 13, 1998 9:38 pm
jono <jono@enti.demon.co.uk>


Hello to you all out there,

I have been instructed by Peter Cahill to release a preview of The Game
Extension (TGE) i.e. a limited lib version. With this version you will be able
to open AGA screens, load pics and use many of the drawing, system and misc
commands. However, bobs and some screen functions are not in this preview
version.

I will be releasing the preview files soon, along with GMS (which is needed to
run most of the commands, including all gfx commands). This lib supports CD32
controllers. The full version of TGE will be out in the new year.

Thanks,

Jono

I understand that a 2048x2048x128 screen is that large, which is why a
routine to keep it in fastram would be nessessary. I would prefer not to
use a tile based map, but I'd be very interested in what you came up with.
If possible can you send me your routine.

As for the bitmap size, I read that the Micro$oft game "Close Combat: A
Bridge Too Far" would load in bitmaps 4megs in size, and scroll around
that. As the player moved off the map a new 4meg section would load in.
I'm really after a way to accomplish this.

I have often been bothered by the stupid 1023 width limit. Of course never for
scrolling, but I play alot with video and for titles I prefer to use AMOS to
get a quick result. But as you can't do any anti-aliasing (fast enough anyway),
I just do a really big bitmap and scale it down using anti-aliasing in eg.
ImageFX. I seldom use more then 1 plane for this and 1023 pixels is a bit too
little. 2 meg chip? Yeah, but people have gfx-cards (like 8MB myself) and this
is surely the way to go.

I have a 4 meg 3D graphics card. I have a monitor for said card. I have an
interface for the card. The interface doesn't work. I have a thousand

When was the last time you saw a gfx card with hardware scrolling?
(correct me if I'm wrong :)

Anyay, who says you can't copy the whole image in fast ram and then
copy it back to chip line by line. With 1 plane it should be quite fast
even with amos!.


If you like I could probably knock one up quickly.

See ya.

Hi Everybody,

OK, its the moment that one or two of you have been waiting for.


Heres all you'll need to use it.

Remember, if you want to use it you must improve it, send me a
copy of your new version, and if possible, a little credit to me in your
game ;) (A copy would be nice too)


Also, if you can, /*Please */improve my map routine! I really need a
better version for my RPG, and whoever manages to write the best routine
will get /at least/ a huge mention in the games credits!!!!
(every one else'll get a smaller mention too!)

help needed with Pasting objects

Tue Dec 15, 1998 11:03 pm
Cori Skagen <lskagen@ssm.ca>


This is my second post on this subject, maybe nobody got the first one?

I need to be able to store graphics in FAST ram for pasting to the screen,
eg icons
I'm making a dungeon master like game, which is full screen, and each
different wall, door, ect takesa up a 140k object bank, they consist of 28
different images corresponding to the different views.

I have an ECS Amiga 2000 with 1 meg chip, and 15 megs of FAST ram, if I
can't store graphics in FAST ram, then there is no way I can continue with
this project, which would be a shame, becuase I have some really good
ideas.

If any one has any ideas on this problem, please let me know,
also if anyone wants to take a look at what I've got so far, I'd be glad to
send them a copy.

Maybe you should try to go a bit deeper in the system? You can load every
icon you need in a memory bank, then AllocMem() in fast ram with length of
bank, erase that bank, and continue the process. When you need an icon you
can just make memory bank and CopyMem() or CopyMemQuick() from fast to
that bank. That should work, and shouldn't be too slow. An easier way, but
a bit slower could be copying all .abk files to RAM: disk, and loading
needed from there, one by one.

SamplingExtension Idea

Tue Dec 15, 1998 12:34 pm
Dennis Lenz <dl80@gmx.de>


Amos PRO - Audio/Sampling-Extension

hmm...what ya think about it? shall i try to realize it??
let me know: dl80@gmx.de

*** some ideas for a sampling/audio-extension for amos by d.lenz ***

features:

-allows sampling to RAM or DISK in Stereo up to 44khz
-playback on up to 64 stereochannels (68060 req.)
-realtime effects for all recording/playback-channels like
hall,echo,chorus,pitch,denoise,metall,robot,synthlike,vocoder & more
-nice vumeters for live input
-fantastic easy commands, like:

AS Sam Play n,c,p

plays sample number n on channel c (1 to 64) at position p
(-64 = left , 0=center , 64=right). Before you can use
AS Sam Play you must use AS Load Sam to load a sample

AS Sam Cut n,s,b
number,start,bytes
cuts out bytes b of sample n starting at s


AS Sam Stop
stops playing samples

AS Show Sam n,x1,y1 to x2,y2

display sample in buffer n on the screen as graphical wave
starting from x1,y1 to x2,y2 using the current ink colour.
if you enter "live" instead of n then this command displays
the live input coming into the sampler. (must activate AS Rec Live On
before)

AS Rec Disc n,l,f,0

record a sample to disk into buffer n with length l at frequency f
in mono format (0). 1 would be stereo. if you enter 0 for length, than

rec disc will record until you press a key(mouse,joy)


AS Rec Mem n,l,f,0

the same as above, but recording into RAM

AS Rec Live ON

activate the sampler. useful for realtime effects. the input from the
sampler will be send to amiga audio output.

AS Rec Live OFF

deactivates the sampler.

AS Effect Live n

add realtime effect number n for manipulating
the input signal. (effects go from 1 to x?)
(must activate sampler before using this command)

AS Effect Sam n,s

renders effect number n to sample buffer number s

AS Stop Effect

will stop any rendering from effects to samples.

AS Sam Buffer v

sets the sample buffer v for realtime effects and for
sample playback. v means value (from 100 to 20000)

AS Rec Stop

stops any recording. will also stop AS Effect Live.

AS Rec Listen On / Off

means that you can listen to recording while you
record a sample.
Must be switched On before using AS Effect Live

additional feature by alex:
AS Random Music(chords *ch)
generates random sounds, according to user edited chords. Chords are
played as a random melody sequence that can be saved to disk.
hmmm....lets think about it...
-----------------------------------------------------------------
AS Grab CD t,n (evtl. sampling statt grab verwenden)!

grabs title t of an audio-CD into sample buffer n.
the title will grabbed until you press mouse (joy,key)

AS Play CD(t)

plays track t of an audio cd. if no CD has been inserted than
an error will be generated (no audio-cd inserted).

AS stop CD
AS forward CD
AS reverse CD
AS pause CD
------------------------------------------------------------------

AS Load Sam f$,n

load sample f$ into sample buffer number n
(the AS Load Sam function is intelligent: if the size of the sample
that you want to play is bigger than the memory, then it will play
it directly from disk. AS Load Sam can recognises the following
formats:

-AIFF
-WAV
-IFF/8SVX
-MP3
-RAW
-RA28.8 / ISDN
-VOC
-SMP
-SAM


AS Save Sam f$,n,type

saves the sample number "n" in format "type" with name "f$" to disk
formats are these kinds like above (iff,voc,wav)

AS Enable 16bits

turns into 16-bit-mixing.
(better quality even on 8bitters)


AS Enable 8bits

turns into 8-bit-mixing.


vum=AS VU sch to ech

a option for making bars / vu-meters
sch means the starting channel and ech the last channel.
with this type of vu you can make for e.g. one mono vu (1 to 64)
or even all channels seperated, if you want

---------------------------------------------------------------------

whats your opinion? would this become a nice extension?
i think it WOULD, but the only problem is that i cant
program in ASM!! (arghh...i have to learn it first...)

...but i can say you, i REALLY miss an ext. like this for AMOS!!

Control keys, editing commands, it uses a smegging mouse ALL the time, the
sigs end up in the wrong place, I can`t figure out random sigs, it annoys
me, it is slow, it crashes all the time, it won`t do SMTP, errr, it won`t
access any of my other files, its a pain in the neck, it runs on a peecee,
it just isn`t any damn good.

I like the way it does users, html & base64..

Apart from that, I can`t find any other redeeming features.

Unfortunately, I know nothing about system programming, believe me I wish I
did, then I could just past the icons directly from fast ram. The idea
about loading .abk files from RAM disk, is way too slow, you see every step
you take it may draw anywhere from 3 to 28 of these images depending on the
map view in front of you, can you imagine for every different wall or door,
or stairway in that view, it would have to reload a new .abk file from RAM:
up to 28 times, per step, as you can see this would be prohibitivly slow.

any other ideas, or would you like to look at my program so far?

Hi there,

can it be, that AMAL is absolute crap??
i tried to make something with it, but always the colours are wrong
(even if i use "get sprite palette") and the sprites are placed
whereever ...

whats this? why cant do the guys of amos-factory an update for this REAL
problems??
or is someone here, who had done something good with amal??

OK, try

get bob palette

For A=0 to 15
Colour A+16,colour(a)
next


Its because the sprites are stored as colours 0-15 but they actually use
colours 16-31.

See ya.

Not absolute!

Just add 16 to every color index (color 0 -> 16, 1 -> 17 and so on). This has
nothing to do with AMAL.

> and the sprites are placed whereever ...

Use hardware coordinates instead of software coordinates (or is it the
opposite..?) Use X Hard, Y Hard, X Soft and Y Soft.

Hmm, sounds like you both nead a "real" mail client!
Well, my best idea would be to download eudora light.
Which is the best mail client i have meet on the pece (Which don't say much!)
I'm currently testing eudora pro, and i must admit that it's the best mail
client i ever met! (Well on the pece that is)

There is only one problem with eudora though! It stores all mail in one big
file!
IE "in.mbx" contains all your incomming mails, and there is an out.mbx too!
I personaly dont like that, but i don't think it's a problem for "normal"
users!
(What i don't like about the eudora way is that i'm running an mailinglist
and there is more work in getting a single mail from a large list of mails
than there is if all mails was stored by them selve! But if this is going
to be a problem then let me know as i have solved that problem!)

Believe me, it's much easier then it looks. I think that I could make you

Can someone send me the SceneEditor that came with the Turbo Extension? My
version was lost in a harddrive crash, and my original floppy disk is
damaged.

Also, is there a better scene editor out there that will let me create large
playfields that will work with AmosPro?

Has anyone had any problems using the scene editor commands? I remember
trying them out awhile ago, and they would constantly crash my machine, but
I'm going to give it a go again.

Lastly, My version of AmosPro with the latest lib files are still giving me
compiler errors. I can compile the program, but when I run it I get an
error on line 7, the compiled proceedure line. Can anyone help?

My system is:

Hi all

Jono someone-or-other was going to help me out with "something"
but he's going on holiday. The something I'm trying to do is a
proper top-down spaceship flying engine which allows the player
to fly in 32 directions (I have this) but also take into account
all that "motion phyics" or whatever, so the craft "flows" to a
new direction rather than jerks there.

So, if anyone has code they'd be willing to share, or would like
the challenge then I can send what I currently have, as I have NO
idea how to do something like the above.

You don't need any fancy math... besides that is always the slow way
to do things.

All you need to do is set up a Velocity based propulsion system...
XSPEED and a YSPEED.

Then you just need to track the current acceleration/decleration info, so
XACCEL and YACCEL.

And store the current direction the ship is pointing...
SHIPDIR

That is all you need for a realistic, easy to implement motion system.

What I would do is probably just create a tiny Data Table, also
known as a Lookup Table.

Now, you could use your floating point to create this Data Table, but the
actual values stored inside the table would be pure integers for max
speed.

So, you would have...
XDIRMOD(31), YDIRMOD(31)

Anyway, this Data Table would simply hold the x and y acceleration for
each of the 32 possible directions the ship could be moving.

Now, assuming SHIPDIR=0 means the ship is moving straight up (north)
then all you would need to rotate around is something very simple like
this in AMOS...
If JLeft(1) Add SHIPDIR, -1, 0 To 31
If JRight(1) Add SHIPDIR, 1, 0 To 31

There you go, you have your new Ship Heading...

Now, you can rotate all day and that would most likely not effect the
ship's motion, just where the ship is pointing and consequently where
it is firing.

So, to handle motion, we need to check for and apply thrust as it is
requested by the player...
Applying thrust is simply a matter of pulling our acceleration modifiers
from the Data Table, like so...

If JUp(1)
Add XACCEL, XDIRMOD(SHIPDIR)
Add YACCEL, YDIRMOD(SHIPDIR)
End If
Note: you will most likely need to cap these values, and in order to do
that in a way that mantains the integrity of the current Ship
Heading, the simplest and most effective way is to simply
create another tiny Data Table... this one would simply contain
the Maximum values allowed for XACCEL and YACCEL for each
of the 32 directions (Ship Headings).
Anyway, you would just stick a check inside the above If...End If

Okay, at this point all you need to do is apply your X and Y
acceleration to the current Ship Velocity...
Add XSPEED, XACCEL
Add YSPEED, YACCEL

Now, at this point there is still the threat of the Ship Velocity not
being capped, so you would need to keep the X and Y SPEEDs
within certain predefined limits, based on the Ship Heading(SHIPDIR),
you could use a tiny Data Table. :-)


Well, there you go... a fairly detailed explanation completely off the
top of my head, so I am sure it is flawed somewhere, but should give
you a good idea of the general principles involved.

Hi Leto,
Couple years ago I started to code a better version of Turboraketti. Right after
I had my inertia-code completed came Roketz and suddenly I had nothing to do.
Unfortunately the game-code have lost somehow but I managed to find an earlier
version of it. Actually it moves a ship on a static screen and has only 16
directions but it shouldn't be hard to convert it to scroll a screen with 32
dirs:-)

Hi Everybody,

Just a small bug I've found:

Once when switching between amos and workbench, amos got stuck with
the workbench palette. All the screens shared the same colours as the WB
screen and Colour/Palette statements didn't work. When I switched back
again Amos was fine again.

Any idea why? I've only ever got it to happen that once, so not a
serious bug.

True it is small which is why you must use software scrolling.

Software scrolling allows you to do that almost as easily.

Ahh.
You have several options which I use from time to time.
1. When there is a bullet shot or something that needs to remain in
the background, just paste it there. If the player leaves the screen
and comes back, it will be gone but for some small details that is
acceptable.

2. Make these craters permenant objects (I would use this for say a
dead body) so it will always be there.

3. Make lots of blocks destructable. So if a block gets blown up it
changes to a damaged version of the same block. This is a permanent
effect.

It'll never look quite as good as a huge bitmap but at least you won't
use up all your chip mem and have no room for sounds/bobs etc.

Of course, but until AMOS NG thats not possible.

I how been doing some research on something like that myself. Open a screen,
then use the command Screen Base to get the memory address of the screen.

I used it to get some standard information like width, planes and so on. It
might not be of use to you in this case, but maybe someone else cares, so here
it goes:

Address according to Screen Base
Bytes (1=Byte, 2=Word)
Description

$4C 2 Width ?
$4E 2 Height ?
$51 1 Bitplanes
$B4 1 Shown/Hidden ($00/$80)
$BD 1 Number
$C2 2 X Position
$C4 2 Y Position

thanx for the code, it might help me with storing in fast mem

by the way, the x and y sizes of an icon are the first two words(2 bytes
each)of the icon base, then the number of planes, then the hot spot, then
the actual image data stored planar of course.

and instead of using a library call, why not just use Amos's copy command

COPY start,end to destination.

As for having to keep a copy of each size of icon in memory, I think I can
fool amos into going to a chip memory bank for the actual image data, just
store the x and y values there and the image, and it should be no problem,
and change the icon pointer to the start of that bank.

I still have to experiment with it though, I'll let you know how it works,

thanx for your help.

by the way I found out myself, the command PHYBASE(N) will give you the
actual screen location where N is the bitplane of the current screen, its
wierd though, AMOS doesn't store all the bitplanes one after another, they
seem to be whereever amos wants to put them.

I've got an idea , we could open a section on the official amos site
to dump rotines , should they follow this type of license , and maybe
also some in-code description rule. Would't it be nice to us all?What

Eureka! I can store icons in fast mem

Sat Dec 19, 1998 9:18 pm
Cori Skagen <lskagen@ssm.ca>


I've made two procedures
1. copy a bob or icon bank into fast memory
2. paste objects stored in fast memory

The way it works is when it goes to paste it it copies the image from fast
to a chip work bank, and then tells the pointer in the icon bank to look
there, quite simple really, and relatively fast

I did a test with my objects 28 of them in all(a total of 130k)
just from an icon bank: 15 /60ths of a second
from fast ram: 19 /60th of a second

quite reasonable

these routines handle all bobs and icon regardless of size, and # of
colours,

ne1 want to take a look let me know..

What other problems are you having (lol)? I've been using Outlook Express
for almost a year now (very well since it was first released), and I REALLY
can't figure out how you could be having all those problems..? TRUE, it is
a piece of Microsoft software (hee hee), but still--no excuse.

Btw, it DOES NOT do random signatures but it _DOES DO_ SMTP..
One thing I like about it is support for multiple POP accounts. :)
If you need any help with it, mail me. I might be able to help.

I'm writing a dungeon master/eye of the beholer game, I was wondering if
anyone would be interested in checking it out, and being a beta tester?

Also, I need to know how it rouns on other people's machines., I'm coding it
for my system right now which is:
Amiga 2000 / AmigaDOS 3.1
68030/33
with 1 meg chip /14 fast
360 meg hard drive

what I need to know what is considered an average Amiga sytem these days?
my program will runs adequaetly on my system, AGA should be better becuase
it is graphically intensive, as well as memory intensive, I hope people
will have enough memory I figure 5 megs+

Anyone interested? I'd like people to take a look at it

Problems ? It is infuriating.

>Btw, it DOES NOT do random signatures but it _DOES DO_ SMTP..

Aha !! How do I set it to receive smtp then ?

>One thing I like about it is support for multiple POP accounts. :)


I like the way the inbox auto moves stuff around. Still, with infinate
email addresses on demon, it works quite nicely without, but that is nice.

>If you need any help with it, mail me. I might be able to help.

What I want is a TEXT editor for email, and word processor for other stuff,
not some half hearted joining of the two like outlook express.

Oh, that and fast editing, and loads of missing features.

Anyone wiht an amiga on the net is likely to have 5megs of ram or more, or
nothing will load. Count on 4fast, 2chip for most. Yeah, I know Giark will

Beta Testers Needed

OKay, I have a few people interested in being beta testers, instead of
sending it to each of you individually, I'll set up a web page for it
today, I'll let you all know when its ready.

Everybody, keep in mind, that I don't have much more than a basic dungeon
engine, and a very simple editor, but I think the engine is top notch, I
think you'll
agree, the graphics are all 3d rendered so they are pretty decent, actually
I found 3d rendering the only way to get a good view of the dungeon, but it
turned out great especially considering I'm using only 64 half bright mode
for the game, and the dungeon walls I currently have only use 8 of those
colours(well 16 8+8 half).

I have some big hopes for this game, especially now that I can store all the
graaphics in fast ram(finally)

thanx for your help

Okay, here's the produdures for copying a sprite or icon bank to faat and a

take a look, fool around with it, change it whatever, if you ever use it, I

I've noticed that recently the AMOS editor seems to cause any other

Even simple programs like Cygnus Editor seem to often crash before
they even load when AMOS ed is in the background.

Is this some bug of the latest librarys?

For modify some attribute ex: NlistView.mcc for multicollumn .

Kind regards,

They were sent as base64 encoded text, a habit of peecee software that needs
to die. Unfortunately, this nasty piece of junk software I am using decoded
it automatically, so I didn't notice to compain also.

>To Rune: could u resend them to the list, or just send me them privately if

Rune, set your software to send raw text to the list, and click of the
base64 encoding, and set it to printed text, preferably 7bit. Nggg.

Yeah, of course it is possible. With this mail I would just like to know, how
many people is interested in such an area. You might mail to me personal or
the list.

If we do such a thing, I think we should come up with some standard guidelines
for submitted code. In 2 secondes I came up with the following:

Store code in .asc (no problems with different extensions)
Store only small and necessary banks as standalone files.
Include a .readme in each arcive with info like this:

Name: CD32_control v1.13 (21. dec 98)
Author: Rune Keller (keller@vip.cybercity.dk)
Description: Use all buttons of a CD32-controllerpad
Required: AMCAF, TGE

Followed by a longer description. The above should also be included in each
source-file (.asc)

What do you think of this?

Cool , I also think there also should be a guideline for in-code
documentation(Rem). A very simple guideline so it dosen't bother the
programmer. With this we could have codes easyer to read ,
unfortunantly , I can't come up with any guidelines for this matter
but I believe Andy H could help on this,what you think ?

Hope more people gets interested , can you imagine how faster we
could put up our ideas so them later work on the details?

hi Cori,

i saw this Bug few weeks ago and posted it already here. I have tested
few
different resolutions and come to this conclusion:

cant past after ~600 x-location on screen with large width (no matter
what
height)
cant past after ~550 y-location on height screens (no matter how width!)

it dont depends to the deoth of the screen, it happens on 2 colur
screens
also on 32 colored screens. :(

I have used the Icon function instead but it surely not a repleacement
for
a Bob if you need really a bob :(

I think its a great idea. The only thing I'd like to add, is a standard way
to time test the performance of the code. It would be great to know how
optimized a certain routine is. I don't know if just running the code in a
loop 1000 times and printing timer/1000 is the answer. I'd like to deek
the hardware for a more accurate timing, or some other answer.

Count me in.

>Store code in .asc (no problems with different extensions)

Well. I have had some problems with "Merge Ascii" (i.e. not all empty lines
are included)
I can see that it is a problem that you cannot read a program without all
extensions, but... I don't like the ASCII idea.

>Store only small and necessary banks as standalone files.

Yep.

>Include a .readme in each arcive with info like this:

Yep.


And I would add:

- Try to seperate things. If you have a routine and a small program to
demonstrate it then save the routine in its own file and then INCLUDE it into
the demonstrating program.
That way it's easier for other people to implement your routine.
- If you expect other people to read oyur source, then COMMENT IT!

Yes , great idea , so we can always keep track of the
fastest/smallest routines. I can't come up with any idea to
benchmark a code fragment , but I think this should be very well
considered.

Actually, for small routines and procedures that you are talking about
this should be quite sufficient.

Although, an alternative method would be to set up a little loop counter
and just see how many times the routine can be called and performed
within say 100 VBls... (Timer clicks).

This is the way I time things... How many reps per a certain amount of
time. It is very easy to find the clear winner when comparing two
routines this way... and easy to see how your optimization attempts are
effecting the code... makes you happy when you can squeeze out
another ten loops or so in the same amount of time!!

Just my three cents worth... :-) LOL.

Cool, as long as your code isn't spending too long working out if it's run
out of time. Or are we doing something like..
t=timer+100
while timer<t
'insert code here.
inc reps

Hahaha. :) Yep, that is exactly the process I was referring to.
Looks very optimized already, although you could also do...

Maybe there should also be some directory structure, I have no idea how to

AmosPro File Selector

Thu Dec 24, 1998 7:18 pm
Christopher Kossa <abattoir@erols.com>


Hello...

I was wondering if anyone knows how to make the priority of the AMOSPro
File Selector from -1 to about 15? I'm trying to print a lot of stuff from
Final Writer and work with AMOS, but everytime I call a file selector AMOS
pauses unless I raise the task priority with SysInspector. Is there anyway
I can make this change permanently?

P.S. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all

I think you have answered your own question. Instead of putting `Ink 5' in the
main part of your program, put `OLDINK=5 : Ink OLDINK' then when your Every-
called procedure changes it the `Ink OLDINK' restores it. Obviously, OLDINK
must be a global or shared variable.

The Problem With Timer and VBI

Fri Dec 25, 1998 2:20 am
Stephen Lebed <slebed@ix.netcom.com>


The reason I suuggested an alternative to using loops or the vbi commands
for timing code fragments is that on systems with 040's and 060's, small
routines may or maynot fit within the processor cache. I'm not sure if
this is even an issue with a compiled amos program, but anything we can do
to squeeze out more performance would be great.

Hmmm. I am using YAM (on the Amiga) - and the strange thing is that the
encrypting happens randomly - and only on messages send to the list...
Can it have something to do with the characters, I use in the messages...?

I don't think it's my mailer that's having problems since it's only messages
send to the Amos list that's causing troubles...
I'll try the thing out with special characters...

It's not a question about coordinates, it's a question about screen sizes.
You cannout past object farther from Logbase than 65535 bytes.
Yes, you have found another (old known) bug.

You can, however, Screen Copy to locations below that boarder, so that is a
way to go around the bug.

Special characters, amos list bug

Fri Dec 25, 1998 9:42 pm
Rune Zedeler <rune@zedeler.dk>


I tried the special character thing out.
I send a clean message as well as a message with some special characters to
the list as well as to my self...

The clean message to the list as well as both messages to my self came clearly
through, but the special character message to the list returned to me garbled.

This must be a bug in the AMOS-list server...
I'll try to track down exactly what characters that is causing troubles...
Sorry for lots of strange messages on the list.

Damn. The problem is that the server adds the

So a message looks something like:

And some mailers can't handle that.

I don't know how to turn off base-64 encoding from YAM.

It can't be true that we can only use characters <128...!

Anyone....????

Sorry for having you to use your delete buttons and spoiling the x-mas peace.
Hope you don't hate me now.
Now, this is the last message i'll spam outto the list.

If I use characters >128 in my msg then YAM tries to both "BASE64 encode" the
message and "quoted-printable encode" it.
And then it uses the smallest of the two.
That means that if I use lot's of strange characters then it'll be
BASE64-encoded and things go wrong.
If I use only few of them then the msg will be quoted-printable-encoded - and
then things will work out just fine.

I don't think it poosible to turn off the size-testing from YAM (or simply to
use plain 8-bit transmitting). So I'll just leave out my logo from future
messages :-(

Any of oyu know why YAM can't simply send 8bit messages...?

Then we got that cleared up, and again SORRY for not thinking and just spaming
mails outto the list instead.

ARGH!
How do you read the current ink-colour...?!?!
(silly question, I know, but I can't figure it out...)

Well, my problem is that i have an Every-called procedure that draws something
on the screen.
As the procedure can interrupt anything it does ofcourse not work that it just
changes the ink-colour. Therefore I would like to do something like

Procedure EVRYPROC
OLDINK= (Current Ink Colour)
Ink NEWINK
DRAW_A_LOT_OF_FUNNY_THINGS
Ink OLDINK
Every On
End Proc

What can I do...?

The reason YAM can't send 8bit messags, is because it uses SMTP (Simple mail
transfer protocol) which uses only ASCII chars 0-127, I don't believe there
is such thing as 8bit mail, thats what base64 and quoted printable are
for...

Re: Ship flight code

Thanks to those who posted some info on trying to make a decent
flying ship, but unfortunately most of this doesn't apply to the
code I currently have (just the turning and flying to any angle).
It uses Sin() and Cos() math functions to determine smooth speed
up / slow down.

If anyone is overly eager to help, I reckon I could send the code
to look at. I'm sure it's possible to adapt it to allow for
"smooth" turning and flowing flight, but I guess I'm just not
smart enough.... :(

Hi all,

Has anyone got an Easy Amos manual for sale? My dad has decided that he
wants to have a go at programming and has read an old Amiga Shopper
article that recomends Easy Amos.

Anyone interested in a sort routine that sorts an array of 1000 no's in
2 secs? I found it in a pc mag & adapted it for Amos, its better than
bubble sorting which is the only other way I know

Amos Pro fix needed

A couple of requests:

1)I'd like to know if the guys who are fixing AmosPro can look at the bug
with the IFF ANIM command?

Right now, if you play an anim5 animation with a frame whose delta is
greater than 40000bytes, the animation playback becomes corrupted.

2) Can you guys enhance the anim commands to allow playback of anim7 or
anim8 animation files?

3) Is there an extension that will let me playback animations from the
harddrive or cdrom?

I have a routine that I'm using now, but I'd like a better one if
available.

4) Does anyone want to help me write a better routine?

Thanks in advance,

Hiya Rune,

I notice you've got other messages above, but in reply to weird
encrytion -- when I first joined to AMOS list, most (not all) of
my messages which I posted were all stuffed. This actually also
occured to other individuals occasionally too. I found that it
was a (very nice) squiggly line I had in my "signature file". It
used "alternate" characters, such as Alt+8. Since I've changed
it everything has been fine.

Well, if you insist on using these higher math functions you can
build QCOS() and QSIN() Data Tables to boost the speed.

Sure, send it over... I will take a look. Be warned though if it is
not "clean" and well-documented when I receive it, it will be when
I send it back! LOL :-)

I am currently working on a PC Christmas Demo... I know
Christmas was yesterday but I just started on Wed. and between
"normal" Christmas activities and tracking down suitable graphics

Anyway, if someone wants to check out the PC Christmas Demo

Yep, I have the same problem.
I don't exactly understand it, but somehow PIV flickerfixer only works
correctly on system screens.
Like if it uses some strange system-thing to check weather or not the screen
is in interlace (instead of just reading the hardware)...
PIV just sucks, I guess... :-(

Don't know what you can do about it.

Hardwarely impossible.

You can do it by using screen copying 2 seperate screens onto 1
screen side by side, but you can't display two different screens on the
same line.

To be honest, AMOS doesn't seem to display interlaced screens
propperly on my AGA amiga anyway, even with the newest libs. (It misses
out a layer every now and again)

I guess you'll have to stay clear of interlaced screens, until a new
amos comes out ;)

How do you want it? (oohhh :o)

Hello everyone,

How do you want the TGE pre-beta? (it's a bit messy at the mo ;)

Through the list or on my site? (www.enti.demon.co.uk, I'll put it there
anyway)

It's about 350k with GMS aswell...

With this pre-beta, there is no bobs and proper screen copying control. Please
don't use any of the bob commands, listed in the guide.

Many of you may think that this releae is pointless in it's current state.
However, getting to even this stage was a great task for Pete..with many bugs
in GMS. You can open AGA screens, load pics....use many gfx drawing commands,
CD32 controller commands. THere are many useful things even in this 'quite'
uncompleted lib.

If the intaller ends up 'not-working' (sorry), follow the instructions for
installing by hand, in the guide.

I hope this gives you a small incling as to what TGE will eventually be. Don't
expect too much from this lib, but what IS there IS good.

Sorry about the lack of demos, etc...but hopefully you will be able to catch
on from the few that are there. I may be able to help if you get stuck.

Thanks for listening,

Jono (writing on behalf of an internet-less PAC, 'till January)

GUI Listview Deselect

Wed Dec 30, 1998 5:37 am
Christopher Kossa <abattoir@erols.com>


Hello All...

Right now I am using the GUI extension V1.75. I am working on my first
project with it and I have a few questions.

1) I was wonderng if someone can tell me if it is possible un-highlight an
item in a listview.

2) I have tons of info that have to go into a listview. Is there any way
to trick the GUI into reading the entries of a listview from a memory bank
instead of an Array?

3) What would be the easiest way to make a (gulp) MUI application with
AMOS?

no :(

If you are exceptionally lucky (unlikely) you might (unlikely) be able to
recover any files on it after a quick format (unlikely).

Nonono, I have also been thinking 'bout making an AGA-extension - and I'm
kinda interrested in other alternatives (like: do I have to make my extension,
or can I used yours? How good does it work?)

I'll look forward to seeing it :)

If you make a partition bigger, then you dont need to format it again, the extra
space
will just be there. this may not be true in all cases, so if it screws up
your hd, plz dont blame me!

Hiya,

It's now on the site in the demos section...

For gfx card users, I'm afraid you'll have to install GMS and the lib
yourselves (the installer was done in amos).

Thanks.

The correct answer is NO. Changing the size of a partition changes
where the file system root block is located, hence, making one
bigger or smaller, by even 1 cylinder screws EVERYTHING. To change
a size reliably, you must backup anything you want to keep, change
the partition sizes, reformat the changed partitions, and restore
from backup. (I recall one very long day with disksalv and a 1200,
trying to reconstruct five partitions on a friends drive when the
rdb was accidentally overwritten, painfully moving the boundries
one step at a time . . . bleaahhh!)

2 questions,,,,

Fri Jan 1, 1999 1:12 am
Cori Skagen <lskagen@ssm.ca>


First question,

1. Can I load a font directly without having to always load the font list
from disk?
I know the Amcaf extension can, but I only have the shareware version, and I
need to compile..

2. Can I redimension an array?
Amcaf: same as abobe.

There is a routine to use LDos to get fonts.
