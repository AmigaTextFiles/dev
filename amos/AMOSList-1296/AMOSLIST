Switch to 8 colours and set the colours as so..

1: 10,10,10 - Mid Grey
2: 0,0,0    - Black
3: 15,15,15 - White
4: 6,8,10   - Blue
5: 9,9,9    - Low Grey
6: 11,11,11 - Brite Grey
7: 11,10,9  - Browny 
8: 15,11,10 - Pink

Then get into aminet and download yourself MagicWB.  This is a set of 
good looking icons that only use 8 colours.. (you probably already know 
all this.. =) )
 
I can't remember exactly where it is on aminet but someone else may be 
able to help you.. ?

Also you can now do 8 colour backdrops which look heaps better than the 
old ones.. if you want some examples, e-mail me and I'll send you my own 
personal collection.. =)

I run VirusZ as my virus checker (anything better?) and it reports on
changes in CPU Interrupt vectors in RAM (VBR: $00000000).  What all that
means, I do not really know.  :)  Anyway, I start AMOS Pro v2.  VirusZ pops
up saying the Exec interrupt Vectors in RAM for Audio ch. 0, 1, 2, and 3
are now non-standard.  I assume this is just EME taking the channels over.
No big deal.

I load the JWindows program, which I will list here:
On Error Proc _CLEANUP
Amos To Back 
Global SCRAPTAGS,MYWIND
SCRAPTAGS=J Create Taglist(9)
J Tag SCRAPTAGS,1,Equ("WA_InnerWidth"),400
J Tag Equ("WA_InnerHeight"),100
J Tag Equ("WA_Left"),100
J Tag Equ("WA_Top"),50
J Tag Equ("WA_CloseGadget"),True
J Tag Equ("WA_DepthGadget"),True
J Tag Equ("WA_DragBar"),True
J Tag Equ("WA_Title"),J Make String("Hello")
J Tag 0,0
MYWIND=J Open Window(SCRAPTAGS)
Wait 250
_CLEANUP

Procedure _CLEANUP
   If MYWIND Then MYWIND=J Close Window(MYWIND)
   If SCRAPTAGS Then SCRAPTAGS=J Free Taglist(SCRAPTAGS)
   J Free All Strings 
   Amos To Front 
   End 
   Resume 
End Proc

Everything is okay so far.  I run it:
Opens the window, sits there for about 5 seconds, system req pops up and
says AMOS Program failed (error #80000003) Wait for disk...
Also, VirusZ pops up with a change in vectors.  I view them and the only
change is in the CPU Int Vectors.  Division By Zero is now set to
$61666166.  It was $00f80a04.  I know it crashes at the MYWIND=J Close
Window(MYWIND) statement as I ran it through the Monitor and that is when
it crashes AMOS.  The Window is still there, I can move it and send it back
or forward.  Click close, nothing happens.

Now, if I run the next example that is the same as above except it waits
for IDCMP events and flashes the screen if you pressed a key, or closes the
window if you click the close gadget.  I run it and it works fine.  No
changes in the vectors, no crashing at the MYWIND=J Close Window(MYWIND)
statement.

Anyone have any ideas as to why it happens in this small program but not in
a larger, more complex, program?  Why a division of zero?

Does anyone else have JWindows?

Everyone's been putting in their $.02 on this WB question.  Here's my setup:

A 16 Color MWB with WBPicture backdrop on a 68000 is fine for my 
purposes.  I boosted it up from 8 because all the backdrops I had that 
wern't Greyscale looked like crap.  Its also Hires-NonInterlaced 640*256 
abecause I use large screen title fonts.  I have ECS (can't afford an AGA 
machine) and this is best for the very little WB work I do.

Newicons isn't just a set of replacement images - it is a program - you
need to download and run NewiconsV3. The idea is that the "new icon"
image is stored in the tool types of the normal WB icon - that way if
you use it on a machine where new icons isn't running you see a normal
WB icons - these will be the 4 colour icons that you saw. 

The actual new icon uses its own private colour map like an IFF picture
which uses as many colours as you want. The newicons program attempts to
find the closest match in your WB screen palette, how ever many colours
it has, allocating pens if necessary. Therefore that bit about new icons
being 16 colour was wrong too - they are anying from 2 colour to 24 bit
colour but are dithered into your screen colourmap. This is much better
than magic WB where you are limited to the authors favourite 8 colours.

I'd recomend NewIcons to anyone, but make sure its the latest version so
it will crash SwazInfo (if you use it). The complete package was on
CUAmiga CD3 and Amiga Format CD 4 (I think, may have been 5) as well as
aminet.

You may have some already - ever noticed a tooltype with a load of what
looks like uuencoded data and a message saying Icon by so and so - Do
not edit...

You won't see any real neat stuff if you just grab one of the icon update
packages.  NewIcons patches the system and lets you have isometric icons.  The
backdrops are good as well.

I've always found the 8 colour MWB icons to be incredibly ugly and blocky.

Well met and godspeed,

A while back I posted re: .mod ->.abk that was supplied with Amos 1.3, now
I've been asked to post it to someone else on the list who only has AmosPro.
I have no problem doing this but...

Is it legal?

Will this make me one of those nasty pirates who destroyed the 
Amiga Software industry? 

It was written by François himself, and has no mention of copyright in the
source.

Does he care? If so, does he have an address?

Some of the long time AMOS listers may like to give your opinion on this
one. I know a lot of this was discussed in the past, but what was the
general verdict?

Was anything 'official' ever heard from Mandarin/Europress?

Hi!

I've just uploaded two Amos-programmes to Aminet.
The first is game/hint/AB3-LCG.lha and generates levelcodes for the 
excellent game AlienBreed 3 - Tower Assault. If you like Tower Assult then 
you must have this.

The second is util/wb/FilePack.lha which tells you the status of selected 
files. You'll be told if it's packed, unpacked, size, size of directory and 
so on. A report can be generated as printout, ASCII or AmigaGuide. This one 
you MUST have!

Both programmes are made with the GUI-Extension and is fully multitasking.

Well, they won't give anyone the source to AMOS Pro without paying an arm
and a couple of legs.  It may take a group of people to donate legs if
someone wanted the rights to it.  Maybe some balls, too.

Umm.. is it Set Font, or Set time? ;)

I've never come across the problem - are you using Amos or AmosPro?

Anyway, I usually use the following procedure anyway - its much quicker:


' To call it:
OPENFONT["helvetica",8,0]
' To remove the font:
OPENFONT["helvetica",8,-1]
'

Procedure OPENFONT[NAME$,SIZE,_REM]

   NAME$=NAME$+Chr$(0)
   Dreg(0)=8 : Dreg(1)=0 : S=Execall(-198)

   Loke S,Varptr(NAME$)

   Doke S+6,0
   Areg(0)=S
   FONT=Gfxcall(-72)

      Dreg(0)=10 : Dreg(1)=0 : T=Execall(-198)
      If T=0

Its a 3 layer neural network written in Amos.
I have utilised it and nolonger require it!
But I thought its too good just to dump so I am sending it to yous 
guys.
I hope someone finds a use for it.

BTW 
What address does Screen Base return.

There was a solution to this given in the Amos Pro manual for this. I 
don`t have it with me so this answer may not be accurate but give it a go:
Try to reserve a memory bank that is huge. Amos tries to clear unused 
memory so if you`re not using them the fonts will be cleared. There`s 
probably a more graceful way to do this though.....

I've discovered (what I think is) a bug in AMOS. The command "Set Font" can't
be called unlimited times in your source. I've also discovered that the
number of times "Set Font" can be called without an errormessage appears
varies. I haven't figured out what causes the number of times vary.

The first time I discovered the bug I could call "Set Font" 129 times before
I got the errormessage "Font not available at line xx" where xx was the
line I called "Set Font". But when I tried a diffrent source which also
calls "Set Font" a number of times in a loop, the program could call "Set
Font" 21 times before the errormessage appeard. Then I tried my source
again, and guess what? It also stopped after calling "Set Font" 21 times.

I talked to a guy on #Amiga who knew about this problem, and he told me had
got around this "bug" someway but he couldn't remember how.

Is there anyone out there who knows?

The easylife extension has commands El Open Font and El CloseFont which
basically does what this procedure does, but automatically closes the
fonts if your program is interupted / crashes or simply don't close them
again. I believe amcaf, craft and several other extension include
similar commands (but then easylife is free...)

The address of an internal AMOS structure that contains information
about the screen in question - it is not an intuition screen base. Most
of the useful stuff contained in it is accessible through AMOS commands,
but it is useful e.g. if you want the address of individual bit planes.

How can I use it? It's difficult? Does it really LEARN?

Hell(o) !
Here's ANTHRAX/ASPHYXIA here. I'm a c64 coder, but I
also try to make games on AMIGA (AMOS, little assembler)
On the good old c64 I'm coding only in assembler but on amiga
I started in AMOS, bcoz it is easier to use.
My first game is near ready to release, but who cares?
I found a little bug in AMOSpro.
I don't know is it new for you or not...   but:
when I want to use REM command in this same line with
DATA, for example:

read a : read b: read c
data 1 : rem first
data 2,3 : rem second , etc...

all is ok, but when you run this little proggy...

GURU!!!!! WHY????

I don't know, but I suggest you :

Put your comments in next line after data:

read a:read b:read c
data 1
rem first
data 2,3
rem second, etc...

all will work fine.
I have also a questions:
Maybe it is not about amos but maybe somebody will
help me. I created a demo version of my game and I
want to put it on aminet, but i dont know how.
Could you tell me how to put own proggs on aminet?
Where I can find adresses of software companies,
who will want to release my game? 
I know, that he's in amos, but I sold several games
on c64, so I know how to look good and fast game.
I used fast code routines, so my game is working 
fast & cool ;)
Please help me if you can!!!

you can also write:
anthrax@labeto.keto.polsl.katowice.pl
I'm waiting for your help!!!!!

I don't think you can do it, but you could think to replace the standard
Input command making your own procedure for the input: it isn't difficult.

Craft hasn't got such a command, but Amcaf does. Moreover, Amcaf allows to
store fonts in a bank; I think all amos coders should use it: I hate Amos
programs that scan all the fonts: drawer before loading the right one. I
cannot understand why Lionet did a so terrible thing.

Mmm. I found that the Amos Pro Manual and the Amiga Game Maker's Manual 
were a useful combination. Incidentally, does anyone know where to get 
the AMOS Pro compiler these days? A new release was promised early last 
year (by some enthusiasts who wanted to take it over) but that was the 
last I heard of it. I suppose I will have to rely on second hand from 
now on.

Michael Cox complained about J-Windows on 1st December

I have also had this problem, but, first, may I recommend that you download
GadToolsBox and design your GUIs with this.

After many hours of constant crashing, I found the solution:

If you include a line
J Tag Equ("WA_IDCMP"),0 (or whatever value you want, eg
Equ("IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW"))
It no longer crashes!

Wierd, huh!


PS
Does anyone know how to send e-mail through AMOS - I'm making a database,
and it would be nice to mail people directly.

Ok, letsee now, try 

open "t:email" for output as 1
?#1,"To: "+username$
?#1,"Subject: "+subject$
?#1,""
q=1
for n=1 to message_length
	?#1,message$(n)
next
close #1
execute "sendmail <t:email"

..and that should sort you out.  Put some sensible variables in it ;-)

Hellow Folx!

There is alot of bug's beeing reported in Amos Pro so here is what
i sugest some of you that are good in Assembler and dont care abouth
breaking the law should do:

Collect information on all the bug's reported and simply hack the
Amos.library and fix all the bugs and speed up some of slow commands.
And then spreadd the new Fixed version.

F.Lionet or what his name is has pointed out that he dosent care for
Amos anymore so FUCK him and let him play around with his crappy
"Click and Play" on the even more crappy PC and fix the bug's ourselves.

I love Amos and i would fix it myselves if i was good in Assembler, but
i am not.

Merry X-Mas!

--BOUNDARY.6917.2027.117914704.1
Content-Type: text/plain

Several questions and comments were exchanged recently regarding
the value of AMOS format music. As my opinions differ significantly
from the majority expressed, I thought I should pitch in my two
cents worth, even if they do arrive a bit late.

For musical power, the tracker format wins. No question. But, when
it comes to integrating music and sound effects into a production
(such as a game) the AMOS format can shine. Multiple play lists can
be used to give instant changes in the background music (for new
levels, dangers, special powerups, etc.) like so:
   Music 1
   Rem stuff happens
   ...
   Music 2

In addition, sound effects can be played on a single channel,
interrupting the music just for the duration of the effect, as in:
   SamPlay %1000,n
This does take a great deal of thought while writing your tune, so
that the chosen channel can be cut off at any point, but it is well
worth the effort IMHO. There are some bugs you'll discover if you
try to use more than one channel with this technique. (I have a
work around I'll share if there is interest.)

Here's how to use this peculiar music form.

First create the patterns you need in a tracker style program (I
like OctaMed.) I have never seen a music editor that works directly
with the AMOS format, so conversion is needed. See SoundTracker2.2
on AMOS PD Disk 233. Note that not all effects are translated 100%
faithfully. Experimentation is your only guide here.

To use the 'Music' command fully you will need to add some playlists
to the converted file. The mechanics are documented in the AmosPro
manual, but no utility was provided. That's what the attachment to
this rather lengthy note is. It is crude and has an unforgiveable
interface, but it works, and I'm giving it away. Just tell it how
many playlists you will have, and enter the block numbers for each
one (just like the tracker style play list, but you can have as
many as you like.)

Happy music making,
-Richard

I am having a problem with the AMOS Pro compiler. I am trying to compile
an AMOS Pro application, but the compiler generates an error:

Not an AMOS program.

We have had this error before and fixed it with command line arguments.
Unfortunately an ex-employee swiped the manual to the compiler and he
has since moved. Sigh.

Does anyone have any info on the compiler options I need to use to get
this program compiled. The program itself works fine under Amos Pro.

Thanks.

I used AMOS for a long time and i had the same problem before getting the 
EasyLife extension that provides new commands to manage fonts (you need 
no more SetFont, for example...). It works very well on every Amiga.
you can get Easylife on Aminet /dev/amos

Thats all very well, but the playback and conversion from PT to Amos bank
leaves alot to
be desired.  And if you buy EME, you can play samples over tracker music
anyway 8) 8)
(shameless plug there) - and you can even start from ANYWHERE in a module
(like you have
said with Music 1, Music 2).

The AMCAF Protracker Commands support sfx aswell. The AMOS music extension
sucks!

This also true for AMCAF Pt replay.

The conversion is absolutely broken... e.g

C-2 02A01
--- 00000
--- 00000
--- 00000

will end as

C-2 02A01
--- 00A01
--- 00A01
--- 00A01

and

C-2 02000
--- 00A10
--- 00A10
--- 00A10

will be played just as

C-2 02000
--- 00000
--- 00000
--- 00000

Just one of the thousand bugs in this crap music converter.

Hmmm, this is weird. It's a funny thing that I start getting mail 
from the list again after about 1 month of no activity. I hope I 
haven't missed anything of interest in the past month. If I have, 
please inform me. Maybe the mail bot is screwed..

Also remember to stop by my web site and check out the cool products 
I'm working on! My 3D-engine (being coded in AMOS of course, why 
would I be letting you guys know if it wasn't) is coming along very 
nicely, about 40% done, and the first game I'm going to use the 
engine in is about 15% finished, and I'm excited.

Hello all you nice people.
I need help! (not professional help, although my sanity currently has 
been slightly odd ;-)

Can as many people as possible send me two files!
A small text file.  One version is the original and readable.  The 
second file is a coded version of the first. (hope that makes sense)
I am training neural networks to decode, coded stuff!
I have already trained one to draw a smiley face on the screen when 
presented with an 8 bit binary count !

Hope you can help.

I remember I had that prob when trying to compile
a prog with memory banks. Try to compile the program
without any data, maybe everything goes well.

I think the actual problem was icon banks (bank 2). Remove that from the
file and load it in manually, then it should work.

The AMOS music extention is quite servicable for many uses.
It is stable, available as source code, and doesn't cost an
extra penny to use in whatever way one may desire. If that
equates to 'sucks' I will have to head back to school, as I
need a refresher in this language.

>The conversion is absolutely broken...

Absolutely? I have converted dozens of mods for various purposes,
and only a few have had any problems, of which only two couldn't
be repaired with a few simple changes. The conversion does have
many flaws, but once you know them, you can choose to avoid them.
Even in tracker format I have had several mods go sour over the
years as various enhancements to the replay code came along.

Incidentally, I found the executables from the AMOSPro compiler
to be so unstable, that I abandoned it for any serious purpose
long ago (GURU on RUN"another_prog" was the most troublesome as I
recall.) The last update to the AMOS compiler was much more stable,
so everything (my own extentions included) had to work in AMOS 1.36
as well. AMOS Pro serves me as a much improved editing environment
for the Creator, and little more. The limitations inherent in all
of the AMOS line have sadly pushed it out of the running for any
major future projects. Spending $25 on your swiss-army-knife is
just not justifiable in my case.

Lest someone think the above is AMOS-bashing, let me point out
that I love AMOS. Within about 2 days of breaking open my copy of
AMOS the Creator (which as I recall came with an update disk to
bring it up to v1.2) we ordered a copy for everyone in the office
who could even spell Amiga. Never before had the power been so
delightfully simple to obtain. When the quirks don't matter, I
still use it, and have accomplished many tasks I would have never
taken the time to do with any other lauguage at my disposal.

For those who, by choice or necessity, must make do with what
they have, the AMOS routines provide power, if you take the time
to learn to use it.

Just the opinions of a man with nothing to sell,
-Richard

I have no problems compiling programs with icon banks, nor any other

There's something about it in the AMCAF manual. It's one of the Amos's bugs.
Check on the AMCAF doc to find out the solution.

And you are sure that you didnt compile the procedures in it ?
I have got those errors myself, but it was always me doing something 
wrong. Its long since I used Amos Pro last, so I dont remember all of 
what I did :/

Hi everyone!

I´m completly new here, so don´t blame me, if I make some mistakes!
And please excuse my poor english :-(( I come from germany!

So, now I have three questions:

1. Is there any extension which makes it possible to use 256 color pics?

Probably the size of a bank is ODD!! The size of every bank MUST be even, or
the compiler isn't able to compile your program!

Hi there..

I've found another bug (feature?) in the Amos Professional package. It's 
one which the interpreter ignores, but the compiler picks up.. 

I had an IF..ELSE statement along the lines of:

IF <Condition>
	<do some stuff>
ELSE 0
 	<do some other stuff>
END IF

note the zero (0) after the ELSE... I accidentally typed that in and 
didn't notice because the interpreter ran my code without any problems 
(since I didn't run that procedure in my testing). When it came to 
compile time, the program wouldn't compile and it gave me the very 
cryptic error:

	Label not defined at same level of procedure.

It didn't tell me which label it was talking about, nor where in the code 
the error was coming from... nothing...

Luckily I had an older version which had the same procedure in it but 
without the typo and after 10 hours of procedure-by-procedure debugging, 
I found it!

Subject: Easylife and structs and linklists
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Hello all,

The availability of structs and linklists in Blitz Basic has led me to use
that language recently, but I have a long term project of creating a simple
2-player graphical MUD based on a top-down Alien Breed/Valhalla type
viewpoint, and I would certainly prefer to use AMOS classic for this.
However, I would really need to use structs and hopefully an arrays or list
of structs for the monsters and players, and their attributes. Is the
support for structs and linklists in the EasyLife extension on Aminet up to
this? If so then I would guess that it must be the most useful extension
around. However, I would like to ask first before going to the trouble of
downloading and installing it.


Thanks a lot in advance,

Jonathan

Well, I'm slightly biased on this point, but that's the exact purpose
they were written for - I was trying to write that type of game and got
fed up with not having structures so I wrote some. (In fact all the
features easylife has are there for very similar reasons).

You can do linked lists very easily, and have arrays of structures or
arrays as members of structures. Also what you may find really usefull
is if you have one instance of a 'root' structure which contains
pointers to the heads of all your lists you have save the entire
dataspace with a single command and reload it again with another
command. 

All the relocation of pointers to their new memory locations on
reloading is done automatically - as far as I know there is no other
language that does this. The "price" to pay for this is that easylife
does not store your structure elements in the order you write them (But
it does optimise for storage space - .g. Arrays of booleans can
start/end in the middle of bytes).

The other "price" is that accessing a structured varaible is a little
slower than a normal AMOS variable as a function call must be made (This
is because the structures are in an extension and not part of the
language itself).

Thanks for your reply, Paul,

I'll download the extension, as it sounds very useful. I won't be using
Blitz because "Blitz" mode does not seem to offer an easy way of accessing
the serial port, and numerous other problems.

Frontier project problem:

Hello: AmosListers

I need to create a star field that is capable of rotating, so if some one
out their knows Trigonometry I would appreciate a small routine to rotate 
one star. 

lowres screen
centaur x=159 y=99
star at x=170 y=55

all so to any of you extension writers out their I would like an EXT.
that provides rotation and scaling commands for bobs and sprites, and the
ability to use iff like bobs and sprites.
                                          Hoping some one can help me.

Your project sounds interesting! What you mean with "coded version"???

Don't press Return, but the TAB key. The cursor will automatically jump to
the next string gadget. You can choose the TAB cycle with the GadToolBox
when you make your own Gui.

Hello guys.

I'm having a bit of a problem with the AMOSPro GUI Extension V1.5 Beta.

I'm making a vote-poller where you can select different topics from a
ListView, and enter your votes in three different text-gadgets. Now, the
problem is how can I activate the next text-gadget after pressing return in
the previous one, so you don't have to activate it with the mouse?

Like this:
   __________________
1.|__________________| <-Enter your vote, press enter  
   __________________
2.|__________________| <-Then this gadget should be activated automatically.
   __________________
3.|__________________| <-And then this one.


I'd be happy to any response on this one. Thanks.

Hi. Ive downloaded the MAXSDoorHandler extension from John Bintz homepage,
and can't seem to do anything with it. Ive read the docs several times, but
just can't seem to get anything from it. Is there a command line$ syntax
needed, as it is not explained in the docs.

There is no copy command as such, but you can do it like:

Open in 1,"S:Startup-Sequence"
Reserve As Data 6,Lof(1)
Close

Bload "S:Startup-Sequence",Start(6)
Bsave "Ram:File",Start(6) to Start(6)+Length(6)

And thats how to copy simply.

Subject: Another AMOS bug - well, sorta
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

X-Status: 

Here's another AMOS Professional compiler/interpreter bug:

(actually, it's not really a bug, it's more something to be aware of)

If you like to compress a few lines of code into one line using the colon 
separator, be careful when you call a procedure on that line, eg

if you have a procedure called _MY_PROC and you do something like:

_MYPROC : LINE=1 : COLUMN=2 

then that's cool and groovy and will work ok, but AMOS doesn't check 
whether _MYPROC exists as a procedure first, so if you accidentally do 
this:

_MYPROC: LINE=1 : COLUMN=2

AMOS will think you've just defined a label, which you haven't.

The wierd thing is that one could forgive the interpreter for allowing 
this, but the compiler does it as well! Actually, because AMOS is 
semi-compiled, it already keeps a list of procedures during edit mode. It 
even tests that the procedures are syntactically correct. It won't let 
you create a second procedure with the same name, but it doesn't check 
labels to see if they have the same name as a procedure.

Of course, it's not easy to think of everything when you create a 
language for the first time, so I don't really care, I'm just pointing 
out potential disaster areas which can lead to days of frustrating 
debugging if you aren't aware of them.

Stay cool.

Greetings.

Here's my monthly AMOS report. Well, actually, my first one. Anyways, 
here's a batch of questions and replys summed up from this month that 
I can help with:

I believe the Turbo Plus Extension would suit your needs. I just 
purchased a copy from Chris (he still frequents this list I believe), 
and he may be able to help you obtain a copy. The Extension works 
really well. Nice.

you also said..

> the ability to use iff like bobs and sprites..

Well, as alot of you know, (I dunno if you do Eric), I am in the 
process of writing a 3D game engine for the Amiga, coded in AMOS, so 
it won't be an extension, however, later on I may code some of my 
routines into an extension. Never know..

To Mr. Andrew Kellett, or "Mushy":
(or anyone else interested)

My homepage is still coming up. I haven't been around to finishing 
the information pages yet as because of the Holidays, but as soon as 
they're over, I can assure you my site will be finished. Even right 
now, it looks COOL! (Or so I think, check it out.) The link to my 
site is (which is also repeated at the end of this message):

*use this link if you have Netscape 2.0+ or IE 2.0+*

http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/6116/
*use this link with any ol' browser*

Again, be sure to stop by my site and e-mail me on it's looks and 
comments on what to do to make it better. I'll be adding a guest book 
later on. Seasons greetings!

Hello!


I wonder if it is possibel to use 'date' in amosprograms, eg to get the date
from the computer to the program..? 


And also, how can you copy files with an amosprogram, is there some way to make
a program copy for example DH0:s/Startup-Sequence to RAM: automatically?

Hi all,
 
My name is Bjørn Pedersen and I'm new to this list.
 
I just have one question. My AmosPro compiler has completely failed
on me. And the disk just reads NDOS, so I can't reinstall it either.
I've called around to the Amiga sellers in Norway but no one sells
it anymore. Does anyone know of *any* company that still stocks it?
 
I really, really need one fast!

Thanks in advance.

Take care,
Bjørn

A while ago I requested encrypted files along with the original 
uncrypted version.

There seemed to be some confusion.
I dont care what they are encrypted with as long as they are two 
seperate text files, one encrypted version of the other.

Also.
Why does Amos not like my accelerator.  Is it the 68030 it doesnt 
like?  Its an A1230 running at 40MHz with 8Meg of ram.

U can use any system commands using exec "command" i.e. Exec "c/date"
to file like Exec "c/date > Ram:data" and now read this file (ram:data) from amos

> And also, how can you copy files with an amosprogram, is there some way to make

U can also run copy command like
Exec "copy S:Startup-Sequence to RAM:" or run procedure described in
Mashroom`s email :)

U can use also subroutine like this below do get date from Amos
Procedure _Get_Date
T$=space$(12)
Dreg(1)=Varptr(T$) : R=Doscall(-192) : NJ=Leek(Varptr(T$)) : A=1978 DAY=7
Do
BIS=0: If (A and 3)=0 : BIS=1:End If : Exit If NJ-365-BIS<0
Add DAY,1+BIS : If DAY>7:Add DAY,-7:End If
Inc A
Loop
M=1
Restore DAYS
Do 
Read N
Exit if NJ-N<0 : Add NJ,-N :Inc M
Loop
Inc NJ
DJ$=Mid$(str$(NJ),2) : If Len (DJ$<2 : DJ$="0"+DJ$ : End If
MN$=Mid$(str$(M),2) : If Len (MN$<2 : MN$="0"+MN$ : End If
YE$=Mid$(Str$(A),2)
DAT$=DJ$ + "." + MN$ + "." +  YE$
REM DAT$ is of coz text variable storing date in form DD.MM.YY 
DAYS:
Data 31,28+BIS,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31
End Proc

Hi 

The other day I looked at equ.s in extensions dir on tutorial disk and
saw offsets to diferent functions in AMOS lib. There it stands that the
screen can hav max 6 planes at present. Now I thought that some of you
that are assembler gurus could patch this library smoe way.Try to do it
and then write to the list wether you succed ot not.

My second question to assembler people is following. I hav PhxAss 4.xx
and Itryed to use it to compile amos includes. Then it said that it
doesn't recognise __RS that stands at one line in source. I wonder if
any one knows waht this is and what compiler should I use to get this
compiled?

Please answer this queston as fast as possible because I can access
internet and e-mail for three more days.

Thanks in advace Goran

Thanks, but I'm aware of this. Sadly, not so many others are, they are used to
press return and will complain about it.

You can do it using the TAB key instead of return.....

Hmmm, you shouldn't have any problems. I have both an A3000 '030 25 
and an A2000 '040 25 and both AMOS Pro and the Compiler runs very 
well on both of them with no problems. Odd..

Thanks to you all for all them nice answers to my questions... 
About getting date:

I manage to get it to Ram using

Exec "DH0:C/date > Ram:data" like Jacek said 

But when I try to get the file into the program with open in I get that
annoying error 'End of file'

So I'd love to see an example how to input
a file like this: Wednesday 18-Dec-96 20:10:52

Fellow sentient beings,

Has anyone out there implemented a cool long scrolltext in AMOS Pro? If 
so, how? I managed to do it with two screens, each of which is 1020 
pixels wide and I flip between them when my Amal loop pushes one over far 
enough, but I've had problems with measuring proportional fonts so that 
exactly the right amount of text is printed at exactly the right 
location on the screens... anyway, any suggestions?

AMCAF extension supports e set of commands for the date!

Again, AMCAF extension has a Copy File command (I cannot remember its name
now) and it's very easy to use and needs very few mem.

So, if you need date and file copy and also a lot of new power, get the demo
of AMCAF from Aminet (dev/amos).

I have a proportional version of this if anyone is interested, it uses a
spare screen & copy to free up the sprite/icon banks though.

Hi Eric!
I am writing a strategie-space-game, too! No 3D-GFX, only 2D (Rendered!).
It is very complex: 600 different planets in 100 sol-systems, up to 40 players via BBS or
Internet, more than 10000 different star-ships and so on....

So if you need any help, mail me!

For example: Exec "C:Copy Dh0:s/startup-sequence Ram:"
or you can load the file to copy into a amos-bank and save this bank as a file in Ram!

'elp!

Well fellow AmOS coders here be a little problem for you all.

Dual Playfields.

Here is how I set the palette correctly in lowres.....

----- CODE -----

Screen Open 0,320,256,8,Lowres
Palette 0,$2,$4,$6,$8,$A,$C,$E,0,$200,$400,$600,$800,$A00,$C00,$E00

Screen Open 1,320,256,8,Lowres
Palette 0,$200,$400,$600,$800,$A00,$C00,$E00,0,$2,$4,$6,$8,$A,$C,$E

'*** So screen one has a blue spread while screen 1 has a red spread ***
'*** Then I declare the dualplayfield settings ***

Dual Playfield 0,1
Dual Priority 1,0

------ END CODE -----

But that code wont work with hires screens (even reducing the colours etc)
one screen will allways have the wrong palette.

Anybody know how to do it in hires modes?

I use the date command in my programs. Set input 10,-1 and then APPEND and
close the file immediately. You will find it will read in no problems.

  Sorry for being away for so long but I became ill (chest infection, must
  of caught a virus ;)

  Regarding the aga picture loaders... I will try and get them up on my
  ALMOST working web-page, the problem with the procedures at the moment is
  that it requires the piccys being converted to CMAP (the colourmap) and
  the RAW image data.  If you wait till I get back over christmas I should
  have implemented an AGA IFF loader.  On my web page at  the moment is a
  program that uses Copper OFF/ON and creates it`s own copperlist, have a
  look at this and get hold of a Hardware Reference Manual (veeeeery
  useful!) and it should slowly become apparent how this works..... Even
  better (and this is the way I learned!) is to get hold of old copies of
  Grapevine by LSD.  These are a series of what were the BEST of Amiga
  magazines and contain some VERY useful tutorials on programming and
  especielly(sp?) the copperlist, HUNT THESE DOWN!

  Has anybody got an answer to my question about my corrupt looking screens
  in my custom copperlist (these only appeared when I got my
  accelerator)... The wierd thing is, my assembler progs that use the same
  copperlist, don`t f**k up, maybe it`s the Copper OFF command, nah, that
  would be a bug, and we know AMOS has none of those ;)

  My web address is.... (It might not work yet, sorry, it`s probably my
  fault)...

Subject: Re:Long scrolltexts
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain
Status: RO

  The way you are making your scroller may be a bit memory hungry... So
  here`s another way (just a basic outline anyway):

  Grab an IFF font as BOBS (or icons :) in ASCII order, so the characters
  will be grabbed in order they appear in ASCII, starting from the SPACE (I
  hope thats clear, if not, it should become clear l8r ;)

  Now setup a screen about 360 pixels wide by whatever the hieght of your
  IFF font (say about 16 pixels) and whatever amount of colours your IFF
  font is in (and remeber the grab the bob OR icon colours.... and turn
  FLASH OFF !)
  Also you have to DEFINE a SCROLL area.  This is the command Def Scroll
  ID,Screen,X1,Y1,X2,Y2,HorizSpeed,VertSpeed (I THINK this is the
  syntax!)... so for your scroll screen it would be.. Def Scroll
  1,0,0,0,360,16,-1,0
  Now the horiz and vert speed and the speed at which it scrolls in a
  certain direction, -1 is one pixel, -2 would be 2 and so on.

  Now the main loop, this consists of reading a string character by
  character and pasting down the equaivilent BOB at the blank bit of screen
  at the right of the screen you set up, by converting the ASCII value of
  the character from the string and minus 32 (or 31?, whatever). So if the
  character is a space (ascii value = 32) then minus 31 so you have a
  variable containing the value 1. In the BOB bank, this will be a blank
  bob, so a SPACE!
  Now, paste the BOB at the right hand side of your screen
  Now, loop for the width of your font (now, to start off with this can be
  a set value of say, 16 pixels OR you can setup an array of proportinal
  widths but I can`t be arsed explaning that yet, sorry) using the SCROLL
  id command (this would be Scroll 1) and waiting for a VBL. Thats it!

  Here it is again in list format...
  1. Setup Bobs/Icons
  2. Setup Screen to scroll
  3. Setup scroll string ie.  SCR$="THIS IS SOME TEST TEXT TO SCROLL" : Rem
  please note it is in Uppercase!
  4. Main Loop:
            COUNT= 1
            Do
            CHAR$=Mid$(SCR$,COUNT,1) : Rem This will get the CHAR to place
            CHARNUM=Asc(CHAR$)-31 :Rem Or is it 32?
            Paste Bob 320,0,CHARNUM
            For Lop = 1 To 16
                 Scroll 1
                 Wait Vbl
            Next
            Inc COUNT
            Loop


  Now I have just written of this off the top of my head so it may be a
  little wrong, but anybody reading should get the idea (I hope!)... The
  one vital thing this program doestn`t do is wrap, to do this just have a
  character that means it is time to wrap
  SCR$="THIS IS SOME TEST TEXT TO SCROLL   x".  In this example it is a
  lowercase `x`.  Have an IF check to see wether CHAR$ = `x` and if it is,
  set COUNT to 0 (but make sure it comes before the Inc COUNT line !)...

  I`ll try and post an example scroller WITH proportional fonts instead of
  IFF fonts (just use the Font Width command on CHAR$ and use that as the
  Scroll loop amount!)...

  If you have any problems with this (as I did writing it!) just mail back
  with any probs... There should be some example scroller progs that come
  with AMOSPro if I remeber correctly.

  Melee,
  Just a poor, hungry student!

I'm sorry, but this isn't possible! In this case the code must be rewritten..
a simple hack is insufficient :( In the future i'll try to implement a kind
of screen promoter in my Gui Extension, that promote Amos screen to Intuition
:)

__RS is a DevPac reserved symbol having the current value of the RS counter. I
don't know the PhxAss equivalent.... read the doc :)

These sources was written using DevPac...

Hello: Adam Parrot & AmosListers

Adam what Turbo Plus command Where you thinking of, and what type of game
are you working on ?

As for That possible EXT. I defiantly can use it, and theirs is probably a 
lot of other people that need a EXT. that allows IFFs to be used as Bobs &
sprites and allows Bobs & Sprites & IFFs to be rotated, and scaled, so
pleassssssssssssss wright it.
                                          Happy Holidays AmosListers

Hi all,


First, thanks everyone for your help in my compiler troubles.

If I may trouble you again...? I just wonder if anyone has come up
with a method of lifting collission detection using Point() up in
Amal.

I'm working on a game where the main guy shouldn't be running
through walls and such. He's not a ghost after all :). I'd just like
to avoid overloading my program with zillions of Bobs and avoid
using Spritebob Col etc.

My present use of Point(x,y) for this is quite inefficient since it
relies on eight points around the guy, and I use a byte-sized
variable which I check, and I got to check the guy every time he
moves. All this calculation in Amos proper slows down the game
unacceptably much.

Take care now, and merry Christmas,
Bjørn

Thanks for the info on doing long scrolltexts using bobs, Lee!

I would quote your message here, but one of the other people here accidentally deleted it off the server after 
reading it... but not before printing it out!

You mentioned that the scrolltext should be in uppercase. Presumably, if I use all 64 available bobs, I should 
be able to do lower case and punctuation marks too?

Also, I'm doing lots of other stuff in the background too, like watching the serial port, so would Amal provide 
a smoother and more worry free solution than a FOR loop? I could loop the bob back to the start of screen 
automatically and maybe stick character images in there whenever I need to do so... sorta like a continuously 
running bob "pipeline" - that would reduce the number of active bobs being used because there would always be 
one being "flipped" back to the start of the screen and cleared.

It's more complicated, but the freak out value is perhaps high? >:^)

Yes, you are quite right, my method screen-flipping for scrolltexts is very memory hungry, and it still makes 
for  a limited-length scroller :-( 
 
Thanks man,

Another little quest about date:

I get it all nicely from Ram to my amosprograms now but is there some way to
get only the date (eg no time)? 
I donnotknow but I guess it's possible to copy the date to ram without the time
in it, but I don't know AmigaDos good enough... 

Or can I with Amos 'extract' only the date from a string like this: Wednesday
18-Dec-96 20:10:52

No it's not! The whole music extension is buggy allover and is the main

Well, sure it's free, but it's unusable. I haven't got it in my extension
list anymore. I want stable and accurately working programs.

The music extension has much lesser effect commands than the protracker
supports. Sure, if you convert old soundtracker modules, you won't have
many problems. (if you don't mind the module playing not at exactly the
same speed).

The Music Extension Tracker commands are also very limited (no sfx, only pt
effects, song-repeat bug).

I don't mind ;)

When loading files to AmosProeditor there are

Is it possible to change that?
I would prefer to see ALL files in a directory.

I'm also working on a space war game (see my web page - amiga section),
using rendered gfx. It will be both 2d (for the battle sections) as well
as 3D (full rendered 3D ships like the Enterprise, Blakes 7, Klingons etc)
for the warp sections.
I'm hopeing to get it to work via bbs/internet so you can play head to
head or possibly even multi player login (similar to netrek) so people can
play worldwide.
The basic idea is to have a star chart. To explore different sections of
the galaxy you warp to them. This is the 3D section, with you needing to
control the ship thru the warp lines. If you stray, your ship takes
damage. When you eventually get to a new sector, you can combat the other
players in the 2D section.
A great example of this is Warstar (also available from my web site).

Perhaps you'd like to join forces?

Hi everyone,

Its been a while since I posted a note about my games progress.  The game I'm talking about is called Demistar, and as of Thursday I finally started burning test CD's.  The good news is that the animation playback rate off my 2x speed CDrom is a consistent 15fps for a 376x160pixel image.  I'm still trying to add sync sound to the animation, but it shouldn't affect the playback rate that much.  As a side note, one of the cutscenes in the game features a huge hangerbay created in Lightwave.  There are over 800 raytraced lights in the shot.  It takes about 15minutes per frame on a 500mhz Dec Alpha to render...

Unfortunately the bad news is that for some reason, the keyboard handler will not read more than one key at a time on my A1200.

This is an example:

DO
HOME:PRINT KEY STATE(79), KEY STATE(80)
LOOP

Pressing the '>' and/or '?' key will change the display from 0 to -1.

If I run this code on my A4000, I can press either key or both at the same time, and the computer will see the key presses.  However, if I try this on my A1200, only one key can be read at a time.  I haven't tried this on the A3000 I have acess to yet.

If anyone knows what the answer is please let me know.  I need to be able to check for certain keys to be pressed at any time during the main game loop.  I'm using this to control the playership with the keyboard ala asteroids (rotate left, rotate right, thrust, and fire)  

Thanks,

It could be because of the somewhat buggy hardware in the A1200. It has
severe problems with multiple keypresses at times.

Adam, I would very much appreciate a look at your example. Mainly, I'm 
having problems doing this sort of stuff on A600's. I've got about 5 
screens in my code... two of them are 16 colour screens with one flashing 
colour (using the FLASH command.)

All of the screens are supposed to smooth scroll vertically into position 
 using the "screen display" command and a FOR loop to increment 
or decrement the Y co-ordinate (something like the PUSH NORTH command in 
SCALA MM300). Down the bottom of the screen I've got a user-defined 
horizontal scroller which I'm curently doing with two long screens and 
some AMAL code.

At the same time, though, I'm continuously receiving 2400bps command 
strings on the serial port and checking the keyboard in a polling loop.

Everything seems to work ok on a A1200, but it does sometimes skip serial 
chars. On an A600, it is just waaaaay to slow. It seems to fix itself if 
I make my screens 8 colours and turn off the really long scrolltexts.

Would using BOBS be any faster than using a single screen, especially 
considering that I've got to perform maybe 20 small copy/erase/paste 
operations instead of just one big one if I do it using a screen?

Anyway, this is all just talk.. I'll find out when I try it! :-) Post us 
your example code, man!

Thanx cobber,

Sorry to tell you this but I don`t think anything will make the A1200 
keyboard work like any other. As far as I know something about the A1200 
is different (cheaper?) than the others so unfortunately only one (or 
maybe two) keys can be registered to be pressed at any time. I`m sure 
somebody will correct me if I`m wrong on this though!

Well, you are wrong :-)

In the 1200, you cannot press some keys together. You get faults. The only way to see what keys work together is... test.

Make a prog that test all the keys and show their state on the screen and begun to kick teh keyboard!

I don't know how hard such a project would be, but that 16colour limit is a
huge drawback in Amos. 


>hacking/pirating

Well....with Amos.....it's really not that easy since noone seems to develop it
anymore or try to promote it...

Hello Amos Users:


Here is a couple of questions:


1: I have been playing with the idea of coding a Alien breed like game
   with the view from the top, and i think i can manage it exept for
   the rutine that limits the guy you're moving for going outside the
   corridors.
   I found this code in a Amiga magazine:

Hide On
Screen Open 0,320,256,4,Lowres

End If
If Joy(1)=8 Then GJORE=2
If Joy(1)=4 Then GJORE=3
If Joy(1)=1 and SOLID=1 Then GJORE=4

If GJORE=2 Then Add XFIG,2
If GJORE=3 Then Add XFIG,-2
If GJORE=4 Then Gosub HOPPER
Return

If GJORE=5

End If
Return

End If
Next Y

And it does exactly what i want, exept for it not working well Vertically.
It limit's the bob from going past a specific colour, so when the bob hits
that colour it stops.

So i am vondering if anybody will be so nice and fix this code so it works
vertically as well as horisontally or code a whole new rutine on the same
prinsip as this one.

There would be nice if you also can make it so the bob stops on 2 colours
instead of 1 so i can have more than 1 colour it stops on.
There must also be a number i can change fot the colour i want it to stop
on.
Example i want the bob to stop when it hits colour 3 then i set up the
number 3 somewhere and it stops when it hits colour 3.

Also what do you think i should use: Hires 16 colours, Lowres 16,32,64??
I was thinking of having each level 1000x1000 and scroll it.

Credits for the work will ofcoz be given to the fella that helps me.


2: Ok, so hacking the Amos.Library are out of question, but you Extension
   coders, PLEEZ make a extension for Hires 32 colours, it should not be a
   problem becoz Amcaf can view 256 colours so it should be possible to
   have a 32 colour screen in Hires.


Oki, ya guy's have a really Merry X-Mas!

Greetings.

Here's some answers to some questions I've been posed with recently.

Let me first of all clear up some confusion about my 3D engine. The 
engine is a 3D, texture mapping, game engine being constructed in 
Amos Pro. It IS NOT an extension and I do not forsee it being an 
extension, however, in the future I may implement some of the 
rotation and scaling routines into an extension or accessory.

The name of the engine is the Cafe engine, and I will use it in my 
first upcoming 3D action game, "Eventuator 3D". For a detailed story 
line, visit my website and navigate to the Products page.

Secondly, about this scrolling text issue, I thought it might be 
helpful to mention the Turbo Plus Extension, as I have in the past. I 
just purchased a copy from Chris (Evans) about a month ago and I find 
it useful. The most recent version (which I purchased) came with an 
IFF font editor for use in Amos which allows you to make your own 
font files from scratch or grab them from IFFs. Use it in 
conjunction with a scroll routine and you have scrolling text.

Also, Eric Hyland asked me which Turbo Plus command I was referring 
to when I mentioned it's starfield capability. Putting it mildly, 
Turbo Plus in itself offers a range of starfield commands which allow 
you to create horizontal or vertical starfields as well as snow. For 
more info on Turbo Plus, contact Chris at:

chrisevans@cubic.xg.com

Happy New Year to all.

'elp!

Well fellow AmOS coders here be a little problem for you all.

Dual Playfields.

Here is how I set the palette correctly in lowres.....

----- CODE -----

Screen Open 0,320,256,8,Lowres
Palette 0,$2,$4,$6,$8,$A,$C,$E,0,$200,$400,$600,$800,$A00,$C00,$E00

Screen Open 1,320,256,8,Lowres
Palette 0,$200,$400,$600,$800,$A00,$C00,$E00,0,$2,$4,$6,$8,$A,$C,$E

'*** So screen one has a blue spread while screen 1 has a red spread ***
'*** Then I declare the dualplayfield settings ***

Dual Playfield 0,1
Dual Priority 1,0

------ END CODE -----

But that code wont work with hires screens (even reducing the colours etc)
one screen will allways have the wrong palette.

Anybody know how to do it in hires modes?

HELP! All I want to know is in AmosPro how to set a dualplayfield up with
the correct colours.

Thanks in advance!

I forgot something when i posted the message with the sourse that limited
the bob that i wanted help on.

I dont need all that is in that source becos there the bob falls until it
hits the colour, but what i need is a simple rutine that allows me to move
the bob all 4 directions, but when the bob collide with a sertan colour it
stops.
I also must be able to change that nuber for witch colour the bob shall
stop on.

Does anyone know if it is possible to use amos

Hello, you all!
I'm having a little trouble using Amos since I use Workbench 3.1 in my
Amiga 1200 (the image gets so distorted and noisy you can´t see anything
but recognize the familiar Amos colors). That only happens when I boot
from Workbench, not when I boot from Amos, and it stops when I press
Amiga-A several times.
Somebody knows what happens or have the same problem?
I have the Amos 1.34 (Maybe I don't have the latest version... or I do?)

Thanks for ya help!

Hello!ù

 > Is it possible to use tooltypes with amosprogs?

You can use AMCAF extension: it has a commmand:
_TOOLTYPE$=Tool Type$(FILE$)

where FILE$ is the file you want.

A demo version of AMCAF is available on Aminet and it has a lot of other
useful commands, but it's just for AmosPro.

Bye

Yes. There's a program out to read tool types from an icon. Or, if you use the
CLI to run it, you can pass a variable in and read it with the Command Line$.
