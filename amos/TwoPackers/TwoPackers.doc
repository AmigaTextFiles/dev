2.	Introduction

A while back, I learned how to do a simple bit compression scheme in Amos.
It  had the worst compression ratio ever, but it was my first break into
compression stuff on computers.

Next, I looked at how SquashABob worked.  It wasn't too hard so I wrote my
own. Then, I made it so it stored the palette along with the file.  This was
all in  Amos the Creator.  Once I got AmosPro, I made it an Accessory, then
made it  store the number of colors automatically.

Then, when I needed to compress stuff for my up and comping platform game, I
tried again to write a compression routine.  I wanted to use XPK, but
Easylife  thrashed memory when XPK was used, so I dropped that.  Then, I
tried to write  a simple offset compression routine, but it was too hard, so
I dropped that.

Then I turned back to XPK.  I decided to directly access the
xpkmaster.library  using Lib Call.  Two weeks later, I had a fully
functioning set of XPK  routines for use.  Yay!

3.	Using BobSquasher

BobSquash is easy.  If you use it as an Accessory, make sure some bobs are
in  Bank 1.  It will Squash them and place them into Bank 12 (or above,
whenever a  free bank is found).  The bank is a Data bank, so it'll stay
after every save.  If you run it as a regular program, a file requester for
a bob bank will come  up, and then a requester to save the Squashed Bob
bank.  Its a very simple and  effective compression scheme.

To use the compressed pictures, open up BobSquash and find the procedure
ROYAL_UNPACK.  This lets you decompress the bobs directly into the sprite
bank.

4.	Using XPKPack

XPKPack works as either an Accessory or a stand-alone program.  It uses
xpkmaster.library and the compression sub-libraries, found on Aminet at
util/ pack/xpk25dev.lha.  Install this first.  Then, if you don't have it,
get  Easylife 1.10 and install that.

When you start up the program, a screen appears.  Along the middle are four
buttons, labeled something like "Compressors","Mode Setting","Files","Info".
These access different displays (like MUI click-tabs):

  Compressors lets you choose a compressor to use
  Mode Setting lets you choose a mode from 0-99 to use
  Files lets you choose a new file to use, and starts the compressing
  Info gives a description of the compression routine plus some
       other tidbits...
       
  Click the button above these to quit.

5.	Information

XPK is not difficult to program.  Just a tad tricky.  By the way, XPK_Inbuf
doesn't work too well (sorry, Urban!).  The best compressors I've found are
BLZW and NUKE.  Remember to have the user get the XPK25DEV.LHA from Aminet
so  they can access your XPKed files.
