Umm I have my pointer changing...

I think I edited Mouse.abk to change the clock and busy pointer images.

I have "wait" under my pointer image when it's busy, and just use
the normal AMOS instructions for chaging the pointer.

Does this help?

Regards, Neil.

Hi Janet, I'll sell you an original AMOS 3D coverdisk for $3.00, if that would
help.  Adam just bought the second last one, and there's one left.

That only works for the AMOS creator and such.  APro doesn't
have that anymore (pity).

OK so far.

This is OK, as long as it's less than about 50k at the most, you send
it only once and it's something to do with AMOS (ie some source code).
Some of us have dial-up accounts you know, and we don't want to spend all
day downloading our email only to find a piece of software that just
happens to be programmed in the same language that we use.

I'm sure that these people will be dashing for your program after you've
sent them some massive emails.

So what's wrong with MPEG?

Okay there is a way, by accessing the CIA's registers directly:

$bfe101 are the 8 bits for the data
$bfe301 control the input/output of the data pins (1=3Doutput, 0=3Dinput)=


$bfd000 the first 3 bits control the select, busy, and paper out lines
$bfd200 contols the input/output of these pins

This is not good programming but it works, but note this doesn't stop the=
 system from using the port!

Yepp, i could use diffrent screens, but that isent exactly as i wanted it,
becoz then the text disapear on a straight line when it hit's the other
screen and what i wanted is that it only disapear when it's under the
other 14 colours so lets say there is a O in the logo then the text would
appear in the middle of the O where it is black.

So the text is only nor showed when it is under the colours ofthe logo.

Hope you understand bether what i am looking for now!

I spent lots of time looking for an editor that would work under anything=

than WB1.3.  The coverdisk version that Chris sells is able to run under =

the 3D commands will work in APro under WB3.  You could always write your=

editor that would work under WB3.

I've often thought about that myself.  I'd love an editor that worked mor=

lightwave modeler, with all three views at once and such.

You know, that keeps popping up here. I would also really be interested 
in working on such a project, or getting info on such a project.

Anyone else interested? Or is there work being done on this? (the Navigator
demo on Aminet comes to mind)

The Amiga brought awesome 2D and cool 3D to us, I think the future is 
awesome 3D. If we can make 3D as easy as 2D is, the Amiga will dominate.

Thx Joe, that question seems to pop up all the time lately.  Just to update
everyone, Adam bought the second last AMOS 3D from me, and I have one left, for
$3.00 including postage and docs.

Use a negative seed in the Randomise command, and you`ll
get identical Rnd sequences every time.

Yet another AMOS design feature :-)

I would work on a Navigator clone, but I dont use the Amiga for 
Internet purposes, I use a PC. Sorry on that one.

I guess Xenotech didnt hear, but I'm working on a 3D engine similar 
to Build and Quake. I have the rotations done, and the engine itself 
is about 25% done. It is definitely coming along.

Long live the Amiga.

Why invent the wheel second time? Everybody uses lightwave or some other
raytracing package for object designing, why should amos users stick to
something worse... Lightwave/Imagine -> amos3d should not be that hard.
I have written a lightwave/imagine/3ds -> McExtension format
converter ;)

Not a chance, with current Amiga models :(
Proper chunky display modes and PPC, now that would be something :)

Amos 3D is really quite quick on 68020+ machines.  The thing that bugs =
me is
the editor, and the 20 object limitation :-(

You need to buy a 1Meg Agnus from Software Hut or some other company that=

I'd be interested in it, that's for sure.  I'll have to look into the com=

You've obviously NEVER seen AMOS 3D.  It has as much in commen with light=
wave as it does with a rabid sheep.

If they were in any way similar formats.  They are not.  Amos uses a few =
very basic filled polygons as its entire library of shapes.  Lightwave ha=
s cones, cylinders, etc. that are impossible in Amos 3D.  The incompatabi=
lity is insurmountable.

Hi,
Does anybody know how to use a seed to generate a random sequence but the 
same one for same seed values? (I hope that makes sense) The manual says 
use Randomise SEED and then random sequences made with this seed will be 
the same each time. As far as I can see this make no difference and it is 
impossible to make Amos (Pro V2.0) make the same sequence twice!!!

Hope someone can help me....

Happy amosing,

I asked this question a while ago - you have to do =Rnd(-(number)) to get
the same sequence each time.

Wierd eh?

I have an A1200 with 10 Megs Ram. I like running other things in the 
background and dont neet all the 'junk'' lightwave has. Lightwave is 
good, butthe same people that make that statement also say 'Dont use AMOS,
program in a REAL language like C '. That is completely missing the point.

AMOS is an excellent multimedia/programming tool, it is easy, powerful 
but qwerky. From my experience (Fortran, Borland C+, Basic, Assembly) it 
is no more qwerky than others, especially when you realize how AMOS works 
with screens. err, IMHO.

> You've obviously NEVER seen AMOS 3D.

ditto.

> > Lightwave/Imagine -> amos3d should not be that hard.

I dunno...

> >I have written a lightwave/imagine/3ds -> McExtension format

I must have missed that one, maybe because I dont use lightwave (anymore).


 Yes, what I think we need as something like AMOS 3D. I must say after a 
long while I finally got it installed correctly just last month and 
havent used the commands. I have seen all the demos though and it is 
good, not too slow on my machine.

 First, should we stick with the same conventions and commands that 3D 
uses? Or should something entirely new be made?

 Can the original program be cleaned up to work with new chipsets?

 If we design something new (best idea I think), what MUST be included?
	-Basic shapes  cube, sphere, pyramid, 3D fonts (objects)
	-Stretching
	-Collision Detection
	-?

 Anymore Ideas?

I am new to this mailing list, but not to AMOS.

I have used AMOS for about 3 years, and have not made any MAJOR game
releases.

I have made some games though (used to be on Amiga Devil BBS, until the
guy's hard drive blew up). The only one I did decide to upload was a game
called Kill Em'. It is a simple game with OKAY halfbrite bobs. In it you
have to kill small innocent people has they run out of a building.

I am interested in AMOS sources, mainly so I can figure out the language
better.

I have had a good Amiga for about 4-5 years, a crappy Amiga for 6 years,
and a really crappy Commodore 64 for... I don't know.

I am extremely unaware of what's happened with AMOS the past years. And
the mail-lists on Aminet are a bit hard to read.

I am currently working on a new game, unnamed so far, which is sorta based
on a game called SuperBallz which was recently uploaded to Aminet.

Well, that's pretty much all I have to say for now, -later

P.S. That Soma thing was added by my brother, and I didn't feel like
getting rid of it (just for the curious).

AMOS Pro is out of publication, and Europress/Francois L. will not sell the
rights to anyone.  An A-Pro coverdisk came out about a year ago but was a
crippled version.  F1 Licenceware in the UK sells some AMOS stuff like the Pro
Compiler for about 15 UKP.  If you need e-addresses I can look them up.

Greetings everyone!

First things first:  I owe everyone on the list a MASSIVE apology.
I sent two e-mails 400KB in size to the list last Wednesday and Thursday.
I'm really sorry for causing so much trouble, but I do have a half-baked 
explanation:

I visit my Mum's workplace (Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, Cheshire, 
England) in school holidays.  Only then do I get to send mail myself, and
I decided (stupidly) last Wednesday to send the LhA file.  I then realised
that an earlier mail message I'd sent to the list was bouncing (on a mail
gateway machine in the same room), due to me not changing the address of 
the list.  On Thursday, I had not recieved a copy of the message, and
assumed
that a similar thing was happening.  I re-sent the message (ARRRRGH! -
Stupid
Me!)

Now - other things:
1.      Pleeease (even though it has caused you so much trouble) send me
your 
        comments about SA+
2.      As an apology, AMOS-List users can recieve the full version at the 
        price of:       o3.99 UK Sterling
                        $7    US Dollars        DOLLAR BILLS ONLY
                        1000  Spanish Pesetas   1000 PESETA NOTES ONLY
                        Or a similar amount of a LARGELY-USED CURRENCY
        I can send it to you as an attachment (If you want to go through
        the waiting) and you can deduct:
                        49p   UK Sterling
                        $1    US Dollars
                        (Sorry, no allowances for pesetas - I can only
accept
                        notes, and the smallest peseta note is 1000!)
3.      Have you read the review in AF December issue yet?  Do you agree?
4.      AMOSPro - resource query - thanks for help, but I mean buttons that
        I have created myself using the UserInstructions copied from the
        Resource Editor itself (If anyone knows what I mean!)  The text in 
        those is becoming corrupted!
5.      I'd better go - you'll be whinging about the size of this e-mail
        (Only joking!)

I've seen it (the amos 3d editor), but it was so ugly I could not use
it for anything serious. I.e I could not view the object from several
angles like in most (if not all) raytracing modelers + the interface was
really bad. I guess the amos 3d extension is pretty good though.

Still they can't be that different. Aren't the polygons stored as vertices
and 1-sided faces in amos3d? If they are, the converter could be done
right?

Are you working on a *real* Quake engine, with polygon filling or just
on raycasting "wolf" engine? Does your engine texture map?

I didn't say so. And if you don't want to use the "junk" just
use another 3d package. A converted for most common raytracers are
publicly available. Or can you really use Amos3d editor?

Huh? Amos screens suck. The bitplanes aren't even interleaved, which

I use no seed at all if I want the same sequence of numbers each time the=

Good idea.  I would love to see an object editor as an accessory.  I'll s=

If I can get the info on the code (I think it's in the manual, gotta look=

Hence the desire to write a new object modeler.  Xenotech suggests making=

No, they are stored as objects, with point positions based on the default=
 object shapes.  I've recently come across some info that gives me the id=
ea that this is just the Voodoo Morons, though.  They have included two m=
ore basic shapes in the coverdisk.  Perhaps we can design our own default=
 shapes with just a few more points?

Well, its not polygon filled, as similar to Build, however it is a 
cross between texture-mapping and raycasting. Moreso texture mapping 
I would say. Tell you the truth, I've never read much on Quake, and I 
dont know much about the engine it uses, of course I dont have the 
game either, so if you want to fill me in on it, I would be glad to 
hear any high points it may have that I could incorporate into my 
engine. Thanks anyways.

Erm, I believe that it is an actual Amos newsgroup thing.  Set up

set up he mailed me and said it wasnt doing very well!

Well, quake uses method called Binary Space Partition Trees (BSP).
It's a method for sorting big amount of polygons. You can find
more info about BSP from BSP.faq (search using Altavista).

I have Pro manual and 3d manual, I will start looking too...

If anyone else has messed with this jump in, plz...

The 3D editor is a little wierd, I think he tried to pack alot of stuff into
a small screen.

Sounds like we need to examine the current object structure as you are 
looking into, then we can work on requirements for the accessory. I 
suggest we start with something simple. Like read in an object, and 
display it, allowing limited control over it. Then perhaps we can add 
things to it one by one. There already is something that shows the 
contents of an object that came with 3D, but it only shows file info for 
an object...

I will research this also.

There is a routine to load in IFF Animations complete into RAM and then playing 
from there, but I want to know if I can play for example a 20 MB Animation 
direct from Hard Disk. I don't think it's descriped in the Amos Pro Manual. Am I 
wrong?

I've got no knowledge of assembler and so I can't do this. Can anybody write me 
such a routine or help me in writing one???

I have easylife but structures escape me.  Tell me more.

Td Advanced n will let us look directly into the object in memory.  I've =
started working on a GUI for it that does the proper 3 way display of an =
object.  I'm basing it on the look of the lightwave modeler.  I'm thinkin=

 more room for object manipulation controls.

I have not seen Amos 3D, but, LightWave has not cones, cilinders and so o=
n. LightWave only has flat poligons. Modeler HAS such primitives, but the=
y are not. When you create a Cone, Modeler split it into flat polygons. S=
o, LW render such polygons.

But Real3D HAS this primitives. Objects (and primitives) are defined as m=
athematical expresions. A cone, always will be a cone, not a set of polyg=
ons with the shape of a cone. This is the reason because it is so hard to=
 find a coneverter between such programs. I thing that lasts Reals are ab=
le to use such polygons or so.

Imagine works like LW, but all the polygons in Imagine are triangles, pol=
ygons with 3 points.

more basic shapes in the coverdisk.  Perhaps we can design our own defaul=
t shapes with just a few more points?

I have a doc explaining LW Objects files and they are like the one used i=
n Aegis Videoscape 3D (both programs are from the same author).

First, there is a list of all the points of the object. When all point ar=
e defined, following is a list of polygons, the number of the points defi=
ning them. And of course, more datas as surface and so on...

I think that if Amos3D is based on polygons, it should be very easy to ma=
ke a converter...

BTW, where can I get J-Windows? Can some one send it to me?

Ho hum, I don`t know if it`s my version of Amos (Pro V2.0) or my computer 
(Amiga 4000 / 030 18meg) but doing the above has never worked for me and 
the other suggestion of Randomize (-SEED) didn`t work either. If possible 
could somebody send word for word an example they know works?
I can`t say for certain that it isn`t my machine. Amos seems to not like it
- the fast free display is all red even though about 15 meg are free!
- FEW extensions work,Craft locked amos after a few minutes but not on my 
A500

I hope you`re not sick of this ...

Thanks for all who tried to help,

I have a guy trying to run WebView, an Amos program I wrote, on a A1200

in DoublePAL Interlaced (whatever that is...I'm an ECS guy!).  He can run 
the program in PAL mode, but it bombs out his computer afterwards.  He 
also mentioned a program called newMode.  Any takers?

I did here you were making a Hired Guns clone, and I'm willing to 
help if I can, just send me some personal email on that. On my the 
methods, I'll discuss what I used via Amos when my engine is done.

>What the story on your game/engine?
Well, after Quake's engine was released, and Build had been out 
awhile, and Wolfenstein was the "grandfather" of 3d engines on the 
PC, and especially since no one had tried hard enough to make an 
engine on the Amiga, or it couldn't be done with conventional means, 
I decided to give it a shot. I love programming.

>Are you just looking for opinions or will you tell us how its done?
I'm looking for opinions NOW so I can incorporate them into my engine 
as I make it and not have to make a total revision a week later.

>Good luck with your project and give us shout when youre releasing it.

Thanks again, and I will believe me.

Subject: Scrolling Screens...
Status: O
X-Status: 

	Hello all,
	I know the list has probly entertained this
	question a zillion times before, but I can't
	seem to write a good screen scrolling routine.
	Here are the troubles I'm having...
	I've set up a tile pasting system using the
	standard icon paste routines, this seems reasonably
	fast, under 1 vbl to past a complete line, and
	I've also broken lines up into chunks pasted
	per scroll to speed this up even more.
	The problem is, using Scroll to scroll
	an entire screen (320x200) is incredibly
	slow, about 2-3 vbls.
	Further, copy from a dumby screen to a logical
	screen and swapping, for flicker free results
	is also very slow, around 2 vbls.  Screen copy
	seems to be the culprit here, as it's 2 vbls
	wihtout the obligatory wait vbl after copying.
	The result of this is that jsut the scrolliong 
	routine alone takes about 4-5 vbl.  Giving
	me about ten to twelve frames per second,
	which is too slow for even the slowest scrolling
	game.  well any ides?
		By the way, great to be back on the list,
		I was off all summer, and now am at another
		school, (the University of Chicago  :)

I think a better angle to examine would be the actual structure of the 3D
objects and figure out their format. We could then write a conversion
utility to translate Imagine and Lightwave objects to Amos3D.
I know we would have to reduce the polygon count on some of the objects,
but it's been done by other programs before.

my 2 cents

Buy The Compiler. It's the only upgrade (to v2)
If Sigmacom (Miranda, Sydney) can't get it (which they probably can't) I don't know who can
now that Amitech is gone. If you do find a supplier, let me know also.
Perhaps there is some benevolent International retailer out there....?

BTW Bob, If you hadn't guessed, I'm in Australia too..

32 Way Space Pilot Shoot em Around

Fun, fast, Raytraced GFX...

It has a config screen so you can suit it to any Amiga/ skill/ violence.

Also a screen where you can view/edit the 9 different A.I's that the Bad Guys use.

Check the .readme File and make sure to get the new version, it should contain the word - 'bugfix'. It's much better than the first.

Works on 020,030,040,060... 

I'd like to here from an A500 user.
Other comments welcome...

Have Fun.

Try making your screen bigger.  Paste your icons off the screen and use t=
he screen offset command to scroll the screen window over the actual scre=
en.  Screen Offset screen,xpos,ypos.  This command is FAST.  So, make you=
r actual game screen 2 tiles wider in every direction.  Paste your tiles,=
 scroll, and normalize.

Hi,
I'm new to this list, and I've got what may be an FAQ question.

Where  can  I  get  an  upgrade for my AMOS PRO 1.1?  Upgrades *used* to be
available  on  Aminet, I know (I've got a CDROM with some on) but no longer
because of the ban on DMS files there.  So where are they kept now?

Hi everyone,

It seems that KS3.1 does not like the way AMOS does its thing. I've got 
an old AMOS application which works fine on KS3.0. All it does is show 
some custom screens (with a horizontal scrolltext at the bottom) and 
occasionally reads from the serial port. We run this code 24hrs/day 7days 
a week on KS3.0 without any problems. However, after about 5 mins under 
KS3.1, the code causes the machine to hardware reset. I've run it without 
any serial input (just the graphics) and it still crashes.

Any ideas why this might be and how to fix it?

I upgraded to AmosPro 1.1 by buying the AmosPro Compiler, which includes the
2.0 upgrade.

What about Amadeaus computers up at Glenorie (I think) or Round corner?
They stock a lot of Amiga stuff

Question - in the expert opinions of the regulars in this group - 
which is a better programming platform, AMOS or Blitz Basic?  I am a 
former C64 programmer (long, long, LONG ago) and am considering 
creating a few games or applications for my kids to use.  But I don't 
know which is more powerful/user friendly and produces tighter code.  
I don't feel like writing assembly code for this.

Is AMOS still available for purchase?  Never see it listed for sale 
anywhere, but always see the AMOS PD CD-ROMs.  Is it on there along 
with other PD apps?

Should I assume that if one could program using the old BASIC 
languages, one can easily adapt to Blitz Basic?

I do not visit this forum often - any responses will be greatly 
appreciated if e-mailed to:

voyger3@primenet.com

Much appreciation for your time.

You could call an external program (e.g. BigAnim) to do the dirty work
for you.

APME - Amos Pro Multi Environment. It allows you to have different
configurations of extensions at boot up of Amos. It is great for
developers, as they can track down bugs caused by some of the extensions.
It also allows you to have extensions that occupy the same slot number.

Turbo - A buggy (In my opinion) extension. But it does have some very fast
procedures in it. Such as Fplot, which is 5 times faster that plot.
It's basic problem is that it's not very friendly to the stack, and can
crash it.

To the one known as Andre,

Ok, here is the list of things about both.  They both have their uses.

..better..
Platform	Amos wins this section hands down.  If you do not need AGA,
		you want to use amos.
Speed		It seems like Blitz is faster for a number of things
Development	Well, its a hell of a lot faster writing in amos, and
		testing, and compiling in a rock solid environment.
WB3.1		Amos has an annoying interlace bug, which means it can't
		display interlace on newer machines.  It also is not
		possible to use the editor on a non-genlock(TV type) screen.
AGA		No contest, Blitz wins this section.  Amos CAN do AGA with
		extensions, but it can't really write AGA games easily
		without going into assembler.
Assembler	Blitz has an in-line built in assembler which is interesting.
		Amos allows 'assembly banks' which you can call code in,
		which is less interesting.
Language	Amos wins as a better language.  There are a couple of
		fundamental things missing in Blitz, like writing procedures
		out of sequence.  Blitz INSISTS on everything being in
		order.  Blitz also has a lousy editor, wheras amos has quite
		a good one.  Blitz has an interesting 'blitz mode' where all
		commands after it are compiled without multitasking. 
		Interesting, but it is sequential only.  No forward
		declarations in Blitz.  Amos is a PROPER language.
Structures	Blitz has a full set of 'structures', and you need the
		easylife extension for amos.  Blitz is faster on this part
		though. 
Support		Amos: This list, plus a few other bits here and there.
		Blitz: The blitz list, RWE continuous development, people
		bringing out extensions every so often.  The user magazines
		just stopped being published.  (They're on disk, they cost money)
		Blitz probably has better 'support' but thats 'cos you NEED
		it.  :(
Features	Well, both have lots of features.  :-)

Summary: If you want AGA, don't care about the editor, and can stomach the
	 problems, blitz is the language for you.
	 If you don't care about AGA, and can live with the limitations,
	 amos is the language for you.

Amos was written a long time ago, before AGA graphics.  In a lot of ways it
is still the best development tool available on the amiga.  Blitz, however,
is still under development, and a PPC version of it will be available
'soon'.   They are currently installing their PPC-Power Up board.   Both
languages have their merits.

> Is AMOS still available for purchase?  Never see it listed for sale 
> anywhere, but always see the AMOS PD CD-ROMs.  Is it on there along 
> with other PD apps?

I think it is no longer available :-( but don't quote me on that.

> Should I assume that if one could program using the old BASIC 
> languages, one can easily adapt to Blitz Basic?

No.  If you want to adapt OLD basic stuff, you want a copy of HiSoft basic,
which is a 'proper' basic for the Amiga.  It does AGA, handles graphics +
workbench, and all the things you want, has a decent editor and all that. 
It has little support for games writing though, and needs a bit of O/S
knowlegde,  (read.. a lot of knowledge)  but is ideal for a lot of purposes.

Summary summary(my personal choice, alphabetical order)
	Amos:  ECS games + some stuff
	Blitz: AGA games + stuff
	HiSoft:Business stuff.

> Much appreciation for your time.

No probs.  I go through this in my head every time I write something new. 
It annoys me..  Well, at least I'm not stuck with a choice of 'abasic'
'turbo basic' and 'visual basic'.......   ;-)

Club in the world, over 2000, ya got interviews with Francois whenever you
wanted, and those newsletters were great ... I've still got a bunch around.
That's one club I couldn't believe folded.  And Jason Hutchins the Code Clinic
editor was always helping everyone and writing tons of code ... now he's into E

I use this too, but had the problem that bobs just wouldn't draw below a
certain Y co-ord (400-700 on different machines/AMOS versions)

Anyone else found this?
Anyone beaten it??

The version I have is V1.12 I don't quite remember where I got that upgrade.
(I'll try to find you the V1.12 upgrade if you want it)

The Amos Pro V2.0 upgrade is packaged with the Amos Pro compiler V2.  I 
believe that is the final upgrade to AMOS PRO.  :(   That compiler can be 
obtained for a good price from F1 Licenseware.  They have a license to sell it.

The compiler page on their web site is:

http://www.f1lw.demon.co.uk/compiler.html

They claim to be the ONLY official distributor of the Amos Pro Compiler.  
They also say that it will NOT upgrade the Amiga Format cover disk version of 
Amos Pro.  The price is: 14.99 UKP + S&H.

All the info is on the web page.

BTW they also have an amos page on their website.

Later.

Here's my first attempt at a game in AMOS.  It emulates one of those little
plastic  puzzles  that  you  see  kids with, the ones that have the numbers
scrambled, and you have to unscramble them.

If anyone has a better way, please let me know!

I think you'll have to use the X Mouse and Y Mouse commands.  Something like

if X Mouse< 200 (or whatever) and Y Mouse<150 then X Mouse=200

Subject: Screen Scrolling...
Status: RO
X-Status: 

 Hello,
        I got a number of responses to my earlier
        post and thought I'd handle it all in one
        message...
        I guess the recommended procedure was this
        Avoid using Scroll, by using Screen Offset, to
        slide the screen around then when it
        reaches the edge, use Screen Copy to move

        the visible part of the Screen back some
        then paste new tiles and slide again...

        The problem to me seems this, Screen Copy
        is almost as slow as Scroll, plus if
        the program will take longer to execute
        when the time comes to copy chinks of the
        screen around, this will produce pauses
        in the scroll making it jerk, I could
	slow things down to compensate, but then
	that would defeat the purpose, 
	also this method would require a lot
	work, if I wanted to add bobs, since
	they would have to be slid back when the scree
	screen copy's itself ect. Well
	I'm probly just understanding you guys
	wrong, so just let me know what's up,
			Thanks,

You could think about a procedure called every 1 to check it; something
like:

Every 1 Proc MOUCE

Procedure MOUCE
   If X Mouse<100 Then X Mouse=100
   If Y Mouse<100 Then Y Mouse=100
   Every On
End Proc


Otherwise you could use AMAL (I suppose, but I should check it on the
manual).

C'dore folded. We had little support down here even when they were

Is this a continuous screen or is there a limit to the edges?

If so, is the size <1024 X 1024?

If so, screw tiles.  Make one big screen and use screen offset to scroll =
around.  Bob movement and such is very effective, since they are only mov=
ing when you move them, not when the screen scrolls.

If  anyone  liked my first attempt, I have tidied it up some; added win and
restart routines, and cleaned up some other stuff.  Email me, and I'll send
it  to  you,  or  if enough people are interested, I'll send it to everyone
again.

Another Yep. I can easily lay out graphics within the interpretted environment of
AMOS, but the data structures, AGA and AmigaDOS 3.1 compatible make Blitz a
slight winner on my nifty new A1200. Locking horns with the TED editor is NOT
something I am looking forward to. So for now, I'm working with Blitz.  although
I still keep an eye on the AMOS list.

Try this: Limit Mouse X1,Y1 to X2,Y2 where X1,Y1 is the top left corner and 
X2,Y2 is the lower right corner of the box you want the mousepointer to be 
restricted to. Note that all coordinates must be hardware-coordinates!

Example: If you want to restrict the mouse to the screen-coordinates 100,50 
to 300,120 you should do like this:

Xtopp=X Hard(100) : Ytopp=Y Hard(50)
Xbottom=X Hard(300) : Ybottom=Y Hard(120)
Limit Mouse Xtopp,Ytopp to Xbottom,Ybottom

You might think that this is better:
Limit Mouse X Hard(100),Y Hard(50) to X Hard(300),Y Hard(120)
This is NOT better. I've had some trouble with this so use the first syntax.

To set the mouse free write: Limit Mouse


I hope this helped you.

Hello happy people.
Someone on here murmered something about AGA screens in amos.  Well I 
thought I will write a bit of code in C to implement this screen open 
in AGA.  There are plenty of screen opening functions in the graphics 
and intuition libraries.  On trying to compile the C source blimmin 
hundreds of errors are present! all my include files have 
dissapeared.
On closer inspection they arent the only files to shuffle of to some 
strange unknown electronic wastelands!
Does anyone know where I can get hold of the C include files again?

Also it could be possible to call the screen opening functions from 
Amos using the Openlibrary command (or something like that!)
And then send all your custom screen parameters to that.

Hmm!
Hey! check this lot out:
(I am assured that they are there)

                                        With Amos software for it!

Theres also a game rumple.lha but I have forgot where I put that!!!

OK then bye!

Much thanx and appreciation to all those "experts" that responded to 
my question of which is better, AMOS or Blitz.  I am happy to say 
that the overwhelmng majority feel that AMOS Pro is better for 
gaming, as long as AGA is not a factor, which it isn't.

As of now, I am on the hunt for AMOS Pro.  Again, much thanx to you 
all.

Amos VS C.

Ok, I have used many C compilers on the amiga, some good, some bad.  All
allow you to use any editor you please, so that full version of emacs on the
latest format CD is gonna come in handy.  The only real problem with C is
programming 'amiga' stuff with it.  The lack of information on the amiga
system, and the price of the elusive RKMs is prohibative at best, leading
you to get stuck when you want to open a screen.  (I havn't ordered the
developers CD yet)  C does produce more compact code than Amos, and has one
or two things that amos doesn't, but these can be simulated.  (see structures)
C, like Blitz and HiSoft BASIC allows full access to OS routines.  Depending
on your documentation.....

Structures: Ok, in Amos they are achived through the easylife extension,
which gives you full access to structure-type variables through clever
simulation.  I wrote something similar in amos till the extension came out..
They are not 'real' structures, but function as real structures, and are
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for anyone who isn't using them.  Its the one thing the
original amos fell short on.

If you know C, and have a damn good manual, plus the RKMs, and a lot of
patience, programming in C will pay off.  Blitz gives you real structures
and faster code, and if you can put up with the problems is a good way of
doing things.  (I would have said 'good language' but not till they fix
a couple of things)  Actually, if you use procedures very little, and do a
lot of gosubs, blitz is quite good thinking about it, but I stopped doing
unstructured code years ago.  

One massive thing in amos's favour is the stable developing environment, the
knowledge that it'll work on all amigas with no hassle, and the way you can
test things interpreted before compiling.  No other language (I know of)
allows as much freedom as amos.

Needless to say, I have a lot of compilers on my hard disks.  In the end, it
comes down to what you are doing, and what you need from the language.  They
all have their merits.

I don`t know if its much good but if you get at the AmosPro Object editor 
there is in one of the bank (possibly 15/10 I can`t remember or check) a 
Asm bank (I think) if you look through the code at the zoom routine 
you`ll find how to pass control parameters using Areg & Dreg. (If you 
cant work it out I`ll send you details) It`s very quick at moving the 
screen around but the downside is I`m not sure if you can copy on a 1:1 
ratio, you can do 1:2 & 1:4 very quickly. Failing that how about some of 
the scroll commands from Turbo+

Hope this helps,though probably won`t,

I have not seen Amos 3D, but, LightWave has not cones, cilinders and so o=
n. LightWave only has flat poligons. Modeler HAS such primitives, but the=
y are not. When you create a Cone, Modeler split it into flat polygons. S=
o, LW render such polygons.

But Real3D HAS this primitives. Objects (and primitives) are defined as m=
athematical expresions. A cone, always will be a cone, not a set of polyg=
ons with the shape of a cone. This is the reason because it is so hard to=
 find a coneverter between such programs. I thing that lasts Reals are ab=
le to use such polygons or so.

Imagine works like LW, but all the polygons in Imagine are triangles, pol=
ygons with 3 points.

I have a doc explaining LW Objects files and they are like the one used i=
n Aegis Videoscape 3D (both programs are from the same author).

First, there is a list of all the points of the object. When all point ar=
e defined, following is a list of polygons, the number of the points defi=
ning them. And of course, more datas as surface and so on...

I think that if Amos3D is based on polygons, it should be very easy to ma=

BTW, where can I get J-Windows? Can some one send it to me?

I regularly run AMOS V1.36 here on my Amiga 2000 with WB/KS3.1. I've found
no problems. I haven't tried the compiler yet, though.

Can someone tell me how to perform an autodetect for PAL/NTSC from within
Classic AMOS, also a CPU detect would be good.

Ideally I dont want to have to include extra files/libs, but read the
hardware directly.

Also, as I use only PAL, and some NTSC users have said they reboot into
PAL to use my game, can I force an NTSC machine into PAL mode and back,
or will this give NTSC users problems?

Thank you all who responded,
esp Mr Giark. -Well met indeed.

BTW, the 'bugfix' version of Cpt. Custard still isn't up on Aminet.

I will post the current version to anyone here who asks for it...
Includes- 4 extra enemy ship types, + some other new gfx.
No orange screen (oops..)
A.I. editor works and exits properly.

NTSC is on the way....

Some NTSC users won't like it, but, if you give them the option, how can =
they complain?  Also, always use the SPD variable instead of actual numbe=
rs when doing timing.  (Wait SPD instead of Wait 50 or Wait SPD/10 instea=

Does anybody know where I can get good quality sound effects for my game 
that have no strings attached ie I can use them, pay nobody, and still be 
legal? I`m specifically interested in: all guns;pistols, shotguns, uzis, 
bazookas, rocket launchers, empty clicks, reloads etc. ; people grunting 
(ooer) when they get hit, creature noises; roars, snorts etc, doors 
opening, clicks, bings, booms etc!
Phew!

I have two questions about AMOS:

1.   I  can't get RAMOS1.3 to work AT ALL.  This is the one supplied on the
AMOS  1.36  Update disk (Which WAS on Aminet until the DMS ban).  I have no
problem with RAMOS1.2.

2.   Does  anyone  have  example  code for a scrolly that goes from Left to
Right?   I  have  seen  heaps  of  them that go R-L, for example the scroll
example (example10-8) on the manual examples disk.

questions, though.  I am using TOME and was wondering about the   
scrolling.  Scrolling the map is easy, my question concerns the player's   
sprite/BoB.  Should I scroll the map and leave the player in a spot or   
should I move the player till they are say, 1 tile from the display edge   
and then start scrolling the map?

If I move the player, I am assuming I'll have to use pixels and not tiles   
for offsetting since I don't think it looks good to jump around 16 pixels   
when you are walking! :)

I must say that TOME makes things easier for creating a boardgame.  I   
just wish tiles could be any shape (hexagon or octagon) as long as they   
were all the same in each map.

Anyway, it is good to be back to doing some AMOS coding.  I hope this   
list is still helping people.  Even those that never post! :)

Check out the old messages to the list stored on aminet from about 1-2
years ago.
I posted a sample piece of code to do all that and a bit more.

I writing this from work, so I don't have my amiga with me.

oh, yes, back then my user anem was Darryl_Lewis. Just do a search for
that thru the files.

Put the text you want to scroll into a string.

A$="text to scroll"

Pad it with enough blank spaces to fill a screen line.

A$=Space$(80)+A$+Space$(80) (for an 80 wide font)

Scroll it

Right to left:

For A=1 To Len(A$)
B$=Mid$(A$,A,80)
Locate 0,10 : Print A$
Wait SPD
Next A

For left to right change the first line to:

For A=Len(A$) To 1 Step -1

I was browsing the F1 Licenseware WWW (www.f1lw.demon.co.uk) and they   
mention a Mal's Map Editor for AMOS.  Anyone used it?  Do you know how it   
compares to TOME?

In case you are curious they say the following are for AMOS along with my   
comments.

The Amos Pro Compiler    Excellent
The Intuition Extension   Excellent
The AGA Extension    Haven't tried
JWindows Extension    Demo on AmiNet
Dialog Procs     Haven't used
Image Compressor    Haven't used
Amos Beginners Guide    Haven't used
AmosZine disk magazine   These are real nice
Mal's Map editor    Haven't used

Anyone interested in drawing some 16x16 icons for me?  The game Marine:   
2002 takes place on the moon and there are 3 different colors to signify   
types of terrain.  There are also craters, etc.

I'm working on yet another large, complex project.  Has anyone ever 
played Chrono Trigger for the SNES?  Well, I've been working on an RPG in 
the same vein...no square movements, large, non-tiled backgrounds, fights 
that look like actual fights (not done yet 8^) ), and monstrously huge 
landscapes and maps.

What I need are four people.  One with a 68020, one with 68030, one '040, 
and one '060.  I need youall with these processors to try my game, once a 
good bit is done (probably in about two weeks) and see if its decently 
playable.  Previous CT experience not necessary, but any comparisons 
between the two are welcome.

Subject: Scrolling Screens...
Status: RO
X-Status: 

	Hello guys,
	I'll right I'm stil working through this Screen Scrolling thing
	My problems are these:

	Scroll command is too slow;
	Screen Copy is too slow;

	I want a continuos Scroll from a pregenerated map, using
	a set of tiles.  

	However I've run into another problem,
	Screen Swap, used after Auto Back 0 and Bob Update Off
	only seems to literally swap the physical and Logical 
	screens, not copy from Logical to Physical, the
	result being a flicker if I have open the screen
	then turn off autoback, then cls black, the
	then swapping causes the screento flash between
	black and that ugly orange Amos uses as adefault screen colour.
	Well i know that Screen Swap is supposed to do more
	but how do I get it working right?  The Manual is
	skimpy on details as are the Sample progs.

	Well any help is sure to be appreciated.

	Hello,
	I'm the lone Amiga user here at the U of C

	you guys could point me towards some of your stuff
	that might be on the Aminet or the Web, and then
	if I ever get this screen scrolling working I
	can repay the favor by uploading that.  Also
	maybe we should try and get a webcite that houses
	all our stuff, I'm allowed a free student web page
	for the next 4 years, that could get us started,
	I'm in the student computing orginization so
	I could probly get disk space to hold the actual
	files, if not at least a list of links, then
	I can just post the web address for everybody on the
	list and maybe get it listed with Amiga Web,
	well let me know what you all think, I'd
	say it would be a good way to sort of further
	unite Amos Programmers.

Yes, I don't use it much, but AMOS 1.36 and the AMOS compiler
both work fine on this A3000 with Kickstart 40.68

You need to add the command Screen Copy Physic To Logic
before you do your graphic operations.

Hi!
I'm new here on the list so you maybe want an short presentation,
I'm almost 18 year old and my first contact with amos was when I bought Eas=
yAMOS for about 3-4 years ago,
now I have AMOSPro.

I have two questions:
How can I read the values of the two analogue inputs in the joystickport?

I have noticed that there exist a few Intuition-extensions for AMOSPro. Whi=
tch of them is the best?

Hi there! I'm new on the list and would like to introduce
myself.

My name is Matthew Craven and I am 17 years old. (Though I'll
be 18 in a couple of weeks)
I live in a town called Bury which is near Manchester
in sunny old England.
I have been programming since the days of the ZX81, and when
I got my Amiga in 1992 I began programming in Amos.

I use Amos Pro v2.00 with Craft and Turbo+ extensions.
I also use the Amos Pro Compiler.

My machines:
	Sinclair ZX81 : 16K ram expansion
	Amstrad CPC6128
	Amiga 1200: 120Mb HD, 2 speed Aiwa CD-ROM
	HP Pavilion 7130 (PC): 16Mb, 1.2Gb HD, 6speed CD-ROM, modem
                             photo drive

In July this year, I got my image processor, Transfiguration
on the Amiga User International coverdisk.

My current projects include:
BLADE - a demo written in Amos
SANTA'S SLALOM - a scrolling, skiing, collecting presents
kind of game (!?!)

Anyway, I'm pretty new to this Internet thing, so I
apologise in advance for any stupid questions I ask
about it!

That should do it!

Matt C

with 030s, one with an d020, one with an 040, and one with a CD32.  I 
just want to let everyone know that I need one more person with an 060 
for this task.

The fighting part is done.  All that's left is animation and buying and 
selling items.  Then, I can put together a small section of the playing 
world for you to test.  Thanks for the response.  I'll keep you posted.

Does anybody know how to open a file for reading and writing at the same ti=
me?
There maybe exist any extension for this?

The reason why I asking this is that I want to use a so called Stream-handl=
er i.e a special
device who offers accessing a device or somethisng else without using a *.d=
evice.
Like SER: or TCP: for example.

The demo should be on AmiNET, or somebody can give you Andy's address to
contact him directly.

Greetings.

To those of you still alive, I have a request.

Question: Does anyone have any information on the vedor(s) that hold
the copyright information and legal stuff to the Turbo Plus Extension,
surnamed Craft II Turbo by Black Legend in the UK. I have a copy of it
secured from Chris, however we must be sure that the product isn't
still liscenced to anyone before he sells it to me, as so we don't
cause any legal trouble. Please reply.

Hi!!

 m> I'm new on the list...

Welcome!!!

 m> I have noticed that there exist a few Intuition-extensions for AMOSPro.
 m> Whitch of them is the best?

Intuition with Amos is possible in two ways:

1) procedures that use false intuition screens. Do NOT use them, they are
rubbish!

2) true extension to have true intuition screens.

Now, in the second group you can find 4 different extensions:

1) OS DevKit: it seemed to be good, but it's VERY difficult to use: you would
better use C instead of it.

2) Intuition extension by A.Church. It's good, even if a bit buggy. It has
some useful commands and it can handle screens, windows and windows on Wb
screen. I think you should test it and have it installed. It's shareware, but
there's a demo version available (not sure if it's on Aminet).

3) Jwindows: I have never used it: there's a demo on Aminet and it seems to
be good, but even a bit difficult to use.

4) GuiExtension by Ghizzoni. It's the BEST one!!! It's freeware and it's
available on Aminet (dev/amos/GuiExt15.lha). It's very easy to use and
powerful; it's being still developped (a newer version *should* be available
soon, /vero/?); you have to make your windows by GadToolBox, but you can use
also custom gadget.

Then, you have to remember the GuiCompiler (by Ghizzoni): it patches the
standard compiler (but does not overwrite it) to make your compiled programs
multitasking (you can use it just for programs that doesn't require the
standard Amos screen, for example made with one of the extensions listed
above).

If you want to watch some programs made by me with Intuion extension and
Gui Extension get on Aminet:
    util/time/MReminder.lha
    util/misc/Dialer2.lha
    game/think/Manos.lha
    gfx/show/PhotoCDAGA_GUI.lha

Hi there,

Well, I`ve not even heard of Chrono Trigger, but I
do have an `060.  So, if you`re desperate for an
`060 tester, I`ll do it :-)

I am writing an adventure game using Grac. I need some music. I found 
an excellent module called "Hubaluba" and I don't know who is the 
author, although I'm sure is PD.

Someone knows the author?

Or, better, is there anyone interested in making music for my game 
only (I mean, with the exact characteristics that I need)? and for 
free?

Thank you.

Hi,
Thanks to all those who replied to my plea for sound effects!
I think it was Mr. Giark who sent me a lha of samples but I deleted the
note by accident so I`m not sure, but thanks to whoever it was! 
I have a lot to live up to now though as a few people think I`m doing a 
Worms clone, sorry guys it`s not, but hopefully it`ll be as much fun!

If you have an AMOS Page, please email the URL to me.  Also, I'd like to   
register them with Yahoo, Amiga Web Directory, etc. if that is okay.  It   
seems like a search for AMOS just brings up Tori!

I am also going to make an AMOS page.  If anyone has the AMOS and AMOS   
Professional logos that I can use, I would greatly appreciate it.  I am   
going to make the FAQ a higher priority right now.  I will also include   
download links to all of the files on AmiNet.  May have to write a   
program to go to Aminet and update the links automatically, though, to   
make it easier for me.

If any Extension writers want to tell me what the latest version of their   
extension is, I'd appreciate it too.  I'd also like to get that Bug   
Report form completed.  I know I always talk about these things but   
nothing seems to happen.  Hopefully, this will be different.

See ya!

Well, you may not redirect the screen created by amos to any other mode
using newmode. The screen is just there to ensure the chip registers are
correct when flipping to the 15Khz display.

Hello mattiasc@algonet.se (Mattias Carenhed). You wrote some lines of text,
which I must comment on now:

> Does anybody know how to open a file for reading and writing at the same time?

As far as I know the Sload and Ssave commands do not check if a file has
been opened for reading or writing. Otherwise it can't be a big problem to
fool AMOS thinking this file is writable aswell. Check the Fichiers bit in
the amos include files.

Best regards

This one bombs out on me, Mouse commands don't work, writing to a window

GadToolsBox...I have version 2.0c, but it hates my computer.  Is there a

Hi, all.

I coded 64x64 picture zoomer and it works well on my A1200/030/50.
But, a problem is that, it's very slow. I think this operation is
not suitable on Plannar screen.

Well, a question is, can someone let me know about Chunky2Plannar
on AMOS. Is there any c2p converter for AMOS?
I think 2x2 or 2x1 blitterscreen is good, are there any comments?


Thanx!

	So I've been storing up the recommendations I've gotten

Well, AMCAF V1.40 has got some hidden c2p routines. You might want to try
them out.

I hate blitterscreen. It's just ugly on a high-res monitor.

Do this, but better still, why not setup an AMOS web ring. This is a
method for allowing all the AMOS sites to contain links to each other
without even knowing where each other are.

Have a look at http://www.webring.org/ for details. It needs one person
to set it up and become the ring master (Mike?) then everyone else with
an AMOS WWW site just fills in a form and adds a chunk of HTML (supplied
by webring.org) to their pages.

For an example of a web ring in use, look at the following site:

	http://www.dreamscape.com/overlord/civ2/civ2main.html

P.s. Before anyone asks, no Civilization II is not available for the
amiga
yet :(    (Well, I have a PC too, so I'm not :(, but others may be)

Well, I've tracked the elusive `bug' in SoloTrek II.

It isn't a bug in the code (knew it!), it's the GFX file.  THe bobs of the Q
anim have become corrupted and, as a result, the entire Bob file has gone
totally flaky.  I'll have to redo the Bobs.  Argh.  Or, maybe I can find an
old version somewhere with the bobs intact.  My apologies to all, and I hate
when that happens.
 
Well met and godspeed,

Hiya everyone !
I'm working on a PacMan game and have completed the shell of the game but 
I need some person or persons to help me with it since I suffer from a 
lack of motivation. I am not an expert and the code is pretty untidy 
(lots of global variables and stuff) but it would be great to get a 
working game out on the Aminet for example.

So, if you want to give me hand with this venture and perhaps others (I 
am in a similar boat with a Breakout clone called Bigtime featuring loads 
of Byork samples and cool quiz game) drop me a line and let's make the 
Amiga even more TOP BANANA ! 

Also drop me a line if you want more info.

Thanks for your time !

Well, I have tried that but I didn't like it. It seemed to be more complicated than making MUI
interface in C for example.

Hello!!

I told it: there are some bugs. By the way I'm using it to make an utility
and it has worked well without a crash for the last weeks.
At the moment I'm using Intuition extension and gui extension at the same
time: I have 2 windows: the first one is opened with intuition extension
since I need for some gfx and intuition supports it in a better way; the
other has just some buttons and so I used Gui extension.
They work together very well.

Sorry, but I'm still using 2.0b and it works very well.

Yes it is. I'll probably use the BSP-tree sorting method.

You're doing it wrong.  The input commands work on specific types of data.  
Try something like this:  (and give me a credit :)

Procedure _GETPORT
   A$=""
   A=Port(2)
   If A<>-1
      A$=Chr$(A)
   End If 
   If A=3
      PRT["**Break**  Type quit to exit"]
   End If 
End Proc[A$]
Procedure INIT
   Open Port 3,"raw:/240///Keyboard input."
End Proc
Procedure INPT[A$]
   Print a$;
   A$=""
   While Q$<>Chr$(13)
      _GETPORT
      Q$=Param$
      If Q$=Chr$(13)
         Print#2,""
      Else If Q$<>""
         A$=A$+Q$
         Print #2,Q$;
      End If 
   Wend 
End Proc[A$]

Heres a thought.  Can someone (authors preferred) post a list of the
commands in each extension ?  (+cost if any)  I've long since lost track..

..Plus a couple of lines describing the main functions of the extension,
y'know, go faster graphics, cool effects, more stars....  (if it's not
blazingly obvious from the command names)

It would be good to compile a complete extended command set, which would
most probably be of major interest..

I wrote a program a few years ago that lists all the commands on all the
installed extensions - I'll try to find it.

That would be very handy to have! Let us know when you're done.

Turbo Plus (Craft 2 Turbo) specs: (quoted from their promo)

- scene commands for high speed map drawing
- excellent map editor, automaze mode, brushes, random range draw, stencils,
maze generation, loads TAME and TOME maps.
- Color Font commands, font util, lots of fonts
- faster graphics commands, plotting, drawing, boxes, circles
- 3D graphics commands at high speed
- faster, more flexible zone handling, high speed Turbo check zones
- quick bitwise ops, extraction, insertion, testing, shifting
- bitplane ops, shifting, erasing, rotate, restrict, drawing to certain
bitplanes
- Turbo starfields:  100's of stars controlled with ease, even under
interrupts
- Vector Objects, create your own objects and manipulate them in
real time
- Hyperspeed Block and Icon commands
- smooth scrolling for up to 96 zones with one command, even under interrupts
- multitasking control, extended conditions, lots of functions

Dudes,

Well lads, here we go again with another death ... I just got e-mail from Simon
Martin of IncaGold Innovations in the UK, saying that Kompart/Black Legend has
gone out of business.  They used to sell the Turbo Plus Ext under the new name
Craft 2 Turbo.  Simon's in charge of checking on Kompart's e-mail.  He knows of
no one taking over the rights to Kompart's software.

So the old question pops up again ... what do we do for coders who want Turbo
Plus?  Copying out-of-publication software hurts no one, but I feel we owe it
to try and get in touch with the main author, Manual Andre, so see if he is
still personally selling it (with printed docs).  He may have sold off the
rights completely to Kompart.

The right way for authors to handle dropping a product is what Totally AMOS
did.  TA was licenceware, and when they quit, they put a declaration on the
final issue that as of that date, all issues became PD and distributable.

If authors turn their back on a product, what do you lads think of us making
copies for coders? ... and does anyone know Manual's e-address? ... is he still
in Belgium?

-Chris.

Did you guys know there is an Internet "store" that will sell
your software for a 20% commission?  It's a good way to market
your software without any publication costs.

The site is called Albert's Ambry, and they ask you to sign a 1
year contract that you won't use any other "store", (I've never
even heard of any other).  You are still free to sell the
software yourself, or thru' online services like Compuserve, or a
real store, or anything that isn't a Net store.  You also agree
to handle all customer support.

They have an Amiga section at the site, altho' their PC section
is much bigger.  I just signed up lately with my AMOS school
arcade game Spell Chopper, but my friend has been on longer with
his Amiga graphics utilities, and he has quite a few sales.  They
pay authors 4 times per year.  You get an ID and password to the
Author's Area so you can see how sales are going, etc.

They ask for a trial version of your software that the user can
download and check out, and a full registered version that the
user must supply a credit card # for payment before downloading.
My trial version is identical except all levels but one are
crippled.

To check out the site go to:

http://www.alberts.com

and to talk to Ray (the boss) e-mail:

RayCoche@voicenet.com

or call him on their toll-free line: 800-996-2252
He's cool, you'll enjoy the chat.

If you get to the point where you want to put software on their
site, they e-mail you the directions, but it's for PC's, and they
don't have Amigas, so their tech staff can't do it for you like
they do for the PC authors if they want.  But my bud has figured
it all out and did mine, and could give you tips if you need
them, let me know.

AMOS lads,

Xmas is coming early for ya! ... I've got all this AMOS stuff that was great
fun, but I've got to clear it out and make room, and I hate to just copy over
the disks.  So have a look at it, whatever you want is yours for the cost of
Air Mail postage.  Or they're freebies if you come to Ontario, Canada and pick
them up ... ya only have to buy me a beer.  Each of the club issues originally
cost about 3 UKP / $5.00.

AMOSZINE - issues 4-11, the premier AMOS club during the last 3 years, started
by F1 Licenceware owner Steve Bye, staffed by all the AMOS code stars, tons of
columns, code, reviews, contacts.   Most issues are 3 disks, total of 21
original disks, all for $6.00.

NOTHING BUT AMOS - issues 1, 5, 6, 7.  2 disks/issue.  8 original disks.  Good
stuff, tutor on huge baddies, "Electric Eel", etc.  $5.00.

WHITBY AMOS Club - complete set of issues 1-8, 2 disks/issue. WAC was noted for
it's huge RPG tutorial series over several issues.  Edited by several big AMOS
names.  16 original disks, $6.00.

MR. AMOS Club - complete set of issues 1-6, 1 disk/issue.  The best tutorial
AMOS club ever, edited mainly be Bell and Kennedy. Huge multi-part Street
Fighter clone tutorial, huge Dizzy clone scroller tutor, huge Alien Breed clone
tutor, and others.  Brian Bell won the AF Gamesmaster contest with "Charlie
Chimp", which went on to be a commercial product.  6 disks, $5.00.

TOTALLY AMOS - run by the Tuckers at the UK AMOS club and PD Library, longest
running AMOS disk mag.  The owners declared all issues became PD as of TA's
termination in May 95.  Issues 0, 1, 3-6, 17-21.  12 disks, $6.00.

AMOS Club USA - issues 1-4 (after they switched from paper to disk in 95), 1
disk/issue, a thin job but the postage is cheap, $2.00.

AMIGA CODERS CLUB - "Hardware Programming Manual", 4 original disks.  This
"manual" is their standard 4 disk ASM code tutorial, updated for newer CPU's
and OS's.  Well written, not hard to follow.  The ACC is still active I think,
they were up to 30 or so monthly club disks a while ago, but I don't have any
of those.  $4.00.

Amiga 'C' - 1 disk, $2.00

Amiga Assembler/AmigaDOS Developer's Manual, 1 disk, $2.00

AMOS PD disks - 486, 490, 500, 598, 602, 620, 756.  7 for $4.00.

AMOS 3D - 1 original coverdisk left, mag docs.  $3.00 for the disk, $6.00 with
107 page real docs.

Craft I Extension - 3 original coverdisks left, incl docs, $3.00 each.

AssemPro manual, by Abacus, 104 pages, $5.00  (if you also want the disk let me
know).

"AMOS Pro Interface Editor" by Richard Jones, full version, requires AMOS Pro,
"creates complex user interfaces", 1 original disk, $3.00.

MEGA-MAC-MAP:  "Mega Mr. AMOS Club MAP" version 2.0, Bell's mapping control for
games like Dizzy, 1 disk, $3.00.

**Charlie Chimp won the Amiga Format mag AMOS Gamesmaster contest**
Charlie Chimp 1 and Charlie Chimp 2, source code, 1 disk, $3.00.

Charlie Chimp 1 & 2:  complete playable games with pics etc, 2 disks, $3.00.

MAPP:  "Mr. AMOS Programmer's Pack", remember when Playfield sold this for
$29.00?, 7 disk pack, "over 500 source programs", selected by the MAC staff.
$5.00.
--------------------------------------------------

OK, that's all of them I think.  The bargain of the century.  Payment is OK in
your paper money, any currency, or your personal cheque in your currency.  For
arranging sales, better use my "work" e-mail at this address (it's more
stable):

CEvans@bbs.multiboard.com

and e-mail me for my snail mail address.  If you already have my address, don't
send payment without telling me, let me know so I can hold the stuff for you. 
After a few weeks I'll post a "leftovers" message of what I still have left.

I don`t know if it`s the same thing but in the craft extension there was 
a program that did this. I`ll see if it`ll work without craft.

  I don`t know if any of you ever got hold of a magazine called Zoo #1 -
  Unborn, but anyway, it was basically a general magazine coded in amos by
  myself - The code was given away (not that it had anything to do with me
  not having the compiler ;) and that was that (sorry for this poor english
  :)... Anyway - getting to the point, I was hoping for this next issue I
  could get some AMOS users to type some articles for the magazine, so far
  we have a 100 articles but we still need a few more - Email me an
  article(or 2!) and I`ll send you the source for the mag+the finished
  magazine - the interface  knocks the spots off most others :-)

  I would be most greatful for any articles, thanking you in advance...

Well, I'm not that familiar with asmprogramming, but in order to check this

I think that it should be ok to copy any defunct software, since it is no
longer hurting anyone's profits. By that argument, is anyone still
supporting/selling amos Pro?

Questions:

1.  Which published book about AMOS PRO would be best for an AMOS beginner
to learn the ins and outs of AMOS programming?

2.  Can AMOS PRO be installed to hard drive, or do I have to run it from
floppy?  If it can be installed to hard drive, do I just copy all the
files to directories and create an Assign for the path?

Anyone?

Yes.  F1 Licenseware (www.f1lw.demon.co.uk) sells it.  So, no spreading.

AMOSPro can be installed on a HD, it has its own install programme, in AMOS

I meant they sell the Pro Compiler.  Not Pro.  Sorry bout that.  But, i
think AMOS Pro is still protected by the law.

While I am here.  Anyone heard of an Electrohome C34 Monitor?

Try Ultimate Amos written by Jason Holborn. Published by Future Publishing
(ISBN 1-89827-502-5)
It takes you through most aspects of Amos, and though it focuses on games
writing, it teaches programming techniques which are pretty useful in other
areas.

Yes it can be installed to hard drive. It's a long time since I installed it,
but I think there's an install program on one of the disks. If not, try
copying the Amos_Pro_System disk to the hard drive and assigning
Amos_Pro_System (or AmosPro_system) to the directory where you copied it.

Hope this helps.

I found the Easy AMOS manual to be very helpful.

Yes it can.  Make a dir called AMOS_Pro: and assign it.  In it, copy the
APSystem disk.  Then, make dirs with the same names as all the other disks
(productivity1, examples, etc) and copy the contents of each disk into its
drawer..

Yes I expect it is protected if Europress or Francois wanted to chase ppl down,
I just can't imagine either of them caring a hoot about it the way they've
turned their backs on it.  I've sometimes wondered if Francois has peronal
copies of the book/disks that he would sell.

Hi Mike,
I tho't the Pro from F1 was just the upgrade that comes with the Pro Compiler.
Does F1 have the complete Pro for a first time buyer, and the book?  What would
a newbie do?

There's another good point ... Europress and Francois refused to discuss
selling the rights to the Pro to anyone ... AMOSzine, Mark at Club USA, no one,
and now Francois is heavily into PC Click and Play, the PC multimedia package,
with the developer's add-on Click and Create.  BTW, he should be doing fine,
Europress has licenced Corel Inc in No. America to distribute it, (they're the
new owners of Word Perfect, Corel Draw, etc, and it's about $500, full page ad
in the PC magazines.  But that's fine, I like to see Francois get some decent
return for all the years he's been coding.

When AMOS the Creator was done, the AMOSzine staff published the docs on one of
their issues and presumably the program was copied for all coders as well.
Of course the Pro manual, about 2 fingers thick, is a huge undertaking to put
on disk.

When I boot with a 3.1 WB floppy, Amos installer tells me that there is not enough space on my sys:disk....

So I remove some files like Ed and Multiview from that disk and reboot and try to install again.  Now the installprocess starts, it updates my AmosProdisk and
after that I click on Ok to get it all installed on my HD. I choose a directory and 
the installer checks if there is enough space
 - and there is plenty of that.
After that the program reads a few seconds
and finally it says: 'an error while writing the files has occured'.

And that's it. I've tried this many many times but always end up with that error.

I'm not using any piratecopies but the disks
I bought some years ago. I've tried to install with disk with no 2.0 update but it doesn't help.

I've also tried to install it manually but the
program just crashes when I click on that 
nice AMOSProicon.

I don't understand this at all, especially since I've used this program many years before.

So I would be most happy If anyone knows what possibly can be wrong.
I don't have many programs running in startup so I don't think that causes this fault.

And: Is there some way I can install this manually? Just copying the files isn't enough?

Has someone else had the same problem?

I don't know which book would be the BEST so I won't be much help here.
I only have experience with "Mastering Amiga Amos".  I can say that it is a 
good beginner's book to learn the ins and outs of AMOS programming.

AMOS PRO can definitely be installed to HD.  On the System disk in the 
complete AMOS Pro package there is an installer program that'll take care 
of installation.  I don't think that if you copy it to HD manually you'll 
need an assign.  I have no assign and mine works fine.

'Amiga Game maker's manual' by Stephen Hill, published by Sigma Press is an
excellent book.  Perhaps not exacly what you are asking for but it's filled
with programming examples, useful tips, etc.  ISBN number is 1-85058-230-0.

(Hope this letter isn't a duplicate again :)

This one's been sent to the list twice recently, one that's called

and is there somebody here with a manual?? Both for TOME and AMOS Club. My
previous version of Club had only 3 commands, this one had quite a few
more...75 to exact.

While I'm at it, was the Mapeditor for TOME updated as well somewhere
along the way??

[About the tome extensions in the list]

 JT> This one's been sent to the list twice recently, one that's called
 JT> 4.24 and one 4.24Plus. What's the difference??

I'm  not  sure  if you referring to the one I've also sent.  You're talking
about  an 'plus' version??  To my knowledge there's only Chis and mine tome
extensions  floating  around in the list.  Both works to Amos Pro.  Perhaps
you are talking about the 'Turbo Plus' extension??

 JT> and is there somebody here with a manual?? Both for TOME and AMOS Club.

Recently  there was this question about if out-dated extensions is ok to be
copied.   I  suppose  that Chris sent his tome extension so that the people
that  have  bought  Tome  (and  have  the  manual)  can continue to use the
extension  on  Amos Pro.  I don't mind making a quick Tome doc, but perhaps
it  would be best if someone could contact Aaron Fothergill and verify with
him if this is ok.  Does someone know if he has a email address??

 JT> While I'm at it, was the Mapeditor for TOME updated as well somewhere

There's  no  versionstring  in the TOME.AMOS program(13-Nov-92) I got along
with my copy of Tome, but it's size is 264394 bytes, if that would help.

I wonder if he has done anything with AMOS in his spare time.  I was
reading Ultimate AMOS and it kept talking about the "promised AGA
compatible AMOS Pro."  If you could only hold compaines to their word.

Yes, both works in AmosPro but they're different in size and if you compare
them from within Amos with "About loaded extensions", one of them has a plus
appended to the name. I don't remember off-hand which one was sent by you
though.

I'm not refering to the Turbo Plus extension, which is also installed
together with lots of other extensions. 19 all together...

Which isn't of any help to me unfortunately. I did bought it for Amos 1.3
but that's of no help due to:

1. The badly written manual (read leaflet)
2. There's new commands that I have no idea of how to use (there are some
   differences between 3.1 and 4.24 after all).

What's the legal status of the Amos Club Extension then? Can that one be
freely copied?

You have a newer version than me then, since mine is just 216854 bytes.

  This message was written due to a post by chrisevans pointing out some
  problems in my last post, thanks :)

  I am sorry I was so vauge(sp?) about what kind of articles were in the
  previous issue of Zoo.
  Previosly we have gone for very general articles ranging from music and
  tv to programming and strange alien reports!
  So....
       We are looking for articles that can be about ANYTHING, but because
  the magazine is programmed in AMOS and   I do a LOT of AMOS programming I
  would like to have a large AMOS section so if you want to write in
  something           about AMOS then, that`ll be OK.

  Also, as a little x-tra to this message, I will be soon posting a demo of
  my new game, Ruins so, be prepared for lotsa playtesting (if you want to
  that is).

  Oh, I almost forgot, does ANYBODY have any code for fast parallel linkup
  code?  I am finding it difficult writing linkup code when I only have one
  Amiga and nobody in the 14 storey flat( my uni halls!) seems to have one!
  You will be fully credited for your help...

       Thanks in advance, Melee / Panda

Ah,  didn't know that.  But do now :) Well, the smaller one is converted by
Chris, and the bigger one by a friend I know.  I suppose Chris is better at
optimizing code than my friend :) Perhaps the 'plus' sign is there to point
out it's for the Amos Pro version.  Better to ask Chris about that.

It's quite big, so I don't think it's a good manner to send it to the list,
but if someone can verify that the Tome packet in these days is PD (because
of  non-exsisting  development)  I'd  be  happy to send it through email if
anyone wants it. Or perhaps there's a official Amos ftp site somewere??

If so, I'll certainly take a copy.
