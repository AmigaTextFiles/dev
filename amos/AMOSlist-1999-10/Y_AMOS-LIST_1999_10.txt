   * ASCII signitures have been rebuilt where possible.
     Unfortunately Yahoo store messages in a way which means more than 1 space
     is stored as just 1 space. Viewing the message source, and then trying to
     view HTML source in Firefox didn't make any difference.
     Where I have been unable to rebuild the ASCII signitures I have simply put
     "ASCII Signiture As-Is" by the message number.

     Thanks to Mark de Jong (from the AMOS-LIST) for helping me with rebuilding
     Floquet's ASCII signiture. (who else would keep emails for 7 years?!)

     Thanks to Andrew Allen for preserving Peter Cahill's ASCII signiture for
     me (see message 1613) in November 1998.

     Thanks to Michael Cox, as I was able to cross-reference some emails from
     the Onelist archives with ones posted to the Yahoo one to reinstate email
     addresses that Yahoo has discarded, and rebuild some ASCII signitures.

   I hope everyone enjoys reading the messages and appreciates me archiving

   rebuild the ASCII signitures as best as I could.

Where's Amos 2.0

-------
Somehow I missed the release of Amos 2.0.
I've reviewed the last 900 messages to the list,
but found nothing about upgrading.

I'm still in the dark ages with Amos 1.0.

Can anyone tell me how to get updated?

Intuition extension docs

Hi there,

I´ve been searching the web for a documentation
of the Intuition extension. I´ve downloaded the file
from the Amos Factory but there was only a text file
with a short discription of the commands included.
Do you know where I can get a more comprehensive
documentation?

If there is nothing like that could you tell me how to open
a Screen like 800x800 on my GFX Board (PicassoIV).

Thanks,
Wolfe

Well, I've got the complete guide if you need it.

By the way, make sure it's version 1.3a and not 1.3b, because 1.3b is completely
full of bugs and all the useful stuff doesn't work...

See ya :)

....and if it is HACKING you want then AMOS directly supports that
even without trying. LOL

Okay.... seriously, AMOS would be great for direct hardware access.
It supports Poke, Peek, Doke, Deek, Loke, Leek.

Help with Gui Help

Tue Oct 5, 1999 8:32 pm
Declan Gorman <decg@gofree.indigo.ie>


Hello All,
I am looking into adding an online help system to my program but am
have difficulty. I think the problem has got to do with the way Gui
Help handles multi dimensional arrays, or should that be how it doesn't
handle them.

The syntax within the amiga guide documentation does not state clearly
that a multi dimensional array cannot be used but the syntax is as
follows

Gui Help window,display gadget,array address

The example within the documentation is

GAD$(0)="Hello" GAD$(1)="This is a listview" etc.,etc.

Gui Help 1,2,Array(GAD$(0))

So, although the example only demonstrates with a one dimensional array,
does this mean that it cannot handle multi dimensional arrays?

Pietro? Anyone?

Thanks in advance.

Declan.

I'm not sure if the 2.0 GUIX has changed that aspect of it, but 1 dimensional

Read huge files

Wed Oct 6, 1999 9:53 am
"floquet" <floquet@hp-sc.univ-lille2.fr>


Hello, all.

I read MP3 files to extract the famous ID3 Tag that contains song name,
artist and so on.
For the moment I load the entire file in memory, using bload and it
works fine except 2 points :
- Some files are really huge (I found some up to 30Mb), so this amount
of memory is needed.
- Loading the entire file is slow, even on a 40x CD reader, even if it
is a "normal" 4-5 Mb file.

I tried to open the file with the random option with one single field
with a length of 255, but it seems that if the last record does not fill
the 255 characters, it seems to be ignored.
I tried a field with a lenght of 1 byte, but it seems that Amos cannot
GET records with a huge record number. GET 1,I with I containing
30.000.000 does not work.

So here is the question:
How can I quickly read the (let's say) 255 last bytes of a given file ?
The file can have *any* size, from 0 to megabytes.

You can download the V1 of the program on my webpage. It is slow and
ugly, but works.
V2 will include an intuition GUI (Thanx Declan) and if we can solve the
problem I asked for, a fast scan.

Thank you by advance for any help !

Open in 1,"MyFile"
Pof(1)=Lof(1)-255 : Rem Set Position Of File to 255 bytes less the end

A$=Input$(1,255)

Close 1

Print A$ : Rem A$ = last 255 bytes

I hope this is right, i havent used AMOS in a while, too busy messing with C.

Well, Hypermart (free business hosting) offers 10MB of disk space and full
custom CGI access (Perl4/5). Tripod just recently started offering full
CGI access (Perl5), which is in beta-test. They offer 11MB of disk space.

If it's CGI access that you need, you could try either of these, or goto
Yahoo and search for "free CGI access". And if 10MB of space isn't enough,
then you could always store your archive of messages on another server (or
convert the digest messages from Onelist). :) Anyhow, hope this helps.

Well, it looks ok, but if that doesn't work, you could use Sload to load bits
of the file, until you get to the right place, it'd be as slow as loading the
whole thing, but it wouldn't hog memory

If needed, I could probably knock something up for you :)

Well, if it was stored in a memory bank, then I'd think you could use some
c2p for copying the bitmap onto the screen. All you'd have to do is obtain
some c2p's (I would recommend Kalms, from Aminet) and modify them to work
from either an asm Procedure or an AMOS Bank (using Call).

Cap'n Bubba Dungeon Update.

Thu Oct 7, 1999 11:05 pm
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


Greetings, CBATNAM'ers.

Anyone here from the original CBATNAM beta-test team care to see the
latest Dungeon demo (which will be available in a few days)? If so, mail
me and I'll send it to you. If you recall, I implemented some of Kalm's
c2p's (with the help of PAC) which make the Dungeon rock now. Here are the
latest stats:

(Amiga 2000, '040/28mhz, ECS, 64 colors)
8-12fps Highest detail texture mapping (2x2)
20-22fps Lowest detail texture mapping (6x6)

The c2p's are optimized for AGA, so (in theory) an equivalent '040 with
AGA (i.e. A1200/A4000) could get double these frame rates easily. And,
yes, everything is written ENTIRELY in AMOS, except for the c2p graphics
routines, which are Assembler routines used through an Extension. :D

Anyhow, if you want to see the latest demo (when it is finished), please
mail me or Giark, and we will send it to you soon. Thanks again. :)

Yes setting the file pos pointer works very fine & fast and uses small
memory.
I tried it last evening, wow !
When the program took 2 seconds per file to load it and seek the ID3
tag, it takes... well it's too fast, I can't read the filenames on the
screen !
I did not try with 30Mb files yet, although.

So next week, you will be able to download the new version of the
MP3LIST program. I still have to check 30Mb files, update the .readme
file, create the .lha file...

Lots of features are still missing and a few bugs remaining, but all
this will be soon fixed.

Thanx a lot for those who helped me !

Y2K

Fri Oct 8, 1999 9:12 am
<ric0@xs4all.nl>


Hi people!

I'm just here for one short question, I couldn't find any information
about it on the Web.

Here at the NOB, a company that provides facilities for broadcasting
companies, we have an Amiga. It's an oldy; Amiga 2000 running KS 1.2.

It's just used for making Weather forecasts for "Jeugdjournaal" (Youth
News). Years ago some programmers made this, IMO nice, program which has
an easy click interface to make a short forecast animation.

The program is written in AMOS. So it probably is an AMOS executible.

The question is: will it suffer from any Y2K bugs?

I've read about the Amiga's Y2K problems (Well... the lack of them ;), but
I also want to check on AMOS. Although this application is not really
using dates or writing files.

Thanks in advance...

Depends on how it's written but probably not.
You can always check by changing date and "simulate" y2k.

If the AMOS-program isn't written in a bad way there won't be any problems
and I really doubt that AMOS it self would suffer from y2k bugs since
AMOS hasn't any own commands for date. There are extensions though
with date-functions but as they (probably) read the system-time it won't
be any problems there either.

If you haven't allready, download the patch for 1.2 machines from amiga.com..
If I remember correctly those machines will have trouble setting the time/date

Cap'n Bubba Dungeon Send-out

Fri Oct 8, 1999 9:30 pm
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


Lo, everyone.

Well, I've had several responses for the latest Dungeon demo, which I will
be sending out as soon as I can. Some of those who have asked for it are
not from the original beta-testing team, so, unless Giark has any problems
with it, I will go ahead and send the demo to these people anyways.
(Giark?)

BTW, for those who are not familiar with CBATNAM (or "Cap'n Bubba and the
Nasty Alien Menace"), it is an international team project which origniated
on the List over 3 (!!) years ago, but has yet to be finished due to many
factors, two of which are hardware-related problems and lack of code and
graphics. Not all of us have given up, however. :)

The final game will contain the following levels:

1. a Side-scrolling level (Garfield Benjamin)
2. a "Space Harrier"-type level (Kieth Hill)
3. a "Tekken"-type level (Andy Hawkins)
4. a "Wolfenstein"-Dungeon level (me) :)
5. a "Bubble Bobble"-secret level (Peter Cahill/James Brown)

Giark was the original co-ordinator of the project, and Braneloc (Keith
Hill) has since joined him in overseeing the project and assembling the
final bits of code. All that is lacking is my level, some graphics and
some animations. Nevertheless, it WILL be finished, so expect to see it
soon. :D

Actually, a cool new bit, is just what the project needs to kick it to
completion. It'll inspire the remaining creative people to finsihing the
project. We know who we are.

Portracker module. Nothing too complex, just the basics - track layout,
sample data layout etc. Im writting a Midi to MOD converter (theres plenty of
MOD to midi) and I have so many midi files i want to use in AMOS. If anyone
can help, or at least point me in the right direction of a site that may
contain the info id bve very grateful. Ta

Octamed Sound Studio can import midi files, then you can change the midi
notes to amiga samples.

cd.device is available with os v40 (CD32 and later)
cdplayer.library on aminet acts as a nice interface to the ...
scsi.device commands to send codes to the cd player (IDE emulates SCSI)

I have used cdplayer.library from Amiga E, it works but seems a bit
unreliable (sometimes the CD drive locks up). Docs are german only.

Ok, there are three ways I can think of:

1. Somehow use the CD.device (I have no idea how)

2. Use a CDPlayer program that has a CLI interface (if any?)

3. Use a player with an AREXX interface (such as interplay)

I could actually see if I can through some AREXX together to get it to work
with interplay if you liked :)

See ya :)

Be aware that 3rd party CD drives and CD32 drives are usually two entirely

Amos Games

As it seems to be a bit quiet on this list at the moment, I thought I would
plug my games which were recently featured in Amiga Format :)

They're freely available on Aminet (now it's back up!) together with the
_Amos source_.

Although some were written in AmosPro, they should all work under 1.3 (I
think!), and don't use any extensions other than the standard.

By the way, I once wrote a game called 'Mr E.' It was a 3d platform/puzzle game,
the first (and LAST) attempt I made at using that god-awful 3D extention for
amos ;)


Maybe I should release it sometime? On seccond thought, nah.

Hi,

I require some testers for the new game from JokerD, Aliens: Homeworld.

The main menu is done at the moment and requires testing on as many machines as
possible, altho' its AMOS based so probably won't work on GFX-card equipped
machines ;)

I'm going to start the game engine at the weekend. The game will be a cross
between Alien Breed '92 etc. and Metal Gear 2 on the MSX. Baically a Stealth
Shoot Em Up.

a demo should be available relatively soon.

i'll be putting more info on my site within the next few days.

Cya!

Um, if it's in Amos then those programs will have no effect what so-ever,
anyway if anything they should fix flickering.

Hi Everybody,

Ok, basically you open an intuition screen with the intuition extention (only
use version 1.3a though)

Then, (this only works if you're displaying one screen at once, and not using
the amos joystick and inkey$ routines) copy the current amos screen to the
intuition screen with Amos Iscreen Copy every frame.

To access keyboard use key state() and for joystick use the lowlevel library
routines (that'll let you use cd 32 pads as well)

for the mouse, just change all the mouse x&y to imouse x /y etc...

It's a rather rudimentery method, but it works :)

See ya :)

Hi Everybody,

Does anyone know how to change RGB colour values to and fro the HSV value
system?

See ya :)

colorwheel.gadget (I think) has library calls for that (possibly, it
has BOOPSI methods for sure), but it might be awkward. And needs OS 3.

OK, lame Question #527 !

In Classic AMOS the default font was stored in Dir AMOS_SYSTEM as Default.Font

But what is it stored under for AMOS_Pro ? I cant find it anywhere ! And i
cant find anything that tells me where its sposed to be. I dont mean thefonts

(Sorry for ugly typing - my space key and my 'N' are in bad moodz at the
moment)

There are some different ways of representing a colour.
except for the trivial rgb-representation the most common one is hue,
saturation, value (hsv)

In the following explanation, r, g, and b will be considered floating point
values from 0 (black) to 1 (full colour)

HUE is the position on the colour-wheel - from 0 to 360 with 0:red, 60:yellow,
120:green, 180:cyan, 240:blue, 300:magenta, 360:red.
If the values should be represented all correctly I would assume that you
would use some sort of sine-calculations to convert from HUE to rgb, but in
fact you just use a linear interpolation. That is 0 is r:1 g:0 b:0, 60 is r:1
g:1 b:0 and inbetween you use g=hue/60
This representation of hue ensures that minimum one of the three colours, r,
g, and b will be 0 and minimum one will be 1 - nomatter what value of hue you
select. (That is: from 0 to 60 blue is 0 and red is 1 ; from 60 to 120 blue
is 0 and green is 1, from 120 to 180 red is 0 and green is 1, etc)

Then you use saturation and brightness to scale the colour so that you don't
need to have one colour 0 and one colour 1:

SATURATION is the distance from the lightest colour to the darkest, measured
in percent. That is: 100 means that the darkest colour is 0 (black) and 0
means that the darkest colout iquals the lightest colour (that is, all three
colours are the same - the colour is black/grey/white)

VALUE is the distance from the lightest colour to black. That is 0 means that
the lightest colour is 0 (black) and thereby: all three colours are black.
100 means that thelightest colour is 1.

Sometimes HSV is known as HSB (B=Brightness). The term is moreaccurate, but
there then is confusion between blue and brightness, so I prefer HSV.
There are also other colour formats, i.e. Cyan, Magenta, Yellow (CMY) where
c=1-r, m=1-g, y=1-b (actually only used in printers and scanners, i think)

And then I've once seen some "HPV" quite similar to HSV but with V=0:Black
(like in HSV) V=100:White (unlike HSV)
To get aclean colour you use HSV:V=100, HPV:V=50

The HPV conversation is more complex than HSV but I guess that HPV is nicer to
work with since the brightness of the colour is closer to V in HPV than to V
in HSV. Nevertheless I've only included RGB<->HSV in the following example.

The rgb<->hsv procedures works with floating pointvalues. r,g and b in [1,0],
h in [0,360], s and v in [0,100]
Call the rgb-conversation-procs to convert rgb-formats to some moreusefull
stuff:


Ex: Convert 24bit RGB to HSV:

RGB82F[R] : R#=Param#
RGB82F[G] : G#=Param#
RGB82F[B] : B#=Param#
RGB2H[R#,G#,B#] : H=Param#
RGB2S[R#,G#,B#] : S=Param#
RGB2V[R#,G#,B#] : V=Param#

Ex: Convert HSV to 24bit RGB:

HSV2B[H,S,V] : B#=Param#
RGBF28[R#] : R=Param
RGBF28[G#] : G=Param

It worked perfectly :) Except it completely failed when compiled. I fixed
that by re-writing the min()/max() bits by using if's.

Hello All,
My current project consists of a large number of variables that read from
a large number of data statements. I am concerned about the time it takes
to load the variables with values on startup as I anticipate having an

there a faster way to load the variables on startup other than reading from

These variables being arrays? Otherwise I see no need for Read.
if you know the format of the arrays (eg, starting address and size of
elements and type (eg 32 bit signed integer)) then you could do a CopyMem()
from some binary data that you load, or in fact load the binary data file
directly into the array. If you want just the one file, you would need to
use INCBIN and copy, or something similar if AMOS doesn't support it.

If you were feeling particularly cunning you could write a short program to
convert the Data statements into the data binary automatically, I can't see
that being too difficult.

It takes a long time to read data statements? What amiga are you using?!? ;)

Using the 'Data' statement is one of the quickest ways of storing variables, but
it is really not a good idea to use a lot of them as the compiler fails if there
are more then about 64k's worth.

What you should do is store all the data in a file instead. This is slower,
but it is better in other respects (for a start you can compile it if there's
more then 64k's worth) and it also means that it can be changed without
recompiling it (if you want to release updates etc.)


To store data in a file, first do:

open out 1,"filename"

do

trap read a (or a$, a#)

if errtrap
exit
end if
Print #1,a

loop

close
end


then delete the data statements and replace that with

open in 1,"filename"

repeat

input #1,a (or a$ etc)

array(x)=a

until Eof(1)

close



(PS. I just typed that into Yam, not sure it'd work...)


Hope that helps ;)

See ya :)

Yes, the majority of the variables are arrays. I did toy around with
the idea of using memory banks to store and read my data but found it a
very long winded way to go about it.

Hmm, it shouldn't be slow at all, I rekon it should be almost instant (well,
I suppose if you have lots of them and you haven't compiled it, then that could
take a little bit, but I still thing it'd be the fastest method...)

It's a bug in the compiler, I think that not using 'Data' is the only way
round it :(

An array in memory is a sequence of equally sized objects. For example a long
integer needs 4 bytes, so an array of 8 elements would take up 8*4 = 32 bytes.

Then instead of reading the 8 values from the Data statement, you can load 32
bytes of data from a file into the memory used by the array. To do this you
need to get the starting address of the array.

The easiest way to get the 32 byte file (in this example) would be to use the
first version of the program (with Data) to load the arrays, then save the
array data to disk.

This method is only likely to work with simple array types (integers and floats)
and almost certainly won't with arrays of strings.


Note:  I am more used to programming in E/C than AMOS, and these have quite low
level data types. AMOS arrays probably have extra checking on out of bounds
indexes etc, but the format of the array contents should be the same.

If one got sooo many statements, why not just create a screen with

YES, YES, YES!! Exactly!!
Binary, BINARY, B I N A R Y!!!
That is the way to go!! Go that way quickly!!!

Data statements in your program will be the fastest way.

But it is best to keep the data external from your code.
Easier to modify, can even create little data entry tool in AMOS to
update the data as needed.


Stay cool. :-)
