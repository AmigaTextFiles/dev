  This is a demonstration of AMTUITION, a library of AMOS procedures to
emulate the "look and feel" of Workbench 3.0 in AMOS applications.
AMTUITION works with both AMOS the Creator V1.36 and also AMOS Pro V1.x/
2.0, and makes your applications almost indistinguishable from "real"
Intuition applications - use AMTUITION until the official AMOS Intuition
upgrade appears!

Included in this archive is the demonstration and this textfile only;
the full AMTUITION distribution includes:

 o  Full set of AMTUITION WB3.0 emulation procedures (in sourcecode form)

 o  Comprehensive user guide, listing function and syntax of every procedure

 o  Sourcecode for this demonstration

 o  Nice icons :*)


This demonstration archive has been uploaded to Aminet FTP sites.

The demonstration opens a simulated "custom screen", and displays
a selection of gadgets, all of which perform an action when clicked upon.
 I haven't included any instructions because the program is so simple to
use!

The full AMTUITION system has procedures for:

   o Bevel (3D) boxes
   o Radio buttons
   o Listview boxes
   o Sliders (horizontal & vertical)
   o Palette boxes
   o Screen title bars
   o Windows (with optional gadgets & backfill)
   o a fully-featured asl.library-style file requester
     (moveable)
   o a fully featured font requester
   o a fully featured palette requester, offering the ability to set
     your application's colours whether you're using 4 colours or 64!

Note too that:
   o you don't have to use all the procedures- some are interdependant,
     but most are stand-alone.
 
   o programs written using AMTUITION can be distributed without
     paying any royalties to either myself or the CLR, provided that
     your programs are run-only (compiled)

Please let me know (at my Internet address above) of your opinions
(preferably favourable!) of AMTUITION.
  A lot of work (all my own) has gone into creating AMTUITION, and I believe
it's far superior to the competition (what competition? ;).

AMTUITION has been tested on the following AMIGA systems:

  A500/1.3/NFR  A500/1.3/ 0.5MB Chip + 0.5MB Fast  A500/2.04/NFR
  A500/2.04/0.5MB Chip + 0.5MB Fast
  A1200/3.0/NFR  A1200/3.0/2MB Chip + 4MB Fast/MC68881FPU
  A4000/3.0/4MB/80MB
