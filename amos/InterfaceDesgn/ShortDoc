To make the program run you must have all files included in one directory,
and make sure that you do a CD to the directory.
I will not explain how to use the program. You have to try and fail, that is
the best way to learn things.

.DAT files is the datafiles for the interfaces, and they makes it possible for
you to reload interfaces to the designer program if you want to change
something in them.

.AUI files contains the interface program, and you can merge it to your
sourcecode and put it into a string etc. You can also let it be on the
disk and use the interface_load_procedure to get it into your programs. 
 
Things that you maybe can do in future versions.

1. HyperText-zones
2. Make program connections between different zones.
   For example if you have a slider, you maybe want that it should change
   the startline in a ActiveList.
3. Link a zone to an AMOS-Procedure.
4. Have more control over the zone-properties.
5. Load your own Interface-bank and use it.
