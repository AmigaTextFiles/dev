What is ppACCESSORY ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well basically it is an AMOS Professional accessory which will allow you to
crunch and decrunch your source code including any memory banks that might 
be attached to them.

Make sure that you consult your USER GUIDE on how to install accessory 
programs within AMOS Professional as there are a few ways to do it.

@Node pp-2 "How to use ppACCESSORY"

Using ppACCESSORY is very simple now that I have combined both ppSAVE and
ppLOAD into one accessory that has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) which
makes it much more user friendly. Just point and click on the appropriate
button to crunch and save your current program, decrunch and load in a 
previously crunched program, or exit from the accessory all together. I 
have also included the following keyboard shortcuts:

- Press[S] to Crunch and Save your source code.
- Press[L] to Decrunch and Load your source code.
- Press[0-4] to set the crunching effeciency.
- Press[ESC] to Exit. You can also press the [ESC] key to abort any
  requesters that have buttons on them.

After selecting the crunch or decrunch button a file requester will appear
and at that point you can enter in the appropriate filename, making sure 
that it ends with the extension ".ppAMOS". Then ppACCESSORY will do it's
thing. Selecting the exit button will return you to the EDITOR. 

Before attempting to crunch your source code, ppACCESSORY will scan the
Editor for a program. If nothing is found, a requester will drop down
stating so and will abort the crunching process.

@Node pp-3 "How to change PowerPacker's effeciency.

Simple ... just click on the buttons labeled 0-4. The default setting is 
set at 0.

What does all those numbers mean ? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@{" 0 "} = Fast 
@{" 1 "} = Mediocre
@{" 2 "} = Good
@{" 3 "} = Very Good
@{" 4 "} = Best 

NOTE: When setting the effeciency to 4, the crunching process will be
~~~~~ very slow.
