@{u}Auto-handling@{uu}

The aim of this mode is to allow the user to make a mistake...

Under Intuition, when you click on a gadget, it is pushed and remain pushed
while you keep the mouse button pressed. Futhermore if you move the mouse
out of the button while continuing to press the mouse button, the gadget
come back to its initial state. At last if the mouse is removed under the
button, it is repushed.

In order to manage your buttons this way in AMOS, it's quite difficult, even
using the POWER Procedures. However the new auto-handling mode available for
nearly all the gadgets handles this auto-magically and returns only if the
button was eventualy pressed or not by the user. If it's a palette gadget
(@{"PW_COLOR" LINK "PW_COLOR"}) then the procedure returns the color selected
, idem for the radios buttons, ...

For you the only thing to do is to redefine a zone around the gadget, which
is quite easy with the global variables PW_XMIN, PW_YMIN, PW_XMAX, PW_YMAX,
then to call the procedure in the auto-handling mode when the user `start'
clicking on the gadget.
 
This mode is even available for the keyboard. The principle is slightly dif-
ferent : when the user press a defined key (put in the global variable PW_KEY)
the button is pushed and stay pushed while the key is pressed. However, if
the space bar is pressed simultanately, the button is unpushed.


@{u}Multi-string / Sub-string@{uu}

A multi-string is a simple string but containing some `|' characters delimi-
ting a certain number of sub-string.

    ex : A$="String 1|String 2|...|String N"

In order to recover the sub-strings, you can use the PW_PARSE procedure.


@{u}Global and local variables@{uu}

All the variables declared within a procedure work separately from the other
variables of your program. These variables are called local variables.

All the external  variables to the  procedures are  called global variables,
and are not affected by the operations within a procedure.

The `Shared' instruction permit to transform local variables of one procedu-
re into global variables.

The `Global' instruction permit to make some variables accessible everywhere
in your program, procedures included.

    If you don't have the courage to read the  documentation, you can launch
the demonstration which contain diverse examples of use for each  procedure.


    It's with a certain pleasure that I give you the result of long hours of
programming. In fact  I started to write this  procedures a  long  time ago,
firstly the standard button procedures for  the menu  of an utilities compi-
lation then considering the  ugly aspect of the  file requester of @{"AMOS" LINK "GLOSSARY" 9} (the
AMOS Pro one isn't  perfect at all)  I've got the idea  to rewrite some Gad-
tools gadgets in @{"AMOS" LINK "GLOSSARY" 9} to give a more professional look to my programs.


    Then I started to  analyse in  Deluxe Paint  the set of Gadtools gadgets
available and to convert  them in AMOS  with some `Polyline' and others ins-
tructions.  After I improved every  things with colours, different styles of
gadgets. At last I decided to  group all  this procedures  in an homogeneous
and complementary set (intelligent management of the colours palette, inter-
dependence of the procedures to  reduce their size, ...). Likewise the para-
meters  of the procedures  are organized in an  comprehensible and intuitive
way.

    ------------------
    Palette Management
    ------------------

    POWER Procedures use an original management for the palette.  Indeed, in
order that all  the gadget and frame procedures keep a good asppect indepen-
dently of  your palette  organization, you only have to  declare some
@{"global variables" LINK "GLOSSARY" 69} :


    PW_BLACK = Number of the black colour in the palette.
    
    PW_WHITE = Number of the white color.
    
    PW_BLUE = Number of the blue color.
              For the default color in the pushed state of the gadgets.
    
    PW_GREY = Number of the grey color.
              For the default color in the unpushed state of the gadgets.

    PW_GREY_DEEP = Number of the deep grey color.
                   Necessary for the Windows type gadgets.

    PW_GREY_LIGHT = Number of the light grey color.
                    Necessary for the Windows type gadgets.

    Other color variables are used by the PW_FLAG procedure.

    The @{"PW_COLORS" LINK "PW_COLORS"} procedure permit to easily modify the  color variables, to
save, load, print a  definition. I will even  be able to insert a definition
within your program in order to accelerate the input.

    If you open a screen within a  procedure, with different colors than the
main program, think to avoid  conflicts between  global color variables. For
that,  you can  simply type  at the  start of  the  procedure the  following
lines :

    PW_BLACK1=PW_BLACK
    PW_WHITE1=PW_WHITE
    .
    .
    .

    At  the end of  your procedure,  you only  have to  restore  the initial
values :


    PW_BLACK=PW_BLACK1
    PW_WHITE=PW_WHITE1
    .
    .
    .



    POWER Procedures are divided in several groups,  relatives to the parti-
cular type of procedures.


    ---------------------
    The Gadget Procedures
    ---------------------

    They permit to `draw'  simply onto the  screen the gadgets in the wanted
state (pushed or unpushed,  activated or ghosted) and at the  wanted graphic
position (xmin,ymin to xmax,ymax).  Then you  have to manage the  display of
your interface in function of the user actions.  The principle is quite sim-
ple :


    1 - Displaying of the interface in its initial position
    2 - Creation of an AMOS zone for each gadget
    3 - Waiting for an action of the user
    4 - Detection of the selected zone and indeed the selected gadget
    5 - Modification of the selected gadget state
    6 - Action relative to the gadget
    7 - Return to the 3rd step


    All  this may  seems  complicated  but with  some  practice, it is a lot
less compulsive that it could appear and a lot more simple that the AMOS Pro
interface system that uses graphic resources and an special programming lan-
gage.


    --------------------
    The Frame Procedures
    --------------------

    They permit to `draw' simply  onto the screen  different types of frames
in order to better structure your graphic interfaces. There is also a window
procedure that allow you to simulate a standard AmigaDOS window with a depth
gadget and a  close gadget. The use of this procedure  requires on the other
hand to define AMOS  zones around the depth and close gadget in the same way
that for the gadget procedures.


    ----------------------
    The Request Procedures
    ----------------------

    They permit to open a screen  with a request for  the user asking him to
enter a variable, to select one or several gadgets, in an automatic way. The
procedures even adapt them to the number of  gadgets and to the width of the
text ! In brief, once you will  have used them, you can't dispence  with. On
the other hand, they  souldn't replace  the  interface of your program, they
should only appear in punctual way. There is also a procedure which can dis-
play a Copyright request with the AMOS logo which is useful when you distri-
bute your compilated programs for example. You also have a Palette procedure
which will be very useful to allow the user to choose his palette for an ap-
plication.


    --------------------
    The Input Procedures
    --------------------

    They permit to replace  very advantageously  the AMOS's function `Input'
with a  version more  in the Gadtools style.  They permit to move within the
string (or number)  with key shortcuts,  to limit the  number of  characters
inputable, to  scroll the string  in a fixed  frame in order to input a long
string in a smaller frame,  also you  ask to draw  a standard Gadtools frame
around your gadget. The principle of use is :


    1 - Displaying of the interface in the initial state
    2 - Creation of a zone around each gadget including the input ones
    3 - Waiting an action from the user
    4 - Detection of the zone and therefore the gadget selected

    * - If it is a button gadget

    5 - Modification of the selected gadget
    6 - Action relative to the gadget
    7 - Return to 3rd step

    * - If it is an input gadget

    5 - Calling of the input procedure
    6 - Waiting of the input within the procedure
    7 - If a mouse click or a special key  (F1, ..., Return, Help, Esc, ...)
        the input procedure give back th hand to your program
    8 - Analysis of the user's action
    9 - Return to the phase 3 or 4


    ----------------------
    The Display Procedures
    ----------------------
 
    They permit to pass the time of the user  when your program is executing
a sorting action, a saving, a loading, ... There is  a gauge procedure which
permit when you dispose of a way to calculate  the progression of the opera-
tion, to indicate the evolution in a more friendly way. Otherwise there is a
text procedure which open a window with some explaining text.  The principle
of use is :


    1 - Calling of the displaying procedure with the type `Opening'
    2 - The procedure open a screen and initialize the gadgets
    3 - The program get back the hand and treat his action
    4 - Recall of the Gauge procedure with the type `Modification'
    5 - The procedure display the progression gauge in the indicated state
    6 - Return to the 3rd step until the end of the operation
    7 - Calling of the procedure in the state `Closing'
    8 - The procedure simply close the opened screen in the first step


    -------------------------------
    The String Treatment Procedures
    -------------------------------
    
    This are more current procedures in their using. They take the given pa-
rameters and  make an  operation over them and send  back the final variable
(Param$) after the treatment. Note well the @{"PW_PARSE" LINK "PW_PARSE"} procedure which will be
used in the request  procedures in order  to send an unlimited number of va-
riables  to a  procedure  in only  one parameter  string  which  is called a
@{"multi-string" LINK "GLOSSARY" 48}. The principle of use is  very simple because you only have to
separate the sub-strings with the `|' character. For example, the string :


    "String 1|String 2|...|String N"
     
     
    Will be interpreted by the @{"PW_PARSE" LINK "PW_PARSE"} procedure as :


    String n°1 : "String 1"
    String n°2 : "String 2"
    .
    .
    .
    String n°N : "String N"


    Interesting isn't it ?


    -------------------------------
    The Number Treatment Procedures
    -------------------------------

    Nothing particular to signal because the principle of use is the same as
for the string procedures.


    ---------------------
    The System Procedures
    ---------------------

    They permit to  get the date  or the time  of the internal  clock of the
Amiga. You only have to call  them and get back in  the variable Param$, the
current date or time in  the form "HH:MM:SC" and "DD/MM/YY".  For this, they
only make a little call to the Exec library of the Amiga.


    -----------------------------
    The Error Handling Procedures
    -----------------------------

    They permit  to your program  to intercept the errors or the pressing of
the keys `CTRL' + `C' in a more aestethic and friendly way. Moreover the gi-
ven choices depend on the way the program has been executed (in compiled mo-
de or in interpreted mode) to make use of the AMOS functions such as  `Resu-
me',  `Resume Next' or  `Resume Label'.  To use them  you simply have to put
this lines at the start of your program :


    On Error Proc PW_ERROR
    On Break Proc PW_BREAK


    Then the procedures  will do all  the work for you,  like displaying the
message corresponding the the error number !


    ----------------------
    The Sorting Procedures
    ----------------------

    They  permit to  sort a  string array  PW_SORT$() indexed  by the  array
PW_INDEX(), with various algorithms.

        @{b}---------
        Warning !
        ---------@{ub}
    
    Before you  run the demonstration, verify that you have  copied the file
Amos.library  in your  Libs:  directory !  This file  could be  found in the
System/ directory of the POWER Procedures.

    If you use the  @{"PW_ALERT" LINK "PW_ALERT"}  procedure  (or if a procedure use it) you must
reserve the screen n°7 for this one. You can only use this screen for tempo-
rary request !

    If you declare some global variables in your programs, they may conflict
with the simple variables of the POWER Procedurds. To prevent such things,
I recommend you to adopt a special rule for your global variables :

    - Add a prefix like `_' or `GV_' at the start of the variable's name.
    - Do not use the prefix `PW_' which is reserved to the POWER Procedures.

    
    In order to use the procedure @{"PW_COPYRIGHT" LINK "PW_COPYRIGHT"} :

    Copy the file :
     
        `Copyright_Sprite.Abk'
         
    in one of this directories :
   
        `AMOS:AMOS_System/' if you use @{"AMOS" LINK "GLOSSARY" 9}
        `AMOSPro_System:AP_System/' if you use @{"AMOS" LINK "GLOSSARY" 9}
        `PROGDIR:' if the program is compiled
    

    To use the procedures in your programs, you have several solutions :

    * If you use AMOS or AMOS Pro :

    - Include in each of your program all the procedures.

    - Include  only the  procedures needed by your  program remembering that
      some of them are interdependently.


    * If you use AMOS Pro:

    - Assign the directory containing the procedures with the name `POWER:'
      then use the command :
       
        `Include "POWER:POWER_?-??.AMOS'
         
      in your program.
 
    - However, the file will be loaded at each test of your program, which
      could be very long if you work with disks. There is a solution which
      consist to add those lines to your startup-sequence :      

        Assign "POWER:" "RAM:T/"
        Assign "POWER:" "DF0:POWER_Procedures/"  Add
        Copy "POWER:POWER_??-?.AMOS" "RAM:T/POWER_?-??.AMOS"

      Then, you wil only have to type the line :
    
         `Include "POWER:POWER_?-??.AMOS'
          
      in your program.

    In order that the procedure display the  right colors for the flags, you
    have to declare the following global variables :
        
        PW_BLUE_LIGHT   : Sky blue
        PW_RED          : Red
        PW_YELLOW       : Yellow
        PW_ORANGE       : Orange
        PW_GREEN        : Green
        PW_BROWN        : Brown

    You can use the  PW_COLORS procedure  to define this variables then save
    them in a file with the `Save' button and then insert it in your listing
    with the `Merge ASCII' command of the editor.
