Hello Amos users

I am a new member to list and have been reading with interest all the
mail I have recieved. I have used Amos for a couple of years now, and like
you all, enjoy the pleasure of coding in this language.

However, sometimes it can be frustrating as well. Especialy if you cant get
something to work, so I belive it is fantastic that I have stumbled onto this
group.

A project that I have been having some trouble with, is in developing a game like 
populous, powermonger or shepherd using an isometric land mass. I have tried to
do this a couple of ways (1. was to use icon,s stored in an array and 2. by using polygons
) but I just cant get it to work to well (I usualy can scroll one way accross the land
surface but cant then scroll in another direction.

So my question is, do you think it is posible to write this type of game in amos, and
if so does any one have any sugestions on how to do it ?

Thank you

Aaron Beagley

Hello there!
           I'm not on the great amos mailing list but if
someone could reply to my email address directly i would
be grateful. I need the following questions answered :-
-
1) Is there anyway to save an animation with music out as 
   an amos program if a user of a program entered the
   details?
-
2) How do you slow down the speed of an animation using amos?
-
3) Is there anyway of showing the anim frames in an amos program
   and adding things like samples to each frame and then being
   able to save the anim out with the samples in?
-
If you only know the answer to one question still tell me how i
can do it please!
So if anyone can help me with those questions email :-

Cool@DCandy.demon.co.uk

Thanks,
Chris Seward

Nice to see someone who appreciates the list the way you do. Now, to answer
your problem.

I have used the method I am about to explain for visual purposes, not for an
actual game. The POLYGON command is a good command to use, as you can get
lots of coloured shade onto the screen at a fast rate. Now, you will need to
create an array for that of a 3D object, and enter all the values for the
positions of the polygons, and also the height. Because the array is 3D, you
can create height etc. then when your routine comes to draw them, it can
detect the height changes and change the shade accordingly.

I have only ever used this in linear mode (so you see all the lines) and
rotated the shade round. In a game, you could shift the screen in one
direction, and call the array to drawer only the new part of the screen,
rather than all of it. This way, you save time and gain speed.

I think all us people on the mailing list should all congregate together on
an IRC channel. I figure on Efnet, using servers like irc.stealth.net and
irc.bt.net, irc.demon.co.uk and other servers for other countrys, could all
talk and discuss ideas on #AMOS once in a while.

I will be there tomorrow at midday USA time (5pm UK) and would like to see
other AMOS members there. Anyone have any comments about this?

No it is not simple enuf. You have misunderstood what I am trying to do.
I am trying to trick OS unfriendly games in to thinking that the mouse, or
key board is sending out signals, but in fact the singles will be coming
from the program I am trying to wright, but thank you for your effort any
ways.
 
>> Does any one now how to do this ?

>(see above)

No I don't know how to do this. I think that I will need 4 memory locations
The Mouse & Joy ports where the IO information first comes into the system.
The special key register (Ctrl,CapsLock,ShiftR&L,AltR&L,AmigaR&L).
The key board keyread ( 0 inactive 1 to 84 key presses)

>> Does any one now what pokes are in decimal (base 10)?

>Pardon ?  

Decimal or DEC or base 10 is the normal math we all use in are day to day
lives. I prefer to work in DEC as opposed to hexadecimal or HEX or base 16 
which according to some people is suppose to be closer to binary or BIN or
base 2 which is the native language of the machine (computer), but personally
I don't see it.

Aaron, and everyone else who replied to this, A populous style map is very
possible with isometric icons.
(I use paste bob though... am I missing something?) 

I have a test version with no detail (trees, houses, people) but you can
move the land up and down as in populous.

The speed problem can be overcome (depending on the machine) by having an
adjustable display size, so that if you want to see more, and dont mind the
speed drop of having to paste 144+ (12x12) bobs (icons) you can expand the visible
area of the map.

Anyone who wants the source in their mailbox (+ gfx) should reply to me
personally.

I did start a game in this style, but soon stopped. Even with a small grid,
it was too slow. Every time I scrolled, I had to redraw the screen (because
the land was hilly, so I couldn't just draw around the edges) and even though
I was using commands from the fastest extensions and was heavily optimised,
it was running at about 4-5fps. I was using icons for the landscape, but
polygons would be even slower.

If you are determined to do this, use the smallest grid possible, and if
possible, write some bits (the plotting code?) in assembler.

I had a similar speed problem in my platformer.  Due to the fact thay I 
used 64 EHB colors, icon plots plus bob plots plus collision detection 
was very slow.  I'm not sure how you can pull this off in your game, but 
I used Screen Copy to move the unchanged section and then I only had to 
put down the changed part.  If my character moved left, I scrolled the 
display to the right and then pasted down the left side icons.  In an 
isometric game that might be more difficult to pull off, but I'm sure 
there's a workaround.

Ah...  Good luck.  If it is an unfriendly, it is likely they will be
hardware hitting, and it is gonna be damn hard to get amos to intercept
signals and reroute them to the unfriendly program.  You are better off
'reprogramming' the game with a hex editor.  Ick.

I would be especially gratefull to receive the source and GFX. Please email
them to mpd@mushy-pd.demon.co.uk as I would like a faster way to do these
kind of maps, than the way I do them now.

HEX can be really handy if you're working alot with binary numbers, because
four bites can be represented by one hex-number. An example:
45 DEC = 0010 1101 BIN = 2D HEX
If you divide the binary number into groups with four bites each you get:
High part: 0010 BIN = 2 DEC = 2 HEX
Low part: 1101 BIN = 13 DEC = D HEX
Now you can just "add" the two parts together: 2D HEX.

In AMOS binary numbers are presented with "%" and hexnumbers with "$" so the
example above will be: 45 = %00101101 = $2D.

I hope this made some sense.

Stop pestering us with this. The AMOS commands BIN$ (convert decimal to
binary), HEX$ (convert decimal to hex) will solve half your problem. A=$FBCD :
Print A will convert hex to decimal.

The problem with external fonts is quite simple. They don't work with the
standard print commands.

You must use Text X,Y,String$ with any external fonts.

Well that's interesting ... I don't have the disk, but just after it was
released there was a bunch of messages, on this List I think, about the
features that were crippled, but I don't remember any more about it.  Anyone
know about this?

Ahh, now we have some sort of example, I see what you mean. I can do this,
so can most people. I can do it with 8 binary bits to a number between 0 and
255. I learned to do it on my spectrum instead of having thousands of DATA
BIN 11111111 lines, where you could simply enter 255.

To work out the value, the far left bit of the row has a value of 128, to
the right of that is 64, then 32, then 16, then 8, then 4, then 2, and the
far right bit should be 1. Notice how they half each time. Each bit which
has a value (or 1) you add the totals of what they represent together. Any
strings shorter than 8 characters, the far right bit is always 1.

I have an AMOS program which converts them to numbers if anyone is
interested. I wrote it when I was playing with cursor shapes.

Has anyone got any good inside information on creating my own 
extension for Amos.  I have a few commands and stuff that would 
benefit becoming an extension as loading them as a program with 
things like PLoad is becoming messy.  I am sure amos would benefit 
from some C2P routines and fast parallel port access!

This keyboard is fubar'd I am hammering these keys.  Never mind its 
only a PC I'me using.  The next use for this PC will probably be a

They are getting more servers daily. #AMOSlist will be a permanent channel

Cool! Im usually on IRC from 9am till 10pm here in the states (as local
calls are free) so it will be nice to be able to talk to other AMOS coders.

I hope there will be no messing around like the last AMOS channel I went on
(only one guy had ops along with his eggdrop bot, and noone else including
regulars) as this pisses me off.

I will be on #Peacefull with irc.stealth.net if anyone wants a chat.

Hello,

Old members of the list will remember me, as I have been on and off this list
twice already.

To newcomers:
I live in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. I just 'flunked' (if that is the right
term) a university study in computerlinguistics. That means that at the moment
I am jobless.

I use my Amiga for all kinds of stuff, I do not have a particular area of
interest.

Nowadays I use Amos mainly for prototyping my E programs. For instance, about
a month ago I made a utility that will convert text documents from the
Wordperfect 4.2 for DOS format to RTF 1.3.

There may be hope, yet. With a friend I started a (for fun) software company.
At the moment we concentrate on games. Possibly the Amiga versions will be
done in Amos.

I wrote a couple of articles about Amos, or software written in Amos, for
Amiga Magazine (Dutch). You can find a review in English of Grapical Adventure
Creator (GRAC) v.2 on the homepage below.

Speaking of homepages, I am having trouble loading the Mushy PD homepage
(http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/), using Aweb 1.2. The trouble is this: my
machine gurus. As Aweb will just refuse to load anything it thinks it cannot
handle, my guess is that a datatype is playing havoc. Has anyone encountered a
similar problem? Aweb and the datatypes it uses have been very stable until
this incident.

On the Extra`s disk, there are some .Include files and source on how the
existing music extensions were written. Im sure if you find them, the source
will be able to give you a good example on how to do it.

X-Status: 

If there is going to be an AMOS IRC channel online 24 hours a day (although
people wont always be on there) there must be a few rules to stop idioits
cocking it up!

Here is what I propose. Feel free to object against any!

1. There should be no moderator to the channel, what I mean is, the channel
is not the sole property of one particular person. We should all monitor
who comes onto the channel though, as takeovers will be emminent and     so
precautions must be taken.

2. No one member of the list will retain ops, nor his bot. All members of
the     list must be awarded ops in the channel, unless the list has decided
against someone being given ops, ie, is misusing the power.

3. Bans against any users can be given at any time, and ones against any
member of the list is not allowed unless for a reason.

4. The channel should never be made secret (otherwise people wont see us
in it) and topic protection must be turned on. Invite Only is *never* to be
activated unless for a reason.


Thats all I can think of for now. Feel free to add any you feel necessary.

Here's my question on the topic--is there a shareware/freeware Asm

to hunt down a commercial Assembler to make a lousy Extension, than 
forget it.

A couple of Q's

Theres a game I have been writing now for ages and no work on it has 
been done for quite some time this is due to one problem:-
In the code there is a line or two that goes something like this:-

NEWX=X-XOFFSET
NEWY=Y-YOFFSET
Paste Bob NEWX,NEWY,IMAGE

Where X and Y are the position of the thing and XOFFSET and YOFFSET 
are offsets to the middle of the bob.
Since pastebob doesnt take notice of hotspots the offsets are needed.
This works fine while running from Amos or Amos Pro but when compiled 
the offsets dont seem to effect the position so things are put on 
screen in the wrong place.  I have tried changing to Paste Icon but 
this has the same problem.  All the variables are within the main bit 
of the program and aren't passed to any procedures or anything.  
Whats wrong with it is beyond me!
Any ideas?

2.
Does anyone know how to retreve the address(and size)  in memory of 
where files stored in RAM: are.  The size of a file in the ram disc 
is easy enough its just getting the memory address of where its at.

Ta muchly for reading this.

I prefer a few permanent ops, not ops for every Tom, Dick and Harry. I have
IRC op status on elitenet, so whatever is decided can be set up.

Users of the list referring to POSTERS on the list, not all you damned

AWeb can guru if too mcuh comes in at once. How many links do you have it to

IRC is short for Inter Relay Chat. Its a program that allows you to chat to
user users on channels whilst you are online.

On the Amiga, the best IRC program to use is AmIRC, even though it uses the
dreaded MUI which most Amiga users seem to dislike. Its available from
Aminet, so download it now and get it set up. PC users should use a program
like mIRc or Pirch. mIRC is available from http://www.mirc.co.uk and can be
downloaded, and set up easily.

The next step is to get onto a server. The best servers to use (although
some people find others better) are irc.stealth.net, irc.bt.net,
irc.demon.co.uk, or one your provider recomemnds, but it must be an Efnet or
IRCnet server (not undernet), then you need to join channel #AMOSList. To do
this (all IRC clients have roughly the same language) type:

/JOIN #AMOSList

And you should be in there. Note that people will not always be on. So far,
only me, Giark, Asa and Skid have appeared that I know of. Im online all
day, and so you can probably find me there anytime.

Any more questions, dont be afraid to ask through the list, or therough
private Email.

Sounds like a good idea, but could you give some details on IRC's and
how to use them?  I know it's pretty basic stuff, but I've never come
across it before!  A couple of existing ones I could visit would be
nice, just to see what goes on.

Don't mean to sound dumb or anything, just interested!

That would be the 'dreaded' 'unpopular' MUI which is the most popular
amiga shareware program of all time in both number of free downloads and
number of registrations?

I can't see why people would dislike it anyway - It gives more
customisation and ease of use facilities than anything else I've seen
(Well, X is also confiugrable, but there is no GUI to do it), looks nice
and more importantly,
it is very easy to program and doesn't crash the whole machine when you
get a parameter slighty wrong (unlike intuition). I'd rate it better
than Microsoft Foundation Classes and X/Motif both of which I also code
with. For that matter try writting an MUI quality interface in AMOS....

X-Status: 

Dear All,
   I'm a newbie on this list, so please excuse any breaches of protocol.

   I have two questions that I hop the list can help me with.

   1.) I'd love to write using AMOS and MUI, (presumably using P.Hickman's
AMOS MUI routines) but have no idea exactly what nor how to install these
routines (I'm using AMOSPro 2.00, with the compiler, and not much else on an
'030 A1200). If it's not too much trouble,could you point me in the right
direction as to where to find information in regard this problem (I guess
there would've been a discussion on this group about
this when it was first published, so if you could give me the dates, I'd be
greatly appreciative).
   My second problem is to find out some more information regarding the
printer commands. Are these flaky? LPrint works fine (with the HP Deskjet 5L)
but Printer Send/Close has some bizarre limitations when trying to acces the
escape codes. 
   For example:

   Printer Open
      Printer Send "Greetings"+LF$
   Printer Close

works fine,
but
   A$="Greetings"
   Printer Open
      Printer Send A$+LF$
   Printer Close

doesn't work, nor does it work if the printer commands are embedded within a
Procedure.
   Can anyone help?


   Thanks in advance
   Rod

One day I might get round to putting some of my routines together in a
demoesque sort of way, if I can get some graphics and some music to
accompany it... any offers ;-)

The problem with producing demos in AMOS is that it defeats the real object
of demos which is to show the computers capabilites pushed to the limits
which AMOS, unfortunatly cannot really get very close to... I`ve seen the
demosprogs given away with the AMCAF extension and they were a good start,
I`ve done some nice effects using the blitter fill command in wierd
ways(see my web page, the downloadable AMOS source - "A sort of twirly mask
thing" :-)

Don't use these - they are a "proof of concept" to show it is possible
to use MUI from AMOS. Get my Easylife extension (also on aminet) which
contains better support for MUI, but it was written when MUI V2.3 was
the latest version so no MUI 3 features are supported directly.

As for the printer problems that really is bizarre.

No it doesn't. The only link with magic WB is the pallete used for the

No argument there - it is. It also consumes more CPU time to draw the
display. But then you get a lot of flexibility for that - e.g. All GUI
elements are resizable - you stretch the window the GUI resizes to cope
with no work from the programmer. Also you can write your own GUI
elements (e.g. A treeview) or sub-class the existing ones.

This is improving with V3.0+ but it isn't actually MUIs fault. As you
pointed out, MUI and AMOS are easy to program, but easy to mis-use. When
an MUI application is "dead to the world" it is because the programmer
did things the "quick-and-easy" way instead of the proper way.

He does. The MUI mailing list gets around 3-4 times as many messages as
day as the AMOS list, may of which get responses from Stefan. See
www.sasg.com for subscription details.

>In light of the above I would suggest the following:

This has been discussed on the MUI list. The problem is making the
applications already written work with it.

>-make it completely style-guide compliant
Not possible for the same reason. Also who's to stay the "style-guide"
is correct. Commodore wrote that for applications using the intuition
gadgets.
MUI uses its own gadgets which provide great features commodore were not
aware of when the write the guide.

>-build in ways to prevent bad programming practices
This would be like preventing AMOS users using the 'goto' command. Since
MUI is only the GUI tool, not the programming language, this is hard to
do.

>-always give the user feedback and try to always give the user the

MUI is very good at giving feedback IF the programmer tells it to. MUI
works mainly with callback functions. If the programmer writes code that
takes a long time to execute in a callback MUI appears to die. The
programmer should simply not use callbacks for operations that take some
time - an alternative is provided but is not as easy to use.

P.s. You can "escape" may MUI applications from the commodities exchange
or Arexx. Of course if they are in a loop in the programmers own code
then that won't work, but its the same with intutiton. Until you look to
see if any IDCMP close window messages have arrived, you program won't
quit.

Does anybody still code demos in AMOS?  I haven't seen one since the

Just thought I'd ask as I'm thinking of doing another one.

For those who want to do Extensions, I have recently figured out how.  
Here are a few things you need to know:

1. The Assembler-
    I found that ProAsm V1.92 works exceptionally well.  Its fast, 
efficent, and easy to use.  Its a big file and the guide sucks, but I'm 
coming to the fixes for that.

2. |Equ.s problems
    Francois, in all his wisdom, decided to screw up several of the 
comments in |Equ.s.  ProAsm will yell at you, saying something like 
"operand problem" or some other nonsense.  Let me put it this way:  If it 
doesn't look like Machine Language stuff (its usually in French, and on 
the right of the command), put an asterisk (*) in front of the stuff.  
Not the command itself, just the nonsense.

3. Why ProAsm and not some others?
    ProAsm handles one thing most Asm compilers (like my original, 
PhxAss) didn't...dividing addresses.  Those lines with (L1-L0)/2 made 
PhxAss go nuts.  Also, Francois, in all his wisdom, decided to make 
labels non-case sensitive, which ProAsm handles too.

4. Token List problems
    Any assembler will yell at you if you try to put a Word on an odd 
address.  Words are two bytes long, and have to go on even addresses, and 
this comes to be a problem with ProAsm.  After each command token, put an 
Even so the compiler word-aligns the next part.

5. Returning function values
    I completely missed this the first time.  The result goes in d3, and 
the type (0 for int, 1 for float, 2 for string) goes in d2.

That's all I can think of right now.  If anyone wants to try out my 
very-fast extension, mainly for reading and writing memory structures and 
memory maps (like TAME), just write me.  It isn't too big...yet.

Well, actually, you can build up all the GUIs without the specific  MagicWB
colours.  Sure, when using different colours, you normally can't use all of
the defaults and preset stuff, but it works totally without MagicWB.

So what? Once it is loaded it doesn't much more memory. It's more the other
way  round:  MUI applications don't need their custom code for the GUIs and
are therefore much smaller.

> MUI oozes a Microsoft-feel from its pores.

Ah nah! That's a silly argument! You can't blame Stunzi for creating
GUI-features that other OS have (or implementing features of AmigaOS which
are not that much used normally).

MUI is far superior to all the MicroSoft GUIs... I don't know HOW you come
to get a Microsoft-feel from MUI...

Ahyes. The author of Aweb, the only browser that does not use MUI. That
should give you something to think.

You mean the GUI having stopped to react. Well, this is not exactly the
fault of MUI but of the way an application is programmed. You can program
some kind of workaround if you really need the gui alife during some
busy-action.

If you mean something other than this by 'dead to the world' it is pretty
wrong.

I *was* a MUI hater some time ago. But once you get to use it more often
and see all the advances it has, you have to love it ;)

You cannot do this with normal applications, so why should you be able to
do this with MUI-Applications?

Cool. Send me a copy of any Demo`s that you put together. Demo`s are not
always set on showing off the capabilities of the Amiga, but to see how far
you can stretch the language you program in!!

Greetings.

Does anyone know where I could locate a copy of (at least) the 
shareware version (I think it was shareware) of the AMCAF Extension? 
I am interested in using it. It seems to have been removed from or 
hidden in Aminet. I actually downloaded it once and never used it so 
I deleted it. Oops. Thanks again.

Which is the best Intuition extension for Amos please? I have Intos
which I found a pain to use - Andy Church's Intuition Ext which I appear
to have palette problems with and some Dialog procs written in Intuition
style.

Perhaps if I explained what I require it may help.

I have, over the past eighteen months, written some software in Amos for
use with Video. I won't explain the full working details as without some
fairly extensive video editing knowledge, it won't mean anything.
Suffice to say that, having written the software, I don't want to have
to re-write everything to use intuition screens BUT I wish to use
Intuition requesters etc on an existing Amos screen.

Anyone help please?

Cheers,

Geoff.

An interesting problem. AFAIK there is no Intuition extension that will
allow you to get Intuition requesters on an Amos screen. So I guess you
are stuck with the Intuition like extension (which is not necessarily a
bad thing). I would love to be proved wrong though.

Have a quick look at:
dev/amos/amtudemo.lha 
	but I don't know if it's still supported.  Not 'real' intuition, but
a reasonable facsimile.  And there is no extension that alllows that sorta
thing.  Ya gotta simulate under amos.  Fortunately, thats not difficult.

Hello i am new to the list.
I am currently working on version two of my bird-watching database
imaginatively titled BirdBase2. I am using J-Windows for the interfacre
and am having no end of problems.
Any contact with anyone who has used J-Windows would be very helpful.
The problems i am currently trying to solve are:
Detecting gadget shortcuts (I can do the code to highlight the letter
which is the shortcut but i can`t get it to work when you press the key)
Getting AmigaGuide to open on my screen.
Deleting records (relational database causing all sorts of problems with
linking to other tables. Currently i am trying to use the first array as a
record number but if you use arrays to identify a record it doesn`t use
the number i`ve defined but the number of the array
, if you see what i mean?)

Any help would be much appreciated, i never imagined how difficult
programming intuition would be! Cheers

It isn't possible! The Amos screens aren't a standard Intuition screens, and
so you can't use the intuition requesters etc. In this case the best solution
is to emulate intuition.... there are several set of ready-made procedures
on Aminet... try them :)

     First off, I would like to SUBSCRIBE to your mailing list.  It is a 
     great relief to be able to find some place where I can get more AMOS 
     information!  Please subscribe me to the following address, NOT the 
     one that you received this email from.  I am sending this from work 
     and do not want the mailing list stuff to go here!!!  The SUBSCRIBE 
     address is:
     
                random@flash.net
     
     Second, I have a problem that is driving me crazy.  If you could send 
     me an answer, or post this to the mailing list (or both) I would 
     appreciate it.
     
     I purchased an A3000 back in 1990 when they first came out.  As you 
     know, these first machines did not have Kickstart in ROM, rather they 
     booted it from a partition on the hard drive.  Up until last year, I 
     was running KS 2.04 from the hard disk, and workbench 2.10.  
     Everything was fine.  I have been using AMOS for more years than I can 
     remember.  Currently I have V1.12 of AMOS Pro, and the AMOS Pro 
     Compiler (not sure right off hand what version).  I have been unable 
     to find an upgrade to AMOS Pro, although I know that it reached 
     version 2.0 before support was dropped.
     
     Last year I decided to upgrade my system to the 3.1 ROMs, both so I 
     could get datatype support, enabling me to run web browser software, 
     and for an eventual accellerator upgrade.  All the software I have 
     written in AMOS has been in hires interlace.  This is because I have 
     an A3000 and it comes equipped with a hardware deinterlacer.  When I 
     upgraded to the 3.1 chipset, all my software "broke".  When I try to 
     run any AMOS code in hires interlace (including the AMOS editor 
     itself), I get a very bad interlace flicker.  Actually it is more like 
     a jitter.  It is so bad that I cannot read what is on the screen.  If 
     I turn off the hardware deinterlacer, the entire screen breaks up.
     
     The main application I have in AMOS is a gaming aid I wrote for a game 
     called Star Fleet Battles.  SFB is a hex-grid simulation of tactical 
     starship combat based on the Star Trek universe.  The software does 
     not play the game, rather it aids in the bookkeeping involved with 
     playing the game.  This software has been evolving since 1978 when I 
     coded a VERY rudimentry form of it on a TRS-80 model I Level I with 
     4Kb RAM.  In its current form, it spans over 700 Kb of documented 
     code, including auxillary programs but not including data files.  The 
     current version is fully point and click (with the exception of 
     entering the names of the ships), and tracks all combat, movement, and 
     damage allocation.  I REALLY do not want to go back and recode this 
     for hires noninterlace.  Not only would it be a pain, nor do I have 
     the time, but I can't get as much on the screen in noninterlace.  I do 
     not play the game much myself anymore, but my kids want to learn.  It 
     is much easier to play with the program than without it.  BTW, AMOS 
     Pro seems to work OK in hires noninterlace on my A3000.  I also have 
     other software with the same problem, namely a DM helper program I was 
     writing for my kids (who are very impatient for me to finish).
     
     My A3000 is configured as follows:   A3000, 16 MHz, 2Mb Chip, 8 Mb 
     fast (although the problem also occurred when I only had 4 Mb fast), 
     540 Mb HD, VGA monitor.
     
     I would appreciate any information I can get on this problem.  Is this 
     a known problem?  Is there a known fix?  Will it go away if I upgrade 
     to AMOS Pro 2.0?  Where can I get AMOS Pro 2.0!!???  Does this happen 
     on AGA machines running 3.0?  (I am thinking of getting my oldest 
     daughter a 1200 for her birthday.)  Is anyone thinking of picking up 
     support for AMOS?  What would that take?  With the machine back in 
     production (hopefully on a more permanent basis), AMOS would make a 
     very nice language to bundle with it.  The other packages (the 
     compiler, AMOS Pro, AMOS Pro compiler, AMOS 3D, etc) would make very 
     nice upgrades!  Seems like there ought to be a market...
     
     
     Thank you very much for your help.

Hi Branco and John,

F1 sells the Compiler ... he tried to get rights to the Pro but failed.

The e-address I have for him is:

steve@F1LW.demon.co.uk

The digit after the F is a "one".

BFN,

That is not good. Not good at all.

[snip: the problem is that with the new 3.1 ROMs installed in John's A3000,
the flicker fixer will not work].

If you have the Pro Compiler, you already have got the upgrade to 
Amos Pro 2.0.

You can open hires, laced screens on AGA machines, but as they do 
not have an in-built flicker fixer, you are still stuck with the 
same problem.

I believe this is in the FAQ, which can be downloaded from Aminet, 
or ordered from Michael.

Have you got any news, or don't you know yet that the current

Well, if I am correct Steve Bye of Formula One Licenceware is 
still selling Amos Pro. I do not have his email address handy, but 
the last snail mail address I have is:

  F1 Licenceware
  31 Wellington Road
  Exeter
  Devon
  EX2 9DU
  United Kingdom

By the way, a very good resource for all kinds of Amos related 
problems (and their solutions, off course), is the collection of 
all mails send to and from this list, which can be found at 
Aminet:dev/amos/.

This is a problem of compatibility between AMOS and WB3. There is no fix that
I know of, but here's a workaround for you.
Screen Open 1,640,400,16,Hires
Screen Offset 1,0,0

This opens a non interlace screen that can SCROLL to show more info. You can
sense the mouse location and, when it gets to the top or bottom scan line,
scroll the screen up or down with Screen Offset 1,0,Y. This will allow you to
view the full screen without hving to rewrite any code. You'll just have to
add a screen scroll procedure to the existing interface.

Are you trying to compile with an extension command that is shareware? Some
demo versions are set so that they won't compile.

Hi there.

Has anybody had any trouble getting the compiler to, er, compile on an
A1200 running WB3.1.  I've got plenty of HD space and plenty of RAM, it
just locks half way through compiling.  I've tried several different
programs, but none of them work.

Any ideas?

Rob/TVG.

This is a known problem with the 3.1 chipset.  Unfortunately, no real fix
exists.  You can simulate a interlace screen with scrolling, but thats a bit
nasty.

Not AFAIK on 3.0, but 3.1 is a problem.  It is NOT a problem with AGA, but
with the ROM chips inparticular.  Amos does some very OS unfriendly things.

that still talk about it.

Regrettably, due to the lack of AGA (or greater) support under amos, it
isn't a good thing to bundle with the new machines.  Amos is, however, ideal
for coding stuff on older machines that you want to run on all amigas.  It
is a shame there is little that can be done about the interlace problem, or
the hard coding of 6 bitplanes, and all that.

Sounds like you have your amos version improperly upgraded.  Which amos
version are you using, and which amos compiler ?  At a guess, I'd suggest
re-installing your amos and compiler to see if it still happpens.  You
should have no real problems on a 1200 & 3.1, apart from the interlace
problem mentioned in many other messages around now.

No, but thanks anyway.  I just tried it on my A500 (after getting it out
of the loft!) and it worked fine.  Kind of solved the problem that, but
it would be nice to get it working on my 1200.

Any other ideas anybody?

Rob.

	I had an idea about this one.  I think you can push AMOSPro into
AGA without any extensions at all.  This, however, would be tricky to
code, as I know very little about the copper, someone out there, who is a
better programmer than I, should try this.  If it works, post the code
somewhere.

	Set up tow screens.  The total number of bitplanes should not
exceed 8, thus you could have a '5' and a '3' or two four bit plane
screens.  Once you have dones this, you have to change the copper, adding
the second screens bitplanes to the first, with the high BPLxPTL/H 
registers.  Thus, on a six bit plane screen (64 colour), tou would add
screen two's first bitplane address to BPL6PTL/H and the second to
BPL7PTL/H.  Then you'd have to enable the higher bit planes, by adjusting
BPLCON0, setting bits 12-14.  True, this would not be a true 256 colour
screen, but you could create some awesome effects (such as translucent
clouds) with the extra colours.  Also, AMOS should be able to draw to both
screens, and you can still do all the scrolling you want.

	The second idea, is to marginally extend AMOS, from using EHB to
real 64 colour mode.  I think this would easyily be accomplished by adding
the instrucion into the copper to sett the KILLEHN bit (9) in BPLCON2.
Then accessing the second palette set.

	Of course, to both these ideas, a way of accessing the new palette
registers is essential.  This is relatively easy.  A procedure could be
called, instead of the basic Colour and Palette commands.  They would
first set the 13-15 bits in BPLCON3 to change the bank number.  Then set
the RGB high bits.  Then set LOCT bit (9) in BLPCON3 to change the RGB low
bits.  Voila, you can now change the other 214 colours.

	Here is the first installment of my AGA AMOS.  These are all just
procedures, so you don't have to install anything special.  You do require
the AMOSPro.lib patch to be installed, which lets AMOSPro muck around with
the copper.  Here's the code.  Just throw it in RAM and merge it into AMOS,
and have fun.  If someone needs the patch, I can email the AMOS code.  If
enough people want, I can redo this without the patch, by building the
copper, but I would prefer not to...

  Hi! I'm a crazy Norwegian of the  same  vintage as Ernie's DeSoto. I have
been into home computing since  the  early  eighties,  and had an Amiga for
about half that time. In the  beginning  I programmed a bit in Amiga Basic,
but after Amiga Format  released  Amos  on  a coverdisk AND started selling
manuals I became a convert. (Actually I'm  using the version that came with
some other magazine a bit  later,  which  is  version 1.35 and includes the
compiler. I've got Pro  installed  too,  but  don't use it much - the plain
version is complicated enough, and I don't have the manual either...)

  Some of my programming projects are  a  bit specialized, such as a set of
programs for mapping the PBM game  Quest  (check www.crasiworld.com for de-
tails - details about the  game,  that  is,  not about my programs!), but I
also do things of (I hope...) more general interest. A couple of years back
I got involved with some  other  amigites  who  were trying to start a demo
group, and actually managed to put  out  a  slide show before the group got
disbanded for administrative reasons. The main program was written by me in
Amos. I even compiled it, but curiously enough it would not run after being
compressed (with PowerPacker),  so  the  version  that was finally released
took up quite a bit of space on the disk...
  That is about the only thing (of general  interest) that is finished, but
I've got some more or less finished stuff that may be of interest too. Just
before I started writing this, I worked  a bit on the documentation (?) for
a project that's been around for a long time. One of the first (!) things I
did with my first computer (an Apple ][)  after I had learned a bit of pro-
gramming was to write a small text adventure  in Basic. When I got my first
Amiga it didn't take long before I  had  translated  it to Amiga Basic, and
the last step so far is to  convert  the  whole  thing to Amos and add some
whistles and bells. (No, I don't mean it's  got sound!). I've been thinking
a bit about beta testing it to  find  the  last  bug (?) and get some fresh
comments and ideas, in fact I  sent  copies  to  a couple of members of the
aforementioned group, but  they  apparently  didn't  know  what "beta test"
means, so the only comment I got was "nice  game, you ought to finish it!".
Sigh.
  Then there's the Cheshire Effect,  which  is my name for a new (?) way of
making things invisible. I made a  simple  picture  and a program to demon-
strate it, but it could  definitely  use  some  better graphics (preferably
animation). If there are any  great  artists  who  are particularly good at
drawing cats in motion, get in touch!

  So where can all these things be found on the net? Unfortunately, nowhere
yet. At the time being I only have web  access through a public terminal at
the local library, running  Netscape  1.  I  know the program has an Upload
File function somewhere in  the  menu,  but  haven't checked it out on this
version yet. And the last time I was on Aminet I couldn't even get into the
directory where the help files say new things should be uploaded...
  I also have limited time to experiment each day, so could someone tell me
exactly how and where to upload  files  with NS1 (to Aminet and less public
places)?

  Time for some comments. I downloaded some archive files with old messages
from this list, and in one of them I found  a function called OpenFont. How
is this supposed to work? (When I try it, it doesn't do anything except for
cough up an error message when  it  doesn't  find  a file... And I tried it
both in Pro and 1.35)
  Talking of fonts and things that don't  work, the manual seems to suggest
that you can use different fonts  in  different  windows,  but does not say
how. The Open Window (or whatever, I can't find the manual right now) seems
to take a parameter called "set", and I  have experimented a bit with this,
but all I have found out is that if "set"  is not zero, I get a weird error
message...
  I hope someone has any hints about  either  this  or OpenFont - having to
load all my font definitions to access one or two of them by number doesn't
really sound impressive...
  Speaking (okay, typing!) of that, there have been some reports about run-
ning out of memory and such when using  lots of fonts. I have found that if
I run a program using Get  Fonts  (such  as  the demos in Manual/Chapter_8)
more than once [that is, I run the program more than once, it only contains
one Get Fonts command!], the font  definitions  from  the previous run will
some times (but not always) stay in memory and get counted as ROM fonts the
second time (in addition to getting REloaded as "Disc" (sic) fonts.). Notto
mention that if I change the Fonts:  assignment  between  runs, all the old
fonts stay active too! Seems like  a  Clear  Font(s)  command  or something
would be a good idea...
  If you get a chance to look at the  slideshow  program  I mentioned above
you may wonder how I got that special font  in the intermission message and
end credits. (There's no font file on the  disk.) Well, when I realised the
default.font file is actually imbedded  in the executable, I wrote a little
program that loads the program  into  a  bank,finds  the font definition by
searching for the sequence at the  start,  and replaces it with a different
one (created with Font_Convert)  before  resaving  the contents of the bank
under a different name. It was easier than  using Config to change the font
and then use it while compiling and change it back afterwards...
  Which may be a suitable transition to the next subject. Does the compiler
include ALL system files and active  extensions  (including those not used)
in a compiled program?  Including  the  COMPILER?  How do you say "waste of
space" in French? :-/

  A bit more general comments. Can people  who reply to messages please try
to use a few seconds to edit the quoted  parts rather than quote the entire
message? At least delete the first writer's signature...
  I also got a couple  of  "unsubscribe"  messages  through the list. Looks
like no mailing lists can avoid misdirected server messages, but I had sort
of expected them to be a bit scarcer in a list devoted to programming!

  The last batch of messages I brought  home  from  the library contained a
couple of remarks about MUI. A bit sidetracked, but... I've got one program
that uses it (an offline browser I got to make it easier to experiment with
HTML so I wouldn't have to take my  experimental  files  to the library and
back every time I made a change  and  wanted  to  test it), and I think I'd
better keep to myself what I thought when  I realised that I had to locate,
download and install this big  package  just to make that one program work.
Okay, it makes  programs  smaller,  but  what's  the  point  with driving a
smaller car if you need a  big  trailer  to  carry the stuff that won't fit
into your car? MUI and similar packages are like libraries - very useful if
you have a lot of programs that use them, but a nuisance if you only have a
few. (The breakpoint is of course  where  the total size of the library and
the programs using it equals the size the  programs would have been if they
didn't use libraries.) And the most useful  are of course the ones included
with the operating system as a standard.

  This is getting long (Oh, you  noticed...),  but  I might as well mention
That Other Project as well.  A  couple  of  years  back I got in touch with
another amigite who  was  planning  to  make  a  graphic adventure game and
needed a bit of help with the plot.  After  we had been working on it for a
while and replaced most of the  original  plot with my own machinations, he
started studying, which meant he had to get rid of his Amiga and get one of
those other boxes. (Sigh) He  wantedto  drop  the project completely, but I
persuaded him to let me take over  (it  was  mostly mine anyway) and try to
find some other collaborators to get it  finished. So far I've got a lot of
ideas written down, some of them actually connected with each other ;-) and 
I'm looking for
1) a better  programmer  than  myself,  maybe  two  or three. (The game was
originally supposed to be programmed  in  Amos  Pro, but if there's someone
out there who can do great work in a different language that's okay too (as
long as I don't have to do it :-)))
2) someone who can turn out a lot of  great  graphics  (including some ani-
mation) in a reasonable time.
3) more great ideas to fill  the  holes  that  still  exist in the plot and
background.
4) someone with a great sence of logic  (and weirdness) who can put all the
parts together and make it work (may be identical to 1).
5) someone who can write great  dialog,  preferably  in one or more compre-
hensible English dialect(s). [In a weak moment I decided that the hero, who 
dreams about becoming a writer, "talks  like a book", whatever that is sup-
posed to mean...]

  It's getting late, and in case anyone is  wondering I'm typing this on my
Amiga back home (using a word processor,  thence the straight margins), and
tomorrow I'm taking a formatted text file version of this to the library to
try to find a way to get it into an  emailbox.  Wish  me lu... No, wait, if
you read this it means I have already succeeded!  (Fades muttering into the
distance.)

There is a very powerful extension, the AmosPro GUI extension, that
allows you to use an Intuition interface build with GadToolBox.
You can find both of them on Aminet, in dev/amos and dev/..? i don't
remember, use the aminet search tool.
This will not allow you to open an intuition requester on an AmosPro
screen, but i think you could reuse a large section of the amos code
should you decide to rewrite the program using the gui extension.

Bye,

Hey you all...
A little while back I read some mail about an Amos IRC channel...
I've gone to it several times <#amoslist@shell.golden.net> and noone's ever
there. What gives? I'm just curious, because you know I'm new to amos, so I
got lotz of questions and I'm sure MUSH is getting pretty tired of me always
coming to him for guidance.. So let me know what's going down with the IRC
thing , ok? Have fun coding, you crazy amos people you. :)
Long Live Amiga!!!

i've loaded in an animation and say it's not the right type
i've got it so my program brings up an error message, then
when i use the resume command it doesn't resume it so then
every file thats loaded in is classed as the wrong sort even
if it is the right sort. Can anyone enlighten me on this and
if you can but need to look at my source get in touch pppllleeaasse
i need help badly :(.
  Also i've always wanted to write a Operation wolf game but no

i've never known where to start, does any one have any source
for a simple move the target and shoot things game or can any
one write me some short code, if anyone can i'd be very, very
grateful :)
 One last thing i've wrote a nice pong game, but i only have

 Well if you can help in any of these topics please email me

Ello,
    I've just finished a small project, It's a program that logs
everytime your computer is booted up. It goes in the user-startup
or startup-sequence and doesn't interfere with anything else
and your HD boots up normally. It's wrote in amos and if anyone
would like it please email me i'm sure i can give it to anyone
who wants it. It's useful if you've got someone who is using
your computer without you knowing. And its only 8k!!!!

	For my next feat, I'm going to push a little harder.  This was a
simple "trick" since AMOS can already handle 64 colours.  All that was
necisary was to disable EHB and play with the higher colours.  I have
encountered two things that I CANNOT DO IN AMOS!

	1.) Nothing more than 16 colours in Hires.  To do so, you must
double the CAS or bus to 32-bits.  This requires that the memory addresses
for screens be word aligned.  I randomly allocated 100 screens, and none
of them hit a word boundary.  They were always 8, 24, 40 or 56 bit off
(weird...).  It would be nice, if there was a patch (I'm going through the
m.l. right now, trying to find it...), it would be nice, since x2 CAS and
32-bit access speeds AMOS by 25% on all graphics operations!

	2.) No "real" 256 colour mode.  Since to do so, I would have to
rewrite all the drawing code (I don't want to).  AMOS was designed to
handle no more than six bit planes.  If #1 weren't true, we could easily
have up to a 64 colour hires screen (nice!).  However, with the code I'll
be releasing, you could do a 256 colour game, just not the same way.

	Deah.  I'll be back, after this message from nobody..

	I don't know if anyone care, but here are the particulars about
the procedures I'll be making.  They would be very easy to port to asm,
and I may be tempted to do so, if I get enough response.  Are there enough
AMOS coders left to need this?

	What follows, is not code, but a description of how they WILL
work.  I'm still working on it, and am hitting little hick ups along the
road (like AMOS's copper changing register's that didn't exist in OCS
days...).

_LAYERS[NUM_PLANES,OLD_SCREEN]

	This procedure will open a second screen "over" the first.  By
changing some of the AGA registers, the new screen will act as extra bit
planes on the lower layer.  By drawing to the screens seperately, you can
use this to create 256 colour programs, or translucent effects, or dual
playfields.  It all depends upon the allocation of the colour registers
(see below).
	The new screen will technically be one less colour than normal
(thus an opened 16 colour screen will only have 15 colours, one being
transparent to the old screen, always.)

_COLOUR[INDEX,VALUE]

	This will directly change any of the 256 colour registers.  I
_MAY_ add 24-bit, but I don't know if its all that necisary...

_EXTEND[NUM_PLANES,OLD_SCREEN,Varptr(PALETTE())]

	This one's nice.  You have the palette of the old screen (for
example, 32 colour screen).  This procedure will copy the palette into the
high registers, based upon the number of planes on the layer.  If the
layers were three more, than the 32 colour palette would be copied eight
times.  Each time, the colours will be blended by the second palette, to
create new colours.  The array contains 16-bit numbers, RGBA (A=alpha), or
32-bit if I want.
	If the 'A' was set to zero, then a dual playfield is made, since
none of the old colours will show though.  If the 'A' was 50% (or some
variable amount), then it's translucent, so awesome fog and cloud effects
can be made.  Cross fades are a snap now!

_FADE[SPEED,DEST_COLOUR]

	Similar to AMOS.  This fades the screen to the specified colour.
The fade occurs on all 256 registers.  I doubt I will make a Fade In
command.

	All the normal drawing functions will work.  For example, if you
have made a screen of four colours, all white, with 25%, 50% and 75%
translucently, all you have to do is make a normal AMOS bob with these
colours.  Specify the screen and put them on, and voila, you have a
translucent cloud.  Interlacing and dithering makes fore some wickedly
smooth effects.  Blitz users, eat your hears out!  I may add more
procedures, but let me debud these fully first.

	TTFN

	Deah.

I think that it is much easier to use your extension, 'cause Amos seems to
reroute all intuition requesters that should be opened by it's
applications to his own kind of requesters, opened on amos screen - e.g. 
known-to-everyone 'Disk is write protected' requester. Now, it works 
perfectly with your GadTools extension, only it can't have more than two 
gadgets.

Greetings.

I've been considering for some time investing in a new Cybergfx (or 
of the sort) graphics card for my Amiga. I thought before I went 
surfing the Net for good deals, I would inquire around the list as to 
anyone who might help me here.

I'm looking for, like I said, either a Cybergfx or PicassoII (or 
whatever you might recommend), with an AGA chipset (of course) in new 
or used (good) condition. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer for 
whatever you can offer me.

I'm still programming on an ECS Amiga (AHH!), A3000 to be exact, and 
I thought that it's about time to upgrade.

Obviously, since there are no AGA emulators out there now that I 
know of that aren't a gag or a fake, and also since an emulator 
wouldn't compile or work as well as the real thing (even though it 
would be nice to have an emulator that worked just to run AGA 
programs on), I thought I would invest in a gfx card.

If anyone can help me in this area, please mail me. I would be 
grateful to anyone that could lend me information on locating a 
graphics card for my program development. Thanks again!

Long live the Amiga!

Can anyone suggest why this is happening.  And possibly a solution to

Hello Everyone!!!,
	First of all lets start of with a bit of background info, I have been 
programming in AMOS Pro for quite some time, after starting on AMOS 1.3 with 
the AMOS 3D extension, which I obtained of an Amiga Magazine coverdisk, to my 
delight I am recently informed that there is a way to make AMOS 3D work with 
AMOS Pro, so I excitedly install AMOS 3D on AMOS Pro when to my great upset 
and HORROR!!!! do I find out that my copy of the AMOS 3D Modelling Kit has 
messed up and won't work, so I can now manipulate objects on AMOS Pro but not 
create new ones and as you may comprehend this is causing me a great 
inconvieniance.

	So I am begging you now anyone who reads this post and has a copy of the AMOS 
3D Modelling Kit please please please please please please please please 
please please please please please please please please please please please 
please please E-mail me and inform me of it.

		Yours Hopefully, Gratefully, and P**sed Offily

A lot has been said on AGA Amos lately, the general opinion that it would
take a re-write (without the source) and is not worth trying.

What IS it worth? If you are capable of such a feat, either a 100% working
AGA extension, or a total AGA re-write, how long would you estimate, and
how much would you need to do it?  (in US dollars)

Not that I use one, but what about a usable PC version instead of 'Klik
and Pray'?? :O

Hello everyone.

For a couple of weeks ago I bought Stephen Hills excellent book AGMM.
I soon realized that many of the books examples was refeering to a
diskette that obvious was intended to follow with the book.

I suppose that the diskette just doesn't exsist anymore because the book
is from 92. My question is if someone else on this list with the book is
in possesion of the diskette, and perhaps could be so kind and send me
it through email?

Many thanks in advance!

Hi again..

I know that several(?) attempt to contact Europress software about buing the
sourcecode to Amos has been tried by your guys. But what was the reason Europress
was given to refused selling the code??

A bit sad to know that the future development of amos is forever stopped
because Europress is so stubborn in this question :(

I dont see why Europress wont give up the code. Its a damn good example of a
piece of code which can be DRASTICALLY improved, as im sure a lot more Amiga
users would turn there heads and look at it if was improved.

All we independant programmers can do for now is program extensions, which
is alright, but still not good enough. One day the code will be released,
and a good AGA version, with all kinds of support (including a load of OS
commands to make it a lot more powerful like Blitz) including a hell of a
lot faster process time.

Keep waiting. I will.

Andy Kellett

P.S. Im looking for people to test my phonebook program. Ive made a load of
changes, and need some BetaTesters. Gimme a bell!

Hi all.
I'm new to this list (didn't even know it existed until I saw it on a   
CUCD!) so the question that I am about to ask will probably already have   
been answered...
Looking through the CD, someone asked a question about getting Amos to   
run in DblPal screens but unfortunately, his question wasn't answered in   
the section included on the CD.

I would be very interested in finding out as I have a VGA monitor   
attached to my 'miggy' ruling out normal Pal.

Thanks in advance,

Michael...  (how many people are on this list approx.?)

Hmm. I always prefer to write my own engines, as the ones you can "Buy"

Hi there! If I remember rightly, it was me who asked about getting it to run
in DblPAL/DblNTSc mode, as I had moved to USA and wanted to program AMOS on
my girlfriends PC monitor.

The only conclusion I could find is that it is impossible. I tried every one
of the hacks which are supposed to force programs into specific screenmodes.
The best thing to do is to use either a standard TV or get a 1084 or
compatible monitor, as VGA does not run at the 15KhZ which AMOSPro and other
PAL/NTSC programs/Games do!

Oh yeah, im getting maried in a couple of months! hehe!

I dont know much about this, but I went into a bookstore in Park City called
Borders, and asked them to do a book search on AMOS and AMOSPro, and the
computer came up with 2 answers, one of which was "AMOS for Windows" which
totally baffled me. The other was something to do with the author.

Does anyone know of such a book, and is it what the title says?

Klik and pray it doesnt crash. hehe. Dont crash without it!!

Hi, another question from me (Thanks Mush for the prompt reply to my last   
one).

I noticed that there was a list of software that was written in Amos.   
 How do you update this list, is it updated automatically i.e. I have a   
game on the Aminet which was written in Amos but it isn't on the list.
Is this because:-
a) there is a grading system (i.e. the game doesn't use any extensions so   
it is quite a simple example of Amos coding) so it doesn't earn a place   
on the list.
b) you have to personally ask for it to be added?

BTW, the game in question is in game/think/solitaire.lha
Thanks again in advance,
Michael.

	If the source was availiable, it would be worth it, and possibly
failrly easy, since only a few things need to be changed.  I may be able
to write a patch...

	As I have said before, and AGA extension is not a good idea, or
really possible, since all the core functions would have to be changed.
An extension would have to have all new commands, and that might get
annoying to rebuild them all.

	No.  Far too hard.  Just run AMOS under UAE.

	AMOS can nt support monitors.  Anything other than NTSC and PAL are well
beyond it's scope.  Besides, supporting such things would be far too slow! 
Whereas AMOS's intention was to be fast.  You could access such modes
through an Intuition extender, or library calls, but then, you shouldn't be
dabbling in AMOS.

	Here's the AMOSPro.Lib patch, for all those people who don't have
it.  It's all text, and pretty small.  In regards to an AGA patch, it's
not too hard for some things.  Actually, I may need to do so, just for the
small task I had planned (Part I.5).  However, no patch will allow full
AGA implementation.  But I can speed it up by 25% on all blitter
operations!

When Mark, the editor of AMOS Club USA tried, they refused to even discuss it,
and when Steve, the owner of F1 tried, I think he said they agreed to speak to
him but made the price so high that it was crazy.

They're obviously washing their hands of it, and Francois is no longer
interested now that he's into his Click and Create project on the PC's at
Corel.

The classy thing for them to do would have been to release it into PD, like
Totally AMOS did with their stuff when they quit.  This way they're just
encouraging the pirates because there is no other way to obtain it.
-Chris.

Suits me fine. I am just pointing out the options, because, easy as Amos may
be, some of these authoring systems offer you even more power and ease of use
for buck (hmmm, don't know if that's good, considering Inform is free...).

Hehe. No problems about the reply. Firstly, im a little confused. You say
you saw my article on the CUCD disk. Cool. Which disk was it and what was it
called?

Secondly confusing, is the software list. Is this a Mushroom PD software
list? If this is on the CD I would love to know and have a look. At the
moment, Im not really adding anything to my PD library as I am *completely*
out of disk space. Im down to my last 10 meg of a 200Mb drive, but hopefully
will be upgrading to a 1 Gb soon. My Amiga is also offline, and I have to
use a PC for all my modem stuff, which is a complete pain in the arse,
especially having to telnet to the UK for my emails. Im getting married in a
couple of months, and a localized account, as my Mushroom Pd account will be
shut down in july/august.

If you have any more questions/queries, please ask away!!

Nop.

The correct answer is b) :)

Status: RO
X-Status: 

I need a part for my HD in order to add extensions to the PD library. Inside
my A1200, I have a 2.5 inch to 3.5 inch converter, and it only has one plug
on the end of it for my HD to go into. I could add a second plug, and add
another drive, but the cable is only around 3 inches long, and so there is
no room.

What I want to know is can someone supply me with a 40-pin extension cable,
or at least a gender changer for the one single ond, that way I can place a
double-ended cable, and add lots of drives, including a gig drive which I
might be getting in a few weeks.

I want the gender to have the same kind of plug on both sides, as that on
the back of the HD, if you catch my drift. All advice appreciated.

Beats me. Someone can always hope that the reason is that they someday will
take up their Amosproduction again, if a new Amigamodel ever is going to be
released. In other word, they still think there can be a profitable future
for the Amoslanguage. Well, just a theory of course :)

Another thing could be that they still thinks it's worth to keep the (c)
because people still is buying Amos products (through F1 Licenseware(?) etc)
Well, at least the Pro compiler still seems popular.

> One day the code will be released,

Perhaps I'm a hopeless pessimist, but I just can't see the logic about
Europress ever is going to release it to the big masses. If they have
trouble selling the code, why would they release it for free in the
future? Well, I really hope your're right. Would no doubt be like a
second x-mas for us all :)

> Keep waiting. I will.

Oh yes. Regardless what's going to happen with Amos, it's still fun to
playing around with it.

I think it should be possible, now Francois has shown it can be done and now
that numerous extension writers have shown it can be done even better. But I
guess it is a matter of time and money.

I sure do not have the skills to pull off such a feat.

BTW, I believe it says in the FAQ that Europress want to see money for the
Amos source. This is new to me. How much are they talking about?

Amos is more than a programming language for the Amiga. Do a search on the
WWW. You won't just find pictures of Tori.

I'm not sure if Mark got a price out of them when he ran the AMOS Club USA, but
you can ask him at:  MSchult@execpc.com

And Steve at F1 might have been given a price:

Hello!
I think it would be great to have a brand-new Amos-like languaje, but
dont waste your time on peecees. Why not for Amiga? Or better, for the
A/Box? Is it necessary to wait for Europress to release the code?
Francois made a great job coding Amos, but I think there are pretty
capable programmers around here (not me, of course), capable to design
and code an all-new programming language, maybe following the same idea
than Amos.
Do you think we can make a team and work together on a project of that
kind? I think the answer is yes...

What do you think?

It has to be done really - there's no reason why an upgraded AMOS clone can't
be as powerful as C++ or whatever, yet be so much easier to use. I've
designed such a language, called POP. It's like AMOS, but with many extra
features (details are on my web page - soon to be uploaded).

Wouldn't really want to encourage further growth of the PC market by doing
it for Windows. If such a language was to be made, it should be done for
the future computers, such as the A\Box. I think AMOS really boosted the
Amiga's popularity (it was the main reason I bought an Amiga) and I would
hope it would have the same effect on the A\Box, or whatever. Anything to
help the death of the PC. :-)

> I sure do not have the skills to pull off such a feat.

Me neither, but I'm hoping to aquire them. ;-)

It will be http://www.paston.co.uk/users/bwyatt/index.html

It's not uploaded yet as I've not finished it - should be done in a few
days. I'll send an email to the AMOS list when it's up.

Amos has an excellent environment for writing stuff, its just so damn old. 
They want money ?  I'm sure it can't be THAT much, not any more anyway. 
Maybe we should just do an =amos replacement project= with the skilled
assembly guys writing commands and functions, plus a nice environment to
work with.  I for one would welcome a new sucessor to amos, 'cos blitz just
can't cut it as a 'language'.  It would also need to take into account
things like support for new processors - like the Phase5 PPC stuff, and all
those other cool new bits coming soon.  Also, if enough people can bang out
command modules, it'll go together quite quickly.  How to get it to code
fast enough though.  Unfortunatly, I am happy with none of the languages on
the amiga, there is something missing from each.  If there is enough
interest from 'module writers' I could probably quite easily knock
up a nice kernel to work with.  Not 100% sure about code generation
off hand though.

Hopefully the A\Box will carry the Amiga flame. A new language for it could
really boost it's popularity and help create a decent software base.

Francois did a great job with AMOS, yes, but we must move on. AMOS is limited
in many ways, but it's original concept is fantastic. I don't like the
direction that programming is currently heading. It's becoming harder and
harder and quite out of the realms of beginner programmers. There's no need
for this! Theoretically, an AMOS type language could do anything that C++
can do, with much smaller, neater, easier to understand code.

I think the answer is no. Certainly not over the internet anyway. For a
team to work, they need to be together - need to know each other well and
be able to throw ideas about. Not really possible over the net.

However, it is a job of a small group of people, or even one person -
certainly not a large company.

AMOS is really still too old, even with updating. The whole thing needs to
be redesigned - add a bit of modularity, consistency, etc.

The cool bits we should be waiting for are new computers. Amigas are great,
of course, but their user base is shrinking all the time and they don't
really have the hardware to create killer games. A wave of new, cheap,
"super" computers are apparently just around the corner. These are the
computers that a new language should be done on (as long as they don't
run Windows :-D).

X-Status: 

On the Europress homepage (http://www.europress.co.uk/, 
frames-alert!) the following claim is made:

>Once you buy a Europress product, that's not the end of the story. 
>We enjoy enormous customer loyalty. We know you'll come back again, 
>so we do everything in our power to help you. There are also many 
>special privileges only available to our customers!
>
>You're never alone with a Europress product.  The Europress 
>technical support line is open from 8am to 6pm, Monday to Friday 
>with a team of experts ready to solve all your problems.

Is this what they call false advertising? They more or less claim
that their support lasts for ever. If it is false advertising, where 
can I complain? 

When I go to their support-pages, I can fill in a form
with questions about their products. However, you have to select the
product from a menu, as well as the system you are running it on.
Needless to say that Amos, Amiga and AmigaDOS cannot be selected.

X-Mailer: YAM 1.3.4 [020] - Amiga Mailer by Marcel Beck
Subject: Future of Amos Homepage
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: RO
X-Status: 


So much talk about the future of Amos the last few days (or really the last
few years). I am not much of a programmer, so I will not be able to contribute
in that department.

However, there have been a couple of projects towards enhancing/porting Amos
the last few years. I would be willing to put up on my homepage as much
information on these projects as possible.

So what would you like to see on such a page? It all depends of course on how
you perceive Amos. Is it a games programming language for the Amiga? In that
case AGA-compatibility is an important issue. Or is it a games programming
language period? In that case porting Amos becomes important. Or is it a
general purpose easy entry language? In that case it would be nice to look at
the closest alternative languages.

Some things that IMO should occur on such a page are:
-the history of Amos
-efforts to buy the source
-efforts to make a similar language
-extensions that go some way to pull Amos into the AGA-age
-the future of the Amiga (ports/emulators)

When you are in uncertainty, the most important thing is information about
what's going on. That kind of information would therefor be at the core of a
Future of Amos Homepage.

Maybe I am going too fast here, maybe there already is such a page.

Suggestions? Comments? Questions?

I somehow doubt someone will be mad enough to make Amos run on the A\Box, if
it's ever created by the slow company called Phase5. I am a lazy programmer,
I admit it, I do own the full version inc. manuals of SAS/C 6.57, but I can't
be bothered to learn it, so if I ever have a small idea, I use AmosPro2.0.

If Amos were ever to be updated (highly doubtful), it'd need to have AGA
screenmodes that also allow access to the 24bit screenmodes that gfx card
owners have and intuition as standard, yes I've played with an intuition
extention that allows AGA screens to be opened, but they are very slow
compared to the speedy extentions that Amos has for it's native non-intuition
screens.

My point? not much. I'm just saying my view on an outdated language that
most CyberGFX users scoff at and can't run. And that most users laugh at
Amos, I can see why, compared to the equivilant ASM or C progam, it's
bloated, slow and buggy.

I think AMOS would look crap on another machine, in my opinion.

The only other language in the way is Blitz Basic, really. C and C++ are
totally a different league.

These are a good idea. Im working on a part of my page, where you can
download any extension for AMOS which was released as PD.

I think if they found out there was a pirate board in the building right next
door distributing AMOS Pro for free, they wouldn't even lift a finger to do
anything about it.  But it would be good to hear from Francois sometime about
all this ... come on Francois, release it into PD, and we'll drink a toast to
ya, and even stop running down your PC stuff, maybe.

Hullo,
    Yup it's me again! Well can anyone tell me is it possible
to load in any old text file and display or just load in and store
in sorta memory with out the text having to have been saved out
in amos. Also does anyone know how to save some text using :-
-
A$="Hello"
B$="There!"
Open out 1,"ram:config.cfg"
Print #1,A$
Print #1,B$
Close 1
-
    So when you look at the text in a text editor it doesn't have
a little fuzzy square after each line?
    If anyone can help please get in touch.
   As you proberly know by now i only have email access through
a BBS and if you can help you'll have to email me direct!

	Well, I have a couple of things to say.  Looking at the AMOSPro.libs, it's
constructed no differently than the other extensions.  Just disassemble it
(I lack a good disassembler, only a monitor).  From there, limits can be
changed to easily incoporate AGA (like $06 to $08 in the screen CMP
command, add bp 7 & 8 to the copper list).  Not too hard.  A good optimizer
will give you 020+ code, with some possible hand cleaning of some bad
routines.  Add in some better memory allocation (like align the memory),
and AMOS could be twice as fast, and much more useful.  Of course, programs
would have to be modified (since Colour 13,$FFF would no longer be white,
but a bright blue...)

	Secondly, I hate to say this, but a lot of you sound like PC users.  "Lets
all wait for bigger processors, more memory, better OS, before a new
language".  The point of the Amiga, was to do a lot, without being a
"super-computer".  Please.  The idustry is now run by games.  No one needs
a P166 to use a wordprocessor, just for games.  And not even all of them,
just the Quake's and other 3D games.  Sure the Amiga can't compare, but
should it.  Do we want the Amiga to match the PC, do we want it to become
another PC.

	The 68060 holds' its own against a Mid-Range PPC, and my Amiga beats our
Performa 5200 hands down (acording to the Byte benchmark).  AGA can be
given new like by widening the bus to 64-bit (new FMODE would allow
1280x1024 at 85Hz, also copper modes could give us 12-bit 320x200),
changing the RAM to EDO, and locking down the chipram exclusively for the
custom chips.  Make one VLSI for the whole chipset, reducing construction
costs.  Throw in a $40 S3D chip, that can be accessed through new libraries
to have better 3D performance, and true SVGA chunky modes.  Genlock the
Amiga's out put with the SVGA to one monitor, or have the Amiga-A switch
between the two (no more pull down screens :( )  Clean up to OS, adding
_SOME_ of the better GUI enhancers, and you have an Amiga that could
compete with IBM's, easily.

	The problem is laziness and stupidity.  All the people who have tried
buying the Amiga, have just wanted to milk the last few bucks out of it. 
No one has the money, or desire to revive the Amiga.  Making a dumb A\Box
may be a cute idea, but it will fail, just like the BeBox is.  The Amiga is
what it is for a reason, is everyone missing this?  The Amiga would not be
an Amiga, with different stuff under the hood.  Amiga is not simply the OS.
 I can make Win95 look like AmigaDOS, but does it work like it.  Don't you
think that AmigDOS ported to a PC or PPC system wouldn't be 16Mb's as well.
 Kill the custom hardware, and you're conforming.  The OS will be no better
than any other on the market.

	My Two Cents.

	Deah.

Well that's an interesting point.  Does anyone know if an author retains any
control rights, or just the publisher?  Or does it depend on the contract they
have?

BTW, if you want to retain all your rights and still sell your stuff for 80% of
the sale price, eck out the internet site Albert's Ambry at:
http://www/alberts.com

I'm marketing the AMOS school game Spell Chopper there, in the Amiga section of
course, andhe owners are on the levYou ha so sign a contrn
depending on whether you give them exclusive seing righghts.  If you want to
chat with Ray, the owner, his e-mail is:

RayCoche@voicenet.com

Use A$=Input$(1,Lof(1)) if the file isn't larger than the textbuffer.

Better is to use the Bload command. Check your manual to see how it works.

Use:

Are you sure? This is all pretty basic stuff. What happens is that Amos tacks
on a Chr$(13) (Carriage Return) after using Print #.

I was going to wait until Mark Schult answered me also, but before this list
will clutter up with conjecture, here is what Steve Bye 
<steve@f1lw.demon.co.uk> told me. Mind you, a lot of what he has to say 
is also conjecture.

I did mention it to Ian Mcfegan last year sometime. As far as I recall, 
he said they would want a four figure sum minimum. That could have all 
changed by now of course.
Francois actually owns the copyright, but you would have to deal through
EPress and I suppose they would want their cut?  In other words it's 
impractical. It would be cheaper to pay someone to write new code from 
scratch anyway.

[A source within EuroPress (name snipped on Steve's request)] said 
Francois started on a PC version of amos PCOS (probably) but was talked 
into doing object oriented stuff like Click n Play, Click N Create etc. 
As far as I can tell these haven`t done as well as they should of, my 
guess is that is the case as you CAN`T DISTRIBUTE THE GAMES YOU MAKE 
WITH THE PACKAGES, (ROFL) they cost a packet too.

What I am getting at is hopefully Francois WANTS to do a PC version and 
it is only the EP bods stopping him. Err, but that wasn`t the question 
you asked.

As far as the source goes, forget it. Maybe he is keeping it FOR A 
REASON? A PCOS  reason.

Steve.

Greetings all.

I'm back.. as if any of you knew I was gone.. I haven't been
around since Sunday (Febuary 16th) to check my mail, so you can 
imagine all the mail I've had to read today. *PhEw*.

Anyways, I would like to comment on several of the subjects that
have been talked about lately.

First of all, this past weekend I sent out a call to anyone
that had information on where I could locate a graphics board
for my A3000, at one point I said:

> ..I'm looking for, like I said, either a Cybergfx
> or PicassoII with an AGA chipset in new or used
> (good) condition..

Chris Colson replied:
> Umm, no gfx card will give you the AGA chipset.. So if 
> you`re only interested in getting hardware level 
> compatability with AGA, you`ll have to get yourself
> a real AGA Amiga.

I know this. I was very tired when I wrote that message,
so please forgive me for writing anything that was incorrect.

What I was trying to key was that there is no emulator 
(besides Softaga, which is really a hack) that will emulate
AGA (that I know of). Now if there is, and anyone knows
where I could find one, please mail me (becaise I know it's
possible to do this, maybe with some difficulty, of course,
but nonetheless.)

Secondly, in reply to Mr. Lugo's cry for help:
> ..If you use your amiga for ART, MUSIC, OR CODING pleeeeze send me
> your email address, home page <if any>, and either what type of art 
> or music you do, or what programming languages you are familiar with.
> I would appreciate this greatly. Thanx!

Well, I can do art and coding when I get the chance. I'm still 
working on my project (which the project is a team project, and even
though my Web pages *still* aren't finished, when they are, I will be
putting a page up for people to sign up for the project.) The project
everyone, btw, DOES have a name now, in case your wondering what to
call it:

The Cafe Project

True, the word "cafe" is not an acronym, aside from tradition project
names, but, ask youself the question: "Who cares?". I don't. Neither
should you. However, if you was to feel the need to sit on your
computer and think of a cool acronym for the project name (using the
word "cafe"), please e-mail me. I would like for it to have something
to do with either the game's engine or the game itself.

Btw, in case you're wondering, Cafe is the name of the game's engine.

Now, on to Mr. Wilkinson's comment on UAE:
> Have you _SEEN_ UAE???

Me personally? Yes. I have. I use it.

> What did the U stand for anyway? Unusable?

Not funny.

> We had it here on a P200 for a while, ran a few demos... It made my

Well, I also own a P200 (from the Acer people, btw) loaded with cool 
multimedia figlets and alot of memory and the such. After seeing UAE 
on the Web not to long ago, I got it off, I tried it, and I liked it. 
For where it's at right now, I think it is by far the *best* Amiga 
emulator for the Unix/PC I've seen ever. And, at it's current stage 
of development, I think it's got a promising future. I'm tempted to 
see if Amos will run under it or not.. anybody tried this yet?

Okay, now onto the future of both Amos and the Amiga..

Both Keith Hill and Ben Wyatt said that Amos was just "so damn old" 
and "really still too old". Well, technically, it's not that old, 
just about a few years since any upgrades have been made on it (since 
1993 I believe). However, in the programming realm, yes, it is 
"aging". It could stand a facelift and lip-o-suction.

Mr. Wyatt also commented:
> The cool bits we should be waiting for are new computers.

Not exactly, in my opinion.

Well, first of all, the reason why Amiga's user base is "shrinking" 
is because there is really no more support either way, advertising or 
hardware support. I remember back when the Amiga was first announced 
here in the States, and it was all over the computing mags and TV. 
Now, your considered lucky to find a computer dealer that is familiar 
with the term "Amiga".

Onto Mr. Branko Collins comments on "The Future of Amos Homepage":

Well, as everyone knows that my Web pages aren't quite up yet, please 
trust me when I say that they will be up soon. It's taken longer than 
I thought to finish them, and lately I haven't been able to work on 
them. They are the pages for my little software company, Parrottsoft, 
as everyone knows, and they'll be totally dedicated to the Amiga and 
also to Amos (well, that is the lanuage I use).

> Some things that IMO should occur on such a page are:

> -efforts to buy the source
> -efforts to make a similar language
> -extensions that go some way to pull Amos into the AGA-age

Well, I have already designed a News page, (Amiga news only, btw),
which will probably be divided up into sections on different issues,
Amos being one of them (and probably the biggest). It will contain 
all of the above mentioned.

> When you are in uncertainty, the most important thing is information

I may dedicated a page with an idea similar to this on my site.

Mr. D. Cousins had something to say about the future of Amos:
> Secondly, I hate to say this, but a lot of you sound like PC users.

This is so very true, even though I am a PC user (I do my mail from 
my PC), but I'm not ashamed (except for the fact that I use Windoze.) 
It is true that when the Amiga was first released, it was a computer 
before its time. I remember a quote from one of my old Commodore mags 
that had an advertisement in it for the Amiga and it said:

"No other PC past, present or in the near future
has done it, is doing it or is likely to do it."

This was so true until the domination of the PC by Microsoft (or 
"Bitemesoft", as one might call it) and the advent of the new 
Pentiums etc etc.. then the Amiga's popularity just went downhill. It 
wasn't very long until the Amiga was unheard of in the States as 
for as public notoriaty goes. Then Commodore, after about 30 years of 
very successful business, files for bankruptcy and whole bunch of 
other mess, and then Escom comes in and buys them out. The rest is 
history, of course.

About the games, though, I am a programmer and software developer, 
and even though I write different types of programs, both what I like 
to write and what my aim is in programming is the gaming market, 
since that's where alot of the popularity and money is. And 
truthfully, I like the Amiga the way it is, even though there is room 
for improvement in it. This is true for Amos as well. But you know, 
you don't need a high-powered PC make and run really cool 3D games or 
high tech apps, just a little money, creativity, and the right kind 
of computer. That's one reason why I'm writing my 3D game on the 
Amiga *aND* under Amos, to show that it can be done (and since that's 
really that only language that's like second hand knowledge to me.)

Well, I think that's about it. I hope you've enjoyed reading another 
one of my "digests". I'm sorry this one was so long, but there was a 
lot to comment on and talk about. If did end up reading most of or 
all of this, I thank you alot for taking the time.

P.S. By the way, since I finally have some free time to finsh up my 
pages and get back to my programming, please send in any extra links 
that you have to any Amos related pages (I already have Mush's and 
Mr. Bintz's, which is only TWO, NOT ENOUGH!) *aND* also, please check 
by my site within the end of the week (or in between). I will putting 
up a page on the team project (Cafe Project) and info on how you can 
sign up on beta testing, etc..

Long live the Amiga!

[ Here was the forwarded letter from Steve Bye, F1 Licenceware ]

Thanks for sharing this interesting letter with us. I believe this once and
for all answers the questions if the Amossource do have the slightest
chance to become pd, or ever is going to be updated anymore. Perhaps not good
news, but atleast we now can be spared from any false hopes around this
matter.

But I don't think this is not expected among most of us. But is this
really so bad?? At least I personally don't think so. Just look at all the
great extensions our Amiga/Amos devoted programmers have given us. With
these we can use AGA, GUI, faster code/commands, etc.

But perhaps the biggest advantage is the devoted Amosusergroup itself.
Just look at this mailing list. If someone have a question about anything,
you can bet that there's always somebody ready to help you out with almost
every problem. Not to mention the overall never-ending nice attitude toward
eachother.

The world/market is often speaking about the extremely devoted Amiga
usergroup. It's not a secret that it's thanks to the Amigauser that the
Amiga actually still exist! It's this invisible connection between
all the individual amigausers around the world that is so magic, and other
platforms just don't have.

I don't know with you guys, but I myself have always seen the Amosuser as
the devoted magic group within the magic group. Meaning that on the same
basis that the world is looking at the special Amigauser, 'we' are viewed
as the same devoted usergroup among other amigausers. We are the group that
just doesn't allow Amos to die.

Perhaps big word from someone that really never had written something in
this list before, but I have followed most of the threads through the posted
Amoslist messages on aminet since a couple of years now, and continued to read
most of it after I got myself an inet account and signed me to this list.

Well, so much for that, but I suppose my point in all this simply is that
if someone still have fun using Amos(pro) even if it's nowadays limited
compared to other things, there's really no reason to give up this very
special language. Amos is still giving me this special feeling after
hitting the F1 key, and I can actually see a result of the code I just
typed.

There *is* something magic about getting the result you wanted, and
there *is* something magic about doing this in the environment of the
Amosuniverse.


Eh, sorry for this somewhat long letter, but since I really never write
something (don't want to bother the list with nonsense :) I take my
chances when they arrive :)

Subject: Amospro on UAE (Unleaded Amiga Emulator) ;)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Status: RO
X-Status: 





I head someone mention about running Amospro on UAE in a previous mail,
just to let you know I have tried it
 and it does work quite well. (It runs about the same speed as on an A500,
and the GFX run about 4 or 5 times slower).
I tried running several of my progs, and they seem to run fine, Lee
(Howarth) has tried out some of the copper commands,
Rainbow and double buffering, line drawing, etc. and it all seems to run
the same as a normal Amiga. I ran it on my
 P133 and Amospro loaded in about 35 Seconds (from a .ADF file), but I
suspect it would load much faster from a Hardfile.
I also ran some compiled Amos Programs (with sound) and they also worked.
(The sound was a bit sick though!).
If you would like anything tested then just ask me and I`ll see if it
works.

Bye all.

P.S: Please Ignore any rubbish line breaks, etc; as this PC mail program is
crap!

P.P.S: Andy Mushroom:- Count me and Lee in for the "Amos Party `97" in
mancheser. (cya on irc).

Hi everyone. Im having trouble with this language known as AMAL that us
AMOS`uns use. Im writing a beat-em-up clone based on the Target;Renegade
game (Im sure you all played it on the speccy and C64) and am having a few
problems with the AMAL side of things.

Im trying to develop my AMAL routines to make the guy move around, jump,
twist, and fight, all within the AMAL itself, so hardly any BASIC lines are
used, other that registers. Has anyone here got a good AMAL bank they can
email me, as I dont have one for the AMAL editor, and would love to know how
it is all layed out, so I can start this project. An AMAL bank from anything
to moving stuff around the screen, or some fancy effects would be nice.

Whats the command to write AMAL to a bank? I know the one for reading!

Cheers

On my web page, I have around 2 or 3 megs of web space left, and want to
fill it up with a whole load more AMOS programs, docs, tutorials etc.

I am working on a HTML file, which hosts a "New AMOS game" every week or so,
that can be downloaded. It doent have to be a game, it can be a utility. If
you8 have a program you would like featured, send it to me with full docs in
Lha format, WITH A SCREENSHOT so the folks can see what it looks like.
Screenshot doesn`t have to be in the archive.

I will permanantly keep some games on my webpage, providing they are less
than 100K in size, as my space would soon fill up otherwise.

I also want tutorials on anything, as the downloadable tutorials section I
have is pretty lame, and only covers tutorials I have done. They include a
whole series on making music players, and demos, and IFF fonts. I also did
one which shows how to make graphic equalizers.

All contributions will be welcome, and your details will be pasted on the pages.

Cool. The ChanServ bot just came on and I opped it. I would like some
status, along with other members who may even consider coming on.

I suggest you pitch over to stealth, where most of the AMOS traffic go to
anyhow, and it is packed full of users, other than the 21 users that are on
it right now.

howdy.. I'm wondering if someone could be real nice and do me a favor. I'm
looking for the examples that came with amos1.2 ...when I upgraded to 1.3 it
deleted them, but I seem to be needeing them.. could someone who was smart
enough to back them up, or still has them please send them to me? I'd
appreciate it. While I'm asking for things, does anyone have a sound sample
like the sound that cartoons make when someone falls of a cliff or something?
You know, that long whistle followed by a boom. Thanx for your help, you guyys

You would probbably be best learning AMOS Pro, version 2, as it comes with
the online help. I have never used Easy AMOS, so dont know how Easy it is to
use.

My homepages have AMOS tutorials to download if you are interested in
learning on a particular subject. The address is http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk

Go for AmosPro - most of us here use it, and if you can, get the compiler
upgrade.  Most of the stuff available for amos is aimed at amospro people,
and without the compiler, its a mess to distribute finished programs.  
 
..Plus, AmosPro has nice on-line help.

   Thanks every one for your advice. It looks like I'll be going for Amos
Pro then, luckily I have both programs collecting dust somewhere including
the compiler.

cheers

p.s. anyone want to buy Easy Amos.

Well folks. Im improving my homepages once more. Im reducing the size of the
GFX, as well as a completely new makeover (gotta do something when your
bored, right?) and uploading more archives by using my other web space holders.

If anyone has any games.utilities they would like hosted, then get in touch
with me. Each week, I will be uploading a selection of games and utilities
for download. These will be rotated, so there will always be something new
on the page. Please include an IFF/GIF screenshot seperate of any archives
you send to me. For more info, give me a shout!

All the best!!

APro would be best, if you can find a copy of 2.00.  If not, stick with easy
amos.

     I'll second that - jump in at the deep end. Most forms of basic
appear daunting when you first start so you may as well have the extra
commands and functions of Amos Pro available straight away. You'll find
it's worth it. 

The Amos Pro Compiler will update Amos Pro to version 2.0 when you
install it so again, it's well worthwhile.

If you get stuck, you'll know where to turn  :-)

Geoff.
