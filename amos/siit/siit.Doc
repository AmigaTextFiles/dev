			Storm Icon Image Tool
				OR
			(S.I.I.T. for short!)
		This is FREEWARE spread it EVERYWHERE!

This Utiltiy was written by me to be a fast and down to earth icon editor,
Ofcourse it can also be used to edit small sprites/bobs but it is aimed
towards creating icons blocks for use in games ect.There are enough sprite
editors around so why bother?.Well this program deals with icons of a 
specific size ,So that it can be used to construct background graphics in
games.Also i feel it is easy to use and fairly straight forward to understand
and get to gripes with,Used with the screen editor utility it can have some
outstanding results!,And finally it is based around the old commodore 64 
sprite editors!!!!So there are no line,circle,brush commands this is RAW and
fast!!.

So...

Getting Started
---------------
Upon loading you will be asked what size icons you would like to edit.
Simply click on one of the gadgets to make your choice.

8 by 8 stands for 8 pixels along and 8 pixels down

The choices are...

8 by 8 , 8 by 16 , 8 by 32
16 by 8, 16 by 16, 16 by 32
32 by 8, 32 by 16, 32 by 32
(Any bigger and it would be impossible to deal with sensibly, using amos!).

Choose carefully as this is cant be changed during editing!

Next you will be asked for the number of colours used for the icons
From a choice of:
 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 ,

All in low-resolution screen mode.

Once done the Icon editor will magically appear!!.

SCREEN SETUP
------------
The screen is split in two.The bottom halve has the options (icons)that are 
available to the user while the top halve holds the the editing and
colour selecting area.

PLOTTING
--------
 Where-ever the mouse arrow changes to a cross-hair in the top halve of
the screen ,Is where you can place a pixel,Simply by clicking the left
mouse button.A "real size" interpretation of the icon will appear on the
bottom right of the editng screen.
Near the bottom you will see a status report this will constanly change to
inform what is going on!.
To the right you will see a row of colours going down the screen.By 
clicking on a colour you will be able to change the actual editing
colour.The box with COL written underneath it shows what colour is in 
current use.

			ICONS AND OPTIONS
			-----------------
Dont worry if your about to try something drastic SIIT will ask if
you are sure you want to proceed for the more erasable commands!.

Working across the icon panel from left to right:-

ADJUST PALETTE
--------------
This part was written by John Collet.
It works in the same way as the palette editor in Deluxe paint 4.
To change a colour click on the colour range chart then adjust the hues of 
that colour by moving the Red ,Green and Blue sliders up and down.
The copy icon will let you move one colour to another area by clicking where
in the range you want the colour to go.
The swap icon will swap one colour to another by selecting the colour to swap
with
The range icon will graduate a colour into another colour.This is used mainly
when you need a range of for example black to white ,This option will fill
in the middle hues from black to white!.
Rset icon will reset the colours to the original values before being changed.
Okay icon will exit back to the editor.
The rest of the icons are not used!.(fix , save)

LOAD ICONS
----------
This option will bring up the boring AMOS 1.34 file requestor.(I promise to
change this as soon as Amos pro compiler is out!).This option will let you
load any icons available on a disk!.Click quit if you dont want to!.
Note:You can load icon images bigger than 32 * 32 because SIIT doesnt
check for this!.Sometimes this can be used to good effect.
Also loading an AMOS sprite or BOB bank will not help matters!!!.

SAVE ICONS
----------
This will save all images in the current Icon bank to disk.
Again if you wish to not save anything simply click on quit in the file
requester.

GET ICON
--------
Clicking this icon will let you fetch an icon from the icon bank,By using
 the current icon number to the left.

PUT ICON
--------
Once your design for an icon is finished you need to store the image in
the icon bank otherwise you may lose it!.
By clicking this icon the current icon image will be stored in the icon
bank using the current icon number.

<< Number >>
-- ------ --
The two arrows pointing to the left will move down the icon image number
While the two arrows pointing to the right will move up.

The number in the centre  will display the actual number of the current icon,
This number will be used to store (put) and retrieve (get) from the icon bank.
So Use this number to place the images in the icon bank.

MEM
---
This icon will display all relevant information about MEMory plus the 
space left on any drive (if any)
FREE FAST MEM:				ICONS AVAILABLE:
FREE CHIP MEM:				SCREEN RES:
FREE TOTAL MEM:				BLOCKS PIXEL SIZE:
FREE DF0:				FREE DF1:

The computer will detect if a second drive is there so dont panic about
that if you have not got one!.

			     SECOND ROW
			     ----------

HREV
----
By clicking this the icon image will be horizontally reversed.

VREV
----
By clicking this the icon image will be vertically reversed.

FILL
----
This is used in the same way as any fill command.
When this icon is clicked it will stay lit signifing that your are in fill
mode.
Now simply click where you want the fill to at and the computer will then
fill the area pointed to using the current selected colour.
If you decide not to use this mode click on the fill icon again to cancel.
You are advised to "box in" where you want to fill as an "overspill" could
ruin your image!.

CLEAR
-----

Clicking this icon will clear the current image on the screen using the
current colour.

SPARE
-----
When this icon is clicked on you will now be in spare mode!.
You can toggle this SPARE screen from view.
This mode was developed so that you could try pasting your icons on a 
"normal" screen and seeing how they would look together or apart.
The top halve of the screen will appear to go blank but now your are 
able to paste icons from the icon bank to this screen!. 
By using the << >> icons you can flick through the images and by clicking
on the spare screen you will paste an icon at that position!.
Also if you would like to clear this screen click on the clear icon!.(note 
only clears spare screen and not icon image in this mode!).

ERASE BANK
----------
Clicking this will allow you to clear all the icons in the icon bank!.
Use with care!!!.

STATUS
------
This is not an icon as such it just displays what is currently going on and
how things are!?.

EXIT
----
This will EXIT the program. (How patronising!)

---------------------
This icon will bring up some more information for you to read!.

Late Extras
-----------

Pressing DELETE will bring up a requestor for people wanting to erase the
tune in memory and so giving more available memory!.

Pressing F10 will allow you to change the current palette by loading an
IFF screen and ripping the palette from that screen.
This can be used when some icons need to be the same as some extra background 
graphics.

Pressing Esc will quit!

Pressing Help will bring up the copyright notice!.
