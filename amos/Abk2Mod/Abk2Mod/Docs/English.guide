@node INTRO "Abk2Mod v2.1 - Overview"

                              @{b}OVERVIEW@{ub}

  ABK2MOD converts AMOS Music Banks into standard ProTracker modules,
  using an easy-to-use grafical interface: handles banks created with
  AMOSMusic Konverter, GCM2Abk and, theorically, SonixConverter. The
  reason that lead me to write this program was the impossibiity to see
  AMOS musics in a Protracker-like program: I really love see my modules
  working in Protracker...

  Abk2Mod is @{i}SHAREWARE@{ui}, this is to say that if you use it, you are
  morally obliged to pay @{"the regfee" LINK REG}, obtaining in this way
  the full working Abk2Mod package. Since I heard of many people that uses
  Abk2Mod without registering, I decided to put a seiries of boring
  requester when entering/exiting from the program. To make registering
  as easy as possible I've introduced a keyfile system: infact from
  2.0 version you can get new releases of Abk2Mod directly from my
  homepage or from Aminet (dev/amos) ant then use the keyfile to
  make it registered. And, last but not least, for the happyness of
  every-without-money persons, the basic registration is FREE!
  Go to the @{"registration chapter" LINK REG} for more infos.

  @{i}NOTE: my English is not very well, so don't blame me about mistakes in 
        this English version of Abk2Mod manual. I think that not-italian 
        people prefere a mistaken English than a perfect Italian.
        If you find mistakes, please correct them and send me the doc: 
        I ask you to not redistribute it without my permission.@{ui}

@node REG "Abk2Mod v2.1 - Registration"

                             @{b}REGISTRATION@{ub}

  You can register Abk2Mod in two ways: as USER or as SUPPORTER. In all
  cases I will send you a keyfile with your personal data encrypted, that
  will disable/enable some functions.

  USER
     This keyfile is FREE, but you can only receive it via electronic
     mail and this keyfile may expire when I will change, for a reason
     or for another, the keyfile encryption system (but naturally you
     can ask another keyfile...;). This keyfile will disable all
     shareware requester but it will not enable the 'Play Mod' option.
     Simply send me the @{"regform" LINK regform} filled in all its parts via email.

  SUPPORTER
     If you want to hear the converted module before saving it on disk,
     then you should register as supporter. This key file is not FREE
     (see the table below) and you can obtain via e-mail or snail-mail
     only sending the @{"regform" LINK regform} completed in all its part along with the
     sum of money required.

          +---------------------+------------+----------------+
          | Currencie           | via E-Mail | via Snail-Mail | 
          |---------------------+------------+----------------|
          | Italian Lires       |     10.000 |         15.000 |
          | Deutsch Mark        |         10 |             15 |
          | American Dollars    |          7 |             10 |

          +---------------------+------------+----------------+
  
     As you can see in the prevoius table if you want to receive the
     key file via e-mail it will cost you less than via snail-mail.


 If someone translate this manual in a language different form italian
 or english, he can obtain a FREE SUPPORTER keyfile. Please before
 starting on a work, tell me that, because someone could have done
 it before you!
                                                     
  ***********************************************************************
      THE REGISTERED VERSION CAN NOT BE REDISTRIBUTED IN ANY FORM!!
        ITALIAN AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS PUNISH THIS TYPE OF CRIME 
  ***********************************************************************

  I will not forgive pirates: think twice before coping to friends or to
  pirate sites the registered keyfile of Abk2Mod or before modifing it
  without my written permission. I think that the registration fee is very
  low, I made Abk2Mod shareware not to make money but to know all its
  users. The regfee is only a small return for the time spent on this
  program.
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  The demo version can be copied freely, but you can't make money selling
  it at high prices! PD magazines, librarues, Aminet, FredFish can include
  the demo version in its own CDs or coverdisk! If you want include Abk2Mod
  in shareware or commercial package you must first obtain a writte
  permission form the Abk2Mod author.

@node HARD "Abk2Mod v2.1 - Hardware & Software Requirements"

                 @{b}HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS@{ub}

  In order to run Abk2Mod requires an Amiga v37+ (WB2.04+), some AMOS
  Music Banks, and in LIBS: a shared library must be present:

  reqtools.library - © Nico Francois
 
  Other libraries used by Abk2Mod generally are in ROM o in the default
  LIBS: drawer, since they are system-libraries.

  The keyfile that you will receive after registering should be placed
  in L: direcotry.
  
 @{i} NOTE: since version 2.0, Abk2Mod is not compatible with 1.3 Amiga.
        If the request will be high enough, I will create a 1.3 compatible
        version.@{ui}

@node USARLO "Abk2Mod v2.1 - How to use the program"

                       @{b}HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM@{ub}

  After launching Abk2Mod a little GUI appears. Here you can find some
  gadets, controlling the program.
  
  @{b}LOAD@{ub}
    opens the filerequester in order to choose the AMOS Bank to convert.
    When loaded the bank is converted into standard tracker module.

    NOTE: the AMOS Bank must be a music one and not a sample, sprite or
          icons bank, otherwise the program will not load it. 
         
  @{b}SAVE@{ub}
    opens the requester in order to select the location and name of the
    just converted module.
  
  @{b}PLAY/STOP@{ub}
    start the playing of the just converted module. This gadget
    allow you to hear the module before saving it, lets you saving
    time in the case of a corrupted module or mistaken selections.
    To stop playing simpli click to 'Stop' in the requester that will
    appear (function only for SUPPORTER users).
  
  @{b}INFO@{ub}
    shows some infos about the author and the program.
  
  @{b}QUIT@{ub}
    aborts the program. Remember to save any converted module before
    exiting otherwise you will loose it!.
        
  @{b}LED@{ub}
    enable/disable the LED command conversion. Please refer to
    @{"LED ON/OFF" LINK CORR} for more infos.
        
  When a bank is loaded, Abk2Mod converts it. Then then gadget @{i}SAVE{ui} will be
  enabled as well as @{i}PLAY/STOP@{ui}, so you can save or hear it.
  No errors should occur during conversion, since the converting routine
  is well coded, but if something goes wrong a requester will inform you
  of this. Please if any errors happen please send me the incriminated module
  for debugging.
@endnode

@node CORR "Abk2Mod v2.1 - The LED ON/OFF conversion"

              @{b}THE LED ON/OFF (E00,E01) CONVERSION@{ub}

  The AMOS Music Converter handles any "Exx" command as the one to
  enable/disable the LED (filter). Abk2Mod gives you the chance of avoiding
  any LED commands. If the @{b}LED@{ub} gadget is enabled all commands will
  be converted, otherwise, if the @{b}LED@{ub} gadget is disabled, the
  E00 and E01 command will be skipped. If you are in doubt, convert the bank
  with the led command enabled, and if it plays wrong, reconvert it disabling
  the LED command.

  NOTE: if you change the LED gadget status you must reload the module
        to hear differences.

@node BUGS "Abk2Mod v2.1 - Known bugs"
  
                            @{b}KNOWN BUGS@{ub}

  Coding a program is not simple: also the best programmer ever makes
  mistakes, and the resulting program suffers of bugs. Since I'm not
  infallible, Abk2Mod can contain bug somewhere. If you find one of
  them please report it to me. The program has been tested using
  AMOS Banks produced by AMOS Music Konverter v2.1 and GMC2Abk.
  If you can test Abk2Mod with a module created by SonixConverter
  please tell me the results and eventual problems.

  If, during playing of a module, you hear strange beep in background
  please use a ProTracker like program and cut last bytes of the
  sample that cause the beeps. This is not my fault but AMOS one
  becuase the samples data often are corrupted. In a future version
  I'll try to fix this tedious problem...

  From version 2.1 Abk2Mod is EnforcerHit-free. All illegal memory
  accesses have been removed, so now the program should be compatible
  with all Amiga models.

@node ERRORI "Abk2Mod v2.1 - Error messages"

                          @{b}ERROR MESSAGES@{ub}

  During execution of Abk2Mos some errors may occur. Here a full
  description of each one ("->" represents a probable solution):

  @{b}COULD NOT OPEN FILE@{ub}
       the file you choosed doesn't exist or is unreadable.
    -> Make sure that the selected file exists, is readable 
       (protection bit 'r' enabled), and that is not corrupted.

  @{b}NOT AN AMOS MUSIC BANK@{ub}
       the file you selected is not an AMOS Music Bank or is corrupted.
    -> Make sure that the selected file is the right one and that is
       a music bank.
    
  @{b}FILE SIZE IS GREATER THAN 40K@{ub}
       the demo version can't load files larger than 40K.
    -> Register :)
    
  @{b}NOT ENOUGH MEMORY@{ub}
       There is not enough memory to convert the module. Although Abk2Mod
       works fine on a 512K Amiga, in order to convert big modules
       1Mb is required. The contiguos memory available must be at least
       the double of module size.
    -> Close all programs working in background and if it's not enough
       buy a memory expansion card ;)
       
       This error may occur even with a lot of memory available: the
       Amiga memory is defragmented and Abk2Mod requires contiguos
       memory.
    -> Reset your Amiga and retry.
    
  @{b}CONVERSION ERROR@{ub}
       An internal error has occurred during conversion.       
    -> Send me the module that caused the error
  
  @{b}COULD NOT READ/WRITE FILE PROPERLY@{ub}
       Abk2Mod can't read or write the module on that certain support.
       This can be caused by several factor: above all a unreadable
       disk track, or a full device (like disk, or HD).
    -> Change the support for the module you want save/load. Make sure
       that in the disk the space in enough to contain the converted
       module.
    
  @{b}COULD NOT OPEN xxx.LIBRARY@{ub}
       Abk2Mod can't find a required library. All these libraries must
       be placed in your LIBS: drawer with lowercase name.
    -> Make sure that Abk2Mod is @{"installed" link HARD} properly.

@node STORIA "Abk2Mod v2.1 - History"

                          @{b}ABK2MOD HISTORY@{ub}

  v0.9ß  Beta-version, released only to betatesters.

  v1.0ß  Beta-version; completely rewritten using AmigaE language.
         Better interface, size and performace.

  v1.1ß  Beta-version; gadget shortcuts added, better handling of
         requesters. Now "reqtools.library" is closed when the program
         terminate. Strange loops has been deleted. Better samples
         conversion (no more truncated samples). More optimized code.

  v1.2ß  Beta-version; if during conversion an error happens, the program
         exits legally, closing all libraries and GUI. Better memory 
         handling, it will be ever deallocated.
         
  v1.3ß  Beta-version; minor bugs fixed, added the Protracker module
         replayer. Now gadgets selected by shortcuts are rendered.
         
  v2.0   New graphic interface: more userfriendly and, above all, font
         sensitive. Added compatibility with music banks created by
         GMC2Abk and, theorically, by Sonix Converter (not tested).
         Added gadget 'Led' to let the user choose if convert the filter
         commands E01, E00. Sometimes loops was  mistaken like the number
         of pattern positions: fixed!

  v2.1   Now Abk2Mod is EnfocerHit-free: it should be compatible with all
         actual and future Amiga models. New keyfile system.
