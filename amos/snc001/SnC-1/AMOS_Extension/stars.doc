AMOS Stars Extension V2.23b.	**SHAREWARE VERSION**

By Jason G Doig



Introduction.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Stars  is  an  Amos  (and  AmosPro)  system extension, that provides many new
commands to the Amos instruction set.



Installation.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
My  apologies  for  the lack of an installation script, this is being written
very  late  the night before I leave for a short holiday, and I simply do not
have time right now.



To install the Extension, load workbench and find the relevant file:-

'stars.lib' for Amos 1.3

'starspro.lib' for AmosPro



You  will  then  need  to  copy  this  to  the relevant system drawer, either
"amos_system"  or  "ap_system".   Now boot up Amos, and use the configuration
program supplied with Amos to set the loaded extensions.

Type the path of the of the stars library into location #20.  To see what the
necessary  file  path is, simply look at the early positions in the extenrion
list,  as  the  standard  system extensions are in the same place as you have
just put stars.lib.

Now reboot Amos.

Please work with a copy of your normal boot disk, as if you give an incorrect
path, then Amos may refuse to boot.

Please mail me if you have any problems.



Commands
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 The commands are as follows:-



STARS BLAST

Does a fancy fade effect on the current screen.



STARS VBL

Does the same as WAIt VBL, but shows idle processor time.



The  following  are  the  actual starfield commands.  These plot stars, under
interrupt onto a given screen.  Please note that these plot not in a specific
colour,  but  straight  onto  the last bitplane of a screen, so please try to
keep  this clear or it will get corrupted.  The easiest way to put stars on a
screen  is  to have one plane more than you actually use.  So use a 32 colour
screen  to display a 16 colour logo.  Then copy the first half of the palette
to  the  second.   Change the respective upper colour where you want stars to
show  through.   e.g.  Change Colour, to show through colour 0 on our example
above.



STARS ON screen,direction,number

Displays  [number]  stars,  traveling  in  a  specific  direction,  on screen
[screen]
Only one screen can have stars at one time.
The maximum number of stars is 128

The directions are:-

0 Left
1 Right
2 Up
3 Down
4 Stationary



STARS OFF

Switches off the stars and removes them.

STARS DIR direction

Changes the direction of the current starfield



The  next  few commands complement the built in COP commands.  See the manual
for details.



COP PALETTE a TO b,address

Reads  12bit  colours  from  memory,  and  builds  o copper list to put these
colours  in palette registers a to b.  a and b can be in the range 0-255, but
a < b.

A colour takes up one word.



COP TRUE PALETTE a TO b,address

This is the same as above, but takes colour in the form Red Byte, Green Byte,
Blue Byte, ie.  24bit.

A colour therefore takes 3 bytes.



=COP CURRENT

Returns  the address the copper list is currently being built at.  This makes
poking straight into it easier.



Look  out  for  my  friend  Gary's forthcoming game, which uses these and the
extra commands found in the full version of stars.

The extra commands include:-

COP SCREEN, which sets up a copperlist for a whole screen (in an AGA mode if 
you want!)

STARS RAIN, which builds multiple 24bit Rainbows.

register now for these and more!



All  stars  commands  will also work on non-aga machines (or have equivalents
which do the same job).

Please feel free to contact me with comments, suggestions or bug reports.

I can also be contacted term time, by E-Mail :    JasonD@uk.ac.hw.cee

Upgrades  will  be sent out to registered users only.  (although feel free to
ask   for  more  details  on  the  current  version  before  you  register  -
unregistered users should send an SAE).

Please note that the AmosPro extension requires AmosPro V1.1, due to a bug in
Amos.  The updater should be available where you obtained this archive.
