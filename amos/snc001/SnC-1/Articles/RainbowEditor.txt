                            Rainbow Editor V1.01
=============================================================================

This is an accessory for use with AMOS Professional.  To run it you will have
to  either  add  it  to your `USER' menu or from the `AMOS' menu select `Load
Accessory' and select the program from there.

The source is saved as a standard AMOS file so you can't view the source code
via  the  menu.   You'll  find it in the AMOS_source drawer on this disk.  It
would  be  a  good  idea to copy it to the same drawer/disk as all your other
accessories.


A new masterpiece in AMOS Programming is born...               Oct/16/1993

                             - The manual -
                            


Well, I think you don't need a big manual for this programm.The way you
will learn to master 'RainbowEditor' is simply learning by doing.
Despite of the useful on-line help mode I will state some sentences to
all of the buttons'n'function this program provides you with.


After starting it, the main screen with all edit function symbolized by
gadgets and buttons appears. The title bar provides four buttons:


FLAG SYMBOL: 
     This is the quit button. Be careful it works without warning, so if
     you have designed something wonderful I recommend to save it before
     you try to use this button.
     
PROGRAM NAME:
     If you click on the area where 'AMOS RAINBOW EDITOR' is written you
     are able to drag  the  screen around  holding the left mouse button
     pressed.
     
MY NAME:
     Clicking on my name will conjure up the copyright screen.
     Have a look at it!
     
HELP BUTTON:
     A click on the HELP-button will  enter the on-line help mode. If it
     is active the mouse pointer will change to an animated image (owner
     of the AMOS Pro compiler will know it perhaps)  and you are able to
     click on every  location on the screen.  If there is a button under
     your mouse pointer the status line will show a quick help for you.
     

------------------------------
--- The PROJECT section ---------
------------------------------------

TO PRG:
     This button only works when 'RainbowEditor.AMOS' was started as an
     Editor accessory.
     It will copy the source code which is needed to define the rainbow
     directly into  the currently  edited program at the current cursor
     location.  It creates a procedure called _SET_RAINBOW  which holds
     all the AMOS commands that are needed to install the Rainbow.
     Simply conjure up your Rainbow by a call to the procedure.
     
ASCII:
     AMOS V1.34 user will  need that.  This  button  generates the same 
     procedure as the above, but writes it into an ASCII file. So every
     AMOS user  is able  to merge  the procedure  into his program by a
     simple call to the merge ASCII function.
     
LOAD (key: 'l') :
     Loads a Rainbow Definition file. 'RainbowEditor' uses an own file
     format to save the Rainbow you have created as it is not possible
     to load a  Rainbow saved as an ASCII  or grab a  Rainbow from the
     Editor. 
     
SAVE (key 's') :
     Saves the Rainbow as a Rainbow Definition  file  which should end 
     with the '.RBD' extension.  These files  could be read again by a
     call to the LOAD function.

  You can hide the edit screen at every time by pressing the spacebar.
  This will reveal the Rainbow full sized in its complete beauty.
     
-----------------------------
--- The SCREEN section ---------
-----------------------------------

PAL - NTSC:
     These buttons toggle between the screen PAL or NTSC. But because
     the  program  checks  if  it  has  been  run  on a PAL or a NTSC 
     machine and  according to this sets its defaults you  won't need
     them.      (why have I implemented them ? I don't know..)
     If 'RainbowEditor' recognizes that it has  been started on a PAL
     machine it will set  the screen height to 282 in  order to fully
     show the Rainbow you are to edit.
     
HIRES - LORES:
     Toggles  the background screen  between  640*200,  16 colours or
     320*200, 32 colours.
     
CLEAR:
     Wipes any image on  the background screen away replacing it with
     colour 0. Believe me this function was the easiest to include.

LOADIFF:
     Load an IFF picture into the background screen. The AMOS LoadIff
     function is used  for this purpose  and you have  to ensure that
     your piccie fits into the current background screen. 
                            
SCREEN HEIGHT:
     Use the arrow buttons to individually change the current screen
     heigth. Allowable numbers range between 16 and 480.
     Click on SCREEN HEIGHT to enter the number via keyboard
     
RB HEIGHT:
     The arrows  will alter the physical height of the Rainbow, that
     means the number of lines you will see on screen.
     Clicking on 'RB HEIGHT' will ask for the keyboard, too.
      

---------------------------------------
--- The RAINBOW SETTINGS section ---------
---------------------------------------------
       
PRESETS I - VI:
     These little buttons will install the preset settings. They only
     will have effect on the currently active Rainbow.The first three
     buttons change all three colour components.  Number one installs
     a 30 lines grey bar.  Number two installs an about 90 lines high
     bar and number three installs one bar covering the whole screen.
     The buttons four to six  install exactly the  same  definitions,
     but they  work only on the  currently selected colour component. 
     Try it and you will see how it works.
     
RAINBOW:
     AMOS allows you to  install up to  four different Rainbows. Here
     you are able to switch between them.  Remind that Rainbows could
     not be merged. So you have to take care, that the Rainbows don't
     overlay, if you don't want to have some strange results.The best
     way to find good parameters for more than one rainbow on display
     is by trial and error. So change them until they look good.
     All edit functions have effect on the Rainbow determined by this
     number.
   
COLOUR:
     Here  you  can  change  the  colour  index  which  is used by the
     current Rainbow.  All colours the screen provides are allowed. So
     you have 16 on a Hires screen and 32 on a Lowres.
     Setting this value to -1 will deactivate the current Rainbow.
     That means that it would not be displayed.

OFFSET:
     Change the Offset  in the  Rainbow Colour table  which determines
     the colour of the first Rainbow  line to be seen.  For details on
     this and  the  following  parameters  read the Rainbow section in
     your AMOS manual. Allowable numbers range from 0 to LENGTH
     

VERT POS:
     Change the vertical position  of the current Rainbow.  Determines
     the  position of  the  first  Rainbow line  on screen.  Allowable
     numbers range from 0 to 312.

LENGTH:
     Determines the length of the Rainbow table in  memory, that means
     the number of lines for which a colour  definition exists.  It is
     perfectly  allowed that  this number  exceeds the  height  of the
     Rainbow on screen.You are then able to scroll through the Rainbow
     by  changing  the  OFFSET value or  by pressing the  cycle button
     explained later. Allowable numbers range from 0 to 9999.


-----------------------------------
--- The EDIT STRINGS section ---------
-----------------------------------------

This  powerful  section  provides  you  with all the tools you need to
effectively design wonderful Rainbows.


THE LARGE COLOR CYCLE BUTTON:
     This  button  switches  between the three  colour components red,
     green and blue and determines the currently edited component.
     If you don't know how the Amiga creates colours by mixing three
     components I recommend that you read the section in the AMOS user
     guide which deals with colours.

THE THREE COLOUR BUTTONS:
     These are used to switch off the corresponding colour component.
     You should  know that  they only work  on screen.  If you save a 
     Rainbow or copy it to your program the colour which was switched
     off would  be there again.  If you really  want to  switch off a
     colur you have to delete the corresponding patternlist.

COPY (key: 'c') :
     Copy the currently selected pattern  to a  new  position.  First
     select the pattern you want to copy,then select the new position
     you want to place the pattern to.

EXCHNG (key: 'e') :
     Exchange a pattern with another. Works like the copy button.
     
GRAB (key: 'g') :
     Used to grab a  pattern from the  patternlist of  another colour
     component. First deselect the colour you want to grab from using
     one of the three colour buttons.  If more  than one  colours are
     switched off the first of them will be used. Now the patternlist
     of this colour is  shown and you are  able to select the pattern
     you want to replace the current one.
     
ADD (key: 'a') :
     Use this  button to insert an  empty pattern at  the end  of the
     list.  You are allowed to have up to 30 patterns in the list and
     the program will warn you if you try to exceed this limit.
     
REMOVE (key: 'r') :
     This button will remove the currently selected pattern and shift
     down the following patterns by one step.

INSERT (key: 'i') :
     Insert an empty pattern at the location of the selected one. All
     patterns after  this position including the selected one will be
     shifted one step up.

CYCLE (key: 'y') :
     Click  on the play | > | button  to start  cycling  through  the
     Rainbow by constantly  changing the offset value.  Cycling works
     on interrupt,  so you are able to change  nearly every parameter
     except the offset and the length  while in cycle mode. But every
     time you made a change  the cycling  will start at the beginning
     of the Rainbow table.
     You can stop cycling using the | || |  button.
        
LIST WINDOW:
     Click on the item you want to declare as the current pattern.The
     current pattern  is displayed witch a  >>  symbol instead of its
     sequential number.

LIST ARROWS ans SLIDER:
     Use them to scroll through the  list if your list  includes more
     than seven patterns. They Arrows could be called with the cursor
     up and cursor down keys, too.

THE NSC BUTTON FIELD:
     Here you can edit the currently selected pattern by changing the
     three values using the alternation arrows.The N value determines
     the number  of lines to be affected by  one call to the pattern.
     It can range between 0 and 999.  
     The S value determines which value  is added to the colour every
     time the pattern is executed. Numbers range between -15 and 15.
     Finally the C value determines how often the pattern is executed
     Example: (1,1,15) will  affect 15 (1*15) lines adding  1 to  the
              selected colour component.  If the colour is set to red
              you will see a fade from black to red in 15 lines.
     After the last pattern in the list was executed,the Rainbow will
     restart with the first pattern definition.
     For more  details how this system works  I strongly recommend to
     read the Rainbow section in the AMOS User Guide.


Now you've reached the end of this manual. Maybe some functions sound
strange to you and you don't know how  the whole system of generating
Rainbows is working. Well, I'm sure you will figure it out if you try
all the functions of the program for a few minutes.


Programm history:

  Version 1.0   : Finished at the end of september 1993
                  A few copies released to friends for testing

  Version 1.01  : some bug fixes and cosmetics
  
  Version 1.01d : German version

  

Future enhancements:

  As this is the english version a german version will follow soon!
  
  If I have enough feedback  to this  program I  want to  enhance the
  Cycle option  providing  you  with a  complex animation  edit panel
  which would totally exploit all the AMAL Rainbow Animation features
  
  Another enhancement is a single line editor, which would enable you
  to directly  change  the colour of every  scanline including colour
  spreads and other useful features
  
  And of course all your suggestions.
  
  Look out for the AMOSPro Palette/Fade Accessory coming soon from me! 
   
If you use this program, write me a postcard.If I have enough feedback
this would not be the last release!
