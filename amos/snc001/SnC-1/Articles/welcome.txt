   Congratulations!  You've just gained yourself what will hopefully build up
to be a kewl collection or useful and intresting AMOS source code.  Of course
if you like this disk and wish it to continue support would be most welcomed!

   This disk is aimed at AMOS coders who are already quite good.  The disk is
more  a  collection  of  intresting,  good  and  useful  routines than simple
demonstrations  on how to do basic things.  I will not be doing tutorials for
beginners  or  likewise for advanced coders as I don't have enough spare time
to sit and work on these.  However if someone who is reading this would enjoy
doing  this  please contact me as I will add it to the disk with pleasure and
distribute  it  along  with  the  rest  of  the contents.  I want source code
contained  on  this disk (and future disks) to be by others aswell as myself.
However  I  don't want to just dump any old source code onto the disk as some
of  what I've seen in the Offical AMOS Public Domain Library is complete shit
and I don't want this disk to become a 'shit carrier' as it might be called!

   The  source  will  definetly  be  compatable with AMOS Professioanl and an
Amiga  1200.  I wont be specificly catering for the original AMOS language as
I feel that most serious AMOS coders will, by now, have swapped over to using
AMOS Pro.  You shouldn't have much of an excuse as it was given away recently
on  the  coverdisk  of  Amiga  Format!   Specific  functions  used  from AMOS
Professioanl  will  be the interface language which to my knowledge hasn't be
used  very  much in AMOS coded programs in the public domain.  Maybe this can
be changed in the future with the help of this disk?

   Starting with this - the first ever release - I'm going to bring you every
AMOS Pro extension that is available in the public domain.  I advise that you
install  these  onto your copy of AMOS Professioanl as some of the source may
use one or two commands from these extensions.  Such extensions include Stars
Professional,  JD, Turbo+, LDos Pro and JD Printer.  Also you may like to get
hold of AMOS 3D(AMOS Pro), Craft and MusiCraft which can't be distributed due
to  copyright  reasons.   It would also be a good idea to get your version of
AMOS  Professioanl upto the latest update V2.00 which is sadly only available
with  the AMOS Professional Compiler.  The previous version (V1.12) is freely
available in the public domain.  Having the Pro compiler would also be a good
idea  as  this  is  the  only  way you can compile source code when using the
extensions!

  Enjoy your life...


                                                                    ßudda/NFA
