Here's a short run down of the menu functions...


INDEX
¯¯¯¯¯
The  main  index  page  caan  be scrolled up and down to see the entire list.
When  you  see  something that intrests you simply click on it.  Depending on
what  description  the  choice has one of two things will happen; a text file
will  load for you to read or a demo will be executed.  You can quit from all
demos,  either  by  pressing a mouse/joystick button or if that fails hitting
the ESC key.


VIEWING
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
When a text file is on the screen you can move up/down a single line or jump
straight to the top or bottom of the file.
In future versions of the menu system you will be able to jump to certain
line numbers and search for a specified string in the document.


PRINT
¯¯¯¯¯
At any time you can make a hard copy of the entire page (not just the current
bit on screen) to the printer.  At the moment the menu system can't cope with
all  sorts of errors and may crash out if something bad happens.  If you wish
to  cancel  printing  you will have to put the printer on line then press ESC
immedietely.


MUSIC
¯¯¯¯¯
This can be toggled on and off when you feel it is getting to you.


TV SWITCH
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Although  not tested on a true NTSC system the menu can be switched into NTSC
mode  by  pressing F1.  This will toggle between PAL and NTSC.  Hopefully the
menu  should start in the correct mode but I haven't any way to test this :-(
If  anyone  has  tested  please get in contact with me by post at the address
featured in the read me file in the index menu.
NOTE: In NTSC mode the background colours are not available.

QUIT
¯¯¯¯
To  escape press, err ESCape.  This does a direct quit with no "are you sure"
question.
