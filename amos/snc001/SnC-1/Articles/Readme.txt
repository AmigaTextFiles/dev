Some important notes you may like to know...

When  printing be prepared to see lots of mess were ascii logos are on screen
as  my  printer  doesn't  seem  to handle them very well :-( but your printer
might ??  :-)
                              Printers tested :

                    Citizen 200 Colour 24 Pin Dot Matrix

As  you  may have noticed on the menu button bar - there's a large black gap!
This  will  be  filled  soon  with three buttons.  Then again I might not get
round to it.  Sorry for not having the whole thing working and finished but I
wanted  to  release  the disk as soon as possible and the two buttons omitted
weren't really important.

The  source  code  on  the  disk is aimed at AMOS Professional users although
quite  a bit of the source will be compatable with AMOS Classic.  You will be
very  lucky  if  any of the source will work fine in Easy AMOS but then again
you  shouldn't  be  using Easy AMOS if you are getting this disk!  The source
code is saved in one of the following two ways:-

(1) Plain ascii file.  This has been done so that you can examine the
    source code from the menu index before loading it.  To actually load the
    source into AMOS you simple select `Merge Ascii' from the project menu in
    AMOS Professional.  Or click on the merge ascii button in AMOS classic.

(2) Standard AMOS source code files.  These files will contain data banks
    with graphics/music etc in them.  I find this is the easiest way to move
    the AMOS files around as you don't have to worry about stray data files.
    Some  of  the source files may only be accessed through AMOS Professional
    but  you  should  have this program anyway!  To load simply select `Load'
    from the project menu.

All source code is released to the public domain for use by anyone.  It would
be  VERY  nice if you mention the original coder if you use any of the source
code in your own programs.

Future  release  of  this  disk will not be at set times.  When I have enough
new/good  source  code then I'll compile it together and distribute the disk.
Keep  your  eyes on the NFA boards as this is the first place it will appear.
