     Unfortunately Yahoo store messages in a way which means more than 1 space

     Thanks to Mark de Jong (from the AMOS-LIST) for helping me with rebuilding

     Thanks to Andrew Allen for preserving Peter Cahill's ASCII signiture for

www.darkbasic.com

It's a very similer programming language (infact its almost a rip of) of our old
AMOS, only this time its on PC's and designed for HW 3d cards.

I haven't had time to really play with it, but it seems quite good at first
glance :)

See ya :)

Greetings, all.

Hehe, with all the stir about Darkbasic, I guess I'm off to check it out
(I'm on the page reading about it now). The screenshots I just looked at
look REALLY impressive... who knows? Maybe I'll end up converting the
Dungeon from Cap'n Bubba to Dark Basic! (lol with me) :D

What might work (if clipboard.device uses file notification, which it
should do) is writing the data to the file "CLIPS:01". I think the
data should be an IFF (FTXT, ILBM, 8SVX etc), but I think I did it a
few times with just plain text.

clipboard.device is quite cunning, in that if you copy a large amount,
the data isn't actually copied, the location is stored. Then if you
copy a large amount from a different place only one pointer needs to
change. In reality, most programs will need to copy the data into an
internal buffer anyway, to allow the original to be changed.

I think this is all correct, I'll check on the Developer CD (next
week)

Dark Basic is a threat which must be eliminated as quickly as possible.
It is a evil.... It has already grabbed the minds of three people on
this list. My partner has become completely mesmerized by Dark
Basic's utter simplicity and effectivness.

This all reminds me of the first time I encountered the Allegro library.
Compared to coding stuff in C/C++ on the Amiga.... it is amazing how
much you can do in a few lines of C and a damn good library.... and
speed, wow!! - how about three hundred(300) 64X48 independantly
moving and animating bobs all in 1 Vbl (70fps on PC) on my "old" 1997
133MHz PC? It makes an impression on ya I can guarantee that. :)

I've set up a Dark Basic mailing list, so you can talk about DB there as
much as you want 8)

Send a blank email to darkbasic-subscribe@onelist.com to join up.

After only a few days of fiddling with Dark basic, I already think it's one
of the greatest computer utilities I've ever used. Ranks right up there
with Amos Pro, Photoshop and ICQ.

I'm looking forward to seeing BNG. Blimey, this time last year I was
hunting all over the place for a PC alternative to AMOS, but had no joy at
all, so had to throw myself into designing websites to satisfy my creative
urges. No, however, it seems like there's a whole cluster of programming
languages coming out, all designed with making games in mind. ABOUT TIME!

> Oh that's just great! That makes five now, six if you include me but I

Haha, resistance is futile! It's really true what Keith said about getting
all your creativity back with this package. It's just like the old days,
you can sit at your puter and hammer out something that looks *really*
impressive with very little effort. Seems fast too, the thing is going
like shit off a shovel on my 200mhz machine, with a chronic Permedia 2 card.

My goal for tonight is to work out how to make an undulating matrix, as in
the "Sea" demo.

It's quite simple... a easy way is to use the CLIPS: device.
This is a dirty example, anyway if you need it.... it works! :)

In the GUI V2 threre is the clipboard IN/OUT support with:

A$=Gui Clip Read$ : Rem Read the clipboard

Gui Clip Write$ A$ : Rem Put the string (automatically IFF formatted!) in the
clipboard


But now you can use this:


Open In 1,"CLIPS:0" : Rem Open connection with the clipboard

A$=Input$(1,20) : Rem Read the IFF TXT header!

L=Leek(Varptr(A$)+16) : Rem number on chars in memory

A$=Input$(1,L) : Rem Read all the data in the clipboard!

Close

Print A$



IMPORTANT: ALL the datas stored in the clipboard are in IFF format, and so
you must read and write datas considering this aspect.

I need help for the amigaguide docs....

If you have a good english knowledge and....

1- some TCP/IP knowledge. I won't a internet expert.. just someone who
knows what is a socket and how it works. He'll writes the docs for the new
TCP/IP commands.

2- .FD file knowledge. If you've a clear idea about the .fd files the new FD
Extension builder is waiting you!


If you can help me in one of the above points contact me! And remember..
you must finish before Christmas! :))

Hehe.. a bit late :) anyway this is the answer...

.... a good oppurtunity to use a FD Extenion with the dos.library
and exec.library functions inside.

Example:

A$="HD0:"

S=Lvo AllocVec(256,0) : Rem We need some memory......

L=Lvo Lock(Varptr(A$),-2) : Rem We LOCK the wanted device!

If L

I=Lvo Info(L,S) : Rem .. and here we get the needed informations.

If I

BB=Leek(S+20) : Rem Bytes per block
NB=Leek(S+12) : Rem Number of blocks
BU=Leek(S+16) : Rem Number of used blocks

Print "Total Space = "+Str$(NB*BB)
Print "Space Used = "+Str$(BU*BB)


End If

End If

A=Lvo FreeVec(S) : A=Lvo UnLock(L)

That isn't safe - you don't know that there won't be extra IFF
hunks in the file, you really need to parse the IFF properly
otherwise you could get loads of binary data by mistake.

Making PC Games like AMOS games

Thu Dec 2, 1999 3:59 pm
"Alastair Murray" <Alastair.Murray@ukgateway.net>


Theres a lot of people talking about how hard it was to find a good language
on the PC to move to from AMOS.

Allegro - errm. A bit out of date and unneccassary in these DirectX days if
you ask me.

If you really want to make AMOS type games (and by that I mean 2D but about
a thousand times faster) then get hold of a book like Windows Game
Programming for Dummies (amazon has it).
Get Visual C++ and you're away.

I'd always thought it would take sooo much longer to do stuff in C++ than
AMOS but its not quite true. Getting initial graphics routines up and going
takes longer (but that book will cut the time down to nothing) but once that
is done everything else can be added just as quickly plus you have far more
control.

As for this new language for AMIGA (he says doubtingly). AMIGA is so far
behind now that unless this language runs on PPC + GFX card as standard it
won't be much better than AMOS.

People talk about AMOS lacking AGA. But think about it for a minute. AMOS is
very slow with non-AGA. Using AGA would have been painfully slow.

That was a few mixed up badly worded comments but I just got out of bed :)

This exactly where a good library like Win/Allegro saves you loads of
time. If someone is only used to AMOS programming then learning C/C++
alone is enough to put on them.... it makes sense to use the commands
that are already available which allow super fast, incredibly easy
sprites, scaling, rotation, etc, etc.

I am not knocking C or C++ as they are my favourite languages.
You are absolutely right that they give you far more control but I get
the impression that most AMOS users actually don't want far more control
as that means more work required to produce the end result.
AMOS offers little work for large result.
Again, using a library like Allegro will bring you very similiar results.

If you read all of the posts abut Dark Basic you will find one recurring
theme.... the language makes it so simple to produce a lot of result
for a little work. There is no way messing around with the Win32 API
or DirectX will be as simple and uncluttered as using Dark Basic,
AMOS, or C and Allegro.

Anybody know a program that will successfully grab ABK pac.pic pictures
from a compiled AMOSPro exe? Im trying to get at some of the graphics on my
older games, and unfortunately no longer have the original code. If anyone
knows a util that works, please feel free to email it to me. Thanks.

I don't see the point of making Amos type games on the PC. The PC from what
I can see doesn't have a PD/SW community like the Amiga does. Have any of
you seen an AmiNet equvialent for the PC? I know I haven't. All I've seen
for the PC's PD/SW seen is demos of commercial games, and over priced utils
like CPUKiller (I payed $14.95 for Wing Commander Prophecy Gold that's 3
CD people. I'm not going to pay more for a CPU Killer). The PC isn't a
community it's a sterile heartless leach on the human sole, and I don't
see why anyone would want to create anything Amiga like on the PC, and if
you did who would ever see it floating out in the wasteland that is PC PD/SW.
I want a Powerful easy to use Basic for the Amiga, and the new Amiga
hopefully a multi-PPC IBM PoP board with 2 32Mb AGP Savage4 boards, and a
PCI SB Live board, runing H&P's PPC Amiga DOS port. So stop playing with
DarkBasic, and get BNG ready for the Amiga community to make some new Amiga
magic.

when doom was released, ID made sure everyone had it. You forget how many
BBS there are out there, and I could name 10 of them that still churn out
megs of PC stuff every day. The PC shareware/PD scene is just as strong,
though isn't concentrated at one particular spot.

ZDnet have a humongus area for downloads etc. too, as well as many others.

Yes, Mush is absolutely correct about this.

http://www.winsite.com might be considered the equivalent of
Aminet but that is a difficult thing to assign as the PC has
dozens of Aminet like sites.

Shareware is as strong as ever and there is plenty of Freeware
on the PC too. The only reason you find less percentage of
FREEWARE is because it is far easier to sell your software and
at least make a few $$ on the PC.

I actually have not had a chance to try DarkBasic yet so am not dabbling
with it at all yet! If I know Keith, he will have completely exhausted
DB within a week or two and will return with many great ideas for BNG.

BNG project is still being dabbled with. Wednesday I finished the core
file routines and task initialization. Next step will be getting the
VCPU back to the point where it is executing the example program.
This time everything has been designed and planned out ahead so we
have plenty of room for future expansion. Multiple data (variable)
types, data statements, and the ability to tack on binary data at the
end of the executable, etc. have been handled in our new version.

What will be great will be not only seeing the example code run again
but this time having 3, 4 or even 64 copies of it running at the same
time! I am looking forward to seeing that!! Hahahahaha!! :-)

The PC has some decent share/free ware, if you look for it. If you look at
just one site, then forget it.

The one thing I can't stand about aminet, is the fact there is so much crap
on there. Just how many workbench clocks can one guy use?!?!? Its even
worse when the description says : Short: a clock for workbench

Almost all the PC software sites have a decent description and usually
pictures too.

don't get me wrong, aminet has some damn usefull stuff on it, just needs to
be "weeded" a bit, hehe

Chris Hodges has created such program, but now i don't find it on my HD.
Anyway AMOS saves the banks as separate hunks in the executable. So if you
find a program able to split the hunks of a executable file, you can easly
obtain your abk banks.

Sure... i've said that my example was a stupid example. Anyway it works
most ot the times, because only few applications store the text using
several CHRS chunks (Wordworth for example...).

As suggested the support in the GUI V2 is much better, because it performs all
the needed controls and IFF parsing.

I have one somewhere. I think its called ripit. You prolly could find
it on aminet.

I do agree that some aminet files need better descriptions,
and people who don't supply a long desc (or those who seem to think that a file
list of the archive is a suitable substitute for a long desc) should be forced
to write a
4 page analysis of their upload in 15 different languages...

However...

By the time you track down and finish d/l'ing what you were looking for on a pc
(assuming some new virus doesn't demolish your files/harddrive/bios before the
virus
killer brainfile gets updated), you can download
and test all archives that even remotely look like what you want on
aminet,write a review for each of them ,assemble 40
different scale models of the titanic and make a Cordon Bleu dinner for 12 :)

And wheras multiple choices of programs on aminet usually means every archive
has a
different approach to doing what it does, most pc shareware/freeware you try are
nearly
identical, with slightly different graphics maybe and some bugfixing or 0.01%
size reduction thrown in if you're
lucky...

To most pc users that's pretty normal tho, just like apps that demand insane
amount of resources to do marginally better jobs than their previous version,
or formatting the entire harddrive and reinstalling windows :)

(offended pc-defenders may select a few vital configuration files ,press
shift+delete
and reboot.:)


I realize a peecee is better at some things(only because it's more
widespread and so has had more money
spent on it, and because some things simply are pc standards) and I have to use
them, but I
don't have to like the (overall) inferior piece of £%&$þ±ð :)

Is it possible to set the CPU priority for the music, or the

I don't think you can set the frequency of XM mods, and changing the CPU
priority would make the sound horribly choppy.

What I reckon you'll have to do is convert it to an octamed mix module
somehow, because the octamed mix commands have selectable buffers and
frequencies etc.

ElectroCAD in Amos?

I started to write a comprehensive electronics program for the Amiga in Amos
last year when I only found the CLI operated SPICE. I got as far as a

stuck
on the lack of literature available to calculate the main Matrix.
Anyone here into electronics and would like to lend a hand?

AMOS MASTER DEVELOPERS CHALLENGE #1

Sun Dec 5, 1999 3:35 am
"GarfieldAtWork" <garfield@dtgrp.com>


Hello All.

In yet another attempt to bring life to this list we have returned with the
all new AMOS MASTER DEVELOPERS CHALLENGE proudly conceived and
implemented by yours truly and Keith (aka Braneloc).
Mush, Giark and other elders may be involved in the administration of these
challenges but do not know it yet. hahahahaha!!

Here is your challenge for the week ending December 11, 1999:
Create a procedure to generate a 3D "realistic" tree.
Display it in isometric view.
Keith says to you can use plot commands if you like.
Also, you don't need to do full texture mapping and real time rotation
unless you really feel a strong desire to do so..
All we want is a routine which can be called with various arguments such
as xorigin, yorigin, width, height. etc and will produce a 3D "realistic"
tree.

Okay, this is a "real world" problem.
AMOS is completely capable of allowing you to design and code a solution.
You have been the victims of the All New AMOS MASTER DEVELOPERS CHALLENGE.

RULES:
There are no wrong answers.
Good Luck.

Problems with FD extension

Sun Dec 5, 1999 12:06 pm
Marco Vettorello <marcoegon@tiscalinet.it>


Hi guyz,

I've installed FD extension 2.0 with some usefull libraries such as :
FileId.library, SysInfo.library (part of Executive).

FileId and SysInfo needed to create a struct to be filled.

With FileId I use:

s=lvo fiallocfileinfo()

if s : rem s is the address of the requested structure

print "struct created"
e=lvo fifreefileinfo(s) : rem i remove the structure
end

else

Print "cannot create structure!"
end

end if

The only thing i can see is a guru when the function fiallocfileinfo() is
called.

The same with SysInfo library (the function is InitSysInfo() ).

Ah, FileID and SysInfo are correctly installed, they work with other programs.
And this make me crazy!

What's my error?

Ok I'm done ;)

It took about an hour and a half, and it's not actually that bad, it can
handle two moderatly complex vector trees rotating in real time at about 0.7 FPS
on my 040 amiga :0

Obviously I cant sent the source, it would defeat the point of the compo, so
can I send the exe to the list? It's only about 60k (if not who do I send it
to? :)

See ya :)

Here goes :)

Simply run it, and it'll go through a little demo routine.

The tree's look slightly more realistic at a much higher detail level, but they
take a little long to render to be impressive :)

1. Pure enjoyment you will experience from tackling the challenges.
2. Experience you will gain as you tackle the challenges.
3. Showing off what you can do.... a bit of recognition for your skills.
4. The "coolest" solutions may be used as the foundation of new
commands in the BNG language.
5. We are thinking that each month we would give out some kind of
prize to the authors of the "coolest" solutions.

Amiga software, books, magazines, and of course cash would
seem like fair prizes.

Ideas are welcome. :-)

Excellent. Congratulations on being the first to accept.
You actually have until next Saturday so unless you want to tweak
your solution I guess you have the week off with pay. ;-)

Along those lines, an AMOS MASTER DEVELOPERS CHALLENGE
website could be setup. Yes, this would be a good idea.

Oh, by the way, there is one rule now.
Your source needs to be reasonably clean, which means:
Some documentation (ie. ' or Rems) would be nice.
Variable names should carry some significance.

In other words, strive for what is known as self-documenting code.

As the final code will posted on the AMDC website each month, giving
YOU, the author, full credit of course we would like for all AMOS
programmers to be able to appreciate your solution and understand
how to use your routines in their own programs.

The ideal submission would be something along the line of the
following example, which just happens to be the way I write code
as well as the way I would like my team to write it (of course, what
you want is not always what you get and sometimes someone actually
has a cool trick that you can learn from so I hate to stifle creativity).

Anyway, here is one example:

/*====================================================================*\
| NAME: CENTER_TEXT( string )                                          |
| PURPOSE: Displays the text string horizontally centered on the line. |
| ACCEPTS: A string (which is a friendlier term for a char* )          |
| RETURNS: NOTHING ( void )                                            |
| AUTHOR: Garfield Benjamin                                            |

| NOTES: Adjust the value assigned to LINEWIDTH as needed.             |
| Normally should be eighty(80) characters.                            |
\*====================================================================*/
void CENTER_TEXT( string TEXT )
{
const int LINEWIDTH = 80;
int TEXTWIDTH = strlen( TEXT );
int SPACESNEEDED = ( LINEWIDTH - TEXTWIDTH ) / 2;
int SPACESPRINTED;

for ( SPACESPRINTED = 0; SPACESPRINTED < SPACESNEEDED; SPACESPRINTED++ )
putchar( ' ' );

printf( "%s\n", TEXT );
}

Is it ok if all the nasty looking code is locked away in self-explanitory
procedures? :)

By the way, for the compo, I've released a compiled version for show, but I
have to email you guys the source as well right? To check I haven't cheated and
used ASM etc. to do it? ;)

Of course, the "review" of each challenge "product" could be the good
part, for example
Uses 3D rotation
3D rendering isometric
Hidden line removal
zbuffer sorting
Looks cool on the screen
good well documented code
well optimised
good use of fractals

Could be the "review" of your code... There are many ways to solve
the same problem, and many of us will use a completely different
approach. The challenges will be designed to be interesting, and
achievable. Making it look like you have done something really
spectacular when you havn't really is totally approved.

Self-explanatory procedures are an important part of
self-documenting code. :-)

Yes, if your code is modularized, broken down into easily
understood tasks which are wrapped inside procedures,
it should be quite easy to follow.

No errors.. it's a problem of the FD Extensions Builder. Anyway the real
problem is the bad attitude to use mixed case names for a library! By
default ALL the libraries names should be lowercase and not mixed case like
SysInfo.library and FileID.library.

The FD Extensions Builder works using the standard way, and so the
extension created will try to open the sysinfo.library and fileid.library,
but this operation fails because it's case sensitive... sysinfo and SysInfo
are not the same thing :(

I've fixed the problem (...and others) in the FD Builder 3.1 included in
the AMOSPro Phoenix distribution.


Another of your question..... the ams program doesn't works when the
OsDevKit extension is installed because this extension change the AMOS task
name into "OsDevKit by TMG" (in order to fix...badly... the Amos programs
multitasking problem) , and so ams isn't able to find it. I'll send to the
list the updated version of the ams program.... don't worry it's 100 bytes
:)

Well... I have also noticed some slow down when AMOS running (only about 10% -
not as much as what you talk about)

Try to make this little accessory

Amos To Back
Repeat
Multi Wait
Until Amos Here
Edit

and put it on a hotkey.

To set amos to back, run the accessory. To set amos to front use amiga-a.
(haven't tried it. Should work)
A program running a tight multiwaiting loop eats NO cpu-time.

Hi!

This is the new version of the little Ams program .This small prg allows you to
put Amos to front from the CLI when for some reasons it's locked to back, and so
Amiga-A doesn't works.

AMOS: The FULL story

Mon Dec 6, 1999 6:35 pm
Pietro Ghizzoni <ghizzo@agonet.it>


Hi!

Considering the Christmas period, is time to read a nice fable :)


In this message you'll find the FULL AMOS story.... past,present and future.
It's boring and long, anyway read it because it explains a lot of things :)

Some words about the upgrade... i've said it before... due to the unflexibility
of the Amos sources and its design i've concentrated the work on our extensions
because they are based on a more recent and OS friendly code. I'm sorry, but
display a Amos screen with a gfx card is
impossible. The direct hardware access system used by Amos needs to be totally
rewritten... an upgrade is not enough.

/I can add AGA support/, but it doesn't works with the gfx cards

/I can add AGA support/, but all your extensions, and so your programs, doesn't
works anymore because if i modify the internal Amos structures all the
extensions needs to be reassembled, but since the development of the 99% of them
is stopped and most of the sources are lost it's a real problem.

/I can add AGA support/, but i just waste my few time... and the AGA support
involve a lot of rewriting (80% of the amos.library should be rewritten for AGA
and AGA bobs support!).

I'm sorry, but the custom Amos AGA screen dream is not a reality.... as you know
in the past years other developers has tried to upgrade Amos, but nothing is
happened... just rumors. They have left the project because their interest was
the money... no AGA upgrade = no money. My target is not the money and so *i
won't give up!* I've wanted the AMOSPro sources in order to give it a new
oppurtunity. If i cannot upgrade the main code due to its old structure, there
is another way.. the extensions. Hopefully Amos is modular, and so i can add new
functions and replace the old ones.

You'll be able to open AGA and gfx card compatible screens, but in the OS
friendly way.

Since this seems to be the only way, i've contacted the most famous extensions
coders, created the development group, and decided to release our updated
extensions together, as an upgrade.

Our add-on package gives you about 1.000 new functions(!!) and cover all the
aspects of AmigaOS. Yes....AmigaOS... our first target is to offer a complete OS
support, since Amos doesn't
supports it in any way. *Today the OS way is the only one acceptable!*

Your AGA & Gfx Card output is the OSDevKit and the GUI Extension.... there is no
bobs support at the moment, but i can promise you that i'll add it to the GUI
Extension.

Unfortunately Peter Cahill has stopped the development of /The Game Extension/
due to the several criticisms about the GMS :((( There is only a beta version
available on the AMOS Factory site.

With all the extensions together the AMOS functions will be boosted, and the
creation of professional and OS friendly applications is possible.

Now you've a clear (... i hope) idea about the AMOS present, now is time to
finally explain all the past story of AMOS and its sources. Untill the 1993 you
already know everything..... what happened later? The major problem has been the
Commodore situation. This fact has definitively
killed the Amos/Amiga support. After the release of AMOSPro V2 the development
has been stopped mainly for 2 reasons:

1- AMOSPro needs to be rewritten in order to support AGA and the several
times promised intuition support and OS integration.

2- Considering the above problem and the decision to go into the PC market due
to the Amiga/Commodore situation. Spend time and resources in a project for a
"died" computer is not commercially convenient, and so they had ask Francois
Lionet to create something like AMOS for the PC ( the original name was PCOS :)
.....Click'n'Play is borned and Amos is died :(


Anyway AMOS was again a really diffused software, and so other developers has
tried to get its sources in order to continue the development... but they have
failed and the AMOS sources has been forgotten in a directory of the Francois's
HD for years. The most recent attempt has been made by Chris Hodges (the AMCAF
extension author) about 3 years ago... he was very near to the AMOS sources, but
suddenly the transaction is failed without a real reason.

And again the AMOS sources are come back in the limbo for years, when finally in
the 1997 i've found the Francois Lionet e-mail address.. WOW.. i was very happy.
Several messages, and requests.. when finally (..after almost *1 year!!!!*)
solved most of the legal problems around the Amos sources release, in the 1998
i've signed the contract and the NDA (non-disclosure agreement). I've received a
nice Zip Disk will all the AMOS The Creator and AMOSPro sources inside. I will
always remember that day.. probably one of the most cool days of my life :)

Well.... i've the sources but i'm not the AMOS owner.. the copyright is always
Francois Lionet/Click Team. *They are* the legal AMOS owner, i've just obtained
the license to use the sources.

Now you know the story.... after long delays the final release is coming.

I've spent all my few(!!!!) time on this project, and i think to have select the
right way in order to give to AMOS a new opportunity.


The future.... only God knows :) YOU are the future! If you use Amos, it will
never die! I'll always support my extensions and tools... always!


Marry Christmas!

Seems reasonable.
With extensions you can add support for anything you wanted.
One thousand new functions.... :)

Hardly surprising.... it seems like every cool sounding project

You obviously hold a deep burning passion for Amos. :-)

Yes. But one, if I'm correct WinAllegro is still beta, and two, having a
wrap around for DirectX is getting close to having a wrap around for AMOS.
:)

Well maybe not quite that bad but DX is so simple that the only wrap arounds
you need are simplet things like plotting pixels, drawing lines etc.

I guess its just the control thing mostly though. I really don't think its
that hard to learn C++ and DirectX if you know AMOS. Its the methods you use
to make games not the languages that are the main problem. Poor methods =
Slow games on any platform.

Oh yes. Dark Basic certainly makes 3D games MUCH easier to make, but for 2D
I think DirectX is easy enough.

Its just a shame Dark Basic uses such an awfully dated interface.

Maybe Dark Basic Pro will help. :)

AMOS and WB3.5

I recently released a couple of old AMOS games I had had on my Hard Drive
for a few years.

One of them, Turtleminator (on aminet game/shoot) is causing problems with
WB3.5

mathtrans.library is v44.40 on WB3.5
v37 on my 3.0 WB

My game apparently doesn't like the v44.4 library.
I use various extensions so I don't know if its one of them or certain
inbuilt AMOS commands.

Any chance of a fix or something?

Thanks,

Have not seen/used it yet but it sounds very interesting.
I am having too much fun at the moment creating the PC version of the
BNG Game Library which is sitting on top of DOS Allegro at the moment and
needs to be Win compiled soon. By building on top of a well established
library which is as full featured as Allegro3.9 it is easy to make some
very powerful commands such as the ColorBar and Border commands I created
last night. :-)

This is a cool kinda challenge, and, also something I need for a routine im
working on. I've tried it, and can't quite get it right.

I want to be able to manually plot all of the pixels in between 2 points,
in a curve, kinda like an ellipse. Has to be called by specifying 2 sets of
coordinates, and possibly the extremity of the ellipse to be drawn (how far
the curve sticks out). The winner will get, erm, one of these beers. hehe

(amos-list] AMOS MASTER DEVELOPERS CHALLENGE #2: Math Problem

Tue Dec 7, 1999 5:21 pm
"GarfieldAtWork" <garfield@dtgrp.com>


>This is a cool kinda challenge, and, also something I need for a
>routine im working on. I've tried it, and can't quite get it right.

Ah, a submission for a new AMOS MASTER DEVELOPERS CHALLENGE.
Great!! We need to formalize this. ;)


AMOS MASTER DEVELOPERS CHALLENGE #2
Here is your second challenge for the week ending December 11, 1999:
Create a spline procedure which manually plots all of the pixels
in a specified curve between 2 points.
The procedure should accept four coordinates(x1,y1, x2,y2), the
size of the curve(arc) and the color of the spline.

RULES:
1. Everything is to completely support the "black box" concept,
meaning a person does not need to understand how your procedure
works only what the inputs are and how they effect the result.

2. Document your source code and use good naming conventions in an
attempt to make your solution as easy to understand as possible
for those people who are interested in the implementation details.

3. Have fun, be creative, be as unorthodox as needed.

Um, guys, it's already been done: Check out this example that came with the
AmosPro Compiler :)

Done but only one solution. However, I see your point.
Probably would make more sense to come up with another
challenge.... still though technically speaking, you have solved
yet another. Finding a solution does not necessarily mean you need
to create one from scratch. ;)


>PS.Hows the first challenge coming along?

First challenge is coming along great.
Your solution was quite excellent.

No website yet.... as usual Keith and I have too many projects going
on at once.
We are hoping that some ambitious person will volunteer to do about
50% of the maintenance. :-)

Hello there. :)

The last I heard (and I really should not speak for the development
team) the guys who were dabbling with the BNG project had become so
busy with other things they no longer had any time to spend on BNG.

I heard rumors that after Dark Basic was mentioned on this list it
became a source of great distraction for at least one member of the
development team. It is thought that after the completion of a
Holo-projection system he will return to dabbling with BNG.

I also heard that one of the guys is incredibly busy at work completing
a large scale project which has a target date of December 31st.
It is thought that after the end of the year he will return to dabbling
with BNG.

Another rumor states that when the developers tested their ideas and
had undeniable proof of the ease of the BNG project, they lost interest
due to the lack of any real challenge.

Of course, these rumors are uncomfirmed. :)

Subject: [amos-list] AMOS: The FULL story




Hi!

Considering the Christmas period, is time to read a nice fable :)


In this message you'll find the FULL AMOS story.... past,present and future.
It's boring and long, anyway read it because it explains a lot of things :)

Some words about the upgrade... i've said it before... due to the
unflexibility of the Amos sources and its design i've concentrated the work
on our extensions because they are based on a more recent and OS friendly
code. I'm sorry, but display a Amos screen with a gfx card is
impossible. The direct hardware access system used by Amos needs to be
totally rewritten... an upgrade is not enough.

/I can add AGA support/, but it doesn't works with the gfx cards

/I can add AGA support/, but all your extensions, and so your programs,
doesn't works anymore because if i modify the internal Amos structures all
the extensions needs to be reassembled, but since the development of the 99%
of them is stopped and most of the sources are lost it's a real problem.

/I can add AGA support/, but i just waste my few time... and the AGA support
involve a lot of rewriting (80% of the amos.library should be rewritten for
AGA and AGA bobs support!).

I'm sorry, but the custom Amos AGA screen dream is not a reality.... as you
know in the past years other developers has tried to upgrade Amos, but
nothing is happened... just rumors. They have left the project because their
interest was the money... no AGA upgrade = no money. My target is not the
money and so *i won't give up!* I've wanted the AMOSPro sources in order to
give it a new oppurtunity. If i cannot upgrade the main code due to its old
structure, there is another way.. the extensions. Hopefully Amos is modular,
and so i can add new functions and replace the old ones.

You'll be able to open AGA and gfx card compatible screens, but in the OS
friendly way.

Since this seems to be the only way, i've contacted the most famous
extensions coders, created the development group, and decided to release our
updated extensions together, as an upgrade.

Our add-on package gives you about 1.000 new functions(!!) and cover all the
aspects of AmigaOS. Yes....AmigaOS... our first target is to offer a
complete OS support, since Amos doesn't
supports it in any way. *Today the OS way is the only one acceptable!*

Your AGA & Gfx Card output is the OSDevKit and the GUI Extension.... there
is no bobs support at the moment, but i can promise you that i'll add it to
the GUI Extension.

Unfortunately Peter Cahill has stopped the development of /The Game
Extension/ due to the several criticisms about the GMS :((( There is only a
beta version available on the AMOS Factory site.

With all the extensions together the AMOS functions will be boosted, and the
creation of professional and OS friendly applications is possible.

Now you've a clear (... i hope) idea about the AMOS present, now is time to
finally explain all the past story of AMOS and its sources. Untill the 1993
you already know everything..... what happened later? The major problem has
been the Commodore situation. This fact has definitively
killed the Amos/Amiga support. After the release of AMOSPro V2 the
development has been stopped mainly for 2 reasons:

1- AMOSPro needs to be rewritten in order to support AGA and the several
times promised intuition support and OS integration.

2- Considering the above problem and the decision to go into the PC market
due to the Amiga/Commodore situation. Spend time and resources in a project
for a "died" computer is not commercially convenient, and so they had ask
Francois Lionet to create something like AMOS for the PC ( the original name
was PCOS :) .....Click'n'Play is borned and Amos is died :(


Anyway AMOS was again a really diffused software, and so other developers
has tried to get its sources in order to continue the development... but
they have failed and the AMOS sources has been forgotten in a directory of
the Francois's HD for years. The most recent attempt has been made by Chris
Hodges (the AMCAF extension author) about 3 years ago... he was very near to
the AMOS sources, but suddenly the transaction is failed without a real
reason.

And again the AMOS sources are come back in the limbo for years, when
finally in the 1997 i've found the Francois Lionet e-mail address.. WOW.. i
was very happy. Several messages, and requests.. when finally (..after
almost *1 year!!!!*) solved most of the legal problems around the Amos
sources release, in the 1998 i've signed the contract and the NDA
(non-disclosure agreement). I've received a nice Zip Disk will all the AMOS
The Creator and AMOSPro sources inside. I will always remember that day..
probably one of the most cool days of my life :)

Well.... i've the sources but i'm not the AMOS owner.. the copyright is
always Francois Lionet/Click Team. *They are* the legal AMOS owner, i've
just obtained the license to use the sources.

Now you know the story.... after long delays the final release is coming.

I've spent all my few(!!!!) time on this project, and i think to have select
the right way in order to give to AMOS a new opportunity.


The future.... only God knows :) YOU are the future! If you use Amos, it
will never die! I'll always support my extensions and tools... always!


Marry Christmas!

I knew I was not the only one who goes after what is supposed to
be a grand challenge and then after proving (to myself) that it is
not only possible but actually easy it is like "great, now it
is time to go after some other thing that supposedly cannot be
done". On the positive side it keeps us on our toes 'cause we
are always testing ourselves.... on the downside, we have a mass
of "proofs" serving no real purpose. LOL!

There has been a lot of adventure games written but most are a bit poo. I
took up the challenge of making one but I got board and took up the
challenge of making a O.S which was okay. my challenge now is to make a 3d
environment so any one which could help me please mail me!

GHOST;


From: "patrick Wesseling" <p_wesseling@hotmail.com>

Has anyone ever written a adventure game in Amos. I like to know. I love
playing these games. Maybe I take up the challange to write one myself. Do
to work and study I don't think it's a good idea if I commit myself to long
term projects. But he, my 3 weeks of holiday is comming up starting monday
27 december. I think I am the only "computer specialist" that will not be
"standby" for the milennium! On the other hand, I haven't had a decent
holiday in years!

A dude named Edmund Clay made a program called GRAC (written in amospro)
which lets you create graphic adventure games very easily. If done
properly, they were really great, such as Relics 2 and the new TWOM2 game
which im almost ready to publish (waiting for some bits).

For more info & screenshots of the game, go to
http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/twom2.html

If you, (or anyone else) decide to go for this I know someone who could write a
hilarious script
for the game. Contact me if you are interested and I will ask him.
Seriously, his humour is just like Monkey Island and he can write very well.

Seems to me for the 'magic' to work it requires good graphics and a good
interesting story with puzzles. The Music MUST NOT be boring.

What an idea!! It seems so reasonable.... unfortunately, while
the main menu and majority of the individual game stages have been
finished for a couple years now, I think the animators and musicians
disappeared before finishing the animations needed for the story flow.

Yeah, hehe. I got my "morphing" hi-score table bit in and submitted just a
few weeks after the project started, hehe. Blame the animators! I do
remember one guy, who was a friend of someone on here, never actually
submitted anything that I can recall, hehe.

Sort of; *Monkey Island meets Highlander!* or *Search for the Holy Whatsit*
It would give plenty of opportunities for different scenes, characters and

Humour could be obtained at the expense of historical figures; Napoleon,

GO! GO!! GO!!!

Time travel opens up so many cool possibilities.

You can even make it so you are going both back in time and then maybe
far into the future and then back to present day.

Underwater is a cool twist too. But, being thrust into the Wild West
in a showdown with Billy the Kid would be kind of awesome too.

So many ideas, so little time. At any rate, good luck!!

I write some music every now and then, usually tunes lasting about 3 mins,
probably about 300k with loads of samples, definitely not boring. I might
be persuaded to write some smaller tunes for some people's games - give me
a length (time), and a size (kB), and a vague style (eg 110 bpm vicious
melodic hard-step chamber-music;) and I'll see what I can do...

All you have to do is 'see if you can do it'.

Create a completed product.

Proofs is easy its sticking through with a project to the end thats the real
challenge.

I challenged myself a while back, to see if I could make AMOSPro do some
decent OS code for a change, and created a decent net app called
MPDMailpost. For a brief description and pics, see:

Turbo Invaders, Star Strike 2000, the CBATNAM SideShooter Stage,
My Map Editor, Enemy Motion Designer and Auto Image Grabber Utilites
are examples of some things completed in just in AMOS.

Oops... Turbo Invaders was written in BLITZ.

Anyway, of course sometimes you get bored with mastering technologies
and want to use what you know so you complete some project.

Actually, it all depends on the individual.
The challenge for me is in finding a project which is interesting
enough so that I want to allot the necessary time to complete it.
The only solution I have found is to focus on speed.... to attempt to
complete the project as rapidly as possible. For my Side Shooter stage
of the CBATNAM project I actually spent 52 days in order to complete a
few development tools and the stage itself. That is a lot of time to me.
Because my time is very valuable when starting some project I tell
myself, "okay, here is what I would like to do and here is the maximum
amount of time I am willing to spend."
When I have exhausted the alloted time(normally 1 - 10 days) the project
is done. (Occasionally, I do set longer time frames such as 60 days but
never more than that as even 60 days may easily translate into six months
of real world time).

An obvious exception is the CBATNAM project. Because I was working on a
piece of a much larger project, my time was magnified in a sense. Each of
those 2-4 hour days of work on my stage translated into 10-20 hours of
time on the full CBATNAM project. It was a much better time investment.

CBATNAM was one of the most enjoyable projects I have been involved in
and I would not hesitate to do another project with Keith, Giark, Andy,
Mush, James, PAC and Adam (if we can keep those damn artists and
musicians working).

Yeah, time is the problem. As long as no one on the list is expecting
anything this side of the millennium, then I'm sure I could give it a
go in January. That'd get Christmas and the New Year festivities out
of the way, and give me a couple of weeks to get my thinking head on

Who cares, you found this uncommercial failure and you thought of

Yeah, I'll have a go at it. I'll make it my New Years resolution. And
here's the killer irony. I've never played *any* of the Monkey Island
games ! Never even seen them, other than as screenshots in the Amiga
press. I do have Simon the Sorceror (and I still haven't given it more
than half an hour of playing time. It looks great, but Clickboom went
and released Quake and that was that, I've been in shoot 'em up heaven
ever since) The one graphic adventure game I have taken to my bosom
and played from start to finish is Flight of the Amazon Queen, which I
love to bits. But I don't want to go over old ground do I ? I need to
be original, and vibrant, like an electric cucumber.

Yes. January 2000. I'LL DO IT !!!

Would it be a great idea to setup a website to promote Amos? I know there
are allready some Amos sites, but this one could be special.

Some things that should be present on the website:

- are names, interests, and current projects so that if you need music
or a coder for special things you know who to contact.

- manuals, courses and all of that learning stuff.

Well you fill in the rest...............

I just want to promote Amos and offcourse the Amiga. The gathering off all
Amos users. Maybe there isn't a single soul that likes this idea but he you
can't blame a person for trying.

p.s. I know there was a person (or more) that had programmed a
James Bond game. I think it was You only live twice. Has anyone got the url
of that site? Sorry to hear that Desmond Llewelyn (Q) has died in a car

Graphic Adventure

Mon Dec 20, 1999 10:04 pm
Neil Ives <neil.ives@btinternet.com>


Hi, AMOSians

I'm interested in this graphic adventure game but inexperienced in programming.

It seems to me that the programming part mainly needs a 'scene engine'.
Something like a toy theatre, backdrop graphics and bobs to be inserted as
required.

Object detection is required for interaction.

I guess screen scrolling would be essential, I'm thinking of the early bits of
Monkey Island where Guybrush walks on from the left and the scenery scrolls
across.

Items collected by the character could be stored in an array so they can be put
down
and picked up when required. The array could be read to display icons of the
objects held.

Good graphics are going to be needed for backgrounds and bobs. Has anyone
got the talent and dedication to produce MANY graphic items? This is going
to be very important. Once a format is decided on, other people may be able
to copy the style to help get things moving.

Scene 'depth' seems to be a possible problem, when the character walks away from
us the
graphics must look good as he gets smaller/bigger. Even Monkey Island was a
bit rough doing that.

Animated 'cut' scenes are a nice touch to move from one scene to another.

Seems to me a good strong story line is essential before any other work starts.

Logic puzzles are essential of course.

As I said before the music must be very carefully chosen to be interesting
and it must be possible to turn it off.

Anyone got any advice about all this?
Anyone interested in getting involved?

Catcha later

Hiya

I noticed all you peeps talking about creating an adventure game in
AMOSPRO, and no-one has said anything about (IMHO) the best graphics
adventure engine created via AMOSPRO, Graal. This progy was written via
AMOSPRO by Per Thulin a couple of years ago. He had included in his a
scripting language to make the whole work of making an adventure game

you just had to add the importaint bits. maybe you could see if you can
borrow his code since he has changed platforms and is converting it to JAVA.

Yeh, but the idea behind this is to write a Kewl adventure without the use
of authoring tools like Grac or graal or wotever else is festering in the

Absolutely, i am very interested in being involved, as far as the
coding goes anyways. But for this thing to even have half a chance of
getting of the ground, we need some project management right? We need
to assemble a group of coders, a group of storyboarders , some
graphics artists, then each seperate group can go away and discuss the
final details of whatever. We need a central point to report
progress, issues etc, and perhaps a common meeting point were we can
chat about things live(IRC). Lets get some direction and have good
old stab at it, count me in for the programming.

Got my vote dude! Lets do this, enthusiasm seems to be up. Wonder
what would be the best time to organise meetings online, given all our
time zones. Also, probably we can't expect much from people until the
new year, tis the festive season and all.

"patrick Wesseling" <p_wesseling@hotmail.com>


Now I am able to acces E-mail at home to! I always acces my E-mail at work
but these days with offcourse the things that we do right now for Amos I
wanted to be able to acces my E-mail at home! The only thing a had to do was
getting a telephonewire up to my "think-tank". Toghether with my father we
managed to do that.
...... so far this useless (but importent to me) information


I think there should be 1 person that does all of the uploading to the
website. Offcourse there can be millions of other people that provide
information or a page etc. To avoid chaos there should be 1 person that
uploads all of this. But there could be a assistent or backup in case the
webmaster is unable to perform his duties.

Like a mentioned in one of my previous e-mails a have some "contacts"
with a dutch Amiga Magazine called Amiga Scene. Through them I can reach
other Amiga-Amos fans. They could maybe publish reviews about programs that
we created. Maybe one of you has "contacts" with a magazine in another
country?

On the website should also be profiles of us. What we do, wich country
we live, do we program/make music/paint etc.

Also we could map all the software written in Amos. A bit impossible but we
could try to do as many as we can.

Alltough it will be a Amos related site it would not hurt to put some
info on it about the Amiga.


----- These are just ideas, feel free to comment or suggust other
things! ------

p.s. Don't think less of me because I use a PC with Windows to acces
my E-mail!

I have not elected myself webmaster at all, the last thinhg i want to do is
look after a wqebsite

I have put you and Koula as joint webmasters NOT me, I am sure that in one
of your posts you agreed that you and koula could be webmasters

If this is not what you want then I will toss a coin between you and koula
I think its the only other way to be fair

position list is

bLADe = CO-ORDINATOR / CODE
simon burfield = Joint webmaster with Koula Vaclav

I trust that clears that up

BTW. I know you can get free domain names from Freenetname as i have 6

If you want to get a feee domnain name then ok, but remember you can only

why use a seperate ISP from what everyone is using now, to get just a free
name? Anyone can use a V3 direction, like http://come.to/amospro or
something similar, which will guide you to any page you want.

Free net name is NOT free... It is charged thru your phone bill, as UK
domain names cost rather large sums of money. Also, they have a VERY nasty
firewall up preventing remote administration and email receiving, and you
HAVE to connect via their pay-phone number. Also, if you don't connect
every few days, they keep the domain name, and the webstuff you have done,
and ditch you. Feel free to check yourself.

Still - it IS the cheapest domain name going.

Oh, and amos.co.uk DOES cost money, someone already has it, you'll have to
buy it off them.

Hi Leto, I seem to remember that your graphics are great. Are you able to
commit to a lot of work for this game? Will you think about some characters
and send them to the website please? If the background palettes can be set
up maybe others can contribute, but the whole game must have a uniform
'feel' to it.

Agreed!

The response to this idea is great, guys!

I cannot talk to you in real time, too expensive. The website seems a good
idea. Is someone going to take charge of updating it?

I'm sure that my friend Eddie Maddock will write a good storyline during
January. When that is up on the website we can all have a think about it and
come up with suggestions.

I reckon a demo game, just a few scenes would be a good idea. It
would prove that the idea was workable and would encourage people to slog
out the longer job of completing the real game. The demo game bobs and
graphics could be studied and improved, if required.

Am I right when I say that for a game like this, high skill in coding
is not what we are looking for? A reliable detection system is essential. You
don't want to
have to struggle to pick things up, or walk through a doorway, but the main
requirement, apart from the story is plenty of top quality graphics. Do we
have people here who can produce the goods, and lots of it? Just think about
the multitude of scenes in Monkey Island 1. Do we have people here who can
draw components for animating walking bobs? The quality of the graphics is
what the game will immediately be judged on. Artists, please will you submit
some
examples of your work to the website.

Am I in tune with you all when I talk about Monkey Island 1? I loved that game
and would like us to be able to produce something as good as that, with
similar crazy humour, thats my taste.

Hmmm.... I was actually working on a graphic adventure. Started at
the end of 1997! Haha! Still no where near finished.

I do a fair bit of graphics, but to be honest I feel I hardly have
enough time for my own things, let alone a huge job like a new
graphic adventure. BUT.... I will think about it, and we'll see
what happens.

Good luck to you all. (I was going to send this to that new

Perhaps the group could take your existing graphic adventure and use it

I've never worked with other people on a program before. I may be able to
contribute coding. I may be able to do graphics. I can certainly offer
suggestions. I have already identified a super story writer for the game. At

Once the guy doing the webstuff gets it up and running, he could make a
huge list of all the ideas contributed so far and have people email him
with suggestions & votes right from the page. I can also set them up an
anonymous FTP site so that anyone who wants to make contributions of

Just a question. Does anyone have some documentation about programming in Amos?
I do have the original manual and 1 book (mastering Amos, Bruce Smith books).
Docs for example about making scrollers, bouncing balls etc.

A good IDEA = When we have the website I think we should reinstate writing ten
liners. A soccer game in TEN LINES of amos code! Can be done, has been done!

Looking forward to getting this show (the adventure game and website) up and
running.

Hi Everybody,

I have noticed that whenever there is talk of /starting/ something new (a new
version of amos, a list game or whatever) suddenly everyone starts talking about
it and offering to help (but then it usually dies within a week... :(
Anyway, if /starting/ a game generates this much interest, how about if I
said I needed some help /finishing/ a game...? :)


Actually, all I need is a *really* good 2 ending pics for it, and some
backdrops for the credits. Yep, thats it, no more, no less. So, who's up for
it? I've already had a go at a lightwave rendered one, but it doesn't look so
good, so if any ones interested, get in touch :)

(Also, although this is a larger and less finished project, anyone want to do
the gfx for Bomber Blaster? My artist is practically doing nothing :/


Hey, if other people can do it, why not me eh? ;)



And Merry Christmas everyone :)


See ya :)

Working together on a adventure game would be great. It's a hell of a job to do.
I allready read some E-mails that we would not be able to pull it of. Baring in
mind the previous project called "Pitfall" it could be true. At the moment we
are talking about 2 projects: the adventure game and the website. I some people
want to abandon ship for the adventure game, ok. But I should state that we NEED
the website!!!!! Amos needs a BOOST and by creating a international website with
tutorials, downloads, sourcecode etc we would be able to form a HUGE group of
Amos coders. I know there are a lot of people out there working on Amos and if
we all would form a team we would be able to do great things!!

Pfeeeeh......... Thats my opinion of it!

Yes, I guess that is because we just do not have the time to commit to
such projects. BNG is not officially dead it is just not being worked
on. I will most likely dabble with it from time to time.... also, if
anyone is interested in listening and carrying it forward then Keith and
I can explain exactly how to do it, we just do not have time to actually
implement it. The problem I have is there are only so many hours in a
day and at the moment I am spending most of my time in projects at work.
What little free time I do have is invested in reaching my goals and
spending time with friends and family.

Hmm.... I think Keith and I really need to form a development team for
our personal projects. We know how to do a hell of a lot of things and
can figure out how to do the rest. If we had a team to actually take the
plan and put it into action then it would be awesome. We would even be
motivated to put in some coding time ourselves under those circumstances.


>Anyway, if /starting/ a game generates this much interest, how about if I
>said I needed some help /finishing/ a game...? :)

Sounds like an excellent idea. Good luck.

Hi all AMOS lovers

It's been a long time since I'd unsubscribed from the list. Now I have a
68060 CPU & 16 meg RAM. But I still have my old thrusty AMOSPro 2.0. Is
there a new version supporting higher CPU's and OS's (I mean taking
advantage of them). Besides what's going on nowadays in AMOS world? It's
good to be back.

Loves to all.

Ömer

No.


Well, there are various extentions that'll let you use intuition screens, and
theres SUPPOSED to be a new, better one (Ahem, GUI 2 anyone?? :)

Infact, if you like I can tell you how to give your games gfx card support :)

See ya :)

Is that Skidz as in Andy Gibson? If it is, you can contact him @
andy@agasinc.demon.co.uk
He does seem to have gone off amigas, btw - I'm currently trying to get all
his code off him (i.e. DMC)

I am always interested in stuff written by other Amos-users. So if you have
created something maybe you could tell me if it's available for download. Also
if you know other great site's for Amos-downloads.

3 games on my website for download. All have been on AF CD's prior to me
getting the compiler, and the Dice game has fresh graphics following the
comments in Amiga Format. All are now executables. Feel free to download and
any comments/criticism is welcome. See my sig for the url.

Can you suggest a C compiler generating native 68060 codes? I don't care
much about the untiution, OS frienliness, multitasking, etc. I plan to
write some demo-like stuff. Availability through the net is preferred.
