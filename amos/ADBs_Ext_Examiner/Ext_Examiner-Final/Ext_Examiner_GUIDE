@node Intro "AMOS Extension Examiner - Intro"

      After spending alot of my time manually translating a bunch of
      AMOS extensions, I decided to create this program.
      It does all the hard work. It allows you to not only view a list
      of commands, but view error messages and much more. If that wasn't
      good enough, it even allows you to export some, or all, of the data
      to a textfile for easy viewing later on :)

      Load
      ****
      Allows you to load in an AMOS extension file. You can't do anything
      until you load in a file (e.g AMOSPro.Lib) from the APSystem folder.


      Export
      ******
      Once an AMOS extension file has been loaded in, you can use this
      option to export information on the extension to a textfile.
      You can press the Escape key to return to the main menu, whilst
      the following options are displayed on screen:

         SynCon   - Syntax conversion

         Commands - Command list

         Info     - Info about the extension (name, offsets etc.)

         All      - All of the above exported in one file


      Commands
      ********
      Once an AMOS extension file has been loaded in, you can use this
      option to view a list of the commands within the extension.
      After selecting the commands option you will be greeted with this
      message:

         View Translation?

      You can either press the Escape key to return to the main menu,
      select "Yes" or "No". If you select the latter you will not see
      the translation process - it will still take place, but slightly
      faster than if you selected to view the process. If you selected
      "Yes" then you will view the translation process, in the following
      order:

         Raw Syntax
         Translation Process
         Commands


      Info
      ****
      Once an AMOS extension file has been loaded in, you can use this
      option to view all sorts of information about the extension. This
      includes the extension name, number of commands, error messages,
      various offsets that would be familiar to AMOS extension programmers
      and the extension number.

      Unfortunately, scanning both the default routine and the error
      routine for the extension number has proved unreliable. The reason
      for this is that about a third of all extensions have not been
      created properly. (I currently have about 50 extensions in total)

      What this means is that if they have an invalid extension number in
      the error routine (if it even contains an error routine!) then the
      extension would not compile correctly, causing the compiled program
      to crash.
      Some extensions, particularly those by Francois Lionet, do not follow
      the rules he stated with the "music.s" file. This means that I was
      forced to try a third option.

      The third option requires the execution of the default routine, but
      this can crash the Amiga. Therefore, I have left it as an option.
      When the following message appears...

         Run Default Routine?

      ...you can choose whether to run the routine or not. If you do decide
      to run it, please bear in mind that the Amiga may not crash straight
      away. It may seem fine and then crash a few minutes later during some
      other operation. I recommend seeing what results are returned by the
      scanning of the default and error routines, before executing the
      default routine.


      Quit
      ****
      Quits the program. You will be given the option to confirm whether
      you wish to exit or not. You can press the Escape key or select "No"
      to return to the main menu, or you can select "Yes" to exit the
      program.

@node Translation "AMOS Extension Examiner - Translation"


      Translation Key
      ***************
      0 = Integer variable - X
      1 = Floating-point variable (FPV) - X#
      2 = String variable - X$
      3 = Array, string, variable or FPV - X$(),X#(),X(),X$,X# or X
      4 = Variable or floating-point variable - X or X#
      5 = Angle in degrees or radians - ANGLE or ANGLE#
      C = Control character
      V = Reserved variable (preceeds [0-5])
      I = Instruction (first character after end of command name)
      O = Operator (first character after end of boolean symbol)
      , = Comma (used to separate variables)
      t = To


      Examples
      ********

      Raw Syntax: £ O
      Translated: #

      Raw Syntax: follo÷ I
      Translated: Follow

      Raw Syntax: logbaså00
      Translated: X=Logbase(Y)

      Raw Syntax: inkey¤2
      Translated: X$=Inkey$

      Raw Syntax: coó15
      Translated: X#=Cos(Y)

      Raw Syntax: raiîV00,0
      Translated: X=Rain(Y,Z)

      Raw Syntax: matcè03,3
    * Translated: X=Match(Y$()|Y#()|Y()|Y$|Y#|Y,Y$()|Y#()|Y()|Y$|Y#|Y)

      Raw Syntax: str¤24
    * Translated: X$=Str$(Y#|Y)


         * Just because the raw syntax uses a 3 or 4 does not mean
           all the variations are compatible. For example, the array
           function ("X=Array(X$(0))") requires an array be used and will
           return an error if you try to use normal string$ or numeric
           variables.
