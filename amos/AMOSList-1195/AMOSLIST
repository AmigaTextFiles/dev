Giday Semprini,

I had this kind of problem too, with the scroll command. Works fine in 
Amos (creator for me), but when you compile it, it seems to jolt and even 
flash sometimes.

I think I asked the list and they said something about it being a bug.

You could use the screencopy command maybe?

Here's a question that has been rattling around inside my head for
the last day or two:

"If you wish to write a game that will run on a 1Mb Amiga, what is
 the advantage of have a higher specification development machine?"

Example:  The graphics I produced for my game wouldn't fit into 1Mb.
		  I thought about upgrading my RAM and then realised that if
		  it didn't run in 1Mb on my development machine, it wasn't
		  going to run on anyone's 1Mb machine that they play it on.

I have concluded programming my first ever game.
(Does this mean I can progress from 'baby' AMOS programmer to
 'toddler' AMOS programmer?)

Note that I didn't say that the game was finished to my
satisfaction.  It is fully playable, but there are many improvements
I would like to add.  Before anyone asks, no I won't be making it
available as it is really rubbish and I'm would be too embarrassed.

Question:  Is a game ever finished?
Example: "What if a player could do...Wouldn't it be nice if..."
		 - frustating play testers.

(With such an estute observation, does this mean I may yet make it
 to 'mostly harmless'* AMOS programmer status?)

Regards,

Kevin.

P.S. If you would like me to see your reply can you copy it to me
     personally as I am not on the mailing list.

     My friend made an AMOS program that animated graphics on the workbench 
screen. He did it by finding the memory adress using a graphics ripper, and 
then using an AMOS physical screen at that location.

Poke around in the mask memory. It is located at

Leek(Start(1)+6+N*8) 

where N is the image number from the sprite bank. You can
simply copy a bitplane there from another bob  image. Look in the
AMOSPro manual Appendix E for information on the structure of bank 1.

There's nothing wrong with assuming a OS1.1 128K user, as long as you 
expect the computer industry will never move on. However, if you want to 
actively enforce the production of high-specs machine, your base user 
should be AGA OS3.* 2MB +harddisk.

Yucko! This is not exactly system-friendly, but then again, neither is AMOS.
But what happens if the WB-screen is a Multiscan one?? Can anyone verify this?

While it is a good goal to strive for a 1Mb system do not beat yourself
up because you did not achieve it.

A piece of software can be finished.
Sometimes though you have to learn to let it go before
it has been fully developed.
A piece of software is normally written to meet a set of goals.
There are usually some future enhancements that are attached to any
piece of software.  ie it would be really neat if...

Hi.  Thanks for the reply.  The previous routine required commands to 
determine the width and height of a bob.  They said it needed the 
Turbo extension.  Unfortunately, it must be the Turbo Plus extension 
because I have Turbo 1.9 and it doesn't seem to be there.  :-(

So, if you don't mind sending me your routine, I would be very 
grateful!

Thanks!

not a lot. I try to write stuff for a 1.3 1Mb (A500) but I have a A1200. 
it is easy to use lots of RAM but then other amigas with les RAM are not

Well, let`s see...

Having a real kick-butt Amiga for development work lets
you get more out of your development software.  For
instance:

Faster CPU -

   Reduced compilation/assemble times, so you don`t have to
wait around to test your latest code.
   Faster processing of graphics/audio data.  If you`re using,
say, ray-traced graphics in a game, you don`t really want to
be rendering them on a stock A500, do you?

More Memory -

   Multitask more development programs at once, no having to
quit your art package before loading AMOS, just because the
art program eats half a meg or more...
   Use the RAM disk rather than hard/floppy disk for 
temporary file storage, especially when doing stuff like
image processing, including includes etc. etc.
   Adding Fast RAM is going to speed up your Amiga, thus
entering the domain of a faster CPU above.
   What if you`re writing a program that needs ALL of the
available memory on the target machine, and your machine
has the same amount of memory.  You`ll not be able to keep
AMOS in memory at the same time as the program, so you`ll
be forever loading AMOS to change the program, then
quitting AMOS to test the program, then loading AMOS.......


Hard Drive -

   Faster load/save rates, etc. etc.  Do I have to spell
it out.



In short, having an expanded Amiga as a development machine
makes life easier, and provided you`re careful not to make
your software dependent on the expansions, you`ll still be
able to write software that works on base level Amigas too.


Hope this rambling reply is of some use.

Chris

Of course! The version 1.30 is JUST an update to version 1.19. So, to use

it,
YOU NEED the extension itself. You can get it on Aminet in dev/amos with
the
name AMCAFExt119.lha   It's a VERY big file (over 1Meg) and just then you
can
update to version 1.30.

Well, I don't use music too much, but I wouldn't say it. First of all, the
music extension is separated from the rest since it must be improved
easily.
But I can't say it's too good. When you play a sample ALL the channel are
stopped, the sample's played and then all restart again. It isn't very
nice.
Instead, using Craft, you can stop just a channel, play the sample using
that
one and then restart that single channel: and the music goes on better.

What I can suggest is to change the Music extension with EME.
That's all.

Yes it is. And from the next version it could be able to copy also
Intuition
screens to Amos ones, or better, Andy said it. ;-)

Ok, it was enough!

Just a quick question for u all,

I want to read the system time into my program so I can have a clock 
running within it, but I`m not sure how to do it.  I`m sure I used to 
have a procedure to do it, using Doscall, but I seem to have lost it.
Can anyone help me out, and offer either a soultion or and idea as to how 
to do it!!

Thanks

Paul

Hi .
I read about your interest for the FD2AmosProcs program. I'll send it to
amoslist tomorrow morning. It's very simple to use.Simply appears a file
selector to select your FD text file. After selected it, program works
automatically creating AmosProcs in an ASCII format.If you want to load 
them into editor, simply load it from menu using Merge ASCII and save them
as Amos File.

Now the question.I'm going to buy an HP 600 printer but i haven't found the
Amiga driver on Aminet.So, i would like to know where i can find it (if 
exists) or if it's possible to use another compatible driver.

I hope in suggestions.

If you could send the actual source code, it would be much easier 
to track down the problem.

Hello,

Is there a faster system to load fonts??
What I do is: Get Disc Font
Then Amos scans all the fonts available on fonts: and then I can select my
wanted font. This is good enough if you have few fonts (loading from a

disk),
but if you have over 100 different kind of fonts, each one with at least 2
different sizes, this way takes a lot of time, even 40 seconds.

So, I'd like to know if it's possible to do it in another way.

Otherway, Chris, why don't you add it to your AMCAF extension??

Bye and thanks.

Hello,
I'd like to ask you a favour.

Is there anyone who printed the docs of Easylife or AMCAF??

I have these, but I don't like AmigaGuide format too much: I know it's
powerful, easy and comfortable, but I often program without my Amiga, using
pen and paper. So I can't view AmigaGuide documents, but I must print them.
Since they are VERY long, I'd like to know if someone already did it and

can
send me the photocopies of them (via snail mail, of course!). I printed the
docs of Intuition and Ldos extension, and if you want I can send you them.

Let me know!
Thanks.

I think you're wrong. When you are developping a game, you need memory
for editors + the memory the game needs. So you need lots of memory 
(amos pro itself takes about half an meg of memory). 
When you run the compiled game, you can directly boot from that disk to
get more memory.

ESCOM definitely should put some fast mem to every Amiga model at the

I said that there're Bob Width & Bob Height commands in the turbo extension.
Sorry, I was wrong, there isn't, at least not in my version of turbo.

BUT! You can always peek the bob bank. I don't remember
the offsets right now, but you can check them from Amos Pro
manual.

  That's from the Intuition Extension, indicating (in this case) that what
the extension thought was a system message port really wasn't.  At a guess,
you did in fact corrupt something.  (Just because the Amiga keeps working
doesn't necessarily mean that everything's fine...)  Although why or how it
occurred while you were saving is beyond me, if that's what happened.

Well, according to me, AMOS has runned on outdated machines for a lot of
time.
Amiga 500 has benn out for quite 10 years, and nowadays, a lot of Amos
coders
are still working on A500s: isn't it outdated??

And what about AGA chipset?? Amos doesn't support it: isn't it outdated??

And if you think that AGA was ready about 6 years ago (ready, not
available),
isn't it more and more outdated??

And what about Commodore: it's out, and their machines are again more and
more outdated, aren't they??

So, I'm not very worry about the new processor, but I hope that a new AMOS
version will be available. We all know about mistakes, even in the 2.00
version, but it seems that without Lionet they can't be solved. So I hope
OR
a new AMOS, or a new language, from Amos, but different.
Please, don't flame me for it: I see the moment, and I cannot think in a
different way. :-(

Bye.

My program had been working with memory banks and PEEK and POKE,
but I didn't hit anything important in memory as the Amiga
was still working fine.  The code is obviously Hex--does anyone
know what it means?  And maybe why it happened?  Thanx.

Hello!(c)

I found some kind of bug in the compiler! It's a logical bug and can
hardly be avoided...

The compiler will optimize multiplications and divisions by powers of two
(e.g 2, 4, 8, 16 etc) to bit-shifting operations...

However, bit shifting and dividing is not exactly the same with negative
numbers:

Print -4/16 will product 0 from the editor, but -1 from the compiler. This
is due to the way negative numbers are stored in memory...

-4 e.g is %11111111111111111111111111111100...

shifting it four bits to the left (which is mostly equal to a division by
16), will produce %11111111111111111111111111111111 which is -1.

Just a remark, if you wonder why your compiled programs don't work in the
same way when compiled...

(Remember that operations like -4/15 won't flaw because they aren't (and
cannot) be optimized to a bit shifting operation.)

Best regards

Both Chris' AMCAF extension & my Easylife extension already contain commands to
load fonts directly without listing them first. But I recomend everyone with 
more than
20 or so fonts get a program called "CacheFont" off aminet which buffers the 
fonts list
in a file so it doesnt have to scan the disk for fonts everytime some program 
wants a
list. I have over 200 fonts in many sizes, and Get Disc Fonts takes just over 
a second!

Sorry but it needs really much chip ram. Maybe I'll make two
different versions of the game. One for 1meg chip machines and
one for AGA.

Oh!  I didn't realise this message got sent correctly!  I've just 
sent it again!  - sorry!

OK, I'll isolate the routine and put it on the list because it's only 
little.  Is that OK with everyone?

I only want it to be very short, though, I don't want any big screen 
copy routines or anything.

This is also odd!  Another message I sent to the list a week ago but 
has been returned to me my the mailer!

------- Forwarded Message Follows -------

Hello!  Sorry, yet another silly question from me!

I've just done a very simple scrolltext using the default font.  It's 
placed on the screen using TEXT then scrolled across it using a DEF 
SCROLL type thing.

The DEF SCROLL moves it 2 pixels to the left.  Every 4 "SCROLL 1" 
instructions, I place another letter on the screen.

After calling the procedure to update the scrolltext, I have a WAIT 
VBL.

This is fine (strangely enough!) - very smooth and nice.  I have done 
this sort of thing before, so I expected it to be!!  ;-)

The problem is when I compile it.  If I compile into another Amos Pro 
window, thne run it the scrolltext becomes very jerky as if it's 
trying to keep up the speed, but not quite managing it.  This 
surprises me because I thought compiling it would make it smoother 
and better if anything?!

I'm not using a double buffered screen or anything remotely 
complicated.  Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong - or is it an 
Amos Pro (v2) bug?

Thanks!

Actually, it's the other way round.  The Screen is 32 colours and I 
have several  bobs which use a fair few colours.  But I also have an 
animating mouse pointer using 4 colours (excl transparency) although 
I might be able to get it down to 3.  I want to replace the mouse 
pointer with this one and still use interface etc.

Get Cachefont (aminet/util/boot), it makes font list loading *much* fas=

It's already in there... Change Font "name.font",size.

Most extensions can do this though...

It would be easier to write a program to take out all the amigaguide
codes automatically.

Has this "bug" ever affected you?

With my game Knockout, there are plenty of lsl/rs with negative numbers=
.
They all work fine.

I suspect that the compiler does something equivilant to =3DSgn(n)*Lsl(=
Abs(n))

However, I have noticed that any extensions with lsl/r in them, do not
work with negative numbers. ;-)

Mr. Semprini,
 I dl'd your game _Scrotax_ and it seems pretty decent. Except on
my NTSC screen I can't see what's going on at the bottom of the screen.
I can still play it and I think it is slickly presented and not half
bad. I tried to set the WB preferences so I could see most of the screen
but it didn't work like it should have. I guess that you  must set the
position of the screen within the program and that stops me from changing 
default outside the program.

By the way, is the ball a sprite or a bob? If it is a bob, you certainly 
should be able to change it so it looks more like a ball and less like a 
stop sign octagon. Some clever shading could change this.

PS: Everyone should check out Bikini Babe from Barbados on Aminet which
I think was programmed in AMOS.

why when I try to compile a program with a large number of data statements
(a total of 450 elements in all) my machine freezes and then crashes?  Is 
there any way to get around this without trying to use those darned data

Subject: Very Simple Scrolltext Routine (uuencode)
Reply-to: semprini@enterprise.net
Priority: normal

X-Status: 

Here's the very simple scrolltext routine I was going on about 
before.  It says what's wrong with it in the scrolltext and is 
(hopefully) very simple to follow.

I know it's pretty dire, but I'd appreciate some help!  I think I may 
need a double buffered screen, but I'm not sure.  I need to keep this 
routine as small as possible.

THANKS!

BY THE WAY - it's called SCROLL.AMO but should be SCROLL.AMOS - but 
you know what PC's are like!

Hello all,

   Is it possible, in the new version of of AMACF, to have commands which 
will allow co-routine programming, eg like AMAL does with graphic 
commands, but with the co-routine any AMOS command cound be used. The 
routine(s) would run concurrently with the main AMOS program. For 
example one rountine could do something in one part of the screen, while 
another rountine could be doing something else, like drawing the next 
screen. After all the Amiga is supposed to be Mutiltasking :) Commands 
could be something like :

Def_Routine (name) {Routine Body} 
Run_Routine (name)
Stop_Routine (name)

Does anyone else have any ideas on this subject?

Thank you very much for the comments!!  I really appreciate them!

Ah yes!  Sorry, I do position the screens because they slide on (from 
what I remember) rather than are just bunged there.  Erm...it may be 
possible to do an NTSC mode, I suppose, by putting the main playing 
field higher and putting the status panel at the bottom.

Hmm.. you're quite right, of course, the ball is a very lazy graphic. 
If I bring out a new version of Scrotax, I'll try to tidy it up a bit 
and make an NTSC mode.  The ball is a bob and there should be enough 
colours free to change a few to make some nice shading (I think...)

Sounds interesting!

    You could always unpack your images to a data bank (preferably fast mem!)
and from there copy it directly to the intuition screens memory.  To do this
however you will probably need to find the start of the screen address every
time the machine is booted!  How you do this I don't know.  Andy Church's
extension may be the ticket.  Good luck anyway!

    Hmmmmm, thats one I  haven't heard before.  Quite possibly a bug with the
compiler - there are lots of them :-((((((

    Whats wrong with using data banks?  They seem daunting at first but once
your use to them you'll wonder why you never used them.  What sort of data do
you need to be stored?  Let us know and I'm sure someone here will solve your
problem!

Hi to everyone on this list,
 
    I have a question which I hope somebody could help me with, I have a 
menu, which is displayed simply using Text X,Y for each line and I am 
using Zones to detect which option the user is selecting. The menu is now 
bigger than the screen so I have written a little routine which allows 
the user to scroll the menu up and down. The problem is I want to add a 
marble effect background behind the text, which is fine until the text is 
scrolled up or down, then the graphics mess up, does anyone have a 
suggestion on what is the best and quickest way to move the menu up or down 
but to leave the backgound intact ?.

Hi there! 

I downloaded the JD_Libs from Aminet the other day, and I was rather naffed
off when it wouldn't work.. I'm sticking it in the extentions that it
reqeusts, and it tells me that the extention cannot be found... I'm not
doing anything stupid, like spelling it wrongly, or putting it in the wrong
place of my HDD... I'm using ext14, as it asks, but it refuses to work..
Agghh!!! Come on someone - am I the only person who has these problems???

Thanks..

I'm struggling with a program i'm writing. What happens is...
When I enter a number as a stringthat is 6 digits or longer, and I convert it to
a floating point number for example 180000, and I print it out again I get
179999.99 and NOT 180000.00 as I want... i've put a Fix(2) command higher up
but that does nothing... i need the fix command anyway.
I've scoured the help system, and all i found was a reference to double
precision numbers... but i can't find a way to select that mode at all.
Any Ideas would be gratefully tried....

Thanks in advance

Matthew.

Many extensions provide a function to read the current system time and
date, e.g AMCAF. If you don't want to use or don't have such an extension,
you just could look up some routines in the supplied procedure library
which I'm sure of containing a systemtime procedure.

This is one of the commands I added pretty early ;-) You guys never read

Doesn't this already exist, using interupts and some "On x Do Y" command?

  I think I have to make a comment about this and other things people have
mentioned they'd like to see in AMCAF.  AMCAF is an AMOS extension, and as
such, can only do a limited number of things - specifically, actions which
can be represented in AMOS with a single command or function, and not even
all of those.  For example, I couldn't create a Print equivalent for my
Intuition extension because AMOS doesn't allow that kind of instruction to
be coded in an extension.  I've even had problems with Ipalette taking a
variable number of parameters.  Things like you're asking here would
require a total rewrite of AMOS in any case, and even then would have to be
programmed into the new AMOS itself rather than being in an extension.
Now, I personally think a rewrite of AMOS would be an excellent idea... but
I don't have the time to spend on it.  Sigh.

There was a small discussion on this subject in the newsgroups. It seems you
can circumvent this problem by making the `binaries' device-independent.
In this case, the OS can perform the last, final translation depending on
the hardware it runs on. In effect, you have one program which either runs
in native or in compat mode (people who run MUDs will know what I mean :) ),
but you never have to worry about which CPU resides within your computer.
You still need to change the Compiler-code, though, to produce this 
output. So I guess AMOS will cease to exist on Power Amigas... :(

Thanks for that, but i'm using the AMOS Interface to input the numbers from,
using an EDit gadget and RDialog$(1,n) etc and convert then using val(n$)
It seems to work fine for numbers under 65000, (ie. the range of integers) but
any higher and it screws up. To convert the numbers to floats i am using a line
as follows:

NUMBER#=Val(NUMBER$)
Is there a Val#(n$) command that I have completely forgotten about.
The program seems to handle all the calculations I make okay, but it uses the
179999.99 value which does have a knock-on effect. Unfortunately, due to the
nature of my program (a mortgage calculation program i'm doing for a project)
this REALLY spoils things, as I'm using some test data, and the results are
off by a few pence, and i really could do without it.

I now realise my original plea for help was a bit vague, I hope this clears
things up a bit.
Could you transmit this to the AMOS mailing list as I am not a member of that
list yet.

Many Thanks,

I doubt many of you here will have seen a post from me. I've been sub'ed
to this list for over a year, but don't do much programming (apart from
an IFF2raw2IFF sample covertor and an IFF2ASCII image convertor and a
hypermedia viewer...), so I don't much post either :)

Anyway, to business.

I just got my christmas subscription copy of Amiga Shopper, and, apart
from them giving away the full version of IntOS (intuition procedures),
in the news section there's a piece about the revival of Amos.

It would appear that a certain Ultimate Software have taken over the
distribution.
They plan a rerelease in Jan/Feb '96 which will include AmosPro, the
compiler, dialog procedures and an 'easy' beginners disk,

Prices are expected to be 25-30 UK pounds.

The proceeds from the sales will go to a british charity (yet to be decided
upon)!

For more info, phone +(0)1703-338-318

That should make you lot happy :)

Hopefully, they restart development too. Then we can get rid of that bloody
Francios crap code :)

Love & Life,


G.

    There are interrupt commands of this sort in the original version.
They're not so much true interupts though.  the syntax is domething like-

on <event> goto/gosub/proc <sub-code>

where event is an interupt event such as a mouseclick etc and sub code is the
section of code to run when that event occurs.

there is also a: on every <count> goto/gosub/proc etc.

which runs the sub code every <count> 1/50 of seconds.

The bitplane pointers don't get changed between the short and long frames.
Yes, even static pictures are no real interlace anymore.

No... not yet...

This update is for REGISTERED users only. Moreover, it requires the

This is not completely correct: AMCAF does this automatically similar to
the original music extension of AMOS. The samples can be replayed during
the Protracker output and are not cut off by the music.

Done this already... works fine (Kick 2.0+ only), but avoid odd screen
sizes. ;-)

Pretty simple really. AMOS is HUGE ! AMOS eats about 500k of your memory
before you even get to start programming, so when the program is finally
compiled, you'll have loads of free memory, as the AMOS interpreter wil no
longer be present, thus, having a 1,5MB upwards machine will allow you to
utilise all of the memory of the bog-standard 1Mb. Furthermore, with more
memory, you could keep the Sprite Editor, and other useful programs in
memory whilst editing your program ,and keep workbench running, maybe a copy
of dpaint. The possibilities are endless (All of the compiler files can stay
on ram:) so you see, more memory just makes your life much easier!

Check out the back messages from this list on aminet.
Some time ago (1~2 years ?) I wrote a tutorial on how to do just this. It
was full of acceleration algorithms.
Unfortunatly, due to hacking on the Company network,my orginal has been
lost.  
You'll have to dig around in the back messages.

As far as I know, it is not possible to turn off double buffering.

Perhaps if you uuencoded to program and posted it to the list, one of us
may be able to fix it for you.
Good luck

I don't think ON itself is an interupt.  I think ON goto/gosub/proc 
is just a quick way of doing:

IF A=1 Then goto/gosub/proc
IF A=2 Then....
etc

ON was there in BBC Basic!!

You mean EVERY xx PROC xx (or whatever)?  I don't think that's ON.  
Also, I'm not sure EVERY is interupt driven, I think it just does it 
every "roughtly" xx seconds "if there's time" sort of thing!  ;-)

Sorry, I'm probably hopelessly wrong as usual...

Yeah, but even degraders cant reveal the very bottom of a full PAL 
screen.  Like Scrotax... it's fun, but even in PAL mode I have no idea

But only the registered users will really get an update of the main

And AMCAF does it best ;-))) if you want to play a sample, it
automatically stops one channel of the music, plays the sample and then
turns the music on this channel on again... :-)

The thing about sequels, though, is that they're usually a case of 
continuing with the first game.  In which case, the first game was 
never finished.  There has to be a cut off point, but that always 
means there are ideas or possibilities left unexplored.

Hi to everyone on this list,
 
    I have a question which I hope somebody could help me with, I have a 
menu, which is displayed simply using Text X,Y for each line and I am 
using Zones to detect which option the user is selecting. The menu is now 
bigger than the screen so I have written a little routine which allows

Hello all,

   Is it possible, in the new version of of AMACF, to have commands which 
will allow co-routine programming, eg like AMAL does with graphic 
commands, but with the co-routine any AMOS command cound be used. The 
routine(s) would run concurrently with the main AMOS program. For 
example one rountine could do something in one part of the screen, while 
another rountine could be doing something else, like drawing the next 
screen. Commands could be something like :

Def_Routine (name) {Routine Body} 
Run_Routine (name)
Stop_Routine (name)

Does anyone else have any ideas on this subject?

That's all right.

But now, other 3 ideas:

=Ins$(A$,B$,P)   to add B$ in the middle of A$ at position P
                 Ex: Print Ins$("Hello Chris","dear ",6) -> Hello dear

Chris

=Cut$(A$,S,N)    to cut the string A$ from S for N letters.
                 Ex: Print Cut$("Hello dear Chris",6,5) -> Hello Chris

=Replace$(A$,B$,C$)   to replace B$ with C$ in the string A$
      Ex: Print Replace$("Hello old Chris","old","dear")-> Hello dear Chris

Are the Exs clear enough.

Do what you can.

Bye.

     Hey, has anyone seen the latest game maker from Europress for the IBM.
It's called Klik and Play. You create a game just by clicking. I don't know 
if Lionet programmed it, but it is really bad. The graphics flicker insanely 
and it is very limited. I wonder if they're going to do Amos or something 
like it for the PC.

No, I don't think EVERY is interrupt drive.  What is being explained
above as an example of multithreading, being able to run many
takss at once, all detatched from the main program.  For example, lets 
say I have a word processor that can repaginate.  I can run the
word processor's main program (typing, editing, etc...) in toe
foreground, but have the repagination happen in the background.
This is Win95's big claim to fame--the ability to have an app
run many different multitasking pieces of code for one program.

The only way I thought of doing this was with the DOS command Execute()
and having many, small compiled programs sdtored in memory and moved
to RAM or somewhere and run, running alongside your program.  You
could also do this with CALL, I believe, but that's what multithreading
is.

Try to make the screen use other bitplanes than your text.
Eg a EHB effect would do nicely.
Then you only scroll the bitplane with the text.

The =screenbase can give you the offsets to the bitplanes
then you use the copy command to copy memory in that bitplane
or use the amcaf extension with the blitter. <- easiest!

A friend of mine had a similar problem... but it had been a *huge* amount
of data lines (about 500 KB)... there was no other solution for that than
loading them into a bank... (or a file, if you prefere that)

------- cut for the AMCAF guide ---------
4. A program that uses data lines does not work correctly when compiled:
   There must not be any comments after a data line. Data commands must be
   completely alone on a line. Otherwise the compiler will interprete
   these comments as data.
   Conclusion: - Write the comments into a seperate line.

   Even worse: a friend of mine was faced to a guru when trying to compile
   a program that uses aprox. 500 KB of data lines. As for now, I found no
   solution for this problem.

That's just how floating point numbers work. Your number is not stored
like an integer in memory but in a way similar to x*2^y using a total of
32 bits. Therefore it no guarantee that your number can be stored 100%
exactly.

The Every command can run two things at once, but running more would be
very useful. However, I doubt something like this is possible within
an extension.

Why not "darned" banks??
They are very easy to be used, as fast as data statements can be and if the
problem doesn't have other solutions, they are your must.

OK, I'll go very slooooooowwwwwwly.

The "brief" was initially to make the mouse pointer move by using the 
joystick - there was no mention that the code should be able to be easily 
converted to be used with the keyboard.  Therefore, the fact that your 
code can be more easily converted in such a way is as irrelevant as 
converting my code to an emtpy loop - ie NO RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER!!

        Y Mouse = Y Mouse + (Jup(1)   - Jdown(1) )
        Wait Vbl
    End If
Loop

(Spot the way my code has not been formatted by Amos :-) )

Notice that it is personal taste whether to leave the Wait Vbl inside or 
outside the If...End If - but I think it should only ever be left outside 
if there are lots of other commands in the main loop and the program 
needs to run as fast as possible - but not smooth....

Hmmn, its not every day that Ive got one hand on my joystick and the 
other on my mouse......but then again there are some very strange people

cater for such people :-(((

Yes, but I would spend a lot of time either writing the program, either
printing them. The pages would be a lot. :-(

So, please, if you already printed them, let me know.
