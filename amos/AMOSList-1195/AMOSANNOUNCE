   Attention all AMOS, Easy AMOS, and AMOS Pro coders!  Attention please!!!

Being the most obnoxious and loudest AMOS advocate on the network, I have
decided to administer the list!  That's right, I have assumed control!

	To SUBSCRIBE to the AMOS list, send mail to:

		amos-request@access.digex.net

In the body of the message, please put:

	SUBSCRIBE amos-list [optional email address]

For example, if I wanted to subscribe, I would put:

	SUBSCRIBE amos-list mcox@access.digex.net

(It is not case sensitive so do not worry about it)

	Okay, now that you have subscribed, this is how you send a message to
everyone on the list.  Compose your message as normal and send it to:

	amos-list@access.digex.net

	That is all you do!  Everyone, including yourself, will get a copy of
your message.  What a great way to find out about updates and ask questions
about anything relating to AMOS!

	All mailing list requests for help or whatever should be sent to:

	amos-request@access.digex.net

	So what are you waiting for?  Subscribe then send a message to amos-list
introducing yourself and telling everyone what you do with AMOS!
