@NODE Introduction "Quick Introduction"



 * What is AmosAGA ?
 ===================


  At this point 'AmosAGA' is just a simple source code that allows Amos &
 AmosPro users to open either a 256 colour lowres (320x*256y) or a 256
 colour Hires (640x,256y) screen. 

  The source code create's the AGA screen via the using Amos's own custom
 copper creation commands, and with a few simple 'hacks' mixed in for good
 measure. ;)
 
  You should be aware that this source, at this point, is provided purely
 as a learning but 'working' example.  To take this idea further you will 
 need some basic understanding of the Amiga's display hardware, or to be
 more correct, the programming of the Amiga's AGA display hardware.

  I would recommend that you lay your hands on the AGA hardware
 documentation (obviously ;), which can be found in most PD collections,
 like Aminet, etc. etc..

@NODE SystemRequirements "AmosAGA System Requirements"


 * System Requirements:
 ======================


  To make a lot use of this source, you'll need at least a copy of either
 Amos or AmosPro and obviously an AGA machine.






@ENDNODE





@NODE Themethod "The Method - How does it actually work ?"



 * The Method:
 =============


  Basically, all I've done is use the custom copper creation commands
 that Amos already offers, to build up either a 320*256 or a 640*256
 256 colour screen.   




 *  The OPEN_SCREEN subroutine firstly open's TWO normal Amos screens,
    screen 0 and screen 1, both are same size and depth.

    E.g. 640,256,16,hires.

    Two standard Amos screens are needed so that we can both use our
    regular Amos drawing commands on them (for the moment) and since Amos
    rejects open screen requests for 256 colours directly.... ;)


 *  Next we need to find the physical locations of each bitplane in 
    memory of two screens and store them in an array for later use..


 *  Now we read the palette information into the array creatively titled
    PALCOLOUR.  This array hold the R,G,B data of the 256 unique colours.


 *  Next we create our custom copper.  Firstly we switch the Amos copper
    system off, then we init our custom copper routine.


 *  The custom copper routine builds a fairly basic copper list.


    The copper now includes some limited support for hardware sprites
    although, you'll really need to know how to program sprites at
    a hardware level to really get a great deal of use out of them.



 NOTE: I'm not going to explain how to construct a copper, I'll assume 
       you already understand how to do this... ;)



 *  After the copper list is defined, it's time to init it's pointers to
    our previously opened screens (0 & 1) and  Hardware Sprite
    information (bank 14).

    The init bitplane routine uses the actual pointers to each of the
    combined 8 bitplanes and then moves them into our copper list.

    With screen 0 becoming the lower 4 planes or bits (planes 0,1,2,3)
    and screen 2 becoming the higher planes / bits, planes 4,5,6,7

    Note: Unfortunately hardware sprite support is very limited in this
          version of AmosAGA. Sorry
   

 *  Next, here comes the only real 'hack' in this example, which simply
    replaces one of the copper commands (which I've defined as a dummy
    or a padding command) with a different one, via poking directly into
    the copper list, just as our bitplane init routine did above.

    The reason this is needed, is that Amos didn't want to allow me to
    do a 'cop move $1fc,$1001' as it believe's that $1fc (burst mode
    (FMODE) register) isn't used in OCS, ECS chips, which it isn't, but
    it is by AGA... ;) 
  

 *  we now turn our AGA copper / display on via the 'cop swap' command




 I suggest you read your manual in regards to custom copper creation. ;)
  
 

 *  To close our screen, all we need to do is firstly turn the Amos copper
    system on, then call a simple procedure which restores the 
    FMODE register to normal, other wise you probably get some rather
    unwanted results.

@NODE procs "List of AmosAGA Procedures"


 * The Procedures:
 =================


  Currently AmosAGA is *very* limited in regards to 'custom' AGA
 functions, this will increase as it grows more into custom library.  



  Please Note:  PLEASE BE AWARE THAT ALL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THESE
                SIMPLE ALPHA PREVIEWS IS COMPLETELY SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

   _AGA_SET_PALETTE          [bank]           Loads the current AmosAGA
					      screen with a completely
					      new palette. (256 colours)

					      Bank can either be a bank
                                              number (0->15) or an actual
                                              address.

@NODE bugs "AmosAGA has BUGS ?"



 * BUGS:
 =======


  For some unknown reason, there's one annoying thing that seems too occur
 in this version of AmosAGA, which perhaps somebody out there with more
 Amos street smarts can point out a solution to ?


  Anyway, now this is really starting to annoy me, for some reason,
 sprite 2 always gets corrupted and it would seem that Amos is doing
 something nasty to my sprite.  I assume it has something to do with
 the mouse pointer sprite(s) interrupt, or perhaps even 'AMAL', but not
 really being an Amos guru as yet, I'm not sure how to go about finding
 an Amos _friendly_ solution for this.

  You can fix this problem if you send Amos to back, but I don't see
 why it should be a problem in the first place. 

  So can anybody PLEASE point out what the problem is ?
 
 


@ENDNODE


@NODE LongRoad "The future ?"


 * The Future:
 =============


  After both, a few brief and some not so brief emails with various AmosAGA
 supporters, and reading the recent Amos mailing lists posted to Aminet,
 there now appears (to me at least) that there indeed is going to be a
 future for the further development of this idea into fully functioning
 product.
  

  This product is be known as 'AmosAGA pro' and unlike the series
 of simple AmosAGA example sources I've presently released, it will be
 a fully functional AGA game & demo development environment designed
 with for Amos programmers in mind.  AmosAGA pro, will not come in the form
 of an extension as such, but that of a highly optimized (pure assembly)
 Amiga shared library & Amos API.


  The use of an external library has many benefits over that of fixed
 extension, for example.



  * Users all be able to use special cpu opt'd versions of the
    AmosAGA pro library.


  * Allows for support of the coming PPC cpu's.  So Amos developers never
    need to worry about PPC issues.


  * An standard shared library (which is really just a collection of
    functions) can be used from any host environment or language, such as
    Blitz Basic, C, E, or even assembly.

    Initially though, we'll be focusing our support on the Amos / AmosPro
    community, as I believe they need this support the most.  ;)


  * Users and developers will benefit directly from official updates to
    the 'AmosAGA pro' user graphics library.



  
  Future:  (Coming in 1997)
  =======


  * Loading & Saving of AGA IFF's

  * AGA Open Screen      You'll be able to open and use a variety of screen
                         types, including.

			    * Normal Planar
                            * Interleaved Planar
                            * Chunky (8bit)
                            & possible Graffiti support.


  * A completely new copper control system.

  * Palette & colour  control.

  * Standard drawing functions, including  Plot, Line, box, Circle etc. etc.

  * A new BOB system(s).

  * Custom Map tile system(s).

  * Hardware Sprite Control.




 Techy AGA info:
 ===============


  * Support for AGA 16/32 & 64 bit burst modes

  * Extended Long Blits (ECS & AGA)




  Extended Future:  (coming in 1998)
  ================


  * 3D Library, including 256 colour Flat shaded, gouraud shaded, &
                texture mapped polygons.

  * 3D Object Editor,  Will import 'Imagine' & hopefully (grin) Amos3D
                objects.
 



  The graphics function library that AmosAGA pro will be based upon is
 being developed in pure 680x0 assembly for maximum speed and uses the very
 lastest in software technologies to achieve superior performance.


  If you have any possible feature ideas please feel free to forward
 them to me.




@ENDNODE




@NODE nextgen "AmosAGA professional will be Commercial !"


 
    AmosAGA pro:  (Coming in 1997)
    ============
   

    AmosAGA pro, is aimed at giving Amos programmers a chance to compete
 in the ever expanding world of video game development, it will give you
 the ability to produce high quality products directly from basic.


    In late Oct. / Nov. 1997, we will release the first series of
 'AmosAGA pro' demos to Aminet, and developers will be encouraged to
 register as AmosAGA pro developers A.S.A.P.
     

    Registered developers will receive not only the 'AmosAGA pro' development
 package but will also be entitled to a number of updates, Technical
 information & on-line support, Bug fixes & Developer networking all for
 their trouble.


    Any software you produce with AmosAGA pro is completely royalty free.


    In 1998 we'll continue to further develop, optimise the AmosAGA pro
 package, as your interest demands, so you won't be left high and dry. 
 More importantly though, this demand will be the deciding factor in 
 adding our 3D module into the AmosAGA pro package.  Hence, we are not
 promising to develop the 3D module, unless the support is truly there.


    I'm sorry about this rushed announcement, we will be making a more
 official one sometime in the near future (coming weeks).
