Screen Eaters - Cls Must Die!

Screen Eaters, an idea invented by Paul Hickman (ph@doc.ic.ac.uk), are
creative ways of clearing a screen.

See the demonstration program SEDemo.Amos for a demo of three screen eaters
(SEB_TRICLEAR, SEB_VSTRIPS, SEB_HSTRIPS); you can easily put other screen
eaters in and call them instead.

Naming of screen eaters
-----------------------

All procedure names are prefixed:

SES_  - An eater for single buffered screens
SED_  - An eater for double buffered screens
SEB_  - An eater for both types of screens

Eaters can use Screen Width & Screen Height to determine the screen
size. Deek(Screen Base+80) will return the number of bitplanes in the
current screen.

Each eater should have the first two parameters SCR,C

SCR = Screen to clear
C   = Colour index to clear to
