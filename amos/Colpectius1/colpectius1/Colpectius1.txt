Colpectius1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Ben Wyatt, bwyatt@paston.co.uk

This is a small collection of AMOS stuff which I've written over the years,
that would otherwise be gathering virtual dust, on my hard disk.

This is the second release of the Colpectius1. I've made a few alterations
due to requests, bugs I noticed straight after I uploaded it, and to
make it more compatible with Amos's that don't have 1000000 extensions
added.

Questions Asked Frequently (QAF)

QAFs about Colpectius1, with answers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Why is it named after a Roman?
    It's a collection of some of my stuff, but I didn't want to call it
    "Collection1.lha", so I ran it through "Funnyizer.AMOS" (included in
    this package) and it came up with Colpectius, which is slightly more
    amusing and a tad more likely to get downloaded. The "1" tagged on
    the end is because it is the first (and probably the last) of this
    long running series.

What's in this Roman?
    Add_Extension.AMOS
    Fuzzy_Screen.AMOS
    Maze_Generator.AMOS
    Text_Editor.AMOS
    Explode.AMOS
    Gradient_Circle.AMOS
    Bouncing_Ball.AMOS
    Plasma.AMOS
    Funnyizer.AMOS

What do these programs do?
    Add_Extension.AMOS - Adds file extensions. Doesn't need Craft Extension
       anymore.
    Fuzzy_Screen.AMOS - Creates a fuzzy screen. No changes with this one.
    Maze_Generator.AMOS - Generates a maze. I made a recursive maze solver
       for this, but it ran out of stack space. :(
    Text_Editor.AMOS - A text editor. Still as crap as it was before.
    Explode.AMOS - Simulates an explosion. Now detects when all the bits
       have disappeared.
    Gradient_Circle.AMOS - Draws a gradiently filled circle. Now *much*
       faster, procedure driven, and it doesn't leave "holes".
    Bouncing_Ball.AMOS - A falling, bouncing ball. I'd left it in a silly
       state, it's now as it was meant to be. There *was* some problems
       with some of the example screens, but they are now all fixed.
    Plasma.AMOS - Draws a plasma. Procedurized, copies across the screen
       and fades the colours.
    Funnyizer.AMOS - Takes a word and funnyizes it. Now works on Ntsc.

What should I do now?
    Stop reading this, and have a look at the programs.
