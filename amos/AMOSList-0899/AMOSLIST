Hi

Does anyone have any code they can send me for reading
from a parallel port sampler cartridge?

Thanks

Hi Everybody,

   Using the info in the technosound manual I got data from one, but it didn't seem to be much use as when I played it as a sample it was just noise. 
Perhaps I have to sign the data, or maybe it couldn't sample it fast enough to get any meaningful sound from it?


   I don't seem to have a copy anywhere, but if no-one else has a /working /one, I could try getting it working again.


See ya.

How about learning Amal?:) It gives you chance to move things very smoothly without any kind of floating points...
It's not so hard to learn, really:D

   Ah, floating point no's are around 3 to 4 times slower then integer when compiled, but so what? My James Bond game uses a lot of floating point stuff and that runs fine, if it didn't have to contend with the blitter's speed it'd run at 50fps ;).

   If you want the game to remain at the same speed, add an automatic frame skipper, and store stuff like sin/cos's in a table instead of calling them directly.


See ya.

Points about Limit Mouse:

1 it uses the screen position, (128,50) as an offset
2. It uses low res coordinates, no matter what screen you are opening

so

Limit mouse 128,50 to 447,305

should work.

447= 128 (x offset default) + 319 (low res version of screen width, weird but
true)
305= 50 (y offset default [may be different on PAL)) +255 (low res again)

Hello Rune,
  I have found the UK aminet site has been inaccessable for the past few
weeks but the German mirror, http://de.aminet.net/aminet/, works just fine.

The last couple of days I have gotten a "Connection Refused" everytime I try

look up any of the AmiNet sites. Do I have a problem or have something
changed
or what?

my version of amospro(the AF one) won't accept 0 or 1

Tried that but still limited movement so I inserted and loop to print the
mouse co-ordinates and found that although I opened a screen of 640x256 the
mouse co-ordinates were top left 124,40 and bottom right 448,294 giving a
display of 320x256 for the mouse. I've fed these co-ords in and all is
well. Many thanks for your speedy response it's much appreciated.

I wish you well in the future with commercial stuff. Had Ocean released your
James Bond a few years ago as an official tie-in they perhaps wouldn't have
been lumbered with such a bad reputation for crappy film tie-ins like Total
Recall etc.
Many thanks too to Paolo Rinaldi who also helped with this problem.

Aminet is getting really dodgy lately.  It crashes all the time.

AFAIK the offset is not covered in the online Help for Amospro, hence my
struggles.

Hi Everybody,

   Yep, thats because it works in hardware co-ordinates.

By the way, After checking with the Amos manual, I was wrong about the limit mouse thing:

To set the mouse limit of the current screen (thats to the screen's boarders) all you have to do is:


Wait Vbl
Limit Mouse


   That way the mouse will be perfectly limited to the current screen.

(The wait vbl bit, apparently, is important)

See ya.

	I downloaded it today, will check it out, my Amos

sounds will ruin any music being played.  Also I am considering maye
maybe using DME to do the music bit, it is strange though, you
must specify a channel to shut off, then play a sound
then I guess turn the channel back on again for music...
Ok for games, but will be tricky on a system like this, where
I need to be able to handle any thing a user can throw at
the proggy..

	Anyway, I may release my code anyway, even knowing animatED
is out there, it seems similar but I have a few tricks up my sleeve that
may make the AMOS go at an Anim/Sound system worthwhile...

Subject: [amos-list] !James Bond on a GFX card screen!!
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   Whats that you say? You can't use a GFX card with amos?

Well, Think again! James Bond V0.98 is now out (cor, that was quick - ed) and this time it supports ANY GFX CARD!

Yes, thats right! Now all you BV/CV owners who were missing out because they didn't have a scandoubler can now finally play You Only Live Twice.

And if that wasn't enough, the CPU players are better and some bugs are fixed too ;)


   So, why not go to my homepage, Http://members.tripod.com/~mantasoft/ and download a copy of James Bond V0.98 now ;)




PS. James Bond has not yet been /tested/ on a gfx card, but the routines it uses have, so it should work no prob.

PPS. Does anyone have one of those 4-player adapters? I would /really/ like to know if James Bond actually works with it...

See ya.

Hi Everybody,

   Ok, I've started making some changes to my James Bond game to allow for a TCP network option, but I still can't figure out the GUI extention's TCP commands.

   So, has anyone at all got any example code of some simple TCP commands, say a Telnet program written in amos? please?

See ya.

Hi Everybody,

   Ok, I have more spasific questions about the TCP commands in the GUI ext:


How do I make it wait for someone to connect to you? I've tried opening the TCP port on my machine (my IP no.) but that fails.

   I want to make it set up a server for people to connect to, but I can't for the life of me work out how.

Also, how would that affect multiple logins? Like, what would happen if someone was connected to it, and someone else tried to connect?


Anyway, if anyone has any amos program that can communicate with another copy of it's self over the 'net could I plleeeaaaasssseee have a look at it?

See ya.

They are not quite like serial commands..

a server program needs to put a socket in listen mode, and when detects a
client connecting process the data from the client..

to have multiple connect sessions, you need to start the server <-->
communication in a separate thread, and then put the server socket back in
listen mode..

Well that works under win32 and unix, may be different using AMOS though..

What are you not understanding? They are almost exactly the same as serial
commands.

You would use inetd (part of your system in miami or whatever) and launch the
program that way, just like any other daemon. inetd will send the port info to
your program and you can read it using the Command Line$ instruction.

I've just started working on a Lunar Conquest INet version, so I'm wrestling
with the same problems.

I just told you. You'll have to experiment with the arguments and see how it
comes through, but it should launch properly that way.

Well, if the data can be kept separate, compile the program with gui mode, not
amos mode, so you can run multiple copies.

   Yeah, but they're far more complex, and I don't like complex things, I'm scared ;(

   Um, err, what is it? I'm afraid I haven't come across this thingy before ;(

Well, anyhow, if you do get it running, if you could send me some example networking code please? :)

   Oh no, I can't run it in GUI mode, it uses too much interupt stuff. I have the multitasker patcher though, it removes the switcher code. But could I run multiple copies to test it? Would it work if all copies were on my machine? (hmmm, perhaps I don't need my other A1200 after all....)

See ya.

Go into miami's interface, under interface and look at the inetd entries. You
could pick a port for your game, then set up a command to run it followed by
the port data parameters.

Will do. bug me occasionally. I've got a fair bit of time this week (um,
actually its disappearing rapidly) to get started on it.

Quite possibly.

Depends on whether you want multiple users logging in. I think you can set
inetd to only spawn 1 process.

   Well, I don't use Miami, I use AmiTCP Genesis. I'd better check it has it...

Ah yes, here we go. I've got a section in the prefs and an exe. Lets see If I can work out how to use it. Well I can't understand all that in the prefs, lets try running it:

11.Workbench:> inetd ?
SERVPRI/K/N,TOOMANY/K/N,DEBUG/S,CONFIGFILE: 
inetd: already exists

   Um, hmmm, err, what does that mean?

So, could I run this from my amos program, like say Exec "Inetd blah blah blah" or would the user have to set all that up manualy if he wanted to host a game?

Also, is the Inetd system used in Miami and genesis different? Would I need two routines to handel each?

   Well, the only incentive I have is that the sooner you can do that, the sooner /I/ can add TCP support to JamesBond (thats, if you like JB that is...)

   Anyway, cheers ;)

   Ah good, I have a funny feeling it would be a lot easer having 4 seperate ports for the different players.

See ya.

--BOUNDARY.30211888.1
Content-Type: text/plain

Hi,
   I'm doing a game in AMOS, sort of like Grand Theft Auto, only
wihtout the cars (at the moment anyway ;) and have just done a
map scroller test, because I've NEVER done a scrolling game before ;)

The map data is stored inside the program ATM (see below) and all
files needed are included.

My questions are:

    1) Why do the map graphics trash up when you go so far down (and I
       don't mean the flickery bands, the palette changes!)
    2) Why do the flickery bands show up.
    3) How can I store the map data in a file and read it in later?
    4) Why is it, that about three quarters of the way DOWN the map,
       everything goes white, and bobs won't show up on it. When I was using
       an IFF instead of a map tiles, this area refused to show up the main
       player bob, or the others. why?

To move your bloke around, use the joystick, and aim and shoot with
the left mouse button, and the mouse. Shooting is not detected between
different bobs yet tho ;)

Please help, this is driving me insane!
Cya!
Gaz.

Miami, AmiTCP and Genesis (which is just a GUI for AmiTCP) works in the exact
same way AFAIK.

It will, they all do.

InetD is always running, for it is your own personal port monitor/manager.

No, you set up an entry in your database for InetD like this:

Port 453 myprog parameters

and when someone addresses your system on port 453, it will run your program
and pass the parameters you specify to it, allowing you to make a tcp
connection.

InetD is just a program launcher, basically. It works the same across the
board. You'll have to find out how the prameters are dealt with, but amos can
read them.

   Your problem is simple, it is the same problem I had while writing JamesBond:

   Your screen is too big.

I'm afraid you're limited to about 640x512, otherwise at a certain point down the screen almost none of the Amos gfx commands will work. (as you have found) 

   The only alternative is, I know the Turbo extentions F 16proc Icon command will work on a screen that big, I have no idea about bobs though, prehaps the PBOB extention'll work?

   
>    3) How can I store the map data in a file and read it in later?
 
   easy, first you write a level editor, then do this:

'sx - x size of map
'sy - y size of map

Dim MAP(sx,sy)


------------ level editor bit goes here ----


sav:  Rem suproutine for saving.
   open out 1,FILENAME$
   For x=0 to sx
      for y=0 to sy
         Print #1,map(x,y)
      next
   next
   close 1
return

lod:  Rem suproutine for loading.
   open in 1,FILENAME$
   For x=0 to sx
      for y=0 to sy
         input #1,map(x,y)
      next
   next
   close 1
return

then just use the 'lod' subroutine ingame.



See ya.

Hi Andrew Crowe

gave

the

I used your info to get some sampling done, the
quality
seems quite poor, with a strange metallic edge to it. 
I'm
investigating using the system timer interrupts to
record
at a sensible rate, rather than having delay code. 
The
hardware reference manual doesn't mention samplers at
all.
There may be some small differences between
Technosound
and Megalosound (which I have) samplers too.  Maybe
I'm
trying to sample too quickly?  (Before I put in the
delay
all I got was noise).

Usage of program: sample >sample.raw
I use octamed to convert the unsigned data from the
sampler
into signed Amiga samples.

/* sample.e */

PROC main()
	DEF buffer[8000] : ARRAY OF CHAR
	sample(buffer, 8000)
	Write(stdout, buffer, 8000)
ENDPROC

PROC sample(buffer, length)
	Disable()           -> turn off interrupts (is this
needed?)
	-> initialise
	MOVE.L	length,D0
	SUBQ.W	#1,D0       -> dbcc tests =-1
	MOVE.L	buffer,A0
	MOVE.B	#0,$BFE301	-> enable input
	MOVE.B	#6,$BFD200  -> enable channels
	MOVE.B	#2,$BFD000  -> select left channel (4 = right)
	MOVE.L	#$BFE101,A1
	-> 7 MHz processor, 22050 kHz sample rate => 324
clock cycles
	-> all the NOPs below waste 256 cycles
loop:
	MOVE.B	(A1),(A0)+
	NOP;NOP;NOP;NOP; NOP;NOP;NOP;NOP; NOP;NOP;NOP;NOP;

   So, what would happen? Say I was at IP addy w.x.y.z and someone from a different one called TCP OPEN 1,"w.x.y.z/453" what would happen? 

   Would the program just run whatever? What would it output? How would I then use that to open the connection to the other person?


   And finally, can I set this up on the fly? I really would not expect people to have to set up about 6 different ports on there own just so they could host a game of James Bond. (thats how many I think I'd need, because trying to do it all with one port would get rather messy I think)

   I mean, Quake can set up a listening port without messing about like that, so there must be a way?  Anyone?

I thought so.

So how would I do what I want to do then? Say, have a map the same
size as the one I have now, only on a 640x512 screen. I ideally wanna
stick to lowres. Consequently, instead of using Screen Offset, I'd
have to use something else. Has anyone got any formulae, ideas, CODE?
(hint hint ;)) would AMOS TOME be any good for this (I'm using Pro, if
so, how do I install TOME?)

I have'nt got either of them. Are they freely available?

   My homepage is now the only place you can get it I'm afraid.

   Well, I have a FAST infinite map scrolling routine (50fps on my amiga). Unfortunatly it is too complex for even me to understand propperly, so it's really no use any anyone I'm afraid. (Not even me ;(

   I can send it to you anyway though, but you have been warned. ;)


   By the way, apparently TOME is no good I'm afriad.

I guess you'll just have to reduce the map a little?

   Turbo is free, off the Amos factory homepage.

   Easier then writing the game anyway.

See ya.

Well, the inetd would then launch your program, and pass the other person's
port data, so you could execute your tcp open command, thus establishing the
link.

Hi Andrew
On the 08-Aug-99 you said something about [amos-list] Re: What's wrong with this! so now I am going to offer a witty retort (well maybe :)

Right. I've used a text editor (BED) to create my map file, which
looks like this (or part of it does anyway ;)

11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
11122222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222111
11122222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222111

etc. etc. Now, when I try and load that in using the routine above, I
get "Input too long at line xx". Now I'm guessing that AMOS is
attempting to read the ENTIRE line into the variable. Is there a way
of making it retrieve the first character in the line, and then the
next, and then the next and so on and so on.

I REALLY do not want my map files to look like this

1
1
1
1
1
1
etc. etc. ;)

   Yuch, there has to be a better way?  Anyway, wouldn't the other persons TCP request just bomb out with a timeout error? Or would it work?

Also, could I get it to lanch the Echo command and have it print the details to ram and have my program pick them up? 

See ya.

   you could load them as strings, but you'd have to set Bed to save as LF+CR or AMOS won't accept it.

   That would be one way of doing it

   Well, if you have a map editor then it wouldn't matter what the save format was like.... (Once you have a map editor you can develope a compressed format etc.)

From:   "Sasu Lintula" <samali@utu.fi>

Hi all,

just have to tell you that the Pinball Construction Kit ([pre-]beta) is finally seeing light:D It's going to be so good that I'm trying to $ell it somewhere - actually never thought that it could work at all:P

There's an one 'little' problem - Aga-support; At the mo PCK uses 32-colours which is essential for speed and reasonable memory usage, but I have to update it (at least later) to use Agas 256 colours. One possibility is to rewrite PCK to Blitz but I really don't want to do that 'cause I've used mainly Amal - it would be pain:((( The best solution should be the AmosNG but nothing has happened for ages, or has it? So, what's up with it, Pietro (are you on this list anymore?)? Peter, where's your Aga-extension?
I really want to stick with amos but it seems that there's no other way:( - hope you see my point...

There's other thing; I need more beta-testers with different configs. At the moment there are only Andy (H), Christopher and Palle who has promised to help me out:|

   I don't want it to actually run the program if someone wants to connect though, that would be very annoying if you didn't want to have a game,

I just want it to tell the program, when the program is on the title screen, so that it can open a connection then.

See ya.

Heyas,

It's a AI Eliza'ish program, but it acually learns words as you give it

Subject: [amos-list] The king lives...
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Garfield Benjamin" <gbenjam@sosbbs.com>

Hello.

   This is just a quick message to let you all know that the king
  (me dammit, not Elvis!!!) is alive.  LOL  

  So, what ever happened to CBATNAM?!
  My Amiga is packed in a box back in Pennsylvania (I am now
  living in Missouri) so I cannot do much to help but I am quite
  sure I have the .lha archive for my stage!  Thinking about 
  putting it on my website.

   What about the rest of you guys?  Hell, at least if we did
   that people could enjoy the work we putinto this thing!!

Garfield

A couple of years ago I was writing a game that used mapdata and I found a
way to store the map as hex in a file. the map[ can be up to any size you
want it (mine was 512x512) and took up one meg of hard disk space so if
this interest you can you please send me a message and I'll send to code
with an explanation of how to use it to you.

Even worse :). It want to load your whole file in the variable.
AMOS usually uses 2 characters to tell when the line end, but standard
Amiga texteditors use only 1. To use normal textfiles you got to tell
AMOS to use the normal Amiga textfiles standard:

Set Input 10,-1

But you also got to do something about the fact it loads the complete line.
(And I think you switched the X and Y too... The horizontal lines in the texteditor
are vertical lines in your program?)
The best way is to do:

Set Input 10,-1
Open In 1,FILENAME$
For Y=0 To SY
  Line Input #1,MYLINE$
  For X=0 To SX
     MAP(X,Y)=MID$(MYLINE$,X,1)
  Next X
Next Y

I havn't tested it but it should work :).

Yeah, a real good point.  Current state of it: Levels (mostly) complete,
combined code debugging and strapping together under way(cough), and the
sound is dead wierd - but I think with CD-sound it'll be problem solved.

The game will be available on CD, or as a massive download as soon as
possible, but with the current state of my stuff, it seems to be one delay
after another.  Maybe I should get amos installed on the emulator (cough).

Giark, if you are listening, any high-quality sampled sound (don't care what
format, as long as I can read it) and to any other members, if there is
anything outstanding, SEND IT to me, and we'll drag it out.  This has been
too long a time waiting and would be nice to finally see it in one go.

In the mean time, the more you pester me to get it put together, the more
likley it becomes, and the more submissions (you know who you are) the more
likley it becomes.  A *LOT* of work has gone into it already, it would be
nice to see things in the final finished form.

I will dig up the traces on the various machines they inhabit and
re-assemble things as soon as I have a chance.  Why is it I get bored, but
still have a hundred things to do ?

The CD case is already designed though....

..etc.

I still have all the data that was sent to me. I think you have it as well.
Whatever happened to all the artists that were doing pics? One after another,
they volunteer, then disappear.

I had a system of intro setup thing sort of kind of like, but my artist
disappeared. It was a cool intro, too. 

>Giark, if you are listening, any high-quality sampled sound (don't care what

Like what? I thought we had all the sound covered. BTW, my intro was a
complete Cap'n bubba intro story, shown on a tv screen with cool japanime
effects. Damn artists! Get back here!

I have done this and just used the Amigas append command to join the split
files back together. Works fine.

This would create a file consisting of ascii-strings seperated by linefeeds.
A bit unprofessional, I would say.

Better to use:

  'sx:size-x ; sy:size-y
  dim map(SX-1,SY-1)

  ' (editor here)
  End

  sav:
    open out 1,filename$
    sprint 1,varptr(map(0,0)) to varptr(map(0,0))+sy*sx*4
    close 1
  return

  lod:
    open in 1,filename$
    sload 1 to varptr(map(0,0)),sy*sx*4
    close 1
  return

Which creates a raw file containg sy*sx longwords.

Take a look at an A500.

Ask the A500 to show a VBl-timed animation syncronized to some sampled music.
Then ask the PeeCee to do the same.

The A500 would win.

The funny thing is, that if you /do/ have an FPU then double precision is much
faster than single precision (see, AMOS single doesn't use the FPU at all)
Just a little optimizing tip :)

> I really want to stick with amos but it seems that there's no other way:( - hope you see my point...

My extension did RTG too, but I canceled it cos noone liked GMS, and the
entire extension was based on it. There was a pre beta out, it only did 
basic pixel handling, iff loading, p61 support and a few other bits.
Before it was out I did have bobs working, but I had a new, better
design for how it should handle them, so I removed my old bob code
and started to code the new ideas I had for the bobs, that was when it
was canceled, so the pre-release beta never did do bobs. But it fully
did AGa on all of its commands, and they were all much faster than
the amos equivilents(like much much much faster :). After the prebeta
I pretty much stopped it altogeather cos of all of the GMS moans,
I remember adding c2ps into it, they used EBH and got 47.3fps. on 
my 030. But I never released them.

As for pietro, I think his amiga has died completely. I remember
he was having trouble with it a few months ago. If you like, Ill contact
the other members of the Amos NG group to find out about it ?

That's what Pietro Ghizzoni told me in a message about amos..

I'm looking for the amos pro compiler, can anyone send it to me (I also
understand that it also updates AMOS Pro 1.12 to AMOS Pro 2.00) and last,
but not lease, does anyone know of an online version of the AMOS Pro manual?
I lost mine in a move..

Other that that, can anyone recommend any essential extensions..

BTW - James Bond rocks.. even on my PII 333 ;-)

I dont want to shatter your expectations, but I honestly doubt a
release this september. That couldnt have been last september cos 
the sources wernt even released then.

True, but also dont forget Jama3d, although its probably 3d only (some
part of the name sort of suggested that to me :). It claims to have
linux & MaC ports planned.

If it is going to happen, it will be quite portable. Of course,
most of the compiler, and gfx/sfx handling routines probably wont be.

   Ok, how are the TCP stuff comming? how are the TCP stuff comming? 

Have you worked out InetD, 'cos it seems you can't simply stick a port down, you have to do a loada other stuff in Services menu and IneD's menu and probably some more stuff as well...

   PPLLLEEEAAASSSEEE say there is an easier way, PPLLLEEEAAASSSEEE!

I think there is no doubt that AMOSProNG is THE most eagerly
awaited AMOS-related program...... not to put any further pressure
on the release date, mind ;)

Hi Rune
On the 11-Aug-99 you said something about Re: [amos-list] Re: What's wrong with this! so now I am going to offer a witty retort (well maybe :)

That's all well and good, and I tahnk you for the suggestion, but
unfortunately SPrint and SLoad don't tokenise. Is it part of an
extension? Don't say AMCAF please, because I have that installed!
A file of ASCII's would be unprofessional yes, and I have no idea how
to go about making my own file format!

That's why AmigaOS file notification would be useful
here:

1:Your program asks the OS to be notified when a file
(say ENV:mynotifyfile) is modified.

2:InetD (or whatever) starts a program that modifies
the file.

3:The OS sends a message to your program telling it
the
file has been changed.

(3) only happens if you did (1) before (2) happens.


(File notification is part of AmigaOS 2.04+ I think)

From: "Andy \"Mushroom\" Kellett" <mushypd@redrose.net>

For those of you who haven't heard just yet, I purchased F1 Software, 5th
Dimension licenseware, and all of Phil's other Amiga pieces and copyrights
whilst I was in the last stages of my trip to England.

Later on today, I will be releasing a large(ish) press release regarding
the whole matter, so you can read about a lot more stuff there. The URL
will be http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/f1purchase.html for those
interested, it should be up later today.

Over the course of the next few weeks, I would like to introduce a lot more
software into the library, and that's why im mailing here first. All of my
current best-selling titles have been written in AMOS, and are currently
making their programmers a lot of money. I know that there are a lot of you
here on the list writing new games, utilities and internet app's, and if
some of you are interested in making a lot of royalties from your work,
then email me and talk to me. I would like to see a working version of your
program. I strongly beleive in AMOS as most of you know, and would still
like to see a lot of good quality games written in it.

If anyone has any questions or queriers, feel free to email me at
mushypd@redrose.net. If you know anyone interested in getting their work
published who isn't on this list, then forward this mail to them. Thanks.

SLoad and SSave (sprint doesn't exist!) are normal AMOSPro commands.

Actually, SLoad and SSave are part of the music extension. The 'S'
was for Sample, to use for double buffered sample playing, but they
are very handy for many other things, too.

Hi,
   Cheers to Andrew (Crowe), Rune and anyone who helped me with that
map editor prob. Special thanx go to Andrew for fixing the goddamn
thing ;)

Cheers Rune for that map loader/saver, and thanx to whoever it was who
pointed out that it was SSave and not SPrint. I can't reember his
name, because all mails go straight to deleted items on my system
(unless they are REALLY, MEGA, important ;)
Cya!
Gaz.

Hi All,
        Eric here (old wrinkly).  Regards to splitting files on the PC with
"FSplit"  I have done this, as I was sent Imagine and couldn't fit it on
floppies.  It split the file okay and had imagine.ca1 - .ca4 and
imagine.fsi.  I could not find the append command in WB 3 or 2, so I was
unable to use the files.  I did try the "Join" command and although it
joined the files to one, it would not run.  Firstly, where is the append
command to be had and secondly, what am I doing wrong.
                        Thanks.
                                    Old Wrinkly.

Hi Everybody,

  I did try the "Join" command and although it
> joined the files to one, it would not run.

   What do you mean it wouldn't run? What error message did Lha give?

Also, if in doubt, download MUIJoin or simmilar from aminet and use that :)

See ya.

To whoever asked about amos and comms,

Can't remember but someone wanted info about using Amos with a modem.
 Don't know if the persons question was answered but heres a program
I wrote a few years ago for when Sysops have to repair their BBSes
and need a message system setup.

The colours don't show because at the time I didn't realise how to show
them but now I know.

Hope this is of some use or whatever...

Toodle Pip!

Anyone know anything about the Commodore 64 Internet machine I saw on QVC
the other night ?

All I know is that it exists.

Hi Keith
On the 14-Aug-99 you said something about [amos-list] Question so now I am going to offer a witty retort (well maybe :)

> Anyone know anything about the Commodore 64 Internet machine I saw on QVC
> the other night ?

The C64 WebIT? Its not COmmodore I don't think, they just used C64 so people
could associate with it. I think its a 64-bit (no shit) machine, with full
net capabilities. But, like most 8-bit systems of old, it relies on
interrupts for sound (j/k) :)

> All I know is that it exists.

Yea, and at a hefty price as welll!

Oh dear, I'm sorry. I obviously shouldn't rely on my memory anymore (too
many drugs in the 60's!). 'Join' is what I was thinking of, I dont know why
I thought it was append.
I have done this operation successfully. I used Split on the PC. Make sure
that you join the files in the correct order. The command template is Join
fileA fileB AS fileC. Note no commas between file names. Are you sure of
the final file name?

The memory loss is probably triggered by word association problems like
Join/Joint and Split/Spliff. Oh dear back to the Camberwell Carrots again.

You can use a regular C64 on the internet via a shell account. A couple of
guys I talk to on IRC use their C64's online, its quite amazing!

You might have downloaded it on the pc in ascii format.
PC browsers don't know lha and lzx and might try to download them as text.
They also convert those textfiles to pc format so all chr$($A) characters
will be changed into chr$($A)+chr$($D) ;)).
Try FixLHA which is on Aminet which reverses that effect.
Then it should work.

Thanks Andrew and Neil,
                The error message I get in LHA is "Warning skipping
corrupt/extraneous data.  Bad decoding table.
I am calling the final file imagine.lha, the split files are imagine.ca1 -
.ca4 and imagine.fsi.  Is the imagine.fsi part of the files? if not, what is
it.  Also what is the web address at which I can get this MUIJoin.
            Thanks.
                    Eric.

does anyone know where I can get the amos pro compiler? I use the amos pro that came on a very old AF disk... but I'm told it should still work...
BTW - has anyone thought of converting amoslist to egroups.com? it's got a much nicer interface, IMHO :)

Yes... there is a easier way. You're considering the problem form the wrong point of view.

It seems that several peoples are interested in internet gaming, but the ideas are a bit confused ;)

Make your game acts like a server is not the best solution, mainly for one
reason:

If i want to play with you, i need to know if you are on-line and mainly
your IP address. HOW????? Maybe:

Using ICQ or IRC i can obtain your IP, but it's boring.... a solution  is to
obtain a 24h on-line dedicated server wich share your IP address to all the
connected  players ( ... like the ICQ servers does when you're connected ) but
not everyone is so lucky to own a server :)

The secret is to use the public available tecnologies... and in the above
case the solution is.... suspence....... IRC!

Several applications use the IRC method in order to solve problems like
this... you've not to consider IRC just like a users CHAT, but it's
dedicated for the applications too!!

There are several IRC servers around the world.. a good news since the
players can use a local connection. Now... how can i use IRC for the game?

Solution:

Your game will works as a small IRC client and not as server... you've to open a
connection with a IRC server, and create a dedicated Channel for your
game.. for example JBonds.

When the players join the channel, your program will be informed, and you (..
your program) are able to play (chat) with all the players or just some of them.

For the protocol to use, you can be inspired by the other internet protocols like HTTP,FTP,IRC an so on. Just use simple ASCII commands... for example if you want to move a player you can send a command (message) like this:

MOVE James,50,90

when the program receive the above msg it moves the player James to the map coordinates 50,90.

Using IRC you can send the message to all the players connected at the
JBonds channel, or just one of them so your're able to setup a complete
enviroment.

I've not tried your game, and so i don't know what it does exactly.. anyway
you've just to create a command for every possible action of your game...
like:

move,kill,fire,escape and so on...

and send them trough the IRC channel to the other players.

That's all folks!

Oh yuck.  That's all the Internet needs, more excessively verbose
protocols.  It's not very Amiga either, to use 16 (plus IRC protocol)
bytes when 3 will do.  You have replaced a simple Internet port
programming problem with a complex "first write an IRC client, then
write your protocol on top" problem.

Inetd is designed to listen on certain ports, and start a new instance
of a particular server proggy for each incoming connection.  Since your
proggy still needs to do everything except listening for a connection,
you are probably better off simplifying things by just adding the
"listen for a connection" part yourself.

I can't solve this particular problem for you though, I don't even have
AMOS Internet extensions.

Oh, and do us all a favour, design a compact protocol that uses all 8
bits of the bandwidth, rather than having every 8th bit wasted.  It's
well overdue that the Internet changed to 8 bit protocols instead of 7
bit protocols and all the encoding that has to go on to cater for
sending 8 bit data through a 7 bit protocol working over an 8 bit link. 
This sort of madness probably wastes about one quarter of all available
bandwidth just on un-needed overhead.  All to cater for some ancient
systems that probably only exist in museums now.

Sorry about that, it's a pet peeve of mine.  All the reasons for using
innefficient protocols on the Internet went away a long time ago, and
most of then probably didn't exist when the bulk of protocols where
designed.

Can you explain the difference?

I know you must be sick of hearing this but have you an update on what you
have been up to while you were away?  Relating to AMOS of course.

Ok... you're right!  I know the problem but.... i've just solved *ALL* the
problems in the *most easy to use solution* for all the AMOS coders.

Problem... i'm on-line, and i want to play with you, but i don't know
if you're on-line and your IP address.. how can i open a connection with
your port???.... and  the "simple internet port programming" is simple only if you know how it works ;)

I belive again in the IRC solution because:

- you don't need any specific inetd/sockets knowledge (probably only the 2%
of the users on the list has some real knowledge about it) so everyone can
use it.

- the IRC protocol is VERY simple to use

- you don't need to code a FULL IRC client.. just the essentials are
needed. There is a AmosIRC client example already done in the GUI Extension
archive.

Sure...  it's not the best professional way... but it is a /valid and/
/working solution!/  About the protocol format.. i agree with your point of you.. obviously the format can (must!) be reduced. See below...

Not a problem... take the .fd file of the bsdsocket.library and the FD
Extension builder.... in few seconds you'll obtain a ready  to use
extension with all the bsd functions inside!

Hey... it's just a stupid example to explain easly the situation.

You can reduce the 16 bytes to just 3 byets.. example:

the MOVE command can be just the letter M...

the coordinates 50 and 90 can be their ASCII equivalent.. the chr$(50) is
the char 2 and the chr$(90) is the letter Z so:

M2Z (3 bytes!)

can be interpreted as MOVE 50,90

there are even better solutions.... this is just a hint.

I agree. My examples was so expanded in order to explain better the idea.
Is up to the coder to optimize and setup the  protocol.

   ...But, wouldn't that be rather slow? And what if people joined in the chat thing and started mucking about with it?

   Also, that method just would not be practical at all in an action game, I'd have to be able to send and recieve binary, you can't do that with IRC could you?

   That would be a good way of starting a game automatically, but it would just not work for the actual game.

   Well, it's a good idea but unfortunatly not practical for a game like James Bond :(   it'd work for a statergy game, but not an action game :(


   So, how would you set your amiga as a server? ;)

See ya.

   I couldn't see how InetD would listen for ports, and how amos'd connect to em.  And the current GUI extention has no 'listen for a connection' feature as far as I can see.

   The Gui extention.

   Wouldn't a direct TCP connection be 8 bit?



   So, Pietro, how about doing a 'open listening port' command for the gui extention ?  plleeeaaaassseeeee :)

See ya.

First, you must decide which port you want to use for your game, for example
234. Now, you make an entry in inetd, for port 234, that will launch your
program and send the parameter that contains the incoming port data, for
example:

jamesbond %p (I'm not sure of the format for the variable)

in your program, you do:

prt$=Command Line$

this reads a command line when your program starts, similar to vt ram:pic.iff
and prt$ would be "ram:pic.iff" (Try it, amos programs can be started with
command line parameters)

Tcp Open prt$

or whatever the syntax is.

So, when inetd gets a hit on port 234, it launches your program, passing the
info on what port to connect back to. Your program then starts up, connecting
to the user who is waiting on port 234.

Clear now?

Hi Everybody,

   But what about speed? Syncronising 3 or 4 people over IRC isn't going to be that fast is it? & wouldn't it slow down the entire IRC server, as they aren't designed to handle untolled numbers of people sending multiple packets every screen update...

   But why not just use an IRC server as a game listings, showing everyone that's online and then letting you connect to them?

   But what about characters under 32 or over 128? Would these show up, or be scrubbed by the irc server?

   Anyway, I'm still pretty sure that using IRC will be too slow, as I think I'd have to send about 15-20 packets between computers per update, but ok ok, I'll give it a shot.

See ya.

   No no no no, that really wouldn't work becuase:

I don't want the game loaded up JUST becuase someone's accessing that port on your computer, that'd be silly as anyone could start JamesBond on your amiga even if you really didn't want to.


   Why not just do

Echo >RAM:tmp %p

and then where the program checks for a connection:

if exist("ram:tmp")
   open in 1,"ram:tmp"

   etc etc...


   Although I still don't see how InetD is supposed to be set up, and having people try to set it up on there own is asking a bit much I think...


   Well, anyway, thanks for trying :)

See ya.

   Ok people, does anyone know ANY way of logging onto the same server with both AMOS and AmIRC? It's a bit hard testing the IRC solution when you can't see what's happening :(

You use the services entries to set the port data up

Why else would someone be accessing port 234 (to stick with our example)?

For a net game where people link, somewhere there needs to be a server,
running all the time, to route the traffic. Only a direct link from 1 computer
to 1 computer, no other parties, can operate without a middle man. Someone
will have to be running a james bond hub. That's where inetd comes in.

Bitch at the miami guy for not having any docs. I've set up my own web servers
and pop3 (mail) servers, so it is not all that difficult.

Hi Everybody,

   Ok, I don't suppose anyone would be kind enough to give me an example, using the Gui extention, to read a text file from a website?

   I've tried, but for some reason it just won't do it. I remember there being a program that got the Aminet recent list, but I can't find it anywhere...

See ya.

iRC will be WAY to slow!
It normally has a 3second lag!

But, Ive got a better idea :)
You could run it through the partyline in #amos!!!
(its on my new bot "Karma" in #amos)

once in the partyline, everything is taken off the irc servers,
and it is handled directly by the bot, which is running on a
damn fast server. It runs just like a mini irc server, appart
from theres no lag at all.

To use it, you will need to log on to irc as normal, you dont
need to join channels or anything, just dcc chat with the bot,
and when you are speaking to the bot, via dcc chat, it sends the
message to everyone else who is dcc chatting to it. You should
get a quite fast speed through it. It will definately be
faster than irc. At the moment, the partyline is fully
functional appart from atm, it doesnt let you upload
files onto it, cos I dont want people to fill my hd
with files :) But you wont need that unless your putting
a autoupdate jamesbond thing in it :)

cya,

I think checking out "amarquee.library" might be worth while,
It has server support. you would just need to do some lib calls,
and you prolly wont have much probs with it.

X-Status: 

From: Neil Ives <neil.ives@btinternet.com>

Hello, AMOS experts.
Can you shed any light on this please?
My Amos Pro has been behaving strangely lately. Often the Compiler screen
takes some (5) seconds to appear when called from the editor, also the
editor takes some time to quit, occasionaly blacking the screen for many
seconds. Just this week a strange AMOS style message has started to appear.
I'll try and reproduce it in ASCII text.

Hope that comes out OK.

Any ideas?


Kind regards

Subject: [amos-list] Amos IRC program.
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   Ok, I have a small request:

I have tried, and failed to adopt the AmosIRC program for use as a James Bond netgaming forum. So, I'm asking very nicely if someone could try writing:

   A Simple IRC program (simple as in so that /I/ can understand how it works :), that runs asyncro. (the main loop needs to be constantly updated) and finally, that uses the amos custom screen.

   If you would write one, I'd be really really greatful.

I'll be a bit more specific: 

A) Could it please only have a very simple interface using 1 or more AMOS screens (I can integrate it into my own iface later;) where it sends and recieves messages and the basic IRC commands.

b) Could it also be able to get a list of everyone on that channel and put it into an array, on demand?

c) Could it be simply written with lots of REMS please? Contrary to popular belief, I'm not an expert in programming :)


   Anyway, any help I get will be very much aprechiated :)

See ya.

   Here's the scene: You are happily surfing the net or playing quake online etc., when suddenly some ideot thinks 'I know, lets give whoever a game of james bond' and then puts in there IP no. without telling them. Suddenly a copy of James Bond jumps onto the screen, causing much annoyance.

   AmiTCP btw.

Anyway, I managed to get it working, you forgot to tell me to add an entry in 'services' and then fiddle about with the cli command.

As I've go a program that outputs the command line its given to a file in ram, but lo, I can't get it to output any kind of IP no. or anything.

   And AMOS locks up when I try to do anything with the port...

   Besides, I don't want to have to expect poor people to fiddle about in the settings like that.

   Quake can have a direct TCP connection between two computers, why not GUI TCP commands?


See ya.

Very simple to do.

I'll add it to the list. I had a bot running before, you might recall. But I

Only the server end. As in, one computer sets up inetd, the hub. Others just
connect to it. You wouldn't set up inetd for all users. Others would hit the
hub.

Even worse. Q8-{)

I don't know the parameter, but it will do it. I'm fiddling about with it
myself.

The one that is reported or the one you set up?

They wouldn't.

Now, let's try to get on the same page. I'm talking about a game with three or
more people logged in at once, as you originally stated. If you only want to
direct connect person a to berson b, that is dead simple. The irc example
would do fine. Or, for that matter, any kind of connection where you can get
the ip or domain or whatever of the person you want to connect to. Even just a
little window saying 'enter ip number to connect to'. 

I think you still have to set up the port so your system will let it work, but
I may be wrong. Once you know the ip to connect to (both ends need to know the
other guys ip), you just instruct one guy to open the port (he would be like a
host) and the other connect to it (he would be the user). It's easy to set
that as a flag, then the host program would initiate all data transfers, the
user would respond. bingity bangity boo. I've done similar stuff with my
serial game "dungeon", using dialup instead of net connect, but the idea is
the same.

   Ok, I've found what was causing probs with my first try:

1. 'TCP OPEN' seems to lock up if amos is in front ?!

2. Gui Event causes 'Amos to back' whenever its called.


   I'm still having trouble with it though :(

See ya.

   But Tcp Open only works one way. There is no 'Tcp Listen(port)' type command.

   IRC would be totally useless for ingame, as a) its slow and b) everyone would get kicked off for flooding.

   IRC is perfect for doing the pre-game forum though, for people to find each other and start games etc. (Which is what I'm trying now... :)

   Yeah, thats what I'm after but I really think there should be an easier way then using InetD. Surely it can't be that hard to add a Tcp Listen(port) command or whatever, can it?

See ya.

Hi Everybody,

   Ok, I've /almost /found what kept crashing my attempt at an IRC proggy:

1) Tcp Open seems to lock up if the Amos screen is in front. bug?

2) Gui Wait and Gui Event force amos to back, even when I a) really really really don't want it to and b) even though I called Amos Lock. Any way of stopping this or a way of catching incomming TCP stuff without it?

See ya.

You wouldn't need it, maybe. We're getting too theoretical here. You're trying
to force me to start programming again, aren't you?

Well, for just direct person to person, I don't think you'd need inetd. It
would take a bit of experimenting with the command. If you and I knew each
other's ip numbers and you did a tcp open port 1.1.1.1/234 (or whatever), then
I did the same, using your ip instead, I think they would hook up. Anyone
doing any experimenting with direct tcp connect yet?

Pietro? Possible to add a tcp wait command in there that doesn't rely on the
gui stuff?

Hi,
Have anyone managed somehow  to get all eight hardware sprites on screen at the same time?  
I have a pice of code using sprite numbers 0 to 7 but Amos only shows only one sprite of each group (0/1,2/3,4/5,6/7). In the manual there's nothing of missing pairs but all example code in manual folder are based only on four sprites.

You must make sure that your sprites have a maximum of 4 colours (2
bitmaps), otherwise the sprite system uses pairs of sprites to display any
more than 4 colours. Also, if you use hardware scrolling for left/right
then you can't use sprites 6 & 7 (this is a hardware limitation according
to the manual).

Cheers,
    Steve.

   Sounds like you're using 16 colour sprites, right?

If you use 16 colour sprites, they actually use 2 sprites. If you need 8, either use 4 colour sprites, or use computed sprites (no. 8 onwads). 

   Or use bobs instead?

See ya.

Hi Everybody,

> 
>   A Simple IRC program (simple as in so that /I/ can understand how it works >:), that runs asyncro. (the main loop needs to be constantly updated) and >finally, that uses the amos custom screen.

   Ok, after that desperate plee for help, I managed to make one myself anyway. (typical eh?).

   The problem was trying to get the commands working when amos was in front, which just didn't work. I solved this by using the intuition ext. to use a pubscreen.    As James Bond already supports pubscreen, using the current GUI ext commands would work, but there'd be not custom screen mode option while having a net game.

PS. Pietro, how about not forcing amos to back when calling Gui Event, and please fix the TCP OPEN when amos is in front bug?

   On the subject of net James Bond, I have almost finished the comms routine, I've got it to save all the outgoing packets (thats from the host to the remote copies). I've found that it uses around 100-200 bytes per frame. Say the game was running at 15fps, that'd make the total outgoing bandwith around 18kbits, which is quite a lot, but a fast connection between to 56kbit modems /should /be ok. (not taking into consideration net lag etc.)

   Using IRC for this game data would be impossible, because that is about 2-3k of binary data every seccond, and IRC just isn't designed for this kind of application.

   PPS. Thanks for the idea Rev. Giark, but I already tried TCP open on someone else, it just fails.  It seems that the program has to open that port for someone to connect to, and so far (hu-hum Pietro) there seems to be no command that does this....


   PPPS. Can someone send me a program that downloads a text file from a webpage please, I can't work out how to :(


See ya.

Nope, my sprites have only one colour by this way:
spr0    - col 17
spr1    - col 19
spr2    - col 21
spr3    - col 23
spr4    - col 25
spr5    - col 27
spr6    - col 29
spr7    - col 31

So all of them should be visible but aren't:(

   is that the actually colour the sprites are painted in?

If you're using 4 colour sprites, make sure that the images are *4* colours. (as in drawn on a 4 colour screen). 

Even if they only have 4 colours in them, if they are on a 16+ colour screen then they count as 16 colour sprites.


The pallette for 4 colour sprites goes like this:

Sprite 0 &1 

sprite colour 1  -> screen colour 17
sprite colour 2  -> screen colour 18
sprite colour 3  -> screen colour 19

sprite 2 & 3

1 - 21
2 - 22
3 - 23

sprite 4 & 5

1 - 25
2 - 26
3 - 27

sprite 6 & 7

1 - 29
2 - 30
3 - 31


See ya.

Eh. Sorry, that's not the way it works...
The hardware doesn't "count" the colours you use. So even if you only use a
few colours on a 32 colour screen the hardware assumes that you use all 32
colours.
To tell AMOS that your sprites are in only 4 colours you have to grab them
from a four colour screen.
The sprites will then use the folowing colours in the palette:

Sprite   Colours
 8+1      17-19
 2+3      21-23
 4+5      25-27
 6+7      29-31

For some reason Europress thought it very clever to rename sprite 0 to sprite
8... So even though the hardware refers to the sprites as 0-7 then AMOS refers
to the hardware sprites as 1-8 where sprite 8 is reserved for the mouse

Hi Everybody,

   I think (I may be wrong) but that isn't the case:

Sprite 8 is the first computed sprite. The real sprite 0 is usually tied up with the mouse pointer. To free it up, call 'Hide On' to free it up.

See ya.

Very interesting ! As Megadrive/Genesis' joypads are now hard to find,
Playstation ones are everywhere !
And most of time stronger and easier to handle.

Please can you tell us when this guy will achieve his wiring ?

Thanx.

Hi!

Ok eagers :) do you want play with sockets and servers... voila'! I've cr=
eated for you the AMOS BSDSocket.library survival kit :))

Included:

- a FD Extension with all the bsdsocket.library functions
- the .fd file of the bsdsocket.library =

- the Sockets doc
- a set of Amos procedures for a easy access to the functions

In the future i'll integrate all the functions of these procedures in the=

GUI Extension... now i'm working for the Pianeta Amiga fair, and i've not=

enough time to do it. =


First you need to install the extension... it's the number 25. If you alr=
eady use a FD extension, or you've another extension in the slot 25 i sug=
gest you to run the FD Extension builder and create your version. In the =
archive there is the .fd file and the ASCII version of the procedures, to=
o.


*You need the EasyLife and GUI extension too.*

Now you're ready to use the procedures. They are very easy, and offers al=
l
the necessary functions for open a connection,send and receive datas, and=

obviously the possbility to open the famous listening port :)

Since the "open listening port" is the request number one.... example:

SOCK_OPENSERVER[PORT] : PORTSOCK=3DParam

that's all!! :)

if the PORTSOCK param is ><-1 everything is fine, and your PORT is waitin=
g
(listening) for connections.

In order to know is someone wants open a connection...

SOCK_SERVERCHECK[PORTSOCK] : ADR=3DParam

If there is a connection waiting, the ADR param is ><-1 and it's the sock=
et
number associated to the remote system. Now you can chat with the other c=
omputer using the SOCK_SEND and SOCK_READ procedures... or fuck it with a=
 nice SOCK_CLOSE :)

In the above case, if i want send 100 bytes of datas to the connected com=
puter....

SOCK_SEND[ADR,Start(10),100]

simple eh? The name of the procedures are self-explaning, and there are
some connents inside....

When you've finished remember to close all the opened sockets!

-- =

No.

Subject: [amos-list] Exterior Floppy Drive
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Eric Molyneux" <eric_molyneux@lineone.net>

Hi Everone, Old Wrinkly here again.
                                                        A while back I asked
about a Hard Drive off a PC fitting the Amiga.
Now I want to know, will the external Floppy Drive I now use on my Amiga,
run on a PC.?.
May sound obvious to most, but I've got to ask. as it could save me a few
bob.
I want to couple my Amiga to the PC via a parnet lead and the PC I will use
has no Floppy Drive, I need this of course for the software.
I'd also like to enquire again, "Does anyone know where I can get Cinema 4D"
                                                            Thanks A Lot

Eric

I know a while back there was a link on Dave's Video Game Classics that had a link for a site that had schematics for hooking up N64, PSX, NES and other types of controllers to a serial/game port on a PC.  Maybe this can help you out.  If I can find it, I'll send the URL to the list.

   Nope, there's no where to plug it in on a PC. Seeing as the drive probably isn't a high density drive, there wouldn't be much point anyway.

   If your PC needs a new drive, just get some cheap replacement disk drive, you can pick them up for peanuts nowerdays.

See ya.

   Yep, but if you need L<>R scrolling screens, just use Screen Display to shrink the display size down to 320. That should do it :)

On the AmiNET in hard/hack CD32pins.lha may be what you want. I believe it's
like a 2 button joystick with all the other buttons on one pin.

Subject: [amos-list] Bringing Amos to Front
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>

I am looking for a way to bring AMOSPro to the front when it gets locked
behind the workbench screen and for some reason the Amiga+A key combination
does not work.  I tried to compile a small program that contained the line
'Amos To Front' but when executed my Amiga crashes.

Does anyone have something that could help me out.  Thanks.

Declan.

As far as I remember, you have to make sure you open a screen, and that
screen *has* to be screen 0, or else the compiler bombs.

Another reason for the compile bombing is when you compile a program with
the sample bank saved in it.  You have to erase bank 5 before compiling,
and load it off the disk instead.  Or you did when I was really into Amos
anyway.  Hope this helps.

Also you can't store icon banks that has an odd length. They must be loaded
from disk aswell.

From: roger buckley <rogerbu@callnetuk.com>

Hi,

I'm currently trying to convert an old Mike Singleton(Lords Of Midnight &
Doomdark's Revenge) designed game to the Amiga. The two previous version
were written for the Speccy & the BBC. I have a problem with the bobs.
Ineed a set of 5 bobs, no problem, but 8 colour sets of the bobs. Is there
an easier way than having forty bobs, of changing the colour. They are all
two colour and I don't fancy using paint and having 40 sets of co-ordinates
cluttering up the place. 

I may also have the old copyright problem again. The programme was published
as a type in prog in C&VG Yearbook(god only knows which year) and no
programmers' names are quoted in the article, only the designer.
 
Kind regards

Not directly.
The amiga floppy drives are modified pc floppy drives, so if you
were to get a soldering iron at the floppyd
