What's the GUI compiler? The GUI compiler is a patched version of the
original AmosPro Compiler and its libraries. With this patch the compiler
can create REAL MULTITASKING WB program! now you can run together 2
Amos program without problem! But..... if you use the GUI compiler
you must forgot the Amos graphics, you can use intuition ONLY!
(Gui extension, J Windows, Intuition, Os Dev Kit etc.) This patch
disable lots of the Amos features... bugs :), so use this patched
version only if you are creating a WB utility.

IMPORTANT
---------

This patch create a DUPLICATE of the  compiler (GUIcmp) without modify
the original! If you want use the GUI compiler, you MUST use the
GuiShell.Amos program supplied in this archive.

Try it!... and send me your opinions/ideas
