Hi everyone,

Heres my problem -

I have 2000 players each with 50 attributes I take one of those attributes
for each player and place it in an array as follows

ARRAY(2000,2) 

ARRAY(?,1) being the player code to determine which player it is
ARRAY(?,2) being the attribute I want to sort on

The usuall standard bubble sort works far too slow so I figure I need a 
QuickSort Algorithm, any ideas, psudocode, etc

Well, in AMOS Pro you could use LIB open and all that, right?  Also, there
is the command in TURBO (I think it is in v1.9 too) that will tell you the
CPU and FPU.

THere are plenty of bugs and I should have kept the list of the ones
posted but I keep forgetting.  So, if people post their examples of bugs I
will save them separately from the list.

Hmmm...  Well, I offer a few solutions.  First off, try implementing a
sorted structure, like a Btree or linked-list.  That way you should only
need to sort your data once, and then adding, removing, or modifying the
data requires only a few pointers to be swapped.  Failing that, here's a
Pascal quicksort routine.  (Converting this to AMOS is an exercise for the
reader. :)

Program Speedy(input, output)

Const   MAXSIZE = 256;

Type	DataType : Integer;
	List : array[1..MAXSIZE] of DataType;

Var	Foo : List;

Procedure Split(var X : List; Low, High : Integer; var Mid : integer);

var	left, right : Integer;
	tempitem : DataType;

begin

   left:=Low;
   right:=High;

   while left<right do begin

      while X[right]>X[Low] do
         right:=right-1;

      while (left<right) and (X[left]<=X[Low]) do
         left:=left+1;

      if left<right then begin

         tempitem:=X[left];
         X[left]:=X[right];
         X[right]:=tempitem;

      end;

   end;

   Mid:=right;
   tempitem:=X[Mid];
   X[Mid]:=X[Low];
   X[Low]:=tempitem

end;

procedure QuickSort(var X : List; Low, High : integer);

{ Calls Split() to sort between X[Low] and X[High].  Recursion in action! }

var	mid : Integer;

begin

   if Low<High then begin

      Split(X, Low, High, Mid);
      QuickSort(X, Low, Mid-1);
      QuickSort(X, Mid+1, High)
   end

end;


Begin

   {Fill your array here.}

   QuickSort(Foo, 1, MAXSIZE)

End.

Just thought I'd better explain the QuickSort, and I've got nothing better
to do.  Basically, what it does is split the list of numbers into two
sections, the section on the left containing numbers LESS than the
"midpoint", and the section on the right containing numbers MORE than
the "midpoint".  The Split() procedure in the example I gave selects a
suitable midpoint in a list.  You now have two smaller lists, which are
easier to sort.  Do it again, and you end up with even smaller
sub-lists...  It's kind of hard to explain, and is much easier to grasp by
drawing trees and things, but my ASCII art skills are limited. :)  Suffice
to say, it's pretty fast, although its worse-case sort-time is the same as
for a selection-sort.  However, it averages as the fastest general-case
sort algorithm.

I'm in a sorting mood, now, so I'll mention the MergeSort (useful for
sorting data that is too large to hold in memory).

Consider the following file, F.

75 55 15 20 80 30 35 10 70 40 50 25 45 60 65

You'll notice that witihn the file there are some sub-lists that are
already in order :

| 75 | 55 | 15 20 80 | 30 35 | 10 70 | 40 50 | 25 45 60 65 |

So, we start by splitting F into two files, F1 and F2, by writing
alternate sub-lists to each one.

F1 : | 75 | 15 20 80 | 10 70 | 25 45 60 65 |
F2 : | 55 | 30 35 | 40 50 |

Now you'll notice that F2 has an additional sub-list :

F2 : | 55 | 30 35 40 50 |

Now we use a simple merge to combine the two files back into a single
file, one sub-list at a time.  (I'll explain this bit in a minute. :)

F : | 55 75 | 15 20 30 35 40 50 80 | 10 70 | 25 45 60 65 |

Ok, now we do the whole thing again :

F1 : | 55 75 | 10 70 |
F2 : | 15 20 30 35 40 50 80 | 25 45 60 65 |

F : | 15 20 30 35 40 50 55 75 80 | 10 25 45 60 65 70 |

And again :

F1 : | 15 20 30 35 40 50 55 75 80 |
F2 : | 10 25 45 60 65 70 |

F : | 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 |

Et voila!

Here's a pseudo-code sub-list-merge :

Open F1 and F2 for input;
Open F for output;
Read the first element X from F1;
Read the first element Y from F2;
Repeat until the end of F1 or F2 is reached {
  If X<Y {
    Write X to F;
    Read the next element X from F1;
  } else {
    Write Y to F;
    Read the next element Y from F2;
  };
If the end of F1 was reached {
  Copy the remains of F2 into F;
  } else {
  Copy the remains of F1 into F;
  }.

Ok, everyone with me?

Good. :)

Well, that's enough of this.  If anyone wants to know more, just let me
know, and if there's anything else about data-processing that anyone wants
to know, just holler.  (Stuff like BTrees, linked-lists, hash-tables, etc.
All the stuff that every goes "Yeah, yeah.  Boring!"  when it's covered in
class...  Come on, own up.  You're all guilty of it at some point in your
lives.)

You can find a QuickSort routine in the Procedure Library. Check Aminet or Andy's 
WWW-site. Its name is ProcLib3.0.lha (or something very similar :-) .

repeats, the screen goes black for a few seconds.  I've simply copied

Also I'm trying to write a seperate program to display a different

But I'm not sure of the fastest way to copy  from memory to a screen. 
 It has to be fast so that the pictures keep up with the sound.  How

I seem to remember that it's something to do with the last frame - either
it has to be the same as the first or it has to be different (I can't
actually remember which :) but whichever way it is, it's the same way that
DPaint saves...

Well, assuming you have enough RAM for all 128 pictures, try something
like this:


ZERO$="0000"
For Q=1 to 128
  N$=Str$(Q)-" "
  N$=Left$(ZERO$,4-Len(N$))+N$
  Q$="Picture"+N$
  Load Iff Q$,0
  Get Block 1,0,0,320,200
Next

Screen Open 1,320,200,32,Lowres
Curs Off : Flash Off : Paper 0 : Cls
Get Palette 0
Screen Close 0
Double Buffer : Autoback 0

Do
  V={Put your volume reading thing in here.}
  Put Block V,0,0
  Screen Swap
  Wait Vbl
Loop



The program will read IFF pictures called "Picture0001" to "Picture0128",
store them in RAM, and then replay them according to the volume.  I'm
assuming that all the screens are the same size and have the same palette
- if not you'll also have to store the screen size and palette in a
seperate bank, but that's not too hard.  Just reserve a bank, and Doke the
screen sizes into it, and copy the palette data, and then use that to open
and close screens as necessary.

Ps. Version 1.4 should be available on AMinet within the next couple 
days. The reason I left the filename at ppACC.lha is due to all updates that
I had scheduled and it would be best to only have 1 file of the same 
program on Aminet than many.

	What you could do is load in the iff ILBM picture then just save
  out the screens bitplanes... This should do it:
  
  Bsave "output",Phybase(0) to 
      Phybase(0)+((Screen Width*Screen Height)/8)*(log(Screen Colour)/log(2))

  Phybase(0) --> Address of the Screens First Bitplane

  Screen Width*Screen Height/8 --> Size of 1 Bitplane

  log(Screen Colour)/log(2) --> The Number of Bitplanes in the Screen

	Amos Always Allocates it's Screen Bitplanes in one chunk so this
  will work... it is just dumping out the all of the screens bitplanes.


	Loading is even easier:

		Bload "output",Phybase(0)

   You could also load the output file into a bank then just:

 Copy Start(bank number),Start(bank number)+Length(bank number) To Phybase(0)

	You can't really show your iff much faster... Of course as you
 have probably noticed, by doing this you lose all information about
 the image, that is after you have saved out a image, when loading it in
 you will have to open the same screen with the same palette as the one
 that was used in saving the file.  You can always augment the above
 procedure to also dump some screen attributes so that you don't have
 this disadvantage but then it will take a little longer to load... it's
 up to you what you want to balance.

	I hope this helps..

Hi everyone,

Heres my problem -

I have 2000 players each with 50 attributes I take one of those attributes
for each player and place it in an array as follows

ARRAY(2000,2) 

ARRAY(?,1) being the player code to determine which player it is
ARRAY(?,2) being the attribute I want to sort on

The usuall standard bubble sort works far too slow so I figure I need a 
QuickSort Algorithm, any ideas, psudocode, etc

Hej!

I've got a programming problem that I would appreciate some help
with.

I'm thinking of writing a strategy game. In which you play against a
friend on a battlefield, with some different army units (like infantry,
cavalry and artillery). Which could be found on the battlefields of
the thirty-years war in Europe in the seventeenth century.

The battlefield should be generated randomly for each battle and
consist of about 100 by 100 squares. But in theese war the terrain
played a very important role, and the winner was often the leader
who used it to his advantage.

Because of this I'm planning to make the battlefield vary in hills
and valleys by letting the procedures who generates the landscape
"select" a sea-level for each square and colour it in different shades
of green (say 8 different levels whith a height difference of 6 feet
between each level).

Ok! I hope I made myself clear thus far, now to the problem:

I'd like the terrain to be hidden for the players eyes (like in
civilization) except the areas which are discovered by army units.
But a unit doesn't need to enter a square to reveal it, it just
have to be in eye-range of the unit.
This also means player one can't see the units of player two, unless
one or more of his own units can spot them.

When should a unit be able to spot the enemy?
I'd like them to be spotted if they are within x squares from a
unit and not in the "shadow" of a hill (that is a square which lies
at a higher sea-level than that of the searching unit).

There's also some other cases, for example when a unit stands in
a valley, he should be able to spot an enemy standing on an hill nearby,
but nothing beyond that.

I hope this makes some sence and that maybe some of you got an idea
or have made a procedure similiar to this once.

I'd be very grateful for some help.

			Zanks!

The array itself contains pointers to the strings which are garbage collected,
but the array of pointers isn't.

I suggest not doing this at all - AMOS isn't designed for pointers to 
variables.
If you must - don't do it for strings, and remember local variables go out of
scope at the end of a procedure and become invalid.

Never.

Global variables in a buffer it allocates - local variables on the stack.

Hello AMOS-users,

Does anyone know how to reach the LDOS-author, I found an email-addres
which ain't right.

- Have you used or do you use Ldos ?
- Do you know about problems with it ?
- Is there an AMOSPro version around ?
- Is there anyone who uses Intuition-library's from amos through call rather
than through extensions ?
- Have you had any succes with the Req.library via 'Open Library' followed by
a Call-statement (I know it's in the LDos-extension but by calling it myself
I could use the Multi-Select function)

I hope you can help me with any of the listed problems.

Thanks in advance.
Martijn (new subscriber to AMOS-list).

I used it a long time ago, but i was no satisfied by it

Don't try to use it under AMOS Pro... System crashes!

No. The only version is for AMOS the Creator...

LAnsi always crashes. LRexx Make Host does not work.

Yes. Register it and you will get AmosPro versions of both LDos and LSerial.

According to a review in some UK mag it's a collection of procedures. So 
it's probably easier to use the intuition extension.

If this is not possible how do I copy just my serial prefs from my WorkBench 2

ISTR somebody discussing info on text commands a little while back.

I'm tinkering with an HTML editor in Amos, but I'm having a few
problems with graphical text.

Here's a coupla questions;

 Is it possible to determine the height of disc fonts?

 Is there a way to avoid doing a "get fonts" every time I test my  proggy?

 And just to top it all of, (hehehe) is it possible to dynamically resize
  a memory bank (OOoooo. That should attract some attention)

All help greatly appreciated,

G.

Is version 1.3 of the Intuition extension ready yet?  And will the patch

Def Fn FH(N)=Val(Right$(Font$(N),3))

To find the height of a font, just pass the font number to the function.

Don't think so.

Generally, you should supply a height to load a font so you should already
know what the height is. If not, go into FontED or something and check.

>  Is there a way to avoid doing a "get fonts" every time I test my  proggy?
What I do is make temporary font directories in RAM: (only using the fonts
you need, three or whatever) and assign FONTS: to RAM:... Takes a lot 
less time and will work until you reboot the system or reassign FONTS: to 
dh0:fonts/ or whatever.

Um, heh heh. I doubt it. What kind of bank, and why would you want to 
resize it? 

At any rate, I'd like to beta test your program if possible. I can't use 
any of the stuff out there 'cause I'm still WB1.3 :(

  Yup, the same way you do it for fonts in memory - you Set Font to that
font and do a Font Height.

> Is there a way to avoid doing a "get fonts" every time I test my  proggy?

  Use the OPENFONT procedure from the Procedure Library.  You give it a
font name and size, and it returns a font number to use with Set Font.  Or
something like that.

  You can shrink it (in AMOS Pro anyway), but you can't "grow" a bank.

That doesn't work, by the way. Even if you know the number of the font, 
you still have to go and Get Fonts. If you don't, there will be an error 
saying you need to do it. :(  See my other message explaining how I do it.

Hi, everybody !

I'm a new user. My name is Pr Bystedt and I'm from Sweden. Well enough about 
me, lets get down to business. 

In my program I need to generate tones in an exact frequency (given in Hertz), 
but AMOS uses a rather umprecise method of specifying tone-frequency. You give 
a value ranging from 1-96 that is suppose to corresponde to the keys of a 
piano. Does anyone know the connection between these values and their 
Hertz-values ???

I've tried to go around the problem by generating a sinus-table in a memory 
bank and play it through the "Sam Raw"-command, but it hasn't worked since the 
tone-frequency various not only with the given Hertz-value but also by with 
period and length of the sinus-table.

I would be very grateful if somebody could help me find a simple solution to 
this problem ! E-Mail me: pbystedt@tc.multi.se

That IT !

I'm writing an editor/librarian for the Yamaha TG-500....I need to know 2 things

1. How do I set the baud rate from within AMOS....or how do I get the serial pre
   prefs on my AMOS disc and get the system to recognise  them

2  . Can I share the serial port so I can run my program at the same time as
	playing a song in Octamed?

Thanks

OK..

AMOS List is not dead!
Well, i think that a friend of mine enjoys to delete my mails!

However, my question is (and i hope someone can help me...):

  how can i implement a reflex effect?

  What i say is:  is possible to split a screen in two parts?(Yes...i know).
  The part above should be the main screen and the part under should be
  the reflex ...

  And if it is possible, i would like to know a method that allows me
  to reflect objects like bob,sprites too...

  I saw a similar effect in a shareware game created with AMOS.
  It is called Total Excess and it is present on Aminet.

  Thanks at all...

I wrote a program to convert raw sample into IFF and vice versa. I wanted to
be able to change the frequency of the sample so that this value would be saved
with in the IFF header.

I'm not sure if this is what you're after, but here's a list of frequencies
corresponding to their notes.
Of course, it depends on the frequency of the original sample ;)

(I got all the frequencies from AudioMaster:)

A "b" following the note represents flat. Likewise, "#" represents a sharp.

            A     Bb    B     C     C#    D     Eb    E     F     F#    G     G#

It seems the list is suffering from some kind of heart failure.  Today I got
a bunch of messages that were about 3 days old, but several messages I sent
have yet to show up, and the whole thing is generally looking a bit sorry

Hi Andy.

First off, thanks to you for getting the extension to me (through Mike).

Does the Iwait Event command take the place of:

do
a$=inkey$
multi wait
if a$="" then loop

And, what I would like to see in the next version:

STDIN/STDOUT so I can write online games.  So far, I can't figure out how to
get the bbs prg to accept input/output from amos.  I figure it can't be that
hard to do, since amigabasic will interface with bbs prgs with no problem.

I guess it would be an Iprint and Iinput set of commands.  If there is already
a way to do this, could you point me at the commands?  (I wish my amigaguide
would print the entire doc out in readable format!)

Well met and godspeed,
                      Giark

	yes... you can get position of the screen via screen base.. although

Yes it is, and it's very simple with copper. Let's assume your screen
is 320 pixels wide, that is 320/8=40 bytes.
Normally we have a plane modulo 0, that means bitplane dma jumps over 0 bytes
after one row of plane, that is one row of screen data. Now by using 
negative modulo of -80 (twice the width in bytes), bitplane
dma (the one handling screen updating) will jump two rows backwards.
So the picture will be drawn mirrored around x-axis.

example: (this comes straight from my head, so sorry if there
 are some mistakes)

a=(screen width/8)*screen height : rem this is the size of a bitplane
cop movel bpl1pth,phybase(0)+a :rem bpl1pth=$e0 + custom ($dff000)
cop movel bpl2pth,phybase(1)+a : rem bpl2pth=$e4 + custom ($dff000)
...
etc. set up your palette and screen size here etc.
cop move col0,$000 : rem color 0 (col0=$180)
cop move col1,$222 : rem col1 (=$182)

...
bpl1mod=$108 
bpl2mod=$10a
cop move bpl1mod,-80 : rem for even planes 
cop move bpl2mod,-80 : rem and odd planes

hmm, I think there's an example about using copper with amos
in amos pro help files... Check them out and mail me if you need 
more information.

The above method works with bobs too (they will be reflected automaticly)
but sprites won't work, because they're not drawn in to the bitplanes.

HI!

This simple procedure relocates a medmodule so that it can be saved with
a amos program. At the beginning of your program before you play the 
module, you have to remember to call RELOC_MED procedure though.

Procedure RELOC_MED[BNK]
   ' BNK - bank #
   '
   ' Open medplayer.library, version 2 or newer
   Lib Open 1,"medplayer.library",2
   ' the address of the med module to a0
   Areg(0)=Start(BNK)
   ' call RelocModule from medplayer.library 
   L=Lib Call(1,-102)
   ' close library
   Lib Close 1
End Proc

Amos To Back

Iwindow Open Wb 1,50,50,200,100,"Workbench has been invaded!",63

Iclw

Iwrite "Boo!"

Do
EVENT=Iwindow Status(1)
Iwrite Str$(EVENT)
Loop

Iwindow Close Wb 1

Amos To Front

As soon as it reaches the EVENT=Iwindow Status(1) line, my system gurus.  If I
don't put the (1) on the end, it returns 0 all the time, but does not guru.

I was trying to find the number value for the Iwindow Status for closing
windows but, like I said, it gurus (well, software failure - suspend or reboot)
as soon as I call the Iwindow Status(1).

Well met and godspeed,

Giday all you AMOS fans, 
I was wondering...
Does anybody know how I could go about writing a game in AMOS along a 
normal phone line between two modems. I have the Lserial extension V2.5, 
but I don't know how to get the two programs communicating.
Would the modems have to be the same speed?

Thanks in advance,

You have to do the "get fonts" to be able to "set font"(AFAIK). It's kind of 
slow if you have a lot of fonts in your fonts directory.

I have a directory called font which I put the fonts my program uses 
and in the code I simply reassigns the fonts: directory like this...

Exec "Assign Fonts: IQ0:font"
Get Fonts

Exec "Assign Fonts: IQ0:fonts"

(IQ0:, HD0:, sys: or whatever your drive is called)

There you've got a lot less time to wait for the dull get fonts 
command. If you use a floppy just delete/move the fonts you don't use.

Best regards Dan

As I am not a musician I am not sure about the naming conventions. I do seem to 
remember that it was the so-called central A that has a frequency of 440 Hz. This is 
the tone you get when you strike the upper snare (is it called snare?) of a normal 
accoustic guitar. 
You can then calculate the other frequencies. Keep in mind though that the human 
ear uses a logarithmic scale. So increasing the octave with one (going up 12 
semitones) is doubling the frequency. So suppose pianokey X has a frequency 
of 440 Hz, then pianokey X+y (y in semitones, so both black and white keys) has 
frequencie X*2^(y/12). Twelve is the number of semitones, so X*2^(12/12)=X*2=one 
octave higher, i.e. a doubled frequencie.

code to my unfinished Risk clone, but nothing like risk, why? 200 
territorys, random map generated, its yours for the asking... Lets just 
say I dont have the time to finish what I started because I I'm stuck on 
certain routines, heck maybe we end up with 5 or more versions of it, but 
all being fun, I didnt document my code & its basically a simple routine 
that came with Amos, but I improved it. Who knows u may learn something 
off it... I had alot of feedback from interested parties, so send me a 
reply & its yours.

For doing assignments why don't you give my procedure a try:

--------- CUT HERE ----------

Procedure _ASSIGN[NAME$,PATH$]
Dreg(1)=Varptr(NAME$)
Dreg(2)=Varptr(PATH$)
A=Doscall(-624)
End proc

----------- END -------------

Forgot to tell you the correct usage. To call this procedure do the 
following:

_ASSIGN["Fonts","DF0:Fonts/"]
              ^
Note:         L DO NOT PUT A ":" !! OR IT WILL NOT WORK.

Best of all 'bout using this procedure is that you don't have to have the 
ASSIGN (CLI command) in your C: directory as it uses the dos.library.

Well, but the number of bytes per rows does not depend on the depth of 
the screen as the Amiga uses planar bitmap instead of chunky one?
Just a question... 

Very interesting the coomands for the copper...
Where I can find a complete documentation about the wanderful copper?

Right, when I first started amos, Double buffering worked fine with no

in an IFF, it onl goes to the Physical screen, and so do my sprites etc.

Can someone do a simple explanation of getting a double buffered IFF
screen up, with some moving sprites, eg

Load Screen
Do
  Move Sprites
Loop

With just hints on what AUtoback, where to wait etc.. Its really
annoying me i could do it b4 and have forgotton how to do it now!

And now, to be topical, (for those in the UK)

PS. I've got some code that will bring a window to the front of the screen when
    it's accessed, or called from a menu when it's already open....it's quite

Try putting a 'screen swap' at the end of the loop. This will swap the 
physical and the logical screen so all that has been drawn on the logical 
one will be shown.

I know this isn't really relevant to this list, but seeing the above 
suddenly reminded me of something :-)
 I used to have a program that gave a "shadow" effect to Workbench 
windows; the depth and intensity of the shadows could be varied. I don't 
know if this IS the "DropShadow" program that is mentioned above, but it 
sounds similar.
 However, the program I have was written for WB1.3, and seems to break 
under WB2.04 or 3.x :-(  Does anyone know if there's a program available 
for WB 3.x that will give a shadow effect to windows? It looked really 
neat, and I'd like to see it on my WB again. Can anyone (briefly, this IS 
an AMOS list after all :-) ) describe how the "shadow" effect is 
accomplished?

  David Hollway.

Hola Amigites!  I'm nearly finished with my first real production. The 
program is called "WG." Of course, it's in AMOSPro. WG stands for 
War-Game. Essentially it allows you to create an infinite variety of war 
games. If anyone is interested in beta-testing this before I upload it
to aminet, please e-mail me. (doctorx@rain.org)

Thx..

Silly question, but why don't you use the assign amos command,
you know, assign "fonts:" to "sys:fonts"... ?

The number of bytes per row depends only on the screen width as far as I

Either using your own copperlist by 'inverting' the bitplane modulo
registers, or by abusing a rainbow. I know this sounds strange, but
it works in a limited way (only on 2 colours or on dual playfield
displays). To do this, you must change the colour the rainbow affects
normally by doking a negative value into it (I think it is
($10A-$180)/2). In this way you may also create rainbow effects which
let you change the colours 16-31 as well! Hopefully, I will provide
you with a working example in the near future. Please be patient :-)

(Or you could just buy the AMCAF-Extension, in which this command is
already implemented ;-) )

Hello all,

i have some problems with the AMOS Track Play commands. Thers no
possibility to change the volume and no way to put more than one song
in one MOD file (to share the samples).

Are there any EXTENSIONS to solve the probs (perhaps EME) and where
are they ?

I have searched on the AMINET CD 1, 3, 4 and today on number 5, but
i havent found any prog, example, extension, eme or something else.

 thankx for any help


   bye

Yes there is. I have coded a command for that (and of course, it is
included in the AMCAF-Extension ;-) ). For your sake, I have
extracted the routine into a asm-procedure which can be called
directly from AMOS.

I hope, I can post binary files here, otherwise I must first find
some UUencoding program.

So if the binary file has not reached you, send me a mail and I will
resend it as uuencoded.

You may try MusiCRAFT, the another extension of the CRAFT package. It has
new module playing system and there's patch available (directly from me,
'cos I'm one of the authors) to get a new command St Volume.
  The tracker system doesn't support multiple songs in one module.

Reply-To: achurch@goober.mbhs.edu
X-Mailer: MMail v4.20
Status: RO
X-Status: 

  Version 1.3 of the Intuition Extension is now available.  The primary
new feature is event waiting - you can now wait in a system-friendly way
for the user to do something, rather than having to check every possible
form of input in a loop that eats processor time.  Of course, there are
also numerous bug fixes; in particular, the patch for the AMOS Creator
version of the Intuition Extension v1.2b is no longer needed (and in fact
will cause crashes if it is used).

  Those who have registered will be receiving their updates shortly.  If
you are interested in getting the demo archive, mail me.

Hi,

   I wonder if anyone can help me with a problem I have
with running AMOS 3D Object Modeller. The problem is when
the program finishes loading I am presented with a random

logo), which incidently flashes badly. If i go on and enter
the editor it is impossible to work out where the cursor is !
It works fine on my old A500 BUT ... (see below for spec of 
the machine Im using).


P.S.  I use AMOS Pro

Ok Chris, thanks.

Could you mail details of your AMCAF-extention to the list please?
What new commands does it offer?
I think everyone would be interested.

BTW, is there a demo version of the extention available?

Cheers,

I don't know whether this has been mentioned before, but a Wait Vbl

It's commercial, and it's distributed by Black Legend/Kompart.

You can select which channels ar used when playing MODs and you can also
play samples in any channel even if a MOD is currently played on that
channel. Just stop the channel and play the sample and then restart the
channel. I don't remember if the MusiCRAFT allows you to play samples
when playing MODs.

As the product is commercial, I don't have any files that I can legally
distribute (freely)... But I hope that this message will help.

It's commercial, and it's distributed by Black Legend/Kompart.

You can select which channels ar used when playing MODs and you can also
play samples in any channel even if a MOD is currently played on that
channel. Just stop the channel and play the sample and then restart the
channel. I don't remember if the MusiCRAFT allows you to play samples
when playing MODs.

As the product is commercial, I don't have any files that I can legally
distribute (freely)... But I hope that this message will help.

I have just read an AMOS FAQ, recently taken off of the aminet which lists
all the extension slots currently being used, noticeably 1 slot
is apparently being used for 3d.lib V1.02AP (AMOS Pro) and 3d.lib V1.00
(CREATOR), I have currently got v1.00 of 3d.lib and have never
received/heard of an update.

This could be completely irrelevant with regard to the running of OM,
is 3d.lib used by OM ?

Where do we get updates from ?

Anybody out there fancy writing a program/conversion script for an
object designed in a ray tracer (Imagine ?) to AMOS 3d (ok, a bit
ambitious I admit) ?

This is exactly how I do double buffering, but I seem to have a
problem displaying Dialog Boxes and Menus, Why ? Is it possible
to stop Double Buffering temporarily (Autoback seems to have no
effect) ?

Er, what? It works fine on my bog standard A1200, no disabling caches or
anything. I've got the version of Amiga Computings Coverdisk from yonks
back. Perhaps its an A4000 problem.

It`s not. The coverdisk version works fine on my A4000/030, whereas
my original version does not. Obviously Voodoo removed some nasty
AGA unfriendly code in later versions of OM.

I'm wonering if any bug fixes for AMOS Professional have come out yet.

Particualrly these bugs:

  Dual Playfield doesn't properly offset.  The screen (snaps to 16-pixel
  boundaries - not a hardware problem since I've done my own copper lists
  that can get pixel offsets on BOTH playfields)

  Med commands have a bug that causes infinite looping of Sam Play samples
  in KS2.0 and cause an all-out guru when Sam Play is used on KS1.3

Finally, are there any memory-management extensions available, 
particularly ones that deal with linked lists, structures and pointers?

Thanks.

Are there any AMOS Professional Interface extensions that provide a 
much-needed Text Box facility?  Edit bxoes just won't do for entering 
things like a multi-paragraph room description or caption for a text 
adventure or RPG.

Lastly, are there any really smooth incremental block-grpahics scrolling 
algorithms or extensions for AMOS Pro?  One that does 8 or more colours 
smoothly on a a dual-playfield display would be great, but one that 
operates smoothly on a display with 16x16 blocks anywhere from 4-6 
bitplanes would be great.  Thanks.  (Why didn't the Amiga's designers 
just keep a blocked grpahics mode avaialable - it would have made it a 
lot easier to do these kinds of displays!  Sheesh, text screens would 
have been a cinch with such a mode!)

Wanna talk about AMOS? Telnet to ANARCHY, my personal mud. It's
at 128.227.113.88 6969. Once you make an account and get to the
Echo City square, go south then east. You find yourself in the
AMOS building. Hopefully enough people will telnet at the same
time to keep up convo. I'll try to be there most of the time.
Even if you just want to socialize, come on by!

Re: Object Modeller

Unless you are one of the lucky few to get the 2.0 upgrade, OM only works under
1.3OS.  Amos 3D will work fine with 2.0+ OS, but the OM won't .  If you are
able to switch down to 1.3OS, do that and it will work fine.  If not, try to
find the 2.0OS version ove modeller.

GE> BTW, is there a demo version of the extention available?

There is. The main extension is 40 KB in size and there is one disk
full of example programs in the full package. Some time ago I have
posted an advertisment intro in AMINET/dev/amos.

If nobody has complaints about the size of a demo version, then I
will post one here with aprox 50 KB. ;-)

	I need a procedure to unpack PowerPacked datafiles. These are data banks and to use'em I need to unpack'em! My problem is that I need to do that (too long to explain why... note I own AmosPro!) using Amos 1.31 and without extensions! I can't use a lot of memory too.

	If u know the format of packed files, just write it down, Ill write the procedure I need.

[Actual info deleted]

A few questions:

	Q: Does this thing work on OCS Amigas with KS1.3 running
	   AmosPro?

	Q: If so, how much is it and where can I get it?

PS: What are the PTile commands all about?

Hi again ! This is Pr Bystedt ( pbystedt@tc.multi.se )

First of all thanks to:         Gareth Edwards
                                Jesse McClusky
                                Branko Collin

for trying to help me with my problem with generating tones. Your suggestions 
gave me some help but didn't quite solve the problem. I'll try to make the 
problem a bit clearer.

If I for example need to generate a tone in exactly 3000 Hz, how would i do 
?????? 
I cant use the Play-command cause it uses the numbers 1 to 96. I've tried to 
generate a sinus-table i a memory-bank, and then play it with the Sam 
Raw-command. It's used like this: Sam Raw voice, adress,length,frequency. 
Frequency is given in Hertz, but the actual frequecy depends both on the value 
I give and on the period of the Sinus-table. For exemple in: 
Y=Sin(k*X)*128+128, the actual frequency will be higher the higher value k has.

I would be very grateful for any help !

You'll have to go to the hardware to get what you want.

Note: The registers below all take words (ie: use Doke to set them).
      You'll also note I've specified the registers in quadruples,
      the different addresses, $dff0ax through to $dff0dx are for
      each audio channel.  channel 0 is $dff0ax, channel 1 os $dff0bx,
      etc.

-Start by setting a volume in $dff0a8,b8,c8,d8
-then create a waveform and set
$dff0a4,b4,c4,d4 to the length of it
-and $dff0a0,b0,c0,d0 to the address of it (in chip RAM)
-then, the hard part:
  samrate=(FREQ*SAMPLESPERCYCLE)
   period=INT(1/(samrate*2.79365*10^-7))
-then store this period into $dff0a6,b6,c6,d6
-lastly, set the appopraite bit it DMACON ($dff096):
  ch0 (dff0ax) set bit 0
  ch1 (dff0bx) set bit 1
  ch2 (dff0cx) set bit 2
  ch3 (dff0dx) set bit 3
  don't forget to set bit 15 to tell DMACON to turn on the previous
  bit(s), your values would be something like Doke $dff096,$800x  (where x 
is the bit combo above)

  Since 3000 Hz means 3000 cycles per second, you want the waveform to
repeat 3000 times per second.  So for your formula above, the frequency for
Sam Raw would be 3000*(360/k), assuming you're using degree measurement.
Since frequencies can't be higher than 28867 Hz, you'd need a relatively
high value of k.  45 ought to do it - then the Sam Raw frequency would be
3000*(360/45) = 24000.

BTW: For many reasons, I prefer Turbo Imploder to PowerPacker, which
only needs once the memory to load /and/ decrunch and is incredibly
fast! :-)

Try out this one: It only needs the music (Sload!) and the compiler
extension. It's a universal routine for AMOS PP banks, normal PP
banks, normal AMOS banks and binary data. If you want to load a bank
into chip ram, use negative bank numbers.

Once upon a time I used this procedure to pack ordinary pp20 files
rather then the amos pp banks. It uses bank 16 as temporary bank, so
do not store anything there ;-)

ni> 	If u know the format of packed files, just write it down, Ill write the procedure I need.

The first longword is 'PP20' or 'PX20' (?) for encoded files, then
follows the packed data. The stupid thing about PowerPacker is that
it saves the length of the original data in the last four bytes or
better to say, the upper three bytes of the last longword. Very odd
indeed (and a real mess if you want to rip these files :-{ ).

I am developing a graphic interface builder. This will allow me to create 
a graphical interface for POV-Gui quite easily and without the use of the 
resource interface which is quite limiting.
I have done procedures for buttons and for my own list slider which work 
very well... The problem is that I have to define the area of buttons and 
so... the problem is tha the mouse on the interlaced screen moves 2 pixel 
every vertical movement... that means i cannot obtain odd vertical 
coordinates. This also is present in the Resource Bank Maker and in my 
further upgrades.
So... how can I obtain odd numbers?
I wont move the mouse twice...

  This is the result of the fact that OCS/ECS sprites can only be
positioned in terms of low-resolution, non-interlaced pixels.

  In AMOS, you can't.  Unless, of course, you use the Intuition
Extension... :)

naimoli@cli.di.unipi.it wrote on 23.03.1995 some text under the
subject Unpacking_datafiles. I can't leave this uncommentated ;-)

ni> 	I need a procedure to unpack PowerPacked datafiles. These are data banks and to use'em I need to unpack'em! My problem is that I need to do that (too long to explain why... note I own AmosPro!) using Amos 1.31 and without extensions! I can't use a lot of memory too.

Hmmm... Some time ago I wrote some workarounds for PowerPacker saving
using Ppload and Ppsave of the compiler extension. I don't know, if
these are already in the amos creator compiler but they are in the
professional compiler. Another problem is that the bank needs the
double space to load than normally.

BTW: For many reasons, I prefer Turbo Imploder to PowerPacker, which
only needs once the memory to load /and/ decrunch and is incredibly
fast! :-)

Try out this one: It only needs the music (Sload!) and the compiler
extension. It's a universal routine for AMOS PP banks, normal PP
banks, normal AMOS banks and binary data. If you want to load a bank
into chip ram, use negative bank numbers.

Procedure PACLOAD[F$,BK]
  BANK=Abs(BK) : If BK<0 Then CP=2 Else CP=0
  If F$="" Then Print "Error: No filename!" : Stop 
  If Exist(F$)=0 Then Print "Error: File not found" : Stop 
  Open In 1,F$
  A$=Input$(1,4) : B$=Input$(1,4)
  LF=Lof(1)
  If A$="PP20"
    Pof(1)=LF-4
    B$=Chr$(0)+Input$(1,3)
    LE=Leek(Varptr(B$))
    Erase BANK : Reserve As Work BANK,LF+16
    ST=Start(BANK)
    Poke$ ST,"PPbk"
    Doke ST+4,BANK
    Doke ST+6,CP
    Loke ST+8,LE+8
    Loke ST+12,LF-8
    Pof(1)=0
    Sload 1 To ST+16,LF
    Close 1
    Bsave "RAM:PACSAVE.xxx",ST To ST+LF+16
    Erase BANK
    Ppload "RAM:PACSAVE.xxx",BANK
    Kill "RAM:PACSAVE.xxx"
    ST=Start(BANK)
    Copy ST-8,ST+LE-8 To ST
    Poke$ ST-8,"Work    "
    Pop Proc
  End If 
  If A$="PPbk"
    Close 1
    Erase BANK : Ppload F$,BANK
    Pop Proc
  End If 
  If A$="AmBk" or A$="AmSp" or A$="AmIc" or A$="AmBs"
    Close 1
    Load F$,BK
    Pop Proc
  End If 
  If CP=0
    Reserve As Work BANK,LF
  Else 
    Reserve As Chip Work BANK,LF
  End If 
  Pof(1)=0
  Sload 1 To Start(BANK),LF
  Close 1
End Proc

Once upon a time I used this procedure to pack ordinary pp20 files
rather then the amos pp banks. It uses bank 16 as temporary bank, so
do not store anything there ;-)

Procedure PACSAVE[F$,BK,EF]
  LE=Length(BK)
  Reserve As Work 16,LE-8
  ST=Start(16)
  Copy Start(BK),Start(BK)+LE To ST-8
  Ppsave "RAM:PACSAVE.xxx",16,EF
  Erase 16
  Open In 1,"RAM:PACSAVE.xxx"
    LE=Lof(1)
    Reserve As Work 16,LE-16
    ST=Start(16)
    Pof(1)=16
    Sload 1 To ST,LE-16
  Close 1
  Kill "RAM:PACSAVE.xxx"
  Bsave F$,ST To ST+LE-16
  Erase 16
End Proc

ni> 	If u know the format of packed files, just write it down, Ill write the procedure I need.

The first longword is 'PP20' or 'PX20' (?) for encoded files, then
follows the packed data. The stupid thing about PowerPacker is that
it saves the length of the original data in the last four bytes or
better to say, the upper three bytes of the last longword. Very odd
indeed (and a real mess if you want to rip these files :-{ ).

Actually, there is a way to read the mouse in its full resolution as it 
works in Workbench.  In GRAB4, I hacked at the hardware to read the 
mouse, and it returns more accurate values than what AMOS gets.

I am sure there is a better, less system-abusive way to read the mouse, 
but I've never tried.

My friend and I are working on a game with up to 16 colour 640x400 
(interlaced) screens. The problem is that the game works 100% on all ADOS 
Amigas from 1.3 to 2.1, but not with ADOS 3.1.

On ADOS 3.1, the operation of the game runs ok, but the hires displays 
look messed up. When displayed through a 1084S monitor, every second line 
throughout the display is missing. If I switch on the flickerless display 
of my 1950 multiscan monitor and look at the same displays, I can see the 
missing lines, but they are badly out of sync and misaligned. The AMOS 
editor will behave the same way, if I turn on the interlace mode.

My question is if a fix has been made to get AMOSPro to work without the 
interlace problem, or if there is an alternative, other than using 
non-interlaced graphics.

Thanks for any help!

What is GRAB4?
How difficult is to make the hack?
I have seen than also that the problems is also for horizontal coordinates.
So... what a strange thing...
I have tried to make a custom grafic interface to by-pass the Amos 
Resource limits with coordinates and I have trouble with interlaced screen!!

Why there is no way to lace the mouse? Another bug?

I have also noticed this problem on my A4000.  It is likely a fault of 
AMOS, because the problem doesn't always happen (I think whether you run 
setpatch or something determines it).  Anyone have an idea?

GRAB4 is a very powerful bob/sprite grabber I wrote, but it's very 
confusing to use for some, and I'm too lazy to write documentation.

Ghastly difficult.

Your best bet is to use a bob or pasted image and hide the true mouse 
pointer.

Here are three procedure that can handle the mouse in hires.

To initialize the mouse, and set its working limits:

Procedure _MINIT
 Limit Mouse 128,50 To 128+319,50+199
 XR=Peek($DFF00B) : YR=Peek($DFF00A)
 _MX=320 : _MY=200
 _MLIMIT[0,0,639,399]
End Proc

Procedure _MLIMIT[X1,Y1,X2,Y2]
 _MTX=X1 : _MTY=Y1
 _MBX=X2 : _MBY=Y2
End Proc

And a good procedure for reading the mouse and displaying it... the 
sprite line divides the _MX and _MY positions in half to display the 
sprite.  Use a bob without the /2's instead if you wish.

It begins with a check to make sure AMOS is to the front before reading 
the mouse.

Procedure _MCHECK
 If Not Amos Here
  Repeat
   Wait 30
  Until Amos Here
 End If
 WX=Peek($DFF00B)-XR
 If WX<-128 Then Add WX,256
 If WX>127 Then Add WX,-256
 WY=Peek($DFF00A)-YR
 If WY<-128 Then Add WY,256
 If WY>127 Then Add WY,-256
 XR=Peek($DFF00B) : YR=Peek($DFF00A)
 DX=WX
 DY=WY
 _MX=Max(_MTX,Min(_MX+DX,_MBX))
 _MY=Max(_MTY,Min(_MY+DY,_MBY))
 Sprite 0,128+_MX/2,50+_MY/2,1
 Wait Vbl <<< (try without first...)
End Proc

A lot of people would have me killed for this code.  Understandable.

Anyway you will need to set Globals for every variable in the code except 
maybe the DX/DY.  Call _MINIT first, then _MCHECK every Vbl when you need 
to read the mouse.  Call _MLIMIT instead of using Limit Mouse.  This will 
keep the _MX and _MY values it returns to you withing X1,Y1 and X2,Y2.

What type of game is it?? I am just starting to get to know my AMOS PRO and I
want to design video games too. If any one is willing to e-mail me their source
code of any video games they programmed in AMOS PRO. I am really an artist and
have tons of characters for different types of video games that I am designing
(I have characters for street fighter type game, Super Metroid type, Mario type
game, Space shooter and RPG) its just programming I am not a pro (I barely got
a C grade in my C programming class) I am an art major and I love drawing. I
have been drawing all my life and my goal is to be a grafx artist for a video
game company. If Any one has source codes for side scrolling space shooters,
Turrican/Super Metroid type, Mario/Sonic type, Street Fighter 2 type video
games I would really appreciate them if you don't mind sending them to me.
Thanks in advance to anyone.  Sorry I didn't answer you letter, I am still new
to AMOS PRO.
Best Regards,

Tetsuo

Subject: bob probs
Status: O
X-Status: 

I'm currently writing a game where I need to scroll the screen now and
then.
When the bob reaches the edge of the screen, I execute the following
procedure.

Procedure _Scroll_right
y=100
Def Scroll 1,0,0 To 640,320,10,0
for i=0to 31
     Scroll 1
     Bob1,I*10+10,y,1
     Cls 0,0,0 To I*10+10,320 :Rem this clears out the residue from the
scroll
     wait Vbl
Next
End Proc

This does take some time to move, but it is Ok as it's used so the player
can see the next screen.

The problem is that it leaves bits of the Bob behind. I can't seem to
figure out a way around this. Can any one help fix this code?
Is there a better way of moving the screen and bob?
Any tips that work will get credit in the fisished game!

This'll work, but make sure your screen is double buffered, and you've set
Autoback to 0.  Just call _SCREEN_SCROLL, passing the distance to move
across and up/down.  Eg _SCREEN_SCROLL[1,-1] moves the screen up a line 
and right a column.  I can't quite figure out what  you're trying to do
with the Bob, so you may have to add something to it, but this is a
starting point.


Procedure _SCREEN_SCROLL[DX,DY]

   Bob Clear
   Screen Copy Physic,0,0,Screen Width,Screen Height to Logic,DX,DY
   Ink 0
   If DX>0
      Bar 0,0 to DX,Screen Height-1
   Else
      Bar Screen Width-DX,0 to Screen Width-1,Screen Height-1
   End If
   If DY>0
      Bar 0,0 to Screen Width-1,DY
   Else
      Bar 0,Screen Height-DY to Screen Width,Screen Height-1
   End If
   Bob Draw
   Screen Copy Logic to Physic
   Screen Swap

The game is called WARSTAR and will probably be released in about 2-3

makes this possible??

does anybody know how i can program in assembler directly with amos??
(so not the btst commands in amos but the whole M68000 command set??)
(maybe an extension??)

All hints and tips are welcome!!

The frequency you have to use in the Sam Raw command is the so-called sample 
frequency. This means the amos programme will play exactly that number of 
samples per second. So if you have recorded a sample at a frequency of 10000 
and you play it at the same rate, the sound will be the same. However, if you play it 
at halve the rate it will sound lower (one octave, to be precisely, read my previous 
post as to how it works).
Now, what you could do is use the formula I posted before to vary the sample 
frequency, but this means that the time a sample plays will also vary (in the above 
example it will take two times as long to get through the same amount of samples).
Otherwise you need to keep in mind what sample frequency (or sample rate as it is 
sometimes called) you are going to use. The simple formula for this is:

P=Fs/F

i.e. period (P) = sample frequency (Fs) / frequency (F)

where F is the frequency of the tone you wanted to have played.

To use your example: Suppose the sample frequency is 10000 Hz (it allways has 
to be twice the highest frequency, so your maximum is 5000 Hz here), and you 
want to generate a 3000 Hz tone. The period of one sine wave would then have to 
be:10000/3000 is 3.33333.

In pseudocode:

reserve bank 5 with 3000 bytes
p#=3.33333
pi2#=2*3.1415 etc. 'This is the normal period
p#=pi2#/p#
for x=0 to 2999
  Y=sin(x*p#)*128+128
next x
sam raw 1,start(5),length(5),10000

BACK UP YOUR ORIGINAL DISKS NOW !!!

I have just failed to get a replacement System Disk for AMOS Pro

   "Because Europress released AMOSPro on a coverdisk they have
stopped distributing the title, I suggest you contact them to send

I have seen this disk and was somewhat disappointed to find that
large chunks of it was misisng for example the On-Line Help !

I hope the AMOS Pro Manual is still available ...

Hi.

It's possible, I have an Amal-scrolltext routine at home.... 
(hope i'll find it thow! :-))
I'll bring it with me next time.... :-)

Another thing: 
Is there a way of changing the colour of the stars from 
The stars.lib extension??? 
When ya write a line: Stars On 0,0,128 for example, how do ya change 
the colour of them? Can you? (hope so..)
I have tried different things with palette and colour, but nothing 
works for me, so please, anyone help! (This is just for fun...)

Thx in Advance,

Marco.

Yeah, NOW I'm aware of, but this is much to late to remove it or I'll

No there should not be such problems, because the removement is NOT

Unfortunately I had to find the usage of some of them out, you know.

That's right. But many extensions store some internal values there
you cannot get else ;-)

I don't write the structures, I only read them out (and e.g call
some of the extensions routines like the init, the default and the
remove code).

Further, I am very sure that the will not change in the next 200
years.

The Music-Extension is totally crap. (I do not even have it in my

code to the extension.

I used a trick to allocate the sound channels before the music
extension installs the silly IntServer. It works like this.

Extremove 1 (Aha!)
Trap Audio Lock
Extreinit 1
Extdefault 1

Now you might see, for what reason I have included the ext commands.
And believe me: It works perfectly. ;-)

AC>   Blame Francois Lionet for this problem - he's a terrible programmer.

Oh yes, he is a unbelievable bad proggrammer :-)

When he released Amos Professional, the technical datas of the
AGA-Chipset
were already available. Why did he stick to 6 bitplanes? Why didn't
he
reserve memory for 8 pointers? Sorry, but I think he is an idiot.
Even
the oldest OCS-Chipset had already the space for 8 bitplanes
reserved.

AC>   Your extension is 40k?  You'd better check *all* the commands - AMOS

I've checked all commands... I encountered this bug the first time
on 04-Jun-94.

Suddenly, the Audio Lock and Audio Free commands, which were held at
the bottom of the extension did not work anymore ;-(

But after a huge debugging process using MonAm, I found a solution.

I've found a rather efficient solution for this problem. AMOS only
crashes, if a token routine (i.e a routine, that is directly called
by a command or function) lies beyond the 32 KB label. Non-Token
Routines do NOT crash at all. So what I've did: I placed all non
token procedures at the bottom of the extension and so kept the token
code in the upper 32 KB. No problem since that anymore.

The only problems appeared with the demo version of the extension
which was even greater in size, therefore I had to remove some
lengthy commands.

AC> Extension that allow other extensions to access Intuition data.  If

Grin... I see what I can do... You /do/ use PGP and have a PGP-key?
But how can I post ONE MEGABYTE OF DATA?

  What exactly do you mean?

>does anybody know how i can program in assembler directly with amos??
>(so not the btst commands in amos but the whole M68000 command set??)
>(maybe an extension??)

  Write your routine in assembler and assemble/link it as you would any
assembler program.  Keep the following two points in mind:

  - The routine must be fully relocatable - i.e. no absolute memory
    references.

  - The code must consist of exactly one code section and nothing else -
    no data or BSS sections.

  Once the code is written, load it into an AMOS bank using the Pload
command (Pload "filename",banknum).  Then you can call it by using the
Call command (Call banknum).  Make sure you set the data and address
registers correctly before the call, by using the Dreg() and Areg()
built-in arrays.

	No offense to ya Ben... but that's absurd.  First off lets say
that TechnoVenture is actually worth $2000... so someone is supposed
to make a $2000 investment for computer that is dying if it isn't
already dead.  Amiga Companies that supported Amiga long after
others are droped out are dropping out... even the people that made Amos 
dropped amiga.  Even you yourself has given the old amiga the ki-double
cack.

        Second, Technoventure isn't written in a portable
language... how do you expect the purchaser to claim any of
their investment back ?  Also what about the attitude towards
Amos that a lot of people on the Amiga share ?  (ie. that it's
crap).  Also Amos can't even do AGA... so TV couldn't even be
updated to AGA.

	TV was a good Amos program... but again no offense
intended T.V. just doesn't cut it for the current market
even if the Amiga wasn't dead.

	If someone really believes that TV rights are worth
$2000, I have some stuff to sell also.

Hi all.
Last week i received the last version of the Intuition extension demo from
Andy Church. I had a problem with it (and i have it now...).
Now explaining.

I installed intuition extension demo as lib #14 (as written in the manual).

After i runned Amos Pro. Note that i run Amos Pro from Workbench, and i
select a configuration using the AmosProMultiEnv by Paul Hickman!
But i think that APME it's not the cause of my problem , because i had
the same running amos pro from CLI.

However, the problem is this:
Amos Pro loads all the extensions, intuition included. All seems to procede 
very well but, at te last moment, before opening editor, system crashes with
a good Software Guru...
I checked loading with Snoop Dos and  noticed that guru comes when Amos Pro
tries to open NIL: (Yes, NIL:). 
Note that loading another configuration that doesn't include intuition
extension, when Amos Pro opens NIL:, all is OK and there are no Gurus!

However, this is the same problem i had with version 1.2 of Intuition
extension.

I would like to know if someone had the same problem or if i'm the only
one having it...

I hope in your helps!!!!!

	Anyway, I was just putting TechnoVenture on a scale with the projects I
HAVE gotten paid for.  I've gotten $3000 for less (but that was an actual pay
by hour job).  I'm getting $250 for a program I spent a total of less than
20 hours on.  I worked on TechnoVenture for about a year.  The point, I guess,
is the quality of the pruduct though.  And I agree, Amiga isn't doing so well.
BUT, I heard it's still going strong in other countries... it's popular in
Europe.  I didn't expect anybody on the AMOS list to be willing to make that
big of an investment, but the RIGHTS to an entire product AND idea ARE valuable.
Actually, I didn't consider this, but perhaps I shouldn't sell if I plan to port
TechnoVenture to the PC.  Anyway... one final point.  I was told a little story
about someone who made $50,000 from a "dinky" little game (on the Amiga I
believe).  Then the game was compared to TechnoVenture, which won the Playfield
programming competition in the game category.  TechnoVenture received a lot of
praise and sounded as if it would rate far above the "dinky" game.  I think that
in the right hands, TechnoVenture can earn a lot.  IBM hasn't taken over all 
of Europe [yet?] has it?
	Sorry to "toot my own horn" so loudly... it's just for argument's sake.

There are two ways (somewhat inderected I'm afraid)
- Write your assembly code in an assembler, assemble it and "put" it 
in a memory bank(usinfg Pload).Call it using Call bank_number.
- Write your code ........... and insert it in a procedure using the 
appropriate menu command.

    WARNING You code *MUST* be relocatable!!

I've got not the very exact your problem, but when i load the 
intuition program witch follows with the demo package i've got from 
Andy, I load it and run it, but nothing happends, the system stops, 
but NO guru turns up, just halting the system... So I can't do 
anything.... 

What is wrong Andy? Or anybody!

I'll say the same!!!

I have found that when you have the Intuition extension and JD extension 
both installed AMOSPro has troubles booting up so it appears to me that 
both these extensions are not compatible when installed. After removing 
the JD extension all was fine. I used SnoopDOS as well and AMOSPro 
crashed right when accessing the NIL: as well and it was due to JD 
extension. This was when I tried booting AMOSPro from Harddrive. JD works 
ok if the Intuition extension isn't installed.

Just ones adventures with AMOSPro :)

Ps. I am also 3/4 done with the latest to my ppACCESSORY which has a 
whole new look and even more user friendly interface. Built in AmigaGuide
documentation and now has password protection of your crunched source code.
I have elected not to add xpk support to this great accessory due to the 
fact that the name and original idea of ppACCESSORY was to use and 
support the powerpacker.library. If enuff users give me replies back on 
adding xpk support then I will go ahead and do so elsewise I won't bother 
as I haven't even heard if anyone uses the current version (v1.5) for 
that matter.

I need to know if anyone has come across any bugs such as problems 
crunching source code with m/l procedures in it or MED modules ect...

As I don't have the AMosPro compiler, I'm asking someone of you to help 
me compile two programs.
The fact is that I don't need those programs to be faster, but I want 
them to be completely independent from AMOS.
The two programs are two version of the Bezier Patch Modeler for POV-Ray.
One is already done and needs both EasyLife and Turbo Extensions.

The second version will see the light quite soon.

Is someone interested in compile this two little programs?

Thanks

I think XPK is more efficient than PP.
With XPK you can chose the library you want which best suits the kind of 
data you want to compress.
The slow SHRI or the great RAKE (which uses powerpacker.library) are only 
two example of very good compressors.
And adding XPK support has not compatibility problems with PP.

So I would like the XPK support

Thanks

Don't know other people, but I cannot get connected to the address you

How can I enter and how can I obtain an account?

Ga> A few questions:
Ga> 
Ga> 	Q: Does this thing work on OCS Amigas with KS1.3 running
Ga> 	   AmosPro?

Yes, I should work with exeception of one command (Pattern Match),
which requires Kick 2.0. However, I could not test the commands on
1.3 et al, but they *should* work (and I haven't received any
complaints yet ;) ).

Ga> 	Q: If so, how much is it and where can I get it?

It costs 69,- DM or $50, but the manual is written in german and I am
still working on the translation. You will be informed immediately
when the translation is finished. ;-)

Ga> PS: What are the PTile commands all about?

I began a Jump'n'Run game long time ago and as Tome is rather slow, I
tried out some processor-using very custom kind (one 16x16 in size)
of map routines and the were much faster than Tome, even on a
68000-processor.

Actually, there are only two PTile commands in the extension and I
don't think there is a real need these commands so I did not improved
them (they aren't even really mentioned in the manual ;-) ).

Ga> Gau of the Veldt

Funny name, Gau ;-) GAU in german is a abbreviation for "Groeszter

nuclear accident" ;-)

Erm... you cannot register the extension in that way. It is a
commercial product like TOME and D-Sam instead. If you want it, you
can order it from The Software Society (but be aware that this is
still the german version 1.0).

I'm doing the translation as quickly as possible but I'm still in
school and have many other things to do... Please be patiently. ;-)

So long and thanx for all the fish.

??? What's that?

v1> well thats not a problem but i want to make it as fast as it can be!

Hmmm... Using AMAL?

v1> so i want an amal charset-scroller.

Uh oh... the main problem might be to keep the different amal
routines in sync.

v1> Does anybody got some tips for me?? or do you got  a source witch
v1> makes this possible??

I've got several routines with scrollers (mostly using hardware
scrolling with screen offset, which is really one of the fastest
methods), but I don't know what you are really trying to do ;-)

v1> does anybody know how i can program in assembler directly with amos??

Simple thing that is! Write your assembly code using a normal
assembler, do NOT use relocable code (keep it pc-relative), do NOT
use more than one hunk and save the registers a3-a6. Then load the
executable using Pload into a bank and call it using the
"Call"-Command (you can set a few registers using Dreg and Areg).

An other method is to include the assembly code into a procedure.
When using parameters, the asm code will get these data on the
A3-stack. Read these out as you like, but DO take them all from the
stack, so that it is empty after the call or you will get some weird
problems with For-Next/Repeat-Until/While-Wend loops. To insert the
code, simply write something like this:

Procedure TEST[X,Y,C]

End Proc

...and place the cursor in the empty space. Now select the menu item
'Insert program' and select the executable asm code file. The
procedure will be folded and now you can call the procedure as
normal. To get detailed information, how the parameters are placed
and what you really can do, read the extension informations on one of
the original AMOS Pro Disks. ;-)

AMCAF-Extension (Amos Miscellaneous Commands And Functions) for AMOS
Pro V1.10 and higher. Size: Aprox. 40 KB. The complete AMCAF-Package
comes on two disks.

Includes over 200 commands and functions for various ranges. (bank
manipulation, turbo graphics, blitter commands, ShadeBobs and other
effects, fonts (e.g to put a normal textfont into a bank and vice
versa or to open a font directly from disk), colour-functions,
rainbow fading, disk access, pattern matching, Powerpacker and
FileImploder support, time and date, 4 player adapter, 3D-Vector
rotation, full ProTracker support (including CIA-Timing,
Sample-Output etc.) and other various commands.

BTW: I've put a demo created with AMCAF onto AmiNet dev/amos.

AMCAF is available for aprox. $50 from:

The Software Society
Hendrik H. Heimer
Schwarzachstr. 41
D-88214 Ravensburg
Germany

Tel: +49-751/67806
Fax: +49-751/651100

We are still searching for some British distributors.

NM> Can you uuencode me a copy with docs?

Hmm... the german manual is about 200 KB, the extension itself is
about 40 KB in size... I can post some kind of 'demoversion' of the
AMCAF Extension, which is fully usable (some commands have been
thrown out due to the bigger size of the demo-version) but you cannot
create executables when using the extension, although you can compile
as AMOS-Editor compilat.

If nobody has complaints about the size of the archive, I will post
this demoversion along with some example programs.

Ok. Here is the mirror-rainbow program. Due to the fact, that
normally the values in a rainbow are colour-values and nothing else,
AMOS will mask other values out (i.e the uppermost 4 Bits). The
Mirror-Effect needs a negative value to work and as consequence, you
must patch a byte in the AMOSPro.Lib. The following program does that
for you (warning: requires AMOS Pro 2.0).

' *************************************

Screen Open 0,640,256,2,$8000
Curs Off : Flash Off : Paper 0 : Pen 1 : Cls 0

' The next line is AMCAF-only. It has been replaced by:

Now the mirror-rainbow program:

Get Bob 1,0,0 To 101,101 : Hot Spot 1,$11

RN=0
Set Rainbow RN,0,260,"","",""
RADR=Areg(5)-2152
' This is the crucial point of the program: It chances the rainbow 
' colour from 0 to the modulo register.
Doke RADR+RN*24+8,($108-$180)/2 
For Y=200 To 259
  Rain(0,Y)=-(320/8)*2 
Next

ANG=0

  Wait Vbl 
  Add ANG,3
  Bob 0,160+Cos(ANG)*100,128+Sin((ANG*13)/10)*100,1
Loop 

If you want to see more fantastic uses for rainbow-tricks, just say
it ;-)

I recently heard of the possibility to connect a SVGA monitor to
your amiga 1200/4000 with the help of an adapter.
This made be able to display flickerfree modes in my workbench
on my new 15 inches SVGA monitor. It is wonderful.

However, when I program in amos and open new screens like

Screen Open 1,640,512,16,Laced+hires

ofcause the screen will be laced (laced+hires).

Is there a way to open a flickerfree 640*512 hires screen noninterlaced
in Amos? I would appreciate any help!

By the way, I am programming in Amos Pro 2.0 and I like the new editor,
but I would truely like to include different colours in the scource-code
while editing to emphazise the different level of commands etc. 
This would improve the readability while programming - right?

It this possible and then what should I do? 

Thanks for all possible help.

Dux.

I have (finally) uploaded a new version of easylife. This one comes
complete with an amigaguide help viewer, and amigaguide help for all
AMOS commands & extension commands. I.E. You can press the help key in
the AMOSPro editor over either an easylife command, or an AMOSPro command
and you will see the amigaguide help page on the AMOS editor screen, like
with the old AMOSPro help system. This will also work for other extensions
if their documentation uses the same conventions (Andy's intuition docs
are compatable - just copy them to the right directory).

Also included is an improved structured variable system with more builtin
types, and constants/enumerations, a faster variable checker, and a
primitive MUI program optimiser (Which needs much more work, but I'm of
on industrial placement for six months). There are also tutorials on using
abstruct data types such as lists, queues & trees.

Where can you get it?

I have E-Mailed a copy to Andy Church, so expect to see it on the AMOS Web
Pages soon. I have also uploaded it to aminet - files:

/pub/aminet/dev/amos/Easylife110_P1.lha
/pub/aminet/dev/amos/Easylife110_P2.lha
/pub/aminet/dev/amos/Easylife110_P3.lha

These may take a few days to filter though the aminet system to all mirrors,
but should turn up soon. The full aminet readme file follows:

   named "Easylife1:" for floppy use,
   or any temporary directory for harddisk
   installation.

 - Easylife110_P2.lha  - Unpack to disk 
   named "Easylife2:" for floppy use
   or a different temporary directory for 
   harddisk installation.

 - Easylife110_P3.lha  - Unpack to any
   temporary directory. You may should
   install parts 1 & 2 first.

 - MUI (Aminet /dev/gui/mui23usr.lha &
   /dev/gui/mui23dev.lha  -  23 may be replaced
   with the latest version number)

 - XPK (Aminet /util/pack/xpk25usr.lha  -
   25 may be replaced with the latest 
   version number)



Extension Features:

 - MUI Interface Creation

 - XPK file I/O

 - Advanced String Handling & Searching

 - Screen Zone Enhancements

 - Taglist Support

 - Adds struct or RECORD types to AMOSPro


Accessories:

 - AmosGuide - An amiga guide file viewer
   written in AMOS which runs on the AMOSPro
   editor screen, and replaces the help feature.
   Allows access to both AMOSPro & Extension
   commands when you press the Help key. (And not
   just this extension)

 - Variable Checker - Finds bugs in your program
   that the AMOS 'Test' feature doesn't. New verison
   runs faster, and allows you to fix one bug before
   displaying the next. Also picks up bad programming
   style.

 - Editor Enhancer - Improves the AMOSPro editors
   pathetic attempt at Search & Replace with something
   more useful, and which understands AMOS souce code,
   so you can just search code/strings/comments. Also
   adds 4 extra featues Enter AscII, Enter Scancode,
   Enter Filename & Unflip Bobs.

 - Zone Editor - Allows you to draw your screen zones.
   Version 3.0 is an update to use now new easylife
   functions.

 - Taglist editor - Not quite muibuilder for AMOS, but
   it allows you to precompile MUI taglists to a bank.

 - Structures Compiler - Allows you to define your
   struct/RECORD type variables as comments in your
   source code, then run this accessory to compile them
   into a bank for use.
 

Other Features:

 - Complete Amigaguide Documentation for Easylife & AMOSPro
   itself

 - Replacement MagicWB style icons for AMOSPro

 - Tutorials on using structured variables

 - Useful AMOS Procedures

 - Assembler include files for advanced programming

 - Warped sense of humour in documentation
