I have Easylife extension but the docs are not very good.
There's not an better (larger and more complete) version of the docs?
Maybe written in Amigaguide format?

And does anyone has a German to English (or Italian) translator or a
translated version of JDlib extension?
Thanks a lot

Hi, I'm new to this group and have got a couple of questions which have 
probably been asked before ...

When is the AGA extension for AMOS pro going to be released? - is there
such a thing as this extension?  And where would I get this in the UK?

Also Amiga Computing have a review for an intuition extension called Liberator
 - Is this the same one being coded by Playfield!? If not what will be the 
 difference(s) and which one would be best to buy?

 Any help/advice would be gratefully accepted.

 Paul

   I love Amos... but I agree things like this are needed to get more
out of the language.. that is why I am working on C compilier for amos..

Don't expect anything too quick though... I don't formally take my
compilier design course until next semester but I have started reading
the books... plus I am goign to cheat and use an LR(1) parser generator..

bye..

No, the extensions do not need to be distributed along with a standalone
program.  The compiler will add the appropriate code.

Well Andy, if you don't have any luck with Europress, you could always
ignore their wishes that you don't continue Amos development and use
a dis-assembler to get at the code.

Then you could write "legit" patches for Amos.

Damned stupid company. (Europress, that is)

The AGA extension is actually Intuition AGA, which is being coded by Andy 
Church.  It works with the new TURBO PLUS (when released) to give you AGA 
graphics capabilities.  At present you can open AGA screens, cut and 
paste icons and use the TURBO PLUS Scene commands for very fast AGA scene 
generation.  This should all be released soon.  If you have access to the 
world wide web, check out the web page its been growing slowly, but its 
getting there!

There was a call for some example procedures, so here goes.  This 
procedure was made for a program that I never released.  However it still 
retains its usefulness outside the program.

This procedure is good for setting up buttons using zones or just setting up
button-like text boxes.

Note that when you have called this that there will be a new defined zone 
if you have asked for it.

If you use this code, and release the resultant program, you don't owe me 
anything except acknowledement in your doc file.

Procedure BUTTON[X,Y,IN$,Z_NUM]
   '
   ' x = x pos of text  
   ' y = y pos of text
   ' in$ = button label 
   ' z_num = zone number to assign (0 if no zone) 
   '
   ' set zone if we need too
   Ink 3
   If Z_NUM<>0
      Set Zone Z_NUM,X-3,Y-8 To(Len(IN$)*9+(X-3)),Y+2
   End If

  Question (to other list members): did everyone else get that "=20" at the
end of some lines, or is it just me?

  What program created the AMOSPro.Lib.bak file?  I know that my "patch" to
AMOSPro.Lib (which I almost immediately discovered didn't work... remember?)
made a backup of AMOSPro.Lib before doing its stuff.  Try copying the .bak
file over AMOSPro.Lib and see if that fixes the problem.

  If you're looking for code examples, try the Procedure Library (it's on the
AMOS WWW site, or dev/amos/ProcLib30.lha on AmiNet).  Speaking of which, I'm
willing to pick up the project again if people are willing to send me code...

  There's not an AGA extension per se, but my Intuition Extension supports
AGA screen modes.

  Mine - I get the money. :-)

  Seriously, in my (as unbiased as I can make it) opinion, my extension is
the better one.  The Liberator extension is essentially an interface to
the system libraries - you can call a function like Intuition's
OpenWindow() by name rather than by Intcall() (or Execall(), etc.) and a
function offset; you still need to set up any structures or pointers
yourself.  The Intuition Extension, however, lets you use commands very
similar to AMOS's graphics commands to handle Intuition graphics.  For
example, you can open an Intuition screen with the command:

Iscreen Open number,width,height,colours,mode [,title$ [,displayID]]

while with Liberator you'd have to set up a NewScreen structure using
Pokes, Dokes, and Lokes, then call the OpenScreen() function.

  You can already buy the Intuition Extension from PLAYFIELD!, even though
I'm still working on it.  (After all, a program - or extension - as large
as this is never finished.)  E-mail Ryan Scott (rscott@gate.net) for
information.

   Agreed.  My interest in joining this list was that is was a great 
place to communicate with others and get information on AMOS and AMOS- 
related topics.  I too think this group could definetly become a key factor 
in the long term survival of AMOS.  I would not like to see other 
languages included in this group unless it has a  direct relation to AMOS 
(extensions, assembly routines, etc.).

Well, it seems 1 person wants other langauges on the list, and the rest don't, so can
we drop the 'What happens now?' thread - nothing needs to happen. All the postings
about 'AMOSPro should be PD' are a bit redundant as well - We would all like to be able to update it, only europress can give the permission, so repeatedly posting that it 
should be PD here is a total waste of our time - what do you expect - an argument?
Fill europresses mailbox with all this junk.

Also, on the question of not enough code examples being posted, I believe that
you shouldn't post code just for the sake of it - We have the procedure library for
usefull procedures (Which is now on the AMOS WWW site in unarchived form, so you can
browse though it), and demos can be uploaded to aminet, or the WWW Site (By mailing
them uuencoded to play@gate.net, or me if they are smallish).

However when you have a programming problem, then you shuold always post the section of
code that is going wrong - don't just describe it. There is much more chance that you
will get some help. 

P.S. Anyone expected an update to easylife today, blame Christian Mumenthaler for
writting colonial conquest (in AMOS of course). Soon.

Well, I uploaded the September messages to Aminet.  Hopefully they will be
available within the day.  I also included the FAQ with it.

Does anyone wish to be on the AMOS FAQ list?  If you are already on the list,
you will receive it right after this message.  I hope.  :)

Anyone care to help with the FAQ?  The main thing I need is for people to check
my list of programs on Aminet.  I have not added Chaneques yet.  Are there
any others that I am missing?

Also, for all you extensions owners and authors, can you check the list to
make sure I have the right slots and versions?  Also, for the authors, please
send me a couple lines of description.  Include what it does, works with,
how to get it, etc.

Thanks.

Hi all,
 Many moons ago I released a set of Intuition-simulating procedures as 
"Licenseware" under the name of "AMtuition". I haven't received any 
royalties for this product for quite some time, so I assume that interest 
in it has faded. Now, my question is this: if I was to go to the trouble 
of making it freeware (at the moment I have a distribution contract with 
CLR), would anyone be interested in it? Or shall I just leave it as 
licenseware, in the vain hope that I might get some more sales? The money 
doesn't matter particularly to me (much to my disappointment, no-one ever 
sent me a 4000-040Tower in payment.. :-) ), but I think that the procedres 
are good & worth using (I put a lot of work into them), and I guess that 
interest in them is going to plummet even further with the imminent 
release of Andy Church's "proper" Intuition extension..

Regards,

 David Hollway.

	I got a bunch o' little procedures (for instance manual filled polygons,
linked lists and stuff), but I think, Unfortunately, I'm deciding to leave the
list since I've moved to IBM now.  I never thought it would be such a complete
turnover but I think the thing is that I just can't use two different systems
for general purposes in my life.  I automatically choose one.  Anyway, I'll
try to post some of those procedures to amos-list eventually.  If anyone
wants to write me about TechnoVenture (and/or find out its cheat codes), just
remember my E-Mail address: marty@cs.hope.edu.
	Oh, I just looked back and you may be wondering about the purpose for
manually filled polygons.  That program will let you have polygons with variable
number of sides up to ... was it 1,000 or 10,000... edges.  That would quite
impractical using an AMOS command line.  It is, however, a little slow.  Hey,
I could kill two balls of wax with one bird in the bush (ehh) by sending the
polygon program that uses linked list for edges!

Any AMOS/AMOSPro game writters out there here are a few game idea's:

- Burgertime (C=64 Conversion)
- Wizard Of Wor (C=64 Conversion)
- Crazy Climber (Arcade game)
- Targ (Arcade Game)

Also just an idea that you can add ARexx support to your code for adding 
cheats to your game as AMOSPro has the ability to add ARexx to your 
programs, same goes for any utilities or applications that you make.

Just a few idea's to grow on :)

Yeah I (and probably everybody else) got the =20's.

To solve this problem you must turn of the MIME encoding on your mailing
program.

If you are using ELM, there is a cycle gadget for this option in the window
which pops up after you have finished editting your mail.(I think it is
the top-most gadget).

Simply cycle thru the options until you come to "NONE".

You wouldn't believe the amound of trouble I was having sending uuencoded
data while this option was turned on. :(

Starfish and coffee, anyone?

I am a quite experienced AMOS and AMOS Pro user, but since I upgraded to AMOS Pro 2.0 and the AMOS Pro Compiler things has started to get hard.

When I compile my programs, everything works fine, I can start it from CLI or WB, but!

When I try to use the program on an older Amiga with a std. MC68000 processor, something fucks up, and the well known GURU appears. 

I am working on an A1200 with a Blizzard 1230 running on 40MHz with an 68882 40MHz FPU, 4 megs of fast ram. But I think the same shit happened before I accelerated my A1200 and was running on a plain MC68020. What do I do wrong????

Hello everyone,

I believe time has come to introduce myself to you.

I am 19 years old sophomore at the University of Amsterdam.
Artificial Intelligence is my major, but incidentally I attend Computer Science courses.

I have been taught/have learned the following languages:
- Basic  (Basic 2.0, Simon's Basic, GW Basic, Amiga Basic; all crap)
- Logo   (Which my father "taught" me, to educate me :-)
- Pascal (Part of college course)
- PROLOG ( "   "     "      "     ; Weird language!)
- C      (I am very inexperienced in this)
- AMOS   (*HURRAY*)  

My current equipment is a humble A2000, 1Mb, _no_ harddisk(!) and a Multisync.
I have plans to buy an A1200HD (shortage of money won't stop me).

Okay, now about AMOS:

I am using AMOS Classic 1.36. 
My programming interests are arcade games, especially platformers.
Past completed projects include an intelligent bat'n'ball game, a text-only 
adventure (which I lost due to SADDAM), and some personal stuff.  

I am currently working on an SF platformer/shoot'em-up.
(for more info: please mail me!)
Stage of development:

- game design is almost finished
- plot is nearing completion
- basic mechanics are coded
- graphics are being produced 
- music is put on hold (lost contact with musician)  
- sfx are put on hold

Why I joined this list:
 
Well, as far as I have experienced, AMOS (the way I use it) is not capable of
running my game; the compiler helps a bit, but it's still slooooow.  

I know most of you are skillfull, experienced programmers, so I turn to you for
help. 

More on this will be posted in later mailings.....

I believe I have introduced myself well, but if you have any question, please
feel free to ask!  

One last note:
It can (and sometimes will :-) take a while to reply your letters/comments,
because of irregular net-use. 
              
"          /|                      " 
      My  /-|miga loves AMOS!

All very well! 

But I can`t access Aminet from my computer. :(

(It`s not an Amiga - but a Xerox 6085, yep, I`m mailing from work. It`s free you see! :)

I hope the best for you. AmosPro is, IMO, an excellent product -
editor, compiler, everything in one package a la PC compilers.
But since EuroPress dropped Amiga (grrr) I hope someone like you will
get the rights to update it. I'm willing to pay money to get a bugfixed
version. You should let EuroPress know that there are customers who
want _support_! I've bought Amos, Amos 3D, Amos Compiler, Amos Pro,
Amos Pro Compiler.... and now I don't get updates. I'll break some knees
if I don't get my AmosPro 2.1 :-)

Ok, 1st the '=20'-thingy: My pine configuration is fucked.

I tried running AmosPro from floppies. I re-installed it from scratch.
And I noted something: When the top of the display area flashes,
and the mouse pointer hangs, what actually happens, is that I get
a recoverable alert:

Error: 0100 000F

The task address is irrelevant I think. I also tried AmosPro 2.00 on my
brothers 2MB (chip) A1200. Same problem: this same alert appeared when
I hit F1/F2/F3.

   I have always loved strictly text adventures.  I never really took a 
liking to those text games with still graphics (I had the tendency to  
turn the pictures off if possible).  The early King's Quests brought a 
nice change to adventure games by adding interactive graphics while 
still retaining the text input.  This started to feel a bit old to me 
though, when the later Sierra games came out with the slick, graphical 
point-and-click interface.  I do feel however, that this interface is too 
simplified and limiting.  Lucasfilm games seem to have nice situation 
sensitive control but again I they feel too limited in options to me.
   What does this all mean?  I dunno.  It's just my humble $0.02 worth.  
I guess what Im trying to say is that each type of system has (to me at 
least) advantages AND disadvantages.  You have to decide which things are 
more important to your game.  My synopsis: text - probably most flexible but 
quite dated and relatively unpopular today; text+graphics - pretty 
pictures may not really enhance game; text+interactive graphics - great 
blend of flexibility and use of graphics but again rather dated;  
graphical interface - easy to use and most common today but not really
flexible.  Again remember this is just my OPINION. :)

I have had these problems as well and I know that it`s nothing
to do with your blizzard board.

I think the problem is with the Pro compiler itself.  When a
program gets over a certain size it seems to lose all
backward compatability.

The way I solved this problem was to use the AMOS 1.36
compiler. This caused more problems as I was using Amos Pro
to develop my programs.  At first Amos 1.36 would not
recognise my code but for some strange reason it does now,
perhaps its some extension I added to pro.

If you cant load your program into 1.36 you must save it as 
ASCII and all the banks to files. Now you must reassemble it
in 1.36.  I also found that sometimes packed screens fuck up
on the A500 and AMOS 1.36 when packed from AMOS Pro, the
answer is to repack them on the 1.36 from the original
pictures.

This is all a major chore but its worth it for your programs 
to work on all Amigas.  If anyone has any better ideas on how

  Well, it finally came... I haven't seen it yet (I just got a message
from my dad at his office) but he says that the general idea is "We're
not going to develop AMOS anymore, we're glad you want to, we don't
object but can't help."

  So... it looks like the AMOS Development team is on!  I don't know yet
whether I can get the source or whether we'll have to disassemble the
code, but AMOS development will be continued.

that - it might help.

	I just wanted to stay that from my experience if you are looking for
an intuition extension I would instantly want Andy's... why ?  From my
experience with Andy I found him to be an excellent coder and extremly
knowledgable... and I am not saying this because I am somehow involeved
with the extension.. I am not... I am saying this because it is the truth..
I have not ordered Andy's extension because right now I don't want easy
to use intuition... I want to learn it the hard way... and if I get Andy's
extension I never will... somedays I curse the fact that I bought Amos
in the first place... it makes everything (gfx wise) extremly easy... so
I have absolutely no desire to learn how do something equivalent in C or
ASM... anyways I just want to say good luck to you Andy with your extension
and I hope you do get some money... The funny thing to me is that the
equivalent in the IBM world would probably make you filthy rich... 
(but thats no excuse to go over to the dark side..)

	I remember downloading the demo and I was impressed... but I never
got around to ordering it.... Just a note the main reason I was going to
order it was not because I wanted to actaully use the routines I just
wanted them to look at... so I would be intrested in looking at the freeware
version...

	This one caused me much pain... with the older workbenchs/cpu's amos
 does something screwy if you have any Icon or Sprite banks (I can't remeber
 which) saved with the program... this does not cuase an error if the 
 programs and just amos compilied (ie. a non-exec compile)... this is not a
 problem with the newer wb's/cpu's... I hope this helps...

  your game... but I do believe that Amos is able to do a really good job
  at platform games.... for example this summer I finished coding Super
  Mario Brothers for Amos.. which I of course can not release but it ran
  at the same speed on my A4000 and my A500... But I am working on a 
  game that will incorporate these routines with of course different gfx..

	For example try to get rid of everything calculation... make tables
  for everything you can... for example make a table of jump values for
  your main character eg. DATA -8,-8,-8,-8,-4,-4,-4,-2,-2,-2,0,0,0,2,2, etc..
  then when your guy is jumping all you have to do is just keep reading
  values out the table.. also use x and ($F) instead on x mod 16 (or 
  equivalent values of 8 or 32).. if your map scrolls in all directions
  then have map stored in row-major format for the left/right and have
  the same map stored in col-major format for the up/down (this means that
  you can update the map by just using INC's) also don't use any procedures
  in your ''main loop'' just use procedures for anything that is not 
  speed critical.. ie. initialization/high score table/clean up.. plus
  unroll any loops you can.. this can get messy but it is worth it.. 

	The biggest disadvantage to this type of coding is that you
  really are optimizing for the specific and most frequent cases so you
  lose nice general routines... but it does work.. and gets messy when
  you have to change things...


	Anyways if you want to talk more just mail me..

Hi there!

I remember that I had very big troubles with a compiled
program which was very long. It compiled well but always crashed
nearly immediately. (I use the Amos Creator 1.36)

The problem was that the maximal number of global variables
was set too low in the compiler configuration file.
There is a small AMOS program with the name "Compile_large.AMOS"
or something similar which automatically increases these values.
(In fact, the program just exchanges the actual configuration file
with another).
However, the compiled program did still NOT run because these values
were still TOO LOW. I increased them again massively (20000 global
variables or something, and I increased also all the other values)
and compiled again. After this, my program worked fine!
I never had to change this configuration file again, so I can not remember
everything exactly... All I can say is that since then all my programs
run fine.

Regards,

	Chris

Can you transcribe it and e it to the list for all to see, Andy?

Yes, yes, yes, yes (Meg Ryan in "When Harry Met Sally")

I hope they give Andy, and whoever else is interested, the original source
code. Then we can see what was going thru the mad French-man  mind when he
wrote all those crashes and hangs into his code.

Well Andy, lets hope your Dad wasn't giving you the wind-up! ;)

Rumours have Commodore is quiting etc. etc. etc.

You all properbly heard about it...
Then fewer and fewer A1200 were for sale...

In The Netherlands, it was said to be sold out !

BUT NOW !

A company in The Netherlands sells A1200 again for a very low price
Something that would indicate either new A1200 of dump-prices...

They cost about   Dfl 550.-   (DM 480) (+/- US$ 330)

What's happening ?  Has anybody any more info ?

That sounds too good to me!!!!!!!
Is it the truth? 

How will you distribute your upgrades, extensions, or new versions of the
program? I am very interested.

I am interested in the extension.
Have you got the demo or can I find it somewhere?

What are the main features of this extension?

The original AMOS compiler doesn't cope very well with any program with 
large numbers of variables, or with a small number of large variables.  I 
can't get it to compile anything that needs a Set Buffer command. Any ideas?

God knows!

Commodore is no longer a household name! Don`t use it! It`s either Amiga
International Inc. / Amiga Technologies Inc. (Provided the bid put forward by
David Pleasance/Colin Proudfoot [two MDs from CBM UK] is successful)

I need to get a new Amiga because my previous A1200 died after commiting
suicide from a six foot shelf! :*(

I tried everywhere but no one had any left, even ZCL (the biggest suppliers in
Britain.) Then I tried a small shop close to home and they claim to have a few
left - but they wouldn`t disclose any info!

My guess is, there are still *VERY FEW* numbers left in circulation that will
pop up now and again. What is interesting to note is that even in these times
of uncertainty, there is still a demand for Amigas?!?

BTW: What`s all this got to do with AMOS - except that without Amigas AMOS
wouldn`t exist!

I did a load of intuition procs` ages ago as well. (Probably at the same time
you were doing your in fact! :*)

I never released them, because you got there first!!! And you had a few
procedures that I didn`t manage to figure out completely! :*(
(ASL File Requesters and sliders. I had a cool Action Requester routine
though!)

But I thought they were impressive! I was however going to release mine as PD!

Hello people!

That reminds me. Can AMOS play looped samples?
I know SamPlay doesn`t - just single shot ones.
But what about SamRaw?

At the moment I resort to making a module with the one sound effect that I`m
trying to loop, convert it to AMOS music bank format (because you can play
sound FX over the top of a module) and then shove in the necessary sound FX in
a different channel.

Any ideas?

	Regards, Mat

Hi,

I am looking to create an Intro to one of my programs and I wanna be able 
to scroll the graphic fonts like the one's in TurboPlus and I am in need 
of some example code to show me how to do this as the method I wanna do 
is have some text at the top scroll back and forth like a swing kinda 
like the intro's you used to see back in the days of the Commodore 64. If 
anyone has some example code or mail me a uuencoded copy of it would be 
great :)

Thanks much !

			Re: AMOS Professional

Dear Andrew

We are sorry to confirm that Francois Lionet is no longer developing
AMOS due to commitments on other projects.

At Europress, we are concentrating on developing software for the PC
and can only offer support on the existing range of Amiga programs.

It is nice to learn of the existence of your group and your interest
in continuing with AMOS.  We have no objection to any developments/
updates that you may wish to make to AMOS.  However with our
commitment to PC software we regret that we would not be able to offer
any support.

Yours sincerely

Mat,

Sure, the Sam Loop command.  "Sam Loop On %ChannelList"  Thing is, Sam Loop
On is broken in Creator (an maybe Pro?), you have to do:

 Sam Loop On
 Sam Loop Off %1110

Put a ZERO in the Sam Loop Off command where you want the chanel to loop,
only Off works with a bit pattern so you have to turn looping ON for all
channels and then turn it off for the ones you don't want to loop.

I don't have any problems compiling (with Pro Compiler) a program with a large
numbers of variables. Currently I am developing a football (or soccer) database
and the first line is Set Buffer 256 and there is no problem. The compiled
program run fine.

OK, Sam loop On eh!

But doesn`t that just loop the WHOLE sample in memory?
Can you loop PART of a sample, via: repeat / replenish points?

Yes, you can loop samples, but they have to be SamRaw samples (according to
the manual, I can't be arsed to check out SamPlay, cuz I lazt like that:)

Just use Sam Loop On.

The only problem is that it will loop samples played in any channel, so
once you've set samples to loop, every sample start after will loop. :(

Does Paul Reece's<sp?> EME solve this annoying problem?

I always use Sam Raw cuz then you can load them as iff or raw, cut
out the header (if iff) and play the sample without having to piss about 
with sample banks.

BTW, Does anybody want a copy of my "IFF 2 RAW 2 IFF" sample convertor?
it will load iff samples and remove/decode the iff header or you can
load raw samples. You can change the pitch of the note to what you think
sounds best. This is useful for saving samples as iff with a different
pitch. You can then save as iff (with correct iff header) or as raw.
Dead useful for correcting the pitch of iff samples.
I think it's name sums it up really; "IFF 2 RAW 2 IFF"

I have also written a sample player which can play either iff or raw
samples as a cli command.

ALSO, I have written a hypermedia program. You can creat your own
hypertext files (in ascii) and link it to sounds or still/animated (pre
AGA) images.

Mail me if you're interested.

*Paul Hickman/Ryan Scott* do you want these programs for the W3 site?

Enough blathering,

>CJC> Mike Singleton for his Midwinter program.

>Whats this Technique and whats Midwinter? Can you give me some more
>information? What types of maps does it generate - ie outdoor, dungon, 1st
>person perspective, top down etc...

Midwinter was a 3D first person perspective adventure/strategy/arcade 
type game released, oooooh, about 5 years ago (give or take a year),
and rereleased as a budget game a year ago. 
One of the features of the game was that the map of the playing area 
was generated by starting with a small predrawn map, then zooming 
into the map, interpolating the new pixels in such a way that the
zoomed map wasn`t just a blocky version of the original.

Imagine this:

A B
C D    are four pixels in your original map.

To perform the `Midwinter` Zoom you do this:

A      B

    E

C      D    where E is the average value of A,B,C and D, with a 
small random offset added (the seed for the randomize
function is generated from the current x,y coordinate so that
every time you generate the map it will look the same).

Then you do this:

A  F  B

G  E  H

C  I  D       where F, G, H and I are generated from the averages
of the pixels horizontally and vertically adjacent to them, plus
the random offset. e.g. G = Average(A,C,E, and the pixel to the
left of G which isn`t shown here] + random offset.

Note that you have to work out E first.

The maps produced look like satellite imagery of land masses,
clouds, the sea bed, whatever, depending on the output
technique used. Currently, my little prog shows the map after
removing isolated points, after smoothing, after false contouring
and after simple lightsourcing.

I suppose I could upload the current map generator somewhere,
Aminet for instance, if anyone is interested. And Darryl, if you`re
interested in the routines I could mail you a copy direct. 
Also, for anyone with back issues of ACE (a long deceased
multi-format magazine) the technique was descibed in one of
the later issues, issue number unretrievable from memory
at present time.

Well, you`ve answered part of the question. My final year as an
electronic engineering undergraduate introduced me to the world
of image processing, so I decided to have a go at coding some of
the theories presented in the course.
Additionally, I don`t feel like spending large sums of cash on ADPro
if I can write the software myself. Come on, this is an AMOS list
for petes sake. I don`t see you telling AMOS games writers to
just buy the commercial equivalent. If we all just bought 
commercially available programs instead of writing our own
progs, there`d be no point in packages like AMOS.......

Well, that microflame rounds off this message.

Status: RO

Is there a simple way, assuming there are multiple BOBs and/or
sprites moving around, to detect which objects collide. It appears
you can detect that there was a collision easy enough but I can't
find a command that identifies the objects that collided. In addition,
is there a command that can detect when an object has reached the end
of the visible play field (i.e., physical terminal). This assumes that 
the playfield is larger than the physical terminal. If not, I'd sure
appreciate some examples of how to do this.

I thought your 'Mig took a swan-dive from a shelf or cupboard of sum'ink.
At the moment, you're doin' nowt. Get round to that shop and
buy yoursen a new one.

Have you resurrected it?

Go on Matt tell the list exactly what 'appened to your 'Mig, *in detail*.

I'm sure they'd all like a laugh <hehehe>

What? That means BF11000? I bought mine at 18000;- (which is some fl 900)

Btw, Dopex, somewhere in the past, you sent me Madonna module or something.
Could you send it to me again please? I never downloaded it (erased it 
accidently :]

Sorry that I ask these things in public, but I can't remeber any of the 
names (let alone addresses) involved.
Some guy on this list made Chaneques (or something). Well, if he could 
send it to me, another happy person would inhabit this global village (is 
this a censored word as well?)
Also, somebody else made that EasyLife extension... I'm interested as 
well :)
Oh, and about commercial games... Hasn't anybody noticed that "Valhalla 
and the Lords of Infinity" is written in AMOS (in six weeks)? I read that 
in CU, in the readers' letters dept. The game wasn't really reviewed 
awfully positively, but some said it wasn't a bad try at all (scores 
ranging from 60% on...) In fact, I'm noticing a certain neglect towards AMOS 
from the side of the Amiga mags. Readers who ask them for advice on an 
easy, yet powerful programming language always get Blitz recommended. 
Also, when a game is written in Blitz, they can't stop telling us. 
(remember the war, er, Skidmarks. And that game was published by the same 
publishers as Blitz itself, so it's very probable that the programmer(s) 
of Blitz created the game, which prolly means they inserted a huge load 
of ASM code as well. IMHO Valhalla etc. is better publicity for AMOS than 
Shitmarks (oh dear, did I write that wrong?) is for Blitz, because 
Valhalla was written by a standalone programming team. Well, enuf about 
that.)

I don't have my manual handy, but there is a function that tells you if 
two objects collided - I think it's something like Bob Col (a,b) which 
returns True if a and b collided.

I am real happy about the decision of Andy (whoops, forgot his 
family-name...) to continue development of Amos, but, and this is no 
reflection of his talents or commitment. But I think the key word is 
commitment and maybe Amos would be better in the hands of a developer who 
would be able to give 200% commitment to it.
Again, I am not trying to doubt Andy in any way, but there are a lot of 
people out there who are chomping at the bit for the next version of 
Amos, with all the latest additions and features, on a non-profit making 
(I assume, you haven't mentioned anything about taking it over as a 
commercial product) basis, are you sure you will not get totally p!$$@d 
off with the amount of pressure to release the newest version?

Oh well, that's all I gotta say for now, 'xcept I agree with the post 
about text adventures being abnormally cool.....

   Well, now that it appears AMOS is no longer in the hands of 
Lionet and Europress, and that this list will be a major factor in 
keeping it alive, let's ask ourselves one question:

   What do we want to do with it?

   Let's address all the changes/additions that we would like to see in 
AMOS!  I'm going to make up a short list myself and I think that all of 
us should as well.  Hopefully, some of these suggestions might appear in  
the next release or in future extensions.

Ed,

Once you know if an object has hit something (e.g. For A=FirstShotBob to
LastShotBob : If Bob Col(A,FirstEnemyBob to LastEnemyBob) : a hit : endif
: next), just do this:  For A=FirstTargetBob to LastTargetBob : if Col(A) :
the bob used in the last Bob Col hit object A : endif : next a.
Where FirstTargetBob and LastTargetBob are the Bob numbers of the things
that you want to check to see if they hit the object you just Bob Col
checked.

If you're using an extra large screen, you're probly using Screen Offset to
change what area of it you see, right?  If so, just check to see if the
Bob's X co-ord is more than 320+XF (where XF is the X offset in Screen
Offset), and if the X is less than 0+XF.  Do the same for the Y co-ord
of the Bob if you scroll up and down as well.  If you want the Bobs to be
bobbed even if they are only a little bit on the screen, and most of your
bobs are 32 pixels or less, just use this for horizontal scrolling:
"If X>-16+XF and X<336+XF then Bob n,X,Y,I"

Chris,

I'd like to see your mapping routines.  Could you send them to me too
please?  Or just send them to Aminet.

Thanks.

Hi Everyone!

OK, so it looks like AMOS may be continued. Personally I`m a bit dubious about
EuroPress handing over the source code. Even if they have no interest in
continuing, they may strike up some sort of "agreement". After all, they did
put a lot of time and money into the product, I don`t think they are just going
to hand it over to someone else who isn`t a software developer (registered I
mean - Are you Andy?)

If they do give up source/rights to AMOS - don`t expect any help!
And I would be careful with the source code, to prevent a multitude of "rouge"
versions running around. This needs to handled *professionally*
otherwise it may get out of hand.

Mat.

Dear All,

(Sad organ music in background...)

Thankyou for being here today, for this is indeed a solom time for us all. What
can I say, A1200 was a dear fellow,  colleague, and may I say, a good friend.

I`d like to begin by saying that, we will all miss A1200, along with 60 Meg HD.
And hope that we can all remember A1200 for what he has contributed to the
Amiga society.

	- Half finished "Alien War" a fine production.
	- GUI-Ed. GadToolsBox for AMOS.
	- World Of Chaos, the fractal generator.
	- And countless effects that were never used!

Yes, A1200 has indeed contributed. But was never recognised for his true talent
(Ahem!) because he never released anything into PD!

This is a sad tale, of a life that ended so quickly, when really, it was only
beginning. (?)

A1200, denied a monitor for a while, was left to mooch around a room, with
nothing to do but get in the way. Because of this, A1200 was banished to "Six
foot shelf", where he was to spend the rest of his days without Mr. Monitor to
keep him company!

It was this, loneliness, this empty void of companionship that forced A1200 to
take the ultimate sacrifice - his own life.

It was one evening when A1200, locked in his cell of darkness (a cupboard!)
saw his opportunity when his keeper opened the door for a brief moment.

In desperation, A1200 lept from his domain and fell, six foot onto a *hard*
floor. There was no chance of survival, and A1200 knew this. (He also knew that
other A1200s are difficult to get hold of! He did this on purpose to piss me
off - the b*@!#*d! Ahem...)

There he lie. Cold and still. With six keys strewn across the floor.

In a mad attempt to revive A1200 I set about cardiovascular action, and plugged
him in. Only to hear the last breath of life squeeze out of the HD as it
stopped spinning. (Good job I had a backup!)

This was how life ended. And now it`s up to you to decide how life can start
again!!!
Donations will be taken at the following E-Mail address - please no flowers.

Thanks to you all, you are very kind!

I just thought perhaps someone on the amos-list might be slightly

Hi there! 

One of your fellow cyber-punks, Erik, got married to Anke on September
30th. 

Now he really hasn't got so much time left to travel trough cyberspace. To
compensate for this, why not send them your congratulations, so that
they'll find them when they return from their Honey-moon. 

E-mail addresses: 
Erik:  E.Gommer@ckskg.azu.nl
Anke:  ydv@oce.nl

I am doing nothing. I'm using the standard AmosPro "Reserve" and "Erase"
commands in my programs. I get these recoverable alerts when I either
run, test or save the program I'm editing.

  There are five of us... even if we only give 50% commitment each, that's
250%. :-)  Actually, we should be able to do much better as a team than
than anyone else would individually, and since most of us are extension
programmers, we already understand at least part of AMOS's internals.  And
I'm willing to commit as much to AMOS as I have to the Intuition Extension.

  No... I've already had some pressure for Intuition, so I'm getting used
to it.

Hi
  I'm a Amos programmer and was wondering if there is any new Amos 1.3
updates. I got my Amos 1.35 from a CUAmiga disk and got the 1.36 update
from a BBS and was wondering if there is any new ones higher than 1.36.

I have a problem with the tracker that is build into Amos. When I play
protracker 3.10b mods with it,it doesn't play it right as it suppose to
do. Can you help me please?????

Thanx for your time.

Hello,

       Can anybody out there give me some help with this little problem Im having?  

       The problem simply stated is that I am writing a 3d isometric walk around program (kind of like Heimdall 2 etc.).  I have created the basic building blocks ( wall partitions, and floor tiles) which I just want to paste down onto the screen then I can move bobs around on it.  Unfortunately the only way I could achieve this is by making the room up of Bobs on a first screen and then copying the screen onto another (using screen Copy) and then putting Bobs on top which Im sure you can appreciate looks messy to say the least.  Also the other problem is that walls etc (the bobs) sometimes fail to appear for some strange reason - has anybody else had this problem?

      If you can help me on either of these points then please contact me via the mailing list or by my mail address which is

muckleys@aston.ac.uk

      Thanks

      Stuart

Subject: Modem games
Status: RO

Hello everybody!

I have programed a two player game (Colonial Conquest II)
and people don't stop asking me for modem support.
There are two big problems though: First, I do not own
a modem which will make development of such a version
very difficult and second, I have NO idea how to program
such a thing.
The second problem is the reason for asking you all. Does
somebody here have experience with two player modem games?

I think I would have to work it out in the following
way:
1) The players have to start the program and the program will
ask each player if he's the number one or the number two.
2) At the end of turn of player #1, the game saves all variables
to a bank and sends this bank through modem to the player #2
where the bank is read. (The "bank" part is easy, as I have 
such routines for the save and load game command, but how do
I send the bank?)
3) In the meantime, player #2 has to wait until he gets the data.
Once they arrive, player #2 makes his turn. Then, the data
are sent back to player #1 and the evaluation of the players
moves is done on BOTH computers (which implies that the radom
generators need the same seed to yield exactly the same results
on both machines).

Will this be easy to program? Any ideas?

Thanks a lot!

	Chris

  Nope.  I might be if C= were still around.  Then again, I might become
one after someone else picks up the Amiga again.

  The source code, if I get it, will definitely be kept in a secure

Isn't this the idea behind ADT? To organize the updating of AmosPro
and prevent the thing that happened to some old version of Nethack,
ie. n^38 unofficial patches that partly fix the same bugs?

There's really not much I would like to see:
-AGA graphics 
-smaller compiled code (why should Hello_World take up 60 k?)

I have not encountered any of the bugs that others seem to 
experience and am very happy with AMOS as it is.

  I would instead write it so that the player who originated the modem
connection chooses whether he's the first or second player - this way
you don't have to worry about resolving conflicts where both people
want to play first.

  In theory, you just need to do a Serial Out on #1's end, wait for
the transmission to finish (Serial Check), then continue.  (I've never
tried it before, although I've given some thought to it.)  You should
also include a checksum with the bank, to make sure that the correct
data is sent and not corrupted.  A simple way of doing this is just to
reserve an extra 4 bytes at the end of the bank, then add up all the
values (one integer - 4 bytes - at a time) in the bank and store the
result in the extra location you reserved.  Then you'd have #2's side
reply with either a positive or negative response, indicating that it
either did or did not receive the data correctly (after calculating
the checksum itself and comparing the result to the sent checksum).

  If you're going to need a seeded random number generator (which you
will in this case) then you can't use AMOS's Rnd() function, since it
doesn't always return the same sequence of numbers for the same seed.
The one I posted a while back, which is also on the PLAYFIELD! WWW
page, will do fine.

Hmm, this seems to me as though you would be the only person responsible 
for Amos updates, and in a way it is good that one source would be 
issuing updates (no confusion in the Amos community about which version a 
fellow user has), but as I said in my last post, it would be better if a 
for-profit company took over Amos, I would prefer paying a nominal fee 
for updates rather than sporadic updates from a non-developer who really 
has no need to update the product other than self-motivation.
I also imagine that EuroPress would probably want a fee for the transfer 
of the source code to you.
BTW, the majority of people can spell, so it isn't amusing or interesting 
to correct spelling mistakes.

  As I said, there are several people who are part of the group I've
assembled.  Yes, I assembled the group, so I suppose you could look at me
as the one person who is responsible for development, but it won't be that
way - we'll all be working on it.  I also wouldn't be so hasty to say we'd
only update AMOS "sporadically" - besides, I'm sure you'll agree that
sporadic updates are better than none at all.

  You seem to imply that we'd be distributing AMOS for free - non-profit.
While we'll do this for minor updates, the same way that Europress did, we
don't know yet how we'll handle major upgrades.  It may be that we'll sell
it for profit.

  BTW, if you can find one software company that's willing to take on AMOS
*and* will update it regularly for as long as there is a demand, please
tell me.

>BTW, the majority of people can spell, so it isn't amusing or interesting

  Obviously you aren't one of them.  The word "rouge" is perfectly valid.
<flame mode off>  It could also lead to some strange misinterpretations,
if one is as demented as I am. :-)

I would give my right arm (or even maybe my left one) for an A1200.
My A500 is fossilizing before my eyes.

YES!

It's called AmosPro. 
AmosPro has an update that comes with the AmosPro compiler (update V2.0?)

Unfortunately, you'll have to pay "full whack" for AmosPro :(

I was wondering if anyone has run into these hits before?  Lionet had said that
he removed all hits, and I tested it and never had any.  Since then, though, I
have added newer extensions (Intuition, EME, EasyLife).

Any of you extension writers able to use enforcer?  Here are the hits.  The
last one happened when I QUIT AMOS Pro.

Enforcer Hit!  Bad Program!

The first 2 I was not able to tell what I was doing since AMOS won't let the

BTW, I was not using any commands from the mentioned extensions.  I was just

I am currently writing a game strategy game in AMOS similar to the game 
VGAPlanets (which is for Clones, obviously ;o), and I'm getting tired of 
the put downs AMOS gets.  Some people are so biased that as soon as they 
see the word AMOS, they already think it's bad (and some don't even let 
the program get farther than that).  On IRC, someone even created a 
special macro that as soon as someone types AMOS, it comes up with a 
nasty saying about it, and there's been a game lately where people just 
type AMOS to see the msg and laugh.

So here's what I suggest, AMOS fans: don't give people a chance to be 
biased.  Let them play your game/use your software, and only when they 
quit (after they've decided it's great [hopefully ;o)]) you mentioned the 
language that it was created in.

AMOS has gotten a really bad rap, much more than it deserves.  However, 
if we can get more positive exposure, maybe we can change at least SOME 
minds.

Thanks for taking the time to listen... uh, read ;o).

Check out the "TopHatWillie" game on aminet.. :-) Quite cool, and made in 
Amos.

Well Amos(Pro) deserves most of the bad reputation (it pisses on OS, has 
bugs, is slow etc). But Amos is easy and programming is fast, the editor 
is excellent (Pro) and the online-help rewlz :-) Too bad it always crashes...

Unfortunately, there is no natural selection concerning stupidity.
As you can see, the result is quite depressing sometimes, but
I would suggest to ignore it. You can't fight all stupid people.
There are too many.

I would be interested to hear other peoples opinion about this.
It's true that the sentence "written in AMOS" is a bad publicity
for many people. On the other hand, I guess that if somebody has
downloaded it from Aminet and brought it to his machine at home,
he won't be that crazy to switch off his computer at the time
he reads the message BEFORE giving at least a look at it!

However, one thing I can recommend to everybody here is NOT to
mention AMOS in the Aminet .readme files or in the announcement
on the net. Some people wrote me that they nearly didn't upload
my game because of this! I can imagine that others were more
consequent! :-(

One problem related to this proposal is if it's legal NOT to
mention AMOS at the start of the game. I can't remember if
it has been explicitely specified in the manual at which point
of the game it has to be mentioned.
(By the way: has anybody played "fleet" from Aminet? It doesn't
mention AMOS either!)

I'm quite confident that the image of AMOS could change as soon as
the development continues... and I'm quite confident about it as
I trust Andy 200%.
In addition to this, some of the best PD/Shareware games have been
written in AMOS. Sooner or later somebody will realize this.
(Unfortunately, some of the best PD/Shareware games have also been
written in Blitz!)

Greetings,

	Chris

Hey!
I just invented a new word!

			HELPHILE (instead of READ.ME, etc.)

Looks ok, don't you think?
	Damn. This hasn't got anything to do with AMOS.
		Sorry.

			(slap!)
				Flint.
PS I'm not good in remebering names (let alone faces, not to mention faeces)
   but who was it again who started working on AMOSPro? It was you who 
asked what ideas there were for improving AMOS...
  Hmmm. I now this sounds incredibly opportunistic, but anyway, here goes:
Perhaps you should include all the (official) extensions written for 
AMOSPro in the source. After all, extensions are written with the 
improvement of AMOS in mind, no? This, ofcourse, leads to the fact that 
money should be paid for such a drastic upgrade of AMOS (money, which 
could be split between the programmers of the extensions) 
I just read this over, and er... Don't flame moi :}  It's just an idea, 
and I _know_ it's not doable...
Oh, talking about extensions (rather Freudian word, now that I come 
(!) to think of it.) Ryan, it seems CU have stopped their tutorials on 
CRAFT II or TURBO v1 or whatever. The f*cks. Is there any way to know 
more about the commands in that extension?
  			Off again.

Subject: Shorter code?
Status: RO

Hello everybody!

Here are two questions for AMOS Pro users:

My game is just a bit too large to run on 
1MB Amigas. I guess I would just need 30 to 50 kB.

As I own Amos Creator v1.36, I was wondering if the
compiler of AMOS Pro did produce shorter code.
Can anybody tell me?

I was also wondering if AMOS Pro did allow the
use of 2-Byte Integers (instead of the standard 4-Byte
Integers). This point alone would save around 90 kB of memory!

Thanks in advance,

	Chris

PS: The compiled code alone is around 420 kB which is ridiculously
large. I'm sure that an equivalent code in C would need half
of that! (On the other hand, the source code would probably be
three times larger! ;-) )

Is this game gonna be a copy of VGAPlanets or your own version??

The reason I ask is;
Some friends play VGAP and I have sometimes joined in when they have a
VGAP day, with about 4 PCs in one house.

I quite like the game and would love to be able to join in on my Amiga.

So, I guess what I'm askin is;

Will your game be compatible with VGAPlanets??

Isn't VGAPlanet written in MicroStuffed QuickBasic??
I could have sworn that this was the case.

When I write stuff in Amos, I *never* admit to the fact that it's
written in Amos. *NEVER*
As soon as Andy Church's Intuition extention is complete, we
can baffle the non-believers with full Intuition support. And when
the Turbo (or whatever it's gonna be called) is complete, that should
give a nice speed boost.

All we need now is to get rid of the screen "flick" in workbench when
you launch an Amos program in the background.

Why are you so racist about Blitz Basic? Have you tried it?
I've seen many reviews about that language and all says it is a great
developing system.

It has many features that AMOS lacks such as complete multitasking(!!!)
and easy intuition support, while auto compiling and producing faster code.
I have also seen some little demo made with Blitz Basic and I have to say
AMOS will not be able doing that!

I am an AMOS programmer. I like it as it is simple and produce quite good
programs, but you have to understand it is not the best thing on this
world! It has many bugs, many problems and lacks many features which are
standard in other languages. More it has NOT AGA SUPPORT!

So why treating Blitz basic in this way?
If you are so good in programming with all-doing AMOS, why you don't write
a program such as SkidMarks?  

I'll be happy to see that AMOS can programs be compared to BlitzBasic ones.
I'm not saying ALL BB programs are better than AMOS ones, but surely the
same program made by the same programmer will look better with a faster
code, multitasking support and intuition handling! (ohh, I was forgetting
AGA graphic!)

  Theoretically, you have to mention AMOS unless your program is commercial
(I think).  But since Europress doesn't care about AMOS anymore, I don't
think it matters.

O damn, I wrote the answer and them I lost it pushing the wrong button :-(
Well, if you got your copy of CRAFT with CUAMIGA there is a HELP on the disk.
You can load it as an AMOS Pro accessory and then RUN it.
Turbo extension come with very good and complete docs.
You can find the 1.9 version on Aminet.

  The group includes me (author of the Intuition Extension), Paul Reece

to get the author of Turbo Plus (Manuel somebody-or-other) involved too.

  You're probably right, but some of the extension authors are on the
team, so some of their work may be included later.  (Bug-fixing comes
first, though.)

  Yes, it does.  In fact, I've only compiled one program so far that is

  No, but if you use a memory bank, you can use Deek and Doke.

Hi people!

I just thought I`d drop a few ideas onto you all! (Perhaps more towards Andy
:*)

I don`t know how Andy is going to go about developing AMOS, but why not make it
OS2.04+ only? And *FORGET* OS1.3, it really is *OLD* and *DEAD*!

I`m sorry if there are any 1.3 owners out there, but can you give me 1 good
reason why you won`t upgrade to a new machine? (I don`t want to hear financial
excuses!)

This would make it easier to integrate intuition into it etc. And it would be
more powerful.


Everybody complains about how hard it is to make AMOS programs not to look like
AMOS programs! Silly I know, but the mouse pointer is a DEAD give away!

And since AMOSPro V2.0 and up (what`s is the latest version anyway?) They
(Eurolazygits) incorporated the Mouse.ABK file into the AMOS.library, so now
you can`t change it! *WHY* the f*@!k they did this is beyond me!

Wouldn`t it have been simpler to have a command that made AMOS use the
*default* mouse pointer for the machine the program was running under? Or at
least have a way of editing it *PERMANANTLY* (I know you can just use an AMAL
driven sprite/bob etc.)

BTW: That reminds me - Andy, what plans do you have for AMAL? (Apart from a
complete re-write! :*)

	Regards, Mat

Trouble is, humans are a very prejudice species. Doesn't matter if the
program is Sierra Hotel, they will tend to look at it thru anything but
rose-tinted glasses if they know it's Amos before using it.
If you can get them to love it first, then drop it on them, they're less
likely to let their opinions cloud their judgment.

I'm gonna put some of my compiled utilities onto the Aminet and I will
not reveal the fact that it's written in AMOS apart from in the
"about" button in a utils. Maybe..

To everybody who wanted my IFF2ASCII program, it should be ready as soon
as I've worked around the mad frenchman's bugs ;(

You can write a program in Amos and not disclose the fact without 
problem. I believe that, if the program is commercial, you must
tell Europress who can disclose the fact to the media after 2 months
if they wish so.

As far as PD goes, there are no constraints (this include shareware, as
I wouldn't class this as commercial)

Beside, Europress have dropped Amos, so FUCK 'EM. They're a UK based
company, so they're hardly likely to sue. Now if they were based in
the US, well...  :)

   A GAME too large to run on 1MB Amigas? (I certainly hope you are not 
referring to Chip Mem.)  Maybe you should try to cut the code into 
shorter segments that can be loaded and executed seperately (Run, Prun, 
etc.)  I'm curious as to what kind of game this is, and how the code is 
handled.  Depending on how it works, you may be able to fiddle around 
with the size in other ways (tiling graphics, selective loading of 
parts, etc.)  It really is a good idea to try to keep your games playable 
on as many systems as possible... :)
   Oh well, thats the only input I can give, I dont have the ProCompiler

Subject:  1.36 Update DMS format
Status: RO

Hi,
	I just downloaded some stuff from Aminet which
is supposed to update my AMOS from v1.34 to v1.36.
	The files are amos136.DMS and acomp136.DMS.
	My only problem is that I am unfamiliar with the
.DMS extension.   I assume it is some sort of compression
format but I need to know what program I need (and where
it lives on Aminet) in order to extract them.

I don't think Amos uses OS2+ specific functions much ;-)
But IMO it's ok to do 2.0+ only (or even 3.0+ only!) software. Why should 
software be crippled in favor of the program being runnable on old, 
obsolete OS versions?

  That's certainly a possibility, once we begin adding to AMOS instead of
fixing bugs.

  Under AMOS Pro, the pointer looks exactly like the standard 2.x Intuition
pointer.  Change around color registers 17-19 to whatever you want.

  2.0 is still the latest version.

  None at the moment.  We'll take suggestions.

  That's easy enough - compile with the NODEFAULT and WB options from the
command line (or, for Creator users, "-s0 -w1").  There are probably
equivalent options in the Compiler Shell.

My own version.  No-one can get the source code to VGAP - beleive me, 
it's been asked.  If you can get the author to let me program an Amiga

I believe it is, which would make conversion relatively easy (I beleive). 
but as I said, it's unlikely to happen (I wrote the author once a couple 
years ago, and he didn't even bother to respond).

Yeah, turn it off and tell them it doesn't multitask :)))

This, I admit, is one of Amos' problems.
When I got AmosPro, I tries to alter the key combi to LAmiga-M, but
to no avail.

Maybe the new Amos Dev. team can re-write the whole code so that it
will work in harmony with OS???

You guys have certainly got your work well and truly cut out for you:)

Hello again.

Well, after several requests for this program, I`ve
uploaded it to ftp.funet.fi (on 11th October 1994).
Hopefully it`ll appear for downloading soon, though
please note that this is the first time I`ve uploaded
anything to the net. If something goes wrong, bear
with me.

Note: I would have uploaded it to one of the Aminet
mirrors (micros.hensa or ftp.doc.ic) in the UK here, 
but I couldn`t get the upload instructions from them.
Anyone help with this?

  I've never seen Blitz myself, but I do think that my Intuition commands
are easy to use. :-)  And what makes you say AMOS doesn't multitask?  The
only real difference between it and other programs is that you have to
press Amiga+A to switch between its display and Intuition's.  (Of course,
I'm completely discounting the fact that Francois Lionet is an incompetent
programmer... his "wait for event" commands were probably written with
busy-wait loops...)

  All of which are going to be added, later if not sooner.

  Some people (most people?) don't have the time and the assembler
experience to do so.  (From what I understand, much of SkidMarks was
written in assembler rather than Blitz.)

I can't remember the last program I wrote that didn't require more than 1 
meg, and pretty much everything I've written in the past year has 
required 1 meg CHIP and at least 1 meg FAST.  I'd rather have an 
excellent game that requires a better-than-stock machine than an average 
game that runs on a standard 500.  (See below :)

soapbox{

It's that kind of thing that has held back the Amiga for so long -
companies always pandered to the lowest common denominator, so there
wasn't such a demand for more powerful machines, a demand which may have
encouraged CBM to do a little more (i.e. SOME) development.  Look at the
clone market - the applications and games all require faster machines, and
the faster machines are consequently cheaper. 

However, now that CBM have gone belly up (and quite frankly, I'm no 
longer optimistic about the line ever being continued) it's too late to 
start forcing people to have larger machines, as there's none around.  A 
sad end to what could have been a glorious tale...  I'm now starting to 
learn my way around clones, as that's a platform that I can guarantee 
that people won't complain when I tell them it won't run on their XT with 
640K...

Make the first line of your program (after any Set Buffer commands)

Amos Lock

and Amiga-A is disabled.  Amos Unlock reverses the effect.

RTFM!

Change the damned syntax, and give us more registers.  (Is there any 
reason why it can't just be a Mini-AMOS-within-AMOS, with all the AMOS 
looping commands, Bob commands, Sprite commands, etc?  Just skip all the 
commands that aren't related to the sort of application AMAL is for...)

(But whatever you do, MORE REGISTERS!  :)

   Well from what I remember (if I'm wrong don't shoot me :), the AMOS 
manual specified that the words: 'This program was created using AMOS' 
and the AMOS logo must appear in any publically released program.  
   According to the AMOS Compiler manual, it was not necessary to include 
this in the program if Europress was notified that your program was 
created with AMOS.  They then reserved the right to release and use this 
information, two months after notification.
   I cant find ANYWHERE in the AMOSPro manual where anything like this is 
necessary.  I can only assume that this policy no longer stands for 
programs created in AMOSPro.

   As far as my personal opinion...  As an AMOS programmer, I like to see 
what products were created with AMOS, but I agree that specifying this 
information up front could be detremental to the product.  AMOS does have 
a bad reputation, and I'm sure many people wont bother with a product if 
they knew that it was written in AMOS before hand.
   I agree that a more subtle approach is necessary here.  Don't 
blatently specify this information right away.  If you are writing a 
game, shove it in the end credits.  This way, you can 'hook' people with 
the product itself, and then give them a bit of a surprise when they 
finally discover they have been thoroughly enjoying... AN AMOS PROGRAM!

   Just my two cents...

Hello there!

I don't know if my mail wasn't clear at all or if you
missunderstood me completely, but I would guess that I'm
probably one of the *least* "racist" people on this list:
I think that BB2 is better than AMOS for nearly everything
(namely, I agree with ALL of your points) and the only reason
I continue with AMOS is that I really like the way it is *VERY*
easy to program: The codes just look nicer to me! :-)

Now, as I didn't attack BB2 in my mail, you probably
missunderstood the "unfortunately" which meant: "Unfortunately
for AMOS programmers, some of the...". In other words: It's
not enough for AMOS programers to make good AMOS PD games
if we want more respect for AMOS. The games have to be *better*
to draw attention to them! (Wheither this is possible or not
is another discussion!)

Considering this, it's a bit disappointing for me to face so
much aggression I believe I didn't deserve:

For me it's simple. There are two options:
- (Bad Game)+(Written in AMOS)=AMOS a BAD language.
- (Good Game)+(Written in AMOS)=AMOS a marvellous language.
So: write good stuff. Never let them laugh at you. And if you're afraid 
people won't download it because the .readme says it's in AMOS then hit 
them in the face with it after they finished playing, toying,... (as 
-I-don't-know-who stated earlier.)
But I think you _should_ mention that it's written in AMOS. Never mind 
where, but just write it somewhere.(Not in the file comment though ;) 
Otherwise, AMOS'll never get the attention it deserves. Nobody'll know 
about its existence anymore.
Something else:
Nobody replied to my request for the Amiga Games List. Where should I 
subscribe to? Please.

There is a command to stop the Left-Amiga-A function, although this leaves=
=20
the Amos screen stuck in the foreground. A simple way around this problem is=
=20
to assign a different key combination, detect this and use this to call the=
=20
Amos Front and Back commands, remember your Amos program is still running,=
=20
even when it is at the back so it can still detect the keypress to bring it=
=20
to the front.

It is even possible to make the Amos screen behave as if it were a normal=20
intuition screen and cycle through the screens (including the Amos one)=20
using the normal gadget. Sadly this requires a clever trick which I am=20
unable to reveal since it is not one of mine!

Hopefully if Amos is developed by Andy's group then they will be able to=20
integrate it closer with intuition, however this would be a very hard task=
=20
to accomplish. Even if they get the source code, I don't imagine that it was=
=20
written with the view to anyone other than Francois working on it.

  I don't think 3.0+ only is such a good idea yet.  Maybe if/when the
A4000 and A1200 are re-released and become more common... but I don't
think too many people have them yet.  (I certainly don't - and I want
one!)

Hi,

.DMS means that the file is a "DiskMasher"  file. Where the whole disk
structure is compacted into one file. You then need a program called "DMS"
(really!) to unpack it to another disk.

I don`t know where DMS is on Aminet though. There have been quite a few new DMS
programs on cover disks of mags like: CU AMIGA / Amiga User International
lately, (one was actually programmed in Blitz Basic!)

About this "L-Amiga A" thingy:

You *can* change this so that it becomes "L-Amiga M/N" in the config somewhere
(AMOS Pro V2.00) but, because AMOS takes over the entire system, whenever you
use "L-Amiga whatever" it won`t cycle through the applications! Just between WB
and AMOS, so someone would still notice this!

Maybe he is suffering from the same problem as I do:

It seems that I do not receive all mail posted to the list.
So people who have asked me for favours, maybe I did not receive them.

I found this out when someone quoted another letter, that _I_ had not
read although it was sent to the list. Even worse:
I did not see MAD MAX's letter, until Flint quoted it! 

Imagine what would have happened if he did not quote it :( 

Any help?

Blitz is a real pig (No offence to any pigs reading this). The editor
is awful, and the manuals are no help at all. You would be better off
learning assembler.

I wasted good money on Blitz. At least I got AMOS Pro free!  :)

  Nope - when AMOS is in the back, it doesn't read any input.  (The exception
is whichever key you use for switching AMOS to the back and front, which is
read using interrupts.)

  Pessimist! :-)  But you're probably right - we may be better off
disassembling it and working from that.  Francois' code is probably
unreadable, if his programming style is any indication.

I agree.
I have OS 3.0, but I see there are not so many differnces between 2.04 and 3.0
to make only 3.0 software. Maybe some extension could have some commands
who takes advantages of the new staff included with the os 3.0 but the os 2.0
is still good enough to be supported.

Right. It's a file generated by Disk Masher.
I don't know what the latest version is but I'm sure you'll
find it somewhere, it's rather standard for packing whole disks.

I think the problem is that some people's mailreaders don't automatically 
reply to the group, just to the individual who posted the message.  Check 
the TO: line in your headers, and make sure it says

   Me too, Me too...! :)  But seriously I agree, with the state of things 
at Amiga Intl. I am too hesitant to buy an AGA machine right now (but I 
REALLY, REALLY want one ;)  I also don't think that 3.0 is common enough 
to follow a 3.0 only path.  So while I think making AMOS 2.0 only is not 
that bad (it's a big upgrade at a cheap price.), 3.0+ is best left as an 
extension.

   Oh yeah, In my post about trying to make a game fit on as many 
machines as possible... Didn't the original writer of the note say they 
only needed about 90k more than 1MB?  My response to keep things 
available to most computers was based on the fact that this game does not 
seem to need a signifigant amount of extra memory.  It is probably better 
to cut things down. (IMHO)
   I'd like to see programs that take advantage of extra memory and speed 
too (my 2000's got 1MB chip, 8MB fast, a 40Mhz 030 accelerator, and an 882 
FPU), but I still think it's nice to write for as many machines as 
possible.  Of course I'll admit, since I mainly use AMOS to whip up 
'quick 'n' dirty' programs on the fly for whatever needs to be done, I 
rarely practice what I preach :)

 Has anyone written a lunar lander game in amos?
 I'm trying at the moment, but would like to see anyone elses examples, so
 that I don't reinvent the wheel.
Additionally, I'm having a problem detecting a collision between a sprite
and a series of bobs that I've put on the screen using Paste Bob. Will
spritebob col detect this?

My opinion is that DMS is shit. The last OFFICIAL version of DMS was 1.11, 
and it had bugs, was slow, etc. The new versions (1.5x, 2.x) are all illegal.
DMS is not only slow, but it's inefficient... it's only good 
for NDOS disks like shit-trackloader-demos. For any GOOD software that 
comes on standard AmigaDos disks, DMS is worthless.

Avoid it. This trackload-stuff should have died before 1990...

I totally disagree...  Its more powerfull, quicker, easier to write 
system-friendly software and the support (so far) is far better than what
Europress offered.  I agree that the editor is quite bad, but it's being
worked on...

I have nothing against either language, but I personally think that this 
ISN'T the place to "flame" blitz (or amos)..  take that to alt.flame or
comp.sys.amiga.advocacy or something...

  Nope.  Paste Bob only draws the bob's *image* on the screen - it
doesn't actually create a bob.  If you're going to check for collisions,
you need real bobs.

You can't detect such collisions, because there aren't any.
Once you have pasted a bob, it becomes part of the background.
You'll have to check if the sprite has entered the area in which
you pasted the bob, but you can't do that with SpriteBob Col or
anything like that. Maybe you can solve the problem with Zones?

Nope - once a BOb has been pasted, it's just part of the screen, not a 
BOb...

I think that your problem is in using the Paste Bob command rather than
the  Bob command (Paste Bob draws the image into the background rather
placing the bob on the screen hence no bob to collision-detect with).

Jan,

I can vouch for that. I'm reading the list through CompuServe using
AutoPilot, which recognizes the individual as the sender. When I reply, it
goes directly to the poster. I had to originate this one and used
PowerSnap for the quote.

Neon hello's.
I got a very weird error in AMOSPro (2.0) yesterday night. I set my 
buffer to 450 and the dimension of A$ to 10000. (I was trying to make a 
basic sort of text reader; it meant to delete all those lines with 
"X-Terminal:",... in PC downloaded mail) Both Crossdos and its commodity 
were running in the background (on my standard A1200), together with 100K 
on RAM: disk and Ed. I started the proggy, AMOS sought access to my disk, 
the first line appeared and then ther came, in a AMOS Pro requester, 
something like: Programming error (and then something like :"This is 
fatal, shut me down or I'll explode ;) + two options "Suspend" and 
"I-cannnot-remember-what-the-other-one-was". I clicked on suspend and the 
machine Guru'd.
My A1200 is fairly new, and I think it's old already: 50% of my disks 
start getting RW errors when they're half-full. And I just don't get to 
make bootable disks (I know, not AMOS related (slap!)]: when I format a 
disk in Wb, I can't boot from it... Is this on purpose of what?
So two things I'd like to ask:
- "Programming error" Was Francois so modest to include a requester which 
should state that he's no good at programming? (I think he is, though he 
has his flaws)
- How can I know what Set Buffer command I should use? If, eg, I have a 
variable like A$(10000), what should my argument at Set Buffer be?

		Yours, in eternal debt,
					Flint.

He's French for-crying-out-loud!!! ;)
All the comments will be in code. Maybe Flint can help. His French is
probably better than mine (unless there's a French person on the list)

All the French are bothered about is eating good food, drinking lots of
alcoholic beverages, having smelly garlic breath and making sure British Lamb
can't flood their country. Oh. AND speaking French.

Apart from the food & drink bit, *bleeeuuuuuggh*

Voules-vous couche avec moi sur soir, madamouselle. (Terrible spelling,
I know)

BTW, the French are ok, I was only kidding !! (Apart from the Lamb bit, blood
farmers)

By happy,
G.

Oh dear, I am forgetting how to program in Amos already. What I forgot to 
say is that the keypress to bring Amos back to the front was detected by 
making intuition calls, which is not as frightening as it sounds. I know 
this is possible, I have a program written by a collegue of mine which uses 
a completely different key to toggle the screen to the front and back.

  Actually, you got the infamous "Software Error" requester - it's the
step before a Guru on KS 2.0 and above.  The two options were "Suspend"
and "Reboot".

  No - see above.

  Each element of an array (pointer or integer) takes up 4 bytes.  In
addition, each string requires two bytes plus its length (non-empty
strings only).  So you'd need 40k plus (if your lines are 70 characters
each) 72 bytes per line, for a maximum requirement of 760k (e.g. Set Buffer
760).  Of course, an AMOS string can theoretically hold 65534 characters,
but then you'd need about half a gig, which isn't usually available. :-)

I agree with Daniel here. I`ve experimented with DMS, XPK, LhA
and Powerpacker and DMS _always_ produces smaller archives
when asked to compress the entire disk contents, except when
I try using some of the more efficient XPK compressors like 
SHRI etc. However, a compression rate of 6Kb/sec. is not
my idea of fun. Given that DMS has never ever caused me any
problems, either on a KS1.3 A500 or my KS3.0 A4000, I`ll
stick with it until something better comes along.

Hi,
	Thanks to all of you for your help with my confusion
about the DMS formatted files.  My problem was that I
was looking in the util/pack subdir of Aminet and not the
util/arc.
	I have un-mashed the disk and have read the docs
which state that the only difference between the 1.34 and
1.36 versions is that the new version will allow you to use
an AA machine.
	Does this mean that this upgrade allows me to
program using a AA machine or that the programs I
write will run on a AA machine or both?
	Since I just have an ECS A3000 is it really
necessary for me to upgrade?  

					Still Confused,

If Blitz is so system friendly, then explain why all the Intuition
based Blitz progs I`ve seen cause problems on my WB3.0 A4000.
Things like not being font sensitive, grabbing a whole load
of processor cycles without appearing to do anything with them,
and crashing the system when I try to quit the prog.
I`m not saying every Intution Blitz prog has all these faults,
but I certainly can`t agree that Blitz allows programmers to
_easily_ create system friendly code. If it is so easy, why can`t
the programmers actually do it?

I`ve got nothing against Blitz, but I wish people wouldn`t go on 
about how AMOS is so crap and we should all switch to Blitz
instead. I like programming in AMOS. I also like programming in
Pascal, AREXX and assembler. It`s MY choice what language
I use for a particular task, no-one elses. If the end result works
then why should the language used be of concern???

Taken to the logical extreme, why not argue the case for
replacing every language with assembler, after all, if you
can`t do a task with an assembler program, you sure can`t
do it in any other language. This is of course a crazy idea,
but is hurling abuse at AMOS any less crazy?

  Just that AMOS will function correctly on an AA (AGA) machine.  It
*still* doesn't have AGA support.  (Yes, that's one of the first things
we'll add when we get to that stage.)

  Probably not.

Can anyone tell me how to uplad to the ftp sites?

I tried at ftp.doc.ic.ac.uk and tried to cd incoming,
but it said Permision denied, so I tried uploading to
the AMOS directory direct, but that said Permision denied
(upload)!

Please help!

Actually, what we are concerned about are the lambs that are coming from the
commonwealth (what a joke) and then send to UK and sold as if they were raised

To be honest, I have no idea..  Some problems are due to the programmer(s)
themselves though!!

Font sensitivity is up to the programmer!! - Not up to blitz2 itself!

Don't ask me..  I've had *NO* problems - And I also write new libraries 
for the language too..  (if you REALLY want to know, ask the 
programmers!! - acid@iconz.co.nz)

Well, what have you got to say about Blitz2 'Blitz' programs??

(ie. Skidmarks, Zombie Apocolypse, Defender, Roketz etc..)

Can AMOS manage games like that EVEN with the likes of TurboPlus etc?

I'm *NOT* saying that AMOS is crap - if it was, I wouldn't be in ADT or I 
would not be updating/writing EME...

Blitz2 is just a good way to write faster, (and smaller) code with MORE
commands..

AND I'M *NOT* telling you to switch!

Subject: The need for "Respect for Amos" messages + introduction dvf
Status: RO

Hello everyone,

Part 1

I've been a member of this group for a few week now and usually get 
interesting information. But to explain the title of this mail: I think 
there is no need to do comparisons between Amos and Blitz or any other 
language.
Amos has it's advantages and disadvantages and so has Blitz, Amiga-basic 
(aarghh!) and every other letters. It's getting a bit boring to read(and 
delete) all those lousy mails about this lousy subject. It's better to 
write some mail about how to improve Amos (pro), programming 
examples/problems, etc. than this waste of time. Who agrees?

Part 2

As I said in part one, I've been subscribed to the Amos-List for a few 
weeks now, so it might be time to introduce myself to you all out 
there. I'm a Dutch electrotechnics student, got an amiga 5 years ago. 
Since (+/-)three years I've been programming in Amos.
I'm not programming the usual stuff {games/utils (very good things to 
program :) }but I'm developing programms to control a modell-train 
track(Marklin Digital). I'm one of those people who plays with small 
trains ;) . Perhaps there's someone else who has the same hobby. 
I'm working on version 4, using the Amos-Pro Interface. The program 
displays the track on screen. Using the mouse I can control trains, see 
where trains are using blocks, etc. 
Anyone who is interested just ask. Maybe I'll upload a demo to Aminet 
sometime.
QUESTION: Is it possible to use the Amos-Pro Interface with the 
available Intuition-Xtensions?
Keep up the good work, 

Fred van Dijk

Sorry, I thought there had been at one time. I must be confused. I could 
have *sworn* I once uploaded something to /new at src.doc..

Well, I've noticed a few files missing at src.doc that are on the other 
Aminet sites. Mind you, I don't need the Aminet so much now that I've got 
it on CD-ROM :-)

AMOS 1.36 came with a program called "ProcedureLock" or something which 
did just what you want, but I've experienced a few problems trying to use 
it with AMOS Pro.  Anyway, you ought to be compiling stuff! :)

It's true that there is an Procedure Locker, anyway there is another
program available since years called Procedure Unlocker. You will
guess that locked procedures are not really the right choice to
keep things secret. 
Better: Compile it and include an compiled procedure in your program!

Yes, the UK Aminet site (Imperial College, London, otherwise known as 
src.doc.ic.ac.uk) is a bit confused at the moment. There should be a 
"new" directory in the /pub/computing/systems/amiga directory, but there 
isn't. Goodness knows why. *And* it isn't a complete mirror of Aminet, 
either. 
I suggest that you upload to an alternative site.. ftp.funet.fi and 
ftp.uni-paderborn.de are two sites that I've found to be pretty fast from 
the UK.
 Do you know the procedure for uploading?

Hello Christian,
		The following message is from my oldest son.
His main interests (in computing) are AMOS and games like
"the Settlers" (with or without null-modem).
His message:

     I'm interested in Colonial Conquest II.
     I found Colonial Conquest I (on the Aminet III CD) and
     my friend and I really like it very much ! 
     Can you please send me Colonial Conquest II ?
     I also heard that you have an Editor for ColConq II ?

     I have also a list of things you could implant in Colonial Conquest:

     KernFusion Plant - Not split atoms (nuclear plant) but combine them
     Antimatter Plant - Use antimatter (as in Star-Trek)
     Wave power Plant - Use the waves to generate power 
     Spacestation     - Sort of limited planet :
                        * travel slow 
                        * small compared to planet
                        * you can build ships there, greenhouses, 
                          power plants and city complexes 

     Warn if a Collector isn't economic (produce only 1 or 2 power signs) 

     If you want to know how to send a bank with the serial port in AmosPro
     then ask for it. (I don't know if you have AmosPro) 

     Mark de Jong

That was the message. So mail me if you still want to know how to send a bank.

Best regards,
               Joop de Jong.

  They have been getting a bit out of hand, but there are uses for
comparisons - if, for example, someone says that Blitz Basic has some
function that AMOS doesn't, then perhaps that function can be added
to AMOS.  Besides, the thread began with the legitimate question of
how to get more respect for AMOS - i.e. how to show other people that
AMOS can produce programs of high quality.

  No - the Interface language only works with AMOS screens.  You
can, however, set up windows with gadgets which will act the same
way.

I must agree with what was mentioned before ... I wouldn't recommend 
using the locked procedures program, because it isn't 100% as I have 
written a program that will totally de-protect all locked procedures. The 
original locking procedure program that came with AMOS doesn't work with 
AMOSPro unless you modify it a bit, not a whole lot, you just have to 
call it as a subroutine from within your program then delete the line of 
code that calls/and performs the locking. I have heard of another 
Unlocking procedure program before in a Euro magazine and couldn't find 
it in the US so I wrote one myself and it works perfectly.

I wish I could figure how to get the Trojan LightGun Driver for AMOS to 
work with a Sega Lightgun (The original Sega system before the Sega 
system with the CD-ROM, the one that used those little cartridges) anyone 
have any idea's ?

OK, so it`s not so easy to write system friendly stuff in Blitz then

I don`t own Blitz so I didn`t know this. Even so, how difficult
is it for a programmer to at least use Topaz in their window title
bars, gadgets, menus etc. rather than assuming everyone
has Topaz (or equivalent sized font) as their selected font.

Are you saying you write code using the OS directly?? If this
is the case then you shouldn`t have any problems writing OS
legal programs in Blitz. The point is, what about people with
no OS knowledge who want to write programs, can they
use Blitz without having to understand the workings of the OS
in any detail???

>Well, what have you got to say about Blitz2 'Blitz' programs??
>
>(ie. Skidmarks, Zombie Apocolypse, Defender, Roketz etc..)

First the good:

Defender is really very good, and it has a permanent place
on my hard drive. Zombie Apocalypse I recall being apparently
well programmed, although I wasn`t that keen on the game itself.

No comment about Roketz, as I haven`t seen it.

Now the bad:

Skidmarks. Oh dear. First off, the hard drive installation
is a joke. Secondly, why does my 4Mb Amiga have to
keep reloading the AGA car graphics inbetween races, can`t
the program use a RAMDisk?
Thirdly, during races the car graphics occasionally distort.
When it occurs, it looks like the car image is replaced by a
random chunk of graphics memory. Usually this only lasts for
a frame or two, and occurs most often when the race ends and
the cars drive past the score board.
Fourth, where`s the support for multiple floppy drives????

I`m sorry, Skidmarks may be impressive due to it`s Blitz
origin, but there are too many badly thought out parts of
the design to make it a shining example of programming
in general, especially for a commercial release.

>Can AMOS manage games like that EVEN with the likes of TurboPlus etc?

I don`t know, I`m not into writing games. On the other hand, is Blitz
as friendly as AMOS when it comes to creating programs? Not just
the editor interface, but the whole language structure and syntax?

Following on from my attempt to upload this

Also thanks to Paul Hickman for accepting the

ARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!
 (sorry I had to get that out of my system)
 (Blitz is starting to look tempting- or maybe even C)

I'm using the paste bob command to construct a 'line landscape' for a lunar
lander game I'm writing. I orginally used the 'draw to' command, but then
discovered that there is no way to detect if a sprite or bob collides with
the background.

Now I find out that there is no way to detect if a collision occurs with
pasted bobs! Arrrrrgggggggg! This is not in the manual! 

Using the point command to detect colours is no good, as the lander can end
up half way through the 'landscape' before the collision routine is called.
Trying to point all around the lander is silly.

Is there an extension that might help (If not, there is an idea for the
extension coders!), if so what one????

If not, anyone got any other ideas that may help. The lander is a bob (a
lot of colours) or a line drawing bob -user selectable.

Hmm, odd this but my reply to FLINT got lost somewhere and never seems to

Anyway, he had a problem with formatting disks in WB and then not being 
able to boot from them. Now it might seem like a stupid question, but is 
he 'INSTALL'ing them after he formats them?

That is because if you paste down a bob you are only pasting down its image,
not placing a bob on the screen.

You are correct that it is not explicitly stated, but it also states that
the paste command draws the bob into the background and does not imply that
it places a bob down like the 'bob' command does.  You should look at the 
'bob' command as it will do what you need.

No extension needed, look in your manual for the 'bob' command and use it
in place of the 'Paste Bob' command and all will be well.

The bob command is of the form: Bob bob_num, x_pos, y_pos, image_num
(or something like that).

A sticky problem, this bob-colliding-with-the-background thing.  You'd 
probably be best off picking a few strategic points on the lander (the 
feet, the centre, and a few points at the top) and doing a Point() at 
each of them, OR...

Carry on as you have been doing, but plot the bobs directly below and to
the sides of the lander, and testing for collsions with them.  (I'm
assuming your landscape is made up of tiles, seeing as you're drawing it
with Bobs anyway.)


Kinda like this.  (. is background stuff, X is the lander, and ! is a 
background-replaced with Bobs bit.)




                                    X

.........  ...       ........  ....        ....

I didn't explain it very well, but you get the idea.

(Alternatively, do the whole thing with vectors and stuff...)

   Not really.... it still has to slap all its 'main' routines into the
executable... but there is a library option to use a library to save
on this... ( but that would be admitting to using amos :) )

	ya... speed.  Essentially amal operates on the same principle
as microcode for contoilling primarily cisc processors.  Amal is like
a mini-language in a language where as microcode is like a mini-processor
in a processor... it is in that syntax because it is it's own language...
it is a simpleand a little krazy because Amos is executing this mini
program every N vbls... you can think of it like writting a simple
assmebly language and specifying the architecture of the processor 
(ie. PC, SR, registers) and then just exec the program just like the
processor does.. read from PC, decode INS, inc PC, etc etc.. so you 
could desing your own 'amal' type program with amos.. just use the
Every On cmd to give you your intterupt then in this interrupt for
example just simulate the way your processor executtes code on your
own 'amal' program... if you do this you will see why Amal's language
is pretty simple and basic just like an assembly language is.


> (But whatever you do, MORE REGISTERS!  :)

	This I agree with... I don't know the inner workings of amal but
  I would hope that it doesn't save/restore registers on a context switch
  between programs.. because this wouldn't maketoo much sense...

Email Nigel Critten at ncritten@cix.compulink.co.uk and ask him about
his Sticks2 extension.

While you're at it, ask him why he hasn't joined the amos-list yet!

It's never easy to write system friendly code, in Blitz or anything else.
Unfortunatly, in AMOS it is impossible.

This has nothing to do with its origins.  Alien Breed lacks multiple drive
support, and it certainly isn't a Blitz Basic game.

Blitz isn't as friendly as AMOS by any means, its more powerful.  Does that
make it better?  Well, it depends on ones programming ability and the task
one is trying to accomplish.  For the beginning programmer, AMOS would 
certainly be the better choice.  For someone who has mastered AMOS and wants
more than AMOS has (like Intuition support), but isn't ready for the likes
of C - Blitz would be a good thing to take a look at.

Talking about collision problems:

if you create a bob or sprite using AMOS spite editor or
 by using "GET BOB" command, whatever shape it has, AMOS treats it
like a rectangular box. (you can see this using "MAKE MASK" command).

so lets assume that we have two bobs with circle shape.
we want to detect collision between them.

AMOS detects collision without bobs touched!!
when their rectangular zones met each other AMOS believes that this is 
collision!
this is really happened when you approach the one bob with the other 
from  beneath and from left to right.

like the following diagram:
                                    ---------------
                                    |      @      |
                                    |     @@@     |
                                    |    @@@@@    |
                              ------|---  @@@     |

                                   @@@ | 


this is collision for AMOS...

			anyone who can help me?

                             george.

Ps:   I work with an old Amiga500 with 1mb +external FD and using Amos 1.36.

ps2: where can I find all the beautiful extensions you talk about?`

                           thanks

Hi!

I haven't received anything from Amoslist for three days, whats the problem?
Has somebody accidentally removed my name from the list or something?

I myself have send 3 emails recently to the list but haven't received them 
back yet, so there's definetely something wrong, or is the list just "lagging"?

Please, if somebody reads this, email to me (I could at least know that
my email is going through)!!!! Thanks!

No you are not alone.
Here I am.
If it is all right you should receive two copies of this messages.
One personal, and one from the list.

Maybe they are developing something and have no time ;-)

There were problems with the hardware where the list is stored.  It was to
be fixed on the 18th, but 3 days later, it is finally fixed.  So, if you
receive this message, then all is well.

Sorry for the problems.

Hi again.
I'm the one who couldn't get AmosPro working and got recoverable
alerts (error 0100 000F) all the time.

The problem seems to be program-specific.
Whoever it was who was fixing Amos, email me and I'll send you the source 
so you can check what causes the problems. The program only uses 
AmosPro's standard extensions, does not contain machine code banks, etc. 
I can't trace the problem with the Amospro monitor.

Well, my first mailing on this subject seems to have
been lost in the black hole that was the list up to a
few days ago...

However, since then I`ve got new news, so I`ll repeat
the original news and add the new bit on as well.

Firstly, Amiga Format have mentioned that they will be
carrying AMOS Pro on a future coverdisk. All they said,
in their subscriber newsletter, was that they had AMOS Pro
available for a future disk, nothing more.


Now, the second bit of news is this. The NEXT issue of
Amiga Computing (that`ll be the issue released in November)
is supposedly going to have Easy AMOS on the coverdisk.
This was actually stated in the "What`s in next month`s issue"
page, so it`s fairly likely to be accurate, unless there are any
last minute problems, like when Amiga Format promised
Real 3D and we got Imagine 2 instead (but hey, problems like
that I can live with :-)


So, for all of you wanting to get a new version of AMOS, just
wait around, and your wishes will be granted.


Good to see the list back on its feet, my mailbox was really
looking a bit empty without it.

Subject: serialhandling
Status: RO


earlier today i've send this message;

could anyone explain something in amos pro?

i've been working on a couple of things that access the serial port.
in the serialport handling amos pro uses 'channels' ...
what the ... are they ?
the 'manual' only mentions them and 'forgets' to elaborate ...
( has anyone ever counted the number of "if you do not know exactly what
you are doing, do not use this command"-explanations in the so-called
userguide, what do they think a manual is for??? )

anywayz... the problem is this;
i tried controlling my modem from within the script. works fine as long as
i use channel 2, try and use a differend channel and the modem does not
respond ( yes, i did open that other channel, just like i had opened and
setup channel 2 )
last week i was trying a couple of things involving midi...
same thing; i can receive midicodes from my dx7 through channel 0 ( loadza
$FE's ), but sending them through that channel seems to be interpreted
as nil: ...
both my dx7 and my sampler ( the latter one has a midi-page, so you can
see what it receives ) keep insisting they did not receive any midi data.

my guess is that it has something to do with the channel-stuff ...
but, as said before; the manual didn't help in this ...
is it an amos-peculiar-type-a-thing this channel-stuff or is it
amiga-specific ? i speed-checked some c-manuals about serial-handling, but
i could not find any refference to 'channels' ...

thanx a mill...

rene

but i forgot to mention;
please reply through my private address as i am not subscribed to the list
( yet )
thanx

I don't think there will be any problems like that, seeing as AC is

Actually, what makes Blitz Basic faster than Amos??
I've tried Blitz (well once) and found it disgusting;
the editor was crap!

Well, my friend has written a fractal cloud generator in Amos and
then he experimentally converted it into blitz basic and...
(fanfare, drum roll)

THE AMOS VERSION WAS FASTER!!!!

He used Amiga 1200 with fast ram in both tests.

Sure you can make fast code in Blitz... no prob to me,
but forget the damn multitasking! In my opinion all
multitasking progs should be written in 680x0 machine code
so the system won't slow down dramatically when several tasks
are run.

Again, my friend made a simple program to test integer calculation speed.
I haven't seen the code, but he told me it looks something like this:

A=10000:B=5:C=5   <- i dunno the exact values
FOR T=1 TO 1000000
  A=A+B
  A=A-B
  A=A*C
  A=A/C
NEXT


uncompiled program in amos took about 350 seconds on A1200,
compiled blitz program 130 or so and
compiled amos program 30 SECS!!!

The channels are crap, reminds me of Amigabasic.
My only advice is to use Serial XXX commands or LSerial extension's.
Lserial is shareware and made by a swedish dude, Niklas Sjoberg.

Why not add a raster plane system to Amos ???
It would dramatically reduce the time spent in blitter operations...

For those who don't know the rasterplane system:

Normally bitplanes are stored in memory like this:

   ------------  
   ! plane 1  !
   !          !
   !          !
   ------------
   ! plane 2  !
   !          !
   !          !
   ------------
   !          !
   .          .
   .          .

So if you blit a bob to the screen you have to copy each plane seperately
like this:

   wait for the blitter to finish
   blitcopy plane1
   wait blitter again
   blitcopy plane2
   wait blit
   blit copy plane 3
   and so on

But in raster mode the screen is stored in memory like this:

   -----------------------------------------
   !  plane 1  !  plane 2  !  plane 3  !
   !           !           !           !
   !           !           !           !
   -----------------------------------------

The difference is that now you can actually blit a bob (or icon or anything)
with only *one* blitter operation by choosing a modulo of plane width in
bytes and multiplying the height of the operation with the number of planes.

You have to do only one big blitting instead of several small blits,
but one big operation is actually faster becoz you don't have to wait
every blit in a busyloop and in a big blit the CPU can do something when
the blitter is doing the copying.

Thought all the drawing routines should be rewritten there should
be about 50% (or more, just a guess) speed increase.

At least this should be worth to test... (this is a common trick
in assembly games and demos)

Maybe somebody else has thought about this too???

I have already sent this mesg last week but due the list probs.
you haven't seen it, so here's the mesg. again:

Hi!

Well, several weeks ago I reported of a floating point bug and eh,
the example which ought to have caused problems didn't!

Actually one of my (many ;)) friends told me about the bug he had
discovered.
I decided to add it to my bug list (which I send to the Amos list also)
without checking anything (how stooopid!).

After finding out that the example did work perfectly well I contacted
him (my friend, who by the way don't have internet/email access)
and he told me to try these:

A=Sqr(12345)/20       OR    A#=Sqr(12345)/20
A=123456/Sqr(12345)   OR    A#=123456/Sqr(12345)

Becoz I've sold my Amiga recently, I cannot try that myself, so could
somebody try those for me, please?

The problem is occuring only when the above line(s) are compiled (with Pro 
Compiler) and then only occasionally(!).
Please compile the program several times and check the
printouts (remember to add Screen Opens and Prints ;)) )
My friend told me that the results vary which should not happen of course..

The problem can be (at least he told) removed by adding a "A#=0" line at
the very beginning of the program.

Hi Everyone.  I've finally gotten an e-mail address, and I am please to
discover the Amos mailing list!  I hope we can all share our questions and
experiences.

So let me start with a question:

I was thinking the other day about Pinball Illusions, and how their ball
handling routines are so realistic.  Hell, the entire pinball machine is
realistic.  Does anyone have any ideas, or has anyone experimented, with a
pinball simulator in Amos?  I'd really like to hear your ideas.

Thanks!

Ok, now I got it! :)

Thats pretty tricky you know... as the icons are pasted by blitter (or
CPU if special turbo command is used) and the width has to be a multiply
of 8 in such operations, sure you can mask the blitter d-channel (output)
but isn't easy in amos. Maybe you should save the panel background before
pasting the icons and restore them back after pasting.

I would like to suggest that perhaps someone could come up with a 
mechanics/dynamics extension for amos so that for example, gravity, 
inertia, momentum, etc could be easily applied - I am presently designing 
the basics of a Clay Pigeon simulator and such extension commands would 
be of great value to me eg defining a Gravity vector at the start of the 
program.
Anyone else think that this would be useful - it certainly would be for 
pinball.

Well, it seems it's not _that_ tricky, for I'm sure the command exists in 
the standard version of AMOSPro. And if it's so tricky while using the 
blitter, then why, oh Ryan and the rest, isn't it implemented in Turbo 
(for that uses the CPU) ?

(Ofcourse, it could be that I'm horribly mistaken ;) I'l check this out 
at home)

  What clipping does is prevent any drawing from occurring outside the
region specified as the clipping region.  Any graphics drawn outside the
region simply get ignored.

  Cls can be limited to one section of the screen with the syntax
Cls pen,x1,y1,(x2+1),(y2+1).  Note that the lower-right coordinates
of Cls must be one greater than the actual coordinate values.  (Yes,
this is a bug.)

Hi ya`ll

Has anyone else discovered a bug with the "Get Block / Paste Block" commands?

Because I had loads of problems with it when I was using it to temporarily
store the underneath of a "System Requester" when I was faking intuition
requesters.

The basic structure of the code was:

	Copy the part of the screen in question.

	Draw "Requester" onto the screen.

		Do user input routines (button clicking etc.)

	Quit loop, and paste the block back at the original coords. (Remove
requester)

This should be fine. But when I paste it back, the requester is there but there
is an extra piece around the bottom and right hand sides of the requester!?!

WHERE does this come from?

It doesn`t happen if I plonk the block at 0,0. But it screws up the more I go
across and down the screen. (And no I don`t have a "growing" grab routine!)

Any ideas?

I resorted to using the EXACT same coordinates system, but with "Screen Copy"
for cutting / pasting the blocks. And that worked perfectly! But it means that
I have to have two screens open!

	Regards, Mat.

  It sounds like you've got the syntax wrong.  The syntax for Get Block is:

Get Block n,x,y,width,height

If you try using coordinates (x2,y2) instead of width and height, you'll get
exactly the situation you describe.

I think it's something to do with Amos' amazing 16 pixel round-up technique.
Although, you think that you've grabbed a block the correct size, if you
are less than one of the 16 pixel points, it will round down to the lower
16 pixel point. Thus, you are left with a block which is a few pixels
too short.
In your case, it seems Amos is rounding UP and grabbing more than it should.

What is it with Amos and 16 pixel boundaries??

Ya know what I hate??

I hate the way that the screen display command only allows 16 pixels
increments.

You can spot an Amos screen a mile (or km) off, cuz the screen is always
shifted either left or right of the WB screen.

F**kin' Franios. Pig, traitor and all round bad programmer.
