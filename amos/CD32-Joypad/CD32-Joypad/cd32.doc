Well, shows you how to read the CD32 joypad from amos.  You'll need to have
the 'lowlevel.library' of course..

I'd like a credit in your code, but it doesn't really matter.  A mention on
the back page of the docs maybe ?  An email would be nice though.  Feel free
to make the code a lot more usefull..
