   ADB's Games Volume 2
  **********************

   Thanks for downloading this off of Aminet.net (or wherever you got it
   from). Games Volume 2 has been split into 2 disks - one contains
   BLIAM! and Simple Art 2004, whilst the other contains AMOS music files
   for use with Simple Art 2004. 



   Copy the files as they are to run Simple Art 2004 from the harddrive.
   Unfortunately, due to a slip-up on my part, BLIAM! will only run from
   disk - read on for further details and a complete file list.


   All the following files should be on a disk, called "Games_Vol2",
   which must be inserted into drive DF0 (internal 3.5" DD drive).
   Do not forget to install the disk (go to execute command in workbench
   and type "install df0:") before copying the files across or it won't
   auto-boot from startup. You can click on the icon files to start
   BLIAM!, Simple Art 2004, or the Intro file from workbench.

               Simple_Art_2004



   The following files must be on a disk called "AMOS_Music". This disk
   doesn't have to be installed as it only contains AMOS music files for
   use with Simple Art 2004. 



   AMOS_Music:Amosteroids_Title.abk

   To help ease things, they are contained within the relevant folder in
   this archive. I have also decided to include all the source files
   relating to both BLIAM! and Simple Art 2004. Here's a list of all
   the source files contained within the relevant folder in this archive:


   AMOS_sourcefiles/ADB's_Games2_intro.AMOS
                    BALL_GAME_VER5.AMOS
                    BLIAM_game2.AMOS
                    BLIAM_intro.AMOS
                    fileselectorVER2_ADB.AMOS
                    SIMPLE_ART2004_intro.AMOS
                    SIMPLE_ART_animintro.AMOS
                    SIMPLE_ART_ver2_final.AMOS



   I hope you download my other games and software which will be uploaded
   to Aminet.net soon.
