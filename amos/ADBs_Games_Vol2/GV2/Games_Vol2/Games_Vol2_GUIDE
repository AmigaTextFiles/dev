@node Intro "ADB`s Games Volume 2 - Introduction"


      This is my 2nd games release for the Amiga - though perhaps
      misleading since Simple Art 2004 is, obviously, not a game.
      However, I hope you do enjoy playing BLIAM! and solving the
      puzzles, aswell as creating cool pictures using Simple Art 2004.

      My first games release also included 2 games - Alutia`s Jewels
      and Breaker.
      Alutia's Jewels was my first game I made for the Amiga and is a
      simple maze game where the aim is to work your way through to
      get to the Jewel at the end of each stage.
      Being my first game, made back in 2003, it has no sound (!) and
      very simple graphics. This got me hooked on programming again and
      shortly after finishing this (and after my brother moved out) I
      was able to start work on my 2nd game, Breaker.

      Breaker is a clone of a game that was found in the back of my
      Spectrum 128K manual, called Bustout.
      A very simple game at heart, all you do is move the bat to keep
      the ball in play and destroy the bricks to score points. Once
      the target score has been achieved you were able to move on to the
      next stage (of which there are 15) by pressing the relevant key
      on the keyboard or by letting the ball go out of play.

      This is my first (and only) game so far to feature a working
      scoreboard, which is saved onto the disk. Also hidden away is a
      file that stores your total game time (up to a maximum of 999
      days, 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds!) which was inspired
      by a similar stats feature included on many of Sega`s Saturn
      games.

@node BLIAM! "ADB`s Games Volume 2 - BLIAM!"

      Work on BLIAM! began back around Sept/Oct 2004 and was to be my
      3rd piece of software written using AMOS for the Amiga. This game
      turned into something slightly different to what I had planned,
      but either way it was to be a puzzle game.

      This is my first program to feature music by myself aswell as a
      cool piece of music by M. Brown (aka SPADGE). My music skills
      are fairly limited, but not bad for my first attempt! Hopefully
      my composing skills will get better with time.

      I originally planned to make 50 levels, but after 4 months of
      solid development (and some programmers block!) I found that
      most of the new levels I had designed were too similar to those
      already in the game. If you want more levels feel free to @{"contact" link ContactMe}
      @{"me" link ContactMe} requesting more levels - perhaps throw in some suggestions and
      get your name in the credits!

      After fixing a few bugs and re-writing the code to optimise speed
      BLIAM! was finally finished by 31st December 2004.

@node SA2004 "ADB`s Games Volume 2 - Simple Art 2004"

      Simple Art 2004 (SA2004) was, surprisingly, originally written
      early in 2004 and was only for my personal use.

      However, the file selector was no more than an INPUT command and
      there was no way of viewing files already on the disk (or the
      harddrive) and a few other things needed improving too.

      I had hoped to have the improved version of SA2004 finished by
      the end of February 2005, but I kept on finding bugs which needed
      fixing.

      With the addition of a few features and having improved it I felt
      that I could include it on this disk for others to use. I realise
      that it doesn`t have many of the features that professional art
      packages have, but it was only meant to be a simple art program.

      Although it is just an art program, I have included the option
      to load in AMOS (.abk) music bank files. Since there isn`t
      enough space on this disk for some music files for you to use
      I have included an extra disc which contains all the AMOS music
      files I currently have on my harddrive - my favourite ones.
      Most, if not all, are by M. Brown (aka SPADGE) and not myself
      sadly - though I have used them in my own games until I can
      write some decent music :)

      Feel free to @{"contact me" link ContactMe} with suggestions on how it could be
      improved and you may just find your name on the credits of
      Simple Art 2005 (which may not be finished until 2006!).

@node Install "ADB`s Games Volume 2 - Installing on to a harddrive"

      Sadly, when I wrote BLIAM! I did not make it so that it could
      run from a harddrive. If I make a new version of this game it
      will (as will all future programs from me) be made to run from
      either harddrive or from disk/s.


      Simple Art 2004 will happily run on a harddrive - though if any
      files have been misplaced or deleted (excluding "SA2004_shortcuts")
      a message will appear asking you to insert this disk.

      To install onto a harddrive simply:


         1) Select where you wish to store SA2004 and name the
            directory (or drawer) appropriately (eg. "Simple_Art")

         2) Copy all 4 files into the directory, ensuring that
            "SA2004", "SA2004_ldscrn.iff" and "SA2004_shortcuts"
            are placed in a sub-directory called "SA2004_SYS".

         3) Check the files are in the right place:-

            ~....../Simple_Art/Simple_Art_2004
                               SA2004_SYS/SA2004
                                          SA2004_ldscrn.iff
                                          SA2004_shortcuts

         4) If you have successfully followed steps 1-3 and you have
            problems getting it to run then @{"contact me" link ContactMe}.

@node Bugs "ADB`s Games Volume 2 - Bugs / Problems"

      Hopefully after weeks of testing, neither BLIAM! nor Simple Art
      2004 should have any bugs.

      However, in the unlikely event that one slipped through, or that
      you are having difficulty getting either program to run on your
      Amiga, please @{"contact me" link ContactMe} with as much information as possible.
      Try to include the error message along with details of what you
      were doing, what Amiga you are using and whether it has been
      expanded in any way - I only have an expanded Amiga 600 so it`s
      hard for me to test for problems on other machines.


      BLIAM!
      ------

      In the unlikely event that the file "BLIAM!_stats" has become
      corrupt, you can delete it and a new file will be created after
      you have played the first level (it doesn`t matter whether you
      succeed or fail).


      Simple Art 2004
      ---------------

      In the unlikely event that the file "SA2004_shortcuts" has become
      corrupt, you can delete it and a new file will be created
      once Simple Art 2004 has loaded - you need to start drawing an
      image and it will create the new file as part of the setup routine.

@node AboutMe "ADB`s Games Volume 2 - About Me (Andrew D. Burton)"

      I am (currently) 25 years old with a long history of playing
      games across many formats, including Nintendo`s Donkey Kong
      Game & Watch, various table top electronic games, most of Sega`s
      machines and an Amiga CD32.

      I started programming on my Spectrum 128K when I was about 12
      years old (in the early 90`s), but being young (and new to any
      kind of programming language) most of my efforts were rather
      poor - which was not helped by the fact that there were no sprite
      commands in Spectrum BASIC!

      In 2001 I acquired @{"my Amiga 600" link MyAmiga600} along with a boxfull of disks and
      various other bits & pieces. I did get into AMOS back then but it
      was mostly for fun and with 500 commands to learn it wasn`t going
      to be easy!

      Last year I was lucky enough to get my hands on a 4GB harddrive,
      a 2MB PCMCIA card and 1MB of internal RAM (which fits into the
      trapdoor underneath the Amiga). All of which were fitted by myself
      onto my beloved Amiga - though I don't use the 2MB PCMCIA card
      much. I also have 2 external disk drives too, which come in very
      handy when copying disks :)

         Feel free to @{"contact me" link ContactMe} about anything related to the Amiga
         or videogames consoles and I will try to help you.

      My Amiga 600 was acquired from www.ebay.co.uk in January 2001 and
      has since had the following added/connected to it:


         1 MB internal RAM (in trapdoor)
         2 MB PCMCIA RAM card (occasionally used)
         2 External 3.5" disk drives
         4 Gigabyte (PC) harddrive
         RF cable (used to connect to my TV)

@node AMOS "ADB`s Games Volume 2 - AMOS History"

      AMOS is a BASIC programming language created by Francois Lionet
      who, at the time, worked for Mandarin.

      AMOS 1.0 was released for the Amiga in the late 80`s / early 90`s
      and was an instant hit, giving people the ability to do just
      about anything.

      This was followed up by AMOS 1.1 and then AMOS 1.2 (the first
      version I got my hands on) which improved on the previous versions
      by fixing bugs and adding new commands.

      In 1991 AMOS 1.3 was released, which also included a special Object
      Modeller program (or OM for short) which gave people the ability
      to create simple polygon models, with simple "textures".
      Naturally AMOS 1.3 included new commands that allowed you to move,
      rotate and alter the colours of the 3D models.

      In 1992 several new versions of AMOS appeared - Easy AMOS (a
      smaller simplified version, with much fewer commands) and AMOS
      Professional.

      AMOS Professional gave people the ability to develop new commands
      by creating new .LIB files (also known as Extensions). One of the
      famous ones is AMCAF, and a worthy addition too.

      AMOS Professional also included a Compiler which allowed people
      to compile their AMOS Professional programs, making them much
      faster and giving people the ability to create games which could
      run straight from the CLI or from Workbench.
      However, it is as far as I know, not possible to compile programs
      that use commands created from new Extensions (such as AMCAF).

      Several official updates followed (along with some unofficial ones)
      fixing bugs in the previous versions and adding yet more commands
      to AMOS Professional, giving it well over 500 commands


      AMOS Software List:

            AMOS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 (aka AMOS - The Creator)
            AMOS Professional (often shortened to AMOS Pro)
            AMOS Professional 1.11
            AMOS Professional 1.12
            AMOS Professional 2.0
            AMOS Professional 2.1
            AMOS Professional 2.X (the best and last version?)

@endnode

@node AMOSfolder "ADB`s Games Volume 2 - AMOS Folder"

      For those of you that have AMOS Professional, I have included the
      original Simple Art 2004 file so you can see how bad it was!
      It may (or may not) run on AMOS - The Creator.

      NB: Make sure any valuable files are NOT in your disk drives
          when running this - I will not be held responsible for any
          files you may lose as a consequence of running the program.
