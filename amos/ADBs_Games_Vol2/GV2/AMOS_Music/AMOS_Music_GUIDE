@node Intro "AMOS Music - Intro"

      This disk features 12 AMOS music banks which can be loaded into
      Simple Art 2004 using the "Load Music" option. They can also be
      loaded into either AMOS - The Creator or AMOS Professional.
      Simple Art 2004 is a simple art program which can be found on my
      "Games_Vol2" disk.

      The ".abk" file format is an AMOS bank and can contain sprites,
      bobs (blitter objects), music and several other data types.
      Simple Art 2004 can detect whether the ".abk" file is a music
      file or not, so there should be no problems of it loading the
      wrong sort of file and then crashing.

      If you are running Simple Art 2004 on a unexpanded A500 then I
      suggest you don`t attempt to load in a music file. If you do
      and there isn't enough free memory it will not load the file.

@node AMOS "AMOS Music - AMOS History"

      AMOS is a BASIC programming language created by Francois Lionet
      who, at the time, worked for Mandarin.

      AMOS 1.0 was released for the Amiga in the late 80`s / early 90`s
      and was an instant hit, giving people the ability to do just
      about anything.

      This was followed up by AMOS 1.1 and then AMOS 1.2 (the first
      version I got my hands on) which improved on the previous versions
      by fixing bugs and adding new commands.

      In 1991 AMOS 1.3 was released, which also included a special Object
      Modeller program (or OM for short) which gave people the ability
      to create simple polygon models, with simple "textures".
      Naturally AMOS 1.3 included new commands that allowed you to move,
      rotate and alter the colours of the 3D models.

      In 1992 several new versions of AMOS appeared - Easy AMOS (a
      smaller simplified version, with much fewer commands) and AMOS
      Professional.

      AMOS Professional gave people the ability to develop new commands
      by creating new .LIB files (also known as Extensions). One of the
      famous ones is AMCAF, and a worthy addition too.

      AMOS Professional also included a Compiler which allowed people
      to compile their AMOS Professional programs, making them much
      faster and giving people the ability to create games which could
      run straight from the CLI or from Workbench.
      However, it is as far as I know, not possible to compile programs
      that use commands created from new Extensions (such as AMCAF).

      Several official updates followed (along with some unofficial ones)
      fixing bugs in the previous versions and adding yet more commands
      to AMOS Professional, giving it well over 500 commands


      AMOS Software List:

            AMOS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 (aka AMOS - The Creator)
            AMOS Professional (often shortened to AMOS Pro)
            AMOS Professional 1.11
            AMOS Professional 1.12
            AMOS Professional 2.0
            AMOS Professional 2.1
            AMOS Professional 2.X (the best and last version?)
