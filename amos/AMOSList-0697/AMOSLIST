Hello all,

I want my Amos program to detect any keyboard mapping and subsequentely
convert any keypresses to german, italian etc.

How do I do it?

Also I`ve updated Star Fighter(30/5/97).  Check it out if you want.  No
more installer, just download Star Fighter Boot.  Erase the old
Star_FIGHTER_Boot/ drawer in your StarFighter game directory and unpack
sf_boot.lha into that drawer.  Double-click on Star_Fighter now (no
geosync_1996 rubbish) and away you go.  Full documentation of the game
is on my homepage as well as keyboard commands (yay)in GameTips

Cheers,

C&C (WarCraft2 being my preferred game) is much more fun than Battle Isle. It
has to be modem, and a turn-based game like BI has too much waiting around,
even when you can talk to each other!

More fun!

But those games are OLD. New programming techniques are popping up all the
time. You hardly notice it, but you get more and more `possibilities' for the
same-speed computers as time goes on. A couple of years ago, it was claimed
`impossible' to produce a doom-clone on an Amiga 1200. `It just doesn't have
the processor power'. This was coming from Team 17, who created Alien Breed 3D
2. It IS difficult to write good, fast AI in AMOS, but there is AMOS support
for assembler (extensions and banks) that allow you to calculate much faster.

>>Hell if you were real ambitious what about a network/internet game!
>And email gaming, if possible.

Yes! Multiplayer games are the only games I ever play now, even if it's just
the option to share scoreboards, it's better than playing all by yourself!
Everything I code has modem/serial support now, even to the extent that two
people can edit the same map over modem at the same time using my Map Editor!

Will do. I have already got a procedure that allows you to enter text with the
cd32pad or joystick. I'll put that up too today.

Nobody, just a reminder to all.

Okay, here's an update:

All the stuff submitted so far is on the page. Can I get updates on what
everyone is doing and how the work progresses? I've put up a plotline (quite
humourous) that can tie all the stages together. Grab it and let me know what
you think. If that will be the title, can the graphic guys get to work on
character design and some spiffy title pages. Also, once the plotline is
finalized, can we get some in between stages artwork? And, to the writer of
the text over graphic scroller (sorry, I forget who did it at this point) can
you see how easy it would be to do one tht scrolls regular text, not bobs,
over the graphics? Any problems so far? Any questions? BTW, since we will
probably be doing a FX OR Music option, we can use MEDs or MODs just as well.

Only we aren't using extensions. Whatever one it is, I don't have it, as PATH$
works fine for me. Put it as _PATH$ then.

Sure. I could do some "Game Over" screens, for one, I'm a graphics 
guy, second, I think I may have some ideas on hand (half-finished). 
Also, I could go ahead and do the next-level screen for my raycasting 
level when the plotline, title, and main character are established.

Actually, it was in debugging stages, but what with all the suggestions
we've had from you lot it's now in development stages again. :)

>how much longer it will be before its released? Also, what does the AGA

Not too long now. A demo will be released soon showing off some of the new
effects.

>extension offer in options? What will be the price?

Well, /some/ of the things on offer are AGA screens (/with/ the ability to
use AGA sprites and bobs and fading (in and out)), 24 bit screens, new
sprite/bob engine, more music formats (like s3m, xm etc), own animation
system with realtime 2*2/4*4/2*4/4*2 zooming, hardware scrolling including
24 bit quad scrolling, cd32 joypad support, and much more.

The price will probably be around 12 UKP.

I hope that answers your questions!

Well, tell me when you'll lose your internet connections, and if it gets

WARNING - This ones BIG! (just the way I like em)

- First a responce (end of file)
Well, in C&C you can control ALL your units at once! Simply by selecting
them and assigning that group to a number key. Then using the small map 
you can go anywhere instantly and just select say, the helicopters to attack
something. BUT I dont think it should be anything like C&C or WarcraftII.
We dont want to simply copy a pc game now do we!

- OK now some more ideas
What about something with only say only 10 units. But each one has multiple
actions. It could be something cute (worms etc). Actually cute and colourful
would be cool. But make it faster than C&C because theres less units.
There could be only 4 movable unit building options which each have distinct
purposes/abilities. Each type would naturally have cool speech and graphics.
But not like Z, that game really annoyed me! WAIT.....hang on I'm getting an
idea...Maybe instead of buildings, a couple of unit types could be PLANTABLE.
ie they run/drive/slither about until you double click on them (or press a 
key) then they would PLANT themselves in the ground (cool anim!) and then
have their BIG GUNS available. BUT to unPLANT them takes X amount of seconds
...Strategy with realtime tension! Hence the player could choose to build
all plantable units or all moving/firing units or any combo, resuting in
different tactics every game! eg moving/firing units for storming/team work
 and plantable units for defence/tactical advantage. Imagine reteating
with a planter from firing units, then getting just far enough away,
CURCHUNK, BAM BAM BAM! mowed the suckers! BUT will the intepid plantboy
hold off the advancing forces?! Thats for the player to decide! Retreat/
holdyourground. Maybe selected units could be directly controlable, unlike
C&C, so the player could consentrate on critical areas.
OK I here you say, 10 units = no action, well you could have units knocked 
back by bigger explosions/hits. If they were hit by a planter they would be
knocked back quite away (and maybe stunned) for vital seconds.
That way planters could hold off an entire troop of movers if the attackers
approach wasnt right! (enabling a good player to embarrase a bad one!)
 eg 2 from front & 2 from back because the planters would be very slow at 
turning in their planted state! This would need intense thought on how to
attack multiple planters, otherwise wasted energy & time(for reinforcements)
There could be say 3 types of planters and 3 of movers. (+ maybe another
type) 'not enough varitiy' I hear you scream, BUT!
the game structure needs to be set so it SEEMS simple
(eg Doom, even C&C and WCII) so the first time player thinks 'cool abit of
blasting fun!', but as players skills progress unlimited amounts of tactics
must be avaliable, like chess really.
	OK, what happens when you 'build' units. They take time (C&C) and
when they are ready, the player can klik ANYWHERE on the map for the unit
to appear. Now crap you might think but only one unit would ever be ready
at any one time, so it wouldnt be unfair. Plus this could be some major
tricks/traps setting potential (eg teleporting a unit behind a planter
while attacking from the front). What type of credits/materials bit you
could have I'm not sure. Ideas? (very simple though, shouldnt be distracting)
	NOW the format. Big problem. This game I think would be suited to
smallish maps and a c&c view. But scrolling could be a problem as it would
need to be fast. Biggish sprites would also be good (say 32*32 for big
things in lowres?) So ideas for a different view system might be needed
if its not possible to scroll in ALL directions (C&C (again)).
Maybe even isometric? (hmm to hard!)
(oh I love talking about game ideas. Believe me I couldve gone on alot
 longer! :) )

As a few of you already know, I have written a full Mailing list server
using AMOS. Im currently adding some new ideas to it, and am releasing a
version into PD as shareware within the next few days.

I would like to know if anyone here (especially anyone who has free net
access) would be interested in testing the software. It would involve
annoying things like sending dozens of test mails to yourself, and rigging
your mates into sending mails etc.

At the moment, I run the AmILC mailing list with it, and am soon to be
inheriting a new mailing list to run. It can handle infinite number of
users, and hopefully an Unlimited number of mailing list accounts.

Please Email me if you are interested.

Mush

P.S. A good test maybe, would be to try and see if the AMOSList game can
     handle? What ya think Mr Giark, want to try it? Should only take youa
     couple of minutes to set up the program.

I hardly ever use it. I just grab them from ilbm pictures in direct mode.
When is this extension being released?

A Big Hello to all AmosList subscribers!

I'm a brand new frenchy member... Just in case you know these tiny proggies , I'm the author of POWERTETRIS, POWERMETER, BRIKFIGHTER etc...

I was just wondering a few questions about AMOS(pro) :

* What are the best extensions to speed up gfx operations, to do intuition stuffs? At what price (if still available)?
* Anyone experiencing problems with 68000 amigas, when trying to launch an AmosPro20 compiled program with icon banks in it? (knowing it works fine with a Amos136 compiled version). 
* Anyone experiencing problems with VERY big screens (like 800x800-32colors), and trying to scroll through it with screen offset?
* Anyone experiencing sprite bank hotspot reversing after compilation?

Best regards,
JBB

Gotta grab them from somewhere.  Actually, all you need is a sprite grabber
with the ability to add, insert & delete sprites from iff files.  Thats all
I'd want in a sprite 'editor'.  Crop after grab is ok, but don't spend toooo
much time on it.

How about sprite grabbing commands in the extension, so that we can write
our own program.

thatway.

I though about, say, in Dune2, in the middle of attack on enemy base, you
would get a message that 'base is attacked'. Now you MUST fix the base and
continue attack at the same time. This could be fixed with 1) pause in
critical moments and 2) AI for routine jobs, such as base repairing.

No we don't :)

My idea is SF strategy, but with massive use of engineering units, and
another feature I'm lazy to write about but I think it would be cool :)
Wanna hear?

Sounds nicely, so far.

I don't think so. Of course, it must not look complicated, but it should
be complex.

>(eg Doom, even C&C and WCII) so the first time player thinks 'cool abit of

That's the last problem.

Of course, there's small number of units.

Yes, such a tool is included. We've opted for just a grabber.

We're working as fast as we can! It's just that we want to release a /good/

AHI is going to be included, and RTG is also a very good possibility. We
might work with Steffen Haeuser to include his routines.

But this all depends on whether Vulcan is interested in publishing it.

Oh, and you didn't hear this from me. :))

Well, we're now including, for instance, AHI and AVI and some of the
suggestions you guys made.

So, erm, in brief : I don't know when it's going to be finished. We are
working our butts off programming the thing however. Please, have patience.

By the way... I keep getting duplicates from you... I got this message 6

Oh, those are included. But we'll throw in a grabber just in case.

Yeah, it's annoying.  It's not in the mailer, or the sendmail proggie, it
seems to be in the proggie that delivers the mail to the net.  Sendmail
splits it up into the people its going to and sets up seperate mails, then
the other bit sends it to all the people its going to.  Multiply that out.

As I said, hold down the SHIFT key when clicking on the link. That tells your
browser to download as raw data. It works on every browser I have ever come

It would be nice (I use it occasionally), but (IMHO) it would be nicer

Sure, will do. I have a few bugs to iron out of my private version, then I
have to add a GUI and change a few things so that it can be made public, as
at the moment it just does one specific thing, and I have to change code to
change settings!!

AMCAF is the best for speed up the gfx operations (.. and much more!). The
price is 30DM

For the Intuition stuff have a look at the GUI Extension. It's freeware.
Get it on Aminet/dev/amos/GuiExt162.lha

This is a famous bug :(


P.S Since probably you know Francois Lionet, do you have some extra
developer doc about Amos? Expecially about the Amos.Library functions?

Steve Bye at 'steve@f1lw.demon.co.uk' sells the AMOS Pro compiler for about
15
I dont know if he sells AMOS Pro though.
Although he is in the UK and not Australia he would send it by mail order

After much troubles, I am finally back!

I have missed most of the AMOS list news.  The server deleted my mail, it got
too full.  :-(

I am now back on the Amiga,  new modem and all, but I still have a problem.  I
got a Quantum Atlas 31070 1GB hard drive.  Every time I cold boot it gives
false read errors.  A warm boot works fine!  I am useing the A3000 SCSI
controller.

Is it too late to get in on the list game, or are all pieces in place?  Is
there a webpage?

Thanks to all those who wished my sister well, she is doing prety well now. 
She thought it was cool people she didn't know were thinking of her. :-)

Thanks in advance,

I made a little shoot the airplane game and
it's in Aminet game/shoot now.
No big fancy code, just a little piece,
but it is AMOSPro.

Hell there Michael!

I noticed that you had uploaded some Blitz2 stuff on the Net, and i wondered
if you could help me with somthing.

I am trying very hard to build the best online reference for BlitzBasic2
users, and in doing so i need some material that can be spread.
So basicly i am wondering if you could be interested in giving my site
somthing special, some code examples, or perhaps write a small tutorial on
hardcore OS programming etc..
Anything is of interest really.

If you take a look at my site : Http://home.sol.no/jonlb/
then you will notice that the document section is quite thin!
But like i mentioned, anything Blitz'ish is of interest.


I am currently porting "Homesite" from the Pc using Blitz2.
To be able to port it, i need an OOP based GUI system (like windows 95) and
have started to code that.
Its comming along nicely! i cant wait to update it to assembler!
If i had more time i would have written more stuff for my page, but exams...
you know how it is.
But i have gotten great responce on my examples and the site itself, i hope
you like it!

Please get back to me on this as soon as possible, it would be nice if we
could have a Blitz2 comunity on the net exept for the mailing lists.

Best regards,
   Jon Lennart Berg

I'm working on Cap'n Bubba.  I have one, kinda like Buzz Lightyear, and I'm
still thinking on the drunken guy with the fire extinguishers.  I think the
later will have more appeal. :-)  Should the enemies be cartoonish or evil? 
I'm thinking cartoonish.

I'm also working on the gfx for the sideways scroller.  Mainly the
backgrounds.  Also, is he to be in a ship or floating along like the space
harrier stage?

The sideways one is the only one I can plug in my graphics, right?  How about
source to the other parts to try out?  In space harrier, the graphics seem to
be plotted out, how do we work on those?

I'm still battling the new HD, so I'm running slow, but all work is saved on a
stable drive.

Hey Giark, any help on random filesystem corruption?  It passes all tests, but
real world stuff kills it.

Thanks in advance!

I think the storyline is pretty acceptable, provided that some think 
there might should be a couple of changes (not me at the moment).

On those graphics, I'll get you some as soon as possible provided 
that you tell me what type of character you would like to see.

The new scroll is exactly what I was looking for.

Now, all you guys check out the web page and the text for the game. I need to
know if we can go ahead and get graphics based on that. If so, who is into
doing between level pics that the text can scroll over?

It's just a rough outline with a bit of humour thrown in to make this the best
multiple game stage thingy we can make.

That's why I need to know if Cap'n Bubba is the final character or not. If so,
you can get a lot of ideas from the text and do your own thing. What would be
best is first a full screen pic of Cap'n Bubba, showing how he looks from the
front, side and back. Then, the graphic guys can all submit Cap'n Bubba
graphics based on the full page one.

Comments?

Not to sound critical, but I think (besides Andy Hawkins) I am the 
only one that submitted anything graphical, unless you haven't put it 
up and I haven't seen it yet, Giark.

On Cap'n Bubba, you don't want a pot-bellied lizard type dude? hehe. 
I'd need some ideas on what people would like to see him as before I 
do any creating/redering.

Hokey.  Well, I optimised the speed a bit more (!) and explosions/collisions
should be working nicely in the next few days.  BTW, I like the current
working title.

He's in the cheapo army surplus ship in the sideways scroller (unless the gang

I should be getting source from all the stages on or before the June 30
deadline. As to individual graphics, you'd be best off contacting the
individual authors directly. (I guess I should start getting email addresses
on the page).

What is the setup? (Hardware, controller, system)

I know on mine, (GVP Impact Series II controller, MTEC68020+1Meg) if I switch
on the extra ram, the hidden dma messes up sometimes. I use a supra program to
turn off the hidden DMA when I use that ram.

Nope, all I have received is up on the page as soon as I get it. Since we have
no argument, let's have a couple title screens of `Cap'n Bubba and the Nasty
Alien Menace' drawn up.

Schitso is also working on the Cap'n. What I would like is for all of you
aspiring graphicos to do up your version of Cap'n Bubba. Then, we'll decide on
a final look for him.

Good enough. I can take IFF, WAV, AU, or anything. I saw this on a game for
the 64, where the makers all had their names in a sample while the game
loaded. We may not do it, but it's an idea.

Just wanted to say that I am currently working on a menu system much like the
one in C&C and WarCraft which is intended to be used in a game like this.
It is very adjustable; able to run in any screensize (the buttons is
automaticaly fixed to a proper size), will support any number of colours
(hopefully very soon AGA thanks to the new extension!?) and it generally looks
very nice and slick IMHO.
The style is still fantasy as this seems to be the most popular.
Will anyone out there take the responsibility and be the leader of this
project or should we perhaps wait till the first list game is well completed?
I'd better go now... Have to read for my German exam tomorrow... aaargh!

Hello all,

I want to have my game install using the standard installer script and
then unpack all the disks using LHA.  How can I write the script to do
this.  It seems the commodore installer wont handle DOS commands.
When using the commodore installer with a script is it possible to add
DOS commands like LHA to the script. 
I am trying to write an installer using the standard commodore installer
, that runs LHA to unpack the files just installed to the
(dest@default-dest).
So when I type...
(copyfiles (source "Star_Fighter_Boot:")
           (dest@default-dest)
           (all)
)
..can I then include the command 
LHA e SF_BOOT (dest@default-dest)
...to get the currently copied file to unpack after being installed?

Any ideas?
Cheers, Andy:GEOSYNC-MEDIA

I have been thinking about this a little... well, I still don't see too much
point in C&C strategy, but I think that this could be perfect for static
stratgy.. Imagine Worms viewed from above, and you'll know what I mean :)

I'm for cartoonish as well. Btw, Buzz Lightyear is a good idea for 
Cap'n Bubba. I thikn I could locate some models on him (or make one 
myself) and render some out in Lightwave.

Well, whatever you do, don't do any graphics for the 3d-dungeon level 
(which I'm doing, the raycaster). I'll do those myself, however, any 
textures and/or enemies would be gladly accepted (the latter 
especially). My e-mail addresses are listed in my signature at the 
bottom of this message.

Btw, Giark, I can't seem to get anything off of the page to work 
(.lha's and Amos programs) after I download it. Everthing I get off 
seems to be corrupt. Any ideas? If nothing else, just send me 
everything via e-mail in a .zip or something.

Also, are there any other new graphics that you've received that you 
haven't put up on the page yet (besides the 3 title screen .jpeg's I 
did)? If there are, I haven't seen them and would like to.

Hi, here's some questions for you..

1st: Has anyone has been able to get the InactiveList-command, in 
AMOSPro's dialogs, to work? Doing as the manual tells you, only generates 
an error.

2nd: Is there a way to put two ActiveLists over each other in two 
different dialogs? If I try do do this I'm only rewarded with a guru :-P. 
I've tried with freezing the first one but it doesn't matter. Another 
famos bug, eh?

3rd: Is there any friendly AMOS-dude out there who would be nice and send 
the GuiExt-extension to me (MIME-format please)? The FTP-server I used 
has been withdrawn... :-(

Both are cool.  Cartoonish and evil...  ;-)  Actually, a similar style
throughout ALL the levels and stages would be good, but I know all the
graphics guys have different styles.

Feel free to design a set (sets?) of graphics for a level of the space
harrier, errr, castle assault stage.  One level at least has some nice
graphics (thanks Andrew)  Any preferences to how they fly would be nice.

I need the graphics at 'closest to the player' stage, with as many colours
as you like...  They'll all get crunched to down to 32 in the end.  I'll try
and write a level-editor if I get a chance.  (don't hold your breath)

I've put everything I get up as soon as I get it. I think there are a lot of
people working, but no one is submitting yet.

Hmm Pretty good idea. Good comprimise to my idea as mine would have to be 
very carfully programmed and thought out to be fun. But worms from above 
would be relativly easy to program and the scrolling could even be 
hardware scrolling of a screen 4 times bigger than 320*200. Could also 
solve the problems of linking up multiple computers because everyone 
could play on the one computer. The game would need some type of altitude 
I would think. Maybe make it isometric, or fake hills? Maybe start 
with no units and a quota of how many units can be used. So you still have 
the option of using different strategies in the middle of a game 
(still with that teleporting thing of mine!) Could be interesting!

Well, it has happened. The Mushroom PD Library is now back online with its
FTP site. Simply set your FTP programs to look at:

mushy-pd.dyn.ml.org

If my computer is online, you will be connected to a server other than
127.0.0.1. If that is the server you come up with (it will launch your own
servers if you do) then I am not online.

IMPORTANT POINTS
----------------

When you log in, you *MUST* set your FTP to give your email as the
password. If you dont, you simply wont get connected in. After a small
incident with my Demon server, this option will not be removed. This
program has been tested with AmFTP, and no problems occured at all.

The system will allow the uploading of files. All uploads must be
accompanied with a .Readme file, and be placed in the UPLOADS drawer
otherwise they will be discarded.

Logs are kept for every possible event that goes on, from when you log on,
to when you look around the different drawers. There is no limit as to what
you want to download, as it is all for free.

Any requests to open a special drawer for you, or for a project (like the
AMOS Mailing list game) or similar such project, all requests should be
emailed to me at mushypd@redrose.net

At the moment, only 4 people at a time can be in my system. I hopefully
will be able to monitor all 4 at once, and if my 33.6 can handle it easily
enough, I shall increase the number of users.

Over the next few days, I shall be improving and adding bits to the site,
like updating some of the old docs, so please don't go on a mass
bug-spotting trip because some of the docs have my old email address on
them.

If you get a busy signal when you connect, please try again later in the
evening, im sure someone will have left!!

Above all, enjoy the library, after all, it is all for you!!

I sent a very early Cap'n Bubba to Giark today.  Let me know if this is the
type of guy we want.  I am stuck on the arms in the behind view for the Castle
Assault stage.  I don't even know if you could see them from this angle.  If
anyone has an idea, please send them directly to me also.

Once I get the character finalized, I can work on making it look good and the
animations.  I really want some funny ones for getting hit. :-P

What type of evil critters should we use?
Also, how about the ship in the side scroller?  I think a beat up junker would
fit well.

As Adam wrote, I am moving SOON.  I may loose contact for a little bit.  I am
not leaving, it may just take a little while to get another net account.

Just so you know, I give the AMOS List the right to use and modify my
submitted work and ideas for any AMOS List games.  If my work or ideas are
used for a commercial product, a reasonable attempt must be made to contact
me.

I just didn't want anyone to say, "Great! now we have to get another Bubba!"
Use it or modify it if you want, I'm not the type to complain about it.

BTW, What should I change on him?  Should we let Adam put it in Lightwave?  If
we do, ALL the graphics will have to be rendered, not just Bubba, and that
will take alot of work on his part in addition to doing the raycaster level.

Thanks

Just to understand each other, I didn't mean worms, but worm-like game from
above, where units could be anything.

If that could be programmed relatively easy, then I think we should include
that.

Isometric... that wouldn't be clear enough. What kind of fake hills you mean?
BTW, we can add more terrain types than worms, say rivers or forests.

And now, yes.. shit.. worms are arcade game, but from above... I don't see how
much arcade could it be... What do you think, would it be good to have wind
(in every possible direction)? That could maybe solve the problem.

It could... I'm sorry, but for school holidays I'm probably going somewhere so
I can't contribute :(

Hello all AMOS users,

This is the first letter to the list and I would like to say hello
to you all. Watch out for a game called 'Monty the Wolf', it shows
people that AMOS isnt as crappy as some people thought...

The problem is that the games size is just over a disk, I dont want
to waste a nearly empty disk. I was just wondering if there is anyway
I could compress my files smaller? I was using PPSave/PPLoad, but both
have crappy flashing lines for decompressing. Any ideas ?

Thanx..

Hey there. I hope its not too late.

Seeing as ive managed to free myself some time during the day, I would like
to get involved with the list game in some kind of way.

Only problem, is im a bit unsure of what needs to be done. If anyone has
any suggestions as to what needs to be done then please let me know.

All my library options are open to everyone, and I can make ASCII lists
available.

dynamic, so people can all FTP into my site.

I'll keep you all posted as to the developments of this.

Hello,
      I've got a few questions/suggestions for the CB game:

1 -  It mightnt be the most important thing at the moment,but
has there been and thought given to the scoring system?
There would have to be some reasonable standard to stop
modules scoring differently. I.e one scores 900 points for killing
a boss or something where another scores 2000 for killing a thug
who isnt really important.

2 -  Thinking yesterday that the game could probably need some bonus
levels or secret rooms ect. Eg, one would go to the bonus level
if they finish a level (Say a 4th of a module) without dying.
I was thinking of maybe a pang style subgame.
As in you shoot a big bubble it splits into 2 smaller ones and they
split into 4 smaller ones ect so when the smallest is burst a
bonus (Points? Ammo? Time??) is dropped.
My second idea fits in a bit better with the bubble gun idea.
Late last year I was messing about with a bubble bobble idea.
(For those that havent played it, its a platformer where you
capture baddies with bubbles and pop the bubbles to get points)
This could use the same bonus system where you get as many aliens
a possible in a time limit. I started programming this last year
but dropped it half finished for other work.
I could finish this is anyone thought it of use?

3 -  This message is getting a bit long already so I'll make it short,
I deleted lost some e-mail messages by accident and kind of remember
something about digitized names? What was that about?

Thats it from me!

Okay, Giark, no problems any more. I finally got those files 
downloaded. Of all things, I loaded up ILE (Internet Exploder, hehe, 
I use Netscape) and it downloaded everything!

Well, who would have thought that a product produced under the 
direction of ol' Billy-bob Gates would do me some good? hehe.

Does this mean you like it? <blush>

Mind you, I could change it to make it synchronize with any fancy effects
going on, so IF this music will be used the guy who's doing the intro
could contact me...

Gosh, I do love positive criticism :))

Subject: How the game goes? (was Re: The A\BOX!)
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hello everybody:

Please, stop all this noise about multitasking, PC, M$, A/box, and so on.
I don't want to be rude but this is an AMOS list, and all this subject is
more properly for another mailing lists. Ok?

I have a question for Giark and everybody involved in the list's game.
How the game goes? I really like the name of the game "Cap'n Bubba" :)
Please Giark, can you put a line in all your posts indicating the
percentage already finished, like Adam Parrot did with him raycaster?

Greetings for Spain

I think what you mean here, is when you go to run the program. By default,
AMOS sets the variable buffer to about 8K, depending on the settings in the
Editor Config. If you have a command like SET BUFFER 50, on the very first
line of your program, it will give you a variable buffer of 50K

I always found that scrolling upwards in a text was always slightly slower.
The easiest way (and quickest) is to use a SCREEN COPY and type the new
text over where you just moved the block from.

Hmmm, I dont think PC fonts are compatible. Standard fonts can be used in
AMOS and the TEXT command.

The AGA extension is currently being debugged, and once it is released, the

Hmmm, I dont think the Amiga has a processor that will go to 200Mhz, but i
could be wrong. As for the cost, I would have no idea of how much it would
be in Iran.

I don't know the rest of people, but I am very busy and I can't answer all
the queries. Besides, you have to let people to take some time to think
first and then answer. And there ase some problems that we don't know how
to solve.

Ya, I would like to get everyone who works on the game to send me a digitzed
sample of his voice so we can play them all during the listgame credits. If we
can't get everyone digitized, we may not do it, but if we can...

hi to all amos/amiga fans
DANGER! too Big/Huge/Great! Mail!
         Amiga In My Country,and my opnions about AMIGA!
after I saw your arguments about A/BOX the super Amiga(as I think)
I want to say sth about My loved machine AMIGA!
first i must say about my self and my amiga   when about 5 years ago
I bought an A600,I saw myself in Computer world! but at that time
PC users say to me hey you are out and Amiga is only for play!
and Amiga users said to me he! A600 is very bad you must bye a A500
but I started working,first i got familier with computer,
there was only one persian(my mother language) book about Amiga500!
I read that and then i got that what is this keyfull machine under my
hands!
some monthes later (less than 6 monthes) I saw a new Amiga,A1200
so it was very cheap at that time and it was becouse of A600 problems
I get an A1200,and then after some monthes a1200 prices raised and
came to 3x of mine price,and then when PCs grows up,the company
which was C= seller in Iran,saw that there is more benefit on PCs
and stoped selling amigas,but about my self,when I bought my A1200
I knew what is PC,AMIGA,INTEL,MOTOROLLA,BASIC,C and computer graphics
but nothing eles,I bought an 200MG hard and 020 card with 4mg ram
after that i start learning computer languages,AND MY PROBLEMS BEGINS
THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH AN UPTODATE COMPILERS,AND BOOKS I BOUGHT MY BOOKS
VERY VERY EXPENSIVE,BUT ALL OF BOOKS WERE PUBLISHED IN 1985!
when we see an AMIGA FORMAT or other AMIGA mags in Iran,we want to fly
(really I say) but here we have AMIGA PROGRAMERS LESS THAN USERS BUT MORE
LESS THAN OTHER PLACES MAY ABOUT 0.2%,but I am one of them(as I think)
when I saw the advertisment of programing books,CDs,or other things
I hope that I could come to europe and GET THESE THINGS,but not possible
and i must say we can find some things in IRAN for Amiga,even LIGHT ROM 5
two weeks after its publishing(Iranian graphic makers used amiga mostly,but
they are comming less,becouse of SPEED)
so I want to say to you who are in Europe and even Austrolia,KNOW THE VALUE
OF YOUR ABILITIES!
now I continue my own Amiga story(it is near end)
after 1 year i got not enought space on my hard disks,i get an 2.1 quantom
hard disk and 030/50 with 16mg ram,CDROM & modem but after 6monthes my hard
disks burnned,and after that I sold all things exept my AMIGA and my modem
now I am searching for any body who wants to go to Europe,and ask him to buy
an Power Up board for me,to MAKE MY AMIGA AGAIN!
but there is somthing about Whole Amiga,in Iran I saw many peopels who
sold theier Amigas to buy PCs,but they Reson was this
1.speed 2.speed 3.not enough good programs like CAD,or other Engniering
programs 4.AND EVEN NOT GOOD GAMES!!!!
so I as very young member Of this Beautifull and Powerfull ship which is
going to sink(I MEAN AMIGA) ask you all to write GOOD PROGRAMS
and User friendly,i am nothing,but i am doing this in my Editor,which
I said at my first mail,for example I Made every thing definable for
USER,and I support all the PC text formats(we have some text formats for
farsi Language with different Char sets!) and I am working on MACs formats
another thing is INTERFACES,I think amos intrface is not very good
but u can change it easily! so do it !
and about games.I think we must start new kind of games,I hope you have seen
F14-Tomcat and apachie full motion GAMES(i think Apachie is in
Aminet/game/demo) as you may know this games are written in amos
i think there were good games,but PC game makers saw that and started
the games like that,but they were differnt ,they get the IDEA but proved
it and made colour full full motioned games like mad dog!
Is It realy amiga problem that It can't show COLOUR FULL anims,or our
(programers) Problem!
another thing about games is LET'S WORK ON 3D games,i don't mean doom like
ones but some thing LIKE NEED FOR SPEED,or SCREAMER,after RALLY AGA i havent
seen any good car race game on Amiga,and to all programers
DON'T TRY TO MAKE SMALL GAMES,WITH MORE DATA YOU CAN MAKE A VERY GOOD GAME
AND HOPEFULLY CD IS INVENTED USE IT LIKE PC GAME MAKERS!

AT LAST I WANT TO SAY
1.I HAVEN'T GET ANY REPLY FOR MY FIRST EMAIL
2.SHOW ME A GOOD WAY FOR BUYING BOOKS & CDS,CAN ANY ONE POST THEM BY DHL
  (I HOPE THERE WILL BE ANY GOOD WAY FOR ME TO PAY HIM MONEY)
3.I WANT ANY NEWS ABOUT 603E+ POWER UP BOARD!
4.PLEASE HELP AMIGA TO NOT SINK AT THIS CYBER STORM,IN THIS CYBER SEA!
5.AND ANOTHER THINK,I THINK WE CAN MAKE A GAME HERE ALL WITH EACH OTHER!
AND IT WILL BE A VERY GOOD GAME!

On 11-Jun-97 14:03:32 Mr. Giark To You wrote something about CB intro.

>I think we might use the punter mod for the intro. Thoughts?

Yes, I've been giving it some thought, and I think the Punter mod could be
used as a starter before the actual intro.

Let me give an impression of how I see the intro with the music :

(the text bits have to be changed ofcourse - I just put some there for
the example)

Opening strings - Fade-in of a starfield which starts to scroll down
Choir 1         - Text overlay (fades in and out) "AmosList Prod. presents"
Choir 2         - "A game by the Amoslist team"
Choir 3         - "Starring"
Choir 4         - "Captain Bubba"
Boom 1          - "DIRECTED BY : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" (coders)
Boom 2          - "VISUALS BY : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" (gfxers)
Boom 3          - "MUSICAL SCORE BY : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" (musicians)
Violins fade in - Fleet of Nasty Alien Menace (tm) comes into view.
Violin bit      - Pictures overlayed on the (still scrolling) starfield
                  depict the N.A.M plotting their evil plans, whatever they
                  may be (can't think of anything right now :)
Final strings   - The planet Captain Bubba resides on scrolls up from the
                  bottom (you know, a little faster than the starfield - I
                  think Wolfchild used this too), and from there on the
                  'proper' intro starts with C.B in the bar etc.

The reason for this is because the Punter mod is - I think - a little too
'heavy' to use for a comic style game... so after this intro the tune gets
all boppy etc when our hero appears on the screen.

So, er, is this a good idea?

Tried Stonecracker? Much better compression than Powerpacker, and doesnt

If'n'anybody hasn't their hands full with the current
projects (CB & CC), I would like to propose another list-
game: a Kings Quest type adventure.  I've coded the screen
generator, main character control and animation, as well
as, a couple other things.  I sent Schitso the program
along with one of my completed screens. Although, he's more
of an action player and not much into adventure games,
he said: well, I'll let you ask'em.  ..Anyways..
I was hoping this could be one of those never-ending 
stories.  You graphic hounds will always be supplying new
backgrounds, characters, and you good story-tellers or
washed-up DM's could supply plots & puzzles. Kick it about
yourselves...y'all.

As you may not know, I'm currently working on a Doom type 3D game and 
engine, the engine which I'm going to also use to write a level for 
the List game (there is one going on. Please contact Giark at 
joehick@golden.net for more details.). After I finish my 3D game and 
engine, I plan to addon and modify the engine for a racing-game type 
engine and build some type of Need for Speed racing game. Hopefully 
by that time I can be writing all of that on an A\Box in AMOS!

Greetings.

I recently (last night) had a talk with Schitso, and he told me he 
would be moving soon. He also sent me a scetch of Cap'n Bubba, which 
I liked. I told him I could take it into Lightwave, trace it, make a 
3D model out of it, and the render some shots after slapping up a 
suit on him or something. It will be subject for review to him first, 
then if we both like it, I'll send it to Giark.

Thank you :)

I'm busy with the title tune now... think I'll start of with some sort of
fanfare with speech like "Captaainnnnnnn Bubbaaaaaaaa!!!!" and C.B standing
all proud (that's my idea for the title screen anyway :), and then
something happens (like the spotlights fall down or something - with CB
looking a tad miffed that his moment of glory is spoiled) and the
music changes to the real tune.. some sort of bouncy thing... I don't know
yet. :)

I agree.

According to the last stuff I got from the team, it goes fairly well.

I'd love to, but I don't have a clue. Q8-{) You see, this isn't like a project
by a company. I can't drop in on all the people who are involved and say `how
goes it' or some such. I must rely on what they tell me. I am really just a
coordinator and nag to keep things going. The best indication of how the game
is going is the web page.

Actually, I like that the punter.mod (grab it and listen, peoples) being so
dark. Cap'n Bubba is not really a comic character. The storyline is humourous,
but not overly so and there is a lot of real danger to be faced by Cap'n.
Also, good luck synching the text with the music that tightly. (different
machine speeds do afecct that in AMOS). But you have it pretty close for the
style of the intro.

Graphic guys:

Check out EJ's message and do some screens that you think would fit. I'll do
up the intro programming. Just get me the graphics.

Well met and godspeed,

Go for it, but don't leave me out of the loop. I'd like to see the works in
progress. If you don't want them on the page, say so, but I'd like to see how
things progress.

The Cap'n Bubba And The Nasty Alien Menace IS progressing. Send me your

It was impressive, he had some great ideas to overcome huge screen redraws. 
His character walks in front of/behind many different levels of depth, through
trees, etc.

It is very good source to look at for new ideas.  :-)

Well, I am busy with a graphic adventure myself at the moment, but I've got
some other ideas lying around that I wanted to do an adventure of. As a
matter of fact I was just writing them all down, so if you're interested I
can send them to you...

Oh, and if you need any music and I'm not too busy with CB then I can help
you out there as well :)

If you want to compress data files, you can try my XPK routines on 
Aminet.  You can choose the routine that's right for you, and all you 
have to include are the XPK libraries and sublibraries.  I used this for 
a platformer I wrote.  NUKE works especially well on Amos files 
(includink Spacked files, amazingly!) and its very fast.  It also comes 
with a compression shell, and a way to compress banks into files and 
vicey-versy.

Well, Amcaf can interpret protracker commands so you can sync effects
to them, I believe. But extensions are out so I've heard. But anyway, the
actual syncing is not really up to me, it's up to the coder... just tell me
how many booms and bangs you need and I'll plonk them in there (there's an
E6x command in one of the patterns with the booms, so you can change that
to how many credits there will be displayed). The trouble is (and this is
why you'll need syncing commands) is that on NTSC the module will be played
faster. Maybe you can alter the tempo of the module to play at PAL speed on
NTSC?

On the subject of the style of the modules... well, I've started work on
the title tune (currently only in THX format - I'll convert it into PT
when it's done) and while it's not exactly comicky it isn't doom and gloom
either... it's a kind of happy song... ooh but there's a threatening bit in
the middle though.. :) Anyway, it's still being worked on.. I can upload
the THX version if anybody wants to hear what it's like at the moment.

(THX is a synth-tracker from Abyss - it's in Aminet somewhere, I believe
v1.50 is coming out tomorrow, or so I have been told. I used it so I could
concentrate on the song first without having to worry about samples or
anything).

Ok, Andy's pretty much out of the GFX, and I'm moving.  I'll put in some LONG
nights and try to get alot done before I move.  I need IDEAS!  Descriptions
will help.  Rough pictures regardless of quality are better.

The ship?
**Bad guys for Castle assault?
**Bad guys for side scroller?
Land for side scroller? (should it be buildings?)

I'm having most trouble thinking of bad guys.  I think I sent one to Adam, but
it was very generic.

Once I get the ideas in my head, it doesn't take that long.  Getting them
there is the problem.

Who can I get in touch with to carry on till I get back online?  You need to
be able to finish it if I can't get back before the 30th.

Lets go GFX guys!!!! :-)

Don't worry about synchronization at this point.  I'll get a Cap'n Bubba title

Whats this ?  Never heard of it.  How would I use this in AMOS ?
Have you any source code ?

Okay, here's how it stands from what I've seen:

Web Page
I've kept it as up to date as possible. I added file sizes to all the entries
so you have an idea of what you would be downloading. Everything I have
received is on the web site (except the one page of graphics that has not been
okayed for release to the page).

Music
EJ seems to be the man for this. His tunes are capturing the spirit of Cap'n
Bubba.

Graphics
I see some direct transfer to coders - this is good. We're still working out
the final look of Cap'n Bubba.

Code
Space Flight Stage - seen the first demo, nothing else yet. GB, how goes it?
Castle Assault Stage - third demo already up. Very nice work and much better
now that collisions and shooting is working.
Fight The Guards Stage - since the first proposal, nothing has been heard
about this stage. What goes on?
Dungeon Of Doom Stage - Adam assures us that he is getting there. Any
possibility of a demo, Andy?
Bubble Gun Stage - this was going to be a secret level, but if the FTG stage
is not happening, we may put this in as a regular stage. Can we see a demo,
James?
Score and Hige Score - Rob, how goes this?

Right now, we are 16 days away from the first deadline, where I'd like to see
at least the beginnings of each stage submitted (actual code, not compiled
versions) I know you all have other things to do, as do I, but let's keep on
working. The game looks to be a success, at least with us crazy AMOSers. I'm
working on a press release to be sent to Amiga Report once the game is
finished. Maybe we can even get on the Aminet Top Downloads list.

Well met and godspeed,
                      Giark

Greetings.

Well, I'm sorry to spring this on you guys so suddenly, but it was a 
spur of the moment thing and I can't change it, but I'm going to be 
going on vacation this coming Monday (right now it's Saturday) and 
while I'm gone I'm sorry to say that I can't program (there is no 
portable Amiga laptop, hehe, wish there was.) This also means, Giark, 
that I probably won't be able to make the June 30 deadline.

However, don't fret, because, on the goes of my raycasting level, I 
will be taking my AMOS Pro manual, my thick raycaster book (which 
I've been reading and converting source from), and some paper, which 
in this case I'll be able to put my conversions and ideas down on 
paper and feed them into AMOS when I return.

As far as Bubba, you guys will have to be on your own, unless you 
would like to wait until I get back, (which I would *highly* 
recommend, hehe, since I have some good ideas which I haven't 
finished yet, and it would be more beneficial if you waited), which 
I'm not sure when that will be, but it should be about a couple of 
days before the end of the month, the 26th or so.

If you could postpone-extend the deadline for the List game until 
July 30th, since it doesn't look like the game will be done by the 
end of this month anyhow, that would be good, it would give me alot 
more time to finish my level and Bubba. Tell me what you think.

I'm not off yet, so, you guys that check your mail over the weekend, 
go ahead and chat with me if you wish, as I'll be on as much as 
possible over this weekend before I leave.

I just checked on the list page for people to contact about the GFX.  The
graphics credits are strangely missing. :-(

What happened to all the guys who could offer artwork?

I'm NOT able to do ALL the graphics.  I AM doing all I can.  If you don't
think it looks like it is a N64 game, I DARE you to do better!!!!!

If you want this to work, (as Mr. Giark would surely say) GET OFF YOUR ASS!!!

Believe me, I'm getting there, and I like I reported in my previous 
e-mailing, I'm going on vacation for about 7-10 days and may not be 
able to make the June 30 deadline, however, I will have the level to 
you as well (my own personal projects) the Cafe engine and 
Eventuator soon after that. Believe when I say the the raycasting 
level will BLOW YOU AWAY and I hope for it to be the best or most 
anticipated level in the entire game.

Er, the ideas or the music? :)

Oh, the THX tune on the webpage is the title tune not the intro tune
ofcourse. Download it (only 1k!) and let me know what you think!

June 30 is not the final deadline, just the first deadline by which we would
like to see something from everyone. If you can't make that deadline, get as
close to it as possible.

The 30th of June is not the final deadline. Do not disregard it, but if you
can't make it, don't worry.

Will do. Hopefully I should be completely or close to finished by 
mid-July, all of it definitely by July 30th.

Well, I'm most certainly in there, so it looks like it's just me and 
you from here on, unless Johnny Bintz (Hunt is On) would like to 
contribute some of his fine art skill.

I'll be doing the enemies for my level, however, I do welcome any 
ideas for enemies on my level (even though I think I can apply some 
of my creative ability in conjunction with Giark's outline for the 
story, should suffice I say.)

Well, I would say me, but I'm going on vacation (I've said twice), 
so I won't be it touch for about 7-10 days. However, after I return, 
I will notify the list and will start back up on programming, coding, 
and graphic rendering. etc.

I'm going.. hehe.

   It goes quite well, actually. I HAVE been working on my part, and
   as you know, I have just finished the creation of a development-
   tool (The EnemyMotionDesigner), so I couldn't really work on a
   new demo until I had that done!!

   Anyway, now that the EMD utility is complete, I will start on the
   detailed designs for each of the four phases in the shooter stage.


   Regarding the EMD, I have fine-tuned it a bit more. There was one
   slight flaw (after loading a pattern-bank, you could not View a 
   Bank-Pattern until you created or loaded a Current-Pattern) so I
   fixed that and also improved the playback of the patterns while I
   was in the code (the bobs are now spaced at the same distance
   regardless of Pattern or Playback speed)...

   I hate to send you yet another version of the EMD Giark, so I will
   wait a few days and see if any new ideas crop up while working
   on the detailed phase-designs. If no further changes are made, I
   will send the, hopefuly, final of final versions of the EMD!!!


   If anyone needs a nice Motion-Designer for their Bobs/Enemies,
   check out the EMD and let me know what you think!!

   I will do my best to devote sufficient time to allow the shooter-
   stage to meet the deadline. My top priority is the QUALITY, so
   it may take a while longer, but it should be worth it...

   At any rate, trust me, I WILL complete the shooter!!

>Downloads list.

   Yes, AMOS-users should be VERY pleased with our work and with
   you handling the "public relations", this project will hopefully
   have a positive effect throughout the entire Amiga community.



   One final note: If ANYONE would like to contribute ideas for the
                   shooter stage then PLEASE do so!!

                   I'm interested in enemy-design characteristics,
                   power-ups, etc.
                   Also, feel free to design some enemy-motions
                   using the EMD utility. 

                   Any help received will definitely speed up the
                   development of the stage and make it that much
                   better as well!!

                   Currently, I am studying a half-dozen shooters to see
                   what's good, bad, what could be improved upon, etc.
                                    


                                               Take care,
      
                                                  Garfield

Hello?   Hello?

Hey who said I was out of the GFX scene?  I have only done some graphics
for Keith`s Castle Assault level, and I haven`t heard anything more
about that one?
BTW  Keith?  Got any more work for me?  Could you put your latest code
on that site you set aside?  You know the one.  Oh, I`ve forgotten the
URL, could you send it again.

And the same goes for all you guys (coders et al).  I`m taking requests,
I told Mr. Giark to send graphics requests to me but I guess you missed
it.  Anyway,  so I`m here waiting.

Anything you want?  Cartoon gfx,  renders, backdrops, scenery, clouds,
walls  anything.  Just start sending the specs and I`ll start working. 
Adam Parrot you should be ashamed of your self :o)

Seeya, (oh and remember, I`ll do any gfx)
BTW: Mr Giark...Are you still expecting me to do the 3d polygon fighter
stage?  I haven`t heard anything...

Cheers, Andy H.

Really ?  Right.  Graphics so far are cool, but more more more !!  I put
your dragon (one angle only) and the columns in the latest demo.  Dragon
looks absolutley lovely flying across the screen.  In fact, I liked it so
much, I flew it twice.  ;-)

> Anything you want?  Cartoon gfx,  renders, backdrops, scenery, clouds,
> walls  anything.  Just start sending the specs and I`ll start working. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
Right, here we go.  Graphics guys, start taking notes here...
-------------------------------------------------------------

I did mention a (preferably) one bitplane, (definately low bitplane)  cloud
background scene, nasty aliens, (friendly aliens ?) and any other gfx you
come up with.   Personally I like the gfx both you and schitso have done, 
and want more !!  Cartoon and renders are both great, but I think I'll have
to seperate them into (at least) two seperate level type things.  As to
colours (all of you) they will have to be reduced to 32 colours for the
game,  and any gfx done for me would be best at maximum colours (be sensible
on cartoon mode) and at closest to the player distance.

What objects do I want ?  Well, lets see.  Anything the original had is a
good start, y'know trioptic robots with guns the size of submarines,
mushrooms(!), dragons(!!), enemy fighters, wierd looking things with lots of
legs (Thanks Schitso), fireballs, missiles, projectiles, plasma effects,
explosions, columns (Thanks Andrew), strange looking plants to fly over,
more explosions, stones, rocks, mountains ?, bizzare spinning cube things,
multicoloured penguins, flying letters 'A', 'B', etc, colour fonts, alien
mechanical pods that spray unfriendly death in your general direction,
frenchmen (no offence meant), men from microsoft(offence meant), taxmen,
people coming to retune the VCR, flying cars, spice girls & flintstones
(kidding).

Animations are fine, they take no more time to display but are slightly
harder to program this end (b4 the editor is finished).  If you think your
graphic creation needs to retreat from the player, please do the gfx from
different angles to show this !!  Particularly when its easy with renders.

Oh yeah, Andrew.  Your dragon, can I please have a few more angles.  I wanna
see the back of his head and do a full flightplan for him !!  It would be
even better if he breathed fire..  (or ice, or gas..)

Perhaps we should break the levels down into area and terrain types, maybe
like an artic level, water(ocean), jungle, forest, plains, columns,
city(buildings) !, swamp, beach, actual castle.  Feel free to come up with
other types of level, this includes people who aren't doing anything !  The
more ideas the gfx guys get, the better, it seems.  Giark ??

Basically, anything graphic wise you can send (and this goes to all of you),
preferably in sets of graphics (level oriented) I can hurl at the player.  A
city level is more than possible, but a village would be faster..  A set of
graphics for a level is best 'cos it seperates the distinctive styles of you
gfx guys without making it look disjointed, so the more you all come up with
the better.  Feel free to run any wierd ideas past me.

More than 20 or 30 enemies per level would probably break the chip-mem
limit...  ;-)  The current demo (3) has 12 enemies for reference. 
(including rampant amos lettering)

Graphics can be as big as you like, but really big things slow it down a
bit.  If there are any particular flightplans your objects want to take, let
me know.  Hopefully there will be an flightplan editor soon, so we can all
design levels !!  Fun huh.

> Seeya, (oh and remember, I`ll do any gfx)

Cool.  See above(!)  (I'm not too sure about the dental hygene level
though..)

> BTW: Mr Giark...Are you still expecting me to do the 3d polygon fighter
> stage?  I haven`t heard anything...

Ah... it was you was it...!

Just a note to all, this project has been one of the most enjoyable projects
I have ever worked on, and it's really great to see so many people pulling
together like this.  If this project suceeds for no other reason, it's the
cooperation of amiga users and our community spirit that makes it special.

> Cheers, Andy H.

Hi,
   After recieving the go ahead for the Bonus stage I put together
a quick demo. Its not much at the moment, all I've got is the guy
running around the screen jumping on platforms.
There are no baddies and the graphics arnt even remotly related to
CB.
But I'll work on it tonight and upload something later in the week.

I really need to know if this will be a full level or not.
Right now I'm working on a simple 1 screen thing with 5 different
levels, So I want to know if I should expand it?

Ok, another note about Cap'n Bubba.  Currently my level is fairly quiet..
This is a hint.  Perhaps we can have the Cap commenting on his surroundings
as he flies section to section, level to level, module to module, maybe even
communicating with his boss/taxman/girlfriend/mother/legion of heroes..

When the co-pilot of his army surplus bails out after the first hit, "you
just can't get good help these days"  (sorry, couldn't resist that one)

Also we need a suite of enemy alien noises, perhaps jeering at Bubba,
definately whooshing noises as they fly past, explosions, shooting sounds,
painfull death noises (poor chap), alien death noises, "oh my god there's a
toothbrush flying at me" noises, fire breathing dragon noises, you know the
sort of thing.  Comments should be turn-offable(probably).  Anything is
better than shoot and boom...

Howdee..

Anyone else see the section Titled *Welcome Back*  
/Our old fave Amiga gets a big relaunch/ in the Daily Mirror on Saturday.

Here's the story if you missed it.
_________________________________________________________________________

HAVE a rummage in the attic or under the stairs and dig out your old Amiga.
The home computer which once was Britain's favorite is back in business.
The giant PC manufacturer, Gateway 2000, which recently bought the Amiga
technology, has given the old workhouse the thumbs up.
Gateway has promised to support it and encourage publishers to write new
games and other software. And the company is planning to build new, more
up-to-date Amiga computers.
With improved video games consoles and lower-priced home PC's, it'll take a
huge effort to put the Amiga back in the forefront of home computing and
game playing.
But Gateway director Stephen Johns says: "We aren't in any hurry to get our
money back. We will be very patient with the Amiga."

How long have you had your Amiga and do you still use it on a daily basis?
If so drop me a line to:

Amiga user

_________________________________________________________________________

So come on all you budding Amiga users let's tell them we're still here.
Incidently they also have an E-mail address which is:

*david@nataraj.demon.co.uk*

Why it was'nt included in the above .. I don't know ... Maybe they think
that, we as amiga users ar'nt capable of connecting to the internet.

Dear Mr. Cox,

Your page on the Amiga Web directory appeared at just the right time. So
here is a question for your frequently
(or infrequently) asked questions.

I am in the process of upgradeing my 1200 to an 040 with scssi
interface. I want to free up my PCMCIA slot
for another use (also one of the input pins on the end of the Zappo
Cdrom cable is screwed up. Is the Zappo a standard scssi unit /
interface. The back "looks" like it would just connect up..but I don't
want to damage the computer. (I opened the Zappo case, and the interface
board slots in to a standard header...the also seems like a row of
jumpers for setting ID number. A utility id'd the drive as a NEC
(36or35) Rev 1.8a???

Any ideas would be much appreciated...other wise I'll probably bring it
into work and end up hooking it up to my PeeCee..(id rather blow that up
any day)

It's not 3D...  Part from tht it seems alright.  BTW, liked the demo, but
move your enemies in bigger increments.

It'll also stop people saying 'no-one writes good games any more on the
amiga' for a while.  We'll also need to tell all the magazines, perhaps with
a (review only ?) level skipper so they can see all the stages easily.

Maybe flying through a gaseous nebula that screws up all your instruments,
sudden swarms of bugs that stick to your shields, acid clouds, mines, aliens
that shoot back, black holes, cuddly toy, souffle mixer, aliens with big
heads proclaiming 'we are your friends, do not run', a fleet of microsoft
software registration lawyers tying you up with red tape, laser jamming
stations, smegging asteroid fields (always good), wierd spaceships launching
poisonous gas clouds of death, playing tag with space pirates who can move
about a hundred times faster than you, space spiders making webs for you to
fly into..

Actually, I quite like the space spider idea.  I'd quite like to see
flying huge spiders with a web stretched between them hurtling towards the
player in the space harrier bit.  Maybe even in 'end of level guardian'
mode.  Whatever.  HINT graphics guys.

One thing with the shooter stage, make sure you move the enemies quickly, if
they are too smooth, it's like flying in porridge.  Speed > Smoothness. 
Nothing worse than a scroller that feels slow, even if its not.  The
'Aaargh, its too fast' feeling is good..

(looks like we ended up working on a game together anyway..)

   Bigger increments? Does it seem slow? I haven't had any
   feedback until now, and I thought it was just about right.

   Anyway, that demo is really "out-dated" and there will be a new
   one mixing "stupid" enemies who have some nice motions (using
   the EMD) with "intelligent" enemies which won't have quite so
   fancy motions, but will home-in, etc.
  
   I can't make the Dx/Dy of the enemies too large as, inevitably,
   the frame-rate will be dropping back to 25/30fps by the time the
   stage is complete, and this looks very bad when combined with
   "jumpy" bobs!!

   I will make the best compromise possible...

      HA!HA! Yes, in a rare moment of insight I had figured out that we

      Hmmm... interesting concept. You could enter one "here" and
      they would warp you "there" (back to the beginning/end of
      the stage).
      Actually, it would be cool to have these black holes pulling you
      in. The closer you get, the more they pull... I like it!!
>laser jamming stations
      Another interesting idea. Should at least give the player the
      chance to take 'em out, so it would be best if the jamming
      effect increased the closer you are to them. I like this too!!
>smegging asteroid fields (always good) 
      There is an entire phase devoted to a bunch of rocks...
>wierd spaceships launching poisonous gas clouds of death 
      Yes, and the gas cloud expands as it moves away from the
      alien. Expanding and dissipating, so if you move through it at
      max size, only minor damage is inflicted... this might work.
>space spiders making webs for you to fly into...
      Been watching ST a bit too long, haven't you? HA! Yes, this is
      certainly original and would be quite easy to implement in the
      shooter. I don't want to "steal" this from your SH stage, so let
      me know what you think. Status pending...

   GREAT work Keith, you have all but completed the Phase One
   design. THANKS!! That's one less thing for me to do (HA!).


>One thing with the shooter stage, make sure you move the

>porridge.  Speed > Smoothness. 

   Too smooth? I don't think they could be too SMOOTH. If I had my
   way, I would make this stage just for A1200 w/FastRAM or BETTER
   so we'd get 50/60 fps of smooth-as-silk animation.

   However, I will be dropping back to 25/30fps and using "jumpy"
   bobs, so everyone is happy... (not too mention it makes it that
   much easier on myself!!) :-)


>(looks like we ended up working on a game together anyway..)
   Yes, and the artists are still working so, I'll let you know when I
   receive the remaining gfx...


         Take care,

            Garfield

For my money, the best scrolling shooter is the original defender,
which looks and feels blindingly fast.  A lot of later ones feel much
slower, even though in programmer terms they are faster.  Perhaps simple
weighting on the joypad controls, so you move faster the longer you hold
it down would help.  More sensitive controls ?

Mine will be (shortly) shooting straight at the player.  Move that Bubba
out the way !

Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.  Remember people can only SEE about 24
frames per second, you'll get the balance right.  'jumpy' bobs are bad, but
they must feel fast.  The flightplans will take care of that.  No one pixel
increments..

Yup, thought you might..  Crank up those thrusters.  Hmm, there's an idea. 
Thought about having a speed control on the ship ?  Or just a thrust button ?

They could even fire actual lasers directly at you...  (rotten alien gits)
Hmm, think I'll have a laser field generating thingy at the end of one of my
levels as well.  Cool.

I was going to grab a lot more ideas from ST..  Decloaking ships, phasers,
photon torpedos, cubes trying to assimilate Bubba's ship..  Space Stations ??

Ok, I'll see if I can figure out the way to do it for the SH stage and see
how it works out.  If it's really cool, an earlier idea may spoil it, or
enhance the tension.  Not sure how that'll go.

Cool.  I'll post more spider ideas for the graphic guys later.  (That was a
hint, we both want spiders !!)  Actually, on the thing-with-too-many-legs
subject, how about some nice big unfriendly insects to blow the smeg out 
of ?  

Music guys (or is it just EJS?): Just as a thought, are you leaving enough
channels free for soundFX for in game music ?  If I go with this spider idea
I'll also need some way creepy music.

Thought about having a speed control on the ship ?  Or just a thrust button ?

They could even fire actual lasers directly at you...  (rotten alien gits)
Hmm, think I'll have a laser field generating thingy at the end of one of my
levels as well.  Cool.

I was going to grab a lot more ideas from ST..  Decloaking ships, phasers,
photon torpedos, cubes trying to assimilate Bubba's ship..  Space Stations ??

Ok, I'll see if I can figure out the way to do it for the SH stage and see
how it works out.  If it's really cool, an earlier idea may spoil it, or
enhance the tension.  Not sure how that'll go.

No probs !

Cool.  I'll post more spider ideas for the graphic guys later.  (That was a
hint, we both want spiders !!)  Actually, on the thing-with-too-many-legs
subject, how about some nice big unfriendly insects to blow the smeg out 
of ?  

Music guys (or is it just EJS?): Just as a thought, are you leaving enough
channels free for soundFX for in game music ?  If I go with this spider idea
I'll also need some way creepy music.

That would be me.  I've been away for a while, but I'm back now (hopefully). 
I've had my PC stolen from work so I only get to read mail from home on my
miggy - usually about 200 messages at a time.

Sorry for the delay, I've just had too much on lately to code anything.  I'll
send something as soon as it's worth sending.

I am considering developing a Stellar 7 -style game, and I need 3D
projection routines for that. I have read that a basic projection
formula would be:
Xscreen = (D*X)/(Z+D)
Yscreen = (D*Y)/(Z+D)
where X, Y and Z are the 3D coordinates and D is the distance of the
eye from the screen. However, these routines tend to elongate objects
in the distance. Is there any way to use more realistic formulas?

Anyone knows something about this?

Is it possible to reinstall only the amaleditor?

When I load the amaleditor from my Amosbackup the same error occurs.

Is it possible to aquire only the amaleditor somewhere?

(I don't use Amal that much but sometimes the 'play' function
is good)

I'm thinking of two things.
1. Save game position. Nothing worse than having to start from the beginning
every time.
2. Home Computer Mode. We all bought home computers to get away from the
quarter feeding mentality, but so many games are still written as if you need
to shove a quarter in to continue. Maybe a menu that will let you play any
stage. You would not be able to complete the game this way, but you could at
least experience every level.

I think we've settled on the idea of music for the title and end credits
(nach) but, during the game, you can choose either music (composed by EJ) or
sfx. The reason for this is the funky method AMOS uses for its music and
samples. This will get rid of at least one potential problem.

I can work fine in 3 channels (the title for CB is three channels except
for the opening) by the way. I don't know if I'm too keen on the music OR
sfx idea, is there anyone who plays a game that has only music? I always
switch on SFX... :/

It's just me.

>channels free for soundFX for in game music ?  If I go with this spider idea
>I'll also need some way creepy music.

Well, like I said in a previous post, I *can* make music in three channels
without too much problems, for me anyway. If I had the choice of playing
with only music or only sound fx I would always choose the latter, so I'm
not too keen on that idea.

The music quality needn't suffer, I could always mix some samples or rely
on some devious trickery like I did in the intro music to cram everything
in the number of channels available to me.

But I'm downloading the DOOM music extension at the moment from Mushy's
page, and maybe that adds some commands that we can use. I mean, it's free
so anyone can use it. But the real advantage could be that I could use
Digibooster to, say, make music in 4 channels and you could use a 5th
channel for the sound fx (digibooster supports up to 128 channels). I don't
know if this will work and if this won't hog the CPU, but I'll look into
this.

Oh btw, you can find the THX extension at his page aswell, so if you can't
listen to the CB title music and can't be bothered to download THX than
grab this and play it in Amos. I'd like to know what you guys think of the
title tune.

Er, yes, that's one thing you can't do with THX. :) But thanks! I'll
convert it to PT format after I'm done with the other tunes (converting is
very easy since you can run the two programs simultaneously).

If we only use MODs, I've never had any problem playing samples while the mod
plays. The manual says this will crash the system and that only using amos
music banks will allow it, but the opposite is true, as almost anything will
crash an amos music bank tune. We could put in a music/music+fx/fx option
then. I know I always turn the music off, myself.  Maybe I'll put a juke box
option in the options screen as well so they can all hear all of EJ's cool
tunes.

>But I'm downloading the DOOM music extension at the moment from Mushy's
I looked at it, it didn't strike me as all that useful, but maybe some of you
others will experiment with it and give us a better review.

Its not the Editor thats the problem, its your program thats on it.
(at least that is what it sounds like from your description) 

No jumps allowed in the middle of a loop comes up when you try to 
jump into a loop (FOR NEXT for example) from outside it with 
Goto/Gosub etc. It also comes up for other similar things I believe.

Hey Everyone!

	I need some help with music and graphics for a C&C clone I am writing.
	It is set on a imaginary world and is a fantasy scenerio about a war
between two races that 	eventually involves every race on the planet.
	The game is much more involved that C&C, in that you have to manage
everything, horses, 	cattle, weapons, etc.

	The graphics style is more like C&C than Warcraft, with groups of
soldiers, and realistic 	graphics, instead of the cartoony style of
Warcraft.

	Any help will be appreciated.  

	Thank you (In advance).

	- J. Templeton

Well, I may be wrong here, but if I'm not mistaken Amos just plays the
sample through the module... so say you have a chord in one channel, Amos
plays the SFX in that channel, half your music is gone for one pattern.

And maybe the jukebox idea is good for when you have completed the game...
after the elaborate and awesome endsequence & final credits and fireworks
you can listen to all the music, read some text from all the people
involved etc...

Well, at the moment it doesn't support sampleplaying yet with some of the
musicprograms where this could be useful (like Digibooster) but the author
says in a readme that this may be included in a future version.

>Title tune is cool. did you grab the Cap'n Bubba sample?

Yes I did. :) I was planning on sampling my own masculine voice (ahem :)
but my sampler is on the fritz :/ So I'll abuse your vocals instead. :)

The most annoying being the sample looping problem if you flick back to
workbench or whatever.  Drives me up the wall that one.

Hmmmm. I've never found that to be the case.
Playing Sound FX over AMOS music banks works fine (sometimes there is 
a bit of corrpution but you barely notice) and playing sounds over 
MODS (tracker or MED) just doesn't work at all.
Personally, I use AMCAF commands to play sound over Protracker 
tunes which seems to work perfectly.

Theres been a lot of people over the last few months that have said 
various things about sound on AMOS. Everyone seems to get different 
results and different problems.

OH!!!
I know what you mean. Have you recently updated AMOS to a new version.
There was one version which suddenly introduced a new error check and 
stopped you doing something to do wiht jumping in/out of loops.
I know that several (old and baddly programmed) programs of mine had 
to be adjusted to compensate.

Find the bug and see if you can change it.

Subject: Re: Need 3D projection routines

Hi,

Try this:

    _zoom=256
    lens=256
    distance=_zoom-z

    X_Screen = (lens*(x/distance))+cx
    Y_Screen = cy-(lens*(y/distance))

Where cx and cy are the coordinates of the centre of the screen.
This method seems to cause some problems when objects are "behind" the
camera, so be careful not to draw any point with distance<=0 (and 0 will mess
up the division anyway).

This gives you a 3D system with Cartesian x and y axes plus a z-axis sticking
out towards you. Crappy ASCII diagram follows:

          Y
          |
          |
          |
          0----------> X
         /
        /
       Z


While I'm at it, here's some rotation formulae:

To rotate a point about the world Y-axis:

            sang=sin(angle) : cang=cos(angle)            
            tempx = (x * cang) + (z * sang)
            tempz = (z * cang) - (x * sang)
            y=tempy
            z=tempz

(obviously some of these are floats, so stick the necessary # signs in in
Amos)

To rotate a point about the camera Y-axis (ie when you turn, rotate the
object
around the camera in the opposite direction):

            dz = z - _zoom
            tempx = (x * cang) + (dz * sang)
            tempz = ((dz * cang) - (x * sang)) + _zoom
            x=tempx
            y=tempy

Rotations about the other axes can be derived from these. If you're still
stuck,
let me know and I'll see if I can help you further.

I was wondering how do you program door games for BBSs in amos, I have
attempted different things, but none of them work.

I do know it is possible though, a game called Labby made for MaxsBBS was
made in AMOS. I tried contacting the guy who made it but I got no reply.

Well, thanx in advance
