DirDropper:
-----------

CHILLS NOTE:
I've ALWAYS wanted one of these! Since I have quite a collection of
modules (Over 140 disks) it's not very fun when (not IF) my Module-
list crashes. Therefore I made this utility which allows you to
list your directory to a file of your choice. Quite practical...
Please - DONT try to recode this to handle CD-Roms! It wont work!!!
AmosPro just cant handle it! (Which is stupid, btw)...

REGISTRATION:
You can register at the adress below, just send me $10 or 50 SEK.
You will receive free updates as soon as I make them!

USAGE:
You must insert your disk in "DF0:" - the rest of the program should
be self-explanatory...Note that your destination-disk (for the listfile)
may be an assign, disk, or drawer...(Personally, I prefer "RAM:")
If the destination does not exist, DirDropper will ask you again.
Examples of legal destinations:
RAM:
LIBS:
AMOS PROGRAMS:
WORK:
DH0:Text/Lists/

SPEED?
It's REALLY fast. At least thats what I think. The only thing
you have to do is to press a key when DirDropper asks you for the
next disk. I think it takes about 5 seconds to list a disk...(max)

ERRORS:
Oh my god! I've got an error on my disks!!! Anyway, IF Dirdropper
would crash or is unable to read your disks, the file is still
saved. Just exit AMOS, rename the saved file to something else,
fix your disk and run DirDropper again to continue....You can always
JOIN or APPEND the two "broken" listfiles, so you get a complete list.
If you have any questions about how to do this, please write to me.

FILE FORMAT:
Hmmm. Well, there is always something, isn't it! When Amos saves text
to a file, it puts an inverted M at the end of all the lines, but
I've found that most textviewers don't care about them, and if you don't
want to have them there, just enter a texteditor and SEARCH/REPLACE...

PROBLEMS?
I hope everything works fine, but if it don't, write to me:

Just a phonecall away on : +46 (0)472 61492

SPECIFY YOUR PROBLEMS! "It wont run!" could mean anything!
I would also appreciate if you send some technical stuff regarding
kickstart, version of AMOS, and so on...

                    What the future holds in it's wake
                    ----------------------------------

*       Shut-Up mode, which disconnects the Bell and Boom-command
*       Fast mode, which allows you to speed through the selectors
*       Append new list to old one. This however, demands that you
        haven't changed the old one (taken away the M's at the end)...
*       Multiple drive handler. It will search for the disks "50:", "51:",
        "52:" rather than "Df0:"
*       Timer function, checks how long your list took.
