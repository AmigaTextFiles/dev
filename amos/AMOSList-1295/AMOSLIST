Well, normally it isn't personal taste but sheer userfriendlyness to put
the Wait Vbl outside the loop and use Multi Wait instead Wait Vbl where
possible.

The easyiest answer is get the hardware refernece library and look it 
up. the RKM is a godsend, but heres what you need to do :)

	Peek the value at $BFD200 - the direction register for CIAB
	Bset bit 7 of the value
	Poke the value to $BFD200 - 
	
	Peek the value at $BFD000 - the data regiuster for CIAB
	Bclr or Bset bit 7 of the value
	Poke the value to $BFD000

	Err.. That should do the trick...

	Some extra info for you boffins out there..

	Address  Bits 7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
	$BFD000      DTR RTS CD  CTS DSR SEL Pout Busy
	$BFE101      parrell port raw data
	$BFD300      direction: 1=output, 0=input
	$BFE301      direction of each bit of parrell port,


	Hope that helps, If not get back to me.

Hello to all!

I am a newbie to Ami & AMOS, but think it is a great tool. I have had 
experience in peecee assembly, fortran, and C . Now I hope to use that 
training to designing a bunch of FUN stuff with AMOS! I have Amos Pro and 
think it is wonderful. I also have the Amos compiler, and AMos 3D.

Soooo...here come a few questions:

I have tried to install the (old) compiler and 3D, but it seems to need 
Amos 1.3 :(. Is there any way to get around this and use them for AmosPro?
I spent some time trying to fenagle it, but didnt want to waste too much 
time when a wizard here would know. :)

If not, will there be a 3D for Pro realeased? Anyone have , or know of, a 
used copy of the Pro compiler for sale?
----
I've noticed speech will not work while an animation is playing, or can 
it be done in amos?


That's all for now!

Hi to everybody out there that reads this list.

I've just started subscribing to this list as well, and have been using Amos 
since it's release in Australia. I also have Amos Pro, the Compiler, Amos 3D 
and virtually every other Amos thing here.

I ran the Amos Special Interest Group in Canberra for sometime, until people 
lost interest.

I've been struggling to write arcade style games for some time and are 
having trouble getting material on how to do it, or example code. Is there 
anybody listening that could point me in the right direction? I tried 
ordering the amos Game Makers guide, but could not get it in this country. 
HELP!!!

I've also written a boot disk maker utility that was affective, and soem 
simple arcade games. I'm also trying to put together a disk magazine at the 
moment...

Anyway, thanks for your time and I hope someone can help me out there.

See ya!

     Greetings, I have read the 'latest news' in AmosPro where it explains
how to install 1.3 compiler. It was painstaking but I finally compiled 
something ONCE.  After that time I compiled a 1.3 compatible prog, I 
never got the compiler to work again and I dunno why or what's wrong. AmosPro
loads w compiler extension on (proversion) and checking the config shows 
I got the file and its all there, it just won't work :(

Hi!
     I'm new to the list (though old to amos!!) and have a question....
I've written a front-end for a robotics program, But want to use the
parallel port for output. The problem im having is that i dont want to use a
sophisticated interface. With IBMS (GASP!!!!) you can just, Eg in
quickbasic, Use out XXXX ect, But im not sure how to do this in amos. AMOS
seems to be very
fussy about the control lines!!!! I am using amos 1.3. 

Also, does anybody have any FTP sites for Amos Extentions.

Thanx in advance,

All you want can be simply done as below:

Poke data,Address of the parallel port.

This should be OK for you using Amos 1.3. Amos Pro has some commands to 
manage directly the parallel port such as Parallel Send....

No no no no no! I don't think so... Not at all!!! There are two things to
do.... First, you must tell the parallell port that you are writing data OUT
of it (As you can read and write through the parallel port) then you must
Poke Address_Of_Port,Data : NOT the other way round, which will almost
certainly crash the poor little AMIGA.

I wrote a smilair program a while back... I'll have a look for it, and send
it you if I stil have it!!!

Good luck!

I did a stop frame animation of figures against a dark background. The
dark background was supposed to digitize to colour 0. But it came out
a mottled sort of darkish background.

I would like to write a program which examines each frame pixel by pixel.
If none of the neighboring pixels reach a certain luminance then it would
change the pixel to colour 0 in the new frame. Thus I could change the
mottled background to solid colour zero while sparing the lighter figures
in the foreground.

However I don't know how to read the luminance from a pixel. All I can
do is use C=point(x,y) to get an apparently arbitrary colour number. To
complicate matters the animation is in HAM. Can someone help me with
this?

  The way I'd do it is this.  First find the R, G, and B values for each
pixel.  Then imagine a cube with a side length of 16 (or 256, depending on
how much color data you have) and, for each pixel, find the "distance"
between the point (0,0,0) and the point (R,G,B); in other words, calculate
sqrt(R*R + G*G + B*B).  That results in a "luminance" value from zero to 16
(or 256).  To save time, you can cut out the square root step and just work
with the square of the luminance.  I don't know whether there's a better
method, or even whether this method is an accepted way of doing this - but
it's what I'd do.  Shrug.

I have regular Amos. I was skeptical about Amos Pro because to me it
seemed that Mandarin or whoever was trying to pick the pockets of
those who had already bought the Amos product. They are not selling
enough to newcomers so they turn around and come up with this "new"
product to sell to people already using Amos.

I have also heard that it's not any faster or better. I suppose it 
have some new commands, but I don't know of what they might be to
motivate me to plunk down fresh cash. I have not heard that it was any
less buggy than regular Amos. In fact lately people are having
compatibility problems with compilers etc. How irritating that the
marketing pros divided a decent product.

What is different about Amos Pro?

I have archived them and uploaded them to AmiNet.  They should be available
soon.  There are not many due to the downtime during the last half of
November.

Filename is AMOSList-1195.lzh and should be in dev/amos

I apologize for the downtime again. Now, let's get those AMOS coding

Aminet CD's. But at last I have got myself on-line and can join in.
First off I must say how sensible most people are, I like to see people
asking things like 'How do I hide the mouse pointer' and getting sensible
responses and not 'elite' type people laughing and taking the p***.

Anyway I think I will start off with a few questions of my own, no laughing
you at the back!

a) Does anyone know a way of iconifying an Amos program?
   i.e. Flip to Workbench and leave an icon on it that the user can double
        click on to return to the Amos program. A lot to ask I know,
        maybe a window type title bar with gadgets would work just as well?

b) How much is, and where do I get Andy Churches' Intuition Extension?

c) Any ideas on how to pass Tooltypes information to Amos from an icon?

d) Does anyone have file format descriptions of Bmp,Jpeg,Pic and any other
   picture file format? This is for the author of BlackBoard, he can't
   use datatypes for one reason or another. I have found GIF,PCX & IFF
   descriptions anybody got any others please?

Now some Amos product info:

AGA EXTENSION:
The AGA extension previously sold by Amiganuts (who have now gone bust)
is being sold by F1 Licenceware i.e. Me! It now costs 3.99 instead of the
previous price of 10. As you all probably know the extension does NOT
support bobs/sprites etc. And is basically for novelty value at the moment.
However, if there is sufficent interest in the extension it MAY be improved.
The extension was written by Nigel Critten (Now working for Escom
apparently) for Micheal Prince for use in one of Michael's games. I don't
know what the game was, before you ask. Basically Micheal paid Nigel for his
time and only the features that Michael needed were implemented. That is why
it seems only half an extension. For the extension to be upgraded will cost
Michael a lot of money and he is trying to muster some of it up through the
sale of this early version. That's what he told me. Just thought it was
about time the truth was known about this extension. AmigaNuts apperently
did not honour orders of the extension and M withdrew it and asked F1 to do
the bizzo on it, so there you are!

AMOS PRO COMPILER RELEASED:
I have today signed an agreement with Europress to distribute a special F1
Licenceware version of the Amos Pro Compiler v2. The disks will be the same
the manual will be the same the box is gone and in it's place is a cheap old
plastic sleeve, aha but that allows F1 to sell the compiler at less than
half the price of the original which was 34.99 as I recall. The F1 version
costs a very reasonable 14.99. Before you all start, I tried very hard to
get the bugs fixed but Epress just are not interested, nor Francois!
If sales go well I have the option of realesing Amos Pro during 1996.
Take no notice of the bull**** in Amiga Shopper about Ultimate Software
releasing the 5 Amos packages, THIS IS NOT TRUE. As far as I can find out
this 'news story' was sent in by Ultimate themselves.
I have that straight from Ian McFegan, head gezzer of Europress himself
that Ultimate will NOT be getting the Amos packages.

AMOSZINE:
You may or may not of heard of AmosZine. It is an Amos disk mag (nah!)
currently on issue 9. It is supported mainly by F1 Licenceware coders
and we need your help. See current Amiga Shopper for a demo version or
in Dev/Amos/ on the Aminet it should be there soon. It contains full
details of how to submit articles/source etc. And best of all major
contributers get it FREE.

Hello again :)

After posting my last message about AMOS Pro I now find out that it was
full of rubbish about 'Ultimate Software' well please take no notice of
what I said ;) and instead get in touch with 'Steve Bye' of F1 Licenceware
for details of the AMOS Pro distribution.

As I said it's well worth updating AMOS to the new version and even more
important that you start using the new AMOS Pro compiler. If people like
Steve get enough good responce for this product then the future of AMOS
might become more nicer than not being very nice, not that it's not already
nice but things could be more on the nice side ;) I think it's past my
bed time :-O

Thanks,

  IRC is a nice place - if you "know" who you're chatting with.  I
routinely chat with about 10 other people also involved in an online story
I'm working on, and as far as that goes, it's great.

>> b) How much is, and where do I get Andy Churches' Intuition Extension?

  The registration cost is $15; I can E-mail the demo version.

  Well, they never promised us the source.  In fact, they refused to lift a
finger to help us...

You must have been reading Usenet, or (SHOCK, HORROR - so I have heard) IRC.

There's a small program on Aminet, written by one of the Mikes I believe, 
that'll do just that. If I remember correctly, it has some hard to 
remember name, like IDCMPXYZGFAJ.lha (great help I am, right?).
You probably could achieve the same with Andy's Intuition Extension.

> b) How much is, and where do I get Andy Churches' Intuition Extension?

I think Andy should best answer this, but I'd just like to add (for the 
fourth time in three weeks) that I have published a review of this 
extension in the Dutch mag Amiga Magazine, which (the article, not the 
mag) can also be dl'ed as 
FTP://ftp.mpi.nl/bcollin/leisure/intui-ext/intext-uk.txt. This article 
also mentions price and address.

The description of PNG should be floating around, as it's a PD or 
Freeware format. Try the folks at Cloanto (of Personal Paint fame), who 
helped develop it. Jpeg, same story. There are some newsgroups concerned 
with file-formats, their FAQ can undoubtedly help you further.

No, we don't know. I seem to remember some people mentioning that they 
wanted to buy it, but never any reports after the buy. Could you list its 
features? Also, wasn't Chris Hodges working on AGA stuff for his extension?

Well, keep those rumours coming :-). If you're so close to the head 
honcho at Europress, could you check out why the Amos Development Team 
(all Amos-list subscribers) did not get the promised Amos source code 
after all?

I posted this message a while back along with some source code for a

I'll upload the sterogram program to aminet soon....
but check out my most recent upload "Bambigod.lzh" to aminet in the
animation directory. You'll have to do a search or look thru the files, as
it's no longer in the 7 day upload area.

Glad to see the list back working!  Actually, I said that in my last 
email which never appeared on it, so hope I'm not pushing my luck 
again!  ;-)

Not exactly AMOS related, but I read in the Escom catalogue that 
Commodore are now making PCs!  Have they been doing that long?  Also, 
it was nice t see the A1200 back on sale but it was a shame it got 
such little space and that there was no A4000/30 or something.  Is 
the A1200 the only one being made or did they just leave the other(s) 
out?

There's a new group on Usenet called alt.religion.amos with absolutely
no traffic. Shall we move in and take it over? Kind of like crashing
a party, except- there is nobody there!

If there is still no traffic there in a couple days, I will go and post
some of my ridiculously bad Amos games and demos in UUE form.

I hope the amos religion is not a satanic cult who will cast spells on
me for trangressing in their group. :~)

This message is mainly meant for Michael Cox, but you're welcome to share it
with me :). How is the AMOS buglist getting on? I sent two certified bugs to
you eons ago, but I haven't heard anything since. Are you still working on them
or ...? 

Completely off-topic, does anyone know about an extension solely dedicated to
handling strings? I know AMOS has some impressive functions, but I lack 
certain advanced features, like patternmatching and automatic wrap arounds of
long pieces of text. FYI, I use AMOS 1.36.

Easylife has fairly extensive patternmatching.

 a> What is different about Amos Pro?

Well, the differences exist and are not too few. I can say it because I had
AMOS The Creator in the past and I've used Amos Pro for the last months.
Well, first of all, the Workbench compatibility. You certainly know that

Amos
The Creator doesn't work very well with workbench and using Intuition with
it
can be hard and guru frequent. This is solved quite totally in Amos Pro.
Then Amos Pro has other advantages: new commands, but not just: it allows
animation; it owns a new way to display gadget and requester; you can
monitor
your progra, to check errors; you can add new menus; the editor is much
improved.... and the list could go on for a long!! :-)

Of course it isn't totally bug-free (but which is perfect??).

BTW, you can find just one good reason to get Amos Pro: AMCAF extension!!
And not just, but also Intuition extension (the Creator version is
impossible
to be used up to now!) and the Pro compiler that can be runned on your
current program.

Of course there are also other positive things: but these are the most!!

Bye.

 > Hello everyone,

Hello!!!

 a> I have been reading this list from afar for quite a while now, through
 a> the Aminet CD's. But at last I have got myself on-line and can join in.

 a> Anyway I think I will start off with a few questions of my own, no
 a> laughing you at the back!

Very well.

 a> a) Does anyone know a way of iconifying an Amos program?
 a> i.e. Flip to Workbench and leave an icon on it that the user can double
 a> click on to return to the Amos program. A lot to ask I know,
 a> maybe a window type title bar with gadgets would work just as well?

Well, this is very easy to be done, but just if you have got Easylife
extension by Paul Hickman. You can get it on Aminet in dev/amos: it's spit

in
three different archives plus one patch. Get all four and install it. Then,
the command to be used is: =Eliconify Amos(X,Y,T$)   or
=Eliconify Begin(X,Y,T$) . These are two functions and they allow you to
choose the X and Y coords and the text of the window. Then, they return
a different value that says how you went back to Amos.

 a> b) How much is, and where do I get Andy Churches' Intuition Extension?

Well, it's 15 US dollars, and in the next weeks (I HOPE...) should be
available the next version (1.3b)

 a> c) Any ideas on how to pass Tooltypes information to Amos from an icon?

You have to use another extension: AMCAF by Chris Hodges. Get it on Aminet
in
the same directory.

 a> Now some Amos product info:

 a> AGA EXTENSION:
 a> The AGA extension previously sold by Amiganuts (who have now gone bust)
 a> is being sold by F1 Licenceware i.e. Me! It now costs 3.99 instead of
the
 a> previous price of 10. As you all probably know the extension does NOT
 a> support bobs/sprites etc. And is basically for novelty value at the
 a> moment.

Is it for Amos the Creator or Amos Pro (or both)???

 a> However, if there is sufficent interest in the extension it MAY be
 a> improved.

I've heard it's just a group of procedure that sims an extension: is it
true??

 a> For the extension to be upgraded will cost
 a> Michael a lot of money and he is trying to muster some of it up through
 a> the sale of this early version.

Money??? Has he to pay to code an extension?? Think about AMCAF (the best)
or
Intuition: they are shareware and you can have a demo version before buying
register: this is the RIGHT way!! :-)

 a> AmigaNuts apperently did not honour orders of the extension and
 a> M withdrew it and asked F1 to do the bizzo on it, so there you are!

Well, I think it's NOT known. I mean: here on the list, noone speak about
it.
Do you want to sell it?? Then upload a demo on Aminet in dev/amos/ with
some
features disabled and check how many people get it and want to register!!
I did it with Intuition and AMCAF and I'm happy since I paid for something
that I knew!

 a> AMOS PRO COMPILER RELEASED:
 a> I have today signed an agreement with Europress to distribute a special
 a> F1 Licenceware version of the Amos Pro Compiler v2. The disks will be
the
 a> same, the manual will be the same the box is gone and in it's place
 a> is a cheap old plastic sleeve, aha but that allows F1 to sell the
 a> compiler at less than half the price of the original which was 34.99
 a> as I recall.

So no differences??? No bugs corrected???

 a> The F1  version costs a very reasonable 14.99. Before you all start, I
 a> tried very hard to get the bugs fixed but Epress just are not
 a> interested nor Francois! If sales go well I have the option of
 a> releasing Amos Pro during 1996.

I hope to earn a lot for you, but this sounds difficult if no changes were
made.... :-((

 a> AMOSZINE:
 a> You may or may not of heard of AmosZine. It is an Amos disk mag (nah!)
 a> currently on issue 9. It is supported mainly by F1 Licenceware coders
 a> and we need your help. See current Amiga Shopper for a demo version or
 a> in Dev/Amos/ on the Aminet it should be there soon. It contains full
 a> details of how to submit articles/source etc. And best of all major
 a> contributers get it FREE.

What's in??

Bye and thanks.

I have tried to upload some Amos stuff to Aminet but I never see it 
anywhere after I upload it. I thought, hey, maybe Urban Mueller thought it
was crap, but there are loads of worse crap already on Aminet. I only
ul'd an LHA file, is it required that the "*.readme" file be ul'd as well?

Yes. I have no idea why it disappeared on me for awhile. Of course, I've 
been largely lurking of late. I'm busier lately with playing with Imagine 
4.0.

How's your game coming? I'm dying to try it out. Did you upgrade to 
Imagine 4.0 for your raytrace graphics in your games? The latest version 
has added a lot of much-needed features.

Does you game use joystick/mouse at all or is it a keyboard game? Or all 
three? *8^)

I never claimed I was 'close' to the head honcho at Epress, I have had
dealings with them for the compiler and a few chats that is all.
I stated in an earlier posting that Francois is trying to sell (rumour)
the source code to Amos Pro/All Amos stuff? Which would be a good
explanation as to why Epress were slightly reluctant to give it away!
Name a business that gives it's products blueprints away? (in the real world)
Wether they use/need the product is irrelevent surely?

it that my messages aren't getting through?

Oh? How's that? For my review of the Intuition Extension I only tested 
the creator version, which worked fine except for two bugs that Andy has 
now ironed out. I couldn't test the Pro-version as I only have the 
coverdisk Pro, and that doesn't work with the extension (I believe that's 
Amos Pro 1.12, but I am not sure).

I recently got hold of an LHA archive that contained the AMOS.Library in

I guess the list is on the fritz again, huh? I sent out a couple posts
regarding my image processing woes, but neither went through. Briefly:
I now know how to get a 3 character hex string from an HAM pixel but
I don't know how to pull numeric values from each character to average
out to set the brightness threshold for my processing program.

Hope this goes through.

production let alone Amos. And you can buy the source code from him ;)
It's had good reviews in the press including a re-review in the Xmas 
Amiga 'Gone down hill a bit' Format where they reckon it's in the Top-Ten 
Aminet downloads.

There's some other junk there too. I ought to see if i can get a demo of 
FAME, a damn fine map editor, put there too.

Enjoy (hopefully) the stuff and give me plenty of feedback please...

   HAM mode uses a base of 16 colors.  AMOS treats these like the colors of

any ordinary 16 color screen.  A color index value of 0-15 in AMOS 
functions refers to one of these base colors.
   HAM stands for 'Hold And Modify'.  To display its thousands of colors, 
HAM 'Holds' the value of a pixel and allows you to 'Modify' the red, green,

or blue value of the pixel to the right of it.  Color index values 16-63 
refers to the value the previous pixel is modified by:

  values 16-31: replace previous BLUE value  (new intensity=value-16)
  values 32-47: replace previous RED value   (new intensity=value-32)
  values 48-63: replace previous GREEN value (new intensity=value-48)

Example:
  Color 1,$fff        <- set index 1 to all white 
  Plot 1,1,1          <- plot white pixel on screen
  Plot 2,1,50         <- modifies the green value of the previous pixel to
a 
                         very dim value.  This second pixel will be very 
                         magenta.

So... If you are trying to find the RGB value of a point on a HAM screen, 
its a tad messy.  You have to keep checking points to the left until you 
find a base color; reach the beginning of the line; or come across a 
modified red, green, and blue value.  Here's a rough outline that sould
work:

CHECK THE CURRENT POINT
   if it has index value 0-15
      use the colour function to get the RGB value
      if this is not your first check
         modify with the value(s) you are keeping track of
      DONE
   else
      if you are not keeping track of this color already
         remember the modified color and intensity
         if you are now keeping track of a red, green, and blue value
            use this value with the other ones you have
            DONE
      if this is the first horizontal pixel
         use the value(s) you have, and use 0 for the missing one(s)
         DONE
      else
         move one pixel to the left, and GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING

I did once write a recursive procedure that did this but it was painfully 
slow and I deleted it. :}

Hello everybody,

I'm new on this list. I wondered if anyone can help me with the 
following. I'm trying to program an absolutely professional 
horizontal text-scroller, not jerking even on an 68000 A500. 
The text has to be at least 16x16 big, preferably hires.
I tried several ways: Scroll, hardware scrolling, screen copying.
Some worked fine until I added extra screens. Anyone out there
who can give me a hint or routine?
Thanks very much!

Hi all,

Just a quick not to explain to you all about the new adition to the
growing support for amos. A friend and myself have started a new
UseNET newsgroup called 'alt.religion.amos' the group has been started
as a sort of aditional site to the amos-list.

Differences to this amos-list.

1. Source code and any other amos related material can be sent up to
   a maximum of 50k, so if you want to post it there and leave a message
   in the amos-list it will give you an alternative to uploading to
   your source code to Aminet.
2. Some people prefer to use a news based system like Thor, Tin, Grn or
   any other news batch reading system that groups messages together in
   threads rather than having all the messages in an email list.
3. It's possible to browse through the list of articles, downloading the
   most interesting subjects and leaving out the lengthy source code
   files or even downloading the source code files only.
4. UseNET should be available 365 days of the year without any breaks so
   you can be sure of some contact with people at any time.
5. It's available to people who don't have an email account but do have
   access to the internet on occations say via an internet cafe or
   university, library or work.

Bad points.

1. Some people won't be able to post or recieve to the group because some
   Internet providers wont support 'alt.religion.amos' at the moment but
   this will correct itself in time. You could even get in touch with
   your internet provider if you want them to support it. I know for a
   fact that Demon Internet will give you access.
2. I'm sure some people are getting this list through BBS style email or
   via Aminet CD's only or from another site that doesn't support UseNET
   so this list will always give a wider range of users.
3. Because it's UseNET it is open for abuse from non amos users which is
   why I'm asking you now to help me out by posting to the site.

So there are good points and bad points but I'm sure it will atract some
users that maybe don't like the mailing list approach or maybe wan't to
use the UseNET on a once a week basis or even just browse it for the
articles that sound interesting.

You are encoraged to use both the UseNET and mailing list, I don't own
the UseNET group I'm only getting it started so please help me to get
it off to a good start by posting a question, article, sorce code, news,
amos related adverts or even uuencoded amos extentions or any other
UUencoded amos related stuff but try to keep such things below 50k for
now.

You will also find a faq at the site which will give you the current rules
for posting. The rules were writen by a friend and myself and are only
a rough start to get things going. If you have any ideas for what we could
change or add let me know. I'm trying to find out if you would rather have
Ascii style source code posted or UUencoded '.AMOS' style code so please
post me a quick message giving me this and any other ideas you might have.


If you can get in touch via the UseNET group because the first few weeks
can be set for discusion on how the group will be used and the rules can
be changed to suit it's users needs.

Thank You,

Well, Easylife has both the abilities: either patternmatching, either some
very fast and useful string routines. It's by Paul Hickman.
It works also with Amos The Creator and you can get it on Aminet in

dev/amos.
It's mada by 3 different archives plus one patch.

Enjoy it!!

The most recent?? The one on AMinet works also with Amos The Creator (or
better, so it's written in the doc, but I didn't test!)

Well, I dont' know. When I got the Intuition extension, I couldn't use it
with AmosPro, since it requires version 2.0 of AmosPro. So I installed it
on
my Amos The Creator: they were my worst days; bugs, gurus, everything
possible happened. Then I got AmosPro v2.0 and I installed the Pro version:
another world and a new life!! Yes, it has got bugs and thing to be
improved
(for example, the Iwindow Open Wb opens a window, but it doesn't make it
active!), but it's usable. Even because AmosPro is much more "compatible"
with workbench. And Andy himself told me that the Creator version was
terrible...

But which version of Intuition are you using??

Hey Andy, when will we have the new one??

Hmmh... this should be "Poke address,data" but I think it's not that

What is different about Amos Pro?. I can't leave this uncommentated ;-)

D0> I have also heard that it's not any faster or better.

The compiled programs /are/ faster due to the optimizing AMOS Pro
compiler.

D0> I suppose it have some new commands,

e.g DPaint-Animation replaying, serial/printer commands, library commands,
device commands etc.

D0> I have not heard that it was any

It doesn't have fewer bugs, but other bugs from Amos have been corrected.
;-))

D0> In fact lately people are having compatibility problems with compilers

Eh? :-?

D0> What is different about Amos Pro?

It's editor is *much* better than the Creator one, and once you got into
it, you'll never touch the creator again. It comes with a vast amout of
example programs and procedures and it contains a lot new commands.

Moreover, some extensions are only available for AMOS Pro, and the older
Creater ones are not supported anymore.

I can only recommend you AMOS Pro.

The colours of 4 colour sprites are generally different from the colours
of the screen. I have never known why this is. I would like to make a
colour in one of my sprites glow with a flash command but I don't know how
to program this.

When I put a bob up on the screen and then I put another bob behind it I
cannot see the bob behind the first even if the first bob is mostly colour
zero. You see, I would like colour zero in the first bob to be transparent
so I could see the second bob beyond the image of the first. As it stands
quare blocks out everything behind the square. "set mask" does not seem to
address this problem.

Does anyone know how to listen to a 600k sample with the .wav suffix?

I checked out Michele's "fantasy" game in the "game/shoot" section of 
aminet, but I don't understand why I'm supposed to shoot at these
homeless people on the streets of a colourful city. And who is that
sinister person in the chartreuse hood that strolls across the screen
and why does it take four shots to kill him? Aside from these disturbing questions it is a colourful and unique game that I cannot fathom. Grazie, Signor!

And while I'm at it whoever posted to the amos-list that we should check
out the "Bambi meets Godzilla" animation on aminet should have mentioned
that it is a monstrous (700k) file and will not run on a 3.5 meg 1 Chip
RAM machine and in fact it appears to have little to do with amos.

Let me know when it's up there. I've got heaps of articles that I've

I haven't uploaded it yet as I only have Email at mo, prob join Internet
after Christmas (got to talk the missues into it first you see :-)
If anyone would be so kind to ul it for me I would appreciate it.
It is on last months Amiga Shopper cover disk along with Intos, it is PD
now even though it was an exclusive for AS at the time. If anyone does
upload it for me let me know and I will send you something nice by snail
mail, so give me your address in a private mailing.

Thanks Darryl, we need all the help we can get, Emailwill get on the next issue absolutely ANYTHING Amos related will probably be
used as long as it is new-ish/technically correct and above all interesting.
Andy Gibson (the Editor) will send you a free copy if you submit enough to

As it is only a rumour I am a bit loath to approach anyone at this stage.
I will try to mention it next time I talk to a big nob at Epress, which will
probably be a few months. If I do find out don't be surprised if it is 
silly money! i.e. Telephone numbers.


Re: The Aga extension/Pro Compiler

Just to clear this up once and for all, F1 Licenceware have the full legal
rights to sell the (ex-Amiganuts/Petra Software) Aga extension.
It is now 3.99. Though the previous seller appeared not to have honoured
some customer orders (fact! He ripped off my mates 10 and he is in for a
shock soon!) F1 Licenceware have been trading 2 years and have built up a
good/honest/reliable reputation with the mags/programmers and our customers.
YOU WILL NOT GET RIPPED OFF BY F1. Anything ordered goes out within 24hours.

F1 also have the full legal rights (a signed contract with Europress, with
Francois Lionets permisson) to distribute the Pro Compiler for a limited
period of time. It costs 14.99 (20.00 less than original price) and we
have to pay Epress a rather generous royalty on that. If you need to know
more your best bet is to get a free F1 cat disk I suppose I could Email you
one, once I get the hang of UU, I haven't tried it yet but think I can do
it. If I have any trouble I am sure someone will help me? I have only had a
modem a few weeks dudes!! So be gentle on me for now ;-)

To Andy Church:
Thanks Andy for the Intuition Extension Demo, looks really good.
Am I blind/daft/stupid/all of those? I can't find the price for the full
version in the docs. How much is it in sterling? Also how about a special F1
Licenceware version? Maybe an older full version? Just an idea. Not many
Amos users outside this list have even heard of your great extension and
it would serve as a great advert for you. Failing that I may be able to help
you get a full old version on a coverdisk. Only CU.Amiga reportedly pay
money for cover disks and that's only to the big boys apparently, the others
like Shopper/Format etc. You have to make your money by selling a
newer/fuller version. Just some ideas for you mate. 


To all:
Thanks for the loads of replies to my recent postings all appreciated and I
try to answer them all and quickly. I have had a few glitches at my bbs
and it is possible (prob my fault) that I have lost a few postings so ifI
haven't replied to anyones questions it is not through being ignorant I
assure you. Please repost anything I haven't answered.
One more thing I am real busy during the week and so only check my mail 
a few times so most of mty replies will come back on weekends.

Any Horse racing peeps out there? Over the past year or so I have been
tinkering with a game called Punter. I released a really crap version into
PD yonks ago (V1.0) I was dreedful but got a fair bit of interest since
there aren't many sensible racing games with intelligent form and graphical
races (1-4 players) Anyway, Punter is improving quite well though the code
is a right old mess what with me constantly hacking away at it. Where was I
? Yes, the main game isn't too bad, still needs a lot of work on it, which
I can do but for the life of me I can't get a relistic animated race that I
am happy with. The one I have is just passable but as the central attraction
of the game is the race I need help. Any good graphic artist/coder willing
to give it a shot? I will send you the code, but I can only give the source 
to one person at a time as it will get silly and confusing otherwise.

  Won't work.  Sam Raw only works for samples of length 64k-1 or less.
You'll have to use audio double buffering; there's an example in the AMOS
Pro manual, in section 8.3 I believe.  (If you don't have the Pro manual,
then maybe someone would be kind enough to post the code; I'm at college
currently and don't have my manual with me.)

Sprite colours are separate to screen colours on a 16 colour screen... I
think they are stored in colour registers 16-32.. or round about... So I
think It should be possible with a flash declaration like... 

	Flash 16, " {Declaration here!}

	Issue a "Make Mask" command!

Greetings DM9200@conrad.appstate.edu, you wrote some text on the subject
Misc, and now I'm going to answer it

The colours of the sprites are very strange. They can be altered using
colours 16-31, and are arranged like this:

Colours 16-19 are colours 0-3 on sprites 0 and 1
Colours 20-23 are colours 0-3 on sprites 2 and 3
Colours 24-27 are colours 0-3 on sprites 4 and 5
Colours 28-31 are colours 0-3 on sprites 6 and 7

And whilst I'm at it, I may as well make up a procedure to change the
colours...

Procedure _CHANGESPRITECOL [ SPR , SPRCOL , NEWCOL ]
   Colour (SPR/2)*4+16+SPRCOL , NEWCOL
End Proc

... where SPR is the sprite number, SPRCOL is the colour to change (0-3)
and NEWCOL is the $RGB to change it to.

Make sense?

Make Mask BOBNUM should do the trick.

Hope that's been of some help.

Well, it's the same thing, but:
You insert the library in the compiled program if you want to give it away,
this just because the program won't need installation and other people

won't
see it's made in AMOS.
You leave it out of the program if you compile the program just for
yourself.
In this way, you can save space on your hard disk and all your programs
will
be smaller.

I'm, but let me know: it's made in AMOS (I suppose, since it's in this
mailing list...): did you use for the mandelbrot and Julia sets the Craft
extension?? It allows very, very fast and easy routines for this job.

I have an idea for a command that you could add to AMCAF which is a very 
much needed one at that. The AMOSPro version of the LVO command doesn't 
work correctly and is very buggy and returns errors alot so I am 
suggesting a command similiar to this:

=Get Lvo "name.library","Name_of_Function"

This would be very helpful so that one could access and use external 
library calls with the help of this command one can get the Library 
Vector Offset which could be used in conjuction with the Lib Call command.

What do you think ? I know that there is the =Lvo("Name_of_Function") in 
AMOSPro, but it always returns an Equates not found error even tho it 
does find it. I have used SnoopDOS when using this command and I just 
can't explain why it is doing this and I have noticed that it has 
happened to others as well so it must be a bug with AMOSPro v2.00. This 
new command could rectify all of this.

  Ah, good point - .wav is stored in unsigned 8-bit samples rather than
8SVX's signed samples.  So basically, you just do an "xor" with $80 on
each byte of the sample.

Theres a proggy called sound machine somewhere on Aminet that converts 
wav samples to raw, iff or voc, or the other way round, It also flips 
samples, for wav seems to be stored as an inverse wavform to what the 
amiga onse are.

I believe it's 1.3b. I don't have it at hand here at work. What kind of 
troubles were you experiencing? 

Andy mentioned that he underestimated the drain college would be on his 
free time, so that may have effect on updating the extension.

You still haven't mentioned, or rather I haven't read, what this AGA 
extension is all about. Could you give a list of specs? Maybe some 
examples of how to use it?

Is that the price of the Widows program that does it for you? ;-)

Mac samples (aiff) work that way also. The nice thing of xor'ing, as you 
all undoubtedly know, is that you can have the old values back by doing 
it again. So you cannot just transfer the .wavs to .iffs, but also the 
other way around (though wavs, like aiffs (Mac), may require a header).

Right! Thats it! I've had enough!

(1) What is this intuition extension everyone is going on about?
(2) What do it do?
(3) Where can I get it?
(4) Will it run on Amos Pro (I have version 1.something-or-other)
(5) Is it worth getting it?

Answer these and make me a happy man :)

Rich.

I think it is okay to include the library as it will reduce the size of any

Hello!
Just a quick question:
Does anybody know if there is a Amos Creator version of EasyLife 
extension and where I can find it?
On AmiNet there's only AmosPro version 1.10.

Hello,
I'm very happy that you liked that game. ThanX

Well, now, I also don't know who those enemies are!! Have they to be
someone?? Probably Blitz users... or better, Pc users...

And why the enemy that scrolls must be shooted 3 times?? To make the game
more and more difficult, of course!! :-))

But don't think that all the levels are in the same city street. Play it
and
you'll change places, from the desert up to the moon!!

Did you like it?? Then register!!!  Oooopppppssss... ;-)

Thank you very much and BYE.

Hi.
Does anyone have a nice fileselector made in interface
and is well remarked? If so, then please send it to me.
By the way. Does anyone know how I fast can check
how many files there is in a directory and is it possible
to redimension a variable after I already have dimensioned it?

Anyhu, if you didn't, I was plugging my paint program, PaintGun, written 
entirely in mAmos the Creator and compiled on ApCmp 2.x.  Its really 
neat.  You can get to it through my Web site below (Internext Software 
Products is the link to choose).  Its also on Andy's FTP server (not 
indexed on the site yet, though).  Please try it and give me some 
criticism.  Its the first program I've ever actually released (or gotten 
close to release), so please criticise.  Just keep it helpful, OK?  Thanks.

If anybody does have a nice file selector interface can they send it to me as
well?

Oh yes - as far as i know, you can't redimension a variable after you have
already dimensioned it (there is an extension somewhere that lets you do this - but i can't remember its name or where i saw it - sorry).

A fileselector on intuition or in Amos?? For the first, you can choose

among
Intuition extension and Ldos extension. They both allow them and are on
Aminet.
For the second, why not the selector written by Chris Hodges for AMCAF??
You can get the archive always on Aminet (but probably you need AmosPro,
I'm
NOT sure)

Well, to count the files, you could use Dir First$ and Dir Next$, but
Chris,
why don't you add it to your AMCAF??
For the arrays, I think there are no solutions: but you can use local
arrays
(they can be dimmed as many times as you want but going out and then again
in...) or better, use Banks!!!

Bye.

Corinne has sent the archive to me. I have put it up as OS-DevKit.lha in 
FTP://ftp.mpi.nl/bcollin/leisure/os-devkit/.

The archive contains three executables that demo the possibilities of OS 
DevKit. It has some serious Intuition functions. It also brings a bit of 
AGA to Amos, in the sense that programmers can now use AGA commands on an 
Intuition screen. This is demoed by having an Amal animation running on 
an Intuition screen. 
There is also a 'hidden' (no icon) program called ScreenSwitcher that is 
actually quite handy. When moving the pointer over the turn screen gadget 
in the top right of an Intuition screen, you get a list of screens opened 
from which you can select the screen you want to open. So no more leafing 
through numerous screens until you find the right one.
The third program animates a 3D object on the Workbench. This program is 
not too carefull when allocating colours, so all your Workbench colours 
will change, but it's a nice gimmick after all.
The archive is about 450k large.
Following my signature is the official README of the program.

Have fun!

Note from the uploader:
  I got this archive through an Internet connected friend of the

and you should contact the author for more information.
  I changed two minor things before uploading:
  -I corrected a few spelling mistakes in this document. The original is
still in the archive.
  -I changed the .dms archive into a .lha one, as I feel most of the
potential downloaders of this kind of software would want .lha anyway.
  My email address will be valid through February 1996.
  After that you can me reach me at u249026@vm.uci.kun.nl through August
1996. After that, I don't know.

Ok, thanks for the suggestions everyone. I think I am moving forward
with this and may actually be able to fashion a rather crude image
processor in Amos. All I meant by luminance is the brightness of the
pixel. Perhaps that is referred to as luminosity, dunno. The idea is
to smooth out a mottled dark background in the frame to colour zero
by zapping the pixels without any bright neighbors.

I now know how to pull a hex value from a given pixel. It'll be in
the form of a string and look like "FG3" or "2B2" or something like
that. I understand what you all were saying about getting the brightness
of the pixel by adding up, (and squaring), and dividing by 3. That would
give me a number which tells me the brightness of the pixel. That is
what I am trying to do.

However I don't know how to separate and pull a 0 to 16 value from
the "F" and the "G" and the "3" of the "FG3" string. This is not the
sort of programming at which I am good. I just need the line of code
to get these 3 values, average them, set a minimum threshold to kill
the pixel to zero, and then I'll run the procedure about 1,200,000
times to process each pixel in my 70 frame animation.

Hmm, may have to go out and grab a bite in the meantime, what?

I wrote a file selector in the interface some time ago. I've been unable to
find it. I do remember it was heavily based on one of the interface
examples. It used sliders and a clickable window. I suggest you look at the
file called (I think) "Full example" or similar. It's the keyboard music
playing thingy. Look at the way it allows you to choose instruments.

As for the difference, well you wont really spot many differences but the
most important thing is the fact that it's a lot more compatable with
other Amigas. When I first started sending out Shareware copies of my
programmes I must have received hundreds of error reports and bugs. But
I was sure the program was bug free. You might write a program and compile
it and it rund perfectly well but send it to someone who has an A1200 or
an A500 or A600 or some strange thing called an A3000 or even a funny thing
called an A4000 whatever that is ;) and you'll get nothing but complaints.

When I moved to using AMOS Pro I found the bug reports dropped and
compatability increaced. It's well worth the move but before it wasn't
worth the price, but now it is (I Hope) According to AMIGA Shopper 57
there's a company called 'Ultimate Software' I'll quote a bit for you:-

"AMOS Pro will be the first to be re-released On 11 disks, it will include
a compiler (GOOD!) and an easy disk for beginners (Easy amos will not be
re-released because all the commands are in the Pro Version anyway)"

Should be about 25-30 which is good with the Compiler included!!!

As for Picking the pockets of us AMOS users well I think your half right
because I don't think there was much need for an 'Easy AMOS' package and
I also think that AMOS Pro should have been an update rather than a
different package. Then again how long do you think Europress would have
stuck with AMOS without the extra cash from AMOS Pro? At least they sorted
out a few bugs and came up with a much better compiler, which come to think
of it is probably the reason why compiled programmes are a bit better :)

on the whole :-

AMOS Pro is not on the whole faster than AMOS classic.
AMOS Pro does have bugs it's very own :(

AMOS Pro *is* a better working environment
AMOS Pro has good on-line Help features
AMOS Pro has macros!!!!!
AMOS Pro has a faster Test proccess
AMOS Pro commands PP load etc. Iff Anims and a few other new commands.

I think (don't take me up on these):-

AMOS Pro is more compatible with different Amigas
AMOS Pro has MORE up to date extensions for it?
AMOS Pro has a nicer shade of blue than the old AMOS

On the whole I'd wait for that bargain package from 'Ultimate' and maybe
they could sort out some updates or maybe get hold of the AMOS-source code
for us so that someone can fix us up with the perfect language.
 
We all need to move to AMOS V2.00 so that the market isn't divided. As
for compatability problems with compilers, well I think thats more to do
with 3rd party Extensions rather than AMOS commands themselves. I'm still
trying to sort out bugs with some of my stuff used dodgy extensions.

Lastly I'm not saying AMOS Pro is perfect but it's miles better than the
original AMOS. If anyone is having problems getting used to the editer
then I'll be happy to give you some tips ;)

Sorry for the long waffle but it's my first message to this list so
don't shout at me please ;)


Cheers all,

Your AMOS program would have to create a message port.  Then you write a 
small program in either C or assembler that will send a message 
specificaly to the port created by the AMOS program.  When your AMOS 
program gets wind of the message, it simply does an Amos To Front to get 
the AMOS screen back.  Put the small program onto an icon and you've get 
it beat.  There's some fiddling necessary to get the object to show up on 
Workbench and I don't exactly know how you'd tell workbench to add the 
icon.  Icon library maybe?  Someone help me out here if they can.  Your 
AMOS program can use LoadSeg from the DOS library and Exec's CreateTask 
to get the message task to run under control from the main program and 
use KillTask and UnloadSeg to remove when your program finishes.

Talk about intersting timing - I just hacked the BMP format for use on a 
486 project I'm doing.  Given a 256-color bitmap (ie: 8 bits/pixel), the 
format will be like this:

	struct BMP {
		char	"BM",
		ulong	filesize,
		ulong	0, 	      	/* ??? */
		ulong	GfxOffset,     	/* from start of file */
		ulong	PaletteOffset, 	/* from this location */
		ulong	width,	      	/* width of image  */
		ulong   height,	      	/* height of image */
		ushort	0,		/* ??? */
		ushort	bitsperpixel,	/* 8 */
		ulong	0,		/* ??? */
		ulong	bodysize,	/* size of image in bytes */
		ulong	fill[2]		/* ??? */
		ulong	palettesize	/* # colors in palette */
		ulong	ditto		/* ??? */
		ulong	palette[256]	/* palette information */
		byte	firstpixel	/* first pixel of image */
		...
	};

	Note: I don't know exactly what the palette ordering is,
	it's either rr gg bb 00, or bb gg rr 00, but I can't say for
	sure since I don't exactly know the VGA's ordering myself.
	I know that I get the right results if I use

	ubyte *foo;
	ulong pal;
	foo=(ubyte *)&pal;
	// assume an open file and fd is the descriptor...
	read(fd,foo,4)  // read four bytes from the palette of the BMP
	r=(*foo)>>2;
	g=(*(foo+1))>>2;
	b=(*(foo+2))>>2;
	_remappalette(colorfrom0to255,(r<<16)+(g<<8)+b);

	If 0x0000000000rrrrrr00gggggg00bbbbbb is the format of the
	VGA palette then I got it right the first time, if not, then
	I got red and blue backwards and the BMP is then using bb gg rr 00

Cheers,

No. For your file requester thingy, I would use a bank for the directory

Sometimes messages don't seem to arrive.
The next two messages were sent from two locations
(at work and at home) and they did not appear in the list.

The subscribtion (at jp.dejong@inter.nl.net) to the list however 
did arrive and I got the welcome message from Michael.

Can it be that messages from people not subscribed to the list
are filtered?

The mail from jp.dejong@inter.nl.net may have been sent before
Michael acknowledged my subscription. And I just realised that
I sent the first mail from jp_dejong@signaal.nl which used to be
jp_dejong@hgl.signaal.nl.

All addresses@hgl.signaal.nl (now) have the same destination as
    addresses@signaal.nl, and this may not be obvious to someone
receiving mail from either address.

I want to move the subscribtion from jp_dejong@hgl.signaal.nl (work)
to jp.dejong@inter.nl.net (home) but I wanted some overlap to make
sure I didn't miss any mail.

The easylife extension has a command to 'iconify'. It creates a window
type title bar on the Workbench screen. This is how I used it:

Amos Lock

You can check how much files and directory's there are on a
disk with the JD extension commands:

A=Jd Count Files(DEVICE$)
A=Jd Count Dirs(DEVICE$)

> to redimension a variable after I already have dimensioned it?

Only to reduce the size of an array, not to enlarge.
Again, the JD extension has got a command for this:

Jd Reduce Dim ARRAY(VAR(0)),ND

 Hello everybody ,

 I am new to the Amos-mailing list,and I want to announce that I am currently
 working on a huge package. The idea of the program is very original.
 
 Every Amos programmer must have had problems with the graphical look
 of his program. If you want to position text on the screen, you must guess
 for the good coordinates that matches the best. If you draw a box on the
 screen using the built-in command, I am sure you mistake sometimes on
 using the right coordinates, then you turn back to the editor and change
 the coordinates. 

 This can be time-consuming, that's why I got a brilliant
 idea. Why don't make a program ( in AMOS of course !!) that does all the
 calculation for you. ( that's why computers are built for, isn't it ? )

 I started programming on the spot and version 1.4 is finished !!!

 It is called AMOS SOURCE CREATOR. 

 If you want to get a demo version of it, just ask for it!

 Features of AMOS SOURCE CREATOR v.1.4 ( Copyright 1995 By Pascal Felique)
  
 Please note : Features below are only part of the AMOS SOURCE CREATOR,
               More modules will follow in new versions.  
 
 Picture Module (included in version 1.4)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You just have to click on buttons of actions with the mouse, then you can draw
 your painting like any ordinary drawing package. While you draw this program 
 will generate Amos source of your picture.
 
 - Drawing functions : Line , Freehand , Airbrush , Polygon , Circle , Box
                       Fill , Clip , Paste , Inverse , Fillpattern
                       Change colour palette, Resolution , Brushes ,...

 - Fonts also possible ( This function uses XOR mode , this mode makes
                         it possible to position your text on the right place)

 Hyperlink Module ( included in version 1.4 / not in demo-version )
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - User definable buttons

   Example : Draw a rectangle , fill it with the right colour , 
             add some text. Then click on the icon Button_Def.
             Then you have to select this rectangle.
             After this you have to insert the name of page you want to
             link to.

 The programs you can create with V1.4 of ASC can be compared with hyperpages
 of Netscape (R).

 
 When you have completed your painting, just click on the save-button :
 then you can choose two formats :

   1. Standard IFF format
      ( If you choose this option, the computer will save your painting
        in static IFF format (without the button-information)  


   2. Amos v1.36 source code
 
 
I am currently working on AMOS SOURCE CREATOR v2.0 , it will be completed in
July/August 1996 and it will be an impressive package !!!!

 Features of AMOS SOURCE CREATOR v2.0  (Copyright By Pascal Felique)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Amal module  

   example :

   Draw a small image , select image ( rectangular selection )
   After you have defined a screen area you can choose out of standard
   animation sequences, ASC generates the right code for you in AMOS.

 - Sprite Module :

   After you have defined animation sequences with the amal module, you
   can define collision detection just by clicking with the mouse on
   the images.

 - Input Module :

   With this module it is possible to create whole applications.
   It is even possible to work with - which I call - Graphical Variables.

   Description of a "Graphical variable "

   Like you could define buttons to pre-drawn boxes it is even possible
   to attach a variable to a pre-drawn box. 
   If you do this, you also have to define a font name.

   After you have defined it, it is possible to click on it with the mouse
   , then you can insert text ( the text won't reach out of the rectangle)
   The value of the "Graphical variable " can be used anywhere in your
   program.


    Any suggestions are welcome. 

    If you want to receive a demo version of AMOS SOURCE CREATOR just mail me

He also got a reply from Chris hodges, however, I have something to add.
First he asked some questions, after wich he asked the following one:

Now, in a way Chris is correct, you cannot redimension an array after you have dimensioned it, but, look at this:

Rem Global or non global??
Rem That's the question.
Rem a simple example, by Jeroen Knoester (v942360@si.hhs.nl)
'
Rem Global vars:
Dim array1(10,10)
Global array1()
Rem now this array can never be altered in size, but...
'
Procedure example
Rem Create an array
count=Rnd(100)
Print count
'
Dim array2(count)
Rem this array is now dimensioned, right..
Rem So.. it cannot be altered in size, right..
Rem Correct, BUT this is a LOCAL array.. If the procedure is exited
Rem and then reentered later, the main program will have forgotten all
Rem about the array, so.. It will locally redimension the array, with a
Rem different size.
'
End Proc
'
Rem Main loop
'
While inkey$=""
  example
Wend
End

This little program will show you the benefits of local vars over global ones.
What happens is this:
In the main program, the computer knows nothing about the array in the procedure
example. While inside the procedure, the array is dimensioned, with a random
size. When this procedure is exited, the computer will totally forget the
array dimensioned INSIDE the procedure. When the program then calls the procedure again, the computer will redimension the array, simply because according to the computer, the array is not there.

This poses a single problem, how to get the information you need from this procedure to the outside world..
Well, you use a single global var as help. What you do is this: 

You read the information you need from your file selector, wich is a single file. This information you stick into a global var from the main program BEFORE you
exit the procedure. This way you can redimension your array, and still get the
information you need from it.

If you need the array to be known among multiple procedures, you simply declare it as a Shared var in the other procedure to use the array, like this:

Procedure Needs_your_array
   Shared array()
   Rem code goes here..
End Proc

I hope this helps... See you,

What's different about AMOS Pro?

1. Better editor

2. Better handling of almost everything

3. More commands

4. Pro compiler is better than old compiler

5. Accessory programs

6. Better serial port control

As you can probably tell, I dumped AMOS 1.3 for Pro as soon as 2.0 came 
out (1.0 Pro was so buggy, it made AmigaBASIC look good.)

Well met and godspeed,

To Iconify, grab the EasyLife Extension available at several sites.

Amos To Back

Amos To Front

Where x and y are position on the workbench and title$ is the text to go 
in the title bar style icon.

I know you can pass variables to amos from the cli by using:

and using command line$ to get the data into amos.

Well, a friend of mine tried to do the same thing with amos 1.3
too. He used a print-drill via the parallel-port
This did work in the end, but not thanks to AMOS 1.3
You should realise that the parallel.device from the amiga -which
is accessed through PAR: in AMOS1.3- wants a handshake.
So if you just write to PAR: nothing happens because the Amiga will
wait for a handshake from the other end.
In AMOSPro you may acces the parallel.device directly and thus
you may be able to (using the RKM.devices) access it properly.
If not, the simplest option is to Loke,Doke and Poke straight into
the parallel-ports memory-mapped places. Which is very close to
what you are doing on the IBMs. Note: under MSDUMB this is quite OK
but not under windoze or OS2 etc. The amiga also expects to have
access to the port unless prohibited by a task (through the
parallel.device). So my friend used the hardware approach and this
works fine. Other programs will work OK as well if they do not
attempt to use the parallel port.
I DO NOT have the addresses needed here, look them up in the
hardware manual or 'amiga intern' or such. I can look them up if
you realy want. Maybe someone else knows them by heart :-?

Hope this is of help.

Europress has to give AMOS code FREE to some really good coders. Do you

i.e. First thing Europress has to do is abandoning the Klick 'n' Play

This is done through the Colour function. After you have done 
CI=Point(X,Y)
you can do
CV=Colour(CI)
. You then get a value between 0 and 4095. Look in the manual for how to 
interpret this value.

 Hello everybody, it's me again ( Pascal Felique ,author of ACS )

 I got a lot of response for the message I placed on the mailing.

 Because a lot of persons like to receive a demo version of ACS
 and because it's nearly Christmas , I got a great idea.

 Persons who send me a Christmas card get a demo-version of it.
 I am talking about a real Christmas card , no cyber derivate.

 So if you want to receive the demo version send a Christmas card to
 the following non-cyber address :

Well, first of all! I have both Amos and AmosPro and I can say that 
AmosPro is much better... why? You have more commands to use, more 
people have AmosPro and it's nicer to work with! I've think AmosPro
is the best programing language to work with on the Amiga Computer
(Hope Amiga Tech is doing their best to keep up the technology!)

So I can RECOMAND you to buy AmosPro! Even if it's still has a few 
bugs left...

            Marco.

I think this is the standard method - have you noticed when any X graphics 
program
such as Xv / Netscape / Ghostview start, they always come up with a message
"Dithering to colour cube" - This is similar to what they ti, but instead of 
comparing to
point (0,0,0), they find the nearest colour in the current palette.

With HAM screens, you will have to scan the image left to right, so that the 
left most
Point() value is a reference into the colour palette, and all subsequent 
values returned
by point mean:

0-15:	A colour from the palette
16-31:	This-16 is the red luminance - green and blue same as previous pixel.
32-47:	This-32 is the green lumminance - red and blue same as previous pixel.
48-63:    This-48 is the blue lumminance - green and blue same as previous 
pixel.

So you have to first calculate the RGB value of each pixel, then find its 
luminance.

P.s. This will take a long time in AMOS - if you know how, this is the sort of 
thing
assembler procedures are used for.

Yes, it's fantastic!!!
Forget C and others... well, use them less!!

Yes, the only way (I know) is to buy the new Pro Compiler. It's sold with
the
version 2.0 of AmosPro and it needs the last previous version (v1.??). But
about the 3D extension, I don't know too much: is there a version for
AmosPro?? And if it is, is it possible to upgrade from the amos version for
free (or not too much)??

Bye.

Hello,

some time ago, I asked if any of you printed the manuals of Amcaf and of
Easylife, but I had no reply. So, I decided to print them myself, and just
today I've done it.

Now, if YOU are interested in having them printed (I used a very good

ink-jet
printer), please email me, asking for them, and I'll send you.
I have available:     AMCAF v1.30
                      Easylife v1.10
                      Intuition v1.3a
                      Craft v1.00 (but you must buy the extension yourself)

Well, you can check on Aminet in pub/aminet/dev/amos/    and you'll find

some
of the most famous extension: AMCAF, Turbo,... Otherwise, try nic.funet.fi
in
pub/amiga/programming/amos/  there is other interesting stuff.

If you can access WWW, surf up to http://mmm.mbhs.edu/cgi-bin/achurch/amos/

Good luck and bye.

*** Hopefully the following information will help all those who do not own
Amos Professional - Rich. ***

So - you've got your Amos Classic (hence from now on called AC) and you can't
dcide if you should go out and spend your hard earned cash on Amos
Professional (hence from now on called AP)??

Firstly a few myths sorted - AP is not faster than AC, it runs at just the
same speed uncompiled. When you compile programs AP makes the executable file
slightly larger than the AC compiler and it also runs slightly (but only very
slightly) slower. Hence the reason that those who want speed, compile with AC.
However the compression routine on AP is better than on AC and so the program
size does even out (although the compression routine of AP is buggy to say the
least).

Differences once loaded are obvious:

* The pull down menu system - all commands are accessed by pull down menus.
You can now mark places in your code to jump to quickly, you can have several
programs on the go at once and cut and paste between them easily, you can
actually work with the caps lock on (try that in AC), you can cut and paste easily.

* The direct mode - you can now direct the resulting display into either the
window or the screen, have a decent command history (no more pressing f1 or
f2).

* The extra commands - there are over 50 new commands involved with AP -
including bug fixes of several of the old ones. You can now call external dos
commands without having to use a procedure, import code into procedures and do
loads of other things which I can't really remember but I know I use them (there
is a check 1.3 option so you can see if the program will run on AC)

* The help function - there is an online help on every single one of the
commands plus at least one demonstration program with each, just put the cursor at
the word you want and hit HELP.

* The external programs - some decent games (!!), an excellent bob editor, a
sample editor (which allows you to adjust your samples playback rate before
storing it - previously impossible), a handy disk manager (with fast formatter),
decent amal editor and loads of other helpful files (including an 8x8 font
editor - question on that later).

I really cannot put over the fact on how good AP is - once you have used it
you'll never want to go back to AC. The options on the disk request is better,
the menus hide loads of new functions and the additional programs are easy to
use.

I've had AP for a while now, I haven't loaded up AC since (oh yeah - and you
can even install the AC compiler onto AP - which itself is a hell of a lot
easier than it was before).

Go for Pro - you're living in the dark ages with classic.

Can anyone help me with the following problems (I'm using Amos Pro - of
course!).



(1) How do you change the mouse pointer?

I know that you type:

Change Mouse n+3 (where n is the number of your sprite in your bank)

however my mouse pointer doesn't change at all. I've tried small pointers,
bigpointers, sprites, bobs and anything else I can think of.

(at the moment I have to use an AMAL program to change it - which is far from
perfect)



(2) How do you use the fonts once you've designed them with the 8x8 editor?

At the moment the only way I can do it is call a dos command which changes thesystem topaz font - but that means that whoever runs the program needs that
command in the right place! (irritating!).



Can anyone help???

I'm certainly interested in an AGA extension, but I really need it for
bobs/sprites and stuff. I'll certainly buy it if it gets upgraded. How
much would a new version cost to buy, or to upgrade from the current
version?

   This wont work for HAM6 screens.  Point will return a color index from 
0-15 if it's one of the 16 base colors, or a number from 16-63 if the pixel 
is a red, green or blue modification from the pixel to the left (see the 
manual).  Colour can't give you the correct values for a 16-63 result.

   If you know how to get the hex string that represents the RGB value of 
a pixel (like your original post said), then you can get the red, green 
and blue vlues with: 
(Assuming rgb$ is the hex string and that the first character is "$" in 
both examples.  These return integer values from 0-15)

     red=val("$"+mid$(rgb$,2,1))
   green=val("$"+mid$(rgb$,3,1))
    blue=val("$"+mid$(rgb$,4,1))

OR:

     red=val(rgb$)/256
   green=(val(rgb$) mod 256)/16
    blue=val(rgb$) mod 16

Then to find an "average" luminance use:
(These return a floating-point value from 0-15.)

   lum#=(red+green+blue)/3.0

Or for a "color-weighted" luminance (like how BW film captures different 
hues) use:
(Weighted values taken from ADPro.)

   lum#=red*0.299+green*0.588+blue+0.113

Well, to be honest: DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HEX NUMBER???

You ask about a possible "FG3" string that should be the colour of a point.
But the hex numbers go FROM 0 (zero) up TO F and F means 15. So, you have:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, 10, 11, 12 and so on.
But 11 will NOT mean eleven, but it stands for the normal 17. Is it clear??

Now, the Point(,) function does not return a string, but a number. You can
display it such as a string, using the hex$() function, but it still remain

a
number.

It's better to display it in hex, since in this way you can "think" that
each
part of the number is a component of the colour. $4F6 means that the RED
level is 4, the GREEN one is F (=15) and the BLU one is 6: this is why it's
called RGB.

Now, to know the value of each component, you can do:
R=Point(x,y)/256
G=(Point(x,y)/16)-(R*16)
B=Point(x,y)-(R*256)-(G*16)

Is it clear??

But if you own Craft extension look for a special command about all it.

Bye.

Great?? MUCH MORE!!!!!! :-))))

It could give Amos a new life!!!

PLeae, if any of all you has more infos about (price, email address of the
company, etc...), SEND THEM TO THE LIST!!

I wrote a letter to QUARTZ Informatique: I'll tell you their reply as soon

as
possible!

Re: changing mouse pointer

There are a few restrictions that they don't ever mention.

The Bob or sprite file must be in low res 4 colour mode.  If the image is 
not in low res 4 color, it will not change the mouse.

Hi everbody!

Can anyone help me with the following :

(to save space on my bobs, I want them in more colors)
I would like to write a copperlist that does the
'colormapped' display like a c64 (and c128 and spectrum etc)
That is: 8*8 pixelblocks with a certain color from a colormap.
So, I would like to have a bank or so which contains 1000 words
with colorvalues. These colorvalues should be moved to the
background colorregister on every 'characterblock' first line.
That is:
 1.......2.......3.......4....
 |.......|.......|.......|....
 |.......|.......|.......|....
 ...........
 |.......|.......|.......|....
 40......41......42......43...
 |.......|.......|.......|...

I hope the result would be as described. I know the copper can change
the colorvalue of some color in 8 (lores)pixels. So this should be
possible. 
Also, I recon this should be possible through a copperlist and as
such in 'regular' amos (I hope :-) 
Anyway, the problems seems to be with sprites or so. 
My 'custom'copperlists have thus far gone as far as what the
manual shows. I don't know how to proceed on this.

Anyone ?
Help is greatly appreciated !
(PS sprites should stay visible if possible ?)

How much would this be faster, you recon ?
I agree the loop should be removed, also all in all
this will be faster, but how fast is the above string-method
anyway ?

When you install IntOS, make sure you copy RUN to your C: dir or else IntOS

This applies to WB3+ machines as RUN is a Resident command!

The mouse pointer image has to follow these rules:
- Four colors only. Get the sprite from a four-colours screen, not more
  and not less.
- The width has to be exactly 16 pixels.
- The height is not limited AFAIK, but for very high sprites, you should
  use a bigger sprite buffer.

The fonts you design with the 8x8 FontEditor are for the use of Print and
Center only. To use them you have to use the Change Print Font command of
the AMCAF extension ;-)

Text fonts can be changed with AMCAFs Change Font or Change Bank Font
command. ;-)

...because Multi Wait will use the system friendly _LVOWaitTOF instead of
polling for the vertical blank like Wait or Wait Vbl does. That means that
your routine won't slow down the other tasks too much. I cannot stand
games that stop my raytracer in the background just to wait for an
accurate vertical blank.

AFAIK the AP compiler optimizes some expressions and creates faster code,
especially when using Comp Test Off.

RL> Hence the reason that those who want speed, compile with AC.

Nononono! The AMOS Creator Compiler will IMO NOT create an AGA compatible
program, which will be unstable on faster machines aswell.

Erm... yes, probably ;-)))

By the way: As there are so many new members on the amos-list, I'd like to
post my advertisment text on AMCAF again ;-)

Short:    A shareware version of the AMCAF ext
Author:   Chris@sixpack.pfalz.de (Chris Hodges)

Type:     dev/amos

AMCAF - the next generation in AMOS programming!

At last, the new and powerful AMCAF (i.e "Amos Miscellaneous Commands
And Functions) extension is available for AMOS Professional. The main
extension file is more than 40 KB long and contains more than 200 new
commands and functions  for every day programming  with AMOS Pro. The
package consists of two disks which can be installed on harddisk very
easily  using the  supplied  installation  software. The  manual is a
210KB amiga guide document  and can be adapted to the AMOS Pro online
help (pressing  the  help-key  in  the  editor will  pop up  the full
description  of  the command). Moreover a  program to  read the guide
with  kickstart  1.3  is  also  supplied. A  disk full  of completely
documented example programs is supplied aswell. Every AMCAF user will
get the required support and help  he needs by  either email or snail
mail.

AMCAF contains commands for:

- Bank manipulation and encoding
- Turbo graphics
- Blitter control
- Shade Bobs/3D Stars/Splinters
- Fonts (e.g to put a normal text font into a bank and vice versa)
- Colour and palette handling with ham support
- Rainbow fading
- Disk access (dir reading, filecopying, Dos-error strings)
- Tooltypes and pattern matching
- Powerpacker and FileImploder support
- Time and date functions
- 4 player adapter, CD32 joypad and second mouse support
- 3D vector rotation
- Fast integer zooming
- Fast sin/cos/rnd/sqr replacements
- String operations (to come in V1.40)
- Protracker support (including CIA-timing and sfx commands etc.)
- Even more various commands.

The registered version of AMCAF is available for only 25 US$.
A german version is also available on request.

Download the archive to see the real power of AMCAF ;-)

To ALL

It seems some of my postings are not getting through to this list.
I have answered everyone that has asked me question but it seems I may be
missing the odd posting here and there. The main questions seem to ithe AGA extension, so here is the catalogue listing for it. I hope this
clears up all queries (ooer) about it.


Amos AGA Extension (Build V.312)
Michael Prince
3.99 (1 disk)
Disk No. F1-113
---------------

AGA AMIGA REQUIRED (A1200,A4000) + Amos Classic or Amos Professional.

YES, this IS the same extension that saw a massive advertising campaign
by Amiganuts PD. Amiganuts are now no-longer and F1 are proud to have been
asked to distribute the first ever AGA extension for Amos/Pro.
As you can see, we have dropped the price from Amiganuts' 10 to just 3.99,
now everyone REALLY CAN afford this latest breakthrough in the development 
of the amazing Amos programming language.

NOTE: F1 its distributers or M.Prince do not wish to mislead anyone, this 
      program is far from completion, there is as yet no support for bobs 
      and sprites, however there are 22 commands (listed below) and more in 
      development. New commands for this extension will depend on how it is 
      supported.

            The commands currently supported by the AGA extension:

			AGA Screen Open
			AGA Screen Close
			AGA Screen
			AGA Front Screen
			AGA Load Bitplanes
			AGA Screen Copy
			AGA Draw Mode
			AGA Cls
 			AGA Ink
 			AGA Colour
 			AGA Box
 			AGA Bar
 			AGA Text
 			AGA Use Font
			AGA Get Block
 			AGA Put Block
 			AGA Clip
 			AGA Del Block
 			AGA Get Palette Bank
 			AGA Sprite Mode
 			AGA Spack
 			AGA Unpack

The extension comes complete with full documentation on what each command
does, some example Amos programs and an installer.
        
Availble ONLY from F1 Licenceware and official distributers, no demo version
available. By smail: Cheques/pos to F1 Licenceware and send to:
F1 Licenceware, 31,Wellington Rd, Exeter, Devon.Ex2-9DU.
Postage costs: 50p UK/1.00 Europe/1.50 ROW. Cheques in sterling only and
drawn on a UK bank please. All orders get a free F1 cat disk detailing other
lovely Amos related gear like the Pro Compiler, Andy Churche's Intuition
extension (soon) Amoszine etc.

Hello everybody,

I have kust taken the JD extension from Aminet and I have two question for
you.

1) Does a manual in English exist somewhere??

2) With the jd extension also the Prt extension is in archive. It's slot
number is 21, but I have it already busy (Utility extension). What can I

do??
Have I to choose just one of them?? Is it possible in some way to change
the
number of one of those extensions?? Of course, I would loose the
compatibility with old programs, but since I never used the Prt extension
and, anyway, it isn't used very often, it wouldn't be a big problem.
What do YOU think about??

Thanh all you very much.

Bye.

To change the mouse pointer, you have to have a sprite bank from where the
image will be taken. But remember: the image MUST BE EXACTLY 16 pixels wide
and have NO MORE than 4 (four) COLOURS. However, there is NOT limits for

the
height of the image.

What do you need the fonts for?? Because, for a fast and easy usage, you
can
try Text command: with it, you can use whatever font, even the biggest one!
Otherwise, get the AMCAF extension by Chris Hodges (the demo version is on
Aminet in dev/amos and the only(?) limitation is that you can't compile the
program): it has got a command to use your own fonts with Print command,
but
just if they are 8X8 (as your ones are!).

Yes, I did: is it enough??

have anything on my Amiga to enable me to read Mac disks.

Just letting you all know that I have stopped working on ppACCESSORY for 
my latest project which is like the subject line says. I have programmed
a bunch of procedures which makes use of Kenneth C. Nilsen's dfunc.library.
These procedures will be a gradual thing as not all functions are yet 
implemented. Future releases will bring more procedures and example 
programs. I just wanted to get this first release out before X-mas. So 
far it includes 13 procedures which add some very useful commands that are
lacking in AMOSPro.

However it requires that you have the dunc.library (v37.14) which you can 
get from Aminet (util/libs).

My procedures should be available any day on Aminet (dev/amos).

AMOS Pro will work with wb3.1, as long as you don't use interlaced 
screens for the editor and programs. Other than that, I don't see a 
problem. Most people don't make interlaced games anyhow.

But some people could make interlaced utilities (like me). If the program is
compiled, there is any problem witn WB 3.1?

  I`m making programs for cabel TV studios, always in interlace and
its big problem for me when I can`t use interlace on new system.
But is it problem of WB or KS 3.1 ? 
Maybe somebody know a solution ?? Please tell me about it

Jacek

          Merry Christmas and Happy New Year 1996 
              for all Amiga and Amos fans :)

Ok, but reading (in German, even if I can't understand it) the doc of JDlib
extension I found a command called JD Count File and another called
Jd Count Dir: could they be useful for that??

Ultimate Software is no more. It was apparently a hoax by Joe Jenkins,
who also ran Amiganuts (which is also no more).

I'm not sure if my reply to the help on my image processing program went
through so again, here is the current situation:

I now am able to read the colour of a pixel into a 3 character string
that represents the Red, Green, and Blue values of the pixel. What I
need to do, as was suggested, is average these values into a number
that would tell me how bright the pixel is. Then I can kill the pixel
to colour zero if it and its neighbors are not bright enough. Thus
I smooth a mottled darkish background to solid colour zero.

BUT the string is an alphanumeric string (hex?) like"FG1" or "7A6" or
"EB5" and I don't know how to pull an average out of that so I can
program "If AVGBRIGHTNESS < 10 then plot X,Y,0" =`(

D'ya see what I mean or am I unclear? All I need is a single line of
code here and I will be on my way to a heinous image processing
program!

Well, actually, I've seen articles(2nd hand) that in early 1996 the
Amiga1200 will be called the Amiga1300.  It will basically be an A1200 with
a redesigned case, 030 cpu and more memory and perhaps a cd, even a single
speed would be better than nothing.  Then sometime later, the A4000T/060 is
suppose to be release and then sometime in 1997 the new Power Amiga seriers
should be released.  Currently they are suposely working on the OS to work
on PowerPC chips.  However, how true all this is, I can not say since its
2nd hand(or more) information.

Dear All,

   Attached to this message is a compiled AMOS Professional (v2.00) game 
called AmTank. Feel free to get hold of it.

   It is in the form of a DMS file. That is: A Disk Mashed file. You will 
require a copy of DMS and a blank disk.

   To get hold of a copy of DMS either search through your CoverDisks - 
It was very popular with The One...and AF have used it a couple of 
times...or you can just search the net.

   Once you have DMS and AmTank.DMS just type DMS write AmTank.DMS df0: 
<return> and then the disk in df0: will become AmTank!

   Then reboot and get ready to play AmTank.

   If you have a HD then there is a HD-Install program to save you 
worrying about what goes where and why. Simply boot from your Hard Drive, 
insert the disk in any drive and then double click the HD-INSTALL icon. 
It will ask you for the destination that you want for AmTank and then 
proceed to install the game there.

   If you have any problems whatsoever with the game or installation 
procedure please contact me at ma4rms@bath.ac.uk or

    7 Finnemore Close,
    Styvechale Grange,
    Coventry,
    CV3 6LR.

   Also, if you find any bugs or just plain annoying things, then let me 
know.


    Enjoy !

   Rich
