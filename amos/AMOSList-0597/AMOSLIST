..since you highlight it, the question is, do you really want VMM ?  Amos
doesn't really care, but some big programs really like VMM.  Most come with
a non-mmu version, but not all.  Do you have a copy of Lightwave ?  The
other question is do you need 16 megs of memory ?  8 megs fastmem is
normally enough for most people.  Which one is slightly cheaper..?   Check
out the stuff you need an MMU for, decide if you really need it, then decide
if everything would run better at 'twice' the speed..  Good luck, let us
know which you choose !

..do you have dpaint, or any other drawing package ??  Set the number of
frames loaded to quite high, and click on the first frame to load.  Then
save it out as an anim.  From amos, not sure off hand.

Yeah, Voodoo being the people behind the AMOS 3D extension.

IIRC this rotation thing is a bug in the extension.

You could write your own equations to figure out the correct
roll/pitch angles and then simply orient the object/viewpoint
accordingly.

Alternatively, though I haven`t tried it myself (yet), you
might be able to get the rotations correct if you reset the
orientation of the object so that it`s not rotated at all,
then do the rotation about the vertical axis, and then
re-rotate the object back so that it`s pointing in the
direction it originally was...

...if you see what I mean!


Hmm, I can see I`m going to be coding tonight :-)

How fast is fast?  I`ve got some 16 colour starfield stuff
using the 3D extension, that I think managed about 5 fps
on my 030/25 (these days it rarely, if ever, drops below
25 fps :-)

If you`re remotely interested, I`ll stick a copy of this code
on my website next week, along with any solution I may come
across for the 3D rotation problem.

   Yes, this is a great book which really goes into very good detail.
   We should note however that it is written for C programmers on
   the IBM platform but, it is packed full of valuable information
   which can by used by anyone!!


   Another GOOD book you may want to check out is called "BLACK
   ART OF MACINTOSH GAME PROGRAMMING: Programming 3D games in
   MACINTOSH C".

   This book is packed full of useful information on 3d polygon
   graphics programming (almost 800 pages). It takes you from 
   simple 2d-vectors right up to filled filled polygon objects with
   texture-mapping. Full chapters are also devoted to subjects such
   as polygon clipping and hidden surface removal.

Greetings.

Another week, more knowledge gained, alas, back to programming..

For those of you curious on the progress of my raycaster, well, here 
it is: I'm almost finished with my studies (2 weeks as of today!), 
which means when I am finished I'll have the summer to program, 
(although I have had some time on weekends and during the week), when 
summer arives, as I said, I'll have all the time I need. I've soaked 
up all the flavor I can on raycasting and the whole nine yards. The 
biggest help, though, was "Amazing 3-D Games Adventure Construction 
Set", a great book by Larry Myers, which explains raycasting and 
comes enclosed with a CD packed full of examples and source, 
including the ACK-3D engine (Adventure Construction Set). Very nice, 
easy to read. Many thanks go to Andy (Mush) for referring me to it.

On the subject of NTSC/PAL:
>>Can they use programs with PAL screens on NTSC or what?
>>Should I make things with a maximum height or 200 rather than 256?

> Make your screen 234 lines high. Have your program sense the type of
> computer (PAL/NTSC) as per my EA4 article. 

I'm not sure, but with most Amiga's, you can use an NTSC/PAL switcher 
program (there are several, I use to tiny little serperate ones that 
run from CLI, both under 4k I think). Not sure if any of the newer 
Amiga's will agree with this or not..

While I'm on the subject of Amiga's, I would like to put out a 
request to anyone that may have a used A1200, in GOOD condition 
please, that would be interesting in selling, please contact me. I am 
willing to pay a reasonable price for one, just to tide me over for 
testing and also for breaking out some of the AGA programs I have 
that I haven't been able to run on my A3000. All I need, I believe, 
is the computer, a power supply/cord, and a mouse (unless my old 
A3000 mouse will work). If I missed anything, just tell me.

I guess that's about it. Be sure and check out my Webpage this 
weekend as I'm going to be finishing up the "under construction" 
areas and updating my raycaster info. Thanks again for reading.

Headers, deltas and compression.
Much better to leave this to Dpaint.

That said, most file format specs (iff included) are freely available on
the net.
If you are crazy enough to code an anim saver in Amos, I'd sure like a copy.

   Really??  I always use $DFF016 to read the second firebutton like
   this:

   FB2=(Peek($DFF016) And 64) Xor 64

   If the 2nd firebutton is NOT pressed then FB2 will equal 0
   If the 2nd firebutton IS PRESSED then FB2 will equal 64



   This is how I'm reading the 2nd firebutton in StarStrike2000 as 
   well so, you mean that you actually can't drop the bombs on your
   system?  


   The above method SHOULD work fine. However, try adding this
   line JUST BEFORE that one... 

   Doke $DFF034,$C000  which should "activate" pin 9 so you will
   be able to detect the 2nd firebutton.




         Hope this helps!!

Hello everyone,

Geosync Media 1997 proudly presents Star Fighter D'Yammen's Reign.

Now showing at...

           http://www.ozemail.com.au/~geosync

...Check it out.

Thanks for the quick replies as to who has my game so far.  I`m working
on some new stuff for Star Fighter. I`ve fixed that dreaded 'Please
Insert Hd0' problem, all the screens have had the palettes brightened or
recoloured, the AI has been improved and the bad guys are a bit easier
to find now.  I`ll keep you posted when I upload the new version but I`m
working on the control and pretty soon the spacecraft will respond more
like -well a spacecraft (to a limit).

I need some help on the following.

A) Eric gave me some stuff on reading the second joystick fire button
but it`s written for AmosPro & mines using 1.36.  What are some Peeks to
find the second button being pressed.  Please note , I`ve already used
Peek(14675990) but that just returns 5 no matter what I press.

B) Additions to my game.  Any support will be credited.  Don`t worry
Eric, you`re being put down as a Beta-tester & Technical Assistant. 
Anyone who feels I should put their name in please let me know.  If I
get the game to a commercial form, I am thinking about paying those who
have helped me, a small amount from the profits, as it will only be
fair.

Seeya,
Andy

Thanks to everyone who replied to my query about 030's...

I'm just back from a couple of days of holiday, and just now read all the
replies - wow! Ok. I made a goof in my original message: I was option 2 was
a 33Mhz processor... Never mind - I've now got on order an 030/50/8Meg.

Well, actually, I've already got it, but it was broke, and I'm waiting for a
replacement :-(

Thanks to everyone who replied!

The "Power Amiga" I refered to was not a PPC based one, but a new machine
I've seen advertised - I forget by who - which is basically an A1200 in a
tower case, with a 24-Bit graphics card, 060 processor, CD drive 22 Megs
(and a Monitor?) as standard, all for about 1500 Uk Pounds.

Does this sound good to everyone else, or are we all still waiting for a
PPC-Based Amiga?

Thanks all. Bye.

Peter.

I recently dug up some old source for DCTV use in AMOS 1.36.  I almost forgot
about it, but now I would like to continue and possibly find someone to help
develop the idea.  I like the fact that I can use highcolor graphics on a
hires 3 or 4 bitplane screen at normal AMOS speeds.  I am however, having
trouble moving objects over background graphics.  So as of now, I am limited
to a black background.

The only working demo I have is of a large Enterprise 1701-D flying across the
screen, with a nebula in the background (they don't touch each other).  As of
yet, this is a ROUGH demo, with NO speed optimizations.  Only very basic bob
movement with doublebuffer.  I am working on a scroll text routine to go with
it also.  

If you would like a copy of the demo (currently 42k uncompressed), let me know
and I will email it to you.  I have nowhere to upload it, and can't get it to
Aminet.  Any suggestions or comments are welcome!

     This may seem kind of off the wall, and please don't flame me.  I bought
my original AMOS and Compiler.  I had quit programming for awhile and now I
don't have a supported product.  Where do we get support except here?  If
someone wanted a copy of my software, yes, I woud let them have one.  You have
very limited use without the manual anyway.
      How much do you think they care about the program anymore?  They made
their profit and they are gone.  Why spend money to prevent piracy when you
wont even produce the product?
      I have absolutely nothing against Europress.  They seemed to be a good
company.  I payed them for everything I used.  If they are watching for
piracy, maybe the renewed interest will prompt them to go back into
production. (LONG shot)
      Back to the subject, it seems to me that Murray HAS the 3D modeler, but
his version crashes on his machine.  Wouldn't a corrective upgrade be free
anyway?

Hello all,

I am working today on the guts of a program that will become Command &
Conquer on the Amiga.  Entitled H.A.R.D. Corps, I hope all those
interested will support the development of this product.

I will eventually need help with...
1)  AI
2)  Sorting hundreds of objects in memory (because you should be able to
manufacture as many troops as you can afford)
3)  Serial communications
4)  Internet comms (for Net games)

Okay, I`ll keep you updated.  Check my site under Coming Soon in about
24 hours for an update on GFX and the starting engine.

Cheers buddies,

Is there a list with all these important Peeks and Pokes anywhere

Would people on the list please take note of my new email address
mushypd@redrose.net as this is an american provider, and allows me to download
my mails quicker.

I also have my amiga back online (yipee!!!!) now, so I can send out archives
and stuff a lot faster.

Note, that the mpd@mushy-pd.demon.co.uk is still active, and stuff sent to it
will still get to me, but any archives that you wish to send please send them
to the redrose account.

One last thing, I have updated my pages again, and added a load of game music,
from games like shadow of the beast 1,2, and 3, Turrican 1 and 2, plus a few
more. I also have all the mods from Jesus on E's, but they will be placed iin
the next update.

All the best!!

   Hmmm... no books, eh?


> Okay, for anyone looking for a good book...

   Most of my hardware knowledge (and I am my no means a master
   of the subject) comes from the study of the following two books:

   MAPPING the AMIGA  (c)1993 COMPUTE Ltd.
   Amiga Graphics Inside & Out  (c)1989 Abacus - A Data Becker Book


   Of the two, MAPPING the AMIGA is the closest thing I have found to
   "complete" internal documentation of the Amiga in a single
   volume.

   It covers all OS calls & data-structures as well as all hardware
   registers.

   Should be able to find a used copy cheap as I'm sure it is "out of
   print" now.
   


> And for the rest, who do NOT want a book...

   Have you tried the "AGA.Guide"?

   This is a documentation of the AGA Chipset in AmigaGuide format.
   Should be on Aminet, under DEV I assume.
   


   I know this wasn't much, but I hope it is of some help,


            Garfield

Yeah, I`ve got version 1.3 or something.  You have to go into the
configuration settings and change the gparams around but other than that
it works fine on an A1200.  I could send you a copy but then I`d have to
kill you (just kidding).  Is it legal for me to send a copy to MURRAY
people?

Yup.

At least not with AMCAF. Registered versions are still available!

I checked that out and after solving a few problems  (I  doesn't  run  from
drives  with  a  space character in the name), I really enjoyed playing it.
Keep that stuff coming.

However, I advise you to use the Ppload command  instead  of  the  external
PowerPacker decruncher...

Hey look, piracy is not dead, and won`t be a part of it.  It`s so easy
to just pack a disk and email as an attachment, but I ain`t gonna do
that until I see some proof that it`s okay to give Murray a copy. 
Anyone know how I can verify this with Europress?

Howdy pardners,

Radio Hits (see below)   Game Playing tips (see below)

NEW UPDATE  8/5/97 

Star Fighter D'Yammen' Reign is online at...

          http://www.ozemail.com.au/~geosync

...I`ve just uploaded the latest version of my space combat simulator. 
New colours, new sounds, new playability.  Disks SF_BOOT.ZIP &
SF_DISK1.ZIP have been modified so you`ll need to download them, and
unpack them in your current Star Fighter Directory like so...

       Unpack to... Hd0:Games/Star  using LHA/LHA-GUI  where
<mydir>=Hd0:Games/Star

...Remember to rename them .LHA instead of .ZIP when you have them.

You can change this to suit your system.  If you haven't got the first 7
disks they can NOW be downloaded.  Of course running the Geosync_install
program over any downloaded disks into your current directory will do
the job too, but it will add a new set of assigns to your
Sys:s/user-startup, which wont cause a problem, except that your
Sys:s/user-startup will start to get bigger. 

Installation problems?  Contact me on...geosync@ozemail.com.au

RADIO STAR FIGHTER TOP 5

Full of lots of goodies, Star Fighter can now play disk-streamed music.
The way I have designed it, it is now possible to have your favourite
music playing in the background while you pummel D'Yammen's ships into
oblivion.  No matter how long...(7 minutes max I reckon).

As as special offer I want to get a favorite hit list from those
interested.  Give me a request for music you want to hear, I`ll track it
down, compile a top 5, and upload the music every 2 days so you have
chance to download your favourite songs to listen to during play. 
(Please note - Metallica suits this game whereas Nana Miskorie doesn`t
but if everyone like Nana then that`s what you`ll get)

GAME PLAY TIPS

GETTING LOST? The control system is enough to get even the most seasoned
pilots lost.  At any time you are lost hit 'C' to have the spaceship
auto-recentre.   Check the dialogue box at the bottom of the screen to
verify it says 'Auto-recentre on'.  Hit 'C' at any time to cancel it, or
it will cancel itself once you are recentered.
Press 'H' to have the HUD appear.  0' is straight ahead and turning left
or right rudders the ship around. 90' & 270' is pointing up or down
respectively.  Left or right turns roll the ship.  180' is upside down
and turning causes ruddering.

TOO MANY BAD GUYS?  Get your allies to take out the motherships. 
Motherships spawn more stunt fighters if left to their own devices.  Hit
'G' until a D'Yammen Cruiser is selected as your current target (or 'T'
for closest target if you are flying past a cruiser).  Hit 'I' to open
an INTERCOM channel and immediately press '1' to get any free allies to
attack your selected target.  Hit 'F' to cancel the target and continue
on.  If no ships are available or they're too aggressive to follow
orders try again until you get a confirmation of your orders...ie
'Affirmative' or 'Request Confirmed'

NEED FIRE SUPPORT?  Hit 'I' to open a channel, and press '2' to get all
available allies to form on your wing.  It may take time for distant
allies to come in so make sure you`re close to some before you do this
effectively.  Once they are formed up (yellow radar blips near the
centre of the radar) select an enemy target, hit 'I' and then '1' and
the formation ships will attack a common target.  Hit 'I' then '0' to
cancel any orders and they will continue on their old mission)  Also
hitting 'I' then '0' will clear any orders, making allies ready for new
commands.

RADAR CONFUSING?  It's based on the ELITE style of radar.  The radar
looks directly down on your ship.  Anything ahead appears in the top
quarter of the radar and is somewhere in front.  As you spin around the
radar blips circle the other way.  A blip with a stalk below it is above
your current height, and a blip with stalk above it is below you.  Red
blips are the enemy,  yellow blips are the allies, orange blips are
neutral, which usually need protecting. (Check out Blue Sky Mine in the
Campaign game for an example) And blue blips are ejected pilots who are
hard to target visually.  Press 'T' to target the closest enemy when a
pilot is nearby.

EJECTED PILOTS?  On harder SKILL levels pilots eject when their ship
blows.  If an enemy gets too close, which usually happens because you
have to get close to destroy stunt ships,  the pilot will attempt to
attach a limpet mine to the base of your ship (with an animation).  The
explosion kills the pilot but does you alot of damage.  Avoid them!!! 
Ejected allied pilots should be picked up, because even though they can
fight, their armour is low.  Picking up a pilot automatically beams him
back to a mother ship if available and launches a new allied stunt ship.


I`ll paste these and more tips on the GEOSYNC MEDIA homepage soon.

           http://www.ozemail.com.au 

Anyway,  nice to have a receptive audience.

This is Andy signing off Radio Star Fighter.

[Amos3D rotations]
> How are you going with this?  Let me know.

Tried the latter, and it fails miserably - 3D still rotates 
the object around the world axes.  In fact, looking at the 
test proggy I wrote, it seems like the extension can only 
rotate about one object axis, the other two always act as 
world axes, no matter what the object orientation.

As to the former, it started to look promising right up to
the point where it fell apart :-|  I think it`s related to
the point above about 2 world axes/1 object axis - with only
one object axis you don`t seem to have sufficient control
over the object orientation to compensate for the two
world axis rotations.

Well, maybe next week :-)  I`ve remembered something about the
starfield code that needs changing, and there`s one other thing
I want to try for the object rotation problem.  But I`ll certainly
have something on the site by next Tuesday.

Star Fighter D`Yammen`s Reign runs on the follow. (that I can tell)
1.   1200/2000/3000
2.   ECS or AGA
3.   need 40mg HDD ( game takes about 15mg when installed and 500-800k
per disk to download )You can erase these after the installation
4.   2meg chip ram / 4meg fast.  (1.8meg chip is used when the ANIM
disks are available, and about 2meg fast is used...I think)
5.   Joystick
6.   68020 or better (need to set the Machine Cyle Delay to suit faster
processors).   You can change this in the Configuration setting during
the game.
7.   Amiga hooked into GOOD STEREO SYSTEM.
8.   BIG TV !!! 68cm if you can do it.  I`ve tried it on 56cm TV, thats
pretty good.
9.   Avid belief that you can hear sounds in outer space. (which of
course you can`t)
10.  Desire to destroy anything that moves.

Please let me know how you go.

I would like to see some suggestions how to highlight a word printed on screen
when the mouse pointer is over it. 
Say i've printed

Pen 1
locate 1,1 : Print"AAA"
locate 1,2 : Print"BBB"


Now I want the text to be rewritten with Pen 2
only when the pointer is over it.

I did find some ways to do it but the text always flickers...

I guess there is some way to get a steady highlight...

If it will run on a 2000, it will run on a 500.

ECS means it does NOT need 2megs CHIP since ECS doesn't have it.

How much of this is needed for the GAME, and how much is extra music, anims,

Like I said, if it runs on ECS, it does NOT need 2meg CHIP.

Easy enough.

You need to add a check into your highlight code that checks to see if the
text is currently highlighted and, if so, jumps out of the code before it
redoes it.

There are a few ways that you can do it. You could use the MOUSE ZONE command
(which would mean having to set zones for each word) and have a routine like:

top:
Locate 1,1 : ink 1 : print "highlight"

repeat
if mouse zone=1
locate 1,1: ink 2 : print "highlight"
endif

if mouse zone=2
locate 1,2 : ink 2 : print "another highlight"
endif

if mouse zone=0
goto top
endif
until false


This means, that the routine will only refresh itself, if no parts are
selected. If you dont do a CLS command in the start of the text, you will then
not get any flicker, as you are not adding anything new, or removing anything,
just making the existing text a different colour.

Exactly.

If we don't pirate forgetten software, it dies anyway because it can't be
obtained.  And no one gets hurt from doing it.  It's a victimless crime.  The
classy thing for Europress to do would have been to make their discontinued
stuff PD, like some other companies.

But we should continure to fully support current authors, who are still making
extensions and other progs.

I've had a letter from a graphics card user who can't play one of my 
games because it requires 2 Meg Chip RAM.
Now he has about 64 Meg or something which can be used as Chip RAM 
but AMOS doesn't seem to recognize this.
The only solution that I could think was to load some banks (graphics 
sound) into Fast ram and only move it to chip when needed. Now this 
isn't much of a solution, is it? It would result in all sorts of 
problems.
Does anyone know of a better solution?

I remember hearing of a routine that stored samples in FAST memory, and only
used a tiny little bit of chip memory to play the current bit of the sample.
Anyone else remember this? (It was assembler)

No, that's not true. The maximum is still 2 MB ChipRAM. The rest is
always Fast. Anyway, if he can afford 64 MB of memory, than I wonder why
he can't afford the extra MB (with an Amiga 1200 attached) :-). And he
also owns a gfx-card... Mymy..

Why isn't it much of a solution? There is no other solution, save for
reducing the number of graphics and sounds. When your programs require
this much Chip memory, you should always check if the computer has enough
FastRAM to act as a buffer -- it helps to conserve the ChipRAM and speeds
up the program on AGA-Amiga's with a 68020+ installed.

Greetings.

I've decided that when I do weekly comments, to refer to the mailing 
as "Weekly highlights." Sounds okay to me.

To anyone that does not know and has mailed me of a late, up until 
now (due to my studies) I have only been able to check my mail every 
weekend, the reason for these weekly highlights and comments. 
However, I will be finishing my studies this coming Wednesday (or 
before hopefully :) and will be free for the summer. Sorry to anyone 
that mailed me directly and has not received a prompt reply through 
the week. This shouldn't happen over the summer as I now have time to 
check my mail daily (+ weekends). Also, I will be addressing comments 
in a small highlight segment each week. Any replies to questions or 
helps I wish to send will now be mailed individually as small 
seperate mailings addressing that subject.

Please be sure and stop by the Parrottsoft website over the weekend, 
as I am going to be finishing up the About area and adding a *NEW* 
area: the Projects area, where I will put all information on the 
current projects (of course) that are under work including 
screenshots and specs (this will include the moving of Eventuator (my 
3-D Doom-er, remember?) and the addition of the Cafe engine to that 
page.) Thanks for the patience whilst I work on these areas.

Also, one more thing, thanks to everyone who has stopped by during 
the past couple of weeks, *and*, to anyone that has not sent a link 
to their homepage in the past, please do so by tommorrow night, as I 
will not be updating the links page for a couple of days there after. 
I currently have the following:

Falconsoft, Mushroom pd, Fly-by-night (Giark), --Murray--, Bob 
Ackerburg, Lonestar (Ben Wyatt), Braneloc @ mirex (Keith Hill), 
Daryll Lewis, and John Bintz.

*Note: Like I said, if you want your name on this list, submit your 
link to me (with a link to a graphic as well if you have one and want 
your link represented WITH a graphic, such as a logo).

Thanks for reading.
Long live the Amiga!

Well, I don't have a 1200, but I do have a 3000 which I use for 
programming (and the Object Modeller too) and there does seem to be 
some flicker. I'm not sure, but I think the flickering is due to 
my '030, or it could be the Workbench (2.1), as I don't think OM was 
designed under to specifically run error-free under a 2.1 Workbench, 
not to mention an 030. Anyhow, anyone have any ideas on this?

The reaction when I asked Europress about the omission of STOS and AMOS
on the page outlining the company's history really says it all: 'We don't
see any reason to put the names of those programs there -- why don't you
switch to something like Klick'n'Play if you want support?'

Muhaha. That load of junk? (I wonder how much money they made with all
copies of STOS, AMOS and the extensions like 3D, compilers, and so on. Man-
darin and Europress would be absolutely nowhere if it wasn't for these two.)

I know it's been asked before here, but what happened to all the guys of
the first hour? Francois? The Fothergills? Richard Vanner? Peter Hickman?
Sandra Sharkey?

I guess asking Europress to do so can't hurt. At least your stuff is 'legal'
then :-).

Definitely.

One Lister said on the List several weeks ago that he traded e-mail with
Francois, and F. said he still retained the AMOS rights, but had no plans.

Can't hurt, but several have talked to Europress and got nowhere.

The Fothergills (Aaron) etc have disappeared many years ago, his AMOS club
hadits extensions authorization removed about 4 years ago, and no further word.

Brian Bell from Mr. AMOS Club still sells AMOS shareware in the UK, his ad
appears from time to time in the UK coverdisk mags.  If IRD recall, all his
products, Space Fighter, Charlie Chimp II, etc are in one package for about
10UK pounds.

Mark Schultz, editor of AMOS Club USA is doing peecee stuff.  When he folded
the club many months ago he followed Bell's classy act, and returned any unused
membership money.  Good on yer, Mark.

Jason Hutchins, Code Clinic editor and general wiz from Aussie AMOS club is
doing mostly Amiga C and E, and will not touch a PC until "hell freezes over." 
He sent a cool dungeon engine (Wolfenstein clone) done in E.

The Tuckers, editors of Totallly AMOS, declared all past issues of TA were
hence PD when they folded (like Europress should do), still maintain the
Library as far as I know.  But they have moved to St. Lawrence Bay ... if you
want their complete address let me know.  Great job Annie ... love ya.

The fantastic AMOSzine folded many months ago, and although the last editors
have quit, the foundvFing editor, Steve at F1, still maintains control. He
sells the Pro Compiler with AMOS Pro upgrade for about 15 UKP.  Lee Bamber, the
main code wiz and wild man, took his portfolio of stuff to an interview at
Europress, and landed a full time coding job on PC's.  His departing article
was a great laugh at the multitude of coding hassles on miserable PC's.

Well, Gateway, who now owns the Amiga rights, is saying little about
development, but they have a blurb on their web site at:
 http://biz.yahoo.com/news/gate.html

Ah, the good ol' days ... are we now destined to become just a hobby group like
the Atari guys?  or will the Amiga reclaim the niche in graphics that it
deserves?

I've found that the modeler update (on a coverdisk) would work properly on wb
2.1 but I have not found one that works with wb3.1 at all.

I need people with direct Internet connections to try out WebView 2.1i.  
I turned the off-line page viewer into an online page viewer, A.K.A. a 
browser.  I also built in an SMTP mailer (rather cheesy looking, but it 
works).  Any takers?

I agree, however, if several have tried, and failed, that should be a 
readily obvious sign that it doesn't matter and that Europress does 
not even give a flip.

No it is not. Sorry about that. It was a typo, so let me clear up 
the confusion here and now. What I meant was "thanks goes to 
everybody who has visited my site recently." Now, different subject: 
" I also need anyone that has not sent me a link to their page in the 
past that would like to see posted on my site, please e-mail it to

Is there any possibility to play Anim-5 format animations?
Not these standard one-palette-iff-animations! I mean
the new iff-animations with a single palette for each picture in
the animation!

Greetings, Lonestar.

I don't think so, but I wanted the same thing and solved it by storing the
palette for each frame in a bank and then changed the colours for each frame
directly in AMOS. Works fine.

I just wanted to clear this up. ECS has up to 2MB chip ram.  Most machines
only came with hardware to support 1MB though.  My 3000 came with 2MB chip
ram.  If you got a DKB megachip or similar product you can have 2MB on both
your 2000 and 500.  As far as I know, the only ECS machines capable of 2MB
without such extra hardware were the A500+, A600(?), and A3000.  I could be
wrong about those, but my ECS A3000 definately has 2MB chip and 14MB fast.

Yes, the bottom line with any company is money, and with money no longer being
an issue regarding AMOS, what's in it for them to worry about the matter.

No, it does not. The 3000, which is actually AGA without the new display
modes, has 2 Megs of chip. ECS machines do not. The DKB megachip will expand
your CHIP memory to 2 megs, true, but I know of no one who has one.

Because that's what ECS is.

Which is not real ECS. It's a hybrid.

All those machines were the ECS hybrid machines. Normal ECS machines don't
have 2meg chip capability.

The 3000 was the first machine to introduce ECS.  It was years later that AGA
was produced in the 4000.  Are you thinking about OCS?

OCS- Original Chip Set- Resolutions 320x200-640x400 upto 512k chip, used in
A1000, early A500,A2000
ECS- Enhanced Chip Set- Resolutions as OCS plus the productivity modes, upto
2 megs chip ram, used in later A500,A2000, A500+,A600,CDTV, introduced in
the A3000.  ECS could be seen as a kind of hybrid of OCS and AGA.
AGA- Advanced Graphics Archetecture- ECS modes plus all the good stuff!  used
in A1200,A4000,CD32

There are both 1MB and 2MB capable ECS Agnus chips.  Both can use less than
the maximum. Alot of the A500's with only 512k really have an ECS Agnus. 
The ECS Denice is not required for 1MB chip ram, only for the ECS screen
modes.

The reason an A2000, or A500 can't get 2MB of chip ram is that the
motherboards were designed before ECS.  There aren't enough address lines on
the board to use more than 1MB of chip ram.  The MagaChip puts the extra
chip ram on a board with a 2MB capable Agnus chip.

I'm not trying to be a d*ck, I'm just trying to clear up why he said ECS.:) 
The people with OCS can't play the game because they CAN'T get 2 megs of
chip ram.

I solved this by reading out the palette from the CMAP chunk by  hand  each

This is how the anim-playing routine could look like...

Hello,
Can anybody please help me on this

I have an AmosPro program, and trying to change one of its screens. The
original screen file is an iff file sizing 352X256. This size should be
kept because of its dependence to the rest of the program.
I edited the file with dpaint (version 4) and kept the original picture
size in its screen format and saved the file.
When I load this new iff file in AmosPro, The screen is shifted to the
left.
If I change the screen size to the standard size in screen format, I
won't get the shifting, but the screen is smaller (320X256). The screen
format does not gives any option for setting the screen size to 352X256.

Can anybody please tell me, How can I avoid this shifting or shift the
screen to the right in dpaint before saving.



Thanks
Sara

No $ 2475 US does not sound good to me for that kind of money I can by a very

What do you mean with 'is shifted to the left'? That the left part of your
picture disappears, and only the right 'side' of the picture is visible?
Have you tried opening up your own screen with the dimensions 352x256, and
restricting the display size with Screen Display? Then you should be able
to load your picture without the 'shifting' effect -- but in order to view
the picture you'd have to scroll the screen manually. I've done it scores
of times with a Monopoly game.

Aha -- like I said: open up a screen the size of your picture, and then
narrow the width of the view using Screen Display.

It was some time since I did any AMOS stuff but if I'm not completely
insane, that's because the screen opened by AMOS wants to be centered on
the display. the function to deal with this is Screen Display with this
syntax: Screen Display number,x,y,width,height.
Just the thing to fix it all.

I don't know if I saw it here or on a newsgroup, but I remember someone asking

trapezoid for the Americans out there).

I came across an old message by Andy Church in the list's archives that
explains it all.

I hope it is appropriate to remail it here.

  Wow.  I remember this stuff from graphics class.  Real messy for the
general case, at least as far as I got in it... I never actually finished
implementing it.  I'll try to explain as best I can... but it's going to
use some advanced math.  (Anyone else who has time and knows this, feel
free to explain further, or correct me as necessary, or write up code.  I'm
way too busy for any of that. <sigh>)

  First off, you have the mapping direction backwards.  Although it's
counter-intuitive at first, you have to map *from* the polygon *to* the
320x320 bitmap.  This is so that you draw each pixel on the polygon exactly
once.  If you go the other way, then you'll either draw the same pixel
multiple times (if the polygon is smaller than the bitmap) or you'll have
spaces between pixels (if the polygon is larger).

  Second, those have to be 3D coordinates, not 2D.  You'll need a Z
coordinate to go with each of the Y coordinates.  I usually have Z increase
going away from the viewer, with the screen being a plane of the form z=c (c
is a constant).

  Anyway, this is the algorithm:

- Pick one corner of the polygon to be your origin.  (Let's use X1,Y1,Z1.)

- Let the two edges containing the origin be vectors p and q.  (I told you
this was going to use advanced math...)  Keep in mind that these will be 3D
vectors.  For this example, p is (X1,Y1,Z1)-(X2,Y1,Z1) and q is
  (X1,Y1,Z1)-(X3,Y2,Z2).

- Let the two edges containing the matching corner of the bitmap be vectors p'
and q'.  Ugh, that was a messy sentence.  Let me use a diagram:

       ________p________             __p'__
      /.................\           |......|
   q /.    .......       \          |..    |
    /.            ......  \       q'|. .   |
   /.                   ...\        |.  .  |
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~        |.   . |
                                    |.    .|
                                     ~~~~~~
- For each point M:

    - Find values of a and b such that ap + bq = M.  For the general case,
this gets tricky; if you know that one of the vectors is horizontal, though,
it becomes easier.  Smething like this should work:

A#=((M(x)-X1)*1.0)/(X2-X1)
B#=((M(y)-Y1)*1.0)/(Y2-Y1)

      That may look like it won't work because X3-X4 seems longer than
      X1-X2.  But in 3D coordinates, those are actually the same size.
      Those two lines are obviously not the most efficient way of doing
      things; they're merely pseudocode.  (I use the M(x) notation to
      mean "the x component of M".)

    - Find the corresponding point M' on the bitmap; M' = ap' + bq'.

    - Get the color of that pixel on the bitmap and plot it in the
      polygon.


  It's late at night, so I might have missed something, gotten something
completely wrong, etc... again, anyone else who knows this stuff, just
correct me as necessary. <yawn>

Greetings.

Thought I would throw my two cents worth on the table about this 
little arguement on the Chip set in the Miggie:

It started with Schitso:
> I just wanted to clear this up. ECS has up to 2MB chip ram.  Most
> machines only came with hardware to support 1MB though.  My 3000 
> came with 2MB chip ram.  If you got a DKB megachip or similar 
> product you can have 2MB on both your 2000 and 500.  As far as I 
> know, the only ECS machines capable of 2MB without such extra 
> hardware were the A500+, A600(?), and A3000.  I could be wrong about 
> those, but my ECS A3000 definately has 2MB chip and 14MB fast.

I own and program on my 3000 as well. When I got mine, it came with 
the 2M Agnus in it, only with 1M currnetly installed (and this is 
still the case). I still have yet to add an extra 1M (even though 
I've seriously considered it. If anyone knows, btw, where I could 
locate some extra memory for it, mail me. I cannot recall at the 
moment what type of memory it needs).

Anyhow, Giark retorted:
> I just wanted to clear this up. ECS has up to 2MB chip ram.

No, it does not. The 3000, which is actually AGA without the new
display modes, has 2 Megs of chip. ECS machines do not. The DKB
megachip will expand your CHIP memory to 2 megs, true, but I know
of no one who has one.

> Most machines only came with hardware to support 1MB though.
Because that's what ECS is.

> My 3000 came with 2MB chip ram.
Which is not real ECS. It's a hybrid.

[about the Megachip]
All those machines were the ECS hybrid machines.
Normal ECS machines don't have 2meg chip capability.

> The 3000 was the first machine to introduce ECS.  It was years later
> that AGA was produced in the 4000.  Are you thinking about OCS?

Obviously he was. Now, here's Schitso's reply to Giark's retort
(with my own comments included and ">>" is Giark, ">" is Schitso)..

>> All those machines were the ECS hybrid machines. Normal ECS
>> machines don't have 2meg chip capability.

> OCS- Original Chip Set- Resolutions 320x200-640x400
> upto 512k chip, used in A1000, early A500, A2000

I've heard it also "Old", too.

> ECS- Enhanced Chip Set- Resolutions as OCS plus the productivity
> modes, upto 2 megs chip ram, used in later A500, A2000, A500+, A600,
> CDTV, introduced in the A3000. ECS could be seen as a kind of hybrid
> of OCS and AGA.

That last comment: "ECS could be seen as a kind of hybrid of OCS and 
AGA." can be true, it can be seen as one, but its NOT. ECS is a steup 
up from OCS and a steup below AGA.

> AGA- Advanced Graphics Archetecture-
> ECS modes plus all the good stuff! used in A1200,A4000,CD32

> There are both 1MB and 2MB capable ECS Agnus chips.  Both can use
> less than the maximum. Alot of the A500's with only 512k really have
> an ECS Agnus. The ECS Denice is not required for 1MB chip ram, only
> for the ECS screen modes.
 
> The reason an A2000, or A500 can't get 2MB of chip ram is that the
> motherboards were designed before ECS.  There aren't enough address
> lines on the board to use more than 1MB of chip ram.  The MagaChip
> puts the extra chip ram on a board with a 2MB capable Agnus chip.

>From my understanding of the Chipset, this is true.
 
> I'm not trying to be a d*ck..
Neither am I..

> I'm just trying to clear up why he said ECS.:) The people with OCS
> can't play the game because they CAN'T get 2 megs of chip ram.

My thoughts exactly. It's also true.

My IRC nick is "Axianator". Everyone knows Andy's nick here I think 
(Mush, of course). Chris (Hodges, Amcaf man) is on as "Platon42" (any 
other nicks you use Chris?). Both me and Andy chat alot amongst 
ourselves via IRC for just a bit during the evenings, usually on 
Fridays a little longer. I'm previously have not been on during the 
day, however, since the arrival of summer, I'll have the opportunity 
for more time during the day. Here's some answers in case youre lost:

1. I'm on as Axianator.
2. It's usually Andy (he's on all day), sometimes me.
3. I'm usually on during evenings and Fridays.
4. The channel has not changed, it's still #Amoslist.
5. It's not dead, just a little vacant. :)
6. Come on and chat with us (if you can find one of us!)

> Also, why are the so many TORI Amos channels?
Well, she used to be (may still be) quite popular.

Well, howdy hi there once more, AMOS pop-pickers!!

Im not sure if all of you know yet (although Mr. Parrotsoft and Mr. Hodges do)
I have begun deliberating bringing the alt.religion.amos newsgroup to the
united states, from the dingy little Demon Internet server it lies upon, doing
 nothing of any use to anyone, except getting annoying little people posting
"Is this a Tori Amos group?"

Well, it isnt.

Its the roiginal AMOS newsgroup set up by Paul Burkey, and a former co-ed Carl
Drinkwater, who later abandoned the newsgroup and left Paul in the shite also.

I have received a conformation for the alt.irc.peacefull newsgroup (also from
the UK, an IRC channel I like to hang out on in IRCnet) and I specifically put
in the booster to send a CC: directly back to this list, but havent seen
diddley squat yet.

According to some chap who monitors all these stuff, both my groups have been
confirmed, and all we have to do now is hope that each mailserver decides to
add this adorable little group onto their list. I had a nice long argument
with our Redrose Tech support bloke, who didnt even know what a booster was,
or what it did, and didnt even know the parent servers there news is channeled
from.

So, re-load in your newsgroup lists and look for alt.religion.amos, after all,
it should be there any time now (probbbly monday afternoon).

My address is in the thing, meaning that I will probbably have to do an FAQ,
so any ideas/suggestions then please give me a buzz on the ol'
you-know-whatter, or find me on #AMOSList or #AMOS on IRCNet.

All the best

Mush

Is this true?  I always thought that with a graphics card, such as the Piccasso IV, then you could have extra CHIP RAM installed on it.  Has anybody got one who would like to set me straight?

Load the Screen into AMOS.

Save it. It will now be 352X256. 

Go into DPaint. Load the picture. Select the brush tool. Press F10 to remove
the title bar and tools. Use the RIGHT mouse button to pick up the screen.
Centre it and press the LEFT mouse button to paste it. Save that.

Sounds like either 3.1 or something else in your setup
is the problem then, because the coverdisk OM works
nicely here on 3.0


And to whoever wanted that Amos3D starfield example, it
(along with a few other bits of code I dug out of the

Ok, where`s that sledgehammer and set of G-clamps...

You can add extra graphics memory to gfx cards, but only
for the onboard gfx chip to use.  Now, there are some
patches that`ll allow unused gfx card memory to be seen
as Fast RAM by the system, but adding Chip RAM like this
is out of the question.

Surely all DPaint versions since 4.5 allow the user to choose any screen
size (>=320*256) he/she wishes? I use DPaint V and I think I could use a
screen size of 352*256 anytime I so desire. Use the "Custom" option in
DPaint's "screen size" gadget to do this.

The subject line is a bit misleading. I have hardly had the time to do
anything about my Future of Amos Homepage.

I added a little to the AMOS list archive's digest. You can now read the
history of the future of AMOS until september 1994. Nothing exciting has
happened in the updated period, though.

I also fixed some minor things.

BTW, does anyone know if the links to Francois Lionet's email address actually
work, and if this is _the_ Francois?

The updated pages are:
http://www.xs4all.nl/~collin/amiga/foah.html (the FoA Homepage)
http://www.xs4all.nl/~collin/amiga/foahlinks.html (the links)

I had a few requests to enhance the graphics of my game to suit
GFX-CARDS.  Is this possible through AMOS?
I have also added a GamesTips link to my page for all of you wanting to

Just a thought, when AMOS saves out an IFF ILBM, it adds a few
extra chunks to re-establish the screen offsets in use at the time
it was saved. To 'fix' a picture that requires this, you have to
save it from AMOS after setting the appropriate offsets. You should
also be able to adjust the program to compensate.

Additions
---------

MUSIC

I have added more music modules to my collection due to popular demand. I have
added modules such as that of Jesus on E's, budbrain and themes from games
like Silkworm, to keep all you module nutta's out there all nice and relaxed.
Jesus on E's is in 3 parts, as the entire demo was split up into 15 odd tunes,
and is an excellent techno/rave tune to appease any music fan.

The budbrain archive contains the musics from the first budbrain demo release,
including the excellent Kaosmodule, which again is another great techno tune.

AMOS ACCESSORIES

I've been scouting about on Aminet, and have added a few cool AMOS utils, one
of which is supposed to hack compiled AMOSPro executables, and make them more
like multitasking programs. this can be found in Accessories/AMOS_Patch.Lha
and I havent tried it yet, so dont know if it works.

Other accessories include a new sprite/bob editor, an Intuitive editor using
the resource bank systems in AMOS for ease of use, rather than having long and
complex source to do the simplist of GUI interfaces. I also have a system file
which shows how to use reqtools operationd from within AMOS.

EXTENSIONS

I have added the latest AMOS GUI extension (now V1.62) and the AMOS P61
extension. I haven't added the Falcon extension at thsi time, as there is
currently a new demo version underway and so I wont probbaly add it till
during the week.

SOURCE CODE

A few source code files this time. I have added an update to some procedures
which allow you to draw full WB-type windows in AMOS, like the standard WB
would do them. Very handy at times. There are also lots of AMOS game source
code in there too, which you can find more information about if you go into
the SOURCE CODE boxes.


AND WHAT WAS ORDERED IN THE LAST FORTNIGHT?

Rather than bore you with every individual title that was ordered from the
library, I will just put down the total number of orders I have received for
each section of the library. Note that starting next week, I shall be adding
graphs etc. to my homepages to show these results in a nicer form.

Week commencing April 21st to May 4th

   Accessories: 5
Disk Magazines: 3
    Extensions: 18
        Source: 19

          Docs: 2

Total of 77 individual orders

* - I made postings to all usenet newsgroups over the period of 3 days
advertising these sections of my library, in order to bring visitors from all
computer formats to the site and learn more about AMOS


Week commencing May 5 to May 11 1997

       Samples: 35
         Music: 82

It depends on what`s currently eating Chip RAM.  For instance,
before I added the gfx card to my setup, I used to go through
a well rehearsed routine when I wanted to run a Chip RAM
hungry bit of software from Workbench:

Close all the windows
Remove the backdrop images
Reduce the screen to 1 bitplane
Reduce the resolution (only in extreme cases)
Run the software

Now I just:

Run the software

because whereas originally my Workbench screen was sitting in
Chip RAM, now it`s sitting on the gfx card, and therefore
consumes approximately zero Chip RAM (after WB has finished
loading, I have 1.9MB free Chip RAM, compared to approximately
1.2MB free without the gfx card).


But note that I still only have 2MB of Chip RAM in total,
the gfx card does nothing to alter that limit.  All it does
is let certain well behaved bits of software run on the
card instead of the AGA hardware, which frees up Chip RAM for
those programs that absolutely MUST have it.  But it doesn`t
extend the Chip RAM limit beyond that imposed by the
custom chipset, so a 1MB Chip RAM Amiga will still be a 1MB
Chip RAM Amiga, gfx card or no gfx card.

Is there anything better in the registered version of Turbo then 
there is on the latest PD Aminet version?

I don't really use it at the moment but may if anything was newer.

Greetings.

Whilst on the subject of IRC nicks, thought I might add:

1. I use stealth.net's server most of the time. I used to run Efnet 
via netcom, but since everyone on the list uses and Ircnet server, I 
quit using Efnet servers.

2. Like I said, my nick is "Axianator" and my real name is Adam, btw.

For those wondering, Demon's server (irc.demon.co.uk), Netcom in the 
UK (irc.netcom.net.uk), Stealth's (irc.stealth.net) are all Ircnet 
servers and you'll find someone using a server of the like using any 
of these. Don't be concerned though, there are PLENTY of other Ircnet 
servers around. Those were just a few to name.

I don't think there is. The lastest version of the REGISTERED Turbo 
is 2.0, which I have. I don't think there is anything later than 
that. I haven't been to Aminet to check, so you'll have to let me 
know if there is anything later than that.

Greetings.

Acutally, it's bi-weekly hightlights to be technical.

Just thought I would let everyone know that I finally finished my 
studies today and that I'm free for the summer! Look for me on Irc 
during the day at about Noon to Evening (-0500 GMT).

Also, check on my site this week and coming weekend. I'll be burning 
up the computer trying to slap these pages up on my site!

Thanks for reading. Long live the Miggie!

What he is trying to say, is do your games run literally in different
screenmodes, like DblPAL etc. for VGA only monitors and stuff. The guy thinks
that the project or whatever is not written in AMOS, but maybe C \or ASM, and
wants you tell him if you can make it run in any other screen lace modes.

Example

If you hit your prefs/screenmode, you can change the screenmode your monitor
is displayed in. If you try and select productivity with a 1084 monitor and
hit USE it totally messes up the display, as it runs at a much higher Hz rate.
This is the kind of screenmmodes he is asking about, so people with PC
monitors who need these ridiculous screenmodes can play your games.

Dont do that productivity thing, as it might toast your monitor, and I dont
want to be responsible!!

An A3000 is _definitely_ compatible with AMOSpro. I used AMOSpro a lot
on my A500 with 1 MB memory, and it worked fine. You only need a 7 MHz
68000 processor and no graphics boards to run it. In fact, you could be
better off without the graphics board. I think.

	Larry,
	Maybe the guys from the list can correct mif I'm wrong here,
there's been all kinds of postings about Amos and 030's lately. but I own
two A3000's and run Amos on one of them and have never had a problem with
it, I doubt you could get it to support a Piaccasso board, but if I recall
right that board has a vidoe pass-thru for using normal Amiga modes
anyway.  I think all the postings about 030 problems proble stemmed from
incompatible accelerator boards since that's not an unheard of story.  So
I guess the moral of the story is if you've got the money don't pass up
the oppurtunity, the 3000 is a buetiful machine, easily the best number
commodore ever made, honestly tossing aside Motorola's incompetance (and
even still an 030 isn't all that slow for an Amiga) I'd wager to say the
3000 is still a good machine even by today's crazy PC standards, and for a
machine made in 1990 that's saying quite a bit. 
			Thanks,

	Andy,
	Looks to me like this guy is reffering to say A1200 and
A4000 owners who only have VGA monitors and not C= 1080s, you see this is
how it works, normal Amiga screen modes (all those available to a 500,
600, 2000, 1000, ect.) are sent out of the Amiga as 15 htz (that's
the refresh rate) video.  But 15 htz is too slow to handle deep screens
that's why anything over 200 (256 PAL)  pixels in height will flicker like
mad, these are the interlace screen modes and I've always been of the
opinion that their utterly worthless but maybe somebody out there knows
better than i.  At any rate, AGA machines can put out two types of video,
15 htz for normal Amiga video modes, and 31 htz for flicker-free output of
video modes with more than 200/256 pixels of height.  Now this 31 htz
video out is the kind of thing you'd hook up to a VGA monitor, whereas the
15 htz would go to say a C= 1080.  Now the 31 htz out will output
normal Amiga modes, but on AGA machines it'll actually do it in 15 htz, 
The problem is that a 31 htz monitor needs to recieve 31 htz signal,
so-called multisync monitors can take signals from several htz ranges but
most (even some of Commodores) won't sync to 15 htz (mainly because it's
insanely low for a refresh rate, most PCs get aroun 60-90 htz these days,
as do Amiga gfx boards)  So the trick is alot of Amiga A1200 owners
have monitors that will only take 31 htz output, so when there amiga trys
to display a 15 htz Normal Amiga Video mode screen, they'll jsut get crap,
fuzz and such from there monitor.  Now the solution to this is to a) buy a
harware flicker fixer which will double the 15 htz signal to 31 htz before
it leaves the Amiga make it safe for 31 htz monitors, (the A3000 has one 
of these built in, so if you're listening Larry one more reason to buy!) 
or b) to run the software flicker fixer that comes with AGA machines, this
program will do the same thing as the Hardware flicker fixer, but the
trick is it must be run first, so if your game runs from WB your fine
since the user can just run the flicker fixer before opening your game,
but if your game has it's own boot disk then you're effectively screwed, I
guess there maybe some way around this but I don't know for sure, and I
reckon it's probly a pain in the ass for the user.
		Well that covers it good luck,
			Scott Matott sXe
		PS
		I have no clue what the sound comment meant,
		anyone?

I've started an extension long time ago, but never got anywhere, but  there
are two starfields implemented (pretty fast though).

Here's the extension and a demo program. Extension Slot is #15.  Sorry,  no
docs  available.  The NUMST variable in the demo program defines the number
of stars to appear.

The Pro works fine on my A3000 ... don't know about the Picasso board.
Here the 3000's sell for about $500 Can. with monitor = $350 U.S.

Well, Mush has already dealt with the screenmode thing, although
I`ll just add my 0.02p and say I think this publisher is
perhaps taking things a little far when they suggest people
won`t buy games if they don`t promote.  How many Amiga users
who buy games don`t have either a 15KHz capable display OR
a 31+KHz monitor and a scandoubler?

As to the AHI thing, that`s a newish retargettable audio
system, which means you can write your audio routines without
needing to know what sort of audio hardware the Amiga has
got.  Don`t forget, Paula is no longer the only option...
It probably won`t surprise you to learn that the AMOS audio
routines have as much awareness of AHI as the graphics
routines do of CyberGfx.

In either case, you could write your own routines to
support both 31+KHz screenmodes and AHI, but it won`t be
a walk in the park.  


In my case, the most important things to me when looking
at a new game are:

Is it HD installable, will it work on my setup without me
having to degrade, degrade, degrade.  And most importantly.
is it the sort of game I would want to buy.

I don`t really care if a game doesn`t make full use of my
Amiga, the CV64, 060 and all that memory was added to
make my serious Amiga life more enjoyable.  If a game makes
use of the extras, then that`s a bonus, but that`s all.

The last game I bought was Worms DC.  No gfx card support,
no 31KHz screenmode support, no AHI support.  But it
installs, it runs without any hassle from my patched and
hacked Workbench setup and when I quit, I get the system
back in exactly the same state that I left it.  Plus, it`s
damn good fun.  What more do I want from a game?

Hello, this my first post on the ML, and I'll start off with a small
announcement/question ;-

We are currently putting the finishing touches on our new Amos Aga Library,
and we'd like to know if there is anything you would like to see included.

Current features of Amos Aga Library:

- Total hardware AGA screens, including 24 bit screens.
- Whole new Sprite/Bob engine, MUCH faster than amos' original.
- Supports most music formats.
- Own animation system, WITH realtime 2*2/4*4/2*4/4*2 zooming.
- Hardware scrolling, including 24 bit QUAD scrolling.
- Complete Zone and Mouse support.
- And much MUCH more....

In future there will also be support for graphic cards and many more cool
things!

Look out for the first demo release soon! The price is not yet definitive
but will probably be around 12 UKP.

If you'd like anything else to be included then mail me and I'll pass your
suggestions on to the coder. I am not the coder of the library, he is not
connected to the 'net, but I'll pass all your comments on to him.

Stay fresh.

At first I thought "drool", then I realised we have seen most of it
before. The big question is: Does it do Bobs on the Aga screen?

     I would like to see video card support.  I got a Picasso card instead
of AGA, so otherwise the extention has no use to me.  Also, it would be best
to make both versions work with the same commands or atleast ignore some
commands without giving an error, so programs would work on AGA or RTG.

There I go wishing to have everything again....

I am also a diehard Amos user as well!

Getting to the point, I own several (3) Amigas and one of them I use 
to program/test is on my A3000 (25mz '030). Both Pro and the Compiler 
work great on all my Amigas, including the 3000.

OOOH this looks good. I hope that you have some sort of demo available now, or
very soon in the future. The closest AGA extension that i have seen only
displays an AGA screen with a PPMore-type command. This indeed, sounds very
nice!

# In future there will also be support for graphic cards and many more cool
# things!

I hope so. AMOS needs a real good AGA extension to really give our projects
that extra bit of kick that they neeed.

# Look out for the first demo release soon! The price is not yet definitive
# but will probably be around 12 UKP.

That sounds reasonable. When the demo version is released, please email it to
me also with a Readme file, and I will upload it to my AMOS homepages right
away.

Subject: Sorta AMOS related :-P
Status: O
X-Status: 


  Ok, one more weird post from Schitso....

Is there a PC program which relays input from one com port to output on
another?  There is a PC program for everything, so this has to have been
done, either for this purpose or to relay long distance serial connections.

My problem is that at the moment I have only an internal PC modem.  I hate
PC's.  Slow PC's for sure.  I want to hook my Amiga up to a PC with a null
modem cable.  The program would read the input from com A and write it out
to com B,the modem.  Then read from com B and write it out to com A, the one
connected to the Amiga.  Would this not make the PC the worlds most costly
external modem?  The transfer rate is not all that high in my case, as it is
only a 14.4 modem, although a higher rate could be useful later.

And finally, how it relates to AMOS....

This PC is a 8MB 486 SX40.  It is a real pain to browse on and my mailbox
gets so full the machine cannot handle it and I loose acces to my mail.  I
have to borrow a modem long enough to check it on the Amiga.  Without
something like this I loose access to the AMOS list and sources on the
internet.

If someone knows where to get it or how to write it let me know! PLEASE! I am
too broke to buy a modem right now and have no PC programming knowledge.

Thanks in advance,

Schitso

(I missed the original mail)

I take it you mean the objects, as the (rendered) pictures are either in IFF,
or can be converted to IFF by the program itself.

But a generic 3D-format for AMOS would be nice. It should be made in such a
way, that loss of detail makes things speedier. So people with slow computers
can still play games made with this format.

I don't know it since there isn't any history file and I have never had
v2.0. BTW it probably has just some bug-fixes.

I got it directly from the author and it's the registered version, so please,
don't ask me to send.
I had to wait for a LONG while before having it since Manuel is not used to
reply mail very often... I waited for over a year! :-(

< A rather large, and bandwidth-saving SNIP>

#                                 Well that all I can think of for now. 

I would also love to see a heck of a lot of those things in the extension
also. Good thing my friend typed them all before I did, saved me the trouble!!
 ;)

I would also like to see (as far as GFX systems see) A nice and fast way of a
C2P extension, and some texture mapping commands, as the routines I am working
on in AMOS at the moment is rather slow. We should be able to assign the
command, a tile no in memory (of the original image), and the coords for all 4
corners of the object. The ASM in the extension should then do the t/map
instantaneuously.

I would also like to be able to see the use of different screenmodes. Like the
above gentleman wanted the use of Super-Hires screens, well, I would like to
be able to use screens defined in DEVS/MONITORS such as maybe productivity and
Euro72.

Hi,

Just two questions, well ones more of a request..

Some person was talking about an AGA extesnsion he was writing and
and  Pietro Ghizzoni asked if it's bobs were faster than power bobs

>>>- Whole new Sprite/Bob engine, MUCH faster than amos' original.
>>faster than PowerBobs?

What are powerbobs? and where can I get the extension. Are they much 
faster than amos own?

And does anyone want to sell me a fairly cheap copy of TOME, preferably
someone in the UK to save getting money converted etc..
I was told that the guy who used to sell it has run of or something.

thanks,

Rd

I just want to connect the Amiga to one of the PC's comm ports and have
access to the internal modem.  The Amiga would react asif the PC were just
an external modem.  The PC would route data to/from the comm port and the
internal modem.  Absolutely no software would be needed on the Amiga side
other than the normal online software.

You are the first I have heard of to try this.  How did you attempt to do it?
 How did it fail?  It seems to me you could just have a program read the
input of the comm port(the Amiga's commands) and write it to the modem. 
Then read the modem's info(incomming data) and send it out through the comm
port to the Amiga.

Are there timing problems?It seems to me you could perform all the copy
commands in the program as fast as possible as long as no data was repeated.

Thanks for the help, but everything is set fine, it is the hardware limiting
my software choice and the software is no good.  I have Twin Express to get
downloaded software to the Amiga, but I want use of that darn modem.

I used to have a P133/32MB with a 33.6 but I traded it for my current Amiga
after my other Amiga died.  This is a spare parts computer with no floppy
and no CD.  I happened to have a drive with DOS 6.22, Windoze 3.11 and old
internet softs on it.  I downloaded Netscape 3.01 but it was too memory
hungry, and crashed constantly.  My IP said this can be a problem with only
8MB.  So I am now useing the old buggy Intergo dialer, TCP, and mail with
Internet Explorer for a browser.  If I had this program I could put it in
the autoexec.bat and just turn on the PC, no PC monitor or other crap, when
I was going online with my wonderful Amiga, just as if it were a modem

I know the obvious thing is to upgrade the PC or buy another modem for the
Amiga but I have no money!  I WILL NOT buy anything for a PC.  I plan to buy
a very nice modem for the Amiga, but that will have to wait, as my children
need to eat for some strange reason. :-P

Also, wouldn't this help alot of people with both PC's and Amiga's who would
rather only buy one modem?  Internal modems are quite cheap compared to
externals.  It could help get more Amiga's on the net.

I know that on a mailing list full of programmers, SOMEBODY can pull this
off.

Oh yea, the AMOS part - I love AMOS Pro!

That's why we made it. :) Amos is a fine language but it could use a kick

Righto. As I said, it's currently in debugging stages; we may add anything
we can throw at it, but it's as good as finished.

Just wait a little longer... it's in debugging stage right now. A demo will

This wouldn't be too difficult to add. I'll suggest it.

You can load AGA screens if that's what you mean. Not too sure about saving
though. I'll ask.

They're 'real' in the sense that you can use and manipulate them just as
you would normal Amos screens.

I'm afraid I'm not familiar with PowerBobs... sorry.

Yep :) There's much demand for gfx card compatible software nowadays...

Thanks! And the demo will be available very soon!

Erm, Thomas Verduin, alias Protonic. A member of Jolly, if you know them.
(Ooh, and I'm a member of them too, so don't go slagging them off :))

Will do! I hope you'll be happy with it when it arrives. Most of the

That's what I asked for.. so the people we are programming it for can

The extension is available on aminet in the dev/amos directory, and it's
much faster than Amos. It's shareware, and the author is manuel andre!

     Has anyone tried the Falcon Extension yet?  I had never heard of it. 
They wrote me a responce about the modem problem I have and included their
homepage address.

www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/lakes/6291

It looks interesting, but I have yet to try it.  I still have to ship it over
to the Amiga.

Why don't we all get together and create a game? I don't know if it's been

finding web sites to host it, and with the knowledge spread through this list
we could really do a good job! What do YOU think?

Sure. Could be a good idea, but the only problem is:

a) deciding on an actual game
b) deciding who wants to code what
c) sorting out the arguments of who codes what
d) some people dont like sending archives about the list

Apart from all that, im sure it would be fine. Count me in.

What about Dual Playfield with more than eight colors in each screen?
And Aga rainbows would be cool, too.

Everybody, including myself, wants to do the same games (mario-like,
doom-like, lemmings-like)
Lets think on something really new!

Heyth,

Well actually there may be a sort of AMOS clone soon to be released to 
the PC world as (very cheap) shareware later this year. DOS based
NO amal, NO multi screens though (the PC hardware is completely useless)
The compiler bit is a bit different to say the least.

The reason it was written was if  you  ever write something on the PC 
converting to the AMIGA is as easy as cross-dosing the files 
over and using paintshop pro to convert the graphics. So it means you
never have to leave the amiga behind
(and it's hard to make money out of AMIA software these days)

I'm still not sure on weither it should be finished, as I don't want
to be involved in anything betraying the AMIGA. I made that mistake
last time with the spectrum.

I would like to hear everyones comments or suggestions about it. 
And should it be threw into the nearest bin?

Rd,

I own multiple Amigas, but unfortunatly I also own SATAN`s computer. I 
was just wondering if anything like amos exists on the PC. Because I 
can`t imagine how many intelligent people are missing out on the whole 
creative side to computers. Now, it seems everyone I know can only talk 
about processor speeds and Quake. I think the PC does need a nice friendly 
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (not that frigging point and klick stuff). I know 
KLIK and PLAY is about, but really, whats the point. I usually never 
finish anything because I only really do it for the mental challenge of 
the game code!

ps If the Vectrex can survive, Amiga`s will definately NEVER DIE!

I while back I wrote a cool game, but it got pretty big. Then for no 
reason ALL the jump/looping/procedure commands couldn`t find their 
destination/connected command! eg Do without loop. No setup defined. This 
was done in 1.3 but I tried it with pro and still nothing. Was this just 
a faulty/corrupt file or is this a genuine problem. The code seems fine 
and very close to older, working versions.

Hi there folks!

I've uploaded my sources archive as promised (some lomg while ago). Some of
the programs are a couple of years old, but hopefully there is something
there for everyone. The archive is a lot smaller than I'd anticipated,
beacuse I wasn't happy with a few of the trackplayers etc. so they'll be
released later and non-buggy rather than now and bug-ridden.

The sources archive can be found on the Aminet as dev/amos/ps-sources-1.lha

Cheers


Peter.

Good idea - but why stop at only one game? We could have a platform project
and a 3d-dungeon type project going at the same time?

Count me IN.

I have to disagree.  The theory behind the idea is excellent.  Stands to   
reason that the amount of Amos expertise on this list could easily blow   
everyones' mind if it were all put into one super game but I can't see it   
becoming a reality very easily.  Mush highlighted the problems above and   
I don't think the first three are that easily dismissed.  Well, OK the   
first can be worked out.  But B & C are the snags.  Imagine the scene...   
 You've spent 3 weeks perfecting your  chunk of the 'list supergame'.  As   
far as you are concerned, it's perfect.  You give it the person   
responsible for the whole source (another problem?), a few other people   
look at it, then proceed to take your code to pieces pointing out   
everything that could be improved upon.  Sure, you accept their   
criticisms gracefully, hey some of 'em might even be valid!, you change   
it and give it back.  This loop will continue until the code is how   
someone else wants it.  Then you get the feeling that it's not actually   
your code, and it isn't.  You've been demoted to a typist...  Another   
scene:-
Your code is perfect.  You hand it to the list. It doesn't work with   
someone elses code.  Who changes their code. Is it you code that doesn't   
fit with their code or vice versa.
OK, I can see the worst case situation where all the coders have the hump   
and are coding away secretly on the whole game themselves just to prove   
everyone wrong...
Now I'm not trying to depress anyone nor judge anyone.  I'm just going by   
experience. ( I work in a software engineering company and it even   
happens here with everyone in the same building!)
Right, it's not impossible.  But a team structure will have to be worked   
out first and from then on, it should be stuck to rigidly.  Obviously a   
leader should be nominated to manage all the code segments etc. and   
he/she should have the final word on what is going in to the game and   
what gets left out and of course they should be completely impartial!
Gawd, sorry about the length of this. I'll finish off by saying that I'd   
recommend Mush as the project leader.  Reason? Well, I don't know him   
personally but I've read every mail since Feb sometime when I joined this   
list and he's always come across as a pretty fair and stable kinda guy.   
 So there!
I'll just finish off the finishing off by saying that I won't be vying   
for a place in this project (I don't even have an Amiga anymore!) and I'm   
still on the list as it keeps me abreast of any developments on the Amiga   
scene.  I'm just waiting for a nice new Amiga to come up and beat the   
crap out of my PC...
Good luck,
Mikro.

Subject: New Amiga project I am doing
MIME-Version: 1.0

X-Status: 

Hi there. Just plain old me here. I am working on a cool new project, and
seeing that everyone here is an Amiga user, I would like to know some of
your input.

Im writing a new project, which connects to a global server when your amiga
goes online. Unfortunately, I will be writing it in Blitz basic, as I think
a few people would be using AMOS whilst it is running.

It has the ability to be able to notify you when users which you add to a
list come online. For example, say I was added to some guy's list, I would
be sent a conformation telling me that I have been put on the list. Then,
whenever I go online and have my program running, the server would notify
him, and all other people with my info on it, that I am now online.

I am also going to have a WWW pager, which is issued to every user, and
anyone with a WWW browser can send them a message directly from the pages.
Its very handy, as the messages are delivered to you almost as soon as you
go online.

It can also handle online messaging, and also a DCC Chat type scenario,
which enables you to be able to chat to a user without having to run IRC
and use loads of memory for the MUI part of it. The program is being
written with the help of GadToolsBox 2.0 and incorporated into Blitz Basic
by myself.

I am proposing this here, as I would like to hear all of your comments and
suggestions. Before you blast me off for using Blitz, I intend to use this
project to bring all of us AMOS coders together with our Amiga's, as we can
all be in each others notify list etc. If you have any suggestions as to
features which should be added, then please inform me of them.

I intend to use CGI scripting to control all of the server options. I am
currently in deliberations with my redrose provider about getting me some
space so I can do my own CGI scripting. I also will be incorporating an
option for the Amiga browsers, to call them through their AREXX port for
various different options and stuff.

Anyone out there had any experience with Blitz? Im having problems actually
calling a URL (with a CGI script in the command) and actually getting the
reply back from the CGI script. Help would be nice.

Well, hope you enjoy!!

I would love to do any digitized sound or speech samples
for the game...
I have a nice library of sound effects that were made by
myself, all under 10,000 bytes each...
And I can create any other speech or effect that would be
needed....

Be careful with the size of your 'Do-Loops', etc... if they get too big
you will get a bunch of weird errors. I even have gotten:
 'Wait for disk access to stop' errors because of 'Do-Loop' lengths.
 And I have also gotten the usual 'Software Failure' errors, because
 of 'Do-Loop' lengths, you can get the same problems with too many
 goto's ,etc...
Use gosubs, and shorten the 'Do-Loops' as much as possible.

About this AMOS List Game thing... Something I've always wanted to play on my

the Gameboy is ten times the fun!

Try to save it out as ascii (save the banks aswell, if  any)  and  new  and
merge it again, if the had been something corrupt in the file it now should
be gone.

Yeah. I'd probably be in as well! 

By the way. I keep downloading the latest Falcon Extension but the 
example programs do not work (although they did with the earlier 
versions).
Are your commands all mixed up from earlier versions or something?

I have read in this list about an AGA AMOS extension. Does it indeed
exist? If so, where can I get a copy? What can this AGA extension do?
Is it a normal AMOS extension like CRAFT? Thanks in advance.

Just an enquiry. I was wondering on what the speed of AGA games made 
on AMOS (when this new extension comes along.....and if it's what it 
claims to be).  I generally make scrolling games. Now I have trouble 
getting a good speed up with half intelligent baddies, with 
only 16 colours.
Now if I tried this in 128 or 256 colours, wouldn't it be a HELL of a lot 
slower?
Also, I find AMOS use of memory to be a bit of a bastard. The amount 
of Graphics and Sound that you'd expect to see on any fair sized game 
can easily eat up 2 Meg of Chip RAM in AMOS.
Now what would this be like with 256 colours????
To be honest, although I am desperately anting to try out this new 
AGA extension. I get the feeling I won't make much use of it unless 
the outlined problems are solved.
OK. Maybe the extension will be faster than AMOS and that problem 
will be solved.
But unless anyone knows of some great ways of memory saving without 
slowing things down. (storing in FAST RAM slows it down way too much 
due to transferring make and forth), then any game is going to be 
alot smaller than the ones I make.
I have to admit, the vast majority of AMOS games I see are 
significantly smaller than mine (though no less good), how can you be 
expected to produce commercial quality with it?

Also, a thing that has REALLY been annoying me later is compatibility 
problems.
I know AMOS has problems with GFX cards etc. But could someone also 
tell me some good way of getting around using librarys?
The Compiled games always need certain librarys (arp, mathtrans 
etc.) but for one, these cannot be put on AMINET and secondly 
(although they should have) lots of people don't seem to have many 
basic librarys...or even C commands. I got someone saying they 
couldn't run my game because they didn't have the RUN command that 
the startup-script uses!!!
He was using wb3.1 , isn't run in ROM?
Ideally, I'd like to send out a game with one main file and a few 
extras that need to be loaded. Abk's and IFF pictures etc.
I don't want to fiddle with Libs, Fonts, C etc.
Anyone know how to help??

We tried this about a year ago, and nothing became of it. I really don't
know what happened - it just kind of fizzled away. I would love to be part
of such an effort - I just hope it takes off this time.

Has the code been chopped off at the bottom? This happened to me once and
I haven't been able to continue development on the program ever since! It
sometimes worked for me if I copied it over to a floppy disk!!! I think
the problem may be because the MaxTransferRate on your HD is set too high.
I don't know... I could easily be totally wrong!

try saving the file as an ASCII text, and merge it in. If i remember
rightly, he switched some of the commands about.

EEk! Me, stable? I cant even balance on a bicicle with stabilizers,
cemented to the ground. hehe.

I would like to resign as project leader, as I am too tied up in existing
projects and this latest project (see sig) to be able to listen and settle
everyones arguments.

If I had a mass of votes, then maybe I could do something, but im sure that
someone else out there would like a go.

I tried to emulate that game in AMOS a couple of months back, and it got
pushed to the back of the hard drive as usual. One day, ill get to finish
writing it, as the gameboy version is an ace game.

Greetings.

Thought I would just inform everyone that the finishing touches for 
my Web pages are being completed at this moment. I've finally 
finished rendering all the graphics and touching them up in Paint 
Shop, and Lord willing the remaining pages should be completed by the 
end of this week. I think you'll all be quite amazed (I am myself!).

Just be sure and stop by Friday I'd say, and mail me on any 
comments-suggestions you'd like to see added/improved to the site. 
Also, everyone that uses a Miggie browser (sorry to say that I don't, 
unfortunately I use Netscrape), tell me if you have any problems 
viewing any of my pages. Give me the specific problem, and I'll try 
to remedy it and fix the page. Thanks again.

Long live the Amiga (over the PC)!

On the subject of this port of AMOS to the PC:

This is true (about selling Amiga software.) The only place it seems 
to have any hope of selling would be 1.) The UK., 2.) Australia, 3.) 
The States. Kinda sad, isn't it?

I would encourage you to finish/continue it. It sounds like an 
excellent idea, although I already know someone on this list that is 
near releasing an AMOS-PC language, Pentos, by Mr. Card D. (sorry 
Carl, I can't recall your last name :) Maybe you two should 
collaborate a little bit. I think anything like AMOS on the PC that 
could has a chance of catching on or worthy of getting attention 
would be a nice wake-up call to the PC world.

> And should it be threw into the nearest bin?
If you mean a "garbage bin", by all means NO!

> If the Vectrex can survive, Amiga`s will definately NEVER DIE!
I have to agree with that statement 100%.

Greetings.

Let me start out this little (ha) piece of mail by recalling the 
statement that started this little debate, from Laurie Curwood:

> Why don't we all get together and create a game? I don't know if 
> it's been tried before, but I'm sure we could give it a good try! 
> We'll have no trouble finding web sites to host it, and with the

Well, little did Laurie probably know that this call would recieve a 
HUGE response (I recieved 35 messages from the List ALONE TODAY, most 
of them being dedicated to this subject). Let me include some the 
replies that were sent to the List:

Mr. Michael Fagan:
> I have to disagree. The theory behind the idea is excellent. Stands

The idea is an excellent one, but it does pose some problems, and the 
last three are the holders.

> Right, it's not impossible. But a team structure will have to be
> worked out first and from then on, it should be stuck to rigidly.

> completely impartial!

Well, first of all, the idea is not impossible to pull off, as 
mentioned, but the rest of what was said IS. You know how difficult 
it COULD pose (not saying that it would) to organize a team 
structure, namely the head of the team, from this LIST?

> I'll finish off by saying that I'd recommend Mush as the project
> leader. Reason? Well, I don't know him personally but I've read every

Well, I think I'll recommend myself for the position, but who said I 
wanted the position? I know I could handle it, but I don't think I 
would WANT to.

I will say that I am interested in the idea, and that if this idea 
ever becomes a reality, that I would love to be a part of it. While 
I'm at it, I would like to vy for the leader position, (yes, I'm 
recommending myself), but I have to give first place 
(programming-wise) to my current project, me Cafe engine.

One more thing on my project, I'd like to include something Mr. Peter 
Storey wrote in:

> Good idea - but why stop at only one game? We could have a platform
> project and a 3d-dungeon type project going at the same time?

Well, for one thing, one game is enough for this list at the moment, 
secondly, why would we need another 3D-dungeon style game for the 
Amiga when 1.) they're are some good ones out there, but most 
importantly, I'm writing a raycasting texture-mapping engine in AMOS 
FOR the Amiga that is 10x better that a dungeon style game anyways!?

Thanks for reading. Long live the Miggie!

We`re all adults.  These issues seem easy enough to solve.  We should
just get stuck in and begin a project.

Zelda is kid stuff all that jumping up over little rolling things if you want
a Nintendo type RPG game then Final Fantasy II is it. You could all work on
your own little parts of the story and then fuse them all together.

As far as the game goes, I am not much of a programmer yet, but I can help
with the graphics and planning.  I was going to suggest Mush or Adam Parrot
to head it up until I read their previous letters.  If no one wants it I
will do my best to keep it together, but I am sure others would be better
suited to the task.  How about Laurie Curwood?

   Most definitely!! The mere thought of what such a collaboration

   Well, there really should not be a "few other people" looking at
   it. If the person handling the integration of the modules does not
   have sufficient time to handle the task the appropriate thing to
   do would be to ask for an assistant or even a new leader. This
   would certainly be more professional then to pass the sources
   around to two or three friends...

   Yes, that would be a bit unsatisfying. The project leader/module
   integrator will need to be the most open-minded he/she has
   ever been. To accept someones module and judge it solely on
   how well the module performs it's "job", not on how well it is
   progammed, could be a tremendous challenge but, also a
   rewarding experience...



>Another scene:-

   Again, in my opinion, this would be determined by the project
   leader/module integrator. Anyone in that position should be
   prepared to spend time resolving variable-conflicts, etc.

   Very true!!

   
   This "List SuperGame" is a great idea and it is certainly possible
   to achieve as long as the necessary time is taken in the design
   stage to create a program-structure as clear and "solid" as
   possible.

   Many of the module conflicts could be avoided by setting up
   standards in this design stage. Perhaps, all modules variables
   could begin with a key letter or two, etc.

   
   I am currently involved in an on-line programming project and
   this works in the following fashion:

   The project leader creates the overall program-structure in as
   much detail as possible.

   This program-structure is then used to determine the necessary
   components and componet-parts, which are listed on a
   Web-page under the "NEEDED" heading.

   Each module is listed along with it's status, which can be
   "OPEN", "PROGRAMMING", or "INTEGRATION".

   Now, we just browse through the "OPEN" modules and select one.
   After receiving confirmation from the project leader, the coding
   of the module begins.

   Now, this module is updated, on the Web-page, with the name of
   the programmer/artist working on it and the status is changed to
   "PROGRAMMING".

   Once the module is completed, it is e-mailed to the project leader
   who performs the integration of the module into the main
   program-structure.

   Now, the module' status is updated, on the Web-page, to 
   "INTEGRATION".


   Anyway, the point is this has all been working quite well and I
   would suggest a similiar strategy be used in this project...

  
   So, these are all some important things to consider.

   In the meantime, why don't we commence with the actual game
   concept!! It seems like the best way to do this would be to have
   the nominations and voting right here in the list so, here goes...

   This is not a specific game-style but, I strongly suggest we
   choose a simple game such as PacMan, Arkanoid, etc.

   Now, before you all flame me let me explain why!!

   If we are going to do this, it makes more sense to choose a simpler
   game so we can gain experience in working together. Better to
   work out the problems in a small project before diving into a 
   mega project and having the challenge of both the supergame
   itself as well as the coordination of the development.

   Also, I think a simpler game would be better as we don't want our
   first project to take many months or years, or do we?

   Remember, small successes first, then go for the big ones as you
   gain experience...

   What do YOU think? How about a "List Game" then after we see
   how well that works out, we can go for the "List SuperGame"??

  



                  Take care,

                  Garfield

Will there be 020 specific libraries, or just a standard 68000 one? Will it
also allow us non AGA users to get super hires and such? Will it be much less

   Well, okay, maybe I was being a bit too cautious but, even with
   a simple game, the execution can do wonders. Check out Deluxe
   Pacman for example...

   The real challenge is getting the actual development in motion.
   So, it's not that we would just be building another Pacman, 
   MORE IMPORTANTLY we would be establishing the "development-
   system" which will enable us to tackle much larger and more
   complex projects in the future...

   Having said that, I do AGREE WITH YOU, it would be better to come
   up with a game that doesn't have quite so many clones as
   Pacman and Arkanoid!!!!


   Well, Laurie, this was YOUR idea so, did you have a game in mind?





                     Take care,

                     Garfield

I agree.  And I haven't seen a PC clone.  I've been doing both for several
years, and it's REAL important to choose a 32-bit compiler for flat memory
(DJGPP is free and well supported), and a good sprite lib (Allegro or WGT or
Fastgraph), and a good music lib that autoconfigs to the user's sound card
(MikMod or Sound System 3 or Sound Dev Kit).  The best newsgroup is
rec.games.programmer.

I'm having a problem with Bobs, and if anyone is not too wrapped up 
in AGA extension or list games then I'd appreciate any help please.

I've often had a problem with using 
Bob Off N
and then shortly after redefining the Bob
Bob N,X,Y,I

If some unknown amount of time has not passed between the two 
commands, then the Bob doesn't get displayed when I call

Bob Clear
Bob Draw
Screen Swap
Wait Vbl

(or similar)
Now this causes bobs to flash on and off at times which looks pretty 
awful.
I've tried several solutions.
Instead of Bob Off N, I used Bob N,-100,-100,I. I can't use this 
because of my scrolling system which will get corrupted. (Not my 
programs fault! It's to do with AMOS not replacing the background to 
Bobs correctly when they are moved)
I've also tried Bob Off N and then immediately redefining the Bob off 
screen in the hope that when I redefine it again on screen, it'll 
draw OK. But it doesn't.
I've tried other things as well which I can't recall.

Basically the whole problem came about because I put a split screen 
two player mode in my game and AMOS doesn't allow the same bobs on 
different screens so I had to do all sorts of changes ..... but thats 
another LONG story.

Thanks,
-Murray

There is indeed such a thing, although I have never heard of anyone using it.
Steve Bye at F1 Licenceware used to sell it. His homepage is:
http://www.f1lw.demon.co.uk/.

Also, a new AGA extension will appear soon, so keep reading this list.

Ive tried the Falcon extension. Its quite good actually. Has a few
interesting commands up its sleeve. The best command I think, is its Multi
Plot command, which will draw a full 320x200 screen of individual pixels in
less than a second. Very handy for a C2P routine

Cool. Wouldn't be the one you are currently manufacturing with AMOS would
it??? When you gonna send me a testers version of it? Does it have a REXX
port or something I can communicate with it externally?

Sure. Probbly wont get anywhere near a demo for at least a month. Im just
trying to get blitz to hook up to a URL and receive data from a CGI script
at the moment, once I have done that, then I am getting a new homepage for
the program only, with full CGI options, then I shall release a beta demo
to a few testers to have some fun with.

All the chat etc. will come in shortly after. The first will just be a set
notify list to try out that bit of the program.

Ill upload some info and screenshots to my homepage as i go along with it

All the best

hehe.

What *I* mean, is if you re-install the version of Falcon which the
software works with, *then* save the programs as ASCII you should be able
to merge the ASCII into the newer extension.

Mr Falcon extension writer dude, think its about time you started
distributing example programs in ASCII format.
hehe

Quick question:
   I've been using Pietro Ghizzoni's wonderful GUI Extension with the
GadToolsBox, and am having a slight problem. Any window I define in
GadToolsBox ends up being only about 80% of the width I specify when it comes
to using it from the GUIExt (v1.61). What have I overlooked?
Thanks in advance
Rod

P.S. With the advent of GUIExt, and the talk of AGA/Graphics board support; if
we could just have neat integrated support of MUI, AMOS would be the best
environment to write the best software. Can someone talk P.Hickman into
updating his AMOS & Mui code?

No no no.
What I mean is the provided example programs seem to have been 
written in an earlier version and are AMOS format so you can't save 
it as ASCII. Well you can, but it doesn't help. You just get exactly 
the same thing back.

Greetings.

Well, I thought I would add some more of my thoughts on this idea of 
a group-list game/project (hard choice of words, eh?)

Let me start with Garfield (Benjamin). He had several good points:
> In the meantime, why don't we commence with the actual game 
> concept!! It seems like the best way to do this would be to have the 
> nominations and voting right here in the list so, here goes...

That would be a good idea. I think we've all thrown our 2c worth in, 
so let's stop arguing about whether it's going to happen, get 
together, and organize it if you're (we all are :) GOING to DO IT.

> a simple game such as PacMan, Arkanoid, etc.

That would be a good idea, but read on..

I must agree with this totally.

However, Murray replied:
>> This is not a specific game-style but, I strongly suggest we
>> choose a simple game such as PacMan, Arkanoid, etc.

> Simple but not that simple! I can't see many people taking a huge

YEs, begin simple. If someone on this list wants to take on a large 
project like Murray suggested, LET THEM do it by themselves! Trust me 
on this one. Btw, I think we can apply the "promotion motion" analogy 
to this one. You don't start out afresh at a company (if your young 
and inexperienced, at a first job) working in a high management
position. You work your way UP the corporate ladder from the BOTTOM. 
You can apply this to beginning a team project like mentioned.

Simple but not that simple!
I can't see many people taking a huge interest in coding ANOTHER

We'd probably run out of modules to hand out, they're so simple.

Hi!!

PowerBobs is an extension by Manuel Andre, the same author of Turbo.
It has a new set of commands to display bobs and sprite much faster and to
allow up to 64 amal channels without Synchro Off command under interrupts.

There's a demo version on Aminet in dev/amos.

BTW it's a bit buggy, so use it carefully!!

I don't know if he's still selling it, but you can try.

Unfortunatel I don't have his email because he has not got one, so you have
to write him or call by telephone.

I can't help it! AMOS Extensions have to be designed to take a specific number
of commands, and if you add more they have to be tacked on to the end of the
list.. Anyway, I hate sloppy code like that, so I designed my extension with
plenty of `spare' slots to put commands it. The problem is, I keep running out
of spare slots. Most versions interact with each other nicely, you only get
problems with a new `phase' (after I've created more spaces here and there).
I'm not sure, but I think the Easylife extension uses a similar method.

However I realise it is a problem, but is ASCII really the solution? How would
people to react to loading in ASCII extension files? Also, does anyone want to
be able to read tooltypes? I'm thinking of doing it but if noone's interested
I won't bother.

Does things with the EHB screenmode, darkened windows, etc. Also does really
fast plot commands, stores palettes in banks, and can read in `.info' files
(from Workbench) and display them on screen.

I've got that extension.  It allows you to display a lo-res 256 colour screen (from within AMOS), but you can't do a lot else.  There are a few other AGA functions too, but the screen handling is pretty poor and VERY slow.

>Also, a new AGA extension will appear soon, so keep reading this list.

This new extension sounds cool.  Definitely wait for that.

Rob.
