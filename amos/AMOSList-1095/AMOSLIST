 Has anyone had this problem. When I use the AMCAF Pt Play with the
Pt Sam Play I get a high frequency (sp) noise after the Sample stops
playing. And yes I used Pt Sam Bank before I used any of the Pt Sam Play
calls. If I use Pt Stop followed with Pt Sam Play the system acts as if
I had used the buggy MED commands. Samples loop ect. Is thier a fix for
this? I hope thier is I was gonig to reg AMCAF this week but if I cant
fix this problem I will have to buy the Music Extension instead. I need
music and sound effects at the same time in my prgs.

 Also Could the kind soul who posted the fix for the POP that the sample
editor adds at the begining of each sample please repost it.

 When I get these things fixed I will be just days way from a working
beta version of CommBatt. The modem only Dune II clone.

        I just got Dpaint 4 AGA (am I happy) and I don't understand this,
    an AA pic that is 640x400+ham shows no flicker (or at least I coudn't 
notice it) but a non-AA pic same resolution (640x400 without ham) does 
have the flicker.  First I thought well maybe there is no flicker in 
AA!!!!, but when I tried drawing in AA-1280x400 then the flicker did appear.
   so this are the facts:
   -a pic that is 1280x400 will flicker with or without AA
   -a pic that is 640x400 flickers, but if it is AA then will not flicker!!!
    why???? can anyone explain this to me? should screen flicker on AA if 
it is 640x400 and if yes why this pic shows no flicker? maybe it flickers 
but the ham pretty colors cover the flicker somehow?
   reason I'm asking this is because I don't wanna keep drawing in 
lowres, specially if using AA i can get no flicker on 640x400.
  Where does AMOS comes in? well I suspended working on my rpg and I 
think I'll try to make it an AMOS AGA game pls someone explain in extenso 
about flicker :) thank you

I've seen this demo... and... erm... yes, it's an 'Ego-Demo' ;-)) Nice
colourcycling and animation effects ;-))

Drawbacks: Most parts of the demo last too long and cannot be skipped ;-)

Well, EasyLife is a quite good extension, Turbo is good too, but crashes
your programs on exit. Although Amcaf is Shareware, I'd like to mention it
here anyway ;)

Hello everybody!

I'm currently preparing the next version of AMCAF, so I wanted to ask for
any suggestions for new commands or functions... Some people did have
hints for AMCAF, but I cannot remember all of them, so would you people
please speak up? Thx.

Best regards

this can be precalced but it takes quite a lot memory...

for ex. p(12000)=12000/10000, p(13000)=13000/10000 ... 
then you just  s=1+p(pz(a)+20000).... 

or better: p(a)=1+(pz(a)+20000)/10000  
then s=p(a) ....

Hi everybody !
My AMOS Pro have some problems locating my Intepreter_Config.AMOS file.
When I choose the menu-command "Set Intepreter" it looks after the file=20
"AMOSPro_System:Intepreter_Config.AMOS", and it says "File not found".
That's obvious because I don't have any device called "AMOSPro_System:",
that's my disk from where I installed AMOS Pro on my HD.
My Intepreter_Config.AMOS is in the S directory on my HD, isn't that where=20
it should be ??
If I insert my "AMOSPro_System:" disk in df0: everything works fine, but=20
that's not what I want to do.

On the subject of AGA flickering or not has one of several reasons:

1.  AGA does indeed have flicker-free modes (Double NTSC or PAL for example)
    but you need a Multi-Snc monitor to use these modes.

2.  A second reason is the number of colours on screen reduce flicker 
    for instance TV has a high number of colours and you will see virtually
    no flicker and its in interlace too, and AGA pictures have a high number
    of colours especially HAM-8.

the fewer number of colours for example 2 colours in an interlaced mode will
flicker very badly wehre as if you have 256 colours on screen with low contrast
between pixels there will be very little to no flicker even on a 16 colour 
screen! 

I hope this helps

 I just took a look at the 3D Engine put up on Aminet by someone here. I
was impressed with what you did in amos with just a small ML driver.
Here is my few words about it.

 With a non accelerated 1200 the mode you called running was the
standard speed that games like Gloom and Fears ran at. If you want to
get the most sales out of a game you write with it use the run mode as
standard mode and the other mode as an option to slow it down on other
systems.

 The raycasting (I think thats what you use) looks as good as Alien
Breed 3D demo but falls short of Gloom's detail. But still Great for
amos.

 You have a few bugs with wall intersections, some times you can see the
gapes for a second. Need to fix that if you want to compeate with the
other 3D games.

 All in all it was very impressive to me, better than most 3D engines I
have looked at on Aminet, and Amos too! Even with the few things I
mentioned if you compleate a game with it I would get it. I love 3D and
this is real 3D as far as I'm concerned. One suggestion please make a
Dungon type game with spells ect the future stuff has been done to
death.

      I don't really know much about f-Basic just this, I usually look in 
the AGA demos dir in aminet to see new demos and be amazed, few weeks ago
I got this demo of a future game that is made in F-basic (v5 I think) it 
was called dwaga or dungeon AGA, you can see it on the aminet search 
tool. The demo is really nice, I couldnt believe you could do something 
like that in basic, I loved the demo but I dont think somethink like that 
can be done in AmosPro (pls someone tell me if possible), check that demo 
if you have an AGA machine.

   Well, no one checked my demo in dev/amos/demo3.lha, it's okay becuase 
Im just an amos begginer but I only wanted an opinion as to how to 
improve the games so that one day I can put in aminet a compiled version, 
the game Ninja2 (in demo3.lha) was my attempt to do a karate game, I 
would really like to improve it until it looks like streetfighter2 
someday :) Pls someone tell me If you see it and how is better to improve 
the game.  The other game, War in Makeria is just a strategy in the style 
of lords of conquest (which used to be one of my favs) and I was trying 
to see if it was possible for me to do something like that, now that it 
works im planning in adding features like tournament, etc.  Pls someone 
have a look at them so I get feedback in how to make good games.

No, it should be where AMOSPro is.

"Intepreter_Config" should be in S: though.

Well, i'm come back on amos-list since yesterday and i have a question.
A friend of mine told me that Vahalla has been creared with AMOS.
Is it true? 

I saw the game and i was very shocked by smooth animations and now i
'm very interested to know if Vahalla was an AMOS project. If so, well, 
i have to send my personal congratulations to programmers!

Hello,
a problem to solve for all you!!

If you enter in Amos or AmosPro a line like:
   Print Val("5+10")

Amos will print just 5.
Is there a way to allow Amos to reply 15, making the operations in the
string??
Could you write a procedure to do it??

Now, I'm using AMAL progs!! :(  Amal?? Of course!
I wrote a proc like this:
   Procedure VARIABLE[R$]
      R$="Let RA="+R$
      Amal 0,R$
      Amal On
      Wait Vbl
      R=Amreg(0)
   End Proc[R]

I understand it's NOT fast and nice, even if it works.
Please, do something better.

Bye and thanX

Michele.

I agree. Thanks a lot to you for replying. I didn't really believe anyone 
would do. I'm amazed that quite many people still uses the Amiga, even
though they have been out of the market for so long. I'm writing this
using an expensive Silicon Graphics workstation at school, but still
I won't get rid of my old A500!

Sure. Years ago, when AmigaBASIC was still the standard of Amiga programming
(1988), a couple of other BASICs were also available for the machine. One
of them was F-Basic -- it was about five times faster than regular Amiga-
BASIC. It never caught on, because it lacked several important features
(like random access files -- perhaps not important, but it's the one I
remember best ;) ). It also required a hefty machine for those days. If you
want to read more, see if you can locate the 3rd Sonderheft of `Amiga'
(the German magazine published by Markt&Technik). It features 'ausfuerliche
Tests und Grundlagen' about this variant of BASIC.

Maarten

I agree. Thanks a lot to you for replying. I didn't really believe anyone 
would do. I'm amazed that quite many people still uses the Amiga, even
though they have been out of the market for so long. I'm writing this
using an expensive Silicon Graphics workstation at school, but still
I won't get rid of my old A500!

I am disheartened that my AMOS programs run so slow.  Does anyone
have any advice at all, no matter how trivial, on how I can speed
up my code?

Don't know yet.  At the moment it takes up about 1.2 meg but I 
haven't added any samples yet.  So in theory I could get it to work 
on any 1.5 meg amiga. However, I'm not too sure if it will be fast 
enough on a 68k - although my mate with an 1500 assures me it is....
I think I will first try to get it working on an A1200 - making it 
A1200 only......and then, if there is the demand, I will split it 
into 2 parts so that it works on a 1 meg machine.

Splitting into 2 parts is often very messy and introduces lots of 
hard to find bugs :-(

I'd venture to say that with all those colours squeezed into that high 
resolution the flicker is covered up.  If you always make sure to double 
up lines and anti-alias a lot in the art, you can hide much of the 
flicker easily.  BTW - how's the fringing in HAM at that res?

Well,

after few days from my first mail, a friend of mine said that he got 
Valhalla. So, i have been invited to play it.
Valhalla takes place on 6 disks DD.All files are signed with a capital 
letter followed by a number. Some of these files are protected but others
can be viewed with Dopus. I used it to view these files and i saw that..
they are Amos Banks!
Well, there are some packed pictures and music banks....

Nice that some people write games that uses Amos, and sell them!
Anyone here seen the game Lost In Minds? It's also made in Amos! 

Anyone more out there ho has seen more games made in Amos?

Ok. I'll try to fix this so that the walk/run modes would
run equally fast/slow on all machines...
This is a bit tricky because I have to use interrupts.

Also the overall speed will increase a lot, becoz I've and will 
optimize the routines. 

My current version is already about 50% faster than the aminet version,
becoz of a new floor algorithm.

I'm planning to move to a more complex raycasting system, which could
handle different wall heights and "curved" walls. But first I have to
blast sum bugs.

This is a tricky one. I still haven't figured out how could I fix this.

To answer the question about the Interrepter_config.amos is as follows:

Its not looking for the config but the actual amos program that does the
configuring, which will be in your amospro_system directory.  Amos Pro
expects to find this assigned or none of the system programs will load
e.g. the monitor, the config program, the help stuff, the sprite and sound
editors, all you have to do to fix this: is to assign it to the proper 
directory in your system-configuration like so:

assign amospro_sytem: dh0:amospro or wherevver you have amospro on your
hard drive.

I hope this clears up your problems.

This is a problem of the Music Extension... remove it, and it will work.
The Music Extension installs a Sample Interrupt, which causes this sample
loops.

Sure, and at my place it perfectly works (see Tubes and MegaTron for
example) ;-)

JW>  Also Could the kind soul who posted the fix for the POP that the sample

The program I posted will not fix the 'knack' (click) at the beginning of
a sample but the high frequency beep of a sample when replaying with Pt
Sam Play.

To remove the click, just save your samples without the IFF-header
(actually, the AMOS Pro Sample_Bank_Maker will automatically skip this
header)...

I suppose, you are using a Multisync monitor... normally, the
lowres-displays and interlace displays are scan-doubled so there's no
flicker anymore. However, this scan doubling cannot be applied on all
resolutions.

Not all users have Multisync monitors... so the displays cannot be

	-Remove unecessary floating point mathematics
	-do precalculations and hold the answers in arrays or banks
	-avoid sin() cos() or other similar functions
	-use inc or dec instead of i=i+1, and use add to replace code that
	 keeps a variable within a range.
	-invoke comp test off at the beginning of the program.
	-use only as many bitplanes as you really need in your graphics

I'm sure there are many others but without being specific that's all I can
think of right now.

Hi Tesi,
 Well actually yes it was.  The first version defently was.  I'm not 
sure about the other incarnations.

One of the UK based magazines run a letter from a reader who 
mentioned that the famous, or is that infamous, AMOS requester popped 
up while playing.

OK, here's a really tiny little program which should access the modem 
and allow you to send AT commands to and from it.  It's just 
incredibly simplistic with no features at all, but you do things like 
ATDT<number> to dial out using the <number> and so on.

Anyway, I'm sure (as always) I've completely missed the point with 
the question, so if so - very soon!

(Amos Pro only - sorry again!)

Oh, and it's called LITTLECO.AMO because the PC can't deal with 
LITTLECOM.AMOS.  :-(

I am not much into games making, so I have never really felt the need for 
optimisation.
Some things I have learned though. For instance, if you want to load in 
data, always load it in as banks. If you'd have to load in large files 
using the Open In and various Input# commands, it can take ages.
Recently we have been talking about drawing circles faster than the Amos 
Circle command does. In some cases this is actually possible. So it helps 
to try and build an own function, even if an Amos command that does 
the same exists.

     Thanks for comments Garret, now I learned that hires w ham can cover 
the flicker.  How's the fringing in ham?  :)  I just got Dpaint AGA and 
still didn't get through the tutorial, anyways for those who might not 
know fringing is when you are working on a ham picture there might be 
streaks of color running to the right of the brush and it can be 
annoying, but after you paint it wil not affect the pic.  Actually with 
regular brush I couldnt see the fringing, when I loaded another brush 
then it was really messy!!!! I thought it was funny though,

     Thanks to all that answered about AGA :)

It's your error, not Amos problem because "5+10" is not "15"
Also "5"+"10" is not "15" but "510".
It's only string  and if Val function find another character than 0-9
give you only numeric value of string before this character.
In your example it's exactly - 5.

Try : Print Val("10Michele") -> effect - 10


Your second questions: Sorry I'm not good in Amal.

What should I do with a sample bank???
I have to save it with the program or like normal banks, but in this second
case, everybody can use my own samples!!
And bsave can't be used, since when you do bload the bank will not be seen
as a sample bank.

Bye.

I once wrote a small program to create a memory bank that
stored the Sin() and Cos() function results from 1-90 in a
2 byte space.  I took the original values and multiplied
them by 32700, getting the integer result and putting
it into a bank.  I found that I increased my tirg function
speed by 13% using this method.

I still have the program if anyone is interested.  Its
real small, and the created bank is about 980 bytes,
if my memory serves me correctly.

Hi gang,

	I got AMOS Basic in a Amiga Format.  It is a self installing
disk.  I'm using DF1: and DH0:.  I have no DF0:.  The silly disk
wants to be in DF0: and will not install out of DF1:.  Any suggestions?

Thanks.

I've always heard one of the best methods for a 'simple' copyright is to 
stick a copy of the disk/tape/whatever in an envelope and mail it to 
yourself.  When you get it, don't open it, just put it away for 
safekeeping.  If need be, this government-dated package can be opened 
later in a court of law proving the date and origin of the package. :) 
Of course the best way in the US is to just send for a standard copyright 
which I believe costs $20 now.

   Hmmm... Having played quite a few Doom/Heretic incarnations on my 
friend's PC, I'd have to say I tend to like the 'gun' games better but 
maybe I just haven't seen any mind boggling 'spell' games yet.

   I have a BIG suggestion for you.  Personally, once I finished Doom I 
got rather bored with it.  Deathmatches renewed my interest for a little 
while, but then they got old too.  Then I discovered new .wad archives, 
and level & graphic editors!  Now I LOVE the game again because I can 
completely create my own scenarios!
   If you are storing the graphics and blueprints in banks or some 
external format, I would love to see the ability to replace these with 
custom modules.  Then you could include graphics for both a sci-fi AND a 
fantasy game (or anything else you could imagine).  If you store your 
weapons in some kind of external table (that keeps track of bullet speed, 
reload speed, bullet power, etc.), you could modify this to create 
new/unique weapons for whatever graphic style you'd like.  You might even 
be able to store the enemies in this manner.  You could even allow 
different graphics for each level! (it could lower memory requirements to 
not have to load even the unused graphics for every level)

   You know... You could even turn this into a 3-D construction kit!

   Of course this kinda wont effect me until I get my AGA machine next 
year.  Ever consider an ECS version? ;)

    Quite a few people I know have had trouble getting hold of the extension.
I think Ben Wyatt on this list managed to find it though.

    I think if we help you, you should invite all of us over to Le Mans to
watch the 24 hour race when it happens :-)))))

	You have to make sure your witness is someone like the Bank Manager.  It
must be someone you don't know as a friend.  You can never prove that they are
not lieing I suppose.  This is why courts have oaths, lawyers and juries :-)

	If you believe that sort of thing (Justice prevails!) then you are
misguided!  Unless of course you have all of OJ's lawyers.  Then you're sorted
:-)))))))))

There was a demo of a commercial game written in Amos on last month's 
coverdisk. At least, looking through it with a hex monitor revealed it to 
be an Amos game, there were no other clues. I can't remember the name, 
but it was made by Vulcan software and the git^H^H^Hreviewer called it a 
cross between Lemmings and Valhalla. Actually, it was more like a cross 
between Lemmings and Mr. Chip Nibble.

A while ago, Greg Cox asked for a slotmachine, preferably written in 
Amos. I answered that I'd heard of such a thing and would try to get my 
hands on it. Well, it appears this game already is on Aminet. If anyone 
is still interested, the game is called Gox!, was written in AmosPro and 
can be dl'ed as Aminet:game/misc/gox2.lha. Have fun!

Does anyone know how to get Amos: The Creator to work with workbench
on AGA? I got the thing installed on my Harddrive okay, but when I multitask
with Amiga-A and do something on workbench (like opening PPaint) and return
to Amos the screen is garbled :-(

I managed to get the pointer back by removing the Hires Pointer and putting
a lowres one on workbench, but I cant seem to get Amos to work.

Any ideas??

Erm. I think the PPCs from motorola (PC601, 602, 603, 604)
are full 64bit. So I take it their bus is also 64 bit.
Maybe i'm wrong on this. Not very AMOS either.

It might be the version of Amos you have. Only v.1.36 (the latest/last) 
will work correctly on AGA machines. If you don't have this version, 
then download the update from Aminet.

If memory serves me, and it often fails as I get older, there was also an
AMOS slot machine game that appeared on an Amiga Computing Disk, it
was called Amos Coin Drop and was a reasonable attempt, back in the old
days of the creator.

If anyone is after it, I can probably dig it out, it's some where in my
piles of disks.

I think this bug was fixed in later versions of the creator (1.34+) and is
OK in AMOSPro. However there is still the strings problem that others have
mentioned and may be the cause of the problem.

Title says it all really - I have been working on a new improved faster
and hopefully more reliable AmosGuide rewritting much of it from scratch
including the file reading and link handling routines which seem to be
causing the most trouble.

I would particularly like to hear from those people who have had problems
with previous versions.

For those who don't know what AmosGuide is, download Easylife from aminet,
and look in the accessories dir.

It's a good idea, but it seems to me that you really DO WANT it, don't

you??

I have to say it's a very big and well done extension, but I don't think I
should register since I don't use it. Up to now, I could do whatever I
wanted without AMCAF, and I registered just to the extension I used at
least
once... You can't know, but I could be in the list of registered users in
the future!! ;-)

BTW, think about the ideas I gave you for the next version: it could
be a way to force me to register! :-)

Bye.

How about if you have a bank containing the colour of each point on a
screen, could you make a command to convert this to a normal screen?

Or is this what you meant? ;-)

I haven't been able to get hold of it yet...

I know one or two people who have sent off for it, but haven't heard
anything yet... I hope there haven't been any problems with the company=

they've stopped advertising in amiga format.

Would it be enough to add an example program, how to do this via the
copper commands? I've allready got some of these, which are able to show
lores/hires/laced 8 bit pictures (i.e 256 colours or HAM8).

I've got one, but it's not the fastest ;-) and then, I've got some other
ones, which are not from me but seem to be optimized to the last bit ;-)

Question to all AMCAF users out there: Are there still users which only
have an MC68000 in their machine? I'd like to make AMCAF 68020+ if
possible ;-)

Hey! I would have had a look at if, if I only could find it in our AmiNet
mirror... but I haven't yet... I suppose it got lost on the way or it's in
a different directory... :-\

Don't always think nobody looks at one of your programs because you call
yourself a 'beginner'. This isn't true at all ;-)

I've still kept your original mail as 'unread' so I don't forget to answer
it, as soon as I look at your probably marvellous games ;-)

The Print-command is able to print "17" ;-))) <only joking> ;-)

Well, it would be some work to do really... an evaluation function uh oh

suppose ;-)

Impossible! <sorry, but this is really impossible>

Reason: AMOS tokenizes the commands you enter in the editor, and after the
program is compiled, there's NO way to tokenize a command anymore...

Don't use floating points, use integers instead. Try to only use
multiplication or division factors which are a power of 2
(2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256...)...

Use as few colours in your screens as you require, when using many bobs or
similar...

Buy a faster machine or compile your programs ;-)))

I think this is even harder to prove.  It is posible to steal a postmark
stamp from a postoffice, or have a postmark backdated if you know someone.

Subject: doom source code (maybe)
Status: O
X-Status: 

Good news:I have some source code that I wrote for a doom like engine.

Bad news: It's for a PC and is written in C.


It draws simple dungeons and walls and lets you wander around. No monsters
yet, probably never (as the wolfenstein-doom thing has been done to death
on the PC and I don't think theres a fourtune to be made with it).

Now, I'm willing to part with the engine code. Perhaps you might want to
convert it to the amiga, but I don't have the time anymore, and want to
move on to other games.

Any offers on the code? Anything considered.

I'd like to pubblish a program made by me. It's really good, fast and
powerful. It's a version of the Logo version.

Does anyone of you know someone who could like to do it??
If it were italian, it would be better, since it's written enirely in
Italian... and I should translate it.

Bye.

   I recently downloaded an extension for Amos that provided commands to
help write doors for Max's BBS. I was wondering if there was any comparable
extension/collection of procedures that could provide the same sort of
access to Ami Express.
   Anyway, if there isn't, could someone point me in the right direction
concerning Ami Express doors?

   Thanks in advance,

A mate of mine at school has writen a program to evaluate a string

probably squeeze it out of him... ;-)

I thought you wrote it in amos... ;-))

It would have to be exceptional if you want to release it commercially,
because I've seen at least one version of logo floating around on the
amiga, and the AMOS Craft extension has logo commands as well.

Could you tell me where I can get the Logo version for Amiga??

And my Logo language use CRAFT's turtle commands, but I added over 60
different commands, For/Next loops, If...Then/EndIf statements, sounds,
labels and Jump command, PROCEDURES (as well as Amos) and variables. And

all
it is very fast (as much as a compiled command can be), easy (more than
AMOS) and powerful!!

Any idea how to contact a software-house??

ThanX.

Do it, please!!!!  :-)
And, since I don't know C at all, could you translate it in an Amos
procedure??
It should be like this:

Procedure _VALUE[R$]
    ....
End Proc[R]

where R$ is the string and R the result!

Thank you very much, I relly need it soon.
Bye.

 Chris thanks for your help with my problems I was having with AMCAF. I
got the last AMOSList off Aminet and the fix for the samples worked like
a charm. I also found out that if I make a sample bank and NEVER touch
it again the POP at the start of the samples never appears. Its the GRAB
funtion of the sample editor that messes up the samples. But your hint
to use samples with no IFF header worked also, I have ProSound 2.0 and
the dump feature worked for that.
 Your check for the Registered version of AMCAF is now in the mail. That
was the only problem I had with the extension and had not registered it
before now. If I would stop reading my email at 3 o'clock in the morning
so I remembered what I read the next day I would have made far better
use of the list in the last months.
 And YES please add some examples of using the blitter to display AGA
ham using the Extension in the next release. Could you also please
explain the ptile commands. I might want to use them for the game maps
in CommBatt. I have looked at all the map editors on the Aminet that I
can find but have not found one that I can use yet.
 If anyone reading this is new to the list and you have Amos Pro then do
yourself a big favor and get AMCAF and Easylife extensions. They both
have features that make Amos so much more than it is without them.

Message-ID: <951008072710_73654.3452_DHR38-2@CompuServe.COM>
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Hello All,

I have been having considerable trouble getting AMOS to load IFF brushes (as
screens, of course) with much success.  Many brushes seem to load perfectly.
Some do not.  I have examined them using Project D's Editor Tool to see if there
was a common cause -- e.g., extra chunks, masking bits, even word or longword
alignment of the chunks.  There appears to be no pattern.  In fact, I saved out
brushes (8 color mode) from DPaint, from the same screen, same palette, same
size brushes, etc., and found that the actual graphic data seemed to be the
factor.  Also, the offending patterns would load properly at various sizes
larger or smaller, so size and bitplane data seems to be the deadly duo.  It's
like playing "brushian roulette!" =)

Does anyone have any technical knowledge to explain this?  Does anyone have an
IFF brush loading procedure that works?

Thanks.

Status: RO
X-Status: 

Hi to all on the Amos mailing list
	 I have just got my subscription to the mailing list working
Since changing Internet provider.
So I would like to let you all know about my first Amos game, It's 
Based on an old VIC20 game called Radar Rat Race.
	In my game RadarRatRun (RRR for short) using a joystick
you guide the blue mouse (Mortimer) around a maze (one of four) 
trying to eat all the cheese before the rats catch Mortimer, If Mortimer
doesn't eat all the cheese in the time limit then he gets very tired 
and the rats can easier catch him, One thing in his favour is the rats
are very short sighted and find him more by smell than sight, So after
eating all this cheese Mortimer gets very flatulent (F##ts a lot) witch
is very handy when the rats get to close.
	Any one wishing to try this game it can be found on Aminet
games/misc/RadarRatRrun.lha the archive contains the compiled and
Amos source code. 
	As this is my first attempt at programing in Amos Any suggestions,
comments criticisms will be gratefully received.
	Very many thanks to Stuart Matthews for the music Three Blind Mice.
Check out his game Ultimatum a 3D tank game on Aminet its great.
Thanks to all on the mailing list I have learnt so much reading the messages.
bye Steve.

Yes it is.
My Logo has 14 system variables and up to 100 user variable. Setting them

is
really easy:
 #1=100       will put the value 100 into variable number 1
 #2=50*2+10   will put the value 110 into variable number 2
 #3=#1+#2     will put the value 210  (100+110) into variable numer 3

Isn't it easy enough??

Bye and thanX

    Errrr, yep.  I should have said!  It`s an AMOS diskmag.  It comes 
on two disks and has all kinds of tutorials, news, programs, example 
source etc.  It`s been reviewed in the Amiga Computing November Issue 
if you can get hold of it, you can have a look.

    thanks for the reply!

    Errrmmm.  I afraid I can`t help you really.  I load IFF brushes 
in all the time and don`t ever have any problems.  I use DPaint III 
and AMOSPro v2.00.  Could you tell me what versions you use so I can 
try and work out what`s wrong?

I finally got around to trying My3dEngine today (I downloaded it a few days
ago), and aside from a few problems (like the floors not aligning with the
walls quite right when you move) I thought it was quite good.

I think that heartbeat adds a lot of atmosphere; imho it shouldn't slow down
quite as much as it does though, and it should be sped up a bit when enemies
are near you.  What I liked the most were the enemies though, the first time I
was in the room with the invisible guy I didn't see him, once I cought a
glimpse but thought it was just a raycasting artifact or something, then I
finally noticed him.  I think that's a much better Invisible effect than what
Doom uses.  I also liked the Transparent floating head, the smoothness to the
turning, and the faint footsteps.

The engine uses an AGA Copperscreen, correct?  How much of it is in ASM?  Are
the Raycasting, Texture Mapping, and Copperscreen Setup all done in machine
code, or is some of that done in Amos?

Well, i think your version is still faster than plotting :-)
combination of your scale routine and C2P would create nice
fast 2*2 (or what ever) "chunky" screen......uuh, or would it ;-)

Errr, i am not THE coder, but i know him. And what i know almost all
are just amos, raycasting, copperscreen......in texturemapping
there is just 1 thing ASM, and it is texture line scaling....

(Pete, hope i didn't speak "paljonkaan potaskaa" :-)))

If possible, Chris, don't make your extension full '20+
It will indeed be the problem (as pointed out) with other
'end-users' that is the most pressing decision.
I don't mind if you put '20+ code in it which will not be usable
but not crashing the machine if not used.
(Get what I mean ?)
IMHO: keep it 68000 for what it is now. But if you think it is
not neccecary to go to mapping and all that without '20+...
then just make those routines '20+ but make sure AMCAF is still
working on 68k!
Maybe you ought to get together with the MYengine guy and put
that code into commands for AMCAF ?

Great!!!

Qsin/Qcos does this directly within the command, so it's a little bit
slower than arrays, sure ;-)

You don't really need interrupts if you have the "Timer" variable free.
You could simply measure, how long it took to draw the screen and call up
your movement routine as often as required to catch up the lost time...

The file contained on the Amiga Format disk is a DMS file. To unpack it,
just copy the file to your harddisk and type:

DMS WRITE <nameofthedmsfile.DMS> TO DF1:

If you've done that before, and it's the installer program that mocks up,
try

Assign DF0: DF1: Defer

I hope this helps a bit :-)

I would like to know if it's possible to use color fonts with Amos without
using Cfont extension. If someone has a document about the format of
color fonts, could he send it to me?

PS: is there another extension permitting you to load Cfonts?

    Well, I'm afraid us poor people who work for Universities for a pittance
cannot afford spangly computers.  I still have my trusty old A500 v1.3 which
serves me well.  Don't get me wrong however, you must look to the future.  I
think that probably the majority of peeps have a 1200 or above.  Just don't
forget us poor users  who can't afford their weekly food bill, let alone a new
computer :-((

    Ho Hum.  Don't spose anyone wants to donate a nice new spangly A4000
060.......  No?   Thought not! ;-)

I was wondering if anyone else has gotten over 100 messages with siva! in
the hostname?  They are all repeats of previous messages from the end of
September.

If not, that's good.  If you have a shiva in your email address, let me
know, too.  I think I got rid of the offending site (undeliverable mail to

I had the same error with the previous version. I would like to be
beta testing too.

You have made my day.  I thought I was the only person left with an
Amiga A500 v1.3.  I have a full time job and still can't afford to
upgrade.  However, you may call me a black leg when you learn that
my wife bought me a 512k memory upgrade last Christmas so I now have
1Mb.

I was feeling rather lonely listening in on all the talk involving
high spec machines.

If you find someone who has one to spare, maybe they could send one
my way as well.

I am a lucky 020 owner.
But I disagree with the idea of having only 020 code.
The speed gained is really so little that can be confused with the 
stability of the clock. And the memory gain too.

So I think we have better to maintain 68000 compatibility.

Maybe you can release 2 version of the extension, one compiled for 68000  
and the other one for 020+.

Wouls be better having it exploiting the new features of AA chips!

Don't feel too lonely.  My Amiga 500 is over 10 years old, and only has
1 Meg, as well.  And, considering the exchange rates between the
US and Europe, I don't think I'll be getting an A1200 or (heh heh)
an A4000T/060/66 very soon.  8^)

(I accidentally re-subscribed to a list I currently get...)

If anyone has any wisdom concerning this problem, I'm all ears.

I'm using AMOS Pro 2.0 and the brushes are created in DPaint 4.0 (the original
release 4).

I once tried to load an iff picture smaller than the opened screen, 
and it got garbled up completely. I didn't understand this, because 
when I loaded the picture in dpaint it worked perfectly. 
Later I tried opening a screen the same size as the pictures and that 
worked. Maybe this also works with brushes...
thus if you have a brush that is 30x30 big you should open a screen 
30x30 big, but there is a limit, you can't open a screen smaller than 
20(I think)pixels, so the brushes need to be bigger than that size.

Greets,
    Dennis

A command, say, GDim, that combines Global and Dim

Make your new font commands compatible with Interface Programs...please.

I'll think of some more later....

Precisely, and even if you stick it into a bank safe, there is no record 
kept of when you take a look at whats inside.....I think :-(

Hi all.
I'm going to archive all routines,pieces of code, hacks, tips appeared on
the amos-list on a disk. At the moment, i've saved all these starting
from April/May to September.
I think i'll upload it when my disk will be full! (On Aminet of course)

 Send me suggestions, opinions and whatever you want about this

Please excuse my ignorance, I have only been party to this AMOS mail
list for one week.  My curiosity has finally got the better of me
though: "What is AMCAF?".  It sounds to me like some sort of
extension to AMOS, but what is an extension and how do you add it to
your application?

On Tue, 10 Oct 1995, Mark Carter suggested, "A command, say, GDim,
that combines Global and Dim."

This command seems really useful, because let's face it 'Global' and
'Dim' are rarely separated.  These sort of "wishes" sound like a
wish list of improvements for AMOS full stop (period for US
readers).  If so, I think I can get into the spirit of things:

Is it possible for a procedure to return more than one value as
implemented with the PARAM feature?  Maybe using an array?  If this
isn't currently available then this would be one of my wishes.

Hmm.  I'm not convinced that my proposal for quoting previous
messages is any improvement.

Regards,

Kevin.

A better solution is to use programs such as PdPro (On aminet) which allow any 
program
to read (And write if you register) xpk packed files. Distributing powerpacked 
guides is
not really worthwhile - the lha archives are crunched anyway, and there is no 
reason
to force people to use powerpacker.

on it and support it if I get enuff users who actually show interest or even
use it for that matter. So far my beta version of 2.0 does suppport 
PowerPacker, File Imploder (FImp) and if I get enuff response also ARexx.

Yes, it's an extension.  An extension contains more commands which 
you can use with AMOS.  Each extension slots is written in Assembler 
(I presume) and slots into a specific extension number.  You then get 
loads of extra (usually better) commands to play with!

Yeah, I think that'd be quite a good idea too.  Another improvement 
I'd have is for you to be able to change the mouse pointer to a 
sprite which uses more than 4 colours.  Or is this possible already?

You can always set up your own GLOBAL variables (say PRAM1, PRAM2 etc 
- or an array if you like ;-) ) to do it.  Mind you, I suppose it is 
a little more clumsy that way.

Sorry, I must agree with that.  ;-)

Hi all.
I need a way to load IFF on an Amos screen without using Load Iff Amos
command. I would like to know if it's possible to realize and, if so,
if anyone has a document about IFF format and some suggestions about
this.

     Pls help me anyone, when I turn my a4000 on there is a file called
mouseter or something like that , everytime you move the mouse it increases
in mileage and shows you how much you moved the mouse.  That was ok, but
after installing AmosPro on the hd there is this annoying problem: everytime
I load AmosPro, when its on the hd starts loading like crazy and after a 
while I get a message window(on amospro) saying something silly like 
'time to change the mousepad' or 'have you oiled your mouse', after I click
ok on the message it starts loading again from hd nonstop, it never stops.
 It only stops when you load something on Amos, amos works fine I can 
program or do whatever, but whenever im not using drive it will load the 
stupid mouse message.  I don't like using Amos while is alwasy loading 
and bringing up this stupid mouseter message :(
    How do I get rid of this?

What should I do to make an Undo effect?? I mean: I've a screen (hires, if

draw
on it a line, or a circle, or just a dot. How can I have back the image??
The process should be quite... very fast.

Please help me once again. The lst times you did a fantastic work!!
Thank all you very much.

AMCAF is a really big and good AmosPro extension! An extension is like a
list of new commands that can be added to the standard ones: even the

normal
Amos commands are in an extension!! Setting the prefs of Amos, you can
change the extension adding the new ones, and you'll have much more
commands. Some of them are just like the old ones, but faster, other are
totally new.

 > On Tue, 10 Oct 1995, Mark Carter suggested, "A command, say, GDim,

I don't think it will be as useful as you think! What about, instead, the
ability of changing the dimension of an array??

It would be a good program: Chris, can you do it??

There are only two ways I have found to perform an Undo on
a screen using Amos--Block and CBlock.  Block is memory-hungry,
and CBlock is so blasted slow!  To make it easier, though, you
can only clip the area that is actually drawn to.  For
Instance:  If you draw a straight line from 50,50 to 100,100,
you would only clip the area from 50,50 to 100,100.  Obviously,
you run into problems with extreme coordinates (a problem for those
who like to write paint programs) as either the memory needed is 
huge, or compression takes so long you could have lunch, come
back, and still not be done.  I hope this helps.

OK, a better way to do undo, but slower, is when you use the put pixel
or circle or whatever commands, get the olf color value and position of
the pixel before you write over it and save the data in an array. In this
manner, you can have multiple undo layers. But wait, I just thought of a
better way. How about instead of copying the whole screen as
proposed in the last message, open a large second screen, but use it to
hold images cut out of the original, say you drew a circle, to make an
undo buffer, copy the part of the screen affected by the circle command
into the second screen and record the x,y of that box. Now, when you
do an undo, just paste that image back in the correct place.

This is actually for everyone, but I thought you might like to read this, 
too. *8^) Tyson's reference to "Devil" is part of a name of a local Amiga 
bbs, where he sends me his latest WARSTAR files (No, he currently doesn't 
have Internet access).

Some excerpts from a letter to me by Tyson Zwicker, author of WARSTAR:

Hi, it feels like a few millenia have past since I last got onto Devil. I have
to phone real late because of that bane of the telephone existance known as
call waiting (beep beep beep) and I can't stay up till 4AM like I use to
because class is at 8:55 AM. Oh well..

I'm glad to see Warstar has aroused so much interest (me thinks they should all
register). I read all the mail and all the reported bugs have been fixed, and
some cool new stuff added (including your suggestion of asteroids, gravity and
one of my own: radiation fields). As for the crew/medical ideas, there in the
works..give me a month!

My ego really hit the roof when I read that comment about it rivaling Tobias'
Star Trek. The Tobias version is _the_ version, if you know what I mean. Also
greatly enjoyed that comment from the guy who had to put his back on the
drawing board >:)=

I'll be sending a new demo version (bugless as far as I and my play testers up
here can tell) fairly soon. I'm just down-grading it a bit so that it won't be
competition for the registered version (so we can make some money)!

Also, I'll be sending a special version for 1.3 users, as I discovered last
weekend on my friends 1.3 OS A500 that it doesn't work unless its compiled on a
1.3 machine. Soon as I the get use of his machine for a few minutes I'll 
compile the 1.3 version and I'll TRY to send it to you (Basil needs more phone
lines!)

Look for this stuff sometime in the next week and a half..

                                                  Talk to you later
                                                       Tyson
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok, that's the latest word on what has been happening with WARSTAR. 

On a side-note, I am beta-testing some new commercial bbs software for 
the Amiga (to be available sometime in the near future) called OmniLink. 
I'm under an NDA, so I can't give out any details, except to say that all 
other Amiga bbs software (commercial or otherwise) will be like ashes 
once this Ferrari is released. *B^>

It will crunch your source code that is currently in your AMOS Professional's
EDITOR using the powerpacker.library (or with v2.0 if I ever decide to 
continue to finish it will allow you to use File Imploder as well). As well
as decrunching it back to the EDITOR as well.

You can get the latest version (v1.5) off of Aminet in the dev/amos drawer
called ppACC.lha

Although it's called the craft 2 extension in the magazine, it is infac=

just the same as the turbo extension on aminet. IMHO, it's worth using
but if you've already got AMCAF installed, you'll get on fine without
it.

Have a look in WBStartup in the root directory. If it's in there, delet=

the program and it should all be okay.

When initialising your program, open an extra screen to hold the undo
data, and every time you're about to draw something, copy the whole
screen onto the spare one. Then, to undo, simply copy from the spare
screen, back onto the main one.

Hope that helps...

Why not packing screen in a bank everytime you draw something?
So, it takes less memory and it works exactly like what Ben said
(it's possible that this operation will be slower for unpacking)

Yes, but theres a problem if you want your program to fit on one single 
disk - most people cant run programs from within lha archives - unless 
they have some wonderful proggie like DOpus5 - like me - and then its 
easy as the proverbial pie....

Hi fellow Amiga owners and AMOS users,

This is my first question to the Amos list so here goes:

Recently I have seen a few adverts for the Amos AGA Extension in various United
Kingdom Amiga Mags.  As I have an AGA machine I am very interested in this
Extension to add to my Amos Pro and Craft system.

What I would like to know is has anyone used it yet?  If so does it work
effectively and transparent?

The AGA Extension is 10 UK Pounds including P&P if anyone`s interested and
is available from Petra Software in the UK.

If you use my Easylife extension, you can have pointers and structs!
It is on aminet in /dev/amos.

P.s. If you only have E-Mail access to the internet, you can still get at

I'm working on a text reader made with Amos Pro but i have some problems.

Basically, i load a file in a bank (reserved) and after i use the
Easylife =elmem$(start,max,char) to get a line (max 80 char if checking
there is no EOL char). Line i s printed on the screen (i use Text cmd)
and, when page is full , there is a loop to test if user presses up/down
cursor (line up/down).
The problem is:

- if i press down cursor, there is no problem and a new page is
  displayed. But if i press up cursor something go wrong because i have
  no idea to display the new page starting from the previous line.

  Any idea 

  (sorry if confused)

I can do wire frame graphics.

Hi Paul,

I tried the AmosGuide program you encoded to the list and I
have had a try at it.
First of all, it crashed after selecting a link.

I am very pleased with the layout you choose, I it appealing IMHO.

I think your load-routine now works as I tried some (not many nor
any BIG guides. I have yet to test more.
I started the program, selected the AmosGuide.guide and got the 
guide allright. Scrolling works ok too.
Then I clicked on the first link and got a 80..03 guru.
Just the same as I got on the last version.
As far as I can see: one of the easylife commands is involved in the
crash.

I will try the program only with Easylife as only extension to
eliminate any other influences,.

My system now:
- A500 68000 revision 3
- 1 Chip, 2 Fast
- 1 Mb agnus (512 on board, 512 KCS board)
- KCS Power PC board
- A590 scsi (2 Mb fast)
- ext. HD drive
I start ONLY amospro from boot (using 'BangerMenu')
This way, any influences from the system are 
eliminated
However I have the 'ProFileSystem v10' installed on my RDB.

Have I left anything out ?

It's 'just' the freeware version of the Turbo Extension, which CU decided 
to call Craft 2, even if Ryan Scott had nothing to do with Craft. It was 
on their coverdisk a long time ago.

Didn't get any new version. If it's not too much hassle, maybe you
might want to send one to me only.

I'll check.

V2.00 (i.e. full installed original version + updater 1

AS said, no other ext's to make it easy.

It isn't the craft 2 extension, CU Amiga got a bit confused and called =
it
that after having the craft extension on the coverdisk the month before=

It's just the PD Turbo extension.

That's just what I have planned. I like the idea too very much.
The engine will be as modular as possible eventually.

Sorry, there wondt be a ecs version becoz I really need those 8 bitplanes.
It wouldn't be the same game under ecs.... you know 8*8 pixel blocks
instead of 3*2 (or 2*2).... looks terrible

Thanks for you ideas/opinions/comments!

These problems are fixed by now. The latest version will soon

Correct.

That very little... about 30 lines of asm code.

Raycasting is in AMOS, there isn't actually texturemapping but
scaling which is done in asm, copper setup is all in amos.

	From my understanding of AMOS, changing the procedure so that it can
return more than one value is beyond the scope of what an extension can do. In
fact even C only allows you to return one thing, that thing may be an address
to a structured array but it is still only one thing.
	Your other request, that of providing a way to increase or decrease the
size of arrays is also not directly affectable from extensions. You could
probably fudge it by setting up banks and writing extension routines to access
the banks using addresses stored in the variable and then to increase the size
of the array you would create a new bank with the new size, copy the info over,
swap the banks and then delete the old bank... but that sounds a bit wasteful.
	I think the point I'm trying to make is that I'm sure there are many
things that could be changed about AMOS to make it easier to program, but if
they get changed then will it really be AMOS or some pseudo bastardized C
language.

Why not write your own? It's not that difficult and then you can add things
like compression and so forth. I have my routine playing samples of any length
that are compressed using my own compression routine and they can play up to
25000 samples per second(using only a trivial 20K of memory-- and with a
128x112 animation running at the same time) and I only have a 1200-020. It's
not hard and you might enjoy it!

Nothing more. I would like to know if it's possible to load an IFF image
(without packing it with spack) in an Amos Bank and so, working on it to
display it on an Amos Screen. But i think this is not important because
if it's possible, i will get the Load Iff command written in Amos!

   OK Im gonna try Craft turbo later on, it says it adds like 130 commands
including starfields and star controls etc.  Is anyone else using this 
and is it good on your opinion?

Actually, a slightly better method, in my opinion, is to open the 
other screen as you suggested, but have a variable, say SCR, holding 
which screen should be displayed.

So, say you have screens 0 and 1.

Copy screen 0 to 1.
Draw everything to screen 0
To undo, change SCR to screen 1, put it to the front of the display.

That way, you can REDO your UNDO by changing the SCR back to 0.

(if that makes sense).  That's the way I did it for SemPaint 2, 
anyway.

What would be nice is to have a 'ping-pong' version of ADD so that 
once if you have:

ADD A,1,1 TO 10

once it gets to 10, it goes back to 1 again and vice versa.

It's REALLY  too slow!!
It must be much faster: I haven't tried the Ben's idea, but I'm sure about
it.
It's too slow when crunching images, and not unpacking them!

It does that anyway :-?

Or do you mean it changes the step from -1 to 1 when hitting 10 and 1
respectively. That's impossible. How would the command know which way
to go each time it's being called!!

Well, i think that a lot of extensions have the same commands (ex. star 
fields are supported by Turbo extension,starspro,craft...). I use
Craft extension too, but i think that the more interesting commands are
fractals & encrypting releated (yeh, there are two commands allowing
encryption of an Amos bank with a password!)

Hi Paul,

I tried to load a very big guide (FinalWriterv2.guide)
in this case a guide of about 300Kb and a crash occured
after<-!! the loading.

With your old version (the one that came with easylife)
I tried to find 'the bug' by 'monitor'ing at some positions
This normally would lead to a situation in which some
links work but after three times selecting still a guru would
get shown.
Now I did the same, placing a 'monitor' some three statements
after the first 'do' in the 'main' procedure.
This is after the second call to the read procedure.
Then I started and used the amosguide.guide to test on.
Selecting one link starts the monitor and quitting the monitor
shows the link on screen.
The contents and browse buttons work too in this manner.
The only *only* difference is the 'monitor'
being called after loading or so. I realy cannot imagine why
this happens. I must try a wait or multiwait or so, maybe
that helps or even a free command ?

Does this shed any light on the dark bug? I realy would
like to use the amosguide!

Hi all.
Some days ago, i sent a mail about using Color Fonts with Amos. No one has
replyed and so i've been busy to found a solution. So, if i want to use
a color font, i can create an image with a paint program in which are shown
all fonts i need. After, i can pick up them with the Amos Object Editor and
store them as icons(better bobs?). Every font is stored in a bank position
with the number corrisponding to the ASCII code of the char stored in. If 
i want to print a word with color font on screen, i calculate string length,
i calculate the ASCII code of every char inside string and pick up associated
font from the bank, placing it on Screen at desidered coords.

I need replies about this. Is it a good way? 

I hope in suggestions

I think it is. I don't know about the difference between bobs. As you can 
do more with bobs, I take it it would be faster to use icons (although 
you can use just a few of a bobs bitplanes, maybe making it faster?).

I would keep an array with bankpointers and character-sizes, BTW. So:
COLF[33,1]=1	: Rem Char with ascii code 48 ("0") stored as bob # 1
COLF[33,2]=60   : Rem same char = 60 pixels wide.
This way you don't have to waste space storing control characters. Also 
accents may be stored only once this way. If you feel even this is a 
waste of space, you could reserve a bank of size number_of_chars*2 and 
store the data in there.

There was a commercial extension once that did all kinds of things with 
text. I cannot remember its name though. Anyone know if it can handle 
colourfonts and is still available?

You can use the 3D extension: it adds to the Amos a lot of commands to move
and animate easily 3D objects!!
Otherwise, there are some other extension, like Turbo, that allow you to
calculate in a simple way 3d vectors.
Check on Aminet for Turbo, or buy the 3d extension (it has also got an
editor for 3d objects!).

Bye.

Well, this /is/ the AA chip, or can you do this with ECS ;-)

You probably mean the other screen modes like Super72, Euro72,
Productivity etc? Hmmm... possibly possible ;-) But who ensures, that the
user can display this graphics mode? You could easily destroy his/her
monitor with a wrong screen mode :-\

Hmm I started another extension called Effects-Extension, which currently

;-)

But if I'd implement new bob routines, I suppose quite nobody would use

You have simply to display again all the lines!!
I suppose your lines are in an array, an you display just about 20 lines of
the whole text. So you need a proc like:

Procedure _DISPLAY[L]
    For T=L To L+20
       Text 5,(T-L)*10,LINEA$(T)
    Next
End Proc

where L is the first line on the screen and LINEA$() is a global array with
the lines of the text.
Is it clear??

Good luck!
Bye.

I tried both them and I must say that Block is much faster and easier, but
since it's as fast as Screen Copy A To B, I choose this last.
It works in the same way, but it's easier!!

Sorry if I use this message to tell what I think: AGA on Amos isn't as
useful as it could seems!!  I mean: I have got an A1200 with AGA and I'd
like to use it with Amos, of course, but if I think well, I understand that
in over 3 years (about 10 games and utilities) I have never used HAM: what
could I do with an AGA screen??
Is it really as useful as you say?? Or is it just a will??

Bye and thanX.

	It would probably be better if you used Icons and then squashed them in
a separate bank. Unsquashing takes almost no time at all and unless you are
performing a timing critical task you will not even notice it. If they all are
the same size of icon then you will only need one Icon of that size which is
where you will unsquash the data to. The squashed data should be put in another
bank which could have the bank offsets of each icon kept in 26 words at the
beginning of the bank. To unsquash the data, look up the nth and n+1th word
from
the bank. Copy the data from point Deek(Start(Bank_no)+n) ,
Deek(Start(Bank_no)+n+2) to Icon Base(Some_Icon_No). Invoke the unsquash
command at the location Icon Base(Some_Icon_No) , turn Masking on and then use
the Icon( This will all take a fraction of a second--really!). To avoid
duplication, you could also not compress the first 10 bytes of the Icon because
that is all header information and should be the same for all your
icons(assuming they are all the same size).

Well, AGA is not HAM only. You can also use graphics within the 256 
colour range, too. So, I say, go for it. I can certainly think of alot of 
games and things to make with 256 colours. *8^)

 Is that the same version that crashes the A1200 when used with 
Amos Pro v2.0? If not could you please tell me the Month of the mag so I

I have Craft. I never use it. No commands in it that are any interest to
me. Perhaps there are some command that you need from it- if so then use
it.

As for installing it: Get APME14 from aminet. It lets you select which
extensions to load when you boot amos. 

I've had no negative feed back on it, so I assume that it works on
everyone's machine now.

When you said colour font, I presumed you meant as in usual fonts 
using colours rather than developing your own.  I suppose it depends 
what you want to use them for and what they look like.  I've always 
drawn a grid across the screen, popped each letter in a square, 
opened the screen, but kept it hidden, then screen copied each letter 
across when wanted.  I don't know if this is a good method though, 
probably not!

Yes, it's a good idea, and probable, the BEST.
I think that even Ctext extension uses this kind of tecnique.
It's easy, quite fast (icons aren't too slow!) and you can easily draw
other
personal fonts!!

WHAT???
You don't like Craft extension by Black Legend?? Is it possible??
I have got about 12 extension for AmosPro and if there is a really GOOD

one,
this is CRAFT (and Intuition, of course, since it allows incredible things
for AMOS!).
Of course, the commands about the fractals aren't important for any
programmer, but there are a lot of useful commands: in all my programs,
games and utilities, I use, at least once, commands of CRAFT!

Greetings Stephen, you wrote some text on the subject Powerbobs Ext,
and now I'm going to answer it

I saw an advert for it in a PD library. Apparently, it makes bobs
much faster.

AS seem to be the only magazine who do support it...

Oh no it doesn't! :-) Not under Amos Pro 2.0 (I don't know about other
versions)... I just typed in:

Do 
  X Mouse=X Mouse+(Jleft(1)-Jright(1))
  Y Mouse=Y Mouse+(Jup(1)-Jdown(1))
  Wait Vbl 
Loop 

... and I couldn't use my mouse anymore... can anyone confirm this please?

There are sooooo many features in AMCAF that you tell me you don't even
need ONE of it? (or even more?)

What about the protracker routines, the font routines, the new gfx
commands, the colour instructions, the blitter commands, the whole range
of new disk commands and don't forget the game port functions and the misc
instructions.

Nothing for you inbetween?

Dear Ben,

I had problems starting you game as it said something like 'Bob not

irritating to see them at the top of the program, and not at the end ;-)

Nice graphics, though ;-)

Ok... Will be done ;-)

JW> Could you also please explain the ptile commands.

Sure.

Ptile Bank banknr - sets the current ptile bank

Paste Ptile x,y,i - pastes the tile numbered i at the block coordinates
x,y. That's all about ;-)

The Ptile-Bank maker will be included in the next version of AMCAF.

JW> I might want to use them for the game maps in CommBatt.

Sounds nice ;-)

JW> I have looked at all the map editors on the Aminet that I

What about the original TOME IV editor, which is rather nice ;-)

Anyone that want's to have the AMOS Creator TOME -> AMOS Pro TOME update,

With the required diskfont.library available, AMCAFs font commands are

There is, or was, an amos source code program on aminet about a Tank. It
rotated and was drawn in wireframe in real time.

I might upload a demo I did a long time ago that lets you create your own
wire frame objects and move, rotate, scale them. I only drew a cube and a
few other simple shapes, but the code is very valid.
I'll dig it up.

Of course it CANNOT work, and for a simple reason!!
Even if you move your mouse, the AMOS reads its old position and moves the
pointer to it +/- the joystick function. It means that it won't move it if
you don't move joystick! To avoid it, you have to use a different loop like
this:  (Sorry, but I can't test it now, so it could be wrong as well!)

   Do
      X=X mouse : Y=Y Mouse
      If M<>Joy(1) Then STP=1
      If Jup(1) Then Y Mouse=Y-STP : M=Joy(1) : K=1
      If Jdown(1) Then Y Mouse=Y+STP : M=Joy(1) : K=1
      If Jleft(1) Then X Mouse=X-STP : M=Joy(1) : K=1
      If Jright(1) Then X Mouse=X+STP : M=Joy(1) : K=1
      If K=1 Then K=0 : Inc STP
   Loop

Even if it could seem a bit difficult and strange, it should allow you
moving the mouse pointer by the mouse and the joystick 1, and it accelerate
the pointer if the joy is kept pressed on a direction, allowing also
oblique moviments!

I hope it works properly and you can enjoy it.
Bye.

I told you about the next version of AMCAF!!
What about more intelligent Val() function??
And an Aexec(A$) to exec amos codes inserted in a string??

Bye and don't worry about, I was just joking   :-)
I know the problems about the mail tranfer.

Hello All,

I couldn't help noticing the thread on loading/using colorfonts.  Without
actually firing up AMOS to double-check my methods, I'm sure that colorfonts can
be loaded and typed on the screen just like any regular font.  I once puzzled
over how to do it, and then ended up just opening an 8-color screen, doing the
appropriate things to get the disk fonts list, specifying one of the colorfonts,
and bingo - colorfont on screen, invisibly handled by the ColorText driver
(standard with WB 2.0+).  Pre-2.0 users need to run ColorText, which comes with
DPaint.  I think I had to manually set the palette appropriately, since palette
info isn't readily available from colorfonts using AMOS (unless you access the
file according to its IFF data structure).  In case it matters, I did this under
WB 2.04 with AMOS Pro 2.0.

BTW, does anyone here have the hobby of creating/editing colorfonts via AMOS (or
any other language)?  I have Calligrapher, which is great for a WB 1.3 (or
earlier) program, and creates up to 16-color fonts.  But what of the File specs
on colorfonts, and (this is why I'm interested) could an AGA colorfont driver be
written to allow more than 16 colors in colorfonts?  This may not be an AMOS
project, per se, but one which could be interesting, and very useful.

Sincerely,

John F. Rodgers

	I've noticed a bit of talk about programming 3D vectors lately.  I
am interested in learning about this topic myself and I wanted to know if
anyone can suggest any books (not necessarily AMOS oriented, C++ will do
just fine) on the topic, ideally for the complete beginner.
	Or is anyone willing to post a regular tutorial on the subject, or
perhaps suggest some sites where I can find out more on 3D vectors.
I already have one tutorial called ZED 3D, but it isn't really for a
beginner.

X-Warning: Original message contained 8-bit characters, however during
           the SMTP transport session the receiving system was unable to
           announce capability of receiving 8-bit SMTP (RFC 1425-1428),
           and as this message does not have MIME headers (RFC 1341) to
           enable encoding change, we had very little choices.
X-Warning: We ASSUME it is less harmfull to add the MIME headers, and
           convert the text to Quoted-Printable, than not to do so,
           and to strip the message to 7-bits.. (RFC 1428 Appendix A)
