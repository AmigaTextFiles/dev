What is it?
===========
This program is just a simple example of how one can write a program
that can communicate over the internet without the AmiTCP SDK/C(++). This
program was written in Amos Pro using GUI Extention beta 1.5, which shows
how even an Amos program can use Gadtools. The program uses ARexx to send
commands to AmIRC's ARexx port. I will admit that this is very kludgy, but
it works, although you can't expect real-time response.

What does it do?
================
Well, being a simple example, it doesn't do much. What it does is allow you
to issue certin commands from the GUI's menu like sound effects or crash.
Choosing one of the sound effects options will make the user who you are 
communicating with's computer beep, etc. The crash option will crash their 
computer <VBG> (hehe, I had to throw that in! Use at your own risk!8-) That's
it! Get together with someone on IRC and send them the AP_SLAVE.lha archive
then have them run it. Now have some fun! Spread around to whoever might be 
interested!

Running the program!
====================
Here's what you do. First log on to your ISP and start AmIRC. Make sure
you have AmIRC's ARexx port open (use the MUI settings to check), then
run the AP_MASTER or AP_SLAVE program, which ever you and your friend have
decided upon. After the GUI screen comes up, from the AmIRC window type
'/rx {PATH OF WHERE YOU PUT THE #?.AMIRX FILES:} {MASTER.AMIRX or SLAVE.AMIRX)'
here's an example-
'/rx work:rexx/master.amirx' or
'/rx work:rexx/slave.amirx'

Now monitor the 'AMOSTCP' channel to see if someone else joins then start
playing around with the functions!

About the program!
==================
I wanted to write a game that I could play over the internet, but the only
programming language that I have is Amos Pro, so I knew that I would have
to do some Assembly coding, but then I thought, maybe it could be done via
ARexx over IRC. Well I didn't know any ARexx at the time so I had to look
for some info. Over the course of two days I threw some ARexx scripts together,
having no previous knowledge and used the new Gui ext. for Amos that I d/l'ed
and wrote two simple programs that could communicate with each other over
IRC! It would have take only a day if Amos Pro's ARrexx commands weren't 
so crappy. Oh well, now time for the full example...
*Always have FUN*
