J-Windows is a huge, previously unreleasd Amos extension designed to
let you easily get at many of the interesting and useful parts of the 
operating system. The speed of the executables is the fastest seen yet from
an Intuition extension and J-Windows supports just about every command
you could possibly need, including an easy ListView, which is pretty
impressive.

In English, this means WINDOWS, AGA graphics and proper WORKBENCH support.

J-Windows contains about two hundred new commands and is a 'PROPER'
extension, not a set of procedures, though this is arguable since it does
use procedures that you can create through Gadstools, not supplied.
NB. You don't have to use Gadstols but it is easier & quicker if you do.

Full control of Workbench Windows.  We're not talking Workbench look-
a-like windows on AMOS screens, we're  talking full, proper, multi-tasking,
good-looking Intuition Windows and FAST.

Full control of Workbench screens, including AGA, HAM-8 all the other
interesting varieties of screens you can't use on AMOS. 
This includes support for text (better than AMOS), drawing and changing 
palettes.

Proper gadgets to put in your windows. These are drawn and handled by
Intuition and the extension - you just say  where and when. By the way, 
these are MUCH easier to use than Interface gadgets.

Full support for menus. 
This includes checkable items, mutual exclude and hotkeys.

Supports the GadToolsBox program, which makes the design of complex
user interfaces quick and easy. Using  this,  you  can create a fully 
working set of screens and windows with nice gadgets, all working, without 
typing a line of code! Because coding in AMOS is so quick anyway, you will 
be able to write your program quicker than in almost any other language. 
How quick? The entire examples set for this extension was written in 3 
afternoons!

You can use the proper system file, font and screen requesters. In
about 3 lines of code.

Replacement of the AMOS file handling system with a totally new one.
This is faster (3-20 times faster...), and vastly more logical and 
efficient.

A new font handling system, to replace AMOS's bloody awful one.

Various assorted bug fixes for AMOS, including the equates system
(which now works), and the Merge Ascii menu item which exhibited possibly 
the strangest bug I've EVER seen...

Commands allowing you to use exec lists. Don't know what this means? Enjoy.

Useful little utilities, such as the one that generates code letting
you easily use procedures from the system libraries (sort of an ad hoc
extension creator).

HUGE manual in AmigaGuide form, including 13 tutorials covering
almost every aspect of the extension.

Examples of programs, most of which  actually LOOK GOOD and DO USEFUL
things. Bit of a break for normal AMOS extensions...

Obviously lots more...
