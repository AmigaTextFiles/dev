                       Raster Master V1.6 Documentation
                          Written by Martin Cameron
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The program and sourcecode contained within this archive are free.
Feel free to take routines from the sourcecode and use them in your own
Amos programs.

The gadget procedures were modified from some I found within the TurboPlus
archive on a CU coverdisk, instructions are supplied (sort of).

I came up with RasterMaster around the start of 1994. So I'm not changing it 
now, even if somebody's using the same name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Raster Master is an Amos copper generator, for editing colour tables
and copper bars (how useful in this day and age!).

It's based on Rainbow Warrior, by Martyn Brown(spadge) - a program that's
now 9 years old!

                             Distribution notes:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------                             

   RasterMaster may not be supplied without the following files:
         This doc.
         The Amos sourcecode.
         The relevant demo files.

If you paid more than PD prices for this program, you paid too much!

                            Usage of RasterMaster
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the instructions for the buttons:

Draw Bar - Draw a copperbar on the display using the 2 selected colours.
Draw Grad - Draw half a copperbar using the 2 selected colours.

Dither - Toggles dithering of bars/grads. This makes the large ones look
    much smoother.

Blend - Toggles blending. When this is activated, anything drawn will be 
   mixed in with the background, instead of overwriting it.

Flip Region - Flips a region on the display.
Fill Region - Flood fills a region on the display.
Scale Region - Will squash/stretch a region you have selected.
Copy Region - Cut/Paste region
Clear Screen - Clears the rainbow display to black.
Undo - Undos, actually.

Rainbow size - change the length of the rainbow you are working on.
          Upto 4096 lines, ideal for platformers etc.

Quit/About - Hmmm?

Titlebar - use to drag the editor window up/down to edit the rainbow 
      underneath it.

The palette - You need to select 2 colours to do a bar/grad:
         Use the left button to select colour 1
         Use the right button to select colour 2

   To edit a colour, select with the left button, and drag the sliders.

   To grab a colour into colour 1 in the palette from the rainbow,
   click the indented button next to the palette with the left button

   To flip colours 1 and 2 around, thus inverting a bar/grad, click
   the indented button with the right button.

Disk-Op - Use to load and save rainbows.

   All files saved with Raster Master can be reloaded and Rainbow 
   Warrior (.RWS) files can also be loaded.

   Rainbow Warrior files will only save the top 280 lines of the
   rainbow, or only the first 280 lines of the selected range.
   This is because this is the maximum length of rainbow Rainbow
   Warrior can use.

   Hex and Dec save formats are pure ASCII text files with the values
   separated by commas.

   Assembler is an ASCII file containing standard prefixes to the
   values. This code cannot be compiled and run directly.

   ASCII-AMOS format is a full Amos routine, load into Amos using
   "Merge Ascii" and hit RUN.

  
     Load Iff enables you to load a 32 colour Iff pic to use as a 
     template to model your rainbow on. On loading an Iff pic some
     buttons will appear on the editor.

     Use the arrow buttons to alter the colour the rainbow will
     affect on the picture. 

     Hit the "number button" in between the arrows to view the 
     picture with the rainbow on it.

     Hit "Kill Iff" to kill the picture and return to normal.
