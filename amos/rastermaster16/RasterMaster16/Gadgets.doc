** Ensure you have setpatch running, and a recent version of AmosPro
   AmosPro V1.00 fails when testing these programs!!
   I couldn't get AmosPro 2.00 to start on my unexpanded 1200, but
   it works fine with my accelerator -- any suggestions??

Manual for gadget procedures as seen in RasterMaster 1.6 and MultiWindows

These instructions are only as a rough guide, since I copied them
out of my old, dog-eared amos notebook without checking. The code
is very old in parts, and probably hasn't been fully checked.

Notes on Multiwindows.

In MultiWindows, there are a number of extra parameters for the
different windows etc. The example program should make it clearer,
though.

If you get stuck, you could try emailing me for help. I'm not that 
interested in writing a huge document for an enormous, partly obsolete 
program that I'm giving away free!

The AGads2.1 gadgets are not window-based, and this document is 
more relevant to those. The windows was a sort of last-minute(?)
addition.

Set the gadget variables at the start of the program to the number of
gads you want to use.
 

Gad_Setcolours[Black,White,Grey,Blue]

Used to tell the system which colours of your screen palette to use
when drawing the gadgets.

Gadscan

Call this as frequently as possible in your main loop. It is optimised
and should not slow your program down too much. The number of the gadget
selected will be returned in Param.

Gadtype[Gadnum]

Will return in Param the type of gadget reserved in the slot you specify
Numbers are as follows:

 2  - Button(text)
 5  - Text input gadget
 6  - (Alpha)numerical display
 7  - Cycle gadget
 13 - Vslider
 15 - Hslider
 17 - Checkbox
 20 - Sbut
 23 - Horizontal Slider button 
 25 - Vertical Slider button 
 32 - Radiobuttons

Dont trust them though!

 ---

Gad_Button_create[Gadnum,X,Y,TEXT$]

Creates and reserves a text button. Self explanatory.

 ---

Gad_text_create[Gadnum,X,Y,HSize,Text$,Type]

Creates a Text entry gadget. Hsize is measured in chars.

Type is as follows: 0 - Alphanumerical
                    1 - Numerical

Gad_text_input[Gadnum]

Activates a text input gadget and returns the value in param$.

Gad_text_next[gadnum]

Returns the number of the next text gadget, so that intuition-like
interfaces can be created.

 ---

Gad_cycle_create[gadnum,x,y,length,item1$]

Creates a cycle gadget with one item in the cycle list.

Gad_cycle_additem[gadnum,item$]

Adds an item to the cycle list.

Gad_cycle_get[gadnum]

Returns the number of the item that cycle gadget is set to.

 ---

Gad_display_create[gadnum,x,y,length,text$]

Creates a text display.

Gad_display_set[gadnum,text$]

Sets a display with the text supplied.

 ---

Sliders

Er ... I changed the slider routines a couple of months ago and I can't be
arsed finding out how they work. At least they're fast now. There's plenty
of examples how they work in RasterMaster1.6 - on the Aminet. They're pretty 
straight-forward from what I remember, just call the slider-update procedure
when the gadget loop returns your slider number.

 ---

Gad_Sbut_create[etc]

These are custom buttons which can be any shape and have any graphics inside 
them. Styles are as follows:    

 1 - Thin, Custom graphics may be placed inside.
 2 - Thin, No custom graphics may be placed inside.
 3 - Thick, for Hires screenmode, Custom graphics.
 4 - Thick, as above, No custom graphics.

 ---

Checkboxes, file selectors, infoboxes, requesters etc are easy to use.

Radiobuttons are "attached" to each other by means of specifying the
same "cluster", or group number for each one. That way when a radiobut
is pushed, all the others in the same group will pop up.

Hope this helps...
