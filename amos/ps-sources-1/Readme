Short:    AMOS Sources by Peter Storey.
Type:     dev/amos

This is my first upload of my AMOS Sources: Some of them are pretty old,
but there should be something for everyone here. They were all written
on an A600 (and Later an A1200) in AMOS Pro.  

The sources have been divided into meaningful directories. I've also included
"ALFRED" my version of the AMOS 8x8 font editor as both an executable and the
source.                              

My next sources archive will (hopefully!) contain some of the sources that
havn,t been included in this archive for one reason or another (an I'm not
going to put off releasing this lot yet again.) as well as some programs 
which absolutly NEED the AMCAF extension.
