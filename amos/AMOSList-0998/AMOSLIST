Subject: [amos-list] TOME & Me!
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: pbrowne@qantas.com.au

Hi there,

I just joined the AMOS list!  Just how many people read these things?  I
hope someone does!

Anyway, I've programmed with AMOS off and on since it first came out 'til
the present day.  It used to be just part of my Amiga activities, now it's
about the only thing I use my Amiga for!  Better than nothing, though...

I've written some various garbage programs (some useful, most just trivial
experiments) - nothing really worth noting (anybody need a Hexagon drawing
routine? or another AD&D character generator? - didn't think so :)

My first (and really ONLY) attempt at writing a game was some years ago,
making  use of the TOME extension.  Several versions of AMOS and AMOS PRO
later, and I find that I can't use TOME any more!  My version of TOME is
well out of date (I can't remember what it is off hand, but I DO remember
that it's ancient!)

Does anyone know how I can get hold of the latest version of TOME (AMOS PRO
version!)?  If not, what would be a good if not better substitute?

Thanks,

Phil  8-)

    Tome eh? I've never used it myself but I've heard that it's slow and
hard to use, is it? Anyway I'm afraid that I've never heard of an AMOS
Pro version, but you could try using the AmosTurbo extention. It doesn't
have any map commands, but it has /fast/ Icon commands (and other fast
drawing commands) Any I've used these icon commands to write a full
screen scrolling routine that can update at full speed, 50 fps, if you
use sprites and 25fps if you use bobs.

If anyone wants to see it then I can post a copy onto the list. (it's
quite big though, and *very* complex)

See ya.

	Same here. Too bad I havn't got as much time I need now a days
	for my programming.

	Don't you bet on that. You never know.

AF's Reader game of month is oftenly done in AMOS, too.

I think that that is because of two very good games - SkidMarks and Worms -
which are made in Blitz, and everyone knows that they are made in Blitz,
while I was surprised to hear that Vulcan's Valhalla is made in AMOS.

You need to globalize all your variables when using procedures!

--- Global NUMFLKS, SNOWXPOS(), SNOWYPOS(), SNOWYSPD()

Also the variable SNOWCOLOR is missing!

--- SNOWCOLOR=1
--- Global SNOWCOLOR

You need to load an IFF pic here with some text for the snow to fall on -
backgorund must be color 0. Try with just

--- Cls 0

Have to be:

--- Screen _COLSCRN

The program still doesn't work that great due to some double buffer stuff.
Rewriting it would mean more work than doing a new routine, so... Try to
disable Double Buffer.

   Well, I said there might be errors... wrote that "off the top of my
   head" in e-mail program on PC.  However, it just so happens that I
   have my Amiga on at this very moment, so I will boot up AMOS and
   throw together the snow demo...

   Be back soon!!!

Subject: [amos-list] dictionary layout
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Hakan Venderlof <grok@flashback.net>


I'm planning to make a little dictionary,
the idea is to let the user input one word,
let the program search for the existence of that
word and then display a translation if it exists.

Little, but still there could be thousands of words in it.

Anyone got some idea or exampel for the basic layout
of such a program where the most important thing is to
make it as easy as possible for the programmer to extend
the database...

There is GFX call... U can Use it for public screens outside Amos so I =
don't C why you can't use it
in AMOS..... I'll include dat GFX  along with my SNOW Program in my next =
E-mail As I don't have access 2 my amiga at the moment...
Does Ne one know how 2 use the parallel port with a network cable.. like =
Parnet or pronet as I can't get the parallel commands 2 function =
properly....
Also Does ne 1 know how 2 use bobs on a public screen controlled from =
amos!
I can do every thing else in dos int and gfx calls but I don't fully =
understand the BOB Format!!!
I know how the Image Data is put 2 gether but I'm not sure about the =
rest! =20
PS.. Does Ne1 out there want me 2 program an Isometric snow demo for a =
game or somethin coz i'm working on it!!!! C-YA.....

Hey! Look! At this=85 Ne1 want a piece of code that turns the joystick =
input 2 + or -..

Eg.

J=3DJoy(1)    ;J=3D2 ; Joystick is Down!

K=3DJ-2       ;k=3D0

P#=3DJ/4.0    ;P#=3D0.5

P=3DP#        ;P=3D0

I=3DSgn(J)    ;I=3D1

if P#=3DP     ;This isn=92t true 0.5<>0

X=3DSgn(J-6)*I

End If

If P=3D0      ;This is true

Y=3DI*(K+K+1) ;Y=3D1

End If=20

Say you push the joystick up it returns y=3D-1 X=3D0!

If You Push Joystick Left then X=3D-1 Y=3D0

If You Push Joystick left Diagonally Up X=3D-1 and Y=3D-1

You Could use this in a game!! Something similar 2 tron!

Where U only need the direction in +1=92s or =961=92s!

I=92ve used it and found it gets rid of annoying and slow If =
statements!!!!

Or U could just Delete this as it is a pointless waste of Virtual Paper! =
Unless You have printed it in which case! Help!

Hey! Usefull tip For People Who want 2 scroll... DMA Scrolling doesn't =
change speed dependant on what size of graphic it is moving... It may be =
slow at moving small stuff... But if say you want 2 scroll a screen on 2 =
a screen... Screen copy starts off fast but slows down as U get more of =
the screen scrolling.. where as doing it by Direct Memory Access =
doesn't....

So There U Go... If You want 2 Know what I'm on about check out the =
Logbase(#) command!
You can Use DMA 4 Tint effects 2!

Hi Everybody,

> From: Hakan Venderlof <grok@flashback.net>

> Hm has someone got a code for a 'snowfall'
> preferably where snow slowly builds up in bottom of screen...?

I've dug this one up from my 'programs that never got finnished' and,
er, finnished it. I had to do a complex work-around to stop the snow
making huge spikes going up the screen and its not very fast, but when
using AmosTurbo commands + compiled I get about 20fps with 200 flakes on
my 040/25mhz :) .

    PS. I've left the turbo commands in there, change F Plot to Plot and
F Point to Point if you don't have AmosTurbo.

Enjoy

From: Andy Gibson <andy@agasinc.demon.co.uk>

Hi there,

From: Andy Gibson
Date: Sunday 30-Aug-98
Time: 02:41:25
Hi there guys,

I am using the command GUI Display Iff 10,2

Wich works well, it shows the iff image held in bank 10.

I can also clode this screen with GUI Screen Close 2

So far so good, but what I can do is:

GUI Display Iff 10,2
GUI=GUI Wait
If GUI=-11
GUI Screen Close 2
End If

I can't seem to get anything from the mouse at all on this
screen. It only works when i flip back (Amiga & M) to my GUI
screen 1 (created with Gadtools). If I click on that one, the
mouse is read and the GUI Screen Close 2 command then
works!!!

Anyone got ny ideas How I can access the mouse butons on a
screen created with the GUI Display Iff command?

Cya.

Subject: [amos-list] TOME & Me!
So here's a reply...

Hi there everyone,

> Does anyone know how I can get hold of the latest version
of TOME (AMOS PRO
> version!)?  If not, what would be a good if not better
substitute?

Well Phil, I have Tome which works with Amos Pro plus all the
examples etc! I can't rememebr where it came from or how long
I have had it for....

Dunno if it is illegal or not, but I have never used it to be
honest! It does work and seems stable enough.

The archive is quite big due to examples etc, but if you want
it, email me and I will send it. If this is illegal, I'm sure
someone on this list will tell me so :-)

Anyway, the offer is up for anyone who wants it either way.

I'm sure the author of Tome is long gone by now anyway and
seeing as Tome is not available to buy any longer, no harm
done...but again, if I'm wrong, tell me...

Tarra....

Looks good to me ;), I've just updated my code with this idea, and it
seems to be a little faster now. Here is the new ver.

See ya.

Subject: [amos-list] Re: Hey! Ne1 Like Joysticks?
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

> Hey! Look! At this Ne1 want a piece of code that turns the joystick
input 2 + or -..

Hmm, this seemed a bit too complicated, so I decided to check it out
(and I managed to kill 5mins at the same time ;)

I built a timing loop to test the 2 versions :

'different way
Timer=0
For A=0 To 100000
   J=Joy(1)
   K=J-2
   P#=J/4.0
   P=P#
   I=Sgn(J)
   If P#=P
      X=Sgn(J-6)*I
   End If 
   If P=0
      Y=I*(K+K+1)
   End If 
Next 
Print Timer


' Old way
Timer=0
For A=0 To 100000
   X=0 : Y=0
   If Jup(1)
      Y=-1
   End If 
   If Jdown(1)
      Y=1
   End If 
   If Jleft(1)
      X=-1
   End If 
   If Jright(1)
      X=1
   End If 
Next 
Print Timer

before compiling the Old way was a lot faster, but after compiling it
was a lot closer:

no joystick movement

Old:155 
New:143

Holding down on joystick
Old:154
New:193

Although new is quicker when there's no joy activ. it slows down when
the joystick is pressed.

But, 50vbl out of 100000 loops isn't going to make a lot of difference
anyway so you may as well just use whichever you prefer.

Subject: [amos-list] DMA... Its all in the Bitplanes! 4 graphics Ne way
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "John Glanville" <John.Glanville@btinternet.com>

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

------=_NextPart_000_0048_01BDD65C.2E814140
Content-Type: text/plain;
	charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

DMA Can Be usefull but it also can be slow.... say for instance u wanted =
2 Use a tint effect in a game or something... Okay sure U could Use =
point.... read in all the pixels... then change their colour accordingly =
2 the tinted colours in your pallete! Then again you must have a vastly =
Excellerated Computer!!!!!!! So Instead U could Use DMA.... If U know =
how Screens and Bitplanes work its easy from here.....

Screens work by layers of bits... take a 64 colour screen... it has 6 =
bitplanes 2 keep under control...
this is why the more colours U have when doin graphics the slower things =
can be.... All of the first 4 bits, if they all =3D1 then the number =
produced from 11110 is 31 meaning colour 31... so if U turn the last bit =
2 a one U are infact adding 32 2 the original 31 coz Binary works like =
this

1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
1 1 1 1  1  0

Col=3D1+2+4+8+16
Col=3D31

and what happens if u add 32 to a number lower than 32 in a EHB palette? =
Any guesses!!!
You change the colour 2 Half Brite....
So if U were 2 make a prog 2 just change the bits at bitplane 5 on a 64 =
colour screen you would get darkening effects.....

But just wait till u use it with 256 cols on a public screen!! HEY HEY! =
Thats fun!
Here is a bit of code 2 change the bits on a screen from your =
coords.....
Don't Let anything go out side the confines of You screen especially on =
the Y axis
coz what You R seeing is memory on your screen so if You poke past the =
set memory 4 Your screen U R likeley to crash!!!!
Use a clipping procedure or like i have 4 the mouse.
Limit Mouse 128,42 To 320+127,255+41
L0=3DLogbase(0)                                        ;This can change =
depends on what U want 2 do!
Do=20
   MX=3DX Screen(X Mouse)
   MY=3DY Screen(Y Mouse)
   PX=3DMX/8
   AX=3DMX-(PX*8)
   Bset(7-AX),L0+(MY*40)+PX                            ;All ways make =
sure that L0 is at a logbase though..
Loop=20

You could also use copy or fill on the screen 2 get large chunks of =
Bitplanes changed.....
Also if You want shapes just open another screen with 2 colours ( 1 =
bitplane )
draw the shape then grab that pitplane and paste it 2 where U want.. or =
U could Use a BOB system!

Subject: [amos-list] The New Official AMOS Factory!
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Rune J. Keller" <keller@vip.cybercity.dk>

The allnew official AMOS Factory is now online!

There are a completely new design, support from the AMOS Development Group,
info about upcoming AMOS projects and much more.

This is going to be THE AMOS site so please help us to maintain and improve
the site with information about your new work.

To celebrate the day we have the ALL new AMOS Lib 2.2 (NOT the one sent to the
mailinglist a few days ago, but a new bugfixed version!) by Pietro Ghizzoni.

Even though the site is currently located at my server you can still enter it
through http://www.seta.it/amos. We hope that all AMOS users out there will
use and support the site and thus helping AMOS to be even better.

Rune J. Keller
Webmaster at AMOS Factory

	As for Parnet you'll have to go by DOS-commands.
	If you try to do something by PAR: or PRT: Parnet will hang your A.
	One way is to open a logical file to "NET:" and send your data throu
that one.

Well done, it looks really good :)

Actually, one of the best looking website I've seen in a long time...

From:	Sieppo <samali@utu.fi>

Hi folks,

Summer is gone and I'm back.
In fact I've been here all the time but I haven't got any time to write
anything (We have a three-months-old little lady who have taken all of our
spare-time).

I just uploaded my game, Hooked, to Aminet. Go and look at it, will you?
I think it's a nice try but it's not what I want it to be; I think Hooked
should be Intuition-based game (I've got only classic Amos so I can't use
Gui-extension).
If any of you like Hooked and want to see it working on a window I will
gladly send source-code to anyone who love to read crappy code and write an
Intuition-version of it.

I also have written a PC/Win-version of Hooked using C++. PC-Hooked is what
Amiga-Hooked SHOULD be - I'm sorry to say it, but that's a fact (let me know
if you want a peecee-version).

Well, we have Europe, Asia, North America, South America and Australia. And
perhaps here is someone from South Africa, well hiding ;)

Hi there all

Very cool page
the only thing I would like to see changed
is in the front page.
There , it is a mention that "we will try to announce that amos is 
still alive and running"
ok it may sound picky of myself
but in my opinion this mentions make it sound like amos is dead and 
we are trying to revive , in my opinion this mentionts should be 
removed.
Anyway , I will send details of my project soon
and also gfx for developers.
See ya!

Subject: [amos-list] Amos to DirectX (slightly off-topic)
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Andy H <geosync@ozemail.com.au>

Hi all,

I don`t want to come out sounding like a smug bastard or a Microsoft
supporter, but I've been learning DirectX code and I believe it is
encouraging news for us AMOSers.
I`ve got this book 'Windows Game Programming For Dummies' by Andre
LaMothe, and it's a gem.  Andre used to write Amiga games and it shows
in his code.  Using DirectX w/ VC++, he has recreated much of AMOS
functionality but on a IBM platform.
I thought this DirectX stuff was going to be difficult and I found it
can be quite easy.  Admittedly it's a bit of a grind to wade through
complexities of COM and methods for DirectX, but once you have read that
bit, the rest becomes a breeze.
This is starting to become a book review....Anyway my main point is,
using DirectX, us guys can get our Amiga games onto multiple platforms
with a bit of study of DirectX.  I know it's defeating the purpose of
defending the Amiga and AMOS but wouldn`t you like more people to check
out your games?  The new Sega console supports DirectX so you could
theoretically get you game onto that too.
FOOD FOR THOUGHT ANYHOO...
Andy H.

Subject: [amos-list] UAE
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Alastair Murray" <malcolm.murray@virgin.net>

Just a note to the person asking about TOME. There is an update to
allow TOME to work in AMOS Pro, I had a feeling it was done by Chris
Hodges but I'm not sure. I also think that its on Mush's site.

Now my question....
All of my AMOS created programs work fine on UAE except one, Backbone.
Does anyone know what there could be about it that causes a crash in
UAE? I can only think that it is its large size and memory
consumption...

Thanks,
-Murray

I like the site, its of a very good standard and I look forward to seeing
updates to it. One thing I would like to see (if possible) is a past, present
and future page. By this I mean a page detailing the high's and low's of AMOS
and how it has been  (being) developed.

Keep up the good work.

  Can you figure out how to cut the HTML from your mail to this list?

  It triples your message size.

Subject: [amos-list] Challenge for AmosPro Programmers...
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

I have a challenge for any AmosPro programmer, I am currently writing
an RPG based on ChronoTrigger, (I may need beta testers for it after I
sort it out propperly) and I have developed a full screen map scrolling
routine. The only problem is, its not very good: Because AMOS seems to
update screen offsets 1 vbl after screen swaps the bob updates became
unsynced so my routine has to waste a VBL to fix this problem. It also
has various other problems in it and its messy and slow.

    I'd be happy if someone could write:

    A map scrolling routine for 16 colour 16x16 icons in a display
288x160 32 colours (the screen can be any size)
    It must be able to display 32 colour bobs.
    It must be able to handel tile animation.
    It must be as fast or faster then my own (mine can go at full 25fps
even with a bit of tile animation). Preferably running at 50fps based on
hardware scrolling although if you could get software scrolling at a
good speed...

    I have the AmosTurbo extention, and you can use ASM procedures, DMA
etc.

    If no-one wants to write one of these off the top of there heads (I
took me a while for me to sort mine out) then I could rip mine from my
sorce and post it so someone can optimise it.

I'd be greatful if someone did manage this for me ;)

See ya

Well, if you can cast your mind back to the days when the Commodore 64
ruled, you may remember a game named R.O.B.B. (Raid Over Bungling(?) Bay) -
a simple yet fun helicoptor game.  The view is from above the chopper, and
it basically rotates in the centre of the screen while the ground below
scrolls beneath you (in many directions).  Lots of jets trying to shoot you
down, and patrol boats, guns, etc...

I was trying to make an AMOS/Amiga version of this.  Having never really
attempted to code a game before, it was quite fun and challenging.  I got
the helicoptor flying about the screen, shooting stuff, and I used TOME to
scroll the background.  Unfortunately, this last part failed miserably -
the scrolling was REAL slow and had some other nasty bugs.  And for
whatever reason, I left this project on the back burner and have only
really gotten back to it lately - which is when I found that my version of
TOME didn't like AMOSPRO.

I'd like to give this another shot.

Yes, it appears to be quite slow, though the demos that came with my
version seemed fast enough... might be just me and my program!!

AmosTurbo huh?  Sounds like it might be worth a try.  How can I get hold of
THAT extention?  (Just add it to my AMOS christmas list? ;)

Pretty popular language, this AMOS!

I program for a living (hands up all those other professionals!) and play
around with AMOS at home when the urge hits me.

True, I guess.  I'll make a list of the programs I've written and anybody
who wants to look at them can have them!

My biggest project was a Solar System generator program (taken directly
from the old Sci-Fi RPG "Universe" - I like "computerising" things like
this.)  I was going to incorporate this into some Game/Utility - but as
usual, never quite got there.  Maybe one day...!

And while on the topic of this, MYSELF has been learning how to use
DirectX with (ugh, ) Visual Basic 5. Its acually pretty simple,
and I've started to write a little module that begins to emulate some
amos commands...

And while programming DirectX in C is fine, VB is a lot easier!!! :)

I just recently wrote the beginnings of a Compact Disc Catalogue program,
with the emphasis on it being able to write out a random access file in
alphabetic/numeric order.  The user would input a name of the CD and some
other details and that data would then be inserted into the file at the
correct point.

This, I think, could be easily adapted for your Dictionary idea.

If this is at all interesting to you (or anyone else), I will post the code
to this list.  It's not pretty, but it DOES work.

From: =?X-UNKNOWN?Q?=D6mer_=D6ZYILDIRIM?= <km97y019@students.itu.edu.tr>

	Hi there 
	I have problems about bobs such as:

	- Suppose I have a bob with only 1 bitplane (2 colors). How can I
get AMOS to display it with different colors on a screen with 4 bitplanes
(16 colors). That is I will use only one bob instead of 15 for all color
combinations and it will be only one bit deep instead of 4 resulting a
1/60 of the data size.

	- Relating the previous problem, suppose I have a 32 color screen
& 16 color bobs. How can I get AMOS to display bobs with alternating 16
color of the palette (i.e. 0~15 and 16~31)?

	These sound like to be solved with PLANE ON/OFF & PLANE PICK
parameters I found in AMIGA's font structure plus bit-shifting during the
blitting process. BUT I really don't know how to get AMOS accomplish these
tasks. May be minterms or something or an extension.

	PLUS I need to combine two BOB banks during loading into a
program. Suppose I have N bob banks to be merged in my program which I
will load in pairs. Otherwise I'll have to combine the banks in the bank
editor and have N*N bob banks resulting in a bizzare size of data!


	If ayone has the answers please let me know. By the way I had to
give up my AMOS 3D project due to the lack of a good obj editor or a
converter which would be an AMOS Tekken clone.

	Thanks.

	Omer <km97y019@mobydick.cc.itu.edu.tr>

Ah yes!  Broderbund's Bungling Empire trying to build a battleship.
A great game, watch out for those homing missiles.
Was bombing factories one of the objectives?
Shouldn't be to difficult for AMOS Pro.

Hi listers

I just want to thank all the people who sent me comments on *Imperator*. The
response has been massive :-) but I will nevertheless reply to everybody
individually. Thanks to all of you!

An Imperator-FAQ will be posted to the list very soon.

Now for the few *VAIN*, *JEALOUS* and possibly *SCHIZOPHRENIC* beings who
didn't condescend to send me comments, I'll just say... I forgive you :->>>
(Don't get me wrong, I'm kidding!)

You still have a chance to see the demo and the preview on AmigaFlame:

Greets to all

X-Status: 

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

Well, I don't know exactly how you'd do it, but I've got a pritty good
idea how it'd work (I cant remember the right commands)

>     - Suppose I have a bob with only 1 bitplane (2 colors). How can I

You'd have to set the bob mode/mask so that you could select which
bitplanes the bob should display. I think you'd have to convert it to a
16 colour bob and colour it colour 15 so that the original used all of
the bitplanes, then you could disable the ones you don't want. (I think)

>     - Relating the previous problem, suppose I have a 32 color screen

16

    What you'd have to do is create a copy of all the frames of that
bob, making a 32 colour bob that is completely colour 31 (like a mask)
and then draw that bob directly over your 16 colour bob, and set the
masking bobs bitplane to only use bit 5.

I can't remember which command to set bobs bitplanes, but I know it can
be done with no extentions (I've seen it in an old AMOS demo)

>     PLUS I need to combine two BOB banks during loading into a

I can't help you with this one I'm afraid because I don't use Bob banks,
I've got my own system of loading bobs using IFF screens. If anyone
wants to know how then I can distribute the routines source.

    I know, its crap isn't it. And if you'r thinking of tekken, foret it
with the current Amos3D as it has no real support for animation, It was
hard enough animation a simple 4 frame character.

I'd like to see this code as I may end up recoding it with
the GUI Ext which I'm beginning to get into :)

Send it via private mail in case others on the list don't

Ok!  Here it is, for what it's worth.

As I said, it's not the prettiest code in the world, but it's fairly simple

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

Feel free to recode!  I'd like to see what it SHOULD look like.

The program as-is is pretty small (and has much room for expansion!)

Check one of my other posts for the code.

Oh, and thanks heaps for TOME!  I'll give it a try this weekend.

Broderdund!  Ah yes, It's all coming back to me now (it's been a while
since I saw/played it).

I agree that it shouldn't be too hard, in fact that's why I tried in the
first place (a simple enough concept that I could code).  OK then, I'll do
it!  But give me a couple of years... :)

And yes, bombing factories was the objective (plus bombing the destroyer
itself) - naturally, the more factories you destroyed, the more viscious
the jets got.  We (my friend and I) never did take out all the factories -
but we got close!

Damn, now I want to play it again!!

The quick answer is that it makes realistic solar systems.

In "Universe" there was a complex, fairly thorough method of creating solar
systems that could be visited by the players in that RPG.  First you pick a
star (type) and then determine such things as number of planets, moons for
each planet and asteroid belts.  Then for each planet and moon AND asteroid
belt, you determine other things like size of the planetoid, temperature
and etc.  Each planet is broken down into segments (as little as one for a
small moon through to fifty or so for big planets) and the terrain for
these segments is then determined.

What I've written is a pretty big program that does all the above plus
draws the planets (when selected) and gives some details on them.  I guess
it's about 80% complete.  What I wanted to do was draw continents and etc
on the planets, based on the terrain for each segment.  I never could quite
work out a way to do that, though.  (What is drawn is a planet with lots of
ringed segments filled with a certain terrain "picture" - the end result
doesn't look at all real, but it does convey the general nature of the
area).

Other things like civilization level, population, etc have not yet been
coded (in the game, it was up to the GM to determine such things, often
based on proximity of the solar system to Sol (the centre of of the
civilized Universe in this case).

The program (like many of my programs, in fact) needs a decent interface.
Not very user friendly, I guess.  :)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I discovered the problem of samples looping forever. I got round it by using
the channel masking, so that not all 4 voices were used by the sample. I
cant remember the exact details but if you look in the Amos manual it
explains voice masks better.

You can use an extension - this ALWAYS happens with the AMOS Music Ext. What
you CAN do, however, is to do some tricks with loading it as a binary file and
then convince AMOS that it is a MED file. I can't remember exactly how, but I
have done it this way.

There definetly IS a solution to this, although I can't remember it.

Sorry for a really dumb question,
the amos.lib that was included with this mail is obviously not a replacement
for the AMOSPro.lib in my AMOSPro system drawer (or is it?). So how do I
upgrade to v 2.2 library?

Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Andy H <geosync@ozemail.com.au>

Hi all,

On the subject of LHA's being corrupted, I have found that some servers
don`t recognize the LHA suffix and treat it as some sort of unspecific
binary file (ergo goodbye LHA).  The easiest way to stop this from
happening is to archive as usual using LHA but rename it to #?.ZIP when
sending it over the Internet.  Most servers respect the archive
structure of the IBM ZIP file and wont tamper with it.  When the user
recieves the "fake" ZIP file they can simply rename it and unpack with
LHA.

Andy H.

I don't think it's lha. I think it's uuencoding. I was having some trouble
sending anything to a friend until I switched over to base64 encoding.

	hey folks,
	alot of your mail is coming to me in two parts, one a text file
and one an HTML formatted file.   I use Pine for unix which will let me
view the text part but it takes a few steps and is a pain.  The html file
is identical to the text file and I think some of you with HTML or WEB
based email services are getting your mail sent as both plain text and
HTML.  I find it a slight hassle to deal with but not that bad, still if
you didn't realize this was happenign you may want to check the settings
on your email service.

			Thanks,
				Scott Matott sXe

That would be "Sam play <sample num>, <voice mask>" and the mask works like
%1010. Each number of the mask representing an audio channel of course :).

- the official AMOS site - The Amos Factory (http://www.seta.it/amos/)
- the new official AMOS PD Library - (http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk)
- the new great mailing-list  (Thanks Michael Cox!)
- the upcoming GNU Amos Distillery (see belove)
- AmosZine is coming back!!

But i want even more! :) There are again a lot of AMOS users who doesn't
know our site, the mailing list, the development work and so on..... we need
local support!!! So.. we've created the headquarter, now we need the local
branch of our factory :) The AMOS clubs must be opened again!

If someone is interested in this project, please contact me. I'm searching the
local coordinators for the several countries! Now you'll not be alone, but
thanks to internet you'll a member of our great family.

Other projects are under construction... now i want spent some words about
the *GNU Amos Distillery.* What is it? oh well.... this is my dream! Probably
you've heard something about the Free Software or GNU programs.... please
visit now the Free Software Foundation at http://www.fsf.org, you'll find tons
of infos about this great concept!!!

The GNU Amos Distillery will be the support site for GNU Amos projects... i
strongly belive in the Free Software power, and the site will share this power
with all the amos community! 

``Free software'' refers to the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute,
study, change and improve the software.  More precisely, it refers to three
levels of freedom:

The freedom to study how the program works and adapt it to your needs.
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can share with your neighbor.
The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the
public, so that the whole community benefits.

A Free program is updated 10 time faster then a commercial one!

Several attempt to create mailing-list projects has been made in the past
period.... in the near future you'll have the oppurtunity to make them a
reality using the Free Software formula! Several famous projects are available
as Free Software.. one name: Lynux!

Please visit the Free Software Foundation site! This project will let us to
produce good quality software, and show to the other the real amos (.. and its
community) capabilities!


_*Anyway YOU are the succesfull key of our projects! without YOUR support*_
_*our efforts are vanished!*_


Phew..ok... it isn't finished :) As i want always offer a good support, visit
the Amos Factory, and soon in the download section you'll find a demo version
of the OsDevKit Extension! Many users doesn't know this powerful
extension.. this is the /demo/ version of the commercial version released some
time ago by Quartz Informatique (France). *ATTENTION:* it doens't reflect the
actual status of the extension! Now it's bigger (90k! this is 47k!), easier
and powerfull! anyway it give you a clear idea about its capabilities! Enjoy!

A little GUI Extension V2 demo program will be also available for testing....
so you can see in action some new features! ;)

Hi Everybody,

really
> meant woz does Ne1 Know how 2 turn a RGB Screen 2 A RRGGBB screen?

So you want to use a 24 bit palette in AMOS? I'm afraid that isn't
supported propperly by amos at the moment. I think the only way to do
this with an AMOS screen is to ether mess around with the copper list or
find an AGA extention. 

See ya.

Print Timer

Compiled with AMOS PRO Compiler and tested on a 14MHz NTSC
Amiga... 

NO JOYSTICK MOVEMENT
  First version: 779
  Second version: 502
  My version: 471

HOLDING DOWN ON JOYSTICK
  First Version: 933
  Second version: 511
  My version: 476

Obviously, if tested on an accelerated Amiga the performance will be
greatly increased (ie. smaller times) and it is much shorter as well.

Hi,

did ya know? if you load "mouse.abk" from the amos-system-dir into the spritegrabber, you can change the outlook of the three mouse-phases. just replace them with your own favourite mouse-pix, and save that thing back into "mouse.abk". thats all!!
now you have your own designed REAL mouse useable in your programs!!

Hey!!! I WAS BORED OKAY!!!! I didn't think ne1 would be strange enough 2
even reply... Let alone do a speed test on it!!! Now I have had 2 replys
this is getting crazy! Ne way... I had no Idea that those amos commands
existed! true I had ceen them before but i just never though about it!...
basically You can do the same thing as U have done 2 keystate commands..
which is what i do! So if I had known about those commands I would never
have bothered 2 write the code! So why is everyone so strange???????
Ne way! Have fun! and I'll be Round so if u want ne code lengthened or made
more complicated! I'm right here! BYE!
oh by the way... if u want it 2 go faster use variables instead of the 1's
it most probably wont make a difference for a single digit.. but it takes
longer 2 read in any numbers and work out there values that it does 2 read a
variable.. thats why it is faster 2 open a screen if u write
Screen open 0,640,256,16,Hires
instead of....
Screen open 0,640,256,16,32768
as Hires is an internal variable!

BYE!

I'm kinda of wondering why do you always write your e-mails that way...
don't mean to sound anal. With all your "Ne1, 2, ceen, etc.."'s... I
mean... its an e-mail... I think you'd have time to write full words. Also
considering we are dealing with programming code here it could become
somewhat confusing at times. Don't mean to me critical and such... but...

Do u see whut I meeen?

See ya.

Well, I've got some code that rotates+scales a picture in real time
(slow), and I have a full 3d rotating vector map complete with lense
flare (a bit slow).

If there any use to you just ask ;) (ps. when you say Isometric, do you
meen like Head over Heels / Solstice gfx?)

I'm playing with that right now!  I haven't done any texturemapping yet,
but have worked with cage vectors and filled vectors.  I'm doing that in
C, but befora that I wrote an AMOS program that rotates a beercan ;) and I
could also give you docs which helped me to write it. It is much easier
then it seems :)

Exactly, right down to the -1 return value when the port buffer is 
empty.

Subject: [amos-list] Fast texturemapping(?)
Status: O
X-Status: 

From:	SLin <samali@utu.fi>

I have an idea of using blitter to draw fast(?) plots, etc. The problem is that I'm not so familiar with assembly, so I can't optimize it. I'm not 100% sure that it is the fastest way ever to draw textured objects but I think it could be !

So, if you are an assembler-coder and want to join this project, e-mail me!

Hi Everybody,

On 06-Sep-98, John Glanville wrote something which is obviously worth
replying to:

> Thanx... Phil!

Thanks for optimizing it, but you left a few bits out. Here is a working
version which will let you move about the map as well. 

BTW. How are you going to use this in an isometric engine? I think
theres probably a much quicker way of rotating isometric blocks by 90
degrees. (if thats what youre doing)

See ya.
