@node Intro "ADB`s Games Volume 3 - Introduction"


      This is my 3rd games release for the Amiga - though perhaps
      misleading since the ABI Encoder and Decoder programs are not
      games!

     @{" Games Vol. 1 " link GV1} - Games Volume 1 (Alutia's Jewels and Breaker)
     @{" Games Vol. 2 " link GV2} - Games Volume 2 (BLIAM! and Simple Art 2004)

@endnode

@node GV1 "ADB's Games Volume 3 - Introduction / Games Volume 1"

      My first games release included 2 games - Alutia`s Jewels and
      Breaker.

      Alutia's Jewels was my first game I made for the Amiga and is a
      simple maze game where the aim is to work your way through to
      get to the Jewel at the end of each stage.
      Being my first game, made back in 2003, it has no sound (!) and
      very simple graphics. This got me hooked on programming again and
      shortly after finishing this (and after my brother moved out) I
      was able to start work on my second game, Breaker.

      Breaker is a clone of a game that was found in the back of my
      Spectrum 128K manual, called Bustout.
      A very simple game at heart, all you do is move the bat to keep
      the ball in play and destroy the bricks to score points. Once
      the target score has been achieved you were able to move on to the
      next stage (of which there are 15) by pressing the relevant key
      on the keyboard or by letting the ball go out of play.

      This is my first (and only) game so far to feature a working
      scoreboard, which is saved onto the disk. Also hidden away is a
      file that stores your total game time (up to a maximum of 999
      days, 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds!) which was inspired
      by a similar stats feature included on many of Sega`s Saturn
      games.

@endnode

@node GV2 "ADB's Games Volume 3 - Introduction / Games Volume 2"

      My 2nd games release featured one game called BLIAM! and an art
      program called Simple Art 2004.

      Work on BLIAM! began back around Sept/Oct 2004 and was to be my
      3rd piece of software written for the Amiga using AMOS. This game
      turned into something slightly different to what I had planned,
      but either way it was to be a puzzle game.

      This was my first program to feature music by myself aswell as a
      cool piece of music by M. Brown (aka SPADGE). My music skills
      were fairly limited, but not bad for my first attempt! Hopefully
      my composing skills will get better with time.

      I originally planned to make 50 levels, but after 4 months of
      solid development (and some programmers block!) I found that
      most of the new levels I had designed were too similar to those
      already in the game. If you want more levels feel free to @{"contact" link ContactMe}
      @{"me" link ContactMe} requesting more levels - perhaps throw in some suggestions and
      get your name in the credits!

      After fixing a few bugs and re-writing the code to optimise speed
      BLIAM! was finally finished by 31st December 2004.


      Simple Art 2004 (SA2004) was, surprisingly, originally written
      early in 2004 and was only for my personal use.

      However, the file selector was no more than an INPUT command and
      there was no way of viewing files already on the disk (or the
      harddrive) and a few other things needed improving too.

      I had hoped to have the improved version of SA2004 finished by
      the end of February 2005, but I kept on finding bugs which needed
      fixing.

      With the addition of a few features and having improved it I felt
      that I could include it on this disk for others to use. I realise
      that it doesn`t have many of the features that professional art
      packages have, but it was only meant to be a simple art program.

      Although it is just an art program, I have included the option
      to load in AMOS (.abk) music bank files. Since there wasn`t
      enough space on the Games Volume 2 disk, I included an extra
      disc which contained all the AMOS music files I had at the time.
      Most, if not all, are by M. Brown (aka SPADGE) and not myself
      sadly - though I have used them in my own games until I can
      write some decent music :)

      Feel free to @{"contact me" link ContactMe} with suggestions on how it could be
      improved and you may just find your name on the credits of
      Simple Art 2005 (which may not be finished until 2006!).

@node ABI_Enc "ADB's Games Volume 3 - ABI Encoder"

      The ABI format was a brainwave I had back in June/July 2005. At
      first it started out as just an experiment as I didn't expect it
      to create files that are, most of the time, smaller than the
      standard IFF image format.

      Once I had the format down on paper, it took me a few months to
      code up the Encoder and Decoder files. Both were finished by
      October, but I still had the introduction file to write and
      (thanks to Karsten Schenk) I got distracted by some new AMOS
      Extensions I had, among other things.
      The introduction file was finally written in December and made
      use of the 3D letters I had modelled earlier in the year when
      experimenting with AMOS's 3D Object Modeller program.

      I hope that you will find this program useful, it converts IFF
      images into my ABI image format. I suggest you try it with
      the Turbo Mode on atleast once, as it can speed up the program
      by up to 25%! However, it can sometimes crash your Amiga! :(


@endnode

@node ABI_Dec "ADB's Games Volume 3 - ABI Decoder"

      The ABI Decoder program is used to convert ABI images back to
      the standard IFF format.
      This will be useful for those of you that use my forthcoming
      Simple Art 2006 art program which will be out sometime around
      Autumn 2006. I fully intend it to use both the IFF and ABI file
      formats.


@endnode

@node ImagesF "ADB's Games Volume 3 - Images Folder"

      This folder contains various demo images, with most in both IFF
      and ABI format for you to compare.
      All images starting with "VL" are by Vicky Lavington and, possibly,
      some of her mates (Kerry and Louise, among others).

@node Install "ADB`s Games Volume 3 - Installing On A Harddrive"

      Both the ABI Encoder and ABI Decoder programs will happily run
      from the harddrive, but please make sure that the "Req.Library"
      is in the appropriate "Libs" folder (either in "Sys:Libs/" or a
      "Libs/" folder in the same place as the ABI programs as I let
      workbench deal with any serious disk problems (e.g. checksum
      errors, disk corrupt etc.).

      The "GV3_Intro" program will require that the "c3d.Lib" be in
      a folder called "3DSource" stored in the same directory. Otherwise
      you can expect a "Cant load 3d code" error message after the
      text scroller has finished (or been skipped).


@endnode

@node Bugs "ADB`s Games Volume 3 - Bugs / Problems"

      Hopefully after weeks of testing, none of the programs should
      contain any bugs.

      However, in the unlikely event that one slipped through, or that
      you are having difficulty running the programs on your Amiga,
      please @{"contact me" link ContactMe} with as much information as possible.
      Try to include the error message along with details of what you
      were doing, what Amiga you are using and whether it has been
      expanded in any way - I only have an expanded Amiga 600 so it`s
      hard for me to test for problems on other machines.

@node AboutMe "ADB`s Games Volume 3 - About Me (Andrew D. Burton)"

      I am (currently) 26 years old with a long history of playing
      games across many formats, including Nintendo`s Donkey Kong
      Game & Watch, various table top electronic games, most of Sega`s
      machines and an Amiga CD32.

      I started programming on my Spectrum 128K when I was about 12
      years old (in the early 90`s), but being young (and new to any
      kind of programming language) most of my efforts were rather
      poor - which was not helped by the fact that there were no sprite
      commands in Spectrum BASIC!

      In 2001 I acquired @{"my Amiga 600" link MyAmiga600} along with a boxfull of disks and
      various other bits & pieces. I did get into AMOS back then but it
      was mostly for fun and with 500 commands to learn it wasn`t going
      to be easy!

      In 2004 I was lucky enough to get my hands on a 4GB harddrive,
      a 2MB PCMCIA card and 1MB of internal RAM (which fits into the
      trapdoor underneath the Amiga). All of which were fitted by myself
      onto my beloved Amiga - though I don't use the 2MB PCMCIA card
      much. I also have 2 external disk drives too, which come in very
      handy when copying disks :)

      I now own around 300 Amiga disks, half are Amiga Format demo disks
      whilst the rest are disks containing various tools, files that
      people have left on their disks (mostly text files and images)
      and other stuff.


         Feel free to @{"contact me" link ContactMe} about anything related to the Amiga
         or videogames consoles and I will try to help you.

@node AMOS "ADB`s Games Volume 3 - AMOS History"

      AMOS is a BASIC programming language created by Francois Lionet
      who, at the time, worked for Mandarin.

      AMOS 1.0 was released for the Amiga in the late 80`s / early 90`s
      and was an instant hit, giving people the ability to do just
      about anything.

      This was followed up by AMOS 1.1 and then AMOS 1.2 (the first
      version I got my hands on) which improved on the previous versions
      by fixing bugs and adding new commands.

      In 1991 AMOS 1.3 was released, which also included a special Object
      Modeller program (or OM for short) which gave people the ability
      to create simple polygon models, with simple "textures".
      Naturally AMOS 1.3 included new commands that allowed you to move,
      rotate and alter the colours of the 3D models.

      In 1992 several new versions of AMOS appeared - Easy AMOS (a
      smaller simplified version, with much fewer commands) and AMOS
      Professional.

      AMOS Professional gave people the ability to develop new commands
      by creating new .LIB files (also known as Extensions). One of the
      famous ones is AMCAF, and a worthy addition too.

      AMOS Professional also included a Compiler which allowed people
      to compile their AMOS Professional programs, making them much
      faster and giving people the ability to create games which could
      run straight from the CLI or from Workbench.
      However, it is as far as I know, not possible to compile programs
      that use commands created from new Extensions (such as AMCAF).

      Several official updates followed (along with some unofficial ones)
      fixing bugs in the previous versions and adding yet more commands
      to AMOS Professional, giving it well over 500 commands


      AMOS Software List:

            AMOS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 (aka AMOS - The Creator)
            AMOS Professional (often shortened to AMOS Pro)
            AMOS Professional 1.11
            AMOS Professional 1.12
            AMOS Professional 2.0
            AMOS Professional 2.1
            AMOS Professional 2.3
            AMOS Professional 2.X (the best and last version?)

@endnode

@node AMOSfolder "ADB`s Games Volume 3 - AMOS Folder"


      As with Games Volume 2, I have included a bunch of AMOS Pro
      programs. Most of them are not by me, with the source being
      credited at the start of the program.


      3D_lib_hack.AMOS
      ----------------
      A program I wrote last night and finished this morning!
      This allows me to alter the location that AMOS searches for the
      c3d.lib file. In AMOS - The Creator you have 20 characters to play
      with in the 3d.Lib file, but in AMOS Pro you only have 17
      characters in the AMOSPro_3d.Lib file.
      I strongly suggest you take a careful look at the program if you
      wish to alter the location for AMOS - The Creator as it is
      currently setup for the AMOS Pro version.
      You will need to alter the appropriate strings at the start of the
      file before running it for either version though. Also I highly
      suggest you stick to following the original format:

         :APSystem/c3d.lib

      Therefore I changed it to:

         :3DSource/c3d.Lib

      Thus, when running any 3D stuff, it will search for:

         c3d.Lib
         3DSource/c3d.Lib
         :3DSource/c3d.Lib

      and only give an error message if it can't find the c3d.Lib in
      any of those locations.


      If you do use any 3D in your AMOS programs and you used my program
      to change the search path, please mention me somewhere in your
      program.


      3D_Object_mover.AMOS
      --------------------
      A very simple 3D object mover program. Studying the AMOS code helped
      me create the 3D intro for this disk :)


      ADB's_Games2_intro.AMOS
      -----------------------
      The source code for the typewriter intro found on Games Volume 2.


      AF_Pong2.AMOS
      -------------
      Amiga Formats Pong 2 game.


      Border_Flicker.AMOS
      -------------------
      A lame program thats POKEs a byte in memory causing the border to
      flicker slightly!


      guru.AMOS
      ---------
      I have never used this, since I don't believe in using the Guru
      Meditation message box. Kinda cool though.


      HexDump.AMOS
      ------------
      Yes, you can get a Hex dump in AMOS just like you can in Directory
      Opus :)  Useful if you don't have the latter program.


      mouse_colours.AMOS
      ------------------
      Set and/or change the mouse colours.


      mouse_create.AMOS
      -----------------
      Create a mouse image. Use in conjunction with mouse_colours.AMOS


      using_CD32_controller.AMOS
      --------------------------
      I haven't used this in any of my stuff yet, but I can confirm it
      DOES work! :)


      _animated_rainbow.AMOS
      ----------------------
      Err... an animated rainbow :)


      _Mindwarp.AMOS
      --------------
      Probably not a good idea to run this if you suffer from epileptic
      fits. Look at the screen for about 10 seconds and then look at
      the wall.... woah.. spooky man!


      _number_to_speech.AMOS
      ----------------------
      An interesting program that turns numbers in speech properly ;)


      _Strobe_bg_fx.AMOS
      ------------------
      More visual effects.


      _Vmorph2_AF48b.AMOS
      -------------------
      A cool program from Amiga Format disk 48b.
      This takes an image and merges it with a second image. The program
      is slightly buggy in places and unless you have a fast machine
      it will take 30 mins or so to render all 9 frames (full screen),
      even when compiled :(
      It has various options which I haven't really used.

         ---------------------
         Sourcefile for the AMOS Pro Colours extension. Examine this with
         the other AMOS extension sourcefiles available and you'll have a
         good idea how to put an extension together ;)


         AMOS_bugs
         ---------
         Text file with a list of some of the known AMOS bugs.


         AMOS_Ext_Creation

         A note on how to assemble AMOS Extensions. Other assemblers
         (such as Phx Ass) don't work with normal AMOS Extension source
         code :(


         AMOS_Ext_List
         -------------
         A list of all the known AMOS Extensions for both AMOS - The
         Creator and AMOS Pro. Includes information about all the ones
         I have, plus a full (and hopefully complete) slot list :)


         Console_Notes
