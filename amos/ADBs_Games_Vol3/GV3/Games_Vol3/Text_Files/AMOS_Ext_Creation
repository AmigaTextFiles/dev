                       =============================

      - Use source code from Colours as a starting point.
                           (AMOSPro_Colours.Lib.source)

      - Remember that all commands are in LOWER CASE in source code.

      - To compile LIB:

            - Load source into DevPac (GenAm2)
            - From drop-down menu click "Assemble"
            - Make sure that Save To DISK is highlighted (white)
            - Everything should work as normal.

      - Extension will now load into AMOS under extension number X.
        Extension number 26 does NOT FULLY WORK - it will load in an
        extension, but the commands will NOT BE RECOGNISED!
