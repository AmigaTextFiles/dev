      I have tried the Delta extension, but it occupies the same slot
      as the D-Sam extension (15) which is far more useful.
      Apologies to the author of the Delta extension.
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

      I have tried both the LSerial and LDos (a renamed and much larger
      version of LSerial) extensions and found them to crash my A600 alot.
      I have, currently, no desire to use any modem and/or REXX commands
      thus meaning I don't need them. (Whilst being able to use the
      trackdisk.device is cool, I can live without it for now)
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

      I have tried the Colours extension list. Only useful for those who
      don't have/use the Tools extension as they use the same slot (23).
      Colours extension is for quick colours eg. use in graphics commands
      such as COLOUR or PAPER for instant colours (eg. RED, BLUE etc.):

         Colour 1,Red : Paper Blue : Cls : Print "Hello World!"

                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

      I have tried the EasyLife extension (versions 1.09 and 1.10) which
      both crash AMOS Pro 2.X :( 
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

      I have tried the Ercole extension, which has some nice commands but
      aren't currently any use to me. No demo's with the extension.
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

      I have tried the JDColour Extension. Not very useful for me.
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

*---> I have tried the JD Extension. Lots of commands, but only possible
      useful ones are the printer commands.
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

----> I HAVEN'T tried the JD-Int extension, as it occupies the same slot
      as CRAFT (18).
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

      I have tried the JD-K3 Extension, more intuition style commands.
      No real use for me.
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

*---> I have tried the JD-PRT extension. Useful only for printer-related
      software.
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

      JVP-NoKids, no useful commands for me. Uses slot 25.
      This is a personal extension by Jens Van Petersen that was released
      as "mailware".
                                                - ADB, Dec 2005

      I have tried using the Intuition extension. Crashes when using
      Intuition commands.... as do the other WB based extensions :(
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

      I have tried using the Locale 0.26 extension. Does not have any
      useful commands for me despite having a decent slot (17).
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

      I have tried the Make extension. It has some potentially useful
      memory commands which may be better than using AMOS Banks.
      Occupies same slot as Locale (17).
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

----> Opal extension only works with AMOS - The Creator. Needs recompiling
      for AMOSPro.
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

----> I have tried OS Dev extension. Commands failed with a "not enough
      memory" error, but the REAL problem (thanks to SnoopDOS) is that I
      don't have the bsdsocket.library
                                                - ADB, Nov 2005

      I have tried the PowerBobs extension and must say the demo's do it
      proud. I shall be using this now for all Bob/Sprite operations.
                                                - ADB, Dec 2005

----> I have tried the SLN extension but, whilst it does have some
      potentially useful commands, it requires the Locale.library which
      I currently don't have!
                                                - ADB, Dec 2005

      I have tried the Stars extension demo (V 2.33) from J. G. Doig and
      must say it's a nice extension, with some cool commands. Not fully
      tested at the moment, but the Stars commands appear to be better
      than those found in the AMCAF (?) extension!
                                                - ADB, Dec 2005

*---> I have tried the TFT extension. No really useful commands other
      than the ability to have five Timers running simultaneously or
      separately (eg. Timer Start 1 : Timer Stop 4)
                                                - ADB, Dec 2005
