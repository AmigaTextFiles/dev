   "well... this is a AMOS bug! :) There is (was) a stupid bug in
    the coordinates check routine...


      Limit Bob x,y To x1,y1


   If the x coord is greater than the y1 coord, you'll get an 'illegal
   function call'


   :)) Now fixed... remember that the x and x1 coords will be rounded
   up to the nearest 16-pixel boundary."

   Change the default screen to less than 4 colours and....

      - your sound gets messed up
      - SAM PLAY won't work
      - built in sounds (BELL, BOOM and SHOOT) guru the Amiga
      - SAM LOOP OFF gets switched to SAM LOOP ON after a run

   Today I tried a small code on an Amiga with an Infinitive keyboard
   interface to use with the original keyboard of this machine.
   I tried this:

      Do
      A=0
      If Key State(16) Then Add A,1
      If key State(17) Then Add A,2
      Print A
      Loop

   On a AZERTY keyboard, pressing key A will print 1, B will print 2 and
   pressing A and B togther will print 3. BUt on this keyboard interface
   it is only A or B, no way to detect multi pressed keys [on the same
   scanline, this affects most Amiga's - ADB Sept 2005]

   About the ON BREAK problem... AMOS Pro V1.x is really bugged, and
   the ON BREAK [command] is one of them.
   In AMOS Pro 2 ON BREAK works fine ;)

   When you use..

      Input "text",WHATEVER$

   ... and the text is so long that the textline almost reaches the right
   border of the screen AMOS freezes.

   When using...

      A=0: B=0
      Print A,B
      Add A,2^2
      B=B+2^2
      Print A,B

   ... it should give the answer A=4 and B=4, right?
   Wrong! A=-2147483325 and B=4!

   I tried using my newly-named programme only to recieve the same disk
   error message - which was becoming tiresome now. By trial and error,
   I eventually worked out that the problem was caused by an apparently
   over-sized icon; once that was deleted the program then saved and
   re-loaded properly.
   Fortunately for me I had not removed the sequence of instructions
   from my program which had drawn the icon I had created with the
   "Get Icon C" command.
   No maximum icon size is shown in my AMOS manual, and I was wondering
   whether anyone knew what it was. (Mine was almost the width of a
   hi-res screen, but now I use a packed screen to display the image).
