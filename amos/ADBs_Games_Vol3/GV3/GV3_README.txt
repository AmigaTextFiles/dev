   ADB's Games Volume 3
  **********************

   Thanks for downloading this off of Aminet.org (or wherever you got it
   from). This contains my ABI Encoder and Decoder software, a simple
   3D intro, some useful text files for AMOS users, some useful AMOS code
   and 3 AMOS games (A Day At The Races, Soko Ban and Mouse Impossible),
   which are not made by me.
   As if that wasn't enough, I have included some pictures by Vicky
   Lavington (and friends?) so you can compare the images stored in my
   ABI format (which currently uses no compression!) against the standard
   IFF format.
   Still not enough? Ok, in the "GV3_Extra's" folder you will find a
   folder called "AMOS_Folder" which contains a small AMOS program that
   will help you find the extension number of an extension AND a
   wordsearch game (not by me). I have included a whole bunch of
   wordsearches in the erm... "Wordsearches" folder! :)



   See the "GV3_README" file in the "Games_Vol3" folder for a list of all
   files that should be in the folder (and transfered to a disk named
   "Games_Vol3"). Please remember to install the disk before you transfer
   any files to it, as they can sometimes become corrupt when installing
   the disk (get it to autoboot).


   See the "GV3E_README" file in the "GV3_Extras" folder for a list of
   files that should be in the folder (and transfered to a disk named
   "GV3_Extras".


   Installing a disk
   -----------------
   For those of you that don't know how to install a disk (get it to
   auto-run on startup) simply boot up workbench and do the following:

      - Insert a formatted blank disk into drive df0:

      - Goto "execute command" and type "install df0:"
        (this dumps some code onto track 0 telling your Amiga how to
         read the data on the disk)

      - Now you can copy data to the disk. Make sure you include the
        "s" and "c" folders, otherwise it will not auto-run.


   I hope you download my other games and software which will be uploaded
   to Aminet.net soon.
