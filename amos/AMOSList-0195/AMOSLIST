Hope someone can help:

1. Is there any way to load raw binary data to a screen?
   (perhaps if I could find the start address of an open screen?)

2. Can I use an 8 point font other than the default one with normal
   (not graphic) text operations (and other things like editing
   zones)?

3. Are there any useful tips for ensuring that your program
   runs at a similar speed on different speed Amigas, particularly
   when you're using AMAL?

4. And lastly, I've heard mention of a utility that came with older
   versions of AMOS which converted Sonix music files to a form usable
   by AMOS. Anyone know where I can get it?

I don't think we're going to be hearing from him much anymore.  Sound 
like he got in on the ground floor of a really good business venture 
involving Internet Consulting or something.  My best bet is that 
PlayField! is probably over.  Maybe we should do up an online kind of 
thing, like Amiga Report. 

What do you think Mike (Cox) could something like that fly? Maybe as a 
cull through the AMOS-List postings.

On the other hand, I just started getting the AMOSZines from F1 
Licenseware, and they seem pretty decent.  Anyway, since it has been 9 
months since there was an issue of PlayField!(that is even longer than C= 
has been gone!) I'd say PlayField! is dead. ('Course, I'd love to be 
proven wrong)

I've tried the Font Editor, with no luck. It doesn't seem to do
anything very useful. I did discover that you can change the default
font (topaz.font) by editing AMOS.Library with a hex editor, but it
only loads fonts in memory. The other problem is that a compiled AMOS
program looks for the font specified in AMOS.Library before it does
anything else, so you can't write an AMOS routine which loads the
required font into memory. Someone would need to write a front-end for
your compiled program in C or some other language which loads the font
into memory, then loads the main program, either that, or hack
AMOS.Library to load disk fonts.

The point is, I've proved you can use other 8-point fonts with a
little effort.


Your other answers were very helpful. Thankyou.


Now if someone could shed light on how to use the mysterious Hardcol
and Set HardCol commands, I'd name my first-born after them. :-)

  Hey, I'm perfectly willing to help - you don't need to bribe me. :-)

  As I understand it (I've never actually used the instructions),
Set Hardcol's two parameters work like this: the first controls which
odd-numbered sprites are considered in the collision detection, and the
second is simply a pen number in the background to check.  Normally,
hardware collision detection will only look at even-numbered sprites,
but by setting bits in the first parameter, you can let odd-numbered
sprites be considered also:

	Bit #	Sprite #
	-----	--------
	  0	   1
	  1	   3
	  2	   5
	  3	   7

  The only problem with this is that there's no way to tell whether an
even-numbered sprite or its odd-numbered partner were involved in a
collision, so odd-numbered sprite collisions are of limited use.

  The =Hardcol function returns whether a collision has been detected.
You can then use the =Col function to determine which sprite was
involved in the collision.  If the collision occurred between a sprite
and the background, everything's fine; but if the collision was between
two sprites, you may or may not find out both of the sprite numbers - I
don't know, having never tried.

  Is that explanation enough?  Or have I been completely
incomprehensible? :-)

I was just about to send a stunning reply, and then I couldn't find my

Oh, and whoever it was who wanted that Sonix converter, drop me a line

Why don't you do what I have done for my Clay Pigeon Simulator (where I 
have discovered the erratic divisions visually) by SGNing all the 
variables that are going to be used for division beforehand. I presume 
that you are using vectors in your hydraulics prog and SGNing also 
enables you to maintain vector direction info after squaring and rooting 
etc.

  You have to use the Font_Convert utility (or whatever it's called) to
convert the desired font into the right format.  I don't know whether
it's even possible in AMOS Pro.

  Use the vertical blank interrupt.  In your main program, put "Wait Vbl"
at the end of your main loop, and use a "P" command at the end of a loop
in AMAL..  If your loops are long, there may be a speed decrease on slow
Amigas, but otherwise, your program will be sync'ed to the vertical
blank, which (apart from differences between NTSC and PAL, which you can
detect with the Ntsc function) is always the same speed.

  Nope, sorry.

Yes, it is a known bug in the compiler.

Simplest is to save the icon bank to disk as a seperate file, and load it
at the start of your program. More complex is to change the icon bank to a
sprite bank compile it, then insert instructions to change it back to an
icon bank before use!

To change the banks, you have to rename them (Use easylife Els Bank Name
command, or poke the 8 character new name padded with spaces into address
Start(BK)-8. Also, there is two 2 bits in the bank header that need changing,
but I can't remember their address. Look at the bank header definitions in the
appendix of the AMOSPro manual.

'[...going on how he used to write adventures in the old days, using The Quill and 
GAC]
Anyway, in [...] Amiga Format there were two graphic adventures, Starbase 13 and 
Black Dawn [...]; I would like to know what program these were written in because I 
am a budding adventure writer, but the likes of AMOS are just not dedicated enough

Thanks, but I don't actually use vectors at all.  It is an hydraulic 
Calculation Program for Fire Sprinkler Systems (You use existing water 
pressure to figure out what size of pipe you need to get the correct 
amount of water to the sprinkler head.) there are several programs like 
this for the IBM's and I think there is even one for the Mac, but I have 
yet to see one for Amiga's.  And I figured that since I have my Level III 
in Fire Sprinkler System Design, and I can do them by hand, I could write 
a program that would do them as well, but the answers kept coming out 
wrong, and I couldn't figure out why.  Well, now I know.

You will find many previous months in the same directory and same naming

That's typical.
Not to mention the two excellent high-quality games "Knights"
and "High Octane" that were both No. 1 games of Amiga
User International's coverdisk (and I'm sure I'm forgetting
a few others!).
I sometimes wonder what these magazines would put on their
coverdisks if there were no AMOS PD games around. Maybe
ASCII strategy games? ;-)

Greetings,

	Chris

PS: Of course, there are also some quality PD games written in
C/Assembler, e.g. "Shepherd", "Rockez", "Cybernetix" etc.

Hi, I am a new user of Amos Pro and I hve a  few questions which I hope 
someone can answer. these questions are:

1: I have Amos version 1. Is this the latest version and if not how do I 
obtain an upgrade.
2: what would this upgrade improve in Amos.
3: what are the Amos Turbo Plus Extension and Amos Intuition Expansion. 
How much do they cost and where do you get them.
4: is there an Amos for AGA graphics. Planned?
5:I have the Amos compiler. is there a Smos Pro comiler. If so how much and 
how do I upgrade?
6: Do the makers of Amos of an E-mail address?

Your help in this matter is apppreciated.

I like this idea. 
We each could contribute a program or two.
Things such as a comprehensive bug list and "work arounds"(if any).
Tricks.
etc (your ideas???)

Perhaps one person would act as the "editor", snipping the messages and
articles into a readable format, then posting them to either:
a) the list , or
b) directly to anyone who wants it.

What does every one think?

Hi, I am a new user of Amos Pro and I hve a  few questions which I hope 
someone can answer. these questions are:

1: I have Amos version 1. Is this the latest version and if not how do I 
obtain an upgrade.

AmosPro 2 is the latest version. You can get the update by buying the
compiler.

2: what would this upgrade improve in Amos.
3: what are the Amos Turbo Plus Extension and Amos Intuition Expansion.
 How much do they cost and where do you get them.

I don't know about the Intuition Expansion, but Turbo Plus is an exellent
add on that gives you tile mapping, faster graphics commands and a whole
lot more. Highly recomended. 

4: is there an Amos for AGA graphics. Planned?
NO, not from Europress, but some people here are working on it.

5:I have the Amos compiler. is there a Smos Pro comiler. If so how much
and  how do I upgrade?
Yes, purchase from any mail order place, should be around $30-40 US

6: Do the makers of Amos of an E-mail address?
Even if they did they probably would not answer you.

Your help in this matter is apppreciated.

What little help it was, welcome you are.

Wrong. Sorry Andy, but:
This assumes that you main loop will be compleated within one screen
refresh.
If your main loop takes longer than 1 vbl cycle on an 68000 and less than 1
on a 68+ then there will be a speed increase on the faster machine.
Included in the Amospro sample programs is Dithell's Wonderland. It uses a
loop at the begining of the program. If the loop takes less than a certain
time, it assumes that the machine is an A3000 (fair assumption) and has an
additional wait Vbl in it's main loop to slow it down just that little bit
more.
Check it out.

why the hell is EVERYONE always saying: BUG LIST...  I know there are bugs, 
but I think you have a 'bug' in the brain if that is all you can talk about.

geez!  Stop looking at the *bad* points of the language, and look at the good 
ones!

no wonder so many go to Blitz/C/Asm - you all put them off Amos/AmosPro.

  The Intuition Extension (by me) implements most of the features of AMOS
in Intuition, the Amiga's standard graphical user interface (GUI).  With
the extension, you can create programs that look more professional than
those using the AMOS environment - you can open screens and windows and
use menus, gadgets, and other Intuition features directly from AMOS
without having to call the operating system directly.

  As for obtaining it, I can e-mail you an archive containing a demo of
the extension.  All commands are enabled, but screens and windows do not
actually close, even when you give the Iscreen/Iwindow Close command.  The
registration price is $15, and my address is included (as well as a
registration form) with the demo.

>>4: is there an Amos for AGA graphics. Planned?
>NO, not from Europress, but some people here are working on it.

  That would be the AMOS Development Team, of which I am a part.
Unfortunately, we have not (yet) been able to obtain source code, so work
is progressing rather slowly. :-(

>>6: Do the makers of Amos of an E-mail address?

  They don't, but you can reach the AMOS Development Team at:

  Read carefully what I said above: "If your loops are long, there may be a
speed decrease on slow Amigas".  Granted, I did not say under what specific
circumstances there would be a speed decrease, but I am certainly not
"wrong".  It would have been more appropriate for you to say, "To elaborate,
there will be a speed decrease if your main loop takes longer than one
vertical blank period on a 68000 and takes less than one on a 68020+."  Or
something along those lines.

>If your main loop takes longer than 1 vbl cycle on an 68000 and less than 1
>on a 68+ then there will be a speed increase on the faster machine.

  Same thing - it depends which angle you're coming from.  If you're used to
68000's, then it's a speed increase.  If you're used to an 030/040, it's a
speed decrease.

Roketz is written with BlitzBasic 2, and I think Cybernetix was written 
with Blitz 1.  SkidMarks was written with Blitz 2 and so is RoadKill. 
Valhalla is written in AMOSPro.

You are probably right, but I am not much good at Assembler and can't 
really write whole new extensions or anything.

Plus, if I don't know what the bug is, how can I figure out a workaround 
so that the program will do what I want it to do?

Hi,
 
 
1)
  I have been having problems with Deek, Doke, Peek and Poke. Everything works
fine until I start trying to read back negative numbers which I have previously
Poked or Doked into a Data Bank. I expect this is something to do with sign
extension, so is there a FAST solution to this? Doing a manual bit-test and
sign extension is pitifully slow.
 
I'm afraid that I can't confirm the results, (my Amiga died horribly and the
Bar-Steward Mail Order company haven't bothered to send me my new A4000 yet).
 
 
2)
  Also, does anyone know of an extension or whatever which allows one to
perform a word or long-word search of memory. ie. Search for the first
occurance of a specified word-value between two addresses. I can do a byte
search by using the "hunt" command (if I remember rightly) but I am in
DESPERATE need of a word and long word version.
 
 
3)
  How can I make AmosPro run faster for "simple" screen update situations. I
currently turn everything off - AutoBack, Double Buffer, Auto View, Flash,
Cursor. Is there anything else to turn off or tweak to improve performance that
little bit ?
 
(If I need double buffering I do it manually because then I am in full control
of everything)
 
 
 
Cheers, Nick

Well, to those of you who require seedable random numbers, here is
how you do it, without requiring you to write your own RND function.

Simply use the AMOS RND function, but use a NEGATIVE
number for the RND limit.

Thus:

For A = 1 to 10
  Randomise 42
  For B = 1 to 10
    Print Rnd(100)
  Next B
Next A

will produce 10 sets of different random numbers, thus proving that
RND in this case ignores the reseeding via Randomise.

However:

For A = 1 to 10
  Randomise 42
  For B = 1 to 10
    Print Rnd(-100)
  Next B
Next A

will produce 10 sets of random numbers where each set has the
SAME random numbers in the SAME sequence.

Don`t thank me, thank Europress. They told me this workaround,
about the only bit of help they were regarding AMOS though.......

  Right - AMOS doesn't do automatic sign extension.  The simplest solution is
to just use longwords for everything.

  I'm not sure, but check the EasyLife extension by Paul Hickman.  (Check the
AMOS web page or e-mail ph@doc.ic.ac.uk.)

I'm afraid you'll have to do it manually - you can't poke or doke 
negative numbers.

You could convert your word or longword into a string, and then use the 
hunt command.  For example, to find 452, you'd convert it into two bytes 
(1 and 196 - the way I do it is by doking the word, and then peeking each 
byte), then make a string with those two characters, and do a hunt :

Hunt (Start TO Finish, S$)

Turning flash off makes no difference in speed, although the flashing IS 
very annoying. :)  Apart from that, there's not a lot you can do to speed 
up screen updates, short of installing Turbo.

1: I have Amos version 1. Is this the latest version and if not how do I

6: Do the makers of Amos of an E-mail address?

1. AMOS 1 or AMOS Pro 1?  In either case, no, you don't have the latest
versions.  As to how you get an upgrade, maybe Andy can help you there.

2. If it's pro, it will get rid of about a million annoying bugs.

3. Not sure about turbo, but intuition extension lets you put amos programs
onto workbench so they can be used just like any other application.  (BTW,
Andy, have you received my registration yet?  And where can I get a list of
gadgets to know what ones to put where, and like that?)

4. There is one planned, but it is not out yet (as far as I know.)

5. Yes there is a pro compiler, and it's much better.

6. Well, Andy Church (seen in this group) is one of the developers team that is
fixing Pro.

Bug!  If you alter the number of colours in your default screen (using the

I got the Intuition Extension from Andy Church....I loaded the AMOS Creator
version into the extension list and only some of the commands work without
crashing the machine...for example igadget read(n) where n is the number of
a gadget causes a software failure as do many others.

As for the AMOS Pro version, I couldn't load the extension in at all....this
is AMOS Pro 1.12 off the AF coverdisk I am using and I can't actually load
any other extensions in that I have tried apart from starspro.lib...is it
to do with the size of the .lib file? Is there anything I can change to make
it work?

Any help greatly appreciated,

Well I've made use of the info you gave me and that which Darryl
Lewis posted and I can't get it to detect sprite to background
collisions, no matter what numbers I plug in Set Hardcol. It's got me
stumped. Apparently Darryl rang the distributors of AMOSPro in
Australia and they hadn't been able to get it to work either.

Does anyone who considers themselves an AMOSPro - ahem - Pro want to
try whipping up some example code?

Everything about the command suggests it was a rushed job: brief,
unhelpful description in the manual, no example code in the online
help. Was it even properly implemented?

	Just thought I would post an update... Oh ya I didn't work on MARP
as much as I wanted over the holidays but I will still have a pre-release
soon... I hope.. :)

	Added support for:

		- Icon Banks... 

			Features:

			  - multiple icon banks...
			  - complete set of operations... (proper ADT) 
			  - ** plus the developer routines ** .. these
			    are Icon and IconBank commands that allow
			    developers to be able to use iconbanks without
			    conflicting with the normal set of icons and
			    iconbanks... basically these are the routines
			    that work directly with Icon and IconBank
			    datatype... ie. 

				M_IconBank ib;

				Mx_LoadIconBank(&ib,"myicons");

			    whereas the normal (simple and easy to use)

				M_LoadIconBank(1,"myicons")

			  - will load Amos Icon Banks and Marp Icon Banks...
			    (you just have to call 'LoadIconBank()' )

			  - oh ya you can now select which color you want
			    to mask out... (not just limited to color 0
			    anymore)

			  - I have to create a Marp IconBank because Amos's
			    format is old and out of date... 

			  - Icon's can now have their own paste mode (blitter
			    minterm) and HotSpots...


		Bob/Sprite Banks:

			  - no big deal because they are just IconBanks...

		Bob's/Double Buffering/Rainbow (ie. copper) Commmands:

			  - need a little polishing...


		File Utils:

			  - not all done yet...
			  - added FileSize/FileExists/IsDir/IsFile/ValidPath.. 
			  - want to add things like, assigns/volumes/devices
			    bla bla... 


	I want to realease Marp when it supoports:

		- Iff Ilbm / and Anim 5 
		- Dual Playfield Screen Modes... 
		- mod and sample support
		- zones (possibly polygon zones?)

	of course there is more I need to code for Marp but I belive it 
	would be quite useable after I added the above... 

	I plan on adding:

		- Animated Icon Type
		- Animated/Static Color Fonts
		- Mapping Commands
		- Serial/Parrellel Device Support...
		- Arexx
	

	The Icon Banks took me longer than I expected... it only took
	a couple of hours to reproduce Amos's functionality but it
	it has taken me many days to re-design and make what I feel
	is a very good API for Marp... That I want all the commands
	to adhere to... 

	Talk to ya guys later...

  Yup... I goofed.  What happened is that the extension became slightly too
long for AMOS Creator to handle.  (What also happened is that my beta-testers
didn't beta-test, for the most part...)  As a result, the following
instructions do not work in AMOS Creator.  (I will post workarounds soon.)

Igadget Active
Igadget Inactive
Igadget Read
Igadget Down
Set Ipens
Set Igadget Value
Iwait
Iwait Vbl
Reqtools Here
Iget Icon
All error-related commands

  The good news is that v1.3 of the extension is nearly ready for beta-
testing (BETA-TESTERS: You are going to do something this time, right?), and
it *WILL* fix this problem.

  If all (but one) of the extensions you've tried aren't working, I'd say
it's a problem with AMOS Pro 1.12.  Has anyone else had this problem?  In any
case, you should upgrade to 2.0 if possible.

it would return the same number as it did for the last Rnd() call.  Therefore,
you would not get the same set of random numbers 10 times, you would get 10
sets of numbers, each set containing 10 of the same random number, each set
possibly being composed of a different repeated number.

Finally...

I have (half) written a paint package, but am experiencing several
problems with it.  (surprisingly)

1) Can anyone tell me the formula for a parabola?  Or preferably, can
anyone tell me how to write a curve tool like the one in Deluxe paint?

2) What I want to do, for example, is pick up a circle of colour 0 from
a background of colour 1 as a BOB, like:
       ______
      |  __  |<--colour 1
      | /  \ |
      | \__/<|---colour 0
      |______|

BUT I would like colour 1 to be transparent and NOT colour 0!  I found a
machine code procedure called MAKE_MASK on an AmosPro Productivity disk
and tried to use that in conjunction with NO MASK but without success.

3) I presume there's no way to REDIM an array is there?

4) Or SET BUFFER within a program?  I want to have a list of fonts but,
since I don't have a hard drive, I have hardly any.  When I gave the
program to a friend it said "out of variable space" or something.  Do I
just whack it up high and hope for the best?  If so, is there a way of
telling a maximum number of fonts that the buffer would hold?  I don't
think I can do an interface ActiveList directly from the FONT$() array
can I??

5) Is there a faster version of PLOT and POINT as I'm doing "image
processing" (sort of..) in the program and it's REALLY slow.  I have
seen an image processor I think is in Amos (because you can Ami+A it
into Wbench) and it makes mine look foolish by being so fast - how does
it do it?

--

I think that'll have to do for now, although I'm sure I'll think of some
more soon!  Sorry about this, I hope you don't mind all this crap.  If
you can help with any of it I will be incredibly grateful as many of
these things have plagued me for AGES!!!

	Sorry I can't quote what you said, but I hope you can remember what
you were asking by the way I answer.
	You need to be familiar with AMOS variables and understand how numbers
are stored for your first two problems (BTW, I don't have an answer to your
thrid).  The reason you can't get a negative result with peek is that peek
must return a number between 0 and 255 (inclusinve) and AMOS doesn't deal with
signed bytes (as C might).  The result is converted (I am assuming) to AMOS'
default data type... I think a long integer.  So to automatically use negative
numbers (without having to do the conversion yourself), you'll probably have
to use loke and leek.  If you must have a signed byte, this is how 2's
complement works (2's complement is how computers handle negative numbers
and addition).  The range of a signed number is the same as that of an unsigned
number, but everything beginning from (range+1)/2 becomes n-Range.  For instance
to do a signed byte, simply accept the result of peek, then check to see if it
is greater than or equal to 128.  If so, subtract 256 from it.  (Oops, up there
it should read that it becomes n-Range-1, 255-0=255, 128-255-1=-128)
	I won't explain precicely how the bits are flipped for subtraction and
addition in 2's complement since I doubt you seed that.
	With that in mind, now consider this.  Hunt searches for a string in
memory.  All you have to do to search for more than a byte is convert a number
into it's byte components and put them into a string.  Perhaps the easiest
way to do it is to Loke or Doke the value into a reserved location and then
read the bytes.  OR, probably better (I just didn't think of it first), read
each byte directly from the variable location using Varptr.  If you want, for
instance to search a range of memory for the value 31415926, do the following:
VALUE=31415926
for t=0 to 3
  s$=s$+peek(varptr(VALUE)+t)
next t

After you've done thism you can then hunt for s$ in you desired range of memory.

Hello..

I hope that someone can help me with my 100s of problems in Amos before
I completely lose my mind!

1) I am writing an adventure game.  The main program is about 100k of
Amos Pro code with another 80k (ish) of data containing all the
locations, objects, moving characters etc.  I have an incredibly large
SET BUFFER command at the beginning (although how big unfortunately
escapes me at the moment - sorry!).  During the game it executes a loop
defined with EVERY 25 PROCmove (or something similar) - ie every 1/2
second it runs a procedure to move the mobiles around the game.  Also
there are several lines such as "If Rnd(25000)=1 Then WEATHER" to
control various random events such as the weather etc..

Anyway, when I run it from Amos Pro it works perfectly except that I get
a Guru after several seconds of playing the game.  If I compile it, then
the game does not crash, although in most verbose descriptions it somehow
plonks a great chunk of text in the middle.  The location descriptions are
defined in an array as ROOMS$(LMAX,2) where LMAX is the number of locations.
The first part of it is the brief location and the second the verbose (if
this makes sense...).  However, in any verbose descriptions longer than a few
lines it will insert a random line (or just over) from the LAST verbose
description into it!?

I actually sent this program to Europress who looked at it (apparently)
and send it back saying there was nothing wrong with it (!!??).  This is
really pissing me off as I've been writing this game for about a year
now and, although it is crap, it is quite big!  Oh, this is compiling it
WITHOUT using the SQUASHER (or cruncher or whatever they call it)
because if I do I can't remember what happens, but I know it's worse!!

Perhaps with all these hundreds of things going on (like random loops
and this EVERY thing) it's all getting a bit bogged down with it all or
something.  God knows.  Anyway, my setup is a standard A1200 (with extra
disk drive in case you're interested) and that's it.  It also does not
work on a standard A500 and A4000/30.

Is it me or Amos?  And if it's Amos is there either anything I can do or
has anyone got Francois Lionet's address so I can send him a bomb in the
post?

(Sorry this message was so long, I'll leave another message with the
other problems in case this crappy PC crashes)

I just installed the Turbo Plus extension from the August 94 issue of CU, 
but my problem is that I have no idea of the syntax of most of the 
commands.  The ones I'm most interested in are the Plane commands.  I 
assume that Plane Offset works like Screen Offset, but it doesn't seem to 
do anything.

I ran the following program :

Curs Off : Flash Off : Paper 0 : Cls
For R=100 To 10 Step -5
   Inc A
   Ink A
   Circle 160,100,R
   Paint 160,100
Next
Do
   Add Q,1,1 To 100
   Plane Offset 0,1,Q,0
   Wait Vbl
Loop

And all it did was draw the circles and then sit there...

So, is the format of Plane Offset

Plane Offset screen#,plane#,xoff,yoff

and if so, why didn't it do anything?

(And how do I use the starfield thing, and why doesn't the 
LightSpeed.AMOS demo work?  It just causes a System Failure (8000 0003))

Thanks!

  Pick up the MAKE_MASK procedure from the Procedure Library (the library
WWW page is http://www.gate.net/amos/play/software/procedures/Contents.html)
and see if that helps.

  No, you can't Set Buffer within a program, and you can't use the Font$()
array with the Interface, since Font$() is a function, not an array.

  Probably uses the Turbo (Plus) extension.  There's a demo on AmiNet:
/pub/aminet/dev/amos/turbo1.lha and tscene1.lha.

	yup... here is mine from my paint program... it works identical
  to that of DeluxePaints...  If you want to understand the Math look
  up Bezier Curves... this one use's a 3-point bezeir curve...

Procedure _BEZIER_BRUSH[PX0,PY0,PX1,PY1,PX2,PY2]
'
'  PX0,PY0 --> one end point
'  PX1,PY1 --> the middle point  (normally the current mouse co-ords)
'  PX2,PY2 --> the other end point
'
' this recomputes the middle point so that the curve actually goes 
' through the mouse pointer.... obtained from equating cx#=px1 and 
' cy#=py1 and picking t=0.5 then solving cx,cy for px1,py1.
' 
' Note: the 'DRAW_LINE2[]' procedure just draws a line but uses the
' current brush the user has selected.
'

PX1=2*PX1-PX0/2-PX2/2
PY1=2*PY1-PY0/2-PY2/2

_STEP#=0.1

For T#=0 To 1.0 Step _STEP#

   CX#=PX0*(1-T#)^2+PX1*(2*T#*(1-T#))+PX2*T#*T#
   CY#=PY0*(1-T#)^2+PY1*(2*T#*(1-T#))+PY2*T#*T#

   N#=T#+_STEP#

   CXN#=PX0*(1-N#)^2+PX1*(2*N#*(1-N#))+PX2*N#*N#
   CYN#=PY0*(1-N#)^2+PY1*(2*N#*(1-N#))+PY2*N#*N#

   _DRAW_LINE2[CX#,CY#,CXN#,CYN#]

Next 

'
End Proc

	I use this as the second step in a 2 step process for drawing
   curves in my paint program... first I call my 'Draw Line' command
   then I call 'Draw Bezeir' command with 2 endpoints of the curve
   obtained from the 'Draw Line' and the middle point coming from 
   current mouse co-ords.

	yup I also wrote this for my paint program too!  It is included
  in the Amos Procedure Library on Aminet... ( AMINET:dev/amos/ProbLib3.lha
  .. or really close ) I belive its called MAKE_ICONMASK[]... if you don't
  have ftp access I will send the procedure to ya...

	this one took me about a week to figure out how to code...  I explain
  the algorithm quite well in the procedure... 

	this is in marp also...

	Nope... but you can always you Exec's Alloc routines to dynamicaly
  allocate and free mem...

	I had this exact same problem... I just set a limit to a maxium of
  500 fonts... I wrote a full Font Requester using Pros Interface Language..
  you can have it if you want it... 

	marp will let you call reqtools fontrequester easily to get by
  this problem easily...

	Here you will have to be more specific... if you are doing "real"
  digital image processing (which I only know a little about at the moment
  I have taken a course in Digital Signal Processing (the pre requsite to
  the Imag procressing one) but it is basically 2-d signal processing)...
 
	In the "real" processing... you basically have to convolve a 
  filter with a signal... ie. y = x * h (*=convolution (polynomial 
  multiplication) or Y=X*H (*=normal multiplication) in the frequency
  domain...  I may be taking the 'Image' processing course this semester
  (it depends on whether I can get in) so I may be able to help a bit more
  in a month  :)

You have my sympathy - I've been working on one for over a year.

Somewhere I have the formula for Bezier curves - I'll see if I can dig it

The way I did this was to do it "by hand" reading each point in and 
checking to see if it was BG or FG, sticking it on a spare screen, and 
then grabbing the bob from there.  It took forever, though (see below :).

...if you use banks instaed of arrays, you can make them semi-dynamic 
just by opening and closing them...

It probably uses an external ML function.  Try getting the Turbo Plus 
extension - it has an F Plot command which is faster than the regular 
plot command - I'm not sure if there's an F Point.  The image processing 
thing I wrote in AMOS converted screens to banks so that I could get/plot 
a point with Peek and Poke, which sped things up a bit, although you 
still have the inexorable wait while the image is copied to and from the 
bank...

Perhaps AF did something to AMOS Pro?

You may want to look into a way of doing things that doesn't use EVERY ...

call MOVE.  I had fairly major problems when I was using Every ... Gosub.

But first, remember that making a String GLOBAL is NOT a good idea.  The
String system in Amos isn't perfect, and it is very bad when you Globalise
Strings.  Sharing them is not as bad, but generaly not using Strings in
Procedures is best.  (Use subroutines if they're going to need a lot of
variables from the main program anyway)

Let me present my best wishes for 1995 to the whole Amos-List, and especially 
to Mike [Cox] who has been (and is) so helpful in many cases, including setting 
up this list. I sincerely hope there is some future in the Amiga, but even
if it's not the case, it has been a very nice experience.

Well..  I know I said it, but I'm taking it back.

EME will now *not* allocate Audio channels.  Doing so causes hectic problems 
with the sample interrupts not to mention the MED library.

HOPEFULLY (ahem - a BIG hopefully) I will have the MED/Octamed routines 
internal to the extension sometime soon - I think this is pretty important.

Another idea I had:  Support deliplayers (loaded into banks)..  what do people 
think of that??  Feedback please!

Paul.

I think they did - I can't get the Set Zone instruction to work in the 
version from their coverdisk, but the version I bought works fine.

This program :

Reserve Zone 50
Set Zone 1,10,10 To 60,60

gives an Illegal Function Call error at the Set Zone line with the AF 
version of AMOSPro.

  For those who don't know, DeliPlayers are program modules that go with the
"DeliTracker" music player.  The advantage to using DeliPlayers is that you
can play any music module that you have a DeliPlayer for.

Hi boys,
I know this is not the right list... (do you know a C list?), but I need 
someone which can program in assembler and understand AmosPro very well.
Is anybody out there able to do these things?
I need someony to convert some Amos procedure in Assembler to make them 
much faster. In fact I want to make a graphic interface for POV-Ray for 
the Amiga leaving other users on different plattform wanting to buy an 
Amiga just to use it ;)
I know some geometry to start working. I have also done a "simple" 
program to build Bezier curves to use in POV-Ray with a simple 3D rotating  
session, but it is quite slow. 16 points and relative wires are updated 
no more than 5-6 times on my A1200. Think about a scene where there are 
more than 100 lines and points and all will freeze!
There is no way to use the math copro in AMOS?

So I need someone to translate my AMOSPro routine in Assembler and then 
he must tell me how to call the soubroutine from AMOS.
If he knows a little of mathematics and geometry (matricial) would be very 
appreciated.

			NOTE: NO MONEY!!!!!

I don't want to make money after a free! (Which is also very good!).

Just what I was looking for on my trial subscription to the Internet!

I enjoy using Amos Pro for creating games of logic, such as poker, 
solitaire, etc.

An immediate question: I get an error message when I try to run an AMOS 
program which I have saved to a floppy disc. It refuses to go any 
further, saying it cannot locate a certain library. I followed the AMOS 
directions for creating an AMOS floppy, but to no avail. Any ideas?

Thanx, and I look forward to joining the gang.   Andy Simpson

Would it really add any function or just be something good for advertising?
I am not familiar with the deliplayers but if it adds to the functionality,
then do it.

Hello!

I have programmed a protein (wire-frame) viewing program
and I have experienced the same speed problems as you have.
After having optimized the code, I have started to translate
some routines in Assembler. Unfortunately, I was quite
disappointed at the speed-increase. Excepted a simple
Bubblesort routine which I use for a Z-sort and which
ran about 40 times faster, the rest did not even run
twice as fast as before. I'm not an Assembler expert, but
I tried to use registers and keep the data in the cache. I
don't believe that a good Assembler programmer would make it
run much faster.

Anyway, as the program rotates about 550 lines 5 times per
second on my A4000/040 and it did maybe 300 lines before
I used my Assembler routines, I guess that you could speed
up your actual program a lot by simply optimizing it!
(An A1200 can't be 15-20 times slower than a A4000, can it?)

First, use only interger arithmetics by multiplying all coordinates
by 2^x with x being at least 10 (depends on the accuracy needed).
Before displaying it on the screen you will have to divide it again by 
this number, but fortunately both, multiplication and division can
be done with the shift operators of AmosPro (Asr.l and Asl.l, I think.
I have Amos Creator where they don't exist.)
Do also use the commands Add and Sub where possible. They are all
translated pretty much 1:1 in Assembler, at least I guess so.

Secondly, use the TurboLib extension! The F_draw command is about
twice as fast as the AMOS command which makes an enormous speed
increase (in the current version of my program, 50% of the time
is consumed in the drawing routine!). You can also use the fast
command to clear the bitplanes.

I have never tested Amos3D, but maybe this could also be of some
help? Anyone?

Good luck,

	Chris

Does anyone know if this feature is automatically used in the bob routines

IMO adding DeliPlayer support would be overkill.
AmosPro already has AREXX support, so you can run DeliTracker on the 
background and control it from AmosPro (I think, haven't ever tried it).

hehe.. thanks for explaining Andy..  If anyone wants to look at delitracker,
its on aminet under mus/play

Anyone have ANY suggestions at as as to what they would like to see in

  Hmm... hadn't thought of that...

  Actually, now that you mention it, that fix is probably oriented specifically
for the registered version rather than the demo version.  Sorry, everyone!
I'll try to get together a demo-version patch tonight.

  No, you can't make it permanent.  The reason is that I have to re-use some
memory that the extension needs to start up (but doesn't need after that).

It isn't, and you can. However, I believe the procedure in question uses
the squash command of the AMOS Creator compiler extension, so that will be
needed to run programs which use the feature. I don't know if the AMOSPro
compiler extension also has this feature, but even if it does, your programs
that use it will not run on anyone's AMOSPro system who does not have the
compiler (Although your compiled programs will work OK).

I bought Eme ver 4.5b and thought it was great. 

In answering you question, I would like to see a function which allows 
the taking of noise levels from each of the 2 channels from a stereo 
sampler. This info would only need to be 2 numbers between 0 and 9, ie 
the volume of the noise being monitored at that point on each channel.

All you need have is a function call like eg :-

- var_name = ch_level_left
 
and var_name returned with a value between 0 and 9.

This would allow you to trigger sequences by real world noise events. 
eg burglar alarm - any sustained level of noise above the ave sound level 
(breaking windows, footsteps etc) can trigger an event ie an alarm.

Or you could use it to provide trippy visuals triggered in time to the 
beat of some music.

If this is possible, I will be one of the fisrt to buy it !!!

That may be what the manual says (I can`t remember, and it`s 2 miles
away from here), but believe me, using a -ve number DOES work, check
out my "Midwinter" map generator (available on Aminet and AMOS Website) for 
proof. It was this program that prompted me to ask Europress what the

Hi all, I recently got the amospd cd, which by the way had a lot of wonderful
things on it,  I have only one problem, well acutally more than one.

First off, I noticed that most if not all of the programs are ment for the 
pal format.  I have tried to boot my NTSC machine into pal but with little 
luck.  I know there is a way to change the program in the sorce code to ntsc,
but I'm not sure how to do this.  Does anyone know how.  I appreciate the help.

The cd mentions that also included are the files in DMS format that can be 
unpacked directley to disk, I haven't been able to find this.

One more in the catalog on the cd it is divided into 2 sections PD and 
Licencewere.  Are the files in the licenceware included on the cd, this too I 
can not find.

Well thanks for all your help.  Is the Amos WWW up and running yet?

Pam

But then you wouldn't be able to do neat things like finding out which 
sample is playing where, etc., as AREXX just isn't fast enough (unless 
you've got that rather neat AREXX compiler), and AMOSPro's AREXX support 
is a bit crappy anyway.  I say go for the DeliPlayer support - it may 
even make the extension smaller, as all the formats will be external.  
(If you DO add DeliPlayer support, I'll definitely pay some money for 
EME!)

Hallo guys!
I have a problem, a great problem. When i try to compile an AMOS program that
use extensions like Easylife,Turbo,Stars,ecc..compiler tells me that       
extensions aren't loaded. Changing the AMOSPro_Interpreter_Config is not a
good idea (or i think so) because compiler always tells me the same things.
Please, some of you can help me?
If you want, you can find a demo of my Pattern Generator V1.1 on Aminet,
in gfx/fract.I used some old procedures and my own procedures to make this
program. I'm happy about my work but every type of critic and advertise is 
well accepted.

Hallo.
Luca

Hi!

I was reading the amos list and I noticed the intuition extension. I 
am a Amos Pro programmer and I thought that I would use the intuition 
extension in my progs. The problem is that, I've never seen it in Finland 
and I cannot use ftp to get it from outside my country because of the 
server, could some one send me or tell me where I can get the intuition 
extension DEMO version. Not the registered one.

Part of the AMOS Pro Compiler shell kind of hard codes the highest number
of an extension.  If you change it to something else, it will fix the
problem.  Unfortunately, I can not recall where the change is so I may need
to get back to you.

Of course, if this is not the cause of the problem, I do not know the
answer.  :(

It is an awesome source of AMOS items, isn't it?

Well, the programs are probably using screen coordinates that only PAL
screens will show so you can't easily change the program (more than likely)
so it will fit NTSC.  If you have an AGA machine you can always boot into a
PAL screen.  If not, check AmiNet for programs that will switch between the
2 formats.

I have not looked for the DMS program as I have it on my hard disk.  If you
can not find it, let me know and I will send the shareware version.

In the catalog, it will give the disks names, like:  APD020.  If it is
something other than APDXXX then it will not be on the CD.

It is (still under work) at the http listed below in my sig.

What type of system are u using?  I have an A1200 with a Zappo CD ROM

Subject: AMOS Upgrade?
Status: RO
X-Status: 

I am running AMOS Creator on my Amiga 3000.  One thing I notice is that the
screen display seems to be a bit flaky...like its position is skewed to the
left and I can't center it via any software control or prefernces that I
can find (I'm running a 1950 monitor and NTSC pref).

How do I go about upgrading to AMOS Pro?

Finally,  I have a MegaloSound sampler and have tried to play samples using
AMOS, but with limited success.  If I use the soundbank creator software,
it will only handle small samples (since it puts the sample data into a
string that is limited to a maximum of 64k in length) and it will not
reliably allow me to store multiple short samples in one bank (it bombs if
I try).  I had tried to break my long samples into shorter ones, fill a
bank with them, and then run a loop to play them end to end to achieve a
long sample equivalent but I can't convert any thing except about 1 sec
samples.  I would relly like to play RAW samples, as this would allow me to
play long samples, limited in length only by RAM (?) but I can't get it to
play anything at all.  Any quidance would be appreciated.

I also wrote a fairly long piece of code (which I fortunately hasd backed
up to a different name).  Everything was fine.  Then, suddenly when I went
to edit the code, the source loaded, and when I tried to run or edit it,
the entire listsing vanishes and I get a strnage mmessage (which I will
replicate ande post when I get a chance).  Any similar experiences?

Is my overriding soultion to Upgrade to AMOS Pro?

Hey Mike,

Just where did you get that CD for only $16.95 if you say you saw it on

  Hey everybody!

  This is my first day on the list.  

  This is so cool.

  In my "professional" opinion (who asked?)
  Amos Pro combined with the Amiga hardware and OS is currently 
  the best programming environment on EARTH!!!!  

  That is why THEY 
      (the forces that be.....the establishment....conventional wisdom) 
  are intent on the elimination of the AMIGA.
 
  It is way too powerful for mere hobbyists!

  Resist mediocrity.  Don't give up on the Amiga.
  
  ******* combustion extinguished *********

  I have one question for anyone who can answer.  PLEASE!
 
  Is there a patch/extension (or whatever) which allows the reading of a mouse
  from the other port?  Perhaps a call like USE_MOUSE_PORT(1) to 
  set up the condition, and a call like USE_MOUSE_PORT(0) to set the system
  back to default.  

  I am not asking for both mice to be read simultaneously
  (although that capability would be very nice for other applications), 
  just the ability to read EITHER mouse 0 or mouse 1.  

  DOES THAT FUNCTIONALITY EXIST in AMOS?  Or is it a major oversight??
  It would make many programs much nicer.  And the AMIGA hardware supports it.

  Thanks.

  You have to buy it from someplace that sells it.

  Sounds like Sam Raw and AMOS Pro's double buffered sounds are your
solution here.

  No - sounds like another weird editor bug.  Both the Creator and Pro
editors have bugs, although (IMO) the Pro editor is much nicer and easier
to use.

>Is my overriding soultion to Upgrade to AMOS Pro?

  I'd say so.

That's the great place I bought it from.  Just had to tell them I was on

You have to use Plane Update command to refresh display.
I.e 

Do
   Wait Vbl
   Plane Offset screen,plane,x,y
   Plane Update screen
Loop

I'm not sure, but I think you have to clear previous plane offset values
before setting new plane offsets. You can achieve this by putting a
Plane Offset screen,plane,-1,-1 command after the Wait Vbl...

Umm... I guess you are using the WB version of the Pro Compiler, am I right?
I have found the same problem, but only when using the WB compiler.
If anything else fails use the APCMP directly from cli/shell (check out
compiler manual) or compile straight in the amos pro editor.

	When you try to play a RAW sample are you sure you're putting it 
in memory reserved specifically as Chip memory.  I don't think you can play a
sample from Fast RAM.

Subject: HyperText and Other Problems..
Lines: 38
X-Mailer: PCElm 3.1 (1.6 DIS)

Okay, next ones ...

2) I have also written a game with a large hypertext driven help system.
Unfortunately, I just cannot get the Interface HyperText commands to
work properly.  It's VERY VERY near to working except that occasionally
(meaning usually almost immediately, but sometimes it lasts a page or
two) the display corrupts and the computer Gurus.  I think at one point
I got the whole thing to work except that when you clicked the button
marked EXIT it not only exited the help system, but also Gurued (gurud?
erm..  did a guru).  In the end I had to rewrite the hypertext things so
that it could be used with the Read Text command - but this is
completely crap as I can't customise it at all.  I want proper buttons
like HISTORY, PREVIOUS PAGE, CONTENTS, EXIT etc..

3) When using Interface (again), how do I change the colour of the
scrollbars?  In the manual I can find no reference for how to do this,
but in the help docs on the disk there was a mention of a command that
would do this, but I couldn't get it to work.  It was something like
SetScrollbars (ie SS) or similar..

4) Have the InactiveLists actually been written in Interface or am I a
complete idiot (or both)?  I just can't get it to work!

5) I haven't actually got any extensions at all (except for the Amos Pro
compiler).  I downloaded Turbo something from the internet but couldn't
get it to work.  In fact it crashed Amos every time I loaded it and I
had to get a text editor out to edit the configuration!!  Am I doing
something incredibly stupid?  Also, what's this intuition extension?  It
sounds intriguing!  Is it a genuine "write Amos program with incredible
ease which can pop up on a Workbench screen" or is it one of those crap
"make your Amos programs look exactly the same as all the other boring
looking programs ever written using intuition"?  If it's the former,
please tell me more!  Are there any other decent (preferably public
domain or cheap) extensions?  Sorry about this, I'm sure you've already
been through all this crap but I've only just subscribed!

  Mike, 

   Thanks again for the response.  I might be mistaken but it appears
 that the code fragment is intended to only return the status of the
 mouse buttons.

   So I am still asking for a solution to the problem.
 |  Is there a patch/extension (or whatever) which allows the reading of
 |  a mouse connected to the other port??  Perhaps a function call like 
 |  USE_MOUSE_PORT(1) to set up the condition, and a call like 
 |  USE_MOUSE_PORT(0) to reset the system back to default.  


   AMOS is so powerful because it does so much for us that it allows 
 programming at a high level of abstraction.  It has already setup its 
 internal variables for the mouse pointer movement tracking and all 
 an AMOS programmer has to do is read those variables.  C is nice because
 you can get to those registers if you have the knowledge, but if you don't
 have that machine specific information, you are frustrated.  I imagine a few
 strategic pokes (I'm sure different for each version of the OS) would do 
 the trick.

Well, from a speed point of view I had planned a partial re-write in 
assembler, and now that I`ve got Devpac3 that may just happen...
(of course this is of little interest to diehard AMOS coders).
Note that compared to the recursive map generator code provided
in an Amiga Shopper (I think) from last year, my code is faster at
generating 128*128 maps. I`ve got a HighSpeed Pascal version
of the routines as well, which is rather fast too.......

Using the routines would involve coming up with a program that
required a landscape to be generated automatically, so things
like Vista and Midwinter are in there.

I had intended (many moons ago) to write an AMOS version of
Vista, which is why I developed the map creation routines, but
like so many of my programming projects it fell by the wayside
as I became interested in something else. Apart from the
assembler recoding I probably won`t do anything else with
the routines myself.

   There is a 'Screen Display' command in AMOS Pro that will shift the 
 addressed screen's position like a preferences shift would.  Maybe AMOS
 the creator also has this command?  I don't know.


> How do I go about upgrading to AMOS Pro?

   If you have a source for British magazines, hurry down and scarf up the 
 January 1995 issue of AMIGA FORMAT which presents us with an almost full 
 version on one of its coverdisks.  No manual and tutorial system, but it
 allegedly is the full PRO language implementation, including the on line
 help and accessories.  I haven't decompressed it to see if there are
 problems with it, since I also own the commercial release.  But you know 
 how crappy those coverdisk decompression routines can be on 1.3 WB based
 systems.   


  BTW, AF is also running an AMOS Pro programming contest. 
  Details in January 1995 issue.
  Deadline May 1, 1995
  1st prize = 1000 lbs. 
  Very tempting.

	Okay my brain is starting to bleed because I can't make up my 
mind on a consistent interface for MARP so I thought I would ask what
you blokes thought would be best....


	1. Do you like how with Amos you have to 'Set' which object
	   you want the operations to be applied to ?

		Example:

			Screen 1 : Circle 10,10,10 : Screen 0

	2. Or would rather wnat to specify the object along with the
	   operation ?

		Example:

			Circle 1,10,10,10

	I realise that their are advantages and disadvantages to both and
	this is what is causing my brain problems!

	Because i want MARP to be consistent it has to be either 1 or 2...
	
	This mess is applicable to every bank type Amos has... because in
	MARP you can always have multiple banks... so this goes for icons,
	samples,mods,amims,... etc.

	For screens I prefer method '1' but for Icons I prefer method '2'..
	so I can't make up my mind.... I need some input...


	Here is how Icons would work under method 1:


		M_LoadIconBank(0,"myicons.abk");

		M_SetIconBank(0); 

		printf("Number Icons in bank: %d\n",M_IconBankLength());

		M_SetIcon(10);

		printf("Icon 10 is %d pixels wide.\n",M_IconWidth());

		M_PasteIcon(x,y); /* ie. paste Icon 10 */


	Under Method 2:
		
		M_LoadIconBank(0,"myicons.abk");

		printf("Number Icons in bank: %d\n",M_IconBankLength(0));

		printf("Icon 10 is %d pixels wide\n",M_IconWidth(0,10));

		M_PasteIcon(0,10,x,y); /* Paste Icon 10 from IconBank 0 */


	Thanks for any input... 

								mike

  The Interface system in Pro is not well written.  (Sort of like the rest
of AMOS.)  If you can't get something to work right, chances are it's
because the function wasn't really written.

  I think that version of the Turbo extension doesn't work with Pro.

  Does that answer your question? :)

  Yes, the Intuition Extension does let you create true Intuition programs
just as easily as you create any normal AMOS program.  If you're interested
in a demo version, I can mail it to you.

  Ask Mike Cox for a copy of the FAQ - it has a list of all extensions
available for AMOS.  (Mike, how recent is that list?)

Hi!

I run into a problem when coding my next game, hope somebody can help
me with this...

Now, this is a piece of code from my game:

Sam Loop On
Sam Play 1,1 
Sam Loop Off
Sam Play 2,2

I want to play a humming sound continuously on channel 1 and some
other samples like explosions and laser zaps on other channels.
But with the previous example the Sam Loop Off commands stops looping, so I 
only hear the humming sample once and then an explosion... Then if I
remove it the explosion sample will be played continuously.

Ideas? Anybody?
How about EME, does it support sample looping?

Hi,
 
  I have just had a cunning plan ...
 
  Nope, it does not invlove turnips, but an Amos-Pro error/bug list. How about
producing a regularly updated list of all current Amos-Pro bugs, with useful
information such as work-arounds or in which version of Amos-Pro the bug is
fixed (who am I kidding?) I would find this extremely useful, and so doubltess
others would too (it would save my hair anyway).

I wonder if anyone could help me?
My HD recently went down irretrievably and apart from rescuing original 
work, I have now to reinstall everything from scratch on my new setup - 
System: & HD0: partitions - the thing is the Amos Pro Installer doesn't 
seem to work properly and I would like to know what Assigns etc it sets 
up and where APSystem stuff should go - at the moment everything is on 
HD0:Amos_Pro/ - is it right that the APsystem config files all have to go in 
System:s/ ? I keep getting errors referring to system files and APSystem 
- at present APSystem and its files are on HD0: only. Any ideas would be 
appreciated. I think that I have to stick with the System: and HD0: set 
up due to the errors on my HD preventing me from simply reformatting my 
original single work/system partition.

Thanks in advance.

Richard

Hello everybody,

I'm new on this amos mailing list and had some questions
about amos.

I am learning to code some nice demos in amos pro and
therefore i bought the amospd-cd. (realy great!!)

thing is  that i found some demos wich only showed

procedure s
proc s

and that was it..

when i tried to open the procedure it didn't work.

up to now i hadn't had any luck with this.

does anybody know how to show the whole source of the demo??

it would help me a lot.

-->  are there amos-demo coders out there who would like to trade sources??
     (i aint got much yet but working on it).
      then please contact me by email!!

  I'd like to know more about this too... it sounds suspiciously like my own.

The latest copy of Amiga Computing (Feb95) has a review of IntOS - it 
seems to have gone down well but it is NOT an extension but a set of 
procedures that you call - it seemed to me to make progs cumbersome 
compared to the Intuition Extension way of doing things - anyone care to 
comment? are there advantages to using Procs not Extension commands?

I guess it depends on what you're making MARP for. If it is 
intended to be a pure AMOS replacement (with maybe an Amos2C 
translator thrown in), I guess you would have to stick to the way 
Amos does it (which I believe is method 1 for screens and 2 for 
icons). However, if it is the ease of use of Amos you're after, you 
might as well go for the most consistent choice (might be the same 
one, I don't know). Maybe you could find out if there's any 
(design) filosofy behind the way Francois did it.

  The only files that go in S: are AMOSPro_Interpreter_Config and
AMOSPro_Compiler_Config.  All the files in the APSystem directory should be
in an APSystem directory under AMOS_Pro/ (your AMOS Pro directory).  You
should assign AMOSPro_System: to the AMOS Pro directory.  You can also copy
the other disks to the Pro directory and assign the disk names to that
directory also (for example, copy the Accessories disk to AMOSPro_System:
and assign AMOSPro_Accessories: to that directory).

I didn't see the last number of Amiga Computing but i know that InTOS is an
extension! It includes 120 new commands and no procedures...I think there are 
no advantages using procs and not extension...

	I think the solution will involve removing the Sam Loop Off statement
and finding a way to stop other sound effects.  Isn't there a command to stop
a channel from playing or something, or silence it?  turn the volume of the
chanel down maybe?  Play a silent sample on the channel?  Otherwise perhaps
you'll just have to not use Sam Loop and manually play it at regular intervals.

The procedures are locked.  I am sure there is a way to unloack them.
Anyone know how?  I also have the CD and would like to look at as much code

  If you want to draw 100 random circles using the AMOS methodlogy,
  the screen 1 command is only executed once.

                 screen 1 
                 for i= 1 to 100
                  circle rnd(319),rnd(199),rnd(15)
                 next i
                 screen 0

 The other way is too inflexible and can lead to inefficient behaviour,
 and probably will interfere with other programming techniques.

	I haven't bought the AMOSPD CD, but I think I know what's going on here.
I think some of the demos must not have been entirely possible in AMOS and
therefore have had parts done in other languages (assembly) for speed.  These
assembly routines can be compiled and included in the program as a procedure
that cannot be opened (because there are no equivalent AMOS commands to display
in place of the machine code instructions which now occupy that space).  It's
possible that these procedures are locked or something, but I doubt that
because the purpose of the CD should be to expose programming techniques to
others to help out... not hide them.
	Also, if you're interested in AMOS code, let me re-post my WWW page
which has many AMOS programs in ASCII format:
http://www.cs.hope.edu/~marty/
This will bring up an index from which you can select any of my pages including
my AMOS Programs page.  Oh, and if you don't have WWW access, let me know and
I can send you code directly.  If you need a list of what's available, I can
send you the page that links to all the programs in text format -- it includes
summaries of each program.
	The above offer goes for anybody else on the list as well.  If there
are enough requests, I can re-post the list of available programs.

For MARP, I like method 2, including the screen in the call. 
Also re: MARP, you might want to check out Gamesmith Dev. System
as it implements object oriented bobs and so on, along with screen 
functions and sound etc. That is what I am using now. If you canb get 
MARP to a point where it can be used as linker libs with C or Assembler
to develop games easily (like in AMOS but better ;-) ) then I see a market
for you to sell it commercially. GDS sells for $99 through Oregon Research
and I have no problem paying for a system that is going to make my 
programming much more effecient. I would especially like to be able to 
use the Turbo+ map editor and commands in my C code. That would be
great. Aren't the AMOS extensions written in Assembly, so could I use the
commands in there from C? How about MARP? If you want any ideas,
let me know, there are tons of game development tools that I want!

Hi, 

I'm new on this list, so I thought I'd just ask a small question. If you 
have an extension (In my case the turbo extension), when you compile a 
program that includes commands from the extension will that include the 
whole extension library or whatever it's called, therefore making your 
program bigger?

Thanks,
Ben Crowl

  I'm not sure about the Creator compiler (it may do that), but the Pro
compiler will only include routines that are actually used by the program.
So yes, it will increase the size of the program, but only as much as
necessary.

  OK, here are the bugfixes for the Creator version of the extension.
Include the appropriate procedure in each program that uses the extension,
and call it as the first instruction of the program.  (If your program
uses bank 7 for something else, choose a different, unused bank number to
replace the Reserve, Loke, Call, and Erase statements.)  Sorry for all the
trouble.

Hi guys,
I'm working on a little AMOS Pro Project. It's a simple image-pocessing program
with only few features (at the moment) like palette's effects, flipping, filters
and something more... I would like to implement a routine to read GIF files.
Someone of you can help me?

This can only be done in AMOS Pro.  All, or almost all, of the programs on
the CD are for AMOS Creator.

True, but some authors prefer to keep their work secret.

Well, from a speed point of view I had planned a partial re-write in 
assembler, and now that I`ve got Devpac3 that may just happen...
(of course this is of little interest to diehard AMOS coders).
Note that compared to the recursive map generator code provided
in an Amiga Shopper (I think) from last year, my code is faster at
generating 128*128 maps. I`ve got a HighSpeed Pascal version
of the routines as well, which is rather fast too.......

Using the routines would involve coming up with a program that
required a landscape to be generated automatically, so things
like Vista and Midwinter are in there.

I had intended (many moons ago) to write an AMOS version of
Vista, which is why I developed the map creation routines, but
like so many of my programming projects it fell by the wayside
as I became interested in something else. Apart from the
assembler recoding I probably won`t do anything else with
the routines myself.

I will look.  I don't think I'll be able to find a Hardcol function without
viewing every program on there, so don't hold your breath!  ;)

   There is a 'Screen Display' command in AMOS Pro that will shift the 
 addressed screen's position like a preferences shift would.  Maybe AMOS
 the creator also has this command?  I don't know.


> How do I go about upgrading to AMOS Pro?

   If you have a source for British magazines, hurry down and scarf up the 
 January 1995 issue of AMIGA FORMAT which presents us with an almost full 
 version on one of its coverdisks.  No manual and tutorial system, but it
 allegedly is the full PRO language implementation, including the on line
 help and accessories.  I haven't decompressed it to see if there are
 problems with it, since I also own the commercial release.  But you know 
 how crappy those coverdisk decompression routines can be on 1.3 WB based
 systems.   


  BTW, AF is also running an AMOS Pro programming contest. 
  Details in January 1995 issue.
  Deadline May 1, 1995
  1st prize = 1000 lbs. 
  Very tempting.

I'd say upgrading to APro would be your solution.

I use the DSS8 sampler and have played samples over 500k that have been put
into amos sample banks.

  I've got some C source for GIF reading routines - if someone wants to
translate these to AMOS (I haven't the time), let me know.

Hey!  Does anyone else have the problem of "out of memory" if they try to
squash a program in the APro compiler?

It compiles fine, but if I squash the program with the compiler after
compiling (one of the compiler options) it won't load.

Anyone else have this problem?

	This is one of the Advantages!  But you could a piece of code where
   this is just a disadvantage:

		FOR icon=0 to 100
		    SetIcon(0)
		    Paste Icon x,y
		NEXT

		' now you current icon is 100

	MARP is a library of C functions that you can link your C programs
  to... why?  So that you can use the power of C with what I think is the
  power of Amos (easy and powerful gfx/snd... basically you don't have to
  go through the RKM's... and figure out all the Amiga specifics)

	MARP will come with multiple libraries... 
	
		1.  The 'in-development' library.. this will be slow
		    but safe.. so if you screw up something you will
		    get a Requester explaining the error and no GURU.

		2.  This will be the heh my code works library.. it will
		    be faster than #1 because it won't do any error
                    checking... so you could be making an appointment
		    with the guru...

		3.  This will be the library with just about every command
                    a macro for super speed at the expense of some code
                    size because you will be 'inlining' a lot of stuff... 

	MARP has Amigaguide help system much like that of SAS/C.. Oh ya if
   you didn't figure out already you will need a C compilier and understand
   C.  But MARP has 2 layers:

		1. ToolKit Commands

		   o These are basically how Amos works now... Very easy..
		     Bascially no pointers... example:

				M_Pixel x,y;

				M_LoadIconBank(0,"icons.abk");

				M_PasteIcon(0,10,x,y);

		2. Developer Commands

		   o These are mainly for developers that want to eXtend
		     MARP by writing eXtensions... this give you access
                     to the guts of MARP... example:

			M_Pixel    x,y;
			M_IconBank ibank; 

			Mx_LoadIconBank(&ibank,"myicons",0);

			Mx_PasteIcon(&ibank,10,x,y,M_BLIT_NORMAL);
 
		   o Now if someone wanted to write an eXtension they
		     could do it better because the programmers model
		     of MARP would never have to change.. ie. they
                     would never have to sacrifice a slot in a bank.
		
		   o Also commands are provided to inteface between the
		     two... so if the programmer wanted to explicity
		     tell an extension to use a certain bank they could. 

	These 2 layers would help people who aren't comfortable with using
   pointers convert from Amos->C easier if they wanted too... plus even
   if you pointers don't bug you it will just be easier and safer to use
    the toolkit routines most of the time... :)


	MARP Curently supports:

		o Screens     (includes Double Buff/Public Screens)
		o General Gfx (ie. lines/boxes/circles/...)
		o Requesters  ( font/screen/palette/file/custom)
		o Icons       (much more complete than Amos)
		o Files       (ie. Size/Exists/IsDir/... )
		o Input       (mouse/joystick/analouge joy)
		o Copper      (ie. Rainbow..)
		o Samples     (not fully done)
		o Med Mods
		o Bobs	      (not fully done)

	I will release MARP once I add:

		o IFF Picture Support
		o IFF Anim Support
		o Color/Anim Font (ala Ctext) 
		o Easy User Interrupts
		o Make up some Examples! 
		

	Of course MARP will not be done with just this... but I feel that
        it would be useful once I add this stuff... but I plan to work on
        MARP till March'95. Then start using it!

	Oh ya... MARP is also being developed on the IBM right now! 

					I hope this helps...

Sounds like the program has been compiled, in which case you can't access 
the source code (as far as I know).

Another solution (albeit convoluted) is to make a tracker in Soundtracker 
etc that plays the continuous sound in channel 1 (ie loop the sample in 
the tracker program).  Then simply play the tracker in your game, whilst 
making explosion sounds etc in the other channels.  ;]

I have lots of extension docs as .guide files but IMO the
AmosPro's online help system is quicker to use.

How does the amospro help system work? Does it scan the AmosPro
directories for help files on startup or do I have to add new help
files in some config file somehow?
Is the help file format described somewhere?

Thanks in advance.

Ok, this message I requested a receipt, so maybe I'll get your response.  ;-)

Well, I checked around at this end and the intuition extension is nowhere to be
seen.  Thanks for the prompt answer about the patch, though.

Maybe you should just regular mail me the extension if my end is going to
continue losing the file you send.

Could you try it one more time?  If I don't get it over the internet by the
21st, I'll let you know and you can just mail it regular (hope it makes it
through the customs without holdup).

Well met and godspeed,

Petri,

As I think I've posted in the past (this should really be included in a
FAQ or bug list!):

The Sam Loop commands are bugged (what isn't? ;).  Sam Loop Off is the only
one that works with a Bit Pattern for the voices.

Now your problem is a bit different.  You set certian CHANNELS to looping
and then play anything on them at anytime and they'll loop, what your
example does is turn Looping ON for all channels, play a sample, then turn
all Looping OFF so nothing loops.

If you want channel 2 and ONLY channel 2 to loop constantly, do this:

Sam Loop On
Sam Loop Off %1011

Sam Play x,%100

That turns on all looping, then shuts it off for channels 0, 1, and 3.
Play samples on channel 2 and they'll always loop.

	I think the solution will involve removing the Sam Loop Off statement
and finding a way to stop other sound effects.  Isn't there a command to stop
a channel from playing or something, or silence it?  turn the volume of the
chanel down maybe?  Play a silent sample on the channel?  Otherwise perhaps
you'll just have to not use Sam Loop and manually play it at regular intervals.

Just a quick note to say I've finally got around to uploading my game
MegaBlock2 to Aminet.

It's really version 3 of the Super Blockout game that comes with
AMOS Pro, and has loads features, including 1 or 2 players, different
shaped blocks, bonus blocks & bombs.

Oh, and a cat called Smartie.

It's sharware, and if you register, I'll send you the complete
source code & another game. (5UKP or approx equivelent - I'll take
any currency :) )

Anyway, it's in game/think and it's about 325K if you're interested.

These procedures have been 'locked' by the authors, though it is
possible to unlock them again.

Have a look for a 'Unlock_procs' prgram (or similar) on the CD.

Ever since I first bought AmosPro, I've tried to have music (either 
Noisetracker or MED module in the title) and then sound effects during 
the game. As soon as I try a SAM PLAY my system dies. I have to reset. I 
think it's because the NT and MM players do not let go of their resources 
when I do a MED STOP or whatever function. Has anyone else had this problem?

Also, I noticed that there is no way to make Amos Music Banks! These 
*are* compatible with the SAM PLAY statement (I tried it with one of the 
included demo banks) but there's no editor or anything! I tried to figure 
out the stuff about it in the manual but it didn't make too much sense to 
me..

Thanks/...

I`ve been not reading my mail for a few days, so this might have been
already suggested :-(.

But how about suporting both. Ie have a command to set the global
varaible that points to the bank or whatever in question :
SetIconBank( 1 ); and also have a parameter passed to the function
which can overwrite this if required, but uses the global varaible
value if NULL;
PasteIcon( x, y, icon_num, NULL); /* Use global variable */
PasteIcon( x, y, icon_num, 3 ); /* use bank 3 for this call only */

Using C`s Vargs could be helpful here as well, or it could be a
tag list option.

I had't this problem. However, Med modules get the control of all audio
channels and so it'IS impossible to play at the same time med mods and 
samples. If you want to play a sample you have to stop med module, but 
to let go  NT and Med resources you have to erase NT and Med bank(s).

Possible, but probably a month or so away until we have our own T1 line

This Christmas I tried to program a scrollable text window, in which a list of
items could be scrolled through, and an item selected, and highlighted. I
failed.

Does anybody have a procedure for doing this that I could have a look at, and
if not, tell me where to look? I would prefer it if the procedure was in 1.3
compatible AMOS, and not in Interface language.

If anybody has tried IntOS, could they tell us whether it is worth buying? I am
tempted.

Regards,

Jonathan

I think the GMC editor, which is on APD001 will make ABK files
automatically.  Or, make a Tracker module and use the converter to move it
to an ABK format.

The amospro help system uses text from the AMOSPro_System:Accessories/Help
directory, and it is in an AMOSPro hypertext format similar to that used for
the interface hypertext, and is horrible to write. The viewer is an AMOS
program using the Set Accessory command. 

For the next version of Easylife, I have done the opposite to your suggestion,
and converted the AMOSPro help to .guide format, then wrote a guide viewer
program which displays the help on the AMOSPro editor screen like the AMOS
help program does, and replaces the AMOSPro help program wherever it is called.
This means you can press the help key to get help on the extension commands
as well as the built in commands, and can use the superiour hypertext controls
of the amiga guide system.

The top level menu page is automatically generated from the filenames of the
.guide files in the help directory, so to add help for more extensions /
accessory programs, you simply copy them into the help directory. I will
release it when I have fixed some bugs.

Converter?  Is there one that I was supposed to receive with AMOSPro??

Yup. They left it out of the AmosPro package.

If anyone needs it, I've got it (Oooer :)

I had to scavenge it from a friend who's a PC clone but still has his
A500 tucked away in a dust corner. I knew clones had some uses..

I wrote a hypermedia program to display hypertext and link to images,
animations and samples.

It doesn't use the Interface sytem whatsoever :)

This uses a vertical scrolling routine to read through the text.

If anybody is interested in this program, drop me a line.

Hallo guys,

I know that this is the amos-list but i think everyone of you is hoping
about Amiga's future. So i have to tell you a new.
Today afternoon, i received a mail from my friends inside University.
They received a mail  from an english man. In this letter is written
a good new (i don't know how it's true..) about Amiga's future.
Commodore Uk, on January 15, bought definitly ashes of Commodore Inc.
This new came from various shops placed in UK.

I think this is a true new because a friend of mine told me that an his
friend went in England last week and speaking with an Amiga seller he
know that on Sunday Amiga was saved....

Pleasance also spoke about next Amiga models. The first model to be released
will be an A1800. This model is based on an A1200 but it come with a
68030/25 inside and an external CDROM..

RE: Assigning all the disks

Actually, I only assign the main directory, and when APro loads, it assigns all
the others it finds in the same directory, and when I exit APro, it deletes
those assigns.

 Kinda neat, huh?  And it does it without any setup on my part.

Ummm, probably not since AMOS Pro supports Tracker MODs.  I will send it to
you soon.  Email me so I do not forget!  :)

Last night I encountered what I think are two (relatively small) bugs in 
AMOS Pro (2.0 - A1200)

1. Editor Bug: When I Cut something from window#2, paste it on window#1 
and then close window#2, the stuff I pasted is deleted again from 
window#1. Luckily, it's still in the buffer, so I can paste it again.
2. Dual Playfield: Dual playfielding with an unpacked screen (a screen 
that wasn't opened with screen open) results in major screen mess up.
Oh, btw, those of you who are developing the updated AMOSPro, will there 
be more colours available in a dual Playfield on an AGA machine? And 
would it be possible to create a triple, or even quadruple playfield?

Also, somebody said (quite a long time ago) that he'd send me some 
explanation of the HTan function, if nobody else would. Well, nobody else 
has (poor me), so couold you please?

Amos Professional Compiler

 - I own AmosPro, n Id like to buy the compiler.

   When I tried to compile an adventure game made with AmosClassic 1.3 (using the old compiler), well... it didnt work at all! Errors, gurus, etc.

   Id like to know if the professional compiler works well (even with bugs, but bugs: no gurus I hope!) n if there r big problems if r those kind of problems u can sort out or u have to lay on an interpreted version of your program!

   x Italy:
As I live in Italy I want to point out that its very, very, very&very, well... very difficult to find Amiga products n even harder to find Amiga software! If someone knows a place where I can obtain the package it would be good.

   x Foreign Lands:
Ive read many ads on the compiler, almost all in UK. But it isnt easy for me to buy there as I dont have a credit card n I can pay only when it arrives here! As if it wouldnt be enough, sometimes (often) I cant even understand how much I should pay for p&p as they say "...add 1$ inside N.Y., 2$ outside..." sometimes u dont understand if u should make 1+total, 2+total or 1+2+total.
   If theres a place where I can buy it paying when arrives... let me know.

Yes, my Amiga1200 is much slower than your A4000!
I think I can reach 20 lines before it becomes too slow. 
The routine cannot be optimized to much... they are only 3 loops which 
execute moltiplication and addition... but the problem is that i have a 
"dynamic matrix". It changes to modify the objects on the screen.
So I have to store all new values into this matrix (which is 3x3).
And then repeat all the calculations!

I use turbo Extension. I use the Line 3d command (I hope it is optimized 
as the f_draw!). But still everything is very slow!

NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You mean

for(i=0;i<100;i++)

   circle(1,rnd(319),rnd(199),rnd(15));
} ?

I have no idea why there are a multitude of Paul's messages.  They are
being sent by HELA.ins.cwru.edu, so I can not stop them.  Just bear with
it.  It is not that big of a deal, just a bit annoying.  Also, if you want
to comment on it, just send it to amos-request, not to the entire list.

Thanks.

Seeing code like this has definitely converted me to the MARP/C++ idea.

Subject: Sad Error Messages
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Hi I am new on this Amos list so hopefully here goes:-

Is it possible at all to replace the sad Amos error message which comes
up when you are:-

1) Write to disk that is not there?

2) Load A file when disk is not in Df0: ?

3) Save a file to a disk when write protected ?

The on error level trapping doesnt seem to work with these errors and instead 
of my very fancy error procedure executing a get the usual sad Amos Requester?

I am working in Amos 1.35 so any suggestions must be workable with this.

Thanks in advance for any help :)

I have done this, but it is a bit of a hack. I wrote a small C routine 
which defines input and output paramters in one variable block, and 
initialise each with a destinctive value, i.e.

int In1 = 1111;
int In2 = 2222;
int Out1 = 3333;
int Local;

void main()

{
...
}

Then I compiled it with a compiler which compiles to assembler, I used 
NorthC.

>From this assembler file I could see the input variables and change the 
assembler to make these act as parameters correctly. Finally the 
assembler was compiled and loaded into an Amos bank. This is neither easy 
or neat but id does work!

I have it running on my A1200, no problem.  Maybe you need to re-install?
Or, update it to v1.36 (if your v3.2 = v1.32).

Usually i use this way (but i work in Amos Pro!):

- Insert command Request Off at the start of your program. It turn off Amos
Pro Requester.

- Use error-handling routines that get an error if it occours 
  EX: A=Errn

  - Write a procedure that allows you to print a different error message
    on the screen or a procedure that flash if an error comes.

    I used this way to get errors in my Pattern Generator V11 program and
    it seems to work fine...

    However, if you have this problem, i can search my procedures and
    send you a copy...

Sorry if I didnt make my self clear but I am using Amos 1.35 so I cant use 
AmosPro commands :(

I have tried the on error command and a=err or something like that and it just
doesnt seem to have any effect on disk i/o errors. :(

First of all Hi again from Jay :)

Second how are Amos sprite banks stored?

I want to know this because I want either a C program or an Amos program
to convert an Amos sprite bank into a format that a C program could
read and display the sprites.

The sprite are just 16x16 pixels and in 32 colours !

Is it possible to do this in either C or AMOS?

Hi!

> Second how are Amos sprite banks stored?

Here you go :

dc.b	"AmSp"
dc.w	Number_Of_Objects
REPT	Number_Of_Objects
	dc.w	X_Size
	dc.w	Y_Size
	dc.w	Number_Of_Planes
	dc.w	X_HotSpot
	dc.w	Y_HotSpot
	REPT	Number_Of_Planes
		*
		* Image Data goes here
		*
		dcb.w X_Size*Y_Size
	ENDR
ENDR
*
* Palette data
*
dcb.w	32

Yup.  It'd be easier to do it in AMOS - just load the sprite bank, paste 
the objects to a screen, and then save out the raw screen data with Bsave.

  The reason error-trapping doesn't work correctly with those is because the
Amiga's OS automatically pops up requesters whenever one of these things
happens.  There's a way to prevent this from happening, but it requires
making system calls and I don't know how anyway.  If someone else knows,
please tell us.

Hi,
 
This message has nothing whatsoever to do with Amos or AmosPro.
 
It regards a Computer Mail-Order company called "Computer Express Supplies",
who are based in St. Albans.
 
Whatever you do, do not order anything from them :- I ordered an A4000 before
Christmas, and was assured of delivery before Christmas or in any case no later
than the 4th of January this year. It is now the 20th of January, and I have
yet to recieve my order (the cheque had been cleared since the 20th December).
After numerous phone calls, most of which were treated with extreme rudeness
and evasiveness on their part, they finally stated that my order would be
delivered this week sometime. Another phone call later, they stated that they
would not deliver for another 2 or 3 months! At this point, it was decided to
cancel the order, and they should return all monies immediately; this they have
so far refused to do. I will be taking legal action shortly.
 
The point of this message is this, if you know anyone who was thinking of
placing an order with this company, tell them not to do so; and more to the
point, if you know of anyone else who is experiencing similar troubles with
this company, please put them in contact with me,
 
by E-mail

Hmm... maybe this would help, I'm not sure:

If Exist("DF0:")
  ' load or save the file now
Else
  Print "No disc in drive!"
End If

  Okay this is from memory so be careful...

	dc.b AmSp   <-- Heh I'm a Sprite Bank?
        dc.w length <-- # Of Sprites
      FOR I=1 to LENGTH
	dc.w  depth
	dc.w  width  (in words ie. width*16=pixels)
	dc.w  height
	dc.w  x_hot
	dc.w  y_hot
	dc.b  image_data -> size = depth*(width*16)*height/8
      NEXT I
 
      if the Sprite is empty -> depth = 0

Subject: Europress on the net?
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Ok, question time for all those little niggling things:

Does anyone know if Europress has an internet address? If so what it is?

If one of the people who have the Amos CD could send me a copy of the
"unlock procedure" progam it would be much appreciated.

Does any one know a source of A3000 tower cases? I have an A3000 tower
mother board and PSU, but no case!

For Australian (Sydney) people, I saw Amos Pro (box + manuals) for sale for
$50 (I paid $100 just for the upgrade!). Check out Amadeus computers.
(02)6522712.

I'd like to start an Amos magazine which would be sent over the net. It
will be free, but I'd need help with articles/programs/items of intrest.
Anyone interested or willing to help? Your comments appreciated.

Not being a developer (what have they done so far. Last I heard they still
hadn't gotten the source from Europress) I'll answer anyway.
In the hardware reference guide it says that you can only have the number
of colours that amos already uses. So unless the hardware changes (I'm not
sure about AGA, as I have a A2000) I don't think this will be possible.

OH dear here we go:
Hyperbolic functions are used in engineering. They represent the tension in
a hanging cable, such as power lines or a suspension bridge.
There are major difference between hyperbolic functions (htan) and circular
functions (tan).
The circular functions are periodic, that is they repeat each cycle, 360
degrees, etc.
Hyperbolic functions are not periodic.

sin x varies between -1 and +1 , oscillates
hsin x varies between -infinity and + infinity ,steadily increases.
cos x  varies btween -1 and +1 , oscillates.
hcos x varies between +infinity to +1 to + infinity
tan x varies between - infinity and + infinity
htan x varies from -1 to +1

No, but their magazine (Amiga Computing) does.  They never answer.

I have the CD but have not been able to find it.  If anyone knows which APD
disk it was on, let me know.

get a hard drive (Wahey!) and would like as many as possible!!

In particular, I'd love a version of the intuition one..!

I have a short list of extensions and which numbers they are from the

Can anyone help me with alternate access to this amos-list?

Maybe the list manager can just post all messages that come in, on a newsgroup?

Comp.sys.amiga.programmer would be good for this, please look into it, as you will add about another 100 or so persons if you do.

extension - the internet link I use here tends to just skip large packets of
messages when I am reading unless I manually enter each message number.

Be that as it may, it being past the 21st and no file in sight, could you send
it regular mail (if you haven't already)?

Sorry to have to be such a pest.  What I don't understand is how I got the demo
so easily, but can't seem to get the registered version at all.

Oh well.

  Thanks.

You should note, however, that this doesn't free up the resources - it 
just removes the assign from the list; there's no way of cancelling a 
DISMOUNT without rebooting, and careless use may result in a visit from 
our friend the Guru.  (If you're using 1.3, then it's REMOVE, not 
DISMOUNT.  REMOVE is supported in 2.0+, and it's better to use this to 
ensure compatibility...)

 Ive already given an answer to this, but was for urgent problems, as it worked only if the ellipse was drawn in a unique colour (different from any in the background).

 The following example shows how to achieve the effect and can be extended to any kind of shapes (not just ellipse, but it's easier with regular shapes).

 You'll find a procedure inside the example, called OUTELLIPSE that isn't called. It's sufficient to copy that and it'll work. In the example I follow a different way, just to reduce the waste of memory, but the procedure is easier n more safe.

 The idea is simple (but not so easy to be thought): just create a copy of the screen n then fill IN the shape created. Then transfer this on the original background XORing it all, so only the area inside the shape is preserved!!!!!

Do you have full net access? If so then check out some of the Amos WWW

To the Amos Development Members:

   Ive known of PLAYFIELD, looking for people to upgrade AMOS. Ive found there's a growing ADT out there and so Ive found what I was searchinf for!

   As Ive few contacts n Im so far from ther active lands (Italy isn't so...), I can only ask somebody else to do the hard work.

   I have a lot of raw work in progress, being something to improve the package in general (including the cover, examples, accesories...). What is really needed, anyway, is improving the program itself! WE NEED THE SOURCE OF AMOS!

   I haven't understood if someone has already look for that, just I want to remind everybody that if there's something to pay... well, let's pay! I don't think Europress will give it to anyone will ask!!! I think we should make the first step!

   1 - Can anyone ask how much for that? (Even if it would be much, if divided into parts it'll be few pounds... or something more...)
   2 - Instead: Have someone contacted Europress? Is it possible that it will lead the project?

	Obviously the source code will arrive in the hands of few people. I think would be better that ONE will obtain it n then the others will contact this person (the coordinator of the ADT). Otherwise unknown eyes could see it and it would be a danger!!!!!!!!!!    BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!

Ok, boys.
After a week of hard work I managed to do a "good" 3D engine to be used 
for my POV-Ray Modeller. 
It is quite fast (it is written in basic, remember). I can have 25 line 
on screen moving at 7-8 frames per second. The good thing is that 
doubling the lines does not halve the fps!
In fact the major work is done in calculations (there are many loops!)not 
on drawing line (line 3D is quite fast).
I have also set the 3-view panels, where you can see your object from 
TOP/FRONT/SIDE. 

Rotations and translations are there.
The problem is... screen update.

None has some ideas in how to update a object in a fast way without 
having to update all the object on the screen (which really works well but 
slows everything down!) ?

I have some idea... but others are welcome.

Thanks

Well, if you have TURBO PLUS, couldn't you use the (I can't remember the
command) Wait VBL like command where you specify which line to wait for
before continuing?  In other words if you have a scroller at the top of the
screen and the scroller's bottom is on line 75, just wait till line 76
before going on to the next loop.

Make sense?

Subject: Using sprite bank
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Hi again all Amos programmers here is another Amos problem from Jay:

Thanks for everyone who replyed to me question off how Amos sprite banks are 
stored.

I dont know much about machine code so could anyone give me a little hint on how
I could read a sprite bank in Amos and convert to code so that I can use
the putimage() getimage() or something on C++.

I hope I have made my self clear and thank anyone in advance of the answer :)

Subject: Re: delete an assign - the correct way
Status: RO
X-Status: 

To clear up the confusion, to remove an assign, made with the assign
command such as AMOSPro_System: or a default assign such as C: or LIBS:,
you simply type:

Assign <VOLUME_NAME>

e.g.

Assign C:


However, if you want from "remove" a real device, such as "DF0:", then you
must use the DISMOUNT keyword e.g.

Assign PAR: DISMOUNT
Assign DF0: DISMOUNT

Using the later assign, it is possible to fool some floppy drive only
programs into using a hard drive directory (Simply reassign Df0: afterwards).

NOTE: You can't remount some devices again afterwards, Df0: being an example.

As for the REMOVE keyword for assign, I'm not sure, it may be a synonym for
DISMOUNT under 1.3 - check the amiga dos manual. 

Also, under 2.04+, each program can use PROGDIR: for the directory it was
run from. For interpreted AMOS programs, this is the directory AMOS was
run from.

It is possible to write a web front end, but there would be 2 big
problems:

1) You'll need to convert the gif images to something understandable -
   using a gif datatype would be best, but that means using datatypes
   library manually from AMOS - not easy.

2) You'll need an HTTP server which I have no clue how to write, or
   whether the existing one that comes with AMosaic could be used from
   AMOS.

However, graphically AMOS is quite up to the task of displaying HTML,
and even managing forms, but it would not be my langauge of choice for
such a project.

Does anyone have any fast procedures to convert 3 dimentional points into

slightly deformed. Also, how about hidden-line removal? Is anything like 
this available?

Thanx

Not quite.. you would have to be able to open sockets etc... (= great fun)
