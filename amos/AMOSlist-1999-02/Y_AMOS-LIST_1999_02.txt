   * ASCII signitures have been rebuilt where possible.
     Unfortunately Yahoo store messages in a way which means more than 1 space
     is stored as just 1 space. Viewing the message source, and then trying to
     view HTML source in Firefox didn't make any difference.
     Where I have been unable to rebuild the ASCII signitures I have simply put
     "ASCII Signiture As-Is" by the message number.

     Thanks to Mark de Jong (from the AMOS-LIST) for helping me with rebuilding
     Floquet's ASCII signiture. (who else would keep emails for 7 years?!)

     Thanks to Andrew Allen for preserving Peter Cahill's ASCII signiture for
     me (see message 1613) in November 1998.

     Thanks to Michael Cox, as I was able to cross-reference some emails from
     the Onelist archives with ones posted to the Yahoo one to reinstate email
     addresses that Yahoo has discarded, and rebuild some ASCII signitures.


   Message From Archivist
  ------------------------

   I hope everyone enjoys reading the messages and appreciates me archiving
   them. It took hours of work to get all the info into this file and then 
   rebuild the ASCII signitures as best as I could.
   Don't forget to join, or atleast visit, the Y! AMOS-LIST group:

Dungeon demo available.

Mon Feb 1, 1999 4:33 am
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


To those CBATNAM vets:

The latest demo of the Dungeon has been completed.
Some features of the features are listed below:

Support for doors added (not complete)
Support for sliding on walls (forward/backward)
Added ray gun which bobs up/down when walking
Replaced the original status bar
Cap'n Bubba icon which reacts to things
Added more toggling options (on/off)
Improved texture mapper (not c2p though)

and more. Brane and Giark have the demo, so if you are an ORIGINAL CBATNAM
beta-tester or programmer and would like to have the demo, mail Braneloc.
When you get it, follow the installation instructions in the docs. I can't
stress how important it is to READ THE FRIGGIN' DOCS. If you can't find a
key or have a feature-related problem and HAVEN'T READ THE DOCS, the DON'T
COME CRYING TO ME, and don't say I didn't warn you first. I know most of
you don't like (sometimes me included) to read the docs, but DO IT. I'm
sure you'll thank me afterwards (and you'll say, "Cool! New feature!").

Nevertheless, run the demo as per the instructions and *please* send me a
report of how well it ran on 1. different setups or 2. different details
(ie. with or without texture mapping, screen sizes, etc.). Until then.

The official Parrottsoft site at http://parrottsoft.hypermart.net up soon.

I should also note to all those interested in making contributions to the
project, I have also set up some FTP space for the project, and anyone who
wishes to make a contribution may upload it where the pitfall team can
check it out. This includes screenshots, the more the better!

Simply log your FTP client in as anonymous to mushypd.dynip.com and go into
/pub/amiga/amos/pitfall_project (this folder allows you to download any
public information on the project) and if you go into the uploads
directory, here you can store things such as screenshots etc. I for one
would like to see more screenshots from the various different platforms. If
you have any questions, feel free to email me at mushypd@redrose.net

What version?

Tue Feb 2, 1999 9:20 am
"Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>


Can someone tell me what are the latest versions for the following files.
And if you have them all work together with no problems.

AMOSPro.lib
amos.library
AMOSPro_GUI.lib

I am having trouble getting AMOSPro to work properly and I believe my
problem lies with these three files.

Another question, why would the V2 AMOSPro updater disk fail to recognise my
APSystem folder on my hard drive?

And another question, why would AMOSPro fail to load a configuration file
that I just edited and report the error "This is not an AMOSPro
Configuration File."

Thanks in advance.

Declan.

Cap'n Bubba And The Nasty Alien Menace

Intro

Scene: 1
Slow pan to the right, looking at empty space. The Earth slowly swings into
view. Camera zooms in to see the AMOS (Atmospheric Monitoring Orbital
Station) circling the Earth. Camera zooms in too close and bounces off the
station. (Clang!)

Scene 2
Cap'n Bubba sits at the bar. It is a dingy place with a robot bartender
that leaks various evil looking fluids. He stubs out a cigarette and takes
a drink from the glass in front of him. There are several other glasses,
some knocked over, strewn on the bar in front of him.

Bartender: (Scene02.1.8svx) Yo. Want another, Captain Bubba?

His girlfriend, Shawna, sits beside him, playing with her hair.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene02.2.8svx) How will I ever pay the Tax Man?

Scene 3
An evil looking ship, bristling with guns, flashing lights prominently
displayed, bearing the words `Special Tax Acquisition Branch' (STAB)
approaches the station and docks.

Scene 4
Cap'n Bubba looks up. His cheeks bulge out. He staggers quickly toward the
men's room.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene04.1.8svx) Blurk! Oh, no! Excuse me!

As he exits, STAB agents enter the bar.

STAB: (Scene04.2.8svx) Mmm, everybody freeze! Hold it! Hold it right there!
Nobody move! That's it! Freeze! Hold it! Nobody move! Stand still! Hey!
You! I'm talking to you. Hold it! Freeze!

Scene 5
Look at the door as the Tax Man enters. He looks around the room as the
bartender quivers and leaks.

Tax Man: (Scene05.1.8svx) I am the Tax Man.

Scene 6
Cap'n Bubba leans over the toilet, moaning. He looks up to see something
written on the wall.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene06.1.8svx) Oh. Oh. Hold it. What's this?

Scene 7
On the wall is written `Lots of treasure in the Dungeon Of Ultimate Terror'
and `For a good time, call Shawna'.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene07.1.8svx) Lots of treasure in the Dungeon Of Ultimate
Terror. Hey! For a good time, call Shawna?

Scene 8
`Hmm', Cap'n Bubba says, `with that treasure, I could pay off the Tax Man.'

Capn Bubba: (Scene08.1.8svx) Hmm. With that treasure, I could pay off the
Tax Man.

Scene 9
The Tax Man orders the bar searched.

Tax Man: (Scene09.1.8svx) Search the bar.

STAB: (Scene09.2.8svx) Yes, Sir. Ack! Right away, Sir. We'll do it. Yes,
Sir, yes Sir.

He crosses to Shawna and grabs her arm. `Help me, Cap'n Bubba!' she cries.

Shawna: (Scene09.3.8svx) Help! Help me, Cap'n Bubba!

Scene 10
Cap'n Bubba looks out the door to see the STAB minions of the Tax Man heading
in his direction and the Tax Man clutching his beloved Shawna.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene10.1.8svx) Oh, no! The Tax Man has my beloved Shawna.

Scene 11
Cap'n Bubba quickly dodges into the janitor's supply room.

Scene 12
The STAB minions enter the men's room and look around.

STAB: (Scene12.1.8svx) You see him? I don't see him. You see him? Nope.
Don't see him anywhere. Hmm. Nobody here.

Stage 1 Intro

Scene 13
Cap'n Bubba quickly builds a jet-pac out of fire extinguishers and a gun
from a squirt bottle of cleaning solvent, a hose and a convenient bucket.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene13.1.8svx) Hmm. That hero training will come in handy
now!

Scene 14
Cap'n Bubba leaps out and splats stuff at the STAB minions as he runs out
the door.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene14.1.8svx) Take that, you evil minions of the Tax Man!

STAB: (Scene14.2.8svx) Ew! Icky! Ew! Oh, no! Ouch!

Scene 15
Cap'n Bubba blasts out of an airlock to smash his way through the STAB
minions that stand between him and the Dungeon Of Ultimate Terror.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene15.1.8svx) Ho ho!

Scene 16
The Tax Man orders his STAB minions to stop Cap'n Bubba.

Tax Man: (Scene16.1.8svx) Stop him. Stop Captain Bubba.

STAB: (Scene16.2.8svx) You got it! Let's get him! Get him, boys! Hey! Come
back here, Bubba!

Stage 2 Intro

Scene 17
Cap'n Bubba has disabled the Tax Man's ship temporarily. He jets off toward
the Nasty Alien Planet.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene17.1.8svx) Haha! Follow me now, you lousy, tax-gathering
scum!

Scene 18
The Tax Man rants and raves as his STAB minions try to fix the ship.

Tax Man: (Scene18.1.8svx) Fix this ship. I must capture Cap'n Bubba.

STAB: (Scene18.2.8svx) Yes, Sir. Right away! Hey! What's wrong with that?
Oh! Look out! Youch! Hey, fix it! C'mon. What's wrong? Hurry up!

Scene 19
Cap'n Bubba eases down to the Nasty Alien Planet's surface and is
confronted by spiders, dragons and other nasty creatures.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene19.1.8svx) Oh! What horrid creatures!

Stage 3 Intro

Scene 20
Cap'n Bubba drops his gun and whips out his trusty `LectroSword.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene20.1.8svx) Ha ha! My trusty `LectroSword will take care
of you!

Scene 21
In front of the Gates Of Doom, or so the sign says, Cap'n Bubba is
confronted by armoured aliens. He raises his `LectroSword and meets the
attack.

Aliens: (Scene21.1.8svx) Ay. Heh heh heh. Waahn meepmeep nam nep nik. Abba
nipmip bdldwee eepee vip le weewee. Meep dik deehav deb. Ahbah ehbeck deb.

Stage 4 Intro

Scene 22
Cap'n Bubba steps over the dead aliens and puts his `LectroSword away. He
passes the Gates Of Doom and cautiously enters the Dungeon Of Ultimate
Terror.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene22.1.8svx) And now, for the Dungeon Of Ultimate Terror.

Scene 23
The Tax Man's ship lands on the planet. STAB minions scramble out to secure
the area.

STAB: (Scene23.1.8svx) Hmm. Hey. Hey, look at this. Wow. Ooh. A planet.
Hey. Hmm. We're down. Ho! Hey! Look out! Here comes the Tax Man. You better
beware.

The Tax Man exits the ship and orders them to find Cap'n Bubba.

Tax Man: (Scene23.2.8svx) Find Cap'n Bubba, my minions.

Bonus Stage Intro

Scene 24
Cap'n Bubba's eyes bulge out and start to spin around. Everything goes
blurry.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene24.1.8svx) Oh! What's happening to me?

He hears Shawna calling for him.

Shawna: (Scene24.2.8svx) Oh, Cap'n Bubba, help me!

Scene 25
Cap'n Bubba is transported to a strange place, filled with bouncing
bubbles. He smiles as he shoots at the bubbles.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene25.1.8svx) Ah, ha ha ha ho! Bubbles!

Win

Scene 26
Cap'n Bubba stumbles out of the Dungeon Of Ultimate Terror, clutching sacks
of loot.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene26.1.8svx) Ah ha! I've made it!

The Tax Man looms over him.

Tax Man: (Scene26.2.8svx) Finally, Cap'n Bubba, we meet.

Scene 27
Cap'n Bubba tosses two sacks at the Tax Man's feet.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene27.1.8svx) There's your money, you bloodsucking scum!
Now, give me back my girlfriend.

STAB minions collect the loot

STAB: (Scene27.2.8svx) Hey, look! Money! He did it! Wow! Hmm. I wonder if
there's any more in there? Hmm. Gotta pick this up! Ya! Grab it!

as the Tax Man motions Shawna forward.

Shawna: (Scene27.3.8svx) Oh, Cap'n Bubba, you've saved me!

Scene 28
Shawna smiles and holds up a bottle of rum.

Shawna: (Scene28.1.8svx) Look what I've brought for you, Cap'n Bubba.

Scene 29
Cap'n Bubba grabs the bottle,

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene29.1.8svx) Oh, my darling! You think of everything!

swings his arm around Shawna and,

Shawna: (Scene29.2.8svx) Oh, Cap'n Bubba, you're my hero!

clutching another sack of loot in his other hand, jets off into the sky.

Lose

Scene 30
Cap'n Bubba slumps against the wall. He is beaten.

Cap'n Bubba: (Scene30.1.8svx) Oh! I can't go on.

Scene 31
The Tax Man strides into the room, Shawna at his side. `It's all mine' the
Tax Man gloats.

Tax Man: (Scene31.1.8svx) Ah ha ha, Ha ha. It's all mine now, Cap'n Bubba.

Shawna: (Scene31.2.8svx) What did I ever see in him, Mister Tax Man, honey?

It seems like every month someone requests information on a
PC version of AMOS. You can check into Interplay's new BASIC
development system or actually the new JAMA3d will probably be
your best bet. JAMA3d is an updated version of AMOS being created
by Francois Lionet and team.

Are there anyone selling these still? What is definetly freeware and can be

Amos was written in 68k asm around the amiga custom chipset. It's 0%
portable the the PC (or any other system for that matter....)

Someone is writing a PC version of an AMOS-like basic, and AMOSNG
will be in C, which is much more portable.

I'll do my best....

ST > amount of chipram,

Just use the Chip Free command.

CHIPMEM=Chip Free
Print CHIP
For Kb use...CHIPMEM=Chip Free/1024
print CHIP


ST > amount of fastram,

The same as abive but just replace the "Chip Free" with "Fast Free".

ST > chipset (aga,ocs,ecs)

CHIPSET=Gfxcall(-888)
If CHIPSET=$f then CHIPTYPE="AGA"
If CHIPSET=$3 then CHIPTYPE="ECS"
If CHIPSET=$0 then CHIPTYPE="OCS"
Print CHIPTYPE


Hope that helps ???

Amos or CanDo3.?

Wed Feb 3, 1999 12:40 pm
Stephen Thornber <SThornber@steve1.demon.co.uk>



Hi all,

I want to write a program launcher, (similar to wangipad)
that opens a window on wb with a list of files and a slider.

I can do this no probs, but before I start coding I'd like
your opinions.

Do you think amos is up to this..? (ie stable enough)
I'd be using the superb gui extension.

the only other thing I can use to make it is CanDo v3.008
but I'd rather use amos.

the things my launcher would have to run would be:-

Lightwave
Imagine
MagiC64
DirWork
PPaint
Photogenics

etc etc

would amos's gui be okay for that.?

(and before you say it, NO I am not learning C... :)

Hi there,

Can some kind soul please tell me how to get an Arexx program to
request a string response from the Arexx Answer command. I don`t
have a problem retrieving the numerical return code, but I *need* to
be able to have my AMOS code return a string value as well. And, so
far, I can`t see how to make Arexx ask for one.
I know I could just shove the string value in a temporary text file,
and have Arexx read that once a suitable return code has been
obtained, but I`d prefer to do it all with the message passing
protocols that supposedly exist already...


TIA

With Gui Ext and Amos Exec command you should be

Ok, I can't see how you can propperly vote for 5 ideas on totally
different subjects, but heres my oppinion on 'em:

#1.Randomly selected jungle backdrop images over which the 16x16 (?)
blocks are laid as the ground / platforms.#
##
I think that this idea is a must.

#2.3D rendered barrels, which perhaps have a bit of "perspective"
depending on their screen position#
##
*Just* the barrels rendered?? I think its all or nothing, otherwise
it'd look a mess!

#3.Menu option for either "Classic" or "Modern" modes / GFX / SFX#

Thats another good idea.

#4. Set up a gfx palette from which to do all game gfx#

That's just about the only way you'd be able to do it isn't it. What
you could do is have colours 0-15 as the bg colours and then have 16-31
as the sprite palette. This would make it possible to use different bg
palettes without messing about having different sets of sprites.

#5.Draw all the gfx, then Floyd-Steinberg them and combine palettes in
Personal Paint#

Yuch! I think you could get it looking /much /nicer by hand drawing
it. (having dithering makes stuff look messy with limited colours/res)

See ya.

I'm trying to write (yet another) Asteroids clone to help me further
my knowledge of AMOS and I've got stuck =((

I have managed to increment and decrement the speed correctly and to change
the ships image to the correct direction in relation to joystick
movements...the problem I have is :

1) How do I make the ship go in the direction that the ship is facing ?

I have 8 images atm...up, up right, right .....etc

Well, my idea is this: Obviously you are already reading the joystick to set
the correct ship image. In the same way you can use DX,DY values that you
have set for each joystick position to feed into the movement loop.
Something like this.....

Do
X=X SPRITE(1): Rem Read current X co-ord
X=X+DX: Rem Add movement increment (which can be negative)
Y=Y SPRITE(1):Rem Now Y movement
Y=Y+DY
Sprite 1,X,Y,image number: Rem Sprite goes to new position
Loop


This is probably crap, but someone else on the list will have ideas I guess.

Asteroids (again)

r!K <rik@riks-room.freeserve.co.uk>


Hi all,
hmmmm, still having probs with the asteroids ship movement.

Attatched is the code for you all to look at.
This makes the ship only go left and right for some reason tho ??

Any help very much appreciated.

I think the problem is with the following code

If IMG=1 : DX=0 and DY=-2 : End If
If IMG=2 : DX=2 and DY=-2 : End If
If IMG=3 : DX=2 and DY=0 : End If
If IMG=4 : DX=2 and DY=2 : End If
If IMG=5 : DX=0 and DY=2 : End If
If IMG=6 : DX=-2 and DY=2 : End If
If IMG=7 : DX=-2 and DY=0 : End If
If IMG=8 : DX=-2 and DY=2 : End If

If you replaced the "and"s with ":" then it will adjust the direction
correctly. At the moment, I don't think it realise what direction the
ship is facing.

ie corrected code:

If IMG=1 : DX=0 : DY=-2 : End If
If IMG=2 : DX=2 : DY=-2 : End If
If IMG=3 : DX=2 : DY=0 : End If
If IMG=4 : DX=2 : DY=2 : End If
If IMG=5 : DX=0 : DY=2 : End If
If IMG=6 : DX=-2 : DY=2 : End If
If IMG=7 : DX=-2 : DY=0 : End If
If IMG=8 : DX=-2 : DY=2 : End

Hi r!K,

Hmmmm I don't want to cause problems for you, but I'm sure
you should have more than 8 images for the ship..?
16 minimum I would have thought..?

When you play asteroids and rotate the ship, it moves smoothly
and doesn't jump 45 degrees..

It is m8, I've got 32 images atm and am considering upping this depending
how this looks.

i used 8 so that ppl could easily describe the method of movement (which I
still aint got evan for the basic directions)

Ok, I see that various people have tried to write an Asteroids like
game engine, so I've had a go too.


Mine features a ship with 64 movement frames, 50fps screen update,
sin/cos tables to speed things up, a few REM lines and its easily
adaptible to use more/less movement frames.

Hope this helps. Have fun.

See ya.

Generating a random number is simple, but you can't tell it to

that would be nice, I could name my pictures with numbers.

Help me out.

Can't you just use STR$ to convert the number into a string?

ie.

If you had 10 different pictures:

X=Rnd(10)
X$=Str$(X)-" "
Rem -" " removes the space that amos adds to nos converted to strings
load iff X$
Rem must already be in the directory where pics are stored using DIR$

Pics must then be called "1","2","3",....."10"

Someone already answered how to do it with numbers so I will
cover using "normal" filenames.

All you need is to create a DataTable which contains the names
of the picture files.

For example, you could call the DT something like PICTURE().
If you had 20 pictures then simply...
Dim PICTURE$(20)

Now, you have three main ways of building the DataTable...
statically, externally or dynamically.

Static Data Table Creation
This way requires you to type the data into your source code.
You can either put the filenames into Data statements or assign
the definitions directly (actually more efficient)...
PICTURE$(0)="FirstPic.IFF"
.....
PICTURE$(19)="LastPic.IFF"

External Data Table Creation
You would simply create a small program which allows you to
enter the names of the pictures. Also give an option to modify
an existing picture's filename. Upon loading, you enter the name
of the data file, example: "PICLIST.DAT" and the file will be
loaded if it exists.
After ending, the program simply saves the updated data to this
file.
Now, in your main program you just scan "PICLIST.DAT"
and dynamically generate your DataTable.
Advantages of this method are the seperation of Data & Program
and the ease of changing/adding picture filenames.

Dynamic Data Table Creation
You simply scan a directory for files ending with ".PIC" (or whatever
you use). Once you locate a pic, add it to the DataTable.
This method is by far the simplest way to manage filename changes
and picture additions/deletions.

Okay... the point is to build a DataTable called
PICTURE$(xx)

Then simply generate your random number and access your
DataTable to retrieve the associated picture's filename.

' Generate a random number... refuse 0.
PIC=Rnd(21)
While (PIC=0) : PIC=rnd(21) : Wend
Dec PIC

' Retrieve filename from Data Table...
FILE$=PICTURE$(PIC)

So, as always, you have a few options... these are just some
ideas you can play around with. Or simply use the numbering
method discussed previously. At any rate, have fun!! :-)

A bug in 'x MOD y' command!!

Sat Feb 6, 1999 4:56 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

I've found a nasty bug in the Mod command in AMOSPro:

Whenever you use a negative value like:

a=(-1) Mod 20

This should make 19, but it makes 15!

I wrote a quick program to display what heppens when when you use -1
to mod, and found that only if you use Mod with a power of 2, it
actually works.

Anyone know whats going on here? You can see the problem by running
this little program.


If it does work, then maybe its the version of AMOSPro I have. I use
V2.0 (with the updater on the compiler disk)


See ya.

the easiest way is probably by doing a x = Ibob(i), this way
you'll know which image the bob has, and from its image number
you can know which direction it should move.

For all those interested ! OK, dont laugh, but here it is ! My version of
Pitfall - classic - Ive tried to keep as close to the classic as possible. Be
warned though, ive not managed to completely bug test it, so any you do find,
please let me know ! I wrote this on my lowly A500 with twin drive and AMOS
3.1. Im sending an AMOS compiled version via a PC so the the extension will
have to be edited, plus I think I may have forgotten to change the Set Buffer
to a reasonable value (it works without it, i just forgot to delete it before
saving !)

There are 128 levels and 3 Silver bars, 3 Gold bars, 3 Money bags and 3 Rings
to collect. The game starts as soon as run, and to start another game at the
end just hit return ! The Atari 2600 did not have any fancy text messages, so
Ive left them out ! Please enjoy, and let me know what u think. and dont
forget this only took me a week, of the cuff programming. If I was to write it
again i would SERIOUSLY consider working things out first !

I'd hate to tell you, but it doesn't work. (Probably 'cos I'm using
AMOSPro: It just locks up!)

Could you compile it as an EXE, and not as a procedure please.

I'd rather you didn't. I am used to using Lha and I think most Amigans are,
just look at the Aminet archives.
Archiving is easy with DOPUS. Dont you have at least DOPUS 4, it was given
away on a cover disk, I
find it one of my most used programs. I will mail you Lha if you like then
at least you can archive files on the Miggy, save them to PC format disk
and mail them from a PC. That was the only way I could upload/download
files till last week when I got connected at home. Works fine.

In the Amos manual it says u can actually do -

which removes all spaces from a string ! But as to it being faster, i have

Agreed. Its a pain to keep downloading all this stuff too. Cant the pitfall
crew use the FTP space I alloted them? it does have a public upload area,
so the team can test all versions before placing them into view. If the
guys want me to explain how/where it is, just say the word. It will also
stop those who hate large mails from whining too, hehe.

Actually, I wanted a random number from 0 to 19...
Of course, I could simply use PIC=Rnd(20) but the purpose
of the method above is to refuse the value 0 (explained below).

PIC=Rnd(21) returns a value from 0 to 20...
0 is refused meaning if PIC=0 we grab another random value.
Ultimately, we end up with a value from 1 to 20....
...which is Decremented so the value is from 0 to 19.
It is a common method to refuse 0 (in non real-time applications)
as that value seems to come up more often than it *should*.

However, there is a better way to code this process...
Repeat : PIC=Rnd(21)-1 : Until (PIC>-1)
Which does the same thing in only one line. :-)

But, I thought perhaps this condensed method would not clearly
illustrate what I was doing. Hahahaha. :)

Re: A bug in 'x MOD y' command!!

Tue Feb 9, 1999 4:17 pm
"Garfield Benjamin" <gbenjam@sosbbs.com>


AC> I've found a nasty bug in the Mod command in AMOSPro:
AC> Whenever you use a negative value like:
AC> a=(-1) Mod 20
AC> This should make 19, but it makes 15!
AC> Anyone know whats going on here?

If you received the value of 19 THEN you would be in trouble.
-1 Mod 20 EQUALS 15!!

Remember, negative numbers are stored in twos complement
form.

Here is a crash course using a character (8-bit) sized value.
We have eight bits: 0000 0000

To encode a negative value... (using -1 for an example)
Subtract one from the Abs value of our negative...
Abs(-1)=1 - 1 gives us zero : 0000 0000
Flip all bits in this bit-pattern...
0000 0000 becomes 1111 1111
Now, write a 1 into the high bit (already set in this case)...
1111 1111 becomes 1111 1111

To decode a negative value... (again using -1)
Grab the value. In this case we would extract -1...
The bit-pattern is 1111 1111
Because the high bit is 1, we know this value is negative.
Flip all bits in this bit-pattern...
1111 1111 becomes 0000 0000
0000 0000 EQUALS zero (0)
Add one to this value for the true negative value...
0 + 1 EQUALS 1... -1 in this case (high bit was 1).

Anyway, you can see the bit-pattern for -1 is 11111111
Which in binary unsigned terms EQUALS 255.

255 Mod 20 EQUALS 15...
255 / 20 = 12
12 * 20 = 240
255 - 240 = 15

But only in binary unsigned terms and AMOS really should not be

this.

(1) Mod 20 should equal 1 and (-1) Mod 20 should equal -1.
(19) Mod 20 should equal 19 and (-19) Mod 20 should equal -19.

If AMOS is actually using the binary unsigned representation to
calculate the Mod you have indeed found something strange.

...and it certainly does this in my AMOS v1.36!!

Any negative value on the left side of the Mod (either literal or
inside
a variable) is converted to its binary unsigned form before performing
the Mod operation. Bizarre.

Its worse than that.. Now since I'm on the peecee for email (better
sorting, way worse interface) I can't tell how much space the damn email
takes up, and I end up with tons of junk I can't get rid of easily, not to
mention the fact it costs money to download, and space to store, on the
wrong drive, on the wrong smegging machine..

don't you mean PIC=Rnd(18)+1 ???
cos if it picks 19 and then adds 1 its 20!
and 20 ain't between 1 and 19 !!!

Interesting, isn't it. You could just do:
this=-1
a=abs(this) Mod 20
if this<0 then a=-a

..but I suppose thats not the point ;-) I suppose it really depends what
the mod is actually being used for in the long run.

PS, nice binary Garf.

Does Rnd(19) give a random number between 0 and 18 or 0 and 19? Yeah
you're probably right - 0 and 19... must have been a slip of the
keyboard. :)

I had a look at this last night and it is not bad for a weeks work.
I do hope the new version will look a lot better. ;)

An idea that may already have been put forward, is to make the earlier
levels the training levels, perhaps exactly the same as the original. And
work your way to the more original and trickier levels.

Well, youve all had time to look at it, and I hope you enjoyed playing it too
(those of you that could). The frst 10 levels both forwards and backwards
where taken straight from the Atari original (I know, I played it non stop to
get it right !). But anyway, Is the NEW version based on this game or are we
intending to right a varient of the "Pitfall 2 -The lost caverns". This one
was an up/down screen scroller set over 80 screens for all those that dont
remeber this, and Im already part way righting that. If anyones interested I
shall post that on to Leto to put on the site (for those that dont like the
downloads !) for all too see ! This one will be PROPERLY coded and spec`d this
time round !

I was offline since December.. doh!

I've just received my Amiga today... let me some time (1-2 days) to organise

Theres nothing wrong with the sorce, it was the compiled version that
for some reason he sent as an AMOS procedure. AMOSPro didn't like that
version at all, 'cos it was with AMOS1.35, was it not?

The OCS, ECS and AGA blitters are equally fast.
Well... In a given resolution AGA is using a smaller amount of the
bitplane-DMA bandwidth than ECS/OCS - and hence the blitting operations will
be faster.
But the blitter itself has the same speed.

If you don't use more than half of the bandwidth then the blitter will not be
slowed down at all.
Half bandwidth is:
AGA: SHires,4planes or Hires,8Planes
ECS/OCS: Shires,1plane or Hires,2planes or Lores,4planes

Hmm... I am not certain but I think the AGA blitter can operate in
32-bit mode which allows it to move twice as much data as the
OCS/ECS 16-bit blitter in the "same" amount of time.
Maybe I am just daydreaming. :)

Bob Limit

Thu Feb 11, 1999 11:10 am
Leto Kauler <letok@netspace.net.au>


Has anyone ever tried to use more than 67 bobs in AMOS Pro 1.3??
Or a bob with a number higher than 67?

I'm trying to make a sequel to my *eCHAOS* bomberman game. It
needs quite a number of Bobs to show all the flame from
explosions. I'm thinking I'll need about 80-100 bobs for
_everything_.

Now, I've set AMOS Interpreter prefs to run with that number of
Bobs and eveything works fine....... UNTIL I compile it! In a
compiled version it will NOT allow any bobs above no. 67.... it
just quits with "Illegal function call".

I've checked that Compiler is using "S:AMOSPro_Interpreter_Config"
... and that's where AMOS saves it to........... what's going on?

Ah, I read through all my old amy-mags and found out the same
thang. Have you heard that C= actually lost all of their
documentation of OCS-chips before they started to plan AGA.
ECS is just a result of C=s trial to understand how the OCS works.
AGA is nothing more than 8-bitplane 'update' of ECS:P
Don't get me wrong but AGA is quite sad try:( - there are so many
unforgettable mistakes in it, f.ex. different data fetches. I don't
mean that AGA is lame but it should be much better...

Well, thanks but, I didn't actually want -1 mod 20 to be -1 (dang).

What I was trying to do with it needed -1 mod 20 to be 19.

Oh well, I guess I'll just have to do

Well, I'm not sure why it won't work, but if I were you I wouldn't
use bobs to do the flames, that would be much slower then using, say,
Icons to draw the flame.

I think you should probably edit it to use icons insted I'm afraid.

They have all their files on the webservewr, not the FTP space. It should
be on the space too, so people with FTP can get them.

Scrolling

Hi all,
anyone got any tips on writing a scrolling game.

the kind I mean is :
1) Alien Breed
2) Project X
3) Super Frog

Now, the actual speed isn't important, I just can't seem to grasp the
concept of how the scrolling works.
I know it's in 16x16 blocks and these are pasted onto the screen but to
scroll them I'm stuck as I just don't understand the "Screen Copy" command
=((

Anyone know of any good map-makers ??

Anyone got any help/code etc or just a good explanation ??

Thanks in advance..

Ok, this is probably a really bad explanation, but:

I've written a fast hardware scrolling routine with 16x16 icons on an
infinate (ish) map size.

What does all that mean you ask?


Well, the fastest (but hardest) way of doing it is to create a screen
x2 bigger then the actuall display, then as the player scrolls update
the map blocks on either side, making sure that both sides of this
screen are exactly the same. Then when the player goes off the side of
one, move him back to the first half.

I know that sounds really complex, and your right.

I released the sorce for my map routine a while ago, I could send it to
you but its very messy and probably wouldn't be much use to you.

See ya.

Is this just an extractor or can you compress stuff with it? I
couldn't manage to get it to squash anything, probably cos I'm lame

CBAT NAM

"Rev. Giark To You" <giark@hicksville.nws.net>


I've had an inspiration. I will not go into details, but it involves the intro
for CBAT NAM. In the next few days, i will give a list of the 10 or so things
I will need drawn. I'll first go over the pics on the CBAT NAM site, but I
will need a few things done up. I will say that, with minor modifications, the
intros will be done as the script details.

Insane? Not on your life. It came to me while I was thinking of something
else. I tried it and it works.

Well met and godspeed,

Here is a brief(!) description of the method I used in my game WiZiO (Now
available on Aminet ;)


The biggest problem with scrolling is screen flicker and speed when using
Screen Copy. The way around this is to use a screen twice the size of the
visible screen. You then use hardware scrolling for a whole screen; perform
the screen copy to the now 'invisible' half of the screen; then reset the
hardware scrolling offset and start all over again!

The other problem you then have is the pasting of the 16x16 icons so that
they are also invisible to the player. This is achieved by having a buffer
area of 32 pixels off the side of the screen. The first 16 pixels have
already had their icons pasted and are scrolled into view while you paste
to the next 16 pixel area. Then, if you use the screen offset to determine
the vertical position of the icons to paste, you only need to paste 1 or 2
icons every vbl, making the whole thing very fast.

Here is a little diagram of the concept...

0        320     
|_________|___..........
|         | : |        :
|Visible  | : |        : 
|Screen   |A:B|   C    :
|         | : |        :
|_________|_:_|........:
screen offset+ ->


Area A is scrolled into view while icons are being pasted to area B from
top
to bottom.

Once the screen offset reaches the right-hand edge of area A, you can
screen
copy to offset 0, then reset the offset to 0 and start all over again.

It gets a bit more complicated when scrolling both ways with variable
speed,
but the theory's the same.

Hope this helps!


Steve.

What have you guys got against Zip???

All amigas can de-compress Zips fine, and using WinZIP on the PC is
proably easier then using that Lha program.

Blitz

Sat Feb 13, 1999 9:07 pm
r!K <rik@riks-room.freeserve.co.uk>


Hi all,
what is everyones opinions of Blitz ??

I don't want to get the Blitz V's AMOS argument going again but I would just
like to know if ppl think it's any good.

I am thinking of learning it properly now, as I dabbled before but got put
off by the unfriendliness of it all.

I got a 2 weeks off college and am thinking of doing some hard Blitz Study.

Is it worth learning it instead of AMOS, for games most probably...

Also, the GUI Extension rules, but I still can't get a Progress Bar
working...anyone ???

Blitz is slightly faster than amos, and handles AGA slightly better.
Blitz is a lot less stable than amos.
Blitz editor works on non-amiga screens
Blitz editor is absolute garbage, amos editor is really quite good
Blitz is a complete pain, amos is nice to use
Blitz command structure is messy, amos is clean
Blitz has many more bugs than amos
Blitz is alledgedly under development, as is amos.
Blitz has a support list, amos list is friendlier and nicer (hey guys)
Blitz cannot understand the nature of forward declaration, amos can
Blitz costs 100 quid, amos costs, well, less.
Blitz extensions sometimes work, amos extensions pretty much always work
Blitz requires use of "amiga" skills, amos requires use of amos.
Blitz multitasks with few probs, amos multitasks really well with the patch.
Blitz can handle gui's really easily, amos can with the gui extension
Blitz can alledgedly handle mui, amos can alledgedly handle mui.

I bought blitz, spent a lot of time with it, and ended up thinking,
"fast, powerfull, lousy editor, has fundamental gaps in it" compared to
amos, which has a couple of minor bugs and a limited AGA support.
Extensions bypass this.

If you NEED AGA, and you can put up with the two or three MAJOR restrictions
in blitz, it is worth learning. If you never write structured code, you may
never notice the restrictions.

..or you can install a couple of extensions for amos, and get a 68060
machine, and then complain about the graphics bandwidth of the chipset.

Well, I myself like lha better, but zips are fine too:) (just not amiga-ish:)
Anyway, make Lha available to winzip and it'll pack/unpack for you with a
gui:) no need for a dos line:)

You can use lha in assiociation with win zip on your peecee, read the help
docs about installing it. I use it all of the time and it works great.

It was possible with the old one, but not with the "new" one.
Unfortunately. If you find a way, let me know !!!!

Actually, I seem to remember something IS somewhere about it, might be
somehting on aminet ? It's a very vague memory, not quite sure.

ohh right! I thought that'd be the old one!
I think i can recall some source code and schematics on how to build a frame

Mine was in Hisoft basic (which I can recommend - if you like that sort of
thing, hey it works) and was quite interesting. I even got it to work.

Hi there guys,

Sorry to ask this question here, but does anyone have a clipart
file of the Compact Disc logo sign?

Ya know, the one shown on every CD.

Please email me if you do. Final Writer or Wordsworth format would
be nice, but anything will do I suppose :-)

TIA

cya.

Umm, depends which systems you have installed. I have at least half a dozen
different ones lying around.

Err, I'll need to dredge them up, and perhaps do a few snapshots. Or you
could just load up the icon file from newicons, magicwb, or the standard, or
replacement icon files. There is an icon datatype on aminet somewhere,
install it, and you can grab the one you want !!

Blitz Basic

Tue Feb 16, 1999 12:10 pm
Andrew 'BadHart' Maughan <andrew_hom@yahoo.com>


Blitz Basic is in my opinion less stable than a skyscraper on jelly.
I have both Blitz Basic (which I got for £20, when it's worth 10) and
Easy AMOS, and also Amos Professional which is hovering on a PC disk.
Easy AMOS is really difficult to program in, as although it is much
easier to use than Bitz, with its bob editor, disk management and
WORKING example programs, I can't create very fast, executable programs.
With Blitz I have to do double buffering all by myself, and it is very
annoying when you see bits of shapes flashing after unbuffering them.
However, the only reason why I keep programming in this language is
because it is the only way that I can make any finished programs
executable. Including files is a nightmare, and I have to agree that
you have to be a machine code or C expert to use it to its full
potential.
At the moment I am making a helicopter game in Blitz called 'Hog N
Heat'. Wish me luck - I'll need it!

Hi All

I can Program In C, Assem, Amos & Blitz

Blitz In my Opinion Sucks (its utter Toss)
Basic is supposed to be a stable & friendly Enviroment to use
but blitz Throws This out the window & gives U a crap editor
& a dodgy debugger, I mean whats the point in having a debugger if ur code bombs
out
before the debugger is executed (utter CRAP)

Christ coding in binary is probably more stable!!

I got as far as getting this up, and I thought "lha -a filename"
would crunch a file, but it doesn't. None of the stuff I've tried has
worked... Can anyone give me some idea of what command I should be
typing?

I'd try, a$=hex$(127)
? a$
if you still get "$7F" then insert
a$=a$-"$"
I guess Mid$ is a one line solution, probly better for it too,
just not as simple for us laymen.

Super Pac-Mania!

Tue Feb 16, 1999 9:31 pm
"Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>


Hey everybody,
Glad to see how active the list has stayed over the last couple of
years, I may not always write in (and when I do it might jsut be to sya
somehting stupid) but I am always listening in. Also a late welcome to
all the new kids we've acquired, hope your having a good time.
So what have I been up to?? Well last spring I put the finishing
touches on a dynomite Pac-Man knock off, it's not quite a perfect clone,
but it as a game I think it's great, it gets quite a bit of play around my
dorm thanks to the two player simultaneous mode (you can eat each other)
Imagine kids with 400 mhz P2's and G3 mac's lining up to play Pac-Man on
my humble Amiga. It warms my heart, all the more so considering it's a
game I made. Only on an Amiga.
Well one of the reasons the game is such a big draw is that I
rigged it to play sampled Led Zeppelin Riffs when you eat a power pellet,
as if the points weren't enoguh, imagine being rewarded with "Whole Lotta
Love" when you chow down on one of those power pellets.
But now that it has been so long since I finished the game (I've
begun work on a Burger Time clone since then) I have a real hankering to
see it released as freeware, in particular I'd love to hear what you guys
have to say about it, I think it is a really slick proggy, very polished.
The problem is those said same Zep samples. They are over 500K in size.
The game code is 77k, compiles to around 120k with Amos.lib included. How
silly huh? I'd like to know how the game runs on a 1 meg A500, I think
the code is very fast but I have a 25 mhz 10 meg A3000 so I can't tell.
Well first off, I'm worried about copyright violation and secondly I'm
worried that the samples will require too much ram. I mean how silly to
have a 100k game req. more than 1 meg to run.
Anybody interested in giving the game a spin? And any ideas about
the copyright problem?
Thanks,
Scott Matott sXe

A similar problem was posted a few weeks ago, where a space was to be
removed rather than the dollar sign. It was pointed out that the "Mid"
method is quicker then the '-"$"' method. If my memory serves me,
that is...

Oh yeah, isn't it just Mid$(Hex$(127),2) in this case ???

Hi David,
noticed you've been having problems with Lha recently so here goes
with my solution....

Right, the format is: Lha <command> <source> <destination>

*eg. *Lha a games:myprog ram:myprog.lha

This would archive (a=pack) a file located in the path games:myprog to a
file in ram: called myprog.lha

The problem u had seemed to be you were using -a instead of a and not
putting the source filename and destination filename.

anymorw problems type "lha" and the commands will come up or just mail me
privateky and I'll sort u out =)))

Digitiza the WHOLE series?? That would take up FAR too much space
(even MPEG encoding them would take about 100megs/episode for only ok
quality).

Just video tape 'um - much easier

Hi all,
I was recently browsing through all the AMOS-Lists featured on Amiga
CoverCD's and was really annoyed at the fact that they contain so much
useless information =((

I won't do an example as you all know what I mean....

Could somebody write a small utility to search one of these files and turn
it into an AmigaGuide document ??

I know someone on the Blitz-List managed this and it makes the document so
much easier to read, navigate and find an answer for your problem.

There is a nice little programme on Aminet called Packmaster which archives

simple, even I can use it.

In fact, I was so impressed with it I re-wrote the author's "pigeon English"

I don't think there is any, just make sure you have powerpacker installed

It does take a while, my upload took over two weeks. So be patient and keep
checking every few days.

Wouldnt it be possible to have the samples available to the user, like
Worms
etc.? That way smaller samples, or no samples could be used on low spec
machines. An "If exists" could be used to check for their existence.
Just a thought.

I have A1200 2/4 Meg and accelerator (total speed. about 30 mhz). I
would like to test it.

Well, on my A1200 040-25mhz running the uncompiled version seems to
be about the same as running the compiled version on a standard A1200.

I'm not sure what the speed comparison would be with your amiga though.

See ya.

Damn damn damn damn damn. I missed it. And after all the reminders on
this list too! You say Rimmers back? Looking back on the last series
I remember Rimmer featured in about half of them while they were
getting rid of him!

Oh by the way,
I included the source in there for you guys, I'm not sure
there's any sense to be made of it, if you look at it let me
know if you have any idea what I was doing, I know and I
tried to label stuff as clearly as possible but it's
got a few tricks buried in there, like one to make the
control all slick and whatnot. The big grey area is
in pasting black over the eaten pellets, it works ok but
it can definately glitch at times, though they are rare
and I know why it happens, just a matter of trade offs
avoiding them would require even more tricks...

Well hope you guys like it as much as folks around here do.
:)
Your comments would mean alot.

Compiler Bug

Steve Eaborn <eaborn@powernet.co.uk>


Anyone know if there is an update to the AMOSPro compiler anywhere that
doesn't give the annoying rounding error when dividing negative numbers,
eg:

-17 / 8 = -3 !!

This only happens in compiled progs, the interpreter is OK.

AAAH!!

Andy,
there are no load pic routines, I loaded the pictures and stored
them in banks, they are all stored in various banks saved with the prog.
I wonder, what Amos ver are you using?
I have Amos_Pro 2.00 using extension
Amos Pro Picture Compactor 2.00

Maybe you have an earlier version. The compiled version ought to
work anyhow, but maybe I messed up and sent you a version compiled without
the Amos.lib included, I'll check that right now...
Yeah that will do it, silly me I sent you all a copy of the game
compiled w/o Amos.library, well I'll send a little updater with just the
newly compiled game in there Ok?

I always thought AMOS rounded DOWN rather than towards zero, so the
compiler would be correct in this case - the interpreter wrong.

I don't know what would happen with -17.0/8.0 though, if converted
integer. I presume -3 again.

You could always take the absolute values before dividing, although
this could be inefficient...

So that's that, David

Amos, Amos CD and more....

Fri Feb 19, 1999 9:32 pm
Pietro Ghizzoni <ghizzo@agonet.it>


Hi!

I'm sorry, but due to a sudden hardware problem i was off-line. :( ... a
bit late but happy new year :)))

It seems that the bad luck is our best friend... due to several problems we
have missed the Christmas date :( I'm sorry, but we doesn't give up. Due
to the recent events and problems we have changed our planes about our
upgrades....a good news for you :)

We've decided to release our upgrades for *FREE!* Yes! You'll obtain the
latest *FULL* registered version of AMCAF, OSDEVKIT, TURBO, POWERBOBS,
LDOS, GUI etc for free! The Amos Developer CD project is aborted since all
the materials will be on-line on the AMOS Factory for FREE download.

The release date is between 2/3 weeks..... i've to collect all the
materials, put them together and upload them. I'll upload the AMOSPro and
Compiler package too.

Thanks to our extensions the AMOS capabilities will be boosted enough to
create really cool and professional Amiga applications, so we can show
to the other that AMOS is always the number one in the BASIC language land.

Another good news is that finally the AMOS sources has been officially
released in the PD trough the clickteam site http://www.clickteam.com
Now AMOS can became a open source project, and everyone can contribute to
its development. (P.S the AMOSPro sources should be on-line soon..... maybe
on the AMOS Factory!)

About the AMOS sources... upgrade them seriously is not possible! :(
Instead of spending time on this shit, is much better expand our
extensions.

Download the AMOS The Creator sources, and finally you'll understand our
opinion... in the A500 period the copper hacks and the custom solution was
the standard, and AMOS was the number one!! Now the situation is different
and AMOS is no more the number one, it's considered a old/stupid software
and the boring Blitz Basic is the new suggested basic solution for Amiga :(
Why? Because the Blitz works in a more OS friendly way! no custom
solutions... upgrade the Amos core into a OS friendly one is impossible,
and so the usage of external extensions is the best solution.

Now is time to start a new generation of Amos software.... we've to show to
the others that Amos is always a good choice. We can do it creating new
Amiga applications wich correctly supports the OS and the users resources.
With the OsDevKit and the new GUI it will be extremly easy.

In the GUI Extension V2 you will find: (Now these aren't promises, but
already working features!! )

- *locale library* support. Now with a simple command you can localize your
programs!

- *drag'n'drop* the extensions automatically detect the icons
drag'n'dropped on your windows, increasing the professional look of your
programs

- *true iconify* Optionally you can activate the iconify gadget in titlebar
of your windows so the user can iconify your GUI! (MUI-like)

- *AppIcons* You can create and handle your own app icons.

- *Improved Image Gadgets* Finally you can delete forever the stupid Gui
Image grabber program!! (YEAH!). Now you can use the AMOS Bobs as gadgets
images! You're no more limited to 4 colours gadgets, but you can use upto
32 colours. Using the Bobs you can change them without remaking the GUI
bank!

- *now 100% PUBLIC Screen support* Now the screen created by the GUI
Extension are PUBLIC, but you can easly change their status to private
and
viceversa. The screens are now responsive i.e you can detect keyboard and
mouse events directly from a screen without a GUI opened!

- *3D drawing support* A simple but usefull 3D lines drawing support.

- *Improved IFF support* The IFF support has been rewritten, and now you
can load a picture in a screen without closing and reopening it. You can
also save IFF(AGA) pictures.

- *eXtra Fast Animation (XFA)* support. Is time to forget the old Anim5/7
animation format! You can use a faster and better format: the XFA. Mainly
used by professional video titler/processing programs it offers great
advantages: greater compression, and faster playback. You can real time
play a full screen 1280*576*256 colours animations at 50 fps on a plain
A1200!

- *Improved Internet Access* Thanks to the new design, the internet access
is very easy. Many commands has been revised, and new cool functions has
been added. For example the nifty Tcp Download command... it allows you
to automatically download a file from the network, using a fast
asynchronous/double buffered transfer routine!

- *many improvements* and bug fixes.....

The extension is ready since December , just the docs needs to be updated!
Rev. Giark get ready!!!

Due to my personal late, now i've to speedup some projects ;) Please read
(and think!) carefully the following lines:


----> Mainly AMOS needs 2 things <------


- new/updated functions (coming soon...)

- *a new reputation!!!!* AMOS is not a crap language, but no one is
demonstrating the contrary!

In the past years i've not seen nothing of real important in the Amos
software productions.... *we need to increase the AMOS reputation *creating
new and cool programs, WE must create a *KILLER *application. During my
forced offline period, i've found a good solution.... there is again a kind
of application not (fully) available... a program wich allows you to easly
upload/download files from Aminet, and mainly support ALL the other Aminet
services. There are *a lot* of peoples wich doens't know how/where upload a
file to Aminet, or how obtain the Aminet charts, rate a program, or perform
a FULL Aminet search. The main goal of our program is to provide a
easy/automatic method to perform the above operations without any specifc
user knowledge... the possibility to upload/download/rate/search files
simultaneously and more.

The user doesn't need to know where and how upload a file.... he'll just
click upload and nothing more. Usually you need different programs to
performs the above operations... a browser, ftp client, e-mail etc... now
we have to clue the basic functions of these programs into one program.

It can be done... it can be done in *AMOS*... it MUST be done!!!

The project name is AmiGate... the AMOS world need something like
this... do you remember Ben Vost and his "fantastic" article on Amiga
Format????
Well! AmiGate is for all the peoples like him!

I hope that you are interested in this idea.. if enough peoples agree to
this project i'll start creating the different working groups (coders,
beta testers, docs etc. etc) I want stress again the importance of this
project... please help me to increase the AMOS reputation.


Excuse me again for my late, but it was a hardware problem! Special thanks
to Rune J. Keller for his continous and great work on the AMOS Factory
site.

Bye!

Ok, sign me up for something, not sure what. In the mean time I will
announce one of my projects which is currently in the early stages - a web
site mirror manager. Ever find you are trying to keep files in half a dozen
sources up to date ? I know I am. I have internet space in several places,
amiga server space, peecee server space, and half a dozen copies of the same
file, and have lost track which is which. This proggie is designed to sort
it all out. It sounds a lot simpler than it is.

In the mean time, lets get the project under way ! Too many people have
already lost interest in too many things amiga.

Super Pac Mania Update!!

Sat Feb 20, 1999 8:24 pm
"Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>



Ok folks,
Here's the deal, it seems every one is having the same problem
with Super PacMania, the screen goes black and it don't never go back.
Well I think I know why. The first thing the game does is pop up it's
title screen, well I packed the Title screens and stored them as banks
which I then just saved right along with the game. It's clear to me that
the game is crashing when it tries to unpack these images. I will
re-write the code so it loads the images from iff files instead. That
shouldn't take a bit adn i'll send out the new archive later today.

Thanks to all for trying the bad boy, hope you haven't lost
faith just yet, the game is dynomite, it'll be worth your time once we get
it up and running, I promise... :)

Thanks,
Scott Matott sXe

GUI

The wait is almost over. I have received the gui extension 2.0. Before you all
start whinging about it, you can't have it. My job is now to create the docs
for it. There are none. It will be a combination of the docs Mush did for gui
1, my tcp docs, and new docs of the new commands. I'll go as fast as I can to
get this version finished so it can be released. Thanks to Pietro for sending
the file along. Now you all know the status of part of the new amos.

As for the extension itself, you'll have to save your old gui extension
programs as ascii and merge them back in. Not a real surprise, to those of use
used to testing new extensions. The amos library and gui library have been
upgraded as well. Off the top of my head, the extension lister showed me quite
a few new commands, some very intriguing. I think we'll all be happy with the
new extension.

So don't bug the team about GUI. I've got it. Feel free to bug me for progress
reports. I'm working on it.

Well met and godspeed,

----------------------------------------
Yep thats what happened with me, just a black out. I didnt get a Guru so It
is possible that the game is still running. I was unable to Ctrl-C to quit,
but that might mean you've disabled Break.

I tried running the source through the Amos monitor, (I've never found it
very useful). Although the screen was blank, It looked like the program was
still running and I could hear a nice drum riff. One time I saw a graphic
asking for which level to play. I entered 1 and the graphic disappeared but
then no more response.
I've loaded the sound sample bank into the Amos editor and had a
listen.....very tasty!

When I read this message I tried to unpack bank 6 (?) to screen 0 from
Direct mode. I just got a black out, so I think and hope you've put your
finger on the problem. Good luck with the game, those sound samples have
whetted my appetite!

No. But there aren't a lot of games. Nine so far I think. But you can hardly

Well thank god for that.
I think a lot of people had assumed that all AMOS development had ceased
(including me). I'm glad to hear that is wrong.

I'm no fan of blitz but I can see why it is recommended now a days. It may
be incredibly buggy and unfriendly but OS friendliness is vital for AMIGA
products at the moment and AMOS is terrible.
The GUI extension obviously helps a lot but my problem is still that the
AMOS Editor is not mode promotable and so basically I can't use it.

Surely there must be some possible hack to get the editor or normal amos
screens to be mode promotable? In my view that is the MOST important update
needed for AMOS by far!

<snip>

Sounds cool. I have an extra request though please!

I need to paste AMOS Bobs/Icons onto a GUI screen but keep the first 4
colours the same to preserve the GUI interface look.
I can't change the palette of the bobs/icons but if there was a way of
pasting the bobs/icons by shifting the bitplanes along by two I could do
it.

i.e. In AMOS the Bobs would use colours 0-31 or 0-63
When pasted to GUI they would use colours 4+ etc.

Is this possible?

Is there a way of changing normal Anim5/7 to this format?

How are we supposed to create animation in it?

To get a new reputation it needs better screen support!!!
GUI and TGE together still don't provide what is needed to create a proper
game on a screen that can be viewed by GFX card owners!

GUI 2

Thanks to a little amos prg or two and a bit of work, the GUI 2 manual is
already shaping up. There are a lot of new commands, but they seem to be
fairly straightforward. Locale looks quite simple, as does the iconify/appicon
stuff.

Yes, I *AM* teasing you all on purpose.

I should have the known commands all put in by Tuesday or Wednesday, then I
will know which ones I have to get Pietro to explain.

I hope to include all needed archives with the distribution version.

Pitfall on the PC

Mon Feb 22, 1999 3:17 am
"Andy \"Mushroom\" Kellett" <mushypd@redrose.net>


Softkey have released a version of Pitfall on the PC, we have just started
selling it at Staples for $10. Softkey havent put it on their webpages yet,
but from what i've played of it at work, there is some serious programming
improvements made to make it even more addictive.

You tell `em Jericho ! What with it being on the PC and all, it must have
taken a good couple of years to code, unlike anything written in AMOS (which

hi!

i just figured out that onelist doesn't like my actual email address.

i've two email addresses but with the same pop server.
that means that i can send/receive emails with either this address

crbynum@metronet.de

or with this address

crbynum@primus-online.de

but both are exactly the same email addresses/server!

so why does onelist act so stupid?

i don't want to change my whole YAM configs, just cos of
some different host names ;((

and i'm sorry that i posted so much whack..

i had to test how i can post messages.. so sorry..

kind regards,

(does someone have to validate all those mails first?)


Hello all Amos fans!

i'm an unknown amos coder.
playin around with amos+amospro
since amos v1.30 came out.

i heard of a new AmosPro and stuff.
but where can i find news, updates etc?

and is there a guide for FD extension?

i HAD (HD crash =[ ) some projects going,
all MUSIC depended (music discs etc).
but i stopped as my IBM DHEA 34331 fucked up.
(maybe one of you guys have one with a discerror?
if yes, please contact me!)

i used the FD extension with the P61.library and
others.. but now it won't work anymore..

the p61.library (i use it b'cos i can play sounds
in fastmemory, that means the samples are in fastmem)
plays some crap wether it's in chip or fastmem.. =/

AND!!!

there's that dbplayer.library..

a shared library for playing digiboosterpro files.
but my problem is, that it needs the AHI MODE code.

i.e: 0x002002 - would be one mode of AHI

but how do i put that into dreg(1) ??
and it needs a audio frequenzy number, i.e: 44.100 or 44100 khz..

how do i tell amospro to put that into dreg(1) so that dbplayer.library
knows what i want?...

can anyone help?

ps: hi chris hodges! machst du noch was?

Regards

Nope, It can't.
The bitplane-DMA is now 64 bit (if in highest fetch-mode) making it four times
faster than ECS - but the blitter is still only 16 bit.

By the way, if the blitter was in 32 bit things like masking wouldn't work
unless we had quad-words (64bit words) and adresses should be dividable by 4
and not just by 2... This would be a very incompatible update... :-\

I had this problem when I bought my monitor and ended up buying a
Scan Doubler, but I guess gfx card owners have no chance :(

I too would love to see Amos Pro's Interpreter/Compiler being mode
promotional. I have tried ModePro (Aminet) and it doesn't work
either.

I recall emailing Chris Hodges about this and the reply was that
due to the way Amos has been programmed, it is impossible to
promote Amos screens :-(

But I'm also sure PAC mentioned something about the Amos source
code being updated and with the help of TGE, Amos screens could
be!

I dunno what's going on now with Amos and I think the latest Amiga
Format CD has source code files to Amos Classic on it! Or was I
just dreaming?

/But could this be answered once and for all:/

*Can we ever have Amos Pro/Compiler on an intuition screen?*

Probably by the sounds of things :(

Looks as though it's extensions only from now on by what I read in

The compiler could easily be made to be promotable, since it is an amos prg
itself. Pietro already has the gui compiler on wb, putting the regular
compiler there is really only a matter of writing the interface.

>*Can we ever have Amos Pro/Compiler on an intuition screen?*

I'd been looking into a prg that would do just that. The probelm is the
command parser. If that could be got around, it would be a simple job to be
able to write the prg on an int screen, then pass the code (merge) to the
runtime editor or something. Any takers for that project?

3D-rotation routine

Tue Feb 23, 1999 10:16 am
"Öyvind Strand" <sbb2794@post.netlink.se>


Hi everyone,

A few years a ago I used to to do some programming in AMOS but now
I've lost my sourcecode disks and I'm looking for a routine I used
to use for rotating wireframe figures.

This makes a circle and I remember using it somewhere in the code:

For DEGRE = 1 To 360
XPOS = RADIUS*Cos(DEGRE)-RADIUS*Sin(DEGRE)
YPOS = RADIUS*Sin(DEGRE)+RADIUS*Cos(DEGRE)
Next DEGRE

I also remember using Data statements with X, Y and Z coordinates,
like this for a cube:

'                     2 ________4
'    X   Y   Z         /|       /|
Data 100,100,0  '1   1/_|_____3/ |
Data 100,100,10 '2    |8|      | |6
Data 200,100,0  '3    | /      | /
Data 200,100,10 '4   7|/_______|/5
Data 200,200,0  '5
Data 200,200,10 '6
Data 100,200,0  '7
Data 100,200,10 '8

Then i somehow used the Draw command to draw lines to the coords'
specified in the Data statements.

I would be very grateful for any help in filling in the gaps.

Öyvind Strand

HELLO!?

Tue Feb 23, 1999 6:45 pm
Craig Bynum <crbynum@primus-online.de>


(does someone have to validate all those mails first?)


Hello all Amos fans!

i'm an unknown amos coder.
playin around with amos+amospro
since amos v1.30 came out.

i heard of a new AmosPro and stuff.
but where can i find news, updates etc?

and is there a guide for FD extension?

i HAD (HD crash =[ ) some projects going,
all MUSIC depended (music discs etc).
but i stopped as my IBM DHEA 34331 fucked up.
(maybe one of you guys have one with a discerror?
if yes, please contact me!)

i used the FD extension with the P61.library and
others.. but now it won't work anymore..

the p61.library (i use it b'cos i can play sounds
in fastmemory, that means the samples are in fastmem)
plays some crap wether it's in chip or fastmem.. =/

AND!!!

there's that dbplayer.library..

a shared library for playing digiboosterpro files.
but my problem is, that it needs the AHI MODE code.

i.e: 0x002002 - would be one mode of AHI

but how do i put that into dreg(0) ??
and it needs an audio frequenzy number, i.e: 44.100 or 44100 khz..

how do i tell amospro to put that into dreg(1) so that dbplayer.library
knows what i want?...

can anyone help?

cos i'll probably start a MOD player project.
with alot of players in one exe file, wich uses some shared librarys
for replay of course.

it would be damn cool if someone is also interested in this project
and would like to help me, maybe with a GUI interface..

the formats i'll probably use are:

protracker      - MOD
digibooster Pro - dmb
Med/Octamed     - med, oss

exotic formats:

destracker      - dtl
player61        - p61
Amiga highest.  - ahx (thx)
SoundFx         - sfx

and maybe more..

so if anyone could help me with some other formats
like coding an extension for that format, can always help!

formats wich i would like to use:

fastracker II   - XM
screamtracker   - s3m
impulsetracker2 - it

some old game replayers like Whittaker, Rob Hubard etc..

if you know more formats, don't hesitate to contact me!

why i want to make a new replayer?

cos all those old players like eagleplayer, hippo, delitracker
aren't up to date ;((...


ps: hi chris hodges! machst du noch was?

rik@riks-room.freeserve.co.uk

Looks like just passing it to the list wouldn't have been such a
bad idea. I mean that's 12 people! thanks for the interest, who new
PacMan and Led Zeppelin could be such a draw! Well anybody who hasn't got
it yet let me know I'll send it your way, adn fo rhtose of you who did
some questions:
1) What kind of systems have you been able to run it on,
what kind of perf. do you get?
2) Name those Zep samples!! Bonus to whoever can spot the
drum loop on the title screen, give you a hint
it is the most sampled drum beat of all time,
Any Beastie Boys fans??
3) Where are you all from? I read users in Denmark, Germany, Uk,
USA and France, wow talk about going global! ;)
Again who knew Zep and Pac could cross such cultural boundries,
but then I guess so does Amiga and Amos!

Ok, but I do want to hear about those samples, also be sure and
give the two player option a run, it's tons of fun, whoever eats the power
pellet can eat the other player! Oh and it has dif Zep samples!!

Thanks again for the interest, spot bugs and I'll prepare to send
it on to the Aminet. Although I am still nervous cause of the copyright
problem. At worse though I guess they ask that I pull it.

thanks,
Scooter d. sXe

Don't worry, it will only appear in the amos-list archive on Aminet and
Amiga Format... And after 5 years or so people probably won't read
it anymore.. :))

More to the point: think before you send a message ;)

I've seen too many uninteresting, empty, chatter, base64 encoded etc

Thanks, yeah there are two samples in the one player mode and two
diff. ones in the two player mode. Since that totalled to 490k with the
intro drum loop I decided not to throw anymore in, although I had dozens
prepared. Incidently if you can folks have a sound sampler you can stick
your own samples in just by replacing mine in the PacSounds.Abk file, the
one player sounds are about 7 secs long and the 2 player are about 5 secs
long.
Thanks again, working on a burger time clone, hope it goes over as
well, though I'm not sure if it can, there's no place for zep samples in
that game. ;)

Andy,
Which OS do you have? If you have WB 2.1+ your system comes with
CrossDos which will let you read PC disks on your amiga, probly they'll
have to be 720k format, anyway then you can copy files back and forth from
Amiga to PC to Internet and back the other way too. Getting cross dos to
run can be a trick, try typing
mount PC0:

in the AmigaShell, if you don't get an error msg. then your miggy
has CrossDos and you can just stick in a 720k PC disk and it will show up
on the workbench.
let me know how it goes,

GUI

I've got the gui guide in rough shape. All the commands are listed. There is a
command index in the back. There are sections, just like the amos manual. I'm
getting there, but there are over 200 commands in the extension, not to
mention the tutorial, installing and other stuff that needs to go in.

I used my extension command lister prg, and a prg I wrote to use that data to
make the first bit of the guide. All commands, listed alphabetically.

Anyone have info on teh location of XFA sytem?

Hi guys.

Sorry for asking non amos questions!

But i have to know if my A1200 can use a ISDN modem?

A friend of mine is selling a Lasat Unique 640i ISDN modem.
Does anyone know if that modem will work on Amiga?

If not, does anyone know where i could post the question and get an answer?
(I guess there must be some general amiga mail lists out there, i just dont
know them!)

Now were at it:
Does anybody know if it's possibel to get a network adapter so i can
connect my A1200 to my PECE?

Regards.

Amigas can use isdn adapters (external onesanyway), but you
won't have any real use for them unless you upgrade your
serial port to a fast one.

You could use a null-modem(not sure abt this one),

There's a better way!
Search aminet for PC2AMI.

It's a parallel or serial network system (You decide if you want to use
parallel or serial)
That way you can controll you'r PECE harddisk from the Amiga!

You get a new device called PC:
You can then do something like:

Dir PC:C/Windows/System

To get a listing of you'r C:\Windows\System directory!

And offcource it works perfectly with Directory Opus. :)

There's a much nicer solution!

Search aminet for a file called PC2AMI.lha

It's a network system like parnet.
But this one is made to connect a Amiga to a PC over the parallel port (Or
serial if you prefer that)

It gives you'r Amiga a new device called PC:
You can then do something like this:

copy PC:C/autoexec.bat RAM:

To copy the autoexec.bat file from the PC to the Amigas ram disk!

It works perfectly with directory opus.
I think this is the easiest way of transfering files between Amiga and PC.

If you get any trouble with it please let me know!
I have been using it over the parallel port for a year now, and i have
never had any trouble with it!

Regards.
Martin Møller.

You wanna use ISDN & amos ? Cool. ;-)

Have you seen the modem (cough, I meant ISDN adapter, it's not exactly using
sound) ? If it has a serial port, the answer is probably,
if it has a parallel port, the answer is possibly, if it is an internal, the
answer is almost certainly not.

Off hand no, but you can get those plug-in-the-pcmcia thingies at about
twice the cost of a peecee one.

Yes, it can. I have an A1200, I use a US Robotics IMODEM and cruise at

There's a program called MultiDOS I found once (off a coverdisk I
think). That should do the business for you. I think there's two main
commands that come with it, PCMountAll which mounts DF0: (and other
drives?) to read PC DD disks (and Amiga disks of course), and the
PCFormat command which formats a disk to PC format.

But I'm working from memory here :)

PS. It's on Aminet. There's probably a load of other similar programs
on there too...

All these solutions to his problems are nice, but aren't we forgetting
that his original problem was not being able to up/download files to
his Amiga, as his net access is via PC? How is he supposed to use
PC2AMI if he can't get it onto his Amiga?

One solution I can see is to serial link the two computers together,
and use Term or equiv. on the Amiga, and Hyperterminal or equiv. on the
PC.

Either that, or find an Amiga owning friend who has WB v2.1 or better,
and to use Crossdos to tramsfer the files to this Amiga, and then use
ordinary Ami formatted floppies to transfer the files to his Amiga.

Hope this helps,

PC to Amiga Troubles!!

"Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>


Our Man SJ walker has the winning point boys, without Amiga to PC
access already it's hard to get PC to Amiga access. (I've used MultiDos
though, it is pretty good and much simplier to set-up than CrossDos,
though CrossDos is more reliable and comes pre-setup on WB 2.1+)
That's why I was hoping poor Andy had 2.1, but as it's only 2.0
for him he's in trouble.
Andy where do you live?? I could send you a disk with MultiDos on
it, it's freeware or shareware at least. That'd save you paying to buy it
from a place.
Maybe somebody could send him PC2AmigaNet (the parallel port
solution) that'd be even better since swapping sloppies can be slooowww...
and prohibitive, no files bigger than 720k.

Well I let him know, of course!! Any ideas you guys have are
perfectly welcome, believe it or not when I started writing that game I'd
never even played the original Pac-Man, just a little Ms.Pac in the
Arcades and a few crummy C64 clones, plus the old Atari ver. I had to
rely on alot of input from my friends to get the game as good as it is
now, but anything more you've got to add would be super welcome, esp. you
older kids who grew up during the Pac-Mania days, I'm afraid I missed them
by a few years. :(

oh and he also said:

Good idea, send any replacement sample sets you might get my way
and I'll put together a SPMania enhancer kit with them.

hey that reminds me, come on guys you gotta call those Zep riffs!

You could use Crossdos.... If that is, you do actually mean upload a prog to
the amos list. Simply get crossdos on your Amiga, format a PC disk on 720K
(If this doesn't work try covering the corner hole with tape. Then mount
pc0: on your Amigaand your can copy files to and from your Amiga and PC as
if they were the same platform. Obviously you cannot run the prog on your PC
because crossdos isn't an emulator. i hope no1 moans at me now for copletly

Some brief questions on GUI Extension V2

Fri Feb 26, 1999 2:42 pm
"Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>


As good as it is, the one thing that bothered me about the previous versions
of the GUI extension was that some of it's limitations were derived from
Gadtools. Namely the number of parameters held within a cycle gadget.

Is GUI V2 flexible enough for the user to define these parameters?

Does GUI V2 incorporate the ticked Menu? (something I have asked Ghizzo for
in the past.)

That will do for now I reckon. Thanks for listening.

Declan.

I can't say, because I've not experimented too much. The docs are progressing
and I've got the info on localization from Pietro. It's quite straightforward.


You're right in thinking that it's taking a while to do, but the new guide
file will be a programmer's dream. I'm not going to be optimistic and give you

I'm still waiting for info on the XFA package. I am hoping to include all the

Well, I don't want to sound negative, but I think the gfx really could be
better, to be honest (more colourfully shaded anyway).

Um, most issues AMOS games win. (I've written a winner myself - Wizards
of Odd). I'm working on another one as we speak...

I think SPMainia needs more work before it'd win though.

It works fine on my 1200 030/50.

One change I'd make: Some sort of game over thing when your last man dies.
It's a bit abrupt, going right to the title screen as soon as you die for the

Variable problem.

Sat Feb 27, 1999 10:22 pm
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


I have an interesting problem, folks. Here goes:

I'm using a 'command line' in an AMOS program I'm running (input a string
of characters, or more specifically commands, into a string like CMD$).
Now, if the user says 'set <variable> <value>', I want to be able to set
the named variable to the value they give (assume the variable exists).

Right now, as I said, I'm reading in a string, and then I parse the string
for the variable and the value (VAR$ and VAL$). Here's the problem (using
this method): How do I change the ACTUAL VARIABLE when the NAME of the
variable is in the string? Varptr() prefers pre-typed variable names in the
program and doesn't seem to like any substitues. Also, I couldn't say

Varptr(VAR$)

as that'll give me the address of the string, not the variable. I want the
address of the VARIABLE so I can change it's value. Any ideas on this?
Remember, what I want is basically 'set <variable> <value>'. If anyone has
a solution or a better method than what I'm using, my box is open. Thanks!

OK, I'm guessing that that would be impossible to do.

The only way I can think of is just having ALL you variables as an array
(eeep!), then just enter the no. of the array in the command line.

Very fiddly, but the other way is:

if var$="a" then a=value
if var$="pa" then pa=value
if var$="lev" then lev=value

Yikes! both not very good, but there the only way I can think of.

Just wondering, why do you need to do that?

See ya.

Been there, heard this; would probably be the EASIEST suggested method.

Although this is obvious, it's exactly what I want to avoid.

One reason was inspiration from writing my CBATNAM demo (with the
possibility of future implementation in a game I may write), and secondly
was because I wanted to: it's been done in Quake II, so why not in AMOS?

its because AMOS is an implementation of BASIC, which likes all the
variables to be writen into the editor before the program is run, not
handled dynamicly like that.

Small Idea.

Sun Feb 28, 1999 11:43 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

Ok, I've had a little idea:

I'm just doing the credits for a game I'm writing for an AF readers game,
and I've drawn a picture of me to go into it.

The only problem is, I look a little lonely on my own, so I thought that if
I could get some self portraits off you guys I could stick'em all on the end
of the credits standing together with a little add fo the AMOS list or
sommin (like, say, 'AMOS: the TEAM spirit').

Silly idea, I know, but its getting late............ . . . .

Anyway, if anyone wants to, I've included the siluette of my figure so you
can get the palette and the size right, just email your characters and I'll
paste them on. (There supposed to be in full colour though, i just saved
mine in b&w to make the file small so I didn't get complaints about flooding
the list with junk ;)

Well everyone, how about it ;)


See ya.
