I am glad people are joining the list again.  There are about 31 signed
up out of 140 from the old list.  Perhaps the rest will join us this
weekend.

The list is automated (you can subscribe, unsubscribe, receive digests
by going to the site http://www.onelist.com) so that is one plus.  Also,
the subject line contains [amos-list] so you can use your mail program
to sort it out of the other email.

If you have questions or problems, just email me.

From: "Stephen Lebed" <slebed@ix.netcom.com>

I'm glad to see this new list up and running.  It seems like the old list
was running out of steam.  Maybe this time only the people who really care
about Amos will sign up.

First up:  How is the development of AmosPro3 going?  I'm very interested in
working with a beta version if there is one.

Second:  I don't have a monitor that can sync down to television scan rates,
so the Amos Pro2.0 interface can not be displayed on my monitor.  Is there a
way of mode promoting it?   Will Amos Pro3's interface but able to run on a
graphics card?  I'm currently using a Cybervision64 card.

Third:  Is there a way to write Amos Pro games for a graphics card with 8,16
or 24bit depth graphics?

Thanks all,

Stephen Lebed

yeah, maybe we can have a real conversation without some lamer moaning too
much about mail size or content, hehe!

Discussions are still taking place as to what will go into the final
product, as to what exactly should be added/removed/improved. Keep tuned to
my webpages for more info.

> Second:  I don't have a monitor that can sync down to television scan

There does exist a program which copies the intuition editor onto a regular
PAL screen, which can then be promoted to any other screenmode. This is
still experimental, and with work under way, probbably not available for a
while yet.

> Third:  Is there a way to write Amos Pro games for a graphics card with

yep, use the GUI extension V1.7

The mail method it uses for delivering is ofdd, it almost seems as tho some

X-Status: 

From: "Russell Wild" <casarojo@email.msn.com>

Hello,
	I've just joined this mailing list, so I thought I'd better introduce
myself. My name is Russell, and I am currently studying for A-Levels with
the aim of being a software developer.
	Unfortunately, I had to leave the Amiga about 2 years ago, and enter the
widespread world of the PC. This was mainly due to the fact that the
computer science course I am doing is based around IBMs. Now I've nearly
finished this course, I am free again to spend more time on the Amiga side
of the computer world, which is by far the best!
		I had a lot of experience with AMOS Pro, and if it wasn't for that I
probably wouldn't be as good at programming as I am today. No other system,
to my knowledge, has a system quite like AMOS which is a shame.
								I hope you can help me to catch up with the latest AMOS happenings.
I am particularly interested in the supposed development of AMOS Pro v3.0.
If anyone knows how I can contact the people involved with this project, I
would be grateful. I would be very interested in a possible port to the IBM
architecture, as this would not only give the PC an easy programming
language, but it would also widen the Amiga's developer base. Surely this is
a good thing? Also, if anyone can give me a rundown on this proposed OS4 and
OS5, I would be grateful.

Thanks,
Russell

YAM2.0 crashes all the time, but YAM1.3b is nice, It doesnt use pics
but Ive NEVER had any probs with it, Ive been using it for about a year now
EVERY day and never had a crash. Also it always got all mails without any probs!

Also it takes little mem about 50-100k, so you can keep it and a decent browser
open at the same time!

Do you want it ?
its about 300k I think.

>BTW, to get this message took a lot of hassle....

Well, I get all mails no probs with YAM1.3b give it a try !

Status: RO
X-Status: 

From: Magnus.Sjoberg@asdo.se

First of all a big round of applauds (?spelling?)
to Michael Cox for the fast recovery of the AMOS-list.

Over to buissnes:
Here's two new compiler (w/wo patch) bugs I've found.

1/
Pop Proc[value] will compiled always return 0.

2/
A complex multi-level function like
P$=Mid$(Str$(Max(Int(P(Gui Read (WNR,0))-P#),0)),2)
             Î
             Fails here and will always return 0.
             when compiled.

It'll work if I split it like this:
T=Int(P(Gui Read(WNR,0))-P#)
P$=Mid$(Str$(Max(T,0)),2)

Seems like the compiler can't handle more than a
three-level function!?

Usually they have an address (email or snail mail) that you can write to
in the Product Review section of the magazine.  If not, write/email the
editor or anyone listed in the front of the magazine.

What I do is make up a bare bones floppy (startup-sequence, devs, c, l, libs,
fonts dirs - all empty) and boot from that. If it works, you're laughing.
Remember to use the preboot menu (both mouse buttons) to shut off your hd so
it won't look for any files there. Also, you can use snoopdos to see all the
files your program is looking for when it runs.

Depends on the kind of product. Best thing to do for starters, is to get
the Amiga websites interested, like Amiga.org and other related sites, then
get them to include an article with a link to screenshots/info/demo
versions. Most Amiga news sites always print my stuff.

     In the not so distant future I am releasing my first shareware product

     Besides my executable program, docs and example files what else would 
     I need to include?  My program makes heavy use of the GUI extension.
     
     How can I make sure that my program works on another persons machine 
     without fault?
     
     Any other information on this subject would be greatly appreciated.

	Hello everybody again

	Just to say I'm here too.
	I'm also finishing another game. It is a game based on the old atari 
2600 infamous fire fly game , where you are a frog and have to jump-
tongue around to eat the flys.
	It features several levels and a number of different bugs , anyone 
interested in playing? ( It can be played by four frogs at the same 
time in the story mode and in the 'battle'mode , the frogs beat each 
other in a cool way...)
	anyway , drop me a mail if you are interested or wait a bit for a 
demo or the full game
	See ya everybody!

From:	Sasu Lintula <samali@utu.fi>

Hi, 
After finishing my game, Hooked!! (not yet on aminet, still struggling,
eh), I have thought to write a some kind of pinball construction kit. The
final game should have capability to build pinball tables similar to those
21st Century -games. Do you think I'm mad? At the moment I think so;-),
but I have already seen dreams of it, so maybe I have to try to write it.

What I need to know is what would you like to see in that kind of game or
would you like to see it at all?

SLin

I used to like playing with Pinball Construction Set for my C64, I think it
would be cool to see one for the Amiga.  I'd only thing I didn't like about
PCS was there were no ramps, and the table was only one screen big.  It
would also be great if you could make animated score displays too!

sucky Win95 lets you use the long filenames for uploading. Give it a try
anyways, all they can do is deny it. Surely aminet would recognize even a
.rea file. If not, i can do it for you.

Hello,

I'm going for a complete rewrite of the extension-lists at my site, I'll
also be moving them a bit around at the same time..

The new listings will be frame-free and with as little graphics as 
posible, unlike the ones I have now. More speed, less looks you could say.

Now does anyone have something they'd like to be able to see on such a
listings that I'm not allready showing ?? I'd like to have some new ideas
to work with..

Thanks in advance...

X-Status: 

From: Declan_Gorman@modusmedia.com

     
     I have a problem where I use a PeeCee in my place of work for all of 
     my internet access.  Aminet insists that a .readme file is required if 
     the upload is to be considered for the archive.  As you all know 
     PeeCees only recognise a 3 character extension which basically means 
     that I am unable to submit to Aminet.  Any ideas how I might overcome 
     this?  Besides getting my amiga online, which is not an option at this 
     time.
     
     Thanks in advance.
     
     Declan.

I wouldn't mind seeing it, having played pinball brain damage, which is
quite lame IMHO, anything new pinball wise would be great.

Yeah, Try this:

Upload your readme file to AMINET with a 3 letter extension,
then AFTER uploading RENAME the uploaded readme file, for it to
end with '.readme'.

It allows anyone to pull up a list of related links to the webring, in this
case, other AMOS pages, so they have a variety of pages to go to. Click on
the LIST part on my webpage to see all the sites available.

Cool, noted. It'll be there (Proberly in the 'index-file' ;-)

I'm considering to make a FAQ for extensions also (NOT for each one, but

It is allowed to use ".rea" -files when uploading files to Aminet if you
are using PeeCee.

That would be nothing like PCS:-)

Main problem of building pinball table is its dimensions; ball can go
under and over objects. I have thought to solve this problem by using
sprite priority control with bitplanes (f.ex. sprite has priority greater than 
than bitplanes 0,2 & 4 and smaller than bps 1 & 3 when using screen
with 5 bitplanes. This is fast method of hide ball under certain objects
but it means that I have to use smaller palette. 

Should I use bobs to gain more colours? I'm afraid that would be too slow?
 
BTW: Could someone tell names of all those objects laying on pinball
table in english, of course:-0

A listing of all the commands would be nice.  There was a command (I
think) in the Range/Shuffle extension that would list all the commands.
I think AMCAF has it also.

The thing that first shoots tha ball out is the plunger
The things you hit the ball with are the flippers
The two things at the bottom that send the ball back and forth are called
kickers
The round things that knock the ball around are called bumpers
The thing that you go through and it spins is called a spinner
The things you can hit and they fall down into the board are called
knockdowns.

I am looking into expanding my A1200 and a vendor wrote back saying:

We have a tower system that will solve your problem.  The Ateo Tower
system with their Pixel64 Graphics board.  It is a 2 Meg graphics card
on an ISA type  bus system that Ateo has developed.

I was wondering if anyone has an Ateo Tower system with a Pixel64
graphics card?  Does AMOS still work with it?  Anything not work with
it?

Thanks.

Any Zorro card!  Ateo Tower system (with the Ateo bus board) use ISA slots
instead of Zorro slots.  They are supposed to have a full line of cards,
like 16-bit sound card, ethernet and stuff.  Check it out at
http://www.ateo-concepts.com/ to read all about it.

X-Status: 

From: "Cox, Michael D" <michael.cox@eds.com>

I was wondering if anyone has the Toshiba MK3205MAV 2.5", IDE, 3.2GB
drive in their A1200?  Some say it is EIDE (I assume the A1200 can
handle this).

I am upgrading my system (I may not get a tower as all it does is give
me a graphics card and might require me to have 2 monitors) as you can
tell by my recent messages.  Speaking of towers and graphic cards,
anyone using them?  I'd like one that uses 1 monitor for all screen
modes (PAL, NTSC, etc.).

Please email me off-list as this really is way off-topic except for:

I have not tried the FD extension but was going to look into it as it
seems to give access to lots of external libraries.  How well does it
work, etc?

Yeah, those commands are out of the turbo extension, 
which is by the author of Powerbobs, it is unsupported now though !

X-Status: 

From: Andy H <geosync@ozemail.com.au>

Hi all,

I just loaded a program from Amos 1.36 and some of my commands have
turned to Extension I etc.
Are there extensions for the the following commands?....
a) Comp Test On / Off - speeds up execution of compiled prog/disables
sprites etc.
b) Multi Yes / No - switches multi tasking on and off
c) Plot - but faster version
d) Draw - but faster version
e) Point - but faster version
f) Polygon - but faster version
g) Tile Paste - but faster version
h) Vbl Wait (x) - to set the raster line
I`ve heard that the Turbo Ext may have some of these but I`ve also heard
you can only get the demo version which doesn`t compile, and it`s not
possible to upgrade to full version because it`s no longer supported. 
Is this true?

Seeya,
Andy H.

use:

assign "Value:" to Dir$

Dir$ will always be the current directory you loaded with unless you
changed it beforehand.

Hmm, IFAK those are called 'drop-targets' and the ones that won't fall
down just 'targets'. Won't argue with you about it though.

We've also got:
Ramps, I doesn't need to explain that one, do I.
Lanes, Those on the outside of the kickers guiding the ball to the
flippers
       or out of play.
Gates, Often seen on older pinball games. Redirects balls in lanes/ramps
       to other lanes/ramps.
Button, A switch on the pinball-table the ball can roll over.
Locker or Trap-hole, A pit in the pinball-table. Ball-speed has to be
right
       for ball to stay. Has a kicker to eject the ball.
Kick-backs, Ball-savers in the outer lanes who kicks the ball back on to
       the table.
Lamps whith a char are often reffered as 'Letter', others with the
actual
text written on them. One with a number or nothing at all are called
'Led'.

Maybe I can recall some more later.

Subject: [amos-list] Getting the system date in AMOS
Status: RO

From: Joona I Palaste <palaste@cc.helsinki.fi[REMOVE.ME.TO.ACCESS.E-MAIL]>

Just for a funny turn, I thought I'd tell you how I can read the system
date in my AMOS games "Mr UFO" and "RoboQuest". AMOS has no standard
command for this. I've heard it can be done with some memory functions,
but I couldn't bother doing this, so I "cheated". Here is what I did:

If Exist("c:date")
  Exec "c:date >t:date.tmp"
  Open In 1,"t:date.tmp"
  A$=Input$(1,Lof(1))
  Print "The system date is: ";A$;"."
  Close 1
Else
  Print "c:date does not exist."
End If

Sorry for the AMOS thingy, but the newsgroup IS
comp.sys.AMIGA.progammer and not either
comp.sys.amiga.C.programmer or
comp.sys.amiga.ASSEMBLER.programmer. =)

Assembler or a language such as C or C++?

Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Alastair Murray" <malcolm.murray@virgin.net>

With all these new amiga developments going on I can't help wondering
how it's going to affect AMOS. I  looks like the 68k processors are
going to be even more out of date quite soon.
PPC looked like the next step but now it seems amiga is taken a
different path... again.
How is the new amos going to work with all these changes?
I get the impression that by the time it is even completed it will be
made old again (like it was when AGA came along).
Is there no hope of it being able to produce code for new processors
or is it forever stuck with 68k short of a total rewrite?

Greetings from the Lone Star state (of Texas).

Hello all. I've noticed the List has gone through a few things the past
couple of weeks, and fortunately I got my end all straightened out right
before I moved, through a little help from Mike (the List Admin.) Thanks.

Just wanted to say a quick 'Hey' to everyone (that's still left, heh) now
that I am moved to my new location. All that's left is reading this mail!

Yes, it is Turbo Plus+, just as Peter mentioned. It is true that it's no
longer supported, however I do have a copy (registered coverdisk copy) that
I obtained from Chris Evans for a nominal fee. I could do the same if you
and give you a copy if you need it. Mail me if you're interested.

No not mad, just insane. :) No, really, sounds like an interesting idea.
Believe it or not, several weeks ago I started kicking around the idea for
a new pinball game (written in AMOS) as my next project (this was after
playing Digital Illusions' Pinball Dreams after several hours). Atm, it's
just an outline with some graphics, but it seems to be coming along. If
anything does comes of it, I'll let everyone know. The game style, btw,
WiLL be very similar to the pinball games made by 21st Century (ibed).

Well, that's how things begin my friend, they are dreamed. As far as a
Construction Set goes? Well, what's already been mentioned on the List
sounds good, along with an intuitive interface (GUI Ext?) and the ability
to load large tables. Of course you'll have to have a system or a program
that will LOAD and RUN these tables (hint hint). If my pinball idea comes
along, perhaps I'll add support for your tables, so long as you give me an
idea on approx. filesize, table format and how they're laid out and such.

Hi all,

	I am writing to ask if anyone knows a way to make screens see through or a
colour transparent when you use screen display so that I can make the
background colour Black see through eg.  There is a screen with a picture
of a face for example and on another screen there is a picture of a room
(like in the game Dune, the first one) And I want it to be able to see
through that screen to the other on.

Thanks 

PS It's good this is back

	Hopefully the new AMOS will be 100% system-friendly and will
also
	be avalible for different processors. A correct written code
without 
	dirty hacks will work on future OS.
	 
	A compiler that can produce code for 68k/PPC/x86 would be nice
too.

	As for GFX/SFX I beleve it's important that RTG and AHI support
	are implemented.

	Regards

I use 3.0 and AWEB 3.0b, I subscribed to this list with aweb, with 
no probs and the page looked fine. I didnt check with aweb 2.0 but
Ive used it before and it displays a lot of pages wrong.

At the moment I'm using Amos Classic 1.36, so there are no Intuition
support. Maybe writing this game will take so long time that I can finish
it with AmosPro V3 (hurry, hurry).
At the moment my editor can handle Tables sized 320x512 in 64 colours.
I'm not sure if that is best size for tables but at least it works for me.

I was wondering if anyone uses AWeb and has problems viewing the
subscribe URL (http://www.onelist.com/subscribe.cgi/amos-list)?
If you want to view past messages, you can go to
http://www.onelist.com/archives.cgi/amos-list and take a look.  I will
also be uploading them monthly to Aminet as usual.

Also, now if you search on the Amiga Web Directory
(http://www.cucug.org/amiga.html) for AMOS, it will bring up the
subscription URL for the mailing list.  This should help bring AMOS back
into the spotlight some.

Anyone upgraded their A1200 to OS3.1?  What exactly does it involve, is
it worth it and does it affect AMOS?

Thanks.

I was thinking ROM but I did not know if it was possible in the A1200 (I
thought they were not in sockets on the A1200).  It is good to hear that
the just software option is not a problem for AMOS.

AMOS Creator is v1.36, AMOS Pro is v2.0.  Easy AMOS is v1.01.  I think
Turtle Lightning Software has a used AMOS Pro v1 (you have to buy the
compiler to get v2.0) for sale about $17.  His email address is:
turtleguy@apex2000.net

>and is AMOS now capable of NTSC operation without lots of trouble ?
NTSC works fine on AMOS Pro v1 and newer and works fine on AMOS Creator
as of, what, v1.31 and newer?  I can not even remember what problems
there were with AMOS Creator and NTSC.

While I am here, if you have an AMOS web page you should register it
with Amiga Web Directory.  It may help bring traffic and new users.

     I was reading through the AMOS Pro compiler manual last night and am 
     wondering if the section about using the AMOS sprite still needs 
     stands?
     
     As my program uses the GUI extension and therefore nowhere to place 
     the AMOS sprite, would it be enough to say in my documentation that 
     the program was coded with AMOS Pro?

Hmmm.. I coulda sworn you were one and the same for the amiga reviews page. 
Ok...Yup got you confused with Barrett..

Going by that review (if the amiga ever gets back off the ground, it 
probably wouldn't hurt if someone wrote a better review) it says AMOS is 
pretty well worthless. And the other reviews Amos Professional this one is 
a mini-review, doesn't say a lot.

Amos PD-CD 
 There is a party of dedicated AMOS users, however, that
are looking for the rights to obtain the source code and continue providing
free PD upgrades.

Any idea what the status of the above statement is all about ? That came 
from the Amos PD-CD review.

Oh the review that says the worst is the AMOS review.. It talks 
specifically about The Creator 1.2.

Hi All,


   This is a routine I wrote as an example of using transparent screens
in AMOS, and it shows how to stop two important bugs in amos' handeling
of them.


   This is just a demo of a cool pattern effect, but you could use 
them as anything.


See ya.

use the Flash command, I dont remember exacly how to use it
its something like 'Flash <colourNo>,(RGB,speed)' , check the AMOS
Pro help or your manual.

> o. How Do I fade a PackedScreen (ABK) in ?

use this code:

Dim AMT(32)

screen open 0,320,256,32,lowres
screen open 1,10,10,32,lowres
screen hide 1
screen hide 0
unpack <bnk> to 0

'store palette
For X=1 To 32
    AMT(X)=Colour(X)
Next X 

'change the palette to black
Palette 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

screen 1 
for x=1 to 32
    Colour X,AMT(X)
next x

screen show 0
screen 0

fade <speed> to 1

(end)
There might be a easier way, and I havnt tested this. If you need some
comments or more info in the code just ask !

There is a option in the compiler settings to remove it from compiled code.

Have a look at the fonts section of your manual, I forget coz I havnt

A mere mention is probably fine.  Besides, the AMOS sprite looks cheesy,
no matter how you use it.

Subject: [amos-list] How about a new language?
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Stephen Lebed" <slebed@ix.netcom.com>

I've been a fan of Amos Pro for a long time.  I've been on the Amos mailing
list for as long as I can remember.  Everyone on this list has their own
reasons for staying with this language for as long as they have.  I stay
because of its ease of use.

We know that the language is been looked at for a possible rewrite, but with
all the legal hassles and strange coding it can take a very long time to see
something come out of it.

What about the idea of us creating our own programming language?  I'm not
asking this lightly, I know what it would take to even begin a project like
this.  We could tailor the language the way we need it.

For example:

Making it OS complient
Have the code compiled for specific processors
Add commands that are core to the software for speed


Its everything we've been wanting in an upgrade to Amos, and it may take as
long a time to write our own from scratch than to rewrite AmosPro.  But, the
code would be ours.  We could port it to any platform we chose to.  I'm not
sure if there is any money to be made doing this, other than the fact that
we might make money from the resulting software we would write using it.

Let have a serious discussion on the matter...

AMOSPro is written in Assembler. I don't renember which compiler was used.

The official AMOSPro homepage is www.seta.it/amos

The bob you make (or bobs) must be lores 4 colour, or it won't work. The
colours are:

colour 0 - transparent, never mind
colour 1 - highlight, brightest colour, "Colour 17,$AAA"
colour 2 - body, medium colour, "Colour 18,$999"
colour 3 - shadow, darkest colour, "Colour 19,$555"

Subject: [amos-list] Amos & Arexx
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Declan_Gorman@modusmedia.com

     
     I am trying to incorporate Arexx into my program and have a question. 
     
     The Amos Pro manual has a few pages on Arexx but there doesn't seem to 
     be a command for sending a message to an Arexx port.  It does have a 
     command to receive an Arexx message, which is not want I want to do 
     within my program.
     
     Here is the scenario......
     
     I want my program to pass information to another program and this is 
     how I envisaged it happening.
     
     My program --> Arexx Script --> Another program
     
     Is this the correct way to go about it or should I read up more on 
     Arexx?
     
     Any help would be greatly appreciated.
     
     Declan.

You should consider to use the LDos extension for the Arexx, it's much more
powerfull than the build-in Arexx. LDos can be found on AmiNET or on my
homepages... ;-)

Just to make sure everyone has got this:
You can put new values in registers 17,18 and 19 to change the colours of
the mouse to your needs, this both goest for the default mouse and the
one you define ;-)

It works perfect. I have done a quite large program this way myself, so if you
want any information let me know.

The command you're looking for is 'Arexx Answer' The AMOS Source could be
something like:

    Arexx Wait

    If Arexx = 2
        Arexx Answer 0,ANSWER$
    Endif

Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Russell Wild" <casarojo@email.msn.com>

Hello,
	You've come up with exactly the same idea as I had recently! I wanted
originally to do a Windows 9x port of AMOS, but now that I have found out
that the source code is 100% assembler it looks doubtful.
	I am not a professional programmer (yet), but I am very proficient in
Windows C++, particularly MFC. I already have _some_ code which could
contribute to such a project, for example expression resolving routines,
advanced string handling routines etc.

I would love to have a go at this project, especially now I know others are
interested. Let's start discussions! Perhaps we should first think up a
title for the project so that we can separate it from the straight AMOS
messages. How about AMOS-RPL (AMOS Research Programming Language)?

Some ideas I came up with are:
1) NO emulation. This is what ruins a lot of systems so if the Amiga can do
something the PC can't, no attempt should be made to emulate it unless it
can be done so seamlessly.

2) The basic OS commands such as (?) OpenWindow, AddGadget etc should have
the same parameters on both versions so that code doesn't need to be
altered.

I hope we can do this, and I am sure we can if we all try a little,
Here from you soon,
Russell

Hey Jack,

How's Wang?

There a program on the Amos1.36 called "execute.amos".  To use it go to
the bottom of the proggie you want to use it in, click so the cursor is
at the end of the program, select MERGE and load the file
'execute.amos'.

To use it anywhere in the program type...
{assuming the AmigaDOS command "assign" is at "sys:c/")

  EXEC["sys:c/assign <new device> <desired directory>"]
  If Param
     Print "Command sucessful!"
  Else
     Print "AmigaDOS command failed"
  Endif

Hope this works :)

	By experience I know that using "Sys:c/Assign" isn't reliable.
	I would suggest you to use "C:Assign" instead.
	The assign should refer to PROGDIR: since that's where your
	program was started. I'm not sure if PROGDIR: exists on KS 1.x
though.

Subject: [amos-list] Bobs, colours and backgrounds...
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Zangiacomi Sylvain <szan@club-internet.fr>

   Hello All,

 I've got a problem with bob's colours. I'm trying to create 
a car game, like Overdrive (is it possible ? :-).

My background picture is 32 colours - OK no problem -
My bobs (the cars) use only the 8 first one. So, to save chip 
mem, I made my bob bank with 8 colours for the bobs.

 BUT... When I put these bobs on the background, their colours 
change when they are displayed on a zone which contains the 32-8 
other colours.
This problem doesn't appear, of course when I save my bob bank 
with 32 colours for bobs.

 The question is simple : is there any way to keep a 8 colours 
bob bank with a more than 8 colours background ? or is it necessary 
to add the 32-8 last  colours in the bank to avoid colour interferences ?

 Maybe, one of you has already met the problem, so ...

Tao, Sylvain

Your bob has 3 bitplanes, your screen has 5. When your bob hits the screen,
it's going to replace the 3 first bitplanes and leave the other 2 unchanged.
That's why your bob's colours are altered (the screen pixels haven't been
completely replaced by the bob's pixels, only their lower layers have).

So you've got to find a way to empty the last 2 bitplanes of the screen, at
the bob's location. To the best of my knowledge, that's no simple task. 'Set
Bob' could have worked, but unfortunately it doesn't. I guess you have to Doke
to Phybase(3) and Phybase(4) or something. Anyway it's going to be horribly
complicated and slow.

I think there are but 2 solutions:

1) Arrange to display your 8-colour bobs only on background drawn using the
first 8 colours of the screen. 

2) Draw your bobs in 32 colours... they'll be prettier :-)


Oh by the way, I'm new here, so perhaps I should introduce myself. I'm a
French AmosPro coder, and I live in Paris. I've made several games, the last
of which is to be 'unveiled' very soon. It's gonna be a huge shock to you, so
brace yourselves :-)

Greetings to all,

Bernie

You can generate the script to a temporary file, and then use the
Exec "rx "+scriptfilename$ command.

On 1.3. you can use directly the Dos.library/AssignLate function with the
=Doscall() Amos function.

   NAME
        AssignLate -- Creates an assignment to a specified path later (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
        success = AssignLate(name,path)
        D0                    D1   D2

        BOOL AssignLate(STRPTR,STRPTR)

   FUNCTION
        Sets up a assignment that is expanded upon the FIRST reference to
the
        name.  The path (a string) would be attached to the node.  When
        the name is referenced (Open("FOO:xyzzy"...), the string will be
used
        to determine where to set the assign to, and if the directory can
be
        locked, the assign will act from that point on as if it had been
        created by AssignLock().

        A major advantage is assigning things to unmounted volumes, which
        will be requested upon access (useful in startup sequences).

   INPUTS
        name - Name of device to be assigned (without trailing ':')
        path - Name of late assignment to be resolved on the first
reference.

   RESULT
        success - Success/failure indicator of the operation

Just looking for the best buy. I assume Amos pro would be the choice getting
started with Amiga basic this late in amigas history. Can someone provide
places to get it ? Oh yeah only info I have on the editor is a demo I found on
Aminet set 1D. By any chance does Amos now work with NTSC, with the entire
screen in view ? Or must we suffer using PAL on NTSC machines ?

I have it (I bought it from F1 Software in UK).  I do not think it is
worth getting as it does not have much capabilities.  I found I was
unable to do much, if anything, with it.

Buy AMOS Pro and buy AMOS Pro Compiler.  Contact the guy at Turtle
Lightning Amiga Software  (turtleguy@apex2000.net) as he said he had a
used copy of AMOS Pro for $17.95.  You can buy the compiler from Mushy
PD (http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk) for $23.50.  Or, post to
comp.sys.amiga.marketplace and programmer asking to buy someone's used
copy of either.

AMOS Pro works fine on PAL and NTSC.  No problems at all.

X-Status: 

From: "Cox, Michael D" <michael.cox@eds.com>

I was wondering if anyone has experience in writing a TCP/IP program in
AMOS?  I'd like to connect to a webserver and send it an HTTP command
(like connect to yahoo.com and do a search) and get the results back.  I
think the GUI extension allows me to open a TCP: port?  Is that stack
(AmiTCP or Miami) dependant?  Anyone trying this?

Thanks.

Done it in C with the SCSI.DEVICE, not sure how you would do it in
AMOS.  One
thing I know about ASIM-CDFS is that it gives you the tracks in a
variety of
formats (AIFF, Ect ...) so you could play them as a big sample (buffered
off
the disk).  Done that with IFF samples on the harddisk.

usually only install the sprite grabber , sample bank maker and the

GUI Extension rocks for this sort of thing. I've been putting a lot of things
on hold lately, due to company coming over, but I've got a bot written in amos
for irc and Pietro has a demo of a tcp file search.

Well met and godspeed,

Subject: [amos-list] Accessing CD drive?
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: AoD <mcox@access.digex.net>

I am thinking of writing a CD player in AMOS (done it on a PC so I figure I
can do it on the Amiga).  Anyone have an idea as to determine what drive is
the CD?  I wonder if AsimCDFS or AmiCDFS have like an API or something
where you can ask it how many tracks, track length in MM:SS:FF, etc.

Anyone ever done this before?

Thanks.

Michael

Hi!

In AMOS is there a way of stopping it outputing the end of line charicter 
that 'Print #' outputs ?

ie.
Print # outputs:
$setting=D

when I want it to output:
$setting=D

Also for it to be able to input text without the end of line thing ?


thanks

From: Deano@zetnet.co.uk (Deano)

How do I check if a bob collides with another bob. I have seen
commands for sprites colliding with bobs but I am controling a bob
with the mouse (ie: Bob 1,xmouse,ymouse,1) and I want to check to see
if it collides with another bob.

	Easy as pie, use
	Bob Col instead of Sprite Col
	so whatever the syntax for sprite collisions is 
	(I'm not sure off the top of my head)
 	just replace the word sprite with bob.

			Thanks,

> How do I check if a bob collides with another bob.

The 186th page of the manual said:
c=BOB COL(n [,s TO e])
The BOB COL function checks bob number n for a collision wwith another bob.
If a collision has been detected, the value returned in c will be set to -1
(true), otherwise it will be loaded with 0 (false).
Normally the command will check for all collision, but you can specify a
collection of bobs to be tested using the optional range parameters s to
e....

Subject: [amos-list] GUI Extension
Status: RO
X-Status: 

From: Peter Cahill <cahill4@iol.ie>


Hi,

when converting a .gui file to .abk in 
the GUI Extension if I have a 'getfile' gadget, it
wants to put a image over the getfile gadget. (via a .img file)

Is there a way of stopping it from doing this ?

Also for the GUI Paste Bob command, do I NEED to
draw the bob onto a button or something as it wont
draw the image onto a blank space in a GUI window ?

Finally, The Hot Link Converter keeps crashing for me,
when I click on 'Browse' then I pick a .abk file and
it says 'Loading' in the status text gadget and then it crash's 
its a 30k gui file before converting to .abk, is this
file to big or something ?

thanks

	The getfile gadget isn't supported by the 
	GUI Extension and thats why it does like that.
	I beleve it's mentioned in the docs somewhere.

	My guess is that you'll need a big blank button there and
	then import an image. I havn't tried that one though.

Subject: [amos-list] New AMOS + Compiler
Status: RO
X-Status: 

From: "Alastair Murray" <malcolm.murray@virgin.net>

Firstly a suggestion to the people coding the new AMOS. Because of 
all the problems with AMOS now and again I get really annoyed with it 
and consider leaving it to code in something else. Knowing that a new 
version is being produced is very good for keeping me with it but 
when I don't hear anything about it I get a bit disillusioned again.
How about giving us regular progress reports so we know how it is 
going and what it will be like?

Secondly... bloody AMOS compiler.
My program Backbone is getting quite large now and all of a sudden 
AMOS refuses to compile it (with or without GUI compiler). Usually it 
just stops dead 30% of the way through but on the rare occasion when 
it does compile it, the program doesn't work. Errors are also 
reported where there aren't any. Once it even wrote a 10MB file onto 
my Hard Drive, filling it up and then crashing it... then I had to 
spend 2 days repairing it.
Does anyone know what can cause AMOS to stop compiling something? It 
compiles other programs fine. I have tried the long option but that 
doesn't help.
I had to change one of the internal variables in AMOS because some of 
my procedures were getting very long. I can't remember what the 
variable is called, could this be the problem?

Thanks,
-Murray

	Sure is, go to the settings in the compiler and
	turn off the "Create Default Screen option"
	just make sure your proggie creates it's own
	screens, otherwise you'll need to add a
	Screen Open command at the start of it.

I have.  Its called WebView.  My old version (2.1i)( used TCP:, but its
blocking and synchronous, so I rewrote the BSDSocket procedures and posted
them on Aminet (dev/amos/BSDSocket.amos).  They're much better than TCP:.

Ok, How many 'Data' lines do you have?

   I think that the AMOS Pro Compiler crashes if there is more then
64k of 'Data' held in a program. If that's the problem then you'll
have to use memory banks or somthing to store your data's.

   Also, what exactly do you mean by 'internal variable', if its
just a program variable then this won't create a problem.

   Finally, have you tried the compiler shell seperatly from amos?
This could sort the problem out.


Hope you get it sorted out, See ya.

Load the GUI Compiler Shell program, and modify at line 11:

DEF$=" WB NODEF NOERR TYPE=0"

into:

DEF$=" BIG WB NODEF NOERR TYPE=0"


This should fix your crash problem.

No. The gadtools.library (.. and so the GUI Ext) doesn't support the getfile
gadget. (it's a BOOPSI gadget). Just create a button gadget, and attach the
getfile image.

Thanks for the help, but I did what I always seem to do after posting
a problem to the list. I solved it 10 minutes later.
Basically there is a bit that uses too many Else If's. I had to
replace them with lots of normal IFs and now it works.
I think we really need a CASE statement in AMOS 3!

Subject: [amos-list] Arexx
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Alastair Murray" <malcolm.murray@virgin.net>

I've been adding an arexx interface to Backbone and whilst it
generally seems to work great using the GUI Ext to wait for Arexx
Calls now and again the program completely locks up upon executing an
arexx script.
To do this I'd do:
exec "run rx Rexx:Example1.rexx"

Does anyone know what could cause a lock up? I think it is something
to do with exec statement but its quite hard to test programs whilst
usng the GUI extension so I'm having trouble locating it. Especially
seen as I have to reboot each time...

Thanks,
-Murray

Just as an experiment, try opening a new program and type some GUI
commmands in fresh, rather than loading in the program.  I remember
having to do this once for the GUI extension.

I can not figure out how to make it work.  I can do an Add but after

Ive fixed this also,
AMOS Paste bob 0,x,y is the same as:
GUI Paste bob 1,x,y

and in my code i was useing Gui Paste Bob 0,x,y so it was sayinf

	Insert some of those with some info-text between the commands

If you can find a set, they are worth their weight in gold IMHO.
Whatever language you use, underneath it is still the Amiga OS,
and there is no better guide to using it effectively. Just as a
point of reference, a huge number of questions that I see on this
list could easily be answered in detail with the RKM's. Libraries
and Devices portions are the most useful. Hardware is interesting,
but dated, and largely unneeded if you are going for "OS friendly".
The Autodocs is probably not terribly useful, as this has changed
more (and for the beter, I might add) than any other area, and is
probably best obtained via the developer CD.

The majority of 3.x was in place in 2.1, so the older RKM's are
still largely current. Most of the core principals remain constant,
so even a 1.3 Libs and Devs manual can be quite helpful (My printed
copy is 1.3) Earlier than 1.3 is probably pushing it too far.
As for the cd.device, although no RKM was ever issued for OS3 or
beyond, the Amiga OS 'device' abstraction is consistent, and the
explainations of devices within the RKM, coupled with the specifics
for the cd.device, which can be obtained from an electronic copy
of the Autodocs, should be virtually everything one could need.

Even if you never get the RKM's, *get the CD!* It is full of good
stuff that *any* developer for the Amiga should know. The autodocs
are available as plain text, as well as well linked amigaguide
files, linked not only to related doc files, but the include files
detailing strutures, and other nuances as well. Also a valuable
reference are the Amiga Mail articles, the publication of the old
Commodore Applications and Technical Support (CATS) group. The
later articles especially cover some topics not covered adequately
anywhere else. Plus, lots of examples (mostly SAS/C) and lots of
tools for testing and debugging. Although some parts of the CD
can be obtained elsewhere, having it all in one place (and under
one clickable index) is a real godsend.

I should note that the old CATS Developer CD 2.0 had electronic
versions of the RKM's. It was VERY cool, but short of prying it
from the still clutching fingers of a deceased developer, it is
unobtainable. As of the Amiga Developer CD V1.1, Amiga still had
not managed to obtain the rights to the electronic versions,
but hopefully that will be solved, one way or another, soon.

You  could  give  F1 Software a try. Send Phil a demo or better still,
full version of your game for evaluation.

Please  do NOT email it to him without clearing the file size with him
1st of all though :-)

phil@ware5d.demon.co.uk

Or simply send your game into Amiga Format and CU and see if they will
review it.

I'd  also gladly add a link to your web site via mine if you send me a
banner (400*40 max) and some text.

Go to my web site and take a look at my links page to see what I mean.

Contact Amiga Flame first.
"Philip Cosby, Editor of Amiga Flame" <Philip@amigaflame.demon.co.uk>
Alot of people visit there and he may post a news article on your game.
Web Site: http://www.amigaflame.co.uk/

Amiga Nutta is another good one.
"David Flaherty" <dflaherty@nutts.demon.co.uk>
Web site: Http://www.nutts.demon.co.uk/

This is another good person to contact, for "Amiga Games"
"Eddie Ivanov" <eivanov@tfs.net>
Web site: http://www.tfs.net/~eivanov/

If it`s really good try getting this guys attention from Amiga Format.
"Ben Vost" <ben.vost@futurenet.co.uk>

Hope this helps.  The other thing to do is subscribe to all the
international search engines such as Excite, Yahoo, WebCrawler &
Infoseek and imbed some words in a html doc for which you wish the page
to be found by, ie. Amiga Games, games, game, shareware etc.

Seeya,
Andy H.

Could some of you add a link to my site as I want to get my software
known on the Amiga. Anyone who adds a link to my site from theirs will
get a link back from my site to theirs.

Also, please spread the word about my game Mummies Playtime which you
can download from my site (new game- Amiga Section) and let me know
your comments.
