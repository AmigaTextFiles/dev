Description:
 ZShell is a small (36K), fast and powerful Shell with many (68)
 built-in commands. So it replaces most of the commands in the C:
 directory (like LIST, COPY etc.) which saves disk space and
 reduces disk accesses. There is NO way around ZShell for those
 who do not have a hard disk or still have Kickstart 1.2/1.3 !

 But it is very useful for those with a better Kickstart and/or
 hard disk, too, because for example it has powerful editing &
 history, filename completion, pipes, review buffer, some
 Kickstart 2.0/3.0 specific features and a lovely LIST command.

 I have tried to make ZShell compatible to the standard shell, not
 just another UN*X shell clone, but with some features known from
 UN*X shells. I especially have taken care that it is easy to use.

 ZShell is very useful for programmers, because it has things like
 showing EXEC-lists and the task list, memory dumping and other
 things you usually find in debuggers.

 You can switch off the internal command-line-editor to use
 ZShell with console handlers like KingCON.
