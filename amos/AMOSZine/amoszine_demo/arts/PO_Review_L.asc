      Wow  this  one's  colossal,  enormous, gigantic, elephantine, huge,
      immense,  sorry  slight glich in my upper neural thesaurus(TM) net.
      Just when you though Amos developers had packed up & gone home, out
      comes   this   <brain  implant  error...default  system>  big  Amos
      extension from T-Soft.
      
      Donald  Cameron  Liberators developer has pull Amos out of a rather
      nasty  dive,  giving  Amos  a  compete  refit.  What's more he will
      continue to upgrade the liberator as and when the Amiga is updated.
      Donald is also working on a great new utility (now in its beta test
      stage)  that  will  allows  you  to have multi-window, multi-gadget
      intuition  Graphic  User Interfaces up and running under Amos in 10
      minutes.....  Wow!
      
      Its  now possible to write application software, competing with the
      system  orientated  languages such as C "a programming language for
      programmers",  the  only difference being the larger code size once
      complied.   Although  Amos  has  the  advantage  of checking syntax
      errors  before  being  compiled,  I  say  compiled  as a few of the
      Liberator functions only work this way.
@4      So what can the Liberator do? 
@1      
      Well think off any WB program, that's what it can do.  Just as long
      as the task at hand does not require fast machine code processing.
@5
      Anyway  nearly all WB programs just call up library routines, which
      do  all  the hard work.  Even Amos can set up the next library call
      in time uncompiled.
@3      
      All those Amos pro programmers who thought they had the upper hand.
@6
      i.e. through powerpacked files and Animation are no longer so.  
@1
      You  not  only  have access to powerpacked files, but also LH files
      (smaller  LHA type archives) which gives a higher crunch ratio than
      powerpacker.
@4      
      If  your  thinking  of  buying the Liberator to add AGA gfx to your
      games  using  normal Amos graphic commands, then think again.  Amos
      opens  up it own unusual bitmap screens which even gfx rippers have
      a  hard  time  to lock onto.  But there's nothing stopping you from
      opening  up your own custom WB screen and drawing to that using the
      new power form the liberator to create your own gfx drawing system.
      
@4      The  Liberator  comes  complete with its own example programs which
      have  to  be asci merged into Amos, they must of been short on disk
      space.
@1      
      Liberator  comes  in three parts, each of which works independently
      of  the  others.   This means that you do not have to install all 3
      parts  if  you  don't  want  to.   Each  part  fits into a separate
      extension  No.(extensions  21 to 23), all of which are all approved
      by  the  Amos  user group with their own official extension number.
      So  there's  no  change  of it fouling up any of the other official
      Amos extensions.

             requester.library
             prtspool.library
             req.library

@4      The functions are carried out as they are in C.
      In addition, however, you must surround the name by F@1<@1>.
      Function parameters, are passed inside normal brackets as usual.
@1            
      Here are a few examples from the Commodore libraries:- 
      @3      
            VOID=F<waitport>(PORT_ADR)
            TOOL_NME=F<findtooltypes>(TOOLS,TYPE) 
            SUCCESS=F<closeworkbench>
            VOID=F<refreshgadgets>(GAD,WIN,REQ)
      @5      
      Quite straightforward really.
       @6
      For  the  Non-Commodore (3rd party) libraries, the function name is
      also  kept in its original form, but this time you must surround it
      with  F<libname_>.
      @1
      Again here are a few examples:-
      @3      
            RV=F<midi_getmidipacket>(DEST)
            RV=F<arp_filerequest>(FILEREQUESTER)
            RV=F<reqtools_rtezrequest>(WIN)
            RV=F<octaplayer_freeplayer8>
                                       
      @4All  T-soft  documentation  is  given in AmigaGuide format.  T-Soft
      have  also  converted  all  Non-Commodore  library  documents  into
      hypertext format with filenames and links which will integrate them
      readily  into  your  database.   These documents along with the 3rd
      party  libs  themselves have been archived onto a single disk which
      has been placed in the public domain.
      @1         
      On  this  PD  disk you will also find details on how to convert the
      complete  set  of  Commodore Autodocs into hypertext format using a
      great   little   utility   that   does   the   conversion  for  you
      automatically.   The  bad  news  is  that  you are going to have to
      purchase  the Docs from Commodore, all addresses are given when you
      buy the Amos Liberator. 
      @5      
      Once  you  have  purchased  all of the above items, you will have a
      formidable database running under multiview, so its all a matter of
      point  and  click, no looking though vast text files.  I Personally
      had  no difficulties obtaining the extra disks, although the 5 disk
      set  for  commodore  can be worked around if you have a good set of
      hardware  books.   You do however need the extra PD liberator disk,
      it  contains  all  the  extra  WB Libraries which are vital for the
      liberator to operate fully.  


@4      A good one book buy for the liberator would be "Mapping the Amiga",
      ISBN No. is 0-87455-267-2.  (I only wish I had bought this
      book sooner)
