    Last issue Andrew Smith sent in these two Amos Pro bugs. They have
    both been solved by Edmund Clay.

1)  When a MED tune has been loaded any samples that are played afterwards
    are looped continuously.  This shouldn't happen. If you load Soundtracker
    mods everything is fine.

   *This problem has now been solved by Edmund Clay see MED_WITH_SAMPLE.Amos
    in the source drawer for a fix to this bug, thanks Edmund. You will have
    to supply your own med module as there was no room left for the one Ed
    sent us to use.

2)  IFF Animations loaded into a memory bank using the new IFF anim commands,
    will not save with the program. Packed pictures and all other types save
    along with the program fine, why not?

  * This bug also solved by Edmund, see Permanent_iff.Amos



       THESE BUGS WERE FOUND BY EDMUND CLAY, PROGRAMMER OF STARBASE 13
       ---------------------------------------------------------------@1
1. Hardware to screen coordinate conversion takes no account of the screen
   offset. A side effect of this is that bob-sprite collision detection does
   not work properly when the offsets are not zero. (Screen to hardware
   does include the screen offset)

2. Comptest Off is supposed to speed up programs by 10%, reduce jerkiness
   and disable the control-C feature. As far as I can tell it actually does
   nothing whatsoever.

3. It seems to be impossible to do any of the following:

    -Change the default mouse
    -Change the compiler screen colours
    -Change the decrunch colour option for powerpacked banks

4. Loading any sort of bank stops med music.

5. Del Bob x to y doesn't work. This worked before the first Amospro update
   but not since.

6. Interface numerical edit zones return '253' if a minus sign is entered,
   instead of a negative number.

7. When using the Every command, any Wait longer than the update time
   causes an indefinite pause.

                               bugs  or  you have found some bugs of your
                               own  then  send  them  in now and get this
                               list growing.  @1
