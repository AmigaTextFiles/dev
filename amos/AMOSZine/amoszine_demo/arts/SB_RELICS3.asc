I've been asked to conclude the solution to my recent arcade adventure game
release, and I'm happy to grant the request.  Such is a pity that you need
to have someone tell you what to do, but such is an even greater pity you
don't see the final screens and ultimately the ending!  I recommend you
only refer to this solution when totally baffled.  You will still retain
much of the original enjoyment, I'm sure...

 Crammed into an inlet no larger than his own cupboard, Falcon pressed hard
against the metal wall of the mercenary space vehicle.  Pilotted by a foul
space pirate by the name of Jake, he cursed this bum repeatedly over the
promise of a luxury flight to Deldronis.  In silence, Falcon simply waited
for this galactic trash can arrive at space dock.  To breath synthetic air
was a move upward to what he was currently inhailing.
 Jake didn't say much after the deal was struck.  He had is money, and that
is all he cared for.  Once aboard, he kicked the ship into auto-navigation
mode and made himself comfortable in the ship's single chair.  Five minutes
later, he was asleep.
 Some hours later, the ship engaged auto-orbit procedures and a feminine
voice soothed Jake out of his napp.  "Now orbitting Deldronis", the voice
said.
 Jake started to wake, clearing the backlog of drool from his chin, and
instictively hit a small grey button on the dash.  Just as swiftly as the
junky pirate woke, he slid once again into his personal coma.
 The craft began some other planetary procedure, which simply meant more
waiting.
 Eventually, the craft began it's vocal wake up call and again, Jake rose
from his almost horizontal position and started a more complex series of
commands on the dash.
 Falcon wasn't really interested in this mundane protocol stuff, and simply
prepared for another long session of waiting.  It came as quite a surprise
when Jake quickly turned to face him and grinned.  Not more than a second
later, an energy field resembling an early transporter beam, took hold of
his body and held him in place.
 Obviously wanting something to show the family, Jake began prospecting the
items in his coat pocket.  When he found nothing of real value, he settled
for the coat itself and completed the transporter cycle from the dash
board.  Falcon simply phased out of the space craft and into another, more
green scene...With the grass and the trees, and the wonderful plantlife,
Deldronis would certainly quality as green.  But the immediate green was
holding a rather nasty lasergun and pointing at a small man, who had an
altogether different shade of green on his face.
 The green medivian terrorist was certainly going to kill the poor fellow,
and it hardly seemed fair.  What with this planet having too much green
already.  Falcon shot the medivian square in the back, and only remembered
to lower the setting from VAPOURISE to STUN once the terrorist exploded in
a shower of alien dust.  Considering the situation, he felt it was in
everyones interests if he quickly disposed of all it's mates before they
got wind of what he did.  
 The small peasant was clearly greatful, but remained uneasy in the presence
of a man who just disintergrated a creature not more than a foot away from
where he stood.  The nearby water fountain relaxed him alittle, but not
enough to remove his gaze from your laserpen.

Continue, if you will, in the spirit of this brave hero named Falcon as he
rises to the challenge of defeating the evil medivians and save the king
from a quite hidious headache...

                  Use this orb on the evil nasty thing...
@1
You will have cleared the floor of dangerous entities and you can lower the
king to safety.  Before you do this, he calls you in his upsidedown state
to conduct his congratulations speach.  You avoid pointing out he's not
the right way up, and also that he's a dribbling mad idiot who shouldn't
be king anyway.  Instead, you listen and nod, and then walk away.  You don't
usually set free a king when he's just given you your unconditional release
as a royal explorer and promoted you to the guy that picks up beach litter.
Well, Falcon didn't anyway.

Is there a Relics Of Deldroneye II?
===================================
@1
And there you have it folks, the story in full.  Granted, some bits had to
be editted.  I had to trim it abit but I think I did ok.  I've had lots of
nice letters demanding that I set to work on a Relics of Deldroneye II.  I'm
very happy to do so, and pleased so many people wrote with their support,
and so I have set my brain to the task of writing a sequel so fantastic,
so involving, you'd be insane not to pay good money for it.

As I write, over a hundred people have purchased Relics of Deldroneye. Even
though I thought the price point of £6.99 might be too high, you certainly
surprised ME!  The seven pounds was for four disks, as per F1 policy.  We
could have gone to 5 or 6 disks, but the price would have been £8-9, which
was not really a consideration at the time.  You obviously respect the fact
that just because it's in PD, doesn't mean it's not worth more than a few
quid!  I was tempted to increase the number of disks.  Supplying a larger,
more spacious sequel, charging more for it and therfore receiving more for
my efforts.  But alas, I am also as poverty strikened as the next person
and £6.99 is probably alot to some people.  Instead, if a game is to be
larger, why not create it in two parts, or three.  Each game seperate with
it's own perils and rewards, but forming a larger story when played one
after another.  This way, if you feel my imagination isn't as diverse as
your own meanderings, you needn't purchase the next in the series.  I've
had letters wanting a larger sequel.  Probably from the die hard adventure
types who crack a puzzle without even looking at all the pieces.  I'm in
the process of revising the way I plan my puzzles.  I used a process of
using new screens as often as I could.  Letting the game move into new and
interesting areas.  A game such as Monkey Island combines pretty much all
of the screens in one go, offering puzzles that may occur in the same
screen at different intervals in the game.  This creates the disk-swapping
feature that so many adventurers loath, including myself.  In devising the
disk-logic approach in Relics, disk-swaps are virtually eliminated, plus
you get new screens as you solve puzzles.  You should be able to see the
troubles in balancing size of a game with user-friendlyness and quantity of
new screens/people.  It's a balance I have tipped to great success and if
there are no objections, Relics 2 should employ the same method of logic
as Relics 1.  I must point out however, that as its maximum capacity for
graphics and sound is 4 disks, the game will be around the same size.  Any
more disks might push the price point to unmarketable levels.  I suppose
two version could be released.  A 4 disk, reduced-content game.  And the
un-cut version which can use as many disks as it takes.  Several factors
need to be considered with this last point, but I would like to hear from
anyone (at this early stage) about the prospects of varied packages for
the best possible product to be released at a price for everyone.  

Bottom line folks, is that Relics 2 is a while in coming.  Anyone keeping
up-to-date with what Digital Ninja are doing at the moment will know the
development of FORTRESS II is a beast of a project, taking pretty much all
of my time.  The relatively new project (at the time of writing) has been
named SYTHAMOS, and can create and replay music using the Amigas sound
chip.  The main thrust of the package is that it's ideal for game writers,
who have found the limitation of all other music forms and want to control
absolutely EVERYTHING their music does.  Incidently, SYTHAMOS will be
completed by the time FORTRESS II requires the advanced music interfaces
that will allow it to play anything up to 50 music modules, without any
pre-loading and without using an ounce of chip ram!  And for a game that
needs to run on an A500, we need all the chip ram we can save.  Further info
on any of Digital Ninja developments is freely available to anyone who
wants it.

To all those who have bought Relics, a big thanks.  With the recent student
cuts and other legal banter, they cut about £300 off my grant.  I had no
money to spend on Christmas presents, and your combined purchases gave me
enough to buy everyone something very worthwhile.  Beats the trinkets I was
going to have to buy.  Again thanks.
