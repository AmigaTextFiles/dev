@2{How to get Music and Sound Effects for your Games

@4
  Many  AMOS  users  are  unable  to  provide their own sound and music for
  games.   This article is aimed at those `sound-less' users.  I will cover
  getting samples and music from the public domain, and getting a dedicated
  musician to write the musical score for your game.

  Sound Effects
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  @5A game without sound effects is like boiled eggs without soldiers, like a
  programmer  without AMOS, like an Amiga user with an ST...  ALL games can
  be  enhanced  by  good  sound  effects  - who wants to play a beat `em up
  without  a sound when you hit somebody?  Who wants to play a shoot `em up
  where  the  baddies explode silently?  There are many ways to get hold of
  sound effects from your games, which are outlined below...

  @3The Public Domain
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  @4All  good  PD  libraries have disks full of PD sound effects that you can
  use  in  your  game for free.  Why not get a few disks.  The better disks
  are  based  around  a  theme  -  for example you might get a disk full of
  animal  sounds.   If  you  are  just starting to collect sound effects, I
  recommend you get hold of a few general disks.
  @3Sample your own
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  @5To  do  this  you  need  a sampler, a sound source and a bit of practise.
  Very  few  people  are going to buy a sampler for one sound, and there is
  not  much  chance of sampling some sounds if you are a home user.  Unless
  you  have  a good microphone and live next to an airport you can`t get an
  aeroplane  sound,  and  I  wouldn't  fancy holding a microphone next to a
  building  as  it is demolished for that authentic explosion sound.  it is
  also  possible  to  buy CDs of samples that you can record yourself but I
  have  never  tried these.  The BBC made a CD of Doctor Who sound effects,
  but they are copyrighted so you can't use them.  Hmmmmmmmm....
@1
  Once  you  have  got  samples,  you can put them in a sample bank for use
  within  your game.  I am not going to tell you how to use the sample bank
  editor,  because it is pretty much straightforward (this is AMOS Pro I am
  talking  about,  I  wouldn't  touch  the  old  sample  bank editor with a
  bargepole!!).
@4
  Anyway,  as soon as you have got all your samples together, you load them
  into your game and...  You have about 3k of memory for your graphics!
@3

  1.  Think "do I _really_ need a 30 second sample of birds tweeting in the
  background?".  If not, get rid of it.
  @32.  Do you need eighteen different explosions?  Perhaps you could use one
  or two and play them at different speeds (i.e.  different pitches)

  3.  Consider  reducing  the  sample  rate,  which means cutting down  the
  quality  of  the  sample,  thereby  the  size.   I will explain how to do
  this...
@4
  You need a sample editor.  The best one in the PD is SuperSound version 3
  (which  was  incidently  coded  in  AMOS).   I  have included this on "No
  Sampler?   Utilities  disk  3"  (available  from  all  good  PD libraries
  including  F1  and  it's  on  AZ  Supplement  Disk  2)   There  is  a CLR
  licenceware  version,  too  which is better but not too important for our
  needs.  (Oi, don't mention them!..  Steve)
@1
  So,  load  in a sample, and play it at it`s default rate which is usually
  either  16000 to 17000 or about 8000.  If it sounds best at 8000 then you
  can't  really  cut it down any more.  It it is best at 16000 then use the
  sample  editor's  OCTAVE  UP feature to increase it's pitch by an octave.
  This will take a short time to complete.  Now try playing it at a rate of
  8000.  if it sounds virtually the same as it used to then save it back to
  disk.   You will find it has reduced in size by about 50%.  You will need
  to  use  the  AMOS  sample  bank  editor  to  change its default pitch to
  8000ish.   Try  this  on  all of the samples.  Some will sound distorted,
  leave  these  at  16000  samples per second.
  @4This  applies  to  sounds  with  lots of high frequencies in them (Hihats
  etc.).  the best results are obtained from explosions and similar sounds.
@3 
  Music
  ~~~~~
  @5This is not as important as sound effects, as it is normally only used on
  the  title screen and perhaps on a high score table.  In-game music could
  be used but can cause problems with sound effects (they stop the music on
  the  channel  they  are  using  until they have finished playing, causing
  `Crazy  Comets  Syndrome'  (firing  your  gun  on this brilliant C64 game
  caused one track of the music to stop, thereby destroying the melody.  So
  you could listen to the music or shoot)

  Firstly, forget about using MED modules.  This is hard for me to say as I
  am  an  experienced MED user, a writer for the MED Users Group Diskmag, a
  massive  MED  enthusiast  and basically in love with the program.  To use
  MED modules in anything but PD programs requires a special licence.  They
  also  cause  AMOS  a  lot  of  problems and are generally not as flexible
  within the AMOS environment, even though there is a much greater range of
  effects  available  and  they  can use more smples etc.  (Well said Mike,
  Steve)



  @4Protracker is the one to go for when using modules.  You can either
@3
  1.  Write your own.  If you aren't a musician they could well turn out to
  sound, errr...crap!

  2.  Get  some  PD  modules  (they  can't  usually  be used in  commercial
  programs, though, because they normally retain their copyright)

  3.  Get some modules from F1 Licenceware there are two or three disks  of
  modules  you  can  use  in your own program.  The only problem being that
  there could be dozens of other games using the same modules.

  4.  If  you are writing a game for commercial release the software  house
  might have an in-house musician who will do the music for you.

  5.  Get hold of a musician.  There are several ways to go about this, you
  could  ask  for  one  through  the  pages  of Amoszine or some other mag,
  release  a  soundless demo version with a request for a musician (but you
  could wait for a long time before you got one), you could ask me to do it
  ;-),  or  you  could get hold of Total Irrelevance from Seasoft Computing
  and  ask  about placing an advert for a Protracker-using musician (asking
  for  a  Protracker  using musician in the pages of the Official MED Users
  Group disk magazine?) The problems with getting a musician are ..........

  @4a)  All musicians are money grabbing cut-throats.  No, not really, but if
  you  are  releasing  a Licenceware of commercial game you aren't going to
  get  the  services  of  a  top  musician  for  nothing  (unless  it  is a
  kind-hearted  musician)  it  is  well known in the computer industry that
  musicians  often get ripped off by software companies (getting paid about
  10p for the full musical score for a top-selling game), so it is tempting
  to  musicians  if  a  solo  programmer  is  willing  to pay them to write
  freelance music.


  @1b) Don't expect CD quality music - in a game it is rare to have very much
  space  available.   Anything less than 50k and it is short or low quality
  samples.  For example, the title music for Zool takes up abput 130k.  You
  are  unlikely to have this much space in the AMOS environment so forget a
  remake of Tubular Bells as the title screen.
@5

  If  you decide to get a musician, don't just blindly accept the first one
  to  offer  his  services,  unless you are really impressed with the music
  produced  by  this  person.   It is best to shop around a bit.  And don't
  trust somebody who won't send you a demo disk.  personally, I always send
  a demo disk so the programmer can decide if he likes my music or not.


  @4Once  you  have decided on a musician, you can't expect to just leave him
  to  it and expect him to write a superb piece of music straight away that
  is  guaranteed  to  fit  into  your game.  Nor can you expect a brilliant
  piece  of  music  in  about a week.  You will have to supply the musician
  with as much information as possible.  How much RAM he will have to write
  each  module in (always tell him he has about 10k less than you can spare
  so the size can spill over slightly), a list of EXACTLY what is required,
  the  length  of each piece and an idea of the general feel.  if possible,
  send  a  demo  of the game to him so he can get an idea of the mood.  Now
  leave  him to it for a bit.  Ask for regular updates to the music, so you
  can  oversee  its  development  and  ensure  it  is  going  in  the right
  direction.  Make sure you constructively criticize the music - after all,
  when  all  is  said and done it is your game and it is up to you what the
  music should be like.  There is no point in getting a rave soundtrack for
  your  new  Sim-City clone.  Don't be scared to tell the musician if he is
  doing the music wrong.  Believe me, if a musician wants a good reputation
  he will be prepared to change his music.  Word gets around if a game gets
  a  good rating for sound in the magazines.  Look at, for example, Richard
  Joseph.  He produced some of the best soundtracks in Amiga games (all the
  Bitmap  Brothers  games)  and  now he is doing the music for nearly every
  game  that  is  released.  The same for Allister Brimble, he now does the
  music  for  Team 17 after producing some brilliant PD demo disks.  If you
  don't like the music after several attempts, get a new musician.  It's as
  simple as that.
  @4It is a good idea, if you are having in-game music, to get the programmer
  to  use  a  `multi-module'.   This lets you have several smaller tunes as
  well as as main tune (this is the technique used in Pinball Fantasies).
@1
  To  do  this,  you get the programmer to write a main tune, that loops at
  the end, then add on extra bits to the playing sequence, at the end, with
  the  sub songs.  So you might have a 10 pattern main track, followed by a
  one pattern game over tune.  To trigger this you use
@5
  Track play   For the main music, and
  Track play <bank>,11    For the game over music.
@4
  It  cuts  down  on  loading  time  (you  don't have to load in a new tune
  whenever  the  player  dies.   It  cuts down on disk space (one module is
  replacing  2)  and because all songs in the multi-module use the same set
  of samples memory is saved.  The disadvantage is that the musician has to
  write  several songs with the same set of samples but a good musician can
  get  around  this  (usually).   Remember,  the  less  space  you give the
  musician,  the  lower  the quality of the sound (although the actual TUNE
  itself  will  still  be  the  same,  the  INSTRUMENTS  will be of a lower
  quality).   To  do a module in anything less than 100k, the musician will
  have  to  use 4-6 samples only.  This is only a problem for musicians who
  like  doing  big modules with loads of instruments (I use few instruments
  anyway, some musicians regularly produce 200k modules).
  @4Finally,  find  out  if the musician can do your Sound FX for you.  If he
  has  a  sampler, he might record some sound effects for you (but you will
  have  to provide a tape containing the effects you want if you are asking
  for a sample of something he can't get hold of).  A lot of musicians also
  have  a  disk or two of Sound FX (I have a disk comtaining sounds ranging
  from a slamming door to a dog barking, for example.)
