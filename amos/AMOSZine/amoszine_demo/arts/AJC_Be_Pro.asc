      People who've just coded a new AMOS production and are eager to try
      and get it released (as either commercial, licenceware or shareware)
      might like to know a few tricks to hide the fact that their program
      was coded with AMOS.

       Yes, of course we should all be proud our programs were coded in
      AMOS, after all, the language is by far the best for the Amiga and has
      allowed thousands of would-be games writers make their dreams come
      true. But consider the following:

       Commercial software houses don't like AMOS. It's a sad fact indeed.
      Apparently AMOS is a 'games creator' just like S.E.U.C.K (the Shoot Em
      Up Construction Kit by Palace software) and 3D Construction Kit by
      Domark. Of course, WE know this is a load of rubbish - it's not the
      language you code something in, it's the finished product that counts.
      But for AMOS success, you have to hide the AMOS origins of your
      program. It's not as difficult as it sounds.


      Let us see how we can go about 'hiding AMOS'...The AMOS mouse pointer
      and file selector are both pretty naff. How do you think a new Amiga
      user or young child would feel about using the AMOS Professional file-
      selector? Fairly perplexed I should say. Similarly, unless you change
      the mouse pointer in your program (assuming it uses one) you'll not
      only end up revealing everything to 'AMOS-spotters' but also find you
      have a mouse pointer exactly like a million others found in typical
      AMOS PD games!

      Here are some tips to aid your coding:
@1
      * Always make sure you start with a BLANK screen, not the AMOS default
      one. Not only is it a sickly colour, it gives AMOS programs away
      instantly and makes them look cheap and unprofessional. A good tip
      is to start a program with the following line:
@3
      Default palette 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0... etc.
@1
      This will ensure any new screens are blanked out immediately, even
      before the user knows they've arrived. Always use the command FLASH
      OFF when opening a new screen. Also, a quick short-cut I'm sure most
      of you will be familiar with: if you wanted to make a screen turn
      entirely white, try this:
@3
      A=$FFF : Palette a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a... etc.
@1
      It saves you keying in 32 $FFF's, that's all.

      * If you can, use the FADE option as much as possible when loading and
      displaying screens. It 'smooths out' your program and makes it look
      far more professional. Make FADES quick and attractive - don't make
      the user wait 5 seconds as the screen gradually darkens!! And NEVER
      use the APPEAR command unless you're doing a slideshow. It takes far
      too long and is over-used by inexperienced AMOS users.

      * RENAME .ABK FILES!! This is a DEAD give-away to AMOS programs. You
      don't have to rename anything until your program is finished. Then,
      if you'd written a game called 'Killer Sharks', you could rename
      your files like this:
@3
      rename BOBS.ABK to BOBS.SHARK
@1
      It makes absolutely NO difference to the performance of your
      programs of course, but it does make paranoid 'AMOS-spotters'
      scratch their heads a bit.

      * Replacing the AMOS file selector with one of your own is a tough job
      unless you're a good coder. There are many excellent selectors
      already done for you by various programmers. Check out some of the
      many AMOS source code disks, or get in touch with F1. I'm sure
      they'll sort you something out. Make sure you trap errors with the
      commands "ON ERROR..." and "RESUME...". Remember - users don't
      always pick something from the selector; they might change their
      minds, in which case you program needs to be able to cope with this.
      Also be aware of people loading the wrong file types into your
      program. For example: if you're requesting the user to pick an IFF
      picture to display on the screen, what will happen if he/she picks a
      music track or an ASCII file by accident?

      * Use the DIR$ command at the start of your program. You can then set
      up all your filenames and if at any point you wish to change the
      name of your disk, you only have to alter one line. E.g.:
@3
      Dir$="Killer Sharks:SHARKDATA/"

      Load Dir$+"BOBS.SHARK",1
      Load Dir$+"SOUNDFX.SHARK",5
      Load Dir$+"MUSIC.SHARK",3
@1
      * Alter the mouse pointer by using the 'Object Editor' accessory and
      creating a 4-colour sprite. If you're using a 32-colour screen, make
      a note of the colours 17,18 and 19 - these are the ones the mouse
      pointer uses (colour 16 is invisible). Remember to position the
      hot-spot where the 'point' of your mouse pointer is. And, of course,
      make sure you use the command CHANGE MOUSE in your program!

      * If your program loads BIG files or leaves the user waiting for a
      task to finish, try animating the mouse pointer with AMAL or, more
      simply, make it change appearance - to a disk or a clock for
      example. What's that? You want an example? Deary me. Okay, try
      adding something like this into your program:
@3
      >>>> NOTE: (replace all the stars with your own values!)


      A$="Anim 0,(*,*),(*,*)(*,*)(*,*); Loop: Let X=XM; Let Y=YM;"
      A$=A$+"Pause; Jump Loop"

      Channel 9 to sprite 9
      Amal 9,A$
      Sprite 9,Xmouse,Ymouse,*
      Hide on
      Amal On
@1
      This little routine will animate your mouse pointer. Yes! AMAL does
      have a use! Amazing isn't it? Be warned: The animation pauses when
      the disk is being accessed!

      * ALWAYS use the command BREAK OFF and substitute it with some kind of
      quit option. I must admit I have written a lot of games that still
      recognise the CTRL+C program quit, but I just thought I'd mention
      this. Isn't it supposed to add speed to a program too?

      * Where you can, include the use of FONTS. Don't stick to the usual
      AMOS 'topaz' font (or what ever it is) - get hold of some new fonts
      from a PD library and exploit them like crazy. And make use of the
      SET FONT command - you'd be surprised how effective bold/italics can
      be. Also, a last warning about fonts: write yourself a routine that
      actually READS the NAMES of the fonts from disk: AMOS seems to come
      up with different numbers on the A500 and the A1200, therefore a
      command like...
@3
      Set Font 1
@1
      ...would probably give you a completely different font, depending on
      which machine you ran the program on. What's that? You want ANOTHER
      example doing for you? Goodness me...
@3



      Get Disc Fonts       : Rem * Reads the font list

      I=0                  : Rem * Set variable 'I' to 0

   Repeat
      Inc I                : Rem * Increase variable 'I'
      F$=Left$(Font$(I),6) : Rem * Read first 6 chars of font
   Until F$="dpaint"       : Rem * If first 6 chars="dpaint"
                           : Rem * you've found what number that font is!

      F1=I                 : Rem * Load variable 'F1' with 'I'
      Set Font F1          : Rem * F1 now stores 'dpaint' font!
@1
      The above routine is very useful so... er, use it. Please note that
      the first 6 characters of the font you're looking for must be EXACT
      (that means lower/lower case characters as appropriate). Otherwise
      you'll end up with an infinite loop!

      * ALWAYS use the SPACK command when using pictures in your programs.
      Normal IFF screens can be loaded into almost any paint package and
      edited freely. I know this sounds completely obvious, and I've not
      taken my own advice in the past (so you're a hypocrite? - SB) (yes I
      suppose so - AJC) but it's much better than having screens anyone
      could rip off in your programs.

      * Try to make everything keyboard accessible, as well as icon/mouse
      operated. It's an easy enough feature to add into almost any program
      and will please users no end. Trust me - my game Black Dawn was
      criticized for not having keypad controls when it was reviewed (I
      have now fixed this to stop any mumbling!)

      There are millions more little details I could go into to make your
      programs more professional and efficient, but I'll have to stop there
      or I'll swamp the diskzine!

      I hope you've found some of that information useful (I'm talking to
      new users mainly here) and good luck with your AMOS creations!
