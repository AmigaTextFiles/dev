      How many of you use Amos Pro ?  Most of you, good.  How many of you
      compile  your  programs  from  the  USER  pull down menu and select
      COMPILER SHELL within Amos Pro interpreter (editor) ?  All of you ?
      So far so good.
      @1
      How  many  of you use some Amos Pro extensions such as PBobs, LDos,
      Craft etc.  Most of you again.  My word this is a crappy article so
      far !!!
      @5
      OK,  so  you have used some commands from an Amos Extension in your
      listing  and have selected to compile it via the USER menu.  As you
      know, it will compile alright.
      @3
      Now  what if you don't have enough memory to compile it?  Well, you
      could  always  alter  the  compilers  config  file  to  change  its
      temporary save path from Ram:  to HD1:  etc.
      @4
      This  is  very  easy  to  do  and I'm sure most of you have already
      altered your copy to do so.
      @4If  not,  then  choose  the  option  that says "SETUP OPTIONS" then
      select the option that says "Compiler System Setup".
      @1
      Now  choose  the option that says "Compiler System Files" and alter
      all  the RAM:  paths to your own.  (The numbers I altered were 8, 9
      and 10)
      @5
      By  doing this, the compiler will not use Ram:  as a temp work/save
      device, thus saving you valuable memory.  You can also set up other
      options to stop the compiler from copying Libs to Ram: etc. 
      @3
      OK  that's  fine  and dandy.  Now if you are still short of memory,
      the  only  other  option  is  to  Quit Amos and load Compiler_Shell
      (executable) file and compile your listing.  This has the advantage
      of  being  loaded  on  its own and not via the Amos Pro interpreter
      (editor).  Again, a memory saver.
      @4
      Now  some  of you may already know this, so bare with me.  There is
      one  slight drawback!  If you have used any Amos Extension commands
      in your listing and you are trying to compile it via Compiler_Shell
      (loaded  via  WB and not via the editor menu) Then chances are that
      you will get the error message "EXTENSION NOT LOADED"
      @6
      How many of you have had that one before ?   Most of you probably !
      @4So  you  have  tried everything to get the compiler to compile your
      listing with no luck.  Yeah, sure it will compile it via the editor
      as this loads up the file "Compiler_Shell.Amos" which is an updated
      version of the compiler.
      @1
      So the answer is simple.  If you want to compile your listings just
      using the compiler, loaded via WB, then:
      @5
      Load the file "Compiler_Shell,Amos" into your editor
      Compile it
      Save it over your existing Compiler_Shell (executable)
      @3
      Next  time  you load it and try to compile a listing which uses any
      extensions, everything should be 100%
      @4
      It  worked  for  me  and I don't know why nobody ever thought of it
      before!  Hope it is of use to someone out there, but most of us are
      happy to compile via Amos interpreter anyway.  But you never know !
      @2
      For beginners only:
      @6Please note that the file named "Compiler_Shell.Amos" is the actual
      amos listing (program) that can be edited via Amos.  The file named
      Compiler_Shell is the actual compiled program. )ie. executable file
      that  can  be  loaded from WB or even CLI.
      @4So  don't  go  saving over the wrong files.  Always use a backup of
      your original disks before messing around.
      @1
      
      If  working  from  HD,  then you can always recopy the files if you
      make a mess of it!!!
      @5
      
      Myself  and  Amoszine  cannot be held responsible for any damage or
      loss of files that may occur during this process.
      @3
      
      All  information  is  based on Amos Pro V2 and Amos Pro Compiler V2
      installed onto Hard Disk.  A1200 (standard model only)
      @6
      
      I  hope this file is of some great use to you all.  If you have any
      other tips on how to get the best out of the compiler, or even Amos
      Pro itself, drop us an article or two.
