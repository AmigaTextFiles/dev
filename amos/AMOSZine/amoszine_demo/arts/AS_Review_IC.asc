@7                   IMAGE COMPRESSER V1.0b, Author Andrew Smith
                   ===========================================
  @5As  AZ  utils  editor, andrew HAD to knock out a decent util, and here it
  is.   Image  Compressor  is a very nicely presented and friendly program.
  Written  in  Amos Pro, it allows you to crunch picture files in different
  ways  and  squezzing  every drop of compression possible out of your pic.
  This  util  would be especially useful for writers of graphical adventure
  games that tend to have lots of IFF screens, using IC would save a lot of
  time and hassle as well as disk space/loading time.

  On loading IC you are presented with a crystal clear options menu.  Click
  on  Load  IFF  and using the Pro file selector, (in a nice shade of grey)
  load  in  your  target  piccy.  The picture is displayed and you are told
  it's width, height and amount of colours used.  You can also load in ABK,
  Power  Packed  ABK  and  squashed  ABKpics to view/recrunch and generally
  tinker with.

  Once  you  have  your  picture  in  you can choose to pack it as a normal
  screen  or a bitmap image (just the image data) you then have the further
  option,  using  a  dpaint  style  banding  box to pack part or all of the
  screen  (really  useful) Then all you do is click on pack and then select
  your  chosen  crunch option.  ABK, Squashed ABK, PPABK etc.  After IC has
  done  the  biz  it's file requester time and you save the image off.  And
  that's it really!

  The only feature missing as far as I am concerned is a pack meter telling
  you  how many lovely K or bytes you have saved and the original file size
  to  the  new file size, minimal gripe really and not totally necessary as
  the Pro file selector gives you the file sizes anyway.

  IC  comes  with  complete  AmigaFile  documentation  and best of all this
  version  is  PD.   Even better news is that it is appear on AZ Supplement
  disk  3  along  with lot's of other goodies of course.  Andrew intends to
  add lots more features to IC and release it as Licenceware.

  In summation:
  @4Image  compressor  is  lovely  to  look at, easy to use and does it's job
  extremely  well.   What  else can a util offer?  My small gripe is hardly
  worth  mentioning.   You  may think I shouldn't be reviewing this as I am
  biased,  well  I  am  because it's good, if it was crap or lacking in any
  department  I  would  tell you.  As you know by now, Andrew doesn't mince
  words in his reviews and I was ready to tell you anything un-toward about
  IC, but I couldn't find anything.  and so it deserves >>>@3
