      Hello everyone.  Amoszine #4Special Edition @4is an exclusive version
      of the full F1 Licenceware title.
@1
      This  Special  Edition  has  been  put together to let you see what
      Amoszine  is  all about.  Myself and Steve Bye compiled some of the
      best  articles from previous issues of Az and put them on this disk
      for you all to read.
@5
      Some  source code is also included, but there's is even better code
      to be found on the full diskzine.  If you want full exclusive
      source  code  to  games like Fortress II, Santa & Rudolph Do X-Mas,
      Fruit Machine Sims, Strategy Games etc. Then Az is the disk mag for
      you.
@3
      Amoszine has the top Amos coders contributing their work each issue
      and  this  includes full tutorials on how to write games, Interface
      help, Writing your own extensions, Top Tips etc.
@4
      Impressed?   Well  you aint heard nothin' yet !  Each issue is 100%
      full of source, gfx, music and articles.
@4      All  files  are crunched/packed so we can fit as much stuff on each
      issue as we can.

      There is no other Amos Disk Magazine that comes close.  Amoszine is
      "THE  AMOS  PROGRAMMER'S  BIBLE"  and  is  a  must  buy  if you are
      seriously into Amos.
@5
      Beginners are not left out either.  There is always source code and
      tutorials to start you off in an easy-to-follow guide.
@3
      Amoszine  is  put  together by experts and beginners.  Whatsmore, a
      friendly service means no matter what level of Amos programming you
      are on, you will be catered for.
