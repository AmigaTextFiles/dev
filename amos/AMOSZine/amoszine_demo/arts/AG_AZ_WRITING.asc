@3

This  article  will  take you through
the  steps  of  writing your very own
two-  column  articles just like this
one.
@3
You could type your file normally and
then  use  the  NEW AZ TESTER util on
Supp  Disk  5  to  convert it to this
type  of  file or just load this file
into your text editor to see how it's
done.
@5
AZ supports two types of articles and
these  are normal (79) chars per line
arts or these new (38) chars per line
arts.
@4
First  of  all  I must stress that no
matter  which type of article you are
gonna type, please DO NOT use TAB !!!
@5



It  causes too many hassles and AZ is
not compatible with those files !!!

@1
If you are gonna be typing the normal
type of article and want to add the 6
spaces  to  the  start  of each line,
then  either do it by hand or use the
new  AZ  Tester as found on Supp Disk
@1#@15.

@4
The  AZ  Tester  can  also be used to
convert normal arts to these new two-
column  arts  easily.    If you don't
have  Supp  Disk  5,   order  it from
Steve now.
@5
Right,  let's  take  a look at how to
create your articles now:
@4Amoszine now allows Split-Screen text
articles as well as normal text arts.
@3
Furthermore,  up to  15   colours can
now   be   used   for  each  article.
Colours  8-15   being  reserved   for
#3FLASHING TEXT !@4
@4
If  you  are thinking of contributing
an  article  for  future issues of AZ
then here's what you will need to do:
@6
First  of  all  you must decide which
type  of  article you want to create.

@1 ie.    Split Screen - Same as this
file. Normal Type  - See other files.
@4

I  will  deal  with  the Split-Screen
type of file first of all as we think
it  is now gonna be very popular with
AZ !

@5The very first thing that you need to
type  is #5<#5> @5as this will allow the AZ
code  to set it's default text reader
to use the new Split-Screen option.
@3

If you want a heading at the top of
the page, you must type #3{ @3followed by
your  heading.    (This will be auto-
centred for you).
@4

You  may also like to add a title for
the  name  of  the  author  (you) !!!
To  do  this you simply type #4} @4before
the    text.      (This   will   be
auto-centred)
@5

Always  leave  a  blank  line between
your  headings  as  it will be needed
for our new font sizes.    AZ may use
a  different font in future issues so
let's  keep  it  compatible  dudes  !
@4Now you need to type up all your text
@1
Please  note  that  no  more  than 38
chars  should  be  typed per line !!!
That  does  not  include  the  colour
codes,  which  we  shall come to in a
minute or two.
@6
The  best  thing  to  do is load this
file into your favourite text editor.
You  should  be  able  to  follow the
format   as   it's   pretty  straight
forward
@4
(This  file  is no longer crunched so
you  shouldn't have any problems when
loading  it  into  your  text editor.
It  can  be found in the ARTS Dir and
named @3AZ_WRITING.asc@4)
@3
OK  let's  take  a rundown of how you
can create the coloured text for your
own articles.

7 colours can be used and these are :

@1White  @2Red @3Yellow @4Green @5Cyan @6Blue @4and
of course @7Purple
@1
This  could be mainly used to show up
some important text - well ?!?
@3
To  add  any  of the above colours to
your  text,  just put the @ character
followed by a number from 1 to 7.


  eg. @1@@11 Would give White text.
      @5@@55 Would give Cyan text.

@4
As  mentioned  before,  only  type  a
maximum of 38 chars per line.    Then
you  can add in all your colour codes
later  (Only  up  to 79 chars on each
line).
@1

THIS LINE HAS USED UP THE 38 CHARS !!!

@1THIS @2LINE @3HAS @4USED @5UP @6THE @738 @2CHARS @3!@4!@5!


@4That  should be easy enough to follow
when  this  file  is  viewed via your
text  editor.     If  you  are  still
confused,  just type up a normal text
file and send it to the AZ editor and
he'll  do  all  the hard work for you
!!!
@3
Oh  yeah,  I nearly forgot to mention
that  only  24  lines  of text can be
shown on each screen.    If your text
editor  is  any  good, then it should
tell you what line you are on anyway.
@5
Use  the new AZ ARTICLE TESTER to see
how your articles look before posting
them  off  to  us.     (It would also
help  us  if  you  could  spell check
them)
@1Now let's  deal with normal articles:
@4
Basically  they  are formatted in the
exact  same  way as split-screen type
except  you  musn't  type  #4<#4>  @4at the
start and each line must be no longer
than 79 chars.    (That also includes
the colour codes !!!)
@3
So   be  careful  if  you  want  your
article to be neat and tidy !
@5
If  you  do  manage to type more than
the 79 character limit, not only will
your  article  be a little bit messy,
but it won't print out as a neat file
either!
@1

Again, only 24 lines per page will be
shown,  so try and remember that when
you are typing away.


@4Normal  type articles can now use the
new   headings  for  both  Title  and
Author as with split screen articles.
That's a new bonus for AZ also.
@4The  heading  for  both the Title and
the  Author  are  both displayed atop
each  page,  so it doesn't have to be
just the first page of your article.

Each  page  (24 lines) can now have a
new   title   and  author  heading  !
These  will  be  auto-centred for you
also.

That's  basically it I suppose.    If
you  still  find all that too much to
take  in,  then  please  just  type a
normal article and send it to us.
