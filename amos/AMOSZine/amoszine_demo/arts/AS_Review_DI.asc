      It's  very  rare  to find a really good image processor in the P.D.
      It's even rarer still to find one that is written in AMOS, which is
      exactly  what  this  program was written in.  I can now imagine all
      the  sneers from the non-AMOS fans who quite wrongly will say "It's
      written in AMOS so it'll be slow with an appalling user interface".
      They couldn't be further from the truth.
      
      
      Upon  loading, perceptive users will notice a lean towards the user
      interface  of  Art  Department  professional,  the  way in which it
      looks, but not how its laid out.  The first thing I noticed was the
      Image  Operators  panel featuring 12 buttons.  A fair few operators
      for  a  P.D.  Image Processor I thought.  Actually, there are a lot
      more operators for you to use.  The raised bar where it says 'Image
      Operators'  is  actually  a  clickable gadget, although this is not
      immediately  obvious.   Clicking  here  will  reveal another set of
      operators.   There  are  27  different  operators in all, and to be
      perfectly honest there are some really good effects.
      @4
      The  most  dramatic  effect (and the best one in my opinion) is the
      Spiral  operator.   It's really an operator that makes your picture
      look  like it's being sucked down a plug-hole.  Firstly you have to
      click  the LOAD gadget to load an IFF picture.  Next, your ready to
      process  your  picture.   Upon clicking on the Spiral operator, you
      are  presented  with a requester with 5 gadgets at the bottom and a
      slide  bar  in  the  middle.  It is here where you set your 'Spiral
      Twist'.   Basically,  the  higher the setting the more dramatic the
      effect.   When  you've  made your setting, click the Execute button
      (Most  of  the  operators  use this same requester).  I hope your a
      patient lot because it really does take a long while to process the
      image.  When complete you have to click the 'GO!' gadget to display
      the picture.  There is another wait here while it is 'Computing New
      Palette',  or  so  it  says.   Afterwards,  your processed image is
      displayed  on  the  screen.       Perhaps  the  worst  operator  is
      splatter.
      
      What  it  does  is  remove  pixels from your image at random and it
      makes the final image look tacky.  This is the only poor effect but
      the others are really quite superb although they do take a while to
      process.
      
      Of  course  when you've processed your picture, you'll want to save
      it.
      @4To  do  this you click on the SAVE gadget.  When the file requester
      appears,  you  should  give your new image a filename and click OK.
      Your file will be saved out as a standard IFF picture file.
      
      Considering  the author decided to use AMOS to write his package, I
      cannot understand why he didn't include the option to load and save
      images  as  AMOS  packed  pictures.   The  reason why this would be
      useful is twofold:
      
      @3
      *  Packed Pictures are a lot smaller than their IFF equivalents and
      therefor less disk space is used.
      
      
      *  There  would be no need to convert images from IFF format to ABK
      format.   AMOS  programmers could load their newly processed images
      directly into a memory bank.
      
      @4
      In  fact,  you can only load and save IFF files.  I think more work
      is  needed here.  At the very least it should support IFF, ABK, PCX
      and  GIF  picture  formats  as  most  image  processors include the
      facility to load pictures from other platforms.
      
      @4What  else  does Digital Illusions offer?  Well you can dither your
      picture.   Unfortunately  you  only  have  two modes of dither i.e.
      none  or  Floyd  Steinberg, but do you really need other methods of
      dithering?   You  can  use the different screen resolutions of your
      Amiga.  Lowres and Hires screen modes are supported and they can be
      interlaced  if  you so wish.  The maximum number of colours you can
      use  is  4096 which is HAM mode (Hold And Modify) which can only be
      used  in  Lowres,  as  most  people  know.   Because the package is
      written  in  AMOS, there is no support for the new AGA screen modes
      or  even the older ECS chipset that was introduced with the A500+ .
      AGA  support  WILL  be  included  in  the  next  version of Digital
      Illusions but the program is being recoded in C (Get a move on with
      that  AGA  extension  Europress!   We  cannot  afford  to have AMOS
      programmers moving to other languages!).
      
      Perhaps  the  best  part about this program is the animation.  It's
      quite  difficult  for  the  beginner to get to grips with so he/she
      should  have  a good read of the on-disk documentation.  But if you
      keep  trying,  then  some  really good looking results will be your
      reward.  With the spiral operator (that I mentioned before) and the
      animation  combined,  you  can  make  an  animation  that sucks the
      picture  into  the  centre of the screen.  I myself have tried this
      and  it  looks  stunning!   This  feature is so good you can easily
      spend  hours  creating strange anims, it is so much good fun!
      @4When  it  comes to saving your animation, it will not be saved as a
      standard  IFF ANIM file.  Instead, each frame of the animation will
      be  saved  out  as  a  separate  IFF picture.  Each filename of the
      animation will look something like this:
      @3
      anim001
      anim002
      anim003
      @4
      Luckily,  Deluxe  Paint can load an animation like this.  (Look out
      for  a  tutorial  on  this  sort  of  thing soon) As everybody owns
      DPaint,  there  shouldn't  be  too  much  hassle  in  loading  your
      animation.
      
      Okay  then, I've waffled on long enough about its features, but how
      well  does  it  perform?  As expected, image processing is no quick
      business, be prepared to sit around doing nothing for great lengths
      of  time.   Most  of  the  operators  yield great results if you're
      prepared  to  experiment.   The  requesters in the program are very
      good,  especially  the  palette  requester,  it is hard to tell the
      program was written in AMOS - until you press Left-Amiga and A.  If
      you  are  interested  in animation then a hard disk is essential as
      the  animations are played directly from hard disk, this is because
      the programmer hasn't supported IFF animations.
      @4This is not really his fault as AMOS doesn't support IFF animations
      either.   This  does  mean, however, that your animations can be as
      big  as  disk  space allows.  According to the author, this program
      requires  1  meg of memory, but he recommends 2 megs.  Personally I
      think  this is unrealistic as the program is a real memory-hog when
      it  comes  to  animating.  Personally, I recommend that you have at
      least  4  megs to use the animation feature comfortably.  Of course
      if  you  don't  intend  to create anims then you may be able to get
      away  with  just  1  meg, but don't expect to process a 320*512 HAM
      image using one of the more complicated operators.
      
      To  sum up, Digital Illusions is definitely one of the better image
      processors out there and is definitely worth a look.  The operators
      give  good  results  and the user-interface is quite good, although
      no-where  near  as good as one that runs under Intuition.  The lack
      of  ABK  support  is a major omission but the other missing formats
      such  as PCX, GIF, BMP, TIFF etc.  is less serious.  Be prepared to
      wait,  it's  not the fastest image program around.  The lack of AGA
      is  also dissapointing, but again it's not the fault of the author.
      The  animation  however  is nothing short of superb.  My advice is,
      get it!
