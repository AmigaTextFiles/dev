     What is a database exactly?  Well, it's like a computerised
     version of a filing cabinet.  It allows you to store anything
     you like and searching for a particular name for example is a
     lot quicker and simpler than searching through a big rusty
     filing-cabinet.

     Can a database benefit me?  It depends what you do.  If you run
     a PD library then you will definitely benefit.  You could store
     your entire catalogue of disks, each one with their unique code.
     When a customer phones up requesting a specific disk you can
     simply enter the search criteria onto the database, and give
     him the information he wants to know, quickly.  It gives the
     customer the impression that your PD library is professional.
     Just imagine manually searching through a paper-based catalogue 
     of disks while the customer is waiting on the other end of the
     phone.  The chances are is that he will get very fed up of
     waiting for what he wants to know, and will hang up.  This won't
     convey professionalism to your customers.
@4     What we have here then AMOS fans is a database. Shock! Horror!
     A swift double-click on the program's icon loads the program.
     Wow!  It runs under Workbench.  Click on the title bar and drag,
     amazing, there's the Workbench screen.  This program really does
     run under Workbench, quite an amazing feat considering that AMOS
     doesn't offer Workbench support.  Unfortunately though, the
     requesters are completely non-standard but who cares?  I do, and
     I'm sure other people will do as well.  We all know the Amiga has 
     the best operating system around.  The reason I say this is 
     because the pull-down menus don't offer keyboard shortcuts, 
     unlike Workbench which does.  Some of you might think I'm being 
     picky, but using the mouse to select menu items does get tiresome 
     after so many menu selections.  Keyboard shortcuts increase speed
     and therefore productivity.  Enough said.
                                                                       
     The editing facilities are pretty good.  There's the standard      
     Cut, Copy and Paste facilities (which don't have keyboard         
     shortcuts either).  To highlight a section of text, just click    
     and drag then it is a simple matter to do what you want with it.  
     When you have typed some data into a field, pressing the TAB key  
     takes you onto the next field.  Although this seems a little      
     unusual at first, you will soon get used to it.  If you press     
     RETURN, then you are taken onto the next record.  While you are   
     editing your data, you can view the records as a list, or as a    
@4     card index and you can edit in these different formats too,       
     although the list option gets a little slow when there are a      
     lot of records.  No fault of the programmer I hasten to add,      
     but of Commodore for not building fast enough machines.           
                                                                       
     The search facility is very good, allowing to build up quite      
     complex search criteria, and it is extremely fast.  There is also 
     the ability to sort your data, more on that later though.         
                                                                       
     It is obvious from the first time that you use this program,      
     that it is meant to be easy to use, and it is;  but with the
     simplicity of the program, power is sacrificed.  To begin with
     you can only work on one file.  Powerful databases that allow
     the user to link several files are called 'Relational Databases'
     and this program doesn't offer this feature.  This sort of
     database is known as a 'flat-file' database.  This is not really
     a disadvantage though, as not many users would require this power.
     Most users only require a quick database that can search and
     sort their information, and Flexer is well up to the job.

     There must be a downside to this program right?  Well, not
     really a downside, but really a strange way of working.  To sort
     a field, you should firstly go into list mode.  You do this by
     selecting 'Show As List' from the Records menu.  Then you click
@4
     and drag the field you are interested in to the far left of the
     screen.  The other fields are then moved across to make space
     for the field you just moved.  Next you choose 'Sort In Order'
     from the Records menu.  Then the records are sorted, using the
     Quicksort algorithm which is very fast.  Wouldn't it have been
     easier if a dialogue box appeared with two gadgets reading
     'Forward' and 'Reverse' requesting you to pick a field to be
     sorted by?  At present sorting forwards and in reverse are two
     completely different processes.  Very strange.


     Summing up, Flexer is a useful program to have, it's fast,
     user-friendly and simple, but lacking for power-users.  Also,
     some of its functions feature a very strange way of working, and
     there are no keyboard shortcuts.  Anyway, if you need to store
     large amounts of data, search for any record and sort by any
     field then Flexer is definitely recommended.

@4     AmigaGuide documentation is included but the file kept
     crashing my version of AmigaGuide for some reason.  A text
     file is included and includes a simple tutorial.

     Superb!  Flexer never crashed and was found to be very

@4




     Not many functions for the power user and only one file can
     be worked on at a time but then this program is meant to be
     simple.
