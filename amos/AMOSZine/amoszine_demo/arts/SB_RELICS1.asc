                     RELICS OF DELDRONEYE SOLUTION PART 1
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                @4   Should take around 13 minutes to complete@3

      Relics is one of my personal favourites from the F1 collection and
      as I have completed it I thought it was a good excuse for an article.
      Anyway the only place I got stuck was when trying to find the "Rhino
      leaf" I had to ask the author and when he told me I kicked myself
      because like everything in Relics it's all so obvious, once you know
      the answer, great stuff. So here we go with the first instalment.

      Well that's the easy part of the game. The next part will take a lot
      of explaining. This part of the game took me a few days to suss out
      but is brilliantly done.

      Having escaped from the prison complex, you are now a fugitive.  It's
      fortunate the planet is poorly patrolled.  The worst offender of this
      crime is the port town of Zantis, your next destination.Despite the
      lack of police, you will find Zantis unusually clean and free from
      crime.  Working in the shadow of a deadly syndicate, you must charter
      passage from this world and back to your home, Deldronis.  As all port
      towns are places of trade, your best bet is to blend in and play by
      their rules.  Don't forget your hotel card, its value is more than
      its worth.
