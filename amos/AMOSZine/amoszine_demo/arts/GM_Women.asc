@2                       A WOMAN PROGRAMMERS PERSPECTIVE
                       -------------------------------
@4
  Gina  Mears  is the lady responsible for most of F1's Educational titles,
  such  as  Through  The Red, Tots Time, Rainy Day etc.  I asked her if she
  could do a small article about how she got started:

  Firstly  I`d  like  to  thank  Steve  and Belinda for all their hard work
  sending out reviews etc.

  I`d  also  like  to  say  a big hello to any other female programmers out
  there  trying to cook tea, change the baby and `click buttons' all at the
  same time.

  My  days  of  programming  began  when,  alas  late one night my favorite
  dungeon  game played up and I nievely thought that if I learnt to program
  I could fix it.

  My  daughter  had been complaining that she was bored with the educatioal
  disk  we  had  bought  her  for  Christmas  and so I set about making her
  another.

  Unfortunately  for  my  game, the programming bug bit and my game bit the
  dust.
  @4I  looked at as many different programming languages as I could find, but
  always  found that AMOS had the most to offer and the tutorial support is
  marvellous.   Phil  South`s  -  Mastering  Amiga  Amos  has been the most
  explanitory  book  in my collection and I`m quite sure I`d be bald by now
  if it wasn`t for the AMOS Clubs helpline.

  By  visiting  local schools and collages I have been able to keep in line
  with  the types of work the children are already doing.  If I ever get my
  hands on an old BBC computer I hope to be able to write some software for
  the  special  needs  unit  at the local college, where the youngsters get
  such  fun  from  the  computers  but  the  funds  will not stretch to new
  software.
  
  Both of my children are of school age therefore are never any shortage of
  testers  in  our house.  You can guarantee that any opinions on my latest
  would be masterpiece will be straight to the point from a child.

  The  Wiggle  test  is  my favorite test, this involves putting my friends
  daughter  Abigail  in  front  of  the computer and watching her feet.  If
  Abigail  likes  what  is  on the screen her feet wiggle around.  Loads of
  wiggles  mean  I  must  have got something right, no wiggle and I usually
  have  to  rethink  my  idea.....so  if  Abigail wiggles enough, Steve and
  Belinda get another title to add to their fast growing F1 collection.  @1
