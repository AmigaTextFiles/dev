  This game has been around for a while now but I would like to bring it to
  your  attention.   Written  in  Amos by Lee Wilson, Elevation 2 is a very
  simple  game  to  play.   You  have  to  dodge  elevators  (or  lifts  to
  non-Americans)  and make your way to the top of the screen to rescue your
  missus.   There  are  various  bonus  Icons  like extra lives, slow-down,
  invincibility  etc.  that float down the screen to tempt impatient people
  into  getting  squashed  under  a  lift.   This  game  could be used as a
  psychological  exercise  machine  for  impatient  people  as  you need to
  discipline  your  reactions  and  wait  for the right moment to make your
  move.   It  sounds simple and boring but it's that 8-bit style simplicity
  that  had  me  hooked  from  the  word  go.  I came across E2 while going
  through  some  Assassins  games  disks  (No.124) and I played it straight
  through to level 10, unheard of for me.  This game is more addictive than
  printing counterfeit money.  The author has spent a lot of time polishing
  this  game  and  it  shows.  The presentation is very good with colourful
  graphics  nice tune/samples and neat high score table.  It is rare indeed
  to  come across a PD game with this sort of playability.  A lot of people
  could learn a bit about gameplay from E2.  Okay it's not all roses; is it
  ever?
  The  animation of the main character is err a bit weird, but I think it's
  supposed to be that way, humour you see.  The graphics do the job and are
  colourful enough, but put a good artist on this game and it would enhance
  it a lot.  There is a way I found, that is a sort of cheat.  When you are
  on  a  hard level (3 lifts at once) all you have to do is wait around for
  an  invincibility  bonus  icon to float down, grab that then complete the
  level,  you  may  have  a long wait though and sometimes you have to risk
  dodging  a  lift  to  get it.  You can do the same with extra lives.  The
  answer  to  this  would  be  a  time  limit.  You do get bonus points for
  completing  the  level quickly though, so I guess Lee has already thought
  about  a  time  limit  and  rejected  it, probably with good reason.  Who
  cares?  Leave it as it is.
  As a PD game this is bloody  excellent, well done to Lee for taking the 
  time to make it fun to play.
