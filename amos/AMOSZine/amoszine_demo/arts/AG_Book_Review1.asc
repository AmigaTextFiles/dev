      When I first bought this book I was disappointed with it because
      I had just purchased the Amos Manual and found this book to be
      more of the same !!!

      In other words, this book is a great replacement for anyone who
      uses Classic Amos and has either lost, burned, eaten, etc. their
      original manual.  (Or used it as toilet paper maybe !)

      Well, let's face it - the original Amos Manual was a load of
      S***E !  (and that's me being polite about it !)

      Sure it's a good book for beginners, but I don't think experienced
      Amos users would benefit at all from it.  Maybe that's only my
      opinion.  To be perfectly honest, I didn't learn anything from
      this book at all !!!  Well, I had already moved onto Amos Pro.

      The book does cover just about everything to get you started in
      Amos and I'm sure Phil's book will suit anyone new to Amos.

      It's not a game makers book nor is it a utility makers guide !
      In fact, Mastering Amiga Amos has to be classed as a reference
      to using Amos and maybe when you get stuck with your manual, you
      should refer to this book.  After all, that's what most of these
      type of books are for anyway.

      One thing that really annoyed me about the book was the INDEX !

      The book may be a revised edition, but they forgot to revise the
      Index to match the subjects with the correct page numbers !!!

      This makes finding a command etc. a bit harder than it should be.

      The book covers a wide variety of commands and there is no shortage
      on information for each one covered.  eg. AMAL, Bobs, Chaos Theory,
      Direct Mode, Editor Commands, Fractals, GUI, Hypertext, I/O, Joy,
      Keyboard, Logical Devices, Machine Code, Noisetracker, OctaMed,
      Parallax Scrolling, Ramos, Special Effects, Text, Variables, etc.

      That's just to name a few of the ones covered !!!  So as you can
      see, the book will suit nearly everyone's needs.  Well, unless
      you are like me and can't be bothered to sit and work through all
      the supplied examples !!!  A floppy disk containing the source
      code would have been an excellent bonus.  Especially since the
      book costs so much money !
@5      If you want to write Etch A Sketch, Joystick Tester, Mouse Reader,
      String Sorter or even a small Data Base, then this book has all
      the short examples to get you going.

      Maybe I'm being a bit hard with this review, but it's only one
      man's opinion - why not check it out for yourself and make up
      your own mind ?  After all, everyone's a critic.

      Yeah, why is the book called Mastering AMIGA Amos ?  After all,
      Amos is only available on the Amiga !!!  Hmmmm strange but true.
