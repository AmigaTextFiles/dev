  Another  bumper  issue  spread  over  two  packed disks!    As always the
  Engine has went through some new updating to include new features.    Now
  more attractive than that bird off of Baywatch !

  Mal  Lavery  has contributed in a BIG way with a new on-going tutorial on
  how  to  write  a  game (including full source and graphics etc).    Mike
  (Med) Richmond contributed with loads of music articles.    A new Imagine
  tutorial gets started and loads more stuff you don't want to miss !

  This  is one of the best issues of Amoszine and contains stunning source,
  music and graphics as you would expect.           100% full of goodness !

       This issue is a *MUST* to complete your collection of Amoszine.

                      ------------------------------------ @5
                            New Editor Andy Gibson
      Another  big  bumper  issue  spread  over THREE packed disks!    As
      always the Engine has went through some new updating to include new
      features.   Paul Overy done a whole load of work to the engine  and
      it is now even sexier than Steve Bye !!!  :)

      Loads of source code and articles for every Amos user as always the
      code has been archived and all text files have been crunched so you
      know that you are getting as much as you can for your money.

      No  other  Amos  disk  mag  comes  close to Az when it comes to the
      amount of stuff we cram onto the disks. (I kid you not)

      Features  include  a  tutorial  on how to write your own extensions
      (direct from the author of Power Bobs), New exiting source code and
      graphivs etc.

      This is one issue of Amoszine that you WON'T want to miss .........

                      ------------------------------------ @5

      What  can  we  say?   Yet another sexy three disk issue packed with
      great articles and source code.

      Includes  EXCLUSIVE  source code to the full game of FORTRESS II by
      Lee Bamber, which is worth the asking price alone !!!

      The  Az  driver  has been totally altered for this issue due to the
      fact that it is driven by DMC (Disk Mag Creator) by Andy Gibson.

      Andy  is responsible for many of the great updates to the Az engine
      since  issue  5  and  instead  of  just ripping parts from his ever
      popular  DMC program, he decided to let Az use the full code.  What
      a nice guy.  He's even specially coded it too!

      In  some  peoples opinion, this issue of Az is the best so far, but
      why don't you make up your own mind?

                          !!SORRY, NOW UNAVAILABLE!!
     We needed a good PD version of AZ to spread the word, this is it. It
     contains a selection of articles and source from issues 0,1,2 and 3.
     The intention is to replace issue 0 with this one. 
     Uses V2.7 AZ driver as used on issue 3 and includes 5 music mods.
