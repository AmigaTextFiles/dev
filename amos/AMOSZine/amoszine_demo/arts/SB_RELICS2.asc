                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                @4   Should take around 20 minutes to complete@3
                     
      Relics is one of my personal favourites from the F1 collection and
      as I have completed it I thought it was a good excuse for an article.
      Anyway the only place I got stuck was when trying to find the "Rhino
      leaf" I had to ask the author and when he told me I kicked myself
      because like everything in Relics it's all so obvious, once you know
      the answer, great stuff. So here we go with the second  instalment.

      counter, exit shop. Move to More.
