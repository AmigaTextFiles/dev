      Anyone who uses Classic Amos, Easy Amos or Amos Pro to create
      games should have a copy of this book !
      
      I say games and not utilities as the book covers games creation
      mainly.  However, the book also covers some Amos Extensions and
      Amos Utilities such as the Compiler and Amos 3D etc.
      
      Anyone who received Amos from a coverdisk and haven't purchased
      the manual could learn a thing or two from this book also as it
      is filled with some great examples that even first time users
      should be able to follow.  These can either be typed in straight
      from the book or simply loaded in from the supplied floppy disk.
      
      Jason's book starts off explaining what Amos is and how to use
      each version - even taking a look at the Amos Monitor !
      
      Just about everything you need to know about creating a game is
      covered in this book.  From program planning to getting your
      game published. Although, you have already had a great detailed
      explanation on that subject in previous issues of AZ. @1:) @5
      Apparently, Jason has programmed in C, Assembler, Cobol, Pascal
      and of course Amos.  Which is a good thing really as the book
      wouldn't be any use to us otherwise !!!
      
      Although I said this book could easily be followed by first time
      Amos users, I do feel that Jason is also aiming the book towards
      experienced Amos programmers too !
      
      It would be almost impossible to write a book that would cover
      the needs for all Amos programmers, but Jason has made a great
      attempt at it.  Don't just take my word for it - buy the book and
      see for yourself.

      Although the book was released via Amiga Format, you should be
      able to pick a copy up in any Virgin Games Department.  Failing
      that, contact Amiga Format / Shopper for more details.
