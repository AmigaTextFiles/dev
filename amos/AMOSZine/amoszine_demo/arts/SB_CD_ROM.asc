     If you harken back to the good old days of issue 2 you may recall my 
     mutterings in the News section about the Amos C.D. Well after a lot
     of dithering I finally went out and bought a Zappo CD ROM, mainly so I
     could make use of the Amos CD and all the other tremdous PD compliations
     out there. Before I go head on into reviewing the Amos CD I would like 
     to tell you a little story, (c) Max B.

     When I bought my A1200, I got it from Curry's on credit, I thought the
     extra two year on site warranty for £100 was a good deal.
     As it turned out, it was. When my 1200 was Just over one year old the
     internal drive went loopy, it got fixed. Two months later the keyboard
     started acting up, new keyboard fitted, no probs. Now the power supply 
     keeps cutting out! I think I will have had my £100 quids worth. 
     I reckon the manufacturers somehow get their equipment to
     self destruct after the one year guaruntee has run out! Anyway long
     before all this happened I decided to purchase a hard drive for my A1200
     I didn't want a self-fit internal as it would invalidate my warranty
     with Curry's, at the time I couldn't spare the Amiga to be sent off for
     fitting so I decided on the Overdrive external PCMIA jobbet. Wow what a
     fantastic drive, 250 Megs and greased lightning. Have you sussed what I
     am getting at yet? 
     So, I now need a C.D ROM. As I said last issue I had decided to wait 
     for the trap-door version from Commodore, I soon realized this piece of
     hardware could be "vapourware" or at the very least unlikely to emerge
     this side of christmas. So my alternative was the Zappo from Archos, 
     the same peeps who make the Overdrive Hard drive I had hanging out my 
     PCMIA port. Now you know what I am getting at, yes? 
     
     I bought the Zappo in October knowing full well that I couln't run the 
     CD and my HD in unision, a bind but worth it. So that is why I have to 
     boot my CD software from floppy. It also means anything I want copied 
     from a CD onto my HD has to first be copied to floppy, I then have to 
     dismantle the CD ROM and set up the HD. Bloody hell! what a pain the
     butt! I don't know if it's feasible to have two periph's in the PCMIA
     at once, but if it is ARCHOS should seriously consider knocking out an 
     adaptor so we can run their HD with thier CD ROM.

     One other thing, I bought my Zappo from the First Computer Centre in
     Leeds by credit card, the salesman promised me they had the new V9.0
     software for the Zappo as V8.0 was well and truly bugged, so bad was
     it that a lot of retailers sent back the Zappos to Archos thinking the
     hardware was at fault. When I received the CD, you guessed it, the GIT
     was LYING. I bloody hate that, sales-people, ohhh it makes me want to
     stamp my tiny feet. To cut a very long story short I got the update off
     off a FRIEND (cheers Mal) I still hassled First Computer Centre and I
     still have not received the update. So, as far as I am concerned, they
     are the LAST COMPUTER CENTRE ON EARTH I would buy anything from again.
     I was impressed by the speed of the service though.

     Right to finish up this article, which may turn out to be an occasional
     column, I will, at last, review the Amos CD.@1











                       THE OFFICIAL AMOS PD LIBRARY CD
                       ===============================
      Weird Science £19.99 (Shop around and get it for about £17 or less)

      After a few hours of browsing through the contents of the CD I was a
      bit taken aback by the amount of disks that were "Removed" I counted
      at least 40 disks missing, this isn't the current Amos PD's fault, 
      the disks were removed by the infamous Sandra Sharkey who originally
      started the Amos PDL. Still, I feel my CD is 40 odd disks short! but
      there is so much on this CD does it really matter?
  
      If you are looking for good source code you can forget the first 400
      disks as they are mainly music/samples/graphics and ancient (ie. Crap)
      source. But the remaining 200 or so disks really make up for with
      oddles of cool source, ranging from crap, jerky scroll routines to
      excellent full blown utilities and games. If you are stuck on a certain
      programming task then 99% of the time there will be a routine you can
      inspect that will help you. In all there are over 1600 source code
      files on the CD alone.
      
      All the disks have been put in their own drawer for easy selection,
      and there are drawers that replicate parts of the CD, like all the
      source from all the disks in one place, which I thought was great at
      first until I realized a lot of the routines had their external files,
      missing and so were unusable rendering the idea virtually usless, 
      maybe it was to help fill the CD? I don't think so, I reckon it was 
      well intentioned.
  
      There are a lot of graphics on here too, that can be very useful to
      non-artists, the same goes for the ABK mods and samples, C-Text fonts,
      and about 100 sprite banks.
   
      The CD also includes Totally Amos 1-6, a nice touch, but why not 1-14
      or more? You also get SID a file manipulator, similar to Filemaster
      but really crap! I hate this piece of junk, everyone has been saying
      how good it is for years, when we all know it's about as friendly as
      Saddam Hussain. Opps, probably upset a few of the old guard there! I
      know, I'm just a lamer. Use Filemaster.  
      
      Other items on the CD are Workbenches 1.3/2.0 and 3.0 as well as 
      Sernet and Parnet (no grumbles there dudes) 
    
      The Amos CD works fine on CDTV, CD32 and my Zappo perfectly.

      To sum up then:

      We should be happy and grateful this CD exists. Although it has a few
      shortcomings I can't see how any serious Amos user could sleep at
      night knowing what they are missing. Roll on Amos CD 2.

      Next issue I may review my Crappo, sorry, Zappo CD ROM and possibly
      the Aminet CD which has an Amos section.
