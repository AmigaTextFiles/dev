      the 14,39 is the top right coordinates of the portion to clear        
      and the 305,70 is the bottom left coordinates                         

      This can be a very useful command but is overlooked by a lot of people

      ---------------                                                       

      Here is a neat little four liner that will display the colours of the 
      current palette in use, like in an art package.                       
                                                                            
      FOR L=0 TO 15: INK L                `set to loop 16 times 0-15        
      BAR (L+1)*16,170 TO (L+2)*16,177    `Draw a filled box in INK colour(L
      NEXT L                              `If L is less than 15 repeat loop 
      STOP                                `Loop finished                    
                                                                            
      This will draw 16 filled boxes using the BAR instruction.             
      each box will be filled with the current INK colour which is changed by
      the FOR NEXT loop using INK L, L starts off with the value 0 and
      every time the program hits the NEXT L line it checks L is less than 15
      and if so adds 1 to L, when L eventually is equal to 15 the loop is 
      completed and the STOP instruction is executed ending the program.

      -----------------
      This is the screen wipe used on the loading screen of Amoszine 1.

      DRAW 0,199 TO X,0                                                     
      NEXT X                                                                
      FOR Y=1 TO 199                                                        
      DRAW 0,199 TO 319,Y                                                   
      NEXT Y
                                                                            
      Centre Text V2                                                        
      --------------                                                        
      This is a handy routine that will centre any text inside T$ on to the 
      screen This works for both horizontally and vertically, unlike the 
      CENTRE command. 
                                                                            
      T$="MONGOLIAN INTRUDERS FROM PLANET RED"         ` Put some text in T$
      A=LEN(T$)                                        ` How long is it?    
      TEXT SCREEN WIDTH/2 - (A*8/2), SCREEN HEIGHT/2,T$` See below          
                                                                            
      First we put the message we want printed into T$ and then A is told to
      hold the length of T$.                                                
                                                                            
      TEXT is very similar to print except it can place the TEXT cursor 
      anywhere on screen to a pixel, where as LOCATE and PRINT can only be 
      defined by 8 pixels (or one character square if you like.)            
                                                                            
      SCREEN WIDTH returns the WIDTH of the SCREEN and SCREEN HEIGHT does 
      what you would expect.  The calculation performed gives the exact 
      central x,y position on the screen to place the text in T$, for example
      SCREEN HEIGHT/2 will be exactly half way down the screen, 
      SCREEN WIDTH/2 half way across.   
                                                                            
      This is the routine Lee Bamber wrote for the clock we use in Amoszine.
