    People used to look down on PD thinking it was a cheap realm where   
   nothing existed apart from poor-quality games (mainly commercial      
   rip-offs), boring slideshows and stunning but incredibly repetitive   
   demos. But in recent years this seems to have changed - the overall   
   `cheap' label still remains (and to a great extent so does the `poor  
   quality' one) but PD is now filled with far better disks than ever    
   before. The Shareware and Licenceware markets have also become bigger 
   and better, with many magazine coverdisks featuring programs from both
   of these outlets.                                                     
                                                                         
    But what about originality? Games have certainly become better with  
   some of the most recent releases being nothing short of brilliant.    
   However, as Paul Cuipek of NBS Public Domain Library told us in issue 
   2 of "Amiga Pro" magazine, the single-man programmer is slowly dying  
   out. As hi-tech CD technology grows ever bigger, so shrinks the market
   for freelance coders and, I suspect sadly, the PD market itself. I    
   predict a sharp rise in the quality and originality of PD productions 
   just before the CD revolution takes over. Whether I am right, God only
   knows but until then, I for one certainly hope to take PD to the      
   limits.                                                               
    So what's this article about then? How Andrew Campbell intends to    
   push his software over the edge? Partly, yes. I've been examining a   
   lot of PD productions and library catalogues lately and trying to find
   any `missing markets'. Not easy, I can assure you; at first glance PD 
   seems to have a low-cost answer to just about every kind of software  
   on sale. Obviously there are exceptions; who's going to write a       
   Brilliance-beating art package and release it as a Shareware disk     
   (apart from some one as crazy as me)? Not many. Perhaps the best you  
   can expect from a PD disk is semi-commercial quality (okay, just-     
   about-on-par with commercial quality if the program is Shareware or   
   Licenceware. Satisfied?). So, lets take a quick look at what's        
   currently available shall we?                                         
                                                                         
    Of course there are millions of games, but only a small proportion   
   actually sell hundreds of copies. Browsing through a popular PD       
   library's advertisement, what do I see? The same names appearing every
   time - "Ork Attack" (supposedly the goriest game in PD. Ha! I think   
   not. Crap and severely overated is more like it), "Deluxe Galaga" (a  
   super-smooth Galaxians clone - good but far from original), "Road To  
   Hell" (more tired clones), "Dithell In Space" (please God not another 
   platformer), "Black Dawn" (the `nearest thing to Hired Guns yet'      
   according to one library. No comment because I coded it!) and the ever
   popular "Megaball" (Goddamned breakout clones! Argh!).                
                                                                         
    Far more interesting than all the above titles are games like "Raise 
   The Titanic" (a great idea for a 3D Construction Kit Game), "Numerix" 
   (smart, original puzzle game) and "Sensible Massacre" (now this is a  
   good example of PD as a means of self-expression!!).                  
                                                                         
    I really couldn't find anything missing, apart from a decent         
   "Lemmings"/"Troddlers" clone (my own "White Rabbits" isn't bad but    
   it's more of a sliding puzzler than a save-em-up). Some one has yet to
   write a game as technically impressive as "Doom" (or even the now     
   quite dated "Wolfenstien 3D") as seen on the PC, but I guess that's   
   asking a bit too much.                                                
                                                                         
    Utilities and Educational software is perhaps Amiga PD's strongest   
   point. "Text Engine" (superb, solid Word Proccessor), "D-Copy" (just  
   as good as "X-Copy"), "MessySid" (multi-format disk/file handler),    
   "ProTracker 3" (commercial quality music maker) and "Power Packer"    
   (amazing file-cruncher) are just a fraction of the fantastic tools    
   available for just over the price of a disk.                          
                                                                         
    Recently there has been an increase in the number of kid's programs -
   my own "Artistix" (the success of which has been printed in several PD
   magazines) seems to have started off a chain of children's art        
   programs such as "Art School", "AZ Paint", "Kids Paint" and "Smarty   
   Paints" (or the sudden appearance of educational stuff could be a     
   coincidence in which case I apologise for trying to premote myself as 
   the creator of a new trend!). Educational software is extremely       
   worthwhile and often very rewarding to the programmer - in this area  
   of PD originality thrives! I say no more.                             
                                                                         
    More PD originality appears in the form of animations, though most   
   seem to be merely sick jokes rather than anything else (eg. "Suicide  
   Man"). Floppy disks and low-memory severely limit this potentially    
   exciting means of showing talent/making yourself heard.               
                                                                         
    Similarly, slideshows are often original, though tend to sell less   
   copies due to the "boring" label that shrouds them. Talented artists  
   can freely advertise examples of their work through PD in the hope of 
   attracting commercial interest, unusual styles and techniques can be  
   shown to the world, and of course, the female body can be exploited in
   256-colour AGA scans (which is why all pervs own A1200's I'm told).   
   Apart from the odd experimental disk that really makes a change, art  
   on the Amiga is far from varied, the only slideshows with a decent    
   "theme" being the ever-dull "Star Trek" clones. Definitely a lacking  
   area (quite what is lacking I can't seem to pin-point but there is    
   something).                                                           
                                                                         
    The majority of disk magazines are as dull as ever too, bursting at  
   the seams with unneccessarily offensive language, tedious "Top 10"    
   charts, galleries of "scene" party snapshots and big-headed articles  
   about how "lame" every non-machine coding Amiga user is.              
                                                                         
    You get the odd giggle out of "Grapevine", "Visual Intensity" and the
   like but rarely much else. Sensible, useful diskmags such as the      
   excellent "Amoszine", and Cybercraft's superb "Shareworld" are far    
   more worthy purchases if you want serious, interesting articles (like 
   this one - hehe!). Okay so the presentation is hardly as polished but 
   you're unlikely to find any offensive or sexist jokes thrown in "just 
   for the laugh" and you won't be made to feel like a "lamer" for owning
   an Amiga, either.                                                     
                                                                         
    Short-stories have appeared in the PD scene on occasion, perhaps most
   recently in the form of "The Quatermass Experiment" (a science-fiction
   diskmag and a "platform for new and aspiring writers") but are such   
   productions worth buying? Surely reading a whole story from your      
   monitor screen would give you a major headache, never mind fail to    
   hold your attention. Not so; "The Quatermass Experiment" is a superb  
   read (you can print the stories, too) and a fantastic idea for a new  
   PD realm. Add my own "Dark Portal" short-horror-story compilation and 
   Ivan Millett's epic on-disk novel "Deus Ex Machina" and you're talking
   about a new, limitless form of PD that, given a chance, could allow   
   talented writers an alternative way in to the commercial book-        
   publishing market. I have my own plans to shift this area of PD into  
   the mainstream with the release of "Dark Portal Edition 2" and later, 
   I hope, a true on-disk novel.                                         
                                                                         
    Well, I've trampled through a jungle of PD and Shareware disks and to
   be honest I don't think I've got a good enough excuse to compain. The 
   market is massive, varied, full of life, and it's cheap too - what    
   more could I possibly want? Apart from the odd gripe where originality
   is concerned and the hopefully soon-to-be-corrected lack of a decent  
   writers' market, I'm perfectly happy with PD at the moment.           
                                                                         
    My up-and-coming releases? The biggest, fastest Shareware `Dungeon   
   Master' game ever, a collection of short-stories which break down the 
   walls of insanity, and a dangerously emotional on-disk novel that I   
   hope will encourage others to express themselves through the wonderful
   realm that is - PD.@2
                                                   
   END.
