  You  probably  all know how to use arrays in AMOS.  If not you`re missing
  out  on  a  treat  that  is  needed  to  fully appreciate the programming
  language.
@3
  An  array  is  a  storage  area  in  the  computer`s memory.  Just like a
  variable  it  is  given  a name, but it is also given a size.  Because of
  this it is important to set it up before it can be used.
@5
  To do this use the command:
@1
  Dim ARRAY(N) -where ARRAY is the name of the array
                      N is the size of the array.
@4
  The  array  name  follows  the  standard  format of variables in AMOS, eg
  NUMBERS  for  numeric  data  or LETTER$ for words.  The command creates a
  series  of  boxes numbered from 0 to N that can each be written to in the
  same  way  as  any other variable (provided the number part or element of
  the array is specified).

@4  Each  element  will  initially  be blank, that`s the equivalent of 0 in a
  numerical array or "" in any other.
@3
  For  example try this program to create an array in AMOS and fill it from
  random numbers.
@1

  Dim NUMBERS(10)

  For COUNTER=0 To 10
    NUMBERS(COUNTER)=Rnd(9)+1
  Next COUNTER

@5
  This  is  the equivalent of creating 11 variables and filling them with a
  number  from  1 to 10.  As I`m sure you`ll appreciate this is a much more
  efficient  method and has the advantage that it is much easier to call up
  a  particular  value.   Arrays have major uses in any of today`s games or
  application programs.
