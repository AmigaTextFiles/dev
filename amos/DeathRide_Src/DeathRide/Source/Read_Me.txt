                               ------------------------

To start with...
----------------

This source code is OLD (circa 1992) and I haven't touched it for ages, which
is why I have decided to release it.

Looking back over it, I consider it extremely badly coded, so please don't
consider any of it as an example of how to program. :)

Development was done under AMOS v1.3. At the time, I had a lowly 1Mb A500 with
two floppy drives and no hard disk. Eeek.

The files and their organisation
--------------------------------

  DeathRide.AMOS         -  AMOS source code.

  DeathRide_Compile.AMOS -  The same source, with just a couple of lines
                            modified ready for compilation.

  Pictures/              -  Contains the IFF screens used.

  Music/                 -  Contains the music used (Soundtracker format).

  Sample_Banks/          -  The sample banks (in AMOS bank format).

  RAW_Samples/           -  IFF format samples.


Please note that the .AMOS files themselves already contain all the other
files in standard AMOS bank format. Also note that the RAW samples were
converted into AMOS sample banks for inclusion in this way.
