                            Introduction (Why?)
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Okay,  I  know  that  this isn't an original idea for a game. There must be
thousands of Tron clones out there for a 101 different makes of  computers.
So why did I decide to write Death Ride? (Tristan here by the way).

Well, Simon and  I  had  just  been  playing  yet another Tron clone. I was
telling him how easy it was to write such a game so  he  turned  round  and
said to me: "Well, go on then, write one!".  So I did.

The  basic  framework took about 10 minutes to knock together. But I wanted
more. So I added another feature. But  I  wanted  even  more.  So  I  added
another feature.  And this went on, and on, and on..........

And  now  it's  here.  Full  to the brim with different features, digitised
sound FX and music.  So read on.........


                           Introduction (What?)
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Come on, EVERYONE knows what a Tron game is about. You  don't?  Where  have
you been the last few decades?  Well,  it's  simple  really.  In  the  film
Tron  (A  great  film, by the way) the contestants had to drive their light
cycles  around  an  arena,  trying  to  kill  their  opponents. Their light
cycles left trails behind them, and if a cycle hit one of  these  trails  -
KABAM!  Another problem is that the light cycles didn't have brakes.

Death  Ride  is  a  simulation of this 'sport'. You're presented with a top
down view of the action. Up to four human players can take part at  a  time
and  the  sole  survivor  is  the  winner.  I've added a few extra features
(Such as obstacles, gates and power ups) to make it a bit more fun.

So, welcome to Death Ride.
 
                               Requirements
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Er, well, 512k owners arn't going to like this but  you  need  at  least  1
megabyte  of  memory  to  run  this  game. Go down to your nearest computer
shop and buy an upgrade, they only cost about £20 nowadays.

Oh, memory gets a bit tight sometimes so disable your external disk  drives
if you've got any.

                               The Main Menu
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once  the  game  has  finished  loading  a  few  intro screens will appear,
displaying the infamous Apocalypse  logo  along  with  the  credits.  After
that  the  menu will appear along with a crosshair pointer. You can control
this using the mouse or with a joystick.

There are three options which you can select, namely:

         BEGIN ........ Starts the game.
         OPTIONS ...... Goes directly to the options screen.
         EXIT ......... Go on, make a guess.  Yep, it exits from the game.

                                  Options
                                  ^^^^^^^

A  screen  full  of  options  will  appear  on  the screen. The options are
changed by moving the pointer on them  and  pressing  FIRE.  Keep  pressing
FIRE  until  you  are  happy with the option. Select RETURN TO MAIN MENU to
go back to the main menu.

The options are:

PLAYERS
GAME SPEED
BIKE SPEED
TURBO MODE
NUMBER OF OBSTACLES
SIZE OF OBSTACLES
OBSTACLE SHAPE
RANDOM OBSTACLES
RANDOM OBSTACLE FREQUENCY
POWER UPS
POWER UP FREQUENCY
GATE OPENING FREQUENCY
SOUND

That's  all  very  well, but what do all those options mean? Well, here's a
handy guide to what the options do, as well as how they affect  the  actual
game.

PLAYERS
-------
Death  Ride  can cope with up to 4 players at once, two on the joystick and
two on the keyboard. Details on controlling them can be found later  on  in
the  documentation.  This option toggles how many players will be involved.

GAME SPEED
----------
This can be altered to suit your needs. If you want  a  fast  paced  action
game  then  make  this  a  low  number.  If  you'd rather have a sedate and
boring game then make it high.

BIKE SPEED
----------
How many pixels (I.e, dots) your bike moves at a time. The higher  this  is
the  faster  your  bike  will appear to move. Note that a high setting will
make your bike jerk a bit as well as lowering how precise you can  be  when
moving.

TURBO MODE
----------
This  can  either be on or off. When it is on you will be able to switch on
your turbos during the game. The turbos will let you move at  double  speed
whenever  you  require  it.  Details  on  how  to  activate  your turbo are
mentioned later on.

NUMBER OF OBSTACLES
-------------------
If you'd like to  add  more  danger  to  the  game  you  can  instruct  the
computer  to  place  obstacles  on  the  screen  at random positions at the
beginning of the game. Simply adjust  the  number  to  how  many  obstacles
you'd like.

SIZE OF OBSTACLES
-----------------
This  adjusts  the size of the obstacles. The higher the number, the bigger
the obstacles.

OBSTACLE SHAPE
--------------
For variety's sake, you can adjust the shape of the  obstacles.  There  are
two different shapes to choose from - Squares and circles.

RANDOM OBSTACLES
----------------
To  get  the  adrenalin  going  you  can  instruct  the  computer  to place
obstacles on the screen at random  positions  DURING  the  game.  If  you'd
like this to happen then set this to ON.

RANDOM OBSTACLE FREQUENCY
-------------------------
How  often  a  random  obstacle will appear on the screen. This is measured
in seconds.

POWER UPS
---------
What game would be complete without some power ups, eh? This  toggles  them
on and off.

POWER UP FREQUENCY
------------------
How  often  a  power  up  will  appear  on  the screen. This is measured in
seconds.

GATE OPENING FREQUENCY
----------------------
How often the gates will  open  during  the  game  (Measured  in  seconds).
Driving  through  a gate could save your life at times! (Though it's a good
idea to make sure it's open first).

SOUND
-----
There are four different sound settings: NONE (For a  silent  game),  SOUND
FX  (Explosions  and  the  like  - All digitised) and MUSIC (To listen to a
nice tune).


                                 The Game
                                 ^^^^^^^^

When  you  have  selected  BEGIN  from the main menu the game will commence
immediately. The players will be positioned in the centre  of  the  screen,
all heading upwards.  The colours are:

Player One           BROWN
Player Two           WHITE
Player Three         GREY
Player Four          RED

The controls are:

Player One:                A joystick in port 2 (The joystick port).
Player Two:                A joystick in port 1 (The mouse port).
Player Three:              Z = LEFT  X = RIGHT  F = UP  C = DOWN
Player Four:               1 = LEFT  2 = RIGHT  6 = UP  3 = DOWN
(Note: Player Four should use the numeric keypad for control!)

Once  a direction is selected, the player will keep going in that direction
until another direction is selected. Be careful not to crash  into  any  of
the  walls,  and don't double back on yourself! If you do crash you will be
out of the game. The winner is the player who survives  the  longest.  When
only  one  player  remains  the  game  will  end  and  a scoreboard will be
displayed.

(Pressing Q during the game returns you to the main menu)

Turbo Mode
----------

Joystick users can engage TURBO MODE by pressing  FIRE.  This  will  double
their  speed  while  the  button is held down. Release the button to return
to normal speed.

Keyboard users (Players  3  and  4)  engage  their  turbos  in  a  slightly
different  way.  Pressing  their  turbo key (See below) will toggle whether
their turbos are engaged.

PLAYER 3:  G      PLAYER 4: .

Gates
-----

You may notice gaps appearing at the top and bottom of  the  screen.  These
are  GATES.  If you pass through a gate while it is open you will re-appear
at the opposite gate, heading in the same direction.

Power Ups
---------

Every so often a power up will appear on the screen.  These  are  coloured,
circles.  By  driving  through  one  of  these a special effect will occur,
depending on the colour of the power up.

GREEN:      You will be given a shield.  This allows you to drive through
            a wall ONCE and survive!

BLUE:       Wipes the screen of all obstacles and trails.

GREY:       Holds the gates open for three times as long as normal.


                                 Greetings
                                 ^^^^^^^^^

Rather  than  bore  you by putting the greetings in the game we're going to
bore you by putting them here.

First of all, many thanks go to David Goodwin,  Darren  Gregory  and  Simon
Gregory  for  playtesting  this  game.  Apart  from  having  fun  you  were
actually helping us develop it!

Thanks also to Aquamarine/The Wall for  writing  the  original  Death  Ride
tune  (It  was  originally  going to be included). Sorry that we never used
it in the end, but we scrapped  the  original  intro.  Maybe  in  our  next
release, eh?
