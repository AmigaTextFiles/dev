Okay, 600. It's a limit (loose one) for how much chip your segment should use
maximum. You can have 50 Megs of data for CHIP memory, as long as non AGA
amigas can play the game. We don't want to make a game that ends up isolating
some of our target audience.

Right now, I'd prefer you concentrate on finishing.

Your only limits are those put forth on the list page texts. At this point,
out entire game intro consists of an amos list screen.

Hello,

This isn't AMOS related really but I thought some of the list members
might be interested in it.  

I am heading up a entertainment project for the Amiga which has a
PROPOSED release date of November 1.  I am writing to find out if there
are any graphics artists here that might be interested in doing some work
for our project. The type of artwork we need is full screen custom images
(no bobs, sprites, etc.) in the fantasy genre, but they must be original
creations. The artist will retain the copyright to his/her work, can include
a signature on the piece, and will be mentioned in the credits, but we will
have full rights to use this artwork in our projects and make some
minor modifications if the need arises.  Artists will receive compensation
for their work, but what form it takes is negotiable.  For example, you
might prefer a fixed royalty off of each program sold.  Others might prefer
a flat buy-out where they are paid a one time sum of money, and the purchaser
gains rights to use (not own) the particular piece of art.  I know that
lots of people are busy working on the list games but if you
might be interested in our offer, please contact us, and let us know your
prefered form and amount of payment you desire.  Feel free to
write if you simply have any questions.  We will consider all offers.

Thank you.

Robert

   Understood. 600k MAXIMUM Total Run-time ChipRAM usage...

   Okay, will do. Since the weekends alone weren't enough time to
   make substantial progress on the Shooter, I have devoted a few
   weekdays in an attempt to accelerate the development!!

   Current version:
   - Bubba is firing and the enemies are blowing up
   - Power-ups are occasionally released
   - Phase One is now utilizing 33% of the full stage size

   Next:
1. Bubba needs to pick up the power-ups, gaining shields,
   firepower, etc.
2. Phase One needs to extend to use 60% of the stage...
3. Fine-tuning (must have good game-play)...
  --------------------
   = SideShooterDemo3 (fully-working Phase One)
   


   How are the other stages progressing? Any new demos going up
   soon?


 
      Take care,

       Garfield

Gday Amos People

I would like to use some amal code to
firstly click on a bob with the mouse to activate it
and then use the mouse to point only that bob in the direction
it is to travel, Plus I would like it to travel at a constant
speed.

I can already get the bob to follow the mouse that parts easy, 
but I am having trouble with the other parts.

Can anybody help me please ?

Hi 2 All :)

I need to use AmosOpal extension but on Aminet is only version for Amos 1.3.
Maybe someone have version recompiled for AmosPro ( they are on Aminet
C-sources for this extension but I`m not good in C).

Any help welcome !

Jacek

Don't worry... I agree fully with you. Most of my ideas were based on
producing text-adventures as I think that's one of the best ways to tell a story... But I'd be more than happy to give my ideas to someone 
else so he can make something out of them...

Looks nice! :)

Evert? Haven't seen much of you lately?  If your offer for sending ideas
is still open,  I will always most graciously accept.  I've made an
advance in my parser and input handling.  C-Ya.  Ken
P.S. this e-mail might accidentally be sent to Mushy's address
        instead of the trash drawer...Is it a coincidence or does
        everyone have Mushy's e-mail address IN THEIR TRASH DRAWER?
    I hope he has a sense of humor. :)

  Hi all:

  I'm glad to be back on the list after a long time without using amos.
  I have amos pro but never got the compiler (is not sold in the US)(I got
the 1.3 compiler but I need the Pro compiler :( ).
   Please somebody in the US reply to me to sell me the Pro compiler,
original or copy, as I can bear no longer not to have it.
  Also, is there any extension that lets you display ham hireslaced pics
in amospro? I got Intos but never could make it work.

   Thank you,

     Fernando Bartra

Hello everyone. This is just a short message to say that I'm back, 
and I'm currently at the moment sifting through my 100+ messages. No, 
I haven't read ANY except for a couple, so don't any of you respond 
to this message. I'm going to catch up and finish reading all of my 
messages here, and then I'm off to download all of the new files and 
bits on Giark's game pages.

Well, I came across this message from Giark, and haven't read down 
any further, so I don't know if there are any replies on it or not.

> 1. Save game position. Nothing worse than having
> to start from the beginning every time.

Yes, having to restart at the beginning of a level IS a pain. Most 
computer games (especially most 3D games) today have the 
option/function of saving your game where you are.

hehe. "Quarter feeding mentality". Good one. Anyhow, this is also a 
good idea, and I was going to ask you if you or any of the other 
coders had thought about implementing some cheat codes into the game?

Greetings.

Well, found one thing I'm gonna comment on as far as the List game is
concerned: graphics (and the such).

Firstly, Andy Hawkins fumed. :)

> Hey who said I was out of the GFX scene?
No one as far as I know, and certainly not me. When I sent that last
graphics message to the list before I went on vacation about Schito
leaving and such, I forgot that you were also doing graphics as well
as a level (Giark hadn't told me anything or anyone on his pages).

> And the same goes for all you guys (coders et al).  I`m taking
> requests, I told Mr. Giark to send graphics requests to me but I
> guess you missed it. Anyway, so I`m here waiting.

I assume that since Schito is out of the graphics scene now that it's
just you and me (am I correct Giark)? I will take any graphics
requests as well, but please, don't send all of them to me.

> Anything you want? Cartoon gfx, renders, backdrops, scenery, 
> clouds, walls, anything. Just start sending the specs and I`ll start
> working. Adam Parrot you should be ashamed of your self :o)

I can do *all* of the above as well, which is a good thing.

I'm not trying to vy for neither competition nor the spotlight. I
would love to work as a team and have us both work on the graphics,
but as it is I'm working on my raycaster and it's enough to do some
graphics and coding at the same time (which I'm sure that you are well
aware of having worked on games like this before).

Most of my work is done in either Lightwave and/or 3D modelling on my
PC, as you may have observed from the 3 AMOS List iff/jpeg's.

Keith Hill commented on the amount of enemies:

> More than 20 or 30 enemies per level would probably break the 
> chip-mem limit...  ;-)  The current demo (3) has 12 enemies for
> reference. (including rampant amos lettering)

This *certainly* applies for my level. In my level, the CPU is 
already going to be loaded down enough namely because of 
calculations and everything else that goes into a raycaster in a 3D
stage like that, but, I'll do my best.

John Bintz also told me:

> Flattery will get you nowhere, Mr. Parrott.
This I know, I wasn't making an attempt at flatery, just commenting on
the quality of the graphic work I've seen in some of your games. It
was intended as a comment, and I figured we could use your help.

To the one known as Ken,
I wanna know if two rectancles overlap, one corner, many corners, or
whatever.  Like collision detection.  Not sure how to explain better really.

Hmmm....Let me see if this is what you're trying to do:
Box (or Bar) x1,y1 to x2,y2    That puts the first rectangle down
I would sugget Zone-ing the area of the rectangle1.
Set Zone 1,x1,y1 to x2,y2
Now, overlap rectangle1 with rectangle2
Box x3,y3 to x4,y4 : Set Zone 2,x3,y3 to x4,y4
Zone 1 has priority: You can set overlapping zones, but
Zone(x,y) will return the zone number that was set first.
Let's say rectangle2's lower left corner was overlapping
rectangle1, as well as, Zone 2 overlapping Zone 1.
I would have 4 tests to see if each corner of the rectangle2
was overlapping:
  If Zone(x3,y3)  'upper-left            
        do something                     
  End If                                      
                                                            
  If Zone(x3,y4)  'lower-left           
  If Zone(x4,y3)  'upper-right
  If Zone(x4,y4)  'lower-right
Any positive value means there's overlap.

I hope this is what your after.  Ken

Actually I wouldn't Set Zone for rectangle 2 until
after the 4 corners are tested.  Zone 2 would've been 
detected if there were no overlap to occur.  So I repeat
don't Set a Zone for the rectangle that will overlap until
you check where its corners are.

I had a similar problem downloading the files from my PC if you 
remember awhile back using Netscape. However I found that using IE
(amazingly!) that it downloaded the files correctly, corrupt-free.

If you don't have it, and you're using a PC, I'm not sure WHAT you
could use. Maybe someone else could recommend another browser (I'm not
sure what, though). All I can say is DON'T use Netscape for
downloading the files off of Giark's pages.

of the mail coming to and fro, so, since I still have my Geocities 
web and email accounts, I'm to reactivate my old Geocities e-mail 
account and have my List mail sent to there. Also, everyone that made 
note of my email change to parrottsoft@emails.com, please change it 
back to parrottsoft@geocities.com again. Sorry for any problems. The 
old one just didn't do (wasn't stable).

Also, because of this instability on my emails.com account, it seems 
that some of my mail from the List was deleted (I think). I had my 
mail checked this past Saturday, but, lo and behold that the last 
peice of mail was from Rune J. Keller dated last Wednesday, the 25th. 
My mail was checked on the 28th, this past Saturday. It seems that 
I've missed something, and ALL mail that was sent to my emails.com 
account (personal and business related, like the List) had been 
deleted lost. If you sent anything TO that address, then PLEASE 
resend it, and ANYONE out there that has ALL of the messages from 
last Wednesday till now (this past weeks worth), PLEASE send ALL of 
them to me in a .lha or .zip or something. I would be most grateful.

I had a similar problem downloading the files from my PC if you 
remember awhile back using Netscape. However I found that using IE
(amazingly!) that it downloaded the files correctly, corrupt-free.

If you don't have it, and you're using a PC, I'm not sure WHAT you
could use. Maybe someone else could recommend another browser (I'm not
sure what, though). All I can say is DON'T use Netscape for
downloading the files off of Giark's pages.

Well, you may know that I had that problem some weeks ago when Giark 
first put his page up. I tried downloading with Netscape, but it 
didn't work, and I tried EVERYTHING to get the files to download 
correctly.

Many suggestions poured in, but only one that was suggested to me 
worked. "Have you tried IE?" I had not, so I did. And guess what? It 
worked. Now as to whether or not it will work for you, I don't know.
I don't know of any other browsers that you might have on your PC. IE 
and Netscape are the most popular and I have them both. Even though I 
use Netscape the most, IE is the ONLY one that I can find that will 
work and download Giark's files correctly, corrupt-free.

All I can say is DON'T use Netscape for it.

Hi,
   I have resent this email 4 times over the last week and hope it has
finally got through:

Hello,
      I have had a major problem to my CB bonus level,
When I loaded it up on the 29th to compile a demo my disk made some 
'orrible grinding noises and refused to find the file!
Unfortunatly while i'm in the usual habit of keeping backups I lost the 
disk the backup source file was on.   
Out came my copy of disksalv and about 10 mins later I had the file 
back.
I first checked it with an ascii editor and the file appeared to be 
intact but upon loading into amospro it stopped loading in the middle
on the 6th line.
No errr mesages, It just thought the file had ended!

Anyone got any suggestions? I have of course started rewriting but at 
this rate  wont get it finished for the June 30th deadline!


-- James


PS:  The deadline has now expired and the level is barely what it was!

    ANNOUNCEMENT - Mushroom PD announces its new FTP server
  SPACE INCREASE - Library space increased by over 400%!!
HOMEPAGE CHANGES - Exciting new services available on the MPD Homepages


ANNOUNCEMENT
------------
    I would like to announce the official release of the Mushroom PD FTP
server. As people will know, before I moved to England I used to run
Mushroom PD with an FTP server so that the public could access the latest
AMOS warez quicker, as well as upload all their own projects for an
almost-immediate inclusion.

    Once again as before, the server is only active when I am online with
my Amiga. This is usually around 8 hours a day, from 8am till 5pm USA time
(UK time is 5 hours ahead) and the FTP site name is mushy-pd.dyn.ml.org

    When you log in to the server, you must send your password as your
email address. The server has been tested on most platforms and software,
and access can be granted from Netscape, IE, Ibrowse, AWEB, Voyager, AmFTP,
FTP2000 and a whole host of other FTP programs. When I get a third
phoneline in the start of September, the server will be hopefully online 24
hours a day.

SPACE INCREASE
--------------
    I have added a new 1Gb drive to the library in the past fortnight,
which has drastically increased the amount of space available from the
library. It used to be ran on an 80Mb partition of a 200Mb HD, and was
getting rather cramped. It is now installed and working, and so I have
downloaded and added all the pieces of PD I had URL's and Email address'
for, and most of it doesnt appear in the RECENT list, so you should have a
look around for it!!

HOMEPAGE CHANGES
----------------
    Over the weekend, I have been heavily working on the library and made
some substantial changes to both the PD witin it, and the Homepages on
www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk.

    The format of the library has now changed from its old'style, to that
of an Aminet-like directory system. This allows for easier finding of
programs, and makes them easier to categorize (so I hope). If you have
bookmarks to old MPD pages, they will still work, but I suggest that you
clear them out of your cache to let the new-look pages load in. The
new-look pages allow you to download the titles from my FTP site (if it is
online) rather than have them sent via email, but the form is still there
if you would rather they were sent by email.

    The improvements see the removal of 4 of the old pages, and the major
increase of information on the new pages. the layout has been completely
changed, which I think you'll find for the better. You can now read the
.Readme files of each of the archives online, which is also a great
improvement.

    One way to check if my PD library is online, there is an image on the
bottom of the main index page (index.html) which says "mushy-pd.dyn.ml.org
- online". If this image loads from the WWW and not the browsers cache,
then the library is online. Also, if you click on the image, you can go
straight into the FTP site.

RECENT LIST
-----------
    This is a complete Recent list of my library, from what was in the
INCOMING drawer. If you uploaded a project here and it isnt, check the
drawer it should have gone too, and if it isnt their either, try sending it
again.

    Copies of this list can be emailed from my WWW pages at 
http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/recent.htm.


| Complete Recent Mushroom PD Index on Thursday 03-Jul-97 00:51:27
| The list is sorted by directory and file name
|
| This site, mushy-pd.dyn.ml.org, contains all files uploaded to
| Mushroom PD within the last 7 days. Files which didnt have a .Readme in
| them were discarded. If your upload isnt here, please look in the
| appropriate section of the library, and if you still cant find it, try
| to upload it once more.
|
| To visit the Mushroom PD homepages to get the latest version of this
| file, go to http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/index.html and follow
| the approriate links.
|
| You can also FTP into the library directly at mushy-pd.dyn.ml.org
| logging on as anonymous, sending your email address as your password, and
| download the first INDEX file in the /pub/amos/ drawer.
|
| If you experience any problems, please email the webmaster at
| mushypd@redrose.net and the problem will be resolved as soon as
| possible. Thank-you.

All the programs I have made in the past, and a few have used EDIT in them,
seem to quit fine.

Make 2 test compiles, one dies with Edit, and the other, END or SYSTEM.
Make a note of your memory, then run each in turn, and see if your mem
comes back to you. You'll lose the odd few K anyhow as the AMOS lib is
loaded.

Now living in the US, im trying to gather info on how to sell the compiler

To the Amos mailing list.

Hello all!

I am looking for an Amos Pro extension that will allow me to use
two mice - one in each port - to enable me to write a two player
mouse oriented game.

Does anyone know where I can find such a thing? Also, how easy
would it be to incorporate into existing programs?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

Get out yer old copy of AMOS 1.3, and try loading it in with that. Dont
worry if you dont have the extensions, or if it isnt compatible, then
immediately resave it to another filename.

I often found that Classic AMOS could recover a corrupt AMOS file much
better than Pro.

Yes. Then we could do like the PSX channel and give out the codes after the
game has been released.

That's why I put up the credits file. What you see there is what I know.
Graphics have been going directly between artists and programmers, so I have
no idea who is doing what. Check the credits. If you've done something for the
game and you aren't on the credits, tell me.

If you can get the whole thing to ascii format, save it that way and them
import the ascii (merge ascii) again and the whole program will come back.

Easylife extension has commands to do that. I use them for collision

AMCAF does exactly that and it works great.

> Something along the lines of collision detection.

Apart from writing it in assembler, this should be the best you'll get:

With two rectanges (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) and (x3,y3) to (x4,y4), with
coordinates as top-left to bottom-right...

If x2>x3 and y2>y3 and x4>x1 and y4>y1 Then overlapping

I *think* that's right.

Hello!

Sorry never heard of it, but I'm sure someone will have an answer for you!

Can't help you there either, I'm sorry. I only have an assembler. However, I
am very interested that you can code extensions in C! Someone told me
assembler only but obviously they were wrong!

   Yes, it is right.

   It's also the fastest method I know of using pure AMOS.

   Alternately, you could check for misses instead of hits:
   OVERLAPPING=False
   If X4<X1 Then exit(Return/Pop Proc)
   if Y4<Y1 Then exit(Return/Pop Proc)
   If X3>X2 Then exit(Return/Pop Proc)
   If Y3>Y2 Then exit(Return/Pop Proc)
   OVERLAPPING=True
   exit(Return/End Proc)

   But, it's the same thing in the end...



      Take Care,

       Garfield

Greetings.

Giark asked regarding the List game:
> Adam Parrott - Dungeon stage has not
> materialized as of yet. Will it be happening?

Yes it will. Please recall that I just returned from vacationing, and 
yesterday I finally finished reading up on all of my mail and 
responding to some, and I'm trying to dip back into my programming 
and development etc. It will be coming, I assure you. Btw, I need 
some specs as to what you want to see in the level (gfx, motif)?

> Andrew Hawkins - Combat stage may be stalled,
> all we've seen is a couple stills. Demo soon?

What type of level are you developing Mr. Hawkins? Just curious. Is 
it still raycasted images and interactive characters like you did 
your upcoming game (sorry, forget the name at the moment) with the 
screenshots up on your pages, or is it 3D? The 3D engine, game, and 
level for the List game I'm developing is a raycasting engine like 
Wolfenstein. Wondered what type "3D" your level is.

Greetings.

Just wanted to say thank you for those that sent me the mail that I 
missed over the past week (actually, only one person, Magnus Sjoberg)

After I asked for help, I forgot that a digested version of all of 
the messages sent to the List for that month are .lzh'ed and sent to 
Aminet each month. Anyhow, thanks Magnus. I'm glad I didn't have to 
wait till the digest was posted (since June '97 isn't up yet).

Hi Everyone, well I'm working on a  palette editor, I've got all the basic
functions like copy, paste, swap and sliders, and the sliders will have three
different modes of operation RGB, CMY and HSV, now the first two I have
working, but HSV I'm totally baffled on, anybody have any ideas or code on how
I could go between HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) and say RGB)?

Ideally I want Hue to be a number between 0 and 360(degrees) 
and saturation and value to be between 0 - 100(percent), if your not sure how
this works take a look at a paint program like Brilliance or an Image
processing program like Adpro for an idea how they work.

By the way anybody interested in taking a look at it so far?
Its not in the finished state I want it, but it certainly works and looks
nice, but I got a whole bunch more ideas for it, which I will be implimenting
very soon.

Greetings.

Through the inspiration of Mush's mailing list, I have decided to 
start my own mailing list (the Parrottsoft mailing list). The mailing 
list will discuss issues concerning AMOS and projects underway at 
Parrottsoft and things to come.

Right now, it's one-way, which means I send postings every so often, 
every week or so, like Mush, and if you're subscribed, then you'll be 
sent the posting via e-mail. However, soon, I hope to get a 
Majordomo (automated) and two-way system setup so you can 
interact like the AMOS list. Anyhow, it's very similar to Mush's.

This is the first invite to those who wish to subscribe to it (I 
thought I would give everyone here on the List a first hand 
subscription to it before I make it to my homepages).

If you want to subscribe to it, just send mail to psml@hotmail.com 
with the words "SBUSCRIBE <your e-mail address>" in the subject or 
body of the message. You'll be notified upon arrival of your request 
and will be mailed further instructions. Please be aware that I will 
only be sending out updates every week or two, and this list is not 
interactive as of yet, even though it may be soon.

E-mail me if you have any questions.

For the 3d Fighter stage I`m using raycasted images rendered with
3dsmax, and ported to the Amiga. Unfortunately I have to convert
16million colours down to just 16 and the image looks a bit worse for
wear.
The characters are polygons using the illustrious Voodoo extension, and
I`m just finishing the 3d points tool to animate the characters.  It`s
all hacked down and simplified because I`m working full-time in Perth as
well.
I`ll have a demo soon, maybe tommorow afternoon, but could someone
please send me a picture of the main character so I can match it for
continuity.
How`s the raycasting going Adam? Are you doing a Crash Badicoot style
game?  Do you have a demo?
Also I have got SoloTrekII and I love it but when some little animation
plays in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, it crashes out with
a "BOB NOT DEFINED" error or something.  Anyone had this problem?
Thanks for listening
Andy H.(GSM)

Nope, it's Michael Cox, editor and publisher of AMOner, the AMOS disk mag. Thx
for keeping the List going Mike.

Nice to be able to contact the author, eh? After I had finished STII, the main
graphic file got munched. You can find a fix for it on aminet. If you can't,
let me know and I can mail the graphics to you directly.

I don't have any as of yet, however, before I went on vacation I told 
Giark (and the List I think) that I would do up some images of a 3D 
rendered Bubba in Lightwave (trace the outline of his body and then 
make a 3D model out of it, adding textures and things). I haven't got 
to it yet, but I plan to here in the next couple of days.

It's coming along good. No, the first game I make with the Cafe 
engine won't be a Crash Bandicoot type of game, (Eventuator is the 
first, kind of like the Terminator in three-dee). However, after 
seeing Mario 64 for the Nintendo64, I would love to do a Bandicoot 
type game after Eventuator (even though it might not be as good, on 
an Amiga, because of speed limitations and the such). The Nintendo64 
itself could WELL out-perform my P200 EASILY.

Sure, as long as they are compiled.  You'll need a startup check or
something, possibly to see if you have any parameters passed to the proggie.

if command line$=""
	'probably workbench
else
	'probably cli
end if

I think there are some extension commands which'll give you a definate
answer, but I can't remember them !

	Helo list humans!

	I have a problem here I really would like somebody to help me out , it is
quite important for me.
	I happen to have that amos 3d stuff , which I got a long time ago , it is
that voodoo 3d extension.
	I have been thinking about adding 3d stuff to my games and making a racing
game a la stunt car racer (that means the same playability) , but the
problem comes on modeling , the OM (object moduler) that comes with the
package is a pain to run on my machine and it totally sucks , like , it is
a pain to modele using this tool. I wanna know if anybody knows of any way
I could module without that , I mean , module on some other package and
then convert the object file , any help , please? Is that possible at all?

	Also , is there any other 3d extension available?

	Also , is everybody unsubscribing because of vacation? It is winter here
in Brazil but as you may guess it is hot anyway.

	On another subject , I can make gfx (3d) and a whole lot of stuff , I'm
getting  in contact with some programmers to help them out where needed
(gfx) and I wanna know if anybody needs some too , if that is the case ,
please contact me.

	Thanks and see ya everybody!

Ahh, a man after my own heart. I someday hope to do a rather fine
stunt-car-racer clone, with more in it than the original. I will do it one
day.

Use polygons. Much nicer to use.

nope, voodoo is the only one around that I know of.

Im working on a rather nice animated 3D intro for the list games. Should be
quite nice to see how I mess it up!

Good luck on this one.  There is no known object modeller that doesn't suck.
You can move the points about yourself, but this isn't my idea of fun.
There was talk about converting imagine objects to voodoo objects, but I
think this disapeared into smoke.

One or two of the other extensions have 3D commands, but nothing close to
full solid polygon objects with limited texture mapping.  At least not yet.

Greetings.

Well, it's come. There have been some change of addresses concerning 
my e-mail. Please take note and read below the changes:

Business and/or Parrottsoft related:
The old: parrottsoft@geocities.com
The new: parrottsoft@iname.com

Moi and/or personal related:
The old: parrotta@hotmail.com
The new: parrotta@iname.com

Parrottsoft mailing list:
The old: psml@hotmail.com
The new: parrottmail@iname.com

Please note that the last two (personal and psml addresses) still 
work and are functional, but I recommend using the iname.com 
addresses instead of any of the others to avoid confusion and to 
insure delivery of your messages.

iName is merely a redirection service (they're free and wonderful, 
check them out). All of my e-mail accounts are now on Homail.

Please also note that my Geocities e-mail account will be 
disappearing shortly as well, so PLEASE don't send ANY mail to it 
(just in case, so it won't bounce and I don't get it).

Please spread the word around about this change, and I'll be happy. 
I will also be putting word of this up on my site's pages.

Subject: A new extension
MIME-Version: 1.0

X-Status: 


Hello,

 I was thinking of writing a extension for AMOSPro but after I read some of
the source code for the Music Extension I tried to assemble it but a Huge
amount of errors came up from the "|Equ.s" file (I dont think that the
file is damaged though).

I tried to assemble this code on various assemblers:

Phxass  4.36
Phxass  3.xx
ASM-ONE 1.6
ASM-ONE (I cant remember the version of this one but it is the
         latest one on TFA's Homepage)
Barfly  1.31

All of the assemblers came up with the same errors in the "Iequ.s" file

Does anyone know how to solve this problem ?

What type of extension would you like to come out next ?

The AMCAF Extension provides a function to  find  out  the  cli  number  or
returns zero in case the program was started from workbench.

AMCAF has commands to add a second mouse via the joystick port.
You can find it on Aminet in dev/amos.

Really very easy.

Actually the C source code on Aminet is the C equivilant of the extension, not
the source code for the extension.

   I would like to see an extension that lets you load and display
a hires-laced ham screen (and ham-8 too if possible).
   I have Intos but never could make it work(it came as a coverdisk),
maybe i need to get the manual. I would pay for such an extension, but
then also, without the amospro compiler is worthless to me, is still not
sold in the US.

Subject: Making Windows
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

X-Status: 

Okay heres the problem:

I need a graphical window (eg a workbench type window), that I can modify
the contents and move around the new modified window, I need a solid moving
window, that is one that is solid as it moves, not an outline.

I've tried to make the window a bob, it can move around okay, but I can't
modify the contents, because when the bob moves, it just uses the original
image. The window is 110 x 139 pixels (Its a palette editor/requester).

Any ideas or code on how to do this?

Another thought on the same subject, is for example put a bob on screen,
modify the image(on screen) and move the new copy around, would it be possible
to do this? with no jerks or flicker?  Possibly using Double buffering, which
I must admit I still get confused about sometimes.

Anyways, any help would be appreciated

It's not "over" the exisiting one, and I'm not trying to *compete* 
with the AMOS list, I'm just creating my own list to inform people of 
the work I do and the latest information on that work and the Amiga

Giark, if you get this tonight or over the weekend, I just wanted to 
info you that I'm about the .zip up some Bubba graphics I just 
finished raytracing (I finally created and finished my Captain Bubba 
3D model. Yes!) Just tell me which shots (camera angle) you would 
like to see besides views from behind, in front, and the right side.

I would like a New 3D ext. better, then Amos3D more easier to use, with more

Hello all,

Berionne wanted to do dual mouse things, I checked out the Aminet for
the AMCAF ext but all I saw was the update. Is this the full extension
or do you have to buy it from somewhere then use the update.
As a free giveaway, you realise with have two mouse`s you can simulate
two arms in a 3d world environ for a sword fighting game or boxing or
whatever.  Anyone wanna make a game like this?  With the mouse keys
pressed down you could move the legs.  Even a BattleMech could be
simulated this way. 
I have some ideas for the following copies and would like to get a vote
on each of them for ideas for new games for the Amiga
-  Interstate76/Mad Max 3d car combat
-  Star Trek overhaul to 3d/ like old Sega arcade game or even Voyager
-  MechWarrior Amiga
Any takers, please send your votes or ideas to geosync@ozemail.com.au
Seeya, Andy H. GSM

My mailing list is totally different than the official list. My list just
distributes info on new software uploaded to the library, and info on new
extensions, lists etc. Hell, I even had one guy from the AMOS list complain
about it being spam, and im doing all AMOS users a favour by holding all
this PD.

Keep your list going, but be carefull on how you run it as you could cause
some wars between the different lists. For example, try to make it more
specific to your Parrotsoft group, rather than AMOS list related, if you
get my picture.

> What type of extension would you like to come out next ?

There are several functions in an extension I would like to see. I would
like to see a much better version of the 3D extension. I have never used a
copy of it, only seen compiled demo versions, and heard stories it wasnt
very good, so never got a hold of it.

I would also like to see an extension which will open AMOS screens for
different types of screenmode, as I was about to sell one of my progs, and
had to cancel as the guy had a multisync which wouldnt go down low enuff =(

An extension which offered fast texturemapping and 3D raycaster rotation
type calculations would be nice, but I suppose we could only wish for all
this.

Mike did about 8 or 9 issues of AMOner, the last one ending about about 2-3
years ago.  It was a cool little mag with a few games, some chat, some raw
code, tutors, not to the extent that "AMOSzine" or "Nothing But AMOS" went, but
more like "Totally AMOS".  His co-editor was a guy in Isreal, can't recall his
name.  I'm sure it's PD by now, but I don't know where to get it.

Hey Mike why don't you post a note and tell us about your AMOner days ...when
AMOS (and the Amiga) ruled!

-Chris.

That's the idea. The game will have just one big map, no seperate

I know what you're thinking: Hey, Giark! We're all plugging away at our bits
and pieces. Where's the overall coordinating code that you promised?

Well, my novel is almost completed, so I will soon have more time for coding.

The page is being updated all the time. I added a mailto feature so you can
send mail directly from the page to my address. You'll notice a few other
changes as well. I've done a bit of housecleaning of the files offered.

We need to come to a consensus on the final look of CB.

His suit is blue. His hair is orange. His gloves and boots are red. He's a
slightly overweight dude. If possible, can all the graphicians get your Bubba
in this colour scheme? So far, Bubba for the first two stages looks good
(color coordination aside).

EJ, can you put samples to your tunes. Both of them are very good. I'll be
working on the overall code next week or whenever I finish the novel,
whichever comes first.

Well met and godspeed,
                      Giark

I'm trying to write a game along the lines of Civilization, SimCity,
et al. I'm using hexagonal map tiles (just to be different :)) and
I've got the display routines working nicely. Unfortunately, I'm
having some trouble coming up with a routine that will design the
map randomly so that it doesn`t look artificial, but is also not
just random snow (those extremes have proved to be very easy to do!).
The other trouble is generating the map at a reasonable speed. I
want a map that is bigger than civilisation, but I don't really
want to wait all afternoon for it to render! :)

All and any advice is appreciated.

At the same time, I've drawn all my map tiles, but I have to say
that I'm not really very happy with my best efforts. If there's
anyone out there who'd be interested in drawing some graphics,
feel free to mail me, and I'll mail you back what I've done so
far, so you can get an idea.

Later on, I'd probably need someone to do the sounds/music too,
if I'm going to have any, as my musical talents are even more
non-existant than my graphics!

For now though, thank you all!

My answer: Please please please - new screen modes! Not just AGA, but
any supported by the OS, including Cybergraphix and Picasso, and any
others that would maybe be released in the future?
That would include higher numbers of colours as well. In fact, this
is maybe more important that higher resolution.

Nope, it's Michael Cox, editor and publisher of AMOner, the AMOS disk mag. Thx
for keeping the List going Mike.

Well, I'll be damned.  I would've never guessed.
So, Chris, you do any AMOS programming?

Hi. I've recently had a serious problem with AMOS Pro, and was hoping
that someone out there would know how to help me...

When compiling a certain program, AMOS crashes with a 8000 0004 software
failure. I'm using an Amiga 4000/040 with 2 meg chip and 4 meg fast.
The source code for this program is ~200kb long and doesn't have any
graphics banks. It runs correctly under the interpreter, so I'm pretty
sure that it isn't the program per se which is causing the problem.
Every other program I've tried still seems to compile correctly.

I've thought that this might be a memory problem- the RPG I'm coding
is the largest source I've ever written in AMOS, and uses a 2 meg variable
buffer- but wouldn't the program just print a warning if this were the
case? I've also considered that my compiler, which was bought second
hand, might be corrupted somehow. This seems unlikely, though, since
as I've said every other program compiles correctly, and this program
used to compile correctly until just a short while ago.

If anyone out there has any idea what might be wrong, I'd appreciate
hearing about it.

Are you referring to the list game or are you offering to anyone with a request?

Another thought on the same subject, is for example put a bob on screen,
modify the image(on screen) and move the new copy around, would it be possible
to do this? with no jerks or flicker?  Possibly using Double buffering, which
I must admit I still get confused about sometimes.

Anyways, any help would be appreciated

Open a Screen and Hide it.
Paste your Bob on it.
Alter/Modify the Bob.
Get Bob hidden_screen,x1,y1 to x2,y2.
Now you can use the your new modified Bob on the viewable screen.
Hope this idea helps, Ken

Hello all,

I`m still having problems with my Star Fighter fonts.  They should find
only my FONTS: set up using these commands.

cd$=dir$
EXEC["sys:c/assign Star_Fighter_Boot: "+cd$]
EXEC["sys:c/assign Fonts: Star_Fighter_Boot:fonts"]  

Get Disc Fonts
Set Font 1
Set Font 2
Set Font 3
Get Rom Fonts
For P=1 To 10
   If Font$(P)<>""
      If Upper$(Mid$(Font$(P),1,9))="HELVETICA"
        If Val(Mid$(Font$(P),30,32))=18
            _ONE=P
         End If 
         If Val(Mid$(Font$(P),30,32))=11
            _THRE=P
         End If 
         If Val(Mid$(Font$(P),30,32))=9
            _TWO=P
         End If 
      End If 
   End If 
Next P

Yet people still get problems. Can anyone give me some code that always
loads my fonts and not the system fonts.

Hi Every 1

There is a 60 year young NEWBIE sitting at this end, so please bear
with me for a moment.
I've have a cover disk version of AMOS Pro. V1.12 and I can get the
V 2.0 compiler but it won't upgrade my present version.
Does anybody know where I can get a later version of AMOS Pro that
will upgrade ?
Have tried, by snail mail, to get replies from sources listed in
~Ultimate Amos " but no luck.   Europress don't want to know so I'm
stuck.
Willing to purchase a second user version, BUT please no pirated
ones,with manual if possible.

I live in London in the U.K. but I can't seem to find the Home Page or
e-mail address of AMOSClub UK anybody help??

Why the long delay in asking ? Well I've only just got a modem so
finding anybody else was difficult. It wasn't until I ran a search
that I found out AMOS was alive and kicking.

My wife and I are both disabled after a Hit&Run accident and so the
'miggy is our easiest way to 'talk~ to PPL.(If you want to send a
private reply it would be most welcome)

If you can help Please let me know . I'm desperate ;-((

Thank U for your time in *reading* this, is that the right word ?

Cheers

Dave aka Ancient1

Try easylife or amcaf.  Both have font commands.  Alternatively, scan the
font list for the font name, if you must do it that way.  Also, the fonts
will not necessarily be in the right order when you bung them on disk.

First I want to make the actual tunes without having to worry about any
samples. Don't worry, I will put them all in PT format when I've finished
all of them. You can run THX and PT simultaneously so anyone can do it
basically. But I want to concentrate on the actual tunes first (that and
the fact that I don't have that many samples to begin with).

Oh, and thanks. :)

A couple of small problems concerning an AMOS program I am writing:

1.	Why does AMOS generate so many enforcer hits? It just seems to
generate the same problem repeatedly. Is there any way of stopping this?

2.	An Amiga Shopper coverdisk gave away an extension called Ldos a few
years back. Does anybody have any documentation for this?

I am writing a Hex Editor for editing any binary or other files. Are
there any features anybody would like to be added to this? Would anybody
like a copy of a beta-test version?

With this editor I have incorporated the feature to allow identification
of various features using a simple Lisp expression. ( eg (= x 13) would
identify all those annoying CRs that MSDOS ascii save. To achieve some
speed with this, I have written a compiler which compiles the code into
memory and then executes it. However, this causes the computer to crash
if the CPU caches are enabled, does anybody have any suggestions as to
how to deal with this?

Any answers to these would be gratefully recieved,

Thanks

Here is some rather kludged up code which takes values for h between 0
and 95 and s and v between 0 and 15

[p.s. I had to re-type these in, so don't expect perfection.]

[p.p.s I also have routines for YUV, colourwheel selectors, and those
three funny square type things that you used to get on photon paint -
which work rather well actually]

procedure setcol_hsv[cl,h,s,v]
if h >=0 and h<= 15: rem red to yellow
  r=15: g=h b=0
else if h>=16 and h<=31 : rem yellow to green
  g=15 : b=0 : r=31-h
else if h>=32 and h<=47 : rem green to cyan
  g=15 : b=h-32 : r=0
else if h>=48 and h<=63 : rem cyan to blue
  b=15 : g=63-h : r=0
else if h>=64 and h<=79 : rem blue to magenta
  b=15 : r=h-64 : g=0
else if h>=80 and h<=95 : rem magenta to red
  r=15 : b=95-h :g=0
endif

r=15-(((15-r)*s)/15)
g=15-(((15-g)*s)/15)
b=15-(((15-b)*s)/15)

r=(r*v)/15
g=(g*v)/15
b=(b*v)/15
endproc

[p.p.p.s see next e-mail for the other routine]

Ok. Well, it sounds rather odd, and I don' think I'll be able to pinpoint
any problem without a *lot* more details, but here's how I'd try to find
out where it was happening:

I'd open a new program window, and cut-and-paste each procedure from the
crashing program into it, and try compiling each procedure seperately from
there. One of two things might happen:

Either you'll find the procedure that's causing problems, which will allow
you to narrow down your search, or else everything will compile, magically
without crashing. If this happens, then there's possibly a corruption of
some sort in your program source file - so cut-n-paste everything from the
first program to the new one. This will copy all the program lines (which
you would already know work ok) into a fresh program - hopefully without
copying the corruption. Try compiling that.

Hope that's helpful!

The power ups are far too far apart. I played and got 1 kill all, 1 shield
power and 2 weapon power ups the whole stage! This is making it a bit
difficult to complete the stage, wot?
 
Well met and godspeed,

I did an educational game for the local schls s called "Night Math Attack" on

Now I've mostly switched to PC coding (hork).

Subject:	GFX for the C&C listgame?

If there still is any need for GFX for the C&C listgame maybe I can
contribute with some stuff? I prefer to work with bitmapp-gfx but I also
have some knowledge in 3D gfx. I would like to work with gfx for a
Warcraft/C&C, RPG or EOB type of game. So if someone need a helping hand,
just send me a mail!

Thanks

Martin Karlsson - bobba@mailbox.hogia.net

Martin,  If it's no trouble, I could always use some
gfx like Lure of the Temptress, Future Wars, Kings Quest,
Monkey Island, etc. My format is a 32 color picture, using
the first 22 colors only, and using the whole screen.
I really need forest, jungle, and beach/lagoon/lake type screens.
Thanks, Ken.

After looking at a few demos on the list-game web site, I can 
say its coming on quite nicely. Loved Garfields shoot'em up, but
agree with Mr. Giarks comments on power-ups.

I`ve been waiting for any requests for gfx but I have not received
any. Is this because all the jobs have been taken ? Do Garfield or
Keith want any gfx for their shoot em ups ?

Just ask.

Regards

Hang on, blue suit, red boots, a big 'B' on his chest...  does this sound
familiar boys and girls ?  With the white suit ray-traced vsn, Bubba gets 
a modern, different look.  I'd have to see the other colour scheme first.

Depends on how it all looks when compressed to run on 32 colours
with all the other stuff going on really...  Bold is good though.

Greetings.

Well, hopefully for the last time, I have some new e-mail addresses. 
I was with iName for all of my forwarding services, and they appeared 
to be going well, but today I tried to send some mail and they're 
server got all fussy, so I'm switching the Netaddress (@usa.net). I 
had looked at them before, but didn't think much of them before. Now, 
however, I've gone back to them, and I've made the switch (they offer 
everything iName did AND MORE). So, note the new e-mail addresses:

Parrottsoft's e-mail address:
The old: parrottsoft@iname.com
The new: parrottsoft@usa.net

Moi personal e-mail address:
The old: parrotta@iname.com
The new: parrotta@usa.net

Parrottsoft mailling list:
The old: parrottmail@iname.com
The new: parrottmail@usa.net

Note that you can send all mail to either usa.net or hotmail.com for 
ALL of the above new addresses. usa.net is merely a forwarding 
service just like iName. As far as my old e-mail addresses go, FORGET 
iName. Delete all of my old iName addresses.

Also, my Geocities e-mail account is still active. DON'T start 
sending or get the idea of sending *ANY* mail to my Geocities account 
just because it's still active. The ONLY two reasones I've left it on 
is just in case I have trouble with my present e-mail accounts, I'll 
have a back-up e-mail address. The other reason is that I couldn't 
get the AMOS List's server (amos-request@access.digex.net) to 
subscribe me to my ex-new Parrottsoft e-mail address 
(parrottsoft@iname.com). I'm going to go back and try it again with 
my new address (@usa.net) and see if it will work now. If it does, I 
will be deactivating my Geocities e-mail address. Now you see why I 
don't want you sending any mail to it unless I say so.

*phew*. Sorry about the length of the message. Just wanted to inform 
everyone of the change (again, hopefully for the last time. I'm 
pretty sure it will be this time. I never felt very comfortable with 
iName). Hope I haven't confused anyone. Thanks again.

Not exactly. Wasn't sure what to put on him. There were a couple of
different style jetpacks I could have made. I like it anyhow.

Just check out the page. I think Giark has put it up. (If he hasn't,
wait for him to or just e-mail me and I'll mail you the .zip).

hehe. I like that one. Bubba isn't a color-coordinated dude. :)

Well, for those who don't know (this should be a plus for the 
graphicians and level designers), ALL pictures included are in both
.jpeg AND .iff form. There are 4 shots of Bubba in 16.7million color
.jpeg's AND I scaled those shots down to 16 color .iff's. Now EVERYONE
should be happy. hehe.

The best solution is AMCAF extension: it has a set of font commands: you can
loadthem directly from disk or storing them in banks and save the banks with
your code.

   I think people will be surprised when they see the quality of
   this first AMOS-List game. I know I haven't been here long, so I 
   appreciate you all letting me "get in" on this... it's really a GREAT
   project to be involved in!!

   Looking forward to seeing demos of the Tekken, Doom and Bonus
   stages!!! (THAT WAS A HINT!!!! real subtle, eh?)
 

> Loved Garfields shoot'em up, but

   It is progressing, but it's not quite where I want it yet...
   Anyway, glad you guys liked it!! :-)

   Personally, I am eagerly awaiting the next version of Keith's
   3D-shooter!! Sounds like we'll all have nightmares after playing
   that one...  


>agree with Mr. Giarks comments on power-ups.

   Some of the fun is in discovering which enemies are carrying the
   powerups. Actually, there are already:

   5 "FirePower" increases
   4 "Shields" increases
   2 "Missiles" weapon changers
   2 "Plasma" weapon changers
   3 "Destructors"


   I do appreciate the feedback. If you still think it needs more
   powerups, I will throw some more in.

   I am also considering adding a few more powerup-types... which
   means I'll need a few more speech samples...

   BTW- the samples I sent to Mr. G, the credit goes to my brother,
   Robert, for without his sampler they would not exist!!

  
>I`ve been waiting for any requests for gfx but I have not received
>any. Is this because all the jobs have been taken ? Do Garfield or
>Keith want any gfx for their shoot em ups ?

   I have received some excellent rotating asteroids, for Phase
   Three (Asteroid Field), from Andrew Hawkins and I have started on
   the Mid-Boss gfx (Phase Two), but I could definitely use a nice
   HAND-DRAWN Super Boss for the Final Boss Battle.

   I'd like this creature to be around 96hx96v in size. This is just in
   terms of blitter-object size (speed reasons), so it can be anything
   in this range: 192hx48v, 48hx192v, 128hx72v, 72hx128v, etc.

   I have no idea for the actual Final Boss design at this time. If you
   want to take a shot at it then certainly feel free to!!!

   I'd like it to be in the standard multi-weak-spot tradition, where
   you have to blow-up one part then another and finally a third 
   and the beast falls...

   Boss Weapons:Lightning, homing missiles, small aliens, etc.
   Whatever you come up with are no problem as far as coding is
   concerned... so, BE CREATIVE!!!

   Try to keep the colours down, as ultimately I will be remapping to
   a very tiny palette.



      Take care,

       Garfield

   Well, you are rusty. Need to spend less time in non-computer
   activities and more time playing shoot-em-ups... 

   HA! Seriously, I appreciate the feedback!! There are actually
   many more power-ups already in... just need to find them.

   If after giving it another go, you still think it needs more, then
   I'll gladly add them. Just want to keep it balanced, which is
   difficult.. you know, not too easy, not too hard, but just a bit
   of a stretch all the way to the end.

 
   BTW- GREAT idea in putting up a Beta Testers section on the web-
   page.  Now, you just need to recruit some people for it!!


   TO ALL: We NEED beta-testers!!

   Download the demos, play them to the hilt, write down all the
   things you hate and let us programmers know. We all want our
   parts to be the best they can possibly be BUT... WE NEED YOUR 
   HELP!!!!



         Take care,

Yup..!  Can never have enough graphics.  (and this goes to any graphics guys
paying attention too..)  I would prefer a set of graphics in the same style,
so each graphics guy takes a level..  At the moment, feel free to design
sets of gfx, anything space harrier style is good, any ideas you have will
be greatly appreciated.  I did think of having different terrain types for
level basis..  jungle, city, artic.. you get the idea, but not sure how
that'd work.  

I'd actually REALLY <hint> like to see a many shades of white artic level..   
Lets blow the smeg out of penguins, igloos and polar bears !  Icebergs, ice
flows, enemy stealth aircraft (so white they almost match the background),
ICE dragon....   Maybe Bubba will get to wear that white suit again...

> Just ask.

Anything you can output can be put into the game.  Well, almost anything ! 
I need the graphics at 'closest to the player' size, preferably looking
forwards unless animated, or it looks wierd when flown.  If doing cartoon
style, keep the same palette throughout...  If doing ray-traced renderings :)
full colour please !  Then the whole lot can get crunched colour wise at the
same time.

Most usefull gfx missing at this point in time, explosions (the more the
merrier), rocks (well, can't have a game without lumps of rock somewhere),
weapon effects - enemy and Bubba (err, take your pick), enemy fighter
aircraft - front, back, rotating.  Think of the game design, and the best
way your gfx should appear.



PS: Anyone out there care to donate some copper effects to the listgame ??
   Set Rainbow 1,0,310,"","(12,0,15)(9,1,15)","(12,-1,15)(9,0,15)"
for size reference.  Top half sky-like, bottom half ground like.  Yes, the
copper is bigger than the screen.

   Well, you are rusty. Need to spend less time in non-computer
   activities and more time playing shoot-em-ups... 

   HA! Seriously, I appreciate the feedback!! There are actually
   many more power-ups already in... just need to find them.

   If after giving it another go, you still think it needs more, then
   I'll gladly add them. Just want to keep it balanced, which is
   difficult.. you know, not too easy, not too hard, but just a bit
   of a stretch all the way to the end.

 
   BTW- GREAT idea in putting up a Beta Testers section on the web-
   page.  Now, you just need to recruit some people for it!!


   TO ALL: We NEED beta-testers!!

   Download the demos, play them to the hilt, write down all the
   things you hate and let us programmers know. We all want our
   parts to be the best they can possibly be BUT... WE NEED YOUR 
   HELP!!!!



         Take care,

          Garfield

Subject: Bob problems
MIME-Version: 1.0

I'm having some problems with some bobs that I hope someone could help me
with, heres the problem:

I'm making a palette-editor, and the three rgb sliders are three 7x7 bobs
anyways, at the end of the sliders I print the RGB values, now as the bob
moves to the end of the slider the bob's transparent part(which is 9 pixels
wide) covers up the numbers and I can't udpate them anymore 

Because Bobs have to be a minimum of 16 pixels wide, and when it redraws the
bob it redraws the old transparent part.

I don't want to use sprites because of the palette limitations.

any ideas on how I could fix this?

ha ha. Isn't he a scream? :)

Anyhow, I'm well assured that usa.net will do a better job with my 
e-mail this time. And, as I said, if you ever think that your mail 
isn't getting through, or it bounces, just send it to the addresses I 
gave you, only to hotmail.com, not usa.net (as I said they forward 
it). And of course, as a last resort, there's always Geocities.

      TO ALL:


      I have started receiving feed-back on the SideShooter.

      I realize that you all want it to be running at 50/60fps so it is
      not blurry/jumpy.

      So do I.  

      Once the stage is fully-working I will concentrate on these
      technical issues. The coding is no trouble, what I need is feed-
      back on the actual game-play aspects...


      To help clarify what I need, I have prepared the following
      questionaire. After you download the demo and play it through
      a few times, please take the time to answer the following
      questions and e-mail it back to me at gbenjam@ix.netcom.com


------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      Beta Test of SideShooter Stage
    (Just x the little box next to your answer like so: [x] or [X])



     I. Responsiveness of Controls

        []  Does it feel too sluggish?
        []  Does it feel too responsive?

   II.  Player Movement Speed

        []  Does Bubba move move too slow?
        []  Does Bubba move too fast?
        Comments:

     
  III. Enemies Movement Speeds  

        []  Do the enemies move too slow?
        []  Do the enemies move too fast?
        Comments:


  IV. Enemies Firing Delay

        []  Do the enemies fire too rarely?
        []  Do the enemies fire too often?
        Comments:


   V. Enemies Shot-Speeds

        []  Do the enemies' shots move too slow?
        []  Do the enemies' shots move too fast?
        Comments:

  
  VI. Besides joystick control, which of the following would you
      MOST like to see as an optional control-method?

      []  Keyboard
      []  Mouse



    *****   PLEASE ANSWER THE FOLLOWING, IF NOTHING ELSE!!!!   *****

  VII. What CPU does your Amiga have?

      []  68000 (in stock A1000/A500/600)
      []  68010
      []  68020 (in stock A1200 and perhaps A2000?)
      []  68030 (in stock A4000 and perhaps A3000?)

HELP!!!

I have recently discovered that when playing a MED module then attempting
to use the Frame Load command the Med module just stops
playing!!!! the machine doesnt crash and AMOS doesnt detect a problem?

Is there any other way of getting around this problem, I do not want to use
the Anim play command (or whatever it is) as its crucial that I 
can keep x number of anims in memory and play them at will.

Hi everybody.

First a warning, I'm new to the list, sorry for my incompleate english but I'm
from Denmark... (And 23 years old, just if you'd like to know...)

I'm generaly working on serious programs, among my work so far is a couple of
databases, one for Video-tapes one for music-collections, they are currently
NOT on the net, but the next versions will be posted to Aminet, If/When I get
them running...

I've also got plans for a tycoon-style game, but lack some time at this
moment, might be a winter-project, you know....
(If you got any ideas for souch a game, then let me know...)

-------
Now I'm seeking advice on a little problem I have...
 - PRINTER DUMP command crashes when used with all the parameters, I need a   
  
   dump that don't send FF and one that is capable of a scaling by my choice.
   Anybody got any Ideas or Code ???
 (I've come around it by copying my screen to a public screen, then dumped
that using GraphicDump with Exec, not cool at all)

-- 
Yours..

   Okay, will add some more power-ups. Actually, it's all very early
   and I still need to do the actual game-play tweaking phase.

   
>And is CB currently invincible?

   Yes, the good Captain is currently invincible.

   Well, like I said, it is all early, you know - a work in progress.

   I have an idea for the shield power indicator which will not
   require any space on the status-panel.

   Basically, Bubba's shield will start pulsing, fizzle, etc, the weaker
   it becomes.


>The power up problem could be got around by making the first

   Okay. This is definitely on my agenda. I need to go through the
   entire stage and create the progressive difficulty.

   The current demo is really just an example of the enemies,
   firing and basic game-engine.

   I certainly don't consider it worthy of inclusion in the AMOS-List
   project at this point!!


   However, I'm working as fast as I can!! Have spent twenty days
   on the Side-Shooter project: drawing, mapping, designing, 
   sampling, coding and the EMD-tool...

   There is a solid foundation now, so the next demo should be very
   nice!!


>Well, we should actually have something playable soon, as all the

>HINT!)

   I hope so as I am really looking forward to checking out these
   other stages. When all stage-demos are up on the web-page,
   the entire project will become much more solidified.



         Take care,

           Garfield

Tried again. Still not enough. And is CB currently invincible? Maybe a shield
power indicator somewhere. The power up problem could be got around by making
the first few waves of aliens not take so many shots to kill.

Well, we should actually have something playable soon, as all the programmers
will be sending in demos real soon now (ANOTHER HINT!)

Im currently writing a demo maker, it allows multi med modules to be loaded
and played at will, animation file support (currently holds upto 21
in memory) various screen effects.

All this is performed by a point and click your way approach, selecting
different commands (events) and supplying the relevant information,
e.g. a filename or which MED module (in memory) should be played.

It currently has a windows95-ish interface (sorry die hards) and should be
about ready for beta by the end of August.

What do you think? Feedback or questions gladly accepted

Hello,
      I've tryed everything to recover my old Bubble level for the 
listgame but to no avail.
I still want to have something of mine in the listgame so I am uploading 
a demo of a Pang style game to Giark.
I submit this to be used as the bonus level in replacement of the
Bubble bobble one.

When it is finished poping the smallest bubbles will reveal a bonus.
Suggestions on what bonus's I should use?

I'd like to beta test the list game please!
I don't have the URL of the page so can some one (Mr Giark is it?) either 
give me it or tell me where I can get a beta test version.

Thanks,

hehe. Well, I've sensed some pretty subtle hints (and some not so 
subtle) from you guys (namely Giark and Garfield) lately, so I 
decided to go ahead and give you guys an update on my engine and Doom 
level (remember my engine isn't quite finished yet, and it has to be 
for me to do my level!).

I've been busy converting and studying over pages of code from my 3D 
engine book. I assure you that my engine WILL be finished by the 
engine of the century (which in the computer world means soon). No 
really, I hope to have my engine finished and a demo ready by the end 
of the month (this thing is gonna be full-blown), and may be the 
largest level (chunk of code) in the entire game, so brace yourself 
Giark. It will happen soon enough (the level).

Btw, who else doesn't have their demos ready yet? (Not a hint, just 
wondering, as I forget right off who's doing what. I rembember Keith 
and Garfield are doing 2 of the levels, and James is doing the secret 
one, and Andy the Tekken stage.) I know Garfield's got some demos up, 
what about Keith and some of the others?

   Tell him you are interested in signing on as a Beta-tester 
   (or whatever else you want to contribute) and would like to
   receive the URL for the List-Game.

   He will then process your request, updating the web-page
   accordingly, and sending the private URL directly to you.


   This whole AMOS-LIST GAME#1 is still early in the development
   stages (about six weeks) and we need a secured site where the
   project can mature and develop without the worry of
   "outsiders" nicking the gfx/music/sounds or the worse case 
   scenario of the early demos being spread around.

   Once the entire project has been completed, Mr. Giark (I assume)
   will then unleash it worldwide: Aminet, mags/cover-CDs, etc.



      Take care,

       Garfield

Here is what I think about the list-game so far:


The Sideways Shooting Scroller:
-------------------------------

A Problem: It wont run after I load my HD (I have to load it from DOS to play)
           Im still trying to find out why

Except that I think its fantastic.




Good things that are in it:

Nice sfx and gfx
Good playability
Loads of Power-ups
Smooth Scrolling


Things that it needs:

Music playing during the game
A end-of-level enemy



The Castle Assault Stage:
-------------------------


I think its really good


Good things that are in it:

Nice scrolling effect
Good gfx
Good playability


Things that it needs:

A limited number of bullets (then you can get more bullets from power-ups).
  The way it is now you can just hold down the mouse button and you'll never
get hit

Power-ups
More soundfx


The Music Tunes:
----------------

I havent listened to them all yet but I like the ones Ive heard


The Graphics:
------------

The graphics I've seen are good.(Please see my other mail "Beta testing" for
why I
                                 havent seen it all)

I have been working on a EOB type of game for a couple of years. My main
problem is to handle the levels. Im no expert coder, so if someone could
give me some advices I would be more than happy!

The problem is to handle large levels! Now Im using "Data 1,0,1,1.....". I
use 17x17 size standard levels. 0 is for floor, 1 for wall, 3 for open door
and so on. If I try with larger levels (25x25) I run out of memory. I took
a look at the game "Black Dawn II" and it seems to me like the coder, A.
Campell I think!?,use ASCII text for the levels. Do anyone know how you
could create a smart level handler??? (Bad english? I know!!!)

Thanks

Giark,

 The last time I went to the games URL I went to the Beta testers list but
 my name wasnt there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Some of the graphics is in ZIP format.How do I 'Unzip" the file on my AMIGA ?
If there is no way to Unzip the file could you Unzip it and then LHA it and
put it up on the games page ?


How come there is only 2 levels on the games page ?

Is there a list of level no's for each game ? (Eg. What level is the Shooting
Scroller
                                               going to be?)

Okay, I've fixed the first
problem with the bob interfering
with the drawing operations under the transparent part of the bob,

now, could someone explain to me, why when the the mask(transparent) is on the
right side of the bob, that graphics get screwed up on the right of the bob,
even know the bob never goes in this area?

Is this a bug, or something I didn't know about bobs.

Any help would be appreciated.
By the way, if anybody wants to take a look at the program(about 30k) I'd be
glad to mail it to them

This is because the demo was packed using zip on a crappy PeeCee. The
way to make it executable is to click on 'Icons/Information` from
workbench and check the box named 'executeable`. Then save it.

Anyways, it worked for me. At looking on it, it does need a bit more
work.

     Greetings,
     
        I am new to the list and must admit that I have not touched Amos in 
     over a year.  I do have a couple of years of Amos programming under my 
     belt so I am no novice (having said that I am no expert either).  
     Reading the mails on the list have kinda inspired me to resurrect the 
     game I was coding up to last year.  
     
        I have reinstalled Amos Pro onto my Amiga and loaded up the code.  
     To be honest I was a bit stumped when I went through it.  It's like I 
     am starting to learn Amos all over again.  Like I said, I do a bit of 
     coding and a bit of music also, graphics are my weak point.  I will 
     put a demo of my game on my web page as soon as I get it together.
     
        Up to now I did not have any other Amos contacts and I reckon that 
     was half of the reason I gave up on it.  Anyway, it's good to be a 
     part of the list and I hope to be able to contribute something soon.  
     Later.....

You could indeed use layered ascii files for your data, which may be quite
straight forward.  How much memory does your machine have, and, are you
aware of the Set Buffer command ?  I wrote something similar a few years
back, I might be able to dig up the source if I'm lucky.  You'll need at
least two layers for your map, or you'll run out of chipmem.

Can you send me more details on what help you need please.

Most bigger viewers does. My personal favourite is CPIC32.

I have spent almost 1 year writing what could almost be called a "Point and
Click"
programming language.  

it allows the user to select an available command (event) and fill the
appropriate parameters, this command will then be executed at the
appropriate time (1/50 or 1/60 second) 

So far "Event Player" can store upto 4 MED modules, 21 Anim files and 7
screens in
memory and all of which can be manipulated!!!

Ever wanted to sample sounds at a higher sample rate and play an enormous
MED
module without worring about how much Chip memory is available?

Well... worry no more, by breaking up your music into several MED modules
this
software will load and play on request, playing module after module after
module
seamlessly (Remember those 13minute music demos)

Screen fading, melting, bouncing and colour cycling is all supported!!!

Feedback on this would be appreciated, this will be available xmas 97!! and
I would like
to know upfront how people are interested in developing demos without
writing any code.

..well, not never..  Just not very often.  Actually, a solid idea.  Consider
it in the next version (or there abouts)  I was wondering what to do with 
powerups.

..yeah.  Well, actually any sound effects would be good.  Got some underway,
but anyone care to donate some more samples ?

Or to go to the directory it's unpacked in and do protect pang.exe +e

Anyway, it doesn't work on my machine. I get the orange screen and then it
dumps me back to WB?!

Is there a credits-system for the CB game? Just wanted to know in case I
need to make a small 'continue?' tune.

   Hmmm... this is very strange! What exactly happens after you
   double-click on the executable?

   Do you have SnoopDOS or DOStrace?
   These two excellent utilities provide valuable info on what's
   going on behind the scenes and I find them very useful in sorting
   out exactly why a program won't work.

   If you do not have either, I will gladly send you the DOStrace
   in an Lha-archive (6k before encoding), if you want?

   THANKS!! It's great to know that someone appreciates your work!!

>Things that it needs:
>Music playing during the game
   Well, I haven't given this any thought at all. Perhaps after the
   stage is fully complete (I don't even have the first of the four
   phases done yet), I will add a background tune.
 
>An end-of-level enemy
   This is definitely in the works. The SideShooter stage actually
   consists of four phases:
   Phase One - Standard Shooter
               The current demo is Phase One.
   Phase Two - Mid-Boss Battle 
               This will be the first boss. It won't be huge or super-
               powerful, but it should give the player a good challenge.
   Phase Three - Asteroid Field 
                 Bubba must maneuver and blast his way through a dense
                 asteroid field.
   Phase Four - Final Boss Battle 
                The one you're waiting for!! This boss will be something
                special. Not sure myself exactly what, but I know I want
                it to be big, powerful, and semi-intelligent to the extent
                of reacting to Bubba's moving/firing.   

   I will get back to work on the SideShooter today. Giark will kill
   since I've only worked on it one day this past week!!

>The Castle Assault Stage:
>---------------------------
>I think its really good
   Me too!! For the size and quantity of the images, I think it is
   very fast and I particularly like those dragons flying by!!

>The Music Tunes:
>------------------
>I havent listened to them all yet but I like the ones Ive heard
   I've listened to the meds and mod. I think that MOD is excellent
   for the intro/credits!!
   The MEDS were very good as well. The one with wolves howling
   reminded me of Castlevania. Hmmm... maybe we should have had
   a Castlevania or GhoulsN'Ghosts style stage too. I suppose the
   memory is already maxxed with the current stages in this List-
   game, so maybe a good idea for the next one...

>The Graphics:

>The graphics I've seen are good.
   I agree!! I am particularly impressed with Adam's huge bubba with
   the green ray-gun!!
   ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT!!


         Take care,

Faster ? I found it quite fast already (this might have been caused by
my BlizZard though)

Is the faster version up on the web page yet?

The Pang Bouns Stage:
---------------------


*************************************************************************************
HOW TO GET IT TO WORK: So many people couldnt get it to work so here
                       is how I did it

                       First Unzip it
                       Then change the 'Information' settings by putting a
                            tick in the executable box
                       Then copy all of the .gfx files to "hd0:"
                       run the file "pang.exe"
**************************************************************************************

First I'd like to ask about the gfx (Ronnio) Are the gfx are copyrighted
by europress already ?


Good things in it already:

The Main Idea of it is good
The fonts at the start are nice


Things needed to be added in to it:

Music
Sfx
THE IMAGES TO MOVE SMOOTHLY!!
Genral enhancements
More playability
More Images on screen (the dont have to move - the screen looks to
                       plane a the moment)




I know that the author of this lost the orignal one and is now behind :-(
If he wants I will help code Pang and help get it finished on time :-)

Hi,

In my "Test Results" mail I couldnt comment on the gfx due to zip
file problems (that are now solved)

I'd just like to say that the graphics are amazing
I think that there all brilliant :-)

In the shooter stage and the castle assault stage Bubbas body is a
Blue colour but in the really cool rendered images his body is white
Is it ment to be like this ?

Apart from this I like the gfx ALOT

making more tunes, perhaps one for the config screen, is always a good idea.

    Ok, First A arrow appears then the text appears at the end of the screen
    then Workbench comes back to the front

    After loading my floppy WB the same error occurs !

    Ok, I dont have DOStrace - please e-mail it to me it might help to
    solve my problem

    Please check out the end of this mail - there is a snoopdos.log file
    of what happens when I try to load the Shooter demo - I couldnt pick
    out the error !

    I should also tell you that the first shooter demo works fine !!
    The filename of the first shooter demo was "sideshooter.lha"

More tunes are on the way. Any more left to do? So far there are still
the tunes for all the levels (with appropriate subtunes for bosses etc),
the game won tune, the config screen tune, maybe another hiscore tune,
and probably an extension to the intro tune.

I've started work on a UFO type game (basically only perspective-wise).

So I have icons that will be used in it shaped like diamonds.

like so:/\
        \/

I am having trouble with the proper detection of  which icon the character is in.

Should I just use a grid concept? Or can somebody help me with a shorter method?

hehe. I'm lobbying to change that. I'm thinking screenshots 
will be available within the next week. Sound good?

Btw, sorry for the laugh, but you worded it funny.

Not sure about any smaller ones, but there is Paint Shop Pro (which I 
use on my PC, my personal favorite besides Deluxe Paint of course), 
which you can look into from Jasc, Inc. at http://www.jasc.com
