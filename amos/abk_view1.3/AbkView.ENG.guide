@node OBS "How to use Abk View 1.3"

 You must simply click on a button with name of the object that you want to see or hear.
 Then by using a requester select an ABK-bank with these objects.
 By viewing sprits, bobs or icons you must type a number of an object that you
 want to see. Then by using "NEXT" or "BACK" you can see other objects.
 Clicking on "OK" you can  return to the menu.

@node EXE "Installation"
 Move ABK-View drawer with contents to the directory that you want to have it.
 A Programm is runable from  Workbench or Shell.

@endnode

@node WYM "System Requirements "
 To use ABK-VIEW you need at least 150kb of memory and
 a powerpacker.library in "libs" directory.
 I only tested !?! Abk View 1.3 on A1200 with 6MB RAM and Kickstart 3.0.

@node VER "What's new in version 1.3"

 - An adaptation to work with  processors faster then 020.
 - Additional button "BACK" by viewing sprites, bobs and icons.
 - A better multitasking (don't slows down system so much as older versions do).
 - A number of current object is displayed by viewing bobs, sprits and icons.
 - A better location of buttons "NEXT", "BACK" and "OK" on the screen (they don't
   disturb when viewing  larger objects).
 - Documentation is in AmigaGuide format now.
 - When you choose a bank for viewing, a number of objects in bank is now displayed.

@node ERR "Bug reports"

 The main program often doesn't work  on A600 and this is a big problem
 (probably with amos-compiler).
 When you reach an end by viewing  icons (the last icon) the program
 run back to the menu.
 Please send other bugs, comments etc.  to @{"author" link AUT}.
