   Attention all AMOS, Easy AMOS, and AMOS Pro coders!  Attention please!!!

Being the most obnoxious and loudest AMOS advocate on the network, I have
decided to administer the list!  That's right, I have assumed control!

	To SUBSCRIBE to the AMOS list, goto

http://www.onelist.com/subscribe.cgi/amos-list

and register (if you are not a ONEList user already).  Once subscribed you
will receive a confirmation email.  Please reply to that email using its
instructions and you will be subscribed to the list.

	Okay, now that you have subscribed, this is how you send a message to
everyone on the list.  Compose your message as normal and send it to:

	amos-list@onelist.com

	That is all you do!  Everyone, including yourself, will get a copy of
your message.  What a great way to find out about updates and ask questions
about anything relating to AMOS!

	So what are you waiting for?  Subscribe then send a message to amos-list
introducing yourself and telling everyone what you do with AMOS!
