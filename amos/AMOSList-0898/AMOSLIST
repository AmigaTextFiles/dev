Or even just via e-mail, with keyfile protection like I had to do for MUI and
Magic WB? (I don't have a CD ROM drive either, nor am I planning to get one) I
do have a Zip drive though....
Keep up the great work you guys

From: "Alastair Murray" <malcolm.murray@virgin.net>

Just to add myself to he ICQ database:
Alastair Murray, Muzza, 15173722

And as for AMOS future.
Great work guys! The future looks great!
As for examples on the AMOS update CD. I've done TONS of AMOS stuff as
you can see on my webpage. I'd be quite happy to contirbute both full
games/programs as well as example code. Mail me if you're interested.

As for AMOS NG. Sounds great. I think its just what we need too. I was
getting worried about how AMOS was going to be unuseable in the near
future.

One thing, I notice some other people have voiced concerned about this
too. That is about compatability with current AMOS programs.
I can fully understand that a lot of things will have to be done quite
differently but will keep as close as possible to current AMOS syntax?

Hmmm.. how about a code convertor? Input your AMOS Pro source code in
ASCII and out comes the AMOS NG equivilent. Of course you could then
go through it and make all the necassary optimisations that AMOS NG
would have. Thats the sort of thing I could do myself actually.

Anyway, great work. Please keep us updated as to how progress goes.

-Murray

Eveyone wants it ;}
But I cant set a date yet, things arent going that well with GMS
lately due some problems which should be fixed within a week.
These problems has slowed the production down for a full
month now but the author of GMS has assured me that he will
have them all fixed VERY soon, once that is fixed I'll work a lot
on it all I know for sure is that it will be done before mid November.

I'll post a msg to the list once I am able to set a date,

From: Pietro Ghizzoni <ghizzo@agonet.it>

Hi!

Due to the several messages about the Amos future, i'll reply to all the
questions here:

1- i'm sorry... i've not mentioned this before, but obviously the upgrade will
be available on floppy disks too. (lite version). Anyway a CD is a must for
the full version.... I've a Zip drive, so on request, i can release a Zip
upgrade :)

2- Amos NG is written in C++ but the commands syntax is amos-like... for the
advanced users structured variables, declarations, and tag lists will be
available. For the basic users, all the standard basic functions are
available.
I'm sorry, but you can't directly import your Amos sources,  since the
commands are similar but not equal.

3- The AMOS NG editor will be good as the amos one. Anyway you can use your
favourite text editor like GoldEd or CygnusEd.

4- In the CD upgrade is present a new set of Arexx scripts wich allows you to
program in Amos in a more amiga-like way like the other compilers. Now you can
use GoldEd (.. or CygnusEd) and its adavanced features to write your programs,
and trough Arexx you can call the stand-alone amos compiler, and compile your
programs like the others professional C compilers.

5- Soon a new remaked version of The AMOS Factory homepage will be available,
and a new important AMOS project will start. Surprise, surprise :) For this
you have to wait again some days! hehehe.... in this period i was in silence,

A fool-proof method for sculpting an elephant: first, get a huge
block of marble; then you chip away everything that doesn't look
like an elephant.

Great! I'm very happy that someone working on it. I'm working

Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Braneloc@mirex.demon.co.uk (Keith Hill) (Keith Hill)

Well, first of all, to those who are in the know, my car got stolen on
wednesday.  ..the update is, the police recovered it, completely intact
with contents unmoved(!) today !  I was as shocked to find it intgact as
I was to lose it in the first place.  (Except I was a lot more pleased)

Second...

To all who have contributed to the CBATNAM project, I still need some
things from you, and this means **ALL** of you.  You know who you are.
This includes everyne who wrote ANYTHING, or submitted ANY graphics, or
ANY sound, even if it was not used in the final version.

	One:	A "Men In Black" style photo of you, in any format.
	Two:	One or two lines describing yourself in text format for
		the credits.

Send both to:
	bubba@mirex.demon.co.uk

Note, the picture can be in ANY format, I don't care, jpg is best.  If
you can't send a picture in digital format, a physical photo can be
returned.  If you have not got a black suit, wear the closest you can
get.  If you havn't got the shades, wear the closest you can get - but
expect your suit and glasses to be darkened on the final pic.  Don't
worry, you'll get to approve it b4 release.  

This is now URGENT....  Send as soon as possible.  To the people who
have already send the piccies, thankx, but you are very much in the
minority.

....if everyone contributes, it works, if someone misses out, it looks
bad for the rest of us..

I have an A1200 with a SquirrelScsi.  Cost about $100.  I think everyone 
should have a CD ROM drive.  You can get them cheap and get the 
interfaces cheap too ($100 is not bad or used of course).

Hmm, the old 1.3 Machines seem to never die. Well, Anthony, for private
reasons, you seem to be a programmer who are concentration og private
development of private software. I think that the new Amos will be so extended
for newer machines that it barely should only be used on new machines. New -
machines from 1992 - 1994, has many features that the original amos never
touched, but 1.3 machines WAS covered by the original Amos, and you may still
use Amos the Creator for your machine for many years to come. Being a person
with little cash (at the moment anyway) I still have upgraded to a Hi-spec
machine. Use the money you have to upgrade, at least to AGA! At least Kick
3.0!

I do not mean to say that A2000 is no good, because it an be with a gfx card.
At least, buy a Cybergfx-system!

Hi there,

Everyone was worried for a while. I was informed of the new Amos and what
it was to be like etc ages ago and I'm glad that Pietro and the gang have
the source code. At least I don't need to move over to Blitz :)

Yup, count me in on that too...

That's a damn fine good question too...

That sounds like a neat idea Murray. I'm sure either your good self
or one of the Amos NG coders will eventually get around to coding a
convertor. I certainly hope so also. Please give this one some
proper attention guys. Murray has a great idea there which should
not be taken lightly if ya ask me :-)

Hi there Michael,

I too had a text file which was in German (a dox file years ago for some
old App) and what I did was buy one of those English to German dictionaries
from WH Smith or Menzies etc.

I simply looked up the words and translated the dox guide easily :)

Why don't you do the same? Just a thought....

I think the main thing that concerns me, is the new programs I am developing,
rather than converting the old ones.  Converting would be nice, however.

Do I wait for Amos NG, do I use AmosPro today, do I use Blitz today, do I 
HiSoft today, or do I buy something for the peecee ?

Unfortunately, I am not 100% happy with ANY programming language that is
around today.  There just isn't enough damn flexibility.



...as soon as a kernel is available, I am available for development or
testing work.  I have an advanced project that needs writing, and needs
a decent machine to run on.

If you hadn't guessed, I've passed the data for CBATNAM on to Keith. I'm still
project coordinator, but Keith offered to give the final coding a bash, so he
got it.

The five levels are:
Space Attack - side shooter where Cap'n Bubba fights the nasty aliens on his
way to the planet.
Hang Glider - flight sim where Cap'n Bubba pilots his hang glider to the
surface of the planet.
Planet Attack - space harrier style where Cap'n Bubba fights the nasty aliens
on the planet.
The Gates Of Doom - tekken style fighting game where Cap'n Bubba faces the
toughest aliens in the planet.
Bubba's Bubbles - pang style quick level to gain extra points whenever the
Cap'n starts hallucinating.

Keith is also working on the cartoon intro screens and between level screens.
If you have anything to contribute, let us know. If the data I have given
Keith is any indication, the final game will be about 6 megs. We're hoping for
distribution by Mush. There will be a REAL manual, not just on-disk, and we
will hopefully release a cd version. In fact, maybe CBATNAM can go on the amos
updater cd due out later this year.

Well met and godspeed,

I'm soon to get a PPC with 040 and also a Bvision when they come out.

Does anyone have any problems with AMOS and any of these components?

Any good solutions for GFX card problems?

    Well, I use it with an 040 and the only problem is that above the
top screen strange things fliker every few seconds. Thats the only
problem I know of with 040's. I'm getting a PPC card soon so I'll inform
you about that.

As for GFX cards, you'd need one that automatically convert standard
Amiga displays to high sync ones. (eg, one with a fliker fixer). I'm not
sure if that'll work 100% though.


See ya.

Wasn't there a tutorial on a Disk Mag somewhere. Anyway, I've taught
myself
AMOS 3D by trial and error, and I must say its not as good as it shoud
have
been, its really hard to use. May as well wait for a new version.

I did manage to start a game with it though, I can send you the soure if
you
want

    (I think it needs CRAFT, DoomMUSIC, AMOSTurbo and maybe other
extentions)

See ya.

I've got a PPC604e/060 and a CyberGFX and a CyberGFXPPC. The only thing
causing problems with AMOS is CyberGFXPPC (not the normal one), as it doesn't
have a passthrough for PAL-screens. This means, that you have to run with two
monitors. One for CyberGFX-displays and one for PAL-displays (eg. AMOS)

Subject: [amos-list] TGE or not TGE
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Peter Cahill <cahill4@iol.ie>


Hello,

 As some of you know, games that are written using TGE may cost,
depending on if there freeware or not. This cost is due to TGE
using GMS, which I find it worth the extra cost.

GMS stands for 'Games Master System', it is a extremly fast
system, coded in a mixture of C and Asm. GMS does graphics
better than amos in from the fact that in amos on my 030@50
I can have about 60 bobs(8x8), and If I move 1 Its as jerky
as hell, but, with GMS on my 030@50, I have had about 300+
8x8 bobs on a higher res screen AND ALL the bobs were changeing
sizes and ALL moving at diffrent speeds, and they were nice
and Smooootthhh. GMS supports ECS,AGA and Gfx card modes.

The costs of 'GMS' are around 2/3 times the price of your game
if your game is free, then you dont need to pay anything. you
*DONT* need to mention GMS anywhere in your code And I honestly
think that if your game isnt gonna sell more than 2 copies then
you should release it as freeware.

The reason for this mail is that one person in particular
(hi giark) has been at me about it costing for quite some
time. Saying that he wont use it because 'He wont give
credit of his work to anyone else'.  After *MANY*
2 and 3 hour IRC sessions with this person I have decided
to settle this with a survey, of how many people actually
want TGE.

And Id like to see how many people wouldnt like TGE and
'wouldnt pay $5 for a GMS lisence for a shareware or
commercial game of theres' and 'wouldnt give any credit
of there creativity to someone else, as the author of
GMS didnt use creativity in making GMS' and 'wont pay
GMS because he didnt pay for his AmigaOperatingSystem'
but I always thaught that you paid for the OS when
buying a amiga, maybe Im wrong.

So could anyone who wants TGE to continue please
reply to this mail asap.

Also anyone who wants TGE to cease if its going to
cost ANYTHING, please reply also.

thanks,

I'd say get DME, but it has trouble with (in fact, I could not get it to play)
samples over 64k in size.

	Piece of cake, use the point command to figure out which colour is
beneath the mouse and then you know which area it's pointing to.
So:
	x=screen(x mouse)
	y=screen(y mouse)
	_colour = Point(x, y)
I'm not sure about the screen syntax but basically just be sure to use the
x and y SCREEN cordinates of the mouse as opposed to the x and y HARDWARE
cordinates which is wahy x mouse, y mouse give you.
	Does this make sense?  By making every area have it's own colour
you've really made it pretty easy on yourself, of course you're using 64
ehb mode and not HAM to get 50 colours right?

There are 2 auctions on EBAY (http://www.ebay.com) that is selling AMOS
Pro and AMOS Pro Compiler.  Just go to EBAY and search on AMOS Pro or
Amiga (to find all Amiga related items).  Make sure you click Search
Descriptions, too.  The short title says Amiga Programming and Amiga
Compiler (something like that).

Just in case you know someone looking to buy the software.

Subject: [amos-list] Setting the record straight

X-Status: 

From: "Mr. Giark To You" <giark@hicksville.ddns.org>

Recently, I've been talking with Peter Cahill about TGE. It's the extension
with fast bobs, AGA/RTG, CDDA, the whole nine yards. It uses internal code for
iconify. It uses ptreplay.library for pt commands. It uses GMS for all graphic
commands and CDDA.

Contrary to rumour, I am NOT trying to stop production of TGE. I have no
problem with TGE and, if you are willing to pay the price, it will do all the
things you want it to do.

What do I mean, "pay the price"? GMS, the external `heart' of TGE, has a very
nasty licensing agreement. It's one I do not agree to, and, because of that, I
do not use GMS. I will, however, use TGE for the non-GMS commands.

This is not a message to trash TGE, Peter, GMS or its programmer. This message
is a clarification of why I, personally, alone, on my own, will not use GMS.

For the purposes of this message, I am speaking about creating a game/app
using GMS graphics. The program under consideration would be released as
shareware. If you never plan to release anything as shareware, but only as
freeware, the money argument does not apply to you, though the other licensing
requirements may be of interest.

GMS is a collection of programming tools, to put it simply. It handles AGA/RTG
graphics and CDDA, among other things. It requires libs, modules and prefs to
be on the machine running the GMS-based program. They can all be in one
directory, but still, users have to have them to run the game you have
created, which means you have to either distribute the GMS package with your
creation or point the purchaser to dev/misc/GMS_User.lha on aminet.

>From the GMS agreement:
"DEVELOPERS LICENSE. Authors of GMS programs must obtain an official license
before public distribution of said programs.  Failure to obtain a license may
impede certain penalties as outlined in the licensing agreement file."

Meaning you have to ask permission to release your game. You wrote the code.
You wrote the music. You made the samples. You drew the graphics. You came up
with the whole idea. Now ask someone else for permission to release it. Does
that bother you at all?

>From the GMS agreement:
"The following table illustrates how much you will have to pay for a license
when you want to release a single game."

Each game/app. If you write a game, you pay him. If you write another, you pay
him AGAIN! How many times should you have to pay for the same commands?

>From the GMS agreement:
"`The cost of your game' is defined by the amount of money that a consumer has
to pay to buy it. For example, if it costs me $10US to buy your program, your
license will cost $20US."

Which begs the question, how high will you jack your prices up to offset the
cost of this continuing license?

>From the GMS agreement:
"Once you have your license you can sell your game for as long as you like,
and are also allowed to distribute the GMS binaries with it. In the above
case, the license cost would be recovered after selling just 2 copies of the
program."

Which means you have to sell at least three copies before you, the author, the
one who did all the work for that game, sees ANY profit. The argument can be
made that the GMS author did a lot of work, too. Agreed, he did. Once. So, I
should pay him, over and over again? That is not an equitable solution. He
wrote the graphic routines. He didn't write my game.

>From the GMS agreement:
"If you release more than one game in a year, your license fees can be lowered
(e-mail for details)."

But you will still be paying again and again for the same commands. The
argument has been put forth that you do the same thing when you buy AMOS. The
thing is, you don't have to send Europress money again each time you release a
game. If GMS was a one-time price, that would be fine, but it isn't. It's a
scheme to get the author of GMS cash for doing nothing. Would you have bought
AMOS if you had to pay more money each time you released a program?

Did you buy AMOS 3D? Do you pay more money every time you release a 3D game?
Did you register AmCAF? Do you have to send more money to the author for every
program you release using AmCAF? No? Hmm. Very interesting.

>From the GMS agreement:
"Here is the table:
+-------------------+--------------+
| Program Cost (US) | License (US) |
+-------------------+--------------+
|     $0 -  2.99    =     FREE     |
|     $3 - 13.99    =     $20      |
|    $14 - 18.99    =     $30      |
|    $19 - 23.99    =     $40      |
|    $24 - 29.99    =     $60      |
|    $30 - 34.99    =     $80      |
|    $35 - 39.99    =     $120     |
|    $40+           =     $200+    |
+----------------------------------+"

If I charge $40, it will COST me $200 to release my own work? That doesn't
come close to "the license cost would be recovered after selling just 2 copies
of the program", now, does it?

>From the GMS agreement:
"The good news is that freeware licenses are available at no charge...you
still must write in and ask for a license, so that I can put you on the
registered page."

So, I still have to ask for permission to release my own work.

>From the GMS agreement:
"If you release a sequel to your game (e.g. `Super Tetris II') you will need
to renew your license.  Major revisions (e.g.  V2.0) also require new
licenses.  Minor revisions (e.g.  V2.1), bug fixes, and patches do not require
you to re-license your game."

He's really covering all the angles, isn't he?

>From the GMS agreement:
"You should be able to recover your license cost after selling only 2 to 4
games."

Except in the examples in his chart, where it could take as many as five
copies.

>From the GMS agreement:
"Keep in mind that all license fees go towards the continuation of the
project, so by paying the fees you can ensure that GMS has a good future."

Maybe so. Still, sounds almost like a government inspired plan.

>From the GMS agreement:
"If you release a game without a license you will face some penalties. It not
only damages the project, but moves it closer to the PC (I have one sitting on
my desk)."

Well. `If you don't give me money, I'm gonna go play with the PC boys.' I can
not tell you how many `faithful' amiga users spout this crap at the drop of a
hat. If you're just in it for the money, you probably should go play with the
PC boys. Who cares about integrity, right?

>From the GMS agreement:
"We will also run a list of people that are found to have not paid for
licenses. Since the list is publicly available, it may be e-mailed to other
web pages and newsgroups for posting. To be fair to you, we give up to 2 weeks
notice if you haven't paid the license fee. After that, you go on the list. If
you break the rules and want to rectify your mistake, you can be pulled from
the list by paying for the license plus another 20% for the trouble you
caused."

How does that sound to you? Are you ready to rush out and get GMS? It makes me
feel all warm and fuzzy, that's for sure.

Don't send me giant responses to this letter, touting the wonders of GMS. I
don't care. The licensing agreement (slavery) does not appeal to me.

Granted, this isn't the whole of the licensing text. Rest assured that I did
not cut out any of the `good points', nor did I remove text to make my point.
You can read them for yourself, but be advised, the licensing agreement is
conspicuously absent from the GMS_User.lha archive. The developer archive does
contain the licensing agreement, if you want to read up on it.

In conclusion, I am not telling you to avoid GMS. I am not telling you to
avoid TGE. I am not slagging Peter or the GMS author. I AM pointing out the
pitfalls/costs of using GMS. Use if if you want. I won't and the reasons I
won't are abundantly clear.

I will not reply to any messages about GMS. I am not trying to start a
flamefest/argument/debate. This is my opinion. It is not my intention to
influence your decision, only to make you aware of the facts.

If the colours are all different, using the point command or something will
detect the colour under the mouse (xmouse,ymouse), I think.

I had a more of a go with Blitz recently and was quite suprised to find
that it had far more bugs and problems than AMOS ever had. It doesn't
support many basic things (such as proper shape clipping) and is a pain to
use. Even procedures/functions are very poorly implemented. How did it ever
get popular?
It seems apart from a few better structures there is only the fact that the
screens are OS friendly that gives it any advantage over AMOS.
Perhaps a slight speed advantage too but its not as much as some people
make out.

I agree. AMOS has screen problems and lack of updates (soon to be changed
of course!), Blitz is just full of all sorts of problems and then there is
nothing between them and C (at least for developing games).
I don't have the time to code in C (although I am slowly doing a bit) but
get annoyed at the screen problems with AMOS.

Problem is that the Bvision which is what I'm going to get does not have a
scan doubler....

AMOS 3D certainly could have been much better, however it is possible to
get some reasonable results out of it once you get to know it well. 
My main problem is the terrible object editor program. It is so inprecise.

Anyway, check out Star Fighter from Geosync for a good example.
Also just the other day there was an AMOS 3D example put on AMINET. It is
of a flight simulator and although the graphics are simple it does go
pretty fast and smoothly and is a good example of creating a whole 3D
world.

I found that games in space are not too hard to do because you can get away
with not that many objects, however cames on land are much harder because
they require scenery. They can be done though!

-----

One last thing. I'm really starting to worry how I'll be able to work on
AMOS once I get my GFX card and monitor. I can't take a TV and monitor
everywhere with me.
I understand that the updated version of AMOS will have provisions for a
screen friendly editor. How long until this is ready? Is there no fix I
could get to do this? Also, will this new version of AMOS have more OS
friendly screens (in game screens) or will that have to wait until AMOS NG?

Thanks,
-Murray

	Perhaps I am a poor sample of the population at large, but I for
one never aim to make money off anything I write in amos.  I code for the
fun and thrill of unleashing my imagination in a way only a groovy
computer like the amiga could let me.
	So bottom line is this, if TGE will help my convert my ideas to
reality without alot of frustration then of course I'd want to use it, and
if it proved proffesional enough a package (ie stable, well documented) I
wouldn't mind paying to use it.
	My 2 cents,
		Scott Matott sXe

I would like to see GMS and TGE first...  I have never used either.  Does it
cost for me to get a copy that I can use in my AMOS programs?  Or is the
cost incurred when I release a non-freeware piece of software.

Thanks

If the license is a one off payment (which covers any releases I make) 
then I have no real problems...

The tge extension is a must release for AmosPro. However, I do hope that 
this license prob does not get carried over to the new Amos (i.e. I hope
the new amos doesn't use GMS while there is a licensing cost). Maybe there 
are some out there that only release freeware, but it is not for everyone 
to suddenly say that charging for a game is bad. It is not, a lot of hard 
work goes into many Amos games. And so the license charge does prove a bit
of a bugger. But as I said; if it is one off and only a very small cost then
this is ok. 

PAC, keep on with tge...(only hurry up ;o) )

But I can see where giark is coming from. 


Let's all party and forget about all our differences, PAC bring the alcohol,
Giark bring the munchies....All friends again. :oD

Jono

P.S.
*Very Important*
Anyone who is good to very good with gfx and is interested in joining a gfx
adventure project (already in developement) then pleeze contact me...We are
looking for as many as possible (as long as they can recreate the style :)

For examples of the standard, just see the the website:- www.enti.demon.co.uk

thanking you all   ;oY

I think that the best and easiest way is one Scooter told you about, but if
you are
using 50 different colors only because of finding area, I would suggest you
method with which you can use only one color, if you want:

1) Create array which will hold X and Y coordinates of one point in the
middle of each area.
2) When mouse is clicked, use Paint command on mouse coordinates (of
course, translate hardware coordinates into screen coordinates), with color
which doesn't belong to any area.
3) Use Point() for every point in your array to find which point has that
color.
4) That's your area. Now just paint it again in the old color. If you use
color
which have diferent index, but same value as original, this wouldn't be
visible by the user (or, I guess, player ;) .

Don't ya dare give up on TGE PAC! We're all waiting for it...

Sure some of us may feel pissed off about GMS and it's
author's way of
payment etc, but it's just summat we will have to live with

Yeah, can I be a greedy twat and ask for those too? I've
never really gotten into Amos 3D, so a few tutorials would
maybe change my mind :)

Hi,



I wrote that article you are refering to.  Do you have all the
tutorials? There were four.  It would be great if you did, because I
have lost one of the disks myself and would like a replacement.

list for almost a year and I see things just havent changed, capn bubba =
still not finished, arguing between blitz and amos and also the wishful =
thinking that someone somewhere is going to market an enhanced version =
of AMOS,  for me I wish the latter was going to happen, but =
unfortunately the reality of it all is NOT LIKELY, well not for the =
current Amiga architecture that we all know and love, so just like all =
the other Amiga owners, we will have to wait and see what transpires (if =
anything) of the future platform and its development tools, so until =
then we use what we have and play around on this fun but old looking =
machine.

I say forget writing games, forget writing 3rd rate extensions for Amos =
Pro, develop something that displays the current and high-end amiga =
technology, develop multimedia applications, theres a far greater future =
in that, after all, why did we all buy an amiga in the first place? =
graphics and sound !!!

To all who have contributed to the CBATNAM project, I still need some
things from you, and this means **ALL** of you.  You know who you are.
This includes everyne who wrote ANYTHING, or submitted ANY graphics, or
ANY sound, even if it was not used in the final version.

	One:	A "Men In Black" style photo of you, in any format.
	Two:	One or two lines describing yourself in text format for
		the credits.
 
Do it NOW !!  I know who you are...  If you can't do it, I want a decent
excuse why not.  Everyone should be able to get their hands on a camera,
and everyone should be able to write a line about themselves.

...by the way, if YOU don't write it, I will...............

What disks?  The articles are all in the magazine and we got no disk with
them.  They did say to write in and ask for the disk if you couldn't be
bothered writing in the code, but I guess you just want the articles, not
the disks?

I guess I'll have to get them scanned in then.

And yes, I do have them all.

*TGE, the most breathtaking event due for AmosPro for YEARS! If it would*
*not be completed, then we are stuck with the OCS-ECS forever*, or
at least until Amos3 comes out. PaC! You know how badly I need this
extension, and you know I'll pay for GMS, and I know that I don't have
to pay for GMS until I decide to release my work! Also, the crippled version
of GMS only have some unneeded features crippled. The game extension
is a MUST for my developments to be continued. Squeek2 and G®RD-AGA
needs the extension to be done before being able to be realized! You know
that Cybergfx and AGA boosting for Amos will make Squeek2 and Gord beat
every other similar games by hundredfolds! Again: You MUST complete
the game extension! Though nobody can push you... If you finally decide
to give the extension up, then why not give all the sources to someone who
is up to the task of completing the extension!?

*Squeek 2, relies on fast bobs and preferably cybergfx. My game already runs*
*on cybergfx, but the bobs are so slow that only three objects can be moving*
*at one time on the screen before every goes slow-motion*. This is not good
for a puzzle/action game which is going to beat Dizzy in every field. But as
from what you have told me, your extension would make my game AWESOME.
Thing of it if: Threasure Island Dizzy was a bit easier, a bit lastier and
featured
32000 colour bobs and 32000 colour backdrops! Also, more that five moving
objects on every screen! This game will be awesome with TGE and to reward
you and the others supporting the project, free copies of the finished game
will
be sent to you! (Though the game will probably be featured on >12 disks).
I want a CD-Writer and TGE!!!!

find something you will use.

Hi,=20

If you are that concerned about copyright, do this:-

Copy all your material to floppy
Place in an envelope=20
Mail it to yourself
Store away for safe keeping, DO NOT OPEN

What does this prove?

Well, the post office will date stamp your package and any copyright =
problems that could occur will be avoided as you have proof that your =
material was produced prior to the date on the envelope

I may not have kept up to date on the Amiga scene as i once did, but one
thing i do know, the Amiga community is in a state of flux and it will
remain this way until new hardware and development are available.  Dont get
me wrong Amos is alot of fun to use compared to anything ive seen on the
Amiga over the years, but its aged due to the inventor jumping ship or just
plain getting on with his life, if you're gonna write games, do it on a
platform where the hardware is consistent, what about the sony playstation
development machine, you get all the tools and if the game is any good you
get Sonys backing!!!! you cant go wrong there,  games in Amos look bad,
regardless of the extensions, they're just plain slow and 8bit looking, the
truth hurts i know, but im just giving you a word of advice as ive been
developing professionally now for 16 years across many platforms.

It's the AMOS upgrade cd with all the new extensions and bugfixed AMOS code.
It's being headed by Pietro Ghizzoni.

Due to my system upgrade, which took 6 months (a hell of a lot longer than I'd
hoped), but we are in the final process now. All the code is done. It's just a
matter of putting it together. Read the messages.

Ever been to AMOS Factory? Obviously not. Speak not of what you know not of.
I've already received the first "wishful thinking" upgrade to the AMOS
library. Have you looked at the GUI extension or TGE?

I suggest you go to aminet and get all the AMOS digests and read up on them.

Bully for you.

Go ahead. And do it using your AMOS. I'll do it using mine - bugfixed, with
GUI and all that. Let's see which one looks better.

Is it possible to replace the hard drive unit within the A590 case with
another?
If it is possible, there is a connection on the main board for SCSI and IDE
so what size and type of drive should I look for if this is possible?

Thanks in advance.

Declan.

	Dave,
	I sympathize, esp. with your comment about Blitz vs Amos, but in
defense of the list it is still filled with incredibly helpful and cheery
blokes if you have a problem, and it still shows off what I think is the
Amiga's greatest acheivement, people using their computer's to create. 
Amos as you will recall was originally dubbed "The Creator" and everything
else aside the list still shows it living up to that name.

			Thanks,
				Scott Matott sXe

	Samples are also available on the Aminet, under sound/samples
	I think?  Well anyway I know they are there as I've down loaded a
bunch, some pretty tasty samples in the lot.

Hm  it should be 50 areas and 16 colurs (Hires)

Think it works now....
I just use normal square zones around each shape and
then find the color in that area with point.

It works as long as shapes next to each other don't have
the same colour.

The shapes don't overlap or move.

You need to pay Sony for a lisence, and copyprotection(not required)
I think, cos of every game baught sony get £3, and in Final Fantasy
7 there is NO copy protection ( I heard) so I think it may be voluntry.

I know a guy whos m8s with Pysgnosis, I'll ask him to see
what way it really is.

Maybe your PPC 040 doesnt have a FPU in it ?

Im unsure but I'll check it out for ya.

Well, I think Miami is better anyway ;o}
but I DO use AmiTCP aswell. Miami is great for
just going online, but amitcp is good for the whole
amitcp:bin/ drawer. So I go online with miami,
and use the amitcp tools ;oP

Yep It can be done, either use the graphics
grabber in HRTmon, or theres a screen snapshot
function on aminet which can do amos's screens.

No, CDDA is internal in TGE as are quite a few other features that you left out,
like the encryption for example.

No, I have provided methods of suppling a 'small' version of GMS, this
DOES make your code about 60-70k bigger, but enables all GMS features. Whats
missing is just the docs, prefs and some other extras.

He wrote more than 'just the graphic routines' and if you release a game
which wont sell more than 2 copys it should be freeware.

No, wrong again, you make it sound much worse than it is, all he
asked was that you let him know that you want a lisence, and YOU
WILL GET IT, its not a maybe.

Thats cos guys like you atack at all angles dont you ?

You love putting this so harsh dont you, why didnt you make something up
like'and if you dont pay the lisence I'll kill you' in that somewhere ?!?

The Developer lisence isnt in the user archive because its for
*Developers*, I found that fairly simple to understand. as for
'nor did I remove text to make my point', I think you have,
youve given a completely exadurated one sided view.

'I am not telling you to avoid GMS', yes you are, you HAVE said
that anyone who uses TGE is a slave, and you HAVE suggested that the
author of GMS only wrote it for money and doesnt care about the amiga
so yes you *are telling people to avoid GMS* which is also telling
people to avoid TGE.

YOUR not starting a argument ?!?
you did, remember about 3 months ago when this started,
only now you took it onto the list and if you think
that your not infulenceing decisions then your wrong again,
telling people that there *slaves* if they use TGE is
influencing a decision.

And to stop endless treads of this I have mailed a TGE or not TGE
mail to see if anyone wants it.

PS: Are you like this when you might have to pay for any software ?
    cos how can you expect people to buy your software when you
    wont buy others software.

	Hey there,
	Have any of you folks ever checked out the Amos PD cd's, I've seen
two for sale pretty cheap and was wondering if they were worth the
investment, it'd give my CD-Rom a break from that steady diet of Zeppelin
I feed whilst programming. :)

I have both AMOS PD CDs.  You only need the second one, though.  It has
all that the first has on it (in the way of AMOS PD) plus more.  I think
it is worth it as it has lots of sprites and bobs to use.

	Well 50 shapes and only 16 colours means trouble, do the shapes
ever overlap?  and do shapes of the same colour ever appear close to one
another, infact, is the colour of the shape critically important,
otherwise you could partition up the screen into 4 sections, giving each
section say 12 or 13 shapes, and then each shape can have it's own colour
and wallah!  Otherwise I'll need some time to think about this one, do the
shapes move at all?  Are the really large?  You could have them all
secretly copied to the Bob bank and then use a collision detect to find
out what's beneath the pointer.
hmmm is right

I think the GMS fees are fair and I will certainly use TGE.
The one thing I think is unfair is that of user registration but that
isn't too bad either.

Basically, if you are making any program that is free, there's nothing
to worry about and you can use all the enhanced features for nothing.

If you are producing software that you charge for then you have to pay
the price of about two registations. Thats nothing. Its not like you
will be knowcking up games every month (if you are then they are most
likely not of good enough quality to charge money anyway) so you don't
have to pay much at all.

I think there was only my comment on them which I made purely because I had
only recently tried it fully and was surprised by it.
Maybe you should have read a few more letters before writing this?

LOL
Errr... it HAS happened!
There is now a group of coders on this list who own the source code and are
releasing first an enhanced CD of AMOS and then more in the future a
complete rewrite called AMOS NG.
This will be written in C so will be portable in the future.
Maybe you should have read a few more letters before writing this?

Exactly, graphics and sound. Ideal for games.

Anyway, the vast majority of amos coders do it in there spare time as a
hobby. Who wants to create a boring multimedia app as a hobby? Leave that
for the professionals who have the resources and time available.

So here's a reply...

Hi there Declan,

and documentation

be doing?

For starters, do NOT put (c)!!! use the Copyright symbol
which is © (Alt & E together on GB keymap). (c) isn't really
the Copyright sign! It is not legally accepted as far as I
recall! Or am I wrong on this? - Anyone?

Anything you produce is automatically copyrighted to you. If
you want to be doubly sure, post a copy of your work to
yourself 9don't open it though) and keep it safe. You could
also post a copy to your solicitor (like, yeah, we all have
one :) for double safety :-)

If it's copyright rules you need for your dox, isn't there a
standard set somewhere?

Hi there Michael,

though.  It has

more.  I think

I too had both, but sold the 1st one coz it was the same as
the follow up. like ya said, the follow up had everything the
1st had, and more :)

It's well worth having the Amos PD CD Rom if you want .abk
files alone or some neat source code to learn/leach from!

I haven't looked at my CD for a whilee now, but I bet there's
still loads I have yet to look at on there.

And I just know i have NOT looked at the Totally Amos disk
mags yet either! Amoszine was the best Amos mag if ya ask me,
but then again, I would say that :-)

So here's a reply...

Hi there guys,

Now  you  have  to admit, that is a very true statement. Well
said.

What  is  wrong  with  paying  for  GMS  anyway? You pay, you
use, you
benefit  by  better  productions and hopefully more people
buy and you
make more money.

Well, that's my theory anyway ;D

I know I shall be using TGE when it's released and if I don't
like the
GMS  side of things, I'll simply won't use it and therefore
won't have
to pay.

Why  make  your minds up now? Wait for the TGE demos to
arrive and see
what you could be missing out on...

>From  what  I have seen and head so far, I'm impressed, after
all, AGA
games  in  Amos  is something we have all been wanting for a
long long
time - right?

Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>


	Howdy,
	Last night I got a bright idea and drafted up some code that uses
a rainbow to create a scrolling ground effect ala Space Harrier or 3D
world runner.  It's a simple effect and I've seen it down a 1,000 times
with colour shifting, but this routine's genuis is that it eats up only
colour register thanks to the use of rainbows.  Also it's easy to control
the speed/smoothness of it all and I get 60 fps off my loop.  Anyway if
anybody's interested in how to do such a thing drop me a line. 
	
			Thanks,
				Scott Matott sXe
PS
	Has anybody out there ever gotten more than one Rainbow to appear
on the same scan line, the manual says it can be done just not easily.
Still it I could do it this routine could prove much, much more powerful.

Depending on your skill level there's a LOT of examples you could check out.
Quite a work to get through all the crap, though.

I have the AMOS PD CD Volume 1, and found it entertaining
and at times useful. If you would like to check out the
contents, there is an amiga guide index with search tool
on my pages:

http://home.sprynet.com/sprynet/ragriffi/wbmisc.htm

(Of course, while you're there pop back to home, and check
out the ttf.library ;)

I use AsimCDFS, it works like a charm. However, not all cd-rom
drives can read CDDA as data. Older drives (or older designs)
won't do it. It was not a technical limitation, it was the Phillips
CD technology license that forbid the direct export of CDDA as
a digital stream.

Subject: [amos-list] To be or not TGE.
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>

On the issue of TGE:

I'd have to say that it sounds like a welcome addition to any AMOS user or
developer (just as both AMCAF and GUI have been). The fact that it uses GMS
as part of it's infrastructure isn't a problem with me, and I would have to
agree with the others who have stated their freeware/charge money solution.
(If you don't sell more than a few copies, then it's probably freeware).

I can't say that the restrictions imposed by GMS are TOTALLY unreasonable
(the fees namely), although I can say that I don't really like them. In a
half-sense, it sounds like the author of GMS is just trying to make a few
(sometimes more than) bucks off of his program. But as Andy Gibson said,
"if you don't want to pay, then don't use it". I would have to agree. If I
choose not to use it, I'm sure I can find something else to substitute.

I do promote Peter in his efforts, and I will encourage him to continue.
This project has been a long time in coming, and although I may need TGE as
badly as some of my fellow developers, I will welcome it's timely arrival.

PS: I can understand Giark's perspective, but I must say it came off VERY
half-cocked. Although I might support a few of his points, he sounded like
the perfect example for the next "Lazy Programmer Poster Child".

I'm wrinting a hex editor that is just finished.
I want to include read and write tracks, so you might edit save disk
that use trackdisk.

Also it would be fun o read trackdisk games to hack around.

Do se if you find it :)

Also I'm looking for sources.

I have the same problem. The regged version of IDEFIX should solve the prob
for you, but
OptyCDPlayer does have the same `track download` mechanism. But none work for
me :(
I have a rare cd-player that uses the ATAPI cable in the a4ooo. Toshiba 12x cd
rom. But
shurely, SOMEONE should write a trackdownload program!!! It is damn useful.
But if you
have a scsi cd-rom, you should have no problem :)

From: "Mr. Giark To You" <giark@hicksville.ddns.org>

A friend on IRC asked for a program to rename an entire directory. The result
is Renamer (FBN-Rnam.lha). It can be found on aminet. What it does it let you
pick a directory, root name and base number, after which it goes through the
directory and renames every file, retaining the extension (last four
characters).

Subject: [amos-list] 3-D Ground Scroll Code Idea
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>


	Wow!
	I guess I didn't really expect much interest in this one, well now
that the spot light is on I just hope the idea is actually a good one,
worked like a charm for me but who knows...

	Ok here's an outline of what i did, oh and the ground it produces
is sadly not a checker pattern like Space Harrier (This could easily be
done though if only we could put two rainbows on the same scan line)
But insteadis the same thing w/o the checkering so just a scroll of two
bars of colour.
	Anyway, here's the idea:
	
	Pre-program a simple 3-D scroll, read out this info and use the
Rain command to make 
	

Here's a rough sketch of how I did it:

	First I used Dpaint IV in this way
	I drew up a red big square then I cut it out and 
	stuck a White copy of it onit's top, making a two colour
	rectangle wplit down the middle (got the idea)
	
	Then I set Frames to 100 and used perspective mode and the
	Move requester with Fill option to make a scrolling ground
	(Have you all done this before, if not I can tell you how)
	I also deleted the top garbage looking part of the scroll
	(about the first 18 lines of it) Leaving a scroll that 
	was about 9 'bars' of colour deep. Does that make sense?

	Ok then I saved each frame into Ram numbered 1 to 50.
	
	Then I set up a loop in amos to load each frame and
	starting from the bottom of the screen move up using
	the Point command, grabb the y cordinate at each change in
	colour.

	So I ended up with 9 numbers telling me where
	each "bar" in the scroll started.  As well I could
	find the where each bar ended by taking the starting point
	of the next bar and subtracting one.  (The last bar always
	has the same end point which is the top y cord. of my scroll)

	I copied all of these starting points into a Memory bank
	using poke as the are all numbers less than 256.  

	I did the same for each frame, copying them all into
	a bank of size 50*9 (50 frames, nine bars per frame)

	Do you get the idea yet?   Now I have a memory bank which
	tells me where to start and finish drawing horizontal
	bars of colour to produce a scrolling ground.  

	So from there the rest is simple, but the rainbow part is what
	makes it all worth while
	
	I just set up a loop to read these start and end points
	back out and then draw the bars of colour into the Rainbow
	which is fast, fast, fast!

	So the code looks like this
	
	First set up a Rainbow 200 scan lines big with nothing in it
	then display it (again 200 lines big, or 255 is it for Pal?)

	I used Colour register 2 for my rainbow, so then clear
	the screen in colour 2.

	Use the Rain command to black out the part of the Rainbow you
	won't use, (So my Scroll is about 82 pixels high, so I used rain
	to stick $000 into the first 118 scan lines of the rainbow)

	Now use a loop like this

	For FRAME=0 to 49
	For _BAR=0 to 8  
Rem Get start and End for colour Bar
		_START = Fetch_Bar_Start[_BAR,FRAME]  
		If _BAR=8 Then _END=118 
			Else _END =Fetch_Bar_Start[_BAR,FRAME] - 1
Rem Pick a Colour for the Bar, Notice for a looping scroll you will
Rem to Do a little more work here
		If _BAR mod 2 = 0 Then _COLOUR=4096
			Else _COLOUR=3000 

rem Now a loop that puts the right colour in each scan line of the bar
rem you must go from _end to _start because of Amos's cordinate system
rem Which has 0 on the top of the screen and 199 on the bottom.
		For Z=_END to _START
			Rain(0,Z)=_COLOUR
		Next Z
	Next _BAR
	Next FRAME

	Does any of this make any sense?  The idea is simply to preprogram
your scroll and then use rainbow to display it, the genius is that it uses
only one colour and it has serious potential.  
	Because the whole thing is stored as a list of Frames you can move
at any speed you want, 4 Frames at a time, 1 Frame at a time, ect. ect. 
You can also move backwards easily too.  Plus at 50 frames the resolution
of the scroll is very good and everyhting looks very smooth no matter what
speed you go at.  The only caveat to all this is to make sure to handle
things right in looping from the last frame back to the first (ie careful
with FRAME=54 or FRAME=-2) 
	There are no restrictions on what colour the Bars can be, and by
using another memory bank as a Map it'd be very easy to program 'levels'
to scroll through, with gaps in the ground (ie black Bars) and baddies
waiting at certain bars, ect. ect.
	My plan is not to have the entire ground scroll but instead just
use a narrow strip down the center of the screen.   This looks alot
better, as I have the strip tilted in perspective giving sort of
guidelines to your eyes for the depth of the whole thing.    

	Anyway, hope this makes sense, any questions ask away, I have the
code, wish I'd brought it with me, but I'm off on break til next thursday
so it maybe awhile before I can answer you.  Still I'll be around for a
while today.
			Thanks,
				Scott Matott sXe

Got a question

How do I get the GUI extension and the new AMOS library to work properly?
The guide file for the GUI extension was not complete.  It lacks telling me
which slot to put the Gui.lib file to in the AMOS configuration.  Also, if I
use the AMOS 2.1 library, and I run AMOS_PRO after installing it in my libs:
directory, AMOS locks with a black screen.

Help here would be appreciated.  I won't be able to try your suggestions
till this evening, but let me know something here.

Thanks in advance!

They are extremly hard to get hold of and on top of that you need a good PC
to connect it too.
We are using AMIGAs because either we don't have/can't afford PC's or more
likely because we don't like them.

I don't quite understand you, you make it sound like we are trying to
produce commerical games. It can be done (and has been many times) but most
people here are just making them for fun.

Even if we did start programming a Playstation, the game quality would not
improve very much because we don't have access to professional equipment.
You need teams of artists, programmers and top quality 3D
scanning/rendering hardware to make most good modern games.

> you get all the tools and if the game is any good you
> get Sonys backing!!!! you cant go wrong there,  games in Amos look bad,
> regardless of the extensions, they're just plain slow and 8bit looking, the

If they are 8 bit looking that is because we don't have the backing of
professional game artists. It would be no different if we moved to a
playstation.
You make it sound as though the graphics draw themselves.

As for speed. A playstation is obviously faster but the sort of games that
we write anyway would make no impact on that platform because all the kids
want is flashy 3D graphics and techno music (ok... a stereotype :)

And anyway, I am getting a PPC tommorow and intend to start developing some
games for that. Is it going to look any better than my AMOS stuff? Probably
not. It will run faster (although I am good at optimising AMOS stuff anyway
so don't complain about its speed) and may be able to use higher resolutions
but it won't improve my dire graphics skills!!!

> truth hurts i know, but im just giving you a word of advice as ive been
> developing professionally now for 16 years across many platforms.

Exactly. You're developing professionally. We're not.

I know I could get faster games if I moved over to coding on a PC. I have
tried but for me it takes most of the fun away from it.

Programming on the AMIGA means it is more fun for me (and I do it for fun!)
and it also lets me support my favourite platform in some small way.

You may only be interested in the money side so it obviously better for you
to code on PCs/Playstations but we do it for a hobby.

Now just stop trying to put everyone down doing something they enjoy.

Actually, I think in the GUI 1.7 archive it does not say what slot it is
in.  I don't know if it says you need to use GUIComp or the GUI Patch
(for amos.library) still or not.  And, do you need to use the patch if
you download the amos.library 2.1 from The AMOS Factory?

Well, the GUI Path patched amos.library to work with programs using the
GUI Extension.  GUIComp is what you use to compile programs using the
GUI Extension.

At least I think that is right.  I am sure Pietro can explain it better.
Pietro, perhaps include a list of files needed for GUIExt 1.7 as the 1.7
and 1.62 archives are different.

Incidentally... I'd like to see a list of commercial games made with AMOS.

Should your talent support your platform, or should your platform support your

Er... anybody who's good enough to make a commercial game will make a
commercial game. Unless his daddy is very rich.

Come on. Have you ever noticed that this list is full of messages from people
begging for extensions and things, in order to make their programs look more
professional, serious and modern?

Besides if you're having fun with something, bikes, cars, anything, you're
gonna want the best possible stuff, whatever your criteria are. I'm having a
lot of fun while porgramming (even COMMERCIAL games), so I simply want the
best stuff according to my criteria. Makes sense?

Subject: [amos-list] Non Amos- Help! PPC killed AmiTCP!
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,


    I've gone with the flow and got a Blizzard PPC for my A1200.

    It mostly works fine, although it just won't cold boot (I have to
reboot
whenever I turn it on), and more importantly, it has killed AmiTCP. As
soon 
as I upgraded, I found using the net was impossible, but when I tried my
demo 
of miami, that worked fine! 
 It should work on my PPC's 040 as it worked on my old 040.

    I got AmiTCP with Netconnect V1, do you thing that upgrading to
V2 would sort the problem out?


I'd be greatful if someone could help me with this little prob.


See ya.

Err , I have, but's it's a arse, you need a sampler (pref 16bit) then you
sample thw whole song fron the headphone jack as a 8svx (or prefrabbly a 16
bit WAV) then cut off teh bit's you don't like in your favorite samel
editor, then smak it into mp3enc :) I Have neaver managed to read direct
CDDA beacuse my device is atapi (i think) i all ways come out with White
noise if i do, I think all the problams are caused buy the CD not being
played back though the amig's hardware ? I think .

Yeah, sure send me a copy too if you'd be so kind. I'm not
100% sure, but I think I saw a similar routine a while back
either on one of the Amos CD's or an Amos disk mag!

Anyone else seen it to remind me?

So here's a reply...

Hi there,

Or just plainly put ... `don't want one' :-)

Yeah, look at Worms, Lemmings etc. All Amiga games ported to
PC and PSX too. It CAN be done and in the Worms example, with
Blitz basic...So yeh, a basic language can prove to be up to
the task no probs.

Take a look at Flight of The Amazon Queen - the files on disk
are Amos files! So Amos can produce great games, but like you
say Alastair, gfx don't draw themselves.

And I don't think all Amos games are 8 bit looking either, so
I'm with Alastair on this one too. Amos is great and I won't
have a word said against it.

Who does this guy think he is anyway?

Well said m8 :)

hehehehe. Well, what did ya really expect from the PC? Boring
boring boring. I dont know anyone who uses the PC for
creative reasons and certianly don't know any PC users who
have coded/released any games either! And that even includes
using Klick N Play and The Games Factory :)

> Programming on the AMIGA means it is more fun for me (and I
do it for fun!)

small way.

Yup, well said again. How very vry true.

> Now just stop trying to put everyone down doing something
they enjoy.

Yeah, we don't come to your work and tell you how to sweep
up! :-)

Piss off and go back to your professional stuff, we're happy
plodding along with Amos coz we enjoy it. If we didn't, do
you think we need you to tell us it's time to move on?

No chance, we have our own minds and if we weren't happy, we
would have moved long ago...

*Flame On!* ;D

    Hello Keith.

   I'm not sure, but if this is for taking snapshots of my stage then I
   have the solution.  I created a procedure which automatically
   generates a 32-color screen (8+8 dual-playfield + 16 color sprite
   palette) during my stage.  Just hit "s" for snapshot...

   I used it to generate a few snapshots months back and sent them to
   Mush (for marketing purposes).

   Anyway, if this is what you want, let me know...

AND you need to BUY an official license from SONY (at least you do for
programming for Nintendo - I'm not 100% sure about PSX)

Not only do you need a licence, but you also have to have to game approved
by Sony before you are allowed to market it!

Hello again!!!


Well, now that pretty much everyone on this list has aired their views =
on my comments, i just want to re-inforce a few issues:-

1.  I wanted feedback on how you feel and how open you all are to change
2.  I own 3 amigas of varying size and use them all to test my codes =
performance and how they operate=20
    under different memory configurations and hardware setup.
3. I code for fun myself on my A4000 and that includes my own modules =
and graphics, even though Im not=20
    the worlds greatest musician or artist.  =20
4. I AM an AMIGA enthusiast and have been since 1986
5. I have also used AMOS since "The Creator" was first released
6. I think very highly of both the AMIGA platform and AMOS, but on the =
otherhand Im also disappointed that
    after all these years, AMOS has not grown and the compiler hasn't =
been re-written
7. Would I write games for the PC, NO WAY !!! =20

So, there you have it, didn't mean to piss on anyones fires, that was =
not the intention.  Just remember there are so many people on this list =
that excel in varying areas, graphics, sound, coding etc...  are these =
people being used to their full extent ?

Im as interested as the next person to see some great quality games =
etc... come from this group as I know you are all keen, even if no money =
is involved (which is not the priority)=20

Dear all,
I've been trying to create some anims (of a human form) using Imagine 3.0 that
I got off a coverdisk many moons ago to no avail. Does anyone know where I can
buy a manual for this beast? I really need to know how to use bones to deform
the human object in a meaningful way.
All help greatfully received
Rod

CBATNAM is probably the first attempt at doing just that. You ought to try to

Each stage pushes the AMOS code to its fullest. We're in the home stretch. We
still need someone to convert the thx to mod format, and graphic artists might
still contribute. Keith can tell you what he needs from you.

Well.... the GUIComp Patch creates a new patched version of your compiler and
related files. It also create a patched verision of the amos.library.. the
gui.library used by the *GUI compiler only.*

The GUI compiler is useful if you want create true WB applications, since it
removes some AMOS problems, like unusefull patches, hacks, and activate the
possibility to run several AMOS programs togheter.

Where can I get these from?  And what all files do I need to use GUI?  I
have the Gui extension archive from the AMOS factory web page.  What
else is needed?  I am using AMOS Pro 2.0

Yes Pietro, what about those new AMOS logos? Did you (or your group) ever
decided on any one of the entries? If not, I have a few (about 9) I made
after the original deadline (rendered, 3D, on my PC. AHH!) that look
particularly cool and reflect almost any style you may want the new AMOS to
portray. If you want, I'll send them to you in a .zip (.bmp or .jpg?)

Keith, is there anything else you need from me? I can't recall if I sent my
MIB shots to you or not? If I didn't, tell me and I'll get them to you.

Btw, the site looks mucho cool. I have to say that that _black_ font on
that _blue_ background is horrific (I can't read it at all). Wouldn't mind
doing something about this would you, O Great and Busy One? hehe..

Also, I wanted to apologize, namely to Giark, for not being able to get in
my level when I originally planned, not to mention this final release. I
just didn't have the time and, with no time for optimizations and the extra
work for implementing the baddies I wanted, I just couldn't finish it.

However, I do hope everyone has liked and made much use of the art I've
submitted and the shots I've rendered. Shameless to say, without my PC, I
couldn't have done it!, and NONE of you would have a cool 3D Bubba! hehe

Urk, I invalidated my hard drive today, and have currently BARELY got
it back.  The backup routines aren't working, and it is ridiculously
fragile.

This is a public service announcement:

	Make a backup now !




(Yes it was the Cap'n Bubba drive.  Luckily the Cap seems unafected.)
It seems like my email hit the worst of it.  It went in a nasty way.
Anyone got any good disk tools that work with AFS ?

..ok, I fixed it.  Alright I confess, I used an Amiga to create the site, 
and just assumed a peecee would be able to handle it.

I hate when that happens.

Subject: [amos-list] is it worth learning amos?
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Skid Vis <skid@angelic.com>

Hi there, 

Here's the deal:

I've had AMOS for a long time, but I felt it was dying and pretty much
useless, plus I didn't know how to program. I really wanted to learn
something, and I was always told it's easier to learn to code on a PC..
because they don't offer Amiga programming classes on my side of Earth. So
I bought a PC and started taking classes on Visual Basic programming. I'm
glad I did.. I learned alot of "BASIC" stuff in the process. 
So here are my questions:
	Should I learn Amos Pro 2 or is 3 going to be a whole different thing?
	
All I have is Amos Pro 2 and the book to Easy Amos. 
	Could I learn AP2 with the easy amos book or is it too different?

Thanx!!

About my pages...... The Amos Factory pages will be moved to another site,
since now there is a new webmaster who help me with my site :) Now it looks
great and professional as it should be! Please again some days, and the pages
will be on-line. I'll transform my orginal pages into another important AMOS
project..... at the moment i can tell you the name only:  the Gnu Amos
Distillery :) Maybe you can image something 8)

Well... the problem with the logos is that i've not received nothing! oh...
i've just received a logo forwarded to me by Mush.... but nothing more. Adam,
your
logos are welcome! If there is someone who want create a new AMOS logo, do it!
and send me your artwork.

If i'll receive enough materials, i'll put them on my homepage, so you can
decide.

   Understandable... Europress dropped support and AMOS received
   some bad press (from major Amiga mags).  However, AMOS is a
   fine programming language and that is why loads of people 
   continue (or come back to) using it.

   When the Amiga first came out, many programmers found the
   concepts of the OS combined with learning C too much to handle
   and thus began the Amiga's reputation as a complicated machine
   to program.  Obviously, these days we have high level languages
   such as AMOS so that "hard-case" rep. is simply no longer true.

   I think the best way to learn is to pick up some books and
   dive right in.  I am a fully self-educated programmer, having never
   stepped inside a college in my life (well, I did visit a friend but you
   know what I mean).  

   Just mess around until you have mastered the basics and then
   you will be able to move on to more challenging projects.

   Use the AMOS version you have...  program every day until you
   understand exactly what is going on, why it is happening and how
   it is being done.  Once you have this level of understanding you
   will find that you can apply your skill to any language.  You see,
   all programming is relatively the same... there are always
   fundamental elements that must be included in a programming
   environment.  You might use DISPLAY(), PRINT "", printf(""), puts_,
   etc. but the important thing is that there is always a command to
   display information on the screen/window.

   Currently, I am using DBL at work in a mainframe environment, but
   I can easily duplicate my DBL work in AMOS, BLITZ, C/C++, etc. by
   relying on the fundamentals...  So, master the programming basics. 
   AMOS is a fantastic tool for doing this and I wish I had something
   like AMOS when I started programming (nearly 18 years ago on an
   old TI-99/4a - preC64). 

   In a way, I envy you... you are at the very beginning of your
   journey... a time filled with magic and mystery.

   Good luck and I hope some of this babbling helps...

AmosNG is called amos, and uses some of the same extensions, and probably the
same or at least similar command structure, so if you wanna use an amiga, why
not.

> All I have is Amos Pro 2 and the book to Easy Amos.

Yes you can.  It is 100% compatable with easy amos.  ...Going back is hard.

Ok, I really have fixed the Bubba web pages now, they should all work
well with internet exploder and netscrape, as well as other browsers.
The site is being regularly updated, and I'll probably be putting
progress reports online before long, so check back often !

Cap'n Bubba will now (probably) consist of *6* different levels, by
different authors, a lot of sound and graphics, hand drawn & raytraced,
and coded in amos.  Oh yeah, not to mention the game control program..

Work continues..   (I'm tired)

If you want to see the new graphics and sound on the website, the
address is:
	http://www.mirex.demon.co.uk/bubba/
or
	http://www.mirex.demon.co.uk/bubba/herobrau.html

Feel free to link to either URL with the banners provided on the links
page.  BTW, the starfield on the backdrop of one piccie is a REAL
starfield computed in earth orbit.  Don't say we don't spoil you.

Good point, the html in mails is a bad idea, as it just makes
it harder to read on a amiga.
