Sure, I never said it's impossible B-)

a string.

Ok, more possible? ;-)

PH> But it would be a pretty large project, don't you think?

No, I think it would be comparitively simple. All the program would need
to do is search for certain blocks of coding and merge them accordingly.
Surely this can't be that hard. I've written many similar programs
myself.

Once you (not necessaryly you ;) ) have written the main converting code,
it should be quite easy to keep adding blocks to replace.

I'm sure someone with enough knowledge in assembler could do it.

So is writing the whole thing in asm in the first place. :-b

Just a really,  really simple question (I've just started getting back   
into Amos) -

I want to read in an input from the keyboard and store it in a string.   
 No problem.  I then want to look in that string for certain words.

i.e.

INPUT : 'Hello I am fine today' and I want Amos to look for 'I am fine'

in hm english :

If 'Hello I am fine today' contains 'I am fine' print 'you are fine'
else print 'you are not fine'.

Any replies welcome > Thanks all.

Hello,

I've just received OS DevKit: IT'S GREAT!

I'm sorry for Andy, but it seems far better than Intuition extension.
It's made of over 630 REAL commands with a normal extension (slot 20), but
there also are a lot of extensions created to make programming easier.

The manual is in AmigaGuide format and isn't very good (available in French
and in English), but the whole package seems ok.
As soon as I can test it, I'll lee you more.

For now, let me enjoy it!


Bye

P.S.: BTW, Andy, I want to continue to be registered to your Intuition
extensions: these are very different, but now I'm on line: I'll tell you
more another time

Do you have:

Then visit:

	http://www-users.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~crux/uae.html

And get the Useable amiga emulator! You can then run Amos/AmosPro
on your unix machine (I've tested the emulator with WB3.0, Frontier
and a compiled AMOS program).

P.s. Although this sounds more unlikely than a certain extension
making AMOSpro run faster than C, I assure you it isn't a hoax.

Input A$
A$=Upper$(A$)
A=Instr (A$,"I AM FINE")
If A<>0
        ? "You Are Fine"
Else
        ? "You are not fine, oh I do feel so sorry for you, but"
        ? "we all have problems you know. Would you like to talk"
        ? "About this???"
End If


Should do it!!

This is an Instr() one again ie,

If Instr("Hello I am fine today","I am fine")

remeber to use Upper$() if you don't care about case problems ie,

If Instr(Upper(phrase$),"I AM FINE") 
If Instr(Upper(phrase$),Upper$(find$))

Instr$() returns the place of the find ie

place=Instr$("Paul","a")

would return '2'

Chearz!

Yep. You must compile the code, then chain it, with an exec command, or if
your compiler only produces one hunk, you can Pload the file, or insert it
into a procedure!

Hi,

I got some nice emails after I made the offer for a free copy of Sneech
and I must have sent out 20 or more reg copies. The only problem is that
2 of them have been returned un-delivered so if anyone ordered a copy
and didn't get it I'm sorry!!!!

If you are missing a copy post me at <paulb@sneech.demon.co.uk> and
I'll get another copy sent to you. If you could give me your fav.
email box address that would be good because it looks like the one on
return path didn't work. 

I'm sorry I don't have any specific names, and sorry for wasting the
amos-lists lime :)

Cheers,

Paul Burkey

Hi Everyone,

I wanted to alert you to what appears to be a scam ... a guy selling an
AGA extension in the UK, advertising in the UK mags.  Maybe this has been
covered here but I haven't seen anything yet.

advertising the extension for 10 UKP.  Some people including the editor
sent this guy the money and have not received anything, even though
they've reached him on the phone and got vague promises.

If anyone can shed any more light on this thing would you tell us what's
up?
-Chris.

You could use C (Or any language that supports it eg. Amiga E) to create a
shared library file, then write assembler stubs to be made to to Amos asm
procedures that extract the parameters from the A3 stack and call the library
routine, or use the LibCall function.

Subject: Knockout 2
Status: RO
X-Status: 

I'm currently programming Knockout 2, but I need some help. Not with
the programming but with ideas and music.

Does anyone have any (or could write) good music for Knockout 2, either
whilst playing, during the options screen or in the intro sequence.
Something like the music in Terminator 2 would do very nicely, I think.

Features in Knockout 2 currently includes :

- different vehicles
- name tags floating above the cars as you play
- friction control
- variable start circle size
- team games (play in pairs)
- 8 sets of controls, so 8 human players can play at once!
- play first to "n" wins
- save configuration setup
- brand new options menu

To come :

- different graphics for the platform depending on the friction setting
  eg ice, tarmac, gravel, etc.
- vehicle editor, where you can actually design your own vehicles.
  You'll only need to draw the car facing in one direction and the
  program does everything else for you.
- animated intro sequence (maybe)

Do you have other ideas? (don't suggest guns/powerups - it'd distract
from the simplicity of the game) ;-)

Many thanks, and sorry for the lack of AMOS content in this mail. ;-)

Thera are no upgrades available. We, Hannu and I, have done one upgrade
(v1.1) which has some new commands, but nothing very serious. Black
Legend concentrated on games and PC-stuff, so we decided not to make
upgrades. In fact, there are some other extensions, like EasyLife and
AFCAM, which have a lot of commands like CRAFT and we didn't like to
start compete with these, as we have to tackle with our studies too...

I checked out John Bintz' RPGEditor but haven't delved into it beyond
the sample game:

 It's interesting. What is that weird loader interface? I keep seeing it,
  like on the HERO 2600 clone on aminet.
 I think it would be better if you could create standalone executables
  instead of loading some script through a loader. Can you?
 Seems like a neat little cute game creator with good music. An unusual
  thing to have created entirely in AMOS. Was it?

Do you mean the bar graphs?  Sorry...I'm addicted to them...

If the files are small enough, I could cram them all into a single file, 
with some tricky programming.  I'll have to think about it.

I've been wanting a decent game creator, as I detest reprogramming 
everything for new games.  RPGs and adventures are the easiest, as there 
are very few moving parts, and by using an editor, I could standardize 
everything, and make upgrades a lot easier.  And, because Amos could 
compress images so well, it was the best choice for graphical 2D adventures.

One question:  How fast does it run?  What computer are you running it 
on, and is the animation smooth?  Its a bit jerky on my 68000.

I would like to incorporate a font into an AMOS file so I don't have to
worry if the user has that font. Outside of <groan> puuting the font in
the archive and enclosing a script file to install the font in user's
FONTS directory is ther a way to do this?

How much is an 1/8 page ad in Amiga Format and do they have classifieds? 

In this arcade style game I was working on I found that when I PRINTed
to update the score that it would slow the program down with an irritating
and unacceptable jerk in the motion of the bobs on-screen. Is there an
easy way around this?

Has anyone on the list written a pac-man style game; I would like to check 
out your source.

Different questions, same answer: Store all the letters as icons in an 
iconbank. Pasting icons onto the screen may also be faster than 
printing the hiscore.

You can mount a device that will look at a PC disk in your Amigadrives as 
if it were an Amigadisk and subsequently perform all functions (reading, 
writing) that you would do with an Amigadisk.

The OS from version 2.04 onwards comes with such a device driver for PC 
disks. Look in your manual for where to find it and how to use it.

If you don't have any of the modern OSes, check old Fish disks for 
something called MessyDos. It is a bit harder to install, but works 
virtually the same as the official driver.

Two things that you should watch out for: PCs usually handle only 
filenames that are 8 characters long and have an extension of 3 
characters. You knew that of course, but take care that your ftp-program 
doesn't mess things up. For instance, if you download 
Verynicegamepart1.lha and then Verynicegamepart2.lha, be sure the second 
doesn't overwrite the first (as the PC might turn it into Verynice.lha or 
Verynice.gam).
The other thing is that on most Amigas (except some A4000s) you cannot 
use High Density disks. Use DD/DS disks instead.

Good luck!

X-Status: 

I'm trying to write a game that uses paralax scrolling, with a forground and
background scrolling part.  I've tried using Dual playfield, but it has bugs
like when either screen hits a 16 pixel boundry, the other jerks really bad. 
Also 8 colours(actually 7 because colour 0 is transparent), is just not enough.

I've tried to use bobs, but this is way too slow and jerky.  One solution to
this would be to allow the foreground to be the screen and the background
be a bob, but there doesn't seem to be a way to put graphics over top of a
bob.  Is there a way to restrict a bob to only one colour (ie colour 0)?

Anyone have any ideas on how I might do this?

If someone could give me a real solution, I'd be more than happy to give credit
to them in the game.  Any help would be appreciated.

D0>  Well, no, but the program crashes and ends. 

The reason for this *must* be not enough memory. The game needs about 700
KByte of free memory. You should play it from harddisk and not from RAM:.

32 colours are used. 16 for the game figure and all the other objects and

It can't be run from NTSC as far as I know because the screen uses
vertically 256 lines (that's PAL) and in NTSC AMOS cuts every line
from 201 to 256.
Anyone knowing how to stop AMOS in cutting these lines? If there's a
possibility I'll release a patch.

I thought we had sorted this out ages ago? Maybe this article has been
delayed for weeks but everyone should already know that the AGA extension
is now only available from F1 Licenceware for under 4 UKP!!! So anyone
who wants to send 10 UKP to that guy when F1 have had it for a few months
now for under 4 UKP can please themselves. 

We've also had many an article discussing the said AGA extension with
steve bye from F1 so if anyone out there still doesn't know where to get
this extension from and also the AMOS Pro Compiler get in touch with
F1 licenceware now!!!!

I am programming a game in AMOS which involves the use
of the scroll command, and I am not impressed by the
smoothness or speed. Is there any extension commands that
handle this better? I know that the Turbo extension
has a multi blit command for stuff like this, but I
don`t know how to use it! Can anyone help?

And also when I use the SpriteCol() command to check
for a collision and then the Col() command to find
the colliding sprite, it sometimes gives the wrong
sprite number!! Any reason for this?

Just found this list and subscribed to it, and wanted to tell fellow Amos 
enthusiasts about the project I've been working on for five years:

Cyberspace Communication Base (current Amos code size: 400K + 180K)

Description:
An easy-to-use Fidonet point program for "e-mail" and "newsgroup" use,  
with built-in mailer, word processor (built-in TypeNice and communicates 
with Ispell for spellchecking), and of course the reader. (A "point" 
program is basically like a lousy offline-reader except it is much 
better in all ways, not ugly, and doesn't have to be configured. Well, 
not this point program, anyway).

The many features unique among Fidonet "point" programs, include 
single-click "areafixing", global fidouserlist creation, automatic 
reply-link repairs and much, much, much more.

The huge number of bugs in Amos Pro 2.00 has been a major problem but I 
hope to find the time to release this as shareware soon (code won't be 
released - sorry). Hopefully there will be some people that won't be 
scared off by the Amos look.

Anyone here on that network? If so I'm willing to change the name. But
only if there are a few.  We might not even be able to change the name
maybe another group could be set up and all articles can be cross
posted to both? Then we'd get double (sort of) the chance of people
getting in the group.

Anyone else having problems accessing it? Well you all missed a loverly
picture of Tori AMOS that someone posted :)

The easy way is to only update it when the score is updated and use the

If you like game creators, you should try out my Point And Click Adventure
Creator when I eventually finish it. Everything you need to create graphic
adventures with hardly any programming involved at all. Almost all of it
is mouse controlled.

Does anyone have any code to copy a file (any type of file) without having
to resort to using the Exec("") command?

I don't have any money so please don't send me vasts amounts of mail about
if i buy so-and-so extension theres a command on there that does just that.

I know this is possible without an extension as the Diskmanager program
copies files - but i can't "rip" out the code.

Any code?

actually I'm already using a rainbow in the background of my background! (for
a total of three layers :) incidentally anyone know why the background screen
also uses its first colour as transparent? the manual says you get 8 colours
for the background, but becuase of this you only get 7, becuase this
transparent colour is now actually colour 0 for the front screen and makes
this colour usless on the back screen.

I need some help for the following bit of code. I've stripped it down to
the bare bones so it's easier and smaller to fix. I'm hopeing that some one
here might be able to help.
The finished game has raytraced graphics. I just can't fix up this bit :-(

The idea is that the ship (you) must fly through the circles (flight path).
I have stars as well, but removed them so that it doesn't confuse the
issue. I just can't get the circles to look evenly spaced or in the correct
bob order.

I have a problem compiling software with Amos 1.35 + Compiler,
with my 030 card active (blizzard) Amos runs in interpreter
mode, the compiler works, compiles the file, but when the file
is run the machine crashes with an illigal instruction. 

If I turn the accelorator off (hold down the number 2 on boot
up) then the programs compile correctly. I've tried this with
lots of software I've written.

even 

Print "plop"
Repeat
Until False


Is there a patch to the acmp software that makes the compiler
happy with my 030/50 board. Oh I've also tried it from the
shell as well - same result.


Thanks if anyone can help - 

Does the Amos Pro compiler do this? I've got Amos pro from a
cover disk but not the compiler.

Cheers

Let's try:

INNAME$=Fsel$("")
OUTNAME$=Fsel$("")
BUF=1024
Open In 1, INNAME$
FL=Lof(1)
Close 1
If FL<BUF Then BUF=FL
Reserve as Work 5, BUF
'' Following is not real code. Consult your manual for how to do this
' Bload INNAME$, 5, BUF
' Bappend OUTNAME$, 5
'' You could use a stringbuffer instead, reading with A$=Input$(1,BUF).
'' If you have got enough memory, you could probably try something like:
' INNAME$=Fsel$("")
' OUTNAME$=Fsel$("")
' Open In 1, INNAME$: Reserve As Work 5, BUF: Close 1
' Bload INNAME$,5
' Bsave OUTNAME$,5

Good luck,

Hi ! 

I need some nice sprites, but I realised that I deleted all the one I had.

So, does anyone still have the sprites collection that was given with 
AMOS the Creator (with spaceships, monsters, canons, and other stuff) ?

I yes, could you send me an uuencoded version of this disk (DMS format 
would be perfect). 

Thank you !

Hello All,

    I was wondering if any one else out there who has IntOS (I got mine 
from Amiga Shopper) has experienced problems running it on an Amiga 1200 
with the Blizzard III board. My copy will not run, or only EXTREMLY 
slowly with the board plugged in, but runs perfectly with it removed. Is 
there anybody out there that can explain this or even knows how the fix 
it without having to remove my board to run programs with IntOS. Help Please!

Full Setup:
AmosPRO V2.0
Amiga 1200 WB3.0
Blizzard III 50Mhz 68030+MMU 68882 Fpu
8 Meg Fast Ram

Thanks in advance

Chris

Hi, I don't have a manual infront of me right now(so i can't give an 
example with an accurate syntax) but I reckon that 
you could open the file your trying to copy as a sequential text file 
load into a string and save with a different file name.

Pseudo Code Example (BEWARE the syntax of this code is probably 
 very inaccurate)

' *** Copy file ***
' ** Load the file **
' Open the source file on channel one for input(Reading)
open in "NAME_OF_SOURCE_FILE",1

' Read the contents into a string variable
DATA$ = input(lof(1))

' Close the file
Close 1

' ** Save the file **
' Open the destination file on channel one for output
open out "NAME_OF_DESTINATION_FILE",1

' Write the contents
print DATA$,1

' Close the file
Close 1

End

P.S. The syntax of the above code is probably not right, look the 
commands up in an AMOS manual to get the exact syntax (I don't have a 
manual handy right now)

PLAYTESTING
** R.A.Lawrence and anyone else interested ** I can mail a compiled 
copy of my latest game to anyone who wants to playtest it.

GRAPHICS
** RCurrie ** I've downloaded your iff files but i haven't had a look 
at them yet, I'll do so as soon as possible. Are you interested in 
creating graphics for RPGs?

From what I've heard 'F1 Licenceware' sell the compiler for 20 pounds, 
I don't have the address on me right now though.

Someone named Alex was heard to ask:

"Until then is there anything in particular that you wanted to know about
coding games that use the PACMAN style of gameplay."

Yeah, what do you use for the little dots that the funny mouth man eats,
bobs, sprites or background graphics. I've found that simply PLOTting the
dots is too slow when you have to erase 'em as he eats 'em and also you 
run into problems when you have about 80 little bobs onscreen.

Cori Skagen was asking about solutions to some problems he was having
with dual playfields and parallax scrolling and such. I can't really help
with that but I should point out:

There is an amos program which is a knockoff of Shadow of the Beast. I
remember seeing screen shots about the time I first bought amos. So if you
can find that code you might be able to learn from it.

I've always done like this:

Open In 1,"Name of Sourcefile"
LONG=Lof(1) : Rem  'Get length of open file'
Close 1
'
Reserve as Work 9,LONG
Bload "Name of Sourcefile",9 : Rem 'Load file into bank 9'
A=Start(9) : Rem Memoryadress of bank 9'
Bsave "Name and path of Destinationfile",A To A+LONG
Rem 'Saves the contents of bank 9 as destinationfile'

I hope this helped!

, but at least it doesn't have the color restriction of Dual Playfield.

BTW, my vote for the best AMOS engines to do specific jobs are:

Pac Man type maze - Pac Man Clone by David May
Hand-to-hand combat like St. Fighter - Space Fighter by MAC Club
Overhead Vert Scroll like Battle Sqdn - Galaz from Pro Comp Extras disk
Dungeon Halls walkthrough like Doom - 3D Dungeon by G. Crook
Platform mapping game - Charlie Chimp on Mega-MAC-Map
Horiz Scene Scroll - Dizzy II on MAC

No use re-inventing the wheel :-)

	If you want to copy a file without using exec functions, the easiest
way is to create a small buffer in a bank or somewhere like that(fast ram would
be best), open the file for reading, open another for writing. Read in <size of
buffer> characters into the buffer and then write <size of buffer> characters
to the output file. Use the Input$ command to read in the characters so that
you
don't run into problems with unprintable control characters. A buffer of 512
bytes is probably a good size(that is a single sector, 1 side I believe)
because the diskdrive has buffered reading and writing and that buffer will
automatically read in chunks of a certain size... basically it will optimize
the speed and memory. Once the EOF marker has been set then the copy has
finished.

Uh oh, not a very good idea... Strings can handle only upto 65536 bytes,
and Amos string handling is really crap... and slow!

A better way would be something like this:

reserve as work 10,70000

open in 1,"sourcefile"
fl=lof(1)
open out 2,"destinationfile"

do

if fl<65536
	sload 1,start(10),fl : 
        ' I'm not sure was the syntax: sload channel,adr,length
	' (check out the manual)
	ssave 2,start(10),fl
	exit 1
else
	sload 1,start(10),65536
	add fl,-65536
	ssave 2,start(10),65536
end if

loop

close 1
close 2
erase 10

or if the files are short (under 100000 bytes or so) you could just

open in 1,"sourcefile":l=lof(1):close 1
reserve as work 10,l
bload "sourcefile",start(10)
bsave "destinationfile",start(10),start(10)+l
erase 10

or if you have AMCAF:

wload "sourcefile",10
wsave "destinationfile",10
erase 10

(or was there a File Copy command too in the amcaf extension? ;-) )


Hope these bits of code work!

Why do you need 80 Bobs? You can just use small blocks for the white 
dots. Then when pacman eats them either Cls that small part of the screen 
or Paste Block(Bob) a blank background piece.

Hello.  I finally got around to joining the list.  At this time there was
no mail from the list waiting for me so I'm going to jump right in with a
brief background about myself as well as posing a few questions for you
more experienced coders.  I will try to be brief and apologize now if the 
text is too lengthy.

I'm a computer science major at York University, Toronto, Canada.

My current setup is as follows: 2000 w/1M chip & WB 2.04
                                Gvp 030-33 w/8M
                                52M Hd :(  (I hoping to get a Gig)
                                AmosPro V2 w/compiler
                                following extensions:   EasyLife
                                                        Craft (CU Amiga)
                                                        Jd4.x (just got 5.x)
                                testing the following:  Amcaf
                                                        Powerbobs

Interests: most things sci-fi & fantasy related, programming, avid comic 
collector (mostly Wildstorm/Image).

Top 5 tv shows: X-Files, Babylon 5, ST:DS9, Reboot (incredible 3D 
animation), Xena.

Favourite authors: Salvatore (TSR's Dark Elf Trilogy), Crighton (any of 
his sci-fi books)

Current project: RPG game master's aid.  I'd seen several adverts for PC 
versions and none for the Amiga, so I finally decided to put one 
together.  I will allow the GM to design maps with full area 
descriptions, look-up tables, dice value generator for any die type, map 
tile editor, character dbase.  A lot of stuff eh.  I keep revising it, 
for the past 1 1/2 years, but hopefully I will be able to release it this 
summer.  I hope there's a market for it.  Suggestions for features would 
be greatly appreciated. 

Now for some questions:
1) Do all ECS machines come with 1M chip as standard?  I think so, but am 
not completely sure.

2) Is the Jd extension shareware?  I can't read German (I had to use an 
English/German dictionary to translate the command syntax) and cannot see 
anything that might be stating shareware fees.  I have checked the 
English docs in the current version.

3) Is there anyway for the screen copy command to make colour 0 
transparent?  Amcaf does but only for individual bitplanes (I could be 
wrong though).  I have tried the various mask combinations to no avail.  
I think its because it doesn't use blitter area A.  Currently I'm 
grabbing selecting areas with  the get sprite command, then pasting over 
selected areas.

4) Is it possible to save a portion of the screen to a bank without 
compression? I'm asking this because it would be faster on '000 machines 
than if I used packed images which I am currently doing.  I cannot 
degrade to '000 anymore at home.

I have a few more questions but I think I'll keep them for latter.  I'm 
getting close to that 4K limit.  I'll keep my postings short in the 
future if there are any complaints.

Even easier...

Simply set the bob redrawing to clear the background, which is not only
faster, but it allevaites the whole problem (unless you have a complicated
background!)

I expect it's possible to save portions of screens to banks by lots
of Mem Copy commands, but it's beyond me. Besides, what's wrong with
just packing them?!

X-Status: 

	Hello,
		First thanks to all who have written me in the past
	my mailer has been on the ropes lately so I've been able
	(that's unable) to respond to many letters, if yours was 
	one I apologize and will got through my files to find
	responses and follow up on them.  
		Next, I have recently discoverd the marvels
	of Physic/Logic Screen swapping, something which 
	the AmosPro and 1.3 manuals leave rather vague. 
	At any rate, the code I've written does this,
	creates two screens, one small one big, hides
	the big screen, double buffers the small screen
	now I channel all bob and sprite activity to the
	big screen, and scroll about it by swapping
	a chunk of it into the small screen using
	the Screen Copy and Logic Physic commands.
	Is this the rright way to go about doing it??
	It seems to yield very smooth scrolling and a 
	lot of speed, but my real question is this,
	Does this method save me any memory?  I know
	a fair chunk is saved in that only the 
	little chunk is double buffered but that's
	not enough, if I want to create really big
	level ect. I'll need to create a very big 
	Big screen, if this screen still takes up
	alot of chip ram this simply won't be possible,
	if it can reside in Fast, I'm better but still
	not perfect, since a very big level (say
	30-50 screens) will still consume way too 
	much memory.  Al of this leads me to 
	conclude that their must be a better way,

I meant pretty large projects if you'd like to have some serious gain 
from it. A lot of miscellaneous optimizations must be done to actually 
"see" the speed incresement. (sorry my English is a bit rusty today ;-) )
I mean some calculation optimizations won't speed up most programs a 
lot... Most programs use graphics which is a weak point in amos (too slow
for serious effects), and you cannot optimize these...

Sure, it's not hard to do, but to make the programs significantly faster
by just optimizing the calculations and the stuff.....

Sure, but it's not neccessary in most cases. You can have x2-10 speed 
improvement with just a small amount of machine code. Usually my machine
code procedures are only about 10-30 assembler instructions, and the speed
increasement is incredible! IMO

With amos + some machine code you can actually do very well, and it isn't
at all hard when you now the basics of machine code programming. IMO
But if you want to optimize your programs, you should first try to improve
the *technique* not the actual commands used. Then if you need some extra
speed use assembler. B-)

But I agree with you that this kind of automatic optimization program 
would be very useful and an easy way (after the optimizator is finished)
to give some extra speed to your programs.

If you or someone else starts this project, I'd like to wish you good luck
(and good nerves when disassembling the mad French's code)!

I'm not sure if this is possible with Screen Copy but the idea is
to use blitter channel A for the source, B for the mask and D as
destination. Then use D=A and B blitter operation.

This may come as a surprise to you, but there is something called RPG 
outside the realm of computers (so now you know what the off button is 
for). If you play RPGs with just people, someone, called the master (or 
Dungeon Master, or ...) has to take care of the administrative tasks. A 
lot of these tasks cannot be automated, but some can. For instance, it 
would be usefull to have a rules database handy, and character and items 
databases. Normally, the master has to look these up in large books, 
which takes time and that may distract from the gameplay.

TG (I forgot your name): Something I always felt would be useful is a 
guard-tracker. Certainly if you automate the mapbuilding, this shouldn't 
be too hard. A guardtracker keeps track (as the name implies) of where 
the bad guys are. These need not necessarily be guards, but can be any 
NPC that follows some kind of route. I have designed a very small routine 
that does this. It reads strings of the type:
"1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 7 8 9 L"

And interprets them as:
-Stay the first three rounds in room number 1.
-The next ten rounds, visit room 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9 in that order.
-Start over again with the first action.

I know it's horribly simple, but it would seem effective to me. Of course 
you will want to implement something like if the bad guys are in hearing 
range of your adventurers, then they will leave their route and go and track 
the adventurers.

Good luck with your program.

  Well, just for reference:  In my Columns game, I use an assembly routine
to check the board for rows of three identical blocks after each piece is
dropped.  That routine basically consists of a couple of nested loops and
a bunch of comparisons of array elements.  I initially wrote an AMOS
version, just for testing, and while I never did any actual speed
comparisons, the increase in speed when switching to the assembler version
seemed to be on the order of a factor of ten.

The better way (and only way unless you have Gigabytes of ram :) ) is to
draw part of the map as you scroll. The actual map definition is stored
in an array or memory bank. This tends to take loads of CPU time,
and as of yet, I don't think anyone's managed to get it to work in 1/50
of a second.

However, I have. It requires the Turbo Plus extension and the icons
(tiles) have to be 32x32 pixels in size, but apart from that, it's very
fast. I'll upload it to aminet just as soon as I fix a tiny bug that
seems to occur very rarely.

Is the Amos Pro 3d released / will it ever be released?

Has the Amos support from Europress software really ended?

drawing outside screen)?

Any plans on AGA-extension?


I have coded in Amos(pro) for about 3 years now, and i'm trying to learn=20

Why not use the built in Get bob command? This cuts a portion of the 
screen and saves it into the bob bank as a bob.

I can never think which parts of a program to convert to assembler. My

IMO, I do write optimized code, it's just AMOS dragging it's heals. ;-)

I'd do it if someone told me what parts can be optimized and to what.

I also need a decent disassembler. I can't seem to get Devpac3 to create
re-compilable code, and although ADis (from aminet) almost does it, it
doesn't quite work. Does anyone have any ideas?

I tend to use maps, which is the only real way of saving memory. The map
then decompresses to a screen slightly bigger than my playscreen, but not
much bigger. Then I use a similar trick of copying the right section onto
the little screen, and that's it!

I've had a great deal of trouble compiling, my software with Amos 1.35
+ compiler (I have an A1200 with Blizzard 030/50 4mg) the compiler
actually works, but introduces problems in the compiled code.

When I try to run the compiled code, it hangs/crashes with an illigal 
instruction error. If I turn off the Blizzard when rebooting, the compiled
program runs fine... I can also reboot again with the 030 active and the
software is quite happy to work with the 030....It just does'nt like compiling
with 030....

arhagarhgrahhh!

This is starting to piss me off!

I've got a copy of Amos Pro (from a cover disk!) but not the compiler!
does anyone have a Blizzard 030 IV 50 and Amos pro that works?

Also how would I go about adding some Tmapping + C2P commands to Amos
I need a command to render a x, y, z,  poly to a C2P buffer and a number 
of times, and issue a C2PDraw command (simmilar to bob draw!)

I can probably get good C2P code that uses blitter passes etc.... But 
I don't know any Tmap source.

Or maybee even something that would go with amos 3d....

Cheers fellow Amos coders.......

Oh I am also running in dblpal workbench, if it makes any difference.

Well Ben if it is up to the standard of your other efforts I certainly look
forward to having a go with it. A suggestion: make sure the RPGs you can 
create run as stand-alones. I imagine this will be difficult for an AMOS
only programmer but we all get by with a little help from our friends.

Or maybe you can swing that yourself. Dunno.

I remember Electronic Arts put out a creator for their Bard's Tale system
but I have yet to see a single game from it. Though I'd like to, anyone?

The only things of this variety I've seen are those cruddy, jerky efforts
made possible through SEUCK. Though maybe even those are OK on 68020 plus,
dunno.

This on your Tetris style game, if I understand?! Who cares if you can get
a ten fold increase on a @#$#@ Tetris game. Compiled amos is %100 up to this
task.

Tell us about something speedy you've done in assembler that _couldn't_ be
done in AMOS if you want us to be impressed Andy!

Yes, i've got Amos 3d working with APro 1.12, but will there be a Pro 3d=20

Highly illegal, but still very useful if you know what you are doing: self
modifying code. Or what about specific 68010+ instructions? 

I admit, these examples are far-fetched, but they are still things you can't
do with compiled AMOS programs... Whether they're speedy is another matter.
Besides, compare the speed of a compiled AMOS-demo with that of a `true'
democoder: you'll have to admit that the true demos are very often much
smoother in movement than their AMOS counterparts.

Incorrect. The new A4ks (the AT ones) have only DD drives!

Yes, and there's no workaround because when you insert a HD disk, the
drive is set to half the speed as normal by hardware. There's no way to
change it within the OS.

this, extension that. Great! But there seem to 
be millions (OK, tens) of extensions for AMOS.
 - Which one does what and is it share/freeware?
 - AGA-extension: does it give me AGA on AMOS? 
   and can it be used be non-extension users 
   after compiling? (and yes, I own a 1200)
 - Turbo-Plus / AMCAF / JD...something/ PowerBOBs: 
   does it enhance AMOS in speed and utility? Is 
   there a comparison somewhere?
 - Which extension is best suited for strategy
   games and 'non-graphic' simulations (that is:
   simulations of bargaining, gaming as in the
   university language, NOT flight simulators
   or racing sims)?
Could you pro's start a 'discussion'-comparison 
about this subject? And to the programmers of these 
extensions: no comments yet please, I could use 
some objectivity. (comment when someone lies objectively)

Thanks!

Sorry about the confusion regarding my rpg aid.  I should have mentioned 
that it applied to non-computer rpgs.  I'll make sure my postings are 
clearer in the future.

I just installed Turbo1.9 last night.  It's an improved version of the 
Craft Turbo gien away with CU Amiga.  I highly recommend it.  I've also come 
to the conclusion that the Jd lib extension is free (download it! It's 
very useful).

when I asked about storing screen graphics, C.Jackson wrote:
> Why not use the built in Get bob command?
Because bobs use 3x the memory as compared to icons.  Packed images use 
even less but you get a slight delay during unpacking which is why I am 
worried about performance loss on '000 machines.  I'm still deciding 
between the later two or maybe a combination of both now that I have the 
Turbo extension, but thanks for the input.

Q: I would like to insert some asm code into my progam but the routine 
would require me to call some Amos routines such as Screen copy.  How 
would I go about calling them and where can I find out the parameter 
requirements as well as what register to put them in?  Would this code 
still be relocatable since I'm assuming a jump would be issued?

Before I finish, I'd just to compliment the author of Knights for 
creating an excellent game.

With a graphic adventure, it would be virtually impossible to put it all
in one file as it can be spread across several disks. However, the PACAC
compiler puts everything on to disk (in a logical order to avoid excessive
disk swapping) so it will load and run automatically.

Subject: Optimisation tips
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Here are a few optimisation tips for those of you trying to squeeze that
little bit more speed out of code. With the follow examples, the speed
increase may not be noticable, but they will all make it that little bit
faster.

Note : Some of these speed increases only work when compiled!

1. Don't use Sgn(n), use n<0 and n>0 instead.

   Eg.
      Don't use :
         If Sgn(n)=-1 Then blah blah
         If Sgn(n)=1 Then blah de blah
      Use this instead :
         If n<0 Then blah blah
         If n>0 Then blah de blah

2. For your most used array of 8 (or less) elements, use Dreg() instead of it.

   Eg.
      Don't use :
         Dim n(7)
         For a=0 to 7:Print n(a):Next a
      Use this instead :
         For a=0 To 7:Print Dreg(a):Next a

3. Use Abs(n)<v instead of n>-v and n<v.

   Eg.
      Don't use :
         If n>-5 and n<5 Then blah
      Use this instead :
         If Abs(n)<5 Then blah

4. The obvious one : Whenever possible use powers of 2 when multiplying
   or dividing.

   Eg.
      Don't use :
         n=a*30
      Use this instead :
         n=a*32

5. Another obvious one : Predefine as much as possible.

   Eg.
      Don't use :
         Repeat
            If Sqr(x*x+y*y)=10 Then blah blah blah
         Until Something
      Use this instead :
         xmax=Maximum value of x : ymax=Maximum value of y
         Dim QUICKSQR(xmax,ymax)
         For x=0 to xmax
            For y=0 to ymax
               QUICKSQR(x,y)=SQR(x*x+y*y)
            Next y
         Next x
         Repeat
            If QUICKSQR(Abs(x),Abs(y))=10 Then blah blah blah
         Until Something

6. Get yourself a fast extension, such as AMCAF or Turbo Plus.

7. Use < and > instead of <= and >= whenever possible.

   Eg.
      Don't use :
         If n<=10 Then blah
      Use this instead :
         If n<11 Then blah

8. Don't do stuff like If n=True, If n=False, or If n<>0

   Eg.
      Don't use :
         If a=True or b=False or c<>0 Then blah blah
      Use this instead :
         If a or Not(b) or c Then blah blah

9. Obvious one : Never use floating points. Use integers multiplied by
   a power of 2.

   Eg.
      Don't use :
         x#=x#*1.5
         Plot x#,100
      Use this instead :
         x=x*(3*128) : Rem Same as x=x*(1.5*256)
         Plot X/256,100

Well I hope they're of use to someone. Please feel free to add new ones or
disagree with these. ;)

Handy list. Maybe we all should try and add to it and then you could 
upload it to Aminet!

I assume the value of the elements may not be larger than 255?

I heard a rumour once that comparissons should be avoided as much as 
possible. Is this true, and if so, how do you avoid them?

As I told Martijn Wehrens through private e-mail, I have actually very 
little experience with RL RPGs (and none with the virtual ones). I have 
been master a few times in Het Oog des Meesters, the Dutch version of 
Das Schwarze Auge.

Of course a computerised book of rules should be just as exact or loose 
as a paper one would be. The fact that you store the rules or whatever in 
a computer instead of in a book doesn't mean that the nature of the rules 
have to change. If you and your GM are used to winging it then do so, 
despite the medium the rules are stored in. 

I feel however that if you want easy access to something, a computer can 
be handy in some cases. The part of the rules was of the top of my head 
though. What I think might be handy is to store objects and Non-Playing 
Characters (NPCs) in a database. These have often some special qualities 
that you need to know, and so it would be easy to retrieve them by typing 
in the name of the object or NPC instead of leafing through a pile of 
books.

I specifically mentioned a guard-tracker in my previous post, as that is 
something that I miss even with my limited experience of RPGs. Of course, 
as master you can always introduce a guard whenever you want, and the 
players will never notice the difference. But I am the kind of master 
that doesn't want everything to be in his control. So when players stay a 
little too long in one place, they seriously risk getting damaged, even 
when I don't want them to.

I'm currently reprogramming the AI in Knockout 2, where the computer
cars turn round to head for the centre of the circle, but I have run
into a problem.

There are two angles, one for the current direction (called CANG) and
one for the direction it should be pointing in to get to the centre
of the circle (called DANG).

How can I get it to tell me the quickest way to rotate from angle
CANG to DANG. ie which direction to rotate in.

It's not a RPG editor. It's a graphic adventure creator, for making
games like Monkey Island, Beneath a Steel Sky and Flight of the
Amazon Queen.

Good idea! I'll take a note of any added.

As far as I know, the data registers can hold any value an array.

BC> [snip]
BC> 
BC> I heard a rumour once that comparissons should be avoided as much as

This is true as they are quite slow, but it's not easy.

One suggestion I have is this. Instead of something like this :

   Procedure _SOMETHING
      If c=1
         code1
      Else If c=2
         code2
      Else If c=3
         code3
      Else If c=4
         etc...
      Endif
   End Proc

You can do :

   Procedure _SOMETHING
      Gosub 0+c
      Pop Proc
      '
      1 Rem code for If c=1
      code1
      Return
      '
      2 Rem code for If c=2
      code2
      Return
      '
      3 Rem code for If c=3
      code3
      Return
      '
      etc...
   End Proc

BUT, I think this is only efficent if there are a lot of comparisions.

I've a working texture mapping engine in amos, not quite fast yet, but I'll
be optimizing it with some machine code routines.

Have you seen My3dEngine (aminet: demo/aga/my3dengine.lha) ?
(this isn't actually a texturemapping engine but a raycasting engine)

	True, it depends what type of thing everyone wants to do.  AMOS is pretty
well suited for a GM aid development however.  I'm still waiting to see one
that is worth using however :-)

    If you can yes.  Then if you do this use bit shifting instead!  This will
make things evebn quicker.  ie. *2 = Bit shift left by 1
                                *4 = Bit shift Left by 2
                                /8 = Bit shift right by 3
                                etc.

    Yep.  You can actually decide what sort of precision you want in your
decimal places and then multiply them out.  For example, if you decide on just
2 point accuracy, you can multiply all your values by 100 and then do the
calculations.  When you have the results simply divide by 100 to get the
required result.

    Good stuff!   I cant think of anything more at this stage.

    Hi to everybody!
    
        Finally i have joined amos-list so i want say HELLO
        to everyone who got this message.
        
        I'm a student of Technical University of Szczecin 
        (Ocean Technic not Informatic profile).
        Currently on sixth semester.
        
        I'm using Amiga 1200, 4MB Fast, 850HD and of course
        AMOSPro 2.0 + some extensions.
        
        Last week i heve uploaded to Aminet my two programs
        and two procedures taken from these programs.
        There are:
        
            biz/dbase/Liga.lha - for soccer matches
            game/think/Puzle.lha - 10x8 game + converter + xpk mods ..
            
            dev/amos/isms.lha - how to use max of memory to 
                                kepp max of screens from Liga
                                
            dev/amos/gtt.lha - how to reads tooltypes whithout
                               calling to the system routines.
                               
        If you would, I want you to get these programs and say
        what do you think. I will be very gratefull.
        
        If you have no time then tell me so i can send to you files.

Just to point out - this does *not* store values in the processor registers - 
Dreg()
is simply an internal array of the main internal AMOS data structure. Also, it 
may be
overwritten if you use machine node procedures. If may still be faster than 
normal
arrays though - I haven't tested.

I don't think the AMOS compiler is that smart - and the interpreter definitly 
isn't.
Best to use the bit shift operations.

Using the Def Fn and Fn statements may also be faster (Although not as faster 
as
building a table).

This will only speed things up where an extension command replaces an internal
command with a faster one - Easylife & AMCAF will do this for many string 
operations.

If this really is an optimisation, then the AMOS compiler is even more stupid 
than I
thought - the MC68000 family of processors have both BLT and BLE instructions 
which
execute equally fast.

But ONLY do this if you are sure a,b and c are boolean values. Not simply 
bitflips
an integer so Not -1 is 0, but Not 2 is $FFFFFFFE. There is a speed difference 
between using True/False and -1/0 but I can't remember which is faster. I 
think it
was the True/False.


Some more....

10. Use assembler procedures for inner loops.

11. Use 'copper off' to disable the screen while doing intense communication. 
The copper
then stops stealing clock cycles from the processor (Unlke Multi No and such 
instructions,
this really does work).

12. Move invarient statement outside loops (Standard optimsing compiler stuff) 
e.g. 

Repeat
   If x < a * 2 then ....
Until something

If rest of the loop does not modify a,  this can become:

temp=a*2
Repeat
   If  x < temp then...
Until something


A long time ago I wrote an optimiser for AMOS programs, but it was unreliable 
- and I
could never figure out why. I'll see if I can find it.

Wow.. i'm having speed problems doing linevectors in amos, but i guess=20
those assembler parts will help it..

Nope, hoing to check it out.

Btw, do you know lots about 3D-programming? I'm a great flight simulator=20

I have a question regarding the AP Save.. command.
My problem is that I only want to save a certain range of banks but the 
Save command only saves 1 or all of them.  Is there anyway around this.  
Perhaps someone could explain how the Save command determines whether a 
bank is to be saved.

One way to approach this is to imagine a 360 degree compass with the 
car in the centre. The DANG is the angle from the centre of this 
circle to the centre of the board
(use angle=arctan(opposite/adjacent)). 
Make sure this is converted into the correct angle for the `compass`.

Do the same for finding CANG but using the vertical axis as the angle 
rather than the centre of the board.

To determine the shortest distance, I think this could work (though I 
think there maybe a more efficient way):

If DANG<>CANG : Rem no change needed if already in correct direction
    Rem find number of degrees between two angles
    If DANG>=CANG
        CLOCKWISE_GAP=DANG-CANG
    Else
        CLOCKWISE_GAP=CANG-DANG
    Endif
    
    Rem choose which way to go
    If CLOCKWISE_GAP<360-CLOCKWISE_GAP
        <rotate clockwise procedure>
    ELSE
        <rotate anticlockwise>
    ENDIF
ENDIF

e.g. DANG=315, CANG=90, CLOCKWISE_GAP is 225,
CLOCKWISE_GAP>360-CLOCKWISE_GAP - Therefore turn anti-clockwise.
e.g. DANG=5, CANG=100, CLOCKWISE_GAP IS 95
CLOCKWISE_GAP<360-CLOCKWISE_GAP - Therefore turn clockwise.

I hope this has helped (E-Mail me if clarifications are needed).

Yes, I read in the AP manual that it simply transfers from the internal
AMOS array in the data registers just before m/c procs. Anyway, it is
still slightly faster.

The AP compiler turns powers of 2 stuff into lsl and lsrs. Or, at least
that's what it says in the manual. It seems to work with my programs.

The compiler *should* automatically do that. ;-)

Is this what you mean :

   Def Fn _SIN(a)=Sin(a)
   Print Fn _SIN(a)

is faster than :

   Print Sin(a)

???

Better to multiply by 128 (2^7) so it will be optimised furthur when
compiled.

Yes they're all PD, from dearly departed AMOS clubs, except Galax on the
Pro Compiler Extras disk I suppose, but can you imagine Europress caring
if anyone adapts some code from there? ... now that they've washed their
hands of AMOS? 
The club disks all say each whole disk issue is not PD, but the individual
progs in the disks are PD.  They aren't compiled and the source is there. 
I don't know if they are on a net site anywhere, but if you pay for
postage and a disk I'd be glad to send them.

If you want a second opinion on how good they are, ask Greg Cox, I've sent
them to him recently:

I am assuming you want to calc the shortest rotation angle from CANG to
DANG.  If this is the case you could try:

	RANG=CANG-DANG
	If RANG>180 then RANG=360-RANG

This should give you the smallest rotation angle of the possible 2.

The compiler for AP v2 will convert power of 2 multiplications to lsl 
format.  At least that's what the documentation says.


Bug Report:
	I'd also like to report a bug in Jd Lib.
The Jd Distance function subtracts an extra 1 if the differance is a 
multiple of ten.
ie.	X=Jd Distance(1,0 to 20,0) -> X=19 {ok}
	X=Jd Distance(1,0 to 21,0) -> X=19 {should be 20}

At the begginning of each maze I paste a bob image of a dot/pip onto the 
screen, I then pack the screen into a data bank using the PACK 
command, at the end of each level i unpack the bank onto the screen, 
this takes less time than redrawing the dots all over again.
The funny mouth man is a displayed using a sprite. I erase the dots 
by pasting a blank bob of the correct size and colour. When 
uncompiled this method of deleting the dots slows things down, but 
when compiled it doesn't make that much difference, I'm sure that 
there are faster ways to do it, but the method I have been using 
doesn't interfere with the smoothness of the gameplay.

Don't use bobs for the Dots, you can use the plot command and delete
the dots as the player sprite eats them, when the program is compiled 
the speed of the process will increase.

Yes, there is a File Copy command in the AMCAF extension. It even copies
larger files than available memory.

Yes, there are some nice font commands in there as well. And even Tool
Types can be read. Oh, and watch out for the Turbo Plot/Turbo Point/Turbo
Draw commands! There is some kind of Word$ command too.

All in all, there about 123 functions (139 different syntaxes) and 146
commands (193 different tokens).

There a lot of people who think the JD manual is insufficient. I've
written a 220 KB manual, which should be really enough for anyone, and
even then, nobody reads it :-(

It's really frustrating :-(

I find using "Not" to be very unpredictable - dont ask me why, but I have

with "=False" the bug disappears!

You have been warned! - do not use "Not"!

Sorry, in my hast to post an answer to Ben's question I wrote the code 
incorrectly.  It should have read.
        RANG=CANG-DANG
        If RANG>180 then RANG=RANG-360   or  if RANG>180 then Add RANG,-360

The incorrect listing would have rotated in the wrong direction.
You can think of this as a clock.  If the object is facing say 12 and the 
centre is towards 8 then you would want to rotate counter-clockwise 
instead of clockwise which would take longer.  Sorry about this.

Well, I suppose you would want to save pictures, sprites and music ?
Anyway: if you, before you save to program, erase the not-wanted
banks, they won't be saved.
Also, banks with data may be reserved as data or as work. The work-bank
will not be saved whereas the data one will.

I Hope this helps ?

You will be pleased to know that PACAC (Point and Click Adventure
Creator) can handle real life time scales. Not only this, but you
can build up character reputations/personalities/AI and characters
can go about their daily business, regardless of what the player is
up to.

 Alright guys,

	I'm writing a beat em up, similar (but inferior to) mortal
Kombat, and a flash back style arcade adventure, and both games
require the program to load two or more separate bob banks and
combine them. Is there any way to do this using the original AMOS?

Hello fellow amos list people!

I'm trying to write a top view racing game using the original AMOS and 
compiler on an A500.

I'm pretty experienced at using AMOS, but I just can't get a scrolling 
rountine that is fast will retaining a playable level of smoothness.

Can anyone give me any tips on how to make cool scrolling?

I know everyone will say buy this extension, program it in machine code etc. 
 but I'm just a poor student who isn't very good at assembler.  I could 
probably afford some sort of shareware extension like 'The missing Link' for 
STOS.(AMOS on the ST).

Anyone got any advice?

Thanks,

Pete

Have you tried to use the new AmosPro Compiler which can compile Amos, 
EasyAmos AND AmosPro
programs! This may get round some of the problems you are having. Its 
available from F1 Licenseware.

Actually Martijn, it's the sprite bank that I don't want saved.  I have 
several packed images which I'd like to save together but the sprite bank 
will get in the way.  I know, I could save to Ram:, erase it, and then 
reload it, but I'd like to see if there's a way around this first.  I 
might also be incorporating samples at a latter date and I don't want to 
have to reload those.

Thanks for the bit about work banks not being saved.  I'd forgotten about 
that.  I'll have to change some of my data banks to that format.

As I have APro, I don't know which instructions are not available but I'll 
give your problem a go anyway.

If all the bobs which you are going to display are located in a single 
bank then a Bank Swap command should work.  (If it's implemented in Amos)

If you require images from both banks then there's more work involved.
I don't think you can combine bob banks, unless there's an extension that 
can.  If not you might have to swap banks, paste the bobs you want, then 
swap back and use Get Bob..

Sorry if this isn't any help but it's all I can think of at the moment.  
maybe I'll come up with something later.

If you do end up doing this, you might consider storing the bob images as 
packed data.  Then you could simply unpack to a hidden screen and use the 
Get Bob.. with your current bank.  This will also use up less memory and 
since the grabbing will occur before the action starts it shouldn't 
effect game play.

Pete, with regards to your scrolling Q.
I usually paste tiles to a double buffered screen to achieve scrolling.
Here are some tips:

1) Keep the screen colours to a minimum.

2) When using double buffer.  Disable the Sprite and Bob Updates and call 
them as needed.  ie. after you've scrolled or after movement.  You may 
have to play around with the bobs to ensure that the backgrounds are 
identical because bob update causes a screen swap.

3) use autoback 0 to restrict graphic operations to the logical screen 
and call screen swap.  Remember to use Wait Vbl.  I get a flicker if I don't.

4) The smaller the play area the faster since there's less tiles to paste

5) Only draw the edge required.  Screen copy the remaining area over.

6) Compile your code if possible.

Hope this helps.  I'm sure someone can think of something better.

I seem to be sending a lot of postings today.  Well here's another.

This really isn't important but I'd like to see where most of you stand 
on this.  My current project is using a 32 colour display, however, I 
would like to use the Half-brite mode (I realize this will mean a speed 
decrease when scrolling).  Is ECS considered the minimum now 
or should I maintain the 32 colours to ensure that I reach as many users 
as possible.  The colours will mainly be used by users to create tiles 
and I'd like them to have the best possible selection to work with.
	Also, how popular are non-computer RPGs in Europe.
Any comments appreciated.

Of the ones you DON'T want to save, save them into RAM: and delete them

banks, and the ones in RAM: can be reloaded.

Clumsey, but I think it's the only way.

The command works fine and as expected, but it's the intepreter that
seems to have problems. Sometimes, in large IF statements, it says
there's an error on the line with the NOT in it. This can normally be fixed
by rearranging the IF statement or putting a variable equal to Not(value).

However, your problems could be caused by NOTing a number which is not
0 or -1. :-?

MC> You have been warned! - do not use "Not"!

No, do use NOT! It's faster! ;-)

Well I've just tried it out, and the non-Fn version is fractionally faster.

The only bug with that could be the replacing of -1 with True. True can
hold any value other than 0.

So something like this would be completely messed up :

   Dim a(10)
   B=10
   Repeat
      a(B)=Rnd(10)
      Dec B
   Until B=-1

Load "Sprites.abk",1 will add it to the existing bank.

Load "Sprites.abk" would overwrite the existing bank.

I *think* that's the right way round.

Have you seen that flight sim code from one of the AMOS club disks, green
scenery and blue sky, and you control the cockpit view with the joystick? 
I liked it so much I added some colorful explosions, but didn't take it

A Amos-Lister by the handle of Grifter asked:

 "Is ECS considered the minimum now or should I maintain the 32 colours to ensur I reach as many users as possible."

64 colour mode ie half-brite can be used by ALL amiga computers, as can HAM.
The problem you might run into though, is that half-brite generates similar
graphic artifacting to HAM. This would only be a problem if you have AMOS
bobs moving around over the half-brite graphic.

So if it's a static graphic screen you are displaying, go ahead with half-brite
or better HAM! Note that you can't use hires (more than 352 vertical columns
of on-screen resolution) if you want ECS/OCS users to run your program.

Of course since AMOS doesn't support AGA you can't do greater than ECS/OCS
graphic modes anyway. So what are we talking about? :')

Each loop uses 24 bytes of RAM for a colour image.

Since the list has apparently just picked up at least two Poles, I thought
I would extend a hearty "hi!" and say that we sure look forward to their 
input. Things _do_ get slow here and the more vried and diverse the 
viewpoints, the better the reading and learning value of the list.

So how do Amigas, Macs, and IBM clones fare in Poland and how did you people
luck ;) into AMOS?

On another subject, my AMOS effort on aminet, games/misc/Rocko.lha , is 
listed at about #14 (with a bullet!) on the most downloaded from aminet 
list in the latest Amiga Report at http://www.omnipresence.com. So if there
are still some deprived amos-listers who haven't enjoyed the pleasure of
being blown away by this, ermm, great game (yeah that's the ticket) then
run don't walk to your nearest ftp and get it. And someone let me know
if it works on more advanced Amigas.

I think you're wrong.

What you do is once you've got the first bob bank loaded, simply type 
load "blahblah.abk",1  This will append bank "blahblah.abk" to the bank 
already loaded.  It's the ",1" that does the trick!!

I don't know what ECS has to do with it. HB has always been possible, AFAIK.

Yes they surely do! The weakest part in amos is probably it's screen system
being so sloooow, and therefore I use my custom copperlists to speed up
my routines.

I've never done a flight sim probably coz I'm not much into math like

Hi !


I need a procedure that returns the address of an already open Intuition

something like :

and param would contain the address of the intuition screen...


Can somebody help me, please ?


Thanks in advance !

	An ECS computer is required to do half-brite mode(meaning any one with
more than an Amiga1000). Just thought I would add that since believe it or not
some people still have and use 1000's. Also, unless it happens to be the bob
routines that generate artifacts, EHB shouldn't be making any.

D0>  Well, no, but the program crashes and ends.

The reason for this *must* be not enough memory. The game needs about 700
KByte of free memory. You should play it from harddisk and not from RAM:.

32 colours are used. 16 for the game figure and all the other objects and
16 for the background.

It can't be run from NTSC as far as I know because the screen uses
vertically 256 lines (that's PAL) and in NTSC AMOS cuts every line
from 201 to 256.
Anyone knowing how to stop AMOS in cutting these lines? If there's a
possibility I'll release a patch.

If the game sells well, I would maybe make features like this. But
unfortunately it doesn't sell well (only 2 copies sold by now) :-(

AMOS just cannot scroll very well, especially in 32 colours.

 At the begginning of each maze I paste a bob image of a dot/pip onto the 
 screen, I then pack the screen into a data bank using the PACK 
 command, at the end of each level i unpack the bank onto the screen, 
 this takes less time than redrawing the dots all over again.
 The funny mouth man is a displayed using a sprite. I erase the dots 
 by pasting a blank bob of the correct size and colour. When 
 uncompiled this method of deleting the dots slows things down, but 
 when compiled it doesn't make that much difference, I'm sure that 
 there are faster ways to do it, but the method I have been using 
 doesn't interfere with the smoothness of the gameplay.
 
 Don't use bobs for the Dots, you can use the plot command and delete
 the dots as the player sprite eats them, when the program is compiled 
 the speed of the process will increase.

I'd really like ALL of them! As soon as you finish any of them, upload
them to aminet and tell me!

VR> zoom&rot8 - A Zoom AND rotate effect in Amos!
VR> 
VR>             * 100% done

Pah! That's easy! The hard bit is getting it to run fast! ;-)

Why not upload it to aminet?!

VR> This was not ALL.. i've made many minor Games, Intros, utils
VR> AND fun-programs not mentioned here.

Upload them all to aminet!

VR> Bonus: A small rotating starfield-effect

<SNIP>

Excellent! I'll try it out!

(and then you could upload it to aminet?) ;-)

The only computers unable to display EHB are the very first
Amiga 1000. 
Since there are not very many of those, I would think you
can go for EHB without trouble.
That is: mind the chip-mem consumption!!!
(reserve work and data banks as fast mem!)
EHB is officialy part of the OCS.
Maybe the Amiga 1000's chipset should be called 'ancient
chip set'

As to RPGs: I happen to take part in two sessions.(RolemasteR)
            I think it is a lot of fun. I also think
            it is difficult to say anything about 'popular'
            many people I know don't realy get it, they mostly
            don't play computer-based RPGs either.
Most RPGs are too difficult for the MSdumb-crowd. :-/

Except on very early A1000's, EHB is not possible. But I think noone on this
list is using those old models anyway (are you?)

Hi Morris,

I tried replying to your @xs4all.com   address but it got bumped back to
me.

[Best AMOS Engines]

I'd be glad to try but I never have much luck doing that ... I think my
Encoder is retarded.  There have been several replies about this and I
just sent a message to Internet guru and List member Andy Church to see if
he would put these up somewhere ... maybe the AMOS WWW site or the Aminet.
 So do you want to hang on a day or two till we hear back from him? ...
(post your reply on the List, Andy).
-Chris.

	Hello all,
		A while ago I posted a question about Logi/Physi
	screen swapping and a nimber of you wrote to me advising

	I've a few questions about all this,
	First, how can such a sytem of pasting tiles at the edge of
		the screen as others are scrolling off be done 
		within one Vertical Blank, or at least
		a reaonable number of them.
	Second, How can such a sytem be manipulated to
		produce 8-way scrolling, that is simeltaneous
		x and y scrolling?
	And lastly,
		How to set up or get a tile map editor capable
		of pasting chunks of a map on the fly?

		As always thanks for all the advice,

If anyone has any information on the fromat of the amos 3D files, I'll
attempt to create a conversion program. It probably would convert TDDD
files (that's the format of Imagine) to amos 3D. 
     If I do write it, it would have quite a few limitations. The objects
converted would have to be fairly simple, otherwise poor little amos would
not be able to move thousand surfaced objects. But , I still think it's
worth looking into. I'd probably have a good deal of it already written in
my anim2bob (version 2) converter.
So, if anyone can give me some info on amos 3D file structures, I'll take a
bash at it.

Another topic: I'll send my raycaster (aka Doom clone) to John Bintz this

no one else is interested, but if no one objects, and there are enough (and
I mean lots) of requests, I might post it here. If anyone objects, I won't.

Last topic: I'm putting the finishing touches on my web page, and have
included an amos file section. I have a few links to other amos pages, such
as Andys, but if there are anyothers on the list who have pages, let me
know, so I can include yours in the list.
oh yes, the file section will include English versions of the instructions
to the Turbo extension. Sorry, no nude pictures :-)

Well 64 colours EHB mode has been around now for 11 years so I would
guess thats some sort of standard ;)

I don't think its possible to write a game in AMOS that isn't compatable
with the original A500. "Appart from some things" so don't give me a list
of examples :)

As for 64 colours ECS or AGA mode, can you use 64 colours without EHB?
I think you can but not with AMOS!

32 colours for a game is just about minimum really these days. We all
moan about not having real AGA support with AMOS and then write 16 colour
games with it. I saw an scrolling Shoot'em'up the other day that was
written in AMOS and I was quite impressed with the speed but after looking
close I had a good reason to think it was in 8 colour only :( I mean
you can do better than that with 'SEUCS' YEUK!!

Why not try hardware scrolling?  Open a screen bigger than the 
physical screen and use screen offset?  The scroller for this is 
f**king fast, so you wouldn't have any problems.  Well, except the 
fact that you'll be limited to the size of the tracks (1023x1023 
pixels) but that's not too bad.  The only drawback is memory, but top-
down racing games are fairly easy on memory apart from the track.  
This is the method I used, and it worked fine for me!

Dear fellow AMOS programmer,

It is with great regret that I am reaching out for assistance
in a desperate time with a very short time frame to complete
my current project.

The situation is this, I am using hires interlaced screens
on an A1200 with Kickstart V3.0 (39.106) and AMOS Pro V2
with no problems at all, but with Kickstart V3.1 (40.68) I am
unable to display hires interlaced screens properly, they
appear to open correctly but are simply not laced and so
every second line is missing!!

Is there any known fix for this, is there some way to do
a poke etc. to force the screen into lace mode ? Any
help will be greatly appreciated :-(

Hi there!

I managed to delete all my amos-list messages just 5 mins ago but just
before doing so I noticed some strange goings on.

Joining two sprite/bob banks?

Well if you look in the manual for 'Load' it says:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------
LOAD "Filename"[,n]

If 'n' is omitted or is assigned a zero, the current bank will be
completely overwritten by the new sprites. Any other value for 'n'
forces the new sprites to be appended to this bank. This allows you
to combine several sprite files into the same program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If this is what your after, then bob's your uncle!

I just love the AMOS manual, I just wish the Blitz manual was this good!

Any more manual quotes, needed?

Cheers,

Hello everyone on the list.  What I would like to know is does anyone 
have the memory bank structure of menu banks??  All the structures of the 
other banks were included in the AMOS PRO manual but for some reason they 
left the Menu format out!!

If anyone knows the EXACT structure or knows where I can get it then I 
would be extremely grateful.

Thanks in advance.

I am currently writing a set of new accessories for Amos Pro.  I am 
rewriting all the old ones and updating them to include consistent user 
interfaces.  What I would like to know is there any accessory that 
anybody would like writing, something that they feel would be really 
useful? Hopefully, I shall release the set as licenceware when its 
finished.  Is there a market for this do you think?  Ideas and 
suggestions would be welcome.

Thanks.

Subject: More optimisation tips
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Here are some more tips for squeezing speed out of AMOS code, continuing
from the previous tips (Paul Hickman's included)...

13. Use global variables to return parameters from procedures, rather than
    Param.

14. Use Cls col,x1,y1 To x2,y2 instead of Bar x1,y1 To x2,y2.
    Note : Use R Bar in Turbo instead if possible.

15. Use Polyline to draw boxes instead of Box.
    Note : Use R Box in Turbo instead if possible.

    Eg.
       Don't use :
          Box 10,10 To 10,10
       Use this instead :
          Polyline 10,10 To 20,10 To 20,20 To 10,20

16. Use single dimensional arrays instead of two dimensional ones if
    possible.

    Eg.
       Don't use :
          Dim A(2,100)
       Use this instead :
          Dim A0(100),A1(100),A2(100)

17. Use N=N+A instead of using Inc, Dec or Add. Although the manual claims
    they are faster, when using the AMOSPro Compiler, they actually turn
    out slightly slower.

    Eg.
       Don't use :
          Inc a : Dec b : Add c,10
       Use this instead :
          a=a+1 : b=b-1 : c=c+10

    Note : Although Add is slower in it's short form, the full version
    Add variable,n,base To top is faster than the equivilant code.

18. Use a Repeat / Until loop instead of a For / Next loop.

    Eg.
       Don't use :
          For n=0 to 10
             (code)
          Next n
       Use this instead :
          n=0
          Repeat
             (code)
             n=n+1
          Until n=11 : Rem MUST be one more than with the original For

19. Use Peek(Varptr(a$)+x) instead of Asc(Mid$(a$,x,1)) and
    Poke Varptr(a$)+x,Asc(b$) instead of Mid$(a$,x,1)=b$.

    Eg.
       Don't use :
          A=Asc(Mid$(a$,3,1))
          Mid$(a$,6,1)=b$
       Use this instead :
          A=Peek(Varptr(a$)+3)
          Poke Varptr(a$)+6,Asc(b$) : Rem Asc(b$) should be predefined

    Note : This is just under three times faster!

20. Use Fill to clear an array to a certain value, rather than the
    equivilant For / Next loop.

    Eg.
       Don't use :
          For n=0 to 1000
             A(n)=27
          Next n
       Use this instead :
          Fill Varptr(A(0)) To Varptr(A(1000)),27

I'll be uploading this list to Aminet soon, so if you have any tips to add,
let me know QUICKLY!

I  believe the Amcaf ext. has commands which can read joypads as well as

p.s.
Thanks for the info regarding HB mode (I didn't realize it had been 
around for that long), as well as the correcting me on bank combining.  
Next time I'll wait a day before posting and check the manual first. (I

Make a huge (1024*1024) screen, and use Screen Offset. It eats lots of=20
memory, and the track can't be more than 1024*1024pixels big, but it's fast=

   Hi ALL!

Many people have asked me TO send them my Amos-games. So i have
made a pack of the most wanted ones. You have two ways TO get it:

WWW: You can find it in address:
     http://www.sci.fi/~cosmo/stuff.lha

Mail: Send me a message AND ask FOR it. Apologies FOR those
i have promised TO send it via mail, but it's much easier for me (and=20
probably for you too) to send it via WWW. But if you haven't got WWW access=
,=20
send me another message.

The archive is 1.8Mb big, and it's contents are:

 Directories (10) ...
  AOK  dogfight  escape  FMVKahy  Raketx  rescue  splatter  Stooped =20
Underwater=20

 Files (4) ...
  README 164 TICG.DMS 291193  Zoom&Rot82.Amos 1392

Have fun with them!

Greetings A.N.Smith, you wrote some text on the subject New accessories,
and now I'm going to answer it

A> I am currently writing a set of new accessories for Amos Pro.  I am

The AMOSPro apps suit my purposes fine. I'm not sure people would want to
BUY another set of apps that are simply updates of programs they already
have.

The only app that would be useful is a decent compression utility, that
can compress (and password encode) normal banks as well as sprite and
icon banks.

You can do it but as soon as you incorporate into your program you cut off
about 98% of the amiga-users out there.

For most arcade things couldn't just the <space bar> be used for the 2nd
button function?

I believe there is a sticks extension, but it's not on aminet.

You can always give users a choice of control mechanism so those with 2/3 
button
joysticks can use them, and those without can press space.

IMHO, a better approach would be to handle all the possibly combinations
of control so the game would cater for both punters with normal sticks and
those with sega pads (oops, I swore, sorry).

Would be nice if you could support analogue ones too if it applies to
your game, not many of those are around, I know, but then, it would
make the game 'future-proof'.

X-Status: 

Hello. I have a simple(?) question:

I use some assembly programs in my amos program and I pass the correct data-registers on with Dreg(i). The problem is that this is a very slow sollution, since it makes the process last nearly as long when I would not use assembly at all. Is there any faster way to get that data into the data-registers?

Thanx in advance,

Jeroen Knoester. -=Breakout ought to be ready REALLY soon now....=-

Or even use both, so if you have the second button, you can use it!!

Greetings v942360@si.hhs.nl, you wrote some text on the subject Dreg() :
Too slow!, and now I'm going to answer it

v> Hello. I have a simple(?) question:
v> 
v> I use some assembly programs in my amos program and I pass the correct data-registers on with Dreg(i). The problem is that this is a very slow sollution, since it makes the process last nearly as long when I would not use assembly at all. Is there an
 faster way to get that data into the data-registers?

A better way altogether would be to enter parameters in assembler procedures,
and read them off the stack in your assembler program with the Move.l (a3)+
commands.

I don't know whether your raycasting routine is good, bad or just
plain iffy, but I have sorted your fishbowl problem (a good clean 
every
now and then does the trick...:-)

I'm at least 2% sure I didn't add any Pro stuff, but the Pro editor 
is 100% sure, so I guess we're still 1.36 compatible...

OK, so I was going to look at the code the day it arrived here, 
but you know what life is like...

Anyway, I've fiddled, twiddled, and diddled, and the circle spacing
is now more even, and a few other things have been modified too.

Is this what you had in mind?

Chris

Greetings Driscoll,, you wrote some text on the subject Virtual mem, and
now I'm going to answer it

DC>      Does anyone know away to use virtual memory with amos? My program has 
DC> many bobs, and pictures, and I would like to use the Hard Drive as memory if 
DC> possible.

I put VM in all "serious" programs I write. The easiest way is to simply
save banks when they are not being used and reload them when necassary.

Something like this should do :

Procedure _CLEARRAM
  For N=1 To 100
    If Length(N)>0 Then Save "Temp:"+(Str$(N)-" "),N : Erase N
  Next N
End Proc

Procedure _RESTORE[N]
  FILE$="Temp:"+(Str$(N)-" ")
  Load FILE$,N
  Kill FILE$
End Proc

Then, whenever you know you'll need to use a certain bank, just do
_RESTORE[banknum], and _CLEARRAM afterwards.

I would not rely on virtual memory fot this. I simply load, load and load 
again whenever I need some new graphics. With virtual memory, you take up
a huge amount of HD-space (allright, not that huge, butlarge in comparison with
the RAM in your Amiga), for data that is not commonly used.

Anyway, do you have a MMU-equipped CPU? It *must* be a full 68030, 68040, 
68060 or a 68020+68851. If you own a A4000/030, forget it. The newer A4000's
sold before Commodore went bankrupt did not have full 68040's as well.

Regards,
Maarten

The author of situp.lzh (aminet games/misc I think) commented on my first
aminet upload Rocko.lha (aminet games/misc):

 "Rocko works on an A3000T"

Thanks. I had this sinking feeling that the delays (I actually use WAIT X or 
similar) would get all screwed up on 68020 plus. As for Rocko's appearing on
the most-downloaded list in Amiga Report, I think that's mostly from people
who routinely cruise the "recent uploads" directory. And the phrase "digitized
boxing game" in the short description probably doesn't hurt either.

By the way you might check the AR from the time you first ul'd situp.lzh.
What was your digitizer for that anyhow? And do you use PAL?

Thanks!

I had hoped to pick up Amos Pro and ditch Creator but I just received the
latest Amazing Amiga magazine and Amos Pro is listed for sale nowhere.
(a few extensions are listed in some ads though)

I am really disinclined to try to order a product from tax and duty heavy
Great Britain but if the price is super low and someone who has purchased
internationally can give me some tips I will give it a try. And oh yeah
it doesn't have to have a box but it must have a nice manual.

Also would consider buying a used Amos Pro package in good shape for very
super low price.

I saw all those nice optimalisation tips and I thought
"let's add some of mine to them". So here they are,
my own collection :-)

1) This routine is for making the string 1 character shorter.
   This may be helpfull in an program to replace the input
   command. But the question is if you need that speed in
   such a routine ;-)
   My routine is uncompiled 6 times faster and
   compiled 35 faster !!!! %-))) (Getting dizzy of the speed)

   S$=Space$(1001)

   ' Normal way
   Timer=0
   For X=1 To 1000
      S$=Left$(S$,Len(S$)-1)
   Next X
   T1=Timer : Print T1

   S$=Space$(1001)

   ' My way
   Timer=0
   For X=1 To 1000
      S=Varptr(S$)-1
      Poke S,Peek(S)-1
   Next X
   T2=Timer : Print T2

   Print "My routine is";T1/T2;" times faster !!!"

2) Don't use Start(BANK) in a routine that must be fast

   BANK=10
   Reserve As Work BANK,1000

   X=Start(BANK)
   Timer=0
   For X=1 To 1500
      PE=Peek(X)
   Next X
   Print Timer

   Timer=0
   For P=1 To 1500
      PE=Peek(Start(BANK))
   Next P
   Print Timer

3) The same as 2 is also for Screen Height and Screen Width.
   Don't use them in routines that need to be fast.

4) Don't use Chr$(0) in routines but replace them with a string

   Don't use:
      I=Instr(ST$,Chr$(0))

   But use:
      C0$=Chr$(0)      in the beginning of your prog
      I=Instr(ST$,C0$) in the routine

5) And now... the fastest way to display a map...

   ' This is the slow way, that I've seen in multiple sources
   ' of games.
   For Y=0 To FHV
      For X=0 To FWV
         Paste Icon 16+X*16,16+Y*16,Peek((FPOSY+Y)*FW+Start(BLS1)+FPOSX)+1
      Next X
   Next Y

   ' Now my quick version... Note that the start(bank)
   ' is placed in front of the routine.
   ' FHV   = Field Height View
   ' FHV   = Field Width  View
   ' FPOSX = Field POSition X (Where the player is looking in the map)
   ' FPOSY = Field POSition Y
   POS=Start(BLS1)+FPOSX
   For Y=0 To FHV
      MPY=(FPOSY+Y)*FW+POS
      SPY=16+Y*16
      For X=0 To FWV
         F Paste Icon 16+X*16,SPY,Peek(MPY+X)+1
      Next X
   Next Y

Yes, it was on disk issue 2.

Are you a Club USA subscriber?  Did you get issue 3 and was is OK?  Mine
was burnt toast, not even formatted.  So was another guy's.  Mark says
he's sending replacements but nothing yet.

Hi dudes,

Engine Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The "Best AMOS Engines" described below are from these sources:

- the Nothing But AMOS club disks (which quit about 2 years ago).

- Totally AMOS, which ended in April 1995 after 21 issues, with the
editors declaring that all issues are to be considered PD as of May 1,
1995.

- Mr. AMOS Club, edited by the Brian Bell group, which quit a couple years
ago when all their equipment was stolen.  This was the premiere club, with
huge well-written code tutorials on game design, and some of the best
engines.

- Australian AMOS Club, Francois declared this the largest group in the
world, over 2000 members at it's peak, 15 issues ending in 1995.

- Whitby AMOS Club, edited by Paul Gumsley, 6 issues, none since summer of
1995, interesting series of RPG code tutorials.

- AMOS Club USA, publishes intermittently.

- AMOSzine, probably the last steady AMOS disk mag in the world, created
by F1
Licenceware owner Steve Bye, current editor is Andy Gibson.   All the UK
AMOS stars are involved in AZ, 3 disks per issue, issue 10 released Dec
95.  No e-mail; for current issue send 2.50 UKP to:

Andy Gibson
c/o L. Cruikshanks
Top Flat 2/2,  75 Dunira St.

Scotland    G32  8PQ


AMOS ENGINE DESCRIPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  "Beast Scroll", on Mr. AMOS Club disk 5, no author given.  "Shadow of
the Beast" clone, horizontal parallax scroll, three levels of well-drawn
scenery and a fairly cool purple beast.  Smooth and fast.  Bit of a memory
hog, but avoids the Dual Playfield 8 color limit in lores.

2.  "3D Dungeon" on Totally AMOS issue 5, by G. Crook.  Dungeon
walkthrough,
well-drawn 3D stone-walled dungeons, click on directional arrows to move
in
increments, "oomph" sounds if you walk into a wall, user interface for
expansion of features.  Ask Greg about it at: gcox@cts.com ... he's
messing around with it.

3.  "Dizzy Clone", a tutorial series on Mr. AMOS Club disks 3-6, by Brian
Bell and others.  Smooth side scroller, 3D scenery, designed like the
"Dizzy" UK game hits.  Lots of enemies.  Very thorough tutorial comments
in the code.

4.  "Space Fighter", a tutorial series on Mr. AMOS Club disks 3-6, by
Brian Bell and others.  A Mortal Kombat/Street Fighter clone, 3D
background scenery. The character is 4 inches (10 cm) high, with nice
smooth fight movements via joystick control.

5.  "Alien Breed III Clone" on Mr. AMOS Club disks 4-6, by N. Kennedy. 
Two enemy tanks, good smooth movement and collision, lots of comments.

6.  "Astro Wars" on Totally AMOS issue 3, by S. Bennett.  Stardust clone,
2 player, tons of code, great procs.

7.  "Pac Man Clone" on Mr. AMOS Club issue 1, by David May, author of
Space Taxi.   Just like the original, good  movement and collision.

8.  "Killer Eel" on Nothing But AMOS disk 5B.  Shows how to create a huge
enemy several inches long and high, and coordinate his movements by
animating different sections.  Smooth and realistic, 3D.

End of descriptions.

If anyone wants to volunteer to put these on the Aminet (I'm bad at that)
I'll donate a disk and stamp and mail these to that person ... USA or
Canada would be cheapest for me.  For the Aminet descriptor you can use
what I wrote above it you want, add to it if you want.  It's probably best
to put these each in their own dir on the Aminet rather than all in one
"Best Engines" dir whcih would slow down a search.

L8R,
-Chris.

This is faster because it doesn't involve making a copy of the string - the
larger the string you use, the faster it gets.

This will only work reliably for strings 255 characters or less - the string
length is stored in a word, not a byte, so it should be:

S=Varptr(S$)-2
Doke S,Deek(S)-1

If you ran the original code on a string 256 characters long, it
would make the new length 511. Also note if you are removing more
than one character, the string buffer memory released won't be reusable
until the garbage collector is next called.

These are all the same optimisation - move any functions that will
return a constant value outside of a loop. (It called code motion of
loop invarient statements - optimising compilers do it for you). This is
an especially important optimisation when the function called is an
AMOS procedure instead of a built in function.


Here's another quasi-optimisation: Use X=Free at points where you don't
care about the speed to reduce the chances of the garbage collector being
called where you do care about the speed. Of course it can only ever be
called in an instruction that involves strings.

I hate to agree with this, but I do. I personally would like to see some
improvements, but don't think people will buy them. I know this from
personal experience.
Personal experience:
     I coded the anim2bob converter. It allows you to convert anims (mode 5
from Dpaint) to bob banks. I put the orginal version (1.0) on aminet, with
the note saying that version 2.0 will only be made available to registered
users. Even though 2.0 fixed many of the small bugs, gave a GUI interface,
allowed conversion from more than just anims (Imagine, TDDD), gave
different conversion options, memory optimisations, and the kitchen sink, I
didn't receive one cent.
Only one copy of 2.0 has ever gone out, and that was for a playtester who
found a major bug ( it wouldn't work on A1200- now fixed).

So if your thinking of making money from it, I doubt you will. 
Sorry to burst your bubble, but after sending 7 months coding Anim2bob, I'm
slightly disheartened. Oh well, I'll just have to sell the children off for
medical experimentation to make money.

I'd actually be interested to know how many registerations AMCAF has
gotten.

Sorry to burst your bubble - but maybe the fact you didn't get one cent
was becuase the program you posted to the aminet was a pile of cack. A
friend of mine uploaded it and hated every bit of the code.

Not that i'm saying that it is or anything (becuase i haven't seen it)
but by the sounds of it, the original posted program was far from inspiring
enough for people to want to cough up for v2.0

Most people these days wont touch a program (pd or not) which hasn't got a
GUI - even if the program is the greatest thing since sliced bread.

Just a thought :)

As far as I'm concerned, anyone without a HD, I don't really care about.
Any "serious" computer user should have a HD installed!

It can if you save the screens, sounds, sprites, etc.

VM is useful though if you want your program to be multitasking - then
you'll be able to run other programs as well with the memory saved.

My Point And Click Adventure Creator uses virtual memory. If it didn't,
memory requirements would be pretty large, depending on how big the
adventure is. That's my damn good reason, anyway.

Besides, if the user has pots of ram, they can simply define the VM
storage place to RAM:

I have never done anything shareware, and i hope i'll never have to. Get=20
a real job, if you need money!

Subject: MORE optimisation tips
Status: RO
X-Status: 

I still keep finding them! Here are a few more...

1. Adding to the one about using powers of 2 with multiplying and
   dividing... DON'T use the lsl/lsr commands in extensions. They are
   over TWICE as slow!

2. Use subroutines instead of procedures. They are several times faster!

   Eg.
      Don't use :
         _SOMETHING
         Procedure _SOMETHING
            Code
         End Proc
      Use this instead :
         Gosub _SOMETHING
         _SOMETHING:
            Code
         Return

3. Don't use parameters in Def Fns. As functions are local to procedures,
   any variables used, will be known in the function.

   Eg.
      Don't use :
         Def Fn C(x,y)=(x*y*y+x) MOD 16
         For x=0 To 10
            For y=0 To 10
               Plot x,y,Fn C(x,y)
            Next y
         Next x
      Use this instead :
         Def Fn C=(x*y*y+x) MOD 16
         For x=0 To 10
            For y=0 To 10
               Plot x,y,Fn C
            Next y
         Next x

4. Use as few brackets in equations and If structures as possible.

   Eg.
      Don't use :
         A=(B*C)-(D*E)+(F*G)
         If (A=2) or (B=100) Then blah blah
      Use this instead :
         A=B*C-D*E+F*G
         If A=2 or B=100 Then blah blah

Hi guys,

I was thinking of writing an HTML editor/producer etc.  Any call for such a
package?  Lots of shortcuts to add tags etc.  GUI, whatever.  I shall also
include a lot of the new HTML stuff.  Perhaps even set up a Macro system where
you can default to new settings in the future.

Any comments?

Also - jumping the gun I know, but I'm also thinking of writing a simple Java
Token recognising Text Editor.  Although the Amiga Version isn't out yet, It
would be quite useful, I think.

Let me know what you think :-)

Well lets see:

Chip RAM:
1) Workbench screen
2) AdPro Screen <-- More hungrey for memory this one
3) Amos Screen

Fast RAM:
1) Workbench
2) Amos
3) RexxMast
4) AdPro

As you can see a huge amount of ram is being used by all the programs and 
various screens, the
biggest cuplrit would be AdPro which can take huge chunks out of Fast & Chip 
ram. You could save
a lot of memory by dumping Amos and sticking to Arexx to to what you want or 
a C/Assembler
program.
BTW how much does you system ram you have?

Well, I think there is quite a market out there interested in this!
I myself am not such a 'webber' but I know a lot people who are and
who want above all to make their 'homepage' as nice and great as 
possible.
To do so: you need to know a lot about HTML to do something nice.
The tables and stuff are not all *that* easy to make. For someone who
did some programming: all right, but not everyone's a programmer, right ?

Anyway: I think with amos you can make a good headstart because
(I feel) it is great for development!
About the java-thing: why not? But do plan your work and be very
elaborate in your program (this would become a big project!)
However take notice of the programs like GoldEd and a few others
that also allow for 'keyword recogition', no need to reinvent the
wheel: use arexx instead !

Yep! I write all my web pages on my Amiga using ED! An HTML writer would be
brillaint. All the PC progs that I've used have been crap. At the mo, I just
use a standard layout, then type everything in by hand!

About the optimizing hints.. how about making an program thet searches=20
Amos program for anything that could be optimized, and tell the user how=20
the optimizing should be done.=20

It shouldn't need to be a real automated optimizig program, because they=20
don't seem to work well and are difficult to write.=20

First we should compile all the hints to a single list, and then for=20
example i could write the program and import the list in it.=20

Example:

-- User has program in amospro:

Do
   x=3Dx+1
If x>100 then Exit
Loop

-- He selects 'Amos Mailing List Optimizer v1.0' from pull-down menu.

-- A requester appears:

---------------------------------------------+
> x=3Dx+1                                      |
                                             |
You could use 'Inc x' for faster speed.      |
                                             |
[ Edit ]  [ Ignore ]     [ Stop optimizing ] |
---------------------------------------------+

-- Also, there would be a requester about that Do - Exit - Loop could be=20
replaced with Repeat - Until..

Now you should understand what i mean.. gimme the list so i can start=20
coding it!

Sounds nice..  how about preview/wysiwyg option?=20

Sorry to go off topic, but after getting

two postings to the list, I`m wondering if
anyone other than myself has received the
mails.

They were replies to the code help requests
from Darryl Lewis (flying through circles)
and John Bintz (fishbowling raycaster).

Also, to Darryl and John, did either of you
receive my replies directly, as I Cc`d them
to you as well.

Thanks

Yes, do it, as long as it's done as WYSIWYG. I could make my own util, 
but I'm going to be lazy and let you do it. *8^>

Before I start, I'd like to mention that I've had delivery problems with 
my mail to the list.  If this is causing any problems for the list ie. 
error messages being forwarded, please let me know directly and I'll try 
to rectify the situation.

Now, there was a posting inquiring as to whether different sprites could 
have the same mask.  Sorry, I don't know who posted it.

Anyway here's my theory, and I emphasize the word theory since I've not 
had the time to check this for myself so corrections would be appriaciated.

I assume that the mask is created around the sprite, including any 
tranparent pixels on its border.  (This is the part I'm not sure about).

If this is the case, and the mask is created around even the transparent 
pixels then it's simply a matter of creating a background solid region 
and drawing the visible image centred in it.  All the sprites should then 
conform to the same outline and thus have the same mask.

Once again, I'm not absolutely sure, so either check it if you have the 
time or correct me.

I posted this earlier but got no responce.  I'm not sure it got thru.

I want to be able to call AP instructions from an asm routine.  I know 
that the parameters are stored in the stack and in order of occurance 
(left to right, with the leftmost at the bottom) -I hope-.

If someone could conferm this and possibly state the format with which to 
call the instruction, it would be greatly appreciated.  All I have is one 
example listed in the AP compiler manual regarding Screen Display..

Sorry! But I didn't explain the problem correctly. What I wanted was to
use the /collision/ mask from another sprite, not the "see-through"
mask.

Hi!

Has anyone tried those games yet, i'd like to get some feedback! =3D)

Get them from http://www.sci.fi/~cosmo/stuff.lha before i delete it!


P.S. I'm planning to make a new game, something like Frontier in Star=20
Trek TNG universe. It will be a realistic adventure/strategy/trading game,=
=20
with some action parts. I'd need some coders and graphicians for the job,=
=20
because it will definately be a major project. For more info, reply!

Hi all,

Throughout my experience with Amos I have found many instances where its 
speed left much to be desired.  From time to time I was able to write 
small assembler routines to speed up critical tasks.  
Now, I would like to slowly migrate to programming in C and assem.  To 
do that I need to have access to a kernel reference manual.  I have a 
good C++ compiler but it lacks any descriptions of Amiga's libraries.  
Is there anything on Aminet that might help me?

Ps. I will never fully abandon AMOS.  It is far to good for prototyping 
ideas.
