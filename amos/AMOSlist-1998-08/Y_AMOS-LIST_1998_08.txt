  * ASCII signitures have been rebuilt where possible.
    Unfortunately Yahoo store messages in a way which means more than 1 space
    is stored as just 1 space. Viewing the message source, and then trying to
    view HTML source in Firefox didn't make any difference.
    Where I have been unable to rebuild the ASCII signitures I have simply put
    "ASCII Signiture As-Is" by the message number.

    Thanks to Andrew Allen for preserving Peter Cahill's ASCII signiture for
    me (see message 1613) in November 1998.

    Thanks to Michael Cox, as I was able to cross-reference some emails from
    the Onelist archives with ones posted to the Yahoo one to reinstate email
    addresses that Yahoo has discarded, and rebuild some ASCII signitures.


   Message From Archivist
  ------------------------

   I hope everyone enjoys reading the messages and appreciates me archiving
   them. It took hours of work to get all the info into this file and then 
   rebuild the ASCII signitures as best as I could.
   Don't forget to join, or atleast visit, the Yahoo! AMOS-LIST group:

AMOS Future + ICQ

Wed Dec 31, 1969 11:59 pm
"Alastair Murray" <malcolm.murray@virgin.net>


Just to add myself to he ICQ database:
Alastair Murray, Muzza, 15173722

And as for AMOS future.
Great work guys! The future looks great!
As for examples on the AMOS update CD. I've done TONS of AMOS stuff as
you can see on my webpage. I'd be quite happy to contirbute both full
games/programs as well as example code. Mail me if you're interested.

As for AMOS NG. Sounds great. I think its just what we need too. I was
getting worried about how AMOS was going to be unuseable in the near
future.

One thing, I notice some other people have voiced concerned about this
too. That is about compatability with current AMOS programs.
I can fully understand that a lot of things will have to be done quite
differently but will keep as close as possible to current AMOS syntax?

Hmmm.. how about a code convertor? Input your AMOS Pro source code in
ASCII and out comes the AMOS NG equivilent. Of course you could then
go through it and make all the necassary optimisations that AMOS NG
would have. Thats the sort of thing I could do myself actually.

Anyway, great work. Please keep us updated as to how progress goes.

-Murray

But I cant set a date yet, things arent going that well with GMS
lately due some problems which should be fixed within a week.
These problems has slowed the production down for a full
month now but the author of GMS has assured me that he will
have them all fixed VERY soon, once that is fixed I'll work a lot
on it all I know for sure is that it will be done before mid November.

I'll post a msg to the list once I am able to set a date,

More Amos Infos

Sat Aug 1, 1998 8:07 pm
Pietro Ghizzoni <ghizzo@agonet.it>


Hi!

Due to the several messages about the Amos future, i'll reply to all the
questions here:

1- i'm sorry... i've not mentioned this before, but obviously the upgrade will
be available on floppy disks too. (lite version). Anyway a CD is a must for
the full version.... I've a Zip drive, so on request, i can release a Zip
upgrade :)

2- Amos NG is written in C++ but the commands syntax is amos-like... for the
advanced users structured variables, declarations, and tag lists will be
available. For the basic users, all the standard basic functions are
available.
I'm sorry, but you can't directly import your Amos sources, since the
commands are similar but not equal.

3- The AMOS NG editor will be good as the amos one. Anyway you can use your
favourite text editor like GoldEd or CygnusEd.

4- In the CD upgrade is present a new set of Arexx scripts wich allows you to
program in Amos in a more amiga-like way like the other compilers. Now you can
use GoldEd (.. or CygnusEd) and its adavanced features to write your programs,
and trough Arexx you can call the stand-alone amos compiler, and compile your
programs like the others professional C compilers.

5- Soon a new remaked version of The AMOS Factory homepage will be available,
and a new important AMOS project will start. Surprise, surprise :) For this
you have to wait again some days! hehehe.... in this period i was in silence,
but working!

I have an A1200 with a SquirrelScsi. Cost about $100. I think everyone
should have a CD ROM drive. You can get them cheap and get the
interfaces cheap too ($100 is not bad or used of course).

Hmm, the old 1.3 Machines seem to never die. Well, Anthony, for private
reasons, you seem to be a programmer who are concentration og private
development of private software. I think that the new Amos will be so extended
for newer machines that it barely should only be used on new machines. New -
machines from 1992 - 1994, has many features that the original amos never
touched, but 1.3 machines WAS covered by the original Amos, and you may still
use Amos the Creator for your machine for many years to come. Being a person
with little cash (at the moment anyway) I still have upgraded to a Hi-spec
machine. Use the money you have to upgrade, at least to AGA! At least Kick
3.0!

I do not mean to say that A2000 is no good, because it an be with a gfx card.
At least, buy a Cybergfx-system!

CBATNAM - Update 3/8/98

Thu Jan 1, 1970 7:59 am
(Keith Hill) <Braneloc@mirex.demon.co.uk>


Well, first of all, to those who are in the know, my car got stolen on
wednesday. ..the update is, the police recovered it, completely intact
with contents unmoved(!) today ! I was as shocked to find it intgact as
I was to lose it in the first place. (Except I was a lot more pleased)

Second...

To all who have contributed to the CBATNAM project, I still need some
things from you, and this means **ALL** of you. You know who you are.
This includes everyne who wrote ANYTHING, or submitted ANY graphics, or
ANY sound, even if it was not used in the final version.

        One:    A "Men In Black" style photo of you, in any format.
        Two:    One or two lines describing yourself in text format for
                the credits.

Send both to:
        bubba@mirex.demon.co.uk

Note, the picture can be in ANY format, I don't care, jpg is best. If
you can't send a picture in digital format, a physical photo can be
returned. If you have not got a black suit, wear the closest you can
get. If you havn't got the shades, wear the closest you can get - but
expect your suit and glasses to be darkened on the final pic. Don't
worry, you'll get to approve it b4 release.

This is now URGENT.... Send as soon as possible. To the people who
have already send the piccies, thankx, but you are very much in the
minority.

....if everyone contributes, it works, if someone misses out, it looks
bad for the rest of us..

Everyone was worried for a while. I was informed of the new Amos and what
it was to be like etc ages ago and I'm glad that Pietro and the gang have
the source code. At least I don't need to move over to Blitz :)

Yup, count me in on that too...

That's a damn fine good question too...

That sounds like a neat idea Murray. I'm sure either your good self
or one of the Amos NG coders will eventually get around to coding a
convertor. I certainly hope so also. Please give this one some
proper attention guys. Murray has a great idea there which should
not be taken lightly if ya ask me :-)

I too had a text file which was in German (a dox file years ago for some
old App) and what I did was buy one of those English to German dictionaries
from WH Smith or Menzies etc.

I simply looked up the words and translated the dox guide easily :)

Why don't you do the same? Just a thought....

I think the main thing that concerns me, is the new programs I am developing,
rather than converting the old ones. Converting would be nice, however.

Do I wait for Amos NG, do I use AmosPro today, do I use Blitz today, do I
HiSoft today, or do I buy something for the peecee ?

Unfortunately, I am not 100% happy with ANY programming language that is
around today. There just isn't enough damn flexibility.



...as soon as a kernel is available, I am available for development or
testing work. I have an advanced project that needs writing, and needs
a decent machine to run on.

If you hadn't guessed, I've passed the data for CBATNAM on to Keith. I'm still
project coordinator, but Keith offered to give the final coding a bash, so he
got it.

The five levels are:
Space Attack - side shooter where Cap'n Bubba fights the nasty aliens on his
way to the planet.
Hang Glider - flight sim where Cap'n Bubba pilots his hang glider to the
surface of the planet.
Planet Attack - space harrier style where Cap'n Bubba fights the nasty aliens
on the planet.
The Gates Of Doom - tekken style fighting game where Cap'n Bubba faces the
toughest aliens in the planet.
Bubba's Bubbles - pang style quick level to gain extra points whenever the
Cap'n starts hallucinating.

Keith is also working on the cartoon intro screens and between level screens.
If you have anything to contribute, let us know. If the data I have given
Keith is any indication, the final game will be about 6 megs. We're hoping for
distribution by Mush. There will be a REAL manual, not just on-disk, and we
will hopefully release a cd version. In fact, maybe CBATNAM can go on the amos
updater cd due out later this year.

Well met and godspeed,

AMOS, PPC, 040, GFX Cards

Wed Dec 31, 1969 11:59 pm

I'm soon to get a PPC with 040 and also a Bvision when they come out.

Does anyone have any problems with AMOS and any of these components?

Any good solutions for GFX card problems?

Thanks,

Well, I use it with an 040 and the only problem is that above the
top screen strange things fliker every few seconds. Thats the only
problem I know of with 040's. I'm getting a PPC card soon so I'll inform
you about that.

As for GFX cards, you'd need one that automatically convert standard
Amiga displays to high sync ones. (eg, one with a fliker fixer). I'm not
sure if that'll work 100% though.


See ya.

Wasn't there a tutorial on a Disk Mag somewhere. Anyway, I've taught
myself
AMOS 3D by trial and error, and I must say its not as good as it shoud
have
been, its really hard to use. May as well wait for a new version.

I did manage to start a game with it though, I can send you the soure if
you
want

(I think it needs CRAFT, DoomMUSIC, AMOSTurbo and maybe other
extentions)

See ya.

I've got a PPC604e/060 and a CyberGFX and a CyberGFXPPC. The only thing
causing problems with AMOS is CyberGFXPPC (not the normal one), as it doesn't
have a passthrough for PAL-screens. This means, that you have to run with two
monitors. One for CyberGFX-displays and one for PAL-displays (eg. AMOS)

I'd say get DME, but it has trouble with (in fact, I could not get it to play)
samples over 64k in size.

In a drawing with about 50 areas, each with a different colour and
with different irregular shapes, how is it possibile to find each area with
a mouseclick while pointing to that area?

Piece of cake, use the point command to figure out which colour is
beneath the mouse and then you know which area it's pointing to.
So:
x=screen(x mouse)
y=screen(y mouse)
_colour = Point(x, y)
I'm not sure about the screen syntax but basically just be sure to use the
x and y SCREEN cordinates of the mouse as opposed to the x and y HARDWARE
cordinates which is wahy x mouse, y mouse give you.
Does this make sense? By making every area have it's own colour
you've really made it pretty easy on yourself, of course you're using 64
ehb mode and not HAM to get 50 colours right?

Setting the record straight

Tue Aug 4, 1998 5:23 pm
"Mr. Giark To You" <giark@hicksville.ddns.org>


Recently, I've been talking with Peter Cahill about TGE. It's the extension
with fast bobs, AGA/RTG, CDDA, the whole nine yards. It uses internal code for
iconify. It uses ptreplay.library for pt commands. It uses GMS for all graphic
commands and CDDA.

Contrary to rumour, I am NOT trying to stop production of TGE. I have no
problem with TGE and, if you are willing to pay the price, it will do all the
things you want it to do.

What do I mean, "pay the price"? GMS, the external `heart' of TGE, has a very
nasty licensing agreement. It's one I do not agree to, and, because of that, I
do not use GMS. I will, however, use TGE for the non-GMS commands.

This is not a message to trash TGE, Peter, GMS or its programmer. This message
is a clarification of why I, personally, alone, on my own, will not use GMS.

For the purposes of this message, I am speaking about creating a game/app
using GMS graphics. The program under consideration would be released as
shareware. If you never plan to release anything as shareware, but only as
freeware, the money argument does not apply to you, though the other licensing
requirements may be of interest.

GMS is a collection of programming tools, to put it simply. It handles AGA/RTG
graphics and CDDA, among other things. It requires libs, modules and prefs to
be on the machine running the GMS-based program. They can all be in one
directory, but still, users have to have them to run the game you have
created, which means you have to either distribute the GMS package with your
creation or point the purchaser to dev/misc/GMS_User.lha on aminet.

From the GMS agreement:
"DEVELOPERS LICENSE. Authors of GMS programs must obtain an official license
before public distribution of said programs. Failure to obtain a license may
impede certain penalties as outlined in the licensing agreement file."

Meaning you have to ask permission to release your game. You wrote the code.
You wrote the music. You made the samples. You drew the graphics. You came up
with the whole idea. Now ask someone else for permission to release it. Does
that bother you at all?

From the GMS agreement:
"The following table illustrates how much you will have to pay for a license
when you want to release a single game."

Each game/app. If you write a game, you pay him. If you write another, you pay
him AGAIN! How many times should you have to pay for the same commands?

From the GMS agreement:
"`The cost of your game' is defined by the amount of money that a consumer has
to pay to buy it. For example, if it costs me $10US to buy your program, your
license will cost $20US."

Which begs the question, how high will you jack your prices up to offset the
cost of this continuing license?

From the GMS agreement:
"Once you have your license you can sell your game for as long as you like,
and are also allowed to distribute the GMS binaries with it. In the above
case, the license cost would be recovered after selling just 2 copies of the
program."

Which means you have to sell at least three copies before you, the author, the
one who did all the work for that game, sees ANY profit. The argument can be
made that the GMS author did a lot of work, too. Agreed, he did. Once. So, I
should pay him, over and over again? That is not an equitable solution. He
wrote the graphic routines. He didn't write my game.

From the GMS agreement:
"If you release more than one game in a year, your license fees can be lowered
(e-mail for details)."

But you will still be paying again and again for the same commands. The
argument has been put forth that you do the same thing when you buy AMOS. The
thing is, you don't have to send Europress money again each time you release a
game. If GMS was a one-time price, that would be fine, but it isn't. It's a
scheme to get the author of GMS cash for doing nothing. Would you have bought
AMOS if you had to pay more money each time you released a program?

Did you buy AMOS 3D? Do you pay more money every time you release a 3D game?
Did you register AmCAF? Do you have to send more money to the author for every
program you release using AmCAF? No? Hmm. Very interesting.

From the GMS agreement:
"Here is the table:
+-------------------+--------------+
| Program Cost (US) | License (US) |
+-------------------+--------------+
|     $0 -  2.99    =     FREE     |
|     $3 - 13.99    =     $20      |
|    $14 - 18.99    =     $30      |
|    $19 - 23.99    =     $40      |
|    $24 - 29.99    =     $60      |
|    $30 - 34.99    =     $80      |
|    $35 - 39.99    =     $120     |
|    $40+           =     $200+    |
+----------------------------------+"

If I charge $40, it will COST me $200 to release my own work? That doesn't
come close to "the license cost would be recovered after selling just 2 copies
of the program", now, does it?

From the GMS agreement:
"The good news is that freeware licenses are available at no charge...you
still must write in and ask for a license, so that I can put you on the
registered page."

So, I still have to ask for permission to release my own work.

From the GMS agreement:
"If you release a sequel to your game (e.g. `Super Tetris II') you will need
to renew your license.  Major revisions (e.g.  V2.0) also require new
licenses.  Minor revisions (e.g. V2.1), bug fixes, and patches do not require
you to re-license your game."

He's really covering all the angles, isn't he?

From the GMS agreement:
"You should be able to recover your license cost after selling only 2 to 4
games."

Except in the examples in his chart, where it could take as many as five
copies.

From the GMS agreement:
"Keep in mind that all license fees go towards the continuation of the
project, so by paying the fees you can ensure that GMS has a good future."

Maybe so. Still, sounds almost like a government inspired plan.

From the GMS agreement:
"If you release a game without a license you will face some penalties. It not
only damages the project, but moves it closer to the PC (I have one sitting on
my desk)."

Well. `If you don't give me money, I'm gonna go play with the PC boys.' I can
not tell you how many `faithful' amiga users spout this crap at the drop of a
hat. If you're just in it for the money, you probably should go play with the
PC boys. Who cares about integrity, right?

From the GMS agreement:
"We will also run a list of people that are found to have not paid for
licenses. Since the list is publicly available, it may be e-mailed to other
web pages and newsgroups for posting. To be fair to you, we give up to 2 weeks
notice if you haven't paid the license fee. After that, you go on the list. If
you break the rules and want to rectify your mistake, you can be pulled from
the list by paying for the license plus another 20% for the trouble you
caused."

How does that sound to you? Are you ready to rush out and get GMS? It makes me
feel all warm and fuzzy, that's for sure.

Don't send me giant responses to this letter, touting the wonders of GMS. I
don't care. The licensing agreement (slavery) does not appeal to me.

Granted, this isn't the whole of the licensing text. Rest assured that I did
not cut out any of the `good points', nor did I remove text to make my point.
You can read them for yourself, but be advised, the licensing agreement is
conspicuously absent from the GMS_User.lha archive. The developer archive does
contain the licensing agreement, if you want to read up on it.

In conclusion, I am not telling you to avoid GMS. I am not telling you to
avoid TGE. I am not slagging Peter or the GMS author. I AM pointing out the
pitfalls/costs of using GMS. Use if if you want. I won't and the reasons I
won't are abundantly clear.

I will not reply to any messages about GMS. I am not trying to start a
flamefest/argument/debate. This is my opinion. It is not my intention to
influence your decision, only to make you aware of the facts.

If the colours are all different, using the point command or something will
detect the colour under the mouse (xmouse,ymouse), I think.

There are 2 auctions on EBAY (http://www.ebay.com) that is selling AMOS
Pro and AMOS Pro Compiler. Just go to EBAY and search on AMOS Pro or
Amiga (to find all Amiga related items). Make sure you click Search
Descriptions, too. The short title says Amiga Programming and Amiga
Compiler (something like that).

Just in case you know someone looking to buy the software.

I had a more of a go with Blitz recently and was quite suprised to find
that it had far more bugs and problems than AMOS ever had. It doesn't
support many basic things (such as proper shape clipping) and is a pain to
use. Even procedures/functions are very poorly implemented. How did it ever
get popular?
It seems apart from a few better structures there is only the fact that the
screens are OS friendly that gives it any advantage over AMOS.
Perhaps a slight speed advantage too but its not as much as some people
make out.

I agree. AMOS has screen problems and lack of updates (soon to be changed
of course!), Blitz is just full of all sorts of problems and then there is
nothing between them and C (at least for developing games).
I don't have the time to code in C (although I am slowly doing a bit) but
get annoyed at the screen problems with AMOS.

Problem is that the Bvision which is what I'm going to get does not have a
scan doubler....

AMOS 3D certainly could have been much better, however it is possible to
get some reasonable results out of it once you get to know it well.
My main problem is the terrible object editor program. It is so inprecise.

Anyway, check out Star Fighter from Geosync for a good example.
Also just the other day there was an AMOS 3D example put on AMINET. It is
of a flight simulator and although the graphics are simple it does go
pretty fast and smoothly and is a good example of creating a whole 3D
world.

I found that games in space are not too hard to do because you can get away
with not that many objects, however cames on land are much harder because
they require scenery. They can be done though!

-----

One last thing. I'm really starting to worry how I'll be able to work on
AMOS once I get my GFX card and monitor. I can't take a TV and monitor
everywhere with me.
I understand that the updated version of AMOS will have provisions for a
screen friendly editor. How long until this is ready? Is there no fix I
could get to do this? Also, will this new version of AMOS have more OS
friendly screens (in game screens) or will that have to wait until AMOS NG?

Thanks,
-Murray

TGE or not TGE

Sat Aug 1, 1998 5:02 pm
Peter Cahill <cahill4@iol.ie>


Hello,

As some of you know, games that are written using TGE may cost,
depending on if there freeware or not. This cost is due to TGE
using GMS, which I find it worth the extra cost.

GMS stands for 'Games Master System', it is a extremly fast
system, coded in a mixture of C and Asm. GMS does graphics
better than amos in from the fact that in amos on my 030@50
I can have about 60 bobs(8x8), and If I move 1 Its as jerky
as hell, but, with GMS on my 030@50, I have had about 300+
8x8 bobs on a higher res screen AND ALL the bobs were changeing
sizes and ALL moving at diffrent speeds, and they were nice
and Smooootthhh. GMS supports ECS,AGA and Gfx card modes.

The costs of 'GMS' are around 2/3 times the price of your game
if your game is free, then you dont need to pay anything. you
*DONT* need to mention GMS anywhere in your code And I honestly
think that if your game isnt gonna sell more than 2 copies then
you should release it as freeware.

The reason for this mail is that one person in particular
(hi giark) has been at me about it costing for quite some
time. Saying that he wont use it because 'He wont give
credit of his work to anyone else'. After *MANY*
2 and 3 hour IRC sessions with this person I have decided
to settle this with a survey, of how many people actually
want TGE.

And Id like to see how many people wouldnt like TGE and
'wouldnt pay $5 for a GMS lisence for a shareware or

Perhaps I am a poor sample of the population at large, but I for
one never aim to make money off anything I write in amos. I code for the
fun and thrill of unleashing my imagination in a way only a groovy
computer like the amiga could let me.
So bottom line is this, if TGE will help my convert my ideas to
reality without alot of frustration then of course I'd want to use it, and
if it proved proffesional enough a package (ie stable, well documented) I
wouldn't mind paying to use it.
My 2 cents,

I would like to see GMS and TGE first... I have never used either. Does it
cost for me to get a copy that I can use in my AMOS programs? Or is the
cost incurred when I release a non-freeware piece of software.

If the license is a one off payment (which covers any releases I make)
then I have no real problems...

The tge extension is a must release for AmosPro. However, I do hope that
this license prob does not get carried over to the new Amos (i.e. I hope
the new amos doesn't use GMS while there is a licensing cost). Maybe there
are some out there that only release freeware, but it is not for everyone
to suddenly say that charging for a game is bad. It is not, a lot of hard
work goes into many Amos games. And so the license charge does prove a bit
of a bugger. But as I said; if it is one off and only a very small cost then
this is ok.

PAC, keep on with tge...(only hurry up ;o) )

But I can see where giark is coming from.


Let's all party and forget about all our differences, PAC bring the alcohol,
Giark bring the munchies....All friends again. :oD

I think that the best and easiest way is one Scooter told you about, but if
you are
using 50 different colors only because of finding area, I would suggest you
method with which you can use only one color, if you want:

1) Create array which will hold X and Y coordinates of one point in the
middle of each area.
2) When mouse is clicked, use Paint command on mouse coordinates (of
course, translate hardware coordinates into screen coordinates), with color
which doesn't belong to any area.
3) Use Point() for every point in your array to find which point has that
color.
4) That's your area. Now just paint it again in the old color. If you use
color
which have diferent index, but same value as original, this wouldn't be
visible by the user (or, I guess, player ;) .

Don't ya dare give up on TGE PAC! We're all waiting for it...

Sure some of us may feel pissed off about GMS and it's

Hi everyone,

Just a quick gripe to all those on the list, Ive been away from this list for
almost a year and I see things just havent changed, capn bubba still not
finished, arguing between blitz and amos and also the wishful thinking that
someone somewhere is going to market an enhanced version of AMOS, for me I wish
the latter was going to happen, but unfortunately the reality of it all is NOT
LIKELY, well not for the current Amiga architecture that we all know and love,
so just like all the other Amiga owners, we will have to wait and see what
transpires (if anything) of the future platform and its development tools, so
until then we use what we have and play around on this fun but old looking
machine.

I say forget writing games, forget writing 3rd rate extensions for Amos Pro,
develop something that displays the current and high-end amiga technology,
develop multimedia applications, theres a far greater future in that, after all,
why did we all buy an amiga in the first place? graphics and sound !!!

What disks? The articles are all in the magazine and we got no disk with
them. They did say to write in and ask for the disk if you couldn't be
bothered writing in the code, but I guess you just want the articles, not
the disks?

I guess I'll have to get them scanned in then.

And yes, I do have them all.

extension, and you know I'll pay for GMS, and I know that I don't have
to pay for GMS until I decide to release my work! Also, the crippled version
of GMS only have some unneeded features crippled. The game extension
is a MUST for my developments to be continued. Squeek2 and G®RD-AGA
needs the extension to be done before being able to be realized! You know
that Cybergfx and AGA boosting for Amos will make Squeek2 and Gord beat
every other similar games by hundredfolds! Again: You MUST complete
the game extension! Though nobody can push you... If you finally decide
to give the extension up, then why not give all the sources to someone who
is up to the task of completing the extension!?

*Squeek 2, relies on fast bobs and preferably cybergfx. My game already runs*
*on cybergfx, but the bobs are so slow that only three objects can be moving*
*at one time on the screen before every goes slow-motion*. This is not good
for a puzzle/action game which is going to beat Dizzy in every field. But as
from what you have told me, your extension would make my game AWESOME.
Thing of it if: Threasure Island Dizzy was a bit easier, a bit lastier and
featured
32000 colour bobs and 32000 colour backdrops! Also, more that five moving
objects on every screen! This game will be awesome with TGE and to reward
you and the others supporting the project, free copies of the finished game
will
be sent to you! (Though the game will probably be featured on >12 disks).

Hi,

If you are that concerned about copyright, do this:-

Copy all your material to floppy
Place in an envelope
Mail it to yourself
Store away for safe keeping, DO NOT OPEN

What does this prove?

Well, the post office will date stamp your package and any copyright problems
that could occur will be avoided as you have proof that your material was
produced prior to the date on the envelope

It's the AMOS upgrade cd with all the new extensions and bugfixed AMOS code.

Ever been to AMOS Factory? Obviously not. Speak not of what you know not of.
I've already received the first "wishful thinking" upgrade to the AMOS
library. Have you looked at the GUI extension or TGE?

Go ahead. And do it using your AMOS. I'll do it using mine - bugfixed, with
GUI and all that. Let's see which one looks better.

I may not have kept up to date on the Amiga scene as i once did, but one
thing i do know, the Amiga community is in a state of flux and it will
remain this way until new hardware and development are available. Dont get
me wrong Amos is alot of fun to use compared to anything ive seen on the
Amiga over the years, but its aged due to the inventor jumping ship or just
plain getting on with his life, if you're gonna write games, do it on a
platform where the hardware is consistent, what about the sony playstation
development machine, you get all the tools and if the game is any good you
get Sonys backing!!!! you cant go wrong there, games in Amos look bad,
regardless of the extensions, they're just plain slow and 8bit looking, the
truth hurts i know, but im just giving you a word of advice as ive been
developing professionally now for 16 years across many platforms.

Is it possible to replace the hard drive unit within the A590 case with

If it is possible, there is a connection on the main board for SCSI and IDE
so what size and type of drive should I look for if this is possible?

Thanks in advance.

Dave,
I sympathize, esp. with your comment about Blitz vs Amos, but in
defense of the list it is still filled with incredibly helpful and cheery
blokes if you have a problem, and it still shows off what I think is the
Amiga's greatest acheivement, people using their computer's to create.
Amos as you will recall was originally dubbed "The Creator" and everything
else aside the list still shows it living up to that name.

                        Thanks,

No, CDDA is internal in TGE as are quite a few other features that you left out,

No, I have provided methods of suppling a 'small' version of GMS, this
DOES make your code about 60-70k bigger, but enables all GMS features. Whats
missing is just the docs, prefs and some other extras.

He wrote more than 'just the graphic routines' and if you release a game
which wont sell more than 2 copys it should be freeware.

No, wrong again, you make it sound much worse than it is, all he

The Developer lisence isnt in the user archive because its for
*Developers*, I found that fairly simple to understand. as for
'nor did I remove text to make my point', I think you have,
youve given a completely exadurated one sided view.

that anyone who uses TGE is a slave, and you HAVE suggested that the
author of GMS only wrote it for money and doesnt care about the amiga
so yes you *are telling people to avoid GMS* which is also telling
people to avoid TGE.

YOUR not starting a argument ?!?
you did, remember about 3 months ago when this started,
only now you took it onto the list and if you think
that your not infulenceing decisions then your wrong again,
telling people that there *slaves* if they use TGE is
influencing a decision.

And to stop endless treads of this I have mailed a TGE or not TGE
mail to see if anyone wants it.

PS: Are you like this when you might have to pay for any software ?
cos how can you expect people to buy your software when you
wont buy others software.

I have both AMOS PD CDs. You only need the second one, though. It has
all that the first has on it (in the way of AMOS PD) plus more. I think
it is worth it as it has lots of sprites and bobs to use.

Well 50 shapes and only 16 colours means trouble, do the shapes
ever overlap? and do shapes of the same colour ever appear close to one
another, infact, is the colour of the shape critically important,
otherwise you could partition up the screen into 4 sections, giving each
section say 12 or 13 shapes, and then each shape can have it's own colour
and wallah! Otherwise I'll need some time to think about this one, do the
shapes move at all? Are the really large? You could have them all
secretly copied to the Bob bank and then use a collision detect to find
out what's beneath the pointer.
hmmm is right

TGE/GMS

Wed Dec 31, 1969 11:59 pm
"Alastair Murray" <malcolm.murray@virgin.net>


I think the GMS fees are fair and I will certainly use TGE.
The one thing I think is unfair is that of user registration but that
isn't too bad either.

Basically, if you are making any program that is free, there's nothing
to worry about and you can use all the enhanced features for nothing.

If you are producing software that you charge for then you have to pay
the price of about two registations. Thats nothing. Its not like you
will be knowcking up games every month (if you are then they are most
likely not of good enough quality to charge money anyway) so you don't
have to pay much at all.

LOL
Errr... it HAS happened!
There is now a group of coders on this list who own the source code and are
releasing first an enhanced CD of AMOS and then more in the future a
complete rewrite called AMOS NG.
This will be written in C so will be portable in the future.
Maybe you should have read a few more letters before writing this?

Exactly, graphics and sound. Ideal for games.

Anyway, the vast majority of amos coders do it in there spare time as a
hobby. Who wants to create a boring multimedia app as a hobby? Leave that
for the professionals who have the resources and time available.

3D-Ground Scroll with Rainbows

Wed Aug 5, 1998 9:22 pm
"Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>


Howdy,
Last night I got a bright idea and drafted up some code that uses
a rainbow to create a scrolling ground effect ala Space Harrier or 3D
world runner. It's a simple effect and I've seen it down a 1,000 times
with colour shifting, but this routine's genuis is that it eats up only
colour register thanks to the use of rainbows. Also it's easy to control
the speed/smoothness of it all and I get 60 fps off my loop. Anyway if
anybody's interested in how to do such a thing drop me a line.

                        Thanks,
                                Scott Matott sXe
PS
        Has anybody out there ever gotten more than one Rainbow to appear
on the same scan line, the manual says it can be done just not easily.
Still it I could do it this routine could prove much, much more powerful.

I have the AMOS PD CD Volume 1, and found it entertaining
and at times useful. If you would like to check out the
contents, there is an amiga guide index with search tool
on my pages:

I use AsimCDFS, it works like a charm. However, not all cd-rom
drives can read CDDA as data. Older drives (or older designs)
won't do it. It was not a technical limitation, it was the Phillips
CD technology license that forbid the direct export of CDDA as
a digital stream.

For starters, do NOT put (c)!!! use the Copyright symbol
which is © (Alt & E together on GB keymap). (c) isn't really
the Copyright sign! It is not legally accepted as far as I
recall! Or am I wrong on this? - Anyone?

Anything you produce is automatically copyrighted to you. If
you want to be doubly sure, post a copy of your work to
yourself 9don't open it though) and keep it safe. You could
also post a copy to your solicitor (like, yeah, we all have
one :) for double safety :-)

If it's copyright rules you need for your dox, isn't there a
standard set somewhere?

I too had both, but sold the 1st one coz it was the same as
the follow up. like ya said, the follow up had everything the
1st had, and more :)

It's well worth having the Amos PD CD Rom if you want .abk
files alone or some neat source code to learn/leach from!

I haven't looked at my CD for a whilee now, but I bet there's
still loads I have yet to look at on there.

And I just know i have NOT looked at the Totally Amos disk
mags yet either! Amoszine was the best Amos mag if ya ask me,
but then again, I would say that :-)

Now you have to admit, that is a very true statement. Well
said.

What is wrong with paying for GMS anyway? You pay, you
use, you
benefit by better productions and hopefully more people
buy and you
make more money.

Well, that's my theory anyway ;D

I know I shall be using TGE when it's released and if I don't
like the
GMS side of things, I'll simply won't use it and therefore
won't have
to pay.

Why make your minds up now? Wait for the TGE demos to
arrive and see
what you could be missing out on...

From what I have seen and head so far, I'm impressed, after
all, AGA
games in Amos is something we have all been wanting for a
long long
time - right?

To be or not TGE.

Thu Aug 6, 1998 5:37 am
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


On the issue of TGE:

I'd have to say that it sounds like a welcome addition to any AMOS user or
developer (just as both AMCAF and GUI have been). The fact that it uses GMS
as part of it's infrastructure isn't a problem with me, and I would have to
agree with the others who have stated their freeware/charge money solution.
(If you don't sell more than a few copies, then it's probably freeware).

I can't say that the restrictions imposed by GMS are TOTALLY unreasonable
(the fees namely), although I can say that I don't really like them. In a
half-sense, it sounds like the author of GMS is just trying to make a few
(sometimes more than) bucks off of his program. But as Andy Gibson said,
"if you don't want to pay, then don't use it". I would have to agree. If I
choose not to use it, I'm sure I can find something else to substitute.

I do promote Peter in his efforts, and I will encourage him to continue.
This project has been a long time in coming, and although I may need TGE as
badly as some of my fellow developers, I will welcome it's timely arrival.

PS: I can understand Giark's perspective, but I must say it came off VERY
half-cocked. Although I might support a few of his points, he sounded like
the perfect example for the next "Lazy Programmer Poster Child".

I'm wrinting a hex editor that is just finished.
I want to include read and write tracks, so you might edit save disk
that use trackdisk.

Also it would be fun o read trackdisk games to hack around.

Do se if you find it :)

Also I'm looking for sources.

Cheers !

Think it works now....
I just use normal square zones around each shape and
then find the color in that area with point.

It works as long as shapes next to each other don't have
the same colour.

The shapes don't overlap or move.

Renamer

Thu Aug 6, 1998 4:19 pm
"Mr. Giark To You" <giark@hicksville.ddns.org>


A friend on IRC asked for a program to rename an entire directory. The result
is Renamer (FBN-Rnam.lha). It can be found on aminet. What it does it let you
pick a directory, root name and base number, after which it goes through the
directory and renames every file, retaining the extension (last four
characters).

3-D Ground Scroll Code Idea

Thu Aug 6, 1998 4:39 pm
"Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>


Wow!
I guess I didn't really expect much interest in this one, well now
that the spot light is on I just hope the idea is actually a good one,
worked like a charm for me but who knows...

Ok here's an outline of what i did, oh and the ground it produces
is sadly not a checker pattern like Space Harrier (This could easily be
done though if only we could put two rainbows on the same scan line)
But insteadis the same thing w/o the checkering so just a scroll of two
bars of colour.
Anyway, here's the idea:

Pre-program a simple 3-D scroll, read out this info and use the
Rain command to make


Here's a rough sketch of how I did it:

First I used Dpaint IV in this way
I drew up a red big square then I cut it out and
stuck a White copy of it onit's top, making a two colour
rectangle wplit down the middle (got the idea)

Then I set Frames to 100 and used perspective mode and the
Move requester with Fill option to make a scrolling ground
(Have you all done this before, if not I can tell you how)
I also deleted the top garbage looking part of the scroll
(about the first 18 lines of it) Leaving a scroll that
was about 9 'bars' of colour deep. Does that make sense?

Ok then I saved each frame into Ram numbered 1 to 50.

Then I set up a loop in amos to load each frame and
starting from the bottom of the screen move up using
the Point command, grabb the y cordinate at each change in
colour.

So I ended up with 9 numbers telling me where
each "bar" in the scroll started. As well I could
find the where each bar ended by taking the starting point
of the next bar and subtracting one. (The last bar always
has the same end point which is the top y cord. of my scroll)

I copied all of these starting points into a Memory bank
using poke as the are all numbers less than 256.

I did the same for each frame, copying them all into
a bank of size 50*9 (50 frames, nine bars per frame)

Do you get the idea yet? Now I have a memory bank which
tells me where to start and finish drawing horizontal
bars of colour to produce a scrolling ground.

So from there the rest is simple, but the rainbow part is what
makes it all worth while

I just set up a loop to read these start and end points
back out and then draw the bars of colour into the Rainbow
which is fast, fast, fast!

So the code looks like this

First set up a Rainbow 200 scan lines big with nothing in it
then display it (again 200 lines big, or 255 is it for Pal?)

I used Colour register 2 for my rainbow, so then clear
the screen in colour 2.

Use the Rain command to black out the part of the Rainbow you
won't use, (So my Scroll is about 82 pixels high, so I used rain
to stick $000 into the first 118 scan lines of the rainbow)

Now use a loop like this

For FRAME=0 to 49
For _BAR=0 to 8
Rem Get start and End for colour Bar
_START = Fetch_Bar_Start[_BAR,FRAME]
If _BAR=8 Then _END=118
Else _END =Fetch_Bar_Start[_BAR,FRAME] - 1
Rem Pick a Colour for the Bar, Notice for a looping scroll you will
Rem to Do a little more work here
If _BAR mod 2 = 0 Then _COLOUR=4096
Else _COLOUR=3000

rem Now a loop that puts the right colour in each scan line of the bar
rem you must go from _end to _start because of Amos's cordinate system
rem Which has 0 on the top of the screen and 199 on the bottom.
For Z=_END to _START
Rain(0,Z)=_COLOUR
Next Z
Next _BAR
Next FRAME

Does any of this make any sense? The idea is simply to preprogram
your scroll and then use rainbow to display it, the genius is that it uses
only one colour and it has serious potential.
Because the whole thing is stored as a list of Frames you can move
at any speed you want, 4 Frames at a time, 1 Frame at a time, ect. ect.
You can also move backwards easily too. Plus at 50 frames the resolution
of the scroll is very good and everyhting looks very smooth no matter what
speed you go at. The only caveat to all this is to make sure to handle
things right in looping from the last frame back to the first (ie careful
with FRAME=54 or FRAME=-2)
There are no restrictions on what colour the Bars can be, and by
using another memory bank as a Map it'd be very easy to program 'levels'
to scroll through, with gaps in the ground (ie black Bars) and baddies
waiting at certain bars, ect. ect.
My plan is not to have the entire ground scroll but instead just
use a narrow strip down the center of the screen. This looks alot
better, as I have the strip tilted in perspective giving sort of
guidelines to your eyes for the depth of the whole thing.

Anyway, hope this makes sense, any questions ask away, I have the
code, wish I'd brought it with me, but I'm off on break til next thursday
so it maybe awhile before I can answer you. Still I'll be around for a
while today.
                        Thanks,
                                Scott Matott sXe

Got a question

How do I get the GUI extension and the new AMOS library to work properly?
The guide file for the GUI extension was not complete. It lacks telling me
which slot to put the Gui.lib file to in the AMOS configuration. Also, if I
use the AMOS 2.1 library, and I run AMOS_PRO after installing it in my libs:
directory, AMOS locks with a black screen.

Help here would be appreciated. I won't be able to try your suggestions
till this evening, but let me know something here.

Thanks in advance!

They are extremly hard to get hold of and on top of that you need a good PC
to connect it too.
We are using AMIGAs because either we don't have/can't afford PC's or more
likely because we don't like them.

I don't quite understand you, you make it sound like we are trying to
produce commerical games. It can be done (and has been many times) but most
people here are just making them for fun.

Even if we did start programming a Playstation, the game quality would not
improve very much because we don't have access to professional equipment.
You need teams of artists, programmers and top quality 3D
scanning/rendering hardware to make most good modern games.

> you get all the tools and if the game is any good you
> get Sonys backing!!!! you cant go wrong there, games in Amos look bad,
> regardless of the extensions, they're just plain slow and 8bit looking, the

If they are 8 bit looking that is because we don't have the backing of
professional game artists. It would be no different if we moved to a
playstation.
You make it sound as though the graphics draw themselves.

As for speed. A playstation is obviously faster but the sort of games that
we write anyway would make no impact on that platform because all the kids
want is flashy 3D graphics and techno music (ok... a stereotype :)

And anyway, I am getting a PPC tommorow and intend to start developing some
games for that. Is it going to look any better than my AMOS stuff? Probably
not. It will run faster (although I am good at optimising AMOS stuff anyway
so don't complain about its speed) and may be able to use higher resolutions
but it won't improve my dire graphics skills!!!

> truth hurts i know, but im just giving you a word of advice as ive been
> developing professionally now for 16 years across many platforms.

Exactly. You're developing professionally. We're not.

I know I could get faster games if I moved over to coding on a PC. I have
tried but for me it takes most of the fun away from it.

Programming on the AMIGA means it is more fun for me (and I do it for fun!)
and it also lets me support my favourite platform in some small way.

You may only be interested in the money side so it obviously better for you
to code on PCs/Playstations but we do it for a hobby.

Now just stop trying to put everyone down doing something they enjoy.

Actually, I think in the GUI 1.7 archive it does not say what slot it is
in. I don't know if it says you need to use GUIComp or the GUI Patch
(for amos.library) still or not. And, do you need to use the patch if
you download the amos.library 2.1 from The AMOS Factory?

What is the GUIComp and the GUI Patch? I downloaded the amos.library
from the AMOS factory website.

Well, the GUI Path patched amos.library to work with programs using the
GUI Extension. GUIComp is what you use to compile programs using the
GUI Extension.

At least I think that is right. I am sure Pietro can explain it better.
Pietro, perhaps include a list of files needed for GUIExt 1.7 as the 1.7
and 1.62 archives are different.

Should your talent support your platform, or should your platform support your
talent?

Er... anybody who's good enough to make a commercial game will make a

Come on. Have you ever noticed that this list is full of messages from people
begging for extensions and things, in order to make their programs look more
professional, serious and modern?

Besides if you're having fun with something, bikes, cars, anything, you're
gonna want the best possible stuff, whatever your criteria are. I'm having a
lot of fun while porgramming (even COMMERCIAL games), so I simply want the
best stuff according to my criteria. Makes sense?

Non Amos- Help! PPC killed AmiTCP!

Thu Aug 6, 1998 10:03 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,


I've gone with the flow and got a Blizzard PPC for my A1200.

It mostly works fine, although it just won't cold boot (I have to
reboot
whenever I turn it on), and more importantly, it has killed AmiTCP. As
soon
as I upgraded, I found using the net was impossible, but when I tried my
demo
of miami, that worked fine!
It should work on my PPC's 040 as it worked on my old 040.

I got AmiTCP with Netconnect V1, do you thing that upgrading to
V2 would sort the problem out?


I'd be greatful if someone could help me with this little prob.


See ya.

Err , I have, but's it's a arse, you need a sampler (pref 16bit) then you
sample thw whole song fron the headphone jack as a 8svx (or prefrabbly a 16
bit WAV) then cut off teh bit's you don't like in your favorite samel
editor, then smak it into mp3enc :) I Have neaver managed to read direct
CDDA beacuse my device is atapi (i think) i all ways come out with White

played back though the amig's hardware ? I think .

Yeah, sure send me a copy too if you'd be so kind. I'm not
100% sure, but I think I saw a similar routine a while back
either on one of the Amos CD's or an Amos disk mag!

Anyone else seen it to remind me?

Hello Keith.

> I'm serious.

I'm not sure, but if this is for taking snapshots of my stage then I
have the solution. I created a procedure which automatically
generates a 32-color screen (8+8 dual-playfield + 16 color sprite
palette) during my stage. Just hit "s" for snapshot...

I used it to generate a few snapshots months back and sent them to
Mush (for marketing purposes).

Anyway, if this is what you want, let me know...

Yeah, look at Worms, Lemmings etc. All Amiga games ported to
PC and PSX too. It CAN be done and in the Worms example, with
Blitz basic...So yeh, a basic language can prove to be up to
the task no probs.

Take a look at Flight of The Amazon Queen - the files on disk
are Amos files! So Amos can produce great games, but like you
say Alastair, gfx don't draw themselves.

And I don't think all Amos games are 8 bit looking either, so
I'm with Alastair on this one too. Amos is great and I won't
have a word said against it.

Who does this guy think he is anyway?

Well said m8 :)

hehehehe. Well, what did ya really expect from the PC? Boring
boring boring. I dont know anyone who uses the PC for
creative reasons and certianly don't know any PC users who
have coded/released any games either! And that even includes
using Klick N Play and The Games Factory :)

Yup, well said again. How very vry true.

> Now just stop trying to put everyone down doing something
they enjoy.

Yeah, we don't come to your work and tell you how to sweep
up! :-)

Piss off and go back to your professional stuff, we're happy
plodding along with Amos coz we enjoy it. If we didn't, do
you think we need you to tell us it's time to move on?

No chance, we have our own minds and if we weren't happy, we
would have moved long ago...

*Flame On!* ;D

AND you need to BUY an official license from SONY (at least you do for
programming for Nintendo - I'm not 100% sure about PSX)

Not only do you need a licence, but you also have to have to game approved
by Sony before you are allowed to market it!

"Dave Paterson" <y2guru@sprynet.com>


Hello again!!!


Well, now that pretty much everyone on this list has aired their views on my
comments, i just want to re-inforce a few issues:-

1. I wanted feedback on how you feel and how open you all are to change
2. I own 3 amigas of varying size and use them all to test my codes performance
and how they operate
under different memory configurations and hardware setup.
3. I code for fun myself on my A4000 and that includes my own modules and
graphics, even though Im not
the worlds greatest musician or artist.
4. I AM an AMIGA enthusiast and have been since 1986
5. I have also used AMOS since "The Creator" was first released
6. I think very highly of both the AMIGA platform and AMOS, but on the otherhand
Im also disappointed that
after all these years, AMOS has not grown and the compiler hasn't been
re-written
7. Would I write games for the PC, NO WAY !!!

So, there you have it, didn't mean to piss on anyones fires, that was not the
intention. Just remember there are so many people on this list that excel in
varying areas, graphics, sound, coding etc... are these people being used to
their full extent ?

Im as interested as the next person to see some great quality games etc... come
from this group as I know you are all keen, even if no money is involved (which
is not the priority)

Not AMOS related:Imagine manual

Fri Aug 7, 1998 10:33 am
Rod Whiteley <rwhiteley@magnet.com.au>


Dear all,
I've been trying to create some anims (of a human form) using Imagine 3.0 that
I got off a coverdisk many moons ago to no avail. Does anyone know where I can
buy a manual for this beast? I really need to know how to use bones to deform
the human object in a meaningful way.
All help greatfully received

I have the same problem. The regged version of IDEFIX should solve the prob
for you, but
OptyCDPlayer does have the same `track download` mechanism. But none work for
me :(
I have a rare cd-player that uses the ATAPI cable in the a4ooo. Toshiba 12x cd
rom. But
shurely, SOMEONE should write a trackdownload program!!! It is damn useful.
But if you
have a scsi cd-rom, you should have no problem :)

Each stage pushes the AMOS code to its fullest. We're in the home stretch. We
still need someone to convert the thx to mod format, and graphic artists might
still contribute. Keith can tell you what he needs from you.

You need to pay Sony for a lisence, and copyprotection(not required)
I think, cos of every game baught sony get £3, and in Final Fantasy
7 there is NO copy protection ( I heard) so I think it may be voluntry.

I know a guy whos m8s with Pysgnosis, I'll ask him to see
what way it really is.

Yep It can be done, either use the graphics
grabber in HRTmon, or theres a screen snapshot
function on aminet which can do amos's screens.

Well, I think Miami is better anyway ;o}
but I DO use AmiTCP aswell. Miami is great for
just going online, but amitcp is good for the whole
amitcp:bin/ drawer. So I go online with miami,
and use the amitcp tools ;oP

Well.... the GUIComp Patch creates a new patched version of your compiler and
related files. It also create a patched verision of the amos.library.. the
gui.library used by the *GUI compiler only.*

The GUI compiler is useful if you want create true WB applications, since it
removes some AMOS problems, like unusefull patches, hacks, and activate the
possibility to run several AMOS programs togheter.

Its what Jeff uses for most of the game icons
on his Hard Drive installers.

its on aminet as: hrtmon.lha if I remember correctly.

Keith, is there anything else you need from me? I can't recall if I sent my
MIB shots to you or not? If I didn't, tell me and I'll get them to you.

Btw, the site looks mucho cool. I have to say that that _black_ font on
that _blue_ background is horrific (I can't read it at all). Wouldn't mind
doing something about this would you, O Great and Busy One? hehe..

Also, I wanted to apologize, namely to Giark, for not being able to get in
my level when I originally planned, not to mention this final release. I
just didn't have the time and, with no time for optimizations and the extra
work for implementing the baddies I wanted, I just couldn't finish it.

However, I do hope everyone has liked and made much use of the art I've
submitted and the shots I've rendered. Shameless to say, without my PC, I
couldn't have done it!, and NONE of you would have a cool 3D Bubba! hehe

Yes Pietro, what about those new AMOS logos? Did you (or your group) ever
decided on any one of the entries? If not, I have a few (about 9) I made
after the original deadline (rendered, 3D, on my PC. AHH!) that look
particularly cool and reflect almost any style you may want the new AMOS to
portray. If you want, I'll send them to you in a .zip (.bmp or .jpg?)

Urk, I invalidated my hard drive today, and have currently BARELY got
it back. The backup routines aren't working, and it is ridiculously
fragile.

This is a public service announcement:

Make a backup now !




(Yes it was the Cap'n Bubba drive. Luckily the Cap seems unafected.)
It seems like my email hit the worst of it. It went in a nasty way.
Anyone got any good disk tools that work with AFS ?

..ok, I fixed it. Alright I confess, I used an Amiga to create the site,
and just assumed a peecee would be able to handle it.

Well... the problem with the logos is that i've not received nothing! oh...
i've just received a logo forwarded to me by Mush.... but nothing more. Adam,
your
logos are welcome! If there is someone who want create a new AMOS logo, do it!
and send me your artwork.

If i'll receive enough materials, i'll put them on my homepage, so you can
decide.

is it worth learning amos?

Sat Aug 8, 1998 7:32 pm
Skid Vis <skid@angelic.com>


Hi there,

Here's the deal:

I've had AMOS for a long time, but I felt it was dying and pretty much
useless, plus I didn't know how to program. I really wanted to learn
something, and I was always told it's easier to learn to code on a PC..
because they don't offer Amiga programming classes on my side of Earth. So
I bought a PC and started taking classes on Visual Basic programming. I'm
glad I did.. I learned alot of "BASIC" stuff in the process.
So here are my questions:
Should I learn Amos Pro 2 or is 3 going to be a whole different thing?

All I have is Amos Pro 2 and the book to Easy Amos.
Could I learn AP2 with the easy amos book or is it too different?

Thanx!!

Understandable... Europress dropped support and AMOS received
some bad press (from major Amiga mags). However, AMOS is a
fine programming language and that is why loads of people
continue (or come back to) using it.

When the Amiga first came out, many programmers found the
concepts of the OS combined with learning C too much to handle
and thus began the Amiga's reputation as a complicated machine
to program. Obviously, these days we have high level languages
such as AMOS so that "hard-case" rep. is simply no longer true.

I think the best way to learn is to pick up some books and
dive right in. I am a fully self-educated programmer, having never
stepped inside a college in my life (well, I did visit a friend but you
know what I mean).

Just mess around until you have mastered the basics and then
you will be able to move on to more challenging projects.

Use the AMOS version you have... program every day until you
understand exactly what is going on, why it is happening and how
it is being done. Once you have this level of understanding you
will find that you can apply your skill to any language. You see,
all programming is relatively the same... there are always
fundamental elements that must be included in a programming
environment. You might use DISPLAY(), PRINT "", printf(""), puts_,
etc. but the important thing is that there is always a command to
display information on the screen/window.

Currently, I am using DBL at work in a mainframe environment, but
I can easily duplicate my DBL work in AMOS, BLITZ, C/C++, etc. by
relying on the fundamentals... So, master the programming basics.
AMOS is a fantastic tool for doing this and I wish I had something
like AMOS when I started programming (nearly 18 years ago on an
old TI-99/4a - preC64).

In a way, I envy you... you are at the very beginning of your
journey... a time filled with magic and mystery.

Good luck and I hope some of this babbling helps...

AmosNG is called amos, and uses some of the same extensions, and probably the
same or at least similar command structure, so if you wanna use an amiga, why
not.

> All I have is Amos Pro 2 and the book to Easy Amos.
> Could I learn AP2 with the easy amos book or is it too different?

Yes you can. It is 100% compatable with easy amos. ...Going back is hard.

Not here either. I took experience in C64 and C128 BASIC to AMOS. All self
taught, I'm afraid.

>Should I learn Amos Pro 2 or is 3 going to be a whole different thing?

Three is supposed to be similar; learning Pro 2 will probably give you a solid
foundation on which to build.

>All I have is Amos Pro 2 and the book to Easy Amos.
>Could I learn AP2 with the easy amos book or is it too different?

You could, yes. There are more commands than EA has, but the basics (pardon
the pun) are all there.

Does anyone know the status of the manual? If an amigaguide list of the
commands were available, would we be in trouble?

CBATNAM - Update 9/8/98

Thu Jan 1, 1970 7:59 am
(Keith Hill) <Braneloc@mirex.demon.co.uk>


Ok, I really have fixed the Bubba web pages now, they should all work
well with internet exploder and netscrape, as well as other browsers.
The site is being regularly updated, and I'll probably be putting
progress reports online before long, so check back often !

Cap'n Bubba will now (probably) consist of *6* different levels, by
different authors, a lot of sound and graphics, hand drawn & raytraced,
and coded in amos. Oh yeah, not to mention the game control program..

Work continues.. (I'm tired)

If you want to see the new graphics and sound on the website, the
address is:
http://www.mirex.demon.co.uk/bubba/
or
http://www.mirex.demon.co.uk/bubba/herobrau.html

Feel free to link to either URL with the banners provided on the links
page. BTW, the starfield on the backdrop of one piccie is a REAL
starfield computed in earth orbit. Don't say we don't spoil you.

The webpages look very nice... clear, colourful... professional.
Just one thing... maybe the steroids rating should be 10% in the
'hero brau' picture (which looks excellent, BTW)?

Who is creating these two new stages and what style of game
do these stages represent??

BTW - I'll send the snapshot procedure and MIB style photo
tomorrow (...hopefully).

I'm sorry to say, that your root of your problm is probally due to , the
nasty AFS system you use :/ I have heard of many a person on IRC sursing
beacuse they have lost thier data, beacuse 'Of THE DAM AFS SYSTEM, CURCE
YOU!', I don't know of any way to get your data back, the only thing i can
suggest, is you grit and bear the problrm, and instakll FFS (fast File
System) the amiga's defualt drriver, it is a lot, better, I have un
validated my Hard drive Countless times (about 50 off the top of my head)
and I have all ways got all the data back off my Hard drive, using disksalv,
I also suggest that you install Disksafe (search aminet for 'disksafe') this
program captures the harddrive's bitamp (or something) and helps stopping
the drive getting invalidated, since i installed it , i have only hafd to
use disksalv 1'nce , and that onyl 1 time, not the usal 3 , no fun with a
1.2 gig hd :/

Well I hope these commts help sorf out your hardrive ... Well at least make
it safer next time...

Hehe, I have a Job as a Web designer, and i must day that the amiga is
better at creating webpages than, all the PCee (SHIT) and MAC (Cool)
prograams, it is alot faster and easier to use, esp. for creating Gfx, Doing
litte 100x50 graphics in photoshop is not easy, but in the GREAT PPaint it
is fantasicly simple, just paint it and save the brush as a gif, not all
this stupid gIf84a export, that fukks yer palletes, then you have to run it
thiugh debalizer ...ect.ect. And I also get peeved when PC and other

How is it possible to load variables
A,B,C into

Colour Nr,$RGB ?

I mean like if A=1 B=4 C=6
then
Colour Nr,$146

Ah yes, I had to do this when my copy of CRAFT broke, I think this
should
do it:

CR=A*256
CG=B*16
CB=C

Colour Nr,CR+CG+CB.

Of course, its easier to do in craft (craft also has more useful
colour
commands, like 'Pal Set Red' and 'Pal Get Red' etc.)

Just type in the following piece of code:


Colour Nr,A*256+B*16+C

...keeping in mind that you can't use hex digits. Simply use decimal
equivalents.

Happy coding.

You create two banks. The first with the original text, the second with the
converted (length of bank1*2). Go through each letter in bank 1 (peek) and
copy it to bank 2 (poke). Except if it is the letter which you want to
convert; then you add two letters (poke, poke) to bank 2.

You could do it with AMCAF commands Bank stretch/shrink aswell, but that tends
to be a bad idea...

Hello,

I have tried to use music written in Protracker in AMOS. But When finnished
the first time, it only plays the first part of the music over and over, I
would like it to play the whole song over and over instead, how do I do it.

Kind regards

One solution is to use OctaMED. You may simply load your PT module to
OctaMED and save as MED module and use that in AMOS. One thing: turn off
editor samples in AMOS before running your program ;)

Sounds interesting...hm..but I've never used peek or poke,
don't think I can figure how to write this.

Wload "file",10
Reserve as data 11,length(10)*2
d=start(11)

for a=0 to length(10)
b=peek(start(10)+a)
if b=c
rem c being the ascii code of the character to convert
poke d,e
rem e being the ascii code of the first character you want to convert to
poke d+1,f
rem f being the ascii code of the second chracter you want to convert to
d=d+2
else
poke d,b
d=d+1
endif
next

bsave "file2",start(11) to d

Should do the trick. Warning: You are peeking and poking so the computer may
easily crash, if you are doing something wrong!

I too would love to be able to grab Amos screens with ease!

I've tried HRTMon and Action Replay, but due to my game
having more than one screen on display, both the above won't
work! Any ideas?

I know it IS possible to grab Amos screens coz Phil at F1
Software does it all the time, but he uses a PC with an Amiga
emulator or summat! BAH!

And what is that util you were talking about PAC from Aminet
which does the grabbing? I've yet to come across a grabber on
Aminet which grabs anything apart from an intuition based
screen! DOH!

TIA

I don't know what version of AMOS you're using, but AMOS Pro v2.00 and Easy
AMOS work fine with Protracker. Try some other mods, as some have weird
control characters imbedded in them.

have you tried this, Press Ctrl-C during your program, then
save each screen as an IFF, then load up your paint program, put
it to the max. numbers of colours (24 bit is nice), load the saved
screens as brushes, remap there palette to the pictures, and simply
paste the brushes over each other
(I've done that, but if your screens are different res. then you'll
have to set the paint package to a high res and scale the brushes
yourself). Then reduce the no. of colour to however many you need.

Its not very exact, but it does work.

(Or you could run AmigaUAE which runs AMOS stuff, and grab its screen)


See ya.

Sysinfo says it does:

CPU/MHz 68040 24.50
FPU 68040+68882
MMU 68040 (ENABLED)

And why would AmiTCP break if it doesn't have an FPU, it worked fine on
my old 020 accel. with no FPU?

Anyway, if anyone else has anyideas about this I'd like to hear um.

Hello...

Thanks...
..this code works fine for changing one letter
in a text.

Is there some smart way to repeat this code so
it will change 6 letters (that is 3 swedish letters in
upper/lowercase)?

Compiler?

Thu Aug 13, 1998 8:38 pm
"Mr. Giark To You" <giark@hicksville.ddns.org>


Here's a question that I've always wondered about:

What does the compiler do?

I mean, does it just pick and choose bits of code from extensions as needed?
Could there be a separate program to optimize for different processors after
the program has first been compiled? Can it be modified to do proper version
information? Perhaps have the shell scan through your source for '$VER
progname 2.54 or whatever and use that for the program version? If not, would
anyone be interested in a utility to fix the version number of a program? And,
would adding a bit of info to the version string corrput the program? Right
now, it only has a number, but some programs have the program name and version
number.

Well met and godspeed,

<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><smaller>Hello


It is with great regret that I have to inform you that the October
1998
issue of CU Amiga will be the last ever published. CU Amiga Magazine
recently dipped into a state of unprofitability, from which it looked
unlikely to emerge. The decision to close the magazine was taken by
EMAP in light of the magazine's overall financial performance and the
lack of prospects for any immediate or short term recovery.


It is ironic that CU Amiga should close as the world's best selling
Amiga magazine, but recently its financial returns have started to
outweigh its overheads. While it has been customary for costs to be
cut
in order to stave off the closure of magazines, it was decided that CU
Amiga would be laid to rest without suffering the indignities of
having
half its pages removed and the remaineder printed on toilet paper in
black and white. Neither will it be sold off to another company to be
published on a shoe string and run into the ground.


The CU Amiga editorial team were obviously very sorry to hear the news
and would like to pass on their sincere thanks to everyone who has
helped make CU Amiga such a success and so much fun to work on over
its
many years of existence.


Further details can be found on the CU Amiga website:

www.cu-amiga.co.uk

CU Amiga Magazine Closes


FAQ


Q: Why is CU Amiga closing?

A: Because it is no longer making a profit and therefore cannot
continue to be published.


Q: How can the best selling Amiga magazine not make a profit when
other
smaller magazines manage to do it?

A: Smaller magazines have different publishing set-ups, different
costs
and different distribution channels. Many are run at a slight loss or
at break-even by dedicated people as extended hobbies. CU Amiga is
published by a major magazine publishing company (EMAP), and as a
Publicly Limited Company (PLC) EMAP must show its shareholders that it
is making their money work, which means they cannot publish magazines
that make a loss.


Q: Why are costs not cut in order to save the magazine?

A: We feel it is better to leave on a high note than continually
reduce
the size of the magazine, remove the disks, reduce staff and
investment
in the title to keep it going regardless of quality.


Q: Surely though something can be done?

A: We could reduce the magazine to a low quality pamphlet that was
poorly researched and written but then it wouldn't be worth the
£4.50/£5.99 cover price.


Q: Why don't the staff all take a pay cut?

A: Would you do the same?


Q: Why have you lead us to believe the magazine would not close?

A: We never did that. We have always been honest and said that there
would come a time (if things did not pick up) when the magazine would
no longer be profitable. No-one knew when that time would be. Only
very
recently did it become apparent that the time was now.


Q: Is this a ploy to get Amiga users to buy PCs?

A: No. CU Amiga's publisher has no PC magazines anyway.


Q: Will "CU Amiga" be turned into "CU PC"?

A: No.


Q: I have a subscription. How do I get a refund on issues I will not
get?

A: See updated website FAQ for details.


Q: Why isn't the magazine sold to a publisher who can make a profit
from it?

A: Sacrifices would have to be made by any pubilsher that would
compromise the magazine so that it would no longer be the CU Amiga you
currently know.


Q: Will CU Amiga return when the new Super Amiga is released?

A: We hope so, although we cannot make any promises on that one. That
decision will be in the hands of our (ex) publisher (EMAP).


Q: Can I take this opportunity to thank the team for their dedication
to the magazine and the Amiga community?

A: Of course you can. Thank you.


Q: And what about us?

A: Well, there's always Amiga Format (as far as we know at this point
anyway). Nick and Ben will look after you. We really are very sorry to
have to leave you like this. We would all love to go on working on the
magazine well into the future but it's just not possible. One way or
another we'll be around when the Super Amiga surfaces, even though it
most likely won't be a Class of 98 style reunion of the whole team
under the old banner.


Q: So is it time to pack the Amiga away for good?

A: No! Keep on keeping on and we'll see you soon in happier
times.</smaller></fontfamily>

I don't get what you mean. All you have to do is write:

A$="$VER: Programname 2.54"

at the very first line of your AMOS source code. This will do the trick when
compiled.

Where is this particular tidbit located? I've never seen that before. Thanks.
But, what about Set Buffer? The manual says that set buffer has to be the

I'm not really sure about that? Perhaps it (A$="..." not Set Buffer) just has
to be the first command with a string?

Doesn't matter at all.

As far as I am aware, the AMOS extensions where written in such a way as to
allow the compiler just to pick out the chunks of code it required. I found
this info in the Compiler manual supplied with AMOS PRO compiler.

No, of course not, $VER: isn't some 'special' string, it's normal string
like all other. All strings are located in one place in executabe file,
null-terminated, and $VER: is just one of them. It is advicable for it
to be first string defined (or used; same effect would have Print "$VER:
Programname 2.54" ), because of faster searching by Version command. But
if you, for instance, have some sort of About requester, and show $VER:
string in it, that would work fine also. Same thing works for C, asm, or
any other programming language.

It can be any$, all that version does is search for '$VER:' in the code,
and it just prints out what is in the code after, so if you have:
A$="$VER: Programname 2.54" in AMOS version will return Programname 2.54
it can be set ANYWHERE in the code, with any name, once it starts as '$VER:'

Get a prober extension to play them. DOOM is proberly the best music extension

Amiga Central , (working Name) Online magazine, plans, and notes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Hello fellow amigans, following the recent departure of Cu-Amiga,
from the Amiga world :( Many users were getting annoyed that
their would only be 1 true Amiga magazine (100% Amiga). I was
hanging about on irc and too of my friends on #a51 (Barry Jack,
Anthony Sherrat) were having some sort of argument/conversation
about CU Amiga, or something. I said 'CuAmiga is dead' Ant ,
replied 'I know' :( Then the usual things about Amiga Format
followed, then I had a flash of inspiration (du-darr) and I
thought that, as my new boss said that I could have
www.(whatever).com, I said 'Hey why not et up our own online

Amiga Central , Online Magazine!

Sun Aug 16, 1998 11:50 am

Amiga Central , (working Name) Online magazine, plans, and notes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Hello fellow amigans, following the recent departure of Cu-Amiga,
from the Amiga world :( Many users were getting annoyed that
their would only be 1 true Amiga magazine (100% Amiga). I was
hanging about on irc and too of my friends on #a51 (Barry Jack,
Anthony Sherrat) were having some sort of argument/conversation
about CU Amiga, or something. I said 'CuAmiga is dead' Ant ,
replied 'I know' :( Then the usual things about Amiga Format
followed, then I had a flash of inspiration (du-darr) and I
thought that, as my new boss said that I could have
www.(whatever).com, I said 'Hey why not et up our own online
magazine' every 1 on the channel was pretty exited, and ideas
flew about for about 15 mins or so. So then it was decided that
www.amigacentral.com would be set up, but various other net works
have used the name Amiga central, even though that is not their
URL (www.amicon.org) for example, and I don't want to get into
legal fight about the name, so could some one come up with a

Well, not AGA oriented, but I did write a tutorial for the GUI extension that
covers:

Using GadToolsBox to create a GUI file
Using AMOS to make a GUI bank
Using GUI commands to:
Check for close
Use Help system
Use text gadgets, string gadgets, Checkbox gadgets, MX gadgets, ASL file
requesters, GadTools requesters
Use listviews
Proper Prefs files
Tooltypes from icons
simple encryption/decryption scheme

I expect it will probably be included in the next public beta of GUI.

I hope you will set a date for updates so that people will know when the new
issue is up/out. But, consider the amount of traffic you may be letting
yourself in for. Will the site handle 10,000 rabid amigans hitting it?

I've written several articles for Amiga Report, on AMOS, as well as just
recently completing the GUI Tutorial for absolute beginners. I'm offering my

Amos beginner I'm not, but GUI Ext I am :)

Where and how much for your tutorial then and does it have
plenty of examples etc?

I have had a fiddle with GUI and it seems good enough.

Looking forward to your tutorial though :-)

Personal note.

Mon Aug 17, 1998 9:33 pm
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


Greetings, fellow Listers.

Just a note: I've started back with another year of studies starting today
(Monday), so I won't be around as much as most of us can during the summer.

If anyone sends me any mail, I'll get it, but don't expect a reply for a
few days. I'll try to check my mail daily, but I don't know if I'll get to
as often as I'd like (the only days I'll have time to do most of my
Net-related activites will be the weekend). Don't say you weren't warned.
:)

Btw, the Parrottsoft site is coming up (kinda slow). It actually wasn't
until a few weeks ago that I started back on it, and I hadn't done anything
with it all Summer. If things go good, it should be up by the end of the
month (which will be about 3 or 4 weeks). All, if not most of, the graphics
are done, and I'm almost decided on the layout.. further updates soon.

Anyhow, thanks for reading. Gotta run.

Adam Parrott, mailto: parrotta@usa.net, ICQ# 12967025, Handle: Axianator
Webmaster of Parrottsoft and proud member of Team *AMOS* and the IAPA.
The official Parrottsoft site at http://parrottsoft.hypermart.net up soon!

Just wanted to inform you of the fact that I have coded a pretty decent AMOS
screen grabber which is "perfect" for grabbing screenshots of games, as it
does sprites and bobs. I have uploaded it to AmiNet today so you'll probalby
be able to get it tomorrow or something like that.

And I thought GMS was free for freeware developers..

The user package is shareware based. On registration you will get
an unrestricted version of GMSPrefs, access to e-mailed updates,
bug fixes and so on. The cost is $20US, and the registration will
last for 2 years.

But apparently not for the users of my FREEware.

GUI extension. It isn't totally game oriented, but it will do AGA screens. No
bobs, but that isn't really GUI, is it? There's also OS Devkit, if you are
technically minded.

Giark,

Well, I was looking for something to do games with, so I will look into
the OS devKit. Where can I get it?

you dont get anything extra for TGE.

3d tutorial

Wed Aug 19, 1998 2:03 am
Andy H <geosync@ozemail.com.au>


Hi all,

Adam and Omer asked me for the 3d tutorials, but there was someone else
who did also. (I just can`t remember who it was)
So here's the invite....

Anyone who wants AMOS 3d tutes on making a tank game just email me and
I`ll send it out. Adam has the 3rd installment which I lost (please
send it to me Adam) but there is enough there to get started on.

3D questions!!!!

Wed Aug 19, 1998 8:07 am
Ömer ÖZYILDIRIM <km97y019@students.itu.edu.tr>


Please help. Is there any way of creating AMOS 3D objects other than 3D
ObjEd.? The editor (I think) is very hard to use and doesn't run on my
1200. I had to build a network between my 500 & 1200 to be able to use
my harddisk, but still not satisfied with it. I repeat: isn'n there any
other way to create 3D objects for AMOS 3D? Or at least does anyone know
something about the structure of the object files. Maybe I can write a
small code to get 3D coordinates of the objects to a form that AMOS 3D
can display them. You may say it's not that easy but I'm ready to face
anything but having to use 3D ObjEd. Or maybe there is a utility that
converts other programs' objects to AMOS 3D objects. If there is please
let me know. Thanx.

There is a piece of code at Aminet:dev/amos/AmosAGA.lha which opens two
Amos 16 color screens and joins them into 256 color screen by messing with
copper, I think it even support sprites.

Except sprite #2 which is said to be eaten by the system. Don't know
how. Anyway I personally didn't find the code so useable.

I got into the same dilema some time ago but then got tired of it
Some one in the old list told me the way of creating something to
convert the files , If I could convert from lightwave objects it
would be perfect.
Unfortunantly that help is lost , and I'm also in the search for
this tools too , maybe someone on the list with the needed acknoledge
can help?
You can run the Amos object modeler on your a1200 (I believe you
will want to as it is faster) by using those degrading softwares and
runing it by disk.
If someone one the list would like to create a convertion tool , I
'm willing to help the way I can.
See ya!

Hello!

Attached is the latest version of bubba,
this was as it was back in december 97 before i sent it to giark
on the night of the deadline, james brown hadnt contrabuted for about 1/2
months before that so you'll probably be able to get another update off him,
Ive just sent him this one for him to add his updates in.

It goes well on a 030, but a a500 mightnt be able to cope!

enjoy!

Nope, It will be done soon, and I'll release a public beta very soon
if all goes well the public one will be out in about 2-3weeks.

ARexx and LDos Ext.

Thu Aug 20, 1998 7:08 am
Dale Hymanyk <dhymanyk@telusplanet.net>


Hi all,

I've been fooling around with the LDos extension, in particular trying to use
some of the ARexx commands.

So far I've used the 'LRexx Send Msg' command to cause Miami to go
online/offline and with Yam to d/l mail. However I've come against an obstacle
with trying to get the return from the two ports. The docs are really not much
help.

Anyway if anyone could look at the attached file and get me straightened
around I'd appreciate it!

Regards,
Dale

Rainbow 3-D scroller...

Howdy all,
I had to take my machine down for storage for the rest of the
summer so I won't be able to work on or dig up that rainbow 3d scroller I
got everyone excited about for a little while, sorry about that, my 'miggy

Problems with AP 2.1 Lib

Thu Aug 20, 1998 4:53 pm
Christopher Kossa <abattoir@erols.com>


Hello...

I was hoping some of you could help me out here. I had a Micronik Tower
with a PPC/060, Picassio IV, and Kicks 3.1. I used the AP lib that Pietro
recompiled to get the interlace working and everything was fine. Except for
the Micronik tower which I had to send back. Now I have a 4000T with the
same set up, but now AMOS doesn't work. It seams the AP lib that's on the
AMOS Factory site, doesn't fix the interlace bug and the version he e-mailed
to the list back in April just locks up the system. Anyone have any clues?

My father uses a Cybervision 64 3D on his A4000 with no problems but he
uses Buster revision 11. As you probably allready know Buster 9 is faulty
and my father replaced it years ago.

It realy isn't very easy-to-use, but it could serve well for static
pictures. If there would be a converter which could split 256 colors IFF
picture in two 16 colors for that source, I think that useability would be
greatly increased.

After a bit of fiddling, I've finally got it!

Except for when using locateapsystem (how often does anyone do that?), I have
managed to get ap to look in #one# directory for all configs. I've fixed the
interpreter_config.amos file and added a line to user-startup. Now ap doesn't
have fits looking for configs (works with gui compiler, too).

Unfortunately, part of it hinges on the 3+ wb.

How?

Assign S: AMOS_Pro:S/ Add

That tells the amiga that s in your amos dir is part of s:

The second part is the revamped int_conf.amos file. I'll upload if you think
its a useful item.

Remember that message I sent about fixing the interpreter config? This is why.
Amos pro, as is, stores the interpreter_config in 3 places. Without using the
fix, you have to save the interpreter config (note that the unfixed version
does not even give you the proper name as default) in three separate places.
s:, AMOSPro_System:, APSystem.

I've patched the interpreter_config.amos program to make it all look in the
same place all the time.

Hello.

I have some questions that i need help with.


1. I asked for a higlight rutine for my diskmag some time ago, and i recived
this source from someone (i dont remember who), but i cant manage to get this
rutine to work in my diskmag.

--cut--
Curs Off : Flash Off
'
' Initialize text and zones
'
Reserve Zone 4
FH=8 : Rem font height
XO=120 : YO=80
Ink 0
Restore OPTIONS
For I=1 To 4
Read T$
YG=YO+(I-1)*FH
Text XO,YG+Text Base,T$
Set Zone I,XO,YG To XO+Text Length(T$),YG+FH-1
Next
'
' Wait for mouse click on option
'
Repeat
Z=Mouse Zone
If Z
YG=YO+(Z-1)*FH
Ink 0,2
Restore OPTIONS
For I=1 To Z : Read T$ : Next
Text XO,YG+Text Base,T$
Repeat
If Mouse Click : Cls : Print "You clicked ";T$ : Exit 2 : End If
Until Mouse Zone<>Z
Ink 0,1
Text XO,YG+Text Base,T$
End If
Until Mouse Click
'
Direct
'
OPTIONS:
Data "Option 1","Option 2","Option 3","Option 4"
--cut--


I'am not very good with this kinda stuff, so i dont understand how this code
work, but i see you use some method to set up 4 zones, but i need a rutine
that let me set up my zones like this:

Reserve Zone 4
Set Zone 1,10,10 To 100,20
Set Zone 2,10,30 To 100,40
Set Zone 3,10,50 To 100,60
Set Zone 4,10,70 To 100,80
Text 15,18,"zone 1"
Text 15,38,"zone 2"
Text 15,58,"zone 3"
Text 15,78,"zone 4"

Here i need a rutine that higlights the text in the same way as the rutine
over, but it must also work when i includes some more zones.
There must also be a way to adjust the leght of the higlighting on the right
side.


2. Where can i get the latest version of OS-Devkit???

3. When will TGE be released???


Thanx alot for taking the time to help me with these questions.

be :)

Anyway, I have Amos Pro & Pro Compiler - both with boxes and

Anyone care to quote me what they think I could sell the lot

I have just the thing, I programmed some XEN buttons for
serialpaint, but they could be used for your problem. I've put together
an example program with your button config, it might not be what you
wanted, but you should find it useful somewhere ;)

Hm now the Turboextension works after copying Interpreter config to
3 places...

But:

1. Is Turbo extension the same as Craft extension?

2. I have not found any docs that show how to use the commands in
Turbo extension, could someone send some examples
using these commands, eg scene commands and star commands...?

Is there some textfile available that show syntax of these commands?

Compiler Woes

Tue Aug 25, 1998 4:09 pm
Dale Hymanyk <dhymanyk@telusplanet.net>


Greetings all,

I've written a little utility using the Gui Ext 1.70 that works fine when I
test it from the AP editor. But after compiling it, it hangs up
every time. The Gui docs say that before compiling, you need to run the
compiler
patch program but my archive for 1.70 didn't have a compiler patch in it, so
I'm using a previous version (1.22). If this is not the correct one could
someone send it to me.

The program uses just AMOSPro2 and Gui ext commands with a few Ldos ones
thrown in, but these always compiled fine in my pre-Gui programs.

If anyone could offer some advice on this rather frustrating problem, I'd sure
appreciate the input.

Dale

Are you using wait? There are several commands that no longer work when
compiled with the gui version of the compiler.

I'm not sure. I know that the sound commands won't work (play16 will solve
that one) and I've found wait locks the program up. I am not sure if there is
a list of what commands are messed up by the gui compiler, but you should know
that they are all commands that mess amos up in terms of multitasking and
such.

For the record, I've checked my AP manual and I've used none of the
multitasking commands. No sound commands either. It appears Ldos isn't the
problem as several commands of each type execute fine before it hangs, but I'd
like to try a rewrite without Ldos so could anyone point me towards a good
example of AMOS using ARexx, as it's the LRexx commands I'm using from Ldos. I
need to send messages to other apps and read the returned results. The AMOSPro
Arexx commands seem a bit skimpy. No, I don't have the registered AMCAF ext.

Again all help is much appreciated.

There already is an AMOS for the PC. Actually meant to be a logical
progression from Atari STOS to Amiga AMOS to PC FILOS, it is
based on AMOS.

I haven't checked the website in a while, so I can't confirm that it is
still "alive and well", but I would be surprised if it isn't...

The phone number in France is 04 50 52 83 51

It's definitely a great extension for those who want to produce professional

you'll understand what it can do... :-)

Try to insert som GuiReq commands in the area of youre code

think your program hangs. This would make it possible to

Converting AMOS to Visual BASIC

Mon Aug 24, 1998 1:23 am
"Greg Larson" <greenfuzz@earthlink.net>


Hello,

A friend has written some programs using AMOS on his Amiga systems. Has
anyone had any experience converting AMOS code to Visual BASIC (or even
Visual C++)? I'm not concerned about having to do some manual
translations, but I am mainly concerned about emulating the console I/O,
sound, and graphic capabilities of AMOS, perhaps something that uses
DirectSound and DirectDraw.

Thanks.

Is there some reason why the conversion needs to perfromed with
VC++ or VB?

It should be very simple to convert the AMOS programs to C &
Allegro. As I have said before, Allegro is an excellent audio-video
library.

First, it's reasonably fast: my bob routines can handle around 300
64w X 26h animated bobs in 1 Vbl, even on my P133. Keep in mind
that a VGA Vbl occurs 70fps and you will realize just how fast the
bob drawing is.

Second, it's very easy to use!!

The bob demo is available from my PC page and a vertically
scrolling shooter is available from my GAMES page... both are
written in C & Allegro.

The mad GUI Compiler :) (..was Compiler Woes)

There is confusion.... i'll explain better the GUI Compiler in the future docs
:)


All the GUI Compiler users should read this......


1- *You don't need the GUI Compiler for your GUI Ext. programs!* ...you can
use
the standard AMOSPro compiler without problem. The GUI Extension is a
standard AMOSPro v2 Extension, and so it works fine with the AMOSPro compiler
too.

*2- If you use the GUI compiler ALL the amos commands works without problem.*
*But anyway see belove...*


so.... what does the GUI compiler? what's the difference? The main difference
between the GUI and AMOSPro compiler is that the compiled code generated by
the GUI compiler hides all the AMOS bullshits in the code. If you zap the code
you'll not see nothing AMOS related... if you zap the code generated by the
standard AMOSPro compiler, you'll find tons of AMOS
stuffs like the name of all the amos extensions installed in your system and
other preferences.

If you trace a AMOS compiled program using snoopdos or other programs, you'll
notice other AMOS activities, like search and freeze the other running AMOS
programs, searh the misterious AMOS_Switcher and other stuff. Well... the GUI
Compiler remove these "unuseful" operations as well.

If you run a virus checker togheter AMOS, it will probably pop up a warning
message because some system functions has been modified... for experts:

- Graphics.library LoadView() ... only on AGA machine
- Intuition.library EasyRequestArgs()
- Intuition.library AutoRequest()

these has been also removed.


So essentially the GUI compiler:

- hides the AMOS rubbish in the code

- makes your AMOS programs able to run in multitasknig with the other AMOS
programs! As you know you can't run 2 o more AMOS programs togheter, because
only the last one will run while the others will be freezed. Now you can!

- makes your programs more "clean" and virus checkers warnings free :)))


Since so many AMOS stuffs has been removed from the code, is not a good idea
use it in AMOS games for example... the GUI compiler is specifically designed
for *workbench applications only.* If your program run in the WB enviroment,
it doesn't needs all the amos patches and hacks, for this reason i've created
the
GUI Compiler!

If you need to open AMOS screens and related stuffs , use the AMOSPro
compiler.

If you need a nice workbench GUI for your programs, use the GUI compiler.


About the commands that doesn't works anymore.... this isn't a GUI Compiler
effect... this happen if you put the Gui Amiga 1 command at the start of your
program. What does Gui Amiga 1, and why some commands doesn't works anymore???

Simple... the Gui Amiga 1 command disable other AMOS internal functions in
order to makes your program a bit more os friendly. In paticular, this command
remove the AMOS interrupt routine!!!!!! So all the vbl/interrupt based
commands/functions doesn't works!! Mainly:

- Music
- Samples
- AMAL
- vbl commands and timer
- amos gfx

if you're creating a WB program, usually you don't need the above stuffs, and
so is a good idea to disable them.

Anyway if you need them (.. for example Music and sample)
*don't call Gui Amiga 1 and everything will works as usual! * Therefore i
suggest you to use other
extensions for music and sample, because the AMOS music extension is really
bad coded!

I hope that now the GUI Compiler target is clear :)

I happen to own visual basic (pro ed) , and I found it s manual a
pain. I was into translation my progs to pc but think I will have to
look for a book on game for visual basic.
You could try FILOS but I think its author left it behind as the
page never seems to get updated.

OK, before I start this, what is FILOS,AmosNG and all the other "AMOS Clones"
being worked on, and where can I find information relating to them ? Secondly,
the version I intended to write was an AMOS on the PC that you could directly
port all origanal AMOS progs over to and use :- code,banks,sprites,mods etc.
with little or no conversion required. If its already being under taken tho I
wont bother, but any comments would be greatly appreciated !

Learn to love coffee! This sounds like a huge undertaking, but if

Amos.library upgrade (for AMOSPro v2)

Thu Aug 27, 1998 7:45 pm
Pietro Ghizzoni <ghizzo@agonet.it>


Hi!

Just today i've finished to modify some code in the amos.library. Due to the
several reports about my previous release and the related problem, i've
decided to totally trash the F.Lionet code used in the amos/workbench flip
routine, and
rewrite it in a more OS friendly way. Now the flip code is twice fast :)

It's more intelligent.... maybe someone remember the little and boring
intuition screen
opened by the old AMOS The Creator programs..... Europress has claimed that
with AMOSPro the screen has been removed..... false!! It's just hidden! It's
opened when amos is in front (.. so you don't see it) and it's immediately
closed when amos goes to back.

Now it's died forever, and a more efficient flip method has been implemented.
The interlace problem with AmigaOS 3.1 is fixed also....

Test it, flip several time between amos and the wb, and tell me that it works
fine or i'll kill you! :)
Hold down the Amiga-A keys for a while and enjoy the new flip speed.

Now, my AMOS works again on my PPC/060! Only "problem" I get is my
Workbench pointer /sometimes/ stays on the AMOS screen, and doesn't move.
Most likely, it has something to do with my Picasso IV & CGX because the 3rd
mouse color still shows the inverse of the color underneath.

Sorry for the delay in replying...

Allegro is a **FREE** library for use with C or C++, specifically
Allegro is for use with the **FREE** DJGPP compiler!!

The url for the Allegro website is:
http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/index.html

If you are interested in EASY, POWERFUL PC programming then
I highly recommend DJGPP and Allegro. C/C++ are so easy and
powerful by themselves and adding in the Allegro audio-video
support results in one fantastic development system.

Well... it doesn't :( I have another screen (MUI public screen) in

Amos + Free Memory

Fri Aug 28, 1998 9:10 am
"Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>


Is there any way in AmosPro to tell how much free memory a user has.
A program I am working on uses a user definable buffer. If the user changes
the buffer size, I want to check the new buffer size against the amount of
free memory and either allow or disallow the change dependant on the amount
of free memory.

Thanks in advance.

Declan.

AF AMOS Review

Fri Aug 28, 1998 10:29 am
"Rune J. Keller" <keller@vip.cybercity.dk>


In the latest issue of Amiga Format (got it yesterday): Besides the news on
the new AMOS by Pietro and the other guys, there's a Reader Review of the old
AMOSPro. It says some pretty nasty thing about out favourtie programming
language. Like, it is completely unusable for games and also utilities as it
cannot use gui. It tells that we've been trying to get the AMOS source, but
that we'll never get it (!). There's even a comment from an AF guy, who says
that he will never run an AMOS program if he knows it is.

I was just wondering if someone on the list would like to send AF a letter
with some facts? We really can't let this go by without a comment! It could
also be a good way of telling about the new official AMOS site which should go
online one of the next days.

Does this mean any code written using the amos.lib prior to the one you
are releasing soon, doesn`t work with OS v2.x or older?

This will give you the current amount of CHIP and FAST ram available. You can
also parse the lines to get the total CHIP and FAST on the machine.

You could also use the A=Chip Free and A=Fast Free commands.

RGB=$59c

R=RGB/256
G=(RGB/16) mod 16
B=RGB mod 16

RRGGBB=B*16+G*16*256+R*16*256*256

Is this what you want?

Many yaers ago, with a friend of mine I had developed about 20 educatiol
videogames/programs for a teacher. We think to sell them to other schools,
but they want them on PC only, but ridiculous thing was that they haven't
a PC, and Commodore wasn't dead!

So we investigate how to port them into VB. We buy a lot of M$ VB books,
after bulk headaches, I decide to avoid it like plague. Now my friend is
writing that kind of program in VB, they are bulk, plenty of bugs, needs
PII, but they are easy to sell. Programms that we wrote in AMOS were more
user-friendly, and child like them much more newst ones! Even if they had
32
Color graphic, and under Win95 they had 800x600 24Bit graphic
(to avoid palette problem).

When I say him of next AMOS-like language that is under development, he
was very happy and hope it will be ported even on PC. Pietro, what do you
think about? On PC there are many Development tools & language, but
none is so powerful and userfriendly like AMOS :) I think it will be a
successful product.

VB is great to do Access Interface or report, but to develope other kind
of software, i.e. little videogames, is a bad tool. It is full of strange
bugs and nonsense. But you may use OCX (like VC++) to use sprite, sound,
or other things that you need. There are a lot of OCX to do everything
(form control a coffe machine to virtual sex), but you need to buy them ;)
OCX is a M$'s technolgy for plug-in. You may use OCX with all language
that support them.

I think your friend should use C++ (on PC VC++ is a must, so you can
easily use Microsoft Foundation Classes :(), so he
ought develope classes to emulate AMOS command, so porting will be more
easy, but it is difficult to do this job, but not impossible. He should
know well how use C++ & DirectX.
The marvellous thing on VC++ is that old example don't compile on newest
release. This a M$ 100% compliant product :) VB5.0 often can't compile
VB4.0 source, and soon as possible will be release VB6.0 for Win98, so
will be newest funny problem with old sources :)

OFFTOPIC
IF you want good book on C++ or Java, goto http://www.BruceEckel.com/
You will find: Thinking in C++ 2nd edition (alpha6) (RTF & TXT) and
Thinking in JAVA (pdf). This are commercial books, but Bruce give them for
free on internet, so there is much more debugging before pubblishing them,
uhhh like M$ :-)))

Chip/Fast Free give *only* the amount currently usable. Using Avail gives more
info on memory than the AMOS commands, say if you wanted to make a slider bar
of available/used memory.

Did you ever notice that, even though =Fast Free will tell you how much
memory, even if you have >8Mb, the memory gauge at the top of the screen does
not work if you have more than 8Mb?

GUI Ext

Hi there guys,

I've been messing about with GUI Ext V1.7 and I'm using the
command FUI Amos 1.

The thing is, I can still press Ctrl & C to quit my program
which I don't want!!!

I have even tried the Break Off command, but with no luck!

I am also using the new V2.2 Amos.Library sent the other day.
Does anyone know how I can stop the Ctrl & C exit option
without using GUI Amos 0 instead?

TIA

Cya.

No... if you use the lib posted yesterday it doesn't work on OS v2.x or
older... but don't worry.. the new version with backward compatibility is

Yes, because that freeze all annoying tasks in the background, so
it's better when trying to do smooth animations (for games).
And it save the maximum of chip, some have only 1 meg !

|Turbo Extension.|

Sat Aug 29, 1998 6:07 am
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


Andy (Hawkins) and I belive Hakan wanted the Turbo Plus Extension (and I
think it was Scott who asked about it's commercial status?) In answering:

I've got a CU coverdisk copy (probably same as Scott's) that I can send to
whoever needs it. Our old friend Chris Evans sent me a copy awhile back via
snail-mail for a nominal fee, along with a photocopied manual. I could do
the same, but the manual might take awhile to get scanned and copied..

As for it being commercial? I think it WAS and may still be "considered"
commercial, but since it was released on the coverdisk(s) it may be
considered PD by now, who knows..? I don't think the author would mind..

Also, I think Hakan asked if Craft and Turbo+ were the same things:
No, they are not. Craft was the first one, and Turbo Plus was the second.

For Andy and Hakan, if you guys want it, I could send physical copies to
you or just .DMS it and send it to you e-mail. Or if you can wait, you
might want to pick up the new AMOS CD later this year as PAC suggested.

Yes, I've noticed this myself, and I've lived with it ever since I've had
AMOSPro. I'm run about 16meg+ of Fast on my A2000, and it's always done
this. Just another AMOS bug? Something else for Pietro to fix! haha! :)

Greetings all.

Like I said about a week ago, I wouldn't be around much, and I was right.
Me, like a few other |students| on the List, have started back with more
studies this year (for those who didn't know, I'm a High School Senior this
year: What a horrid fact! Just right behind Johnny Bintz, hehe).

Anyhow, I've been |QuItE| busy lately, with that AND a recent death in the
family (for which I had to drive over 1800+ miles, round trip, on the East
Coast). Btw, it was my great-grandmother, but she was 94, and lived a LONG
life. I know she's in a better place than this weird (PC-driven) world. :)
This was within a 4-day timeframe this past Saturday. (Yes, I'm exhausted)

Anyhoo again, I do see that the List has been busy, and I've got a few
mails to reply to, just thought I would drop a note. Thanks again.

Btw, Keith (whereEVER you are): I'll need to chat breifly with you
concerning a few last-minute CBATNAM details. Please get in touch?

GUI Ext Silly Problem!!!

Sun Aug 30, 1998 3:41 am
Andy Gibson <andy@agasinc.demon.co.uk>


Hi there guys,

I am using the command GUI Display Iff 10,2

Wich works well, it shows the iff image held in bank 10.

I can also clode this screen with GUI Screen Close 2

So far so good, but what I can do is:

GUI Display Iff 10,2
GUI=GUI Wait
If GUI=-11
GUI Screen Close 2
End If

I can't seem to get anything from the mouse at all on this
screen. It only works when i flip back (Amiga & M) to my GUI
screen 1 (created with Gadtools). If I click on that one, the
mouse is read and the GUI Screen Close 2 command then
works!!!

Anyone got ny ideas How I can access the mouse butons on a
screen created with the GUI Display Iff command?

Cya.

> Hm has someone got a code for a 'snowfall'

Sure, I made a "Christmas Demo" a few years back which does
exactly that... snow falls and lands on the text (Merry Christmas)
and background scenery (trees, etc).

I wrote it in BLITZ, but it would be simple to convert to AMOS.

Actually, all you need to do for an AMOS Snow Demo is:
----------<START OF CODE>----------
NUMFLKS=99
Dim SNOWXPOS(NUMFLKS), SNOWYPOS(NUMFLKS)
Dim SNOWYSPD(NUMFLKS)

Rem Define procedures...
Procedure CLEAR_SNOW
For REP=0 To NUMFLKS
Rem where 0=Background
Plot SNOWXPOS(REP), SNOWYPOS(REP), 0
Next REP
End Proc

Procedure UPDATE_SNOW
Shared REALSCRN, COLSCRN
For REP=0 To NUMFLKS
XSPD=Rnd(4)-2 : YSPD=Rnd(4)+1
SNOWXPOS(REP)=SNOWXPOS(REP)+XSPD
SNOWYPOS(REP)=SNOWYPOS(REP)+YSPD
Rem We have the new position, now check for collision...
Screen COLSCRN
TEST=Point( SNOWXPOS(REP), SNOWYPOS(REP) )
Screen REALSCRN
If ( TEST <> 0 ) : Rem where 0=Background color
Rem Ahh, the snow has landed!!
Rem So, we reset this snowflake...
SNOWX(REP)=Rnd(352)
SNOWY(REP)=0
Else
Rem SNOWCOLOR is the color register you're using for the
Rem snow. In my demo, I used YSPD and had a range of
Rem colors from white to a bluish grey. This makes a very
Rem nice effect when the snow builds up.
Plot SNOWXPOS(REP), SNOWYPOS(REP), SNOWCOLOR
End If
Next REP
End Proc

Rem Initialize the snow...
For REP=0 To NUMFLKS
SNOWX(REP)=Rnd(352)
SNOWY(REP)=-(REP*3) : Rem Note the - sign
Next REP

Rem Create two screens... REAL is buffered, COL is not...
REALSCRN=0 : COLSCRN=1
Screen Open REALSCRN, 320, 240, 64, Lowres
Double Buffer : Autoback 0 : Bob Update Off
Screen Open COLSCRN, 320, 240, 64, Lowres
Autoback 0 : Bob Update Off : Screen Hide COLSCRN

Rem Initialize the screen palettes and load the IFF picture into
Rem REALSCRN. Draw all static images into REALSCRN then...
Screen Copy Logic(REALSCRN) To Physic(COLSCRN)

Finally, we are ready for the action...

ALL_DONE=False
Timer=0
Repeat
CLEAR_SNOW
UPDATE_SNOW
If Fire(0) Then ALL_DONE=True
If Timer>1200 Then ALL_DONE=True
Screen Swap REALSCRN : Wait Vbl
Until ALL_DONE

Fade 5 : Wait 75
End
----------<END OF CODE>----------

It's been a while since I have used AMOS and I'm actually creating
this program "on the fly" in this e-mail, so there may be errors.

The basic idea is covered here and that should put you well on your
way.

Arrgh!! See, I said there may be errors!!

Replace the UPDATE_SNOW procedure with this one...

Procedure UPDATE_SNOW
Shared REALSCRN, COLSCRN
For REP=0 To NUMFLKS
XSPD=Rnd(4)-2 : YSPD=Rnd(4)+1
TESTXPOS=SNOWXPOS(REP)+XSPD
TESTYPOS=SNOWYPOS(REP)+YSPD
Rem We have the new position, now check for collision...
Screen COLSCRN
TEST=Point( TESTXPOS, TESTYPOS )
Screen REALSCRN
If ( TEST <> 0 ) : Rem where 0=Background color
Rem Ahh, the snow has landed!!
Plot SNOWXPOS(REP), SNOWYPOS(REP), SNOWCOLOR
Rem So, we reset this snowflake...
SNOWXPOS(REP)=Rnd(352)
SNOWYPOS(REP)=0
Else
SNOWXPOS(REP)=TESTXPOS
SNOWYPOS(REP)=TESTYPOS
Rem SNOWCOLOR is the color register you're using for the
Rem snow. In my demo, I used YSPD and had a range of
Rem colors from white to a bluish grey. This makes a very
Rem nice effect when the snow builds up.
Plot SNOWXPOS(REP), SNOWYPOS(REP), SNOWCOLOR
End If
Next REP
End Proc


I had a fatal error in that the snow would never accumulate. This is
fixed now. Also fixed two label references which were inaccurate.

Anyway, I am done with this, gotta go, but I hope it all helps!!

Magazine views of AMOS

Wed Dec 31, 1969 11:59 pm
"Alastair Murray" <malcolm.murray@virgin.net>


I think the problem with the magazine (and general) views of AMOS is
that they don't realise what is made in it.

There are a lot of bad programmers who use AMOS because it is easy and
produce games that are poor and look AMOS like. This is what the
magazines see.

When a game made in AMOS is good, you can't even tell it is made in
AMOS and no-one says a thing. They only notice the bad software.

Both CU and AF regularly have all sorts of AMOS programs on their
coverdisks, often as the main program of the month, they don't even
know it!

They just have a general lack of knowledge about how AMOS has moved on
through extensions.

I can't blame them for not liking it as it does has its problems, what
I do think is strange is the way they recomend Blitz when it has many
of the same problems and a lot more besides.

-Murray
