Hi
Does anybody know an elegant way of converting a scancode value to the
equivalent ascii char? eg 64=" " (space). It would need to take into
account the current keymap.

Ive resisted the urge to join in on the big file debate (mark 2 or is it
3?) and the bickering that followed but Ive decided to add my say now.

I think the perfect solution is that of Mr. Giark who said he had a 500k
file if anyone was interested. No huge mailings and no messing around with
ordering lists.

Secondly actually typing in the real subject would be a great help.
"Silly bickering thread between Collins and Hyland" (no offence meant)
would have saved me reading about 5 messages instead of "Re:Twinz_Pro...."

That`s all ,Thanks in advance to anyone who can help with the keys
problem,

I will try and get my raycaster onto my web page, but because I am at home
for easter(the computers are at UNI) then it will have to wait another 1 or
so till I come back.  I will give the address then... Hopefully I will also
be able to upload someother of my programs, including a couple of top down
games and some vector stuff :-)

I have also written a bump mapping routine in amos, you`ve probably seen
the effect in amigademos, it sort of runs a light accross a picture that
shines at different values at each pixel depending on its orientation to
the light (check out the demo called "The Gate" (probably on Aminet /demo)
, it has some amazing use of bumpmapping :-)
I will post that as well, and hopefully the much faster ASM version and the
AMOS tools that are used to create the bump map.

C U in a couple-o-weeks :-)

  Here we go again. Another month has come  to an end, and soon I can down-
load the March archive and see if anyone ignored what I said about contact-
ing me directly because I'm not  on  the  list.  [And  don't tell me how to
subscribe, I have chosen not to because  downloading and processing all the
induvidual messages is to much hassle. The only problem with what I'm doing
now is that attached files come  out  as  Base64,  whatever THAT is. Anyone
know how to convert those  cryptic  text  chunks  back  into their original
form? (And if it can't be done, what's the point with including them in the
archive in the first place?)
  Talking of archives, here's a little  batch  file I put together for pro-
cessing them.

;Type f.ex. "ual 06 96" to unpack 0696.lhz to 9606

lha e <mo><ye>.lzh AMOSLIST
rename AMOSLIST <ye><mo>
ask "Delete <mo><ye>.lzh? "
if warn
delete <mo><ye>.lzh
endif

This unpacks just the main file from  the  archive,  renames it and deletes
the archive after asking just to be sure.  Renaming it means I can keep all
the monthlies in the same directory (and  won't have to check the file date
to see which is which either), and  switching  year  and month around means
the files will get listed in  chronological  order  when sorted "alphabeti-
cally" (On Aminet all the January  files  are  grouped together followed by
all the February files and so on.).
  BTW, because I use a PC to download  the  files  and MessyDos to transfer
then to AmigaDOS, I have to shorten the filenames to month/year/suffix as I
download them, and this file is  madeto  handle those shortened file names.
If you download the files  directly  to  your  Amiga  under their  original
names, change all references to "<mo><ye>.lzh" to "Amoslist-<mo><ye>.lzh".

  One of the things I found out while going  through last winter's mail was
that one of the questions I  asked  recently  has  been asked twice before.
Hey, does that make it a Frequently  Asked  Question?  At least it has been
asked more frequently than "What is AMOS?",  which is the first question in
the FAQ. (Look Mike, if we didn't  know  what Amos was we wouldn't be here,
right?)

  But now it's time for a  Completely  Useless  Program.  Everyone  (with a
manual) knows Amos has  a  command  called  Load  IFF  that  will load most
pictures in a jiffy or two. Here's a  program  that  does the job in half a
minute (wih a lo-res pic).

  Those who have been around for a while  may remember that AmigaBasic came
with a couple of demo programs that  showed  how  to load and save pictures
using library routines. A bit later  one  Mac  Larsson (see comment line 1)
showed how it could be done entirely in Basic without libraries. I typed in
the programs and  experimented  a  bit  with  them,  then  I filed the disk
somewhere and forgot  about  it.  Recently  I  came  across  the disk while
looking for someone else and decided to try to convert the programs to Amos
just for fun and to see how fast it would  be. AmigaBasic has two functions
called CVI and CVL (ConVert Integer and ConVert Long) that I had to emulate
with procedures. [I tried using Def Fn, but that didn't work!]
  As I said, it takes half a minute to  do  a plain 320*200*16 picture, and
compiling only halves that,  so  what's  the  point?  Well, you can see the
picture loading and learn a bit  about  how it's stored (and figure out why
it's called InterLeaved BitMap), and figuring out how it works may help you
understand the file format if you have  need for that. (Someone asked about
that once, I think.)
  Mac also wrote a  couple  of  programs  for  saving  ILBM  files, and for
laoding and saving  ACBM  (Amiga  Continous  BitMap),  but  I haven't tried
converting them yet. One problem  with  LoadACBM is that it seems to load a
whole bitplane at a time into one st  Hi. Just checked  out  Elevators  after 
I  noticed  the  title in an old
Amoslist archive. (That's right, it  was  the  name that first attracted my
attention...) It's a nice  twist  on  an  old  theme  with some pretty good
graphics, but there are some details I can't say I like.
  It's been ages since I saw a S&L board,  but as far as I remember, snakes
would always take you at least  one  level  down  and  ladders at least one
level up. In your game you move  the  counters  sideways  and call itring, and
Amos it looks like Amos can't
handle that, so it needs a major rewrite.  BTW, it may be possible to write
faster versions of all the programs simply  by loading files into banks and
moving data around with *eek and  Copy.  Probably is - it's all that string
handling that slows things down...

  Talking of things Amos can't handle, I have this big file I tried reading
as a random file, but the program crashed  when trying to read record 32769
- that is 32K+1. Can't Amos  handle

The best way is to use Scanstr$(scancode) from the AMCAF extension. Apart
from that, you'd have to write your own conversion procedure as there is no

Hi, I'm new on the list, so I thought you might wanted to hear something about
me!

I'm a happy 18-year old student from Denmark, who has been using Amiga since
1988 and AMOS since 1990. I'm currently using AMOSPro 2.00 (who isn't?)
including most extensions, of which AMCAF is my favourite one.

I've being coding (at least starting on) a huge numbers of demos and games, of
which you might have seen 'X-Mas Time' from the late 17-Bit collection. I've
recently uploaded 'rjkpro_1.lha' to the aminet/dev/amos which includes some of
my stuff, just so you can get an idea of my work.

I'll end this message with a little question:
There's quite a lot of those intuition extensions, of which I haven't tried
anyone. Can you tell me if one of them is really worth using? How much are
they and where can I get them?

Thanks...

..that'd probably be Ghizzo's GUI extension, whcih converts drawn GUI's into
something usable easily from amos.  It's on aminet,
http://www.uni-paderborn.de/aminet or any of the aminet mirrors.

I've downloaded your extension but before installing it I've read the doc and
it says that ... It's not compatible with Amos Pro!!!! The doc says that you
has to save in ASCII mode all our AMOS programs in order to use them. There
is not any other way to uses it?

 And the cow didn't exist, it should say:

 There is no cow to eat.

 I don't know ho to do that normally...
 Also: Case sensetive etc:

 I want this:

There's one problem with your extension: To use it, you need another program
which is NOT included.

Well met and godspeed,

Hi Jamie,

   The easiest way to achieve this is to treat all input strings with
either UPPER$ or LOWER$ in other words - convert everything to either
uppercase or lowercase depending on your taste.

Then you can compare and contrast knowing that everything is upper/lower
case!

Hope this helps.

Rich

Split the input into words, using Instr() to find the spaces.

Your parser must know about 'eat' and 'the' of course.

Compare 'cow' with the list of possible nouns. If it is not there, print the
message (i.e. Print "There is no ";NOUN$;" to eat").

If you are making a text adventure, you might as well take a look at the
several adventure development systems there are. A whole bunch of them can be
found at ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/.

Have the test words in memory in upper case only. So:
VERB$(1) = "EAT"
VERB$(2) = "HELLO"
VERB$(3) = "NORTH", etc.

Now, before you test, convert the input to uppercase:

UPIN$ = Upper$(IN$)

Hello, HEllO, HELLO, hello, etc. will all be converted to uppercase and can so
be tested against the list of test words.

Case sensitive is the easy bit, use Upper$ to convert it to upper case for
manageability, then split them into different words.  Now things get really
difficult.  EAT & COW is fairly straight forward, but you need to take into
account all your objects that are edible, and all the command words you are
using, related to other command words and objects, so each thing relates to
another thing, so to EAT your COW, you would probably need a FORK or a
DEAD-COW.  

There are two main ways of working out EAT the COW, one is extensive
programming on a per-location basis, and the other is with huge databases,
but to start you off, here is some code to split up your input.

dim split$(10):rem 10 words max.
line input a$ :rem nasty input.
a$=upper$(a$)
c=1
for n=1 to len(a$)
	z$=mid$(a$,n,1)
	if z$=" "
		c=c+1
	else
		split$(c)=split$(c)+z$
	end if
next

(end of code)

split$(1)="EAT"
split$(2)="THE"
split$(3)="COW"

..let me know if you  need more help/code.

I don't have my manual infront of me, but this is a method:
The ascii code difference between upper and lover case is always fixed. Ie
the difference between a and A is the same as the difference between b and
B.

if charcater read is greater than 64 (I dunno, look up the highest ascii
value for lowercase) then subtract the difference.

I haven't got GuiExt 1.61 yet, but I'm sure it means: It's not compatible
with older versions of GuiExt. This means that if you have any program
written with GuiExt v1.5 and you installed v1.61, you must save in ASCII and
then reload them.

*** End of forwarded message 

For Jamie, and anyone else who is interested...
I wrote a prog once that splits a string into it's words using something
like...

For LETTER_NUMBER = 1 To Len(TEXT$)
  LETTER$=Mid$(TEXT$,LETTER_NUMBER,1)
  WORD$=WORD$+LETTER$
  If LETTER$=' ':Rem Found a space must have a whole word
    Proc DO_SOMETHING_WITH [WORD$]
  End If
Next

For Case non sensitivity use either Upper$(WORD$) or Lower$(WORD$)

If Anyone wants source, which takes an input, extracts the words, searches
for them in a vocabulary or adds to the current vocab if the word doesn't
exist, and builds a list of words you can use after other words and then
spits out random samplings of the words it knows in orders it knows...
<phew>
Then let me know.

It was based on a prog called DANI- Dynamic Artificial Non-Intelligence,
Although I renamed my version ELLE- English Language Linkage Editor.

While I'm writing to the List...

Did some things over Easter.

1. A Quake .MAP file generator, takes height map IFF's and builds lovely
Hills and rivers for Quake. Very rough. No front end.

2. A gutsy little splatter game 'MEAT HEADS' Mouse pointin', Pump action,
Head Splattin' fun.

3. A 'voxel' engine. As seen in the PC helicopter game 'Comanche'
Needs more work, crashes a lot, but it has all the stuff you need to make
3D outdoor fly-around games. I do need a faster command than Bar for
this, maybe someone with extension advice or Asm knowledge could get in
contact...

Again, the source is available for anyone who wants to see it.

BTW, anyone seen Quake on the Amiga yet? I heard it was actually out there
for those of us with CyberGfx cards...

This can`t deal with multiple spaces. I`ve made ARGV[] and ARGC procedures
I`ve talked about, does anyone want them here? Or on aminet? They both could
be used for such things.

Pretty good text compressor could be made with this. What do you think?

This sounds interesting:) How does it works? How good it is?

I haven't included the GadToolsBox because:

1 - i can't spread it without the author permission

2 - the gadtoolsbox archive is 300k! + 120k (GUI extension) = 420k! Too big
    for lazy/slow users :)

3 - you can easly download it from aminet!

4 - a lots of people have the gadtoolsbox installed on their computer



Bye!

Thanks :)

Two solutions:


1 - Use the GUI Compiler instead of the standard AmosPro compiler

2 - Using the standard AmosPro compiler you must set these parameters in the
compiled program setup of the compiler shell:


- Create default screen?              No
- Send AMOS to back upon Booting?     Yes


 > I tend not to like the GUI Editor, are there any others available?


Why??? The GadToolsBox is one of the best GUI Editor! Actually the GuiConv
accessory supports the GadToolsBox only.

Greetings.

I'm back with more questions and comments in another "digest". For 
those who don't know, I only have access to my mail on weekends (that 
is, until summer).

Again, as in the previous digest, I don't have much to comment on 
except for one or two things I've seen pop up lately, and I feel led 
to throw my two cents worth in..

On the subject of LaRgE, HuGe, or EnOrMoUs files, Mr. Collin and Mr. 
Hyland seem to have been the leaders of this latest hair-pulling 
star-hot debate. I have something to say about their arguing:

Mr. Collin:
>> This all sounds a bit fascist to me is your name really Branko 
>> Collin or is it Branko Hitler?

> No, fascist is when I try to impose my will by force. What I am 
> doing is trying to impose my will by trying to get people on my 
> side, which is called democracy, and by trying to influence the 
> people that matter, which is how the Internet works.

Well, I'm on Mr. Collin's side. There should be a limit. No, not to 
small, such as 4k, which in my opinion is TOTALLY ridiculous (except 
for those with slower connections, mind you, I'm not one of them.) I 
have no problem with large files, >500k, as I have a fast connection 
(like alot of people on this list) that is 28.8 or 14.4+.

Now, Mr. Hyland:
> Hard drive space is not unlimited you know.

No one said it was.

> According to Bem Crowl "Nobody is stuck with a 4K limite.. this was
> just the opinion of ONE person" This one person wouldn't be you by 
> any chance?

Well, the opinion of ONE person may not be able to do anything, but 
the opinion of TWO or more may be able to change things. And, by the 
way, there is ONE person who has more POWER than any of our OPINIONS, 
and he's the Administrator of this list, Michael Cox.

> I do not remember any one appointing you as the AmosList Gestapo.
Like I said, Mr. Collin may not be, but Mr. Cox IS.

One more thing, Mr. Hyland, if your going to continue to complain
and continue to raise heck over the issue itself, why don't you just 
UNSUBSCRIBE yourself from this list, because I know that I can do 
without your bickering.

Now that that's over with..

Mr. Giark asked in regard to his query to anyone
that wanted his 500k .lha file of Alien Breed data:

> Which of you didn't receive it? When it returns undeliverable copies,
> it returns the whole 1.3meg file, so I don't know who didn't get it.

I have yet to recieve the file. Please go ahead and resend it if you 
already have not. Thanks.

That's about it. I just thought everyone would be happy to know (and 
for those who haven't already checked my pages or have not been by to 
check my pages lately), they're FINALLY FINISHED! YES! Well, 
actually, at the time of this writing, I still have yet to do these:

1. About pages
2. Download area
3. Information page
4. News pages

The Information and News pages will take the longest, but, 
nonetheless, I finally have all of the graphics done, I did finally 
decided on a new look (after about a month or two), and the pages 
preivously listed should be finished over the weekend. If you stop 
by, I'm setting up a guest book, so I would appreciate it if you 
would either sign IT or mail me and tell me what you think.

Btw, for those of you who use Amiga browser, tell me what you think 
of the frames/noframes difference and how well all of the pages are 
displayed on an Amiga and Amiga browser. I would like to know. Thanks

One more thing, for those who don't know, there are two Adam's on 
this list (maybe more I don't know of), but the one to whom I'm 
referring is Adam Wilkinson. Please don't get us mixed up.

Thanks again for reading another of my digests.

Long live the Amiga!

Hi!

What's??? The GUI extension is perfectly compatible with AmosPro! :) My
extension isn't compatible with the OLD Amos the Creator :() 

You must save your Amos program in ASCII ONLY if you have written a program
using the OLD BETA version of my extension! (GUI extension v1.5 beta) due
to the several changes and improvements of the new version.


ALL the other programs DOESN'T needs to be converted.... read carefully the
doc ;) 


Don't worry, be happy.... install the extension without problem and you
will be surprised! :)


Bye!

         TO:  Skid

          I don't know if you are still on the list but, back in January I 
   read your letters stating you were attempting to write a game by
   June.

         How have things progressed since that time?

         
         If you need a few routines or anything just let me know and I'll
   do what I can to see that you win that bet!!

Hello all!

Some of the long standing members of the AMOS list will remember this. It's
the Optimisation Tips list. I've made a few additions and modifications
recently and I'm going to upload it to Aminet soon. I've included it with
this email because I'm sure it will be of interest to a lot of the AMOS
users here.

Sorry if the file is too big for anyone, but it's only 5k. :)

Subject: Platform game scroll
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Hello everybody!

I am a swedish AMOS-programmer (and new in the mailing list!) and I wonder
if anyone out there has made a decent platform game scroll (like "Super
Mario") in this language.
I have tried, but it moves very jerky (on a 1200). The screen is built up
with 20*14
icons with the size of 16*16 pixels each that are drawn using "Paste Icon".
The scroll is achieved using "Screen Offset". I know the thing that slows
everything down is
when the icons are drawn, but does anyone know how to make this procedure
faster?
Or are there any extensions for scrolls like this?

Bye bye!

         Hello Everyone,

         I am a new user of this list (just gained Internet access in the 
   past month) but, I do have a bit of programming experience.

         Should have two games appearing on a CU Amiga magazine
   CD-ROM sometime in the near future.

         If you want to check out some of my work then the two titles
   are StarStrike2000 and TurboInvaders but, the latter is written
   in BLITZ.

         Anyway, they should be up on Aminet by the end of this month.
   I will post a message once I've confirmed their placement.


         BEN,

         You may find StarStrike2000 of interest as it illustrates the
   result of code-optimization quite effectively.

         Also, I have taken a look at the Optimization Tips. There are a
   couple bits I will add to it although, I must say it is a pretty
   comprehensive list at the moment!!

         Anyway, should have this done tonight (late night for you as I
   live in the USA) and will E-mail you directly.



               See Ya!!

   Well, that word ("faster") always gets my attention as like Ben I
   am a bit of an optimization-nut!! (No offense meant, Ben!)

   Perhaps a bit more info is in order.  What is the structure of the
   current scroll-module?

   You say that the scroll is achieved using "Screen Offset". I 
   assume you mean you are using a hybrid hardware/software
   scroll correct?

   Also, what are the requirements of this scroll-module? Do you
   simply need horizontal scrolling or do you need to allow vertical
   scrolling as well?

   Give an example of the specific scrolling requirements as well as
   your current scroll-module.

   It'll be fun to see just how fast we can get it to GOOOOOO!!




>Or are there any extensions for scrolls like this?

   Someone else will have to address this as I have heard of some
   extensions but, personally, I never use them!!

Hello to everyone!

I am a new user to this list! I just got internet access a couple of
weeks ago, and it took me this long to find an AMOS list :)

Anyway, I am 15 years old, I come from New Zealand, and I have been
programming in AMOS for about 4 years. I have been learning assembler
for about 3 months.

So basically, I write my programs in AMOS, then convert whatever I can
to assembler, and use it as `extensions', which speeds things up.

I have been working for a very long time on `Map Editors', and have
begun written very nice ones, because of all my experience! I use my
own tile pasting routines (a little faster than the Turbo Paste ones)
and I use the CPU for all operations (it is faster than the blitter 
for almost anything).

Anyway! I read an old (about March, I think) AMOS list on a CD-ROM, and
discovered some people talking about `fast reducing operations' that 
acted like Zoom. Well, I can code one just for you if you want! Mail me
and tell me what you need! 

I am writing a WarCraft-2 game (hence the tile-pasting and reducing) and
I wish to have an Interlaced option, for greater detail. However, AMOS
does not seem to interlace the screens properly on my system!
(A3000, OS 3.1, 2mb Chip, 4mb Fast) Does anyone know why, and how to get
around it? I would be most appreciative!

Thankyou!
            Laurie Curwood.

..well, I know why.  It is one of the many known bugs of Amos, and only
occurs on 3.1 - unfortunately, no known solution exists.  Apart from
changing your ROM chip that is.  :(

I am writing to the list about the Optimisation Tips written by Ben Wyatt.

This very good file explains different ways to improve speed in your
AMOS-programs.

However some of the tips really surprised me. Ben states that A=A+1 should be
faster than both Inc A and Add A,1. He also writes that Repeat ... Inc ...
Until should be faster than For ... Next. I have been doing some tests on my
system and it clearly proves that this is WRONG!

I can not believe that Ben Wyatt has not checked his tips, so I must conclude
that the difference in speed is different on different system (I do not think
that Ben has a 68060?).

Anyway I am working on a small program that will test the speed of different
commands, and I am thinking that it should be run on different systems, so we
could clear out which commands is fastest on which system. The rest of the
message is an output of my not-yet-finished speed tester.

Do anyone has some comments on this?

You're right. I tested most of the routines on an 020 and some on an 030 and
they were faster on them. I think these are probably more average systems.

I'd like a copy of this program when you finish it. I'll try it on my system.
Does the program take CPU caches into account? That causes some wierd results
on my 030.

> Do anyone has some comments on this?

Sounds good to me. I'd like to see some results for the > and >= comparision
tests. I can't believe the one is slower than the other.

> [SNIP]

I'll add these test results to the list.

Hello everybody!

It feels really great to get so much respons about my question about the
"Super Mario"-scroll. Yes, I didn't give you much to go by, but I will
probably rewrite the scroll and put it in the mailing list or on Aminet
next week, allright? Right now, I'm REALLY busy (school...), so
unfortunately I don't have any time at all to program. But I will try to
have the scroll-example finished next week. Until then, you can check out
some of my older AMOS-programs. They can be found on Aminet, in dev/amos
(oh yeah?!). They are called "BESTOFSD.LHA" and
"MPLASMA.LHA". If you want a laugh, download "VARGOLLE.LHA". It's a
platform game that a friend of mine made ages ago. It's quite playable, on
a 060...;-) If you like that form of really lame game, please tell me. I
have about 50 disks with tons of old crap games...
CU!

Is there some way an amosprogram can detect if

I remember reading someones comments on hiding AMOS programs when
executed by renaming .abk files and hiding the orange screen to start.
How can you change the way AMOS starts up.
For example, when you do a directory listing on an AMOS stand-alone
disk containing your distributable software, lo and behold, there,
screaming in bright colours and agonizing sounds is a directory
called AMOS_System...
How can this be changed so that 
A) AMOS starts up and works using a new folder called say SYSTEM
B) All programs compile
C) The distributable disk also works with the new folder SYSTEM.
(SYSTEM of course is the renamed AMOS_SYSTEM drawer)
Anyone out there got any ideas?

Right. Reduction: Turning 4 pixels to 1. Can be done, fast, but probably
not fast enough for an arcade game.

Answer these simple questions and I will try and get to work on it:

1. Generalised routine, or specialised?
   (I.E. Do you want a routine written SPECIFICALLY for this project,
   which will be a bit faster, or a general one, that can be used for
   other stuff. More parameters, etc. would be the main difference).

2. How big an area do you want to reduce?
   (It needs to be a multiple of 8 horizontally, and 2 vertically.)

3. How many colours does your screen have?
   (Obviously, the less the faster!)

4. Is it double buffered?
   (Double buffering makes screen operations harder to code!)

5. Qualitative, quantitive or fast reduction?
   (Qualititive will create a palette table with all combinations of the
   four pixels, and search the palette for best matches, which it will
   use),(Quantitive is MUCH faster than qualitative, it just counts 
   the pixels in use. The most of any colour will be used.),(Fast is the
   fastest of all. It chucks out the other three pixels, and just uses
   one. This method is the only one that could be used realtime on a
   standard processor.)

By the way everyone, how can I tell if a message was addressed to everyone or
ALL??? It is very confusing!

Hi

Some time ago someone posted two AMOSPro accessories (AMOSPro_TOME.Lib
and AMOSPro_Range.Lib)I examined extensions with one program (if any one
needs it write to me it's very little and shows so much :) and saw that
extension need some banks like Map bank, Tail Typ Bank, Map Anim Bank...

Now does anyone have a program that creates thease banks, or at least
one bank of each type that I can use to make my one program.
Thanx in advace

A little footnote (at the top?) to the enclosed article: The filename for the 
stuff I uploaded to the private directory at Aminet should be all upper case, 
i.e. BETAEVEN.LZH. And no, it wasn't packed on a PC - I just changed the suffix 
to minimize the risk of colliding with someone else's .lha filename. (Actually I 
tried uploading it as Betatest.lha first, but got rejected.))

For the curious,the new filename is short for Betatest Eventyr, which is 
Norwegian for B. Adventure. Share And Enjoy, or Go Stick Your Head In A Pig.

  Just got the March archive from  Aminet  and  found a couple of things to
comment on. In the beginning of  the  month  there  was a little discussion
about folding loops, and I noticed one thing nobody mentioned.
  The special thing about Procedure  and  End  Proc is that they have to be
alone on a line. So when you fold up  a  procedure everything from the line
below Procedure down to and including End Proc becomes invisible. Loop (and
other block) commands can be anywhere on a line, e.g.

a$="":Repeat: A$=Inkey$:Until A<>""

This is a block all on one line; how  would  you  fold that? Some languages
only permit one command on each line, who would  want that?

  Closer to the middle of the  month  someone  asked  for information about
A\Box. Try  www.phase5.de/news/projectinfo/aboxe.  (The  final e stands for
English, leave it out and you get  everything  in  German.) There is also a
Norwegian amigite who's  got  a  great  site  with  lots of Amiga stuff (in
English) including information about the 'box (and a picture of a prototype
that looks really cool). I haven't  got  the  address here, but you may try
searching for his name, which is Alf Inge Wang.

  There was also yet another  discussion  about long files. *sigh* What the
"No limits" people seem to keep overlooking is that we're not talking about
one big file or a few big files. I checked the March archive and found that
there were 57 different  contributors.  Let's say there were no size limits
and one tenth of them mailed a 100K file  - that's half a meg just from six
people!  Not  to  mention  that  the  monthly  archives  grow  way  out  of
proportion, which causes lots  of  trouble  for  "back  issue" readers like
yours truly. Sure, to the  majority  (?)  who's  connected  at home and can
download straightto the hard disk  it's  "only" a question of how much time
and money they are willing to spend, but  to those who have to use floppies
to bring stuff home it's a question  of  Can  or Can't! (I use a PC for net
access which means the limit is 720K.)

Time to get a bit more personal...

  I noticed that one of my messages  got  a  bit messed up, with a chunk of
Hotmail HTML code in the middle (!).  If  you got it that way too, all that
got lost was the end of the last program line printing out the timing info.
You can copy that from one of the other programs in the series. None of the
following text was lost.

  *One* subscriber has asked for the betatest version of my text adventure.
Well, now I've figured out some of the secrets of uploading stuff [and if I
can do it, so can you... :\], so I'll put the file in the private directory
on Aminet (at wustl.edu) where it  should  remain  long enough for everyone
who's interested to download it and see  what they think about it. Look for
Betaeven.lzh.  I'm  also  planning to upload  some "official" stuff.  Watch
this space for further news.

  No, no, THIS space! :<)

  That was supposed to  be  a  snub-nosed  smiley,  in  case  anyone here's
keeping track of these things.

   YES, use the Default Palette command to set all colors to say 
   black or grey like this:

   Default Palette $0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0   

   which will prevent the orange (signal-flare) Amos start-up!!

   WHY?  If you have compiled your AMOS program then you do not
   need any drawers on your distributable disk EXCEPT the S, LIBS
   and FONTS drawers.

   LIBS drawer needs the mathtrans.library and diskfont.library.  As
   long as you compile with the include AMOS library you do not
   need the AMOS.library on your distribution-disk.

   FONTS does not need ANYTHING unless you are NOT using the
   standard ROM fonts, in that case you will need to place the fonts
   required by your program in this FONTS drawer on your
   distribution-disk.
   Actually, if you ARE using the ROM fonts I do not think you even
   need to include the FONTS drawer at all.

   S drawer, of course, needs your Startup-Sequence.


   There is NO need to include an AMOS_System drawer, at least as 
   far as I know.  I have NEVER included it on a distribution-disk.



>How can this be changed so that 
>A) AMOS starts up and works using a new folder called say SYSTEM
      
        Why do you need to change your actual AMOS program? No one
        will see this but you anyway.


>B) All programs compile

        ???

>The distributable disk also works with the new folder SYSTEM.
>(SYSTEM of course is the renamed AMOS_SYSTEM drawer)

         See Above!!



      Well, I hope this has been of some help, perhaps I do not fully
      understand what you are trying to do?

      Are you actually compiling you AMOS programs for stand-alone
      distribution or are you trying to use RAMOS for the distribution?

This falls in line with a lot of other things as well. First, use Request Off
to turn off the AMOS requesters. Then use Trap Serial Open
Channel,Port,Shared,XMode,7Wires : If Errtrap Then <serial port unavailable>

Use similar code for opening files, etc. and you will put more control in your
program's hands as well as hiding the AMOSness of the program.

Well met and godspeed,

When I divide something like this:

1717680/1000000

I get answer 1 but I want it to be 1.7

How?

I want to read the date in my computer with amos  without using 'copy date to
ram'

I did get some answer before but I couldn't get it to work.

That example used things like this:

Dreg(1)=Varptr(T$) : R=Doscall(-192) : NJ=Leek(Varptr(T$)) 
...and that's parts of Amos I know nothing about...

Use floats in the calculation:
1717680.0/1000000.0

If your numbers are integers to begin with, multiply them with 1.0 or add
0.0.

I must agree on this. Releasing an uncompiled program is unthinkable to me!

It also need mathieedoubtrans.library if you use double precision, and certain
extensions need libraries as I recall, like the CD32 joypad reader needs
lowlevel.library.

I could be wrong but I think you still need a FONTS drawer. Otherwise
diskfont.library (on WB2 and back definately) will not recall and the Get
Fonts function will quit the program (Even Get Rom Fonts! Stupid, Eh?)

That is like asking for a beating :) I would rather NOT RELEASE any software,
than admit `look I made this in AMOS'.

I`m not 100% sure, but I think that OS assigns fonts: to sys: if there is no
sys:fonts .

         Hello Everyone,


         I have uploaded my games to Aminet:

   

         game/action/SS2000.lha         which is StarStrike2000
         game/shoot/Tinvaders.lha      which is TurboInvaders


         They should be in the RecentUploads section until next 
      Monday or so.




         StarStrike2000 is written in AMOS and TurboInvaders is written
      in BLITZ.


         Both games are quite simple but, I think you will find them to 
      be solid and playable as well.


         Let me know what you think.  I am particulary interested in
      hearing from anyone who has trouble running the games.


         If you do encounter any crashes or lock-ups PLEASE let me 
      know what system you have (ie how much RAM, CPU, etc).



            THANKS!!


               Garfield Benjamin  (Unlimited Design)

         I AGREE completely with Matt on this. 

         WHY spend so much time trying to HIDE the fact your program
      was written using AMOS?  Instead spend that time tweaking your
      code, polishing up the graphics, etc.

         Recently, I was "talking" with Paul Carrington of Vulcan
      Software and I think he put it best when he said It does not
      matter what language the game is written in as long as it is good
      or to be precise...

      "If the game is good, it is good.  It does not matter what
      language you  wrote it in."





 Also, in response to the various people who responded to MY
 RESPONSE...


       YES, I realize that you MAY need a FONTS drawer but, I have 
      released disks without it. For example, if you slap my AMOS game
      StarStrike2000 on a boot-disk you do not need a FONTS drawer
      for the game to work.  At least I have not heard from anyone
      having problems with it.


      Of course, you need any additional libraries your program 
      requires in the LIBS drawer.  I was simply giving the
      "bare-bones" requirements to illustrate that you do not need 
      the AMOS_System drawer for a compiled program to work.

Technically, it is illegal to distribute an compiled AMOS Program unless
you include the 'this program was written with AMOS' logo screen that
comes with the compiler.... Not that I've ever heard of Europress suing
anyone.

I think it`s AMCAF that can take a font and save it as an ABK bank, thus
no need for FONTS:

After seeing so many Amos programs released that LOOK like Amos programs I
think AMOS has got a bad name in some people`s eyes. My attitude is write
something in Amos and tell the people it IS amos so they think "Amos? Wow!
You can make something this good in AMOS?" Besides I hate to say it but no
matter how may hiding tricks you use an amos program is always an amos
program. I you use sprites or icons etc the file will have AmIc or AmSp
near it`s begining if you view the file in a hex editor. Similarly
compiled programs have a tag too.

If you use the RAMOS program (Its like the AMOS editor, but with no GUI) to
run your AMOS listings, you need an AMOS_System drawer.

I always use the compiler, and have never had to use the system drawer.

This used to be the case but not now. 
As far as I can remember:
{
   Europress originally said but later realising that this could actually
   hinder your chances of getting your game published changed the legal
   issue so that if you were releasing a game you didn`t need to mention
   Amos anywhere, only send them a copy. Then after a month if they chose
   they could say that Amos was used to make your game
   ; or they could keep quiet ;-) 
}

Mind you as Europress have now given up completely on Amos and Amigans I
don`t think you`d be in trouble if you didn`t bother.

Status: RO
X-Status: 

Well, a proper hello to everyone on the list now that im back from UK into
the USA - an almost "not to be" as the woman in customs spotted my entire
AMOS library, books, and my raycaster notes, and she tried for 45 minutes to
prove I was making money on the side in this country, but she couldnt, and I
was let in. Good thing really, as I wasnt, as everyone knows Mushroom PD is
a non-profit library.

Anyhow, back to the purpose of this email. Im really considering postponing
extreme AMOS 4 again, as I onbly received 6 articles from the last calls for
help. According to logs, I have emailed 46 copies of EAIssue3, 23 of issue
2, and 20 of issue 1. Surely someone can do a review of an AMOS game, or get
someone to review the game that you wrote, and send it with some screenshots.

I didnt receive a single IFF or Text advert for any AMOS extensions,
programs, or sites. This is a shame, as I have a list of nearly 65 email
address` who are waiting to receive issue 4 when its received.

I have also only had one or two offers for coverdisk games/utilities and
would like to see a few more.

If I dont get much more of a response, ill leave the mag for another 6
months, and do what I did with issue 3 and just do every single article
myself, and do the articles over that period. the engine I wish to use is
finished, and just needs the articles included,m and it could be ready in a
weeks time. I realy realy want to get it out before or on Aprill 22, which
will result in Extreme AMOS 3 being one year old.

Well, I best get off, as I have a few more raycasting routines to try out.
Its looking ok at the moment. see ya later. Thanks for reading.

I agree with you. We must admit to everyone our games are made with Amos
and feel proud.
Except that the starting orange screen is horrible! And the requesters
too!
We dont have to hide the fact our programs are made in Amos, but we
have to work to make them look cool!

I thought that the removed that stipulation when publishers were rejecting

Thanks to all of you that helped me on the AMOS Deception.
Thanks to...
	Garfield Benjamin :)
	Ben Wyatt	  :)
	Laurie Curwood	  :)
	Paul Hickman	  :)
	Matt Ward	  :)
	Mr. Giark	  :)
	Nikola Smolenski  :)
You have all provided some valuable information for me, but it was
Garfield Benjamin who said...
	"It does not matter what language the game is written in
	 as long as it is good"
...that made the most sense to me.  
Again thankyou all, I haven't doubted the technical ability of this
newsgroup since I joined.
On a technical note, after much experimentation I found that to execute
a stand alone AMOS3d program you actually have to have the file...
	c3d.lib
...in the root folder of your distributable software.  Does anyone use
AMOS3d in AMOSPro?  If so Id like some optimisation tips.
Oh,  I wrote a 4part tutorial on writing your own 3d tank game in AMOS
using AMOS3d for an Ozy mag called the AUSTRALIA AMIGA REVIEW.  In
return for my services they gave me cash and a 1200/40HDD.
If anyone is interested I could upload the tutorials and heavily REMed
and of course commented code.
Anyway, Cheers Guys & Gals, you`ve made a friend.

I was wondering if someone could e-mail them to me?

Bongiorno Petro!
   Thanks indeed for the fantastic GUI extension. This is exactly what AMOSPro
needs; what's more it's easy to use and it works! 
   I notice that it's freeware and I congratulate you for this. (I will send
you a postcard of course.) 
   I think that your project (including AGA, screen promotion, etc.) is the
most important task facing the Amiga. The reason that the PC is popular is
because there's lots of software, and the reason there's lots of software is
that the PC is easy to write for (eg visual C etc). AMOSPro has always had the
best environment to write in - the editor's just a joy to use; but the
non-standard way it works, and the (previous) problems with using Intuition
have always held it back (in my opinion). With your extension these problems
are largely addressed.
   I have two questions:
   i) apart from the three demos that are included in your archive, are there
any more examples that I could look at?
and,
   ii) MUI seems to be becoming something of a de facto standard OS (in the
absence of further Commodore development). Paul Hickman did show a 'proof of
concept' to use AMOS and MUI, but felt he that this wasn't a useful thing, and
discouraged me from using it. How difficult would it be to port your extension
to support MUI, and MUIBuilder?
   Thanks again for some great work
   Ciau
   Rod

Good call! =)  I second that. IMHO if you made it.. then you get to decide 
whether to show how you did it.. (But personally, if you've made something 
impressive, show that it is made in amos, like someone else said, and let
the Amiga community know that AMOS is better than it's reputation seems to
show..

A) Amos 1.3 don`t have interpretter prefs (as far as I remember)
b) Even if we do, there`s still this-is-amos cursor flashing top left
B) It`s easier to change palette with Palette 0,0,0,0,0...

But this could be easily avoided by compressing a program :) I used some
CrunchProtector in combination with PP or Imploder, but now I see it could be
broken quite easily. Does someone knows which is easiest way to crunch files
so they couldn`t be decrunched?

Hi to you all,

I don't know what you mean by Europress support but, couple months ago I
spoke to them about bug in =Equ() for loading the equation file and they
send me a completely new AMOSPro_System disk. Even though the bug wasn't
fixed they tried to help me. You can also get a new AMOSPro User Guide
if yours is like mine in several parts after browsing it. IMHO this is
pretty good support even though I have no expiriance of any other kind
of suppport.

Hello!

I made an AMOS (Easy AMOS) game last summer. It is an old arcade game called
Western Gun, made by Taito in 1976. It's a two player only game, where each
player controls a cowboy. The idea is to shoot your opponent. There are also
cactuses and rocks which can help you avoid shots or can be used to steer
your shots at your opponent. The graphics are very green. :)

If you want to have a look at it, you can point your browser to
http://hem1.passagen.se/jooon/western.html and download the game, binary and
source + .abk files. Please note that the variables in the source is mostly
Swedish.

When I made the game, I thought it was very buggy (the shots didn't always
ricochet on rocks). When I bought a new computer the game worked fine though.
It requires at least 020 and some fast mem to work okay. But the game itself
is so simple so it can be made on a standard A500 with only 0.5 MB chip
although I don't know how (or don't have the time) to optimize it.

Bizzare huh, that and the fact that when comipled, unless you do graphics

If we all had sensible thoughts like that, then people like Bill Gates would
go out of business, as we woundnt be mindless enough to buy any Microsoft
products! hahaha.

I still dont know how he manages to sell a product for nearly 200 dollars,
which does nowhere near as much as our LoadWB command (which is only a few
K) and his stuff takes 200Mb!! I must be going wrong somewhere...

Yes it is!! Thank you Ben!!!

Well, you probably did your test from the amos editor, using the Amos
interpreter and your tests are right. But if you try to compile your code,
you'll see that Ben is right. It's strange but for example For Next is much
faster (about 300%) than Repeat Until when interpreted, but far slower (about
50%) when compiled. So now, since you release all your software compiled,
it's better using Repeat Until and A=A+1. Of course, sometimes you will still
use For Next since it's easier to read, but limit it for small loops or where
speed isn't important.

I have got a 030 and Ben's tricks work well.

Get AMCAF extension from Aminet: it has a very useful set of commands to
handle dates.

=Current Date : returns the date. It's a number counting days from 1-1-78.
=Cd Day(x)    : returns the day.
=Cd Month(x)  : returns the month.
=Cd Year(x)   : returns the year.

So try:
X=Current Date
Print Cd Day(X);"/";Cd Month(X);"/";Cd Year(X)

to have the whole date.

Do NOT use Get Fonts: it's a very stupid command and if you have a large
FONTS: drawer on your hd, you can see the disk looking for fonts for a long
while.

Use AMCAF extension or Easylife (better AMCAF since it doesn't need any
external library!!): it has got a command to load fonts from disk directly,
just telling the name and the size.

Or even better, store fonts in banks!

Wrong. When you start a compiled program, the orange screen shows up until you
open your own screen

UNLESS!

You don't use screen 0 (open your own screen, you lazy buggers!) and, when
compiling, change the `open default screen' option to NO

See my article in EA4 (sooner or later) and you'll find a whole bunch of tips
to hide amosity and keep track of a lot of the system.
 
Well met and godspeed,

Greetings.

Another weekly digest of questions and comments from yours truly.

As everyone knows, due to my studies, I usually don't have time to
access my mail and do any programming except on Friday nights and
weekends (If you want a fast response to mail sent to me (usu.
personally), you more than likely to get the fastest response from me
on the weekend, namely Saturday).

Okay, now it's time to get down to some business.

Firstly, I would like to welcome Laurie Curwood, Garfield Benjamin, 
and I believe Andrew Hawkins on board to the List. I know, I'm not 
the official welcoming committee, but, big deal? Anyhow, greetings!

Secondly, on the issue of "orange screens" in AMOS. Stupid or what? 
Goran testified to the fact that you could use the Interpreter config 
to change the orange color (which is exactly what I did several 
months ago after I got tired of that boring and bright color). 
However, typing from my PC here at the moment, I can't recall whether 
it matters or not if you changed the orange color or not on the 
Interpreter palette when you compile a program (e.g. you change the 
orange to a misty gray, like I did, and compile a program; I can't 
recall as to whether or not AMOS will momentarily bring up an 
grey screen, like you told it in the Editor, or the standard 
default orange screen.) Anyhow, who really cares? If your that scared 
about what someone thinks about what LANGUAGE you program in, then 
DON'T PROGRAM IN THAT LANGUAGE! (Namely, AMOS!)

Personally, I think that AMOS is a wonderful high-level Interpreter 
language that almost anyone can use (Pro being the most 
user-interfacial in my opinion), and if someone is experienced in 
programming, then you can crank out some *ReaLLy* cool programs in 
AMOS, games being the most obvious. Also, another advantage to AMOS 
is that if you ever wanted to port your program to another platform, 
let's say, a PC (*AhhHH*), then you could readily convert the source 
to a language like C or C++ (given the fact that you know the 
language, of course. Goes without saying.)

Ben Crowl remarked on this subject:

I second that as well. As most of you know, I'm programming a 
*Doom-like* engine (well, who doesn't know by now?) in AMOS, and it 
has come to my attention that Mush has recently being trying his hand 
at writing a raycaster (nice work). It CAN be done, both on the Amiga 
AND in AMOS. I started my 3D engine under the project name..

The Cafe Engine

..several months ago (conceived last Fall, programming commenced this 
Spring) and it has been coming along. Already breaking the 
limitations of a standard Wolf level, using my own method of 
"modified" raycasting. Much more efficient than standard methods 
(many thanks, btw, go out to Mr. John Bintz for providing some 
pointers on the subject and a some bits of code. Thanks!) Anyways, it 
is coming along, and you'll have to check my newly redone site for 
more details (if you haven't already). But, like I said, it can and 
WILL be done, on, yes the Amiga. And, I'm not a bit ashamed to say 
that I program in AMOS. It's by far the best language for the Amiga.

Btw, the word "Cafe" IS an acronym, however, the actual abbreviated 
words have been undecided, even though Mr. Fyri did have an idea:

> How about Calculation And Figuration Engine?
Eh, a little too technical, however, I'll keep it in mind.

Well, that's about it. Thanks again for reading.

Long live the Amiga!

Hello: AmosListers

On the sub of the orange screen in my CPC program the first line is
CLS 0, and the compiled version shows no sine of the orange screen.
Not that I am ashamed of Amos or any thing I gust think it is ugly.

On the sub of Star Strike 2000 I remember the original game being more
color full, and the ships being smaller.
Congratulations on your mastery of CPC especially in Blitz.


Mushy did you get the PAL TV max overscan size ?

Lastly the Genetic Species demo 2.0 can run in NTSC. You need to get
rid of the Intro, set your WB to Full overscan, and set multi-tasking
on. 
    Ok have fun.

What was the price for the User Guide?  (Strange they would still sell the book
but not the disks).

COMMAND LINE$ is available in AMOS the Creator (classic) if the
compiler is installed, and works just as Mush described.

NO! I did NOT do the test from the editor. As _written_ it was done from a
stand-alone COMPILED executable file. If you won't believe please go buy an
'060 and try for yourself.

Okay, so has anyone tried them on a '040, or is it just the '060 who is acting
"funny"!?

E.G. At a CLI, I type

Is there any way I can get "RAM:Test" into AMOS?

I need to do it for both AMOSPro and AMOS Classic.
Thankyou.

You can use the COMMAND LINE$ command in AMOSPro, and am not too sure if
classic AMOs has it. When you compile and run, with this in the first line

A$=Command Line$
... and your prog


If you compiled and did:

Run Program Ram:Test

A$ would conatin the string Ram:Test


You can also do anything after the command, and it will appear in A$.

Hope this helps

Bugger, i forgot all about that. I didnt take my miggie with me. Its in the
twinz V3 source somewhere, ill dig it off. You want the SCREEN DISPLAY synatax?

Genetic species has to be the best raycaster ive seen on the amiga yet,
although with baddies and stuff, it still needs a hell of a lot of work

If you use EHB (64 colour) mode and would like some fast commands get the
Falcon extension (0.37) from this address:

http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/6291/Index.Html

Features:

* Draw `Dark / Light Bars' that only affect the 6th plane (light/dark).

* Use tiles as templates for dark pattern. I.E. your tile shape is   
  stamped down on the screen, but instead of overwriting what was there
  before, it `darkens' it.

* VERY FAST Tile Paste command. 5-10% faster than Turbo version!

* VERY FAST Plot command. The fastest yet for an EHB screen!

* NO ERROR CHECKING! Dangerous, but VERY FAST!!!! Read docs carefully.

It is only 40k. Get it from the `AMOS' section. It contains full 
AmigaGuide documentation of all the commands, as well as a big example
program. Here is that EHB extension you wanted to see, Ben!

Yes where 0 is the first visible line on a PAL TV, and I also want the last
visible line number.

Screen Open 0,320,283,4,Lowres
Screen Display 0,,27,,
NTSC TV 0 to 229

Hi!

I am wondering if there's anyone who would like to help me
straighten out this NTSC-problem I have.....

Let's say I have a screen using 320x256 pixels in PAL.
Now, everyone with a PAL screen would see the whole
screen display, but....

If you have an NTSC screen, what would you see?
Would you loose some at the top and some at the bottom
,
or would you just loose some at the bottom?

I have made two little test-progs which I would appreciate if
anyone with a NTSC screen could run and mail me your
observations.
The two programs are lha-packed and the size is 18 KB.

Please send me a mail if your interested in helping me out!

   PLEASE NOTE that the following info is based on my system. It
   should be correct for ALL systems but, I cannot guarantee it.
   Anyway, this is the basis for my NTSC-PAL support routines...


   Generally speaking, your PAL screen will appear "lowered".  This
   combined with the fact that NTSC cannot show the entire 256-
   line PAL screen means you will indeed lose a good chunk of the
   bottom.


   I cannot give you an EXACT number of lines for a maximum NTSC
   display as it depends on the monitor or television. For example,
   my brother's television can display 228 lines at maximum while
   my television can display 232 lines and my monitor (which is what
   I now use) can handle 241 lines in NTSC.

   Theoretically, NTSC overscan should easily show 241 lines but 
   this is for the Amiga's hardware and does not take into account
   the actual viewing-device.


   I have never heard from any PAL users so, actually I do not even
   know if this looks fine to them or not so, bearing in my mind that
   this is all based on theory this is how StarStrike2000 handles it...

        
1. First, I define maximum NTSC display at 239 lines and maximum 
    PAL display at 252 lines (better to be on the safe-side and narrow
    the differences). Please note that I am coming from the angle of
    an NTSC-user offering PAL support. Certainly, use 256-pixels as
    your PAL display size because you know it will work and exactly
    where to position the screen!!

2. Next, (and this does not pertain to NTSC support but, I figure I 
     might as well cover everything at once) use
     Default Palette 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 which will tell
     AMOS to open it's screens with an all-black palette instead of 
     the default-orange.

3. The screen(s) are opened and immediately Flash Off and Curs Off
     are used.  

     NOTE that the screen(s) are opened at their maximum size which
     in this case is 16 lines for the Status-screen and 232 lines for the
     Game-screen.


4.  Now, keep in mind that SS2000's in-game display uses two
      screens (kind of like most other games). One for the Status-
      Bar at the top and a second for the actual play-field, this is how
      they are "centered" for PAL and NTSC...

      YOFFSET1=0 : YOFFSET2=0 : Rem Default for NTSC
      If Not(NTSC) then YOFFSET1=7 : YOFFSET2=19 : Rem Pal Adjust.

      Screen Display STATUSSCREEN,128,34+YOFFSET1,,
      Screen Display GAMESCREEN,128,40+YOFFSET2,,

      where the xx+YOFFSETx is the bit you're interested in.

 
                   
      
      Again, I'm not saying this is THE way to handle it but, I hope it
      helps...




                     Garfield (Unlimited Design)



   BTW - If my games do NOT look right in a PAL display then I would
                certainly appreciate someone telling me.  So, if you think
                they should be moved up or down a bit then just let me 
                know and I will adjust my routines accordingly.

                                                                                                          THANKS!!

It can seem strange, but AMCAF is your solution and it worths its price.

The source is 80K (no banks) and packs down with LZX to about 15K. The full

Does anybody know how to do a decent multi-directional parallax scrolling in
Turbo Plus...

Please mail me any code through private e-mail (Some people here don't want
those things to be sent through the Mailing list)

X-Status: 


This text contains some reactions on some
questions that were asked some weeks ago,
but better late than never :).

SKID asked for artists (for his games I presume).
Well, besides programming in AMOSPro V2 I can make
music in OCTAMed (and if needed convert it to
protracker). So if anyone needs some songs,
just ask me :).

Also, someone asked whether it was true that there is an
Amiga version of Quake. Well, it's indeed true. Actually
I saw it on a BBS some weeks before it appeared in the
Amiga Magazines. As you probably have read, it's converted
to the Amiga by a hacker so it's not sold by a company :(.
It consists of 4 lha archives of 2 megs. To run the game
you'll need an AGA Amiga, a 030 and 8 megs of memory.
To run it on a decent speed you'll need a
Cybergraphics card and a 040.

I havn't tried Amiga Quake because I've only got 6 mb of
RAM, but the sysop of the BBS I found it on ensured me
that it looked and played the same as the PC version.

Last but not least, to the people that live in Holland
(or do not mind driving a long distance ;)); there will be
small gameparty for Amiga's and PC's that I'll be going to.
(last year the were about 65 people)...
It will be held in June and the city it will be held in
is Haaksbergen. So if you want to know more about it look
at the drome party homepage: http://www.drome.demon.nl
or just email questions to me, because
I know some of the organisers.

Ok send your file.

I am curious can you PAL people use the boot options menu to run your
amigas in NTSC.

If so this may help. (info relevant to PAL screens running in NTSC)

Max NTSC overscan:    Screen Display 0,,26,,  0 to 233  234 lines

Max NTSC TV overscan: Screen Display 0,,27,,  0 to 229  230 lines

You can see each line if you look closely so the first line is not
visible but should have something on it, and the last 3 lines are not
visible but should have something on them. Using the full area will 
loss info at the edges as they are not square.

Hi all,
   Who knows about using AMOSPro and printers? 
   I use our A1200 '030 here at work with an HP Laserjet 5L (using a LaserJet
driver) and it doesn't seem possible to use embedded commands to alter, for
example, output from elite to pica, or double strike, etc.. Printer Send
(after printer open) works a little better than Lprint, but not much (ie it
only variably pays attention to the printer preferences). There also seem to
be some really strange bugs; eg :

printer open
a$="Test" : printer send A$

works, but:
printer open : printer send "Test"

doesn't, it prints nothing to the screen. Further,

printer open : printer send test$ : printer send test$ : printer send test$
:...

only prints the first string!

P.S. I just downloaded and tried the Jd extension; alas to no avail, similar
problems exist. Is this just my printer/driver combination? 
Thanks in advance
Rod

you would lose the 56 pixels at the bottom of the screen. Plus, the stuff
already on the screen would be slightly magnified vertically to fit the
entire screen area (or at least my PAL does that when i turn it to NTSC)

Im having a spot of bother. Im trying to work out the top and bottom
coordinates for an irregular shape box. Heres what I mean:

    top left:   5,5                      top right:  75,20



   bot left    5,105                    bot right:  75,90


As you can probably work out, the box is not the same height on both sides.
I would like to know how to find the top and bottom line coords (where the
pixel is) in the fastest possible way, using an algorythm that can work this
out no matter what size the other sides are.

The routine I have at the moment uses IF...ENDIF to find it, but it is way
too slow.

Thanks in advance

..for the Americans without PAL, it's really easy for us to use NTSC.  The
machine can be forced into NTSC mode, which effectively stretches the
display to fit on a PAL screen giving us a full-screen-NTSC display.  The
boot options merely forces the chipset into stretched mode.  Most PAL
display screens (TV or Monitor) are capable of handling the stretched
output.

Normally we just get everything in letterbox format.

Yes, Mike Sikorsky has (BTW, a converter for computer languages is called a
compiler :-)).

You can read a bit about it on my Future of Amos Homepage: 
http://www.xs4all.nl/~collin/amiga/foah.html

I suggest you first read the html-digest.

I haven't had the time to do additional work on these pages, so you won't
learn a lot, I am afraid.

Hi fellow Amos-users!

Does anyone know how to make your own fonts?

Is there some sort of editor for this?
I have drawn my own font i DPaint and
 would like 
to 
make a font file like those found in the
 SYS:Fonts-drawer
.


Also, can it be more than 2 colors?
(I would like to have an outlined font too..)

Anyone ever considered writing an AMOS to C convertor?

Or you  could do it yourself by drawing your own font on a hidden
2 colour screen which you Screen Copy from. This gives you better control
over how the 'print' command works, eg. printing only a single character
each refresh, or using a small random for the y coord for each letter,
whatever...
Screen Copy masking is quite usefull allowing transparent backgtrounds,
inverse text etc.
Scrolltexts work very well like this too. 

Anyone want example source?

I personally use the very old Fed from WB1.3. It's very easy to use, takes up
13k of diskspace and works fine even on WB3.1, 68060 and CyberGFX.
I can mail it to you, if you want to.

For this purpose, you will need some other program, which name I can't
remember at the moment, sorry.

Years ago a font make came with WB1.3 (gasp that thing?)
I don`t know of any equivalent.

Subject: Multi Plot Command
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: O
X-Status: 

If anyone is interested, I have almost finished coding a Multi Plot 
command, to add to my Falcon Extension (Available from my web page, read
a previous message). This command has the following capabilites:

Syntax:

Multi Plot X,Y,N,A

X=Starting X Coordinate of where you want to plot to.
Y=Y coordinate of where you want to plot to.
N=Number of pixels you want to plot.
A=Starting address of `colour data' in memory.

Let me explain excatly what it does!

Say you are doing some sort of minimap. 32x32 pixels for example. Normal code:

S=Start(10)      ; Bank 10 will contain your colour data (0-63, example)

For Y=0 to 31
   For X=0 to 31
      Plot X,Y,S+Y*32+X
   Next X
Next Y

Okay. I know you could optomise that multiplication, and change the plot
command for F Plot, Turbo Plot, Falcon Plot or whatever, but that is not the
point! Using the Multi Plot command, it would be like this:

For Y=0 to 31
   Multi Plot X,Y,32,S+Y*32
Next Y

Advantages of this method:

* Less code = easier to read.
* Don't have to worry about optomisation.
* Since you only call the command once (per line), it only has to find the
screen address once, only has to work out where to start from once, etc.
Rather than 32 times. This simple fact alone, triples the speed!!!!!

Interested? Good. It will be available VERY SHORTLY! First, though, I want to
know what features you think I should put in it! (Nothing too difficult). Tell
me if it is worth making the same command, but going down instead of accross
etc. And what you think the syntax should be.

Thankyou.

One or 2 points. It would be nice to do like MultiplotH or MultiplotV for
both horizontal and vertical, and also, it would be nice to have another
parameter, like S, for STEP in points between each dot it makes, as im sure
that not everyone wants the points next to each other all the time. For example

For Y=0 to 31
   Multi Plot X,Y,32,S+Y*32,16
Next Y

And before execution, the extension works out where the points should be
placed equally.

Hope this helps

OK, ill try and explain this problem again. Im making a perspective
box/rectangle, so naturally, one end will be close, and the other end
smaller, so simulate the depth of the box. Here is an example: (crap ASCII art)


                       |
                       |
                       |                                  |
                       |                                  |
                       |
                       |

Now, the tops would also be joined (buit the characters look crap on this
PC). Im trying to find the quickest possible way, to find the top and bottom
Y coordinates of these lines quickly and effectively, no matter how big or
small the sides are in accordance to each other.

Its very important that I try to find a quick way of doiing this, as at the
moment, I am using IF...ENDIF moving one pixel at a time, which is very time
consuming to my programs.

I hope that this explains the problem a little better this time

I know the top coords of the 2 lines drawn, but it is the top and bottom Y

OK, I think I understand this problem now. Hopefully, this program
should solve your problem...

X1=10     : X2=95     : Rem Left and right edge x positions
YTOP1=30  : YTOP2=50  : Rem Top coordinates
YBOT1=150 : YBOT2=115 : Rem Bottom coordinates 

' Draw verticle sides  
Draw X1,YTOP1 To X1,YBOT1
Draw X2,YTOP2 To X2,YBOT2

' Get gradients of lines (*256 so it is int and power of 2 for speed)
GRADTOP=(256*(YTOP2-YTOP1))/(X2-X1)
GRADBOT=(256*(YBOT2-YBOT1))/(X2-X1)

For X=X1 To X2
   ' Get coordinates at current x position
   YTOP=YTOP1+((X-X1)*GRADTOP)/256
   YBOT=YBOT1+((X-X1)*GRADBOT)/256
   ' Plot the top and bottom points 
   Plot X,YTOP
   Plot X,YBOT
Next X

How about a multi plot that can do a whole box? Say, something like:

Multi Plot x1,y1 To x2,y2,A

And how about commands which can insert and delete elements in an array
quickly. Obviously not resize it, just shift the data about. It would
be far more efficient and less cumbersome than the normal AMOS method.
The command could be:

Array Insert Array(n()),n

Or something like that. I'm not totally sure about the AMOS Array()
function, but it seems to be the only way of doing such things with
extensions.

A command I would find occasionally useful would be something that pastes
a bob image down, at a zoomed down ratio. eg

Paste Zoomed Bob n,x1,y1 To x2,y2

So this:

Paste Zoomed Bob 4,100,100 To 120,130

Would paste bob 4, resizing it to fit into the specified box. With support
for masks if possible.

The current alternative method to this is to open a new screen, Paste Bob
on to it, Zoom it down, Get Bob it and Paste Bob it on the original screen.
Rather a messy and slow method, I'm sure you'll agree.

Try this (undocumentated) AMCAF command if you like (only in the registered
version  though),  but  it only works on 32 coloured screens. And remember,
that the chunky buffer is destroyed, so copy it to a temporary place first.

C2p Convert chkbuf,wx,wy To screen,ox,oy

Reply to Mush...

I think I know what you are trying to do in your box-line thing so I will
try and explain two methods I know...
To get the Y position of the slope as you go from one point to another can
be solved by using either a linedraw routine or calculating the difference
of Y position on the slope and adding it (negative gradients as well) to
the current Y position...

The first method can be done by using a Bresnham (i think thats how you
spell it ;-) line draw, this basically is a line draw routine that uses
only integer numbers... you give the line routine the start and end (the
top and bottom of you box) and for every increment in the x position, you
will be able to get the y position, and becoz the box can probably be
reflected horizontally you can just use -ypos+screenheight to get the
bottom of the box Y co-ord.

The second method means getting the gradient of the slope and doing a loop
from the start X to the end X of the box and for every point inbetween,
increment the y position by the difference in heght between each pixel,
this does mean using floating point numbers thought so it`s VERY slow, but
then again, so was the first method(slow I mean...) but at least they work
:-)

I will try and post the bresenham linedraw routine... I use it for
raycasting at the moment(that will soon change though)

It sounds like you are already using run length slicing.
This is just about the fastest way of drawing a line IF you are coding in
assembly.

You could speed up the inner loop by checking for the gradient before you
start the loop and branching to four seperate routines depending on the
gradient.


    /<--45%
|1 /
| / 2    
|/____
|\  
| \ 3
|4 \

You probably know that already, can you be a little more specific about
what you need? what are you actually doing with the result, and how is this
function to be called? do you calc every value from left to right? do you
need multiple y values for a single x in quadrants 1 and 4.

I guess you use 'If' to avoid a divide?

Division is slow. The bitwise Ror is a faster way to divde by 2. that would
at least give you the centre of the line, I think AMOSPro auto converts
those divisions, but the point is to divide by 2 or 4, not 5...

Hope this helps...

Hi to everyone!

I just changed from an old A2000 (orig CPU) to an A4000/30, and was more than
happy to find out, that there's definetely no problem with the software I use
(Happy compatible Amiga). There's no difference at all except the speed. Now I
wonder, if anyone on the list has made some expierence with AMOS Pro and a 060
CPU. Does AMOS work without problems (not only the code but also the editor
environment). What about extensions?

Thank you all, it's a great list (except that I had to read more than a
hundred mails since I wasn't online for more than 10 days I think..)

:-)

Bye, Mark

Sure, AMOS Pro runs fine and smooth on a 68060. There's no problems at all!

Lovely, isn`t it.  I still remember the moment when I first
powered up my new 4000/030 after having used an A500 for 4 years...

Well, I don`t use many extensions here, so I leave that part of the
answer to someone else, but the APro editor/interpreter/compiler
itself seems to work just fine - I certainly can`t recall any
problems occurring after I swapped the 030 for the 060.

Hello everyone.

I've been experiencing problems with my AMOSpro Compiler. If I try to
compile a program that has memory banks in it, the compiler says "Not
an AMOS program". However, bankless programs compile fine. Is there
something wrong with my AMOSpro Compiler or is it supposed to function
that way?

I can't quite renenber it, but either you can't compile a program with Icon
banks or you can't compile a program with odd banks (ie. the length of the
bank is odd).
Try both things to work it out...

There is no problem at all with AMOSPro and 060's, although the speed
difference between a 1200/030 and a 4000/060 is not that much when you start
throwing a lot of bobs around.

Thanks for the info. (here was I thinking that compilers compiled
interpreted code into machine code) :/

I read the short list, but what happened to these things between 1994 and
now? Given that these topics still appear on the list (AGA etc..) and
people still write AMOS extensions it seems nothing ever came of it?

Please tell me differently.

PS is Mike Sikorski still on the list?

Hello all!!!

I apologise to any of you that have tried to download STAR FIGHTER but
I'm having a problem with my service provider.
It seems that when I upload the LHAs to my homepage somewhere they are
tampered with either by my FTP program or my service providers FTP.
The result is that the LHA files are compromised and rendered useless.
However, I have notice that some of your have dropped by (OR IS IT JUST
THE SAME PERSON???) and I am very appreciative for the interest :)
Anyway, please be patient.  I am sure that when I solve this problem
there`ll be no hassle downloading in the future.

Long Live Amiga,

AFAIK in AMOS Pro everything works ok (except  for  lots  of  Enforcer-Hits
from  the  Editor,  but  they don't harm a lot). AMOS Creator however might
make problems -depending on the version.

One or more of your memory banks has an uneven length. Use the Bank Stretch
command to make the size of the banks even and then try again.

Hi all!

Can anyone shed some light on a little programming problem please?

AMOS Pro (v2.00) supports med through Med Load, Med Play etc. but only works
with Octamed MMD0 and MMD1 modules (and Not MMD2 as used by Octamed 5 up)
can anyone help? I think It (The solution) would probably involve library
calls, but I can't figure them out.

Cheers all,

You can make calls to the Medplayer.library (in the music section of my
library, there is a MEDPlayer.Lha file), and I think that uses library
calls, im not too sure.

If anyone knows of a good ripper to get MMD2 modules, I would be gratefull
of its name.

Memspot        dc.l 0

               move.l d0,(Memspot)

I've tried everything I know to make my assembler do something like 
that.  Will it?  Or will I have to reserve areas of memory instead?  Thanks.

I have been working hard on my texture mapping routines for my future
raycaster. The original file I cretaed, made 58 frames, and completed this
cycle in 31.8 seconds. I have added a few more routines to it, and have now
made it so that it will compute the full 58 fram animation in just, a
staggering 8.1 seconds!!! No AMAL, bobs, or sprites were used, and ZOOM was
used to draw each frame. The original source is a 32 colour 64x64 image,
which is mapped onto a slanted face, at a rate of around 0.15 frames a
second on average, which isnt bad for AMOS, as I still havent added a
chunky2planar routine.

I have no idea how a c2p routine works, so if anyone has any example source,
could they pass it on to me?

This new demo (and lots of info about it) can be gotten from
http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/ray.htm as well as a texturemapping AMOS
listing. Thanks for reading.

Greetings.

Before I start, did everyone get my last digest last week (Friday the 
11th is when I sent it out)? I think everyone probably did, as I saw 
several responses to some comments I had made (Mr. Wilkinson on Amos 
to C converters.) Eh, well, just making sure everyone got it.

I do have one thing to say about the amount of mail I've been 
accumulating over the weeks (since I only check it over the weekend).

Mr. Mark Schntte said:
> Thank you all, it's a great list (except that I had to read more 
> than a hundred mails since I wasn't online for more than 10 days)

Well, that's true, like I said.

On Mush's line drawing problem, Mr. Howarth said:
> I will try and post the bresenham linedraw routine... I use it for
> raycasting at the moment(that will soon change though).

That would be nice just to look at. You do that (post it).

Well, I think that's all for this digest, which was really rather 
small, for those of you who know how long most of mine usually are 
(7 or 8k). Anyhow, be sure and stop by my pages and check out the 
progress on my engine (Mush's as well, he's coming along on his. 
Hopefully, this won't turn into a little friendly competition :) But, 
I'm pushing for mine here, so visit mine first, then his. :)

Btw, for those wondering about those areas (on my Web site) 
that are "under construction", they ARE under construction, and will 
be completed as soon as possible, even though I am NOT rating them 
top on my priority to-do list, so they will be done soon but not 
immediately. There, I said it. THanks.

And thanks again, everyone, for reading this.

Long live the Amiga!

I don't think this is the problem.  I never turn Looping on.  I will try
it.  (The bug only happens once in a while which makes it tough to test
anything...)

Also, it only happens once in a while.  Not always.  I never call Sam Loop
On/Off anywhere in my program.  Maybe my problem has to do with if I try to
play another sample before the first one is finished?

Maybe I could make Play16 resident and call it from AMOS?

I noticed this problem being asked in an AMOS-list-archive before I joined

I remember reading something Francois wrote about that in one the source
code for the music extension.

It was something like `if you have a lot of data, put <blah> in front of it.
This tells the compiler that it is data and it won't mess around with it. This
has never happened to me, but if things go wrong, try this'.

I don't have a clue what the command was. It may have been for the assembler
actually, but it was definately there.

Someone else read |Music.s and can clear this up?

..this is one of the famous 'known bugs of amos'.  I think if you don't
switch to workbench, the problem reduces somewhat, but don't quote me on
that one.  Overloading the sammple output system with a 'bell' works, as
does quitting amos and reloading.

..sam raw may have better success than sam play.  At least to some extent.

I've seen this problem many a time. It's an AMOS bug. If you want it to start,
flick to workbench, then back to amos. Bingo, samples loop. You do need to use
sam loop off to stop it.

Also, to loop only one channel, try this:

Sam Loop On
Sam Loop Off %1001

Makes channels 0 and 3 not looping, channels 1 and 2 looping. You can also use
the channel mask to play a sample in only one channel and alter the volume in
only one channel. Just a couple more tidbits the manual neglects to mention.

Well met and godspeed,

Actually, that sould be "1 frame every .15 second on average". I was
dividing 58/8.1 to get the answer and muddled up the numbers.

Here's a collection of bugs or other curious things I have found in
AMOS.
- The AMOS classic manual states there is a command called Llist, which
outputs the program code to the printer. This command does not exist.
- Also in AMOS classic, I found that the command On Break Proc doesn't
exist. This might have been fixed in AMOSpro, but I don't remember.
- If you try to use user-defined functions as procedure parameters,
e.g. MYPROC[FnA(123),FnB(456)] you get a "Illegal User Function" error.
- You have to use a Wait Vbl after Dual Playfield to show it properly.
This is not mentioned in the manual, or is it?
Has anyone else experienced similar or other bugs? I'd like to know.

There was a leaflet in my box of AMOS 1.2 stating that Llist never was imple-
mented, but that for some reason it was written about. The AMOS-way of Llist
is to go to the Blocks menu and select 'Print Block'. I forgot the details;
it's been awhile since I worked with AMOS.

Scores. -2^3 yields 8 instead of -8 -- this was never fixed. Scrolling
DPF's with values which are not a multitude of one another (say, the first 
with 'speed' 4 and the other with 3) leads to a annoying amount of flicker.
The windowing routines are buggy: clicking in an obscured part of a window
brings it to the front, even there is another window in front on that spot.
Print # in 1.36 can only cope with strings. Large arrays will start accessing
random locations if the index exceeds a certain number (I forgot which one).
There exists an off-by-one error in the Get Block command (I think -- it's
been five years at least since I wrote Mandarin about this one) which
requires you to specify a slightly different set of coordinates to get the
block you want. The editor can display erroneous text now and then.
Load Iff fails with large screens (>640x512).

I don't know the situation with AMOSPro, but I'm convinced it has its fair
share of bugs as well.

Maarten

To All 
Can someone help me with a small but irritating problem I am having
with a little prog I am trying to get working.
What I want to do is use AmosPro to create a file in Ram called Datapath
and then execute it with Amiga dos.
If you look at the example below it should create a file called Datapath
containing "CD workbench:data".
Now the hard part, the file should change the current directory to 
workbench:data (which does exist on my system).
But What I get is "object not found  CD failed returncode 20",
I think I have found why it doesn't run because there seems to be extra
 characters at the end of the file, I.e. the example below should create a file 
18 characters long including Return
But the actual file is 20 long and its these extra characters that cause the 
problem, If I load the file into a Text Editor and delete the invisible 
characters at the end and resave the file  it runs fine.
So the Question how do I create a file without the extra characters?
I have tryed CHR$(13)/CHR$(10) After A$ but no luck. 
And I can remove any extra characters easily inside Amos.

a$="workbench:data"
C$="CD "
A$=C$+A$
Open Out 3,"Ram:Datapath"
Print #3,A$
Print #3,Chr$(13)
Close 3

Any help would be appreciated
Thanks Steve.

The way I see it the fault MUST lie in the EOL chars. AMOS writes CRLF
EOLs, whereas AmigaDOS expects LF EOLS. So you might want to do the
writing this way:

Open Out 3,"ram:datapath"
Print#3,A$;Chr$(10);
Close 3

Remember to ALWAYS use a semicolon (;) in Print# commands if you want
to write AmigaDOS readable files!

First, Amiga uses Chr$(10), not Chr$(13) to terminate a line. Second, AMOS
slaps both to the end of every line when doing things the way you are.

A$="WorkBench:Data/"
C$="CD "
C$=C$+A$+Chr$(10)

By the way, are the files that you upload to Aminet checked by someone
before they are put in the archive? Yesterday, I uploaded some mods and
today I saw that they did'nt go into the directories I had suggested, but
the directories were suitable anyway.
Amiga will never die!

Does anyone have a good example of a Chunky2planar routine I can look at in

Ive managed to get a copy of devPac, and am not sure on how to integrate any

Can someone send me an ASM program, which can be merged into AMOS, and
explain to me how to use it. I would like to write an ASM version of ZOOM,
and would be interested in routines which will draw onto the screen, or draw

Also about converting Amos to C.  Converting Amos to AmigaE is much 
easier! since E handles screens and graphics and stuff far more

If you've got the AMCAF Extension, a call to

Extdefault 1

at the beginning of your program should fix this. If this doesn't work, try

Break Off
Extremove 1
Extreinit 1
Extdefault 1
Break On

Anyway, if you got AMCAF, you don't need the buggy Music Extension anymore ;)

Do you mean Amis or Amos? The first is a text editor, the second the focus of
this list.

I once started an Amos2E compiler, but I never got far. I do, however, still
have a handconverted program, in which I tried to write re-useable E-routines
that simulated Amos ones. If anyone is interested, I could put them up for
downloading on my homepage.

I never got around the dynamic string allocation. Once you've got that, you're
on the way home. Also, I had a lot of problems writing a decent parser.

It's basically very simple. You first need to code something in PC-relative
code. That means that stuff like jsr and jmp are out of the question; in-
structions like 'lea Data, a3' should be coded as 'lea Data(pc), a3'. If
you neglect these requirements you'd better make sure you have your ticket
to India handy. Your code should also be one segment. Finally, Devpac is
not capable of writing out raw code, it always wraps a set of hunks around
your code. You need to remove these hunks manually before you load the code
into AMOS. (It's not hard, if you stick to PC-relative code and 1 code
segment, you just need to remove the first 32 bytes and the last 4 bytes.)

Of course, you can circumvent these problems, but then you need to call
on LoadSeg() to load your code into memory. I have never tried this, but
I see no reason why this should fail. 

Lets assume an example:

	addq.l #8, d1
 	rts

This code adds 8 to the register d1. You can Poke the code into memory your-
self, it's just four bytes. I've assumed this is done in bank 10. Next you
program in AMOS:

	Dreg(1)=100
	Call Start(10)
	RESULT=Dreg(1)	

which should yield 108 as the answer. I've forgotten whether 'call' is the
right instruction, but you probably get the idea. First you setup d1 to
contain 100, then you call your small program. That simply adds 8 to what-
ever is stored in d1, and then returns. AMOS then reads what is inside
d1 -- 108. 

Using this technique, I've written a small program which converts AMOS'
FFP numbers into IEEE-compliant ones; I could then use my FPU from within
AMOS 1.36. It's not easy to do (AMOS Pro solved this problem on a much
better level) but it worked!

There are plenty of asm-c2p routines available on Aminet; if you change
the screen base to point to the memory region where AMOS stores the bitplanes
you're in business. I believe it's Screen Base or Phybase which gives you
the required addresses. There was a special demo on the Amos Classic Compiler
disk illustrating a certain effect programmed with ML. You should take a look
at this.

However, if you are not familiar with assembly language, I'd advise you to
study that first. There is no point in messing with it if you don't know
the limitations and possibilities.

Hope this helps a bit,
Maarten

Hello. I`m back after a months break with a few questions at the 
ready.

1. Everyone go and download two of my games (or more if you want).
   Specifically. Banana Islands and Kill Em All. (Nice titles I know)
        http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~agm/banana.html
        http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~agm/kill.html
 OR link to them at:    http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~agm/amiga.html
    I think that both of them are quite reasonable compared to the 
usual standard of AMOS stuff. Admittedly, I knicked SOME gfx of 
people (but not without significant changes to them) and they can slow
down but.....   oh someone just tell me what you think please??!

2. Does anyone use the Turbo extension?
   I have a problem using the faster icon 32 commands. They often 
cause graphical displays to go wrong (especially if memory is low) 
and if you try to display them anywhere near the sides of a screen, 
they are moved so that they fit fully on. I realise that the author 
cut down on clipping to speed them up but what i`d rather is that 
they are simply not pasted at all rather than moved where I don`t 
want them. Any ideas?

3. I don`t suppose that the AMOS source code has been released into 
the PD in the last month? Thought not.

4. Using a combination of the JD extension and the turbo extension, 
there are commands to turn off multi-tasking (Multi No and JD Multi 
off - I think). Well these give a reasonable speed increase but as 
the authors say, it disables the keyboard. One of the extensions (I 
can`t remember which) gives a command - n=Raw Key(x) - which is 
supposed to overcome this, but it is EXTREMELY unreliable and often 
just causes a lock out. Any one have any solutions? I also find that 
these multi tasking off commands will crash AMOS quite often even if 
you turn them off at the end of your program.

5. I`m sure I`ve some other things but I can`t remember right now.
   
Thanks for reading!

What is an amicable shareware fee in the USA? What I mean is, what is
reasonable, and what isnt. In England, I would have my shareware

I dont want to set a ridiculous price, and get no registers, so could
someone in the USA please tell me the prices they have used. I still have no

What is a reasonable price for PD/SW ? If you ask me I would have to say that
you should go to a game store and look around, and if you find any thing like
what you have created then charge a price similar to that. If not make your
program Gift-Ware.

Don't use that command. It crashes/corrupts for me as well. There are
other fast 32 icon commands, aren't there?

No. :-(

Umm, don't turn multitasking off. That would seemingly solve all your
problems with crashing and reading the keyboard (with Raw Key, it can't
detect multiple key presses at the same time, which could also be a
problem). Surely you can't be that desperate for the speed? I'm sure
there are better ways to accelerate your code.

They may be checked for little things, like the correct lay-out of the readme
file, the existance of a readme file and the use of a correct archiving format
(like lha).

However, stuff like 'does it run on my machine?' or 'does it break any
copyright laws?' (I am told mods are great offenders here) cannot be checked
in advance. However, Urban Mueller (the main Aminet administrator) will remove
offending files, and authors may upload newer versions of their stuff. So if
you want something changed, first mail the author personally, and if what you
think is wrong is grave enough, mail Urban.

I think this service works perfectly and has given us not only the largest
collection of freely distributable files in the world (!), but also one of the
best collections. (People who have ever tried to find something on a Wintel
oriented server will know exactly what I mean).

Please consider sending the Aminet people a thank you note.

Does anyone have an extension list they can send me?
I saw one on a list before I joined, but I stupidly deleted it.

Thankyou!

And on a different note, Adam Parrott suggested to me that the CRAFT
extension uses one .Lib file, but takes up two extension numbers (18 & 19). Is
this possible? If so, how can it be done?

Thanks in advance,

Laurie.

What is the latest version of the Easylife extension?

On Aminet, it seems to be 1.1, but I seem to have 1.44 installed in AmosPro!

Also, where can I get an Amos Classic version of Easylife?

Craft comes in two bits - the main lib and a second extension called
muscraft - an improved sample/music extension. I can`t tell you much
more as I only had them for a few days before I got fed up reseting my
amiga when Amos locked out on me after 5 minutes! (craft and my amiga
didn`t seem to get along)
