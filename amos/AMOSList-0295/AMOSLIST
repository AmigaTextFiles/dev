If I were you, I wouldn't even try.  Europress would not stop at an instant to 
sue for breach of copyright etc.

The best thing for you to do would be to contact Europress yourself and ask 
for permission, as the members of ADT had done previously.


Patience is the key.

Paul.

I think Ryan has other things on his mind now, since he started working for 
Cybergate.  He sometimes doesn't reply to email, and seldom has much to say 
anyway.

His priorities are definitely not with the Amiga *or* Playfield anymore.
	
We are also waiting on money over here....  RYAN!  WAKE UP.

Europress included a patched version of AMOS3d with the AMOSPro compiler to
work with AMOS Pro. It works fine but if you try to compile something with it
the system answers you "Unable to load 3d library" (or something like that)

No, because I have to know which clear squares connect to which. I mean, 
what do you exactly mean with checking the array. AFAIK checking the 
array implies resorting to some form of recursive programming.
(I learned that term from someone who sent me an example once of the 
core of minesweeper, and he spoke of recursive programming.)

So, could anyone post me something similar?

Eh? Mine works fine. Admittedly, i havent used it much (only to put a
nice 3D "insert Disk 2" logo up) but it seems to be OK. The actualy
object designer id awful though..is there any better ways to design the
objects, or an upgrade?

I archived all of the messages for January and uploaded them to AmiNet.
The filename is AMOSList-0195.lzh and will be in dev/amos.

I updated the FAQ to list all the new files for or in AMOS.  I will post
the list after this message.  If you want a copy of the FAQ, please email
me.

Since it seems that Ryan Scott is too busy for things, will someone else
need to take the AMOS Web under their control?  I can do it if needed.

Let me know.

AMOS 3D works fine with APro.  You do have to switch out the 3D.Lib with the
AMOSPro3d.Lib that comes with APro.  Also, once you have compiled a 3D prg, you
will have to include the c3D.Lib in the same dir as the program, as it needs
this Lib to run.

And, other than the modeller only working under AD1.3, I have yet to find any
problems with it.

Well met and godspeed,

ACS on the Amiga is almost identical to the c64 version. What I meant by
the DuneII comment was that I WISH there was something like ACS to
create things like DuneII, not that such a thing existed. It was merely a
suggestion if someone was going to make one.

I tried out this routine last night and with some small modifications it worked.
The logic was spot on, just some syntax and spelling problems.

I couldn't get the "pop proc[1]" type statement working nor could I find
reference to using pop proc in this manner. Please enlighten me if this 
is possible.  I simply used:

; button declared as global
      button=1      
      pop proc
 
I think I had problems with the START_TIME variable name as it clashed with a 
reserved word so I just used BEGIN_TIME.

Where Paul used "If START_TIME" I used "If BEGIN_TIME<>0".
Are these If's testing the same thing? (notwithstanding my change of variable name)

I would also like to test for the joystick being held or pressed to the left or right
or just tapped as well as the button being tested in this manner. Later I will probably
want to do the same for up and down!

Q1. Should I incorporate all of this in the one procedure which checks every feature of
    the joystick in one test of the joy(1) function or should I write seperate procedures.

Q2. I am just playing around with writing a program to move a car (bob that is) around on 
     the screen eventually with the ability to make 15 degree turns in an overhead perspective.
     The controls would be something like : press and hold fire button to accelerate
     press left to turn anticlockwise by 15 degrees and right to turn clockwise 15 deg.

     The car is moving around the screen but is a little (well, a lot) erratic and the feel
     is just not there.
      
     Has anybody out there written a car racing game that would give me some clues or code
     or logic for handling the "mechanics" of steering a car around.

 Q3. I seem to recall the Skidmarks game documentation referring to using BSpline quadratics
     for the movement of the cars around corners. Does anybody know anything about that?
     I seem to recall that they even supplied some of the assembler code they used. Yes I
     know it was written in Blitz Basic but they also used calls to assembler code. 

Thanks ,

Well, if anyone wants to send me an old copy of DuneII, I'll check it out 
and consider it.

Hi all,

AMOS Pro has some commands to play med moduleS But it hasn't
a command to change med volume. Some of you can tell me if
is possible to change it in an other way or if exist an
extension that can help me? I think EME do this but i'm not
so sure...

Right now the biggest problem I have is the user interface. The actual 
code for the game is, of course, a problem, but trying to make an 
interface that is easy to use, but small code-wize is a problem. For the 
people who had interest in my program, please tell me what you would like 
menu-wize.  

Origiinally, everything was in the right-button menubar. The problem with 
this was obvious.. the screen was being wasted.  Now, I've got a little 
menu that can be selected by mouse or by using the cursor keys. 

If I really wanted to, I could just make the menu items "1) Edit 
Objects,  2) Edit Graphics" or something -- no color or mouse interface. 
That would be eternally easier for me to code, but cheesy to look at and 
use. 

Also, I'll probably change the name to something more... original.

LEt me know what you would like. As for the DuneII idea.. well, someone 
explain to me what that's like.

Later..

  The core of the "step" routine would look something like this:

Procedure _STEP[X,Y]
   'W and H are the width and height of the board
   Shared W,H

   If BOARD(X,Y)=-1
      'Oops, he stepped on a mine
   Else If BOARD(X,Y)>0
      'Display the count of surrounding mines
      DISP_COUNT[X,Y]
   Else
      'Square is clear, display it and step on surrounding squares
      DISP_CLEAR[X,Y]
      'Loop through surrounding squares.  Min() and Max() make sure we
      'don't go off the edge.
      For Y2=Max(0,Y-1) To Min(H-1,Y+1)
         For X2=Max(0,X-1) To Min(W-1,X+1)
            If X2<>X or Y2<>Y
               'Call _STEP recursively to step on the surrounding squares.
               _STEP[X2,Y2]
            End If
         Next X2
      Next Y2
   End If
End Proc

  Anybody get the idea I've written one too? :)  For that matter, I even
did a 3-D one, if anyone's interested.

I'm gonna take over as Webmaster and have got access to Cybergate for the
updating. Unfortunately I'm having trouble getting my telnet daemon to
recognise the fact that I want to use ZModem to transfer the stuff.
Why the hell don't they use good ol' ftp? :(

If you've got any suggestions for the site, drop me a line.

Paul Hickman; how did you upload stuff to the web site?

  Yeah if it is small enough send it!  I have one of these pads and will 
soon be modifing it for HG.  It would be great to use it for other apps 
as well.  I tried modifing it before the way Psygnosis said in the HG 
manual but it seems they got it backwards.  :(

Yes very interested, what do you mean by modified Sega (saga) Genisis 
joypad? Would it work with a six button control pad if modified?

Subject: Reading 4 buttons + more ...
Content-Length: 762
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Hi,
 
  Seeing many messages about reading 4 button this, and 2 button thats, how
about putting these procedures on one of the WWW Amos Playfield sub-pages? I've
seen procedures to read 2-button joysticks, CD32 control pads, Sega pads, and a
few more obscure ones. (I don't actually have in my posession any of these at
the moment, but I would like them all).
 
  If there are any difficulties with this, then I would be almost happy to be
given a copy of them all, and I would provide them to anyone who requests them.
(at least until Summer'95 anyway).
 
  In the meantime, does anyone have any code/extensions that handles a second
mouse or even a 3 button mouse in Amos ?

I'm gonna be Webmaster for the Playfield Amos W3 site from now on.
Paul Hickman was tending it previously but is now bogged down with his
studies.

I'll be maintaining the site on my machine locally, then uploading the new
pages/gifs to the site when I'm happy the HTML code and links are OK.
( As soon as I can figure out how to do upload ZModem with telnet ):

If you've got any suggestions about the site, drop me a line.

Cheers,

Subject: Iff anims
Status: RO
X-Status: 

I have a problem with playing Iff anims. When I try and make them looping,
ie play continous, a blank frame appears at the start of the loop. Can any
one help?

Open In 1,"Any anim"
L=Frame Load (1 to 1000)
Close

Do
     P=Frame Play(10,1,0)
     Double Buffer
     For X=2 to L-1
          P=Frame Play(P,1)
          Screen Swap
          Wait Vbl:Wait Vbl:Wait Vbl
     Next X
Loop

I think it has somthing to do with the double buffering or physical and
logical screens, but I'm not sure.

Hi,  a long time ago I used to write stuff under STOS basic
     (anybody remember that!) on a now defunct machine, when I got
     my 'ol 500 several hundred years ago I missed it. Well now I'm
     back on the Amiga scene with a 1200 and AMOS Pro from last months
     Amiga Format and Easy Amos from another mag and would like to
     know which is the best book to get to get me going.

     I don't need a book on how to program, heck, after all I help write a
     language for my job. What I'm really after is a good refence book with
     nice examples!

    So what do you recommend to be the best?

	Ive sent a message, few days ago, speaking of AmosUpgrades. It was a sign to wake all us up! Ive received many answers n comments on it n Ive worked something out:

	There's a general will to keep Amos living, but everyone notices the problems we've found to do that. What we can do is create a new language.

	A NEW LANGUAGE IS BORNING!

	Obviously we start from we stopped. Just shall make it "compatible" with Amos. I mean: we can improve the original idea of Amos, n I think that version 1.0 could even be really compatible with AmosPro. Anyway future versions must include new features...

	KEEP IN CONTACT... COMMENTS ARE WELCOME!

Perhaps that is AMOSPro only. A better style than yours is instead of
making button global, put "End Proc[button]" on the end of the procedure,
and delete all the pop procs. Since the code is all in a big IF ELSE ENDIF
statement, the logic will not change when you do this. End Proc[] definitely
works in all versions of AMOS. You can then call the procedure with:

TESTBUTTONPRESS[STICK] : BUTTON=Param

Yes. AMOS simply evaluates the BEGIN_TIME<>0 to either -1 (True) or 0 (False)
before considering the if, then the IF command looks at its now numeric
argument, and checks if it is non zero. Therefore to check for a variable
begin non-zero, you use IF <VARIABLE> and to check for a variable being zero,
you can use IF Not <VARIABLE>. I admit that it is better style to use <> 0
for numbers, but my style should be used for boolean variables.

Using Jleft/Jright etc. is not significantly faster or slower than joy(). As
to the number of procedures, use whatever works best for you. Be aware that
having many very small procedures will be slightly slower.

	I don't think that program will work because there's no recursion
stopper to prevent it from uncovering squares that are already uncovered.  It's
a minor change though.  Just check to see if the new square is still covered
before calling the recursion.

Gday Ben (and all you others)
	
	First of all I would like to issue a disclaimer :) It is 
semester one exma week at my university and I last went to bed 4 days 
ago, so forgive any minor errors in my code.
	
	OK. To drop pieces in Tetris, an array thje size of the playing 
area is created eg 11*25 (X*Y). This 2-dimensional array is filled with 
zeros to represnt no pieces. When a piece enters thje playing area, the 
area it occupies is filled with (for example) 1.

	A lovely ascii diagram will help here.

1. No pieces
2. L-shape just entering
3. L-shape a few moves on
4. L-shape after hitting the bottom
5. Square almost at the bottom
6. Square colliding with L-shape

grid is 8*9 in this example 

1. 00000000  2. 00200000  3. 00000000  4. 00000000  5. 00000000  6. 00000000
   00000000	00222000     00200000	  00000000     00000000     00000000
   00000000	00000000     00200000	  00000000     00000000     00000000
   00000000	00000000     00222000	  00000000     00000000     00000000
   00000000	00000000     00000000	  00000000     00000000     00000000
   00000000	00000000     00000000	  00000000     00001100     00000000
   00000000	00000000     00000000	  00200000     00201100     00201100
   00000000	00000000     00000000 	  00200000     00200000     00201100
   00000000	00000000     00000000	  00222000     00222000     00222000

The number 2 represents the code for the l-shape
The number 1 represents the code for the square

By now you will probably have realised how it all works. But I shall 
explain for the hard of thinking :)

Before a piece drops, its new position in the array is calculated. If 
this collides with any other numbers then the piece is stuck. It has hit 
the bottom.

A way for calculating collisions (just appeared off the top of my head) 
is to calculate a checksum for each horizontal line before and after the 
move. If the 'After move' sum is different to the 'Before move' sum then 
subtract the id code of the current piece (unless the piece is a square 
then subtract 2*id code). If the answer is different to the 'Before sum' 
no, then the new piece has collided.

What the ????

Explanation: The horizontal line in the array has a nujmber indicating a 
part of each block. If you add all these and then move the piece and then 
recalculate, a new id number may have appeared on the horizontal line, eg if 
a long thin block appears. If there is a difference, then the id code is 
subtracted from the 'after' total (if the piece is not one block wide then 
n*id code are subtracted where n is width). This subtraction effectively 
removes the block. If the answer of the processed 'After' is different to 
the 'Before' checksum, it means that an id code apart from the moving 
block one was removed. In other words, putting the new piece in the array 
obscured a previous code, which would signify a collision.

1. one line before new piece arrives

	01110020  checksum = 5

2. one line with new piece. this piece has been moving down unobstructed. 
this is its first encounter with other pieces. represented by letter code 3

	01110030  checksum = 6

checksum after - checksum before = 1. Aha. Different. This means a piece 
has arrived. Subtract the id code of the new piece

1 - 3 = -2

Aha. Not equal to 0. This indicates that a id code was removed when this 
piece arrived. Look at the diagrams and you will see that an id code of 
'2' was removed (7th column)

If anyone needs further explanation, then feel free to email me, 
privately or thru the list.

See ya

Ben, a couple of years ago "TTWNN" (a very small codeing group)
     did a two player one, you can have the sources if you want to see how
     we did it.

Copied to AMOS-LIST just incase anyone else would like to see it,
I also have a demo of how to create an appearance of infinite bobs,
A mah-jong type game and a scrolly demo.

Garth Edwards, thanks for your hypermedia program. It was great. Any chance
of sending me the pictures from Neuromancer that you drew? By the way, I
couldn't find in plot flaws in any of the novels. Also, make that 4 novels
not 3, as Molly appears in Johnny Mnemonic which is in his first book
,"BURNING CHROME".

Ben Marty, could you please resend Tank to me. It seems to have gotten
corrupted during transfer. Is it only in .zip format or do you also have it

There are already procedures in Amos for handling a three button mouse. 
When you use the mouse button (I've forgotten the name) command it returns

1 for left mouse button
2 for right mouse button
3 for middle mouse button (or both left & right)

I'm pretty sure this is correct.

A quick and easy way is to turn on elements in a 2d arraywhere the blocks
are. If the array cheking is too slow, you could allocate a bank, and peek
and poke into it according to offsets depending on the size of your drop
area. I've never actually written a tetris game, this is just my first reaction to
your problem without giving it a lot of thought :-) C-ya

Right now the biggest problem I have is the user interface. The actual 
code for the game is, of course, a problem, but trying to make an 
interface that is easy to use, but small code-wize is a problem. For the 
people who had interest in my program, please tell me what you would like 
menu-wize.  

Origiinally, everything was in the right-button menubar. The problem with 
this was obvious.. the screen was being wasted.  Now, I've got a little 
menu that can be selected by mouse or by using the cursor keys. 

If I really wanted to, I could just make the menu items "1) Edit 
Objects,  2) Edit Graphics" or something -- no color or mouse interface. 
That would be eternally easier for me to code, but cheesy to look at and 
use. 

Also, I'll probably change the name to something more... original.

LEt me know what you would like. As for the DuneII idea.. well, someone 
explain to me what that's like.

Later..

Andy church & I still have access to the AMOS Web pages - I've tried to
fix the gif on the title page, but it just won't seem to work. It works
when I use the same gif on the same page on my local machine, but not
accross the internet, and frankly I'm confused. 

If anyone has any pages they want linked to, or programs they want uploaded
E-Mail me. 

However, I have nothing to do with PLAYFIELD magazine, or the commerical
software ryan sold. As to where he is, he did mention to me in passing a
few months ago that cybergate were setting up in the UK, and he might be
comming over here to help, so perhaps he is of the net for while. (This
is pure conjecture on my part).

Reading that stuff about iff anims reminds that I wrote a pretty nifty little
program a while back to take an animation and grab bobs out of it. This
allowed me to make animations of ie: karate guys doing moves, and when
it was all smooth and nice, I'd just run my procedure and I'd have the new
objects. I also have some procedures to take a bob and rotate it into
another bob (not realtime, just for stuff like cars and asteroids type
spaceships) If anybody wants them, let me know and I'll try and get around
to it. I don't actually program in AMOS anymore, but I find the conversation
here stimulating, so I stayed :-)

I find that hard to believe that Assembler doesn't make your progs much 
faster.  All the programs that I translated from AMOS to BlitzBasic2 are 
at least five times as fast as compiled Amos codes. Assembler should be 
faster than BB2 as well so I think its just your coding.
BTW, is there a forum like this one for the amazing BlitzBasic?

If you have AMOSPro, check out the Superblockout game that comes with it.

If not, look at the game MegaBlock2.lha in game/think on Aminet. It
doesn't include the source code, but if you want it I'll send it to you.

The basic idea is to store the "well" area in a 2D array, and check
the position in the array below the blocks current position before
you move it. You also need to keep arrays containing each of the blocks,
4 for each block (one for each rotation).

I talked to my brother, and he is sending me his. He has both one of the
Beta's, and the release version (from the programmer himself). When I
get it, I will give more info on how to obtain it from the packaging. Maybe it
wasn't EA, but I really thought it was.

No they're not. The former is testing boolean variables, the latter 
numeric variables. Actually;
If _START_TIME
is the same as
If _START_TIME = True
is the same as
If _START_TIME = -1
(is the same as If Not _START_TIME = False {EVIL GRIN}).

You need to do a Set Buffer (or something similar).  I wrote an 
ATOMS 
clone once, and occasionally it would get about 3 or 4 thousand 
levels 
deep. :)

You could, but recursion makes it MUCH easier...  Just do this :

Procedure SHOWMINES[X,Y]

If GRID(X-1,Y)=0
  SHOWMINES[X-1,Y]
End If
If GRID(X,Y-1)=0
  SHOWMINES[X,Y-1]
End If
If GRID(X+1,Y)=0
  SHOWMINES[X+1,Y]
End If
If GRID(X,Y+1)=0
  SHOWMINES[X,Y+1]
End If
GRID(X,Y)=5

End Proc

I'm assuming an empty unchecked square contains 0, and that an 
empty 
checked square contains 5.

Ain't recursion great?  :)

EME doesn't support it, mainly because medplayer.library doesn't.  In the 
future I may attempt to put the MED routines inside the extension so I can add 
volume control.

Actually, the Easy AMOS and AMOS Pro manuals are quite good for getting
started. I don't think there are any really good AMOS books.

Converting STOS stuff is quite easy, as well. AMOS Pro does everything
that STOS does, and a lot more. (I actually bought an ST to do
some conversions to AMOS, but didn't need it and ended up selling it
within weeks).

  Yes.  If you don't include a relational operator, "<>0" is assumed.

Actually,

If _START_TIME <>0

Help!

I do have the STOS to AMOS converter if anyone is interested.  I have never
tried it so I have no idea how well it works, if it does.
I assume it converts banks and evrything.

Theres been some talk lately about making a bug list for amos (sorry
Paul!).
I'll offer my services (since I've just gotten another 500meg drive I need
somthing to fill it :-)  ) in collecting these and other interesting amos
facts and tips.
I won't call it a bug list, but a Hint and Tip list (does that make you
happy paul? :-)). 
I intend it to be similar to a FAQ, and will update it regularly as more
people add to it. I may even use Garth Edwards hyper media progam to
display them, if Garth agrees.
If you have any interesting tips, such as an amos program runs faster if
comments are removed, etc, send them to me. Also if you have any 'bugs',
send them to me, NOT TO THE AMOS LIST!
Make the Subject :Amos Tips
Send them in the following format in the body of the message:

Your Name:
Net address:
Description of Hint/Tip/Problem:
Solution or workaround: Others may come up with a solution and add it here.
System: ie A500 A2000 A3000 , WB1.3 Wb2.0 WB3.0 , Memory , extensions
loaded.

When I get a good collection, I'll send out a beta version of the list for
everyones comments and (hopefully) solutions!

Cheers
Darryl

	Basically many problems can be solved by having some subtask call
  itself as part of the sol'n.  This is recursion, ie. programs that call
  themselves are recursive programs.  Why use recursion ?  Some recursive
  solutions can be very short and simple compared to other iterative
  solutions.  As an example consider the problem of a 'Flooding' Algorithm.
  You know the 'paint' command in Amos (Note: Amos uses the OS to do its
  flooding).  You can code it many different ways, and most use some
  explicit use of some stack, but the simplest and most elegant (subjective)
  is just to use recursion.  The disadvantage is that this simple method
  is less effecient.  Here is an simple recursive algorithm for flooding
   ar area: (pseudo Amos :) )


	procedure Flood( x , y , color )

		if( Point(x,y) <> color ) 

			Ink color : Plot x,y

			Flood( x+1 , y   , color )
			Flood( x-1 , y   , color )
			Flood( x   , y+1 , color )
			Flood( x   , y-1 , color )

		end if

	end proc


   This works, by calling itslef on the 4 neighbouring pixels around
   the pixel (x,y).  You just have to call it the first time with the
   start pixel (x,y).

	This is very much like the 'Flood' algorirthm above ( coincedence 
  :) )...


	Procedure Show_Mines( mine_x , mine_y )

		if( Number_of_Mines( mine_x, mine_y ) = 0 )
			' surrounded by no mines
			
			' do whatever code you have to do to
			' actually show that this mine co-ordinate (x,y)
			' has actually been turned up/tested/etc...

			For y = -1 to 1
			    For x = -1 to 1
			      if( x<>0 and y<>0) 
			          Show_Mines( mine_x + x , mine_y + y ) 
			      endif
			    Next
			Next

		end if
	end procedure



	I hope this helps...

	Keep an internal representation of the board in an Array... 
  initialize it to 0 to mean all spots on the board are empty and make
  a 1 mean that the spot is filled...

	ie. a 5x5 tetris board...

	00000  --> Dim Board(4,4) 
	00000
	00000
	00000
	00000


	So know you must also conceptual move the tetris piece inside
   the Array... this will let you know where you can move... when you
   find that you can't move.. set the board spots to ones...

	There are many different ways you can handle moving the piece
   inside the Array...

Hey, cool. I like risk games. What is it specifically you need help with?
I have learned all sorts of tricks with arrays n' stuff over the 7 years 
that I've been programming.

Last week (or two weeks ago, i don't remember so well!) Michael 
Cox wrote about a way to load all extension in AMOS Pro Compiler.
I tried to change in procedure COPYRAMLIBS number 26 to 37.
Well, this way works fine but only two extensions were loaded (stars.lib
and easylife.lib). JD.lib and Prt.lib weren't loaded in RAM. So
i think this way works fine for only few extensions.
Must i change 37 to  48 to load all others extensions?

I'm writing a top-down racing game, which involves x number of cars
racing around a track, with inertia etc. Each car has two velocities, X
and Y, which can be positive or negative, to indicate direction (ie X=4,
Y=4 vehicle going South East). I want to get some sort of "bounce"
effect when two cars collide, making it as realistic as possible, rather
than just throwing both cars off a bit and slowing them down. To do this
i have to recognise which way the cars are facing (easy), what speed
they are going in that direction (easy), which car hit which car (dunno
how to do) and what the consequences are (Erk!). For example, if car 1
which is going South at speed 4, hits Car 2 going East at Speed 3, what
happens to both cars? Realistically, Car 1 should slow down a bit, and
car 2 should accelerate briefly southwards, perhaps slowing down is
speed in the other directions. I really want to do this to give th
eplayer the option of "Ramming" the other cars into obstacles etc. I've
got the inertia, background collisions, pick ups, power ups, artificial intelligence, and just
about everything else done, its just the car/car collisions that i cant
seem to get my head round. Has anyone got any ideas on how to tackle the
problem? I suppose their really should be some sort of Newtonian Equasion
that should solve it..help!  

The game itself is based around a certain UK TV program, and features 2
megs of samples, 1 meg of anims and 2 megs of digitised pics..at the
moment! Its HD and 2 meg only at the moment, but a cut down A500 version
will be availble..hopefully!

Any help appreciated!

Dear Chris,
Yes, your right, programs which deal with graphical operations should not 
be 5 times as fast.  The progs which I translated were mostly 
calculations and structure type (a lot of loops, ifs, jumps) and after 
QUANTITATIVE observations I noticed increase in speed factor 5. 
As far as the translator, I was planning to actually write a thing like 
that but dont have enough time on my hands. Maybe in the future...

To work out who hit who you need to have two "strike zones" for the cars 
- one at the front, and one that covers the rest of the car.  When a 
collision occurs, the car whose front zone was hit is the "ramming" car, 
and the other is the victim.  If both cars' front zones were hit, it was 
a head on collision.  Ok, now you know who hit whom, you need to modify 
the cars velocities a bit.  There is a Newtonian equation to do this, and 
it's pretty simple - each object has a coefficient of elasticity which 
dictates how much of their energy is lost and how much is transferred in 
a collision.  Put simply, you just subtract a bit of the ramming cars 
forward velocity and add it to the victim.  For example:

Car A has a horizontal velocity of 3m/s and a vertical velocity of 0m/s.
Car B has a horizontal velocity of 1m/s and a vertical velocity of -1m/s.

Car A strikes Car B and the resultant velocities are :

Car A has a horizontal velocity of 2m/s and a vertical velocity of 
   -0.125m/s.
Car B has a horizontal velocity of 1.75m/s and a vertical velocity of 
   -0.75m/s.

So, what happened?  Well, Car A transferred 25% of its velocities to Car 
B and lost 8.33% to friction, heat, etc.  Car B transferred 12.5% of its 
vertical velocity to Car B, but because Car A's horizontal component was 
greater than Car B's, there was no return transfer.  (Also note that I 
made these percentages up - increase or reduce them depending on how 
bouncy you want the cars to be...)

Confused?  Tough. :)  Go get an A-Level Maths with Mechanics text book - 
they give you the real-life equations...

(Actually, this reminds me I never finished my Newtonian extension that 
 had all this stuff in it...  Maybe I'll get round to it one day.)

(Oh, and what TV show is this based on?  I don't remember any shows about 
 crashing into cars last time I was there... :)  And how's Southampton 
 doing?  Are there any shops in The Marlands yet?  Is The Joiner's Arms 
 still there?  Has Diamond finally closed?  (I hope so...  Bunch of 
 bastards.)  Is Game still in the Bargate Centre?  I miss the old dump...  
 *sigh*  I guess I should've worked harder.  Can you believe I flunked 
 out of SIHE of all places?   Oops, got a bit carried away...)

Well, it is not realistic at all...
If you have patience i will go home and look on my books...

Sure there is an equation (or two) which can describe every collision you 
want...
If I remember right it was quite long... but not very complex.

I think you want elastic collision, that are collisions were total energy 
is conserved. They are more simple... note that  the previous description 
of loss of energy was completely false.
There is not energy loss during collision but the heat produced by the hit.

If you simply want the two machine bouncing back with relative velocity 
it is very simple (I think... I have to check the equations) and you can 
forget the energy loss (which is minimal with repect to the energy 
involved in the collision).

See you soon

Hi all.

Last month i got frpm Aminet Proclib30 for AMOS and AMOS Pro.
I found some very interesting input routines for real and integer
numbers and for strings. So i modified these procedures for
binary an hexadecimal numbers.
These are the modified procedures:


Procedure B_INPUT[L]
   '
   ' INPUT ROUTINE FOR BINARY NUMBERS 
   '
   ' L   : Length of field (Default character % exclused).  
   '
   '
   ' This routine accepts only the numbers 0 and 1  
   ' (Plus RETURN to end and BACKSPACE to delete the last character.) 
   ' Characters "%"(for binary numbers) is for default. 
   ' It is therefore more fool-proof than the normal INPUT command. 
   '
   '
   '
   ' Basic routine written in 1994 by Christian Mumenthaler 
   ' Revisioned for Binary Numbers by Luca Ferraris - 02/95 
   ' This routine is Public Domain. Use it wherever you want to.  
   '
   '
   NA$="%"
   Z=Len(NA$)
   L1=L-Z
   Print NA$+Space$(L1);
   Cmove -L1,0
   Curs On 
   A1=Asc("0") : A2=Asc("1")
   Repeat 
      A$=Inkey$
      A$=Upper$(A$)
      A=Asc(A$)
      If((A>=A1 and A<=A2)) and Z<=L
         Print A$;
         NA$=NA$+A$
         Inc Z
      End If 
      If A$=Chr$(8) and Z>0
         Z=Z-1
         Cmove -1,0 : Print " "; : Cmove -1,0
         NA$=Left$(NA$,Len(NA$)-1)
      End If 
   Until A$=Chr$(13)
   Curs Off 
   A#=Val(NA$)
End Proc[A#]


Procedure H_INPUT[L]
   '
   ' INPUT ROUTINE FOR HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS  
   '
   ' L   : Length of field (Default character "$" exclused).  
   '
   '
   ' This routine accepts only the numbers from 0 to 9 and characters 
   ' from A to F.

   Z=Len(NA$)
   L1=L-Z
   Print NA$+Space$(L1);
   Cmove -L1,0
   Curs On 
   A1=Asc("0") : A2=Asc("F")
   Repeat 
      A$=Inkey$
      A$=Upper$(A$)
      A=Asc(A$)
      If((A>=A1 and A<=A2)) and Z<=L
         Print A$;
         NA$=NA$+A$
         Inc Z
      End If 
      If A$=Chr$(8) and Z>0
         Z=Z-1
         Cmove -1,0 : Print " "; : Cmove -1,0

    Hi there.
        Passing integers to assembly procedures is easy.But passing 
floating point numbers (eg A# etc) is somewhat complicated.We have to 
use Fast Floating Point format(FFP). This means :
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMSEEEEEEE where M is the 24bit mantissa, S is 
the sign and E is the exponent.Can anyone tell me how a number (let's 
say 32) is represented in this format? Is it 32 1E0?
                    Thanks,
                               Gregory.

    I wonder why Amos Pro has Hslider and Vslider commands despite 
the lack of the appropriate commands to get the position of the 
slider! See in the help files! The slider manipulation is done 
manually. So, we have to use Interface with the subsequent 
disadvantages...

Subject: 4 button code.
Status: RO
X-Status: 

For all who asked.  Here's the 4 button code.

The program is very simple and should be self explanatory.
I added some extra comments to help with the harder points.

The modification to the sega joypad are very simple, just cross
the 5 and 7 pins.  If you want to open the joypad and perform a 
solder job fine.  But the best thing to do is to run down to Radio Shack
and get the parts to build an adapter, you will need:
 1 Male 9 Pin kit
 1 Female 9 Pin kit
 2 plastic shielding covers
 wire

Cut the shielding covers in half and glue the two covers together 
and glue the two bottoms together.  Assemble the plugs remembering
to cross 5 on one end with 7 on the other.  The pin out should look
like this:

  1---------1
6-------------6
  2---------2
7---\     /---7
  3--\---/--3
8-----\-/-----8
  4----x----4
9-----/-\-----9
  5--/   \--5

Solder no two wires together. Place the shielding covers on and tape
shut.  You can glue the covers shut once your sure it works ok.

The code is based on a article in Amiga Format that came out last
summer, I don't remember the exact issue but the assembly version
of this code was on the cover disk.

The code could be shortened in many different ways, but for 
simplicity heres the long version.

Actually i use more Bob with routines to update them every TOT vbls,

I'm programming with a friend of mine an arcade game called
Dark Ages. Five levels including different places and dif-
ferent enemies to fight. But during programming i had some
problems. Amos Pro doesn't allow user to use differents
sprite or bob banks at the same time. There are no commands
like SPRITE BANK n or USE SPRITE BANK n and so i would like
to know if i'm wrong and if there are others ways to
use more bob banks in a game.

Bye.

Hello everyone on the Amos mailing list!!! 
I'm back again, if you dont remember me then dont worry, I just thought I'd
say hello!
 
I've been making a mull-modem link in the last few months which I may
release sometime (although I wont personally be uploading it to the AmiNet
'cos I dont have access but I can do it via the BBS I'm on ;).
 
I'm going to try and do a hydra-like transfer protocol for it, unfortunatly
I'm not sure on how to do error checking... if its as simple as sending and
checksum at the end of each data packet then it should be that *hard* to
implement but any suggestions would be appreciated.
 
BTW, I have my own thought's on how a checksum works with standard
protocols, but does anyone know the actual "dictionary" definition?
 
Thanks,       

  Jam.

Who cares if it's 100% realistic or not as long as it looks
and feels ok? We are talking about a game, and not a complex
car crash simulator.
Personally, I think the idea of just transferring some of the other cars
velocity (vector) to the other car might give good results as
a rough approximation. This simple approach has also the advantage
that you can add only a certain percentage of what you've taken
away from the other car to simulate some of the kinetic energy
losses.

Realistic inelastic collision handling would be bejond good and evil.
Even the formula for the elastic collision are long.

I think 100% elastic collision will look bad in a car racing game. The
"bouncing" effect would be much too strong.
The formula can be optained with equations for kinetic energy and
impulse (sp?) conservation. Transformation in the center of mass
makes it easier to solve these equations. The result can be found in
any physics book, I guess.
BTW, the description about the energy loss given by the original
poster wasn't that wrong. You will notice that in real car crashs
MOST of the kinetic energy is lost through the irreversible deformation
of the cars!

It depends. Usually, I use AMAL for objects that have simple paths 
(coins, enemies, etc) and I use the Bob commands for updating players.

Nope - sprites, bobs and icons always come from bank 1.  You could 
display a bob then swap banks and display another, but it won't work with 
sprites.  (I don't actually know if it'll work at all, but you could try. :)

It needs it's scroll direction changed, so that it rises from the bottom,
not the top. Change the 1 to -1 .
It currently prints only 1 character, so you need to make it print a text
$. The code is mostly there for it already.
You will also have to put the text at x,250, not at x,16.
Play around with the scroll zones, until you get a nice smooth transition
from botttom to top.
I could have finished it off, but hey, I wanted to get back to my own
programming :-)
I'm sure that others out there on the list will add to this and improve it.
If you do, please send me a copy.

Well, it asked for realistic routines if i am not wrong... 
And doing a percentage appoximation will cause troubles as there are many 
ways the two car can collise that some collision case would be too 
innatural to be true.

Yes... but do you know how much energy is involved in a car collision?
What percentage of the energy do you think will be dissipated by heat and 
plastic deformations?

You understanded the real problem!If your method works fine, well, i'll try it
soon,but my other problem is this:
in my game, player can choose from 3 or for different warriors. I think that
every warrior will be composed by 20-30 frames. Total is of 80-120 frames only
for your warriors. I think Amos Sprite bank contains only 256 sprites, so
i have to copy all main warriors in every sprite bank (one for level) and
put others sprites in the others cells of the sprite bank (>120..).In this way
i will get five sprite banks,every one with more then 200 sprite's images!!!!!

It's too hard.....

However, thanks a lot....

Sorry for my english... but I'll try to make things clear.

After an intensive discussion with other two physicist i found the answer 
to the elastic collision question.
I assume that the masses of the cars are all equal for semplicity.

Avoiding friction forces and however every kind of dissipative forces, 
what really is important is the momentum conservation and the kinetics 
energy.
Now the result is that after an elastic collision between two boby of the 
same mass, their velocity is simply exchanged. You can see this with a 
billiard ball which strikes a static ball. After the collision the first 
"incoming" ball come to rest while the second escape with the velocity of 
the first ball. On a head on collision where both the ball move the 
second ball return with the velocity of the first and the first with the 
velocity of the second.
So it mat all seem simple... but... what happen if it is not a head on 
collision? This is the problem (to be or not to be... ehmm...). 

The problem is more evident if your car are rectangular. In this case 
(excluding rotation movement, in which case you would need a second of 
your computer power to calculate the resulting movements!) the machines 
can collide also on sides.

You should have four lines on each car which detect where the collision  
happens. This way you can easily calculate the relative velocity (that 
on axe X or on axe Y depending on the point of collision) which the car 
takes from the other car.

So if you have a car which is moving north (1) and one which is moving west 
(2) and they collide you have to decide which is the "incoming" and which is 
the "target". This is easy... the "incoming" car is that which hits with 
the front of the car, while the "target" is that which is hit on the 
side or the back. 

Assume the car (2) is the "incoming" car and collide with (1).
(1) is hit on the right side, while (2) hit with the front.
Now car (2) stops moving completely (as there is not X velocity coming 
from car (1) ) while car (1) acquires the x velocity of car (2).

You can apply friction after the collision which simply slow down car (1) 
skidding.

The base formula of the collision is:

		V1i+V2i = V1f+V2f

This means that the sum of the velocity before the collision and the 
sum of the resulting velocities after the collision are the same.

All the example I have made follow this rule.

Now friction.
It is very simple as a formula, but i think it is quite complicated to 
insert in your game.
If the cars are not subjected to an acceleration in a determined 
direction they must slow down on that direction. So after a head-side 
collision car (2) must slow down it's velocity on axe X.

Friction formula is:
			F=-kM 
where M is the mass of the car and K a coefficient which determines the 
strenght of the force. 
You should have two friction forces. One for the back-front direction of 
the car  and one for the left-right side direction of the car. 
The former should be smaller than the latter as the wheels help the car 
while the side movement are much more "dumped".
The side force can be 20 times stronger than the back-head force.

You can easily use the collision formulae for a car against a wall 
(letting the wall be completely rigid). The car simply is "reflected" by 
the wall. This follows the energy conservation rule.

If you want to include car deformation you have to add a coefficient to 
the equations exchanging the velocity of the colliding objects.
The coefficient should be a number < 1.

This seems quite complicated, but I think it is not. Maybe the most 
difficult things is to trace the 4 lines on the cars which control 
collisions.

Hope this vill help.

M&F

P.S. Sorry for my english, but if you could not understand something tell 
me. I will try to make it clearer.

I use Bob update. Amal is quite difficult to use and it is not very 
friendly. And though rough programming you can obtain much more complex 
movement. Moreover there is not a great improvement in speed execution if 
you make things running uder AMAL or from AMOS BASIC.
The only advantege for me is that there is execution independance.

Why you need it? You can put all your images in the BANK 1 and access 
them as you want...

But if what you need are bank which have nothing in common with other 
you can simply swap them as BANK 1.

    Hi guys, Here's a question for you:)
    Is there a way to find the address of a variable without using 
VarPtr? Maybe using A5 register?

    Let's say we have a bob like this:
                    __
        --------- /    \  
hand<- |  ++    |  **  |  ----> body
        ---------\  -- /
  
 (gly eh?).We have placed the hot spot where the ateriscs are(to 
the body).But we want to check if the point ++ (hand) has been 
collided with another bob.Does Col command return us the correct 
value?
                    Thanks, Gregory.

How about just varying the amount of energy lost until you arrive at a

Usually when people have problems with the spritebank, it is because they want to 
read or write the images from it directly. Why they would want to do that is beyond 
me. However (this is not relevant, I hear you cry!), their real problem is that the 
spritebank does not store the sprite/bob-images, but pointers to those images. 
Now, that would seem to be your solution, as you would only have to change some 
pointers. I might well be talking complete gibberish here though, so if the real Amos 
buffs (Andy, Dominic, any Mike or Paul) could get cracking... Please!

  The exponent is biased by 65; in other words, you subtract 65 from the
exponent field to get the actual exponent.  So 32 (1 * 2^5) would be:

10000000 00000000 00000000 01000110

The mantissa is 1.000000... (there's an assumed binary point after the
first digit), the sign bit is zero (positive), and the exponent is 5
(70-65).

Andy churches intuition extension will allow you open Intuition screens in
any mode that your monitor supports, however you won't be able to use some
AMOS features (e.g. Bobs) on them. For HAM8 title screens, it should do the
job.

Yes it is, but I wrote a quicksort procedure which is in the procedure
library on aminet that will sort anything you like with some small
modificiation (Indicated in comments in the code).

Not as far as I know. Remember the address of strings is likely to
change with garbage collection, but integers / reals are allocated
a static memory address. However garbage collection will only
occur when you assign to a string varaible, or use an AMOS function which
returns/modifies a string variable.

This is a hypothesis, but worth a try. The sprite bank contains a pointer to
the sprite image, and to it's mask. When you use a command to display a
sprite, AMOS will either:

	- Copy the pointers from the sprite bank into the Amiga OS sprite
	  image structure, or an interal structure to represent the image
	  of each hardware sprite.

	- Put the address / number of the entry of sprite bank in the
	  internal structure.

If the first method is used, you can setup the first sprite, then swap the
bank and setup the second without the display to the first being corrupted.
I suggest you try it and see. However AMAL animations may complicate things,
but if when compiling the AMAL program AMOS jsut creates a list of pointers
to the actually images instead of the list of sprite bank numbers you type
in, it will still be OK.


I've never heard of this 256 sprite limit before, and looking at the 
internal structure of the bank, I can see no reason why 65535 sprites
is not possible. This is a limit to the vertical size of each sprite,
the number of sprites on the screen, and the number of bobs on the
screen (The first and last of these can be edited from the AMOSPro 
configuration editor). It may be that the bob editor limits you to
256 sprites.

I don't know.  I hav'nt had access to a cd32 yet.  Just give it a

I have no idea if it will work or not.  When I can test it I'll

Hello..

Thanks to everyone who replied to my message about Aminet - I will try it out 
ASAP!

Next... (sorry about this)...

I have just got a hard drive (hoorah!), and have installed Amos Pro 
(obviously).  BUT, when I try to install the compiler (using the installer!) I 
have to select the nationality of my keyboard and then it says "Updating system 
configuration" or something similar and then hangs.  The bad news is that it is 
doing it to my ORIGINAL compiler disk - and I can't get it to work.

Has anyone else had this or knows what on earth is going on?

ALSO!

Does anyone know how to use EQUATES?  Every time I try to use them it says it 
can't find the equates file?  Where is it supposed to be and how to I use it?  
I'd like to write some Amos Editor things, but it won't let me.  Grumble, 
grumble.

Oh, and finally, to anyone wanting the Amos Unlocker program - I haven't 
forgotten you, I'm just looking for the damn thing!  If anyone else has it 
actually to hand, then perhaps they'd like to step in?  Otherwise, I'll keep my 
eye out.  I found a disk with "Unlock.Amos" on the label, but it didn't have it 
at all!  I'm sure I must have copied it somewhere else...  Sorry!  Will find it 
one day!

Thanks...

Pro's & Cons.

Pro's
    Yes there is a procedure for nulocking a locked procedure.
I Think it is some were on the MR.AMOS 7 disk set.  I'll look and 
see if I can find it again.

Cons
    Why do you want to unlock a locked procedure.  A programmer
may spend weeks cooking his brain to come up with some really 
cool piece of code, and may not be ready to give away the source.

   Some procedures are locked for a reason, some by mistake :)

I think this method can work fine and i think swapping banks is a good

Hi all.
I think my problem about sprite banks is a far story.
Now i would like to know more about Turbo extension for Amos Pro.
Where i can find it? How much does it cost? What features it includes?

I know that it has some very interesting scroll related routines.

  Technically, yes.  For all practical purposes, no.  You lose about
25-50 microseconds, maybe more or less depending on the speed of your
processor.

AMOS Pro stores the bank numbers as a linked list, so swapping the banks 
requires writing 4 bytes which doesn't take all that long. :)  Regular 
AMOS has to write 8 bytes, but again, that's not TOO slow. :)

   The Bank Swap command is performed changing only the pointers to the two bank structures involved, so isn't a huge amount of time. Then consider that if u need to do it, any other way to cope with it couldn't use less time, apart from using just one bank... but hell! we're speaking of 10ths of second!

Well, it is on Aminet under dev/amos
It is called turbo19.lha and include docs.
It is the last freeware version of the extension, don't know if there is 
a commercial version though.
It is very powerful... but if you want to have easy life when programming 
take EasyLife extension. It is very good and the last version includes 
XPK and PP packer support and also MUI and lots of other useful things.

Hi all.

I tried to find turbo19.lha on Aminet but it doesn't exist. There is only
a turbo1.lha, but it's a demo showing some scrolling features of the Turbo
Plus extension.
I found also Turbo15.lha but not in AMinet (i think in directory Amiga
on nic.funet.fi).
If someone can send me the last freeware version....well,it's well accepted!

And the last version of Easylife? I have version 14b, but on manual there
are no words about MUI.

That version of Turbo does not work with Pro. The Turbo+ registered
extension has lot's of cool things like a great map editor, fast drawing
commands, zone checking, tileing, some 3d stuff, plane commands etc. I
really liked it.

To those who want the iff anim -> bob routines, sorry about the delay, I
have been vacationing on the moon. (well actually, Civilization AGA has
converted me into a mindless zombie! ) I will post them ASAIPC. :-)

I found that (I think) although it said Turbo DEMO - and when I loaded it I 
just got a really crap demo (well, it was interesting because it showed the 
potential of turbo but it wasn't exactly what I was after).  Is the full Turbo 
library on aminet - did I just miss it?  I really couldn't find it.  I presumed 
the demo was just a "reduced" version and it would tell me how to get the rest 
in the program!

Luca,

There's NO limit on the number of sprites in a bank (at least not in
Creator), so if you can spare the memory you can hold ALL your sprites
in one bank.  Or, you could load in the Player sprites you need first,
then Append the Level sprite bank to the end of the bank in ram.  You just
put a ,1 after the Load command to make the sprite bank be added to the
bank already loaded.

1) turbo extension v 1.9 WORKS with AMOS pro and also with Amos the 
creator as the archive includes both versions! Moreover I HAVE AMos Pro 
and i use Turbo Extension v1.9 so...

2) Version 1.9 includes 3D stuff and fast drawing tools as well. I don't 
know about the commercial version. Someone wants to write CLEAR the 
differences between the two versions? 

3) Turbo extension 1.9 IS ON AMINET!

If you are interested please send a mail to me which says...

	Please send TURBO Extension 1.9 to me.

And I will email the extension as soon I have uuencoded it (which means 
tomorrow as I can't uuencode on this infernat RISC + UNIX machine!).

Hope this will help

The latest version of easylife is V1.09, but this has not been uploaded
to aminet, as it is a beta version. I do have version 1.10 almost ready for
release, but as it contains an amigaguide conversion of the AMOSPro on-line
help, I am going to write to europress for permission to include it first.

The version numbering for easylife is a little confusing as I changed to
commodore style numbering half way through. In ascending order, versions are
1.0,1.1,1.2,1.3,1.31,1.32,1.4,1.41,1.42,1.43,1.5,1.06,1.07,1.08,1.09,1.10.


V1.09 can be downloaded as follows:

ftp to:    gate.net
login:     ftp
password:  <your e-mail address>
directory: /pub/amos/software/extensions

To install easylife & any other extension, you can't just pick random
extension numbers - each extension must go in a specific slot. Easylife
must be number 16, and I think AMOS Turbo is 8 or 12 depending on which
version you have. This is clearly stated in the documentation of both
packages.

Version 1.10 has these additional features over V1.09:

	- Bugs fixed in various commands.

	- Constants & Enumerations better supported in structured variables

	- Replacement for the AMOSPro help system using amigaguide files for
	  help on AMOSPro, easylife commands & other extensions.

	- More structured variable tutorials including queues, priority queues
	  delay queues, and binary trees.

As I stated in my last message, I have written an amigaguide help system
for AMOSPro. This means that it will be possible to access help pages for
your extension commands by pressing the help key over the command in the
AMOSPro editor, just like the current system for builting AMOSPro commands.

However, for this to work, it is important that the following convention is
used to name the nodes of your help file:


	- Each node that describes a command should have the name 
	  C_<commandname> including any $ or # that is part of the
	  name, but with spaces removed. (Style unashamedly cribbed
	  from andy churches intution extension guide).


	- If a node describes more than one command, add an additional
	  line beneath the @node line for each other command described
	  of the form:

		@AKA C_<othercommandname>

	  All other amigaguide viewers will ignore these lines.


	- As an extra feature, you may generate a hypertext link that when
	  pressed loads a program into a new window in the AMOSPro editor,
	  and exits help, like the original AMOSPro help did. The format
	  is:

		@{"<textlabel>" amos <filename>}

	  where textlabel is the text to appear on screen as the link, and
	  filename is name of the file to load, which should be a complete
	  path, and not relative to the current directory.

	  Such a link will be drawn by other amigaguide viewers, but will
	  have no effect when pressed.


Please adjust you documentation to follow this style, as it will allow the
user to integrate it into the new AMOSPro help system simply by copying it to
the appropriate directory.

I have searched the Turbo19.lha on aminet but it doesn't exist anymore.
It is possible that it has been removed from all the Aminet sites?

It was there... I have dowloaded it more than once... but suddenly it has 
been removed. 
However I have the AmosPro extension and the docs.
I know I can't obtain the original archive anymore, but can I still 
distribute the extension if I pack the binary and the docs?

I someone is interested can E-Mail me.

If someone still has the original archive in a corner of its HD or at the 
bottom of a drawer... can please send it to me?

BTW: Does anyone know why the extension has been removed?

I'm new to the list so first off a quick hello to everyone!

A while back I saw the demo disk for Amos 3d and I thought it was pretty 
neat.  I saw amos 3d in my local amiga store the other day and I wanted 
to buy it, but one question.

It says on the Amos 3d box that it requires Amos the creator.  I have 
Amos Pro with the compiler extentions.  Will I be able to use it?

Could you perhaps just load them in separately?  Maybe put them in RAM first?

I've made notes of all those have offered to help in someway. I've been 
kinda quiet about it because I dont think anyone has made such a project 
before. I hadnt worked on it up until recently for 4-5mths, but got back 
to work on it. I'm still in the beginning stage of the setup of the game.
I've found a array method to create random maps, with over 200 
territories, with 6 types, up to 10 players allowed to be played, human 
or computer, while there is a single kingsmen. Wants I get the setup 
stage finished which should be soon, then I'll move to the needing help 
stage. I designed this on paper before I ever began, and when you do a 
big project its best you new programmers learn to do it on paper first a 
outline. Not really much to it really. Title screen, fancy fonts, with a 
cool mod music intro, a credits screen or scrolls with fancy fonts. Then 
your game configuration phase. Which I skip the intro part bec its the 
easiest to do. I've got game war sound effects already. Paul Hickman 
suggested I try out his Easylife for my variables, which soon I'll see if 
it will work or needed. I finished the loops of setups it takes for the 
players. Wants the game play starts it will be the fun part of keeping up 
with all that data & being able to read it in & change it as fast as 
possible, bec I have 200 zones & 200 buttons wrote in already. I got the 
idea from a game written on the 64 called War of the Crown II, written by 
German Design Group, which I've never heard of. Its max territorys was 66 
& only 3 computer players & Kingmen. Amos Pro and having a Amiga is 
making it possible. M. Berret sorry if I miss spelled his name, gave me 
the 8 way scroll routine for using Turbo Extension from aminet, for a 
future versions of it. Turbo Plus would have been the better method to truely
do this all in, but I cannot afford it as this time, but I'll get it for
future projects. Most of this is nonimportant info but I figured 
something may be of interest to others. 

Now the bad news, currently the game is in a HiRes Laced version, do to me 
not being able to program zones outside the view on Low-Res.

Mike,

Fine, technically there's a limit of 65,000 sprites, but why don't you try
fitting 65k 256 byte sprites (small sprites) into even 2 Megs of Chip ram on
an AGA Amiga.  ;)  There's no PRACTICAL limit to the number of sprites in
a bank.

  You got the wrong file.  turbo19.lha may well have been deleted from
AmiNet, but you can still get it off the AMOS web site (see my signature).

  Also, regarding your problem with extensions - you *can't* just install
an extension in a random slot; you have to install the extension in the
slot it was programmed to use, which should be stated in the documentation.
(EasyLife uses slot 16, I think.)

It is not just you, as someone else had the same problems. However I tried
it again this afternoon, and it worked OK. Maybe there were too many users
at the time you tried.

Ok.

I will send the Turvo extension as soon I have uuencoded it.

So have patience. Two days and you'll have the extension.

Yes, but you will have to be careful.  There are some files for it (just like
for the compiler) that have to be moved, you know, the AmosPro_3D.lib to
replace the regular 3D.lib.

Also, whenever you compile a 3D prg, you must include the file c3D.Lib with the
compiled program or it will not work.  I have done quite a bit of 3D work (I
use APro2.0 and Compiler Pro) and it works fine for me.

Hi all.
Finally, yesterday i got EasyLife extension 108. It's really great (i had also Easylife14b 
but this is greater..). The only problem is that Amos and Amos Pro don't have a command
to get arguments of a CLI running program and so i think that Easylife is a good extension
which this command can be included. Hey Paul! Have you got any idea about this?

OK... sorry I've taken longer than usual to reply to this.

Right, I've done this before, and basically, what I had to do is create
a screen which is 2x2 times the size of the bit you actually see... then
you'll have to maintain 4 copies of the bit you're looking at. This
allows you to gradually scroll further and further to the right, then
suddenly jump back one screen width without noticable effects. I'll give
a 2-way scrolling example, because it's more brief, but you can easily
extend this to 4-way (which is almosy identical to 8-way - I suspect you
mean 8-way, actually - most people do.)

Right. You have a large screen, and for some odd reason, you want to
scroll smoothly all the way through large letters of the alphabet
without creating a screen wide enough for all 26. These are BIG letters,
and only 4 can fit on the screen at once. You DO NOT want to do it this
way:

+-------+>>>
|A B C D|E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
|A B C D|E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
+-------+>>>

You don't want to do it like that, because it would need a huge screen.
If you, however, create a screen which is JUST OVER twice the width, you
can do something like this:

+-------+>>>
|A B C D|E A B C D E
|A B C D|E A B C D E
+-------+>>>

You gradually scroll the screen until the "E" has finished appearing,
then you prepare the next column of the screen:

  +-------+>>>
 F|B C D E|F B C D E
 F|B C D E|F B C D E
  +-------+>>>

Note that I'm keeping 2 identical copies of an identical screen. Now,
keep going, scrolling and preaparing TWO COPIES of the next column,
until you reach this point:

          +-------+>>>                  +-------+
 F G H I J|F G H I|J            Player  |F G H I|
 F G H I J|F G H I|J            sees:   |F G H I|
          +-------+>>>                  +-------+

Now, if you suddenly jump back a screen-width, the stuff you see on the
screen is IDENTICAL, so you never notice the change:

+-------+>>>                            +-------+
|F G H I|J F G H I J            Player  |F G H I|
|F G H I|J F G H I J            sees:   |F G H I|
+-------+>>>                            +-------+

Now you're basically back where you started. You can continue to scroll
to the right, updating BOTH COPIES of the screen.

Now, I won't repeat all of that for 8-directional scrolling, but
basically you'll need FOUR copies of the stuff you're seeing, like this:

+-------+
|A B C D|E A B C D E
|F G H I|J F G H I J
+-------+O K L M N O
 A B C D E A B C D E
 F G H I J F G H I J
 K L M N O K L M N O

Now... Something that you may have noticed... In Amos, and a lot of
other environments... If you scroll OFF THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE of the
screen, you start seeing the left-hand side again, only shifted up by a
pixel. When you think about the way screen memory works, this is
blindingly obvious. In *SOME* circumstances, this single-pixel "jump" is
unimportant to the game, and you're never going to need to draw anything
half-way across the gap. *IF* you don't mind these restrictions, you
don't even need to make your screen twicxe the width - you can just
scroll into the "next copy" of the same screen, and occasionally jump up
a pixel to compensate. In most cases, you'll have to put up with a 2x2
size screen though.

Note! This trick only works HORIZONTALLY! You can scroll off the right
and "sort of" back on the left, but you absolutely CANNOT do the same
off the top or bottom... You *WILL* need twice the height.

If you have problems with the above, let me know, but I'm quite busy,
and off on a skiing holiday soonish, so don't be surprised if I take
ages replying.

Definite sense of Deja Vu here... Don'tcha reckon, M+F?   ;-)

Yes, I remember...
This is good for a bitmap scrolling.
I have some little and efficiet routines for tiled-map scrolling. They
works very fast with turbo extension but can be used also without the
extension.
If someone is interested just e-mail me.

	I agree with you.... practically it's not likely you could currently

I've really got a very BIG problem. I've posted this message to

will have some time to take a look at this too.

If anybody knows what's going on in my computer please help. I've had
an Amiga for five years but this something I really can't understand.

Two days ago my Workbench locked up when I activated an icon. The 
mouse won't move anymore, the computer doesn't respond to the 
keyboard, etc.
It looks as if the system guru's, but when you reset there is no guru
message.

Describing the problem exactly:
I double-click on icons, i.e. a disk icon or a drawer icon and after 
a few icon-clicking-actions 0<x<20 (if I'm lucky) nothing happens 
anymore.
I can still move the mouse but when I click on a drawer for example 
the drawer won't open(the drawer icon stays in the 'pressed' 
position). 
At this position the system semi-hangs. When I move the mouse to 
something else (a depth-gadget a window-bar or something else 
intuition like the screen really freezes(the workbench screen) and 
nothing responds to any input at all.

Here is the frightening part:
* Everything works well when I activate programms using tools-daemon, 
  toolmanager or 'execute command' in the workbench menu. The shell 
  works fine too.
* All my programs run, Amos, Amiga-E, Ed, shell, dir, list, you name 
  it. Even from the Workbench if the icon problem doesn't show up to 
  fast.
* The games I've got work as well, all of them.
* When I empty my WB-startup-drawer and start wb completely 'naked' it 
  still hangs after some time.
* When I run a music tracker on a different screen the music will 
  play on.
  The screen output on this screen also continues, but I can't click  
  in this screen(system hangs)  

Conclusion: The Workbench Software doesn't work, screen output on the 
Workbench screen is locked and all input from keyboard is locked 
either.
When I insert a floppy-disk the computer will scan it. If the same 
disk(icon) was already present on the workbench screen the drive-led 
will go off after scanning, if it wasn't the drive led stays on.

* My configuration is:
  A500 rev 5. Kickstart 2.04. Workbench 2.1 1 meg CHIP, 2 meg FAST
  GVP A500HD8 52 meg harddisk with a GVP AT286 hardware emulator,
  processor 68010, 512kb chip intern, 512kb chipmemexpansion trapdoor.

  I have stripped all the add-ons, Harddisk, AT286, 68010, fast-ram
  512 kb chipram-extension, etc., doesn't help. I have started WB 
2.04 from floppy disk, no harddisk and still it doesn't work.
  I've put the Kickstart 1.3 ROM back and started WB 1.3. Guess 
  what:it also happens! (No add-ons at all)

Conclusion: something is wrong with the hardware.

As you can see, the experiments contradict each other. It can't be 
the hardware, it can't be the software. Is it me? (It isn't me, when 
someone else operates the computer it also happens :<<<  )


My only conlusion from these conclusions can be:

A virus
B corrupt memory

(B can't be true because I've run a mem-checker three times.)

Has anybody had the same problem?, knows what it could be, has a 
suggestion where to look at?

If you know something or have an further question please mail or post,
I'm really getting sick of this.
Remember: All the software works, except Workbench Icons, On 2.1 2.04 
and 1.3.

Hi all,

Has somebody some experience with calling libraries, like ASL?? The
problem is that the computer crashed when we try to call a function
in a library. We are using Lib Open etc..

Please give me some information....

I think what you are looking for is the AMOS/AMOSPro command "Command Line$"
which contains the CLI command line arguments of a compiled AMOS program,
and can be set to the arguments you want to give another AMOS program that
you Prun.

!! UPDATE !!
~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have almost completed the next update to my ppAccessories program which 
is on Aminet (dev/amos). This version has undergone a total re-write. 
This version does not support XPK, but I do intend to add it some time in 
the near future. However I have made major changes to this program as 
listed here:

- No longer two seperate accessory programs. NOW has it's own graphic 
  interface which makes it alot more user friendly. Just point and click !
- No longer requires the CRUNCH and DECRUNCH commands, but does require the
  powerpacker.library (v35) in your LIBS: folder.
- Documentation is now gonna be in AmigaGuide format.

I should have this program ready within the next week or so, but hopefully
sooner. Look for it on Aminet (dev/amos) under the name: ppACC11.lha

    When you want to copy two arrays use the following:
    
        Dim a(n),b(n)
        Copy Varptr(a(0)),Varptr(a(0))+n*4 to varptr(b(0))
        
        Try it.It's ultra fast.Try to compare it with:
        For x=1 to n
            b(x)=a(x)
        Next
        
        When you want to initialize an array just use:
            Fill varptr(a(0)) to varptr(a(0))+n*4,0 ; fill it with 0
       
        You will notice the difference!
        
        Also deek(varptr(a(0))-4) gives N!

No, AmBk is not a bank, it's a command file of some sort.  That is the problem.

Sorry to bother you another time...

To all those who wanted turbo extension... I have it but is is INCOMPLETE 
due the fact that the version on the net is corrupted.
I have it directly uuencoded by the ftpmail server. I have uudecoded it 
and tested... but there are some errors in the lha files.

However the test shows that the core of the extension (the binary code) 
is intact. At least the AmosPro version of the turbo extension.

The process of dearchiving suddenly stops half way from the beginning 
while dearchiving the Demos.... so no docs!

If you are interested I will send you the code today and then I will go 
home and search the docs.

However... the package is not complete. 

Sorry. I think Amos the Creator owners will be disappointed. Sorry again.

However, don't do this if your arrays contain more than 65535 elements in
total, as then AMOS doesn't always store them in continous memory addresses.

Also, you might have trouble doing this with string arrays, as AMOS will lose
pointers to its strings, or gain duplicate pointers it doesn't know about.

This guy was talking about AMOS though. Is it possible to do this trick
in AMOS? You can certainly place 2 copies of the screen above each
other, but I think there's an annoying blank line left between them. In
Assembly, or even C, I'd agree with you, but AMOS... hmmmmmm...

OK, from your description I think it could be either:

1) a damaged CIA chip (CIA-A or CIA-B)
2) a virus

Try running Virus_Checker v6.51 over the system.. see if it picks up 
anything nasty. Failing that, try replacing one or both CIA chip(s).

I still think it could be a problem with CIA/A or CIA/B. Maybe one of 
your expansions shorted the CIA chips?
 Are you still using the standard A500 Power-Supply? It could be that all 
this extra stuff you've got overloaded the PSU, and shorted the CIAs?

Unless it's an intermittent connection fault on a memory-board, for

I believe the Aminet doesn't welcome .DMS files, only .LHA - and most 
users nowadays don't welcome non-dos disks either.

I have an Amiga 4000.  Many good games turn up on non-dos disks, and I 
can't install these on my hard drive.  Guaranteed I will return them or 
junk them or find someone who hacked away on it enough to make it 
HD-installable.  Part of the reason the Amiga has failed a lot lately in 
the games category has 
been due to the ignorance of large game developers in this respect.  

I will not play your game if it won't install on my hard drive.  I 
program in AMOS (look for /game/2play/airTaxi.lha on the Aminet) and my 
games will always be HD-installable (though it seems not always 
system-friendly).

In short, you can still protect your work before storing it in an .LHA 
archive.  I assume you want to use a non-dos disk to protect your work, 
but users will not be so accepting of your game unless it installs.

You should ask on the amos-list for ways to protect your work, rather 
than insulting other Amiga users.

---

One last thing:  large game developers use non-dos disks and other disk 
corruption schemes to protect against illegal duplication and to protect 
their work.  I can guarantee to you that the hundreds of groups of 
software pirates in the Amiga community will only be slightly delayed in 
altering commercial software to be more easily distributed when these 
techniques are used.  And this usually happens before the game is even 
released to the masses.

Does anyone else share these views?

X-Status: 

Firstly, thanks to the people that helped me with my query a while back 
on moving a car around the screen with a better feel (of inertia) to it.
It was suggested that I read the Inertia tutorial which I promptly did.
I also found an example program of a Lunar Lander style code.

I have since got it feeling reasonably good  with sliding around corners,
acceleration, etc. and introduced gears, and 2 cars controlled by 2 joysticks. 
I tried out some of the recent suggestions on car collisions of just simply
transferring the speed of one car to the other and adding in some friction.
When the cars collide a boom sound is played and they reflect off each 
other and I turned it into a sort of "smash-up-derby" where you start with
5 lives, each life consisting of a certain amount of damage. Once one player
has lost all his lives the other is declared the winner. The graphics are
pretty crude and there is just a still background.

  Now I want the cars to have some interaction with the background. I would 
like to have a track, or perhaps just some obstacles to avoid which would
cause damage also. What is the best way of going about achieving collision
detection with the background and with various objects around the track.
e.g. a grandstand or fence or an oil slick.
   The cars are currently bobs but there is probably no reason why they 
cannot be sprites. 
   Should I just draw the background in a certain colour range and check
for collision with certain colours( I think this method was used in the
space ship shoot em up game which came with AMOS,-its name escapes me)
or create the background using bobs and use bob collision techniques.
   Any suggestions?

Also there is a small amount of flicker which I would like to get rid of.
Any suggestions on removing that. i.e. Should I be using autoback 0 with 
the bob update off and bob clear,bob draw techniques?  I had a go at it
but couldn't get it working. Any suggestions on that one also would be
appreciated.

-thanks in advance
Max

The problem you have, as others already mentioned, has to do with your CIA
8520.
If you'r a bit technical you can open up your Amiga (gentle) and exchane the 
two 8520. 
My guess will be that you can't print anymore, your Parallel port will be 
disfunctional,
but your workbench will work just fine. If not, then it can also be that 
both your 8520
are gone. In any case, get two new 8520 and replace them both at the same 
time, otherwise
you will just loose them again after a while.

A three-five years ago, those chips cost about Fl 50,= a piece, so you'll 
have an idea about 
the price..

Ik hoop dat je hier voldoende aan hebt, anders moet je me het maar even 
laten weten, misschien
kan ik nog iets voor je doen..

Yep, Spot on, but programs that also annoy me enough to remove them from my HD
are those that don't let me QUIT back to Workbench or whatever without
rebooting. Unfortunately many Amos programs suffer from this problem.

Is this so you can annoy the hell out of anyone with a harddrive? The only
reason for using non-dos disks is for copy protection, and that usually
fails anyway. 

You can DMS dos disks anyway.

Yes it does. Aminet DOES welcome DMS files ONLY if the disk has a
non-dos Bootblock. However, there does seem to be quite a few .DMS
uploads that have normal Dos disks..but lets not get into that..

Lately? In the past year yes, but a hell of alot of games are becoming HD
installable, or have patches..everything from T17, Mortal Kombat II,
everything from Microprose and Ocean.

Yes, ok Good point. "IS tehre any other way to protect the work?".
Insulting other Amiga Users? Getoutahere..

Right, lets get this straight. The reasons i asked for the "protection"
were simple. 

1) So i can upload the disks as, well disks. It's a bit of pain getting
an LHA archive, decrompressing it to floppy and finding libraries etc
missing, having to rename disks etc. DMS is quicker and easier for
Multi-disk software. As my game is currently residing on Four disks, id
rather use DMS. But thats just my preference.

2) It would protect the sound, gfx etc. Yes, i know you can get rippers
and bits and pieces to grab the Gfx and samples, and if you can be
bothered to spend time doing this, then I think thats fine. It doesnt
bother me. What does bother me is me relasing a game wich, say loads up
Iff Screens, which someone can quite easily load into D-Paint and mess a
round with the re-release as there own "version". 

> Does anyone else share these views?
> 

Yes. Sort Of. And calm down! Good grief, I only asked a simple question,
i didnt expect the Spainish Inquisition ("No One Expects the Spainish
Inquisition" - Everyone) about it. Lets face it, the Amiga today is a
two tier computer. You have the A500/600/unexpanded 1200 crew who are
happy playing there games from floppy, doing the odd bit of tracking on
med, Dpainting etc, and the Expanded A1200/4000 crew, who DEMAND
everything should be HD JUST COS THEY HAVE ONE. Everything should be AGA
and everything should use extra memory. If you only play games that are
HD installable, you are missing a lot of good games. Everything from
Core and Virgin, for a start. Right ive finished now. Apologies to all
the other Amos-Listers. I'll shut up now.

Before doing anything major, try re-intalling first your "loadwb" command
from a floppy, and if that fails re-install your whole Workbench.
I've heard sometimes things can get corrupted.  (They get corrupted on a
weekly basis in a Mac)

Lud,

One question:  WHY?!?!?

I very rarely download DMS archives as they usually hide non-Hard Drive
installable things like you would be wanting to do.  DMS archives won't
get around the major online networks as fast as LHA ones, ESPECIALLY if they
are non-dos disks.

Putting a game in a NON-DOS disk AND a DMS archive is just plain stupid
in this day and age IMHO.

Rumble... Rumle... TADA!!!!

Surprise surprise... guess what?
I HAVE THE COMPLETE TURBO EXTENSION ARCHIVE!!!!!

Yes, i have found it on a old disk at the bottom of a 100 disk stack!
The archive was decrunched, but I have recrunched it with LHA. 
I hope I didn't delete anything when I decrunched it month ago.
If so, well, apologies, but you'll never obtain it!

If something has been deleted are the little README files which always
come with LHA archive and the Germany docs (if they existed) as this
is a standard routine for me when I decrunch things on my little HD.

So people, here the archive to all those who have asked for it.

I will send it to someone to be uploaded to gate.net.

However here some hints for AMOS:

- Always use XPK compressor to crunch your code. It is reduced even to
1/5 with the fast NUKE and a little more with the slow(est) Shrink.

- Don't bother about making backups before compressing the code. XPK
is very reliable. Use XDrop if you are searching a easy to use compressor.

- Use xData to automatically decompress the code when loaded.
  Xdata can be used also for other programs and is very powerfull.

- Install Easylife extension! It is VERY VERY POWERFULL and helps you
spending less time building complex routines as it has many new
commands (and direct support for XPK and PowerPacker).

- As you can see I am a Crunch maniac (nothing to do with Crunchmania though!).
I love spare space on my little HD. I have compressed all my executables
(commands and library included) and this allows me to store near twice
the amounts of data my HD would allow me. I never had problems with
packed programs. On a floppy based system a good packer as XPK can be
VERY VERY useful! My old WB floppy contains near 1.6 MB of uncrunched data!
And that was possible with NUKE, RAKE, SHRI and all the good
compressors XPK offers you.

There is not mean you should not use XPK. It is completely safe!
But not use XFH. It is very complex to install and if you make a
mistake ... zzzack! You'll your drawer! (Just try to compress a XPK
file twice!). I think its better to use XData together with XDrop.
So you can decide what to compress and what to leave unchanged every time.


End of suggestion.

This is more intended to new Amiga users and AMOS programmers which
could be in trouble with lots of disks full of their programs...
This way they can spare space but be able to read the compressed
programs when needed.

Yup.  What one person can create, another can break.  No protection is 
100%, and most games are cracked within hours of being released.  
Software houses need to realise this and stop attempting to protect the 
games, as all it does is serve to frustrate legitimate users of their 
products.  (I HATE manual protection and codewheels especially.  They're 
easy to defeat (have programmers not heard of photocopiers?) and are just 
annoying as hell!)

And re: DMS, we've been having a heated debate about it on alt.sys.amiga.
demos, and have decided that anyone who uses NDOS disks and DMS should be 
shot, especially since the idiotic PanCom software released a not- 
entirely-compatible-with-1.11 version.  Trackloaders are for lamers.

(As we speak I'm working on a registration-key routine so that if someone 
DOES copy your program you can tell where the copy originated.  I'll 
stick it on Aminet as soon as it's done.)

If your non-dos disk will install on my hard drive (strange), I would 
have no problem with it!  I know a couple of games that do this.

By the way, the Mortal Kombat II patch for HD installation was created by 
software PIRATES.  Acclaim picked the wrong developers (Probe I think) to 
reproduce their MK series.  There is no AGA version, and I doubt there 
will ever be.  It does not install on a hard drive without the patch, and 
those without internet access will have difficulty getting it.  It takes 
forever to load from floppy.  And the game SUCKS on the Amiga.

I have a framegrabber, and I have dabbled with digitizing myself, 
and have come up with some pretty keen demos.  I want to make a game
soon to prove that a good fighting game can be accomplished on the Amiga.

And I'll make the AGA version first :)

Nothing compares to Prince of Persia fights.  They are simple, and in a 
different type of environment, but fluid and realistic.

What do you think of MKI/II?

I suggest that you use bobs for things like oil slicks etc., and checking 
colours for detecting when the car is off the track.

I ALWAYS use Autoback 0 and Bob Clear/Draw...  Here's how it goes.

I made a little amigaguide help system for AmosPro.

But it uses LDos, MakeLib and EasyLife extensions.

If I distribute it as compiled .AMOS-program,
does the amos the accessory is used with need these extensions installed? 
Or is the needed code in the extensions  included in the compiled .AMOS 
program?

-----
Another question: is there a fast way to do a case-insensitive forward 
Hunt()?

-----
I have now used the help accessory for some days.
Works fine, is fast, accepts multiple .guide files, is very small and 
works better than the AmosPro 2.0 help program (you can press HELP even 
if cursor is in the middle of a command/function name and it will find 
the amigaguide node). I call the program "MultiHelp" and it should be on 
aminet soon.

Hi,
 
  If I understand your problem correctly, you want a menu to drop down and
present a list of options, and for the main program to continue running
regardless of whether the RMB has been pressed again or not. Unless the Amos
menu system is OS/Magic-Menu (or other program) compliant, which it almost
certainly isn't, you will have to write your own routine to draw a box, border
it, list the options, and then check for mouse click within the "menu". This
isn't really very difficult, and you can periodically check from within the
main program for a menu action.
 
  However if what you want is for the main program to update the screen *under*
the menu bar, then life suddenly becomes very interesting indeed. (I'd
recommend redesigning the interface, it would take much less time to do, and
wouldn't slow the program down). Alternatively use windows, but these really
suck when used with AMAL.

I have something against DMS. Undoubtedly, it is very practical 
for floppy-only users (when they still existed, last century), 
but for me it means a lot of extra unnecessary work.

I meant to add I believe there is such software, somewhere on the

  WHat I would suggest is a Background collision lookup table... this also
  works especially well if you plan to render the course from a set of
  tile primitives.. 

  Basically you just look up the 'collision' status for whatever 'tile' the
  car is on... So you have to compute which tile your on by examing the
  game map... Example:

  Tiles:        Description         Collison Status            
         1 -> a piece of track           0  (ie. no collision status)
         2 -> grass                      0
         3 -> tree                       1  (ie. collision)

     Tiles are 16x16 pixels for example.

  Race Track Map:

      2222222222  --> This would give you a (160,96) race track 
   |  2222332222      (ie. grass on the side of the track with 3 trees)
   +  1111111111
   y  1111111111  Of course in your game you will need more tiles and
   |  2222222232  a bigger map but the idea is exactly the same.
   V  2222222222
       ---+x-->  
    
    You can compute at what (xm,ym) in the map (ie. map co-ordinates) your
    car is at from its pixel co-ordinates (xp,yp) using:

		xm = xp / (tile width) = xp / 16
                ym = yp / (tile height)= yp / 16
    
    Tile Under Car = Map(xm,ym)

    Now that you know what tile your on you just use it to look up the
    collision status...

    if Collsion(Map(xm,ym))=1
       ** collison **
    else
       ** no collisn **

    For speed you should make the 'divisions' in the pixel->map co-ordinate
    formulas either shifts or just pre-calculated.  Depdending on how
    you decide to implement the Game Map (ie. array/memory bank/etc..)
    you can do the same things.

    One other thing that could make it fast is caching current tile lookups
    but I have never bothered to do this... 

    In your case you would probably want to set up most of the screen as
    the race track so you would need a (320/16)x(192/16) or 20x19 tile
    map.
  
    I hope this helps... if you need any clarifications just ask.. me 
    english not good.

  I use this technique... but I can't check any code right now.. but
  basically you turn off automatic bob update then you must expiclity
  say when to update your bob's...

   1. Save it will the Amos File.. not very good but it will stop the
      person that knows nothing except how to 'load' the files into
      Dpain or whatever

   2. Use a simple encryption scheme... ie. XOR all the 'data' with some
      passwd... 

   As you know you can never stop people from stealing your work but 
   by doing simple things you cut out 90% of the people anyway.

   I have an Amiga Action Replay so unless you prevent your program
   from booting if it detects the replay there is not much you can
   do to stop me... not that I would :)  its that you should just try to
   cut out the 'casual' ripper... because if somebody wants to rip
   your stuff they will...

Haven't you ever heard of dual playfields?  (:
Simply leave the top one open for the menus, and on the bottom one
do all your nifty stuff.

  Yes... but if you make it non-dos then that means that Hard Drive users
  won't like you.. :) ... I for example won't even try something if I
  can't run it from my HD and then quit...  and to DMS a disk it

That won't work for menus.  The menus won't drop down onto the second screen.
Unless you meant that he should have the top playfield extend to the lowest
point any one of his menus can go to, but that could look a little silly.

  Why?  If the menu screen is left blank, everything from the other screen
will show through anyway.

Lud,

One question:  WHY?!?!?

I very rarely download DMS archives as they usually hide non-Hard Drive
installable things like you would be wanting to do.  DMS archives won't
get around the major online networks as fast as LHA ones, ESPECIALLY if they
are non-dos disks.

Putting a game in a NON-DOS disk AND a DMS archive is just plain stupid
in this day and age IMHO.

I suggest that you use bobs for things like oil slicks etc., and checking 
colours for detecting when the car is off the track.

I ALWAYS use Autoback 0 and Bob Clear/Draw...  Here's how it goes.

Screen Open 0,320,200,8,Lowres

Here is a simple way - crunch them with an XPK cruncher that encrypts them,
then use the easylife XPK bank load command to reload them. Then for others
to get at your graphics, they'll have to hunt throught the compiled program
code for the password, and if you build it up from several strings at runtime
rather than using a literal string in the source program, they probably won't
find it.

Not only are your files then protected, they take up less space!

    Of course this method cannot be used with strings due to the 
garbage collection etc.

    For extensions' creators: I think that the address of the screen's 
rastport structure is Leek(Areg(5)-$18c0) or            
move.l -$18c0(a5),...  Use it for graphics operations.

    P.S I'm at the university right now.So I hope I'm not wrong... 
I'll send you the correct address  if this one is wrong.

Hi all.

I saw that someone has the same problem i had before programming
my game. But, during programming, i thinked that there are no
ways to protect well your work because pirates crack all.
So i decide to protect graphics and sound in other way. Currently
i'm using easylife extension, which supports xpk compressions.
If you  need some protection for your work you simply have to
compress what do you want with an xpk tool and a password.
After, you can write a routine to read an xpk compressed file in
a bank. To do this, simply use easylife command Elxpk Load.It's
useful and it works fine. Try it!

However, if you haven't xpk user pack, you can find it on Aminet in
directory util/pack. It is called xpk25usr.lha. You can find alsO Some
others xpk libraries that there aren't in this pacK.

I have written a program in Amos which involves a `laser beam`
being fired from one part of the screen to another.
To do this I just work out dy and dx ( one of these values
will be 1) and add them to the original points until the
destination is reached or it hits something.

It works fine when run through the editor, yet when compiled...
does not. Why???  I use real numbers for dx and dy - maybe
the compiler cannot deal with these or something?
The beam does not go in the right direction at all.

Has anyone got a list of inconsistencies in compiler/interpreter
operation? This is driving me up the wall.

Could someone explain in some depth what ways one can protect his/her work
legally?  ie Copyright etc.  AmigaWorld seems to say that by merely
creating something it is "copyrighted", but one should show "Copyright (C)

they have if any to distribute or otherwise abuse the program code.  How
does this protection serve one internationally also?

  I was going to say "sounds like the old division bug" before I noticed
that you're using floating point numbers.  Try using Set Double Precision,
or stop using it if you already are - I recall that one or the other had
problems in the compiler.

Try not to use anything but integers for games.  Many may disagree, but 
it is simply the only way to go.  Especially since the compiler doesn't 
work well with floats and not always with math functions.  In airTaxi, I 
had a purple sphere magnet that would pull all the cars toward itself.  
This involved some basic vector and magnetism functions, but I used all 
integers to do it.  Simply have an X value that represents 1/100th of a 
pixel, same with Y.  Then set dx or dy to 100 and the other to cos/sin * 100.
Your routine will perform faster too.  If you need more accuracy, use 256 
or more instead of 100.  Just divide by the number to get the real pixel 
position.

In my game, I also had to abort at the beginning if SQR(4)<>2.  Why?  
Because the compiler would 20% of the time not include the math libraries 
or something like this.  My purple sphere would not attract anything at 
all - this is how I noticed the problem.

Hope this helps - Dave May

	Does anyone out there know how to get AMOS to honor screenmode
promotion so it will come up in dblNTSC instead of NTSC.  I'm using a
multiscan monitor that won't go down to 15kHz, the WB is in "multiscan"
screenmode and mode promotion is turned on (and honored by other programs)
but AMOS won't.  I've tried the ForceMon commodity, it doesn't help either.

If you mean real as in floats (#), try placing an dummy variable in the
very beginning of your source:

DUMMY#=0.0

The compiler has trouble with floats sometimes and this usually fixes it.

Technically anything you create is automatically copyrighted, but the 
burden of proof lies with the copyrighter, not the copier, so the best 
thing to do to ensure that you are protected is to seal it in an envelope 
and have it stamped by a notary public and then kept by a lawyer, banker, 
etc.  The copyright is international except (I think) in the case of 
books, where the US has a different set of laws.

Well, I was bored, so I cooked up the bare bones for a text adventure 
game.  It may not look pretty, but what's here works so far.  Here's a 
breakdown of the variables and procedures...

NW	Number of words per command (max).
W$()	Holds command and its parameters.  W$(1) is the command,
	and W$(2) is its first parameter.  A "###" in an element
	means that there are no more parameters to follow.
RD$()	Holds room descriptions.
OB$()	Holds object descriptions.  OB$(x,0) is the object's name,
	OB$(x,1) is it's description for EXAMINE[], and OB$(x,2) is
	reserved for future expansion.
OB()	Holds object information.  OB(x,0) is the room that the object
	is in.  A 0 indicates that the player is holding the object.  The
	other elements are unused, but are for things like score, weight,
	and special attributes.
RM()	Holds room information.  RM(x,0) contains the number of objects in
	a room.  RM(x,1) to RM(x,10) indicate which rooms are accessible
	in which direction.  (See D$())
D$()	Directions corresponiding to RM(x,1) - RM(x,10).
DD$()	Abbreviations of directions for moving.
CD$	Moves the cursor to the left of the screen and down one line for
	formatting data strings.

BRKSENTENCE[]	Breaks A$ down into words and stores them in W$().
SROOM[]		Displays current room, showing exits and objects.
CMD[]	Displays a prompt and reads a command.  If a null is entered
	a "Huh?" is displayed, and if the word "again" is entered, it
	repeats the last command (passed as a parameter).  The command
	is returned in Param$.
TAKE	Picks up objects and stores in player's inventory.  Objects can be
	specified as "all" (picks up all objects in current room) or as a
	list (with "and" and "the" being ignored).
DROP	The antithesis to TAKE.
INV	Displays the player's inventory.
EXAMINE		Allows the player to examine an object if they are holding
	it.  If the object is not held by the player but is in the room,
	a message will be displayed telling them to pick it up.  If the
	object isn't in the room, it tells you there isn't one.
HELP	Hah!
TME	Displays the game time.  Each turn takes a "minute" excluding
	invalid commands.
DUMP	A debugging aid - displays the contents of W$().

Current commands:

n, s, e, w, ne, se, nw, sw, up, down : Move in the desired direction.
get, take : Pick up objects.
time : Show game time.
help : Display a sarcastic message.
drop : Drop objects.
quit : Exit game.
again : Repeat last command.
look : Show room description, exits, and objects.
inv, inventory : Show objects held by player.
exam, examine : Look closely at an object.

I'm working on containers (objects which can contain other objects), and 
functions for helping plot development, like DOES_HOLD, HAS_HELD, 
HAS_BEEN_TO, IS_IN, etc., plus things like automapping, et al.  I also 
may turn it into an adventure creator, but that looks like hard work. :)  
(I'm also working on a multi-player version for people running TCP/IP, 
but I'm not even going to ATTEMPT that in AMOS - that's a job for C! :)  
Anyone recommend a decent PD or shareware C compiler?  I'm using an 
ancient version of DICE at the moment....

Anyway, here it is - sorry for the length of my posting and rambling, but 
it's been a slow day at work. :)

(Oh, and I had to post raw ASCII 'cause I'm on a (hack, cough) PC at the 
moment.)

  Right - this offers lots of speed.  But then you have to watch out for
the compiler's division bug - if you use negative numbers in division, it
rounds the wrong way.  Having a separate "direction" variable can fix this,
bug it's still annoying.

Hello All!
     I have been out of the Amos scene for a while so I was wondering if
somebody could help me.

     1) Is AmosPro fully compatible with the A1200? (Does it support the AGA
        chip set and advanced graphic modes?)

     2) Are large programs written in Amos V1.34 fully compatible with AmosPro?
        (I wrote an Ascii Screen Designer that I want to convert)

     3) Does AmosPro run faster on the A1200?

     4) Finally, aside Amos, Is a 3.5" IDE reliable for use on Amiga 1200? And
        if so, can I use the IDE drives advertised in PC magazines on the A1200
        with an appropriate cable?

     Thanks to those who read

Hi all, i'm Luca.
For everyone who want to protect his work with xpk:

If you want to protect Modules & Sounds you have to use DLTA library + another
library (ex. imploder IMPL). This is a standard xpk library and it is in the 
xpk pack. If you want a library to compress Protracker modules, well, i think
you have to get xpkSMPL library from AMINET in directory util/pack.
If you want to compress and protect an image or a text, well, i think you have
to use CMBR xpk library. This library is useful for datas not compressed. Don't
try to use it with a packed file!
If you want a fast compression/decompression, well, FAST xpk library is what you
need but you can use also FLSH xpk library (you can find it on AMINET in directory
util/pack).It's faster than HUFF library but it has a lower compression ratio.
There are a lot of xpk library, everyone with a special data support and you can
try to use them with a moltitude of files. On Aminet there are others xpk library
(they are new!) and they are xpkMASH,xpkRAKE and xpkSQHI. I think that the number 
of xpk libraries will grow...

Hi!

I would recommend you to follow Andy Churchs advice and
only use integers in your game.
You (and probably others on this list) may be interested
to know that there is an efficiently programmed AMOS
procedure for 100% integer line drawing in the AMOS
procedure library on Aminet. This procedure can be integrated
in your games very easily and modified to plot dotted
lines or lines drawn with icons/bobs/blocks by replacing
the "Plot x,y" command by "Paste Icon x,y,icon".
The procedure works well once compiled too.

Regards,
	Chris

  Nope - AMOS doesn't use Intuition screens.  You're out of luck.

I think it's been discussed here before, but is it possible to pipe
data to a compiled program?

If it's not directly possible, would it be possible to take the piped
data, write it to a temporary file, and the pass the file name to
the compiled AMOS program in the command line?

Sadly you're out of luck, as all the Mode Promotion commodities intercept 
Intuition calls to open screens, and AMOS and Intuition have only a 
nodding acquaintance.  Your best bet is to edit all your programs with a 
regular text editor, open all your screens with the Intuition extension, 
and then compile them, as there is no way in hell that AMOS Pro's editor 
will open on a DblPAL screen.  (Actually your best bet is to dump AMOS 
altogether and go for Blitz2, 'cause that'll do it no problem.)

Um, it'd be easier to parse the input string (say ST$) directly to a 
integer array with the numbers of words (say you have an array VB$()
which contains the list of possible verbs, directly parse the number of 
the verb into w(). For nouns, just OR 128 them (so that object# 5 would 
be (5 or 128)=133) then after parsing the whole string to the integer 
array, you can simply search through for verbs, etc.).)

> RD$()	Holds room descriptions.
This'll work, but it might be better to have all the descritions in a 
text file. Easier to type up (no RD$(3)="lskjdglskjdf" over and over)
and save RD$() for the room names to have at the top of the screen.

Perfect. Maybe use OB$(x,2) for a list of alternate words that could be 
used to refer to that object.

Go man, go! :)

Essentially, yah, but why store number of objects? To see any objects in 
a room:    PRINT"Things that are here:" : FOR T=1 to <num of object> : IF 
OB(T,0)=CURRENT_ROOM THEN PRINT OB$(t,0);" "; : NEXT T

Aw Yeah

CD$=CHR$(13)

Yer string parser, token based (put 'em intah W() instead)

"all" isn't good 'cuz if you have hidden objects you probably want the 
player to spend a little more work finding 'em.

IF OB(x,0)=0 OR OB(x,0)=CURRENTROOM THEN PRINT OB$(x,1)

OB(x,4) = flags
OB(x,5) = parent
OB(x,6) = child

where flags: 1 <- This object is in object pointed to by the parent int.
             2 <- This object is locked and needs child int to unlock
             4 <- This object is blocking movement to parent (direction)
                  and requires object child to unlock
etc..

Too hard. you have to write a programming language of some sort to make
it really work well.

I'm using Sozobon (ZC) but I bet DICE is better.

    I think that AmosPro "extension" (AmosPro.Lib) doesn't use the 
same logic that Lionet describes in |Music.s.The token table is ok 
but there are very few move.l (a3)+,... How do the the parameters 
pass?
    What about -4(a5) address? What's in it?

Hi all!

I would like to answer at a question about Amos, sended on Thursday Feb 22.

1) Amos works now on AGA machine too but it doesn't support AGA chipset.
   If you want to open AGA screen, well, ask about intuition extension
   (copyright Andy Church...)

3) Depends on program (or games...). I think that graphic commands run faster
   on an A1200  because MC68020 is faster than MC68000.

4) Yes, IDE hard-disks work fine on A1200. IDE 2"5 are for internal use and you
can buy an IDE PC hard-disk. IDE 3"5 are for external use and you need an
external controller (ex. Overdrive....) and a cable......

Subject: AMOS and APro compiler speed differences:
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII
Content-Length: 1577

Hello everybody!

Like many others on this list I have recently switched to
AMOS Pro thanks to the coverdisk of the Amiga Format
magazine. I have also directly ordered the AMOS Pro
compiler which I have received a few days ago. As the
AP compiler manual stated that the compiler had been
optimized compared to the AMOS Creator compiler, I have made
a few simple benchmarks to test that. They are by no way
extensive or very meaningful, but they might interest you anyway.

The benchmarks have been tested in the following way:

T=Timer
For H=1 to 200000
  A=B*16
Next H
PRINT Timer-T

The result is therefore the number of 1/50th seconds on
my PAL Amiga 4000/40 25 MHz.

The most interesting thing is probably that the AP interpreter
is about 10% slower than the AMOS interpreter, probably due to
the higher number of commands it has to check all the time.
You'll also see that the AP compiler is indeed faster than
the AMOS Creator compiler, but the difference is only really
significant in a few cases that have been specially optimized
(A=B*16 is translated with the assembler shift commands as
shown in the AP Compiler manual and the A#=B#^4 statement
has probably been simplified to A#=B#*B#*B#*B#).

		 UNCOMPILED	COMPILED CODE
		AMOS	APro	A Comp	AP Comp

A=B*16		114	124	30	13
A=B*C		123	133	31	30
A=B/C		134	141	45	39
A#=B#*C#	126	148	36	34
A#=B#^4		318	296	222	147
A#=Sin(B#)	135	139	54	50


By the way: I would be interested to know the correspnding times
on other Amiga machines (A1200, A500, 68030 systems etc.)
Maybe some of you can check that...

Cheers,

	Chris

Hello amos users.

Ive just subscribed so I thought I'd introduce myself.
I'm in my final year studying computer science at Queens univ.,
Belfast and I'm into AMOS cos you can do in 20-100 lines of code 
the sort of things that take hundreds of lines of C. Opening a screen
being the prime example. As for coding interrupt driven,
 double buffered sprite animation in C, I wouldnt have a notion
where to start. But in AMOS - its a piece of pith (as you all know.)

Anyways, I have a couple of questions which someone might care to 
help me with...

1. Is there any way at all to do dynamic memory  allocation
 and deallocation in AMOS? I'm using AMOS creator at the moment,
perhaps switching to AMOS Pro would solve this one?

2. How do I extend the limit on the number of 3d objects in AMOS 3D
beyond the default 20? Also, how do I erase a 3d object for reuse?
These two are probably easy to answer if you have the manual. (I
got the programs, library etc. off a magazive coverdisk way back)

Cheers.

Stan Hoben.

Another method is to put the software or whatever is being copyrighted in 
a sealed envelope and mail it to yourself, (don't open when it arrives to 
you tho'), this way it is dated proof that it is copyright to you on the 
date stamped by the post office, sorry if I'm not making sense, but the 
day after surgery pone can't be expected to make much sense. =->

Yeah, what he says! But seriously now. The two main things to 
keep in mind are that anything you create is your intellectual 
property and that you have to prove yourself that you created it 
in the first place. I think in America you can have it officially 
copyrighted, which relieves you of the burden of proof. I guess 
you should better ask this to a lawyer or something (do they have 
free legal aid in America?). 
Everything else follows from the two main things mentioned. 
Before you start sealing stuff in envelopes think about what 
exactly you want to copyright. If your game is played according 
to a whole new concept, you may want to copyright the concept 
also. If you don't, Nintendo's lawyers will play and win a nice 
cat and mouse game with you (well, in theory). So describe what's 
so great and new about about your gameplay and put that 
description in the sealed envelope also. 
OTOH, if you just want hAkZz from turning your game 
(hypothetically, it could be a spreadsheet) into waIRz, it's 
enough to just include the game. Remember to put some screenshots 
in there too, as magnetic media are less reliable than paper 
ones.
You could just send a sealed and dated envelope to yourself, 
saving you a lot of money.
Internationally, I would first see if you can take any action 
against illegal copying. It probably is very expensive to hire a 
lawyer 'abroad' to represent you, so why bother.

Could you tell us what exactly you are going to copyright (in as 
vage as possible terms of cours :-) ), and what or whom you want 
to protect it from, because I am hypothesizing a lot here.

	yes this is true...

	I only know a very little so you should not take what I say as in
  anyway legal advice... its just merely what I have found out which may
  or may not be correct... but their is
  something to do with the "Berne" (sp?) copyright law or something... it is
  upheld by many countries...  There is a copyright WWW or faq out their
  read 'misc.legal.computing' for a couple days to find out.. I used to
  know but I forgot.

	You should be careful of 'software patents'... I used
  to think that these were not that serious but they are... for example
  if you created a 'cursor' in a program of yours using the 'XOR' operation
  then you are violating a patent... the guy who patented this gets
  royalties for using the 'XOR' cursor technique... apperently a whole bunch
  of these trivial patents were granted because the patent office didn't
  have any computer experts to examine the patent claims... IBM/Micrsoft
  were even offering bonuses for every patent obtained by their employees.
  THey did this because they know that they can't get all of them but what
  they want to do is get as many as possible so that it would be improbable
  that you could code a program without using one of their patents... so
  now they can swap patent usage with other big companies and charge
  royalties from smaller companies...  Basically it's probable that your
  program already has at least 1 patent violation... but this was for the
  U.S.... I'm not sure about other countries.. but I beleive it includes
  Canada/Mexico... something to do with GATT... so you may not have to
  worry about software patents yet in your country but if you plan to
  distribute in the U.S. then you do... 
	

	I had to stop reading 'misc.legal.computing' because it was 
  starting to piss me off too much... There is some League for 
  Programming Freedom (LPF) that you can join to try to help stop
  software patents..

It runs on an A1200, but does not support the AGA chip set, unless you are

Almost - There are a few minor changes. The only major problems you might

It is also not any faster (If anything a little slower) than AMOS V1.36

This probably won't fix it, but AMOS Creator is upto v1.36.  The updater

I have posted the following message to the list
yesterday, but it has not appeared. I'm sending it
again and hope you won't get it twice.
----------------------------------------------------
Hello everybody!

Like many others on this list I have recently switched to
AMOS Pro thanks to the coverdisk of the Amiga Format
magazine. I have also directly ordered the AMOS Pro
compiler which I have received a few days ago. As the
AP compiler manual stated that the compiler had been
optimized compared to the AMOS Creator compiler, I have made
a few simple benchmarks to test that. They are by no way
extensive or very meaningful, but they might interest you anyway.

The benchmarks have been tested in the following way:

T=Timer
For H=1 to 200000
  A=B*16
Next H
PRINT Timer-T

The result is therefore the number of 1/50th seconds on
my PAL Amiga 4000/40 25 MHz.

The most interesting thing is probably that the AP interpreter
is about 10% slower than the AMOS interpreter, probably due to
the higher number of commands it has to check all the time.
You'll also see that the AP compiler is indeed faster than
the AMOS Creator compiler, but the difference is only really
significant in a few cases that have been specially optimized
(A=B*16 is translated with the assembler shift commands as
shown in the AP Compiler manual and the A#=B#^4 statement
has probably been simplified to A#=B#*B#*B#*B#).

		 UNCOMPILED	COMPILED CODE
		AMOS	APro	A Comp	AP Comp

A=B*16		114	124	30	13
A=B*C		123	133	31	30
A=B/C		134	141	45	39
A#=B#*C#	126	148	36	34
A#=B#^4		318	296	222	147
A#=Sin(B#)	135	139	54	50


By the way: I would be interested to know the correspnding times
on other Amiga machines (A1200, A500, 68030 systems etc.)
Maybe some of you can check that...

Cheers,

	Chris

I haven't seen or heard anything. Is there anyone ho knows?

Do anyone knows what have happend to Mandarin? And is there comming

I'm working on creating a bi-monthly amiga magazine (which is viewed with 
a special program I'm working on) to talk about various things. If anyone 
wants to take part in the graphic elements, music (background music for 
each one) or actual writing, please email me (doctorx@rain.org.) It'll be 
something like LOADSTAR for the C= 64, except I doubt I'll include 
programs unless they're small.  

The main reason I'm doing this is becaues Amiga World is becoming thinner 
every day. It's really sad, but I do know that there are a lot of Amiga
users out there so maybe this will help bring them together. 

The reason I put this messaege in this mailing list is because I am using 
AMOS to write the file interpreter (viewer/reader/whatever.) It's going 
to be graphics/music/interactive. Like those "multi-media CD-ROM" thingos.


Let me know.

Hiya folks,

Anyone know for sure what causes a compiled Amos program to require the
Mathtrans.library in libs: to run?  I'd like my program to run without
ANY external C= libraries like it has before, but now for some reason
it needs mathtrans.  What does mathtrans do anyway?

Look for it on Aminet ! (dev/amos)

What is it ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well it is an accessory program/utility for AMOS Professional that will
allow you to crunch your source code using the powerpacker.library and
any memory banks that might be attached to your source code. This
program will also decrunch your crunched source and load it into AMOSPro's
editor.

What is the latest version ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
v1.2 - added program auto-detection routine.

Note: I have just uploadeed this version tonight 2/23 @ 22:26pm so look 
      for it within the next day or so ...

In my last letter, i wrote about differents xpk libraries.
Some xpk names are wrong...
So these are the real names:

 - CBR0   for uncompressed file...
 - SMPL   only for samples...
 - SQSH   for samples & modules (PT/NT/ST)
 - FAST   very fast compression with this library (i called it FLSH...)

 To compress a file use command XPK:


    Ex.  xpk -s -p "password" -m "method"  FILES

	 xpk -s -p topsecret -m HUFF.50 text1.asc image.gif ....

	 PS: Not all the libraries support password!
