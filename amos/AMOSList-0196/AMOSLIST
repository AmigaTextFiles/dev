X-Status: 

Hello!
I've downloaded an updater (v1.36) for the creater compiler.
I can't get it to update because the program won't recognise the updater disk.
I believe this to be because the disk has to have an actual name used in the 
program
and I don't know what to call the disk because the file I downloaded doesn't 
tell me!
Does anyone know what I should call the disk?
Thanks for any help
Pete

P.S.  Thanks to everyone who explained how to use lha

 p> Hello

Hello

 p> I've just downloaded the update for the AMOS creater compiler but it's
 p> in a file format that I don't recognise.  It ends with a '.lha' which I

Yes, lha is the most common packer for Amiga. Quite all the files on Aminet
end by .lha. There must be a version of it also on Aminet ot look on some
of the disks sold with the magazine like AmigaFormat.
It's very easy to use: read the manual.

 p> Also, can anyone tell me if there are any AMOS extensions available to
 p> download from any FTP sites?

There are some extension:
on Aminet you can get Turbo extension, Easylife, Ldos and JDextension.
Using the WWW, you can get Intuition extension
(http://mmm.mbhs.edu/cgi-bin/achurch/amos/)

If you're using AmosPro, you can find also AMCAF from Aminet.

I don't know about it, sorry.

I've had this problem too.  No matter what I did I couldn't get it to 
work either.  It looks like it wasn't actually implemented, as far as 
I could see.  Mind you, ActiveList does work.  You wouldn't have 
thought it would be much effort to write an InactiveList from the 
code for the ActiveList, would you?  Never mind...

Also, there is an Interface instruction (can't remember what it's 
called) to change the colour of a scrollbar.  Has anyone got this to 
work as I had similar problems with it?

This is probably a very clumsy method, but could you use the CLI 
command DIR to put the contents of the directory in a temporary file 
in RAM.  Does DIR show at the end xxx files!?  If not, you'd have to 
count all the lines in it, but as it's in RAM it would hardly take 
forever.

Probably slower in general though.  :-(

 If you are no longer making AmoNER, is there any chance that you

    I believe I have workbench 3.1 and amospro runs perfect and I love it.
   Only problem was I couldn't get amos1.3 compiler to work w amospro(it
    worked once) otherwise it was worth the money and more.  Don't
    take my word for it yet, I'll make sure at home (i'm in school) that my
    wb is 3.1 and then I tell you.

The compressor came with the compiler, in the same box. I'd check your
disks again, because it may be on there.
I've never used it myself. I was interested in it once, but never got
around to finding out if it works with amospro, so I haven't used it.

This is Andrew with some very important questions!!!
Dominic Ramsey gave me this adress, and told me, that you can help me.

I would be very glad, if you get time to check out and answer my questions.!

1.) If you use AMOS assembled code, am I allowed to access the banks as normal
    (I think this works) But, does it work in another way,.... like that:
    From an Amos main program I call an amos assembled and correct installed
machinecode. This machinecode should be able to call another machinecode,
where I want to manipulate music or bob banks which I use in the above 
    !!main!! - program. 

2.) How does the Pload and the Call- command from Amos work.
    Can I get the sourcecode from somewhere? This would be very usefull and
very helpfull to me, because I would not need to debug tghe Amos.Lib

3.) Are there any information about the connections from the Areg(5) in the 
    Internet, i mean, with an useful description.

OKAY, no more questions this time.
I would be happy, if you can answer my questions 


PS: I really need the question and maybe some sources!

Hello everybody,

I want to tell all you that is available my LOGO language on Aminet.
After 6 moths of hard work, it's finally ready!!
Unfortunately it's totally in Italian, but you can get it just to see how I
did it: it's totally in AMOS Pro!

It's fast (not as Amos, of course!!), easy and goodlooking.

To watch a program: type "carica" and select the program you want to run:
enjoy it!!
To esc a running program press Esc.

The Logo is shareware: at the beginning you have to wait some seconds: if

you
register, you'll have a keyfile to jump the delay.

Thank you and bye.

Hello all!

I thought I'd just take this opportunity to advertise some of my programs
on aminet, including my latest uploads and newest versions. ;-)

Knockout in game/2play - My most popular game ever. There are 8 cars on
a shrinking circle and the idea is to knock each other off by ramming
into them. 1-7 human players can take part, with the rest computer
controlled. It used to need loads of memory and a fast processor, but
now it *should* work on any Amiga with 1Mb.

Bounce in game/jump - Move the bouncing ball through 25 levels, collecting
jewels, swimming through water, getting sucked through pipes and avoiding
the spikes.

Battle of the Blobs in game/2play - My first ever AMOS game, and it shows.
;-) It's still quite fun for 2 players though, with (I think) 60 levels.

3D Pro in gfx/3d - The most powerful and easy-to-use stereogram/magic
eye picture generator available. ;-)

Any comments/suggestions please, good or bad. ;-)

Sorry if anyone has received this before but...

What is the best way to check whether it is possible to save 
something to an assign (from within Amos, of course).  I do not want 
ANY requesters appearing on the Amos or Workbench screens.

For example, suppose I want to save a bank to disk under the name 
"BankName" under the directory given by the assign "ProgName:".  The 
main problem I'm thinking of is if the assign corresponds to a floppy 
disk which is write protected (although other problems such as the 
volume being full etc, could be detected).

Am I making any sense?!?!?!?!?!?!?

The thing is, I know how to test whether the disks in DF0: or DF1: 
are write protected, but I dont know whether "ProgName:" corresponds 
to DF0:, DF1:, or neither.

I could examine the output from the DOS "Info" command but this would 
be clumsy :-(

I expect there is an easy solution using some Error trapping, but it 
would be nice to know the BEST way to do it since almost every long 
Amos program writes something to disk...

Please help!!!!

Cheers,

Mark

 Hello again fellow AMOSPro fans.

 Its been along time between post from me but thats because I've been 
working my happy little tail off on my BIG project. For those of you who 
have forgot or who are new to the list here is a short description of my
game in progress.

 CommBatt, a two player only, direct modem to modem war game.
It was inspired by the great game Dune II. Each player has upto 25 units of
armored attack forces who are compeating over the mineral Sunderium, the
only isotope powerful enough to kick Jump ships into Hyper Space.
 There are three different types of Armored Forces to pick from, each with
different attack strengths and weakness's. Fifteen different buildings to
increase the strength of your forces and mining operations. Armored walls
with Gun, Laser and Missle turrets to protect your fortress.
 The game is Pal Lowres in 32 glorious colors. Features a Chat mode for
gloating over your latest kill. In game Save mode so you can stop in the
middle of those long battles to let Mom have the phone. Eight different
maps ranging from Easy to Impossible ( Easy = Lots of starting Ore ). A map
editor for custom level design. Is Hard Drive Installable and will be 
Shareware.
 The unregistered version will have many of these features disabled and
will not include the map editor.
 This project is coming along quiet well and should see the light of day in
a few short weeks. I will post to the list when it goes up on the Aminet.

 Okay enough about that. I wont to make this program even better than it is
now by using the features of many of the great extensions now out for
AMOSPro v2.0. I have just recived enough money to make this possible and am
here to ask many people for some info about thier extensions.
 
 Chris H. of AMCAF fame. I live in the USA and have never ordered anything
outside the US. What form of payment is best to send you? And how much
should I send for fast snail mail? My Email provider does not allow file
attachments.

 Manuel Andre (If on the list or anyone who can answer this) of Power Bobs
and Turbo Plus. Power Bobs is great but, ALL Turbo extension demos I have 
tried on my A1200 has caused a CRASH. Can I use Turbo on the A1200?

 To Anyone with EME (Enhanced Music Extension). Does this extension fix all
the bugs in the Music Lib? Is it as good as AMCAF's protracker support?
Will it fix the Med sample loop problem? Should I spend $15.00 on it?

 Can anyone tell me where I can buy TOME for the A1200? Living in Backwater
Alabama USA I never saw any of these great programs for AMOS until I joined
the AMOS List. I really want TOME.

 Andy C. of Intuition Extension. Should I ignore Zipperware and buy the
extension from you? Is the new version near release? Should I wait on it or
will I be able to upgrade when it comes out?

 I just bought Ultimate AMOS are thier any other books I should get?

 And last but not least should I delay CommBatt just a little longer and
Include 64 color Raytraced graphics?

 Any and all help on any of the above will be a BIG help to me. I have
really gotten the AMOS bug and this List is the Best! Thanks to any and all
who have helped me in the past or who have just posted tips of any kind. I
have learned so much from here and look forward to learning more.

 Opps! Almost forgot. Daryll sorry I never sent you a beta version of
Commbatt but as I said earlyer this provider will not support file
atachmments and the game has gotten so huge that UUe is out of the
question. I will send you a full version Regestered when done. If you still
wont it. Do you have some friends you could play it with?

It should be possible doing something like :

Request Off
Repeat
   Trap Save FILE$,BANK
   If Errtrap=Something
      Print "Disk full"
   Else If Errtrap=Somethingelse
      Print "Disk error"
   Else ...etc
   Endif
Until Errtrap=0

  Uh oh... I have competition! :)

  Also, a quick note: your address came out as @MASSILIA with no domain

.wav is the PC format for sounds. Either play it on a PC that has windows
and a soundblaster or look for a converter file on aminet. I know there is
atleast one there, as I had it once to convert a number of .wav files to
use on the amiga.

In the readme (you should always check out the readme with the file on
aminet!) I mentioned that it might need more than 1 meg. I was not sure, as
all my amigas have been modified to 2 meg.
700k is not that monstrous. If you think that's big, don't get into 3D
graphics or raytracing. All my future games will be that big or bigger and
use my new anim2bob 3D engine.
Another reason it is so big is the sound sample that I us as a backing
track on it.

So, did you like it?

>Is the AS AMOS column yours? It's terrible.
 For an intelligent person such as yourself you should be able to work out 
 if the Amos column is 'mine'.

>It's terrible.
 You can please some of the peeps some of the time but not all.......


>I was very angry. It's probably the worst column I've ever seen.
 It's funny aint it, I was warned that writing a column in the mags
 makes you public property and people think they have the right to publicly
 insult and embarass you. That is your opinion and you are entitled to it
 of course.
 But if you knew how the magazines work as far as freelancing goes you may 
 not of been so harsh on me. I will not go into details as I don't feel I 
 have to justify anything to anyone. I was my first bit of paid freelance 
 work and thanks to you probably my last on Amos, so I hope that makes you 
 happy?
 So there goes another chunk of the Amos scene, don't expect any new Amos
 users if the mags don't cover it. 

 I belive I have done my bit to try and keep Amos alive, 
 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE MATE?

>but please, make the column a bit more serious.
 I write what I am told to write. I was told to keep it simple, I thought
 this was good as it would encorrage new users.

>why not some words about the Easylife zone system?
 I covered extensions briefly in part 1 and my 'usless example' would of
 been even more useless to PEOPLE WITHOUT THE EXTENSION DOH!, and what about
 Amos Classic users as far as I recall it doesn't work on AC (?could be
 wrong there though) 

>the disk with AMOS stuff was faulty and I couldn't watch it:
>were there something interesting?
 That's my fault I purposely corrupted your copy of the disk but noone
 elses. I did it so you couldn't see how pathetic my code is.

>Why don't you get AmosProc on Aminet (I can't remember the real name) and
>check for interesting stuff?
 Because I wanted new stuff previously unreleased. What flaming would you
 of given me for doing that? Using procs off the Aminet, it would of been
 totally useless to you wouldn't it? And you would of been flaming me again.
 As it turned out I had to use oldish stuff anyway.
 
>If you improve the column I could even order AS every month, but going like

>programming language, not crap.
 Ok it is dead, just for you as of part 6 it is no more, even if I am offered
 it again.

Hello all,
    Is this the correct address to send to now?  After a lot of traffic I
haven't recieved any mail from the list for two days now!

    Can someone mail me if this gets through.  Thanks.

Also, whatis the standard no. of colours used in AMOS programs, assuming low
res.  I have been using 32, but scrolling especially is slow and gets alot of
colour flicker.  And YES, I have been using double buffer and Wait VBL.  The
double buffer doesn't actually seem to make any difference anyway!  Weird!!

Any ideas?

Hi,

I just uploaded my new AMOS-game to Aminet. It's shareware and an
adventure like Monkey Island or Indiana Jones. You'll find it under
game/demo/ParrotIsland.lha
Check it out and give me some mail. Or buy the complete game (only $15 :-)

Maybe you also want to see a shoot'em up, even on Aminet under
game/shoot/offence.lha

AO> 1.) If you use AMOS assembled code, am I allowed to access the banks as normal

Yes... all you have to do is to load the address of the bank into one of
the Areg() or Dreg() registers before you 'call' your routine or if you
are using the procedure type of asm implemention, you can put the args on
the (a3) stack. Remember to preserve the A3-A6/D6/D7 registers.

Your asm procedure/bank has to be 100% pc relative. Only one (the first)
hunk is supported.

AO>     (I think this works) But, does it work in another way,.... like that:
AO>     From an Amos main program I call an amos assembled and correct installed
AO> machinecode. This machinecode should be able to call another machinecode,
AO> where I want to manipulate music or bob banks which I use in the above 
AO>     !!main!! - program. 

The A5 register holds the base address of the AMOS data base. Using the
offsets described in the AMOS-includes you can access all banks etc.

AO> 2.) How does the Pload and the Call- command from Amos work.

Pload loads the executable asm file into memory, cuts off the header bit
and that's it. No relocation is done.

Call jumps to the address supplied and the code has to preserve the
A3-A6/D6/D7 registers and has to quit with RTS.

AO>     Can I get the sourcecode from somewhere? This would be very usefull and
AO> very helpfull to me, because I would not need to debug tghe Amos.Lib

No. No source code available, but you could have a look at the extension
source code and includes.

For Procedure-in-line asm code have a look at this example:

You want a procedure that does this:

Procedure WRITECLI[st$]

End Proc

Now your asm procedure has to look like this:

	movem.l a4-a6/d6/d7,-(sp)
	move.l  DosBase(a5),a6
	jsr     _LVOOutput(a6)
	move.l  d0,d1
	move.l  (a3)+,a0        ; This the parameter st$
	move.w  (a0)+,d3        ; A string contains the word-length
	ext.l   d3
	move.l  a0,d2           ; And then the string itself.
	jsr     _LVOWrite(a6)
	movem.l (sp)+,a4-a6/d6/d7
	rts

Note that parameters on -(a3) are in reverse order.

To include the asm file you simply have to assemble the source, place the
cursor between the Procedure and the End Proc-line and then select "Insert
Program" from the menu. You now can call your routine just with:

WRITECLI["foo bar"]

However, I encountered some problems with multiple asm procedures... there
might be some bugs when using more than one asm-procedure.

AO> 3.) Are there any information about the connections from the Areg(5) in the 
AO>     Internet, i mean, with an useful description.

Well, with a little bit french and some fantasy you'll find out the
meanings of the variables yourself ;-) I'm afraid there are no docs
whatsoever ;-(

Here's a new AMCAF registration form. I would appreciate if you and users
that have already registered AMCAF could send me these in :-)

How to register AMCAF

If you enjoyed the demo version, you can get the fully registered version
for only $25 or 30 DM. Just fill out the registration form below and send
it to me either via e-mail or snail-mail. The registered version or the
keyfile will be sent to you within two weeks.

I'll send it via snail mail as fast as possible. No extra money required
;-)

What about uuencoded or mime files? The keyfile required for the full

I heard the registered version of Turbo is much better and won't crash

TOME by Aaron Fothergill is only available for Creator. However, some
years (?) ago, I resourced the TOME extension and made a TOME Pro out of
it. It is available directly from me for free if you got the original TOME
IV Creator pack and can verify this (e.g via manual copy protection hehe
;-) )

JW>  I just bought Ultimate AMOS are thier any other books I should get?

It depends. I would recommend you the 'Game Makers Manual' by Stephen Hill
if you are not already an AMOS-ace ;-)

JW>  And last but not least should I delay CommBatt just a little longer and
JW> Include 64 color Raytraced graphics?

Your decision ;-) I would appreciate that ;-)

The AMCAF Disk State() function returns the state of a device (i.e write
protection and in-use state). It does not however catch the no disk in
drive requester. So something like this is required for getting the
correct state ;-)

Request Off
Trap FLAGS=Disk State("PROGDIR:")

Has anyone bought the AMOS PD CD #2?  I have #1 so I am wondering about the

I think it was the Amos Editor you can`t distribute but its safe to copy the 
library, its pretty useless
by itself anyway and Europress aren`t going to compain are they (since 
they`ve lost interest

Have you tried the debugger included with BarFly?  It works
fine on a 68060, so I guess it`ll work on a `040 too :-)

n case people are looking for the OS3.x include, fd, etc. files, they are

Also, I am writing a small program that I want to always stay on top of
any screens or windows that the user has open.  Can this be done on the
AMiga?  It is similar to the Microsoft Office Toolbars where you have icons
that you can click on to launch programs, but it is always on top of
whatever screen is open.

Thanks.  Source in asm, c, AMOS, Blitz, whatever.

Has anyone else had problems when PowerPacking an AmosPro compiled

I have tried many different compression ratios and decomp flash settings,

I can't say I've ever had that problem.  Make sure you don't use the AMOS 
squasher and then Powerpacker because that could be nasty.  Why don't you 
use either Stonecracker or Crunchmania?  They're much better than 
Powerpacker and they're free!

AMCAF V1.40 has got a rgb=Ham Point(x,y) command. The documentation still
has to be updated, but the release should be within 3-4 weeks.

The anim2bob.lzh is on the AmiNet CD 8.

DL> If so how?

===========================================================================

Your command 'HELP FREEBIES' created the following output:

This is how to order your free Aminet CD 7:


1. Unless you have special permission (see below), you first have to
   get the file docs/lists/Aminet-CD-7.lha from Aminet (that's the
   index of Aminet CD 7). Find your software in that list. Note down 
   the name of your software on the CD (which might be different from 
   its name on Aminet). Almost everything uploaded between 18-Apr-95
   and 26-Jun-95 should be in that list. If none of your software is
   in that index, then, sorry, no free CD.


2. Send a freebie request mail to aminet-server@wuarchive.wustl.edu 
   similar to the one below (don't send CUT HERE lines). Example:

-------------------------------CUT HERE---------------------------------
FREEBIE
CD: 7
File: biz/dbase/Aminet4Patch.lha
Address:
Urban Mueller
Schulhausstrasse 83
6312 Steinhausen
SWITZERLAND

-------------------------------CUT HERE---------------------------------

   Important notes: 

   * FREEBIE must be the first word in the body of the mail
   * CD number must be 7, no freebies for older CDs
   * File must be FULL PATH as found on the Aminet CD 7 index
   * THE FILE NAME MUST BE THE NAME ON CD, NOT THE NAME ON AMINET!
   * The Address: keyword must be the only word on that line
   * LAST LINE OF THE ADDRESS MUST BE THE COUNTRY NAME! MANDATORY!
   * No blank lines within the request or the address
   * THERE MUST BE A BLANK LINE AFTER THE LAST LINE OF THE ADDRESS!
   * Only one freebie per file and per author
   * No freebies for uploaders, sorry

   You can replace File: <filename> by Special: <explanation> if you
   have been authorized by me to do so. The rest of the request mail
   remains. Example:
   Special: Mirror admin of ftp.uni-paderborn.de


3. Wait for a confirmation from the server. If you don't get a 
   confirmation within a day or two, submit your request once more.
   If that again produces no result, contact umueller@aminet.org


4. Wait for the CD to arrive. It will be shipped anywhere in the world
   for free. We however reserve the right to refuse the free CD in
   special cases (e.g. obvious abuse).

===========================================================================

This way I got my freebie CD 8 ;-)

I'm sure it's possible, even if you can't get the variables-names back.
However, I don't have the time to do an AMOS resourcer ;-)

Long time ago, I wrote a program to rip amos banks from the source. It's
old, it's ugly, but it works ;-)

Use "Spack screenno To bankno" for whole screens. Pack only packs a part
of a screen without screen information and palette.

JB> How to Create and Edit Message and Icon banks.

For Icon banks just use the erm... icon bank editor (?) or the sprite
editor (then just swap bank 1,2) or just grab them using Get Icon. ;-)

Hi !

As my last message seemed to be lost in nature, I send it again...

Well, recently I checked out a game called Desert Apache (coded in AMOS 
by Dark Unicorn), which is a FMV copters fight, rather impressive.

In fact, the coder uses a 2x2 pixels asm routine, that doubles the size of 
pixels (this effect is seen in many recent demos,for displaying long anims)

As I made some Scenery Animator anims, I would like to reduce them to a 
quarter of the screen, and then display them in full screen with a 2x2 
routine (I'd lost a bit of resolution, but gain much memory).

So, did someone coded such a routine, in highly optimized asm code ?

If yes, could you send it to me, please ?

Thanks in advance ! Bye !

I have some questions to you, the old, the wise, and the 
productive ones. Just like someone wrote recently, I am 
also one of those people who owns AMOS for a few years, but 
who hasn't done much with it. Well, actually I have done a 
lot of programming in AMOS, but none of my work is finished. 
Am I a slacker ? I guess I am (was).

Anyway, I have some questions. The first is probably a very 
stupid question, but you will let know, won't you ? I've read 
some messages and docs stating something about AMOS 2. Is it 
true that AMOS has evolved ? What is it (compiler + interpreter)?
What does it cost? How do I get it?

Another question: I'm interested in sprite and bob banks in 
the PD. Are there little Lemming-like soldiers / people in 
the PD that I can use, or do I have to force my brother to 
draw some? Where can I get my hands on them, how much...etc.

Final question. Has anyone in ANY programming-language made 
a game / simulation which looks like Civilization (either 
the Microprose or the Avalon-Hill version). Don't refer to 
Colonization. I'm asking this because I think that Civ. sucks 
the way it is as it is. So I'm working on a multi-player version 
which is more challenging and more realistic. But if someone 
else has made something similar, please let me know. If not, 
I could use some help: I'm looking for national anthem-like 
music, small bobs, nice requesters and above all historic 
information.

Once again, I apologize, this time for the length.

P.S. I now own AMOS Pro 1.12 (don't laugh), so that's why I'm
asking.

  Now to the question, want to be able to read the .info files to check
  a) what type of file it is and b) any tooltypes that are included and if
  at all possible c) read the image file including number of planes, 
  colours(?) so that it can be redisplayed on an AMOS screen.

  BTW INTOS what do you think?  I thought that this was an extension?
  Not so, it's a .Lib file and procedures.

  Lastly does anybody have a contact address for the guy who wrote the 
  power procedures?  If you do can you pass it on as I would like to get
  in touch with him.

  PS.  Steve form F1 could you please email me details of F1's compiler
  deal, what it includes, price etc.  Thanx.

NTSC games will run slower on PAL machines and yes, the bottom of the

PAL users won't bitch so much.

There was some discussion about interface issues on comp.sys.be where 
this came up. Apparently, clocks that stay on the front most screen work 
this way. I guess it should be programmed as a commodity to catch all 
click-to-front/back commands. 
I suggest you look on Aminet in the utils drawer for sources of progs 
that do the same.

Reading filetype and tooltypes shouldn't be that hard. Unfortunately (for 
you :-) ), I haven't got my "Libraries and Devices" here at work, so I 
cannot answer where to find them exactly.
The image is a bit harder, as it isn't a standard IFF-ILBM type file.

If I figured out right how it works, it isn't even that. It seems to be a 
standalone program disguised as a library, that you feed commands as 
paramaters.

If everything else fails, try asking postmaster@amiga.de for the address 
of your nearest repair centre. In theory you should be able to go to an 
Escom store and ask for help there, in practice everyone working at Escom 
shops are morons. Nevertheless, you could try :-).

If there are any Dutch who have got Amiga stuff that needs repairing, a 
press release on the Dutch Escom homepages says that Commodore has closed 
a deal with Computer Repair Schoonbrood in Simpelveld. You could bring 
any broken Amigas to the nearest Amiga dealer (no Escom shops) or send 
them to Simpelveld. No address or telephonenumber was given.
For those who don't know: Commodore B.V. is a subsidiary of Escom who 
produce PCs and peripherals (or more like relabel them), but who also 
handle the distribution of Amigas in the Netherlands.

Yes.  They include the copyright notice with it.  It says you can copy them
as long as you only copy them from the CD.  Strange but true.

I agree with this.  It uses EXEC to run it with parameters.  Sounds like
pretty false advertising as an extension.  At least in the way AMOS defines
an extension.

I have the AMOS PD CD and there are lots of sprite banks on that.  I could
try to compile them all but it would be a huge file and I don't have much
time to search each one.  If you know of one in particular, I can check it
out.

Unfortunate Post To: comp.sys.amiga.misc & comp.sys.amiga.programmer
What Will Nervous Software Be?
Nervous Software will be a group of people (myself included) who are
programming small/big freeware games/utilities At Current there is one
member - me :o(  If you think you would like to become a member please read
on...
What Does Nervous Software Need?
Nervous Software requires another programmer, 2 graphics artists, 2 music
programmers. This will be a FREEWARE group so there is NO profit envolved.
This group will be used to produce software for everyone. That is OS2+  :o)
What Do I Need To Become A Memeber Of Nervous Software?
To Become A member of Nervous Software You Must Either Be Able To Make;
graphics (anims, 3D, Or Anything like that), music (Soundtracker or IFF
sound files), Programmer (Amos Only!)
Anything from the above will do, and members will be chosen on a first come
first served basis.
Why Program In Only Amos?
The Only Amos Bit Is There As A Saftey Barrier And To Make Games That Little
More Easier To Program. The Saftey Barrier Bit Is A Load Of Codswallop :o) I
just wrote it there cos I wanted to :o) It is no secret that Amos is a very
easy to use language and is vastly expandable. Not only this it makes sure
that people program for OS2 as well as OS3.

Yes I have the equates system working (in AMos Pro right?)

I can call an equate just like this...

result=Doscall(Lvo("SetComment"))

This seems to work fine....
if you are using an earlier version of Amos Pro (less than 2.0) then you 
must use Set Equate Bank in your program.

I hope that is what you wanted to know.

I think that's pretty unfair.  So what if it isn't a proper extension?  
It does its job, which is to provide intuition features, so why 
complain?  The advantage of not being a proper extension is that it 
doesn't take up a slot number in the extension list.

Your right, it can be called an extension, as it provides an extension to 
the language, even if it is in a non-standard way. But it has one big 
disadvantage, and that is that you have to make sure that anyone using 
your program also has the extra 'library', which is hardly user friendly.

But most programs these days require externals libraries anyway.  Lots of 
programs require reqtools.library for instanc.  Even commercial companies 
have their own libraries which need to be installed.  It's not a big 
problem, you just need a user-friendly installation program.

Speaking of installation program, has anyone written one that will modify
the Loaded Extensions?  I assume you could launch it from the Installer
script.  I was looking at TOME trying to figure out how it does it.  BTW, I
tried Chris' AMOSProTOME Update and it works great.  I don't do much with
mapping but in case others were wanting to get TOME for Pro, you can!

Is TOME a map-editor by any chance?  I've not really seen anybody elses 
map editors and such like because I usually write my own, but is it any 
good?  Is it PD and where can I get it from?  I'm curious to see what it 
looks like.

I don't know.  It just works.  I can call the Lvo function just fine and 
it seems to work.  I don't know what's going wrong with your copy of Amos 
Pro.

Please tell me exactly what happens, with error messages and stuff.

Yes, TOME is, apparently, *the* map editor for AMOS.  It can be used for
other platforms, it says (if you can translate the files).  It is pretty
good.  To be honest, I don't use it (so I sold it).  When I did use it, it
was pretty simple.  As usual the hardest part is making the graphics!

It is not PD.  It was/is available from the AMOS UK Club.  I guess I could
upload a game from one of it's examples, compiled of course, as a demo.

    I am programming a game much like Colonial Conquest but also 
borrows bits from UFO : Enemy Unknown and Civilization.  It's not 
very historic but I may be able to help anyway.  Look on the Aminet 
for music and I might be able to find bobs etc.  Let me know exactly

There are public domain amos banks, they're just hard to find.  I used to

Yes amos has evolved past Pro 1.12.  As a matter of fact, I had creator, 
and when I got AP1.12, I used it for about ten minuted and then erased 
the disks.  AP2.00, now there's a good version.

    It comes up with (something like!) Equates file not found.  This 
is a lie, however, because I have used SnoopDOS and AMOSPro finds the 
correct file and opens it.  I don't know why it don't work :(

Tome is a map editor. I believe it is shareware is is compatible with 
Classic Amos (not sure
about Pro). Try F1 Licenseware for a copy.

Well, I looked it up. The format in which the .info files are stored on 
disk are much like, but unfortunately not entirely the same as the format 
in which they are loaded into memory. The RKRM L&D doesn't list the 
file format. The OS has functions (GetIcon and PutIcon if I remember 
correctly) that does the conversion for you. That pretty much rules out 
making a small hack that bypasses standard system libraries.
 
AmosPro will allow you to load system libraries and use their functions. 
It seems, however, that those who bought the FULL VERSION on coverdisk 
didn't get the full version after all -a trick that British mags seem to 
use a lot. Apparently Amos Pro needs something called the 'equates file'. 
Let me know if your version of Pro is complete and I may send you the 
necessary information after all.

Are you sure it finds the file? It gives the same error with me, but 
mentions it needs something like the productivities(?) disk, which I 
don't have. (See "Re: .info" for how I found out).

AMOS2 was the name that the magazines assigned AMOSPro, before AMOSPro was
released... So no, we're stuck with what we've got... However, updating to
AMOSPro 2,00 might do you some good!

Info files consist of few parts. First of them is DIsk-Object-Structure, and
it holds some general informations. The most important bytes are:

offset	bytes	name		what is it?
-------------------------------------------
0	2	do_Magic	it's always $e310.
16	2	gg_Flags	how icon changes when clicked
48	1	do_Type		type of icon (disk, tool, drawer etc.)
50	4	do_DefTool	pointer to DefaultToolStructure
54	4	do_ToolTypes	pointer to ToolTypesStructure
74	4	do_StackSize	size of the stack.

do_StackSize is the end of this structure.

If info is drawer or disk type, next comes Drawer-Structure, 56 bytes long
which holds informations on window that opens after clicking on icon.


Next is Image-Structure:
offset	bytes	name		what...
--------------------------------------
0	2	im_LeftEdge	left edge of image
2	2	im_TopEdge	top
4	2	im_Width	width of image (in pixels)
6	2	im_Height	height of image
8	2	im_Depth	number of bitplanes
10	4	im_ImageData	pointer to first bitplane of image
14	1	im_PlanePick	which of bitplanes are used to
				make the image (eg. if 1st and 2nd bitplane,
				PlanePick = 3).
15	1	im_PlaneOnOff	?
16	4	im_NextImage	pointer to second image (if used)
------------ end -----

Now comes data of image (normal, not packed bitplanes).

Next is DefaultTool Structure:

char_num	4 bytes		number of chars 
chars		  ??		string of chars          
char_end	1 byte		0

And, finally, ToolTypes:

string_num	4 bytes		(number of strings +1)*4
				for instance, if in ToolTypes there's
				only one line of text, string_num=(1+1)*4=8
string 1	?		first line of tooltypes
string1end	1		zero byte
string 2	?		second line
string2end	1		zero byte
    . 		.		.
    .		.		.
string n	?		n-th line of tooltypes
stringnend	1		zero byte
 
and that's all about .info files. 

If you want more informations, please contact me.

 I was wondering :

1) Is it possible to use the old-Amos compiler to compile
   Amos Pro programs by adding some libs to it.

2) What's the main difference between Amos Pro 1.12 and 2.0
   I am still working with 1.12 , do I miss  lot ?

3) Isn't it possible to create a fonts-list without using the
   get disc fonts command. I find it rather slow when used in 
   conjunction with a floppydrive.

4) The fonts-accessory delivered with Amos Pro can it read all graphic fonts ?
   I don't succeed in loading some huge fonts !!!

5) Is it possible to create an edit zone larger than one line, like the
   editor for instance. ( Using Amos Interface Language ?)

Not really - it mean mainly changes for the AmosPro compiler to work.

The is a wonderful program called cachefont that allows you do get over 400
disc fonts in 1-2 seconds! Basically, you run a program makefontlist each
time you add a font to the system, and run cachefont from your startup-sequence.
It then patches the availfonts system call to use the prebuilt list. This means you
get fast font lists for all applications, not just AMOS.

I think as long as you do not have any AMOS Pro commands (Equates, etc.).

> 2) What's the main difference between Amos Pro 1.12 and 2.0

I think v1.12 is rather buggy.  I can't say what, though, as I never had
to use it.  But, when Francois and I were keeping each other up to date on
AMOS Pro, he said to stay away from it.

    I was thinking about writing a program which needed the icon of a 
program to be displayed on the screen and, so got the Amiga autodocs 
type books out the library and it has the icon file format in there.  
I'll send it as soon as I have read it myself!  But if anyone has 
AMOS source for it already, please sent it me to save me the hassle!

Oh for goodness sake! Does it matter! The AMIGA relies on people having
extra libaries, but we don't complain about that! Where can I get this file
by the way?

Hi Dudes,

Re the messages about using TOME ... why would anyone want to use it when you

     According to the AmosPro help latest news/ you can use
     the old compiler with amospro to compile programs, but 
     they have to be 1.3 compatible.  I got the old compiler
      to work w amospro once, now it never work anymore :(
      and I followed all instructions and yes I didnot get
     amospro on coverdisk, i bought original.

      I think AMCAF can do that, I still didn't check it but
     heard good things about its font commands. You might want to
    take a look at it.

Subject: Animation, CD32 joypad
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Ok.  I've finished the double buffered sample routines, and complete
handing of a CD32 joypad, but I'm still fighting with animation
routines.

Whats with the iff anim commands anyway ?  Does anyone know why they
are so nasty ?  Does anyone know why none of my anims work, no matter
which way I pre-process them before using frame play commands ?  I've
tried changing resolutions, locking palettes, different screen sizes,
and the built in routines just corrupt the anims, and often crash the
machines.

Oh well.  A few more days of fighting and I should be doing stuff
straight from disk, even if I have to compress the anims.

What do you prefer, full screen running a tad slowly, or stuff at full
speed on a smaller screen ?  Yeah, I know, fast, and full screen.

Please let me know.  Also let me know of any working anim formats you
have, or failing that, any NON-working anim formats, so I don't 
duplicate :-)  ..and as much as I'd like to do AGA, I'd like to keep
it compatable with my other amigas, and not just the CD32.

I'd also be interestred in any copper routines you have out there..

AGA or not AGA..?  Using ImageFX to cheat a little or not ?
Compressed or quick ?  All suggestions gratefully appreciated.
I *NEED* these routines !!  ANY ideas would help.

True, but everyone has preferences.  There is a new editor called GRIME.
Looks decent, too.

BTW, what does CRAFT II have that is in common with TOME?

No, I don't think so, and I think you'll find that the AMOSPro compiler is
worth it anyway, as it's much neater, and the compiled programs run faster!
I suppose if your program is 1,3 compatible (See the 1,3 Check option) then
it would work...!

Everything has been tidied up... In terms of commands, there's not a big
difference, but in terms of operation, V2,00 is a bit more reliable.

Again, don't think so... You could use the cachefont program (AMINET) which
will speed up the operation. I suppose if you wanted to get in deep enough,
you could emulate the cachefont program from with AMOS, but I really don't
think it's worth the hassle!

Not used it, so can't help you there! Sorry!

Again, don't think so. You'd have to either string a few lines togerther, or
create a mini text processor.. Look at the AMAL Editor for a few clues!

Good luck :-)

Well, if you're on a un*x machine, you just type...

uudecode "filename"

If you're on an AMIGA then you will need to find a suitable uudecode
program... I suppose there must be one on Aminet. Iff all else fails, send
it to me, I'll decode it, and send it back to you as an attachment to an email!

I recently downloaded Ben Wyatt's "Bounce" game from Aminet (game/jump I
think) and had to mention that I am totally impressed by it. Good graphics
and slick production make it pleasing to the eyes and ears. Several levels
ensure durable playability.

This is the kind of game that would have sold for a chunk of cash not so
long ago, a very professional presentation.

The object is to maneuver a bouncing ball with an assortment of cute faces
through a series of scrolling levels past a gauntlets of spikes and nintendo
style baddies to the exit. So far I have made it to level 4.

The only problems are the occasion glitch (probably due to Amos) where the
ball goes through solid walls and the slightly awkward "Please Wait" screen
between levels which could easily be replaced by music and a simple 
animation.

All in all a strictly solid effort that rates 9 out of 10 bananas on my
"Are You Game?" PD/Shareware scale. Well done Ben!

I've only written the editor so far...I'm going to finish the engine by

Cheers!

I've tried to fix the ball going through walls problem but I simply
couldn't follow my programming. The game is about 3 years old and
was written at a "learning AMOS" stage, so it's filled with terrible
programming and no comments. :-(

Thanks for the comments!

Michele,

I don't know if you know this but there is a review of your amos shoot-em-
up Fantasy on an old issue of Amiga Report, #2.29 if you would like to
check it out.

I get there through http://www.omnipresence.com

You could also try:

ftp.netnet.net /pub/aminet/util/arc? or arch? you'd see it when you get 
there?  There are heaps of UUdecodes and UUencoders in there?

No. But I don't use Powerpacker anymore, because IMHO it's crap ;-)

Which version of Powerpacker do you use? there once was an early beta
version floating around, which was obviously very buggy ;-)

The problem with AMOS compiled programs is: They don't use /any/
relocation information. Francois searches through the seg-list to find all
the associated datas and banks...

If PowerPacker disorders these hunks just a little, the program will fail.

Use CrunchMania or similar instead ;-)

Warning: CrunchMania will not decrunch executables correctly on MC68060
machines with enabled CopyBack...

The AMCAF installing program does automatically add the AMOSPro_AMCAF.Lib

I can send you the source code of it... actually, it has been ripped from
the interpreter-setup program and modified a bit.

Some other people did not have the same success, as there are so many
different versions of Tome floating around.

Probably I will be writing a new updating program, which will be much
smaller and include a manual protection check ;-)

Doubt it.  Someone else may know better though.

Not a lot.  I think v2.00 was "re-written" in some ways to make it 
more flexible for adding extra bits to Amos.  In the Help it says 
it's just to make it easier to add things like the compiler "and 
AGA/Intuition support" for the future.  Hohum.  Don't think there's 
all that much else different really.

Not without using an extension.  I think AMCAF has a command where 
you can specify something like GET FONT "Topax",12 or something 
similar.

How big are they?

Don't think so.  Not with the EDit Zones, anyway.  I don't think 
there are any commands in Amos for doing that very easily.  You'd 
have to write a routine, probably without Interface.  :-(

I can also get it to work. I'll try and find some of my old programs that
use it and post them to the list. Don't worry, they are small, about 10 or
so lines. 
     I write all my programs this small, so that when I want to write a big
program I can just load them in, change them slightly, call them a
procedure, and finish quickly.

Along the same lines, I've never been able to get the mouth command to work
correctly. Has anyone else?

For more than a year, on and off, I've been working on a Pirates style
RPG. It's still deep in the beta stages but the scrolling map with first
continent are completed. It's a big ole map. Also there are misc knick
knacks completed and it's progressed far enough that you can get an idea
where the game is going.

But my artwork is a little weak. If there is anyone who fancies improving
on the rough drafts of sailboats and maps that I have, just for the fun of
it I'd like to get the source, iff's, and etc to you. It's unlikely that 
this project will ever be marketed but if it is of course you would get
credit and cash for your help.

Let me know, then, through email or the list. Thanks!

If you are still on the list, I've 90% finished a game, but it uses one of

the formulas that will give me the x and y coordinates of an object at time T
given the intial velocity and angle that it was fired at? I took this in high
school but I can't remember them, oh yeah also taking into account gravity
of course!

Any help would be really appreciated, and if I ever finish the game, you would

Just a tip: you don't have to preserve a4-a6/d6/d7 registers...

x=vx*t=v0*cos(a)*t
y=vy*t-0.5*g*t^2=v0*sin(a)*t-0.5*g*t^2

where:
v0 = velocity
vx = x velocity (=v0*cos(a))
vy = y velocity (=v0*sin(a))
a  = angle
t  = time in seconds
g  = gravity 9.81 m/s^2

Mind you, you can optimize these calculations a lot...

Your right, it doesnt like stereo wav files. There is a wav datatype, so

An image struct in a gadget struct, I believe.

You can actually rate the games that you dl from Aminet. I don't know 
exactly how or to what purpose, but I guess information about it can be 
found on Aminet itself.

Ok.I recived only one reply , so i think you are not intrested in INTOS...
and you're right because: (read below)

First: i would like to start with the final rate:  sufficient!
Now let me tell.

Amiga Magazine Italia reviewed Intos this month. Article starts 
explaining what is Intos. Intos is not an extension like promised but a 
set of procedures. Alt. These procedure are noy like Amtuition procs that 
emulate Intuition on an Amos screen.Intos Procedures really open 
intuition screen and windows. Interesting? No, because every Intos 
procedures (corresponding to a particular command such as Open Window and 
so on) is executed by a small program distribuited with Intos. It is 
called Intos.CustLib and it takes place in the APSystem folder. This is 
like a "pre-processor" for Intos procedures. 
And now problems are coming. Intos has been tested on 
A500/A2000/A3000/A1200. No problems with AGA machines and A500/2000. With 
the A3000 Intos refused to work! 
However, you can use Intos in your programs but you can't distribuite it 
because it needs Intos.CustLib and this is copyrighted. Article finished 
telling that "Intos could be a great program to make Amos Intuition 
compatible, but, due to its problems, Intos is simply a software to make 
a little longer the Amos falling".

I don't agree with them. We have more and powerfull extensions than BB. 
If we want to use Intuition we have Andy's great Intuition extension and 
for the future hopefully the OS-DevKit extension. We have Paul's Easylife 
and Chris' AMCAF too. Why we need Intos?

Bye...

I'm not sure, but you want to display sprites on your custom
copperlist, right?

That is possible but you have to do everything by yourself, coz Amos
can't do the job for you if your use a custom copperlist.
First you have to set sprite pointers to your copperlist. They point
to the sprite data area where is a 2 bitplane image of the sprite and
some bytes of information (coordinates etc). Coz I haven't got my
Hardware manuals with me I can't tell your the exact structure of the
sprite data. Hmm,and don't forget to set the sprite DMA on in DMACON
(register $dff096)... Poke $dff096,$8020 will do it for you.

Hope this helped a bit.


Btw,
You can do smaller pixels using copper if you use more colors and arrange
the bitplanes like this (these values represent a pixel on screen)

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11...  61 62 63 (this is a one row of the display)
Now you just change the palette for each line of the display and WOW
you can have almost any size pixels on your screen. You can alter the
pixelsize ...for example if you like to use 4*4 pixels just arrange
the pixels like this

1111222233334444...
1111222233334444...
1111222233334444...
1111222233334444...

Now just change color palette for colors 0-63 in your copperlist. You have
to do this for EVERY pixel row in the screen.

Gee, this would be easier to do with 680x0 asm 8-)))

If anyone has Amiga Shopper #55, Id like to see what they say about
monitors.  Im in the market for a better on for my A1200.  Something that
supports all the modes and a small dot pitch.

Thanks.

I don't know if this is any help to you, but instead of using that 
formula you can use Sin() and Cos() to make the same movement. Something 
like:
X=Sin(D)*V
Y=Cos(D)*V
D is Degree And V is Velocity...

Yes, I'm running WB3.1 and AMOSPro.  No problems here.  Except with the 
EasyLife extension, but I think Paul is working on that.

Well, I'm not Chris and he will give you the right answer, but why not an

directory of AMCAF's installer. You can surely receive an email containing
it!

Sorry, but Manuel Andre is not on the list and he hasn't got neither an
email
address. BTW, it's turbo extension (version 1.19 available on Aminet) works
fine on my 1200. I'm also waiting to have more news about his extensions: I
got Powerbobs and I liked it, but the demo is not usable at all: al the
defaults produce a delay screen.

 j> Andy C. of Intuition Extension. Should I ignore Zipperware and buy the
 j> extension from you? Is the new version near release? Should I wait on
it

The new version of Andy's extension has been waited for a long time.
Unfortunately, it isn't ready yet: ehi, Andy, what are you waiting for??

BTW, you'll be able to have the upgrades even if you'll have to pay a
little
more fee. Is it right?

Bye.

Yes, 37 is os2, 39 is os3.0, and 40 is os3.1

Please let me know if you have WWW access.  Text or Graphical.  I am
working on a form for bug reports.  I figured this would be a quicker and
easier way than writing a program.

I hope it will assign numbers for quick searches.  Any PERL gurus out there
want to help?  I've not learned PERL yet, so I should.  If anyone wants to
help, let me know.

I figure we can also make forms for making a database of AMOS programs that
people post on AmiNet or wherever, but with more description.  Or, does
that just repeat Aminet's job?

There could be forms for AMCAF, Intuition, EasyLife, etc.

Since you did it, I'll do something like, even if probably is more related
to
Amos.

Amiga Shopper (probably #57) had a coverdisk with IntOS: has any of you got
it?  Please let me know.


P.S.: Hey Michael, could you send me the replies about monitors: I'm in the
same situation and I saved enough money to afford a new one.

That's true, but we have been waiting Andy's Intuition for a long and newer
versions seem not coming. :-(  It's buggy and it must be upgraded soon to
allow serious Intuition programs via Intuition.

And OS-Devkit?
We add a great demo on Internet, but where is it? Who is doing it? We don't
know the author: just the friend who uploaded it (Corinne). I sent emails
and
a letter, but I had not reply.

Luckly Easylife seems to be ok, but I want to show a pseudo-error: I
compiled
a program that uses it (the command to iconify Amos) and I gave it to a
friend; I forgot the Easylife.library and when he runned the program he add
an error displaying the string "Out of memory". It was strange, since he
has
got 6Mb of ram and so I tested the program for a lot of time looking for
bugs. AFter all, I realized that the problem was just a missing library.
Why
the Out of memory error??

And at last, AMCAF: this is really very good and it's often updated: thank
you Chris!!

But please, don't forget the Turbo extension: does anyone know about the
Turbo v2.0?? And I have to add the PowerBobs extensions: is it finished?

Bye

I got it to work last time I tried it (which was quite a while ago). How
do they not work? Have a look at the example with AMOSPro.

Along the same lines again, can anyone get the command Randomize to work?
If I set this to a particular value, Rnd() values are always random and
never the same (as they should be!). :-(

  I know, I know, I know...  The problem is that I can't debug it on the
Amiga (4000/68040) I currently have.  I'm working on a solution, and if I'm
lucky that problem will be nullified shortly, but that is the reason for
the current excessive delays.  (I'd have continued using my Amiga 2000, but
it shorted out, unfortunately.)  And, as much as I wish I could write
bug-free programs on the first try, such simply doesn't happen, especially
not with such a large piece of software (over 12,000 lines so far).

Okay... Let me remember..

A Particle, B
        X= X position
        Y= Y position
        A= Angle of Trajectory
        V= Initial Velocity
        G= Gravity (9,8 for now?)
        t= Time

So X....

        X=(V cos A)*t
        Y=(V sin A)*t - 1/2 * (g)(t)(t)

(From S=ut +1/2 at(t) )  (Sorry, I can't find squared!)

If you need any more equations, I'll try to remember them... I only finished
A-Level physics a few months ago, but I was trying to forget!!!

Yup, that is true, and you can cheat on the colours, by nicking them from
the workbench screen! My procedure is quite system friendly, except it only
works on wb3,0! (Sorry, I don't know the prefs structures for any other
workbench!)

  I know, I know, I know...  The problem is that I can't debug it on the
Amiga (4000/68040) I currently have.  I'm working on a solution, and if I'm
lucky that problem will be nullified shortly, but that is the reason for
the current excessive delays.  (I'd have continued using my Amiga 2000, but
it shorted out, unfortunately.)  And, as much as I wish I could write
bug-free programs on the first try, such simply doesn't happen, especially
not with such a large piece of software (over 12,000 lines so far).

Does anyone know of a preferably 'net available program that will
take different pictures and rewrite them into pictures with a common
palette?

On the same note (sort of) I recently came across a program on aminet
called ArtCoder.lha which allegedly will translate an iff picture into
a series of amos commands. Interesting, no? Haven't tried it yet...

When I open hires-laced screen (on KS 3.1) in Amos, this screen is
not laced even screen size OK.(but without laced lines)
When I'm saving this screen from direct mode and loading him to 
external (not Amos) viewer ... screen is still laced.
The same effect I have on A4000 and A3000 ..so IMHO its Amos problem.
I have Amos Pro v.2.0+compiler
On 1.3 an 2.0 KS .. all is OK with hires-laced mode.

I made my own animation system half year or so ago. It was written in 
asm. The asm part unpacked a frame directly into my copperscreen (3*3 
pixelsize, fullscreen, 4096 colors etc.)... 
It was pretty fast and had a sort of huffman compressing method (lha type)
so there was no delta encoding. 
Unfortunately I lost the source code due to hd crash lately 8-(

I did use it in my demo which was never officially released due to
many bugs, but I could send it to you (and some other people) if 
you would like to have a look at it. No promises it works on your system ;)
Oh, it needs AGA.

> I'd also be interestred in any copper routines you have out there..
Any?
Well I have some, what type of routines/copperlists are you looking for?

mystic@tlti.tokem.fi

PS: Would there be interest in some sort of CopperScreen extension which
    would build up a copperdisplay with customizable pixel size (3*2, 3*3,
    4*3, 4*4 etc.) with 4096 colors. This extension would be AGA only...

I would very much like to know more about these files,
1.  Because I want to write an icon-editor
2.  Because I want to write a program manager

But...
1.  I don't understand about "Pointers"
2.  How are the images stored

Basically, what I'm saying is "Can you give me a lot more info so that
I can  understand!"

Also, does anyone know how to:-
1.  Get the screenmode and palette prefs from wb
2.  Get WB icon tooltypes and args
3.  Get CLI arguments?
4.  Grab the WB screen from inside AMOS, like PPaint

Thanks very much,

I understand the Perl syntax is similar to C. If that is so, then I can 
at least help you looking for those horrible =/== errors :-).

Aminet does a great job at what it is. I have seen similar ftp-nets for 
Mac and PC, but none as good as Aminet.

Having said that, you cannot expect the Aminet administrators to make 
extensive descriptions of every file they get, or make easy-to-follow 
guides of where to find what. So, yes, it is a good idea to have separate 
databases for special interest groups -like Amos programmers. 

You can have several things:
-a review with every program in the database (even if the database 
actually consists of links to Aminet:dev/basic).
-a 'Where to find what'?

Any more, anyone?

      I got IntOs with the Amiga SHopper magazine, I thought it was great
because I wanted to have IntoS.  But I have not tried it yet as I don't 
have much free time, all I did was load it to take a look at it without
using it.  And now messages in the list virtually say all you need to kknow
about Intos, all I really wanted was to be able to display AGA screens in
AMOS (don't care about intuition<-me) and thanks to Steve Bye excellent 
article I found out that you can display AGA without Intos!!!!!

 PS: Steve Bye's article about display of AGA w/o intos is in the same

Any version of Deluxe Paint will do so.  Load the picture with the best 
palette. Grab a brush of part of it.  Now load one of the other 
pictures.  In the colour menu under palette, use brush palette then 
remap.  That will change your palette to what the brush (from the first

  2- do people really want aga games?
  3- I solved my problem with the keyboard (keys m, u, and j don't work) just
       by creating macros in amosPro, easy!!! now I just press ctrl-n and 
       is like pressing m.  Got to love amos!!!!
  4-   thanks to all that replied about uudecode, I found out my server
       has easy to use uudecode-encode command and I got it to work.
  5-  Does Amos3d extension supports texture on the 3 d objects, like
       having a 3d cube and I want it to be a dice, so I need everyside
       covered with 1 to 6 dots to represent the dice.

A-ha!  The old Randomize your Randoms problem :-)

What you need to do is call Rnd with a -ve number.

e.g.

For a=1 To 10
   Randomize 42
   For b=1 To 10
      Print Rnd(-100)
   Next b
Next a

Then you`ll get 10 random numbers, repeated 10 times.

If, on the other hand, you were to do this

For a=1 To 10
   Randomize 42
   For b=1 To 10
      Print Rnd(100)
   Next b
Next a

you`d get ten sets of totally different random numbers.


Regards
Chris

AMCAFs Bzoom routine is not 100% optimized, as it supports a lot of
different zooming factors (1*x,2*x,4*x,8*x), but it's still nearly as fast
as the original 2*2 routine.

ca> If yes, could you send it to me, please ?

If you haven't got the routine yet, I can send it to you, if you still
want it ;-)

Indeed it is possible to use the old compiler in conjunction with Amos
Pro, but it will only compile Amos Creator V1.34 compatible programs.

PA> 2) What's the main difference between Amos Pro 1.12 and 2.0
PA>    I am still working with 1.12 , do I miss  lot ?

No... AP20 is mainly a bug fixing update, but you miss a lot without the
compiler ;-)

PA> 3) Isn't it possible to create a fonts-list without using the
PA>    get disc fonts command. I find it rather slow when used in

Yes it is possible. Both the Easylife (?) and AMCAF extensions provide
commands for setting a font immediately if you know it's name and it's
size.

PA> 4) The fonts-accessory delivered with Amos Pro can it read all graphic fonts ?
PA>    I don't succeed in loading some huge fonts !!!

I haven't used the supplied accessories for a long time now, so I don't
exactly know what ya mean... the 8*8 font accessory will indeed only load
8*8 non proportional fonts...

KH> Whats with the iff anim commands anyway ?

- They don't support multiple palettes (this can be added with AMOS using
  some tricks)
- The buffer for a dlta frame is too small (about 40 KB), which will crash
  your machine with large HAM animations.
- The last frame cannot be replayed. Therefore you have to add
  'FORM'+Chr.l$(0)+'DLTA' at the end of your animation to get it working.
- They don't support other formats than anim5 (no anim7_16, anim7_32, or
  anim8 allowed)
- They don't support aga ;-)

KH> Does anyone know why none of my anims work, no matter
KH> which way I pre-process them before using frame play commands ?

Don't use Start(9) for your animation, but Start(9)+12. Enable Double
Buffering and set Autoback 0 after the first frame. Don't try to replay
the last frame unless you have followed the instructions above.

I have an A3000T with WB3.1 and interlaced AMOS Pro 1.12 definitely has 
problems. It may have been fixed in 2.0, but your message is the first 
I've ever read about it working properly. In any case, it's not AGA

Should be possible to write such a program using AMOS and AMCAF, with
commands such as Best Pen and Count Pixels.

I've tried that. Actually, you have to draw the picture with the
supplied art package and then that is converted to AMOS code. The
example graphics are actually quite good, but I couldn't get it to
do much. :-(

I need some help on scrolling dual playfield screens using screen offset.
The manual says that you should only scroll the front screen, but it seems 
possible to scroll the back screen as well, but when I try to scroll both
of them at the same time, they get out of sync and start to jump, first one
then the other, could I be programming this wrong, or is this just impossible
with Amos?

It probably wouldn't be that hard to make in amos.
Let me just check that what you mean is:
You have a picture with a certain palette
You also have a picture with the same kinda palette just mixed up a little.

All you would need to do is store the colors in a dimension, read the 
colors from the dest picture, and compare with the ones in the dimension, 
simple (i think)

Seeya later

Yes, v1.12 was a version that everyone should stay away from.  I had it for
about a day before Francois sent me the v2.0 saying to avoid 1.12.

Okay I saw in one of the procedure collections on Aminet a neat little trick
of giving a bob or icon a mask with other than colour 0, I don't suppose
anyone would have this procedure, or know how to do it?

I'd appreciate any help one could give.

Oh yeah, I posted earlier about scrolling dual playfield screens; about glitcheswhen both screens are scrolled with screen offset. I seem to have noticed it
only happens when either screen is on a 16 pixel boundry, what I have done to
solve this is just skip over a pixel when this happens, but does anybody know
why this happens, and if there's a better way to fix this?

   I Got your first message too.  I have a feeling the manual only says this 
because Francios couldn't figure out how to fix that 16 pixel boundary bug.
One of the help examples from Pro even scrolls both front and back screens 
(carefully avoiding hitting any 16 pixel boundaries)!  I "solved" it much 
like you by not offsetting one of the screens if it would land on a 16 pixel 
boundary (which is still slightly jerky).
   Quite a while back someone on this list mentioned having a "proper" 
solution, but not being able to release it for some (legal?) reason.  
Considering the state of AMOS, is it possible to release this info now?  
I'd still like a real solution, instead of just writing code to avoid the 
problem. :>

    WB 3.1!!) have problems with interlaced mode in amos pro programs
    On KS 1.3 and 2.0 all is ok so I mean its AMOS Pro problem.

If you send a message to the list, error messages are reported to you (and
me).  That way you can check to see if anyone important missed your
message.  If errors such as user unknown or host unknown appear, I delete
them, so it should not happen often unless you send a lot of messages
before I see the errors.

 JM> 2.  Get WB icon tooltypes and args

If I'm not wrong, you could read the tooltypes and args of the Amos

Amos.

Subject: changing the mouse pointer

O.K. I've made a mouse pointer using the proper rules (16 pixels across, 4
colours, etc), loaded it into the sprite bank, and done change mouse 4, now,
I get my pointer shape, but in those crappy yellowy colours that the bog
standard mouse pointer uses, and I want them to use the colours I designed it
in. How do I do this.... or more precisely, what am I doing wrong?

   You have to change the colors from 17 to 19 to the colors you used for
your sprite. That is, color 16 of the sprite will be transparent, color 17
will be the first color, 18 will be the second, and 19 will be the third

  Simple way is also load one screen to DPaint, press "j" to get
  second DP screen and load screen with another palette and now
  use restore palette from Colour/Palette->Restore menu to restore
  palette from first screen.
  
  Is also available usefull procedure to change,load and save palette
  in DP palette format from and to amos screen.

Regarding the program to matc



h palettes for a series of pictures:
 I don't think DPaints
 "use brush pallete" command will work. All that did
 was (if I recall) was set the current picture to the brush palette, screwing
 up the colours of the current picture. Amos Classic's "fade [screen] to 
 [screen] does the same thing. 

 I guess what I am seeking is an intelligent palette matcher which will match
 pictures without screwing up any colours. Thus you could cut and paste from
 different pictures (hopefully right up through HAM pictures) onto a common
 screen, something I've often wanted to do.

Regarding ArtPro.amos:

 It _does_ save iff images as amos code but you have to paint them with the
 supplied paint program. Be quite a trick if you could actually import iffs
 and save them to code! The sample pictures provided are quite nice and some
 of them appear to have been traced from digitized pictures. Classy program.
 We should get that guy on the list (if he's not here).

I hate doing this but the mailing list was so active that we had to move it
to a bigger and better machine.  The new machine is:

amos-list@conan.eds-ms.com

The old address (tarkan) will forward messages to conan so we should not
lose anything.  However, please point to conan as soon as you can.

Thanks and sorry for the inconvience.

Mouth as in the Amos pro command that goes with SAY?  There's a demo 
for it somewhere on the Amos pro disks.  Does that work for you?

Subject: FMV cartridge on CD32 control via AMOS Pro
Status: RO
X-Status: 


Could someone help me out with the following problems :


 -1-  In Amos Pro there is a command for opening libraries.
      How can you use this libraries, is there any information about
      the internal structure of these system libraries.
      
      I have seen some new extensions for amos pro. AMCAF makes it possible
      to load a font directly into memory without first getting a list
      of all the available fonts on the current master disc.
      
      I only need this facility in my current Amos program, and I don't need
      all the other functions of this extension , that's why I want to
      implement it myself.

      I want to load a font directly without using " Get Disc Fonts ".
      Is it possible to do this directly in Amos by using the command
      for opening a system library in combination with the DISKFONT.LIBRARY.

 -2-  I am trying to write an application especially for the CD32 console.
      Is it possible to control the Full Motion Video Cartridge from 
      Amos. If you have more information of the internal addresses the
      FMV cartridge uses please contact me.
      Maybe the cartridge can be controlled by AREXX protocol, like many
      genlocks do.

Someone was heard to explain to Daniel Miller:
 "Next timere, read the whole message."

I guess what I was hoping for was some program that would match the palettes
of a series of pictures democratically, without placing precedence on any
specific picture of the bunch.

With HAM's 4096 colours, you would have enough leeway that you could match
almost any series of pictures. But Amos Classic's support of HAM has been
a little iffy, with some artifacting. It would be nice if they fixed this
in Amos Pro, dunno yet.

Thanks to all who volunteered to help with the graphics for my Black Coast
Raider game. I intend to stick in every little contribution I can, and keep
developing the game until it is sickeningly complex and confusing.

As for the Parrot Island game wofuer ein Frank Otto uns eine Bewerbung gegeben
hat, habe ich nur ein Paar Fragen: Warum soll der Kerl gelb sein? Warum fast
kein NTSC support? Ausserdem ist das Spiel OK (aber die Musik ist wunderbar)
obwohl ich habe Probleme mit crashes beim untererden Wasser.

What else? ...has anyone heard if Amazing Amiga magazine will fold or are
they going strong. I need a subscription. And why are we (I?) getting all 
these blank messages from an address named joehick?

Doesn't the Instr() function do that? I.e. 
POS = Instr("This is a test","test")?

Haven't the foggiest, has I haven't got the compiler. I'll see what happens ifI
remove the library from the interpreted AMOS. The reason the library is always 
needed
is that each AMOS extension has an internal data area, and the main AMOS 
datastructure
contains a pointer to each.

Instead of having seperate areas for the extension commands and the library 
routines,
I simply use the library base as the pointer to easylife's data area, and 
store all data
in the library. This makes it easy for the extension and library routines to 
share
information.

I also acts as an advert when compiled programs are distributed :-)

I have no problems doing ANYTHING with Amos on any of my amigas.  3.1, 3.0,
or 1.3.  (The machine with 2.0 is softkicked to 3.0 :)

I tried to duplicate the error, and the only way I could was by spelling
laced wrongly.

How about:

A$="Wordtofind"
A=Len(A$)
B$="String to be searched for the word"
B=len(B$)-A
For C=1 To B
If Mid$(B$,C,A)=A$ Then Print "Found it"
Next C

You could use the string manipulation Upper$ to get rid of case sensitivity.

I suggest you look on aminet for my interactive iff game  "situp.lzh"
If you think that's the sort of playback you want, let me know.

Like I said, you have to use the new library for it to work.  Check out

The updater disk should have come with the compiler. That was the only
reason for the update, to get the compiler to work. Otherwise you do not
need it.

Why bother when there is an Instr$ command which is faster?

It isn't documented in the AMOS(Pro) manual, but to make use of the
seed you supply, you'll have to give a negative number with the Rnd
command. If you want to have a number of 0-50 generated with you seed
then use X=Rnd(-50).

So, well, I have to tell everybody that my Logo language is on Aminet in
the
directory dev/lang.

BTW, I'm going to release a newer version in the few next days (as soon as
wuarchive.wustl.edu is working again).

And for Paul: I used a command of Easylife extension: I didn't tell you
before since I forgot about it.

Do you really think that an external library is better? It makes harder the
installation and the distribution of software.

If your problem is to open the font, why don't you use Easylife extension:
it's available on Aminet in dev/amos. The only "problem" is that it needs

an
external library (Easylifelibrary) to work: it's in the archive but when
you
compile it you must put it with your own code.

Michael!

I`ve got your message - here`s your answer!

By the way, I`ve seen some "this is what I am working on in AMOS". Here is
my list

PBMFilofax v1.04
A program that will store all players, adresses of other managers, your own
printouts etc. etc. Works with SOCCER STAR Pbm only. Note: This is not a PBM
program, it just store all information from it.
Finished; Feb 1, latest

SoccerBoss v1.00
A soccer manager game. Lots of great features.
Finished; ??? Dec 1, 1996 ? I don`t know. This is a huge project.

PBMSoccer v1.00
I`ll transform SoccerBoss into a PBM game when I completed it (SB). Guess
this won`t be completed till next year.

AMOSBank Editor v1.00
A program that allows you to put together lots of ".abk" files into one
".abs" file. Not that a great program - I`ll probably never use it...but, if
anyone needs it - here it soon is...
Finished; will complete it after I have completed the filofax.

TextEditor v1.00
Won`t be great or anything - I`m doing this one just to test myself. It
looks good so far.
Finished; May 1 ??? Most likely, it won`t released though. There are far
better text editors on the market.


That`s it. Thank you
Sturla

Not really.. It gets the position. But i have already done a procedure doing
what I needed it to do for me.. For all of you who doesn't know what Word() is
I will write an example:

a = Word('Hallo there',2)

the string a will now consists of "there"

Knockout (game/2play/knockout.lha) and 3DPro (gfx/3d/3D_Pro.lha), he 
also got Knockout selected as 'PD Selection of the month' with the author 
of the review saying,
'It's played viewed from above, Micro Machines style, and strangely
reminds me of Demolition Derby on the Playstation.  Although

To all those who want to be able to use JD 4.6 with AMOS, but
without any _real_ Fast RAM:

First of all I do not have a hard drive so this description is
for an AMOS Pro bootdisk. (you should be able to use the same
princeples for hard drive use(?) )

1 - Get hold of a program called RunIt(*) and place it in your
    C: directory;
2 - Ensure that you also have AVAIL in the C: directory, this
    can be found on the Workbench disk;
3 - Add the following to the top of your StartUp-Sequence:

    Avail Fast >NIL:
    If Not Warn
        RunIt HalfFast NIL>:
    EndIf

4 - Save and then boot your disk.

If all has gone to plan you should notice that your machine
starts loading and then re-boots before loading fully.

I uses the above method on my machine A1200, 2Mb Chip, 0Mb Fast,
Amos Pro V1.12 (Upgraded from the AF's coverdisk version, meaning
I now have Equates stuff!) and all works fine.  [8-)

Hi all,

I have noticed recently that a few people being asked to upgrade a 
piece of software have replied by stating that it was coded way back as a 
'learning experience' and as it is complicated and uncommented (sin) it would 
be difficult to do so.  Therefor I will make an offer.  If you send me 
the code I will have a go at either, making the upgrade; or putting comments 
into the code (English only i'm afraid) and even restructure it to make it 
more readable.  If you wish to take up this offer E-Mail me by the end of 
January please as from March I will be trying to get my own projects 
finished.

On the subject of my projects, if there are any football (soccer) 
fans out there, who are willing to test one of programs please mail me 
with your setup details (as I wisj it to be tested on a wide range of 
machines).
It is not a game!  I will give more details to people who contact me.

Cheers,
Steve W

Hello,

I have a little question for the list:
is there anyone who knows if it's possible to delete a file from Aminet?

I want to upload a newer version of a program already present on it: what
should I do??

Thank you very much!
Bye

Well, I don't know if this problem can be the same I had some time ago.
I was using a painting program (but I can't remember its name) and when I
made an image I saved in Iff to import it in my own Amos program. But it

was
always corrupted. I didn't understand it, but if I loaded the same image
with
another paint program and then I over-saved it, the Amos could read it
well.

Probably, even if the Iff is a standard, some programs use not too standard
systems and Amos can't undderstand them, even if all the other programs do.

It's a possibility: check it.

Load your anim with another anim program and the save it again, withoun
changing it. Then try to load with Amos.

Bye

Well, the update is not just to allow the compiler since version 2.0 is

very
different from 1.12. I don't mean that it works in a different way (faster
or
more commands or less bugs...), but I want to say that the Amos code is
really very different. Try using Intuition extension with AmosPro 1.12: you
can't since a bug stops the loading routine.

	Hey,
		This is a great idea, thanks to all who ahve helped
	put it together!
	
	Now a question,  I own AMOS PRO and would like
	to use it to create simple 3D objects, such as cubes	
	bars, ect.  What I want to do with these is to port
	bitmaps of them over to DPaint for animations.
	I currently own Imagine 2.o and have been using it
	for this purpose, but it is a very slow process and
	a horrific under use of Imagin's power.  
	Does anyone know where I can get a copy of AMOS 3D
	or have any clue how to write the code for such
	simple 3D effects, perhaps some mathematical 
	models/formulas??? 
			Thanks, 
				Scott Matott sXe

If you upload a file with the same name, I think it just overwrites 
the old one.

It's nearly impossible to write bug free programs, especially for the
programs are getting bigger and bigger by the time. Although AMCAF
consists of nearly 17000 lines of source (320 KB), it's much easier to
debug it that it's the case with the intuition extension. Amcaf has a lot
of independant commands whereas with Intuition everything is knit together
tightly. Give Andy some time, please ;-)

They are the same out of a set of different random number series. To say
it in a different way. One special number generates a limited number of
different random number series ;-)

Nice idea, what do you want me to write? ;-)

JM> 1.  I don't understand about "Pointers"

Pointers are longwords, which contain addresses, which 'point' to another
memory area containing specific information.

JM> 2.  Get WB icon tooltypes and args

AMCAF has a Tool Types$ function. The args of a wb program (i.e optional
selected icons using the shift-key) can be read like cli args.

JM> 3.  Get CLI arguments?

Use the Command Line$ function of AMOS.

JM> 4.  Grab the WB screen from inside AMOS, like PPaint

Uh oh... not that easy and you won't get far without some knowledge of
intuition and structures, but it works by locking the public screen called
'Workbench', then getting the screen information about it, copying it's
contents to the AMOS screen (BltBitmapRastPort could work)...

Have a look at the autodocs ;-)

As it happens, it appears that the review copy he had was the oldest
version of Knockout available. It now has 7 players! (The next version
will almost certainly have 8, as well as a vechicle editor)

Well you can try to sort out Bounce (Quick advert: it's in game/jump,
dl it everyone! ;-) )... It needs a few bugs fixing, but they're nothing
major. I've just had a look at the source code and I have these warnings :

There is not a /single/ comment.

Variable/array/label names are mostly meaningless.

There are no blank lines, ie all the programming is in one massive block.

There are no procedures.

It is filled with Gotos and Gosubs.

The only way to figure out this game is to single step through it with
the monitor and try to see what changes have been made after each
line. Still want to try?

In the *.readme file, you can put a Replaces: thing, much like this :

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Short:    Knock each other off the circle! 1-7 players.
Author:   bwyatt@paston.co.uk (Ben Wyatt)
Uploader: bwyatt@paston.co.uk (Ben Wyatt)
Type:     game/2play
Replaces: Knockout.lha
Version:  1.02
----------------------------------------------------------------------

So if your program is called "File_v1.lha" and you want to replace it
by "File_v2.lha", you'd do:

Replaces: File_v1.lha

	Hye,
	oh that's Hey,
			From what I've seen so far most of the peole
	on this list are light years ahead of me, but I thought I
	I'd write in a bit of advice for those that aren't so far
	ahead.  
	Alright this was a life saver for me and I only discovered
	it by accident as the Amos MAnual gives this command really short 
	shrift.  
	At any rate, there's a command in Amos called Poin(x,y)
	which returns the colour number at point (x,y)
	At first glance, nothing bug right?  
	Yes, but this command is in fact the most useful command
	in all of AMos (at least as near as I can tell, I like I said	
	that isn't much) 
	For example, want to make reliable platforms?
		Screw monkeying with Zones or Collisoins
	do this, outline all of your platforms in one colour
	or reserve certain colours only for use on platforms
	Now as your little bob hops around the screen, 
	keep a constant check of what colour the pixels beneath him
	are (you really only need monitor the one directly below
	the center of your bob/sprite) To do this use the Point
	command, if Point returns the number of the colour outlining
	your platforms, the bob is on a platform, if not 
	well it's time to call your fall procedure.
	
	I've applied this same princible to at least a dozen other
	aplications (collision detect, zone detect, making walls,
	ect. ect.)  and the code is always a thousand times
	easier to write, (no need for level specific Zone definions,
	or lengthy collion detections) What's more I've found Point to 
	be much  more reliab
