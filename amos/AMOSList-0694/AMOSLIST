Just thought I'd mention that the format for the bank stored in RAM is 
AMOS Pro only - I have no idea how it's done in regular AMOS.  (I know 
that there is no pointer to the next bank, but other than that I *think* 
they are the same...)

The disk format is the same between both versions, though...

Probably the MAJOR bugs
Yes, PD

Quite possibly AMOS Pro on coverdisk, then AMOS Pro compiler on 
coverdisk, and then, eventually, source code PD for all to upgrade.

This is the current idea, anyway

  Wait... I must have read that wrong.  The AMOS Pro *source* in PD?  For
anyone to pick up, modify, and share around?  At the very least, he could
just get some*one* else to work on it - that way, at least, we have one
consistent version.  Releasing the source as PD would be disastrous - it
would kill AMOS.

I don't know about that.  I expect that I'd attempt to *coordinate* the 
work on it, most likely through an additional mailing list run from my 
gateway.  Well, if it did get out everywhere, you'd see some random hacks 
flying around, but nothing but concentrated coordinated efforts would get 
anywhere significant.  

Soundtracker took this route.  There are lots and lots of trackers now, 
but only one definitive one - Protracker.  Then there's Med which is 
another definitive branch.  The others follow a very distance 2nd.

I think a team working on AMOS pro through the net could come up with 
something excellent.  Manuel will be joining the internet again soon, 
btw, after TURBO PLUS hits the stands on CU.  So all the really good 
extension writers will be here.

We'd have Francois' input as well, although we'd have to fax him, call 
him, etc.  He's a helpful chap.

I'm actually looking forward to the possibility, because think of what we 
have now - NO updates and no possible way to update it ourselves.  Ok, 
the source is floating around.  Some people have a copy, I'm not saying who, 
but no one can do anything about it because its under copyright.  

I don't think it would kill it, maybe fragment it?  Maybe generate a lot 
more interest in it, too.

Hello:

I subscribed to the Amos-list quite awhile ago and I am wondering how I 
can view the list.  I recieved a few letters from DM Holloway the author 
of Amtuition but I lost his e-mail address.  I would like to contact him 
regarding some problems I am having using the extention.  Please send his 
address.  

If anyone is interested, I am finishing up a Japanese word processor 
written in Amos Pro v2.0.  I plan to release it into the Aminet archive 
in late August early September.  I still have a few bugs to work out with 
handling the some 6000 fonts the program uses.  The character input is 
also bugged so I've got some serious reconstruction to do before I 
release it.   Once finished the program will consist of a 
Japanese to English to Japanese dictionary with 60,000 plus entries. 
Online help screen.  The ability to combine English text with Japanese text.
The ability to save in JIS format, which is like saving text in ascii, 
for easy porting to other machines.  A character selection window.  And 
Japanese input via roman characters (romaji).   I have been working on it 
since December 1993 so, it has taken some time for me to get everything 
working right.  I am trying to use the Amtuition routines to set up a WB 
3.0 look and feel but, I am having trouble getting the screen right.  I 
will wait until everything is running smooth before I let anyone beside 
myself try it out. 

Help Mr. Holloway and help whoever with reading the list.


Thanks,

Christopher Fidel   tvmind@sfsu.edu

(I'm resending this, as I don't think it made it up to the list...)

Jedon,

If you want a fast 2D rotation routine (even in Uncompiled Amos) then talk
to Ryan Scott about getting a back issue #13 of Playfield!.  (Or Ryan, would
you mind if I post the Demo+Article here? (10k LHA file))

As for Rotating directly in the Bank, that wouldn't work so well as you'd be
rotating an already rotated image, and after a while your images would look
pretty ugly.  :)  But, rotating from the Bank to the Screen would work, as
the bank image wouldn't be touched.

Subject: Going on vacation
Status: RO

  I'm going on vacation for the next few weeks, so I won't be around to
answer questions, etc.  For those of you with the Intuition Extension, you
can still send comments, suggestions, etc. to this address.  I may be able
to check my mail once or twice.  (And if you haven't registered, well...
what's taking you so long? :-) )

	What you should do then (whoever was talking about bob rotation
directly into a bank) since re-rotation would make it messy, is have a source
bob and a destination bob as inputs to the routine.

Ok all you TURBO PLUS beta testers - do you have anything to tell me?

Is the current version so fantastic theres nothing to say?

I don't have the list of beta testers handy, so I wrote to the list.  I'm 
going to rewrite the list of beta testers, including only folks who reply 
to this message...   Reply only to me, not the list, please.

Ryan,

Thanks, but that doesn't have the article (which explains a lot more of the
logic behind the routines, and the Rotation Bank.  The code by itself also
doesn't say who wrote it. ;).  I've got the full LHA archive here, so I can
send it up if you don't have a problem with it.

I'm leaving the list.. :(
Although many uttered founded criitcism on AMOS, I still approve of the 
list and the program. We can't just sit and watch AMOS degenerate.
Francois! Do SOMETHING! I don't care what it is, even if it's only 
listening at my comments, but please, have another look at AMOS. You know 
you can ameliorate it. My fate is in your hands...
Well, so far for a sentimental touch to electronic mail.
Oh yes, I'm leaving the list. Because I can't read my mail anymore for 
the coming 3 months (this is a university node..). I'll surely be back in 
October (maybe September...;), and I hope the list will still be growing 
(at least exist).
And now for some ideas, questions and comments:
1) Using keys in Amal. It should be possible to read the keyboard in 
Amal, because for instance in a two player game, soem people prefer to 
play with the keys, instead of with the 2nd joystick.
2) Say I wrote something, planned for commercial release. Do I have to 
write to Europress, in order to let them know? Or doesn't anyone care 
anymore?
3) Adios, list.. I'll keep thinking of you when AMOS Pro decorates my 
monitor lens..
4) Oh yes. For all of you who plan to write anything. One of your first 
commands should be Led Off. That's so handy: when I'm supposed to study, 
and I'm fiddling with my compy, and my mum comes up, I don't  have to 
shut off my Power Supply, but only my Monitor, if the LED is off. Thanks 
in advance.

Subject: Multimeter
To: amos-list@access.digex.net
X-Mailer: LeeMail 1.2.4
Status: RO

Does anyone know how to interface a digital multimeter within amospro.

I have a Metex M-3650CR but I am unable to make it work with AmosPro.

The serial interface uses the signals:
        - TxD
        - RxD
        - RTS (Ready to send)
        - DTR (Data terminal ready)

The transmission uses 7 bits, 2 stop bits, no parity. For reading a value
on the multimeter the computer has to send the character "D".

Does anyone have an idea ? I never got an answer from the multimeter on Amos.

Thank you for any advice.

Yes.  But do you realise that my first name is Scott??  Or that I am from 
Australia too?  And that my last name is Southurst?  And that Paul is 
from Tasmania? 8)

And has anyone noticed how the "Prefs" on a power mac (YUK) are set up in 
the same way the WB3.0 (2.0?) is set up?  The only difference between a 
6100/60AV and an A500 WB1.2 is the inclusion of speech recognition, the 
bog slow performance, a few more colours, and the lack of a shell??  The 
ultro special program is the speech recognition which SUCKS!!  (Computer 
What day is it?  -> The time is ...  Computer Close window.  [Clipboard 
opens])
	The end result of this program is that someone who farts half a 
block away accidently formats your harddrive and someone has forked out 
$5500 for a piece of crap...

Nope.

Does it require a null-modem cable instead of a regular one?

I don't think they are compiled before run time.  Its not possible.
They are interpretted as far as I can tell.

Well, if you're using Amos 1.36+ it is fairly simple. You can use serial
open, close and all the other instructions. Check out docs for syntax of
all the  instructions. You'll find it on the  updater disk (or printed if you
bought comipler). 
Alternatively you can go through os. Save string containg D to drive
"ser:" using Amos's string functions but I never figured out how to get stuff
from "ser:")

As to DTR/RTS I don't think you have to worry about that as DTR goes high
if you switch you're amiga on (or when you open serial.device I can't
remember) and you're multimeter respond by setting TRS pin high.

If this multimeter requires aditional pins for flow control you may have
to use 7 wire mode when you open a serial device or make a little hack
box and connect some pins together.

Hope this helps

Maciek.

Dear Dominique,

I am sorry, but due to lack of time I did not reply before. 

I have two Metex meters at home, a M-4650CR and the newer M-3860CR (I think).
Interfacing was no problem at all, but I used ... HiSoft Basic. 
The reason was that HiSoft is almost MS-BASIC and I know how to use the 
serial port on a PC in this Basic. I haven't really looked at AMOS for this 
job, because I am still a little bit uncomfortable in this language. A lot 
works different than I am used in A&L Modula-2 or Turbo Pascal, which are 
the languages I know best.

When I am at home, I will look up my program and if I have the time I may 
even try it in AMOS just for fun.

BTW: if I may guess, your problem may be in the setting of the RTS control line.
This line is cunningly used by the METEX interface to power the optocoupler 
in the meter itself.

Regards,

Jan

Interpreted only to the point of when you do the "AMAL ON" command.  After that,
it is driven by an interrupt which executes 50(?) times per second.  Which is
why if you compiled a pure AMAL program, you probably would not see any increase
in speed.

Has anyone managed to create a decent interface with this yet? I can't!
Here are the main problems I have:

 - It is impossible to use sliders on a 4 colour screen, as you must use
   colours 0 & 4 for the background and slider bar, which are the same colour
   on a 4 colour screen. You really need to be able to change the colours
   of a slider - it should use the ink,paper,and outline colours for the
   slider button, background, and selected button respectivelty.

 - If you press a button, then move the mouse off the button before releasing
   the mouse button, the button's action should not be perfromed - I.E.
   It should be ignored. However I can't find a way to do this in the interface
   langauge either - what is needed is a function to return true if the mouse
   pointer is in the button zone which could then be called in the button
   change routine.

 - It should be possible to turn off the tab-to-next-string-gadget function - 
   I was halfway through writting a requester input handler which used tab
   like MUI to controll anytype of gadget by keyboard.

 - The idea of giving radio buttons the same button zone number works OK in the
   interface, but makes it impossible to modify them using the dialog update
   command, as any changes affect all buttons. There should also be a version
   of the dialog update command which takes a sub-zone number so an individual
   button may be affected.

I hope MCox/RScott are reading this, and will add this to the list of things
to be fixed in the next AMOS Pro update.



P.s. We haven't had a procedure library update for a while now - Have you all
stopped sending procedures? Why not send something to andrew church now.

Hi Paul,

> Has anyone managed to create a decent interface with this yet? I can't!

You could always try writing your own interface routines using zones etc.

I did.

Only problem is, it took 3 years, and I'm still working on it. :(

I just joined this list yesterday, so sorry if this is a repeat question...
Is there a way to open intuition screens with Amos Pro, sortof like the 
window example on the productivity disks (The procedure dir)?  I like 
Amos, but I need more support, and I don't like it taking over the view port.

PS.  Is there any site that has the lib to use external protocal librarys?
