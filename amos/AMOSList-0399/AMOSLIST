Wow, a challenge.  You've tried the obvious,  now it's time for the obscure
and devious..  For this, we need to access the amos variable table, which is
around somewhere..  I'm not one of those assembly guys with the source code,
but I'm sure it has to be possible.

Aha...  A solution comes to mind..  self modifying code !!  Is this gonna
need to work compiled, or not ??  If not, it will probably be a LOT easier.
We can easily get the address of the program, and write it in that way.
Perhaps we are using an accessory that modifies the code directly.  Perhaps
the amos code is called by an external routine that modifies a data file for
amos.  Maybe all the data is stored externally, and modified by a seperate
piece of code.  Perhaps we are directly accessing an external copy of the
variable table.  I can do it with memory banks, but that isn't sufficiant.
There is an extension available (can't remmeber of hand, probably easy life)
that uses variables set at the beginning of the code and can handle
structured variables stored in memory banks that it should be possible to
modify with the usual methods.

Hmmm.  Actually quite a difficult task you have here.  Do I remember
something on aminet that printed out your variables ?  Or was it extensions
?  Something like that.  Fascinating.

I know UAE works quite well. There's a program with it (or at least 
with the distribution I got) that lets you make a copy of the 
kickstart rom on your amiga, creating a .rom file.

http://home6.inet.tele.dk/aqvist/uae/ is a good source of files for the

Took awhile but I now have replaced the bad HD. Seems I had almost everything
backed up, but some things weren't..

Can someone send me the amos compiler again. Also is the Amos home page still
alive ? The page with the devpac source code ? I went to the search engines
and all ¦ could find was mushypd, (êy mushy you don't have the amos home page
as a link..

message from Andrew 'BadHart' Maughan:

 AM> Hey people...

No, sorry.

Anyway, who wants an IBM emulator?

I decided to make an amigagude file containing the Amos 3D commands and have
attached it to this email.  It is only 3k in size which makes it ok to post
it to the list.   The archive is packed using lha but I renamed it to zip as
some lha files get corrupt when emailed as attachments so rename the file to
Amos3D.lha if you are going to unpack it.  I also have a copy of the Object
Modeller and if anyone wants it email me privately.

Please note that I copied the commands from a magazine and do not know if
they are complete.  Enjoy......

Declan.

Ofcourse it is :).  The Amos home page?
There are many Amos homepages:
The one with the AMOS sourcecode: http://www.clickteam.com
The AMOS Factory: http://members.xoom.com/AmosFactory/front.hmtl

Subject: [amos-list] Off-topic: Using Zip drives as backup
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Rod Whiteley <rwhiteley@magnet.com.au>

G'Day All
    A recent HD Controller crash and subsequent tears :-( has made me rethink
my backup policy. Previously, using AmiBack 2.0i and AmiSched, I'd backed up
what I thought were the 'critical' files every night. Unfortunately, when it
came to the crunch (as it did) it turned out that a lot of the files I
thought weren't critical in fact were (like my AMCAF key, my AMOS extensions,
my internet dialup software, ... you get the idea). So I've decided I should
do the occasional COMPLETE backup (about 200 and something Mb and growing),
with daily backups of the changing, 'critical' files. The problem is that I
only seem to be able to use one zip catridge (about 100Mb or so). When this
disk fills, and I get a 'volume zip is full' message, and try to insert
another zip disk (same physical and logical device name) I'm not able to fool
the backup prog (be it my preferred AmiBack, or even Quarterback) into
continuing the backup onto the new disk. Short of copying the files over by
hand onto the zip disk, does anyone have any ideas as to how to do this?
Surely someone else backs up to Zips?
Since this is off-topic, you may want to reply privately so as to not annoy
the rest of the list
Thanks in advance

This will almost certainly work...

    diskchange physical_device_name:

..will tell the OS you have inserted different disk.

2 programs I use..
dremind (avail from aminet)
and the one below

lha -x -r -d -a -N u backup:system2 sys:#?

The above oneliner, the icon type is a project, and the tooltype is iconx. It 
sits in my sys drive. Hmmmm.... wonder if I set the script bit, if dremind 
can do the whole job ???

For now I just smack the icon monthly and upload to my PC's bbs...
You could mod the above to several different lines, and like I said if 
dremind can execute a script, you could create several of the above for each 
directory needing backed up and where to put it.. Then just let dremind do 
the timing for when to backup...

I've been the route of using these 'SPECIAL backup' programs with their own 
special algorithms to dearc the files. Thats how I lost a backup of Dbase 4 
and Lotus 1-2-3... The backup got trashed a bit and the backup program 
couldn't do squat about it...

Using LHA, ARJ, ZIP, what have you, you can usually salvage something. If the 
backup program throws up on any bytes thats the end of the whole backup

Lost CED that way also as it was archived all by itself...

   Small in what way?

Just the program 'lha' can create/decompress LHA files. If you want a GUI
then do an aminet search for 'knack' or something.

	Hey folks,
	sorry I dissappeared, two papers and a midterm this week, but
still I read and appreciated all your comments, even those from the
non-believers ;)  
	Here's a big reply to everything said:

so:
Palle Anker Larsen (from Denmark!) said:
Yes, it's GREAT, but is it true, that only 2 LedSsamples is used in one
player??
	
	Yeah this is true, only 2 samples in each mode.  The samples avg.
about 80k in length so 2 play modes X 2 Samples X 80 + 80 (for intro loop)
= 400k, the actuall sample bank is even bigger than this, so you can see
why I didn't include too many, I suppose I could include more by having
several sample banks, then pick a random one to load at the start of each
level, the banks would be smaller (2-300k) would a 2-300k load slow the
game up too much between levels, what do you folks think?  (also the more
samples I use the further in Copyright trouble I get ;)

Neil ives said:
A1200 - 040/50Mhz - Game runs at a good speed.

Well your machine's even faster then mine! :)

Again Neil Ives:
#I'm impressed with the way you and Amos have created such a slick game.
Amos# 
	Thanks, this was actually a key goal of mine, I'm as proud of Amos
as the next guy but I didn't want it showing through in my game, :)

Neil also recommended that I send the game to AF magazine, jsut let me
know how, ok?  thanks!

Neil also said:
#I also am interested in where peeps are from. Can I suggest that Amos#
#Listers put their location in their signatures?#
	Well I'm all about this suggestion, of course I'm not so sure
where ot add my country, the way I did it now makes it look like I'm
writing my Snail Mail address instead of my signature.

#I have 2 teenage boys who are busy play testing SPMania.#

	Cool, Floquet also had kids playing the game, anybody else got
youngsters testing the game?  I'm actualy quite interested in how they
respond, kids are the most demanding critques. but also the funnest to
please.  ;)


Andrew Crowe added:

Its not too bad. The music adds a nice touch, could you have a perminant
drum beat in the background when none is playing though? it seems a bit
silent when theres nothing playing.

	I agree the game is too quiet during the game, usually eating
pellets makes for enough noise, but there are definately quiet moments.  I
had experiamented with adding the drum loop throughout the game but it
gets waaay too repetitive (yes even that classic drum beat (anybody spot
it yet?) get's dull after ten minutes)  I'd need different drum loops left
and right, maybe this could be part of the multi-sample bank solution I
was talking about.  The orig. Mrs. Pac-Man gets around this silence issue
by having ms. pac make jaw flapping noises when she isn't eating pellets.
I could try this as well I suppose.

Andrew Crowe also said:

Also, 2 player modes good as well.

	Yeah this feature is waht makes the game IMHO, otherwise jsut
another (albiet cool zep enhanced) paccer.  But 2-play at the same time is
massively fun.  By the way the only bug n the game that I know of happens
in the two player mode, I noticed just before I sent the game out, will
correct it.  (anyvody spot it? hint, try both paleyrs dyng alot)

Andy added further:
I think that the GFX could be bigger though, they seem a bit small.

	I chose the GFX size so i could evenly fit the orginal pac-man map
onto the screen, the trouble is the Pac arcade machine is taller than it
is wide, whereas our 'miggies are wider than they are tall!  Nonetheless
this is a good point, I tinkered with thidea of scrolling the visible
screen around a bigger map but canned it after playing some pac-man Jr, it
uses this feature and sucks!  

Oh but Andrew wasn't doen with me just yet:

Apart from that, its not bad. I think it could be more original, like
having powerups that randomly appear and have random effects (jump over
walls for a certain amount of time?) 

	Ut-oh, I don't want to be caught mincing words, but while I
definately see the originality point, I gotta say I'm not all interested
in adding any fancy stuff to the game, my mission statement was to make a
decent pac clone for my miggy cause I couldn't find one that would run on
my machine.  Also I've played Super-Pac-Man in the arcades, which is sort
of like this, lots of wierd power ups and stuff, changing walls and
things, and I can say it sucks!  All the same I appreciate the comment
Andy, I'm a pretty hard core Pac-Man fan but I could see where there might
be room for bonus extras and such in the game, in fact it might add alot
to the two-player mode.  I'll give it some thought, what kind of extras
would be cool in the two player mode, any ideas folks??

Oh andy was nice too:
   Well, keep up the good work.
thanks man, will do.

Oh and later he added:
 I think SPMainia needs more work before it'd win though.

	I see the point, I once read an article talking about a neat
Pac-like written in Amos and the reviewer started off by saying "At first
glance one might think 'Oh great just what the world needs another poorly
written Amos Pac-man clone.'"  He went on to praise the game, but I kept
that quote in the back of my mind the whole time I was writing the game,
still it's not clear to me even a well-written pac-clone is worth any
awards, I wouldn't be hurt if they chose to give'em to something more
original.  :)

Everybody's pal Giark wrote:

One change I'd make: Some sort of game over thing when your last man dies. 
It's a bit abrupt, going right to the title screen as soon as you die for
the last time. 

	good point, it's a simple thing to ask too.  Also I know the
screen flicks some when the name-entry scheme for high-scores appears,
this was a by-product of my switch to loading the screens instead of jsut
Unpacking them, so I didn't bother to fix it up since I just wanted to get
a working ver. of the game out to you guys as soon as possible.  So I'll
fix up both these, even got a sample in mind for Game-Over music.

	Speaking of music the saddest comment came from Leto, who all the
from down Under, commented:

Haha -- well to be honest I've never heard any Led Zepplin tunes.
But the samples you've included are pretty cool!

	AAAHH!!  This is truly tragic, leto if international postage
wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg (making me that much closer to looking
like pac-man :)  ) I'd rush you a Zep CD overnight!!  You just don't know
what you been missing son.  Seriously, they are an absolutely dynomite
band, there's no denying it, they are also the 2nd best selling band of
all time (behind only the beatles)  If you want an album to look for try
spinning Led Zeppelin II or Houses of The Holy, oh and Zep IV is home of
Starway to Heaven, can't be you'v enever heard that one!  

	Now as for the rest of you, there's no excuse, come on now you
must be able to spot those samples, one of the two-player ones is just
about the most famous Rock n roll song ever!!!

Yep, I did that on purpose. I send one to the list and one to you.
I renember reading in a book (Netiquette?) that it's a good custom
that if you reply to somebody you also send a copy private.
In caseyou somehow miss it on the list you also get it private.

Hi all,

I seem to have a major computer fault, my a1200t is crashing like
crazy and frequently taking longer and longer to actually start
working, when I switch on.

I'm broke and can't afford a new a1200, and this is the 3rd
a1200 motherboard I've had (2nd hand) so if the problem persists
then I give up.

no more 3d... :(

I'm really depressed, as my miggy is not only my passion for
3d, but also my lines of communication.. so i'll lose a
lot of good friends. :(

I think the system will totally collapse in 2-3 days, thats why
I'm saying "goodbye" now.

BTW - Its only my a1200 motherboard thats gone, ne1 wanna buy
a 2nd hand 166mhz PPC 060/50 SCSI2.? , Tower, HD, cd-rom,
1700 disks and 75CD's? :)

if you're interested then write to:

	Hey all,
	I am still quite committed to the pitfall project,
	want to write the movement routines,
	what I need to know is, what are the states we envision
	for Pitfall Harry, I mean what in all can harry be doing?
	I suggest:
		
	1) Standing/Running on ground
	2) Jumping
	3) Swinging (on rope)
	4) Climbing (like up a laddder)
	
	that covers the original pitfall, what about adding:
	5) Swimming
	
	Well I need to know what ones to use, then I will
	dream up a structure to deal with all the states and such and
	send it in for you guys to pick apart, then maybe I start
	writing the code finally (sound ok?)

Is what you really need an excuse to give up on the Amiga? I just saw a
picture that you did in the latest Amiga Format (April 99). It's very good.

We have probably all felt like giving up when our Amiga's play up, but when
it comes to it decide not to move to something inferior. 
Sorry if you've tried all this but.........why should the mother board fail?
Try re-seating all the socketed chips, (earth yourself first). What's it
like when you boot from a floppy? Check for virus's. Check the HD ribbon
cable connections. Spray contacts like that with electrical lubricant. Try
reformatting the HD. I had a Seagate 200MB hard disk when I bought my 1200,
it gradually became more and more faulty, with block errors. The computer
frequently crashed. Eventually the HD refused to boot. The only thing I
could do was buy a new HD.  
I have installed Professional File System 2 on my new HD, this avoids
invalidated disks. I can safely turn the machine off while writing to disk
without anything bad happening, just the loss of that last save. I have a
zip drive so I can back up my HD just in case.
I have always used a power supply smoothing device. I have never
plugged/unplugged anything while the machine is turned on.

Come on man don't give up yet. The Amiga needs all the support it can get.

I have an unused new Amiga Technologies A1200 Magic pack for sale but I
guess you could get a mother board much cheaper.

Personally, I find Hisoft Basic 2 usefull, and very stable, with a nice
editor, particularly for small proggies.

From: "Benjamin Jones" <benjones@hotmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am new to amos-list but not to amos or the amiga, I just love the 
amiga.

anyway, now to the subject, I was wondering if anyone has made an 
Isometric game in amos, I have started but was wondering if you have any 
code or somethingfor detecting where the mouse is on the tiles.

That would be very usefull.

cheers,

Ben.

Subject: [amos-list] Summary of replies: Using multiple Zip disks in a scheduled backup
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Rod Whiteley <rwhiteley@magnet.com.au>

G'Day all,
Since so many people were kind enough to respond privately to my backup
question, I thought it only fair that I post a summary of the replies to the
list, I thought some of the information would be useful to others . (This is
how our biomechanics list works)
Oh, BTW I'm currently evaluating Diavolo (which works like a charm) and will
check out ABackup next week (freeware).
Cheers,
Rod Whiteley

I use Diavolo and a tape backup. No problems with using multiple tapes. I
believe it can use Zips too, although I haven't used it for that purpose.

 RW>                             Surely someone else backs up to Zips?

I use ABackup version 5.14 with my ZIP drive.

I have set up my HD like my PC at work to have program directories and a
main Data directory off the root with sub directories for Final Writer,
Amos etc. I don't archive the data files, I use UpdateCopy with a script
run by IconX from an icon. UpDateCopy obviously only copies newer files.
The script excludes the file icons. This is useful because the process was
being slowed down updating the snapshot info from the icons. I have to
check for space on the Zip occasionally. If you have loads of stuff, you
could arrange further scripts for different sections. I recently tidied up
my data by lha archiving to a zip disk all data greater than a year old and
removing it from the HD.

I have lha'd my program directories seperately to another zip but I dont
know if one really needs to backup program files as you could re-install
them from the originals. 
Hmm......your mail has made me think about the prefs settings though. I
think I'll change the prefs paths to save into my Data directory. 

Let me know if you want a copy of UpDateCopy and the script that I use.

2 programs I use..
dremind (avail from aminet)
and the one below

lha -x -r -d -a -N u backup:system2 sys:#?

The above oneliner, the icon type is a project, and the tooltype is iconx. It 
sits in my sys drive. Hmmmm.... wonder if I set the script bit, if dremind 
can do the whole job ???

For now I just smack the icon monthly and upload to my PC's bbs...
You could mod the above to several different lines, and like I said if 
dremind can execute a script, you could create several of the above for each 
directory needing backed up and where to put it.. Then just let dremind do 
the timing for when to backup...

I've been the route of using these 'SPECIAL backup' programs with their own 
special algorithms to dearc the files. Thats how I lost a backup of Dbase 4 
and Lotus 1-2-3... The backup got trashed a bit and the backup program 
couldn't do squat about it...

Using LHA, ARJ, ZIP, what have you, you can usually salvage something. If the 
backup program throws up on any bytes thats the end of the whole backup

Lost CED that way also as it was archived all by itself...

This will almost certainly work...

    diskchange physical_device_name:

..will tell the OS you have inserted different disk.

Hiya,

All it seems to show is that the top title bar has gone. Hmm (as he checks to

Hi,
anyone visited in the amiga web directory lately?
In the news section you should see first official pics of OS3.5 but for
some reason I can't see them (www.amiga.de doesn't reply or something):(
Has anyone got them already?

To be honest they don't show a whole lot although the people in the picture
look very pleased with themselves.  Nice backdrop, glowicons and they didn't
even change the Ram disk icon.

Not complete, because Pietro went offline for a while. Abot 80% of tcp is
done.

You've not been watching. GUI 2.0 is in beta stages. I'm doing a complete doc
of the entire extension. It's more of a chore than you might think.

Subject: [amos-list] Super PacMania Update!
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>


	Ok folks,
	So I finally got away from the old ball and chain for a bit, (just
kidding, I do love my girl :)  and launched the 3rd major revision of
SuperPacMania, I made a bunch of changes, but there's still more to be
done.  Here's what I did:

	1) Sped up Pac-Man 
		Sounds simple but this really makes the game alot better,
it's more like the arcade game and changes the dynamics a little, instead
of just dodging the ghosts your more trying to avoid them (ie keep from
running into them rather than keep them from running into you)  Also this
change helps the graphics a little, there still as small, but the boards
feel smaller (because you move faster) so the graphics feel bigger, make
sense??  Also gives the game a 'fast and furious' feeling.

	2) Made Pac-Man slow down when eating pellets
		Just a little bit of a slow down, makes it more like the
arcade game and gives some strategy (ie try to clear escape paths across
baord for outrunning ghosts in a pinch)
	
	3) Completely re-wrote ghost AI
		they are now alot better.  No more turning around ever!!
Well can move backwards if trapped. but otherwise, never turn around.
Also now always either chase or run, no more 'random wander' mode.  Much
better, ghosts are trickier, but also have just right amount of
predictability so there is more strategy to deciding where you move.  

	That's all right now, am very proud of how I did new AI and kept
ghosts from moving backwards, it's the 3rd AI engine the game has seen and
it by far the best.  Also proud of how easy it was to implement these
changes, seriously, speeding up pac man litterly took deleting two lines
of code and adding one new one.  good structure in your code really does
pay heavy dividends. :) 

	To Do:
	
	1) Game Over Screen
		No swett to do just not too interesting from a coding
stand point, still it'll be there I promise!

	2) More samples, new sample routines
		Again i know how I want to implement this change just take a
minute.  Also Floquet put together a new sample bank for me, it may
replace the zep bank, for copyright reasons.  Sad to see zep go, :( , but
I'm sure Floquet's got something equally as rocking prepared for us, :) 

	3) True Ghost "Home(s)"
		Will take a bit more work

	4) Ghost turn into eyes and run home.
		This will actually be quite simple with my new AI code.

	5) Edible/Dangerous ghosts on board at same time
		Will take work, but have idea how to do.

	6) New Bigger gfx
		Still a maybe but want to try it at least

	Ok I admit this list is more for me than you, but wanted to
announce my hot new changes, and let you guys know I was taking your
comments seriously.  Actually looking at my list I made three changes
nobody mentioned (well somebody complained about ghosts turning around)
and didn't work on any of the ones you talked about, but they're next I
promise. :)

   Writing a starwars game? If you like I'll search my MOD cd for one.

If not you could always record it as a large sample and use the hd sample
playback routine in the amospro manual.

No ! Don't e-mail him where he can find Stra Wars MODS !!!!

Email *US*, or better, give the url(s) here, I guess there are lots of
star wars addicts here !!


**************** ABOUT SUPER PACMANIA ****************

As said Scooter, I created a new sample bank for his game,
BUT:
* He never heard it again, so he may think it's shit ;)
* I use some commercial samples, too, but as they are techno,
copyrights are smoother!
* Damn, I use the 20th Century fox and THX trailers, too... 8(
* It is huge, the lha file weights 654 Kb !! So goodbye 512k chip
machines...

Anyway I'll create other(s) banks, with self-made loops and shorter
samples.

Bye!

Be of good cheer, fellows.

The gui docs are shaping up. I've integrated all the gui 1.7 docs and my gui
tcp 1.8 docs. I've also sent to Pietro the list of undocumented commands. As
soon as he gets back to me, I will add them in. Remember, over 200 commands
have to be documented.

Does anybody know where I could locate a 10base-T Ethernet card for my
Amiga? I've got a 10base-T HUB connecting some PCs, and the only computer
that lacks being on the LAN is my Amiga! If anybody knows where I could
find a good deal on one (or maybe you have one for sell), then let me know.

If nothing else, I'll have to try a PC2Amiga parallel configuration
(which would mean I'd have to find a 50ft. parallel cable!).

then slowly fade it out, w/o affecting the other channels.  Any ideas?

Volume works just like sam play. Use the voice parameter and you can alter
volume levels of one or more voices.

My AmosPro manual (pg 08.01.03) says:

VOLUME level
VOLUME /voice/,level

The VOLUME command controls level of sound..0 to 63
and
VOICE bit-mask....representing the state of one of the four channels
eg 
Voice %1111: all voices activated
Voice %0001: Voice 0 only
Voice %1001: Voices 3 and 0

So
Volume %0001,63
Boom:Wait 100:Rem Channel 1 loud

Volume %1110,5
Boom:Wait 50:Rem Channels 2,3,4 soft

Subject: [amos-list] New Version of AmosPro & Manual
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>

I have been thinking about the new release of AmosPro and am wondering if
there is any documentation to accompany it.  There are still quite a number
of people using Amos The Creator and this release will be welcomed but
practically useless if they do not know or understand the syntax of the
AmosPro commands.

Would the current AmosPro users consider documenting a chapter each from the
manual for such people and of course for the better of the Amos community.

Before anyone asks, Yes I do own a copy of the AmosPro manual and am more
than willing to contribute.

What do you think?

Great idea.
If there's no copyright difficulties, that is. Pietro?
And yes, I've got a copy of the AP manual too and am willing to contribute.

As do I. And, to get it started, here's a text file of several chapters of
amos commands. (Syntax only)

I'm thinking, thats a lot of typing. I might be persuaded to try some of it.
Would a listing of all the commands be useful so that the on-line help can
be accessed to explain syntax etc? Better than nothing?

Subject: [amos-list] c2p and CBATNAM.
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>

Well, the Dungeon for CBATNAM is coming along. After some collaborating
(between PAC and myself, with help from Kalms), I have implemented some c2p
routines into the Dungeon. Here are some test results from my Amiga:

A2000 'o4o/25 with WB 2.1 (ECS):
8fps-20fps with texture mapping
15fps-30fps without texture mapping

Cool, eh? Yes, these results ARE IN *AMOS* (compiled, of course). In
theory, people running an AGA setup should get a MUCH higher frame rate,
due to the fact that the c2p's are currently optimized for o3o+ AGA (30-50
fps?). Anyhow, there are still a few bugs to be worked out, but as soon as
they are, then I will be sending a demo to Keith and the List. Stay tuned.

	Hey all,
	Thanks for the scoop on volume control, put the routine in
super-pac mania this morning, worked like a charm, now I can set the Power
pellet timer to anything I want!!  Thanks a bundle, game is grooving along
great, just added a cornering routine, pretty cool, figured it out by
wasting a few quarters at the arcade and watching how the orignal pac man
game handled corners, turns out to be much simpler than you'd think.  
Floquet: Will get back to you in a bit, sorry, I keep making more and more
changes, but very close to done with them, then I'll pass you the ditty
ok.  Same to everybody else, as soon as I get his new revisoin done it'll
be rock-a-rolla time!

BTW
	Got to see the Road Warrior movie last night, great film, would
love to work on a Road Warrior/Spy Hunter style game sometime, any
partners out there.  Also Pitfall guys, will have movement routine design
out soon, sorry, so many distractions...

			Thanks,

Yes, I think your actions for Harry sound pretty good.

I know I've set myself up as half co-ordinator, but to be honest,
I'm finding it rather difficult to find time. I'm sure no-one
wants to have a person working on the game who's finding it a
hassle. I still want to help out, but this level of position is a
bit too much......... any one want to take over?

Subject: [amos-list] Proposed CV Template
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Neil Ives <neil.ives@btinternet.com>

Hello children are you sitting comfortably? Then I will begin.
Once upon a time I had an idea......... 
I have often wondered what you people are like, how old you are, what you
have done with Amos, if you are at
school/college/university/work/unemeployed/armed forces, where you live,
what gender, other interests, what computer experience you
have......etc,..etc.
I propose to create a  CV template which I will mail to the list. Those who
want to, can fill in the details and mail them back to the list. Those who
are interested can keep those mails and refer to them when writing to
someone, locating their web site, or reading their comments.
If you keep your own copy you can update details later and mail it to the
list again.
Anyone got anything to say about this idea?

Replace the amos3d.library with amospro32.library. It's on one of the ap

Perhaps the Amos screen height you have defined is not suitable for Amos3D.
Change the screen height and see if you get any change.  *This is just a
guess.*

Hi there..

Does anybody know what's wrong when I get a "Amos screen not compatible with

...screen width should be 320 if memory serves.
make sure TD SCREEN HEIGHT=something sensible
Make sure the number of colours is quite low (8 ish), but it does
compensate.

Have fun.

Keep on punching guys.  I had stopped coding in AMOS for about two
years, but when i got back on the net and saw the AMOS presence and
enthusiasm still in the community, i couldn't help but fire up that
turqoisee screen again.  It's philosophy of minimum effort, maximum,
quick results will never die.  It certainly launched and nurchered my
programming career and i will never forget it or stop supporting it
until i am the last one using it.  I wish i could promote it to my
cvision but alas, i will have to make do.  Don't Give up on AMOS and
above all, never ever give up on the amiga, you WILL miss out on a
huge revolution if you do.

Hi all,

Hope the Pitfall game is going well.  I`d love to help out, if there`s
something small I can do, like some GFX or som-ink.

While I have your attention, I don`t suppose you know how many radians
are in a circle?  I`ve got it narrowed down to about 6.2 but it`s still
not right.

Andy H.

2 x Pi = 2 x 3.141159 = 6.282318 (rounded, Pi has infinity of decimals)
You'd better use DEGREE : 360 degrees !
And like this you can use integers : It's faster !

and going home.

    Keith Hill, AKA Braneloc.

    Male.  Though if you mail me a female, I'll be happier.

    Internet Wierdo.  (Yes, you can get paid for that)

>Real Amiga or emulator?


    Both.  I prefer the real one, it's 30 times faster, and crashes less.

>How long have you been using an Amiga?


    Decade or so.

>If you have a real Amiga, what is it's specification?


    To sit on the desk next to the peecee and do internet stuff.  Oh, you
mean..  Right.

In front of me: A1200 in a big towery box, 68060 chip, 32meg fast ram,
cybergraphics in a dusty box next to the dusty zorro slots I can't get
workign, a couple of hard drives that are small and work, and a couple of
internal blown up hard drives that are large and don't work, a really slow
20 speed CD rom, one of those SCSI boards that plug into the back of the
68060, a quick modem, and a nice network to the peecee.

To my right, a boring old 68020 based a2000 with no gfx card (yeah, I
probably should), with more hard drives than I can count, about 16 CD ROM
drives, a bit of memory (probably 8 meg fast) and a bunch of other stuff
like a TV card or so.

Above me at a scary angle, a CD32, with 68020 & floppy drive (!)  (ok, it
came as an extra on the A1200, so I plugged it in somewhere it would be
usefull), with plenty of memory, and a hard drive that is exactly big enuf,
plus some kind of network to the A1200 (or is it the peecee, can't
rememebr), and it has a lovely graphics tablet attached to it, genlock, and
other stuff.

Next to the bed is the A500 which has a massive 2 meg expansion box on the
side, and a serial cable ggoing to god knows where.  I think it attaches to
the A2000, but I'm not sure any more.

In a box in the hall are the genlocks, video digitizers (b/w, colour),
robotics drivers, midi interfaces, old modems, old hard drives, old scsi
cards, and a whole bunch of other stuff I can't remember.

>What is your main Amiga activity?


Oh dear.

A1200 - Internet publishing, and mostly graphics and web page editing these
days.
CD32  - Dust gathering, and notepad with graphics tablet.  Electronic paper.
Night light.  Umm, remind me to use it again.
A2000 - Dust gathering, and BBS system.  Remind me to do SOMETHING with it.
PS: The moniter on it blew up a few months ago.
A500  - Dust gathering and games when I get a chance to remmeber it exists.

>How long have you used Amos?


Yonks.

>What version of Amos do you have?


Err, almost certianly AmosPro2.0

>What Amos extensions do you have?


Less than I had before the crash.  I used to have many, many, many of them
installed, but now its a very select few.  Probably less than that.

>Other computer languages used and competence level:


Oh dear.  Most of them.  Yeah, at least competant..

>Amos achievements:
>Amiga achievements:


I hate stuff like this.  Err, stuff.  Loads of stuff.  Megs and megs of
stuff.

>Website recommendations:


    What, there are others ?  Most of the ones I design are boring
sales/marketing ones that no-onme would be interested in.  I don't make any
money from telling you.

>Other interests/achievements: (can be non computer related)


    AD&D - Seriously, my DM skills are legendary.  I'm currently workign on
a massive campaign world conversion to the computer.  If I ever get the time
to finish it.  It will be available on either peecee or amiga, or if you are
lucky, both.  It's a LONG term project.

>Your comments: (about, Amos - Amiga - computers - anything that won't upset
>a family audience!)


Won't upset ?  Oh dear.  I wish I could support the amiga more than I do.  I
still use my amiga on a regular basis, but since the crash and moving my
email to the peecee, I use it considerably less.  I currently still use the
amiga and peecee as one unit, with the amiga editing directly from the
peecee, and use them as a fully integrated system.  There are still some
things that the amiga does better than the peecee, and no matter how much
money you spend on the damn things, they are still more annoying.  Now if
the amiga emulator was about 30 times quicker, I would be a lot happier and
buy a laptop peecee to just run amiga stuff.

_AMOS LIST CV_

Last updated: 16-Mar-99

CV for: Mr. Christopher Kossa

Gender: Male

Of: Clifton, NJ USA

Age: 22

Birthday: 5-Dec-76

Occupation: College, and unused space

Real Amiga or emulator?
  The one and only real thing.

How long have you been using an Amiga? 
  Since June 93.  Wow!  And I didn't have to go through 3 new motherboards
to keep up with the latest hardware/processors. :)

If you have a real Amiga, what is it's specification?
  1)  Amiga 4000T. Cyberstorm 060/50+604e/200, 144 Fast, Picasso IV,
Conceirto, Buhhda/Catweasle, Multiface III, A4066 Ethernet, 4.3 Gigs HD,
32x CD-Rom, LS-120, ZIP, UMAX 12000S scanner, and CD-RW.. Plus a killer 17'
Monitor. :)
  2)  Amiga 1200, GVP 030/50, 8 Fast, 210 Megs HD (Grandmother got it for
me, so this one will never be junked/sold!)

What is your main Amiga activity?
  Surfing the net, school work, and trying to get AMOS to run .

How long have you used Amos?
  about 5 years

What version of Amos do you have?
  the latest one

What Amos extensions do you have?
  AMCAF (Reg), LDos, LSerial, Turbo, JD Exts

Other computer languages used and competence level:
  Pascal, not really much in C/C++.  I guess Arexx.

Amos achievements:
  violent Nibbles clone, VoyagerNG Cache cleaner, and never finishing any
project I started.

Amiga achievements:
  proving to people that those "an old" machines can do almost anything that
a MAC or PC can.  

Your Website:
  a horrible waste of web space!  http://www.erols.com/abattoir/

Website recommendations:
  http://www.go2net.com/index_power.html
  
Other interests/achievements: (can be non computer related)
  Drawing, playing (or more like trying to play) guitar and drums, and
sleeping.
  
Your comments: (about, Amos - Amiga - computers - anything that won't upset
a family audience!)
  I think AMOS is a great programming language and enviroment.  I rather try
working around some AMOS quirks and bug than try to program in a dull text
editor.  AMOS is kinda fun to work with.  Hope the new verison will be
similar.

	hey does anybody know a way to sample just one sample in one
voice?
	Sam Loop On loops all future samples, but what if only want to
loop one sample in one voice, like to have a drum loop play in background
while a sound effects go off.

No way. But there is a solution:
Create an empty sample (let's say it will be sample #1)
Store somewhere in tables the durations,
the current timers, and the current voice for each sample.
Set sam loop to on, play your drum loop.
When you play a sample, make:
TB_TIMER(numsample)=TB_DURATION(numsample)
TB_VOICE(numsample)=<the_voice_yoy_want>
Sam Play TB_VOICE(numsample),<your sample>
(...code...)
for i=1 to <number_of_samples>
	if TB_TIMER(i)>0
		Dec TB_TIMER(i)
		If TB_TIMER(i)=0
			Sam play TB_VOICE(i),1
		Endif
	endif
Next

***************

Add some blank space at the end of each sample, in case of some
timing errors : on slow machines, maybe you will loose some Vbl's
and the sample will loop again before being cut.

I use a blank sample to interrupt a note currently played when
user releases a key on his synth (MIDI), it works fine.

Hope this helps.

I've found another solution while eatin' this noon:
Set sam loop to OFF, and when you need your drum loop to start just use
the EVERY statement to perform it at the right timing !
It is a better way to do the trick than my previous message.

I found a problem using the every statement though;

I was writing an application in AMOS Interface (I have Pro 2.*). As it was a
program which displayed basically the same screen forever, I decided to
write a screensaver, which I did. It uses the every statement to check the
timings etc... But I found that when I incorporated it into the Interface
program, it just seemed to crash. This was before I update my Amos libraries
to correct other problems that I had, but as I have deleted the faulty
program, I cannot say whether this a general fault to ALL versions of AMOS,
or just earlier versions.

In a nutshell: Be Careful With the EVERY statement.

True. I've used the EVERY command quite a lot together with AMOS Interface.
What I've learnt is that using a lower value than 5 in ON EVERY x ... will
make the program unstable if you have a slow machine.

And if you use EVERY OFF you're also up for trouble. It seems like
if the program is about to trigger an EVERY interrupt when the EVERY OFF
command is executed you'll be granted a crash.
Solution: Use a flag to block the reactivation (EVERY ON) at the end of
your EVERY-called routine.

Doing this I've no longer any problems with EVERY and related crashes.

Hello Scooter

You need to turn on sam looping, then turn off the voices you don't want
looped as follows...

sam loop on

sam loop off %1101

sam play %0010,1 : rem this will loop

sam play %0001,1 : rem this won't

I'm not sure if this is documented anywhere, but it works.
Beware though, the 'Sam Loop Off' command magically turns into 'Sam Loop On'
in the editor, so if you edit it, you need to change it back to 'Sam Loop
Off' to work !

Cheers,

Hi,
Does anybody on this list know how to handle modems in Amos? I'm trying to
write a program which will dial a BBS and get my mail. The only problem is
that i don't  know how to get the modem to dial, I have sent 'atdt 01xxx
xxxxxx' to the modem but it doesn't dial the number. Is there some sort of
setup string i need to send?
Thanks!

The Compiler wont compile it, its too big.
The source needs 1meg of a text buffer in the editor

You have to send CR+LF to the modem, like your pressing return.

I think (dont quote me on it) you do "adtd 01xxxxxxxxx"+chr$(10)+chr$(13)


I've writen a working modem program so if that doesn't work I'll dig it up
and see how it was done...

See ya.

the Amos list, AMOS, Animation, Scala, Internet 
 
How long have you used Amos?
Since it came out, 7 years?
 
What version of Amos do you have?
Original, now use AmosPro 2 + Compiler
 
What Amos extensions do you have?
GUI Extension
 
Other computer languages used and competence level:
AmigaBasic (by Microsoft, and it showed), learning. 
AMOS, not bad at the basics
AREXX, learning

Amos achievements:
Self taught from the excellent AMOS manuals. A couple of competent games,
but not original. 
Lots of enjoyment.

Really nicely set up system with New icons and Glow Icons with many other
patches that bring my Miggy into the 21st Century.
Infra Rexx unit built and working. Parnet link to second Amiga.
Scala script called from Startup Sequence to run DPaint anim with
music.
Getting on the Net and finding the AMOS list has removed that feeling of
isolation in a world of PC owners.
Lots of enjoyment.

Your Website:
Not ready for viewing yet

Website recommendations:
www.AmigaCentral.com
www.AmigaSoc.com

Other interests/achievements: (can be non computer related)
Being a Father for the last 20 years. I have 3 children that anyone would be
proud of. Dinghy Sailing. Walking. Cycling 20 miles every weekday.
Beautiful women, (thats an interest, not an achievment). My 1929 Austin 7
car. Pink Floyd's music. Food. The movie, Blade Runner.
 
Your comments:
I use a Windows NT PC at work. Yeh ok, MS software is very powerful, I love
using Excel. But the machine is so 'unfriendly', and it locks up
frequently. I find it relaxing to come home and sit at the Amiga. It still
feels more modern than the PC.
When (lets be optimistic) the new Amiga comes out it will have to be able to
read & run PC software as that has become the de facto standard, (God help
us).
I guess emulation will be the name of the game, It may emulate a 680xx
Amiga if were lucky. 
The World needs a better Personal Computer than the existing PC, Amiga
owners know the difference. Why shouldn't the new Amiga be the one?

(hey what about "Amiga owners know the difference" as a tagline?)

You need to open the port at the right speed, set the transfer bits, set the
buffer, all that rot. And you still may need to send an atz before any other
commands.

Hi Everybody,

   So far here's the current 4 player adapter code I've got.

I've had conflicting reports about the fire button though.... 



If you have a 4 player adapter, could you run this little program and see if
it works. 

If it does then you can all go and add 4 player adapter support to your
games ;)

(Of corce, if it doesn't work then by all means please try to fix it ;)

See ya.

A500, 1 mb ram. (used only to play AGA incompatible games now!)

What is your main Amiga activity?
Programming in Amos, and gaming.

How long have you used Amos? Since it was first released

What version of Amos do you have? The first version of AmosPro...1.3?
 
What Amos extensions do you have? Craft, and a couple of others - not 
sure which!
 
Other computer languages used and competence level: Blitz (didn't rate 
it) - beginner.
  
Amos achievements:
None of any note. Made a few things that I use myself, but nothing of 
note. Lots of unfinished projects (of course).

Amiga achievements:
None worth mentioning!

Your Website:
Nope.

www.saintsfc.co.uk - I am a Southampton FC fan!!
 
Other interests/achievements: (can be non computer related)
Beer, footie(soccer), pub, drinking.
  
Your comments: (about, Amos - Amiga - computers - anything that won't 
upset a family audience!)
Erm, Amos is real easy to use, and way better than any equivalent 
language given its expandability (extensions etc). 
I also hope that Gateway/Amiga Tech publicise AmigaNG enough to ensure 
it sells well. Otherwise there's no point.

soon...), coding.

with a stupid-looking face, when telling I'm using an Amiga :) Well, actually

	Super Pac Mania v3 is out, just sent it to my list of folks who
asked for it the 1rst time, if you didn't get it and want to let me know!
	
	Thanks to Steve (I think) for the Sam Loop Off %1010 trick,
	it did the job alright, and you were right, editor likes to turn
it into Sam Loop On for some reason, my secret was to zip up the proc to
hide it from the dirty editor when testing.  Anyway, thanks a bundle for
that trick as it made it possible for me to use short samples and also to
have different power pellet times for different levels.  
	All in all SPMania is rock solid now, I mean I hate to say it but
I've actually become terribly proud of it since these changes, so well if
you guys would like to burst my bubble go right ahead, at any rate let me
know what you all think.

peace out,
	Scott Matott sXe

Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>

_AMOS LIST CV_
Keep this CV for later reference
Last updated on March 18, 1999

CV for: Adam Parrott
Gender: Male
Of: Trophy Club, Texas, US

Age: 17 and 6 mos.
Birthday: 09-15-81

Occupation: High School, about to enter College

Real Amiga or emulator?  Real, although I run WinUAE on my PC (which is a
Gateway G6-450, Pii-450 with 128MB SDRAM, 9GB HD, nVidia Riva TNT, STB
Voodoo2 Blackmagic 3D card, SoundBlaster AudioPCI 64D, 5x/DVD, 32x/CD, 56k)

How long have you been using an Amiga?
Since I was about 9 (that would be around 1990)

If you have a real Amiga, what is it's specification?
A2000 'o4o/25, ECS, 1MB Chip, 16MB Fast, 500MB HD, 105MB/SyQuest, WB2/3
(also have a stock A3000 'o3o/25 and a stock A500 68k that I don't use) :/

What is your main Amiga activity?
Programming, games, and almost nothing else.

How long have you used Amos?
Since Pro was released (mid-1993)

What version of Amos do you have?
AMOS Pro v2.01 and AMOS Pro Compiler

What Amos extensions do you have?
AMCAF (registered)
AMOS-3D (coverdisk)
Craft (coverdisk)
Turbo Plus (coverdisk)
Game Extension (beta)
Falcon Extension (beta)
GUI (haven't installed it yet)

Other computer languages used and competence level:
Any other BASIC (pretty good)
C/C++ (just the basics)
68k Assembler (average)
HTTP/3-4 (pretty well)

Amos achievements:
Cap'n Bubba and the Nasty Alien Menace (Dungeon, Level 4)
and a few other unreleased games and multimedia apps.

Amiga achievements:
Many old projects archived away--never finished. Best Amiga acheivement
yet, though, is that my trusty A2000 still works great (10+ years old).

Your Website:
http://come.to/parrottsoft (or)
http://parrottsoft.hypermart.net

Website recommendations:
Visit my site, when it's done (soon)

Other interests/achievements:
Music (playing and soon composing)
Computing (web site design and games)
Some reading (when I get the chance)
Hoping to get an A1200/A4000T or new Amiga soon.

Your comments: AMOS is a great language, and I am expecting, along with
everyone else, the next release. Hopefully, it'll provide the foundational
base for excellent programming opportunities which AMOS Pro can't offer.

	I was going for a slightly retro look with the title screens,
hence the Loud Red&Yellow colour scheme, like the arcade pac man cabinet
which is painted bright yellow.  Also the game loads all the title screens
on start-up and keeps them open from then on.  This includes the highscore
entry screen, the options screen as well as the two title screens, I did
this to reduce redundant load time and also because constantly loading and
closing screens tends to scramble the Amiga's memory after a bit, this was
esp. true in the old ver. of the game when the actuall game screen was
closed and reopened at the start of every new game, this seemed to cause
alot of trouble with 'ghost' walls and pellets appearing as if left over
from previous levels but never properly cleared from Ram.
	Anyway the point is that's 5 screens X how big they are that you
need in ram, that's why I like them at 4 colours, still could go back to
loading them if snazzy title screens look good enough.
	Oh and the In game screen uses 16 colours, will check out your
screen, though I must admit I am hesitant to change this as it helps make
the game faster and uses less ram.  The orig pac used 16 colours and I'm
not sure how much better more colours can make the game, my first versions
had shaded ghosts and such and I'm not sure it made much difference, plus
I've seen fancy 3-d looking pac clones and I actually think all the 3-d
effects detract from the simplicity of the game.

>   * Animation on the ghosts.
> 
	Would like to add this, the trouble is how small the are, hard to
animate their tails much cause they are so small.  But def. a feature I
want to work on, esp. now that the ghosts wait so long to come out, they
look sort of silly just sitting there staring off into space not moving.

	yup this is my next mission, it will be easy to add to the code, I
just need to draw the 2nd pac, it will be MS. Pac I think, with lip stick
and bow tie, been holding out because it is less fun work than monkeying
with the code.  

>   * Maybe add psudo-3d shading on the map blocks if you want. (I can show
> you how if you like) 
	I think I've already done this with some levels, see there are 6
different wall types to pick from, the first one and default in the map
editor (thus the one I've used most) is hollow to mimic the original Pac
arcade game, but there are also filled wall icons/levels, I use a scheme
like this

HHHHHHHHH
HMMMMMMML
HMMMMMMML
LLLLLLLLL

	where H=Highlight/Bright colour shade, 
	      L=Lowlight/Dark colour shade
	      M=Middle/Medium colour shade

Subject: [amos-list] MIDI with AMOS???
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: dl80@gmx.net

Hi there,

i´ve got a few questions concerning MIDI and AMOS :
First, can someone tell me how i can done some simple things like "Channel
xx On" and "Velocity xx" with the AMOS-commands??
It seems, that "Serial Send" doesn´t work...in fact i´ve never got
something out with this!! I´ve noticed that the commands (hex) "90","48","7F"
should cause my Synth to play Note C-3 with Velocity 127 on MIDI-Channel 1 !! But
that doesn´t work!! My Synth doesn´t do anything... how must this be
done??? 
Furthermore, I'd like to know, is it right to set the speed in AMOS to
38400 (serial fast) for using MIDI-transfer??? (i´ve done this, it doesn´t
changes anything)...

arghhh...! can ya help?? (i want to do somethin´ with MIDI... :-)

-bye-

   Do not use RAMOS, I repeat, do NOT use RAMOS.

It leaves the source unaltered, so anyone could just open it up and change
it.

And if you compile the game, it will run quite a bit faster.


If you like, send it to me and I'll compile it for you, its not going to be
to big for me ;)

See ya.

Knocked back by LucasArts to make a revolutionary game.  I suggested a
spin-off from the battle of Hoth, and they said, 'No way are we going to
let you make this'.  10 months later, out comes 'Shadows Of The
Empire'...hmmm something's strange....didn`t I suggest this to them????
Many other great things...hee hee

> Your comments:
Long live the Amiga.  When I had the cash to buy a computer in 1991, I
looked at the 286/386 for about 2.31 microseconds, then ran with great
haste to the Amiga computer.  The Amiga 500, which I still have today,
PARNET`ed to my A1200 is one of the most revolutionary computers ever
built.
In 1999, 14 years after the Amiga was born,  Gates has just managed to
create a comparable GUI.  Now the other thing that astounds me is that
all I need is a trap-door expansion (PowerPC add-on) and WE-HEY-HEY, my
A1200 Miggie will be more powerful than my clunky IBM.
I look forward to the new class of Amiga`s coming out in the Millenium.

Seeya,
ANdy H.
