I have a Blizzard 1230-IV 50Mhz and Amos Pro is working fine for me. I
have  an  8  meg  simm fitted too. I'm not too sure about the Blizzard
1200, seeing as I've never heard of it!!!

Is it only Amos that doesn't work?

Maybe the board has some jumpers on it which you can remove...?

Sorry  this  isn't  of  much help, but it could even be Amos that's at
fault. Try re-installing it.

And another thing, is it Amos that isn't working or just some code you
are writing?

Hi,

I just thaught I'd send this file here as I remember
there were a few people talking about Almagica when the demo was
released.

The Authors of Almagica are looking for Some C coders to
help finish Almagica off. It has been organised that
Vulcan will be releasing the game. If anyone is intrested 
please email me and tell Me. Attached a list of the things
left to be done. There are three other coders already.

There are no other 'Requirements' - just to be a C coder
is enough 8)

thanks in advance,

bye,

Content-Description: from Orgin (@dialup120-2-7.swipnet.se)


  Almagica, Scions of a forgotten world
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  We, the creators of Almagica are looking for new programmers to
  help with the project. This document describes, not single persons,
  but rather areas of programming objectives that need to be filled.
  All code should as far as possible be written in portable C, but
  may in some cases be optimized in 68k asm. The 68k asm routines
  should however, never be made without a fallback routine in C.
  All code must be systemfriendy.


  Introduction to the game
  ------------------------

  Almagica is a realtime strategygame that takes place in a fantasy
  environment. The game is devided into two parts, the action part
  which can be compared to games such as Warcraft II. What is
  somewhat unique in the Almagica concept however, is that the levels
  are not played in sequence. The game rather follows a storyline
  which changes as the game goes on. These changes are based partly
  on the outcome of an action level, but also in the second part of
  the game (for the moment called the 'scene part'). In the scene
  part the player can choose from a number of different available
  actions, making the actual gameplay very varying.


  AI-Sub system
  -------------

  Responsible for developing the AI. With AI we mean things like
  orders, enemy moves, pathfinders etc.

  o Pathfinder
  o Order-Scripting, how a unit should execute an order
  o Event-selection for computerized players.
  o Interface the AI with TCP/IP communication for multiplayer game.


  Communication-Sub system
  ------------------------

  Responsible for creating an interface between 2 or more computers,
  with the aim at TCP/IP but possibly also Serial/Parallell
  communication.

  o Design a communication protocol, including data sent from the AI
    and other network only communication such as broken connections
    etc.
  o Write low level communication source, primary for TCP/IP but also
    possibly for Serial and/or parallell communication. (Lowlevel
    routines for TCP/IP exists in the RTGmaster.library!).


  GFX Sub system
  --------------

  Responsible for programming the graphical interface and everything
  concerning the onscreen graphics, such as animations etc.

  o Provide the graphics interface between the user and the game and =

    the TCP/IP.
  o Write code to display gfx, by using the RTGMaster.library,
    including everything concerning the gfx (animations, units,
    terrain, etc).


  Music/Sfx-Sub system
  --------------------

  Responsible for making the sound interface between the game and AHI.
  Should write/translate a DBM0-player in portable C.

  o Determine and select a format to use for music and write a player.
  o Write code to play soundeffects.
  o Provide and interface for the gfx-programming to start =

    soundeffects.


  Main system
  -----------

  Responsible for creating all the internal structures of the game and =

  linking all the above sources into one executable.

  o Construct and setup internal structures such as objects, maps, =

    gameplay etc, partly based on what's needed for linking etc, and
    partly based to the demands from the subsystems.
  o Use the interfaces provided by the subsystems to create the final =

    executable.
  o Provide an interface for the subsystems to do system allocations
    (files, memory etc), and design that system so that there always
    is a safe way out.
  o See to that all parts follow the guidelines for the multilingual
    capabilites as wanted by the Vulcan locale standards.

I use a blizzard 1220 and it works with no problems whatsoever. It has an FPU
and runs at 28Mhz. It has 4Mb fast pre-soldered on the board.

Its about bloody time! Im bored of writing examples, and not being able to use

Nope. I have a Blizzard 030/50 w/4Mb and amos works fine.

If only I could figure out why WP does not like accelerators.

For the record (contrary to what some may believe), my IRC bot (and
scripts) are NOT written in AMOS. To help clarify this, I do -ALL- of my
Net work (web surfing, e-mail, IRC, the whole nine yards and EVERYTHING
else on my PC). I don't use my Amiga for the Net or Dialup just because
(not that I wouldn't, but the PC is easier and has more software that's
easily accessible, etc. Plus, I don't have an AGA Amiga (for browsers and
such), and besides, that's all another story and NOT my point).

Anyhow, as I said: my bot is not written in AMOS, AND I am also NOT giving
the source code away (at the moment). I may consider it in the future,
however, since I've had a few requests (the code itself it pretty much
psuedo-C so it's easily doc'able and convertable to AMOS or anything else).

Nevertheless, I can help Alain or anyone else who may have any problems or
questions as to IRC scripting or bot writing (as well as Mush or Giark,
they could also both help you as well, as they both have bots and have had
their hand at writing IRC scripts). You might also try looking around on
the Net for some tutorials and docs (there are plenty) on IRC programming.

I also had problems with loops. when iam using 2 or 3 do-loops in the main
part and the source get bigger and bigger, so that the numbers of lines
between the beginning and the end of the loop is high, there occurs some
peoblems. Somethinges I get a "loop without do" or an "exit" dosnt jumps
correctly out of the loop. And even some crashes happens.. I havent tried
to repleace with while-wend or repeart-until but nothing helps. But note,
this happens only if the source get very big enclose in a loop. 

Iam now using a label and goto if this happens again.

Hi everybody here on the list!
I am new here so I'll just write a tiny bit about my self...

My name is Lemmus and I am a coder/musician in the demogroup Efreet.
In AMOS I primarily program editors (for use in Efreets prods), accessories (I
am about to realse a nize palette-editor but I would like a few betatesters
before I release it... Anyone who's interrested...?), and some minor CLI
utils.
As i find AMOS extreamely slow I don't use it for anything "demolike"; If I
make games I make some puzzle-stylish ones where speed is not important...

Well, but to the point: As everybody knows, AMOS is full of bugs... But there
is one here, that I can't see how to override:
When compiling CLI'utils with the AP-compiler the option "Amos To Back Upon
Booting" should be set and the option "CLI-programs to run in the background"
should NOT be set.
The sad thing is, that if you set "Amos To Back Upon Booting", then the
compiler conciders "CLI-programs to run in the background" set - nomatter if
it is actually set or not.

So if you set "Amos To Back Upon Booting", then it is impossible to deactivate
"CLI-programs to run in the background"... :-(((
This actually makes it impossible to create CLI utils :-(((
What do all of you guys out there do to override this problem (or is it
perhaps me who has a bad version of the AP-compiler)...???

Last weekend I suddenly started to think of why none has done
something like Nethack/Moria (correct me if I am wrong), only with better
graphics and sounds. Think about game in which you can do almost
anything, have thousands of missions, all Nethack-like weird things
happening at midnight with nice gloomy sound, monsters hiding in shadows
(yes, lightning effects) and so much more, yam! I'm not sure if I ever
going to start programming this sweetie because lack of time (or whatever)
so I had to tell it to you. If you are interested in this kind of project
please let me know. Maybe it is not so hard to do if there are more
programmers.

Hi - I was just reading thro' these about loop problems, I had a
problem with a Do...Loop a while back. My code was quite large and
had a Do..Loop for the main game crap and a second one outside it for
stuff like 

Do
  title screen
  options
  setup screens etc
  Do
    game itself
  Loop
  Death
Loop

The outside one didn't ever work (code was couple of 100k) so goto got
used. Maybe Amos has a few problems (as if we didn't already know!)
I wish an update was possible...

Seems to me as if it's an extension command within the loop  which  doesn't
unstack  the  parameters  correctly. Any extension commands used inside the
loop (no matter if do-loop or repeat-until or while-wend)?

This is a known bug - well at least known to me.

Well, just compile for WB and delete the icon - you can  read  the  command
line with both startups.

It was on the night of 05-Feb-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Mike jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting
about "OS Devkit, GUI & JADE" until I was forced to knock them out:

Yes, I have the GUI extension on my site, and im currently working on the docs
for the new public release (which blows OS Devkit out of the water). The FTP
site is not always online, but all I can suggest is to keep trying.

I have a beta version of the JADE extension, but havent heard anything from
them. Last I heard, they werent releasing anything whatsoever demo wise, as
they were trying to get vulcan to market the extension, which doesnt seem all
that likely. If they just released it as licenseware with F1 or 5D, they'd
make a tonne of cash.

The newer version of the OS Devkit is supposed to be available, but seeing as
I dont have a demo or anything yet, I dont have it on my site. Hope I answered
your questions.

So do I.
Is there no hope whatsoever of some coder being able to hack AMOS
apart and fix a few of the more annoying bugs?

There has to be someone out there capable of this?

Hi everyone!

I've seen a lot of people talking about the OS Devkit and GUI extension
(someone also mentioned JADE). Where can I get theese extensions? I've seen
the GUI extension on your site Mush, so that's no problem (except I can't
connect to your ftp-server. Been trying for 3 days now...), but I haven't
been able to find the other two. I'm especially interested in the OS Devkit.

Please help me find those extensions!

Hi there
Do any of you know how to place more than 19 entries in the user menu...
- It is a bit frustrating to have to press several hotkeys to get to an
accessory  because you have to place more options on one menu-point... :-(

F1 Software USA now open to Public
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Upon the recent completion and conversion of the F1 Software catalogue, I
have now officially become open to the public for trade. F1 Software
contains Amiga titles never before seen in the USA, ranging from games, to
utilities, educational software, musician aids, and many other category's.

The catalogue is freely downloadable, both in a HTML format, and
Amigaguide, from http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/f1software/index.html and
comes complete with screenshots, full title descriptions, and everything
else you could possibly need to know.

If you would like to contact me, you can do so by email at
mushypd@redrose.net or by telephone at (717) 367 6210. My postal address is
on the webpage, and placed through-out the catalogue.

Thanks for your time.

For those who have/havent downloaded my catalogue disk of F1 titles, it can be
obtained from http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/f1software/

If you have already got the catalogue and are experiencing problems with text
width on the Amigaguide format, the fixed version was uploaded about 5 minutes
ago.

In the next day or two, i'll provide a complete list of AMOS titles that will
benefit the programmer, not just a list of games. There are some interesting
AMOS tools in the collection.

Until we meet again!

Greets!

How would I go about making a telnet client in AMOS Pro? And would I need
some sort of extra library to deal with the TCP stack?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

X-Status: 

Hello there!
-
  I am trying to get an amos program that can open up the TCP/IP
port and connect to IRC, I also need procedures with this to send
messages to the channel window, op/deop people, kick ban and all
the usual options of IRC. This would act as an Amos bot shell that
I could do up in the a full blown amos bot for personal use. If
you live in England there is a small amount of money envolved if
you can get this done say 5 if it's good enough. Other countrys
sorry if you can do this it'll have to be for free :)
  BTW : Anyone got any articles for Amiga Information Online (AIO)
or any adverts selling or wanting something? Even an advert for the
amos mailing list :) if someone wants to whip one up :) Well cya
around! BTW: You'll have to email me direct as i'm not subscribed
to the Amos list as BBS email access doesn't allow heavy mail flow
and I know how much you amos guys love to chat :)
-
  Well see you all on IRCnet #am!ga (my own channel) or #amos
look out for Cool96 or c96^iFd - Yup thats right Mushy you know
me already :) how about some more tutorials? and i'll do some stuff
for you :)

 Hi AxeEx.

 I think I have the same Amiga magazine, or one similar, where they said that they were NOT making an AGA extention, and that they were leaving it to 3rd parties...

 Or they said it was a mabye.. Either way, no such extension was ever released (to my knowledge).. Pity.

Well it actually just allowed Amos to run on an AGA machine.
Prior to the patches, the display might, or might not be
formed correctly. (Although, IIRC, bouncing AMOS front and
back a few time would usually catch it eventually.)
The patches were for AMOS 1.36, and AMOS Pro 1.12. The 2.0
Pro patch with the compiler included the same fix for AGA.

If you really need one of these, and can't find it elsewhere,
let me know, and I can send it your way. Mush's site comes to
mind, although they used to be on aminet. The Wierd Science
AMOS PD CD (Vol 1, at least) has them, too.

Later,
-Richard

Get the rfc about telnet from the net, then get the GUI extension.

It was on the night of 09-Feb-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, AceEx jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop
shouting about "Amos Pro Patch?" until I was forced to knock them out:
»-> I just read in an OLD swedish Amiga magazine (-93)
»-> that Europress released a free update for Amos Pro
»-> to support AGA and A1200/4000 and a couple of bugfixes.
»-> Does anyone know if this update can be found anywhere
»-> on the net (if it even exists).
»-> I looked in Aminet but i didn't find anything there though.

The only update from Europress that I know of, comes with the AMOSPro
Compiler, and fixes AMOSPro to make it V2.00. This comes with the compiler,
and is *NOT* freeware. You have to buy the compiler. I do sell it, if you need
it.

Okay. I've done that now, and where can I get a direct explanation about
the RFCs for Telnet? I've found some stuff, but its very vague if you know
what I mean.

Now, as for the GUI extension, I d/l it (of course, heh) and have been
playing around with it a making some strange interfaces, but that's another
story, heh. When you said that, did you mean just for the GUI aspect? or
for its TCP stack commands (which it says are beta in the demo code, and
theres no documentation on it - do I have the wrong vers or something?!?).

What I've managed to do so far is I made a general gui for it (of course)
and screwed around with it a bit by making it opening a connection to a MUD
that I know of. It connected to it, but then I kept receiving 1s? and when
I tried to make it receive more than just 1 bit at a time, my computer
crashed. What the hell am I screwing up here?


Now, onto a little thing I noticed in the gui extension... how come the Gui
Title command doesn't actually exist?!? Is the command spelt differently?
or once again I ask do I have the wrong vers? The one I have is 1.62 BTW.

I just read in an OLD swedish Amiga magazine (-93)
that Europress released a free update for Amos Pro
to support AGA and A1200/4000 and a couple of bugfixes.
Does anyone know if this update can be found anywhere
on the net (if it even exists).
I looked in Aminet but i didn't find anything there though.

It was on the night of 08-Feb-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Ryan jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting
about "RE: Re: Telnet" until I was forced to knock them out:

»-> Okay. I've done that now, and where can I get a direct explanation about
»-> the RFCs for Telnet? I've found some stuff, but its very vague if you know
»-> what I mean.

go to this FTP site:

ftp.u-net.com/rfc/   (or /pub/rfc) and download the index listing. You should
fine what you want there.

»-> Now, as for the GUI extension, I d/l it (of course, heh) and have been
»-> playing around with it a making some strange interfaces, but that's
another
»-> story, heh. When you said that, did you mean just for the GUI aspect? or
»-> for its TCP stack commands (which it says are beta in the demo code, and
»-> theres no documentation on it - do I have the wrong vers or something?!?).

Using them both in your programs gives you an excellent advantage, especially
with the compiler patch.

»-> What I've managed to do so far is I made a general gui for it (of course)
»-> and screwed around with it a bit by making it opening a connection to a
MUD
»-> that I know of. It connected to it, but then I kept receiving 1s? and when
»-> I tried to make it receive more than just 1 bit at a time, my computer
»-> crashed. What the hell am I screwing up here?

Not sure. Could be a mis-placed command.

»-> Now, onto a little thing I noticed in the gui extension... how come the
Gui
»-> Title command doesn't actually exist?!? Is the command spelt differently?
»-> or once again I ask do I have the wrong vers? The one I have is 1.62 BTW.

The command should be GUI TITLES, which is one of the few guide bugs I already
fixed in the new version. The guidefile for the TCP commands are available
from Giark, who is also supposed to be vastly improving the guide (with
examples) for the next release of the extension.

Hi there, once again!
I have coded a little  scroll-text for a videoproject for one of my friends.
I call the scroll-routine with
Every 1  Proc ...
The problem is that it is very unstable on his Amiga - after a few secs. the
scroller just stops (main program continues but the every-routine isn't called
anymore). But on my Amiga it usually first stops after approx 5 minutes.
That makes it very difficult for me to debug.
Do any of you know what can trigger every to stop...?

I have found out this:

All waits will halt the main program
If an instruction lasts more than 1 vbl (ie a big screencopy) then the
every-proc wan't be called until the instruction has finished.

But I can't in any way trigger an every to just stop... It just happens
sometimes. :-(

My programs contains no "every off" cmds, the only "every" is located before
the main loop - and the procedure looks like this:

Procedure EVR
  Shared SCRY,SCRSPD
  Add SCRY,SCRSPD
  Screen To Front SCRY and 1
  Screen Offset SCRY and 1,,(SCRY and $1FF)/2
  If(SCRY and $1FF)<SCRSPD*2
    Screen Swap SCRY and 1
  End If 
  Every On 
End Proc

I can't see it is anyway possible not to use every... HEEEELP!!!

Do any of you know how to open a screen without reserving memory for it (i.e.
so you can view the contents of a chip bank)
If this is possible then I will be able to use an AMAL instead of Every in the

Where can I read documentation about the Screen Base format?

Ummm, you can't ??

I can tell you how to copy information from chip directly onto the screen if
thats what you mean ?

Rom kernal manuals.  SOME of the info is in some of the aminet C programming
guides.  My info is missing, sorry.  I'll see if I can dig it up for you.

No, that would be far too slow. It is a scroll-text - and it has to scroll 1
frame.
By the way my program takes up 1.9MB chipmem - so I have no extra chip-memory
at all.
If I could somehow force AMOS to open all it's screens right after to each
other in the chip mem then I would have no problems (so that i could threat
all the screens as one big screen).
Perhaps just using a freshly rebooted amiga would do it...

- Well.. I think that amos uses its own format for the screen-information
(they have only reserved 6 longwords for screen pointers (STUUUPID europress)
- the Amiga-system reserved 8 longwords from the very beginning)

I don't think that any rom-manuals will contain amos-specific information :)

By using every 1:
If the time it takes to do the rest is less than 1 vbl every will be
ok - if it takes more than 1 you're gonna run into problems. It may
work for you and not him becasuse you have a newer (A1200/A4000) amiga
so it would be faster. Try increasing to Every 2 so the Amos code gets
more time. Why do you want to use every for a scroller anyway?
Perfectly smooth results are obtainable without Every - mail if you
want some examples.

The official rfc gives the protocol for connections, etc. Use a search for
telnet rfc and get it.

Yes, for the tcp commands. They are very good. I wrote most of the
documentation on them so far (now it's in Mush's hands) and he has the .guide
file of just tcp commands, as does Pietro.

Typo in the .guide file.

It's actually Gui titles. I told Pietro about it and I hope Mush caught that
error.

Heh, lets blow away some of those Blitz projects, and get our language out

I don't understand what you mean "the rest"...?
The every-proc scrolls the screen (with screen offset) - and the main program
draws the text on the screen.

It doesn't help. And by the way it has to scroll every frane.

>more time. Why do you want to use every for a scroller anyway?

I couldn't see how else to do it.
I am scrolling the text 3/4 of a scanline every frame on an interlaced screen.
That way I need two screens - one containing the odd quarters of scanlines,
and one containing the even ones.
I have to swap between the screens every vbl - and so amal won't be usable.
The text is written using some screen-blocks (i don't know the
colourfont-format - can any of you help?) - and the pasting routine is too
slow to be finished in one vbl. Especially because of the bug in amos making
it impossible to past any blocks more than 65536 bytes from upper left corner
of the screen :-(
I can't see it is possible without Every. :-(

>Perfectly smooth results are obtainable without Every - mail if you

I know how to create nonlaced scrollers in few colours.
The problem is that i have to call a routine every vbl (to swap the screens) -
and is that possible without Every...???

On braneloc's interesting subject, IIRC there is an article in one of the
AMOSZine issues (I remember reading it as I now sell them) with plenty of
details on making library calls from AMOS. It was more of a tutorial than
anything.

Perhaps Mr. Gibson can enlighten me which issue it appeared in.  ;)

Later today, I hope to cap off the first private Beta release of my
Mailinglist Maintainer software, which allows you to run a full-blown
interactive mailinglist. All it requires is a POP3 account to use for mails.

The program has a nice GUI interface, and is configurable with the minimum
of time. All you have to do, is set the commands which you want active,
type out your texts for subscribe etc., and your off.

If you are interested in testing the software, please email me at
mushypd@redrose.net and I will send you the archive, with some doc files.
Please read the docs, as they will explain some of the already-in bugs etc.
and what doesnt work etc.

Thanks

Hmm, the discussion at the moment is getting 68000 code running in AMOS via
library calls (Braneloc) which looks very very promising indeed, so you might
be able to use some C stuff in there. As for books to reccomend, try looking
for the following in Borders (or www.amazon.com):

Tricks of the Game Programming Guru's  (Andre Lamothe) (CD)
Amazing 3D games (Cant find the book for the auther) (CD)
Gardens of Imagination (The Waite Group) (Floppy)

Hope that helped! The 3 above books mainly cover C, but completely explain it
all. The top book is highly advanced, even more than the others, and all 3
come with an examples disk (either CD or floppy).

 nice idea since there is no better way to learn than by studying others

Mal's Map Editor    (F1-080) 1 Disk

I wrote this map editor for my own use, and have not stopped using it for
all my games since. It can be used for any type of program ie: Puzzle,
scrolling, multi level and single screen level games. And as you will
see from the examples included on the disk, you are only limited by your
imagination!!!!. Obstikle, F1-076 was written using it.

          o Professional user interface
          o Very easy to use
          o Ability to super impose one map on top of another
          o Maps can be any size 1000*1000 screens and more!!!
          o Edit tile values for triggerd tile effects
          o Icon grid and map grid overlay for precise editing
          o Ability to view tile values super imposed onto map
          o Loads of example programs
          o Example tiles and sprites for you to use (copyright free!)

Also!, just to show you the type of game you can use the editor for, I
have included, what is just about a full Dizzy type adventure game  for
you to play and look at.

            * Amos or Amos Pro required to use the example code *

                    * * RATED 78% Amiga Shopper July 95 * * "MME is a
powerful util that no self-respecting programmer should be without"

Image Compressor    (F1-083) 1 Disk

The Image Compressor is aimed at all AMOS programmers. It is a simple
utility to compress and convert images into different formats.  It was
written to replace the IFF Compactor that is supplied with AMOS
Professional. In my version you can squash and Powerpack ABK images.
The main limitation with the IFF Compactor was that you could only
convert IFF files to ABK, you couldn't do the reverse. Supports Batch
Conversion, allowing you to select many files to operate on in
one go. Built in Palette editor supporting Copy/Spread/Swap. Pack
as screen or bitmap using Squash or Powerpacker. On Line help,
Amigaguide docs and tutorial files. Also includes the Amos Pro source
code.

Also included on this disk are two Amos Pro Accs:

BANK MANAGER:
------------- This little utility was written to make games programmers
life easier. All AMOS programmers will know that music, graphics and
sound are stored in  files called memory banks.  Before, the programmer
had to move and organise all the banks using the direct mode. This
program was written with the  intention of removing that.  Arranging
and combining memory banks is a simple matter of pointing and clicking,
it should take no time to pick up. Tutorial/docs/Source code included.


INSERT PALETTE:
--------------- This is a simple accessory for AMOS Professional that
will allow you to  insert Palette commands with all the corresponding
hexadecimal values into  your source code, just using the mouse!  This
program needs to be executed  from AMOS Pro's User menu.  When it is
selected, a palette editor will  appear over your source code.  It
is then a simple matter to alter the  palette and click OK. Tutorial/
docs/Source code included.

The Intuition Extension V1.3a    (F1-120) 1 Disk

Straight  from the USA, this wicked Intuition extension for Amos has
been a well kept secret from the Amos world for quite a while now.
Unless you are a  regular to the Aminet (Dev/Amos) or on the Internet
Amos Mailing list, I doubt  very  much  if you have even heard of this
great extension.  In some ways  it is similar to Intos, that is in its
ease of use, on the other hand Intos  is very slow compared to this and
the IE is a REAL extension and NOT just  a  set of procedures.  So, if
you want professional looking Workbench style programs in Amos this is
the one to get. Works with both Classic and AMOSPro.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Dialogue Procedures V4.0         (F1-114) 1 Disk

Another  treat  for Amos users.  These procedures were designed and
written to  allow the user to incorporate a fully working button
interface in their AMOS programs.  The main advantage about using these
procedures is that you do  not  need  to install a separate extension,
and also you do not need to address  the  Workbench  Intuition System,
so that makes it a lot easier to create  fully  working screens with
simple command procedures.  As an added bonus  the  system  works  a
LOT faster than operating intuition from Amos using  an  extension.
All the bits that you would expect are included like windows, 3D boxes.
file requester etc.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Basically, what you have heard is a large new extension designed to
let you easily get at many of the interesting and useful parts of the
operating system.

In English, this means WINDOWS, AGA graphics, proper WORKBWNCH
support.

This extension offers

Over about two hundred new commands (I haven't bothered to count, but
there's alot....).

Full control of Workbench Windows. We're not talking Workbench look-
a-like windows on AMOS screens, we're talking full, proper, multi-tasking,
good-looking Intuition Windows

Full control of Workbench screens, including AGA, HAM-8 all the other
interesting varieties of screens you can't use on AMOS.
This includes support for text (better than AMOS), drawing and changing
palettes.

Proper gadgets to put in your windows. These are drawn and handled by
Intuition and the extension - you just say where and when. By the way,
these are MUCH easier to use than Interface gadgets.

Full support for menus.
This includes checkable items, mutual exclude and hotkeys.

Supports the GadToolsBox program, which makes the design of complex
user interfaces quick and easy. Using this, you can create a fully
working set of screens and windows with nice gadgets, all working, without
typing a line of code! Because coding in AMOS is so fast anyway, you will
be able to write your program faster than in almost any other language.
How fast? The entire examples set for this extension was written in 3
afternoons. Beat that!

You can use the proper system file, font and screen requesters. In
about 3 lines of code.

Replacement of the AMOS file handling system with a totally new one.
This is faster (3-20 times faster...), and vastly more logical and
efficient.

A new font handling system, to replace AMOS's bloody awful one.

Various assorted bug fixes for AMOS, including the equates system
(which now works), and the Merge Ascii menu item which exhibited possibly
the strangest bug I've EVER seen...

Commands allowing you to use exec lists.
Don't know what this means? Enjoy.

Useful little utilities, such as the one that generates code letting
you easily use procedures from the system libraries (sort of an ad hoc
extension creator).

HUGE manual in AmigaGuide form, including 13 tutorials covering
almost every aspect of the extension.

Examples of programs, most of which actually LOOK GOOD and DO USEFUL
things. Bit of a break for normal AMOS extensions...

Obviously lots more...

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Well, I hope that you find these usefull. Later.

Hi all - I'm about to attempt the (daft?) impossible and get a small
Wolfenstein type thingy going - mainly just for something to do also
to see if I can do it. Its not really the be all and endall mind - 
I've exams to take care off and I'm leaving the country (and all
forms of computers) straight after wards. Anyway ... 
I've got the wall stuff pretty much figured outin my head - I'm mainly
using  ray casting. What I can't work out is
the floor textures. ie Say the player is facing 60degree offset - how
to draw the angled floor pattern. Also could anyone who has tried and
succeeded/failed with similar projects give me any tips before I get
halfway, discover my code is crap and then start again. ie are
integers ok? floats too slow? fast scaling routines, enemy code, is
Amos ok? I know some C/C++ and pc asm (wonderful!) but no 68k asm.
Should I stick with amos for this one or hit the books? Also any
recommended books? Thanks in advance for any help recieved!

if you think it doesnt apply to you, as you might find something which will
interest you.

I mentioned a few days ago that I would place a list of AMOS guides etc.
here from the titles which I have in the F1 range. Just to keep you on your
toes, here ya go. Note that these titles are also available from Phil
Wilkinson (for those who want them in the UK).

These are all titles which I feel may benefit any AMOS user here (skilled
or not). If you wish to consult me for purchasing, you can email me at
mushypd@redrose.net, or Phil (In UK) at phil@ware5d.demon.co.uk telling him
I sent you. Please state the disk number/s when contacting.

*NOTE* The following titles will be removed from the collection on April
       1st, so if you want them, order them now as they will never be made
       available again.

Mal's Map Editor    (F1-080) 1 Disk

I wrote this map editor for my own use, and have not stopped using it for
all my games since. It can be used for any type of program ie: Puzzle,
scrolling, multi level and single screen level games. And as you will
see from the examples included on the disk, you are only limited by your
imagination!!!!. Obstikle, F1-076 was written using it.

          o Professional user interface
          o Very easy to use
          o Ability to super impose one map on top of another
          o Maps can be any size 1000*1000 screens and more!!!
          o Edit tile values for triggerd tile effects
          o Icon grid and map grid overlay for precise editing
          o Ability to view tile values super imposed onto map
          o Loads of example programs
          o Example tiles and sprites for you to use (copyright free!)

Also!, just to show you the type of game you can use the editor for, I
have included, what is just about a full Dizzy type adventure game  for
you to play and look at.

            * Amos or Amos Pro required to use the example code *

                    * * RATED 78% Amiga Shopper July 95 * * "MME is a
powerful util that no self-respecting programmer should be without"

Image Compressor    (F1-083) 1 Disk

The Image Compressor is aimed at all AMOS programmers. It is a simple
utility to compress and convert images into different formats.  It was
written to replace the IFF Compactor that is supplied with AMOS
Professional. In my version you can squash and Powerpack ABK images.
The main limitation with the IFF Compactor was that you could only
convert IFF files to ABK, you couldn't do the reverse. Supports Batch
Conversion, allowing you to select many files to operate on in
one go. Built in Palette editor supporting Copy/Spread/Swap. Pack
as screen or bitmap using Squash or Powerpacker. On Line help,
Amigaguide docs and tutorial files. Also includes the Amos Pro source
code.

Also included on this disk are two Amos Pro Accs:

BANK MANAGER:
------------- This little utility was written to make games programmers
life easier. All AMOS programmers will know that music, graphics and
sound are stored in  files called memory banks.  Before, the programmer
had to move and organise all the banks using the direct mode. This
program was written with the  intention of removing that.  Arranging
and combining memory banks is a simple matter of pointing and clicking,
it should take no time to pick up. Tutorial/docs/Source code included.


INSERT PALETTE:
--------------- This is a simple accessory for AMOS Professional that
will allow you to  insert Palette commands with all the corresponding
hexadecimal values into  your source code, just using the mouse!  This
program needs to be executed  from AMOS Pro's User menu.  When it is
selected, a palette editor will  appear over your source code.  It
is then a simple matter to alter the  palette and click OK. Tutorial/
docs/Source code included.

The Intuition Extension V1.3a    (F1-120) 1 Disk

Straight  from the USA, this wicked Intuition extension for Amos has
been a well kept secret from the Amos world for quite a while now.
Unless you are a  regular to the Aminet (Dev/Amos) or on the Internet
Amos Mailing list, I doubt  very  much  if you have even heard of this
great extension.  In some ways  it is similar to Intos, that is in its
ease of use, on the other hand Intos  is very slow compared to this and
the IE is a REAL extension and NOT just  a  set of procedures.  So, if
you want professional looking Workbench style programs in Amos this is
the one to get. Works with both Classic and AMOSPro.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Dialogue Procedures V4.0         (F1-114) 1 Disk

Another  treat  for Amos users.  These procedures were designed and
written to  allow the user to incorporate a fully working button
interface in their AMOS programs.  The main advantage about using these
procedures is that you do  not  need  to install a separate extension,
and also you do not need to address  the  Workbench  Intuition System,
so that makes it a lot easier to create  fully  working screens with
simple command procedures.  As an added bonus  the  system  works  a
LOT faster than operating intuition from Amos using  an  extension.
All the bits that you would expect are included like windows, 3D boxes.
file requester etc.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Basically, what you have heard is a large new extension designed to
let you easily get at many of the interesting and useful parts of the
operating system.

In English, this means WINDOWS, AGA graphics, proper WORKBWNCH
support.

This extension offers

Over about two hundred new commands (I haven't bothered to count, but
there's alot....).

Full control of Workbench Windows. We're not talking Workbench look-
a-like windows on AMOS screens, we're talking full, proper, multi-tasking,
good-looking Intuition Windows

Full control of Workbench screens, including AGA, HAM-8 all the other
interesting varieties of screens you can't use on AMOS.
This includes support for text (better than AMOS), drawing and changing
palettes.

Proper gadgets to put in your windows. These are drawn and handled by
Intuition and the extension - you just say where and when. By the way,
these are MUCH easier to use than Interface gadgets.

Full support for menus.
This includes checkable items, mutual exclude and hotkeys.

Supports the GadToolsBox program, which makes the design of complex
user interfaces quick and easy. Using this, you can create a fully
working set of screens and windows with nice gadgets, all working, without
typing a line of code! Because coding in AMOS is so fast anyway, you will
be able to write your program faster than in almost any other language.
How fast? The entire examples set for this extension was written in 3
afternoons. Beat that!

You can use the proper system file, font and screen requesters. In
about 3 lines of code.

Replacement of the AMOS file handling system with a totally new one.
This is faster (3-20 times faster...), and vastly more logical and
efficient.

A new font handling system, to replace AMOS's bloody awful one.

Various assorted bug fixes for AMOS, including the equates system
(which now works), and the Merge Ascii menu item which exhibited possibly
the strangest bug I've EVER seen...

Commands allowing you to use exec lists.
Don't know what this means? Enjoy.

Useful little utilities, such as the one that generates code letting
you easily use procedures from the system libraries (sort of an ad hoc
extension creator).

HUGE manual in AmigaGuide form, including 13 tutorials covering
almost every aspect of the extension.

Examples of programs, most of which actually LOOK GOOD and DO USEFUL
things. Bit of a break for normal AMOS extensions...

Obviously lots more...

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Well, I hope that you find these usefull. Later.

Raycasting would be the way to go (hehe, EVERY 3D game out there uses
raycasting (in one form or another), it's just that every type of engine
uses a more complex method than the previous as you move up the line). And,
yes, integers would be the way to go for speed. For accuracy, you can use
floating point (not recommened either way, except for modellers, etc).

You know I'm still working on CBATNAM (heh) and afterwards will be using
the base code for that on my Cafe Engine (lot's of it I'll add to and some
rewritten). The first version will be Wolf-ish, with floor and ceiling
texture mapping, and then hopefully the next few versions will be a combo
of Wolfenstein aND Doom, including Sector-based maps, enemies, and BSP (!)

Anyhow, I have FULL source code for a cool PC 3D engine (ACK-3D), much like
Blake Stone (full Wolfenstein with secret walls, floor and ceiling
tmapping, and more), either Windoze or DOS versions. I could send you
either of these if you like (or both). You can also find a packaged version
of the DOS version on the Web, but I don't have URL handy atm.

This (plus more, including many tutorials) comes from a 3D game programming
book I got awhile back (that was recommended to me by Mush) that includes a
CD that has all of the above that I mentioned. It helped clear up any
questions or misconceptions I had on raycasting and taught me much on the
subject. You might be able to find the book in your area (mail me back if
you want the name of the book or any information (ISBN) on it).

Anyhow, hope all this helps. (Out of curiousity, why exactly are
you undertaking this small project (or what will you use it for))?

On Tuesday 10-Feb-98 at 00:47:50, a nutter named Mush
had wet pants when they typed about `Library calling in AMOS'.

Err,  Sorry  Mush, cant remember off the top of my head. Maybe issue 6
or  7.  I'm  sure I did an index of all source and articles. Check out
Issue 10 and search for it using the search feature :)

I  think  you are talking about the code Andy Smith done for Amoszine,
if so, he used direct calls to the Crunch Mania Library in his code.

It's not the best calling routines I've seen though! I have some great
routines  here which I have written which let you de-crunch files (and
crunch if you want) using direct calls to the CrM.Library.

I also wrote some code which uses direct calls to the PTReplay.Library
to allow Amos to play mods too. I'm sure I gave Mush that code a while
ago....

I'll try and find my direct calls to CrM.Library code and pass that on
too to Mush for his library/website :-)

Just  about  anything in Amos can be done this way. All you have to do
is  get  some  autodocs for the library you want to call. Then, simply
use Areg() and Dreg() calls to the functions you require.

I'm sure even MUI or Reqtools could be got at with some effort :)

Tarra.

Hello..

NOTE: I've finished the shuffle-around on my homepage for now, so it's now 
possible to enter the AMOS section direct..

URL: "http://home8.inet.tele.dk/top_cat/amos/index.htm"

I've also done some rewrite of the extensionlists online, so please drop
by and give me some response on this. Please mail me if you know of some 
extensions that I havn't listed on the site, so I can make the list as
complete as possible :)..

The login for my main section is unchanged (see at the end..)


HELLO MUSH !!! Are you still offering free web-space, and how much, and
what rulez is applied to the space ??? (I'm having some old html pages
on StarTrek TNG that I don't have room for at my current site, after all
10 Mb free space on tele.dk is not very much:(..

      No.  AFAIK, we decided this would be best implemented by Giark
      simply setting #lives to 1 and possibly reducing Bubba's energy to
      half.  This way, the stage programmers didn't need to create a
      stage-specific demo as Giark's method would automatically
      handle all of the stages...

      I could easily create a demo version of the SideShooter stage by
      simply applying that same logic: one life and half-energy.  But, I
      would rather hear from Giark that this is acceptable, before I
      place the demo-version on my webpage...

Yepz, The first one didn't work right with some browsers so I had to change

I don't want any more demo releases, just because I'm very close to the final
compile. You'll just have to wait with bated breath for the CBATNAM release.

Still no transition pictures or anims sent in.

Subject: [AMOSList] CapsLock detect
Status: O
X-Status: 

** To reply in e-mail, remove ".nupkyp" from address **

I am trying to detect the capslock key using key shift command.
However, the program must detect it even if the capslock was on
before the program is started. This is not a problem until I
compile the program. Is this a fault with the compiler? Perhaps
someone can suggest another way?
Thanks

Dunno, I've got a couple that exceeds 700Kb (Source only 100+ Kb banks) and 
no problems as long as the 
buffer is set heigh enough...
(It appears that the alowed length of loops and if-else-endif constructuons
gets smaller when the program grows ??)

Hmm.. firstly, I've not been reading much on the recent
C/C++ talk (on the Extension and some of the messages),
although I assure you I'll go back and read the ones I missed.

Anyhow, some new graphics routines would be nice (and in order),
including some new rendering routines, and with my engine develop-
ment, I could always use some extra C routines I have to speed things
up (without having to put in any unnecessary ASM or writing my own!).

"Who was doing multi-plot"? Hehe, I believe that that was Laurie Curwood
(who's since been off the List and wrote the Falcon Extension, remember?
He's also the one who proposed the List game and then jumped off right
before it's conception and beginnings of development! Drats.)

Anyhoo, I'm in some negotiations in buying out the source code for the
Extension, all the docs, the whole sha-bang and everything from him.

Who was doing the Multi Plot? That would be Laurie, with the Falcon
Extension. He's not here, so if you want it, you'll have to mail me. I
WILL, btw, let everyone know (namely Mush, maybe of interest to him, and
for his F1 library! hehe) when I get it all worked out and get the package.

I've clocked up 100k with only one problem - one loop didn't go back
to it's do. Simple goto fixed that tho'. It compiled ok.

I came close to 64K in my stupid chess game and it did become 
unstable, missing lines out and stuff, all sorts of weird stuff was 
happening.

My source for Lunar Conquest is almost 300k with no troubles. CBATNAM will be
at least that big as well. Just set the size in the config. Mine is currently
set to 350k.

Why doesnt the guy use something like DeliWizard to do all the conversions on

Subject: New AB3D-II Editor version..
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hello everyone..

Just to give you a note on the release of version 2.12 of the Alien Breed
3D-II Leveleditor. You can get it direct from my homepage at this moment
of writing..

NB: I've changed the distribution archive back to LhA after some users
had problems unpacking the LZX files...

As usual any bug-comments and new ideas are welcome, by the way I've been
promised a german locale file for the editor soon. (To the author: The
format of the locale file is NOT changed from V2.11 to V1.12 :-)..


- News in V2.12 (Released: 14-02-1998)
  ! Certain parts of this version is not  running  100%  optimized,  this  is
    proberly most apparent in the programstartup, also the main EXE  file  is
    bigger than needed, this is due to my future plans to convert the  editor
    to run in a true intuition system, and some preparing routines  has  been
    included for testing in this version !!!!!
  - Fixed the sample-replayer temporarely,  now  the  editor  relies  on  the
    external Play16 program to play..
  - Graphics definer now running AGA-256 colours..
  - Graphics definer places Wall-GFX's better on screen..
  - Graphics definer now uses gadgets rather than 'strange' keys..
  - Editor is now compiled with OSDevKit 1.55 for Intuition and system..
  - Help implimented, loads up the relevant section of this guide doc..
    (Currently only working in the drawing functions, just point at the  menu
    and hit 'help'. Help on the setup-part is halted  becouse  I'm  going  to
    move them to intuition screens/windows..)
  - ToolTypes support added to editor.
    'HELP' and 'PREFS' is current active..
  - Set-level-textstrings now opens on intuition screen..
  - 'Check Level' is no longer called from the 'Make Level' as I've had  many
    problems with that function..
  - Calling 'check level' from the menu spoiled the map visualy..
  - 'Check Points' SHOULD work now.. (Third time lucky, I hope)..
  - Fixed a bug in the  'bullet statistics'. The  (in)visible  state  of  the
    bullet was never shown on screen...
  - DT->??? converters had some problems with certain file-formats when using
    'some' versions of 'picture.datatype'. I hope I've found  the  source  of
    that problem.. (NOT tested !!!!)

ENJOY :)

Remembering past arguments etc. we had here, if I remember correctly,

Hiya all,

I've  just  been  informed  that  Amos  is  having problems displaying
Interlace screens on Kickstart 1.3!

Is  this  true?  How  would  I get around showing an interlace picture
(simply  unpacking  an  interlace  picture  to  screen)  if there is a
problem?

This  came  from  Phil  Wilkinson  at  F1 Software. He reported that a
couple  of  Amos programs which open interlace screens seem to be only
opening non-interlace.

The  progs  work  fine on his Kick 3.0 (Commodore A1200), but his Kick
3.1 (Escom) machine does have this problem!

Any idea's anyone?

Email me ASAP if you could...

Many thanx in advance, Andy Gibson

Hello

I'd like know if anyone has an idea how to
"convert" a 24bit RGB value (255,255,255)
to the most matching color index.

Since the palette is known from the start some
sort of precalculating is possible.

I have no idea at all how this would be done
so all help is welcome.

The 24bit as you call it is usualy refered as rgb8 value (8bit pr. colour)..

Anyway, if you by index mean the rgb4 normaly used by amos you simply do a
'/16'
with each colour induvdualy..

To match to an existing palette use a procedure like

Get the existing palette and split it into RGB values..
Scale both sets to the same notification (rgb4 or rgb8)
Find the difference on each af the 3 components and add the DIFFERENCES..
repeat the above for each colour in the palette to find the
colour that is most like (The added-together difference smallest)..

I think I have a procedure somewhere that display it, I can
try and dig it up if you need it.. :)

It does display the screen, it just flashes/jumps up and down.
It can be solved (Atleast minimized) by adjusting the vertical screen
offset value, one problem though, you cant see the first couple of lines
because the offset is to low.

Remember to use unsigned differences ( DIF_R=Abs(R1-R2) )

Also remember that R, G, and B are not equally important
Use sommething like

SUM=DIF_R*3+DIF_G*5+DIF_B

If I remember correctly this are the official factors - also used when
converting
colour-images to B&W.

Yeah, the interlace-bit is for some reason not set - so you can only see the
scanlines with the same parity as the upmost scanline. I.e. with screen offset
,,0 you can see all the even scanlines and with screen offset ,,1 you can see
all odd scanlines.
If it is very important for you to see an interlaced picture in amos, you can

Y=0 : YAD=1
Do
  Add Y,YAD
  If Y=0 or Y=99 : YAD=-YAD : End If
  Screen Offset 0,,Y
  Wait Vbl
Loop

This will scroll the screen - but make it visible :)
Ensure that the upper as well as the lower 100 scanlines are empty.

Well... A well known bug is that you, if you edit the last line of your
program, some weird things happen (i.e. the  line above will be cleared when
tokenizing). Perhaps this is it...?
I have never had troubles with programs growing too big.

Hello! I'd just like to announce I've nearly finished my game called
DISORIENTATION. As the title suggests it's rather confusing at first, anyway
heres a run down.
- It's basically a 2 player Thrust type game but alot faster and with a few
  very strategic weapons!
- It uses a nice split screen and a playfield 4 times bigger than a 
  lowres screen for a bit of real deathmatching (hence the screen clone
  problem :)
- Uncompiled it runs good on a 1200 (unexpanded) and CAN run on an A500, but
  it's pretty dodgy uncompiled, should be good compiled though.
- err The graphics aren't MINDBLOWING but it's damn fun/infuriating!?
  (reminds me of a C64!)

Anyway I'm having a couple of annoying little problems that I'm hoping
there is a solution for.

(1) The second players screen is a screen clone of the first
players screen and it's works really well, except I can't alter the palette
with 'fade' or 'colour' etc. I know it's a clone, but I also know it can
have a different palette. The clones palette is initialized from the source
when it's opened, but after this the colours don't change even if the 
source is changed.
I use the fade command to flash the players screen with differing intensities.

(2) I -nearly- got the game to run with a serial link! But my code is
questionable to say the least. Has anyone done this? Can I 'learn' from your
code?

(3) I'm presuming you need the AMOS 1.35 compiler to compile 
'compatable' AMOSPRO progs as it KILLS the Amiga totally with V1.3
Does the AMOSPRO compiler exist? If it's not for sale anymore can someone
 post it to me? Otherwise I'll hunt down an old cover disk for 1.35!

Well, when I finish it I'll stick the (horrible) source code on my web page
for anyone interested.
It would be good to get some of you to playtest it, I'll inform you 
hardend ruthless types to hack it to pieces when it's finished.

Before I could even begin to comment on a price, i'd have to see a demo
version, or at least some screenshots and examples of what it can do.

Is it going to be written in AMOS, and if so, what extensions are going to
be used. Is it going to use either GUI or OS Devkit to make it compatible on
all amiga's? And more importantly, how would we, the purchaser, benefit from
the program?

I know you say it can do the stuff you mentioned, but how limited will the
software be when it comes to editng/changing existing programs.

Post some specs/screenshots to the list so we can get a better insight into
the program.

Hello..

I'm getting bug-reports on some on my programs that sample-replaying is not
working on 060 amiga's. I've tried to use the old music and DME music
extension as well as calling an external program (play16) to play the
sound but no luck. Any ideas what's wrong ?????

It was on the night of 22-Jan-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was 
silent. Suddenly, Declan_Gorman@modusmedia.com jumped out from behind a rock 
and wouldnt stop shouting about "Re[2]: Negative Values on GUI Sliders" until 
I was forced to knock them out:
»->      
»->      I am setting the values using GadToolsBox, min -50 & max +50.  Should
     
»->      I be using the GUI SET command?
     
Try using the same values in GUI SET, not sure if it will work any better, but 
it might:
     
SLIDER    - Gui Set window,gadget,0,pos (Set Position of Bar)
            Gui Set window,gadget,1,sm (Set Minimum Value of Slider) 
            Gui Set window,gadget,2,mx (Set Max Value of Slider)

Here is an interesting advert I spotted on the Amiga developer network. I
thought it might benefit one or two of you out there:

   DEVELOPER NEEDED - I have received an email from a company in 
Australia, KCS, that is looking for a commercial developer to help them
upgrade their 
keno systems.  The original application was coded in the AMOS environment so
that is 
a "must have" requirement.  In addition, the potential developer must be
able to produce 
high quality graphics and be available for future work as well.  The company
is based in 
Ultimo in Sydney.  For more information, please email <a 
jonathon@whitewolf.com.au   Serious inquiries only 
please.  I also have his phone number if you are serious about working with
him.  
Please be sure to tell him that you saw this information on the ADN.

The DemoVersion of Turbo+ is on aminet.. The last of the freeware versions
was 1.9 and I thought it was availeble at my homepage with the extensionlist,
but I was wrong. You can (hopefuly) download it from my homepage in a few
days (Go to the extensionlist)....

convert all my old programs before I erased the old library... :(

GUI Extension V1.62 is available from my homepages, and Aminet. I also have
the one version slightly older than that, or is it an even older version you
need?

Hi!

Yeah! After 5 years of desolation, now there is a new HOPE! Finally i've
concluded a important bid.... after a long (...about 1 year) dialog with
Francois Lionet i've obtained the AMOS source code!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

No shit! is *true!*

I've *all* the sources from Amos1.23 to AmosPro2.0 and compiler.

Cool eh? :)

The development can restart.... but is a very difficult task! There are
about 3MB(!) of ASM sources *without* docs, and few comments (..in
french) in the code :(((( and so i must spend *a lot* of time for understand
how it works before upgrade it.

About the sources... they are not PD.... AMOS is not PD. Now i'm the
official developer.

There are some legal problems around AMOS.. for this reason the release of
the sources was delayed till now. Actually i'm the only one authorizated to
use the sources... as soon as possible (.. if possible) i'll create a
development team. I've almost obtained the permission for Chris Hodges :)


Ok.. that's all :) Arrggghh... in this moment i'm ill, and my head is
exploding, but my heart is very happy :)

fecking awesome matey! Now, at last, we can be broken from these chains of
silly limitations AGAWise, and blow some serious blitz-users asses away.
Eeee, im so happy, I could pee on the rug.

Nasty. French is a dodgy language - especially if you dont speak it  ;)

Now can I send you this massive wad of AMOS Developer forms that ive been
collectiong over the past few months?

OK, just one suggestion about an update, i'd like to maybe make all the AMOS
developer forms available to the public by constructing a list of the most
commonly asked features, and get users comments etc. I think this is a good
way to start.

Ooooh, I guess this means that AMCAF and Gui Extension comes built-in.
Lurvely.

Heh, I know the feeling. I think im coming down with something myself.

Heh, heres one of my fingers positioned strategically, to add to this <holds

As we all know, the AGA within AMOS definately has to be a must. I agree
with this guy, that it must be made accessible in both a complex, and
simplified way.

One way I think this could be done, is to somehow assign into a variable, a
screenmode ID value, so that from then on when all screens are opened, they
will be opened with the ID specified. Alternatively, if no ID is specified,
then it would default to a regular 15Khz or whataever it is AMOS screens
currently run at.

<chuckle> Oh dear.

I think a DOS version (if any) would be a much better way to go, as 99% of
games are written for DOS anyway. Windows is such a bloated, useless operating
system, wheras with DOS, its still got equally as much power when it comes to
games. Besides which, in DOS mode, stoopid windows wont pop to front with an
"illegal operation" window, and crash all the sounds going thru the
soundcard...

This is a nice way to go around it. I would like for the editor to run on any
screenmode that the user wants to select, and will re-size itself accordingly.
The ability to be able to select the font styles of menus/on-screen text
display would be an extra feature, so you can see more lines of your code at
once. If I need to do that at the moment, I have to go into Interlace mode on
the editor, which slows things down sometimes.

I would really like for the editor to be able to keep all of its current
functions, especially its layout (as its easy to see where things are) and
more so, its cut/copy/paste functions. The ones in Blitz are crap, the bar
doesnt go away when you try to click it again. Nasty.

This is a nice way to completely re-write the so-called Interface coding
commands, and replace them with complete OS commands, and the ability to be
able to use IFF brushes, instead of having all on one screen, and defining
where is what etc. If the entire brush is say, 15x15 pixels, then it should be
able to work that stuff out for itself.

With a full OS compatible version, I imagine there will be some serious
scrolling capabilities in there. Even though I hate blitz, I have
seen some rather spiffing scrolling routines, all of which could probbably be
panned with a bit of work from the new developer team. As for time, i the
AMCAF extension is built into the code, then there are plenty of commands in
there for both time and date.

> I'd like it to be more structured and easier to read (more C-Like)

I quite like the way AMOS lays its code out at the moment, especially how I
can fold lots of procedures nice and easily!

AHI is pretty straight forward to do already. Its possible to do it directly
from an AMOS source code program, but it wouldnt be fast enough to keep the
soundcard fed with enough bytes for it to sound any good.

Nice one! At last! Great!
I now it's no easy task but I think two of the best guys are on it -
role on AGA intuition friendly, faster, leaner, rounder, bouncier,
fluffier (ok stop) AMOS. Finally "Amos" will no longer be a dirty word
for the rest of 'm!

As for Blitz users.... I think the fact that their magazine is called
BUM sums it all up!

Good luck!

Im currently working on a list from the massive number of forms I received
from the "AMOS Developers Form" link on my homepage. There must be at least
100, mostly requiring the one thing. I'll work on it today.

Subject: AMOS Developer Forms - What the Users Want!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: O
X-Status: 

OK, here are those AMOS developer forms. Ive cut and deleted a lot of them,
as they were just small things like "AMOS for AGA", without much else in
there for commenting on. I also removed them from my collection, and just
kept the quality comments.

Can I please just say, because this is such a big file, when making comments
about any of the users forms, please make seperate mails for each of the
forms you wish to reply to. This means, a seperate thread can be maintained
for the seperate forms, plus cuts the need for unwanted amounts of texts.
Thanks.

I have some serious comments to make about some of these forms (when the
mail gets back to me from the list), so will be using the above method. I
hope you all do to.

Also, please direct ALL responses to the list, as this is definately going
to be a hot topic for quite a while yet. Seeing as AMOS will be getting the
new stuff, we need to explain/debate/argue over what should/shouldnt be
added/removed, so lets not waste any more time and get on those bloody
forms!!

Just to tell you whats going on (if you havent been to the form on my
homepage), the COMPARISON section of the mail, is where I asked the user to
compare AMOS to other languages, such as Blitz Basic, ASM and C etc. The
IMPROVEMENTS section is what the user would like to see in AMOS (either
Version 3, or an extension), but seeing as its being updated, I think its
worth trying to get most of it into the main thing.

Enjoy!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison:Amos is the first language (exc. Amiga Basic) I have used, and I
now dabble with C and Asm also..

Improvements:Full support for AGA hardware ... simplified for beginners,
but open ened enough to allow expert users full access. Support for all
OS2 libraries (inc. easy structured variable support) and for other
libraries eg. MUI etc. Faster ! (Can`t live without Turbo etc.) More OS
integration, but possibly ability to turn OS "off" to get better speed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvements:I would like to see the development of an extension that would
delve deeper into different devices, allowing for more and varied control. I
would also like to see smaller compiled programs if possible. improving the
serial commands would be nice so that one might be able to control a
different serial port such as the squirrelscsi etc.

It would be nice to be able to show and control all the various types of
picture formats, and music formats. How about a 'continue' button to allow
better tracing of programs. A toggle switch for the editor that would allow
you to switch to arexx or dos might be an idea along with the commands for
each in meneaus

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison:Previously used Turbo C++, Amos is much nicer to program in.
Maybe ad a speech recognition extension for Amos Pro.

Improvements:I would like to know if there is an extension available for
speech recognition using Amos_Pro.  If not I will appreciate it if someone
could please support me with the source code.  I'm using Techno Turbo 2 for
a sound sampler, And it mentions that you can use it for speech recogniton
using amos code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: It is very easy to make advanced multimedia production in it

Improvements:  A DOS och Windows 95 version as soon as possible. I don't use
my Amiga so much nowadays.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: Worse-No true AGA support/no definable data types(structs,enum)
no case/switch-no WB Support

Improvements:AGA SUPPORT!!!Even better, Graphics boards(RTG).MUST also
support user definable data typing like C or Pascal (or any other modern
language for that matter).
Intuition support integrated within AMOS. Overhaul or just kill amos
interface.
Basic update on all included utilities.

PersonalComments:I used to love working in AMOS until I started using C/C++.
If  AMOSpro was seriously updated, I'd try it again. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: It's cool, because it let's you visualise/test an idea in nano
seconds, compared to C/ASM

Improvements:True AGA support.

chunky2planar support for 6-8 bitplane mode...

amos sources should work in ascii mode, I just trashed a huge amos source,
because of one bit, changing in the file... and then amos won't read the
source... suxx!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvements:
well.. of course here is the list that is a must for the new year!
1: Texture Mapping(direct68881 support), 2:lightwave object support!
3: A WORKING octamed/med/pro lib 3: sinangular and cosinangular scrolling!!!
4: direct Polygon coupling 5: faster screen draw
6: FINALLY a SMART compiler that determines the command and the fastest
assembly rotine for it!!

 1 and 2 and 5 are a MUST , I NEED HELP!! My inside amos routines will never
win me a demo contest!
besides, i don't have time or time or even time for assembly UNLESS !!
AHHHH the ultimate,,, Write Ultra quick text edito to assembler codes ie
assembly name (CopyMeMQuick(a0,a1,d0)) or something like that
Amos Command  (Copy Mem Quick start,start+len to dest)
PLEASE do that too.. it would be Extremly An Excellent addon also

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison:I think that AMOS is a very good BASIC language, far earier to
use and learn than AMIGA BASIC and others.  The speed is not as fast as it
could be, but it's a small trade off for the power of AMOS.

Improvements:I would like to see better music support.  Maybe it's just me
but I've had trouble combining music and sound effects in AMOS.
I like the TURBO extension and I like the idea of PowerBobs extension (if
only they would send me the registeres version I payed for).
I would like to see AGA (naturally), support for complex data structures,
and better control of the Blitter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison:quick, easy but not as fast as it can be

Improvements:I would like to see; full AGA support, jpg and gif support,
being able to run 2
or more Amos programs at the same time (well, at least I hope), faster
execution. I don't use extensions because some I tried made my AMOS setting
unreliable, causing crashes with no reason. And I personally prefer AMOS
screen, I don't want it to be another Blitz Basic. Simplicity of AMOS is
its biggest power.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: is the best basic language I have seen in my life

Improvements:    The thing I would like the most is for amos to be able to
display aga hires graphics(ham8).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: Easy to use editor,

Improvements:  I would see a powerup compiler(phase5),grapics board
support,ahi.

I think this is too much too ask for but that is what i want:)
Because I'm think C is too time consumming too get results
and too hard too lear....

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvements:  Faster Graphics routines, 3D-Stuff with GaroudShading and
Texturemapping and 24Bit-Copperchunky - GFX-Card Support and AGA-Support -
FUll CD-Rom-Support - full Intuitionsupport and a better Interfacelanguage
(the 8-pixel-boundary sucks!) - AHI support is important too.

A 18-BitScreenmode should be emulated with a little help from ham8 and
Copper :-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: Very easy to use but has great facilities, especially with the
extensions. Blitz Basic is also good. I have has hardly any experince in
E, and C.

Improvements:  Full Operating System Compliant, like InTos. Extra commnds
such as the disc support with Craft. Public screen mode, AGA support, More
use of Fast ram. (ie arrays use chip ram, as I am always limited to say
4000, even though I have 8 Mb!). PowerPC Support for the new compiler.
Internet Support. Graphic card support. etc,etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: BlitzBasic: In AMOSPRO Its easier to make good games, But
there's no AGA!

Improvements:  Easy datatype support, and music support (load and play MP3
for example)

Different anim/video formats like AVI,MOV and so on... with easy commands of
course.

Intuition is a must!

Utility programs which make lifes a lot easier.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: I would like amos to have an AGA upgrade

Improvements:  The ability to open public screens and utilise the AGAS
chipset would be a great advantage in Amos

The removal of the default screen and the addition of REAL multitasking
would be a great addition.

The addition of all the Extension commands As Standard would be very usefull

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: AMOS is difficult to debug because the debugger does not have
much functionality. For some reason, it is also shakey under KS3.1 but works
fine under 3.0

Improvements:  I would like the user interface to be a standard workbench
screen with standard menu layouts. Also, I believe that there is some
incompatability between AMOS-Pro2 and KS3.1 because after running my code
for about 5 mins, it crashes under 3.1, but runs 24hrs/day 7days/week under
3.0. I'm doing some AMAL, but not much, and the only OS-specific stuff I'm
doing is reading the current time from the system clock (but I don't set
it) I'd like it to be a more standard product so that it is less system
specific. I'd like to see a smooth horizontal scrolltext extension (since
these are often done in games and elsewhere) which is independant of the
number of screens and other AMAL code.

I'd like it to be more structured and easier to read (more C-Like)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: AMOS is the language which makes it possible to realize my ideas
in an easy and efficient way!

Improvements:  Future AMOS-versions should introduce public AGA- and
gfx-card-screens, it should support AHI and Protracker/DigiboosterPro !

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: Doesn't crash so often as @@!$* Blitz 2.1 !!

Improvements:
* Intuition Support, Full AGA support and support for Multi-sync Monitor
  Modes.
* Support for One, Standardised Graphics Card, or all through the same
  commands and interface.
* DOOM and AMCAF built into a AmosPro 3.0
* PowerPC Version... Amiga had got to go PPC to survive.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: I like it becouse it's easy to use, but it's not as powerfull as
I want it to be.

Improvements:  I'd like to see a new version of the gfx extension with      

promotion for the AGA
chip set. And a better support for PT mods for example volume fade and
abillity to play a
sample in a, for the moment, unused channel with out breaking the music
totaly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: Compile progs are too slow, but the programming is great!

Improvements:  I'd want to see Amos for PowerPC (but still compiling for
68000 also), and Amos that compiles properly to create reasonably fast code.

A new Amos should be (largely) backward compatible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: Its a Brilliant editor with loads of tools to speed your work
up. All the specialised Bob/Sprite commands help alot too.

Improvements:  AGA and graphics card support. I use AMCAF for its fast
function such as QSqr and Qcos etc.

However, these have restrictions and become unreliable with high numbers.
Therefore I think both sorts of versions should be in any new version of
AMOS. Both reliable and fast. Load GIF, Load JPEG.
More control over screen drawing. Especially drawing Bobs. Both the simple
commands and more detailed ones which would do very small steps at a time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: Blitz editor sucks.  Blitz can't handle forward declarations.

Improvements:  Letsee, AGA to start, retargetable audio, retargetable
graphics, errr, loads of other stuff, better structures, faster code(!),
PPC support (well, when PPC finally arrives)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison: on p.c. I know C++, Pascal, RmCobol; on Ami only Amos; but the
only thing that I wont to note is that I started programming using Amos the
creator and I think that is a great language to start (and maybe to go on
with AmosPro).

Improvements:   why not implement a function that let play audio trac from a
CD: have You ever seen games like sega rally champonship for p.c., well it
would be great (I think for me and for who programs games) if a function let
chose the trac of an inserted CD and then play it: it can replace the audio
mods.

     I reckon that is the best AMOS news we have heard in quite some time.  
     Good luck and I am sure you will do us proud.

Go Pietro!!!
As it seems like we have some sort of development of amos once again (yeah
:-))))))) ) then it would be a good idea if we made a collection of known bugs
in AMOS.
I am really sorry, but I am to go to the army :-( so I will not have time in
the next few months (only at home in weekends) to run such a thing, but If
somebody here on the list would make some order in it then it would be really
great (If not, then I'll be back in approx. 3 months).

Perhaps we could also start discussing i.e. how to solve the AGA problem (i.e.
there is only room for 6 bitplanes in the screen structure (stuuupid
europress)).
Or how to solve the compiler/interpreter-differences-problem (that the
compiler and interpreter behaves differently in some aspects).
I suggest that the compiler should be remade to work like the interpreter.

Here is the bugs that I could just come up with. - they are written without
any thinking, and I'll probably come up with more bugs after thinking a bit :)

Sorted after:
- Interpreter bugs
- Compiler bugs (things that work differently in interpreter and compiler)
- Editor bugs
- Speedy things (not really bugs)
Bugs seperated with +++

+++ INTERPRETER BUGS: +++

N=0 : Add N,Int(1.1) : Print N
(result: -2147483583)

+++

The cursor appears again (after curs off) when executing an Input (you have to
Set Curs 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 to remove the cursor definitely)

+++

"For..Next" and floats is a very bad combination.
For I#=0.0 to 10.0 : Print I# : Next I#
does only count to 9.
If double precision is set then it goes all wrong: The loop repeats forever
when I# reaches 1.0 :-(

+++

Hires-screens can't be overscanned to the right of 336 (hardware coordinate)

+++

Icon pasting and block pasting doesn't work farther away from upper left
corner of the screen than 65536 bytes. (i.e. on a 640 pixels wide screen you
can't past icons below line 819)

+++

Randomize doesn't work at all
For I=0 to 9 : Randomize 42 : Print Rnd(9) : Next I
Should print 10 identic numbers, but the numbers are different.

+++

The pattern number in Track Play doens't work - it always start from the
beginning.

+++

X Hard and Y Hard dont work correctly if the screen offset isn't 0,0
Y Hard(Y Screen(0)) should always return 0, but the screen offset is returned.
(Y Hard(0) returns the coordinate of the upper left corner and not the
coordinate of (0,0))

+++

"Every" is too unstable too be used for anything

+++

Almost all editor cmds (Call Editor) moves the Editor Screen to Back :-(

+++ COMPILER BUGS: +++

This program should explain itself:
 Trap Read G
 Read G$
 Print G$
 Data "You have compiled the program!"
 Data "The program is NOT compiled :)"

+++

This program doesn't work compiled:
 Do 
   Trap Read A$,B$
   If Errtrap : Restore : Read A$,B$ : End If 
   Print A$,B$
 Loop 
 Data 'Hi there','yeah'
 Data 'This is AMOS','just AMOS'

+++

On Break Proc doesn't work in compiled progs (the proc isn't called - nothing
happens when the user tries to break the program)

+++

"Cli Program To Run In The Background = False" doesn't work when "Amos To Back
Upon Booting = True"

+++ EDITOR BUGS: +++

The editor Indention indents wrong when an If..Else..Endif is located on one
line.

+++

Try to hide a program with the name
(SS6).AMOS
and see what the menu looks like

+++

Try to test this program:
 Dim A(5,5)
 Read A(5)
 Data 5
You will see, that the test returns OK even though the dimension is wrong. If
you  run the program, AMOS crashes.

+++

You can only have 19 options in the user menu

+++ SPEEDY THINGS: +++

Swap A,B
is /SLOWER/ than
TEMP=B : B=A : A=TEMP
after compilation

+++

Extension calls are too slow.
I.e.
A=(Peek(B) xor 128)-128
is faster than
A=Speek(B)
with
SPEEK:
  move.l (a3)+,a0
  move.b (a0),d2
  extb.l d2
  rts

     Are they any general tests you guys do with your code to verify that 
     everything you have done should work and as a result the problems 
     encountered are a bug in AMOS or the extensions used?
     
     I have a problem with a program I am coding that involves a lot of 
     memory poking and peeking.  When I manually poke and peek at the 
     addresses I know are correct, I get the correct results.  The exact 
     same poking and peeking in my program does not give the correct 
     results.  I have gone through the code numerous times, verified the 
     memory address and all the usual but still cannot work out why I am 
     getting what I do.
     
     Also, does the amount of dimensioned arrays have any effect on the 
     running of a program?  This program in particular uses approximatley 
     500.
     
     I am using AMOS Pro V2.0 and the only extension used in this case is 
     GUI.  Any help would be appreciated.
     
     Declan.

 I am not alone so :). Francois said me that this fact must be 'secret' ...
I think that this is wrong for you so.

 I believe you.

  For my part, I've stopped the ASM updated because of the work to be done,
but if you want to work with someone, users can have and the GUI and th OS
DevKit better parts :). But, I am still develop something quite similar to
AMOS but portable.

I'm posting a quick-list of the extensions I know about, and hope that
YOU will fill in informations about unlisted extensions, course I
don't know anything about them.......

      That's not quite accurate... I have been doing some DOS-oriented
      programming (although fortunately, my games and such work 
      fine in Windows 95), and was surprised to find that everything is
      going to Windows. Most new commercial PC games are being
      developed for Windows, using either DirectX or OpenGL.

      True, but that's possibly caused by the games/applications, not
      Windows.  Windows is simply trapping errors, such as memory-
      corruption (ie. writing to memory you have no claim to), etc.

      Anyway, after I finish my current PC game, I suppose I'll need to
      check into DirectX programming... I think there are only about
      50MB or so of files required to set-up the DirectX development...

      I expect I'll be spending several months writing wrappers around
      all of the DirectX modules (a bit obscure from the small bit I've
      seen), to create a usable development-system.

Well, your developer thingy was nice, but a bit repetitive. As if AGA is NOT
going to be on the top of the list!

Anyway, here's my first run ideas of what AP3 needs to do:
- AMOS editor MUST be a regular intuition screen, but must NOT change its
method of operation.
- Fix the stupid interlace bug under WB3+
- Integrate GUI Extension as part of regular AMOS
- Make optimized versions for different processors
- Add A$=Word$(<string>,WORD) command (rexx-like)
- Proper STDIO commands (byte or line, no waiting for return all the time!)
- Proper iconify (using a def_icon.info that could be changed by the user,
since it's just an icon)
- Compiler has options to compile processor specific code

These ones would do better in an extension
- AHI/MP3 support
- GFX Card support
- PowerPC support
- C2P/Raytracing commands
- Lightwave object support
- Advanced (in the guts) AGA support

Well met and godspeed,

Same here!

I'm making a little wishlist of features, but the only thing I WILL 
ask is that the system requirements be kept as low as possible.
Like, when (not IF I hope :), AGA support is put into amos, it will 
still work on non-aga machines! 

Keep us posted!

What problems? Are they still a problem (as in releasing modified 
version)?

How about a beta testing/features team? (Puts up hand)

I'm going to make a wish-list tonight, but the first thing I want is 
to make sure that AMOS will always run with a minimal system.
Eg, When (not if I hope...) AGA support is built in, AMOS wont need a 
AGA system to run. And also I would love a set of standard GUI 
routines that will work with OS 1.3!

Great, then we won't have 50 people making various versions of AMOS, but what
about upgrades. PD as before or does one has to register da shit one more
time ???..

Right on. If there's an area where I can do some good then count me in on
the team (I could take the IO_devices extension (PRO) under treatment, if 
I only had the newest source-code for it (After all I've allready hacked
part of the code to get 'printer dump' to run.. :)

>Ok.. that's all :) Arrggghh... in this moment i'm ill, and my head is
>exploding, but my heart is very happy :)

Hey.. Live long and prosper :))


Ok, now a little comment on the loads of letters I've seen from almost
everyone on the list:

Let's just step back and gain a better attitude about this, instead of
starting out with wild ideas on AHI, AGA and RTG support. Let's put some
reasoning in there... 
Priority 1 should be to nail those anoying bugs in the existing system, 
in that process the authors could also get to know the basics of the code, 
when that's done we can begin to put all the 'dream-stuff' in there, e.g.
people is talking so much about AGA, RTG and intuition support.. Let's not
forget that we currently have 2 full intuition supporting extensions for
the moment (OS DevKit and Intuition) with 1 or 2 more on the way in a matter
of weeks (GUI and JADE(?)). An extension called 'The Game Extension' has
recently been anounced with intuition support too. So why the rush to include
it in the main system when there's far more importaint tasks to get working
first ???

Ok, I know some of you is proberly going to flame me for writing this. So
just go ahead, I can take it. But before doing so please read my letter
one more time, and think about it. I can't see ANY reason to begin wasting
time writing commands that is allready present in freeware extensions and
that works excelent. (like GUI and DME)... One thing that might be nice to 
add though is more slots for extensions.. :)

That is excellent news and I'm sure will encorage alot of people to
stay with AMOS now they know there will be more developments.

A couple of things...

Is this a money making development? i.e. Are most of us going to see
nothing for a year when it will be commercially released or will we
gets constant free (or not) updates?

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't let it end up like the Jade extension. No
false hopes of a brilliant new version in a month when you actually
mean a year (or never).

And things I'd like to see as a priority....

-Fix some of the terrible bugs!!!! (especially the ones to do with
program length, buffer size etc.)

-Compatable with ALL amigas, incl. WB3.1 and GFX cards (so some new
screen mode way of doing things)

-AGA and then faster commands (both like AMCAF Qsqr, Qrnd and faster
GFX routines for bobs and drawing)

Don't spend ages doing things that could come later.
And ignore all the 3D requests. Until the amiga is more widely
powerful, any half decent 3D games cannot be done in AMOS. I think all
of the AMOS attempts I've seen justify that.
(except perhaps Starfighter - the 3D extension is OK if used well)

Thanks,
-Murray

X-Status: 

I didn't notice the dev.forms on Andy's homepage, so I'll just fill out one
here :)

COMPARISON:
Interpreted languages are a bit "old" - computers are geeting so fast that
compilation can be done relatively fast - and so I think that the basic idea
of AMOS is a bit old.
The "strong" part of AMOS is the editor - the acessory-idea is just brilliant
(badly implemented, though).
AMOS is the "pre" language, where you partly make previevs of ASM/C-routines,
and partly create "own use" editors/converters, etc.

IMPROVEMENTS:
-ACCESSORIES:
Speedup:
i.e. test the program when hiding instead of when running.
include an "update off" command, that stops the editor screen from being
updated, making "macro-like" accessories much faster.

And: ARGH! Please don't tokenize the line before calling an accessory, and 
please make it possible to call accessories from macros. And stop putting the
editor to back. Give the edtor screen a number so that it can be selected and
deselected more freely.

More editor-cmds (i.e. GotoX - ARGH!)

Better user menu (i.e. sub-menues)

-GENEREL (BARE BONES):
-structured variables
-constants!!!
-More than one parameter returned from procedures
-possibillity of calling a proc as a function
Something like:
  PERSP_X0=160 : PERSP_Y0=128
  For Z=10 to 50
    Cls Z and 1,PERSP[-1600,-1280,Z] to PERSP[1600,1280,Z]
  Next Z
  Procedure PERSP[X,Y,Z]
    Shared PERSP_X0,PERSP_Y0
    XS=X/Z
    YS=Y/Z
  End Proc[XS+PERSP_X0,YS+PERSP_Y0]
-Perhaps a possibillity of entering expressions in RPN

-GFX-STUFF:
-Better plane-control of screens (locking planes, Screen Swap swapping only
some of the planes, viewing planes from other screens, etc)
-Better control of display (i.e. setting the modulo)
-Opening a screen without reserving memory for it (i.e. using a bank)
-More than 8 screens, bigger than 1008*1008
-Perhaps a bunch of chunky cmds (opening a chunky screen in fast mem) (4, 8,
16, 24, 32 bit chunky supported) and some c2p-stuff.
-would also be nice with a "mask"-option in screen-copy (a pointer to a mask
plane, allowing to use the entire minterms-byte)
-And then I would like to draw a polygon point by point:
  Degree
  For I=0 to 359
    Poly 160+Cos(I*3)*159,128+Sin(I*4)*127
  Next I
  Poly Draw

-OBJECT-STUFF:
-Better AMAL-control of screens (control of all four "Screen Display"
parameters,  Screen Swap, Screen to front/back, Screen Hide/Show)
-AMALs running at different speeds (I.e. sprites and Screen running every
frame, bobs at every 2nd frame)
-Better plane-control of bobs/icons,etc
Something like
Bob Planes BOB,string$
string$=a (number of bitplanes on screen) characters string in which each
character corresponds a bitplane on screen.
'0' to '7' use the given bob-plane
'+' fill the mask
'-' clear the mask
' ' leave plane
Default for showing a 4 plane bob on a 8 plane screen would be
Bob Planes 1,"0123----"
this would use colours 0 to 15 for the bob. If we'd wish to use colours 16 to
31 instead it would be
Bob Planes 1,"0123+---"
And using the first  even colours (2,4,6,etc) would be
Bob Planes 1,"-0123---"

I realise that I can use Peek$ to read characters from memory, and then use

Subject: Mushroom PD Annpuncement - AMOSPro Source Code Released!!!
Status: O
X-Status: 

The source for AMOS + AMOSPro (including the compiler) have now been released to
a small team of developers, who wish to put this once ever-popular language back
on top of them all, by giving it a major overhaul.

The major changes which will be added, will be AGA and graphics card support for
all AMOS modes, including its editor, yet still be able to provide the
programmer with complete control over its graphics system.

Over the past couple of months, I have had a developers form on my webpages
(http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk) asking existing users/old users what they
would like to see in a new version, and how they compared AMOS to other
languages and why. Some of the responses have been very interesting, and have
been placed on the list to be included in the near future.

Some of the other features placed on the list include full AHI soundcard
support, GIF, JPG, PNG and other datatype access/creating, structured variables,
multiple-code platform (will allow to compile for a specific machine format,
including PPC), PPC support, the list is endless.

If you are not on the AMOS mailinglist, you can follow what is going on in
alt.religion.amos and add your comments to all the others. With a bit of
work, this language can be back on top again! Thanks for reading.

Greetings.

yeS, YES! Alright! BEST NEWS IN AGES! Amazing! Simply amazing!
I've been away for the past couple of days (and quite busy),
so I hadn't the chance to read my mail for a few days.

Anyhow, I see that (now it's Thursday night) after checking my mail and
getting all these messages, that the AMOS source code has been obtained
(way to go, PIETRO!). There's MUCH that both I and some other people could
say on this subject (that haven't already). To refrain from making a bunch
of longs messages, I'll hold back for the time being. I DO, however, have
a few things to say and reply to some things that have been said:

I do want to say for all those out there that although this IS GrEaT news
(does a quick jig and shouts joyiously), after the initial excitement is
over, everyone NEEDS to wait and settle for Pietro to: sort out any more
pending legal issues and give us updates on what he's doing, what he CAN
do, and what he PLANS to do. This also means organizing his source, working
on it and getting together a beta team for any future updates, etc. (which
I'll add, btw, that I AM available for beta-testing and would love to give
any help or input on anything you're doing, 3D especially among others) :)

Secondly, I noticed that (Alistair) Murray posted something on the subject,
and at the end of his message, he thus did speak on the subject of 3D:

> Don't spend ages doing things that could come later.
hehe, I think that goes WITHOUT saying (however,
there are lots of things need to be done remember).

> And ignore all the 3D requests. Until the Amiga is more
> widely powerful, any half decent 3D games cannot be done in
> AMOS. I think all of the AMOS attempts I've seen justify that.
> (except perhaps Starfighter - the 3D extension is OK if used well)

EXCUSE ME?! Alright, first thing: I'll agree that programming 3D type games
(especially the more complex raycasting-type ones, loaded with lots o'
features and things) CAN be tedious and pump AMOS for all it's worth,
sometimes making it slow, bad, and not likeable. But just because you've
(possibly) seen a few badly written demos or a couple of not "very fast"
games *DOES NOT* mean that it CANT be done in AMOS, hasn't or won't be!

Albeit anything Pietro does will help, and any length of time for waiting
for some beta's or even an update will be welcomed and justifiable, but
don't just put AMOS down. It may be hard, but it DOESNT mean it can't be
done (and believe me, I speak from first hand experience! I believe that
there are a few other 3D projects underway (besides mine) by both people ON
and NOT on the List that will agree with me (or are attempting it).

If nothing else, we NEED some extra 3D and 3D related commands to help all
the existing 3D games and demos that have been written (for rewrites and
updates) and anything for future projects! If what you've seen is so crappy
then that's all the more reason for us to get some new commands in there!

Alright, now that I have breifly addressed that subject and have gotten
that off my chest (hehe), I'll just add one "would like to see":

Some new drawing commands, PLEASE! (which includes a new Zoom,
hehe, with some anti-aliasing, tri-linear MIP mapping and more! hehe)

Anyhow, I've been talking with Chris Hodges about this, but he's been busy
and hasn't had much time to answer me on this (how about it Chris?). He
said he could easily do a new and MUCH faster Zoom similar to his Bzoom in
AMCAF, only losing the factors and adding a few new features, which sounds
nice and is what I need. Slow texture mapping and not-so-fast drawing
commands are also what's been hindering my CBATNAM programming of a late.

I understand that (Pietro) is recieving many requests (and Mush ain't
helping any!) and has much to do, I'm just getting in some basic reqeusts
that I'D like to see. I also understand that there may be the need for some
graphician and graphics programmers in the beta team for some of these).

With all that said, thanks for all reading FOR reading this and allowing me
to use up your time! Like I said, Pietro, I'd love to and am available to
be on your beta team (and I have many C and ASM routines I can send you if
you need, namely graphic routines, c2p and speedups). Thanks again.

Btw, I have yet to read everything (the long "want" lists) which includes
all the long messages (and the things Mush sent), but I will eventually
(which also means I'll be responding to some later, as many will). :)

I found this but someone on the list told me that you have to use
Rnd(-9) to get the same result each time. It doesn't say it anywhere
in the manual.... god knows how they knew.

> "Every" is too unstable too be used for anything

Earlier AMOS versions had this problem. The Every command that I use
in AMOS Pro 2.00 works fine.

#The Game Extension# doesn't do much intuition, all it does that
involves intuition is the mouse support. #The Game Extension# does
everything except intuition as I think there are already two other 
great extensions for intuition !

Work on TGE is progressing well, Ive got the music support,
CD32pad(Full support), Some mouse commands, various small
commands like reboot and such, and AGA/RTG screens working. 
I'm currently testing the Load iff command which fully supports
Normal/AGA/GfxCard screens.

I'll post a url to get a demo of the command to the list very soon.

I agree with you, AMOS needs the Bugs to be fixed, as there
are all ready a huge amount of extensions out there. Some
more extension slots would be very nice !


PS: What ever happened to JADE ?!?

Why the hell cant we just call the library function to open a screen, 
 If yer gonna improve Amos, at least make it system friendly this 
time.

I hope the library function is used in the future version too. I suggested
this method as a way to stop repetition of un-needed code. I s'pose its just
as easy to wap it in a variable and call it that way.

2 quick things that I thought I'd bring up with the list.  

1.  Much has already been said about the release of the Amos source code
    and I think this is a fabulous thing.  And IMO I think the top things
    to implement are EASY Intuition and more powerful commands for games
    and the like (graphics card support, AGA, AHI, etc.) plus fix current
    bugs.  As much as possible, this should be done in an OS friendly way.
    We are all aware of the current Amiga situation with the lack of 
    commercial developers (compared to what we once had) and an improved
    Amos could be used to help fill the software gap allowing more rapid
    development of games and utilities.

2.  I'm trying to conduct a very short survey for Amiga users 
    (5-10 questions).  The purpose is to find out what kind of programs
    Amiga users want and are willing to buy so we as programmers
    can spend our time on those things and not on something which no one
    will buy or use.  If the Amiga community had 4 major word processors
    currently in market then it would not be a good idea to try and code
    and market another one.  Instead efforts could be directed into other
    areas which were lacking.  This is only a hypothetical example but
    that's the basic idea.  I need sample questions for the survey and 
    was wondering if you guys could offer some suggestions.

Robert

Hi!

Argh.. is hard reply to all the messages received :) and so this is a big
answer for all the questions:


The Amos Future:
----------------

Now i've obtained the sources, and obviously i won't give up! The work is
very hard, but i'll try anyway! In this moment i don't know when the
first update will be available, because as stated in the previous message,
before upgrade Amos i must understand how it works, and this is very
difficult because:

- The code was written by another person 
- No docs available
- I don't know how it's structured
- only few comments in the code

  (Thanks for your support, but i know (.. and hate!) the French :))


- 3MB!!!! of ASM sources... masochist!!!

try to imagine my situation..... and so don't expect a upgrade soon :(


The first upgrades will be available for free, so you can test the new
features and judge if my work deserve your trust.

The major and official AMOSPro V3 will be probably shareware.. Amos will
never be a commercial product again.

All the upgrades and beta versions will be available from my homepage (..
not available yet. Fabrizio tienti pronto! :) ) ... my homepage will be the
new official AMOS homepage ;)

In order to speedup the work, i'll try to build a developers team.. but
this introduce some problems and non-disclosure agreements to sign... i
can't give out the sources without permission.



Amos To-Do list:
----------------

I've received tons of requests about the new features to introduce in the
new version..... some considerations:


The first things to do in my planes are:

- fix the well knowed Amos bugs
- add the long awaited structures support
- AGA support.

The AMOS screens can use the PAL mode only! The new AGA modes like DblPAL
or Multiscan can be available using the system drivers and intuition. So
in the future you'll can open a Hi-res screen with 256 colours, but no
DblPal. Obviosuly i'll integrate the intuition support, so you can use
these modes and gfx cards.

- intuition support for wb applications
- speedup and optmizations

These are the bases.. all the other kind of stuff like c2p,3d,AHI etc
will be added LATER! First i must fix and understand AMOS... after i can
improve it. All these stuffs will be added using separate extensions... the
AmigaOS Extension will provides intuition and OS support, RTG Extension gfx
cards and AHI support, etc.

About PPC and different processors support.. i'm sorry but is almost
impossible! PPC support means rewrite *TOTALLY* AMOS! The AMOS compiler cannot
creates optimized code for 68030-60 because AMOS use pre-made code, and
doesn't creates it on the fly like a C compiler :(

Backward compatibility.... AMOS will never support the AmigaOS 1.3!!!!
In the future Amos will require at least the OS 2.04... for the best
perfomance a AGA system with OS 3.x (A1200) The OS 3.1 is old, why support
the 1.3?????


Now i'm parsing the forms received by Mush.... if you haven't fill this
form, join the Mush homepage 'Team AMOS' and fill it.

WHAT !?!?!?!?!?! Are you going to kill one of the greatest advantages of
AMOS, the ability to create nice user-interfaces on a 1.3 system without
much trouble ????

Before I joined the net, I would proberly think the same as you, why support
an old system?? Well I opend for registration of my programs on the net by
mailing to me, and it turned out that about 30% of the users contacting
me, was running my databases and editors (Not AB3D) on a 1.3 system, and
they were bungning me to keep my programs running on 1.3. By mistake I had
a test-version of a database out that required 2.0 system (pattern matching), 
and I got about 15 flaming letters in one (!) day, telling me that they would 
prefer to live without the now functions if I would only fix some bugs in a 
version that could run on 1.3...

What I still can't figure out is why bothering adding AGA-support in the
main library. We have numorous excelent extensions to give us that along
with Intuition support. Why not let the old basics be, and concentrate on
removing bugs and adding some missing commands to the basics. And, just
wondered, if you're jumping to 2.04 system, I guess it's becourse you'd
like to rewrite the screen-structures, what about all the old effects-
extensions like Turbo that ain't developed anymore, just kick them out ??
(Please don't tell me about AMCAF, I know that one will be updated, but 
I've paid for a few others and I don't wanna kick them out now !)

Please don't see the above as I don't want OS2.04 or AGA support in the 
main sections, what I'm asking is that we still can write programs that
can run on 1.3 with AMOS. You can easily do something like LDos, where
the main extension runs great on 1.3, but there's some special functions 
included directed to 2.04 users. Of course that makes it up to the author
of a program to check for system-version before calling these functions..

And before anyone starts telling me that I can just keep to the present
version of AMOS, then just remeber that about a week after the release
of a new version that'll be considered the standard. Just like it's
a standard to have a 030/50 Cpu for running games nowadays..

NB: Now that the anouncement-fuzz has cooled a bit down, then I'd like to
repeat my offer on doing something with the IO_devices extension, in case
you havn't found one to do that yet :)..

Happy greetings, Yours..

Hello there amos users...

Here's some news about the Jade AGA extension.

First of all i would like to say that Jade will NOT be cancelled!
Not even when there is going to be AGA support in Amos itself.
There are a lot of personal problems going on with the programmer,
so it will be delayed a little.
But don't worry, it will NOT be cancelled!

If there are any questions concerning Jade, please DO email me.

Greetings, Michel Bijlsma - The Jade team.

When you made a new version of AMOS will you spread it for free,
make it Shareware or will you sell it commercially ?

I don't think making an PC (DOS or Windows) version is a good idea.

1. It would require a complete rewrite

2. I don't think the PC GFX-cards support
   hardware-scrolling, dual playfield and screen cloning.

3. PC GFX-cards don't allow multiple screens on one monitor.

4. PC GFX-cards don't have a copper so no more Rainbows.

5. The PC also havn't got library's like the Amiga has.

6. DOS got those stupid 64K segments and Windows slows
   games down a bit.

7. If a PC version were made there would be less time
   for the programmers to update the Amiga version.

8. PC GFX-cards don't have real sprites.

9. When making such a program for DOS, you'll need
   drivers for soundcards.


If I'm wrong please correct me, but it seems that a
PC version of AMOS would never be so nice
as the Amiga version.

Simple answer:
Extract enough from the IDCMP message to populate an 'InputEvent'
structure. OpenDevice the console.device unit -1, then grab the
io_Device pointer from the IOStdReq structure you used in the open
and use it as a library base to call RawKeyConvert (offset -48)
with a pointer to that InputEvent in A0, a byte buffer pointer in
A1, the length of the buffer in D1, and 0 (a null pointer to a
KeyMap, so it uses the system default) in A2.

Hmmm, maybe not so simple after all, but that is the method.

A simpler solution would be to get the cooked key from intutition
in the first place by asking for VANILLA keys instead of RAW and
it gets to do all the grunt work. You still get the qualifiers
and other neat stuff. In OS2+ you can even ask for VANILLA and RAW
at the same time, so you get raw events for anything which won't
generate a character, like the Fn keys. It also will handle dead
keys, and other painful details. 

Hope this helps, at least a little,
-Richard

Just use negative numbers when you wan't identic numbers. It even says so in
the manual!

I recently installed CyberGfx v3 instead of v2. Everything seemed to work finr
until I tried to run AMOS. When starting the editor the mouse freezes. The
computer doesn't crash; AMOS is running in the background and can still be
flipped with Amiga+A. Only problem is, that the WB screen is STILL in front,
when the AMOS screen should be. I cannot see the AMOS screen!

Anyone had the same problem? How should I solve it?

Greasey greets (hehe).

Just reading on the subject of a port of AMOS to the PC: It HAS been
mentioned before and there have been some people undertake such a task,
both of which have since disappeared from the List! (Pentos and POP).

> If I'm wrong please correct me, but it seems that a PC
> version of AMOS would never be so nice as the Amiga version.

No, can't say you're wrong (for a few sentimental reasons):

1. It was done on the Amiga,
2. It's an AMIGA product,
3. That's where it belongs!

It COULD be done on the PC (as we've said), it would just be a challenge.
For those I know that HAVE done it (or halfway), as to whether or not
they've continued their work I'm not sure, but I know it will take some
doing whoEVER does it.. It would certainly "help" the Amiga in some ways,
given the right support and write of code and interface. AND it would help
to wake up some of those clueless PC programmers out there. (to show them
and any interestered in the market just *WHAT* the Amiga can do!) :)

Hello...

Here's one for all those great system-knowing people on the list :)

Simple problem:
I have a raw-key-code obtained from an IDCMP-message from an intuition-
window. I also have the qualifier from that same message, now I simply
need the ASCII-code (NOT ANSI) for that key, using the active keymap so
that it'll work outside Denmark too..

BTW: In case somebody wondered; The Rawkey-code is the same as the one
obtained with 'Scancode', the qualifier-code is the same as the one
returned by 'Key Shift'. And what I need is to combine these into a
response like the one returned by 'Inkey$', simple ey ???

Thanks in advance (as usual) :)

Greetin's.

I see Pietro has joined the hyped up "Land of the Living". Seems this
subject and recent happenings has wakened many people that have been
on the List for awhile and don't say much (or I don't see around often)..

> -The code was written by another person
> -No docs available
> -I don't know how it's structured
> -only few comments in the code

hehe, now ain't that JUST the way we like it? It's all source,
all ASM, no comments, very little docs, and for what comments
ARE in there, it's all in a language you don't understand (Fr.)!

> 3MB!!!! of ASM sources... masochist!!!
Gag.. that's gotta be nasty.. give that to a PC
programmer (he'll have a feast on that I'm sure)
Many PC programmers like 3M of pure ASM. :)

> Try to imagine my situation... and so don't expect a upgrade soon :(
hehe, if you're a PC programmer, there's no need (to "imagine" it)! :)

> The major and official AMOSPro V3 will be probably
> shareware.. Amos will never be a commercial product again.

Might want to word that a commercially "viable" product (as Dilbert says),
at least not in the Amiga market, eh? And my friends, as we ALL know
Europress didn't help that situation any and probably won't in the future.

> All the upgrades and beta versions will be available from
> my homepage (..not available yet. Fabrizio tienti pronto!)
> :) ...my homepage will be the new official AMOS homepage ;)

Ah, coolness! I see you don't have your homepage up right now? Getting it
all underway soon (I'm assuming)? I'd be willing to help with anything you
need done (gfx or page layouts). I know that there may be a couple other
people that might offer to help as well, but I'll be the first, hehe.

Ah, yes, problems. That's what you get when put Europress in the mix
(and have a project like this, worked on for a few years with a team headed
by Francois, then locked away, hehe). Gotta love all that legal stuff.

As I said, I'd be willing to help with anything you need (includes
development, promotion, programming, and Webpage stuff). If you want, go
ahead and put me down for the team and give me a ring if you need-want. :)

> These are the bases.. all the other kind of stuff like c2p, 3d, AHI etc

Yes, this is understandable. But a new set of drawing commands ARE needed
AND in order as soon as possible (implying after a few beta releases)! :)

Hmm.. guess that's all I've got to add for now. Again, I'd love
to help.. just give me a ring. Thanks (to everyone) for reading.

If it was me you heard it from, then I heard it from Europress - 
I`ve still got the letter somewhere...  They were pretty good at 
responding to user enquiries, actually.

Specify both IDCMP_VANILLAKEY and IDCMP_RAWKEY and you will get VanillaKeys
for  all  mapable keys and rawkeys for the other ones. Amcaf has a function
to convert rawcodes into strings, but this function is not really  keyboard
mapping independant.

You can't even get 640*400*16 in amos at present, not without going off
the sides of the overscan.  "Interlace Bug".

A friend of mine (and old AMOS programmer) suggested that for the next
version of AMOS, a way to use the .fd parts of a system library. Blitz basic
does this, and thats probably one of the reasons why it is getting all the
public attention with programmers, as all they do is get the brand new
library which is released, and convert the .Fd to a blitz library ready for
immediate use in the program.

I feel this would be a good addition to AMOS, and then no matter how long it
takes to write new extensions etc. there will never be a real need to keep
updating the code to go along with new trends.

TCPI/IP network support! So that it can be used to write network
games. An implementation of sockets communication would be
ideal.. 

File sharing and locking! So that the TCP/IP thingo can also
transmit and update config files on the fly without crashing the 
AMOS app.

A better debugger which supports multiple breakpoints, multiple 
variable watchpoints, etc.

A date/time set and read functions would be great too.. it's such a
pain to have to use the Operating system with its bizarre BCPL
calling conventions to get and set the real time clock.

What else? Dunno.. that should be heaps for a start!

Not very clearly tho`
Randomize(-9)
For i=0 to 4
?rnd(100)
next

WILL print the same 5 numbers every time!

On WB3.1, you'll find it doesn't work, on any amiga, AGA or not.  All other
chipsets are fine.

I have this problem, moreso with string variables becoming corrupt with
unusal sentences/parts of my program. I recently had a problem with this in
the MLM software, but was able to fix it.

500 seperate arrays, or a table with 500 elements? The mailinglist software
has an array of 5,000 elements.

The only calls to any arrays made by the gui extension, is to list them in a
LISTVIEW gadget. As far as I know, it does nothing to change it.

Please describe the error a little more, is it the listview display which
becomes corrupt when you select something, as this is a known GUI 1.62 bug,
which is very easily fixed.

Cant you just make a blank screen in PPaint or something of the correct
resolution and colours, and just Spack it into a bank? Ive sometimes found
doing this is the only way to open larger laced screens correctly. Of course
I have no idea how it would work on 3.1...

The Game extension will be using the GMS system to do most of its AGA
handling and other gfx (bobs etc.). The only problem is, if you use it to
make anything commercial (sell for any amount of cash) you need to purchase
a license from the auther of GMS, a bit like when you write MUI
applications.

Still, the extension looks like it might have one or 2 good bits.

The default music extension also plays Sound/Pro tracker modules, with TRACK
LOAD command. It will also load and play MED modules too.

Im my library, there is a piece of source code which makes calls to a
library to play tracker modules correctly, it was done by Andy Gibson (I
think). Try looking at that. You should also upgrade your AMOS version to
Pro, and make use of the better extensions, such as DOOM Music.
