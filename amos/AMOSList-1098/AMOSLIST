TGE screens operate in $RRGGBB, and they also support gfx cards, aga
and chunky8 and chunky16.

If you ever have some free time on your hands, could you fix the bug
in the new amos screens ?

The problem is that if You press leftamiga+a loads of times
(about 20-30+) amos doesnt return right, and gives a black screen!
then youve got to reboot......

keep up the good work!

	I'm with you on this one, look the things that amos is good at (2D
scrolling, Sprites/Bobs, Screen Handling, ect. ect.)  are percisely the
thing the Amiga is good at, whereas the things Amos is bad for (maths, 3D
texture mapping/Ray casting, scaling ect.) are percisely the things the
Amiga is bad at.  And just to be really annoying, I don't think Amos is
the best language to learn on, PASCAL is really (it has no GOTO command!) 
 Amos is good to use but it'll let you get away with too much sloppy code
to be a good beginer's language.  Maybe I'm misstepping here, but it seems
the oldest, wisest folks on the list are those who've had experience
beyond Amos, I know I never wrote a decent piece of code until my first
"Hello World" in C, but still I always come back to Amos when I want to do
something serious, why?  Because it's the best, fastest way to turn an
Idea in your head into a game on your screen.  That is just so long as
your idea isn't for a 3-D guradu shaded texture mapped wonderland.

Exactly!  I've had this arguement with my friend several times!  I wanted a
program to change all my MAME Roms (over 85!) that were in directories into
ZIP files.  In less than 5 minutes with AMOS (plus the AMCAF extension) I
had a program up and running!  I didn't have to learn how to use libraries
to make a file tree..blah blah blah.  Sorry, I'm just too lazy to learn how
to do all that! :)

That sucks! How do you go out of nested loops? C is da best ;) Benjamin
Wyatt (he was on amos list, I think) wanted to make language called POP
which would have advantages of both basics and C, but he stopped
developing. If he succeeds, that will be a hell of a language!

Okay you have obviously not used amos outside of amos!
The good thing about amos is it allows use of assembler and doscalls and so
on... so it isn't just BASIC! its much more... I mean you compare Qbasic and
AmosPro they are totally different! And as for PASCAL! Ha! I admit i have
only learnt the basics and a little extra.. but it is no where near as good
as Amos... Okay it may be good that you have to setup everything and i don't
know about wether amos is faster or not! But so far the only good thing to
do with Pascal that i have found is its variable structure using TYPE! But I
don't think AMOS is just a starting language... its a good starting language
but its a middling language too = ) ! I do agree though that the more
experience with other languages you have the better! And again I agree but i
only find a problem with speed... I can do anything any other language can
do with 10* more ease but 10* less speed! Coz Amos can handle 3D and
Tmapping.. its just too slow! But with using DMA you can do alot! And thats
what i try to do with my progs. Use the lowest level I can possible do in
amos to get the most power and speed!

Bye For now! Phil... Sorry don't mean to argue but amos is the best for what

	Ah, yes you can't do much with PASCAL but I submit it is the best
learning language because it is forceably structured, there's no bouncing
around from here to there and back again in pascal you've got to divide
every task into it's own seperate and discrete function.  Thus pascal does
what I think amos can't and that's teaches you to think about code in an
orderly and efficient way.  Amos by contrast will let you get away with
anything and so it's not as good for learning structure.

	Ah then we agree anyway, I guess you're just not a fan of PASCAL
that's all. :)  But I'm totally with you on AMOS as a middling language to
use your words.  It is very powerful and so easy to use, maybe if you
really, really need the speed it can fail you, but if you're only making
2D old school style games (the kind the Amiga itself was designed with in
mind) it is plenty fast enough.
	
 And again I agree but i

	Yeah although what I was saying was that you should also consider
that the amiga itself is slown at these things, I mean the main bottle
kneck with ray casting is getting an entire new screen worth of pixels
written every 50th of a second.  The amiga just isn't made to update that
much of the screen at once.  

But with using DMA you can do alot! And thats

	it's a good call about assembler, thus amos can be flexible, easy
when you want it and fast when you need it.

We all know.  Amos is so much more than that.  It is probably the best
implementation of "BASIC" I have ever seen.  Yeah you can get a bit
faster, or a bit more OS friendly, but you sure can't get anything
easier to develop in.  Everything is already there.

Oh yeah, there are alternatives.  Loads of them.  All more expensive
and a heck of a lot harder to use.  Some of them you need to study
and study and study, and then use library calls to do anything with
anyway.  Yuk.

Just as a matter of interest, can people, errrr, finish editing their
emails so what they are quoting and what they are saying are SEPERATE
and easy to read, without reading lots and lots of unformatted text
inbetween please ?

(Oh yeah, and turn off HTML if you can..  Either that or MIME seperate
it or something.  Everything is running together and looks awful in
RAW text - the REAL format of email.)

Please ?

It'll make things easier for everyone to read...

Yeehaaa !
It seems that I started a war, I was not my intention.
All I wanted to say is that Amos has some lacks in communicating with
the WB. Have you tried to Lprint sth in "Times 10 Bold" ? Did you run
one of your "pal only" progs on a friend's Amiga that has a VGA screen ?

I know that Amos is a very good language (that's why I'm here). It has
great abilities, so far that I wrote a MIDI sequencer with it !
AMOS is a real MULTIMEDIA language. It supports images, sounds, musics,
and anims with Amos Pro. Who could ask for more ?

I started in C some years ago, on PC/Dos (nobody's perfect), so I have a
small Ansi knowledge of C. I tried to do my 1st steps on Amiga
recently.. It's hard. I never went below "Hello.C" !!! And it was a real
victory when at least I achieved to compile it. 8)
So I still use Amos ! And I like it.

hard for me to read all of your guy's messages cause I have to do this

Hey Keith...

On 02-Oct-98, didn't you say...
>> the best language to learn on, PASCAL is really (it has no GOTO command!)

PASCAL is great to learn on, because you are forced to think things out and
produce well written code.

> Note to Ghizzo:  Ditch GOTO from AmosNG...

I think GOTO can be helpful during developement, like if you wanted to skip
a section of code while debugging instead of trying to comment it out, or
make it into a Proc or Sub.

Yup! Peace to you to! And keep the momentum going! AMIGA!
Isn't it strange how emails start off with a title like wanted and end up

Hey! I might be biast here but I'm with Nikola... Pascal Is one of the worst
languages I have seen... apart from Q basic... Its ggod for learning I
agree... i got a book out of the library and in a few days I could do most
of it! But it goes no where... I am currently 'learning' it at college! But
the annoying thing is i already new the language before i started the
course... you may ask why did i take the course then because i thought i may
be able to learn Java which is a cool language! I hardly know any C as I
havn't been able to get a nice compiler i like working with and i just
havn't had the time... and my assembler days are up for the moment since i
have lost Devpac 3 which is the best assembler I have found! So I stick with
amos for the time being learning About how everything works.... Okay i know
how to use all the commands... But know I'm working out how and why they
work and how i can find a better way of doing them... I have found I have
learnt loads about the AMiga the system and amos !
I don't wanna start any arguement as I've had a pretty bad week and I just
want people to be happy.... So peace to all.... Keep The momentum Going with
AMIGA! And have a merry Birthday! When ever that maybe!

Does anyone out there know a way of moving the mouse in workbench via a
pointer or call? I don't really need to know its just buggin me coz i can do
loads with Workbench without extensions i just can't do that!

Thanx 2 you all!

And a reminder to everyone if anyone has any command lists for extensions
they want put into the amospro helpfile prog i'm making please send them to
me..... or if anyone has any ideas for what they would like to see in it!

At the moment i'm hoping to cover...

Fully customizable Menu system.... Buttons can be moved around, snapshotted
and cleaned up and all the sections can be put where you want them....
Your own notes can be made on the commands and stored with that help
section... and then sent out to other people on the net to add to their help
file!

I'm hoping to put a function that can grab commands from extension.txt's and
put them into the help file!

Just as a novalty I'll add in ability to make the gui look nice and so on...
if anyone thinks its a good idea? I'm not sure it is!

It will be able to say where the command is in the help file when you
directly jump to it by pressin help over the subject command coz that really
annoys me about the Current Amos Help!

And the Help file will be as compact as possible... not 10* bigger than it
needs to be!!! And trust me! its tough work re writing the damn thing!

I'm working on an idea to make it so that example source code can be put
directly to the Amos Paste buffer so that  after looking in the help file,
Example text can be copied to the program directly!

Also all the syntax and notes on the commands will hopfully be rewritten...
coz some explanations for commands are weird! But as I said the Help File is
BIG!

So has anyone got any ideas or does everyone think i should just go and
program a 'hello world' program and leave you all alone as I'm scaring you
all with this over long email!

Bye! Phil!

Well, no sooner than I sent off my message for help than I went to my AMOS
Pro manual and discovered that AMOS is restricted to 65,000 elements/array
(which would probably explain my problem; I was up to 100,000+ elements).

Anyhoo, thanks to everyone for your suggestions. Looks like I'll have to
give banks a try and see how they work out. If all else fails, "MIcRoSoFT!"

I third the motion. We discussed this before just a few weeks ago when
James & Phil came on the List. You guys (if possible) REALLY need to cut
out the HTML from your messages. If you're using Outlook Express or a
web-based email service such as Net@ddress or Hotmail, you CAN set your
preferences to send as "Text Only" (I know because I've used them aLL). :|

True, because when you benchmark the Amiga, it's raycasting abillites
really aren't much beyond that of a Super Nintendo (near a Playstation with
an AGA o4o/o6o). Nevertheless, it IS capable, maybe not as easily in AMOS,
but the Amiga IS capable (take for instance ClickBoom's recent Quake port).

Dont cha mean 'All Microsoft fails!' and the 'If else' bit is just you doin

Dependant on how your Data is stored in the bank try using Deek, or Peek$ to

      Yep... or even something a bit more like C/C++ as follows...

      DEBUG=True

      If DEBUG=True
         'stuff to skip...
      End If

      Of course it's actually exactly the same as your idea, Keith, but I
      just like the lable as it adds a bit more clarity.  You can also do
      things like...

      DEBUG_ONE=False
      DEBUG_TWO=True
      DEBUG_THREE=False
      etc. etc.

      IF DEBUG_ONE=True
         'First section to skip...
      End If

      IF DEBUG_TWO=True
         'Second section to skip...
      End If

      IF DEBUG_THREE=True
         'Third section to skip...
      End If

      Now, simply changing the status of the DEBUGS at the top of your
      program would enable/disable the execution of each section.
 
      Again, it's really all the same principle, but kind of a new twist.

My whole point was that it's easy to do.  It's just a way I was taught to
use the GOTO command, instead of sending you all over a program.  I just
felt like sticking up for the least liked command among better programmer.

Hi Everybody,

   I think anyone from TBL could do it, with a few asm procedures ;).

   Infact any decent demo programmer /could/ write a super 3D extention.

We could pester, say, TBL to write a TBL 3D extention for amos, but I
don't think they'd bother. Havn't seen anything from them for ages :(

   PS. If you don't have a PPC, then you don't know what your missing :
VenusArts PPC demos are the best.


   PPS. For that 'show off to amiga format' demo, I've got some AMOS3D
objects with a nice lens flare, but the 3d objects look straight from
the 80's. Prehaps we should wait for the new amos?

See ya.

Hi all.

First of all I'll introduce myself.

I'm Stephen Thornber, 36 (ouch!), unemployed, and a 3D freak.
I've just got myself Amos, and I'm trying a code a few simple utils
and maybe a game or two. But I'm very very thick, and know 0 about
coding, or maths. so I may ask lots of sad questions, please
forgive me :)

I'm currently running on an a1200 030/42.7 MMU FPU, 35mb ram 
 - (which still isn't enough) heh heh,
quad Cd-rom, citizen abc printer, 250mb hd. But I'm getting
a ppc+040 soon (mainly for LW and Imagine :)
So I hope amos works with a ppc.

I would like to ask a couple of questions.

(BTW - I'm using AmosProV2.0)

a:- Can Amos do gui's..?
    (I want to open a window on wb with buttons, and
    sliders in it.)

b:- Can anyone recommend an amos book for thick people.
    (like me ;)

c:- When I told people on irc that I was trying to learn Amos,
    I got slagged off and told it was pathetic, etc.
    why is that.?

d:- sometimes when I load AmosPro the top of the screen 
    flickers like mad. (where the menu bar is)
    its annoying, how do I fix the problem?

e:- is there an ftp site where I can get example source code,
    help files, amos utils, etc..?

f:- I've heard a lot about "Extensions" exactly what is an
    extention..?
    

BTW - Before you say RTFM, I don't have one.. sob sob ;)

Thanks in advance for any help

Steve

ClickBooms Quake port is really bad! Surely it works (and thanks to CB for
DOING the port), but it is extremely slow. I have tried out some of the
"illegal" ports, and they are MUCH faster. Thus: CBs Quake does NOT show the
Amigas full potential when dealing with raycasting abilities.

Second: Someone has done a really convincing Wolfenstein/Doom clone (not the
chunky one with pathetic textures) in Amos using ASM-routines. I can't
remember WHERE I saw it (a long time ago) but it was really good, almost like
Alien Breed 3d - I shit you not! Anyone else who has seen it or know where to
get it?

LW + Imagine? They don't use PPC do they? Shouldn't you be looking at
tornado3d?. Anyway AMOS works fine on my PPC so no probs. 

   PS. DON'T upgrade your Flashrom untill futher notice, its really
buggy and causes problems for WarpOS.

   You can't use the WB GUI with amos alone. You need to install an
extension. GUI 1.70 extention is aparently quite good, I sugest you get
a copy of that.

   An extention add commands that AMOS didn't have originly or wasn't
very good at.


   I'd also recomend Turbo+ extention for the fast drawing commands, I
could send it to you if you want. 


   There is also a 3D extention, but I wouldn't bother with that: its
not very good.

   You can get that along with other 'goodies' from
http://users.cybercity.dk/~ccc21504/amos/front.html

> b:- Can anyone recommend an amos book for thick people.

   I can only suggest the EasyAmos manual, thats how I lernt.
Its really, well, Easy.  I don't know where to get a copy from though!

   Because, to be honest, its un-system friendly and slow-ish.

Dosn't meen you cant do great things with it though ;)

   Do you have blitzblank? That does that. Try removing it.

   I can send you some of my junk. I've got:

      *A 3D vector map routine 

      *A rotating+scaling texturemap mode 7 style 

      A fast 2D line vector rotator/scaler/editor.

      A workaround to AMOS'  paralax scrolling routine.

      And somemore stuff as well.


      Email me if you want 'em

   or try

   for other peoples stuff.

Hi.

>   Funny, I have 34megs and its plenty for me ;)

Hehe, I hammer LW very hard, and use lots of BIG texture maps.
(I'd like a Terabyte, that would be enough, maybe ;)

>LW + Imagine? They don't use PPC do they? Shouldn't you be looking at
>tornado3d?. Anyway AMOS works fine on my PPC so no probs. 

Nope they don't, but I don't have my ppc yet, I'm still saving
for it.. (its 2 months away)

Oh, Thanks..

If its not too big, please do :)

Hmmm, me neither. There's no Amiga shops around here
anyway.

Oh, and I want to learn to use it... I must be mad :)

>Dosn't meen you cant do great things with it though ;)

Oh, then I can't be that mad. hehe

>   Do you have blitzblank? That does that. Try removing it.

Nope, the only thing I have running is Dopus Magellan as
workbench replacement.

Heh heh, you must be joking, that lot is WAY over my head,
like I said "I'm Thick" and new to Amos.

Sorry! Jumped to the wrong conclusion... Didn't mean to annoy anyone! Its
good that for once something by microsoft is working at least!

Bye!.... How are you doin with your project (CBATNAM)? = )

Sure! I'll work on speeding things up! You do want me to work on the proc.
that will store the image pixels into a bank... Right?
Coz i'm not sure!

   No problem... no offense was intended.  I was just interested in seeing
   how other people debugged their programs and thought I'd share my
   approach.  

   Personally, I haven't used the Goto command since back on the old
   C64... funny as I often used Gosub in AMOS, but then that is a more
   modular-oriented command.  Procedures are the way to go... and
   like my friend Ben Wyatt told me many times... "You can fold them
   right up"... a very addicting feature.

   Oh, while I'm here...

   Whoever is taking care of that AMOS Factory website... under the
   CBATNAM project description, I am listed as Benjamin Garfield...
   please be aware that my name is Garfield Benjamin.  No problem,
   it's a common mistake that is often made, but please change it...
   also, you can make my name a hot-link to my e-mail address if you
   like...  <gbenjam@sosbbs.com>

   Also, you can add me to the ICQ listing...
      Garfield Benjamin   20302721   Benj

   BTW - the AMOS Factory website looks great!!  Very professional.

   Okay, enough of this... it's Saturday!!

their cover disc, unless you direct me to do otherwise.

Guess they weren't THAT discontent with Amos anyway :)

Hi Amosians.?!? :)

I've been trying to create a gui, but I stumbled at the first
fence, so to speak.

I read the docs to "gui170.lha" and installed it successfully,
then got myself "GadToolsbox v2.0b" and created my first little
gui.

But - uh, ohh. here it comes :)

GuiConvert won't convert the gui file I saved.. doh!
it opens a requestor asking for a ".gui" file, but when I select
the one I created "StevesGui.gui" 600 bytes. it just
re-opens the requestor, asking for the ".gui" file.. Doh.!

What am I doing wrong??

(I thought I read all the docs properly.?)

Steve [Puzzled]

   No, theres nothing wrong with an Extension. Once installed you'll be
able to open pub. screens and windows etc. as if it was already part of
amos.

   Actually, I can't find the doc file, so its not much point sending it
to you with out that. I know that someone on the list was giving it out.

   Oh dear, prehaps everyone on the list could come together and write

   Don't know, sometimes AMOS doesn't like NTSC.

   OK, I could write you simple stuff like joystic control / bobs etc.

Great, how about a prog that opens a requestor and you pick a file
then the program gives you the version info on the file you
picked.  I'd love a util to do that, but I wouldn't have a clue
how to code it.. ??

Subject: [amos-list] Gui probs.?
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Stephen Thornber <SThornber@steve1.demon.co.uk>



Hi all

I have a little problem, here's my code:-

Load "Dh1:Amos/gui.abk"
Gui Bank 20
Amos To Back
Gui Open 1,1
Do
 GW=Gui Wait
 If GW=-1 Then A=Gui Close(1)
Loop

Now that opens my gui very nicely, but when I click on the
close gadget, not only does the gui close, but so does AmosPro
and It wont re-load without a boot.?

is there no way to keep AmosPro open as well as the gui, so
I can modify my code.?

Its a hassle to have to reboot every time I run my prog. :(

BTW - Please don't slag off my code, I've only been using amospro
for 2 days. (although constructed critisism is welcomed)

Steve

You've sent amos to back, but never brought it back to front. Also, install
the ams command in c:. If amos locks while your gui is running, ams will take
you back to the amos environmnent.

Yes, but you have to remember to bring amos back to front at the end. Using
Gui Amiga 0 and Gui Amos are the best bet.

I'm also sending you my gui tutorial, that will get you over the next 50
questions you are going to ask. Q8-{)

You were TAUGHT to use goto ?????????   What the heck were they thinking !!!

I stopped using them long before I was even told structured programming was
a good thing - I derived that from first principles.

Hi guys.

sorry for bothering you again.. (blush)

But I'm having problems (whats new, I hear you say :)

I'm writing text to my gui via the Gui Text command,
but when I run the program amos complains that I haven't
set the gfx output.

I read the docs and according to that I should use

Gui Gfx 1,1

But whenever I do that, amos gives me a very weird error.
somthing like %&$ on line 10
or sometimes ,$ on line 10  ?!?!?
(the line it gives me is the line that Gui Gfx is on.)

what am I doing wrong..?


Steve

You should have seen some of my high school programming classes!  My PASCAL
II class, which was supposed to give me college credit, was turned into a
"who can beat Lost Vikings the fastest" class.

Well, when they were teaching me QBasic in high school, about 6 years ago,
that's what the teacher said.  Then again, he was also a coach, and the
books we had were pretty out dated, they considered the C64 a brand new
computer on the market! 

I never use GOTOs for anything other than skipping over a little code while
trying to fix some code.  I do not support any other use of it. :)

Hi all.

I've been reading all the recent mail on "goto"'s 

one thing puzzles me though.?

What is so bad about using GOTO in your programs.?

(Sorry if this makes me sounds stupid or ignorant, but I'd
like to know, why I shouldn't use them. :)

Steve

Yep! It can with the Gui ext. but i don't use it much i prefer doing things
my way with Dos,Int,gfx and librarycalls!
So i'm not much use when it comes to GUI

But JD extension is cool you should get that! Its readily available and
found on any Aminet Directory!

I have a good amos book that started me off! can't remeber the name I'll get
back to you on that one... Oh and by the way don't put cha self down like
that everyone has to not know about things to start with otherwise there
would be no learning and no idividualism because everyone would know
everything! I mean did einstein know that he wos gonna get a sore head coz i
know most probably he would have doged any apples!

Coz it isn't and people who don't work with it don't find out what it can
do! Like 'You don't know until youv'e tried it!'

Subject: [amos-list] an RRGGBB Screen.... my Amiga for an RRGGBB screen! 
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "John Glanville" <John.Glanville@btinternet.com>

Okay! I'm not giving my amiga away to any of those who took what i said
above literally! No way! But the thing is I need help guys! I'm currently
working on a game that uses a Public 256 col screen... Without using
extensions... except for Jd file size! My problem is that the Pub screen i
open (Using a call) is only RGB colour... Where as I want an RRGGBB colour
screen and to all of those of you who know about images those extra letters
can make all the difference!

I was hoping if anyone can tell me how to open an RRGGBB screen 256 cols.
 meaning a screen that uses 256 quantities of Red green and Blue! ) I prefer
a Dos or int call or perhaps someone out there knows what all the tags do
when setting up a screen! Coz I use my procedure that opens the screen with
an intcall and I only know what half the flags do!

Can anyone help! I need this becuase I want the screen to load in 256 colour
images... and in RGB they just loose their quality! And i mean we cant have
lousy quality on a Tron game can we?

Also does any one know how to use data types from amos coz at the moment i
am having to save the image out as Raw in PPaint and then Copy each bitplane
to the logbases of the destination Pub screen! which can get a bit tedeous!
as the Colour pallette has to be loaded seperatley!

Okay! Thanx for listening coz i know i tend to warble on so...
Bye! Phil! Once I get this sorted DepTron Should be finished soon!

   The notes I've left arn't very good, but you can use online help with
commands you don't know:


(just cut that section out, save it as ver.asc, and merge it as ascii in
the amos FILE menu)

------------------------------------------------------
F$=Fsel$("")
'   Opens AMOS file requester. 
'
'   (You can use ASL requesters with some extentions ;)


Open In 1,F$
'   Opens that file for input (we won't input from it though)

L=Lof(1)
'   Gets the size of the file in input

Close 
'   Closes that file 


Reserve As Work 5,L
'   Reserves the right ammount of memory to load that file 

Bload F$,Start(5)
'   Loads the file to the start of memory bank 5   


P=0

For A=0 To L
   
   Scan through the file with variable A

   S=Start(5)
   
   
   If P=0
      
      '  P is a tempory marker to show whever we've found '$VER'
      
      P1=Peek(A+S)
      P2=Peek(A+S+1)
      P3=Peek(A+S+2)
      P4=Peek(A+S+3)
      ' Reads from memory bank 5 + A at various offsets 
      
      If Chr$(P1)="$" and Chr$(P2)="V" and Chr$(P3)="E" and Chr$(P4)="R"
         
         ' Check if we find '$VER'

   As for the simple demos, I'll get back to you in a day or too.

Urk.  A goto has no useful function, and can lead to very bad programming
and impossible to read programs.  (Ask any cobol programmer)  A goto
allows you to jump around in your code all over the place, without proper
control.  A program should flow naturally, and be nice and easy to read,
amd preferably make sense (at least to the programmer) and contain proper
comments.  (You know you want to...)

In simple terms, you don't need them.  If you NEED to resort to a goto, you need
to read more manuals.  ;-)

GOTO is an instruction unuseful and dangerous.
Unuseful because with a good program structure you don't need it. That
forces you to think about your program before you start typing.
Someting like :
AGAIN:
' some code
If _lifes>0 then goto again
Must be coded :
While _lifes>0
	' some code
Wend
You naturally think "I play while I have lifes".
So your code is more "natural" and readable. In 6 monthes you still will
be able to read and understand what you write now.
Dangerous besause you can code this:
If blabla then goto SHMURTZ
' lots of code
Gosub SHMURTZ
' lots of code
SHMURTZ:
' something
Return
If the "blabla" condition is rarely true, your prog may work, until that
day where you'll get a "RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB" and hard way to find why.

That's for Amos. But in general case, avoid GOTO. I daily program at
work with a language with no goto, and I've no problem with that.

The only language that obliges you to use GOTOs is COBOL !!!

I agree that it could be dangerous if you don't know how to use it. But I
disagree that it is unuseful.

f> Unuseful because with a good program structure you don't need it. That

One good place for using goto is exiting from nested loops. In Amos we can
Exit 2 or Exit 3 , I don't know for Pascal, but in C, there's no such
thing, and the best way to exit nested loops is to use goto.

A place where Goto could be useful in Amos is:

Procedure SOMEPROC
  'a lot of init code
  Do
    'a lot of code
    If SOMETHING
      For I=WHATEVER To WHATEVER2
       If SOMETHING_ELSE
         Goto _EXIT
       End If
      Next
    End If
    'a lot of code
  Loop
  _EXIT:
  'a lot of cleanup code
End Proc

Now, when you need to exit from procedure, you can't Pop Proc because that
would skip cleanup code, you can't Exit 2 because For loop is inside If
block, and you can't set some exit flag and use While instead of Do because
you have a lot of code which could do something unexpected. Even if you
could do something of that, in this case, Goto is most readable solution.

So, I would conclude, that Goto is bad, but sometimes it is neccesary :)

So your the Author of TGE huh! Cool! where can i get it? I've been looking
for it but to no avail! Thanx I'll try it! Is there a command to return the
Rastport of the TGE screens? Coz i will need that to use the screen! Is the
Bob speed faster than the TurboBobs Ext? Also I don't suppose you can turn
the mouse pointer off outside of Amos using TGE?

Thanx once again! I'll send you The game when its finished if you want! Its
call DepTron... The Game is pretty simple! Its just got an interesting twist
( Where have i heard that before? ) I know there are enough Tron games
already, but I have so many different versions in my AmosProgs I though I
would compile them into one game... Then as i was doing this i came up with
another idea for Tron...! Is the Chunky System fast? Coz that would be very
usefull for the Demo I'm working on!

Bye For now! Phil!
Anything i can do for you?

Subject: [amos-list] GOTO's
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Ives, Neil, IVESNJ" <neil.ives@bt.com>

I must say this discussion of Goto is just what the Amos list is for, it
makes useful reading material, these are the type of mails that I save.
I have read experienced programers slagging-off Goto and have discovered the
problems with it myself, but beginners need to know these things. However,
the use of Goto to *temporarily*  jump past a bit of program to test
something is very useful though, I bet most Amos coders glance over their
shoulder and do that dirty thing sometimes. (indignant outrage follows!)

Thanks, people, keep it up.

Heh heh, you may regret that, I'm a total newbie to Amos and

Oh.!!  most of mt problems so far have involved gui's.

What do you mean by Dos,Int,gfx and library calls.??!?!

hehe, seems you have a memory like mine :)

I'm not putting myself down, I'm just being truthful ;)

when it comes to 3D I'm great, when it comes to coding, I'm
crap.. but I have only been using amospro for 3-4 days now
so I shouldn't expect to know much yet?

>Coz it isn't and people who don't work with it don't find out what it can
>do! Like 'You don't know until youv'e tried it!'

oh right...

I did try Blitz2, but I was so hard to do the slightest thing,
and it kept crashing.. also the manual for blitz is pathetic
and it assumes you are already a coding expert.!

>RTFM????

"Read The F***ing Manual" ;)


BTW - Do you have any small ( less than 50k ) games/utils
that you've coded with amos..?
I'd like to see what it can do, before I really throw myself
into learning it.

Steve

The chunky is faster for games where the full screen completely changes,
like 3D games for example, as drawing pixels is dead slow!
like just a or.w #%1010101010101010,(a0) is dead slow, as its
writing to chipmem (yuk!)
where in chunky it writes to fastmem, and the C2P will covert it into
chip mem & planar, so it does turn out faster there.
Where as for 2d games like platformers you can use the blittler to draw
but then with rtg....

I might use kalms c2p routine, as its one of the best ive seen, its used
in loads of demos and some doom ports, also Im good friends with him
so getting permission shouldnt be too hard.

>Bye For now! Phil!
>Anything i can do for you?

uhm, probably not atm. Unless do you know how to do a
check for a filename, but I want to do it like 'exist("GMS:") '
but I dont want a 'plz insert volume GMS:' to pop up.

Im prepareing TGE for its first public release atm, a few days
ago I hit command 100(yayyy) I think at about 130 there will be a
release. Which will be a 0.9, then on the ADCD there will be
a MEGA demo, with FMV, rotating plasmas, dot tunnels, maybe light sourcing
and heaps of stuff, and CDDA music, and stuff.

I've come across a couple of problems,
one is just annoying, the other is my main concern.

1:- (the annoying one)

I designed a simple gui (a slider and 2 buttons)
it works fine, so I added a bit of code to
print the current setting of the slider on the gui,
using "gui Text", well that works fine.. BUT

If I move the slider to a high position, the gui will
show, say errrm  "12", then when I move it down to something
like "5", instead of "5", I get "52".

Its not printing over the last piece of text..
I tried several ways to fix the problem, the most obvious
one was to print "   " at the same co-ords, just before
it prints the number. (to clear the last number)
but this doesn't work...  now for something wierd.
If I change the "   " to something like "___" or "XXX"
it works fine, overwriting the previous text..
but ___ or XXX looks ugly..
the question is... why doesn't 3 spaces work the same..?!?!

I eventually fixed it by using "gui bar" to wipe out the
text, but I'd rather use the "   " method..

(sorry for the looooong text, but I couldn't explain it
any easier ;)

2:- (the main problem)

I added some code to my simple gui to iconify itself
when I clicked on a button, this works fine.
but I'd like it to uniconify when I click on the close
gadget of the iconified window. I can't get this to
work at all, in fact it won't read the close button
at all, when its iconified. and I have to use Ctrl+C.

my code is like this:-

Procedure ICONIFY
Gui Iconify 1
X=0
Repeat
 GW=Gui Wait
 If GW=-1
   Gui Uniconify 1
   X=1
 EndIf
Until X=1
Endproc

Anyone tell me how to read the close gadget when my
window is iconified..?!?!

(Please forgive my sloppy code, I am learning, but
slowly... :)


Thanks in Advance :)

Steve [Amos Beginner]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yes! your right. I bought Blitz thinking it would be like Amos but able to
use new screen modes and stuff but I was so disappointed with the manual. It
seemed to assume a knowledge that was not appropriate to a version of Basic,
which after all is supposed to be a beginners language. I have never created
anything with it, it just sits on my hard disk taking up space! The manuals
that came with my Amos original and AmosPro have taught me almost all I have
learnt about programming. I have my manual near me so I can refer to it
often. Message to any future Amos publisher..produce a good manual...please.

Thats Why I haven't replied to those probs... Coz I don't know myself!

>What do you mean by Dos,Int,gfx and library calls.??!?!


Amos has some internal commands that don't need any extensions or any
extralibries because they call apon the system libraries...
These commands are called
Doscal (-X) - Has control over OS
IntCall  (-X)  - has Control over Intuition
GfxCall (-X) - Has Control over Graphics!
-X is the Library offset! Basically a library is a store of other peoples
code... Code that is very usefull... You need to know the offset in the
library to get the right bit of code! But I wouldn't try these commands out
as a begginer they are very powerfull and basically have no saftey
precautions so if you get it wrong... you crash! And me just talking about
this will just confuse things... Unless i'm completley wrong and you are a
very quick learner... But I know when i started I tried these commands and
just though they were put there so that you would RTFM (Thankyou! for
enlightening me! = P) and find nothing on these bloody commands! But if you
want I will explain in more detail!

Hey! What memory... the only memory I've got it 10mbs of ram!...
I now know what that book was....
its an Amiga Format book... Ultimate Amos... by Jason Holborn
ISBN: 1 898275 02 5
it covers Easy Amos, Amos 1.35, AmosPro V1, Compilers, Amos Tome, Amal,
Ctext, D-sam!
I don't know where you can get it now! and my bro's using my book at the mo.

Cool! I've always wanted to be good at 3d progs... but the first one i used
was imagine and that put me off! Perhaps were ViceVersa... I'm supposed to
be good at coding and your good at 3d!

Sorry I Don't see why people are so against Amos when it is the one thing
that has been consistent with Amiga's from when I started... And For me Its
the one thing that I think is sure to keep the Amiga Alive... As Amos is the
Best Basic... The Most easiest to understand and the most powerfull...!
Didn't mean to get carried away!

I'm not surprised for some reason ( I think its because worms was programed
in it!)
people think blitz is better than Amos... Duh! hello! Why? i tried it got no
where in it after a week.... Found Amos..... Was doing fine in it in a few
days! And its not just that Blitz is for better programers because I went
back to it and now thanx to the understanding i have developed from Amos I
can uderstand it more.... But its still C**P! Mind my language... Not
AMOSPRO!

ps. I've just noticed that You use LightWave thats suposed to be good! Is it
better than Imagine? by the way I used Imagine on my old A600 with 2mb of
ram... So perhaps thats why it was so slow! But I still found it
unuserfreindly.... And i din't have a manual... I managed to create a box
with legs and a fish scene (Two tutorials that was in AF or something!) but
thats as far as i got! Great huh!

Okay! I'm guessing that this was to me! As no one else really seems to talk
about the calls! I only have a limited knowledge of Calls... I know more
GFXcalls than anything else.... And they seem to be pretty fast!

heres a list of someof the things that I can do with calls!

Open close Windows + Pub. Screens... Wow! Amazing huh?
refresh and redraw Windows + screens
DisplayBeep!
Plot on win + screen
Return the Colour of a Pixel(on a screen) (the same as the Amos Com.
Point(X,Y))
Draw, Bar, Box, and circle on Pub screens.
Clear Screen!
WriteText - I'm still tryin to figure the Flags for this one!
Return the WB + Screen + Window rastport
Make your own Guru Alert!
Execute a Program!

Okay! This may not sound like much.... but once you have the Rastport of a
screen you can do anything with that screen! Resize it... refresh it. Move
it. Change its palette... Close it (Amazing!) ... Put the Graphic Functions
to it!.... Load 256 col images! Read the mouse coords from any screen!

Some Progs I have that are in Sendable state are!
Load 256 col image to Pub Screen!
Grab the workbech Screen!
And my Tron game that uses a Pub screen! (This isn't finished yet tho!)

I can't think of anything else yet! It may not look like much on paper...
But it took me and Andi AAAAGGGGGEEEESSSSS to work them out manually! Thats
a lot of crashes! coz put the wrong param and Bye Bye Amiga!

I will send you these if you want? I Hope they will be of use....

Okay! Does anyone have any idea why the workbench screen and its bitplanes
is so strange... its set up totally different to any other screen! To Grab
it you have to read in one row of bytes... then jump rows*(depth of
BitPlanes) and read in again... and so on..... WEIRD!

Does anyone know how to load in libraries without Amos Crashing? At the
moment I am stuck just using the set Int Gfx and Dos! I don't suppose you do
jono?

Bye! Phil!

   Exactly!!  Keith, have you been looking at my code again?!  This is
   the same method I use to break out of loops, whether they be in
   BASIC, C or whatever... it is logical and safe. 


> Goto is useless.

   Well, I wouldn't say it is completely useless, but completely
   unnecessary... hmm, I guess that sort of equals the same thing in the
   end, doesn't it.  haha.  :)

   Anyway, someone was asking about Goto and why they are advised
   not to use it...
   Goto is a throwback to the first programming languages, there was a
   time when Goto was the ONLY command we had for passing control
   around a program.  As the size and complexity of programs
   increased, Goto became increasingly more cumbersome to work with
   and introduced what is known as Spaghetti Code, not a good thing.

   A major evolution occured which was the dawn of structured
   programming, definitely a good thing.  These languages added
   powerful contol structures such as Repeat...Until, While...Wend, etc.
   all things which programmers were previously forced to implement
   by relying on Goto... 

   Anyway, that's about the way I remember it... I can remember being
   so amazed when I was first exposed to a While... Wend loop
   structure and real procedures... radical stuff at that time.  This was
   before they were commonly accepted, but it was obvious they were
   preferable to Goto!!!

I spent a hundred quid on blitz, less than 50 on amos, and amos convincingly
wins, for a couple of blindingly stupid things in blitz.

One: Blitz insists on your procs being in order.
Two: Its as solid as a blancmange.

Oops, forgot to skip "a lot of code"

BTW, your code forgets to dereference the next, and the if, and the other
if, and the loop.  You are relying on the "end proc" to close everything
down for you.  Yuk.
 
Procedure SOMEPROC
   'a lot of init code
   Do
      'a lot of code
      If SOMETHING
         For I=WHATEVER To WHATEVER2
            If SOMETHING_ELSE
               i=whatever2
               skip=true
            End If
         Next
      End If
      if not skip
          'a lot of code
      end if
   Loop	
   'a lot of cleanup code
End Proc

Which is a horrible way of writing code, but its better than the goto, as
everythng is closed down cleanly.  I have had to debug other peoples work
before, and people make such a mess....   The dominant code in your loop
is a "lot of code", rather than the use of a goto, which is a conditional
chunk, so rewrite the condition out of the loop, or seperate your loops.
Why are you putting so much in ONE procedure ?  Would it be easier to 
seperate them out perhaps ?  Now your excercise for today is to rewrite
your loop nice and cleanly with the code to skip outside the loop.

:-P

Next goto for me to kill please..

Goto is useless.

Lightwave is superb..  much much easier than Imagine.
(up until a month ago I used Imagine 5, but LW's so nicer)
If you want I'll send you an example of my Lw work
(after 1 month, jpegged -  only 40k or so.?)

Yeah an FPU makes an enormous difference, and some software won't
even work without one. (without an FPU you lose loads of rendering
speed and you can't use things like Forge and Texture Studio.
also you can only use approx 8 of Imagine's 120+ procedural
textures as they require an FPU.)

For my next trick, this is how to implement a looping on/off thing
without messing about much.

while 1
	a=1-a
	print a
wend

Well, I suppose you could use it to scramble code, make it unreadable,
jump all over the place and fill the stack with unreturned values,
crash the system with an illegal call and suddenly return to the
wrong part of the program when you finally pop the stack...

I would strongly advise putting your conditional tests at the beginning
with while...wend as opposed to repeat...until.  Trust me.  You have
a lot more control over while/wend.  Repeat/until is only usefull if
you absolutely, positively, HAVE to run a loop at LEAST once.

If you don't mean 'load in' the same way in which 'Lib Open' works then I
don't know. This command seems to load the library in without crashing.

Subject: [amos-list] FORTRAN Gotos
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: pbrowne@qantas.com.au



Hi all,

I have to add my two cents on the GOTO debate.

I use FORTRAN at work, and it's probably the most widely used command in
our entire system.  I must confess to using GOTO's regularly in my FORTRAN
code (I tried once to go without it, but it's amazing how ugly and
unreadable to code becomes (and inefficient!) when everything is
conditional).  DO loops are the main culprit, as jumping out of the loop is
much better than letting the loop complete until it's end (DO loops are NOT
conditional in FORTRAN - at least not the version of FORTRAN I use).

However, in all my playing around with AMOS, I think I used a GOTO once -
and only as a simple debugging tool that I discarded once I had my problem
solved.  The Conditional Loops available in AMOS are good.  They make
things much easier and more "structured".

So kiddies, don't use GOTO's unless the alternative is worse or
non-existent.  In AMOS, I don't really see the need at all.

Phil  8-)

p.s:  For your consideration:  is an Exit command just as bad as a GOTO?
(Probably not, now that I think of it, as GOTO's can go BACKWARDS... which
is what makes them REALLY bad if misused!)

Phil  (-8

Subject: [amos-list] Amos 3D - OM
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: pbrowne@qantas.com.au



Hello again,

I need some help.  I tried to use OM (the Object Modeller for Amos 3D) on
my A3000 last night... and it doesn't work!  (I get a flickering mess of a
screen that just doesn't WORK).  It's been a while since I last used it,
probably before I upgraded to OS3.1 - I think that's the problem.  However,
I remember long, long ago when it first came out, that to run OM on an
A3000 (or maybe just WB2.x) something needed to be done in the
startup-sequence.  Of course, I cannot remember what this was!!!  Can
anyone remember?  Does anybody know what I can do?

I really want to start using Amos 3D again - I know it's slow, but I think
that with some thought, it's features can be exploited usefully.  If worse
comes to worse I can do my modelling on my A500 - but it's a hassle
transferring back and forth...

Thanks to anyone who can help me!

Phil  8-)

   Haha...  and there you have it from Braneloc, The Amazing himself.
   
   What is it with all of these numeric literals... I prefer something
   like...

   NOTDONE=True
   While NOTDONE
      A=1-A 
      Print A
      '  ...Insert conditional check for exiting loop here
   Wend


>>> Goto is useless.

   The problem is that you are going to have people saying "well, you
   just don't know how to use Goto effectively... if you're really GOOD,
   I mean a REALLY REALLY GOOD programmer like me then you can
   use Goto without causing all of those problems!!"... haha.

   Not to mention that if you move to C or C++ there is no direct
   replacement for Repeat...Until, but there is the same old While...
   Wend structure.  Of course, you can use Do...While in C/C++, but the
   logic is reversed.  Actually, I have always found Repeat...Until to be
   quite effective in AMOS, but you do need to keep in mind that
   your code will be executed a minimum of one time, as Keith has
   pointed out.

   And there you have it... your weekly lesson in entertainment and
   good programming practice brought to you by Keith Hill, floquet and
   yours truly.
   
   Enjoy!!  :-)

Dear all,

Im sick and tired of everyone bitching about how crap Blitz is in =
comparison to Amos, first of all  you obviously havent used blitz to =
come to that conclusion and secondly you obviously havent used amos =
enough to know its limitations.

Blitz's strength is its compiler and integrated AGA and intution =
support, not to mention messing with DMA, its biggest draw back is its =
documentation and its poor editor.

Amos's strength is its easy to use editor and almost crash free =
environment, its drawback is its poor performance.

All programming tools have their strengths and weaknesses, put their =
strengths to good use!!!!!

Is this true?  (no pun intended...)

That would have to be a serious bug in the compiler!

   Well, that's go to apply to AMOS only because it is common practice to
   define TRUE and FALSE as constants in other languages... Weird,
   how many little bugs like this are found in AMOS...

So? End Proc can do that. Tell me honest, if you were doing something like

Why do you use this instead of Exit? It doesn't skip any code you might
have below End If, and it is less obvious for what it does.

BTW, Do Loop should be replaced with Repeat Until skip , right?

It certainly is. And if you have some more exiting in a lots of code, that

But why is it better then Goto? In this case, Goto is much more visible
then anything other, and it _does_ make cleaner, faster and shorter code.

Because local variables from a procedure can't be used in any other
procedure. If Amos would have sub-procedures like Pascal, and you could
define Global variables for sub-procedures or Shared in sub-procedures, I
would probably use that.

KH> your loop nice and cleanly with the code to skip outside the loop.

But that code has to be inside a loop. And loop had more exits except this
one.

KH> Goto is useless.

And what about exiting nested loops in C?

Are you talking about me? Well, I'm not a really really good programmer
speaking both about my programs and amount of theory I know (very little).
But I don't want to be dogmatic about anything, and if I couldn't think of
a good example for Goto, I would probably reply that there might be some
cases where Goto is usable, but I don't know them. Have you seen all
programs in the world, so that you can tell that there is not a single
usable Goto in them?

BTW, goto for exiting from nested loops is *recommended* for use in C by
authors of C themselves. I have tried it, and I agree about that.

BTW2, I still don't know how to exit nested loops in Pascal...

That logic has always confused me, and for a long time I wasnt sure will
Repeat Until condition be looped if condition is true or false. Bwyatt in
POP had
a solution to this:

Do While
Loop

Do
Loop While

Do Until
Loop

Do
Loop Until

You could even make combinations like:

Do While
Loop Until

We should convince him to continue work ;)

Its other biggest drawback is lack of forward declarations and other missing
concepts.  It does have powerful features, is slightly faster, and has
genuine aga, but you have to really study to use it, and the code only works
on most machines, most of the time.  I spent a lot of time and money on blitz,
and it can't even do some of the most basic concepts, and that just drives me
nuts.  If you think I havn't used blitz, why is my suggestion at the top of
the blitz things to do list ?  Ah well.

..and is old, one or two of the commands are a bit buggy, and one or two of
the commands don't compile properly.  As a real programmer, I can work round
and bypass the limitations of amos, but without the facilities in blitz,
if it won't allow you to program cleanly, how can you bypass the problems ?

I suppose I just want my hundred quid back.

No.  First there Is a concept called "the stack".  Program jumps like gosub
or procedure calls put temporary variables here in a fifo format, and the
"return address" of all calls is put here.  Goto bypasses this, allowing you
to jump anywhere and do anything, but does nothing with the stack, hence
all of a sudden error messages if you are not carefull.  Exit uses the stack,
and pops out of the loop by artificially popping the stack and returning to
the correct point in the program.

That was a public information broadcast.

rtg? And do you know of any good extensions or ways of manipulating the

Hi there!

Okay cool! I have to wait then... oh it looks like i was too slow to answer
you last one andrew got there before me! How do you go about writing an
extension? do you have to have extensive knowledge of Asm? And with using
Asembler how do you get graphics on to the Amos Screens.... you must need
the Rastport or something? so how do you get it in asm? do you use a call?
Actually you would need to get a whole load of information of Amos to get
the commands working alongs side? so how is it done?

Sorry for askin somany questions i'm just curious.. as I would love to make
my own extension... It would be to do with Maths and Graphics! And lots of
different versions of the Copy command.. to give more control with the data
that is being moved? I mean it would make things so much easyier..
especially when manipulating Bitplanes to have a copy command that doesn't
write the 0's coz then you would have a masked copy! etc. Also a Better
Polygon command.... one that uses a proper polygontable and Flags! or maybe
a polygon to and a poly end command coz a the moment the problem is you have
to set the data the polygon uses at the beginning of the prog and that
amount of sides i fixed when ever you run the prog...
but you cant build a pollygon like this!...

for i=0 to 100
    polgon to x(i),y(i)
next i

Somethin like this would be good!

Start polygon 1
for i=0 ti 100
   polygon 1,x(i),y(i)
Anyway thanx? Till next time! Phil
End Polygon 1
Draw plolygon 1

or to be able to create a polygontable and get a command to use the table!
Do you have any ideas how i could learn to make an extension? Docs? or
source code? or should i just go write a 'Hello world' program coz an ext.
is way out of my league?

Bye! Phil!

Arise Sir Floquet! It isn't that hard It started off hard by
peeking,pokeing,dokeing,deeking,loking,and leeking at the places which would
be logical... You need to have an understanding of how the Amiga works
really!
but then I managed to get hold of The Official Library Includes and they
helped by telling the offsets and the params... but you still need to work
things out... I'll try and compile a list of the useful ones and send it to
you... but I started off by trial and error so it can't be that hard!

Ps. If you ever want Dma to the Amos Screens the Answers in the Logbase!


Us? theres more than one of you?

Bye for now Phil!

Cool! I agree with Nikola... it can be useful I don't use it but it can
be... So now thats been sorted pehaps this argument about a simple stupid
command could stop!
I don't like the if statement but hey! Its usefull but it is quite slow! I
think Amos should have a Case statement too!

"Oh leave me alone..... I'm walkin out of the door..... Leave me alone!"
- Natalie Imbruglia! Coz it what i'm listening to!
- What you don't realise is that Natalie was singing about a Certain command
in Amos!

Subject: [amos-list] Book Swap..!?!
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Stephen Thornber <SThornber@steve1.demon.co.uk>



Hi all


I was given an Amos book yesterday by a friend, but the book is
way over my head and only deals with games.

I'm wondering if anyone has a good amos book they wish to swap
for mine..?

I'm paticularly looking for Amiga Formats "Ultimate Amos"
by Jason Holborn

but any other good amos book would do.?

My book is called "Amiga Game Makers Manual" by
Stephen Hill.

(published by Sigma Press)

its 400 pages and it is in prefect condition, not a curled
page or a tear anywhere. 

BTW - I live in Blackpool, Lancs, UK


Steve.

Try this:

a=0 : b=0
Print a,b
Add a,2^2
b=b+2^2
Print a,b

In my opinon should give a=4 and b=4, right?

I get a=-2147483325 and b=4!

   Well, in a previous post I said that I don't think Goto is completely
   useless, but rather it is completely unnecessary due to advances in
   programming languages.  It's another question whether being
   unnecessary equals useless.  It's all a matter of style really... of
   course you could use Goto in loads of places and anyone is obviously
   free to do so, but some of us are simply saying there are better ways
   to handle this... for every place someone might use a Goto, we could
   provide a "non-Goto" (copyright 1998 Garfield Benjamin) solution.


> Have you seen all programs in the world, so that you can tell that
> there is not a single usable Goto in them?

   As a matter of fact I have... haha.  Of course I have not seen every
   program in the world, but then I do not need to.  I have seen and
   written enough programs to know there is always an elegant
   solution to replace a section of code relying on Goto.

   It's really a matter of preference and programming is a very personal
   thing... we each have our own style to a degree and no one can say
   what is right or wrong for someone else, we only know what is
   right for ourselves.  However, there are certain aspects of
   programming which are universally true and structured programming
   or object oriented programming introduced new methods which are
   "better" in many ways.

   Wow, I haven't used Pascal in a long time... from what I remember,
   it was a very nice language... kind of a cross between BASIC and C.

   Why not simply set your loop variables to equal the EndLoop states?
   Example in AMOS code ( to help us stay focused )

   For  REP1=1 To 10
      For REP2=1 To 100
         For REP3=1 To 1000
            If NEEDTOEXIT
               REP3=1001 : REP2=101 : REP1=11 
            End If
         Next REP3
      Next REP2   
   Next REP1

   That's the method I use in AMOS, BLITZ, C, etc.  Of course, you can 
   Pop out of AMOS and BLITZ's loop I believe, but I have always found
   it's easier to find a good solution then stick to it... that's part of
   the benefit of choosing the "right" solution... it is 100% portable
   between languages.

   Haha... yes, Ben is a clever guy.  Hmm... that idea about the
   combination looks a bit strange, now doesn't it?  We have a Do While
   loop condition at the top combined with a Repeat Until condition at
   the bottom... very unique.  Ben what were you thinking there?  Was
   this simply to illustrate that the programmer has complete flexibility??

   Okay, this has been interesting... talking about programming style is
   always a good thing, but we better stop and get back to pure AMOS,
   and I think that's where this thread began... :-)

To make a extension you will need:

a assembler (get phxass off aminet)
|Music.s    (AMOSPro_Tutorial:Extensions/)
and thats it.

Read |Music.s, its the source for the (useless) music extension,
it has all of the extra amos functions and macro definitions and stuff.

you'll need some knowledge of assembly, |music.s
and all amos extensions are compiled with GenAm,
which is crap compared to Phxass.

Phxass does everything that GenAm does, but its much faster
at compiling, for example, it takes GenAm about 10secs to compile
TGE, and PhxAss would do it in about 2secs.

I'll help you with any probs you encounter with extension coding 8)

I wouldnt say that, you just need to know move.l 8)
and things like shifting, swapping and stuff, its
all pretty basic, it just is harder to debug 8)
heres a tip tho that I used when coding TGE:
Dont Write Bugs.

it saves hours of time 8o)

Uhm, If you can't use libs then I advise you not to touch extension
coding for the time been 8o)
You'll need a much bigger and complex understanding of the amigas chips,
the CPU you code for( TGE is coded for 030...) and you'll need librarys
the whole time, espically exec. All the librarys you'll need will be
in the ROMS, so no files will be needed.

PS: Although Ive said TGE is coded for 030, it works on 000 but
    030 for best performance on the tmapping and such(complex gfx).

Hi all.

Well after having AmosPro for just about 5 days, I'm 100% hooked on it.
I may not be the fastest learner and my code may look sloppy to
most of you, but hey.... this is FUN..!!

For the past 5 days, every spare few minutes I get, I've been
hammering away at AmosPro, hey, I'm enjoying this.... :)

(although my fiancee isn't too happy ;)

I know this mail is mainly a waste of time/space, but I just
wanted to tell you all I'm having fun, and I'll be on this list
for a very long time to come.. :)

   I think we have a genuine programmer here... if this isn't the
   trademark of a great programmer trying to "break out", I don't what
   is...

   Haha... you have hit on AMOS's greatest strength... I have written 
   programs in many languages and across several machines, but
   there is something about AMOS that actually makes it that much
   more enjoyable (although more frustrating at times also... haha).

   No, I can imagine she isn't... ;-)

Um, I don't mean to be critical of your code, and please correct me if I'm
wrong (or was misinformed) but changing the index WITHIN the loop is a
No-No!  Now I don't know the REAL implications of this, and what you are
doing MAY be perfectly kosher in AMOS and some other languages (in my
FORTRAN manual it definately says "NO!" - and regrettably FORTRAN is the
language I use most, so forgive me for falling back to it)...

I await your reply in anticipation...

Hi Andrew!

I found your "version" code, fascinating.
and I'm currently coding a gui front end for it, which also
uses the asl file requester.

(I'm crediting you for the main code, I hope you don't mind me
altering it..? - I hate the amos file requester.)

I should have it tested/finished and compiled in a day or so.
would you like a copy of it when its done..?
(it'll only be somthing like 25k..?)

BTW - I'm hoping to incorporate a progress bar in the gui,
so you can tell how far it has searched through the file
you picked.  but it may be too hard to do..? anyway, I'll try.


Steve

I know of several free e-mail providers if you need some. You might want to
try Net@ddress (http://netaddress.usa.net), which I use. They're both a Web
and POP access provider (with upto 5MB of server-side storage per account).
Another good one is iName, and of course almost every search engine under
the sun nowadays offers free e-mail accounts: Yahoo, Hotbot, Alta Vista.

   No problem... you can be critical... haha.  Well, I don't know what
   to tell you other than I have always done this and never
   encountered any problems... 

   Perhaps there is some weird aspect of FORTRAN which makes it
   a "No-No", but that really makes little sense... why not try it in
   FORTRAN, after all manuals are known to be inaccurate from time to
   time...  :-)

   Anyway, I'd be interested in hearing what happens... I can't imagine
   why you couldn't use this method, it works in every other language
   I've tried.  I mean you're only changing the value of a variable, it
   doesn't matter whether it's used in a loop or not... again, unless
   FORTRAN is doing something really strange.

OK, just quickly 'cause I'm supposed to be WORKING ;) , I re-read my
manual, where it states quite clearly...

"the DO-variable of the DO-loop can neither be redefined nor become
undefined during execution of the range of the DO-loop.  It is your
responsibility to ensure that such redefinitions don't occur."

Ignoring this, I tried to alter the DO-variable as you suggested, but the
compiler didn't like that one bit! ...

      DO 1501 II = 1 , 12
         II = 13
1501  CONTINUE
*ERROR 1902 at line 550 Assignment result 'II' is an active DO variable

So, it seems the responsibility wasn't mine at all!  :)  (as mentioned in
the manual).

Silly bloody thing... but that's FORTRAN for you!  When I started work here
8 years ago, I already thought FORTRAN was dead... and I'm STILL coding in
it!!!

I can only hope AMOS lasts as long!

   Very interesting... I wonder why it won't allow it?  Anyway, I'm glad
   you tried this as I would not have believed it... haha.  As they say,
   you learn something new everyday.  :-)

   Yes, I thought FORTRAN was dead... haha.  It's really amazing how
   COBOL keeps hanging in there and actually appears to be growing
   in popularity.  

   Well, thanks again for sharing that... perhaps the loop problem is
   caused because FORTRAN is such an old language and they probably
   thought that actually changing the loop variable was too advanced
   or something... remember at the time FORTRAN came out, our
   industry was very, very young and basically, the knowledge that
   people had was pretty limited compared to now.  Haha.

Whoa, hold on. Why shouldnt we discuss Amos programming? I'm learning stuff
here!

Those correspondents  who maybe work in computer programming can be a bit
high and mighty. Amos on the Amiga was for me the next generation of
hobbyist programming after the BBC micro and BBC basic. I missed that phase
but I have been hope & poking around with Amos for quite a few years. I'm
probably never going to create commercial software, ( oh all right, I'm
NEVER going to. See my Othello game on CUAmiga CD(26?) if you dont believe
me!! ). I just love the programming experience. I have no contact with other
programmers, other than here and have learnt all I can from the Amos manual.
You will gather that there are areas of skill that I havnt picked up. I have
been studying the program snippets in this correspondence and trying to
understand them. Please remember that there must be other readers at the
same stage as myself. Thank you all for your patience.

(Yet Another Message About Goto) 8)

Hello,
Here are some personal opinions:

Concerning the trick consisting of changing the value of the iterator in
the loop is... a trick !
You'd better use this:

I=MINVALUE
COND=False
While (Not COND) and (I <= MAXVALUE)
	'(code setting somewhere COND to True)
	Add I, MYSTEPVALUE
Wend

I've been a professional programmer for more than 10 years. Understand
"I'm paid for this" and not "I am a genius" 8))
I've been programming for more than 15 years.
Computing is a science. So there are rules to be respected. When I was
studying comp-science, no teacher told us about GOTO.
I don't intend to teach you how to do, but there are 4 main structures
used in programming, in EVERY language  :
- The sequence : Some instructions one after the other
- The condition : If/Then/Else/Endif
- The unconditional loop : For/Next
- The onditional loop : While/Wend or Repeat/Until.
A code respecting these structures can be easyly ported into another
language (Amos->C, QBASIC->Amos, Amos->DbaseIII, etc...)
There is no place for Goto in these structures, except for low-level
languages, where you need to convert:
REPEAT                      LABEL1:
	blabla   >>Into>>       blabla
UNTIL CONDITION             IF not CONDITION GOTO LABEL1

Concerning EXITs, POP PROCs and other ways to quit a loop, a program (or
procedure, subroutine,etc) must have a beginning, a body and an end.
Using Exits or Pop procs don't allow the end of a procedure where you
could do some interesting things.

You can find the equivalent in other professions:
For example, you can put at home a wallpaper upon another, but pros
don't, they remove the old one before. The result is the same : You get
a blue room.

You are FREE to use gotos, I don't want to disgust you (all) from using
Amiga & Amos. Hobbyists are not bad programmers because they use GOTOs.
Pros just prefer to use the good old rules. Experience shows that a prog
without GOTOs is easier to debug or enhance. It works better, too,
because you _have_to_ analyse your needs before coding.

One last thing : Even some Pros use Gotos !

I apologise for being long, but I had to say that.

Not to bother your project, but why don't you just use the CLI command
Version? You could just make a Version button in your DOpus, which would then
tell the version number of your selected files.

okay this is still on the subject of Variable errors but not to do with the
add function!
I Think either My AmosPro 2.00 has gone strange, I'm going strange or I have
A Virus! Coz Everytime I try a load Amos now it loads okay but all my progs
and the commands are doing very strange things! For example I run a
program... The program runs... it runs fine... i exit the program... The
program exits... return to Editor and my whole program has bits of Machine
code and Jibberish in it!

Also Normally when you type:

Print A

and A is'nt define... it returns a 0 but now all my variables Have strange
numbers and don't start off at 0! For example

A=-32655
B=12
c$= Now this string caused Amos to Spill out the whole contents of my memory
to the screen!

And then Sometimes I just get straight forward... AMOS HAS CRASHED!

the reason for all these weird things... I think is that something is
illegally poking Memory... It is poking over the stored locations of the
variables and is just filling them with Jibberish! That would explain the C$
printing out memory coz it doesn't have a CHR$(0) at the end of the variable
contents!

Or something is chaning Amos's pointers so that everything pointing to the
wrong things! This could be done by a Virus Quite Easily....

also Serval times i have had a small little box of fuzz apear at the corner
of workbench.. just like something was Poking dircetly to the Logbases and
BitPlanes of the screen! can anyone suggest some thing else coz i can't seem
to find the Virus! so perhaps it isn't... i dunno but i have to sort it now!
Otherwise i can't send things to people here or work on amosprojects!

Bye! Phil! I'm Having fun here! NO REALLY! (Sarcasm!)

Any ideas?

I used to use Devpac 3 until i lost it! thanx for the recamendation! I'll go
get it!
never heard of GenAm! At the mo I have a small little thing i downloaded
called Asmpro! I downloaded it by accident as I was looking for AmosPro
stuff! But it is
reeeaaalllly C**P!

Wow! I'm half way there already I know What Move.l does and I can shift a
swap stuff! As I have programed in asm before (only the basics) and I also
use the Asm commands in amos a lot!

okay! I will try not to write Bugs but I just LOOOOVVEE Writting them!


AMAZING FACT COMIN UP!

Due to my experience this is not the whole truth. I believe you have problems
when you do:

If NOTDONE

This will go crazy when compiled

If NOTDONE=True

Works however. The two lines should do exactly the same thing, but they don't
when being compiled.

   Exactly... I agree.  I generally use a While structure... they are made
   to allow premature exiting, so to speak.  In AMOS, of course you can
   use Repeat... Until in the same manner.

Because, I'm pretty sure that Pascal doesn't support that... haha.

The original poster said he was unable to find a way to exit from nested
loops in Pascal... I have found that the above works fine BASIC, C and
C++, and obviously Assembler.  

However, it is worth mentioning that you should rely on one of the While
or even Repeat loop structures if you are planning on prematurely
exiting the loops, they were designed to handle that.

Hang on a sec! Thats right I get that bug too! WEIRD!

Also Does anyone know where these commands come from! The thing is I don't
know wether they are from an extension or actuall amos Commands that aren't
listed in the help file!

Follow
Check

I don't know thier sytax... And i have no idea what they do but Amos will
except Follow as it is! But if you run this command Amos returns a Sytax
error while the prog is running? WEIRD! = 7

I also thought this was a command to...

Remove

But all it is is a Rem statement of ove
same as!!!
'ove

Cool! = ) Duh!!!!

Thanx! I know... I have a Hotmail Address but Attachments don't work with
it! So I'm actually getting one with a BT server... I'm just trying to sort
it out at the moment!
But I may as well leave it for the mo as that means changing my amoslist!

Thankyou for the idea!

Nah, I'll code up some 68k routines and slap them in TGE.

If you baught AMOSPro you got the disk..if not you didnt...
also if you baught amos pro you get the entire manual built-in,
and a example demos of every command.

I think platon released better source, I'll send you it.

how could you use DevPac without hearing of genam ?!?!?!?!?!!?
genam IS the executable name for devpac!!!!!
like when you by devpac you get:

crap editor,
assembler called 'GenAm'
debugger called 'MonAm'
and a small few other bits and pieces.

AsmPro ?!?
I think you mean AsmOne 8o)

8o)
There comes a time when you can write about 4/5screens of asm
and not need to check it as you know that you havnt coded bugs.

hehe yes it does 8o)
just turn case sensitivity off 8o)
only in E you have to use case sensitivity.

Get STRICQ off aminet.

for a start thats wrong!
or it will work, but its not perfect.
move.l  $4.w,a6 is the proper way, its 2 whole

You dont need anything else ;)

hehe ok 8o)
Just when you were having trouble with libs it looked like
you didnt code asm before, and you need asm for extensions.

okok, I was just making a point that asm without libs is useless.

ouch, hit the hardware eh ?
bad idea, that will just crash on a new amiga,
if there ever is such thing...

yep, it will preform a bit better than the 030@50 as it does dual cpu cycles
but the 030(single cycle) would be a bit slower, the 040 woul d do it in about
1.2-1.5 times faster
