                 ----------------------------------------

Disclaimer
----------

	The program PatchAMOS will modify your AMOS1.3 program.
	I take no resposibility if it wreck's it - make sure you
        have a backup.

	I also take no responsibilty explicitly, implicity, and all
        that other legal crap if something else that you didn't want
        to happen does, 'cos i'm still in an irresponsible mood!



Distribution
------------

	Whatever - modify / copy / hack to pieces. Please post me
	back any improvements - these are among my first E programs,
        so the sources can probably be improved.

Requirements
------------

	AMOS V1.36 - NOT AMOSV1.3,AMOSV1.34,AMOSV1.35 etc. A few
	bytes are overwritten in the AMOS program file - they may
        be at a different location in different versions of AMOS.

	ReqTools Library - Any version will probably work - I only
        use the file requester.




Overview
--------

	When you load AMOS, it searches for one the files:

		:AMOS_System/AMOS1_3_Pal.Env
		:AMOS_System/AMOS1_3_Ntsc.Env

	And loads the appropriate one for your country. These files
	contain your amos configuration. Running PatchAMOS modifies
        AMOS so it only searches for T:AMOS1_3.Env

	GetAMOSEnv opens a reqtools filerequester in your AMOS_System
        directory from which you can select an envoironment to copy to
        T:AMOS1_3.Env



Installation
------------

	Much easier than V1.0 now - just double click the installer
	icon - plenty of help is available. 



Usage
-----

	Double click on the "Amos Env-Loader" icon. Select An 
	Envoironment.




Multi-Selection
---------------

	To load AMOS with an AMOS program in the editor & run the
	program, select the program icon, then shift double-click
	the "Amos Env-Loader" icon.




Toolmanager
-----------

	AMOS Multi-Env works great from a toolmanager dock window, or
	toolmanager App Icon. Simply create an exec object to the Amos
	script, of type CLI, which has the "Arguments" box checkmarked.
	Then create an image object, and a dock / icon object to launch
	it.

	To run Amos from toolmanger, click on the dock icon / app icon.
	To load a file into Amos from toolmanager, drop the file on the
	dock icon / app icon.



Notes / Hints
-------------

	Create a default envoironment call AMOS1_3.Env, as this
	is the default name in the file-selector.
	

	The AMOS compiler uses the envoironment specified by it's
        own configuration files - Not the envoironment you select
	with this filerequester.


	If you are using a harddisk, Load Config1_3.AMOS, and insert 
	an "AMOS:" before all pathnames in the Load Extensions, and
	other menus, then move your AMOS_System directory to your
	AMOS directory. This script assigns AMOS: before loading
	AMOS, so everything will work, and the path of your AMOS
	System directory will be "AMOS:AMOS_System" which many
	AMOS programs expect it to be.

	Get toolmanger, and use it - it's easily the best way to
	load amos. If you do this set the save with icons option
	in the AMOS configuration editor so your programs have
	icons to drop on the toolmanager dock/app icon.



Credits
-------

        GetAMOSEnv, and PatchAMOS were both written in E. Thanks
        go to Wouter van Oortmerssen for a rather nice language.

	Reqtools.library is written by Nico Francois.

	Toolmanager was written by Stefan Becker.


	The E language, Reqtools & Toolmanager are all available
	on aminet. Thanks also to whoever it was that posted to the
	AMOS mailing list about removing/installing extenions for
        the inspiration!




Changes V1.0 ---> V1.1
----------------------

 	Both E programs now use exception handling for error
	recovery, and print errors to requesters, not the command line.

	PatchAMOS can now accept the AMOS file to patch as a
	command line argument.

	Both programs now accept the argument in double quotes.

	The installer script now creates a customised launching
	script for your system - there is no "Amos" file in the
	distribution anymore.

	The cancel button in the filerequester now cancels the
	loading of AMOS.

	Shift-Selected / Toolmanager / CLI arguments to the AMOS
	script are passed on to AMOS1.36 so you can autoload & run
	programs.
