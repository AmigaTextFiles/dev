@node INTRO "Abk2Mod v2.5 - Overview"

                              @{b}OVERVIEW@{ub}

  Abk2Mod converts AMOS Music Banks into standard ProTracker modules,
  using an easy-to-use grafical interface: it handles banks created with
  AMOSMusic Konverter, GCM2Abk and, theorically, SonixConverter. The
  reason that lead me to write this program was the impossibiity to see
  AMOS musics in a Protracker-like program: I really love see my modules
  working in Protracker...

  Abk2Mod is @{i}SHAREWARE@{ui}, this is to say that if you use it, you are
  morally obliged to @{"register" LINK REG}, obtaining in this way the
  full working Abk2Mod package. Since I heard about many people that uses
  Abk2Mod without registering, I decided to put a series of boring
  requester when entering/exiting from the program. To make registering
  as easy as possible I've introduced a keyfile system: infact since
  2.0 version you can get new releases of Abk2Mod directly from my
  homepage or from Aminet (dev/amos) and then use the keyfile to
  make it registered. And, last but not least, for the happyness of
  every-without-money people, the basic registration is FREE!
  Go to the @{"registration chapter" LINK REG} for more infos.

  @{i}NOTE: my English is not very well, so don't blame me about mistakes in 
        this English version of Abk2Mod manual. I think that not-italian 
        people prefere a mistaken English than a perfect Italian.
        If you find mistakes, please correct them and send me the doc: 
        I ask you to not redistribute it without my permission.@{ui}

@node REG "Abk2Mod v2.5 - Registration"

                             @{b}REGISTRATION@{ub}

  You can register Abk2Mod in two ways: as USER or as SUPPORTER. In both
  cases you will recienve a keyfile with your personal data encrypted,
  that will disable/enable some functions.

  USER
     This keyfile is FREE, but you can only receive it via electronic
     mail. The keyfile is valid only the version you asked for, and a
     single user can't ask this keyfile @{i}more than three times@{ui}. This
     keyfile will disable all shareware requester but will not enable
     the 'Play Mod' option. Simply send me the @{"regform" LINK regform} filled in
     all its parts via email.

  SUPPORTER
     If you want to hear the converted module before saving it on disk,
     then you should register as supporter. This keyfile is not FREE
     (see the table below) and you can obtain it via e-mail or snail-mail
     only sending the @{"regform" LINK regform} completed in all its part along with the
     sum of money required. This keyfile will be valid for all future
     future versions of Abk2Mod. If the keyfile structure will change
     a new working keyfile will be resent to you freely.

  You can find Abk2Mod updates in my homepage or in Aminet (dev/amos).
  If someone translate this manual in a language not yet present he can
  obtain a FREE SUPPORTER keyfile. Please before starting on a work, tell
  me that, because someone could have done it before you!

      THE REGISTERED KEYFILE CAN NOT BE REDISTRIBUTED IN ANY FORM!!

  I will not forgive pirates: think twice before coping to friends or to
  pirate sites the registered keyfile of Abk2Mod or before modifing it
  without my written permission. I think that the registration fee is very
  low, I made Abk2Mod shareware not to make money but to know all its
  users. The regfee is only a small return for the time spent on this
  program.

@node NUOVA "Abk2Mod v2.5 - News of this version"

                     @{b}NEWS OF THIS VERSION@{ub}

  @{b}Sample Loop@{ub}
  Now Abk2Mod checks if the loop value is correct. In some cases in
  fact this valuse was greater than sample size.

  @{b}Unknown Notes@{ub}
  In the 2.1 version could happen that some converted notes was
  undeciphrable to ProTracker that showed ??? in its tracks. Now
  notes are checked and unknown ones removed.

  @{b}Mistaken Positions@{ub}
  In some cases the number of position was mistaken, 128 instead of
  the real number. Naturally this caused some problems to ProTracker.

  @{b}Added Effects@{ub}
  Some GMC effects was not succesfully recognized and Abk2Mod showed
  an 'internal error'. Now these effects have been implemented and
  if an internal error during conversion occurs now Abk2Mod lets you
  choose if to ignore the error or to abort the conversion. So from
  this version if an error happens Abk2Mod will not exit suddendly.

  @{b}File Requesters@{ub}
  First of all a pattern gadget has been added to all filerequesters,
  so while loading a bank only file ending with '.abk' will be showed
  and the same thing happens when saving a PT module. Then each
  filerequester buffer is allocated separately, so each requester will
  mantain in memory the directory and filenames previously pointed.
  Finally, the save-filerequester rescan the selected dir whenever
  opened.

  @{b}Pre-v39 Amiga incompatibility@{ub}
  From 2.0 version to 2.4 in Abk2Mod there was a v39 only intruction
  and obviously this was the cause of Guru under pre-v39 machines.
  Now the code is completely v37+ compatible.

  @{b}PT Module Replayer@{ub}
  The built-in module replayer has been removed (it was bugged) and
  replaced by a shared library, the 'ptreplay.library'. To make this
  library working the module now is loaded in CHIP ram.

  @{b}AmigaE Compiler@{ub}
  At last! Now I can use the AmigaE compiler v3: better code, size and
  performace (and debugging).
@endnode

@node HARD "Abk2Mod v2.5 - Hardware & Software Requirements"

                 @{b}HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS@{ub}

  In order to run Abk2Mod requires an Amiga v37+ (WB2.04+), some AMOS
  Music Banks, and in LIBS: two shared libraries must be present:

  reqtools.library - © Nico Francois   (required, not supplied)
  ptreplay.lubrary - © Andreas Pålsson (optional, not supplied)

  You can easily find this two libraries in Aminet. Remember that if the
  'ptreplay.library' is not present in LIBS: Abk2Mod will work fine but
  you will not be able to hear modules directly from Abk2Mod.

  The keyfile that you will receive after registering should be placed
  in L: directory.
  
 @{i} NOTE: since version 2.0, Abk2Mod is not compatible with 1.3 Amiga.
        If the request will be high enough, I will create a 1.3 compatible
        version.@{ui}

@node USARLO "Abk2Mod v2.5 - How to use the program"

                       @{b}HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM@{ub}

  After launching Abk2Mod a little GUI appears. Here you can find some
  gadets, controlling the program.
  
  @{b}LOAD@{ub}
    opens the filerequester in order to choose the AMOS Bank to convert.
    When loaded the bank is converted into standard tracker module.

    NOTE: the AMOS Bank must be a music one and not a sample, sprite or
          icons bank, otherwise the program will not load it. 
         
  @{b}SAVE@{ub}
    opens the requester in order to select the location and name of the
    just converted module.
  
  @{b}PLAY MOD@{ub}
    start playing the just converted module. This gadget allows you to
    hear the module before saving it, letting you saving time in the
    case of a corrupted module or mistaken selections.
    To stop playing simply click to 'Stop' in the requester that will
    appear.

    NOTE: this gadget is only enabled if a SUPPORTER keyfile is present
          in L: and the 'ptreplay.library' is located in LIBS:.
  
  @{b}INFO@{ub}
    shows some infos about the author and the program.
  
  @{b}QUIT@{ub}
    aborts the program. Remember to save any converted module before
    exiting otherwise you will loose it!.
        
  @{b}LED@{ub}
    enable/disable the LED command conversion. Please refer to
    @{"LED ON/OFF" LINK CORR} for more infos.
        
  When a bank is loaded, Abk2Mod converts it. Then then gadget @{i}SAVE{ui} will be
  enabled as well as @{i}PLAY MOD@{ui}, so you can save or hear it.
  No errors should occur during conversion, since the converting routine
  is well coded, but if something goes wrong a requester will inform you
  of this. Please if any errors happen please send me the incriminated module
  for debugging.
@endnode

@node CORR "Abk2Mod v2.5 - The LED ON/OFF conversion"

              @{b}THE LED ON/OFF (E00,E01) CONVERSION@{ub}

  The AMOS Music Converter handles any "Exx" command as the one to
  enable/disable the LED (filter). Abk2Mod gives you the chance of avoiding
  any LED commands. If the @{b}LED@{ub} gadget is enabled all commands will
  be converted, otherwise, if the @{b}LED@{ub} gadget is disabled, the
  E00 and E01 command will be skipped. If you are in doubt, convert the bank
  with the led command enabled, and if it plays wrong, reconvert it disabling
  the LED command.

  NOTE: the module in memory is not affected from status changes of the
        LED gadget. You must reload the module to hear differences!
 
@endnode

@node BUGS "Abk2Mod v2.5 - Known bugs"
  
                            @{b}KNOWN BUGS@{ub}

  Coding a program is not simple: the best programmer also ever makes
  mistakes, and the resulting program suffers of bugs. Since I'm not
  infallible, Abk2Mod can contain bugs somewhere. If you find one of
  them please report it to me. The program has been tested using
  AMOS Banks produced by AMOS Music Konverter v2.1 and GMC2Abk.
  If you can test Abk2Mod with a module created by SonixConverter
  please tell me the results and eventual problems.

  @{b}For Enforcer Fans@{ub}
  From version 2.1 Abk2Mod is EnforcerHit-free. All illegal memory
  accesses have been removed, so now the program should be compatible
  with all Amiga models.

@endnode

@node ERRORI "Abk2Mod v2.5 - Error messages"

                          @{b}ERROR MESSAGES@{ub}

  During execution of Abk2Mod some errors may occur. Here a full
  description of each one ("->" represents a probable solution):

  @{b}COULD NOT OPEN FILE@{ub}
       the file you choosed doesn't exist or is unreadable.
    -> Make sure that the selected file exists, is readable 
       (protection bit 'r' enabled), and that is not corrupted.

  @{b}NOT AN AMOS MUSIC BANK@{ub}
       the file you selected is not an AMOS Music Bank or is corrupted.
    -> Make sure that the selected file is the right one and that is
       a music bank.
    
  @{b}NOT ENOUGH MEMORY@{ub}
       There is not enough memory to convert the module. Although Abk2Mod
       works fine on a 512K Amiga, in order to convert big modules
       1Mb is required. The contiguos CHIP memory available must be at
       least the double of the module size.
    -> Close all programs working in background and if it's not enough
       buy a memory expansion card ;)
       
       This error may occur even if a lot of memory is available: the
       Amiga memory is defragmented and Abk2Mod requires contiguos
       CHIP memory.
    -> Reset your Amiga and retry.
    
  @{b}CONVERSION ERROR@{ub}
       An internal error has occurred during conversion. You can 'ignore'
       the error or abort the conversion.
    -> Send me the module that caused the error
  
  @{b}COULD NOT READ/WRITE FILE PROPERLY@{ub}
       Abk2Mod can't read or write the module on that certain support.
       This can be caused by several factors: above all an unreadable
       disk track, or a full device (like disk, or HD).
    -> Change the support for the module you want save/load. Make sure
       that in the disk the space is enough to contain the converted
       module.
    
  @{b}COULD NOT OPEN xxx.LIBRARY@{ub}
       Abk2Mod can't find a required library. All these libraries must
       be placed in your LIBS: drawer.
    -> Make sure that Abk2Mod is @{"installed" link HARD} properly.

@node STORIA "Abk2Mod v2.5 - History"

                          @{b}ABK2MOD HISTORY@{ub}

  v0.9ß  Beta-version, released only to betatesters.

  v1.0ß  Beta-version; completely rewritten using AmigaE language.
         Better interface, size and performace.

  v1.1ß  Beta-version; gadget shortcuts added, better handling of
         requesters. Now "reqtools.library" is closed when the program
         terminate. Strange loops has been deleted. Better samples
         conversion (no more truncated samples). More optimized code.

  v1.2ß  Beta-version; if during conversion an error happens, the program
         exits legally, closing all libraries and GUI. Better memory 
         handling, it will be ever deallocated.
         
  v1.3ß  Beta-version; minor bugs fixed, added the Protracker module
         replayer. Now gadgets selected by shortcuts are rendered.
         
  v2.0   New graphic interface: more userfriendly and, above all, font
         sensitive. Added compatibility with music banks created by
         GMC2Abk and, theorically, by Sonix Converter (not tested).
         Added gadget 'Led' to let the user choose if convert the filter
         commands E01, E00. Sometimes loops was  mistaken like the number
         of pattern positions: fixed!

  v2.1   Now Abk2Mod is EnfocerHit-free: it should be compatible with all
         actual and future Amiga models. New keyfile system.

  v2.2   The converted notes now are checked to be real (no more ???
         in ProTracker). The loop conversion should be correct now.
         Added to filerequesters a pattern gadget (setted to #?mod#?
         for modules and #?.abk for banks). Filerequester now are
         bufferized separately: each filerequester mantain its settings
         when reopened. Code recompiled using AmigaE v3. Removed a
         nasty bug while writing positions in the converted module.

  v2.3   Removed some minor bugs: the gadget name in the load requester
         was improperly setted to 'Save'. The module name conversion
         was not bullet proof. The savefilerequester now rescan the
         directory whenever opened. Some GMC commands were not
         recognized, but now they are! The internal replayer has been
         removed (cause: too bugged!).

  v2.4   New module replayer: now the "ptreplay.library" is used.
         The module now is created in CHIP ram (to allow the library
         to replay it correctly) and the 'Play' gadget now is
         disabled/enabled properly.

  v2.5   Some routines v39-only were used in Abk2Mod code. Now these
         functions have been removed and the program should work
         correctly unde 2.0 Amiga too.
