follows:

RESET TIMER - Resets the timer on bottom left of screen
SCROLLER    - Turns scrolling message on/off.  If Fast Mem is detected it will
              be on at the start otherwise you'll have to turn it on as it 
              slows down the menu/text reader scrolling!
EXIT TO DOS - Quits the menu.

DISPLAY MODE- Toggles between PAL and NTSC to cater for all users.
SAVE PREFS  - Saves the current colours, music switch and font

All pull-down menus have a keyboard shortcut which is listed at the right side
of command on the menu.
