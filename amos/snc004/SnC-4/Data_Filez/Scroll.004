Pah!  Well if you ain't read the introduction to this issue the bad news is the fact that this is THE very last issue of Sauce 'N' Code as you know it!  I've packed AMOS in and have moved to pastures new.  This don't mean AMOS has had it's day - just look at this issue!  Lots of super prods in the pipeline from NFA ... keep ya peeled eyes for PD releases throughout the year!  Don't forget to register enLOCK v3.0 and wash behind your ears; read The Word and be a good soldier.  C ya!     Mike
