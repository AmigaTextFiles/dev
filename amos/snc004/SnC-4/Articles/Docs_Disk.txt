As  a  special  'going  away'  present the complete source code to this menu
engine  has been left for you to scavage through.  All routines are included
as well as the required fonts, graphics etc.

You  may modify, adapt, update, bugfix etc etc anything in this code as I am
no  longer  using  it.   Everything is free ...  I do not need to know about
what your doing with it nor am I bothered how it is used.

All that I ask is you credit me on the main index screen in some way for the
original code; using either ßudda/NFA or Mike Carter as my name.

Hope you learn something from the code as well as making good use of it.
