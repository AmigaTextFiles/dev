     This is a little Example of how to use Intuition with
     Amos... it Opens up a Window on the Workbench Screen and
     will return you back to Amos once the 'Close Gadget' is
     pressed.. also will play a bell when you press the LMB
     inside the Window... It worked on KS1.3/3.0...

     (just a note: I basically have every
     define that is associated with windows inside the 
     _WINDOW_DEFINES[]... well none of them are needed if you just
     want to use their value instead )
