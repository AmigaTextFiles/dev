There is always a way to do this. Currently, I don't have enough
hardware docus about AGA, but I managed to 'open' a 640x512
(overscanned 736x580) interlace screen in 256 AGA colours and AGA
fades using my own copperlist.

The biggest problem is, that AMOS seems to reserve the screen memory
using AllocMem rather using AllocRaster which causes some really bad
effects: In AGA the prefetch modes require 64-bit aligned screen data
AND widths that are a multiple of 64, otherwise the display will be
quite currupted. Using AllocMem the memory blocks may not be 64-bit
aligned.

The following text has been cut out from HowToCode7:

---------------------->cut<------------------------------------------

Fetch Mode Required for Displays

*ALL* ECS and lower screenmodes require only 1x datafetch. All modes
run *FASTER* with at least 2x bandwidth, so try and use 2x bandwitdh
if possible.

This table only shows the minimum required fetchmode for each screen.

---------------------->cut<------------------------------------------

Fetchmodes of 1 are not a problem whereas 2 and 4 are. (Everyone can
try this out by Doke-ing $3 into $DFF1FC, to restore the value simple
press Amiga-A twice).

One more problem: AGA colours. There are no 256 24-bit colour
registers, but the same 32 OCS 12-bit colour registers for all the
colours. They are accessed by using a special register which switches
between the eight upper-bits and the eight lower-bits colour banks.
Very complicated and hardly any chance to get it into AMOS Screens.

FB> This would improve the readability while programming - right?

Would be very handy :-)

FB> It this possible and then what should I do? 

Hmmm no idea... Look at the code of the editor (which is an interface
program) and try to find it out :-)

Hi all.

I think i cannot use Intuition extension!
I tried to remove JD extension, running AMOS Pro from CLI, but nothing happened
(yes, something happened, my system always crashed!).

Someone told me to mount the null-handler. I saw in my l/ directory but it's
not present! What is this null handler? Where i can find it?

However, every other help is well accepted...

Thanks at all.

   PS: I heard the latest news about commodore's buy-out. A sign is expected 
   for April 21. I heard about Escom too, but i don't know much this compa-
   ny. I know it how a PC seller company and i don't like this...PC with 
   Commodore's logo but no more Amigas? Ahhhhhhhh.....this is a nightmare!
   Is there some german boy out there who can tell me more about Escom?

I recently heard of the possibility to connect a SVGA monitor to
your amiga 1200/4000 with the help of an adapter.
This made be able to display flickerfree modes in my workbench
on my new 15 inches SVGA monitor. It is wonderful.

However, when I program in amos and open new screens like

Screen Open 1,640,512,16,Laced+hires

ofcause the screen will be laced (laced+hires).

Is there a way to open a flickerfree 640*512 hires screen noninterlaced
in Amos? I would appreciate any help!

By the way, I am programming in Amos Pro 2.0 and I like the new editor,
but I would truely like to include different colours in the scource-code
while editing to emphazise the different level of commands etc. 
This would improve the readability while programming - right?

It this possible and then what should I do? 

Thanks for all possible help.

Has anybody ever tried the Sload-command ?
It should work with the following syntax:

Sload filenr,length TO addres

This generates an error, however. After trying Ssave, which does
work like it should, I looked in AmosPro.Lib. According to that file
the format should be:

Sload filenr TO a,b

Supplying the start of a bank to b or a for that matter does NOT
result in a bank containing part of a file!
Where is this command loading its data to, to what addres ?
Do you have any experience in using sload ?
Any help is greatly appreciated

Do
	Bob Clear
	`Move bobs with Amal
	`And also do a Scroll command
	Bob Draw
	Screen Swap

But my bobs are only being drawn on one of the pair of physical and

  The format of the Sload command is:

So to load data from file 1 into a 32k bank, you'd use:

The EasyLife extension you uploaded to Aminet is actually v1.09 when

says it is v1.09 and I can't get the AMOSGuide to work as it keeps saying 
Bank not reserved. What is wrong ?

One of 2 possible causes:

 - I forgot to copy the Easylife.Lib file from my APSystem directory 
   to the archive

 - There was not changes since V1.09 (which wasn't released) - only 
   the support programs have changed.

I think it is the later, although it may be the former - but I'm 100 
miles from my amiga at the moment.

I think the only bank used was for the structued variables. If you 
have somehow deleted it (12), run the structures compiler accessory
on AmosGuide.AMOS to create it 


I have also had a report of a guru (0100000f - Memory freed twice) 
when using the Elopen Font/Elset Font/ElClose Font routiines from
stephen hill. I can't just an immediate reason for this unless I have
mucked up the close font routine. Has anyone else had trouble?



I have been told that the AMOSGuide.guide doesn't include 
instructions on converting the AMOS Pro help file. This is because I
decided to use patch after writting AMOSGuide.guide. Instructions
in archive 3, and in archive1's Readme.Guide

Also, there have been reports of AMOS guide crashing after a lot of
use, and of incorrect links. Please keep letting me know about link
errors, but I'd like to know the page title, and link button text so 
I can trace them easily.


Unfortunately I won't be able to fix things until I go back to london 
at easter. One quick tip for AMOS Guide - If you have the help 
installed on a hard drive, load each guide, and select "TurboCharge" 
from the menu - things will load much faster, as it saves all the
easylife structued variables that descible the guide database into a
file, so the entire .guide file does not need parsing each time it is 
loaded.

Please keep the bug reports comming, and I'd also like to know what
*does* work!

How did you get it to work or what did you do to get it to work ? I 
loaded in the AMOSGuide accessory and executed it and I got a file 
requester asking for an ".Guide" program when I selected a ".Guide" file 
I got a bank not reserved error ? Any idea what's wrong or do I not have 
EasyLife properly installed or  what ?

So Double buffer screens are quite difficult to manage, at least for me.

Depending on what you want to obtain try setting Autoback at the 
beginning of your loop

Autoback 0: This redirect all the drawing commands to the logical screen
I needs you to manually swap the logical and the physical screen to show 
the changes.

Autoback 1: You should use this. This draw things on both the logical and 
the physical screen. It is quite slow but it is very useful in many 
situations.

Autoback 2: Try this, too. This syncronizes the screen update (screen swap) 
with the updating of the bobs.

BTW: TURBO COMMANDS *ALWAYS* DRAW ON THE LOGICAL SCREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was getting mad after 2 hours of programming as the Turbo Extension 
commands always wrote on the logical screen even with autoback 1!!
I had to replace all the turbo commands with standard ones (not a great 
difference thoug, they had to wite very little on the screen).

So be aware....

 Chris Hodges,

About the CHANGE_FONT procedure you posted to the list a week or so ago;

When I use the proc, I find that the monitor no longer works correctly.
The "pointer" jumps around erratically and the "next command" prompt
gives the wrong info.

I just thought I'd better point that out to you and anybody else who's
found that their monitor no longer works.

Well, I'm not sure what you mean. Because of the Amiga's ability to have 
more than one screen open at a time, there really isn't a standard place 
for input and output.

Hi all!

	I'm working on a game that is basically a side view fast action air-
-plane type game. My problem, is that the landscape below you is drawn (ie
it's just a picture...), and your plane is a bob. Any suggestions as to how
to detect collisions between the two?

	Some of my own ideas->

1) One color is devoted entirely to the "sky" so I can check various points in
the background around yoyuur plane to see if they are "non-sky" colors....Thus
denoting a collision.

2) TAnother possibility is to have a special data file of some sorts that would
hold the altitude of any particular point of land... Checking the file against
your planes altitude would be a possibility.

Both of theses methods have unsatisfactory side effects.... So any suggestions or 
improvements would be welcome!

			Thanks!,
					Jeremy

  No, no... he means "standard input" and "standard output" as in any other
language.  When you run a program from a shell window, standard input and
standard output are the shell window.  As for reading/writing them, you'd
have to use DOS function calls.  To write to stdout:

Procedure STDOUT[A$]
    FILE=Doscall(-60) : Rem Get stdout file handle
    If FILE : Rem Only do this if we have a stdout
	Dreg(1)=FILE
	Dreg(2)=Varptr(A$)
	Dreg(3)=Len(A$)
	DUMMY=Doscall(-48)
    End If
End Proc

  Reading from stdin is more complicated:

Procedure STDIN_CHAR
    FILE=Doscall(-54)
    If FILE
	C$=" "
	Dreg(1)=FILE
	Dreg(2)=Varptr(C$)
	Dreg(3)=1
	N=Doscall(-42)
	If N=0 : Rem Check for EOF
	    C$=""
	End If
    Else
	C$=""
    End If
End Proc[C$]

Procedure STDIN_LINE
    FILE=Doscall(-54)
    If FILE
	A$=""
	STDIN_CHAR : C$=Param$
	While C$<>Chr$(13) and Len(C$)>0
	    A$=A$+C$
	    STDIN_CHAR : C$=Param$
	Wend
    Else
	A$=""
    End If
End Proc[A$]

  Disclaimer: these haven't been tested - in fact, I just now came up with
them.

Jeremy,

I like the second idea.  It would be pretty easy to write a program to create
the datafile of altitudes, you'd just do Point()s downwards until you hit a
non sky color.  Then checking for a collision would be fast, just comparing
a Peek() to your plane's Y co-ord.  You could also then have a few different
blues, or whites for clouds in the sky part of the picture.

Well ,it depends!
If you look at STDIN & STDOUT like a console and so a Shell window, i
think you have to get the Easylife extension by Paul Hickman. It includes
some commands to send info (printing a message on the cli window..) or
reading a string from the keyboard (always on a CLI window!).
It's very useful..

Well, yes there are.  And you can't write online games unless you use
stdin/stdout.  Every language on the planet but amos can be easily ported to
bbs games because they use the stdin/stdout routinnes for input/output.  Amos
uses its own and that's why I need to know how to get it to amiga standard
format.

Hey Andy.

The STDOUT proc works fine, and the STDIN_CHAR works too (needs a return to
finish the input but otherwise ok) but STDIN_LINE drops the first character
entered and replaces it with the second character.  For example:

STDIN_LINE
A$=Param$

and "fred" is entered in the CLI, A$ holds not "fred" but "rred".

Do you know how to fix this?

Thanks again, other than that, it is working perfectly, talking between amos
and the cli.

Well met and godspeed,

Okay, two ways:

	1: Open In 1,"*"
	   Open Out 2,"*":rem *** To/From CLI ***

	You'd then use something like Input$(1) to get CLI input and
	Print#2,BLAH$ to place output to the CLI.  I've had problems with
	this method since I've had difficulties with bi-direction CLI
	communication.  Maybe someone can get this method to work.

	2: <This method is a little trickier but not too difficult>

	A$="*"
	Areg(1)=Varptr(A$)
	MYIO=Doscall(LVO("Open"))

	Then you use the contents of MYIO and use the following fragments
	to do IO:

	IN:
	inbuf$=space$(30)
	areg(1)=MYIO
	areg(2)=Varptr(inbuf$)
	dreg(0)=1
	z=Doscall(LVO("Read"))

	OUT:
	outbuf$="Hello world"
	areg(1)=MYIO
	areg(2)=Varptr(outbuf$)
	z=Doscall(LVO("Write"))

	Finally, when you are done, you have to close the file:
	areg(1)=MYIO
	z=Doscall(LVO"Close")
	
This might have left out an important detail but most of it is there.  I 
apologize now for any missing info since this mail caught me away from 
my Amiga System Programmers' Handbook.  I think Dreg(0) must be set to 
an access mode for the file in the Open command.  Oh, yeah it does too.  
I don't know the numbers by heart either... drat.  If you have the RKM 
look up "Interactive".  That's the mode you want.

This: Dreg(0)=Label("IsInteractive") will probably do it.

Since this is a really, frequently asked question I have had enough 
time to give it some thought. I came up with a solution that I have 
never tried, so you 'll risk typing in something totally worthless.

My idea was to use reserved colours for the detectable background, 
then copy the reserved bitplanes of the background behind your plane 
to a second screen, make it a bob and put that bob on the playscreen. 
Now you should be able to do a bob collision test.

Example

char             colour number                status
in                  
ascii
pic

 0                        0           non-mask colour
 .                        4           non-detect background
 /                        1           detectable background
 *                        2           airplane bob

start situation

..........
...***..//
.......///
//..//////
//////////

Now Screen Copy the first bitplane of the rectangle directly around 
your playing bob to a second screen:

00000
00000
00000

Make it a bob and put it back on the play-screen.

..........
...***..//
.......///
//..//////
//////////

It SHOULD be invisible. At this point it does not detect anything.
However, if the plane moves forward it will collide with the 'hill'.

This might not work. There are however a lot of game programmers here, 
so someone should be to help.

Branko,

	I like oyuyour colilision detection idea with creating a bob out of the
"sky", biut\and for most cases I suspect that will work. However, for me I believe

Any ideas?

I don't know what I'd do without you.
Are there any more such strange syntaxis-errors as the sload

I've just started prigramming in Amos.
I can't figiure out how to make amos time something.
For example i will type a sentece and it will tell me how long it took for me
to type it. I have tried the timer command, but it doesn't seem to be working
right. I have to put it in loop for it to time anything, but then I can't input
anything.  I'm using amos 1.36. Can anyone help me please.

Screen copying a plane to a seperate screen (I don't think Screen Copy can
even do just one plane can it?  You'd have to use Get/Put Block), then Get
Bobbing it, then bobbing that BACK onto the play screen would be amazingly
slow.  Though it's on the right track.

What I have done successfully in the past, is after the bobs are cleared,
and all that's on the logical screen is the background, do a Get Bob of a
square just big enough for your ship right around the area the ship will be
bobbed later that frame.  Then after bobbing the ship, re-bob that little
bit of background you grabbed right over top of the ship.  It'll be
invisible, and you just check for a collision to see if the ship hit any
landscape.  It has the added benefit that the ship will appear BEHIND any of
the background it's colliding with.

Though that still wouldn't be as fast as checking a list of altitudes, and
the whole sky would have to be one color (zero).

All you have to do is this:

T=Timer

(Do something that takes time)

Print "Time taken (in 60ths of a second):";Timer-T

Timer just keeps on going up, so if you save it's value at the start, then at
the end the current value of Timer minus it's value at the start is how long it
took.

This is a quick example in AMOSPro, but I think it's the same for AMOS:

T1=Timer
Input "Input something: ";SOMETHING$
T2=Timer
TIME=(T2-T1)/50
Print "It took ";TIME;" seconds to type in: ";SOMETHING$

TIME is assigned the difference between the clock values before and after 
your input, divided by 50 (Timer increments every 50th of a second), for 
the number of seconds elapsed.

TIMER=0

PRINT "You took ";TIMER;" ticks to type that."

Timer can be set to zero, I often use this to check the seed of loops.

  No - IsInteractive is a function that returns whether a file is
interactive (e.g. a Shell window).  The mode, as shown above, is 1005
(AmigaDOS's MODE_OLDFILE).

  If anyone's confused about whether Timer is in 60ths or 50ths of a second,
here's the explanation:  Timer is incremented by one every "vertical blank",
also called a "tick" in AMOS - every time the monitor's electron beam
returns to the blank area at the top of the screen.  On NTSC systems, this
occurs 60 times a second; on PAL systems, it's 50 times a second.  To figure
out which system you're running on and adjust your timing routines
accordingly, use this code:

If Ntsc
    TICKS_PER_SECOND=60
Else
    TICKS_PER_SECOND=50
End If
..
T=Timer
..
SECS=(Timer-T)/TICKS_PER_SECOND

  There is one possible problem that will occur: if the user has an NTSC
system but is using a PAL screen (or has a PAL system and is using an NTSC
screen) then the timing will be thrown off.  There's no way I know of to
detect this.  If you want to force a screen mode so that you know your
timing will be right, use one of these:

Doke $DFF1DC,$20 : Rem Set to PAL mode
Doke $DFF1DC,0 : Rem Set to NTSC mode

  If anyone's confused about whether Timer is in 60ths or 50ths of a second,
here's the explanation:  Timer is incremented by one every "vertical blank",
also called a "tick" in AMOS - every time the monitor's electron beam
returns to the blank area at the top of the screen.  On NTSC systems, this
occurs 60 times a second; on PAL systems, it's 50 times a second.  To figure
out which system you're running on and adjust your timing routines
accordingly, use this code:

If Ntsc
    TICKS_PER_SECOND=60
Else
    TICKS_PER_SECOND=50
End If
..
T=Timer
..
SECS=(Timer-T)/TICKS_PER_SECOND

  There is one possible problem that will occur: if the user has an NTSC
system but is using a PAL screen (or has a PAL system and is using an NTSC
screen) then the timing will be thrown off.  There's no way I know of to
detect this.  If you want to force a screen mode so that you know your
timing will be right, use one of these:

Doke $DFF1DC,$20 : Rem Set to PAL mode
Doke $DFF1DC,0 : Rem Set to NTSC mode

  Note that these will not work on OCS systems, and may produce undesirable
results if a non-NTSC, non-PAL screen mode (e.g. Super72) is in use.

Then try using the intuition extension - easylife is intended to make 
the backbone of programs such as storing all your data  in structured
variables much easier, and leaves the flashy graphics effects to 
someone else. If you can't find a reason to use it - DON'T.

I bought an adapter like that one month ago, but I couldn't get it to work
properly. How did you do? What drivers did you load & how did you configure them?
Does this adapter work with all monitors? When I connect my A1200 to my 14" IMB
SVGA-monitor, I just get a bad, greenish screen, with lines all over it.

Please HELP me! (Im not as desperate as it sounds, though :), I got a 1084S too)

Thank's in advance.

Edin Mujkanovic ( pt94emu@pt.hk-r.se )


----- End Included Message -----

Hello there Edin Mujkanovic. I am sorry that it took some time for me
to write back, but I have had some vacation and therefore have not read
my mail for some time.

I guess the adapter I bought works equally well on all VGA-monitors.
But it is merely a way to connect my amiga to the monitor-cable ( I think
it converts the 23-leg cable to a 15-leg cable).

I have set up my workbench with the resolution Multiscan:Productivity 640*480.
It works great and looks really nice. I Have an Amiga 1200 too.

But however I admit I wrote the article before I received my new monitor -
I just wanted everything to work when I got it. And unfortunately I must also
admit that it only works perfectly with my workbenck and other programs from
which I can choose the screen resolution. 

This means that I have now found myself unable to work with Amos Pro since
it operates in low-resolution. What do you do?

I read the in Preferences in Icontrol - the mode promoter should convert
the low frequencies into high frequencies (i.e. VGA or something).
But this does not seem to work very well - anyway it does not
solve my problem with Amos Pro (I am desperate).

SO I guess we both share this mutual problem or what? 

I suggest that we work on this case together and whatever we find out we
share with eachother - do you agree ? (mate?)

Please write me back and comment this letter - do you have any
suggestions to me how to make me Able to use Amos Pro on my VGA monitor?

See you - The best regards form Dux.


N.B. I also sent this letter to the Amos Mailing list
I thought there might be some wise and expericenced people out
there with the right answers - then please mail me.

Well... try somthing like this, hope that this is what you 
want: (This come directly from my mind)
'

Randomize Timer
Locate 1,1 : Rem Change this... now it's upperleft corner!
Do  
    While K$=""
        K$=Inkey$ : Rem Read the keyboard! 
    Wend
    Text$=Text$+K$
    If K$=Chr$(13) Then Exit
Loop
    T=(Timer/3600)
    Locate 1,3 : Print "Tid :";T
End

If the maths aroud timer is correct, i don't know... but the other 
shoud be ok!

Try it, and tell me, if i'm wrong!

Good Luck!

/Marco.

I don't know whether anyon'es already anwered this one, but I thought I'd 
make an attempt to clarify this matter!
The "adaptor" referred to is, I guess, the C= 23pin->15pin one (or its 
equivalent). This simply converts the Amiga's 23-pin RGB output into a 
15-pin VGA pin-out, with a chip added to "tweak" the signal slightly.
 The adaptor will connect to any monitor that has a VGA plug; that is to 
say, it's non monitor-specific. Whether it'll WORK with the monitor is 
another matter, more of that in a moment..

Up until the release of the ECS and Workbench 2.0, all Amiga screenmodes 
had a horizontal resolution of ~15KHz (vert. resolutions of 50Hz PAL or 
60Hz NTSC). WB2.04 and above offers several screenmodes that have a 
higher horizontal resolution, for example "Productivity" "DBLPal" and so 
on; these modes require AGA (although some work with ECS). 
 Most cheap PC monitors (S/VGA) can't display 15KHz modes, which means 
that although your A1200+adaptor can use these monitors, providing 
Workbench is told to use the new screenmodes, you won't be able to view 
games or the "Early Startup Screens", which use 15KHz modes (Lowres, 
Highres, etc). That's probably the cause of a corrupted display when you 
connect an SVGA monitor to an A1200.. it's attempting (and failing)( to 
handle a 15KHz mode.

Commodore provided the "Mode Promotion" feature to enable people to use 
more software with non-15KHz modes. Basically, when modeP is activated, 
and a program (eg SysInfo) asks the O/S for a 15KHz new screen, the O/S 
opens a screen in one of the new modes. This works well, but *only for OS 
legal software*. Things like AMOSPro or games that use their own 
screen-opening routines ignore modeP altogether. Annoying, huh?

> suggestions to me how to make me Able to use Amos Pro on my VGA monitor?

Unfortunately not. All I can suggest is:
a) keep a TV hooked to the RF port of your A1200 for games, AMOS Pro etc 
   that insist on opening ugly 15KHz screens
b) buy a monitor that can handle 15KHz screenmodes.. these include:
   C=1940, C=1942, C=1950, C=1960, Microvitec 1438, Microvitec 1440,
   and possibly one or two more that I haven't heard about. I use a 1950
   myself and I'm very pleased with it.

I'm sorry if this isn't the ideal solution for you.. blame Francois 
Lionet for not making AMOS more system-friendly :-(

I hope my answers are of help to you. I copied this to the amos-list too, 
because I thought the info above might interest others..

Greetings:

    I have been using an AM1200, video adapter, and a 1942 monitor for about
1 year now, so I thought you might like to hear what I've learned.

  Your correct in saying that all the adapter doe's is allow you to plug a
15 pin IBM type monitor into your Amiga.  It doe's nothing to adjust the
video sync rate.

  An ECS/AGA Amiga can operate at many different video sync rates.  The most
important being NTSC/PAL, DBLNTSC/DBLNTSC, AND MULTISYNC which have
horizontal
sync rates of 15khz, 27khz, and 31khz respectfully.  The higher the
horizontal
sync rate the more rows per screen with less flicker. The default sync rate
for all Amigas is 15khz (why, I do not know) so you need a monitor capable of
syncing to this rate, most IBM multisyncs will not produce this sync rate.
you need a monitor that can produce a horizontal sync rate from 15khz up to
33khz.  The 1942 and 1960 can do this.

  Your biggest problem will be that Amos operates so far out side the Amiga
operating system that no part of 2.0 or 3.0 preferences will have an effect
on 
what video mode Amos operates.  Amos pokes the Amiga chip set to produce the
default video mode (15khz) only.

  If I'm way out on the deep end with this please mail back a specific
question and I'll try to answer it.

Brad G.

Are you sure you can program in a decent way?

Well, if you tryed to make something quite complicated in your program 
you'd find that easylife is very useful. Some commands are also the 
basis in some of my programs. I could have obtained the same results with 
lots of our of work, complicating the code very much and making the size 
of the program a lot bigger.
I.e. MultiZones are VERY useful!

As AMOS is not a OS legal program I think it would require a complete 
rewrite of the code.

For "flashy" graphics effects exist Turbo Extension and JDExtension...

But I think you'll never obtain something good from your programs as you 
don't understand the importance of a powerful extension as EasyLife.
Good coding is a great help in developing good programs... "flashy" 
graphics does not help your programs to become a "best seller" if it is crap!
And usually programs which are based on flashy graphics are crap, IMHO.

   If some fine programmer more advanced than I, were to hack something that I could 
compile along with my AMOSPro source code (A relocatable ML routine I suspect)
to allow the existing screen commands (syntax) to work just as they do on any screen 
that the your special AGA screen open command was used on.  And was bug free.....
Why I'd be willing to pay $20 to have that code sent my way!  I'd bet a few

Hi!

I'm in need of help, so if anyone could please assist I'd really 
appreciate it.  The problem is this: I'm writing a game that plays a med 
module for the introductory sequences, however during the actual game 
(when no music is being played at all) the samples all loop whenever they 
are played. Note that no where in my program is a SAM LOOP ON command issued.

This is a test I did on my computer:
1 - loaded a sample bank
2 - played a sample from the sample bank - the sample did not loop
3 - loaded a med module
4 - played the same sample again, but now it loops.

Note that I didn't even play the med module. I guess the 
medplayer.library is loaded when the module is loaded, so my theory is 
perhaps something in the med library is causing things to go wrong.

So my question is: how do I play my samples without them looping, yet 
still have med modules in my game?

FYI, this is my setup:	A1200 2meg chip
			AmosPro v2
			Amos3D extension
			AmosPro compiler
			
I also have Paul Reece's Enhanced Music Extension, though my problem 
occurs with both EME and the original music extension.

The version of the medplayer.library I'm using is the one from OctaMED v3.

Any help would be *very* welcome,
Thanks in advance,
Stuart.

i'm new to amos, but i just got the Easylife extention.  the archive includes a
 number of accessories, including Amosguide.Amos, which i have been trying to r
un from the editor and as an accessory.


     the problem is that when i try to use the guide the editor reports that th
ere is a syntax error in the Proceedure Lookup Commanf[K$].  when i open this p
roceedure, the cursor is flashing at the line " N= G ". i have no idea why this
 happens..if anyons could shed some light, it would be appreciated.

     i am using AmosPro - version 1.12

                                      thanks,

Hi all.
I know about amosguide's problems. Last week i tried to recompile 
structures with the Structure compiler but Amosguide still works bad.

I heard that this problem is common to a lot of people and so i would
like to know from Paul Hickman what he thinks about this...

I checked all the program but i didn't manage to find errors in source
or so. I think it can be a problem of structure compiler and pointers
to structure.

No problems... I loaded a little guide though.
Maybe with larger guides it has problems.

I think you have to use Amos Pro 2.00 but i can be wrong...
However, i don't know about this problem. The only problem i have is when
i run Amosguide.Amos, but it's about a mysterious 'Bank not Reserved'..

I tried this one and it works fine, but only if you just run the whole thing.
If I try to make it subroutines or procedures, it gurus my machine.  Can you
(Andy) fix up the procs you showed me first?  They were more in line with what
I wanted to do.  Or combine the two to get a final version.

Well met and godspeed,

  This is a known bug - AMOS uses medplayer.library, which allocates the
audio channels, and has the side effect of disabling AMOS's sound channel
interrupt.  So, when you try to play a sample later, AMOS has no way of
knowing when the sound ends, and just loops it over and over.

There is always a way to do this. Currently, I don't have enough
hardware docus about AGA, but I managed to 'open' a 640x512
(overscanned 736x580) interlace screen in 256 AGA colours and AGA
fades using my own copperlist.

The biggest problem is, that AMOS seems to reserve the screen memory
using AllocMem rather using AllocRaster which causes some really bad
effects: In AGA the prefetch modes require 64-bit aligned screen data
AND widths that are a multiple of 64, otherwise the display will be
quite currupted. Using AllocMem the memory blocks may not be 64-bit
aligned.

The following text has been cut out from HowToCode7:

---------------------->cut<------------------------------------------

Fetch Mode Required for Displays

*ALL* ECS and lower screenmodes require only 1x datafetch. All modes
run *FASTER* with at least 2x bandwidth, so try and use 2x bandwitdh

This table only shows the minimum required fetchmode for each screen.

---------------------->cut<------------------------------------------

Fetchmodes of 1 are not a problem whereas 2 and 4 are. (Everyone can
try this out by Doke-ing $3 into $DFF1FC, to restore the value simple
press Amiga-A twice).

One more problem: AGA colours. There are no 256 24-bit colour
registers, but the same 32 OCS 12-bit colour registers for all the
colours. They are accessed by using a special register which switches
between the eight upper-bits and the eight lower-bits colour banks.
Very complicated and hardly any chance to get it into AMOS Screens.

It would be the end. Escom produce PCs, that look nice from outside
and are very cheap (perhaps the cheapest) and they don't last for
more than a few months. These PCs were made for the stupid people,
who have never seen a computer in there life (and in fact, they will
never see a *real* computer ;-) ), buy this crap and then you have no
support or anything.

Escom is my personal nightmare. If they get the licence to produce
Amigas, it *will* be IMHO the end of this great computer. :-(

I had some ugly problems with LZX 1.00. The directory handling was
really stupid and there have been some real problems with very big
archives. Always test your files in the archive before sending!

But now there should be a new version of LZX 1.01 on AmiNet... try

Try out these procedures I've coded for you ;-)

Some words of warning: I could only test them on AMOS Pro 2.0 and
they work as long as you don't break the program when the stdout has
been assigned. If you do, you must Loke Areg(5)+$8BC+(CHAN-1)*10,0 by
hand in the direct mode, otherwise AMOS will close the handle and
will crash the computer when AMOS is quitted!

Eh? I testet it with some more lines after the program and it worked
correctly (despite my monitor has never worked correctly et al).
There COULD be some structural errors if the font is not found but I
programmed it so to avoid this. Do not call this procedure if there
is no current open screen.

Could you please send me the part of the program which makes the
trouble?

There are several occassions when the pointer jumps around like mad.
Have you tested it without my routine?

Thx for the information. I'll try to fix the error, if I can find

I think Input# and Line Input have such an syntax error, too. And

What about this one:

VF=50-Ntsc*10
OLDTIME=Timer
' Jump to your keyboard input routine...
TIME=Timer-OLDTIME
Print "You took"+Str$(TIME/VF)+" secs and"+Str$(TIME Mod VF)+" ticks
to type this in."

The VF variable is used to get the correct timing both on PAL and
NTSC machines ;)

A good way to get around this problem is to use MODs (NOISEtracker, whatever)
instead. True, they don't have all the little options MEDs have, but you get
music without looping (or, in my case the system crashes) when using samples.

   Greetings, I have been receiving this list no directly for the last few
months and I finally managed to attain access. I have been using AMOS for the
last year or so and have succeeded in creating a D&D adventure game called
BloodQuest. It is in the Eye of Beholder style (except objects do not
appear visible in the action screen so you can't pick them up with the
mouse.) with the 3 dimensional perspective. It is done in 64 color halfbright
mode and contains a great deal more detail than any of the Beholder releases.
Characters can be created from one of over 18 classes and 9 races and new
race - class combinations can easily be added. The entire program is modular
and so the adventure can increase in size as much as is needed. Monsters,
maps, encounters, are all dynamic objects that will change as the adventure
progresses.
  I am entering the Amiga Format contest with my game and so a full working
program should appear soon. As it is modular, I will be releasing only the
first adventure with the program. People who register with me will receive
later adventures(as they are created) at a minimal cost. 
  Other than that, I look forward to chatting with you all.

Hi all.
I know about amosguide's problems. Last week i tried to recompile 
structures with the Structure compiler but Amosguide still works bad.

I heard that this problem is common to a lot of people and so i would
like to know from Paul Hickman what he thinks about this...

I checked all the program but i didn't manage to find errors in source
or so. I think it can be a problem of structure compiler and pointers
to structure.

A good way to get around this problem is to use MODs (NOISEtracker, whatever)
instead. True, they don't have all the little options MEDs have, but you get
music without looping (or, in my case the system crashes) when using samples.

Ok.  I did make MYIO global, but maybe I need to do it for another.  I'll check

Attention Manuel Andre:

    Now that Andy Church has finished Intuition 3.0,
and we can open and use a AGA screen:

  Iscreen Open 1,640,400,256,Hires,"Hello",$91000.

and we can locate the screen in the Amigas memory with
Iscreen Base.  Would it be possible to enhance the Turbo 
Plus extension adding a screen location option to each 
command allowing the command to work on any screen within 
the Amigas memory?

This would give Amos the long wanted AGA compatibility.

Your if-then-else takes longer to execute! (miniscule difference, but 
noticeable if you take out the input and repeat it about 10000 times).  
*laugh*

Actually I just forgot about timer=0.  I think the point got across 
anyway.  Besides, all you really need is the example below:
(I was also instinctively trying to write something that could be very 
easily customized to suit anyones needs... damn comp-sci training ;)

Timer=0
Input "Input something: ";SOMETHING$
Print "It took ";Timer/50;" seconds to type in: ";SOMETHING$

  It would be simpler than that.  (Extension programmers take note!)  Since
v1.2b of the extension, there have been a few routines included in the
extension for use by other extensions - for example, there's a routine to
get the address of an Intuition screen given its number, or to get the
address of the current screen.  So any extension that takes advantage of
these can work transparently with Intuition.

  Oops... now that I think of it, I've been forgetting to include the
appropriate files in the archives.  Anyone interested, please mail me.

Ok, new question. (Thanks, by the way, to all who contributed to the
STDIN/STDOUT question.)

How do you read a string passed with a cli?

eg: 6> AMOSPRG fred

How would I get the amos program (which is compiled and runs from the cli) to
get the string fred?

I'm sure it's just a matter of reg() and stuff, but I need to know where/how.

Well met and godspeed,

  Use the reserved variable "Command Line$".

I am uploading an AMOSPro Application that I wrote up last night that will
give you a listing of all current message (Arexx) ports and their pointers.
It does require that you have Arexx (v1.15) installed and the CLI command
'Rx' in your C: directory.

Check it out and let me know what you think ?

Luckily, this is very easy. Just use the "=Command Line$" function to
get the parameter... read out the string as soon as possible because
it is stored in the graphics buffer (?)...

You could of course use a lot of ParseArgs() to get the same or even
better results... :-)

  Brad g.,

  I have limited net-surf capability, and I only recently 
  subscribed.  I have little idea of what Intuition 3.0 is,
  or Turbo Plus extension is or what it can do.  I have 
  subscribed to this newsgroup since it relates to programming,
  engineering software on the best in its class system.

  It sounds like that you have been doing a lot of thinking 
  about a possible solution to the AGA non-support.  Your idea 
  sounds like a two source hack, or am I mistaken?  If so
  think hard about a one source solution.  Remember $20 awaits!

                                 Clayton   

  AMOS List,

  Is there any news anywhere on AMOS works from the author.
  
  Any news about IBMOS? ==:+O

  With the past history of IBM products, You may be able to buy a 
  SVGA16-bitsoundblasted100megahertzpentiumCDwarpedgigahardfaxmodem
  clone for $500 (without the monitor) by Christmas next year or so.
  I suspect that the IBMOS might NEED all of that stuff just to work
  up to AMIGA standards..... and IBMOS just might be finished 
  (debugged and stable) by then!  ;)

Okay, this one is very straightforward:

	To get a command line:

	AMOSThing Blah

	A simple A$=Command Line$ will get the command line into A$

This might only work with the compiler extension for 1.3 and AMOS Pro but 
don't quote me on that one.

Hi,
 
  I've got a few questions to ask, so I decided to group them all together...
 
                           -=================-
 
Are there any printable docs files for the Easylife extension? .Guide files are
all very nice, but you can only print one 'page' at a time, and being a
technophobe, I'd much rather have it on paper. (You can look at the
instructions at the same time as the offending code).
 
BTW: Easylife is definitely one of the most useful extensions around, but I
can't seem to find the command "El Kitchen Sink" anywhere ...
 
                           -=================-
 
Music and AmosPro: I'd like to be able to have music and samples at the same
time. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be possible with Mods, and Meds, so
how can it be done? (And please don't suggest the Amos Music format, I've tried
that and the "converter" that I had to convert from Mod to Amos format
butchered the tunes horribly.)
 
                           -=================-
 
This isn't much of a problem but a "WHY?" instead.
 
a = (320-Gr Length( title$ ))/2
 
doesn't work, while
 
tl = Gr Length( title$ )
a = (320-tl)/2
 
does. I haven't got a real problem with the way that Amos does this (I know
about it after all). I'd just like to know why it does it. What strange methods
does AmosPro use to pass variables around? Why does it pass them around in this
way?
 
                           -=================-
 
Is there anyway to force AmosPro to NOT perform it's string tidying functions?
Even for only a limited amount of time, this would be very useful.
 
                           -=================-
 
Is the only difference between AmosPro compiled code for WB and for CLI that
one is auto detaching?
 
                           -=================-
 
Thanks in advance.
 
      Nick
 
-==========================================================================-
For those of you who are interested, "Eternity" is in a "stable" test version,
with over 300 technology types and (currently) 3 races. Unfortunately I've had
to put it on hold for a bit, due to my final year project and other
commitments, but it will be released soon(ish).

Well, I'm sorry to say I'm removing myself from the AMOS mailing list (at 
least temporarily).  Everyone on here has been very helpful and friendly, 
but my schedule has gotten quite busy, and I haven't been able to use 
AMOS in quite a long time (in fact, I even deleted the pakage from my 
HD) and I haven't had time to read my mail frequently enough without 
there being 20+ messages ;o).  Hopefully I'll find time to get back to 
AMOS coding in the future and resubscribe to the list.

A big thank you to everyone who's on the list, it's been fun!

Subject: Wanted: raw2iff sample converter
Content-Length: 393
Status: RO
X-Status: 


Can anyone supply me with some code (or a whole program) to convert raw sample
data to IFF format....

basically I want to be able to do something like:

raw2iff df0: df1:

to convert all files on df0: into IFF files on df1:

or 

raw2iff df0:

to convert all files on df0: back to df0: one by one

If cli-version not possible, then just a program run from AMOS would suffice...

Thanks,
JOE

I've never bothered to enough paper to try to print them! There are 
guide to plain text converters available on aminet somewhere in the 
text sub-directory.

See chapter 8, "Life, the Universe & Everything commands".
P.s. There is no space between "El" and "Kitchen".

Buy two amigas. (Or try Paul Reeces EME extension)

Erm, isn't "Gr Length" supposed to be "Text Length"? If so, this is a 
known bug with that particular command.

Don't use any strings! (it is the only way). Easylife structured 
variables are safe from the garbage collector though.

The WB version includes code to reply to the WB Message that 
workbench sends to all programs it starts.

On the subject of raw to IFF sample conversion, load them into a 
recent version of octamed (3.00+ I think), then select Save samples 
as IFF from the sample editor, and save them again. However, the
only difference between raw & IFF is the IFF version has a 72 byte
header containing the looping positions & the usual IFF FORM & 8SVX
stuff to identify it as an IFF sample.

Last week I accidentally filtered my AMOS List e-mail into a 
non-existent folder, hence I haven't received any messages since good
friday. The "Bits and Pieces" message is  the first I received 
since, so if anyone has discovered any more huge bugs in Easylife,
please let me know (again). Mail sent directly to me was not 
affected.

Did anyone notice that the last version of Easylife didn't give any
error messages, just empty lines like "  on line 53"? I put a macro
call to include the error messages in the first character of  a line,
so devpac took it to be a label.

A patched version, together with improved versions of AmosGuide &
VarChecker will appear on aminet soon (I have mailed it so someone
to upload for me, as I have no FTP from work.

Hi all,
      I have finally managed to get round to writing my four way
scrolling routine.  The screen is only the size of the physical
screen left and right, while up and down consists of a scrolling
logical map, using the method of pasting blocks infront and
behind giving a copy of the screen to jump back to when the 

--lbX85rsrV1TuyvxT2UHurSYER8zt8ogV
Content-type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"







         physical screen runs out.
         
         At the moment I use screen copy to paste the blocks from my block 
         screen to my display screen.  This is proving too slow :-(  
         causing my bob to flicker.  Is there a way of doing this faster?
         What should I be using Double buffering & screen swaps - would 
         that mean that I would need to copy my once to the hidden screen 
         the swap and do it again?
         
         
         Thanx in advance

Hello everybody!

I'm programming a two-player hired guns-style game and have a problem...
It seems that X Mouse etc. functions doesn't recognize port 2, only port 
1... At the moment I'm forced to program my own mouse routines unless of 
course there's an extension somewhere with better mouse support commands...
If anyone of you know such extension, please, please tell me! Or maybe 
know a easy way to program second mouse on amos.... I'm not experienced 
in extension programming, but know something about assembler and amiga's 
hardware... 

Anyone?

Hi all,
      I have finally managed to get round to writing my four way
scrolling routine.  The screen is only the size of the physical
screen left and right, while up and down consists of a scrolling
logical map, using the method of pasting blocks infront and
behind giving a copy of the screen to jump back to when the 

--KoyRqYH6YEebbqkQnDsB2TznSdAuFxBW
Content-type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"







         physical screen runs out.
         
         At the moment I use screen copy to paste the blocks from my block 
         screen to my display screen.  This is proving too slow :-(  
         causing my bob to flicker.  Is there a way of doing this faster?
         What should I be using Double buffering & screen swaps - would 
         that mean that I would need to copy my once to the hidden screen 
         the swap and do it again?
         
         
         Thanx in advance
         
         Pete.

If anyone's interested, I wrote a progette to convert raw toIFF and back
again (if necessary). I'm not sure if it complies with the 8SVX IFF
standard, but I got it to work with most every audio s/w I could find.

I did it for a friend who was buil,ding a car alarm which used speech, but
he only had access to an IFF saving sampler.

If anyone wants it, send email to;

mailserver@ultim.demon.co.uk

leave the subject line blank, and in the body of th message, type the
line;

GET amos/raw2iff2raw.lha

That should send the file (in amos source) to you, UUencoded.

I would like to say that i used this method in my last version of Pattern
Generator to center messages in the message box,buttons and so...
It works very fine on my Amiga!
Note that i used the first way and not the second...

EX. To center "File doesn't exist!" i wrote:

    Text 100+(400-Text Length("File doesn't exist!"))/2,y,"File doesn't exist!"

    It means: 
    
    - message box width=400

    - start coords for message box are 100,y
    - print text starting from 100+(message box width-text length(MESSAGE$))/2

erm... wouldn't that be something complicated as:

FH=30
Screen Open 0,320,200+FH,2,Lowres
Screen Display 0,128,50,320,200
Get Fonts
Set Font "BigBoldOne",FH
TB=Text Base
NAME$=Fsel$("","","Please load the script")
Open In 1,NAME$
Repeat 
  Line Input #1, _LINE$
  TT=Val(Left$(_LINE$,3))
  _LINE$=Right$(_LINE$,Len(LINE$-4))
  Text 0,200+TB,_LINE$
  Scroll Up
  'There is no such thing as a Scroll Up command, so look up
  'the real scroll command in a manual.
  Wait TT
Until eof(1)

And your scriptfile would be something like:
002:Pete, straighten your tie!
001:
002:And on the air in:
002:5
002:4
002:3
002:2
002:1
002:Goodday, this is Peter Presenter live
002:on KKWZPM with yesterday's news.

If you do not like my prog, I remember that there several scrollers on 
the Fish disks. Good luck!

Ok, thank you for the information, and no I don't use the creator anymore...
Hmm, maybe now when the Stick extension is freeware the source code is
available?  Maybe if I'd had a look into the source, I might be able to
convert it to Amos Pro .... it shouldn't be hard according to the
extension.doc at least. Do you know where I can get the extension?
It isn't on the aminet as far as I know...

Thanks

Even if you can't find one, it's fairly simple to write your own such 
program.. if it's only for reporters to read (rather than actual 
production) then you don't need fancy fades/wipes/fonts etc.

Cool.. let's face it, you could use a standard A500 for this sort of 
thing, and probably get better results than with a PC :-)

Extensions are not AMOS programs.. they are seperate programs (usually 
written in MC68K) that "plug in" to the main AMOS interpreter/compiler 
program.
 I can't give you more technical information than that, simply because I 
don't know :-) 

Anyway, if you want a video titler, the following is on Aminet:

CreditsTitler.lha  gfx/show    30K 88+"video titler" to make scroll. credits
jcosub22.lzh       gfx/show   231K  3+Professional timed script video titling
TelePrompt.lha     gfx/show    31K  40+TelePrompter (Autocue) demo

Isn't GREP great? ;-) Hopefully one of the above will solve your problem..

 David Hollway.

Hello all,
   I don't know if there's anyone out there using my "Amtuition" AMOS 
fake-intuition library, but in the course of fiddling about with AMOS 
yesterday I improved the system in a couple of small ways.. if you want 
the update it's free (although the original was Licenseware). Mail me and 
I'll send you a uu-encoded copy of the update, which I think is no more 
than 2K in size.
 One of the main improvements is that the MOVEWINDOW[] procedure now takes 
an additional parameter 'S' that enables full-window dragging (as seen on 
Windoze-NT, X11R6, the Amiga "Picdrag" program for the Picasso-II etc). 
 I guess virutally all would-be Intuition programmers on this list are 
now using the "proper" Intuition extension, but if there are any 
AMtuition users out there, feel free to mail me.

-David Hollway.

Try this program! :-)

Still in beta state and only some hours old ;-)

It supports the conversion of either single files or whole directories
including pattern matching... The replay frequency is currently fixed
to 15365 Hz....

However, it does not support recursive directories yet.

Enjoy...

I'm not sure if AMOS is your best bet, but you could try:-

I saw mention on this list of that hack in Windoze-NT wher you can pick 
up a window, and drag the *whole thing around, not just an outline of the 
border.
 
To try this you better have AT LEAST an accelerated graphics card, some
sort of loca-bus, a Level 2 cache (on top of the normal one), and FAST HD,
and at least a 90 MHz Pentium!  Even then, the HD occasionally goes into
coniptions (Windoze writes everything to the HD for no damn good reason,
bitmap clips included). 
 
Plus, the background redraws can even then be flaky and delayed.  And 
don't count on "multitasking", not that NT really does it right.  So much 
processor time is consumed by this hack, not many cycles are available 
for anything else!  If you're online, you can expect to get serial errors 
(data loss) unless you add a card with a 16 byte FIFO UART, and keep the 
baud rate at 9600 or lower.
 
WHY THE AMIGA CAN DO IT BETTER:
 
I don't do newsgroups, so maybe one of you can repost this proposal.  What
the Amiga does through elegant hardware design, the clones and Macs must
do by dedicating all available processor time to the task...Like the
Amiga-full-screen-dragging.  I'll admit the OS routines for this are
written in Finkel-Fecal-C, but even then it's reasonably fast, due to the
good hardware.  You need a 90 MHz Pentium to even THINK about real-time 
full window dragging. 

 Unfortunately there's no Amiga OS patch to do this visually appealing 
window-move.  This is sad, because a 7.159MHz Amiga 1000 for 1985 could 
do it better than a Pentium clone (due to Ami's versatile hardware).
 
I understand the hardware, but my programming skills on the Amiga are 
weak.  Here's how an Amigan could simply create a WorkBench patch to 
create real-time-full-window-dragging.  Maybe one of the better 68K 
programmers could churn this out by next week.
 
1. When the user grabs a window to drag, a playfield of same dimension of 
the window should be opened.  OCE/ECS or AGA should be checked to 
establish plane/playfield limits...ie: on an OCS system, an 8 color WB 
screen can only open up a 1 plane playfield.  If you can't open enough 
planes for the playfield to represent all the colors in the original 
window, just open up as many planes as hardware will allow, and blit the 
most signigicant color (text usually) into the playfield...you get the 
idea...
 
2. Once you've got the plafield looking like the window, bring the 
playfield to front, at the same location as the Window.  restore the 
contents under the window (use the OS routine for this).  The system 
thinks you've got ahold of the window...as you drag the mouse, have your 
patch apply the XY coords used by the OS window-drag routine, to the 
playfield.  The playfield moves in realtime...in effect, a HARDWARE WINDOW.
 
3. When the user lets go of the mousebutton, use the OS routine that 
places the window to it's new XY position.  Then close/deallocate the  
playfield.
 
Notes: On an OCS system, a 4 color WB, and a 4 color playfield on top,
could start to be tad sluggish, if you have a HUGE window.  It'd be like
having a 16 color screen up.  BUT IT STILL EATS LESS CYCLES AND BANDWIDTH
THAN USING THE BLITTER and/or 680X0 to do realtime movement.   Typical 
sized windows, even on an overscanned 720x480  2.1 WB (as inefficient as 
2.0 and above are) should move pretty fluidly even on a 7MHz Amiga.
 
If you have a 16 color OCS HiRes WB, or a 4 color ECS SuperHiRes WB, or a 
256 color AGA SuperHires WB, you won't be able to open up a playfield of 
any depth, so any patch should check for this condition.
 
I'm not familiar enough with AGA hardware :-( to know if a 256 color AGA 
HiRes WB would allow for another playfield.  Since this mode only uses 
half of the available video bandwidth (as compared to SuperHires) I would 
suspect that it could allow you to open an 8 plane playfield.  But I'm 
not going to make that assumption.  I have no idea about the other 
goofier modes like 800x600, etc.
 
It's up to you if you want to turn off the OS's 
dragging-outline-of-the-window routine.  The user can't see it (the 
playfield is on top) anyway, and shutting it off will free up quite a few 
cycles!
 
Overacheivers can try to defeat the OS's refusal to write to WB when a 
window is being moved.  This means that WHILE a window is being moved, it 
can have updates occuring in it (like a dir listing or an audio-meter, 
etc), since it's not really on the WB anymore.  Just make sure the 
videomode you're in allows for enough playfield planes to accurately 
reflect all the colors in the original window.  And make sure you tell 
the OS where the new window's (playfield really) memory address is!
If you do this, it also means other bitmaps updates can occur on the WB 
WHILE you're moving your "hardware window".  This would REALLY make the 
Amiga multitasking look appealing, even to ignorant clone owners.
 
In fact, whoever writes the best version of this, ought to offer it to
whoever takes over the Amiga OS, as a part of the forthcoming OS upgrades. 
Sorta like how ARP was offered to CBM, but nipplehead Andy Finkel turned

Hello everybody,

I was wondering about which of these three routines 
that are faster:

1)
	...
	MK=Mouse Key
	MC=Mouse Click
	If MC<>0
	  If MC=2
	    If MK=3
	      ...
	    Else
	      ...
	    End If
	  Else
	    If MK=3
	      ...
	    Else
	      ...
	    End If
	Else
	  If MK=1
	    ...
	  Else
	    ...
	  End If
	End If
	...


2)
	...
	MK=Mouse Key
	MC=Mouse Click
	If MC=2 and MK=3 then ...
	If MC=2 and MK<>3 then ...
	If MC=1 and MK=3 then ...
	If MC=1 and MK<>3 then ...
	...


3)
	...
	MICE=Mouse Click
	Rol.b 2,MICE
	Add MICE,Mouse Key
	On MICE Proc ZIP,ZIP,ZIP,ZIP,MICE_5,ZIP,MICE_7,...
	...

All three has both good and bad sides,but
which one is faster?

I've heard that procedures should be avoided to make
routines faster.Is it true always or is it true only on
events like when a procedure is returning or receiving an
argument?

  3 is fastest, then 1, then 2.

  Well, then you've heard completely wrong.  Procedures should *never* be
avoided; in fact, they should be utilized as much as possible to make your
code more readable and modular.  It's true that not using procedures
increases the speed of your code by a *very* small amount, but if you have
something that's so speed-critical that you'd want to avoid even that
overhead, you should be doing it in assembler anyway.

In fact I have two patches that do this. An old one, TurboLayers 1.2, and a
more recent one available on AmiNet:

Opaque1.1.lha        gfx/board   26K*Bug fix for opaque window commodity

I have no idea of how the authors have implemented this, but they work. The
latter is designed to run on graphics cards, but supports ECS and AGA.

TurboLayers works on pre-2.0 releases of AmigaDOS and the OCS chipset, I
haven't tested it on later releases and AGA. OpaqueMove requires an MC68030
and AmigaDOS 3.0.

Should anyone want a copy of TurboLayers then E-Mail me and I'll uuencode
it and send it off by E-Mail. Be aware that after April 25. I most probably
won't be available on this address anymore.

The only thing I like about MacLipboard is the Command-/ cut-n-paste 
shortcut, which is the same as Amiga-C then Amiga-V.  What do you like 
about it?  Maybe I'm missing something?

2.0 and above "throws away" about 10,000 instructions per second, due to 
introduced features and inefficiencies.  At least those are the results I 
got when checking it on a 7.159MHz Amiga.  It will be just as inefficient 
on later Amigas, but won't be as noticable.
 
The Show-By-Name is excruciatingly slow.  The ARP SORT routine would 
infinitely improve it.  Even the AmigaOS Sort command might be faster 
than the WB version.
 
Also, Show-All/By-Name eats TONS of ChipMem!  For no damn reason.  
 
And the machine can miss events when a disk is inserted (like menu 
selection).

 
As of 2.0 and beyond, there's too much C crap.  Finkel is twit.  In 
preparation for 2.0, Andy Finkel wrote an Assem Parallel/Printer driver 
and support routines.  It was huge, fat, slow and bloated just like Andy.
 
Then he wrote it in C (letting the compiler do the real work), and 
announced that C can be faster/smaller than Assem.  The truth is, that 
Finkel is a shitty Assem programmer (a compiled AmigaBasic program would 
be better than any Assem he could write).  He had no place on the Amiga
OS team!

Hello all,
  I've been swamped over the last few days with requests for my AMtuition 
update.. perhaps it was my use of the word "FREE" in the offer that 
caused all this interest :-)
 I think people may have misunderstood my meaning slightly though. I used 
words to the effect of:
"..this update is free, though the original was licenseware"
..which people have taken to mean (I suspect) that the whole product is 
now available free. That's not quite what I meant.. the update is only a 
part of the Amtuition system, rather than the whole thing. 
 For those on the list who may not remember my incessant mentions of 
Amtuition a few months ago :-) it might be worth just clarifying what 
AMtuition is and isn't:
1) it doesn't allow you to open proper public/custom Intuition screens,
   nor does it support the AGA chipset (at least, no more than AMOS 
   itself does as standard). If you want this, you'd be better to go for the
   "proper" Intuition extension (I can't remember who wrote this though..
   Andy Church perhaps?)
2) AMtuition is just a library of procedures that make your AMOS programs
   look and feel like they're running under Intuition, with features like:
    -draggable windows (full-window dragging in the latest update)
    -bevel boxes
    -listview boxes
    -cycle gadgets
    -very comprehensive file, font and palette requesters that do all the
     work for you (similar in look and concept to reqtools.library)
   and more.

If you thought it was more than this, I'm sorry; perhaps I should have 
made my meaning clearer. It's still a very impressive product though (in 
my unbiased opinion :-) ) and makes it very easy to give your programs 
proper kickstart 3.0 or 2.x -alike interfaces.
 If you want to see it in action, take a look at /dev/amos/amtudemo.lha
on Aminet. The full package contains extensive documentation and lots of 
example code.
 Although it's licenseware, and so theoretically you've got to pay 
UKP3.50 or equivalent to get a copy, I can let anyone who's interested in 
it have a special version of AMtuition; send me e-mail at 
dmh11@tower.york.ac.uk if you want this.

Regards,

 David Hollway.

Haven't the foggiest, but they will all be so fast that it will make 
little difference - go for the 1st or 2nd one in preference to the 
third, as it will probably be slower.

Procedures are slower, but it is only worth avoiding them if you 
really need the speed increase. In normal programing where speed is 
not of the essence, use them. I usually use goto when using On Error 
inside a procedure, and hardly ever use gosub. 

The loss of local variables just doesn't make Gosub worthwhile, and 
it is less strict with syntax checking (You can do horrible things 
like jump into the middle of a loop). Some people will jump down my 
throat screamming "How dare you not use the fastest hackiest solution 
available - call yourself an amiga programmer?", but all I can say is 
if speed of execution is that important to you, buy an accelerator, 
or learn C++.

David,

The reason View By Name is so slow is that every single file is converted to an
Icon (and thus stored in Chip Ram) before they're displayed.  This was the easy
way to allowing the user to select and drag view-by-name files just like regular
icons.  (Read "quick hack")

This info is from one of the former C= devs residing on bix, Mike Sinz I
believe, but it was a while back that I read it.

You're not 'listening' :-). What Tim says is not that the Mac clipboard 
is better, but that it is better supported. I know Mac programmes that 
even use the Paste command instead of an Import command (Swivel). On my 
Amy OTOH I usually forget to copy anything the clipboard needs (libs, 
assigns) when I make a stand-alone disk. Yesterday I started learning C. 
I ran it from a standalone disk and the first time I cut something from 
the source from my testprogramme I could not paste it back because I had 
forgotten to install the clipboards. I would not have forgotten this if 
EVERY Amiga programme (read: as on the Mac) would use the clipboards. For 
those who do not know the Mac: programmes must contain an edit menu with 
cut, copy and paste command (I guess this is according to Mac guidelines. 
I do not know this for sure, because I only once tried to program on a 
Mac and the computer crashed on my 'Hello World' prgramme :-) ).

Hi to everyone!

I readed a mail from Amos-mailing list, that there is a kind of batch 
for Amos-Pro, so you can use more colours or something like that!

I've also picked up an amos progg from AmiNet that uses these batch, 
but I don't know what name it has or where I could get it! 

Now I have got a program that uses these batch, and I can't use it!

So please send it to me, or tell me where I could get it! :-))

Subject: Displaying bobs with Plot
Status: O
X-Status: 


Hello again everbody,

Thanks to all who has replied to my speed problem
with If and On Proc.I have a different problem now:

When I combine bob updating with Plot command,
the bobs leaves a trace behind themselves while
they are moving.Here is the approximate code:

	Flash Off:Cursor Off:Autoback 0:Double Buffer
	Priority On:Bob Update Off
	
	...
	'Here loading some bob images
	...
	Make Mask
	...


	'Here comes the main loop
	Do
	  Bob Clear
	  ...
	  Plot x+50,y+50,colour
	  Bob 1,x,y,image
	  Bob Draw
	  Screen Swap
	  Wait Vbl
	Loop

Now I know that I have to plot same Plot point
twice because of Double Buffer.And you can assume
that it is being taking care of in the code above.

The real problem is that the Bob Clear command doesn't
seems to work when Plot command is present.All the bobs
on screen is left where they are and they seem to stuck
to their position like if they where glued.This problem
is appearing only if the line with the Plot command is there.

I actually did come around this by putting Bob Clear right
before Bob Draw but I really would like to know why this
code isn't working.And I'm not sure if my solution is good
enough.

Tolga

The original poster made a joke (maybe a sarcastic reference to a serious 
help query before?), hence the smiley. Only no-one answered, so he did it 
himself. Meantime, I wonder what the 'intelligence'-services of the world 
think of all these zeroes and ones flying across the Internet.

they are licenceware.  A demo version is available though if you're

My friend at college has just E-Mailed me to tell me that he has now 
uploaded the Easylife patch to aminet, so it should become available 
soon. 

It fixes some bugs (like lack of error messages in the extension), 
and improves AmosGuide & Varchecker (Which now has a help button in
each requester which Prun's AmosGuide to explain what each error message 
means).

I'm not sure what the filename will be because I sent it with an IBM 
8.3 character name, and told my friend to rename it, but look for 
something to do with easylife in /dev/amos.

I think somehing like this would work.

Screen Open 0,320,256,16,Lowres ( or whatever )
Double Buffer
Bob Update Off

Do

For t=1 to number of bobs
Bob t,x,y,t
next t                     (ie place all your BOBS)

Bob Draw
Wait Vbl
Screen Swap

Loop

------

The Bob t,x,y,t command will fix the place of the bob, but not
display it. That will only happen when the bob draw command is
called, and as it displays on the logical screen there should
be no flicker, especially when combined with Screen Swap.

However, I have no access to my Amiga at the minute, so I
am not 100% sure that the above will be flicker free.
Don`t worry about Bob Clear.

And now, a problem of my own:

In the Amos Pro manual it says that a command like
Randomize 8
will set the random number generator to produce the
same sets of numbers every time. Yet, it does not on my
A1200. Why? (although I think I know - it`s another
Amos `feature` no doubt)

It`s not the Randomise command at fault, it`s
the Rnd command.

You have to call the Rnd function with a negative
number in order to get repeatable random sequences.

e.g.

For A=1 to 10
   Randomise 42
   For B=1 to 10
      Print Rnd(100)
   Next B
Next A

will give 10 sets of totally random numbers, whereas

For A=1 to 10
   Randomise 42
   For B=1 to 10
      Print Rnd(-100)
   Next B
Next A

will give 10 sets of identical random numbers.
Note that using a -ve number still results in
positive random numbers being generated.

Hi All.

I'm very happy because i can announce to you a new Amos Web Site.
After a lot of months, finally the web is finished and updated every 2-3 days.

My web doesn't want to compete with others (PLAYFIELD!, Andy Church's..).

I made it only because i love Amiga and i like programming with Amos.
This web is placed on the WWW server of the Department of Computers Science in
Turin, ITALY. It is a sub-document of my WWW page, linked with the Amiga Development
Project (ADP), also placed on the same WWW server.
ADP is a WWW page with a lot of links to people interested in Amiga programming, music,
graphic and hardware.
Actually, ADP is administrated by Marco Musso.
Actually ADP is linked to :  

 - Marco Musso (Administrator, programmer, student..)
 - Alex Garoli (author of Artic, a very good packer device. Demo version on Aminet
   in directory util/pack)

 - Diego Cortassa & Enrico Canardi (Brain Machine's developers)
 - Luca Ferraris (me)
 - Francesco Dipietromaria

 - Roberto Attias (IPISA organizator)
 - Sebastiano Vigna (author of SuperDuper copier,Mostra..)


The AMOS Web site's address is:i

 http://www.di.unito.it/pub/WWW/www_student/amiga/LucaFerraris/amosweb.html

 The ADP address is:

 http://www.di.unito.it/pub/WWW/www_student/amiga/

 Bye Bye...

Hi,

I am experiencing problems compiling a (big) program.
I am using AmosPro 2.0 (all three updates) and the Procompiler.
The 'long jump' option is used.
I have an A500, 1chip and 2fast. Kick1.3 and 2.0

The program I compile makes no use of any extensions other than
those supplied with apro. The program can be run using amos1.3 too.
No special pro-commands are used. The program uses no special
graphical commands (expect dual playfield and screen offset).
The program needs more than 400kb of 'set buffer' to work properly.
And that brings me to the problem, the prog works fine when run in
amos. The 1.3compiler compiles it and when started (any of amos/cli/wb)
the prg starts and gives a 'software failure' for no clear reason
I tried putting lots of 'wait key' in the program to find what goes
wrong but this shows the prg supposedly crashes at things like
'text x,y,'ok'' or such lines.
The procompiler works better but still crashes after keypresses.
It ALWAYS crashes. And it doesn't seem to matter what happens.
Compiling other programs works fine and big programs like the
'TOMEmap editor' (280k) compile ok (under 1.3 of course). Compiling
on other computers (A2000 1chip, 2fast, 25mhz '30 '882 4Mb) the
result is (of course ?) the same: software failure.

Can you give me information on things I should DEFENITLY look at
when compiling ?
Like settings of variabeles (intitializing them and so on)
I had the 'varchecker' from the easylife distribution go over the
program and it did find some 20 'undeclared' vars in some
260K of program code.
The prog contains very, very many string-operations.
Can these be at fault ?

If you have any experience in compilings that go wrong, post them
please as I am sure a good compilation of 'amos-errors'
(exuse me: 'amos-features' :-| ) would be to everone's benefit.
If you already have such a 'list' : please post it ?

Hi, my name is Steve (aka Gizmo),
I have been using Amos for 2 years and have not managed to
finish any program I've been writing.  I would like to be added
to the Amos list as I can offer some help to like minded
people, mainly in the non-games making side of things.  

I would also like to know if anybody has written a replacement
file requester routine yet.  I attempted a few months ago but
it was go slow and boring I gave up.  The reason I ask is because
I am at present putting the finishing touches to a football
statistic and prediction program and the Amos requesters don't
blend in at all with the GUI I am using.  Please get in touch.

Gizmo

Aha!
Take a look at http://www.york.ac.uk/~dmh11/programs.html and you'll find 
my "AMtuition" AMOS addition (it's not a proper /extension/ so I won't 
call it that :-) ) It makes it very easy for you to have a GUI in AMOS 
programs that looks like Workbench 2.x/3.x, and it has a very 
comprehensive file-requester that looks (and acts) very like the 
asl.library one.

Try out these things:

a) Retokenize the program. This will correct most file errors (which
are
   scarce, really ;-) )
b) If using Data-lines, check out for comments etc. otherwise the
compiler
   will be confused by this remarks.
c) If using permanent banks, check if all the bank lengths are
*even*.
   Not doing so will cause the compiler to create unexecuteable
files.
d) Try out both cli and wb executables.
e) Try to reduce the string buffer size.
f) Avoid dummy and trash strings where possible.
   Use DUMMY=Free in compilcated string manipulation procedures.
g) Ask Francois Lionet to fix the string bugs! :-)
h) Give up. :-(

MW> The prog contains very, very many string-operations.
MW> Can these be at fault ?

I'm quite sure about this. I've coded a lot of programs and my
AMOS-Guide program has to use a lot of string work and you can watch
it crashing after at least 30 seconds scrolling through large
nodes... I'm afraid there's nothing you could do about this but to
avoid using strings... :-(

MW> If you already have such a 'list' : please post it ?

I've heard of a very long list of global amos bugs, if anyone has it
(Andy?), could you please be so kind to post it ;-) Thx.
