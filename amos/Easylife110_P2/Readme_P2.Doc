                        Easylife V1.10 Distribution
                        ===========================


    This is the second archive of a 3 part distribution. This file contains
    the documentation for all easylife commands & acessory programs, along
    with an amiga guide version of the AMOSPro on-line help.

    This documentation may be read with multiview, amigaguide, or any other
    standard amigagudie file viewer, however, I recomend you install the
    easylife extension as described in the 'Readme.Guide' on disk 1, then
    use the AMOSGuide accessory program, as this will cope with some extra
    features of these guide files, such as the ability to load example
    programs directly into the AMOSPro editor.
