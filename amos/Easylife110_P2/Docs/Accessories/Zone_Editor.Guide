          @{b}@{u}Zone Editor V3.01 - By Paul Hickman - (C) Oct 1994@{uu}@{ub}

           Assembly code for fast zoom from the AMOS Pro Object
                        Editor by Francois Lionet 


    This  program  may  be  freely distributed, as long as no profit is
    made  from  doing  so.  Those  wish to distribute for profit should
    contact  the  author.  This  includes  making  a  profit from other
    material  distributed  on  the  same  disk  as the zone editor, and
    distribution on magazine coverdisks.

    The  program  may only be distributed in its original form, you may
    modify it, but modified versions may not be distributed, but should
    be sent back to the author if you have made improvements. If you do
    make any improvements, they will be creditted to you.

@Node Concept "Zone Editor / Concept"

                                @{b}@{u}The Concept@{ub}@{uu}

    The  idea  of  the  zone  editor is that instead of calculating the
    positions of where your zones should be, or sitting in direct mode,
    and  typing  ?X Screen(X Mouse),Y Screen(Y Mouse) all the time, you
    can  simply draw the zones over the screen on which you wish to set
    them.

    The  zone  editor  allows  you to do this, and stores the zones you
    draw  in  a zone bank. The bank is split into an arbitary number of
    groups.  Each  group should contain all the zones that are going to
    be  active  on  the same screen at the same time. You can also load
    several  background  pictures  to  draw  the zones over, aswell are
    drawing  on  those screens open when zone editor was run. NOTE: The
    zones  are not connected to the picture they are drawn over - those
    drawn on one screen can be used on another.



    @{u}Main Improvements Since V2.1@{uu}

  - Nearly all code rewritten for AMOS Pro

  - Takes full advantage of AMOS Pro's accessory features

  - Zoom mode added

  - Menu interface

  - Vastly improvent bank grabing control

  - Multiple background pictures

  - Numeric Co-ordinate entry

  - Cut/Copy/Paste style zone editing

@Node Running "Zone Editor / Running The Program"

                            @{b}@{u}Running Zone Editor@{ub}@{uu}

    There are 4 ways to run the program:

1)  Load it and run it as a normal AMOS program. This is not recomended
    as many of the menu options will not be available.


2)  Run  it  from  another  program with the Prun command. All features
    will  be active, except the ability to read/write Set Zone commands
    directly from the source of the previous program.

    NOTE:  Zone  editor  will  not restore your programs screen display
    afterwards,  will  turn all screens to autoback 1, and turn off all
    bobs.

3)  Load  it  as  an  accessory,  (or load it as a program and hide the
    window),  then run it from the AMOS menu of the AMOSPro editor. All
    features will then be available.


4)  Add  it  to your user menu. This is the best way, as it is easiest.
    To do this:

  - Copy  the  ZoneEditor.AMOS  files  to where you wish to permanently
    keep it.(AMOSPro_Accessories: is recommended if you have room).

  - Select 'Add Option' from AMOSPro's user menu.

  - Enter 'Edit Zones' into the requester, and press OK.

  - Select the new 'Edit Zones' option from the user menu.

  - Select the ZoneEditor.AMOS file in the file requester that appears. 

  - Press  OK  in  the next requester. No command line is required. The
    'Run  as  hidden  program'  must  be checkmarked - Not the 'Load in
    current window'. You may optionaly turn 'Keep after run' on, if you
    have the memory. (Although it isn't worth it from harddisk) 

  - Select the new 'Edit Zones option again.

  - Press 'Shift RAmiga Z' (Or your own hotkey).

  - Select 'Save Default Config' from the 'Config' menu.

    You  can  now  edit  the zones of any AMOSPro program by loading it
    into the editor, and selecting 'Edit Zones' from the user menu.

   
    When  you  run  zone editor by methods 2,3 or 4, the program it was
    run  from,  or the program in the active editor window when you run
    zone editor, becomes the previous program. You will them be able to
    grab  zone  & spacked picture banks from this program, and when run
    by  methods  3  & 4, you can even grab / write Set Zone commands to
    its source code.

    I suggest  you  now  run  the program, and flip between it and this
    manual with Amiga-A. It will help you do understand the rest of the
    manual if you can see the program running, and try things as you go.



    @{u}Program Initialisation@{uu}

    When  you  run the zone editor, it first checks to see which screen
    if  any  is  under the mouse. If there is a screen under the mouse,
    this  will  become the initial current picture when the editor. The
    current  picture  is the one on display above the control panel, on
    which  you  can  draw the zones. Any other open screens are hidden,
    and  become  alternative  pictures, which can be displayed from the
    picture menu (Show Next/Previous).

    Zone  editor requires one screen for its control panel, so if all 7
    screens are open, screen 7 is closed, unless the mouse was over it,
    in which case screen 6 is closed instead.

    NOTE: Hidden screens from your program also become pictures.

    NOTE:  All hires screens are made lowres when displayed by the zone
    editor.

    NOTE: Zone editor can cope with double buffered screens, and HAM
    screens, but may not draw the zones correctly on the later.

@node Drawing "Zone Editor / Drawing Zones"


                             @{b}@{u}Drawing the zones@{ub}@{uu}

    To draw a zone, you must first select it as the current zone. To do
    this:

  - Click the 'ADD' button at the bottom of the control panel to create
    a new zone. It will flash green in the zone list to indicate it has
    become the current zone.

  - Other zones can be made the current zone by selecting them with the
    mouse on the list of zones on the right of the control panel.


    The  co-ordinates  of  whichever  zone  is the current zone  can be
    changed by:

  - Click  the  left mouse button over the picture. The top-left corner
    of the zones co-ordinates are set to the position where you release
    the mouse key.

  - Click  the  right  mouse  button over the picture. The bottom-right
    corner of the zone's co-ordinates are set to the position where you
    release the mouse key.

  - Press  &  Hold  both buttons over the picture, to set one corner of
    the  zone,  then  drag the mouse to a new location, and release the
    buttons to set the opposite corner.

    NOTE:    When   setting   the   Top-Left/Botton-Right   co-ordiates
    individually,  if  you try to set the right co-ordinate to the left
    of  the left co-ordinate, the left co-ordinate is moved to the same
    position as the right. etc.

    NOTE:  If  you  reach the edge of the picture when holding down any
    mouse  key, it is scrolled in the appropriate direction if there is
    a hidden part of the picture off that edge.

    NOTE:  The  pixels under the inverted box which indicates the zones
    position are part of the zone on all 4 edges.
 
    If  you click the magnify button, you can then set zone co-ordinate
    in  the same way in either the magnified, or unmagnified portion of
    the screen.

    When you have a zone selected as the current zone, its co-ordiantes
    appear in this panel. You may change any co-ordinate by clicking on
    it, and entering the new value.

    You  may  enter  values  that are so large they are off the current
    picture,  but  not  negative values. If you enter a top co-ordiante
    below  a bottom co-ordinate etc., the relevant pair are swapped, so
    that the left is always smaller than the right, and the top smaller

    The  program  menu  is  what is stupidly called the project menu in
    many applications, when it has nothing to do with the project being
    edited!  It contains options which do not refer to the bank you are
    currently editing.

    @{u}Help@{uu}

    The menu option allows you to bring up this documentation file from
    within the program. You must set the MULTIVIEW$ command near the
    start of the program to the commandline to execute to display this
    guide. Normally this is:

    "SYS:Utilities/Multiview HELP:ZoneEditor.Guide"

    You can use either multiview, amigaguide or another guide browser.


    @{u}Reset@{uu}
   
    Asks  for  confirmation,  then closes all pictures, erases the zone
    bank being edited, and opens a default picture.


    @{u}Quit@{uu}

    Quits  back  to  the  editor,  or  the next command of the previous
    program if zone editor was run via the Prun command.

    Asks  for  confirmation,  then  erases  the  bank being edited, and
    creates a new empty bank.


    @{u}Information@{uu}

    Displays  some information about the properties, and origins of the
    current  bank  in  the selection panel window. Press the left mouse
    key to continue afterwards.
    

    @{u}Open@{uu}

    If  the  bank  currently  being  editted  was  grabbed, a requester
    appears  offering  to  send it back to the previous program. If you
    decline,  or  the  bank wasn't grabbed, but is unsaved, a requester
    appears  offering to save this bank first. If you select 'Yes', the
    Save  As  function  is  inkoved. If latter abort the save, the open
    operation is cancelled.

    A file  requester then appears from which you should select an AMOS
    .Abk  file that contains a single zone bank. The format of the zone
    bank  has not changed since previous versions of the editor, so old
    zone banks can be loaded with any conversion.

    The bank you select is the loaded into the edit buffer.


    @{u}Save@{uu}

    If  the  current  bank was opened with the Open function, this menu
    option  will  saved  the  modifed  version  back over the original.
    Otherwise it reacts identically to save as.


    S@{u}ave As@{uu}

    A file  requester  appears,  in  which  you should select / enter a
    filename  to  save  the  current zone bank to. If you select a file
    that  already  exists,  a  requester  appears asking if you want to
    overwrite it.


    @{u}Revert@{uu}

    If  the  current  bank  was  opened,  revert will load it from disk
    again,  undoing  any  changes  you have made. If it was grabbed, it
    will be grabbed again. Otherwise, revert has no effect.


    @{b}The  final two options on this menu only appear when the program is
    run as an accessory from the editor, or via the Prun command:@{ub}


    @{u}Grab Bank@{uu}

    This  option copies a zone bank from your previous program into the
    buffer.  When  you select it, you are asked if you want to Send, or
    Save  the  current  bank (Depending on where it originated), then a
    list  of available banks appears in the right hand selection panel,
    from  which  you  should  select  a zone bank to grab, or press the
    right mouse button to cancel.

    When  you  grab  the  bank, it is copied from your previous program
    into  the  zone  editor buffer. It is not removed from the previous
    program with the Bgrab command.


    @{u}Send Bank@{uu}

    This  option  copies  the  zone  editor  buffer into a bank of your
    previous program. If the bank you are editting was grabbed from the
    program,  a  requester  appears  asking  if  you want to udpate the
    original  from  which  you  grabbed  it.  If  you select 'Yes', the
    original is updated. If you select 'No', or if the current bank was
    not  grabbed,  a  list  of all possible bank numbers appears in the
    selection pannel, along with the type of bank next to those in use.

    Select  the bank number you wish to send to. any existing bank will

    The  group  menu  operations  concern  all zones in the group being
    edited, but do not affect the rest of the bank.


    @{u}Open AscII@{uu}

    This  function  reads  all  the Set Zone commands it can find in an
    AscII  file,  and  inserts  them into the current group. Only those
    existing  zones  with  the  same  numbers  as  those in the file as
    overwritten - the other existing zones are unaffected.

    A file  selector  opens to select the file to read from. It must be
    pure  AscII,  not  a .AMOS file. Only those Set Zone commands which
    contains  decimal integer numbers for all 5 parameters will be read
    into  the  group.  Those which use variables, or other number bases
    are ignored.


    @{u}Save AscII@{uu}

    This  function  saves  the current group as a set of AscII Set Zone
    commands,  and  is headed by a line to reserve enough zones for the
    group. A file selector opens to select the file to save to.
        

    @{u}Grab Screen@{uu}

    This  function  attempts to replace the current group with the AMOS
    Screen  zones  that  are  currently defined on the current picture.
    There  will  only be zones to grab if this picture is from a screen
    that was already open when the zone editor was run. You cannot grab
    screen  zones from an opened picture, or a picture grabbed from the
    previous programs banks.

    If  the current group already contains some zones, you are asked to
    verify that you want to replace them.



    @{b}The  final  2  options  in this menu will only appear when the zone
    editor  is run as an accessory from the AMOSPro editor (Methods 3 &
    4 in  the 'Running Zone Editor' section). They will not appear when
    run with a 'Prun' command.@{ub}

        
    @{u}Grab Source@{uu}
    
    This  option  allows you to read 'Set Zone' command from the source
    code  of  the  previous  program.  When  you select it, the AMOSPro
    editor  screen  appears, showing the previous program with all it's
    procedures unfolded. You should mark the start and end of the block
    you  wish  to  read  the  set zone command from using the following
    controls:
        
        
    Control/Shift/Cursor Left: Search for previous 'Set Zone' command.
        
    Control/Shift/Cursor Right: Search for next 'Set Zone' command. 
             
    Other Cursor Keys: Work as normally in editor, including when they 
                       are shifted / pressed with control / pressed with
                       Control & Shift.

    Space Bar : Mark start / end of block.
        
    Escape : Abort operation, and return to zone editor.
        
        
    NOTE:  Only  Set  Zone  commands where all 5 parameters are decimal
    integer  numbers are read. Those containing variables, expressions,
    or numbers in other bases are ignored.
        
    NOTE:  Only  those  zones  defined  in  the  Set  Zone commands are
    overwritten  in  the  current  group  -  the  rest  of the group is
    untouched.
        
    NOTE: Extra blank zones will be inserted into the group to fill the
    gaps  between  non-consecutive zone numbers, if there were no zones
    with those numbers defined previously.
        

        
    @{u}Send Source@{uu}
    
    This  is the opposite of the grab source operation - it inserts the
    current  group  in  the source code as Set Zone commands. Using the
    same  controls  as grab source, move to the point at which you wish
    to insert the new commands, and press space.
        
    NOTE: A Reserve zone command is placed before the set zone commands
    to reserve an appropriate number of zones.

    The  picture  menu  functions to not affect the zone bank, only the
    background picture on which the zones are drawn.


    @{u}Show Next@{uu}

    If  you  have  several  pictures open, this option will display the
    next one. Otherwise it has no effect.


    @{u}Show Previous@{uu}
  
    This  is  the  same as Show Next, except it cycles through the open
    pictures in reverse order.


    @{u}Information@{uu}

    Displays various statistics of the current picture in the selection
    panel window. Press the left mouse button when done.


     @{u}Open@{uu}

    If  there  are  not too many pictures open, a file selector appears
    from  which  you  should  select an IFF picture, or an AMOS Spacked
    bank  file.  You  may  open up to 6 pictures at a time (Except when
    zoom mode is on, when you may only open 5).

    NOTE:  IFF  files  that  are  larger  than  1024  pixels  in either
    direction, or that require any AGA graphics mode cannot be opened.


     @{u}Close@{uu}

    This  option  closes  the  current picture, releasing the memory it
    uses.  NOTE:  You must have at least one picture open at all times,
    so you may not close the last picture.


     @{u}Paste Clip@{uu}

    Loads  the  picture  from unit 0 of the clipboard, either as an IFF
    file,  or an Spack .Abk file (Not that there is likely to be one of
    those on the clipboard, but you never know...)

    This  can  be  used  to  read brushes Copied from Dpaint IV's brush
    menu, or even icons copied from iconian.


     @{u}Grab@{uu}

    If  the  program  was run as an accessory, or via the prun command,
    you  may  use  this menu option to open an spacked picture from the
    banks of the previous program.

    The  selection  panel  on  the right hand side of the control panel
    which  from  which  you usually select zones lists the banks of the
    previous  program.  Select one which contains an Spacked picture to
    open it.

    NOTE: The AMOS BGrab command is not used - the bank is not
          removed from the previous program.

@node Zones "Zone Editor / Zones Menu"


                                 @{b}@{u}Zone Menu@{ub}@{uu}

    The  Zones  menu  operaions act upon a subset of the current group,
    often those zones highlighted in the selection panel.


    @{u}Select All@{uu}

    This  selects all the zones in the current group, highlighting them
    in blue in the selection panel.


    @{u}Cut@{uu}

    This  performs  similarly  to  the  cut  operation  in  most  word-
    processors  / text editors. The selected zones are removed from the
    current group and stored in the cut buffer. 

    NOTE: Only the zone co-ordinates are stored in the cut buffer - the
    zone  numbers  are not. They may be pasted/inserted back into this,
    or another group at any point.


    @{u}Copy@{uu}

    This  copies  the  selected zones into the cut buffer, but does not
    remove them from the current group.


    @{u}Paste Over@{uu}

    This  copies the cut buffer into the current group, begining at the
    current  zone (Highlighted in flashing green). That zone, and those
    after it are overwriten by the zones from the cut buffer.

    NOTE: If the cut buffer is empty, or there is no current zone,
          Paste Over has no effect.


    @{u}Insert@{uu}

    This  inserts  the  zones in the cut buffer into the current group,
    just  before  the  current  zone,  without  overwriting  any of the
    existing  zones. The zone numbers of those zones after the inserted
    zones are increased by the number of zones inserted.

    NOTE: If the cut buffer is empty, or these is no current zone,
          Insert has no effect.

@node Preferences "Zone Editor / Preferences"

    A few  variables at the start of the zone editor can be modified by
    the user. See the top of the source code for documentation.

@node Easylife "Zone Editor / Zone Bank Support"


                        @{b}@{u}Easylife Zone Bank Support@{ub}@{uu}

   The easylife extension has 3 commands to support zone banks:


   @{b}ElZb Add SCREEN,BANK,GROUP@{ub}

    This  command  installs  a  single  group  from  a zone bank on the
    current screen, as normal AMOS zones, erasing any zones already set
    on  that  screen  first. SCREEN in the screen number (0-7), BANK in
    the  bank  number  of  the  zone bank, GROUP is the group number to
    install. 

    NOTE: You DO NOT need a 'Reserve Zone' command before Elzb Add.



    @{b}ElZb Multi Add SCREEN,BANK,GROUP@{ub}

    This  command  is  similar  to  the  previous, except the zones are
    installed  as easylife multi zones, instead of normal screen zones.
    The  other  difference  is  that the previous zones are not erased,
    unless their group & ID numbers clash with those in the group being
    added. 

    NOTE: You DO need to use a 'Elmz Reserve <NUM>' first to reserve
          a sufficent number of multi zones for the group.



    @{b}Elzb Install SCREEN,BANK@{ub}

    This command installs all groups of the zone bank as easylife multi
    zones, erasing all existing multi zones first. 

    NOTE: You DO NOT need to use a 'Elmz Reserve' command first.




                          @{b}@{u}Other zone bank support@{ub}@{uu}


    The  ZB_ADD  procedure  is  equivilent  to  the  Elzb  Add  command
    described above, but does not use the easylife extension.

@node Format "Zone Editor / Internal Format Of A Zone Bank"

                             @{b}@{u}Zone bank format@{ub}@{uu}

    If ST is the address Start(BANK_NO), Leek(ST) returns the number of
    groups,  NG.  The next NG longwords contain the offset of the start
    of  each  group  from  ST,  in  order  of  group  number. The group
    definitions then follow, also in group number order.

    The format of each group is that the first word contains the number
    of  zones  in the group I.E. NZ=Deek(ST+Leek(ST+G*4)). Then follows
    the  co-ordinates  of  each zone in the group, in ascending numeric
    order,  with  the  individual  co-ordinates taking 1 word each, and
    appearing in the order Left,Top,Right,Bottom



    So that bank format in assembler notation is:


    ST:     dc.l    NG

            dc.l    Group1 - ST
            dc.l    Group2 - ST
            dc.l    Group3 - ST

               .
               .
               .

            dc.l    GroupNG - ST



    Group1: dc.w    Number zones in group 1 (NZ1)
        
            dc.w    Group1,Zone1 Left Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group1,Zone1 Top Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group1,Zone1 Right Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group1,Zone1 Bottom Co-ordinate

            dc.w    Group1,Zone2 Left Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group1,Zone2 Top Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group1,Zone2 Right Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group1,Zone2 Bottom Co-ordinate

                .
                .
                .

            dc.w    Group1,ZoneNZ1 Left Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group1,ZoneNZ1 Top Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group1,ZoneNZ1 Right Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group1,ZoneNZ1 Bottom Co-ordinate



    Group2: dc.w    Number of zones in group 2 (NZ2)

            dc.w    Group2,Zone1 Left Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group2,Zone1 Top Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group2,Zone1 Right Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group2,Zone1 Bottom Co-ordinate

                .
                .
                .
 
            dc.w    Group2,ZoneNZ2 Left Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group2,ZoneNZ2 Top Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group2,ZoneNZ2 Right Co-ordinate
            dc.w    Group2,ZoneNZ2 Bottom Co-ordinate



    Group3: .......
