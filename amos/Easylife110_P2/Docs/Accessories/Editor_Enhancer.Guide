This program adds four very simple, but very useful utilities, to the 
AMOSPro editor's user menu. They are:
 
	@{"Get Scancode           " link SCANCODE}
	@{"Get AscII              " link ASCII}
	@{"Get File               " link FILE}   
	@{"Unflip Bobs            " link UNFLIP}



Also, it replaces all the AMOSPro Search & Replace menu option with new
improved versions:


	@{"Search                 " link FIND}
	@{"Search Next            " link FINDNEXT}
	@{"Search Previous        " link FINDPREV}

@node Introduction "Editor Enhancer / Introduction"

             @{b}@{u}AMOSPro Editor Enhancer V1.01  -  By Paul Hickman@{uu}@{ub}

    The  Editor  Enhancer started life as 2 little accessories, one to
    unflip  bobs  for the bob editor, and one to get AscII & Scancodes
    from  keypresses.   Then I tried to use the AMOSPro editors search
    and  replace  feature  for  the  first time, and thought to myself
    @{b}AAARRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!!@{ub}. Hence the editor enhancer was born.

    Now  you  can  have a search and replace that is actually *useful*
    E.g.   Now  when you select replace next, it does a replace then a
    search,  not  a search then a replace, so you can actually see the
    occurance  that  is to be replaced before it is too late.  You can
    also now select which parts of the program to search.  @endnode



@node Requirements "Editor Enhancer / Requirements"


	                       @{b}@{u}Requirements@{uu}@{ub}

    The  only  requirements  for the editor enhancer are that you have
    AMOSPro, with Easylife V1.07+ installed.  
@endnode



@node Installation "Editor Enhancer / Installation"


	                    @{b}@{u}Installation@{uu}@{ub}

@{u}Upgrading V1.0 to V1.01@{uu}

    If   you   have   V1.00   installed,   simply   copy   the   V1.01
    Editor_Enhancer.AMOS  file over your old version and you are done.
    Otherwise, don't let this put you of but...


    Unfortunately,  there  is  a lot to do.  You install each of the 4
    user  menu  utilities seperately - If you really don't want any of
    them,  you  can skip adding them to the user menu, or if you are a
    masochist,  you  can  not  change the search functions, but if you
    install  1 part of the program, you might as well to the rest - it
    won't  take  any more memory (Well OK, a few bytes for the strings
    you enter)

    NOTE:   Either install all search menu functions, or none of them.
            If you install just some of them, it won't work properly.
      


 1) If you haven't run the easylife installer script, make sure that the
    Editor_Enhancer. AMOS file in it's permanent location.  For harddisk
    users, this would normally be "AMOSPro_Accesories:". For floppy disk
    users, it should be in "Easylife2:Accessories/".


 2) Load the AMOSPro editor. 


 3) Select 'Add Option' on the user menu, and type 'Get Scancode' into
    the requester, and press OK.

   
 4) Select the  'Get Scancode'  option which  has now  appeared on the 
    user menu  when asked  which menu  option to assign a  program to,
    then select the Editor_Enhancer.AMOS program.
   

 5) In the next requester, set the options as below, then press OK:

  - Run as hidden program
   
  - Keep after running (Important that this is on)
   
  - Command line = 'SCANCODE' (Without the quotes)

   
 6) If  you  want  a keyboard shortcut, select the 'Get Scancode' menu
    option  again, then press the keyboard shortcut.  If you chose not
    to  add  a  shortcut, don't worry, you can do so later on with the
    'Set key Shortcut' option in the config menu.

   
 7) Repeat  steps  3-6  to  add  three more options, 'Get AscII', 'Get
    Filename',  and  'Unflip  Images',  setting  the  command  line to
    'ASCII', 'FILE' and 'UNFLIP' in each case.


 8) Select  'Set Program To Menu' from the config menu, the choose the
    'Search    New'    from    the    search    menu.     Select   the
    Editor_Enhancer.AMOS in the file selector.  In the next requester,
    set the options to:
   
  - Run as hidden program
   
  - Keep after running (Important that this is on)
   
  - Command line = 'FIND'

   
 9) Repeat  step 8 five more times, selecting each search menu item in
    turn,  and  setting  the  command  lines  to  'FIND  NEXT',  'FIND
    PREVIOUS', 'REPLACE', 'REPLACE NEXT', 'REPLACE PREVIOUS'.

   
10) Select  'Save  Default  Config'  from  the Config menu to make the
    changes  you have made to the menus permanent.  Alternatively, you
    may save to a different configuration file with 'Save Config'.  If
    you chose the later, you must reload this configuration with 'Load
    Config' every time you use AMOS Pro.

    Try  the  program  before  saving  the  configuration - if you are
    seriously   deranged,   and   don't   like   it,  don't  save  the
    configuration,  then  call  a shrink to help you work through your
    problem  (Or  if  you  are  a shrink, find a mirror, and don't get
    offended  at  the  term 'shrink' - I'm to crap at spelling to even
    contemplate thinking about the spelling of the P word).


    Phew.

@node History "Editor Enhancer / Program History"


			   @{b}Program History@{ub}@{u}@{uu}


@{u}Changes V1.00 ---> V1.01@{uu}

  - After inserting a AscII Code / Scancode / Filename, the cursor is
    automatically moved to the end of the inserted text.

  - BUG FIX: When searching for something that is found at the same X
    cursor position as the current X cursor position, the cursor was
    moved right one space.

  - When a search string is not found, a 'Not Found' message appears,
    and the cursor is not moved to the end of the program anymore.

  - Which options were checkmarked in the search/replace requester is
    remembered for the next time it is brought up.

  - Unfold procedures option added.

  - HUGE bug fixed in the global replace - it didn't find more than one
    occurance on the same line (err... Oops :-)

  - If you are not in the middle of a search/replace the Next/Previous
    menu options will bring up the search/replace requester.

@node Notes "Editor Enhancer / Notes On Usage"


			  @{u}@{b}Miscellanous Notes@{ub}@{uu}

@{u}Cavat@{uu}

    You  can't  use any of the menu functions assigned to this program
    if  it  is  in  an  open  edit  window.   Hide it if you have this
    problem.   This does mean it is impossible to use search / replace
    on this program's source code!



@{u}De-Installation@{uu}

    You want to remove my wonderful program ???????????????????        
        
    Well,  if  you just want the memory back after using it, select it
    on  the  accessories  menu, and 'New' it.  If you want to remove a
    user menu option permanently, select 'Delete Option' from the user
    menu, then the option to delete.  If you want the get the original
    search / replace functions back, select 'Set Program To Menu' from
    the  config  menu,  and press erase in the requester that appears.
    Remember  to  save  the  editor  configuration  after  making  any
    changes.

    Send  ideas  for  more features / bug reports to me (Paul Hickman)
    via  e-mail  (ph@doc.ic.ac.uk).   Also  if you modify the program,
    please  send  me  back  the  changed  copy  for redistribution.  I
    actively encourage you to add features to this program - it should
    be obvious how to do so - just put an extra 'If' block in the main
    program.   Use  'Reserve  As  Data'  to  store permanent variables
    between  runnings  of  the program.  Insert code to reset these to
    the  default  values  in the error routine for when the program is
    run directly.




@{u}Legal Stuff@{uu}

    This  program  may  be  freely distributed in its original form as
    long  as  no  profit  is  made  from doing so, either directly, or
    indirecty.   The distribution must contain this documentation with

    same  conditions,  but the fact that I am the original author must
    not be removed from the program, or documentation.

    When  you  select  this  option,  the  Improved  Search  requester
    appears.   Along  with a gadget to enter the search string, it has
    the following controls:


    [F1] Backwards

	When  checkmarked, the initial search is backwards from
	the current cursor position.  Otherwise it is forwards.


    [F2] Case Sensitive

	When  checkmarked,  the  search  is  case  sensitive to
	alphabetical characters.  Otherwise the case of letters
	is  ignored  when  they  are checked against the search
	string.

        
     [F3] From Begining
	
	The search begins from the top of the program when this
	is  checkmarked.   Otherwise  it  is  from  the  cursor
	position.


     [F4] Unfold Procedures

	When  checkmarked,  all procedures that can be unfolded
	will be unfolded before the search begins.





    You  can also choose which parts of your code will be searched for
    the string, limiting by context:

	    
    [F6] Search Strings
	
	Occurances  within strings are only found / replaced if 
	this option is checkmarked.
	  
	  
    [F7] Search Comments	  

	Occurances within comments are only found / replaced if
	this option is checkmarked.
            
            
    [F8] Search Code
        
	Occurances  outside comments & strings are only found /
	replaced if this option is checkmarked.


    NOTE:   If  you  search  string contains a quote character (Either
    single  or  double),  you should turn all three options on to find
    the string correctly, otherwise occurances may be missed.

    When you press OK (or Return twice), the string is searched for.

    NOTE: If the search string is empty when you press OK,  the search
    is cancelled. You can also cancel by pressing escape.

   The  replace   reqeuster  feature  all  features  of the  @{"search" link FIND}
   requester,  and  everything  said  about  it  also  applies to the
   replace  requester.  In addtion, there is another string gadget to
   enter the replace string, and 2 more options:

   [F9] Replace All Occurnces In Marked Block

	All  occurances  in  the  current  marked block will be
	replaced with the replace string, subject to the search
	string  occuring  in  a  part  of  the  text  for which
	searching is enabled with the F6 - F8 keys.


   [F10] Replace All Occurances

	A   Global   replace   is   performed,  replaceing  all
	occurances of the search string that occur in a part of
	the  text  for  which searching is enabled.  All global
	replaces   begin  at  the  top  of  the  file.   It  is
	recommended that you also unfold all procedures [F4].



    If  Either  of these two replace options is selected, then all the
    relevant occurances of the search string are replaced immediately.
    Otherwise, the first occurance of the search string (Using F1 & F3
    settings)  is  found.   You  may  then  you Replace Next / Replace
    Previous  to  replace it, or Search Next / Search Previous to skip
    this occurance, and find the next.

        
     NOTE:  As with the search requester, if the search string is empty
     when  you  exit  the  requester,  the search & replace operaion is
     always  canceled.   However, if the replace string is empty, it is
     not canceled, but becomes a "search & delete".
