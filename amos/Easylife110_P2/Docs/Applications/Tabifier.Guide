@node Introduction "Tabifier / Introduction"

			 @{b}@{u}AMOS / MUI Tabifier V1.0@{uu}@{ub}

	The  Tabifier  is  a  simple  example  of  creating  an MUI
	interface for an AMOS program.	Its use is to take an AscII
	text  file, and replace any strings of spaces with tabs, to
	shorten	 the  file,  without changing the appearance of the
	text.

	In addition, it may also convert existing tabs to a new tab
	size,  and  will remove any trailing spaces / tabs from the
	end of each line.

@node Requirements "Tabifier / Requirements"

		       @{b}@{u}Requirements@{uu}@{ub}

	To run the tabifier, you will need version 1.07+ of Easylife 
        installed, together with MUI V2.1+


	The  tabifier  will also require twice the size of the file
        to be tabified + 8192 bytes of memory when performing the
        tabify operation.

@endnode



@node Gadgets "Tabifier / Gadget Controls"

				   @{b}@{u}Gadget Controls@{uu}@{ub}

	The  tabifier window contains to 2 string gadgets.  The top
	one  is the name of the file to be tabified.  The bottom is
	the filename to saved the tabified version to.	The buttons
	to the right of the strings will pop up ASL file requesters
	to fill the string gadgets.

	Below  this  are  2 cycle gadgets to select tab size of the
	old  file,  and	 the  tab  size of the newly tabified file.
	Then there are 4 buttons:


	@{b}Out = In@{ub}

	Pressing this button makes the outfile name the same as the
	infile name.


	@{b}Start@{ub}

	Pressing  this button begins tabifying the file.  The gauge
	at  the bottom of the window will show how much of the file
	has been tabified so far.


	@{b}Abort@{ub}

	Press this during tabification to stop tabifying the file.


	@{b}Quit@{ub}

	Three guesses.

@node Menus "Tabifier / Menus"

                             @{b}@{u}Application Menu@{ub}@{uu}

	@{b}About@{ub}

	Displays  the information about the program, including free
	memory.


	@{b}Hide@{ub}

        Iconifies the program. The method of iconification is set with the
        MUI preferences program, but is normally to an appicon.


	@{b}Save Config@{ub}

	Saves a configuration file to ENVARC: which records:

      - The Position & Size of the window

      - The pathnames of the In file & Out File.

      - The old & new tab sizes.

      - The options menu settings.


        This configuration will then be automatically reloaded whenever
        you run tabifier.
        

	@{b}Quit@{ub}

	Causes a custard pie to come flying out of your monitor, land
	on the keyboard, and short-circuit the machine. DO NOT USE




                               @{b}@{u}Options Menu@{ub}@{uu}


        @{b}Detabify Only@{ub}

        When checkmarked, the existing tabs are all converted to spaces
        using the old tab size setting, but no new tabs are then inserted
        into the file. This invariably makes the file longer, but it is
        then tab-free.


        @{b}AmigaGuide Mode@{ub}

        Checkmark this option when tabifying amigaguide documents. It
        will then not permit tabs on any line after an @ character, as
        this would change the layout of an amigaguide file.
