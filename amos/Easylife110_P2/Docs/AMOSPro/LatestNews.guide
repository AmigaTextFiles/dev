@node HELPPRECISION "Double Precision info" 

We only got Double Precision working very near the end of the project, too
late for the User Guide! So there's something else you need to know:

Single and Double don't mix!
----------------------------

Imagine you've just loaded in your favourite sine scroller and want to make
it even more accurate with the new Double Precision feature of AMOS Pro.
To do this you need to add the SET DOUBLE PRECISION command at the top of
your program and then (and this is the new bit), you need to retokenise the
program using the accessory which is available from the User menu.

The retokeniser changes all the single precision numbers in your program
into double precision. This needs to be done because single to double
precision conversions would have to happen during your program. These
conversions are not very accurate and take longer to work out. So it's
best to have the same precision throughout your program. You could run
a mixture of the two precisions but you'll lose accuracy.

@node HELPCONFIG "Configuration info" 

When you installed AMOS Professional, the installer set up options within
the configuration that benefits your memory situation. For example the Undo
buffers are set low on a 1 meg machine.

So don't use a 1 meg AMOS Pro disc on a bigger machine - just reinstall it.

@endnode



@node HELPMEMORY "Memory Considerations - 1 meg users of AMOS Professional" 

AMOS Professional does its best to give you as much available memory as
possible. But at the end of the day AMOS Professional is a huge program with
many memory requirements. So we'll point you in the right direction by
offering the following advice:


* A Multitasking machine in its own nature needs to have spare memory to
  operate properly. So you must ensure that at least 32k memory is left free
  for the system's own needs. Trying to grab all the memory is just too
  risky.

* AMOS Professional has a built-in low memory protection system that helps you
  avoid using up memory.

  If you find the Editor's drop down menus cannot be accessed, it's because
  there's less than 72k available and AMOS Professional needs more to open
  them. If you let this happen you are still able to use the keyboard
  short-cuts.

  AMOS Professional also has a memory grabber. When Pro detects less than 72k
  is available it will erase the following until more than 72k is freed:

        - the Default screen (if open).
        - any open maths libraries (if they are not needed anymore)
        - the Undo buffers
        - the directory Stored in the File Selector

  If Pro can than access more than 72k it will allow the menus to be opened.

* You may find that some programs will fail under AMOS Pro and yet work fine
  in old AMOS. Obviously AMOS Pro's new Editor and features take up more
  memory. So to free up memory when your programs run try these techniques:

   - The Close Editor command will free a considerable amount of memory but
     will still leave you with a 50k overhead compared to old AMOS.

   - Using the new Kill Editor command will free so much memory that you'll
     have 32k more to play with than was possible in old AMOS. The bad news
     is you'll have to wait for the editor to load after each run.

     Some programs that use Kill Editor may ask for lots of memory by
     reserving banks and opening screens. Once the program has finished, AMOS
     Pro attempts to reload the Editor. It will first ask you to insert the
     System disc so that it can find the Editor files and then attempt to
     load it.

     If this fails due to low memory, AMOS Pro will clear all variables, the
     screens etc.

     If it still fails a small requester will appear that asks if you want to
     erase the memory banks - this should be plenty for the editor to load,
     if not you'll be dumped into the Workbench.

     So when you program in a low memory state, ensure your program erases the
     banks before going back to the editor.

A memory expansion would be the best solution if you find yourself always
programming around low memory conditions!

Losing the File Selector Stored Directories
-------------------------------------------
If you find the Store option has been erased this will be due to a memory
flush that occured earlier in your programming.

@node FEATURES "Features added to AMOS Professional" 

@{b}Here's the list of V1.12-->V2.00 modifications:@{ub}


* AMOSPro


The  re-write of AMOSPro has resulted in a vast reduction in the size of the
"AMOSPro"  file.   It is now only a mere 20K.  AMOSPro is now only a loader:
it  loads  "AMOS.library",  the  main  instruction  set ("AMOSPro.Lib"), the
various extensions, the editor and the monitor files.  That's all it does.


* The Main Instruction Set

The  main  instruction  set is now treated as a normal extension to AMOSPro.
Every  instruction  routine  is  now  callable  from another extension.  The
system is now fully modular.
	AMOSPro.Lib  is  common  to  both  the  AMOSPro  Interpreter and the
Compiler.   This means that a new AGA update for example, would add commands
to  AMOSPro.Lib  and  these  would  be  available under both interpreter and
Compiler.


* The Extensions

With  the  extension  system  being  extended to cope with all the different
syntaxes of the AMOSPro instruction set, it is now much more versatile.  You
can  create  reserved  variables  within  extension,  have  single or double
floating point parameters etc.  The extension system is also compatible with
all the extensions written for AMOSPro since V1.00.

Extension  writers  should  wait  for  the  AGA  version  of  AMOSPro before
releasing  their  code  into  the  public  domain:   AGA  will  induce  many
modifications within the screen structures of AMOS.  Information about these
new screen structures will become available when we release the AGA version.


* The AMOS.Library

- The requester routines are now part of the library. This reduces the size
  of the requester extension to a mere 250 Bytes

-  The default Mouse.Abk has been included within the library.  If you want
   to,  you  can  remove  it  from  your  APSystem  folder,  so long as your
   AMOSPro_Interpreter_Config does not call it.

- AMOSPro_Default.Font is no longer necessary:  AMOS.Library now asks for a
  system font to create the AMOSPro window font.  As a default this font is
  Topaz 8, but you can change it to whatever 8x8 fixed size font you wish
  using Interpreter_Config.

You'll  be  glad  to  here  that the default font is now the same throughout
AMOSPro:  In the menus, the graphical text instructions and in windows.


* Default resource banks

The  resource  banks  have been cleaned up.  Some icons have been redrawn to
offer  a  better  graphical  interface.   The  Default resource includes new
graphic elements to create new kinds of buttons and editing zones.


* AMOSPro Interpreter Config

The  default  screen  setup  has  been  rewritten  to  accept the future AGA
palettes.


* AMOSPro Editor Config

The  editor  screen  setup has also been rewritten to cope with the extended
AGA palettes, availables when AMOSPro works in AGA.


* New function: =ZDialog (Channel,X,Y)

This  new  instruction  can  be  very  useful:  it returns the number of the
interface zone under X and Y coordinates - without waiting.

Channel:	Number of an opened dialogue channel
X : 		X screen coordinate to test
Y : 		Y screen coordinate to test

Result:
-1:		the coordinate does not point to a zone
>-1:		the number of the zone




@{b}Here is a list of V1.00-->V1.12 modifications:@{ub}



- AMOSPro now works on a AA machine (1200/4000).

You can now launch AMOSPro from  the  workbench  on a AA machine, and flip
between AMOSPro and the workbench.  AMOSPro  does  not yet exploit the new
resolution modes: we are currently working on it.
You should just switch off any virus checker or any resident utility  that
might  bring the workbench  screen to  the front while  AMOSPro is  on the 
screen (you can however, leave the screen blanker utility ON while AMOSPro
is running).
This small problem will be corrected in the true AA version of AMOSPro, to 
be released later this year.


- AMOSPro now works with a screen blanker.

A screen blanker can  work  under  the  workbench without causing problems
with AMOSPro. When AMOSPro  is  displayed  it  sends  fake mouse movements
every 5 seconds simulating a user  input. This prevents the screen blanker
from popping up in the background.


- The file selector has been vastly improved.

* Full Multitasking: the input/ouput of  the  file selector is now handled
by a separate task. You can safely type in a file name while the directory
is being read.

* STORE slider: instead of this  button's  old affect of displaying random
directories, you are now presented with a list of all the stored directory
pathnames. Just click on the pathname you  wish  to view and the list will
be presented.

* The Right mouse button now  has  an  affect. This was originally in AMOS
and Easy AMOS: click the  right  mouse  button  and you'll get the current
device list displayed in the file selector. Click again and you'll receive
the assign list, click another  time  and  you'll  get  the stored list of
directories, and another time brings you back to the directory you started
from.

* You can now enter full pathnames into the filename zone. For example, if
you type "Work:AMOS_Pro/Interpretor_Config.AMOS"  into  the  name zone and
press return, the filename will  be  computed into: "Work:AMOS_Pro" in the
path zone and  "Interpretor_Config.AMOS"  into  the  filename  zone. Press
RETURN another time to accept the name.

* Fast file finding: enter one letter  into the name zone, and press HELP,
the file list will be positioned  at  the begining of the specified letter
(or as close as possible. This feature  is best used on large directories,
there is no benefit if used in a directory of say nine files.


- The text reader now accepts hypertext.

By  using the enhanced  text reader, it is now possible to add interactive
help files to your programs and even have a professional looking window in
which to display the text.  This is a  simple process of just adding a few
codes into your text.

The hypertext system is of course based  on the AMOS  Interface  hypertext
system. It's best that you take  a  look  at  page 09.03.15 of the AMOSPro
User Guide and read up on the HyperText command before using this system.

You  can   also   edit   the   file   called   "Equate.Doc"   (located  in
AMOSPro_Productivity1:Equates.) This file is a  perfect  example of such a
text.

How to proceed.

* Your text must begin with a special code, of 8 letters:

  #HYPx000

#HYP tells the text reader that the text includes hypertext codes.

"x" is a number, from 1 to 9 informing the text reader how many hyper text
codes there will be on one line.

"000" is not used yet and is reserved for future expansions. You must keep
it to 000!

* Within the text define the  hypertext  zone using the normal method. The
action taken when the user clicks on your zone depends on the TYPE (string
or digit) of your zone.

  + Digit: the number reported by the zone is a LINE NUMBER. When the user
clicks on this zone, the text reader will simply go to the specified line.
Example:

      { [32 ,6,3]   How does it work?   }

      will branch to line #32 in case of click...

  + String: a click on this  zone  will  close  the text reader and report
the keyword to the main program  in  =Param$.  If  the user clicked on the
CLOSE icon of  the  text  reader,  =Param$  will  return  an empty string.
Example (from Equate.Doc):

      { [ADD,4,7] RUN and add equates current file }
      { [CRE,4,7] RUN and create a new equate file }
      { [QUT,4,7]     QUIT     }

     In the program:

      Read Text "Equates.Doc"
      If Param$="ADD"
      ...
      Else If Param$="CRE"
      ...
      Else
      ... Quit the program
      End If

Hyper-text is a  simple  and  user-friendly  way  of  creating menu driven
program documentation.


- Testing speed has been improved.

The testing process has  been  rewritten,  and  is  now  up  to 50% faster
(usually 30 to 40% on a 68000  based Amiga). The difference is obvious for
bigger programs such as the Disc Manager and the Object Editor.


- You can now configurate your  own  default  screen. Getting bored of the
orange lowres  screen?  You'd  prefer  it  to  be  workbench  grey,  hires
interlaced and overscanned? No problem,  just  set  it  up to your heart's
desire using the new options in the Interpreter_Config.AMOS program.

How to proceed?

 + Call the  "Set  Interpreter"  option  from  the  Config  menu under the
editor.
 + Load the Default Configuration
 + Select "System Configuration Page 1"
 + Select "Set Default Screen"
 + With the buttons, just define the characteristics of your screen.

 Number of bitplanes: 1 for 2 colours, 2 for 4 colours, 3 is 8 colours
                      4 is 16 colours. Hires mode on or off,
                      Interlaced mode on or off.

 + Use the sliders to set the colour palette.
 + Once the characteristics of your screen  are defined you can modify its
size and position on the screen by clicking on "Set Screen's Position"
 + When everything is done, just click  3  times on EXIT (you have to keep
moving  back  out  through   the   various   menus),   and  save  out  the
configuration. Your default screen will appear next time you boot AMOSPro.

Important Warning:
Some program may rely on the default "default screen". That is 320x200 16
colours, lowres with the old colour palette. They might stop with an error
or the display may be corrupted.  So  to  fix  these programs just add the
command:

  Screen Open 0,320,200,16,Lowres

to the start of the program's code.

- You can now configure the Amiga-A key combination. Up till now there has
been no choice, Amiga-A was  the  only  way  to  flip between AMOS and the
Workbench. Now you can define your very own key combination.

How to proceed?

+ Call the "Set Interpreter" option from the Config menu under the editor.
+ Load the Default Configuration
+ Select "System Configuration Page 2"
+ Enter the desired letter into the AMOS / Workbench edit zone
+ Click on the correct shift combination
+ Quit and save you  configuration.  The  new  key shortcut will be active
after your next boot.


- The ugly little workbench screen has been removed.
AMOSPro used to open a small screen at the bottom of the workbench display
to do its graphical  work.  Some  users  have  complained  about this (and
rightly so). It has now been removed.  In fact the entire screen system in
amos.library has been totally re-written so that it is much more
system-friendly.

- It is now possible to relocate the mouse pointer when in direct mode.
If you have lost your mouse pointer  (it's off the screen or you've hidden
it), just press the <HELP> key  and  the  mouse pointer will appear in the
top-left corner of the direct mode window.

- Direct mode history buffer now works exactly as the CLI history system.

- Closing the last window also  gives  you  the option to quit the AMOSPro
editor.
When you close the last available  window  of  the  editor, you now have a
requester asking whether  you  want  to  QUIT  AMOSPro  or  not.  It's not
necessary to select the QUIT option from the AMOS menu any more. NOTE: you
can even quit faster by quiting AMOSpro without any warning when you close
the last window. This is activated if  you de-select 'Confirm Quit' in the
"Quit Options" from the "Config" menu.

- Disc Manager format and copy.
The disc manager now  copies  discs.  It  can  also  copy  and format high
density discs on an Amiga 4000.

- The monitor does not single step through closed procedures anymore.
This allows much faster debugging:  just  open  the procedures you want to
step through and call the monitor. Any closed procedure will be treated as
a single instruction.


- The Resource Bank editor now has  a  "PRINT" option to print the strings
contained in the bank.


- The Editor remote control commands are now listed in the equate file.
You can have full details about all the commands by running the program:

  AMOSPro_Productivity1:Equates/Editor_Commands.AMOS

@node PROBLEMS "Problems removed from Version 1.0" 


@{b}Bugs fixed in version 2.00@{ub}

* Block in the editor.
The  editor used to add garbage at the end of a block when cutting the block
which included a non-tokenised line.

* Program to menu problems: you could totally mess-up the editor's menu by
adding/removing   "Programs   to   Menu"  on  certain  menus,  like  "Help",
"Configuration" etc...

* From V1.12 of AMOSPro, INPUT could not be seen from the monitor.

* Doing  a screen close in direct mode on a screen which included an active
dialogue channel, resulted in AMOSPro stuck within an infinite loop.

* Such a line:

Vdialog$(0,1)=Array(a$(1)) 

was  accepted  by  the  test.   This  line  was false, as the Array function
returns an integer (the base of the array) and Vdialog waits for a string.

* Integer multiplication.
From  the  very  start  of AMOS a bug in integer multiplication caused false
results  for certain numbers.  Not very annoying because no one has reported
it in 3 years!



@{b}Bugs fixed in version 1.12@{ub}


* Main instruction set

- =Dev Check function used to return 0 just after opening the device.

- Device instructions now check for the completion of the previous command
before sending a new one.

- Printer device now send its requester to AMOSPro and not the workbench
screen as it used to do.

- The equate system  now  works  fine.  For  more  information on equates,
please run AMOSPro_Productivity1:Equates/Make_Equates.AMOS

- Machine language procedures used to  have difficulty accepting more than
one parameter.

- ERRN now returns the proper error number.

- ERR$ returns the good error message.

- Track Loop On / Off now works

- On Break Proc works.

- LPrint does not leave the printer device open: you can now do an LPrint
  and then a Printer Open.

- The testing process does not report an error with the following line:

  If A$="" And B$="" Then ...

- Mid$, Left$, Right$ as instructions are now corrected. In the previous
version, this program:
A$=String$("a",5)
B$=A$
Left$(A$,1)="b"
Print A$
Print B$
... used to print:
baaaa
baaaa
Now it will print:
baaaa
aaaaa

- =Input$(1,65536) used to crash.

- =Input$() used to mess strings with input longer than 32767 bytes.

- Set Buffer 0 used to crash.


* Monitor

- Now works in interlaced mode.

- Pressing HELP while a program was run used to mess up the system.

- You cannot evaluate any more the command =FSEL$() and any special
functions. They used to cause funny effects!

- Marking an array without marking the indexes used to crash.

- Used to crash when accessing the program slider of a very small listing.

- Expression evaluation problems removed.


* File Selector

- Default name now works.

- The slider used to be badly positioned with a small number of files.


* Editor

- A random line number used to  be  displayed  in the Edit / Direct window
after an error. Stupid bug this one. Sorry.

- Blocks do not include random characters any more.
 
- A program which included extension  commands that weren't available used
to crash.

- The User menu's add and delete options now work fine.

- Autosave sometimes appeared for no reason.

- You can now record a macro over an existing one without crashing.

- You can now remove a keyboard shortcut.

- Shift+Space does not produce a line of garbage any more.

- The Insert / Overwrite button now indicates the current state.


* Direct Mode

- BStart and BLength used to crash

- History buffer system corrected.

- EDIT now works.

- RUN now works.

- CONTROL-C does not crash any more.

- Dialog boxes do not grab all the keyboard inputs anymore.


* Misc.

- Make_Equates.AMOS program is present on the disc.

- Disc Manager disc-copy option now works fine.

- HELP Program now uses the  printer  device instruction to print the help
files and checks for the presence of a printer.

- Object Editor: when grabbing a  bank  from  the current program, the hot
spots are not lost any more.

- Default_Resource.IFF now has the correct colour palette.

- AMOSPro.IFF now has the correct dialog box definition.

- The default font  for  any  AMOS  screen  is  now  Topaz 8, whatever the
default workbench font is.

- EDialog reports the correct number.

- Resource Bank editor: edited messages do not wrap any more.

- Resource Bank editor: you cannot  lose  a bank grabbed from the previous
program, without really wanting to.

- German users, please  note that  it  has always been possible to get the
' (apostrophe) character with your keyboard, by pressing ALT + ä

@node RESOURCE "Resource Bank Maker Enhancements" 

The  resource bank maker has been enhanced and now offers the possibility to
store interface programs within a resource bank.

To reach the new functions of the resource bank maker, just click on the new
button  from  the  main  menu:   'Edit dialog programs' You will enter a new
panel with the list of programs currently present within the resource bank.

The  purpose  of  these new function is to allow you to insert the Interface
programs  within  the middle of a resource bank.  The interface strings will
no  longer  be  required  within your AMOS Program - line like:  "A$=A$+" or
"Data".  The interface program can be edited using any ASCII editor and then
simply loaded into the bank.

* Loading a program:

You can load any ASCII file into the list by clicking on the 'LOAD' button.

* Editing programs:

Edit  your  interface  programs  within  any  ASCII  editor (ED, CygnusED or
others...)  and  then  import  them  into  the Resource_Bank_maker using the
'LOAD' button.

Large Ram or Hard-disk users (only):

It's   possible   to  call  up  any  CLI  Ascii  editor  directly  from  the
Resource_Bank_Maker.AMOS accessory.
	To  Edit an existing program, select it with mouse from the list and
then  click  on the 'Edit' Button.  If you do this when the selected program
is empty, a requester will ask you if you want to create a new one.

The editor called by this button is defined by the varable string 'ED_NAME$'
which  can  be changed by editing the actual Resource bank maker AMOS source
program  file  (around  line  56).   Or  by  clicking on the 'Change Default
Editor' Button.  Be aware that these rules must apply to your editor:

1) The ASCII editor must freeze CLI multitasking during editing. So you
cannot have a 'run' command before the editor's name. With CygnusED you'll
have to add the option '-keepio' to ensure the editor presents itself to you
and not hide in the background.
	Workbench's ED works fine, you might use a line like:

	c:ED {f}

For CygnusED:

	c:CED {f}

2)  The  {f}  parameter  is a dummy filename which your Ascii Editor usually
expects when you request an edit from CLI or Shell.  It carries the dialogue
program  position  within the bank.  When you've finished editing, just save
the  file  and  quit the editor.  You'll then be back in the resource editor
with the Ascii file stored within the bank.

If  the Resource bank maker cannot find the Editor described by ED_NAME$, it
will only display your DBL program using the 'Readtext' AMOS function.


* Copy, Cut, Paste & Rename:

Use  these  buttons  to duplicate, move and rename any Interface programs in
the list.

* Remove unusued characters:

By  clicking  here,  you  can  filter  and  optimise  the currently selected
dialogue  program  in  order  to  save  precious  bytes and speed up (just a
little),  your  AMOS interfaces.  Warning!  Always keep a backup of your DBL
programs  before removing unusued characters.  You'll hardly be ably to read
them  after  they've had spaces removed.  Only perform this operation at the
very end of you interface programming.

* How to access dialogue programs in banks from within AMOS?

This is very simple. Just call your dialogues by:

Resource Bank x  (x = number of the bank where your DBL programs are)
Dialog Open 1,n  (n = number of the DBL program within resource bank x)

This is much better that using:
S$=S$+... (initialising string S$)
S$=S$+...
Dialog Open 1,S$ ( S$ = big string containing your DBL programs)

The initialisation phase will be faster and you'll gain some variable buffer
space!

The other interface instrunctions are working exactly the same way.
(D=Dialog Run(1,label), Vdialog(1,va) and so on...)

@node EXTENSIONS "How to install Compiler and 3D Extensions" 

* Please note: The Compiler extension only works with the old Compiler. Not
  the new AMOS Pro Compiler which is due for release June 1993. You can only
  compile programs that use the old AMOS command set. New commands in AMOS
  Pro must be compiled with the new Compiler.

This disc  includes  special  versions  of  the  AMOS1.3  Compiler  and 3D
extensions that work under AMOSPro.

Warning:   in  order  to  run the Compiler under AMOSPro, you must possess
AMOS  V1.34 and Compiler V1.34 (or over).  If you don't have versions this
high,  order  the  1.34 updates (2 discs) from your usual PD library.  You
can also order the discs from any of the AMOS Clubs.

Any version of 3D can be updated to work under AMOSPro.

The following information is supplied for both Compiler and 3D.  Of course,
if you just own Compiler, skip past information on 3D, and vice-versa.

You just have to follow the  installation procedure, which depends greatly
on your system's configuration.

@node EXFLOPPY "Installing Compiler or 3D without a hard drive." 

Create a working disc containing:

	AMOS1.34, the Compiler and/or 3D extensions installed.

This disc will be used by AMOSPro's new extensions.  3D can then access the
file  "c3D.lib"  from  it,  and Compiler will grab the Compiler and all the
necessary  libraries  from  it.   This  method  leaves  your AMOSPro_System
untouched  and  avoids  having  to  delete files to make room for 3D and/or
Compiler.   In  fact  there  isn't  room  on a floppy disc for AMOSPro, the
Compiler libraries and 3D.

Follow these instructions carefully:

- Boot AMOSPro in the usual manner

-  Load  the  disc  manager  from  the  User  menu  (which now copies discs
properly).

- Now make a backup of your AMOSPro_System disc before beginning.  You must
work  with a backup!

Note:   Once you've installed AMOSPro with new extensions you may find that
AMOSPro  fails to load.  This will be due to AMOSPro being asked to load an
extension  that  just can't be found or isn't compatible with the extension
location  it's  being  loaded  into.  If this were to happen you can easily
revert back to your backup copy and start again.  Otherwise you'll never be
able to get back into AMOSPro. So please take the time to back-up your
original.

-  From  the  Disc Manager open the "Extensions" folder on the root of your
   AMOS Professional Productivity disc 2.

- For the Compiler, copy the file:

  AMOSPro_Productivity2:Extensions/AMOSPro_Compiler.Lib

directly into your APSystem folder of your back-up AMOSPro System disc.

- For 3D, copy the file:

  AMOSPro_Productivity2:Extensions/AMOSPro_3D.Lib

directly into your APSystem folder of your AMOSPro System disc.

It should fit on the disc, but very tightly.  You will need to remove a few
files.   AmigaDos  will  damage  a  disc beyond recognition if it gets over
full, so we suggest that you remove the following file:

  AMOSPro_System:Install_Data/Explosion.Abs

This file contains the installer graphics data for the title.  Removing it
will  not  prevent  the  installer  from working, but will simply skip the
title.

- For the Compiler, copy the file:

  AMOSPro_Productivity2:Extensions/APCmp

directly into your AMOS_System folder  on  your  AMOS 1.34 disc. It should
sit next to "ACmp" the original Compiler for AMOS1.34.

- Quit the Disc Manager and call the Interpreter Configuration accessory.

- Load the default configuration

- Select "Set Loaded Extensions"

-  For  the  Compiler:   click  on  line  number  5,  and enter the
following line EXACTLY as it appears here:

  AMOSPro_Compiler.Lib -fAMOS:AMOS_System/

-  For 3D:  click on line number 4, and enter the following line EXACTLY as
it appears here:

  AMOSPro_3D.Lib -fAMOS:AMOS_System/

- Save the default configuration and quit the program.

-  If  you're installing the Compiler, load "Compiler.AMOS", and change the
line at the beginning of the program.

Original line:

  DPATH$=":AMOS_System"

Change it to:

  DPATH$="AMOS:AMOS_System"

Note:   Ensure  the  disc  with  AMOS1.34,  Compiler1.34 and/or 3D is still
called  "AMOS:".   If  it  has  changed, rename it using the Workbench menu
option.

Save Compiler.AMOS to disc.

- Reboot your computer. AMOSPro should  boot  and load the new extensions.
Check it with the "About New Extensions" menu option.

- Compiler: when you call the Compiler, make sure your AMOS1.34 disc is
 present in a drive. All Compiler data will be loaded from there.

- 3D:  you will be asked to insert your AMOS1.34 disc to load the "c3D.lib"
library.   If you're not short of memory, use the "TD KEEP" command to keep
the 3D library in memory after it has been loaded for the first time.

@node EXHARD "Installing Compiler or 3D with a hard drive" 

-  If  you own AMOS1.34 with the Compiler and 3D, your original AMOS_System
folder should be located at the root of your current partition.  This means
that  both  3D and Compiler extensions when run from AMOSPro can access the
files  by  using  the following pathname:

	":AMOS_System/".

If  your  AMOS_System  folder  is elsewhere on your hard disc then read the
text below located at the (*) marker now.

- Load the Disc Manager utility.

- Open the "Extensions" folder on the root of your AMOS Professional
  Productivity disc 2.

- Copy the files:

  AMOSPro_Productivity2:Extensions/AMOSPro_Compiler.Lib
  AMOSPro_Productivity2:Extensions/AMOSPro_3D.Lib"

directly into your APSystem folder on your hard drive.

- Load the Default Configuration

- Select "Set Loaded Extensions"

- For Compiler click on line number 5, and enter the following line EXACTLY
as it appears here:

  AMOSPro_Compiler.Lib

- For 3D: click on line number 4, and enter the following line EXACTLY as
it appears here:

  AMOSPro_3D.Lib

- Save the default configuration, quit the program and quit AMOSPro.

- Reboot AMOSPro, your new extension  should  be loaded into memory. Check
it with the option "About Loaded Extensions" from the editor menu.

- You can now use 3D and Compiler as normal.

(*) Your AMOS_System folder is not  located  at the root directory

- Write down the FULL, EXACT pathname of your AMOS_System folder.  The name
must  include  the  Device:  and all sub directories.  It should end with a
":" or a "/".

- Proceed as explained  above,  except  when  you  enter  the names of the
extensions in the Interpreter Configuration.

- Enter the name of the extension, followed by "-fpath", where path is the
pathname of your extension. There should not  be any space between "f" and
the pathname.

- Load "Compiler.AMOS", and change the  following line at the beginning of
the program:

 Old line:

  DPATH$=":AMOS_System"

 New line:

  DPATH$="...path of your extensions..."

 Warning, There must not be a "/" character at the end of the path!

 Example:

 * Path to extension: Work:AMOS/AMOS_System/

 * Compiler definition: AMOSPro_Compiler.Lib -fWork:AMOS/AMOS_System/

 * 3D definition: AMOSPro_3D.Lib -fWork:AMOS/AMOS_System/

 * In Compiler.AMOS: DPATH$="Work:AMOS/AMOS_System"

@node EXINFO "Important information about the Compiler" 

This new Compiler extension will  allow  you  to  call AMOS Compiler V1.34
from AMOSPro. This is NOT  the  new  AMOSPro  Compiler which is currently
still under development at this stage (18/01/93). As a consequence:

- The Compiler will only Compile 1.34 compatible programs.  Use the "Check
1.34"  option  from  the  "Project" menu under the editor.  Obviously, the
Compiler  will  not  compile  any  new  instructions, and will refuse bank
numbers over 16.

- If you compile a program as .AMOS type it will only run under AMOS1.34.
This is because AMOS1.34 has different call equates to AMOSPro.

- The configuration files used by  the  Compiler  are not the ones used by
AMOSPro. The Compiler uses:

  AMOS1_3_PAL.ENV (or NTSC) with error messages, or
  RAMOS1_3.ENV without error messages.

You should use your  "Config1_3.AMOS"  program  to  change anything in the
configuration for the Compiler.

          CALLING "INTERPRETER_CONFIG" FROM THE AMOSPRO EDITOR
                     WILL NOT AFFECT THE COMPILER!!!

@node FUTURE "The future updates" 

AMOSPro is no longer supported directly by europress. However, europress
have given their permission for a team of experienced AMOS programmers, led
by Andrew Church to continue to the development of AMOS. I am a member of
this team, and if you have any ideas / bug reports, please feel free to
E-Mail or write to me:

	Paul Hickman
	ph@doc.ic.ac.uk

	23 Adelphi Crescent
	Hayes
	Middx
	
	UB4 8LZ
	England.


Alternatively (And preferably) those with E-Mail should write to:

	team@clare.tased.edu.au

Then it will be distributed to all members of the programming team.	

As for Europress's original updates list:

- AGA Update

    Not in the immediate future.


- Intuition On  /  Off  to  display  an  AMOS  Screen  under intuition and
  therefore create real workbench applications.
- New instructions to handle intuition screens.

    Andy's wrote an intuition extension already - use that!


- More and more integration to the Amiga's system.

    Whatever that means!


- and all your good ideas!

    
The main thrust of our first update will be to fix as many bugs as possible,
not to make any earth shattering improvements...
