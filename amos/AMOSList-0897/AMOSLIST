Hey, its not ALWAYS...   For example, this message will only appear once.
(If this one appears twice, there is something REALLY wierd wrong)
..as to when it does, its due to an inconsistancy in the client/server
software, which I am currently unable to fix without totally rewriting it
and breaking all existing software, which I'd prefer not to do.

Well, as you might have gathered from my rather gloomy message I just
wrote; yes, there is going to be an AGA extension. Yes, it will handle AGA
anims. It has all the commands you'll need plus some cool Stars commands to
keep the legacy alive that every extension must have some starfield
commands. :) It also has online help about all the new commands.

The development is taking a little longer because the programmer is on
vacation, and we are trying to make this thing as good as possible.

And no, the programmer is not Jim Drew, before anyone gets witty. ;)

And one more question; I know that Amos editor don't multitasks, but there is a button named "WB" in the right corner of the editor, when i push that button I come back to the workbench, BUT how do I do to get back to the Amos editor???

Thanks every one! Great Mailinglist!

I hope I get good answers from some Amos Wiz... :-)

didn't like it, don't intend to use it.

It detects the @ character in a line of text, and did checks around it to
make sure it was a legal email address (just looked for spaces), and so was
adding .RemoveThisPart. after each occurence of the @ char!

I have now made a list of illegal characters to check for on either side,
mainly ones used for sig pics etc. Its fixed now.  =)

	Max,
	You are in better shape than you know, the Amos Editor does
multitask, as will all Amos Programs, just hit right-Amiga + a 
to flip between the editor and the desktop.  Also Mushy has a really
great Amos Home-page (the reason I stopped work on mine ;) 
goto
http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk
and look under his tutorials section, I've never tried them but
proportedly there is a really good basic tutorial prog.  you can get
there, it's said to go through lots of the commands with syntax and
examples.  Oh and it sounds like maybe you've got Amos_Pro, if so the
online help which you can access through one of the menus is great, it's
basically the manual with a browser.  As for things being in Swedish, I
can't help you there, maybe somebody else form the list knows of such a
thing. (guys?)  Ah but speakng of Sweden are you by chance a Matts Sundin
fan?

I have the worlds largest AMOS PD library, packed with tonnes of
programs/source/games/utilities that are freely available to anyone. There
are also some tutorials, which will soon be increased if people send me
some they have been working on <hint hint>  ;)

The URL is http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/index.html and the site also has
a massive FTP site linked to it. Please feel free to call in any time.

Simple, hit the left-Amiga key (black A key on left of spacebar) followed
by A and it will take you back. The same method also does the same as the
WB button, to make it easier.

This is an interesting subject, as it will affect all programmers
interested in releasing software.

Whats the best way to cripple a program?

What I mean is, is it best to remove all of the good stuff, or leave all of
it in. What do you and dont cripple.

Ive often discarded software because too much of it is crippled. What are
evryones opinions on this. I'd like everyone to make comment, as to what
you would cripple in a program you would release

Well in StarFighter I crippled the choice of ships which immediately
cuts the game down to 1/7th its potential.  Having a timer is another
one but I don`t like this too much.  Giving the player 1 or 2 levels is
another.  Cutting out abilities like if you have a car racing game,
stopping the player from upgrading is a good one.  The trick is to know
where to stop.  Like if I wanted to I could have released 10 missions in
the demo of SF but it`s giving too much away for free.
Basically stopping the player from seeing too much or getting too far is
the best strategy but it may not apply to all games, as seeing what the
game has might sell it.
If you want the player to see all the good stuff, put a time limit on
it, and disable save options.  If you want the player to taste some
arcade action only give them 2 levels.  But this is all opinion and
sometimes none of this is applicable.  Look at DOOM or TERMINAL
VELOCITY.  Both give you 1/3 of the full game with everything working. 
Still people went out and bought the full game.  I think you have to
implant in the players mind,  "Imagine what it would be like if you
bought the full game".  Use that as a guide, and allow as much as you
can without giving it all away.
Cheers crew :)

Tutorials for AMOS... Wow. That's a toughie. I think the best you can do is
try to get hold of a (old, by now) book outlining the pricinples of standard
BASIC (Qbasic will do nicely). In addition, get the Amiga Game Maker's Manual
by Stephen Hill or Mastering Amiga AMOS by ... (someone :)). Those three
will keep you occupied for a long time, but I admit, it's not for free!

And you have the Mailing list to fall back on in case of trouble, of course..

Good luck!

The DOOM Music extension is a nice extension, but it has some bad points.
One of which, was it kept crashing upon exiting of certain module formats.
I have in fact updated the version in my library some time ago, in fact,
about 4 days after I first got it.

Plus, I dont like the fact that it has to have all the external libraries,
as that is a lot of messing around, especially to someone not at all
familiar with LIBS: and who trys to run a game off floppy who booted from
HD.

I dont hate this extension, in fact what ive seen it is good, but its just
the libraries and the slight crashing that bothers me. It also crashes when
exiting from playing a PSID file too  =(

Wow, thanks for the comments. The examples cover certain topics in AMOS, have
full examples and detailed documentation as you say.

Oh, did I forget to mention I NEED MORE TUTORIALS as the page hasnt been
updated for a while. Did anyone put any cool ones together. Whatever
happened to the Screen FX tutorial someone was doing a while back.

If its the coverdisk version, then there is no online help, it wasnt

thing to have.

Matts Sundin, never heard of him!

Yes, I agree. The whole point, is to intice the player/user into something
spectacular, yet just hold them on that edge which allows then to do the
thing that they wanted the program for most.

Disabling the SAVE option is not always a good thing. For example, this
Bobclip program (of which ive tried to ddownload 5 times and the path is
still bad) has SAVE disabled, so you could in fact grab a nice set of bobs,
and never be able to save them to test them inside your programs. This is
not a good idea, as for all you know, the program could seriously mess up
during saving etc.

Yes, but if you finish the level, you could always have a rolling demo, or
at least screenshots, or just a tiny timer to play for something like 30
seconds. Limiting serious firepower is good in fighting games, as you are
sure as hell not going to get far till you update.

The opinions are good, but like you say, are you giving away too much. I
guess the line between good/crap determined from the amount in crippling,
is totally different in both games and utilities.

I enjoy programming as a hobby, but sometimes, you release a project which
you have put so much work into, and the people want it so badly, that you
would like to be able to make a small pittance from it to repay you for
your hard work and efforts.

I agree. A lot of my old stuff was crap. Still is too, hehe

Just to play levels is not just the way, you should also have some better
playing fuctions in there too, to make the game look a bit better now that
they have registered it.

That is the best thing to do without going too far

I'll support Giark on this one.  Yes, the doom extension is a great one,
which can play loads of lovely formats, *BUT* none (or is it very few) of
the players ALSO support sound effects, rendering the thing useless except
for demos and stuff.

Subject: Fastmem Problem II

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

X-Status: 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
doh! although i'm new to the list i'm not new to amos programming :)

my fastmem question was misunderstood by 99.9% of the people who
replied to me..

i dont want to detect the fastram locations of my memory, but the
fastram locations on any amiga setup with fastram. when a fastram board
is put into an amiga, the memory locations of that fastmem should be
loaded into an absolute memory address somewhere, it's the peek
values of those i need..

there must be a way of determining the start address, and amount of
fastram in any amiga setup?

also, since i sold my fastram about 2 years ago, it makes it even
more difficult for me to look for the address's myself..

hope someone can help me!

Ah, but the P61a replayer which sparked off this discussion is internal, 
so I really dont see why I cannot pack my modules with The Player. Oh, 
and it never crashed on me either.

Subject: fast ram problem
Status: O
X-Status: 

According to the Amiga intern:

The base addres of fast RAM with a 1 megabyte configuration is $07F00000.  As 
memory is added, the base address shifts down accordingly (e.g. $07D00000 with 
4 megabytes).

I was checking out the Amos Pro manual to see if any commands check for 
memory.  On the chapter Memory Banks:

M=Fast Free: Rem gives the amount of available FAST Ram
  Reserve as Work 10,1000
if M<>Fast Free
  Print "The Data has been stored in FAST Ram"
  Print M: Rem printed 80688 (not sure how much fast ram this is?
  List Bank 10 : Rem Showed 10-Work S:$00C7E520 L:1000
else
  Print "Sorry, there is only Chip Ram available"
end if

Well, I guess at least two items of information was given:  
1.  The amount of available fast ram which seems to vary on my system?
     I am not sure what 80688 represents.  Maybe AMOS only recognizes fast     
      ram on a 1 meg machine?
2.  The start address of fast ram which apparently was $00C7E520, however I    
  have only 2 megs added on my system so I do not think the address           
corresponds with the Amiga Intern book.

I admit this is not much help, however I remember someone who seemed to solve 
this problem in AMOS.  His program seemed to check the extra memory on my 
system in the boot portion.  It stated something like this: you have 1 meg, 
wait...you have 2 megs..great! and then loaded the program.

His name is Andrew J. Campbell and his e-mail address is:
ajc@ajco.demon.co.uk

you may recognize his name from the infamous Black Dragon Design produced in 
England.

amount, err, I think it was 'fast free', and address, I'm not sure of. 
Just reserve the amount of space you need in a memory bank and use
start(bank).  Well, thats what I do.  For memory locations, eerrm, well
sysinfo will display them, but thats not very usefull.  Can't find any
usefull information.  Try messign with expansion.library ??

If I remember correctly Mushroom PD has some but in english:

Also the tutorials that come with AMOS should be useful

It does - kind of, Press 'Left Amiga key & a' to flip between WB & AMOS !!

Subject: FAST MEMORY SOLVED!
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hi Mr James Ramsden:

I admit that my ramblings were not too helpful, but I only briefly looked at 
the problem at the time, however I do not think I was too far off base.  
Anyway, I checked out my Mr. Amos MAPP disks and found this nifty program by 
Neil Kennedy who seems to be a pretty good programmer.  By the way, has anyone 
heard anything about my dear friend Brian Bell aka Mr Amos in Ireland, as I 
have not heard from him in about one year.  Sob!

The program is the following:

adress
y_screen=41
do
  if key state(95): rem help
    memories[7]
  end if
  if upper$(Inkey$)="Q":  rem quit
loop

procedure memories[_screen_number]
auto view off
screen open _screen_number,640,16,2,hires
curs off: flash off: colour 1,$FFF: cls
movescreen[_screen_number]
fast$="F"
chip$="C"
repeat
  repeat
  cls
  input "Would you like amt fo chip or fast memory=>";TYPEOFMEM$
  TYPEOFMEM$=Left$(Upper$(TYPEOFMEM$),10
  fix(2)
  until (TYPEOFMEM$=Chip$) or (TYPEOFMEM$=Fast$)
  if TYPEOFMEM$=fast$
     TYPEOFMEM$="FAST"
     MEMLEFT= Fast Free  (See, the command did come in handy)
     MB#=Fast Free
  else TYPEOFMEM$="CHIP"
     MEMLEFT= Chip Free
     MB# = (Chip Free/1024)/1024.0
  end if
  cls
  centre "The # of bytes left in "+TYPEOFMEM$+" mem is "+Str$(MEMLEFT)
  print
  Centre "<press a key>"
  wait key
  cls
  centre "This amounts to "+Str$(MEMLEFT/1024)+"K"
  print
  centre "<press a key>"
  wait key
  cls
  centre "And finally you have "+Str$(MB#)+" MBs left to us."
  print
  centre "<press any key or esc to quit>"
until key state(69)
screen close _screen_number
end proc

procedure adress
  screen open 0,320,256,16,lowres
  curs off: paper 0: cls: hide: flash off
  colour 1,$0
  colour 2,$FFF
  X=75: Y=100
  and it just keeps going on...

When I ran the program, it stated that I had 1016656 fast ram, that this 
amounts to 992 K, and that 1016656.04 MBs was left to use.  Pretty good!  OK, 
I just realized that the program did not state start of address, but it is 
more information than before.  I have to give thanks to Neil Kennedy for the 
work he did on the problem and to Brian Bell for taking the trouble to archive 
the solution.

Come on you AMOS wizards... I really need a call, or routine
to read the mhz speed of any amiga, my software is running
on, can someone find a routine to do this, I don't want a routine
to tell what kind of accelator (I have a routine to do this), I need
one to read and display the actual mhz speed..

Subject: CB_and_Shareware
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

X-Status: 

   Hello.

   Now, after a week "off" from the List-Game, contemplating,
   reading and responding to e-mail and such... I have returned to
   the SideShooter stage.

   The MidBoss part will be so easy, it will only take a few days to
   complete, so the "vacation" should be no problem. Anyway, as I
   said, today I worked on the stage and now have the MidBoss
   floating around, reacting to Bubba's movement, little turrets
   targeting Bubba and firing standard shots...

   Just need to add another intelligence module to handle the
   MidBoss after Bubba has pounded him a bit. He won't like that
   and will move from CasualBattleMode(no problem, this Bubba's
   just a fly...) to SeriousBattleMode(Hmmm... this Bubba-thing is
   actually a threat!! Time to take him out!).

   Complete the MidBoss weapons-control and destruction-
   sequence, and that should about do it.


   Anyway, as I say I have been contemplating a few things,
   and due to Mush's posting, I've decided to share my thoughts...

   Problem I've had this whole project is, how good do we make it?

   Of course, we want to impress people and show what AMOS, and
   more importantly what WE, are capable of... but how much is
   enough...


   Ideally, one would rarely come across a GOOD product in the
   FreeWare PD. For reasonably-priced quality products, you would
   look to Shareware or Licenceware. Unfortunately, this isn't the
   case. This is bad for independant programmers who wish to
   support the Amiga. You SHOULD be able to look at any program
   and easily determine whether it's distributed as FreeWare or not.
   Try it on the Amiga then try it on the IBM.
   

   Don't take this the wrong way, I will certainly finish the
   SideShooter. Just having a bit of a philosophical mood at the
   moment. 

   The bottom-line is that, to my knowledge, we are targeting a
   completely FreeWare PD release with this project, so the quality
   should be set accordingly. Personally, when I set out to do a
   FreeWare PD project (such as TurboInvaders or StarStrike2000),
   I know that I can't make it too good as that would go against the
   very nature of a FreeWare project, "Solid and Simple".


   Is it a good thing to release a Licenceware-quality title as a
   FreeWare title? Personally, I think that although it's great for
   the users, it unbalances the PD/Shareware/Licenceware
   sections of the market. 

   I know this isn't AMOS-specific, but it certainly applies to AMOS
   programmers as much as (perhaps more than) anyone else... I
   think this is an interesting issue and would like to know, what
   are your views on this?
  

   Okay, now that I have that out of the way, I'll get back to work
   on the Side-Shooter...



   Let the flames begin!!



      Take care,

       GARFIELD

It would be nice to test the output at least once though

That's the problem -- you can't have everything :-). If you offer limited
save capabilities, people can and will hack the protection away. There's
no use in writing your own save routine if it's not there...

It sure would! I recently registered for MetalWeb (the new wysiwyg HTML
editor) - I wouldn't have registered if I'd known that the saved files
contained so many bugs! (on the other hand, it's taught me a lot about
HTML, doing this, and the authors have been fixing it regularly, so I'm
not that unhappy!!)

In the end, shareware means "try before you buy". If the user can't try
it, they're unlikely to buy it.

Personally, I think the method of crippling relies on what the program
acutally does...

If your program is a calendar or some-such that needs the clock, give it
a date time out. This is very effective, but (especially with Amigas not
neccesarily having a clock) only if the program relies on the clock.

My favorite (best for a game) is the level-editor idea... The unregistered
version would work fine, but register, and you get a level editor, more
levels, and an updated main program. Also, levels designed with the level
editor could either not work with the unregistered version, or they could
bring up some extra annoying register requesters.

The other idea is to release one game/program, with the register info
telling the user that they will receive another two or three programs
which you might not even have released. A couple of screen shots, and
some descriptive text... if the user likes the first one, they'll want
other software by the same author, so they'll register to get it.

One alternative to crippling that I really *hate* is the idea of doing
something nasty to the system if an unregistered keyfile is found. *Don't*
do it!!! Imagine the user getting a read error on their hard disk that
corrupts the key file...

 Th-th-th-thats all folks!

Yes, but every now and then, it would be nice if you could actually use
some kind of output, like with bobclip, if the actual file you are using is
seriously limited, to say no more than 5 bobs.

I would be very disapointed to buy a program, which when it comes to using
the output, and it was very shobby.

Is there a way to actually get the gadget ID from within the GUI extension?
For example, if I created a gadget named OK and its label was SCR1OK, how
can i read any gadget and get its label?

The reason I want to do this, is so I can make my code recognize labels,
rather than gadget no.s so If i change the GUI gadgets, it wont mess up any
of the code.

I'm working on a more advanced version of my original raycaster.  This 
one, while still build upon squares, has raised ceilings and floors, so 
you can build steps and vents and such.  I was wondering if some people 
out there wouldn't mind running it on their system to see how fast it is.

	Garfield,
	Yup 28 vbl's just to draw the screen one line at a time!
	How crapulent!  However that's using Amos's Draw command
	which is actually slower than my caster will need since it's 
	designed to draw lines of any orientation, whereas all I need
	are straight horizontal lines.  So to get around this problem
	i tried using the Bar command, and low and behold it is faster,
	much faster, it takes about 4 vbls on my system to fill the whole
	screen, so that's 12 fps, still not that good, oh and worse
	yet Turbo doesn't seem to provide any faster comands, it has
	Graphics cursor commands which it claims are more convenient than
	Amos's bar commands, but they don't appear to be any faster.
	Still worse than that Bar and F Bar (the turbo version) can't draw
	single lines, the smallest they'll go is 2x2 so that
	would give my renderer a max resolution of 100 lines,
	not very good.   On the plus side though I've learned to beat 
	Amos's slow array access by simply peeking and poking the values
	directly into memory banks, then I make the 2 dimensional
	arrays use powers of two as there depth, so my recall schemes
	look like this  peek(start_bank+Y*16+X),
	without compiling this method is jsut about even with standard
	Amos array calls, but since the compiler changes that Y*16
	into a bit roll (lsr/lsl) the compiled code is around 30-40%
	Faster.  Plus this method allows me to use the fast Copy command
	to copy chunks of my large Map to the smaller, visible one
	as opposed to some kind of for..next loop to copy array values
	which I'm sure would have been god awful slow..
	So anyway I've still got hold out hope to get this caster going,
	Was wondering if maybe somebody had a Machine code 
	procedure to draw horz lines?  Or maybe knows of faster
	comands/routines, perhaps somehting from Turbo that I missed
	it's supposed to be hyper fast.	
	Well thanks for all the help so far, I just hope there' more to
	come..
			Thanks,
				Scott Matott sXe

Greetings all!

I have a simple problem that I'm sure there is a simple solution to, but I
just can't see it.

Anyway I'm trying to open a text file, load it into a memory bank, alter it
using the ldos 'lreplace, command and save it with a new file name.

If anyone could tell me where my code went wrong I'd appreciate it.

Well, I protected my Lem2LevEd in that way. *But* it won't  do  such  thing
unless  the  keyfile  is  corrupted  *AND*  integrity check inside the main
program is REMOVED. So there's no change of invoking the protection routine

If it is just to display pictures, couldnt you use a small program such as
PPShow, and use AMOS TO BACK. I know its a pain in the arse, but I dont
know of any other way to do it. A lot of hires/HAM screens will LOAD IFF
into AMOS anyhow (one of my old plaques was a HAM pic) and Spack the screen
to a bank, and it should be ok

At least they are doing something about it, but it still would be nice to
be able to see this before hand, so that we dont have to be lumbered with
this.

Thats a good idea. One other way to do something similar, would be to add a
small Patch onto the end of the executable itself (like 10 bytes) and make
your program open itself up, and write over itself with either the current
date of first operation (if you want it to time out), or increment it for
the number of uses. If you add the ten byte bit to the archive itself as
empty figures, noone will know the difference in size!

The time one is OK, and its not always easy to turn the clock back, as a
lot of programs I have come up with all wierd requesters if the clock
suddenly loses a couple of hours.

Good idea, basically piss the user off so much, that they fall on their

One way I do this, is to offer a small discount to users if they have
already registered one of my programs. I also have small snippets or texts
about other programs too.

You would have to be lame to even think this. The most damage I would ever
considering doing, is bringing up an AMOS screen, saying "REGISTER !!" and
have a DO..LOOP so that the user cant break, and turn OS off and
everything, so they have to reboot!  TeeHee!

If i only ever sold 200,000 copies of one of my $10 programs, I certainly

Didn't say it was junk. I said I didn't like it. It serves no purpose for me.

I usually implement a timer. I vary between 15 minutes and 30 minutes,
depending on the program. I don't kill ANY functions, just have the program
shut down after the time runs out. For the average user, that's more than
enough time to test the program out.

For Lunar Conquest, I put a limit on the number of mines and players, but left
all functions intact.

Nah... not that bad :)  The unregistered version would work great. But the
user would register it to get the extra functionality, as opposed to "the
missing functionality". Its the same thing, but the user feels that they're
getting something extra rather than having to pay for the program they've
already got.

I do not remember you "asking" me anything. You told me not to use it, 
solely because you did not like the Doom extension.
I was just asking if Doom could play SFX next to a TP61a module, but it 
does not, so I will not pack my modules. So let us not have an argument 
about this whole thing.

I have a few...

I finally downloaded most of the web page.  What is the Castle Assault program
looking for when it says it can't lock the directory?  I have tried snoop dos,
and tried the files in the program's directory.  I have no graphics files
there though.  Do I need an older demo too?

The side scroller looks good, but why are flames comming out of the bottle
part of the fire extinguisher?  Do you want backgrounds?  If so, what size and
style?

My monitor is not warmed up yet (it takes a while, some day soon it won't) so
I couldn't see much of the knight demo, but the tank style control was kinda
wierd.  I'm sure it will be fine once I get used to it.  Also, I use a CD32
pad, will it use more than one button?  Maybe just for the same moves as the
"move the joystick X and push the button" moves.

About the "protection", I thought it would just be a freebie.  I know alot of
work has gone into this, but wasn't it just to show off AMOS and our
abilities?  God knows I need money, but hardly anyone registers games.  Plus,
wouldn't an unprotected game spread better?  That seemed to be one of the
original goals.  Something about #1 download on Aminet, maybe?  Get some free
coverdisks?

Later,

Schitso

I agree completely. I tried to have a similar kind of scheme on my
homepages a while back, when I used to be working on Extreme AMOS,
informing people on who was doing what projects.

I will post a second mail in a moment announcing a new page I would like to
start on my homepages, with info on currentl projects and info about them,
so as not to cause multi-development etc.

Unfortunately, you are right there.

Is it to syncronise your programs on a faster machine?

Why not just use the Timer function to coordinate stuff, as it will then
stay the same speed on all systems

Im not putting bob clip down, but when you come to think of it, disabling
the SAVE function in a BOB editor is a bit dumb. If it were the case, i'd
load it up, see that no matter how hard I worked on a special bank, I could
never save it, so would delete the program and go looking for something
else which does save.

One way around it would be like I said a while back, limit the program to
just 5 or 10 bobs maximum, and make it so that you cant *load* an existing
bob bank.

Alternatively, you could Tatoo each bob with a small "DEMO" mark when
saving, which means the user has more hassle editing it out to use the bank
properly.

> Anyway I'm trying to open a text file, load it into a memory bank, alter it

Ive looked at your code, and having never tried the LDos extension, the way
you made some code to do a simple task looks rather long and not necessary.

To save a file with a new name:

a$= Original file and path
b$= New Path and name

open in 1,a$:reserve as data 16,lof(1):close:bload a$,start(16)
bsave b$,start(16) to start(16)+length(16):erase 16

To alter your lines and save with new name:

a$= Original text file
b$= New text file

open in 1,a$:open out 2,b$
set input 10,-1

line input #1,tex$

repeat
lp1:
i=instr(tex$," "):rem Look for a Space 
if i>0
   tex2$=mid$(tex$,1,i-1)+","+mid$(tex$,i+1,len(tex$)
   rem Replace it with the ,
   tex=tex2$:goto lp1
endif

print #2,tex$
line input #1,a$
until eof(1)

close 1:close 2

This program will replace all occurences of the space, and replace them
with a comma. This does it constantly till no more occurences can be found
on the line, then goes to the next. The process is repeated till the end of
the input file.

When i offered to sell the game through my First Virtual accounts, I though
the idea was dropped, due to the fact that so many people living in
different countries was a pain.

If you read one of my replies to the Crippling scheme, you will now the
point to this email.

One of the features I would like to restart on my homepages, is like an
index of all the currently under-way projects actively undertaken by
members on the list.

I would like to hear from *Everyone* on the project they are working on,
with a bit of detail about the project, such as when you expect it to be
released, how much it will cost (if its shareware) etc. If you have a piece
of text about it already on a homepage somewhere, Id like the URL too.

Once the current projects are underway, I would like to start on the
Previous Software list, which is a full list of all the old projects done
in the past, which can be looked at by anyone to avoid creating the same
games and utilities over and over again.

Please get back to me about your comments via the list, so we can all share
your comments/critisisms

tha almighty C64! 
Share your knowledge!???

Information wants 2 b free!! have everybody forgot that?!
hope not if thats the case! if it is I will skip the AMiga and go back
once agian 2 the  C64!

Somebody compared Doom with An amos program..That not right because
you can never do so fast texturemaping routins in AMOS!( not even in

I think everbody join this mailing list 2 get helped or 2 get new
insperation 2 do something good and fun! Not 2 talk about how u should
make your program so cracked safe as possible!

And if you do that,,,and your program will do something nasty on their
users system (A trojan horse) its like a virus the program does
something else than its sopose 2 do! Warning the user can get u busted!

Dont b like PeCe people (bill gates) be Amiga people ...help each other!

And if u want 2 earn some money dont take 2 much for your program...I
can say that if its over 10 nobody gonna buy that!! I promise u max

Its easy, you can use the SAM PLAY command, aplong with a channel ID no.
and the sample to generate the channel of the sound.

The codes are:

Channel 1   +1
Channel 2   +2
Channel 3   +4
Channel 4   +8

Sam play 15,1 would play the sample in position 1 through all 4 channels.
Experiment with it, and you'll find left and right speakers. To use other
channels, simply add the values in the + part together

   Personally, I would have no problem with you sending all 
   money generated from the CB sales to Giark. Or keep it yourself
   for handling the sales. UNLESS the project does really well and
   we have all earned AT LEAST a $100 or more. Any less and it
   wouldn't be worth even considering profit-distribution.

   The reason I suggest it be released as a non-Freeware game is
   due to non-monetary reasons.

   The final CB-game should easily be of Licenceware-quality. As I
   said before, releasing a Licenceware-quality game as Freeware
   would do more harm then good. It would simply be one more
   reason for users to NOT register shareware games, purchase
   Licenceware titles, etc.

   I can see MANY users simply waiting, searching Aminet for
   months, for the AMOSList Game#2, rather than registering
   Shareware games or purchasing Licenceware titles.


 
   All I ask, is that you inform us all of how many sales or
   registrations the project made.

   I think we'd all be interested in hearing that!!


   
      Take Care,

   Well, your motivation is commendable... BUT, supplying high-
   quality Freeware is not a good idea, in my opinion.

   Yes, new users (and indeed "old" users) would certainly love 
   this idea, but I believe it would (and does) unbalance the whole
   Freeware/Shareware/Licenceware/Commercial chain.

   I would say the Amiga needs just the opposite of the Freeware
   approach.

   Release only your simpler programs as Freeware. Release your
   higher-quality programs as Shareware or Licenceware and
   your top-notch programs as Shareware or preferrably
   Commercial titles.


>Share your knowledge!???

   I have no problems with this. In fact, I would like to see a
   Developer's Alliance formed. This would simply mean we all
   interact with each other and discuss projects, routines, etc.

   Friendly competition is the key!! All developer's "band together"
   to maximize both the quality of our productions and the amount
   of our profits.

   Mush has started a web-page for something along these lines
   and I urge everyone to support it.


>I think everbody joined this mailing list 2 get help or 2 get new
>inspiration 2 do something good and fun! Not 2 talk about how
>u should make your program as crack-safe as possible!

   I'm certainly not against anyone creating a quality, fun 
   product. All I'm saying is that with a few changes, you would
   have more than just words to inspire you to do it. Money can
   be a darn good inspiration in itself...


>Don't be like PeCe people (bill gates) be Amiga people ...help
>each other!

   Now we get to the part of my reply where I'm probably going
   to say the "wrong" things, but here goes...

   WE DO NEED TO BE LIKE THE IBM-PC PEOPLE...

   The problem with the Amiga is that we were too UNLIKE the IBM-
   PC people in the past.

   It's great to create loads of software and spread them around
   free or almost free, but it destroys the Shareware, Licenceware
   and even Commercial markets.


   I'll do my best to help anybody, but we need to come together
   as developers and help each other:

   We can establish the standards for Freeware/Shareware/
   Licenceware, even Commercial software.

   By never releasing anything above a certain quality as
   Freeware, we have automatically reduced Shareware/
   Licenceware competition tremendously, resulting in an increase
   in the number of Shareware registrations and Licenceware
   purchases.

   We can coordinate our projects to maximize our profits. This
   simply means we discuss our projects to prevent unwanted
   project-duplication within a certain period of time. We can
   also trade our development-tools to prevent the "reinventing
   of the wheel" syndrome. Think about it, how many map-editors
   are available from this list? Yes, I made one too.

   We can set the pricing for Shareware productions. Is it good
   to have one person charging $10 for a program, another 
   charging $15,  yet another $5 for very similiar products?
   In my opinion, this all "breaks-down" the market.

   Most towns and cities have a local business-association which
   allows the independent stores to come together in an attempt
   to maximize profits, reduce competition and consume as many
   boxes of doughnuts and cups of coffee as possible...
   As software developers, we can apply a similiar strategy.



      Take care,

       GARFIELD

If we give all of the stuff for the Amiga away for free, the Amiga would in
fact be digging its own grave. If we give all software away for free, then
noone anywhere would even remotely think of supporting a high-budget Amiga
production, or even buying the Amiga itself for that matter, because it
will know there is absolutely no money to be made anywhere from any of its
software sold. Why budget a game for 30 quid a throw when you can get any
amount of different games for the price of a phone call...

A lot of the software I wanted for my C64 to get it online was shareware.

> Somebody compared Doom with An amos program..That not right because

Everyone on this list knows that. Its not the speed of the routines that
anyone is interested in half the time, its the quality. If you can make a
nice raycaster which isnt as fast as Doom, yet still runsa as well, then
you have beaten the original goal you set out to do. Nothing cant be done
in AMOS or Assembler.

The list does help people with their AMOS troubles. The best solutin to
stop your program being cracked is to simply remove the code from the demo
version, and only get a full version with the full routines compiled. If
you had been reading properly, you will have read the listgame was going to
be PD.

Only badly cracked programs bugger up the system. When released from us,
they work fine, so any tampering done in the future makes us non-liable!

Hmm, now if I sold WB3 for 200 dollars a throw (for our freeware LOADWB
command) then, I would be like Bill Gates.

No matter how well you protect a program, someone will always crack it in
the end. Thats why you only have specialist files, ones with more than one
password which must be entered on running, and also encryption etc.

Uh ?  Thats a failsafe.  You're not supposed to get that happening.  You
should have a directory called 'level2' with lots of stuff in it, including
things like 'wave1.20', 'wave2.20' etc.  This is the directory its looking
for.  It will look in the directory it was launched from, for 'level2', the
directory on my hard disk I'm programming from, and then prompt for the
directory if it's been lost somehow.

Amos is notorious for not giving snoopdos much information on that one.

Personally, there are two options I'd consider.  Being the best PD game ever
(which shouldn't be too hard) and getting absolutely rave reviews in
magazines, promoting amos and our skills, and just looking damn cool, plus
being etched onto CD and hopefully some pictures on the cover..

If thats not the case, a commercial release would be the only other option. 
I'm sure we can find a tame sofware company that will help us out, but it'd
hafta sell pretty big to be worth doing that way, particularly with the
number of people involved.  Well, actually selling at all would be nice.

The third option - shareware.  Well.  Very few people actually register the
stuff anyway, and they need a pretty damn good reason to register.  Again,
it'd have to be large volume to make a difference money wise with the large
group we are in.  If it sells 10000 copies, we each might make a couple
hundred quid.  Can we generate that kind of volume ?

..if it supports proper samples, that'll be great.  Thats my only real
complaint about it.  Which formats currenly (and future) are going to
support sample playing ?  Or is it an extension command for that one ?
Not that I mind really.  Auto channel play, manual channel play, continuous
sample play from h/d in stereo would be nice..  .wav support (ug) 
Retargetable audio....  

cyagain.

Nope. NewIcons. It looks 4 colour to me. The one I use is a 16 colour newicon

I don't think it will be a pain. I'll start compiling a list of those that hve
contributed enough to merit payment and we can charge $1 per each person
involved, so you can just send $1 from each sale to each party, maybe
quarterly or something. Sound fair?

Good enough. It was just one of those times when the project could get
sidetracked if I had let everyone talk about it forever. We'll do what we can
to protect EVERYONE's contributions from ripoff artists.

	Just to bust Mush's chops on this one (I still can't believe he
didn't know who Matts Sundin was)  Doom could run like a deer on a 4 meg
486 dx/2 66mhz, which is infact a speed miracle and true testment to ID's
genuis (if you want proof check out it's numerous slower imitations) 
Infact it's even better than this because doom flies on the 040 NeXT's it
was built on.  Well this is all fine and good, but considering that the
average Amiga sports an 030 at best, and that even the fastest 060's are
only clocked at 60 mhz if your raycaster isn't faster than Doom it ain't
gonna run!  Of course the solution to this dilemia is to cut back on the
complexity of your caster, ever wonder why so many of those Amiga Doom
clones where based on square maps?  Trust me, not everything can be done
pn an Amiga, let alone in Amos.

Hopefully. I have the procedure up to read any controller and allow for 11
buttons.

Yes, but some programmers seem to think that freeware means `don't make it as
good as you could'. We will distribute a freeware version, perhaps with a
timer or some other limiting factor. If no one registers, we'll release the
full game as freeware. I've also started working on a cheat code system that
will let you get max firepower, shield, etc. that we can `leak' to get more
interest in the game.

Hello to everyone on list. This is my first posting to AMOS list, I beg your
pardon for my poor english, I'm italian.
 
If people would pay to use program there were be no piracy, and relase
crippled proggy will be stupid, but it isn't so.

Many years ago (it was 1990' end) I made a lot of anim for a friend of mine,
who is a photographer. Few month later, I start to write a program which help
me to realize anim. At beginning it had few effect and too much bugs, but it
was usefull  and easy.

Soon I had selled a copy to another photographer, and I thought I will sell
more copies and make a lot of money, but few days after many photographers had
yet a pirated copy, there were no  copy protection, and I get no money any
more! So I had decided to expand but to not release :-(

In 1995, I had changed idea, and had released a new version as shareware. It
wasn't crippled but has a requester, which on every saving will stop program
for max 2 minutes. Program was usable, but when you try make an usable anim
you lost a lot of time, so if you need it to do anim you must pay. I had sent
a demo disk to Italian Amiga Magazines and to many people, who asked for a
demo version. Magazines had spoken well about it, but user say they couldn't
try it becouse requester slow it too much. Then I introduced credits, which
disable pause on demo version until you have them, but on every launch they
decrese. Until
today I had got only 7 registration, do you think other people don't use it?
To get new credits it is simple, you must reinstall it, it is nasty but it is
free :-(

Now it work only for 30 minutes and save only first 15 frame, and when you get
"key", it works only on your machine, and if you add/remove/change hardware
you need a new "key", it is nasty but you don't change your hardware config
everyday.  =) 

Nuturally if you upgrades your machine you will get a new and free "key" 
only if you call me and say what you had changed. :-)

I think this way of crippling is good enough.

    ANNOUNCEMENT - Mushroom PD now plans to sell the AMOSPro Compiler
HOMEPAGE CHANGES - Exciting new services available on the MPD Homepages
NEW PROJECT PAGE - Information on current projects in the AMOS Community

        FAREWELL - Well, tatty byes for this issue!

INTRODUCTION
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

First of all, i would like to say a great big thank-you to all who have
visited my pages last month, as in total, there were over 7500 hits to the
site. This also resulted in some 300 extra people signing up to the MPD
mailinglist itself this month alone, which has kept me busy trying to
update my lists and distribute all the email orders at the same time. If
you haven't received what you ordered yet, then please be patient as things
can be a little busy here at times!

I would also like to say thanks to all those who have been using my FTP
site after last months announcement. Can I please stress that uploads
should go to the /pub/amos/incoming/ drawer only, and must accompany a
.Readme file (.Rea is ok for PC users) other wise the files will be deleted
automatically by my AMOS program. If you encounter any errors in the
library, or if you are experiencing problems, then email me at
mushypd@redrose.net immediately. Alternatively, you can simply Email me the
archives and readme files, I have no restrictions on my email account so
files of any size are welcome.

Congratulations to Steve Bailey, Robert Benjamin, and Ian Hewitt for having
AMOS games printed in the Reader Games section of the June Amiga Format.
Sorry if these issues are a little old, but over here in the states they
tend to come in a little later than released.

Another big thank-you to Mike Dissinger, of TUSK BBS (who I meet with every
saturday, and a few other Amiga fans) for adding an AMOS drawer to his BBS
drawer, of which seems to be very popular.

ANNOUNCEMENT
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Mushroom PD has been given the go-ahead to start selling the AMOSPro
Compiler V2.00, along with the updater disk etc. Hopefully, this shall
begin to move by the end of August, and as soon as details are released, I
shall place them up on my homepages. The program will retail at around 25
dollars, although it will more than likely be less, but until I get nearer
the date I wont know this for sure.

Rumours also arise that I can get hold of AMOSPro V2 itself. This is true,
and although I cant get a hold of it at this very moment, my contact
assures me it will be available soon!

HOMEPAGE CHANGES
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Not been too many changes to the way the homepages work this time, although
one big one is explained more further down this document.

One of the bigger changes I have made to the system is to make it more FTP
site alert. On each of the order pages, I have made a small banner which is
displayed on the top of the page, and draws the image file from the FTP
site, and if it is active, will display the banner. This also lets you
click on the banner and go straight to the FTP location in the browser, so
you can see the lists directly.

If you have any other ideas on how I could improve the pages, then please
dont hesitate to contact me at mushypd@redrose.net

NEW PROJECT PAGE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Due to several comments on the AMOS mailinglist, I shall be restarting my
pages up again, which detail the current projects being undertaken in AMOS.
I used to do this a long time ago, but noone would send me any information
and so they got badly out of date, due to the fact that I wasnt online and
was doing the system through my disk magazine.

The first of the pages will hopefully be uploaded within a weeks time, and
I urge all AMOS coders to get in touch with me about their current
projects, with info on the name, a brief description of the project, how
much it will cost (if its shareware) and when a demo and full version will
be released and where it can be obtained. I hope to keep these pages
completely up to date, to avoid 2 people clashing on the same project.

Once the current projects list is compiled, then I will begin working on a
list of older games and utilities written.

RECENT LIST

The newest AMOS extension on the block is the "NO KIDS" extension, which
offers a lot of extremely usefull commands, including several ultra-quick
sorting commands for large lists etc. Definately worth looking at.

The FX demo also shows off some good AMOS routines. Written by Dr. Fonk,
who is very good at doing on-screen FX, shows off some of his code here,
including a very good "Pepsi-scroll", which is a bit unusual for a
scroller, but very very well done.

Bethzoo is a nice program for all those younger people (if anyone has young
kids, its very good for them to see) in which you go into a Virtual zoo,
and are able to interact with the animals, and hear various sounds.

FAREWELL
--------
    Well, that just about covers it for this email. If you have any AMOS
material which isnt here, please upload it to the FTP site in
/pub/amos/incoming so I can add it as soon as possible.

    Thank-you for reading.

Yes, I agree... it is kind of dumb, but I was thinking if I had no save
function then no one could ever crack it to enable the save function.......

Actually, I have been thinking about theese two options myself, and I might
just make a combination of both... How about that?

Well, if anyone is interested in seeing the output that BobClip generates,
please tell me and I'll make the changes so that you can save (limited
though)!

Ok.... These are what I'm working on now:
PipingHot - a clone of PipeMania hopefully with 2 mouse-operated players,
(once I get registered for Amcaf), and a few other interesting features.
HAL9001 - my attempt at some sort of artificial intelegence. sort of :)

Releases dates? (I was never much good at this :)
Problem 1: A couple of weeks ago, I managed to screw up my copy of Amos,
(by selecting the main Amos executable in a "Save As" file requester - doh!)
so until I can get that sorted, all projects are "on hold"... :((
Problem 2: I can't find my original Amos Pro main disk (I got the compiler
disk, and the accessories disk, and..and..and, but do you think I can find
the one I need?) :(((
But: PipingHot is looking pretty good. I need to get the 2 player thing
sorted out, and a better front end (start screen, hi-score, etc). Give it
a month (I do have other things on the go!) from when I get Amos running
again here.
HAL9001: Is just about finished. But it doesn't really do very much :-}
It accepts sentences as input, works out (or asks) what words are nouns,
verbs, etc, and outputs (pretty random) sentences based on words from it's
dictionary. It sounds really neat when you tell it to say everything it
outputs :)) It's finished, as far as I'm concerned, but not compiled, so
I'll release it as soon as I get Amos sorted out.

ULR.... Well, I'm right now in the process of creating my web page. I
hope to have it on-line as soon as possible - hopefully by this weekend.
When it's done, the ULR will be <http://village.vossnet.co.uk/c/champion>.
It isn't there yet, so don't even try it. I'll post a message here when
it's there (although a lot of it isn't Amos related).

This is a good idea :)

>Please get back to me about your comments via the list, so we can all share
>your comments/critisisms

Ok. I'll send this to the list. You should be reading it from there...
(I wasn't going to admit to doing such a stupid thing to my copy of Amos
to everyone on the list, but I guess it's done now... :)

This idea of yours sounds like it could be a good thing. I'll still be
visiting other "ideas" sites on the web for my inspiration, but this will
definitely be another one for my bookmarks :)

Best wishes :))

Hi Dave!

I'm the author of a new music extension called DME. It's available on
Mush's homepage.
At this time Med VUmeter function is not included in DME V1.1, but the
next version
will coming soon. The new version will support following things:

	- added VUmeter for Med,Octamed,Octamix,THX and ScreamTracker	
	- Sample playing (SFX) support, at time only for some formats
	  e.g. for all the game coders (Hi Mr. Giark)
	- new Soundformat: FastTracker I + II


Best regards

(I've cut out some lines with just one word on them in order to keep the
chunks of comments visible.)

I agree. It is nowadays impossible to make everything freeware unless you
have a widely installed hardware base (like Linux, which is close to this
ideal.) Apart from that, writing good software takes time, lots of time. Many
of us on this list know this from (bitter??) experience. Some people believe
enough in a concept to stop working for months to shape their ideas into
programs (Yvon Rozijn, author of AWeb for instance). Even on a platform
as the Amiga. Those guys and girls deserve the efforts they put into the
program -- if you think it's good enough. If not, quit whining, or look for
something better, or buy a PC, where you can rip things off even more easily.
I sincerely believe that a large portion of the SoHo packages are either
copied illegally or have been taken home from work as an extension of the
license agreement. And if you _do_ want to play fair on a PC, you'd better
have a very big wallet. I've seen terminal emulators which make Term look
close to being something from an terribly advanced civilization, and people
would ask 100 US$ for such crap.

Besides, Stallman's argument is a fallacy. Programs are not information at
all. Programs are tools to manipulate information. And I think it's comple-
tely logical to pay for such tools -- once again, if you think they're good
enough.

I sincerely hope that I will once see the time in IT and CS when people stop
seeing `pure assembly' as something god-like. Nowadays, optimising compilers
do a really good job of producing good, fast code. The extra 5% in speed loss
I'll gladly trade for the much smaller effort gone into writing and maintaining
a program.

And yes, it's the idea that counts... But you can't ignore the fact that some-
times a little speed would not be _too_ much to ask for :-).

Which is a very fun subject as well. In the end pointless, of course, but
some of the techniques are really quite clever and teach you a lot about
programming in general.

It would be suicide to write something like this. Apart from that it is
illegal as hell: I'm not a lawyer, but I think you would find it not too
hard to get someone to sew the programmer for inflicting damage on purpose.

PC-people are in the majority of cases so utterly ignorant of what is going
on inside their computer that the average Amiga owner seems brilliant in
comparison. Apart from that, Amiga-owners are in my opinion amongst the
most helpful class of computer owners that I know of.

And besides, if a program is not worth anymore than $10, it's in most cases
too much trouble to register anyway. I have to pay the same amount of money
to get those 10 bucks to the other party. There will indeed always be 
dark elements who will see it their `justifiable right' to make sure that
`information stays free'. 
Fortunately, in most cases those guys
running Elite BBS'es are far too proud of their miserable efforts to let
other people use those cracked programs. I think it would make a worthwile
punishment to force _them_ to write, market and sustain a program for
awhile.

Back to AMOS. Has anybody tried to run AMOS on a 31 kHz+ monitor using
phase 5's Scandoubler or the Picasso IV gfx card? Any glitches/anomalities?

Subject: OK FAST MEM NOT SOLVED
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hi Sam Becket,

Well, you are right.  The program by Neil Kennedy was just a demo program.  He 
stated at the beginning of the listing that he needed a program to see if a 
computer was more than a 1 meg machine.  I suppose this type of program 
depends on what you wish to accomplish.  However, I do think it is an 
important question, as it pretty much relates to my question about doing 
without double buffer in order to save available memory.

Anyway, I tested FAST FREE on a 1 meg machine.  Apparently, I discovered that 
my 1.3 OS used 153,288 K of memory leaving 895,288 free memory.  After loading 
AMOS PRO, there was 392,560 free memory.  I guess AMOS PRO uses 502,965 K of 
which lets say 25,000 K is reserved for text (out of FAST RAM).  The more text 
space reserved the less FAST FREE.

For a compiled program, AMOS sys & libs consumes around 80 K of disk space, so 
I suppose there would be even more FAST RAM left.  At this point, I have no 
idea how large your program is going to be.  I suppose that 8 disks could 
potentially consume 8 MB of ram.

Anyway, getting back to the 1 meg machine.  There was 0 or zero FAST MEM and 
402,704 for CHIP MEM.  As far as I can tell, there is no FAST MEM on a 1 meg 
machine as far as AMOS is concerned.  Therefore,

If FAST FREE = 0, then load only one disk program.

My system is actually a 3 meg machine, however after loading the OS & AMOS, it 
has only 2,333,048 FREE MEM left.  Apparently my system uses 812,680 which 
probably includes OS and peripherals.  When I test CHIP FREE the amount was 
increased from 402,704 to 813,680 out of the total FREE MEM available!  I 
figured that CHIP FREE was just using all available memory for a 1 meg machine 
which would be about 813,680 + 153,288 for the OS.  Anyway that is my guess.  
Anyway, on my system, I figure that I could load potentially a 2 disk program 
(maybe 3).

If FAST FREE <= 700,000 then load 1 disk
if FAST FREE > 700,000 and <= 1,400,000 then load 2 disks
if FAST FREE >1,400,000 <= 2,100,000 then load 3 disks

Does anyone have a better way to do this?  Damn, I just realized that this 
does have to be done in the startup sequence, before loading the AMOS 
program!!  I think I having doing this all back-arse-wards!  Am I wrong here?

Yes, but if say tomorrow the author fixed that problem, would I then be
allowed to use TP?? No, I did not think so.

But anyway, I will not use TP. I do not want to fight about it either, I
want everyone to be happy :)

Yeah, sounds fair enough. The good thing about FV is that I just upload all
of the things I want to sell to my "Shop" and they handle it automatically.

The way I would like to write a small executable program which gets shipped
with the demo version of the program, which handles the process of
registering, and although the credit card transaction goes through first
virtual, I am the one who sends the archive, so I know who I am sending it
to. Does that sound OK to everyone? Its cheaper for me this way, as they
charge me $1.50 a month for shop rent per Mb of info, hehe.

If noone has any problems, I would like to sell the game as licenseware
from my homepages, as like an exclusive licenseware title.

I couldnt agree with you more. My wife has a PC (I had to use it before I
got my Amiga back online) and altogether she had spent several hundered
dollars on various bits of software for it.

When I showed her I could get stuff twice as good, and at a much better
discount, even though the software I had was shareware and restricted, it
was sure as hell better and cheaper than anything a PC could offer.

If you cant handle the shareware scene, then you should turn towards the
PC, because they have either ridiculous priced software, or you write
something, and they rip it off and sell it for an even higher price!

Exactly. You should reward the programmer for their efforts, not just walk
over them. Having the "I dont care who whatever is from" attitude could end
up with you getting hold of some crap software, which could totally bugger
up your system.

Yeah, ever been on IRC with a missing DLL file and had a friendly PC user
DCC it to you? Never in my lifetime...

Cracking an AMOS program itself is quite an accomplishment, even if it was
you who wrote the program. I should imagine its very difficult to find the
part where the program keeps the Source, and also to edit the checksum
flags. Great task to anyone if they can fix it.

Yes, get right on it! Send me any demo versions to the library!

Because that's the most it could handle, and all traditional 
Wolfenstein-ish raycasters are grid-based (usually 64x64). Anything 
higher than that is a step up to sectors and CSG, ala Duke Nukem.

> Trust me, not everything can be done pn an Amiga, let alone in Amos.
Yeah? Says who? I'm coding mine in Amos and it's going fine. The 
Amiga, computation-wise, may NOT be able to comptete with a PC when 
it comes to complex raycasters, but hey, I don't really care. It's 
the fact that you pump all you can into it and utilize the full 
potential of the computer itself. I don't let that get in my way.

The reason I'm doing my raycaster in Amos AND on the Amiga is that I 
grew up on Amigas, I prefer AMOS WAY over C or C++, and also to show 
what can be done on an Amiga using a program like this.

Also, if everything can't be so-called done in AMOS or on the Amiga, 
why are you writing your raycaster in Amos, hmm? hehe, just kidding 
on that one, but it is an interesting point.

Greetings.

Well, while you fellows have been sitting here arguing and hacking it 
out over shareware, debating, I've been programming, and am pleased 
to announce that a fully functional demo and screenshots of the Cafe 
engine ITSELF (not the level just yet, I have to go in and chop some 
off of the engine itself and then add a level or two w/textures) 
within the weekend. The demo will probably be like Keith's first 
demo, just some sample enemies and the such, a small map, nothing 
elaborate, as I have yet to actually sit down and do that yet.

Anyhow, it's looking pretty good, as I had planned to have a demo out 
by last weekend but I erased my DH0 partition by accident, remember? 
(hehe, how convient?).

Again, thanks for the patient everyone (especially Giark).

Btw, I also wanted everyone to know that I'm starting back to school 
(more studies, yippee) in about 2 weeks, so I may not have as much 
time to program (I'm trying to pump as much as I can now while I have 
the chance), so, bear with me a bit when I do.

I also plan to update all of my pages (and finishing the unfinished 
ones I haven't done yet as I've been to busy to do, haven't had 
time). I'm ALSO deleting and/or removing the Eventuator project (it 
is no longer, I'm packing it away). In it's place (instead), I have 
an old project I thought up way back when I thought about doing a 3D 
game that will be replacing it, up and going when I finish my level.

Hia! I'm using a PicassoIV, but using a regular CBM 1942 monitor (31khz?)
I've not noticed any problems running either Amos Pro or Amos programs.

The one thing that PicassoIV does seem to do (which is probably more to
do with my setup than anything else!) is that all the screen modes are
different physical sizes on the screen, so that whenever I run a program
(like an Amos program) that opens a PAL screen, I have to adjust my
screen's horizontal position and vertical size before I can see the
whole picture. This applies to all PAL modes (low or hires, laced or not).

All in all, though, this doesn't make my life difficult :)  and I can still
run most (all?) programs.

I know I'm not involved in the project, but when I write a program, I do so
because I want to. I think about whether it's worth shareware after I've
finished writing it. I would never write a program with a market (ie freeware
or shareware) in mind before I start.

>If no one registers, we'll release the full game as freeware.

That would be very sad.
I've not seen any demos or anything yet, but if it's as good as it sounds
from the discussion on this list, then I'm sure you will get registrations.

>I've also started working on a cheat code system that will let you get max
>firepower, shield, etc. that we can `leak' to get more interest in the game.

Now this is a good idea.  :)
Have there been any other shareware games that have taken this approach? (I
don't mean just having codes, but 'leak'ing them as well)

That's my say!

Ive been working on my Mailinglist manager, and I now have a small "Rolling
Demo" available.

Basically, its just the GUI with a few AMOS commands attached to the
buttons to bring up the various different GUI bars. I have tested it on an
A1200, with a Blizzard 1220, and want to know if it is compatible with
other systems, mainly 030+

Please email me if you want me to send a copy

Good. It'lll keep the price reasonable and let us get a bit of cash for our
efforts.

Go for it. Also, there is the promotional stuff dir for any ads or whatever
that anyone wants to put in.

Why worry about that? Our copy protection will be non-existant. If someone is
going to crack the program, there's not much that can be done. The honest
users will register anyway.

This makes for headaches when selling the program. As I said in another
message, if no one bothers to register (we have failed in our ad campaign!)
then we'll release it as freeware. But why not at least try to get some cash
for our efforts first?

Hi,

 First Id like everyone to check out the new demo of pang (Ive got NO replys
on this)

Also Id like to thank Kieth & Pietro for there comments on the old version of
pang

I know that some people had problems with the old version but the new version
is in lha, runs properly, is much smoother, has less bugs, no 'file not exe'
error, & more stuff ,DOWNLOAD IT !!!!


I remember Kieth asking for bouncing bubbles - should they bounce off all
the edges of the screen ?

Could someone send in there comments on pang ?

The next demo of pang will be much better but without comments how can you
expect loads of improvements?

It has been a while since Ive checked the beta testers list but the ONLY
people who I remember sending comments on any of the levels were: Me,
Murry(on holidays now), Kieth, Garfield & brother,& a few others -
I KNOW there are more beta testers - what are they doing - testing Isnt useful
without telling the author about the game


SOME REPLYS ON PANG PLEASE!

seeya,

Well, I still would like the modules to be packed, I mean, it would be 
in everyones interest. (modules smaller -> more room for coders to do 
other exciting things) But it cannot play SFX so this whole argument is 
void :)

Anwyay, the modules wont be that big anyway.

   Try storing your random values in an array first.  Then they'll be
available whenever you need them.

	Murray,
	Why not just stick the first values in an array?  Of course, as
I've just rather painfully learned Amos Arrays are none too speed, but
still I don't think the Rnd command is either. 

			Thanks,

Subject: AMIGA games
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Status: O
X-Status: 

This is quite long, but there is a point at the end of it...

I don't want any of the many people writing 3D engines to go mad at this but I sometimes wonder 
what people want from games.

I remember the good old days.... :)
when games like Turrican II and Kick Off II were around.
Super smooth, super playable and just plain brilliant. These are the sorts of games that if you 
play them on a PC, they just aren't as good. Technically, they may have more colours or more 
fancy effects (normally a CD video intro... wow!) but as for the game, its just not the same.

And its the same the other way around. PCs have good 3D games, although personally I only really 
like Doom and Duke Nukem, Quake is too... I don't know but it seems to lose some gameplay to me.
You play the AMIGA clones and they lose something too.
Gloom was quite playable and before Duke Nukem (which I think is super-playable) I would have 
said it could almost stand up to the PC stuff (for playability).

Why is it that all new games try so hard to be like PC games?
When you compare brand new A1200 games to A500 games of 4 years ago, the old games always win!

Fancy 3D, super effects etc. attract all the 12 old little kids who just want to show off to 
their friends but for the rest of us, we want a captivating, PLAYABLE game that is long lasting.

Now the Amiga can't do all those fancy effects as good as the consoles/pc's (at least not with 
the current standard setup) so surely we should all aim for the playable side? Oh, and playeble 
doesn't mean small either.
Some people, if they were told to make a playable game, would make a Tetris clone. Big, 
complicated games can be playable too.

What every struggling computer needs is a game that is unlike anything on any other computer.
It doesn't need to be completely original. In fact, I think that the best way to do it would be 
to take an old concept except with a new twist and just keep adding little details until you get 
a game that everytime you play it, something new happens.

Basically, thats what I try to do with alot of my games that I make. (not all, addmittedly)
My games Kill Em All and Hanger 18 are just a simple walk and shoot on the outside, but then you 
take into account the AI and the fact that you have characters that actively help you and an 
intirely new twist is created allowing scope for all sorts of new interesting features.
Of course, I'm just one person doing this, so they can't reach their full potential but its still 
there.

Anyway.... my point is, I think a list game could make a difference with Amiga gaming.
Some people have said, be realistic, an AMOS game could never be spectacular enough to do this, 
but what I've been trying :) to say is that if you come up with the right idea. One that can be 
done on AMOS (i.e. doesn't need to be super fast/super smooth - it's only limitation in my view) 
and one that is suited for the AMIGA with all its custom hardware (i.e. 2D!!!!) then you have a 
winner.
For the last list game, when people were contributing ideas, almost everyone just quoted another 
game! Whats the point in a remake unless you add something new and great?
As for the current list game, I think it will do very well indeed. But not commercially.

The 2nd list game (the Command and Conquer one) appears to have got no where and I'm not sure 
that it is actually going to be original in the slightest (but I could be wrong)

Look at some of the most popular past amiga games and come up with some great new way of doing 
it.
Syndicate, Civilization (Civ 2 on the PC is in my opininion the best PC game ever), Chaos Engine, 
 Flashback, IK+, Space Hulk. Theres a few to think about.

Flashback and Space Hulk especially could be EASILY done on AMOS with no speed problems. (I 
started a version of Flashback myself which ran at perfect speed).
Space Hulk was amazingly atmospheric. One of the few games that can actually induce panic as you 
race to save the marines once you realise an alien has broken through.

Anyway I've talked FAR too much. (I'm a bit bored really) :)

Summary:
1. Make games that the Amiga is good it.
2. Make games that AMOS can handle.
3. Make games that have some twist never done before (I know they are hard to think of, but they 
are worth it)
4. Make it an AMOS list game? (and this time, pass the code around so everyone can optimise it)

Does anyone know if you can reproduce Rnd or Qrnd (AMCAF) outputs?

e.g.

---some command here---

For N=1 to 3
Print Rnd(10)
Next N

---some command here---

For N=1 to 3
Print Rnd(10)
Next N

So that the 2nd three random numbers are the same as the first three.
I thought that if I put Randomize 1 (or whatever) in front of both of the loops, it would work, 
but it doesn't...

Anyway, any ideas?

Thanks,

Not sure about QRnd, but to get Rnd to obey the Randomize
command you have to use -ve numbers in the Rnd call.

i.e.

Randomize 42
For N=1 to 3
Print Rnd(-10)
Next N

will *always* give you the same 3 numbers.

I'd thought of that put the thing is I need all sorts of different arrays for different rnd(n) 
values.
i.e. some calls are Rnd(10) some are Rnd(100) and some are virtually any number in between.

   Hello.

   I too would recommend using a Rnd-Table .

   If you only need values between 0 and 100 then it would only
   take a few hundred bytes (depending on how long you want
   to go before the random-cycle repeats) to set-up the Rnd-
   table.

   Now, you can either set up a slower, general-purpose routine...

   Dim RANDTABLE(100)
   For REP=0 to 100
      RANDTABLE(REP)=Rnd(100)
   Next REP 

   ' Initialize the RAND-Pointer
   RANDPOS=0 

   GENRAND:
   RVALUE=RANDTABLE(RANDPOS)
   If RVALUE>RANDMAX Then RVALUE=RVALUE Mod RANDMAX
   Add RANDPOS,1,0 To 100
   Return

   Simply load RANDMAX and call the routine. RVALUE will return a
   value from 0 to RANDMAX

   
   Or, you can create faster routines by simply precalculating 
   several RndTables and writing more dedicated code.

   Dim RAND10TABLE(10),RAND100TABLE(100)
   For REP=0 To 10
      RAND10TABLE(REP)=Rnd(10)
   Next REP
   For REP=0 To 100
      RAND100TABLE(REP)=Rnd(100)
   Next REP

   RAND100POS=0 : RAND10POS=0

   RAND100:
   RVALUE=RAND100TABLE(RAND100POS)
   Add RAND100POS,1,0 To 100
   Return

   RAND10:
   RVALUE=RAND10TABLE(RAND10POS)
   Add RAND10POS,1,0 To 10
   Return


   As Scott mentioned, accessing AMOS arrays is a bit slow. By 
   switching from arrays to Bank-access, you can speed up the
   RndCalls 30% or more and reduce the memory-requirements to
   half as you can Doke and Deek 2-byte values for each of the
   Random values, where AMOS uses long-words (4 bytes) for
   all variables and arrays...



      Take Care,

       GARFIELD

   I can't really speak for the people working on the 3D-engines,
   but I assume they are doing it to gain experience. It's always
   valuable to tackle new projects/technology. One thing I've
   found with programming is that the more you learn to do, the
   more you can learn to do. It seems to be an on-going process
   with no end...

   Small games can be very playable. Of course a game does not
   need to be small to be playable, but many times a single 
   programmer wants to make a playable game in a short period
   of time, so they decide to do a simple game...

   Personally, I believe we are even beyond this point. Problem
   with the "great game sells a system" approach is that the
   Amiga is not considered a stable market. Perhaps now it is more
   stable than in previous years, but look at what happened with
   Worms. Didn't necessarily sell Amigas, did it? No, what happens
   is that every great Amiga game will be ported to IBM & consoles.

   We need to actually rebuild the Amiga market from scratch...

   Well, I agree with this! First, we can make a difference by
   "banding together". Second, it's just common sense to choose
   a project that's within the reach of your development-
   language.

   Actually, Warcraft is a good choice for AMOS. I'm not against
   making a "complex" game and would be glad to work on a
   Warcraft-style game with other Listers. My point was that we
   should pick a simpler project TO GAIN EXPERIENCE WORKING
   TOGETHER, not because I (or anyone else on this list) wasn't
   capable of creating a more "complex" game...

   IF the Warcraft List-game is not progressing it's probably due to
   determining how everyone will work together. Something I tried
   to explain before... DO A SIMPLER PROJECT FIRST WITH THE SOLE-
   PURPOSE BEING TO WORK OUT THE BEST GROUP-DEVELOPMENT
   METHODS... Once you have that down, the sky's the limit!!
 

>As for the current list game, I think it will do very well indeed.
>But not commercially.

   The current plan is for it to be released as Licenceware and this
   is very good. First, it stimulates the market (shows there's
   actually life outside Freeware). Second, it helps define the
   standards for non-Freeware projects and hopefully other
   developers will "follow suit" and only release their simpler/
   lower quality projects as Freeware.

   When you see a very simple Freeware game don't think "what
   rubbish!", instead think "GREAT!! Finally Amiga Freeware is
   becoming what it should have been all along. Now Shareware
   and Licenceware can easily stand out and users can see why it's
   worth registering their Shareware programs!!!!"


>Summary:
>1. Make games that the Amiga is good at.
>2. Make games that AMOS can handle.
>3. Make games that have some twist never done before

   All good, solid, common-sense! I agree completely.


>4. Make it an AMOS list game? (and this time, pass the code
>   around so everyone can optimise it)

   Well, we are working on a unique AMOS List game at the moment.
   I'm sure all the code will be highly-optimized. I haven't done any
   code-opts yet, but when I am finished I will. I would be very
   surprised if anyone could optimize any more then it will be.

   Of course, if anyone wanted to replace the SLOOOOOW AMOS
   Bobs with some fast extension (PowerBobs?), that would
   certainly help...
    


      Take Care,

Ehm, not to be too troublesome, but I do not want any money for my
contribution to the CB game. It would be against the principles of TRS
who strive to help people for no cost (unless it is for a commercial
full-priced game ofcourse published by a "real" software house).

Just an add with the program and my name on the credits list is payment
enough for me.

One other thing you could do is to encode the name of the person who
bought the original within the program. This way you can at least see
who the culprit is and maybe take legal action / in any case not give
him support or future releases.

All,

Hi, I've been away from the Amiga scene, and AMOS, for a while.  Now I'm back
with a new machine, 1200 upgraded, and ready for another stint with AMOS.

My first question back on the list is:

What is the current state of extensions, EasyLife etc.  I use currently use 1.10
in Pro, have I missed any updates?

Cheers,

Steve W

What do you expect, everybodys busy with their respective parts! (I 
know I am) I did download the demo though, so here you go.

Yep, all problems were solved. Well, except that if you pick up a 
certain powerup it crashes, but I suspect this is due to routines not 
being in there yet to handle the powerup.

That was me. :) They should not bounce off the screen natch.

I gave you a huge list of things you could implement, like weapons etc. 
Did you not get that?

>
>SOME REPLYS ON PANG PLEASE!

Well, in brief, more weapons, more powerups, maybe have the screen 
scroll a bit to have a bigger playfield, a new background, and that was 
about it. That should get you going. :)

Hello all!

Well, I said I would tell you my web page address when I'd uploaded it, so
here it is:   http://village.vossnet.co.uk/c/champion

You'll probably be most interested in the programming projects page :)
(go there direct by adding "/projects.html" to the end of that ULR).

There's not much really of interest up there at the moment, but in the
future, I'm hoping to have some stuff to download from the projects page.

All I really want for now is comments. The pages are up, but they're hardly
finished. I'd appreciate some feedback about broken links, bad layout,
bad spelling, anything really :)

Right. That's all for now.

See y'all!

Yeah, it should do. Has anyone actually sat down and figured out a price
which is "reasonable" just yet?

Yeah, anything to go in here (executables, pics, texts etc.) I would prefer
if people sent directly to me at some point towards the completion of the
project. Because I am sending out the actual program, the contents can be
changed at any time.

Yes, definately the case. I can remember legging it home from school, just
to load up my C64 to play buggy boy and bomb jack, before having a good
blast at stunt car racer! There wasnt any fancy GFX effects, but the
playability was 100% which made it extremely easy to play.

I guess its because people have seen and played the PC games in the shops,
and want to try and bring the market that strayed over, back to the amiga
thinking "Hey, this machine *can* do that after all..."

Playable isnt small or big, its how well the user can interface with the
game. If you grasp that concept, then the size of the game doesnt matter
all that much.

Yes, thats usually the best way to come about it. Look at Paul Burkey's
Sneech for example, a damn 100% playable game, with tonnes more fun
addiction by adding the useage of weapons etc to destroy your enemy big
style! Anyone who hasnt seen this game, I suggest you get it from my
library right now!

I havent heard anything from this one in a while, from what I have heard
though, it was coming along rather nicely.

I still think the best Amiga 500 game ever made was Stunt Car Racer, and as
soon as I can speed up my routines, i'll make a version of my own!

I have an excellent "Flashback" clone in my PD library, i'll just see what
it was called... Bugger, cant find it. I know Asa sent it me a while back,
sheesh, I hate it when that happens. I'll search my diskbox tonight.
Another good another-world type game I have is Green 5, and I *still*
havent made it all the way through yet. Lots of in-game animations in it
too, hehe.

I think there was one update, im not too sure. If you go to the PD sections
of my homepages and look in the lists of extensions, im sure you'll find
all the info you'll need.

OK, that can be arranged. I myself arent making any money off the project
either, as all I am doing really, is a high-score table.

This is one of the reasons I would like to distribute it myself, rather
than upload it to a first virtual server. Before starting, the system would
require a small keyfile, which I myself create quite easily and distribute
with the software, which contains the name and address of the registered
person.

I have several different encryption methods I use, so will make it encrypt
the same info 2 or 3 times, and shut down if it detects a tamperment.

One method around this, is for the keyfile to contain some kind of
important variable needed by the listgame itself.

Plus, if a hacked keyfile goes up on a BBS somewhere, I can scan the
keyfile and retract the person's name and address from another, better
encryption, not called by the program, and send the info to a worldwide
piratelist.

   Yes, don't let people fool you... it is MUCH faster than AMOS code.
   While you are processing 8 VI objects in AMOS, you could be
   processing 40 VI objects or more (depending on how optimized
   your original AMOS code, with the 8 objects, was)...


>Does anyone know the secrets of this sort of thing?

   However, every language has it's limit... so, what they do is use
   a kind of priority-processing method (I would assume)...

   Say you have those 100 objects scattered around a fairly large
   area (multiple screens in size)...

   Your first priority is to update the objects which are currently
   visible. These are updated every frame.

   Your second priority would be to update the IMPORTANT
   non-visible objects. Say you decide to process five of these per
   frame. 

   Finally, you process everything else, only one of these, less
   important non-visible objects, per frame should be sufficient.


   It would be easier if AMOS supported Lists, but it doesn't, so
   you could just similate them, which thankfully is quite easy,
   although quite messy as well!

   Just set up three array-types, for example...

   VISIBLEOBJS()  would contain pointers to the Visible (on-screen)
   objects.

   IMPORTANTOBJS() would contain pointers to the NON-visible, but
   important objects (say an assassin tracking you down).

   OTHEROBJS would contain pointers to the remaining objects.

   VISIBLEOBJS are updated every frame.
   Five of the IMPORTANTOBJS are processed each frame.
   One of the OTHEROBJS is processed each frame.


   Basically, you just transfer the pointers around, through each of
   the three ARRAY-TYPES, as the game progresses.

   For example if IMPORTANTOBJS(1) moves on-screen, it is
   "removed" from IMPORTANTOBJS() and added to VISIBLEOBJS().

   Oh, of course you need the actual MASTEROBJECT arrays which
   tell the details for every Object: postion, image, current action,
   etc.

   The other three arrays just contain a Pointer to this MASTEROBJS
   array.

   So, you'd retrieve the object-number from say OTHEROBJS(1) 
   and say it is 5. This tells you that the actual OBJECT you are
   processing is object-number 5 in the MASTEROBJECT arrays...

   Or, a simpler (but more memory-intensive) method, rather than
   removing/adding entries ala Dynamic linked-list style, would be
   to Define the three TYPE-ARRAYS with 100 elements each. Then
   just loop through all 100 of the VISIBLEOBJS each frame and 
   process every VISIBLEOBJ() that is non-zero as Object loop#.

   Same applies for OTHEROBJS and IMPORTANTOBJS, just loop for
   five reps on OTHEROBJS, if non-zero, process OBJECT loop#.

   This way, all you have to do, to transfer Objects between the
   three ARRAY-TYPES, is simply zero out the old ARRAY-TYPE and
   Set the New ARRAY-TYPE, for the Object in question, as in:

   IMPORTANTOBJS(1)=False : VISIBLEOBJS(1)=True 
   This IMPORTANT, non-visible object just entered the visible
   playfield...


   Anyway, it would be MUCH easier with structures and lists, but
   anything can be done if you just go to the fundamentals...


   Hope it helps.



      Take Care,

       GARFIELD

   Definitely, I think it could be improved on too. Again, I just used
   it as a style of game. We could use Warcraft as a starting point
   and work more detail/gameplay into the whole thing...

   Okay, forget Warcraft and use Command and Conquer as the
   starting point then. Actually, I think Diablo looks pretty cool so
   we could also use that as a model and build on it...

   First, the time of the 680x0 series Amiga is over. There's no
   denying that. It is still a great machine, but the CPU speed and
   Blitter speed are "outdated" as far as leading-edge commercial
   development is concerned.

   Personally, I believe the worst is over... we are now at the dawn
   of a new era. Gateway2000 can make the new Amiga generation
   succeed. The A\box and PIOS One machines will be able to
   compete in the current marketplace and in the coming years
   as well.

   Second, you have to take the time to do the project right. I love
   to see how fast I can make small Freeware games, but to make
   the kind of games selling IBMs and consoles you must be willing
   to spend MANY months of hard work. Many of the top games on
   IBM and consoles were created in a period of 2, 3 or more years.


   The way I see it, if you are going to work on a SUPER system-
   seller of a game, start it now on the Amiga, but target the
   A\box or PIOS One (at the very least the 50MHz Amigas).

   Don't rely on Amal or too many AMOS-specific commands so the
   game will be as portable as possible. Actually, we really do need
   that AGA Extension which should be arriving in the weeks ahead.
   Then we just make the biggest, greatest game ever seen and
   don't even worry about the fact that it runs at 1 frame per
   second on a standard A1200. Once it's on the A/box, we'll 
   probably find it hitting 50/60fps easily.

   That way, when these machines are available, Gateway, 
   Phase5 and PIOS(?) will have some SUPERB software available.

   32-pixel width limit? That's a bit rediculous. I could use it for 
   Phase One of the SideShooter, but that's it. The Mid-Stage Boss
   is 96 pixels wide and some of the asteroids (Phase three) are
   64 pixels wide. Who knows how big the Final Boss will be, half-
   screen maybe...


   Speaking of the SideShooter, this weekend I should actually be
   able to work on the stage. As I said, this MidBoss Phase is very
   simple compared to mapping out the hundreds of details for the
   Enemy appearance maps of Phase One, so it won't take nearly
   as long.

   Should have a new demo up Sunday night... maybe. I seem to
   only work on the thing on the weekends, don't know why 
   exactly. Just seems like the weekdays are so busy and fly by so
   fast, next thing I know it's the weekend again...

execute one tiny part of a large task, and then end. I create it in such a
way, that 20 or 30 different procedures could be instigated, and leaving
each time, so each one is being run as the main routine is ran.

I have a small flag to determine if something somewhere should be
happening, and if the system finds this flag, it will run that small
procedure, increment its flag, end if it has to and reset the flag, or
simply just go to the next piece.

To put it simpler, i have each routine call once from the main routine in
the loop, if it needs to be. For example, in a main game routine, I make a
call to the timer routine, which checks for the current time, and if it
needs updated or not, then onto player movement, and then onto drawing.

With Extreme AMOS, the texts were loading in as you were viewing them,
making calls to the user interface also, so you didnt lose any speed.

hehe, "skeptical??". Well, I don't blame you, either. I didn't think 
it had ever been done before until I ran across John's raycaster, and 
much to my suprise it had been done it AMOS!

It was that small bit of inspiration, coupled with some programmers 
drive and the fact I didn't have any projects at the time, that I 
decided to write on (along with a 3D game to utilize it). (I had
originally drew up the concept to write a raycaster and start on this 
project earlier this January).

Btw, I'm hoping to change the "very slow, very low detail on a medium 
spec Amiga (and I think John is too, he said he was rewriting his 
original raycaster, which he asked for beta tests, and I responded, 
never getting a reply! ahem.)

Hmmm. Thats a big problem really. If someone develops an excellent AMIGA 
game, they're not very
likely to turn down the chance of making MUCH more money from conversions 
to other machines just
so that the AMIGA can have some sort of advantage.
The only hope would be to have the conversions not released for some time 
after the original
AMIGA version. Somehow I have the feeling that software companys would 
rather release all
versions virtually together though.

There's that quoting previous games again. Warcraft (although quite good) 
good be severly
improved upon I think. Much more originality needs to be put in and to be 
honest I'm not sure the
entire game topic would be best either. A fantasy style game has the 
feeling of old role playing
games and whilst alot of people like that (including myself, although not 
as much recently),
things like Command and Conquer with much more familar topics is more 
widely appealing.

Something else that seems to get at me recently is that I feel that 
things have to be done fast
due to the AMIGAs demise. I think its still going down hill (anyone seen 
that AMIGA computings
next issue will be its last?) and theres not alot of time to spend 
working things out before
creating your masterpieces.

Yes. Thats something needed. And faster bob collision routines.
I've tried Powerbobs but found it so limiting that I'm not sure I could 
really ever use it.
I can't remember all the problems but one was a 32 pixel width limit.
It may be OK for the side shooter though...?

But too be honest it can't.
It can make very simplified versions of them which just make people think its an inadequate 
machine compared to the rest.
Sure, with these PowerPCs it'll all change, but unless the cost is significantly lower than a PC 
then..... anyway, I'm not talking about that.

I think it does to some extent. A very small playable game can be alot of fun but its a big 
playable game that really makes the difference in selling machines.

All there is on the web page is a menu routine!

Excellent game, especially with a serial link, although you couldn't play the other leagues very 
easily.
Can your routines really keep up the good speed?
Sorry but I've been a bit skeptical about all these AMOS 3D raycasters. They sound great but so 
far the only one I've seen (John Bintz I think) was very slow with very low detail on a medium 
spec AMIGA.
I won't judge yet though! I do hope they live up to promises.

I think I tried that. If I've got the correct name that it managed about 1 frame every two 
seconds on mine.
OK. So I could do with upgrading but its not that bad and surely to sell any significant amount 
they will have to aim lower than what they have done. (poor english, I know)

Sorry. One of these days I will note down his address.

Qrnd(0) appears to equal 3.

In direct mode it works OK and returns 0 but in a program it seems to return 3.

Sounds like a useless command I know, but it is quite useful for me.

This is something I'd wondered about for ages.

With games like Syndicate and Powermonger (and even Populus) they all have around 100 people 
doing reasonably intelligent stuff.

Know, I have no troubles getting maybe 8 very intelligent things or 20 or so reasonably 
intelligent things going and keeping up the game speed but 100 or more?

Obviously the assembly programming helps alot but is it really that much?

Does anyone know the secrets of this sort of thing?

   Obviously, I am currently involved in the AMOSList Game#1, but
   I'll give some input anyway...

   If you and Laurie work on the Game Design NOW, then by the
   time we have the First List game completed, you should have
   the ImprovedWarcraft GameDesign completed.

   At that point, I will help out with the module-definition, coding,
   etc.

   You can't really get anywhere until you have the GameDesign
   done, so you know what exactly you are creating.

   Once that's complete, what I do is break the GameDesign down
   into the Main modules, which are further broken down in to 
   the SubRoutines and Tasks.

   Once you've reached this point (you have both the GameDesign
   and ProgramStructure/ModuleRequirements), you can list
   these on your WebPage and the programmers can select a 
   module to work on.

   Same applies to the gfx, sounds and music. Need the Game
   Design first, as that will contain everything needed. Just need
   to extract all imagery, sounds, music and list them on the web-
   page, along with the modules, and then let everyone jump in
   and grab each tiny piece (whether it be code-module, image,
   or whatever).

   Just something to consider...



      Take Care,

   Sounds EXCELLENT to me. The part about the world-map is

   USA. NorthEast PA to be more precise.

   Again, I agree completely! I want the game to be released as
   Non-Freeware!! It's not just the money, it helps the Amiga in
   general. Shows it's active, defines Non-Freeware standards,
   and yes, if we're fortunate, earns us a little cash...


   Actually, it is quite possible we could find a publisher, such as
   EPIC Marketing, to release the game as one of their new
   Budget Commercial titles. I don't care how you guys do it,
   Shareware, Licenceware or Budget Commercial. Anything but
   Freeware.

   When you start working on games like CapnBubba and releasing
   them as Freeware, you might as well pack it up because I
   guarantee, users will expect it again and again. Shareware
   registrations will drop even further, Licenceware will be
   effected.

   Problem with the Amiga is that too many times in the past,
   developers weren't responsible in that they didn't look at
   the effects their releases would have on the market.

   It's the same with the mags. Some give out entire commercial
   games FREE on their coverdisks. Yes, it's great for us as users,
   but it's killing the market. How can you expect users to register
   Shareware games, purchase Licenceware games or Commercial
   games when they can obtain such high-quality software for
   NOTHING (well, almost nothing). The answer is, quite simply, we
   can't.

   I know, I got carried away again, but there is a valid point here
   and considering MUCH of the Amiga developing talent is located
   on this AMOS List, we could repair at least some of the damage
   if we would all "come together" on this...

   Agreed. AMOS makes development incredibly fast/easy and I'm
   sure many people on this List (myself included) are at the point
   where they can churn out games/code in a few days time.

   Problem is, it's more than just the coding. Programming is only
   one aspect of game-development. In my experience, Unlimited
   Design is working on a commercial game, the GFX take longer
   than anything else.

   The artists have been working for ONE YEAR now on the gfx.
   The images are fantastic, fully 3d-rendered, as good as any
   you'll see on Playstation/IBM, but to get that level of quality-
   animation, it takes time. Our lead artist, Dave told me his
   Amiga spent two days solid just rendering out the main player
   gfx, and of course, first he had to spend the time to model them
   all.

   Combine this with the fact that many of us have jobs, families
   and you just have to accept that it will take a good amount of
   time to create anything of TOP-QUALITY.

   Exactly. And like the guys doing the raycasters, once they have
   the techniques down, the code can always be ported over to
   the A/box, where it will quite likely run "fast as hell".

   Well, I know I'm going to be flamed for this, but you really only
   have two choices...

   First, port the AMOS-code over to C. Write some gfx/sound/
   music convertors to transfer your non-code files over to A\box.

   That is the method I was aiming for...

   OR

   We will have to write our own IMPROVED version of AMOS on the
   A\box, again most likely in C.

   I know one guy on this List is currently working on a MUCH
   IMPROVED version of AMOS. A sort of hybrid language with the 
   best of both AMOS and C/C++.

   If he can get the support needed to finish his Amiga version,
   he wants to port it to the A\box. 

   Now, I hope I can find time to help with this project. It will be
   MUCH better using POP then C/C++.

I'm the one who runs the web page for the 2. list game: The C&C/WarCraft game.

I started out very optimistic with this thing; loads of people seemed to be
interested and the first list game worked out pretty well. Thus I made up some
code and ideas for this game and announced the page together with Laurie
Curwood, asking for any ideas, comments, code or gfx. Anything.

About 1 1/2 months has passed since, and I have got ABSOLUTELY NO response,
except from ONE guy who wanted to do some gfx (I just forgot your name! Still
working on it?)

Wasn't this project interesting after all!? What did go wrong!? Should we
terminate the project or what!?

Please give me a little response!!!

That's not troublesome, it helps keep the final price down.

Good enough. Don't forget the promotional stuff dir, where you can put a demo
of something of yours to be included with the final release. (You have all
checked out the final directory structure?)

It would require either a keyfile or a recompile of the program for each
registered user. How about it, Mush? Which idea seems best to you?

In what way? Granted, the Amiga shareware market is less active than the ibm
market, but there must be SOME loyal amigans who would pay to support a
project of this type. After all, this is the first international amiga
programming effort. We're actually worldwide. In fact, I'm thinking of a
credits page map of the world with highlights showing where all our
contributors come from.

Granted, none of us will become rich off this game (unless a software house
wants to buy it) but the money we do earn will give us all a bit more
incentive to do this madness again. Believe me, as project coordinator, it's
NOT an easy task.

How about a list from someone of all the FREE extensions? Is powerbobs

   Exactly!! If you can do that, then I'm sure you know it's just as
   possible to port from AMOS back to C, and on the A\box.

   Actually, if we had a GOOD GFX library available, porting from
   AMOS to C would be much easier than the other way around...

   Ah, yes. Forgot about that!! Still, we would be sacrificing much
   performance as the Compiled AMOS 68000 Assembler code
   would be interpreted by the PowerCPU on the A\box, instead
   of directly executing...

   But, you are right, as long as they plan on developing a 68000/
   Amiga hardware memory-map, the programs should work fine.

   Indeed it is!! A very determined individual!!



   Well, it's been enjoyable reading/replying to all this e-mail, but
   now it's time I actually do some work on the SideShooter or
   Mr. Giark will be booting me out of the ListGame project!!

Sorry everyone (I've been off camping...).  I'll be sending out the 
raycaster to everyone who wants it tommorow.

And, mathwise, my new raycaster is MUCH faster!  I cut out all the 
unneeded divisions and multiplications, and changes as many functions as 
possible to squares (lsl and lsr when compiled).  On my 68000 it is 
barely playable, which means it'll probably be fine on all your faster 
computers.

Nope.

Watch this. It's an infinitive loop.

Repeat : R=Qrnd(10) : Until R<>Qrnd(0)

Try Print Qrnd(100)  and then Print Qrnd(0).

Both Rnd(0) and the AMCAF command Qrnd(0) return  the  LAST  random  number
created with Rnd(x) / Qrnd(x) with X>0.

It's not a bug, it's a feature :)

Subject: RE: Crippling Programs & Shareware
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hello to everyone on list. This is my first posting to AMOS list, I beg your
pardon for my poor english, I'm italian.
 
If people would pay to use program there were be no piracy, and relase
crippled proggy will be stupid, but it isn't so.

Many years ago (it was 1990' end) I made a lot of anim for a friend of mine,
who is a photographer. Few month later, I start to write a program which help
me to realize anim. At beginning it had few effect and too much bugs, but it
was usefull  and easy.

Soon I had selled a copy to another photographer, and I thought I will sell
more copies and make a lot of money, but few days after many photographers had
yet a pirated copy, there were no  copy protection, and I get no money any
more! So I had decided to expand but to not release :-(

In 1995, I had changed idea, and had released a new version as shareware. It
wasn't crippled but has a requester, which on every saving will stop program
for max 2 minutes. Program was usable, but when you try make an usable anim
you lost a lot of time, so if you need it to do anim you must pay. I had sent
a demo disk to Italian Amiga Magazines and to many people, who asked for a
demo version. Magazines had spoken well about it, but user say they couldn't
try it becouse requester slow it too much. Then I introduced credits, which
disable pause on demo version until you have them, but on every launch they
decrese. Until
today I had got only 7 registration, do you think other people don't use it?
To get new credits it is simple, you must reinstall it, it is nasty but it is
free :-(

Now it work only for 30 minutes and save only first 15 frame, and when you get
"key", it works only on your machine, and if you add/remove/change hardware
you need a new "key", it is nasty but you don't change your hardware config
everyday.  =) 

Nuturally if you upgrades your machine you will get a new and free "key" 
only if you call me and say what you had changed. :-)

I think this way of crippling is good enough.

I think pay to use a program (commercial or shareware/giftware) it is right!
Information should be free, but tools to get/store/manipulate must be payed,
becouse they are done by people that spent a lot of time to do a "tool", and
when you use these tools you save up time/work/headace...
Most popular tools to store information are books? Are they free? No! They are
mede with paper which has a cost, many people work to do them (this is more
expensive than paper), someone must pay their working hours... Why should
programs be free?

I don't expect to make any money from this game, but if we actually *DO*
make some money from it, whatever it will be, it'll certainly help keep me
on the amiga and away from those nasty pee-cee's.  If a software house does
buy it, I think we'll all be around on the amiga for quite a while.  Just
think, actual shop displays..

Mr Shopkeeper, I'd like a copy of 'Captain Bubba and the Nasty Alien Menace'

hehe, I know you were asking Mush, but personally I think that it 
depends on how many copies are sold. The recompiled version is a plus 
as it would be harder to crack and the person who holds the rights to 
it (the person who registered it) would have proof it was his.

On the other hand, a keyfile is handy, doesn't take as much work, 
but, heck, it comes with the territory (work does, recompiling).
Even though recompiling will take longer, it's safer.

Shouldnt we in fact wait on making this clone for a while? Just that my
buddy Paul Burkey is coding a game called "Foundation" which is still under
heavy construction, and yet wipes the floor with anything I have seen on
the Amiga and PC. He is releasing it through Sadeness PD, which could mark
our attempts slightly.

Im not saying we shouldnt code it, just that we should wait a short time
till the foundation panic is over.

The routines I have for polygons etc. could probably just about keep up
with a game similar to the first version. However, when i add everything
else to it, it may slow it down slightly.

Ive never tried to combine it all together to get some kind of working
version together, but one of these days I might.

I wouldnt mind having a good bash at the program code with you. I cant do
it just yet, I have to finish my mailinglist manager program, due to a
rather important usage by a guy i know, so im currently working flat out on
that.

Once its done, rest assured I will give you some help with code etc.

Gee, decisions decisions, hehe.

OK, when the full version is completed, I would like to get hold of the
full source code, and add my encryption routine to it myself, plus compile
it. This way, only I will know how to decypher the keyfiles, and there is
no possible way the info can leak out from anywhere, unless some gorgeuos
blond with big ....... <ahem>

Anyway, this way, I can then compile the one executable, and use another
program to simply create the keyfile which is shipped with the program.

Any opinions/flames?

Cool, i did something like that for a bit of a mess with Twinz, but never
used it. A little aeroplane flying round everywhere. Quite cool. I could
knock something up like that if im provided with a list of countries etc.

I would also like to get peoples pictures to include too <grin>

I think the objective would be met if even just 1 person registered, as
this goes to show there is at least 1 honest guy out there.

Powerbobs is a register extension. You cant compile with it until you
register. I'll go through all of my lists of extensions tonight and see
what extensions I have are freeware.

One system I was considering doing was reading enviroment files, such as
names etc. and if there is a difference, the program prompts you to get a
new key. I ended up dropping it afterwards due to the fact most peoples
configurations were different than everyone else's

Good idea, i might work on something similar.

Not always, if you come up with a killer method for encryption, then there
is no way that it can be cracked succesfully. If you incorporate system
variables into the file, and checksum tables, then you have to be a bloody
good cracker to figure it all out!

Sorry. I've just realised that Qrnd(0) or Rnd(0) returns the last value from a Rnd statement.

Anyway, I've just been told something that is very useful for one of my games.
That is this.

Randomize 10 (or whatever)
For N=1 to 3
Print Rnd(-100)  (note the -ve number)
Next N

This program will ALWAYS return the same three numbers.
It doesn't work with Qrnd though.
Is there any way of achieving a similar result with Qrnd?

Thanks,
-Murray

Which is the exact reason I code in AMOS. I don't have all day to spend on programs and I don't 
fancy spending years on projects but with AMOS I don't need to.
I've got enough experience so that I can turn my hand to almost anything and have something 
playable ready within a couple of hours.
The problem with it is obviously its not as optimised as those programmed in ASM or C but 
hopefully with the new cards and A/box, that problem will be reduced.
AMOS programmers will always have to aim slightly lower in terms of speed compared to up to the 
date programs but it will still open many doors.

I am right in thinking that the A/box IS power PC isn't it?
If so, we may be getting AGA finally, but now we need power PC support for AMOS!

I would certainly contribute in the programming area but it would depend on a few things which 
I'm not too happy about.
I wouldn't like to dictate terms to anyone working on it but...
1. I don't think it should be fantasy based.
2. It needs some good original concept. I will put some thought into it but lots of people 
putting some thought into it would be better.
3. Virtual guarentees that we can get some people to draw good graphics for it. Alot of people 
seem to say they will help and then give up a week later.

Lets see how much response your letter gets so we know if the interest is still there.

Well, my raycaster is a combonation of C, C++, Asm (from PC), and 
some of my own ideas and adaptations ported and converted to AMOS.

I have a program that can encode serial information into a program after
ot has been compiled.  You only have to make one "empty" one, then you
can put the registration info into it.

This way only takes a few seconds and you don't need to compiler lots
of versions.

I use it to encode serial numbers into Poswiz.

Neil.

Sounds alright to me. I'll put a bit to display the registration info in the
menu prg, then you can just plug your code into it.

Yes, $1 per contributor. Ej has expressed a desire to not be paid, so that's
$13 so far. But, some of those listed have only done 1 or 2 graphics, not
enough to warrant monetary inclusion. I'm waiting for the replies.

Sounds good to me. What I plan to do with most of my games (my 
upcoming 3D game namely, not Eventuator anymore, as I said that 
project has been took off the list and put away. I have another idea 
for a game, new storyline and characters.) is something similar, only 
probably have the shareware downloadable on the page or whatnot, and 
then the user will have the option (after registering) to have the 
registered .lha w/keyfile e-mailed or snailmailed to them.

Hmm, well, I think just the contribution of my raycaster alone is 
monetary enough $13, but, aside from that, it doesn't matter..

hehe. Haven't given you my location yet, so, just mark me down. I'm

If you make the program require specific information from the keyfile, such
as variables etc. there is no way you can run it properly just by bypassing
the "check" as it needs the variables, or it will crap out

I think Brane is from one of those places where nobody ever dare goes, cos
you ask a nice easy question, such as "Where did I put me pen" and they
would give you a universal grid location, down to the exact millimetre!

Hehe, just kidding brane matey

I think he is in Peterborough, England. England, I know for sure.

Thats the whole point. The info is sent to both first virtual and me when
ordering, with an option to request postage/email delivery.

Thank-you for ordering software from the Mushroom PD library. Im sorry if
it has taken a while for your order to arrive, but due to the amount of
orders I still receive via Email, even though the FTP site is active, I
cannot always guarantee an immediate response.

Thank-you for your order, and please call back again soon.
