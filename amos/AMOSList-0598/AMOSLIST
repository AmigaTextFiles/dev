Hello.

Thanx to those who helped me out with my previous questions, but now i have
some more questions that i'll need help with.


1. I have made my Gui file in GadtoolsBox and saved it with the save 
   command without crunching it.
   Then i go into AmosPro and start GuiConvert from my user screen, and
   klick's on the Gui file i joust saved in GadToolsBox, but nothing happens 
   exept that the requester pops up again asking for a Gui file.
   What's wrong????????

2. I read some place in the Guide for Gui Extension that there was a seperate 
   doc for the TCP commands, where can i get this Doc??? And is there a doc
   that explains the usage of how to for eksample check if a button on
   your Gui file has been klicked on???

3. Well this one is a bit hard for me to explain, but how do i go abouth 
   making a bar show up over a text when the mouse is over a Zone, but
   the text must be over the bar.
   If you have read some Diskmags you will have seen that most of them 
   have a bar that shows up under the article name when you move the mouse 
   over a article name, this is what i want.

Oki, please help me with this questions, so issue 4 of my diskmag can be 
really cool, so those Amos haters in the Amiga Scene can see that Amos is 
good for something.

Morten Bolstad


- Of all the things i have lost, 
  i miss my mind the most.

Hello.

Here is a question that i forgot to include in my last mail.

I want a option to print the article you are reading in my diskmag to the
Printer.

Here is a bit of my code for putting the text file into a mem bank for 
displaying the text in the diskmag.


CODE$="I'am not gonna tell you"
Open In 1,F$ : SIZE=Lof(1) : Close 1
Reserve As Work 10,SIZE
Bload F$,10
Mem Unscramble 10,CODE$

After this i have a unscrambled version of the text file in bank 10,
what i now want to do is to print the text file i have in bank 10 to
the printer.

After trying some of the commands i tryed Printer out Start(10),Length(10)
and i thought that should work, but all i got on paper was some garbage,
What's the right way for doing this???

Morten Bolstad

No. You're wrong. Amos and Amos Pro are different things.
So, Amos Pro 2 exists and it's version 2 of Amos Pro.

Hi,

  Here is a method of speed control that I have developed.

 It keeps speed to 100% nomatter what the fraim rate.




DO

 Timer=0

  <Put ALL screen drawing and bob drawing routines here>
        eg. drawing the player on screen

 Wait vbl

 T=Timer

 <Check Joystic/Keyboard here>

 For A=1 to T

   <Put all movement and maths routines here >
          eg. making the player move 

  
   Rem  If this bit takes more then a vbl to run, then there
         will be some slowdown, but not much.

 Next



Loop


 the variable T is always how many VBL's the screen drawing has taken.



See ya.

Then you are wrong, AmosPRO started with v1.0 and short after a v1.12
update was released as pd, then there came an v2.0 upgrade witch was
PayWare and followed the AmosPRO compiler, that was the short storie ;).

Hell. This seems like a weird arguement.
What I think is that there was AMOS Pro 1.0 then a couple of updates
and then an update that reoriganised the way extensions worked and
then they called in V2.0
Basically it didn't look any different, it just worked internally a
little different and seen as there was no major differences people
just tend to call it AMOS Pro rather than AMOS Pro 2.

So you are all right! Just depends on how precise you are being.

Thanks to all for the suggestions. Mush had it right - if I opened a PAL
screen, it worked. (My amiga is a PAL amiga but I run it in NTSC here in
Canada.) But I've got the updated lib from Pietro and it does fix the bug so I
can now open NTSC screens with no errors.

On a different not, the SCSI controller is in stock finally and I will be
getting it within the next week or so. CBATNAM is going to be back in
production! Now, how about the 12 tunes and all the anims and pics that I was
promised?

	Hey guys,
	What's wrong with just a wait vbl at the end
	of all your code? I stick a wait vbl command
	right after my screen drawing routines and then
	this sets the speed of my game at no faster than
	60 fps (or 50 in PAL) 
	I have an A3000 '030 25 and an old A500 000 8
	and things ussualy run great on both machines, if
	ocassionally a little slow on the 500 (depending upon

	That long T=Timer business seems to me like it would
	artificailly slow your game down, why?  Unless you 
	are in the gunning for less than 60 fps.

Here's my 2 cents worth:

AMOSPro V1.1 was the original which went on sale
AMOSPro V1.11 was the Amiga Format, slightly crippled version
AMOSPro V2 never went on sale, as it was an update which came only with the
        compiler.
AMOSPro V3 - Who knows....

That's no argument, and weird !?!?!?!?, what exactly did you not understand???
I'm only telling about the versions, and nothing else.

A guy claims that there is NO v2.00, and that is NOT truth, that's why I'm
saying he's wrong about that part.

>From the start, there was a guy who said that he has got AmosPro2, then
another guy claimed that no such thing exists, and that's wrong, I'm calling
it AmosPRO and every one else does, but it's still v2.xx that is the latest.

No matter how little or much diffrence there is from v1.00 to v2.00 the
versions still exists ;).

So short answer to ?, YES AmosPRO v2.0 EXISTS.


*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
The *ONLY* reason for my intrusion in this tread, was that I'm sick of seeing
things like, one guy ask a question about AmosPRO2, and then a wise *** pops
up
and claims that no such thing exists, he should try to help the guy instead.
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

 
AM> So you are all right! Just depends on how precise you are being.

Great, now I'm happy ;)

Let's spare the bandwith, and stop this tread before it grows to noice.


Excuse my poor english, it's not my native language.

  If you make a game which isn't very CPU intensive, then you don't
need any kind of sync because it would run at full speed anyway,
 but if you have a lot of big bobs and lots of gfx update every fraim, 
then the game can be too slow on older amigas, while too fast on the 
top of the range amigas.

My system works by taking how many VBLs the gfx updates take, and then
running through the control code that many times eg.

If the game is running at full speed (1 vbl per update) then it would
move the player 1 step at a time .

If the game then slowed down to 1/4 speed (4 vbl per udpate) then the
player would be moved 4 steps at once, making move at the same speed,
if a little jirky.

It wouldn't slow the game down in any way, it would just make sure
that if the game did slow down, it wouldn't slow down the gameplay.


  If you like I can write an example to explane it better :)

Never seen this one, but heard alot about it.

You missed v1.12 ;), it was an update that was released to the PD, as they
used to do, but it was the last PD release.

Here is a text that I found on my v2.00 update disk.

Murray, I disagree with you, after reading this txt.

-> Inserted by me off

You  can find all the documentation about this new version by selecting the
option  "Lastest  News"  from the Editor's "Help" menu of the newly updated
AMOSPro.

If you're updating from AMOSPro V1.00, you have missed AMOSPro V1.12, so you
will  also find in the help menu all the information about the modifications
between AMOSPro V1.00 and V1.12.

No, you are right, I've got mine with the compiler to.


Then there is some ppl, talking about a v2.01 or 2.02, and that is not
Pietro's
updateded versions, but I've never seen them, does anybody know what diffrens
there was made in these versions, not pietro's, but the other 2.01/2.02, if
they
exists.


AK> AMOSPro V3 - Who knows....

hello Pietro, you promissed me a final 3.0 by the end of this month, nono
just kidding ;).


I'm off this tread, sorry for the noice.

Murray, I disagree with you, after reading this txt, not in the name part, but
in the diffrence from 1.0 to 2.0.

Sorry I had to write this letter 8).

Make sure that it's saved from the Project menu, and not saved as w indow
etc. Also check that your version of GadToolsBox is correct in the docs.

The documentation for the TCP commands in in the archive available from my

Read your documentation on the " Gui Help" command. Dead simple. Does it
all for you.

Use something like:

Open out 1,"PRT:"
Print #1,"Text for Printer"
Close 1

You can also use PAR: which uses the user's printer settings, if I remember
corretly.

No it don't.. "PAR:" is a direct dump/input with parallel port, that way you're
sure to get in trouble with special chars like ö, æ, ø, å. etc..

Use "PRT:" always to dump text...

Sorry, but i still have the same problem.
I use GadToolsBox v 37.121 (13.05.92) and in the preferences menu under
project i have nothing selected.

Then i make my gui and saves it with the Save as fuction in the Project 
menu and then the file is named what i want and .g at the end not .gui

When i try to convert the gui i joust made, the requester joust pops up 
again asking for a gui file, but i selected a gui file and it doesent work.
I've tryed to rename the file to .gui but that dident help at all.

Anybody able to help me with this????

PLEEEEZZ

Is there an easier way to get accurate gui button images than the image
grabber? If I draw a bunch of 56X16 buttons, is there a way to tell the
program where they are rather than trying to fiddle about with the mouse and
ending up with incomplete borders?

Is the img file just a bob bank? That would be easier, since the bob editor
has some tools for getting exactly the graphics you want.

Well met and godspeed,

You could use a regular window/bevel box, and manually type the text lines
in there, using a vertical slider to work out the lines etc.

Hi!

I've just discovered that I have installed a AGA-extension, when, I do not
remember, but proberbly sometime in 1995, so it's long time ago, but can
anybody, PLEASE!! tell me what the name of the archive is, and where it may
have come from, because I can't remember where and when I got it.

AmosPro slot #20
Name:  AMOSPro_AGA.lib
Size:  9.872
Date:  21-Aug-95

When I use the show loaded extensions in AmosPro:
AMOSPro AGA Extension © '95 N.Critten v1.00 Build 312 Dedicated to Kim

And when I dump the version info:

Believe it or not, there is a funky new bug with the gui environment. It
sometimes munches for/next loops. I've had the same troubles. In one case, I
actually had to go back to a=a+1: if a<12 then loop to get the data loaded.

     Greetings,
     
        I am having a problem with sequential files where I cannot load all 
     of the information from the file into memory.  I have included the 
     source for both the Load and Save routines below.
     
        After I save to file I have looked into the file via a hex reader 
     and all of the correct information is there.
     
        When I try to reload this file back into memory it only seems to 
     load the first record in the file.
     
        Any help you could give would be much appreciated.
     
     Declan.

I think Critten was involved in some other extensions, but I can't remember
which.

Nope it is no fake/virus but just some bad extension of a kind.

It's on the way, check you'r mail ;).

Hello,

I assume you've all read the question from Palle on that (almost) unknown
AGA extension. To round it up, it's a library of 9.872 bytes, with a very
simple name: "AMOSPro_AGA.Lib", it should proberly rule slot 20.. The lib
identifies itselve as: "AMOSPro AGA Extension © '95 N.Critten v1.00 Build 
312 Dedicated to Kim"...

Anyway, Palle was so nice to send me the lib, and I hunted it down with a
little syntax-finder utility I have written some time ago.. The result is 
a complete list of all syntaxes for commands in the lib, I'me including it
here in the hope it'll make somebody say "aha - I know this." so we can
shine some light on this thing..

Command list for "AMOSPro_AGA.lib"

Wie gehts?

As some may have noticed, I have been on or not sent any mail to the List
for the past few weeks (almost a month now). The reason for this is that
I'm about to move (state-to-state) and have been making preparations for
this (which included an additional trip down to my destination and looking
into getting a house). We now have a house (remember I'm living with the
folks since I'm still in school, eek!) and all the final paperwork for
everything is being done. I'll be moving the end of this wonderful month
(May) and will be off for about a week afterwards until I get moved in
and set back up. I am back now for a bit, and will be until about May 23rd.

Now you have a small updated piece of personal information from me :) I
thought I would respond to one more thing (regarding CBATNAM, Giark) :|

> On a different not, the SCSI controller is in stock finally
> and I will be getting it within the next week or so. CBATNAM
> is going to be back in production! Now, how about the 12

Well, as much as I would love to have some GOOD news for you, I don't. As
I've said (here's an excuse) I've been busy, finishing studies for this
year and getting ready to move (which means I've barely had any time for
any computer-related activites at all). I understand that you wanted the
game finished for this month, but I can almost assure you that my level
will NOT be entirely finished by the end of the month. You have my go-
ahead to release the game with the addtional tunes and pics if you want
(and without my level), but you'll have to come up with some other ending.

That should do it. One thing: I have been working on my website (continual
testing on the beta-site too), with new graphics (smaller! ahem, Mush)
and more user-friendly layout. All this should be finished soon. :)

For those who want to know, I'm moving from Oklahoma to Texas.
(Not very far, so get out your maps and locate these if you want).

Can that one be found somewhere? I would like a utility to let me see what commands
there are in some extensions I have. I have one called TokenList.AMOS or something
like that which was a part of the Craft extension but for some reason it's very
buggy nowadays (somethings I only get a cursor at the top, other times it can't
recognise the name of the extensions).

When I save a sequential file I place the ";" character between all the
variables, plus a Chr$(13).

(Eg. Print#1,_INSTRUMENT_NO(N);Chr$(13);_MIDI_CH(N);Chr$(13);_BANK(N); ...etc)

That works for me.

Hiya all,

I'm  a bit puzzled now as I have a few versions of the amos.library on
my hd!!!

What I wanna know is which is the best one to use?

I only want the one which fixed the 3.1 interlace bug.

Which one was it?

Here is the sizes and info I can remember...


amos.library - size 46948 (recompiled by Pietro - nothing else)

amos.library - size 47044 (not got a clue what this one was!!!)

amos.library - size 47216 (again, no clue as to what this is!!)

I  don't  even  seem  to have a backup of my original Amos.Library, so
what  size  was  that?  I  guess  it's also 46948 if the recompiled is
anything to go by!

Did this recompiled library fix the interlace bug with 3.1?

Wasn't there a library recently which allowed screens to be promoted?

And  wasn't  there  also a library which did nothing, but give a blank
screen when you tried to load Amos?

So many questions and I have no answers :(   HELP!!!

Can  someone  help  me here? I'm not sure which one to use as they all
seem to work fine for now!

I  can't check for 3.1 bug coz I only use 3.0 ya see, so I really need
to know which one to use, if ya see what i mean?

Feel free to email me your amos.library which works with the interlace
3.1 bug and which is still 100% stable in all other areas. Either that
or tell me some info on the above ones I have if poss.

Pietro?  How  about  shoving a Ver$ in the library from now on so that
Amos Pro reports which version it is using?

Now that would help a lot :-)

Tarra for now everyone and TIA.

Andy

I looked in the F1 AGA disk, and discovered that it is in fact this. The
title has now been removed from sale for over 2 months, as it was crap and
the author couldn't be bothered to update it to bring it to modern
standards.

                    Amos AGA Extension (Build V.312)

             AGA Extension Code Copyright '95 - Nigel Critten
             AGA Extension All Copyrights '95 - Michael Prince
          AGA Extension Distribution Copyright '95 - Formerly Joe Jenkins

Exclusive Worldwide distribution rights now F1 Licenceware as of Oct 26 1995


    Any bug reports to be reported to the following - 
    Telephone - (After 8.30pm) Michael Prince 01332 273679
    Letter - Michael Prince,5 Hall Park Close,Littleover,Derby,DE23 6GZ

 Disclaimer - All the above take no responsibility for any damage or loss to
 software or hardware which may occur if you use this extension.You do so at
 your own risk.

 Please Note -
 This extension is LicenceWare and may not be distributed by anyone other
 than F1 Licenceware and their official distributers.

 If you are installing the AMOS Pro version you'll have to manually enter
 the extension name into the extension list at number 20.
 Even though most graphic functions in this extension are slightly faster
 than their 32 colour counterparts you can get a 15% speed increase if you
 use AMOS Classic 1.35/1.36.e

 Installing The AGA Extension For AMOSPro -
 1) Goto the Config menu.
 2) Load the Interpreter.
 3) Load the Default Configuration.
 4) Click on Set Loaded Extensions.
 5) Type in at line 20 (excluding speech marks) "AMOSPro_AGA.Lib".

 Due to the way Amos works Sprites,Bobs and Mouse related commands may react
 in a corrupting way on screen. Future versions will take care of this.


 Bugs Fixed From Build V.251 -
 1) Sprites had a bad habit of appearing at random.

 2) AMOS patched so you can now use the Change Mouse command with AGA
 screens.

 3) RAW Image data can now be held in Fast Memory and copied straight to the
 screen from there.

 4) Screencopy and Blocks were known to misbehave if they went off the
 screen anywhere, sanity checking has been put in to clip these and they
 should behave themselves from now on (I hope!).

 5) If you quit out of a program that held a AGA screen open and used the
 Default comand to get your system back to normal (which is the only offical
 way of doing it) then the next time you ran the program the AGA screens
 wouldn't open and you were left with a normal AMOS screen.This was due to
 not clearing a flag that told the system that the screens were open.


 Bugs Fixed and Extra Commands From Build V.269 -

 1) Extension fixed to work with both AMOSPro and on a CD32.

 2) AGA Screen command added.

 3) AGA Front Screen command added.

 4) Second version of the AGA Colour command added.

 5) AGA Use Font command added.

 6) AGA Spack (Picture packer) command added.

 7) AGA Unpack (Picture unpacker) command added.

 8) AGA Sprite Mode command added.

 9) AGA Text command now supports clipping.

10) AGA Screenopen command now bug free.


 AGA Extension Commands Supported -

 AGA Screen Open

 Synopsis - AGA Screen

I'd like to see ANY of the tunes and graphics; ya, that would be nice. Get on
the ball, you lot. My SCSI controller will be here by next Wednesday, at which
point I will be finishing up the first alpha release of the final game. I'm
only going to add one level at a time to make sure it all remains compatible.

Get out your egos, dust them off, and prepare to have them trashed. My
hardware troubles were my excuse. What is the excuse for the rest of you?

I need the tunes and graphics.

Not a thing is legal to upload. And apart from the fonts, there's no need to
upload it either since everyone already have them.

The last one is in the ROM from 2.04 upwards anyway...I don't know which AMOS
version you're using but there is a Assign command built into AmosPro.

     If I wanted to have a delay of 40 ms within my program.  How would I 
     go about doing it?
     
     To be more specific I need to receive strings from the serial port and 
     there is a delay of 40 ms between each string.  Without a delay I am 
     getting an overflow.
     
     Any help or advice would be appreciated.

Subject: MPD Announce: F1 Software USA Pages updated!
Status: O
X-Status: 

The F1 Software pages have been updated, and a brand new version of the
catalogue id now available for download. Also available from the page, is a
list of titles written by Paul Burkey, author of the upcoming smash hit
Foundation, which are now available in the USA for a lot less than
purchasing from UK.

Ive also removed the huge table of existing F1 titles, and replaced it with
a much smaller one of current F1 demo titles, which you can download and
try before you buy.

Just to remind you, the URL for the F1 USA page is 
http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/f1software/ and from there, you will find
links to all the related info, including the list of Paul's titles. The
Mushroom PD FTP site is as always mushy-pd.dyn.ml.org and if you log in as
anonymous, you should be OK. To get to the F1 demo's, go to /pub/f1/ and
for the 5th dimension demo programs, /pub/ware5d/

For those who might already have an idea of the titles that they wish to
look at, this list is of all the demo titles which are currently on my FTP
site and available for download:

        Arcade Darts (F1-139)
        Ballunacy (F1-130)
        Boris Ball (F1-133)

        DMC Gold (F1 Gold)
        Erik (F1-048)

Well, as I said, I won't have my level entirely finished by the end of the
month, although I may have some addtional graphics for you (will have to go
back and see what else was needed). If you want to make a few beta releases
first, go ahead and I'll give you my level when it's done (sometime in
June), before you complete the whole build for the final version. :P

     For those that are interested, I solved this problem by doing the 
     following.
     
     Procedure Save
     
     Print #1,Str$(_INSTRUMENT_NO(N)),Str$(_MIDI_CH(N)),....etc.
     
     End Proc
     
     
     Procedure Load
     
     Print#1,_INSTRUMENT_NO(N),_MIDI_CH(N),....etc.
     
     End Proc
     
     Very strange don't you think, considering all the choices I was given 
     by different people.  Would this be because of the GUI Extension?

I have some questions!
1. How are Amos programs stored?
2. Are they tokenised?
3. Are the bob routines using the graphics library blitter routines?
4. Whats the format of a bob .abk file, does this include the bob 
masks?

Oh how do I get on/off this list, it has probably changed since I 
joined 3 years ago.
I could just be nasty and join some more lists for when I leave 
university.
Hope someone can help.

It seems like all of you guys love resetting the timer in the middle of oyur
programs...
This is very bad programing style and it can be coursing wrong timing.
Use:

Timer=0 : T=Timer
Do
  [Update screen here]
  Wait Vbl
  OLD_T=T
  T=Timer
  For FRAME=OLD_T to T-1
    [perform movements here]
  Next FRAME
Loop

This way the timing will be kept accurate no matter what is going on...
You kan even use the FRAME-variable in the moving of things :)

Oh yes it will. I'm using the borderblank in MCP and my GUI-program I'm developing
is opening on the workbench screen without a problem.

Only problem with it is my programming...I'm having one small difficulty: how
does one set up custom tag-lists in Amos??

Ok, I just got done reading all that the manual and the doc files had 
to say about using the Equ() and Lvo() functions in AMOS.  After 
trying (and failing) for days now I resort to the list.
	Perhaps it's my ignorance of Amiga libraries or something, but I 
just cannot get any call to the graphics library to work.  One reason 
may be that I have no graphics library nor intuition library in my 
LIBS: assign, but I recall someone telling me some time ago that the 
exec, dos, graphics, and intuition libraries were all held in ROM.
	The docs on the productivity disc say that the equates and library 
vector offsets for the graphics and intution libraries are not 
included in the AMOS_Equates file.  So how then do I access these 
libraries?  What type of value does the Gfxcall() or Execcall() 
functions take?  (I tried positive, and negative intergers and 
strings--nothing works)
	Maybe I need to be educated about exectly what I'm dealing with 
here.  I have very little experience with Assembly or C because I 
find their extensive use library calls increadibly confusing.  Could 
someone educate me in this area please?  I do not what my programming 
abilities to be limited entirely by standard AMOS commands, 
especially since they are so unfriendly to the system at times.

	One more small question...how does the blitter work?  I don't mean 
to get to broad here, but since registering the AMCAF extension I 
have been tinkering with the blitter commands and I am at a loss as 
to how they really work.  I get the Blitter Clear command and I can 
even copy whole screen with these commands, but what if I want to 
copy a small section of the screen or do a little custom BOBing?  And 
what if the boundries of the section are not at word boundries?

	Sorry about all of the tech questions, but my desire to create 
better programs on the AMIGA seems to be hindered by these two basic 
concepts.  Any and all help will be greatly appriecated.

I've made a screen, got rid of its title bar and screen cloned it to
an AMOS screen.
I need to detect clicks on the screen and do adjustments accordingly.
I can do this fine except for one problem, if the user click where the
title bar WOULD BE, it doesn't register on Gui Wait as an event.
Is there a solution to this?

Thanks,

Sorry - this ones for Chris but I can't find his addy.

I noticed something about the Pt Raw Play command. I loaded an Iff
sample into a chip data bank. Using code similar to that of the Sample
Bank maker it is easy to work out where the sample data is ie not the
header and other stuff. The AmosPro Sam Raw works ok with the values I
work out, but the Pt Raw Play always has a kind of click/buzz with the
same data. Even if you move the pointer well beyond the header it's
still there. Any ideas? (I have the Dec 97 AMCAF lib) BTW the reason
for all this madness is that instead of relying on .Abk banks for
samples Iff samples can be used. This makes changing/editing sigle
samples easy.

They both take an offset from the library base to the function you 
require.
If your going to mess around with the library functions you need to 
get hold of the Autodocs for the libraries. And maybe some RKRM's.  
They are on the web somewhere (I cant remember the place but I 
followed a link from the Amos factory, any help anyone)
The place has all the stuff you need to download as amiga guide 
documents.

> 	One more small question...how does the blitter work?  I don't mean 

Get the stuff from the above site.
Once uve got the blitter sorted you can do all that lurverly AGA 
stuff youve been wanting to do for ages.

Limit Mouse would prevent the pointer going into that area.

The libs that are in ROM that I can renember from the top of my

Negative... If I renember right something like  DUMMY=Execall(-132)
should turn off multitasking for example
(and DUMMY=Execall(-138) should turn it on again)
Variables and pointers (varptr()) are past with the dreg(x)
and areg(x) commands.

I would like to help you if you want, but since I'm also learning
ASM (but I'm probably further than you ??) I don't know if I can
help you with everything.

I havn't played with the blitter yet, but I do know some things about
it that I've read. But probably this isn't interesting for readers on this
list that only use AMOS.

To all those concerned:

The borderblank I was using killed aweb, wordperfect, gui extension, etc. I

Erm,  sorry but Amos Pro may have Assign command but it STILL requires
Assign to be in your C directory before it'll work.

Seems silly if ya ask me and maybe Pietro could fix this too?

Surely a quick call to an internal library could assign?

I've mentioned this before but got no solution... 

Open a slider through the GUI extension and unless you're running a
program to change the gadtools like Visual Prefs or MCP, the slider
bars are invisable because they're the same colour as the rest of the
screen!

There must be solution to this!

I'm not sure if any of you have used Backbone or not but since it has
moved onto using the GUI extension its taken off. I'm getting a fair
few more registrations and a lot more interested people in it.

Anyway I've got a mailing list going for it. Its basically used for
discussing new ideas and improvements to it as well as announcing new
versions when they appear. 

You can get it from aminet as dev/misc/Backbone2_main.Lha and
dev/misc/Backbone2_ex.Lha
The current version is v2.01 but v2.03 should be out soon which fixes
many bugs.

Anyway to join the mailing list go here:
http://freespace.virgin.net/malcolm.murray/backboneml.html
or:
http://cs.nott.ac.uk/~agm96m/backboneml.html

Oh and I want to create a really nice looking platform game with it to
show off seen as the examples are all a bit dull. If there's anyone
out there who can draw good GFX for a platform game and will stick
with the project until it's complete then let me know! :)

Thanks,
-Murray

OK, so I was reading some article about Amos.  The only thing that is 
wrong with it (as we all know) is the lack of OS friendlyness.
Could it be possible to rewrite (if the library is shared) the Amos 
library using nice OS calls instead of just hacking your way in there 
and doing what you want.
Was there anything ever written about doing structures in Amos?

Yes of course ;)

Actually you don't receive a 'signal' because now there is the window title
bar where the screen title bar would be :) The perfect solution for your
problem is to open a backdrop-noborder window.

You can select the 'Backdrop' flag in the window/Edit Flag... menu of the
GadToolsBox (..or use the GUI attached here). Complete Example:

Gui Screen Open 1,640,256,4,Hires : Gui Open 1,1,20 : Gui Change 1,0,0,640,256
Gui Cls 1 : Gui Clone 1,True

et voila'! Now using Gui Wait you'll always receive the mouse clicks.

Geez!  All  this time that I have been using it thinking Amos required
it in the C Dir! DOH!

Thanx  for  that  tip. It sure is strange though why the Help function
states that it is required in the C dir though!

I'll  take your word for it seeing as you went to all the hard work of
testing.

Sorry I disbelieved you in the first place.

That'll teach me... ;þ

I used HappyENV before, but found some stuff didn't work well with it,
but that was a long time ago!

I may try a newer version soon. Once again ... thanx for the tips :)

 I need some help showing AGA animations (anim7/8) and possibly showing AGA images with AMOS, I'm making a game like Myst (well, not just me, a group of about 50 people), and I'm wondering if the intuition extension would be powerful enough to make a game like that.

 Of course, as for the animations, they'd have to be encoded or something, but thats way down the track. 

 Is the intuition extension good enough to do simple stuff, like loading a  picture (640x512) and making some mouse-zones (so the player can click around, move etc)

 If it can, could you please mail me and I'll get my team on it straight away.

Subject: MPD Announce: Foundation Mailinglist Officially Open!!
Status: O
X-Status: 

The official Foundation mailinglist is now open. For all those who don't
know, ive been working closely with Paul for just over 6 months on this
project, and now the game has begun to go on sale (First copies are to be
sold at the WOA, where Paul will be attending on the Sadeness stand) it now
seems appropriate to go public with the email address.

The software used to run the mailinglist is my own, and will be available
directly from F1 Software in the next 2 months or so.

There are 2 sides of the mailinglist, a digest side, and a regular posting
side. If you subscribe to the Digest part of the list, you can still make
postings etc. and will receive one large email a day, with all the previous
day's postings compiled into an easy-to-read list for your convinience. If
you join the regular list, then you will simply receive lot's of seperate
mails. It is possible to join both of the lists if you wish.

To join the mailinglist, simply send a blank email with the subject as
SUBSCRIBE DIGEST  (if you want to join as a Digest member) or SUBSCRIBE
(on it's own will place you on the regular list) to
mushypd-foundation@redrose.net where it will be processed automatically.
Please allow for time to process your mails, especially if the list is
experiencing a lot of traffic. Digest's are compiled at Midnight EST time,
and can take as much as 2 hours to distribute it to everyone. Please be
patient.

I would also like to ask people not to make any kind of postings to the
list until they have received confirmation that they have been joined to
the list. The list is moderated by myself to ensure nothing spam-wise get's
through, and when a SUBSCRIBE/SUBSCRIBE DIGEST command comes in, an
authentication process must occur before you will be added. If you try and
post before you receive the final conformation, there is a good chance your
mail will not make it onto the list.

For those who are interested in seeing what the list is all about, you can
send a mail to the same address with the subject as FAQ and information
will be mailed to you, without placing you on the mailinglist. Note, that
the FAQ and INFO files will be majorly updated as soon as Paul returns from
WOA. Which takes us onto the next part of the message.

Paul Burkey is on the mailinglist, so please don't heckle him with lot's of
stupid questions that are already answered in the FAQ files. Paul already
receives lot's of mail about Foundation, so please give him time to read
and reply to mails.

Thank-you for your time and patience. Enjoy the game, and now enjoy the
mailinglist!

Well, I got my SCSI controller - it didin't work. So I have to send it back.
Luckily, there is an Amiga show in Toronto in two weeks, which I will be
attending. After that, I will either have a working scsi controller or a
bigger internal ide hard drive and the game will be rolling. Of course, as it
stands we still have no music for the game and most of the between level pics
never showed up.

Thanks for the help. I've actually solved the problem in a slightly
different way. The problem with the backdrop option is that the window
has to be the full screen size and that caused me problems. Anyway, a
combination of various other options has had the same effect and works
great!

Now one other thing... detecting mouse clicks is easy but is there a
way that I do a sort of mouse key command? I need to know whether the
user is holding the mouse button down and not just clicking it.

Thanks,
-Murray

Just shove them all together is my guess. You've seen amos code calling long
hex values, do that here.

$40000000 and $317F7F7F

     This is on topic as it involves a program I am working on.....Anyway, 
     I need some help with hex.  I understand the basics of hex ie. the 
     decimal equivalent of hex numbers up to 255.  What I am having trouble 
     with is hex numbers that include more than the usual.  I think an 
     example is called for....
     
     I am addressing some of my midi equipment and the specs say the 
     following....
     
      Address(H)          Size(H)
     -----------        -----------
     40 00 00 00        31 7F 7F 7F
     
     00 49 10 00        00 00 02 00
     
     00 40 21 50        00 00 00 01
     
     The address part is not a problem as I have figured that out.  In the 
     third example the size is 00 00 00 01 which means that it consists of 
     one value, so that is not a problem.  It is only when I see values in 
     any of the other columns that I cannot figure them out.
     
     In example two, 00 00 02 00, what is the decimal equivalent and how do 
     I calculate it?
     
     In example one 31 7F 7F 7F, what is the decimal equivalent and how do 
     I calculate it?
     
     Any help would be appreciated and I would appreciate you emailing me 
     privately.  Thanks.
     
     Declan.

Hello Declan_Gorman@modusmedia.com

On 18-Maj-98, Declan_Gorman@modusmedia.com smashed the keyboard with:

Right.. First a little background. HEX means 16, just like deci means 10,
I think it's either greek or latin.. Anyway they refer to the base number
of each position, always starting from the back...

a normal number folowes:

56
 +- Last pos is base 10^0=1, so value is       6*1 =50
+-- Second pos is    10^1=10, so the value is  5*10=50

Ok, for hex the base is 16, so we have a hexnumber:
$2F52
    +- PosValue= 16^0 =    1, number =  2 *    1 =    2
   +-- PosValue= 16^1 =   16, number =  5 *   16 =   80
  +--- PosValue= 16^2 =  256, number = 15 *  256 = 3840 ($F=15)
 +---- PosValue= 16^3 = 4096, number =  2 * 4096 = 8192

Then we add the ting together and get 12114 as result...


You can get amos to make the conversion:
Dec->Hex:  Print Hex$(256)    (Result=$100)
Hex->Dec:  Print Val("$100")  (Result=256)

In AMOS hexnumbers is always treated as a string with "$" as the first char..

Sure.. detect the mouse key press is easy. By default you'll receive 2 events
(-11) when you click the mouse.... the first when the user hold the mouse
button,
and the second when the button will be released. And so when you receive the
first event, consider the mouse key pressed until you'll receive the second
-11 event. You can also check the Gui Code:

Gui Code   =104    ($68)    Button Pressed
                = 232   ($E8)    Button Released
                = 105   ($69)    Right Button Pressed  (... see the Gui Rmb
command)
                = 233   ($E9)    Right Button Released

Ok, here's something for you aces out there.

I've got an array with for example this data:
A,A,A,A,B,B,B,C,C,D,E

Now I want to randomize this array so that two equal data
won't be next to each other. I.e:
A,B,C,A,E,B,A,C,B,A,D

In cases this is impossible like when I've got the following data:
A,A,A,A,A,B,B
The output should be something like: A,A,B,A,B,A,A

Or when the data is: A,A,A,A,B
Output: A,A,B,A,A

All the datas must be randomized, even those that are equal.

Can anyone help me with this? Please???
The routine must be able to handle longer datas than one char.

If you got any additional questions E-mail me privatley.

Actually what you want is NOT a rondomized array. It would be randomized if
you couldn't say if two equal datas are next to each other or not.

What you want is a different order.

I would do it in this way, even if I don't know if it's the best one.

A) Fix the first data
B) Go to the next data: if it's the same swap it with the first different
   one, otherwise do not anything.
C) Go back to B till the end.

For sure this tecnique isn't 100% sure because could happen that there's a
chance to order them as you want, but you don't get it. But at least it
should be rather fast.

 > The routine must be able to handle longer datas than one char.

Longer datas are handled easily with your own comparision.

If you look in the GUI SET command, there is a link to follow to making
gadgets inactive. Changing the text of a button is somethng ive been
wanting to do for ages.

First, changing the text in an active button is imposible, You can't even 
do it in 'C', 'ASM' or with OS DevKit.. The only way to change it is to
'remove' the button and define it once more, but the GUI can't do that
either (Not as far as I know anyway..).. For the same reason I've decided
to not use the GUI, as readers of my letters would know; I prefer to use
the OS DevKit anytime, simply becourse it's imposible to use a 'locale'
with the GUI extension...

I've found abug in the GUI extension.
When using scroller bars (Arrows at the end and a bar to slide
up/down) the bar part of it will only be displayed if you open the
window on the workbench screen.

If you create you own screen (however many colours) and then open the
window on it, the colour used for the bar is the same as the one used
for the background and therefore invisable.

I've only taken this long to find it because I use MCP which alters
the Gadtools look anyway and therefore allows it to look OK.

Please fix!  :)

Thanks,
-Murray

No, HEX means 6 (you know a hexagon consists of six edges).
We talk about HEXaDECImal numbers, which means something like 6+10 = 16...

Ok, I just finished compiling two cool games and/or parts of games on 
my nice little A2000 with OS2.1.  I saved them to floppy and tried 
the binaries on my friend's A1200 with OS3.1.  They didn't work!  All 
I got was the nice little "program failed" error.  I put in the amos 
library and everything I cound think of.  When I got back to my A2000 
they worked fine and even when I booted under OS1.3 they worked.  
Does anyone know at all what happened?

Yes i know :) A stupid bug about VisualInfo and the detail/block pens.

Already done... i've sent you the fixed version. Try it, and let me know if it
works fine for you.

*To all the GUI users:*

don't worry.. i'm working on a updated version. I've fixed all the reported
bugs and the strange effects. Now the GUI Extension should be rock solid as
usual :)

Is trap a command which doesn't work with 3.1? If so, I could have probs
with my mailinglist stuff.

I've been using Trap in a program I'm working on.  Using it sparingly has
caused the following:

Random 2 byte writes to the screen
Random 2 byte writes anywhere else
All kinds of weird stuff being written to the screen

I'd avoid using it, especially in commands like Trap A=I Bob(4), where the
result is a function.  In that case, yor computer will bug out like crazy.
Avoid Trap!

Ouch! I just use it for trapping for file access right now, as I cant
figure out a way to get around it. Oh well, hehe

Hello again.

here is some questions i hope to get some help with.


- I have some problems with understanding how to get the diffrent gadgets 
  to work in Amos.
  Here is my problem:

  I have made a little multitasking menu for my diskmag that is to pop up when
  you multitasks to the Workbench.
  On the gui that i have made in GadToolsBox there are one button for going
back
  into the diskmag and one for quitting.
  I've included the gui into my program and it pops up as it should when i 
  multitasks to wb, but i dont understand the syntax for checking if button
one 
  or two is presed.

  this is what i want

do 
If button one is pressed then multitask back to Diskmag
If button two is pressed then End 
loop

- Is there a way to make a homepage and put it on www in a special way so 
  no one can trace that homepage to you, not even the cops???
  And is this possible to do with a E-mail adress to??

  If i open a Hotmail account and Lie on all the questions i have to ansver
when 
  opening the account, can that account be traced to me in any way then??


Thanx in advance for helping

Morten Bolstad

it quite a bit. Does it always bum out?

I use it very sparringly in my latest program, and it still hacks around
in memory.  Mayhaps Pietro can poke around the source and give us some
feedback on this Trap problem?  It really destroys programs if used with a
function:  Trap A=I Bob(6).  You have been warned.  8^)

I never use trap for file access.

For most, I use Exist and Eof(#)

as in

If Exist("File Path")
 open in 1,"file"
 do
 input#1,a$
 if eof(1)
  exit
 endif
 loop
close1
endif

Create the GUI with 2 buttons, and use something like:

Gui Open 1,1,20 : rem Open up GUI

do
a=gui wait

if a=1:end:endif
if a=2:amos to front: ..... :endif
loop

If you RTFM and look at the examples, its all their for you!

I can do it with homepages, but its not advised. I dont even reccomend you
upload anything illegal. Most FTP sites carry at least your IP address in
the logs when uploading.
