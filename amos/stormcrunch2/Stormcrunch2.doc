			Storm Amos Cruncher V2.0b

			     1993 Ejber Ozkan

This program will let you crunch any file into a much smaller file and when 
you need to use that file again you can decrunch it using this program again.
As you may be aware this program bears a remarkable resemblance to another
certain PACKER! (Even down to the colours on the menu!).The program was 
written this way to show the capabilities of AMOS! and also to help me learn 
how to use the amos menu system.As you can see I havent done at all bad!.
However the crunched files will NOT decrunch by themselves!.

To use click the right mouse button and select a menu option.
The menu options are :-)

Project
-------

Load File...

Use this option to load a file to crunch By selecting your choice using
the AMOS 1.34 file requestor.

Save File...

Use this option to save a crunched file once crunching is complete.

Delete File...

This option will let you delete a choosen file from a disk.

About...

This option will scroll some information in the system window.

Quit...

This option will bring up a requestor asking whether you are sure to quit.
The requestor is the first in a long line of amos extras that Im currently
working on!.It works in the same way as the ReqTools Library but uses 
procedures instead.!You can even move the requestor box around the screen
By Clicking on the border woith the left mouse button and repositioning.


Prefs
-----

To detonate that an option is selected you will see a tick by the side of the
option currently in use.

Data file...

This is the default this will load any file into memory using the binary 
load ,And will then crunch!.

Amos compiled file...

This will let you crunch Amos compiled files.This uses the same system as 
the Amos compiler program.So If it doesnt work proparly dont blame me!.

Decrunch Colour...

Will let you choose which colour use when (de)crunching.
From a Choice of:-
Colour 0
Colour 1
Colour 2
Colour 3

Efficiency...

Will let you choose the cunching speed of the program.Generally speaking the
Slower the crunch the smaller the file.
Choose from:-)
Slow
Mediocre
Normal
Fast
Very Fast

Screen Prefs...

Will Let you change the Palette of the screen.Using the same system as in 
the S.I.I.T program.With the exception that the PreS icon will flick through
a PRESET list of colours.


Recrunch
--------

Load and Decrunch Data File...

This will Load a file that was previuosly crunched by the Storm cruncher.
Once the program is loaded it will decrunch it ready to save in its original
state.Please note that any file crunched not using the Storm Cruncher will
Most probably cause havoc to your system!.

Save Decrunched Data File...

Will save a program previously decrunched into its original state on to disk.

Clicking on the backpage gadget will move you out of the program and into CLI.
You can now multiTask without any problems.To get back to the cruncher just
click inside its window and press return! Viola!.

I hope this is of some use to you.The program source code is included in the
AMOSCODE directory so please feel free to examine it!.
If you decide to use the requestors then please credit ME! somewhere in your
programs!.
