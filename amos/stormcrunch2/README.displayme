Storm Cruncher V2.0b
--------------------

This was originally released through AMOS p.d library .I thought I would
re-release through aminet now that I can use aminet sites.

Please tell me what you think of this version and what I could do to improve
it and for a general chat about AMOS either e-mail me at
