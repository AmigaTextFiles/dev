A while ago we were talking about an english version of the instructions to
the JD extension. Someone said that they had them. Any chance you could
send them?

My anim2bob converter is on aminet now. I'm still waiting on comments and
feed back (bugs? etc). Check it out and let me know.
If you do not have access to aminet (ie mail only) I can send it to you
uuencoded.


Also now on aminet is a program in amos that I used the converter to make.
It's called SITUP. Check it out.

Oh yes, the AGA hack. I'll mail it to the list next week. It has quite a
few limitations. It is not True AGA, it does let you have a high resolution
screen
but not high resolution sprites. The sprites are set from within AmosPro,
so it couldn't do anything with them.

Don't forget that this hack could cause problems with screens that

I expect that you are writing the BPLCON register of the screen

Of course not...  The AMOS Pro user manual *claims* that wildcard matches for
variable names is possible.  The examples given on page 05.05.07 say that
Global"*" should declare all variables global.  The example of wildcard usage
indicates that "V*" means all variables beginning with "V," that "VAR*END" means
all variables starting with "VAR" and ending with "END" and any number of
characters in between.  The "?" wildcard is alleged to be a replacement for a
single character, e.g., "A?OS" would match with AAOS, ABOS, ACOS, ADOS, and so
on.  Blanket Global definitions, according to the manual... The reality version
is that as soon as AMOS encounters a quotation-mark after Global, it's a syntax
error!  So who is lying, is it the manual, or the command interpreter?  Oh well,
who cares?  It doesn't work...

>Who, who, who??? ;-))

Why, was he wrong?  You guys are terrible!!  Always wanting to flame
somebody...:)  I will say this, though, that I do appreciate his input (and that
of a few others as well).  Even though I still think AMOS is basically safe for
almost all systems, a few more quirks were brought to my attention.  Up until
now, AMOS Pro + Compiler has been the one software package which has impressed
me above all others.  From the moment it began installing, I knew it was going
to be awesome.  Until I found this AMOS List...  What is this, a support forum
or a flogging post??  Ok, I've come to realize that there are a few minor (but
potentially dangerous) problems with AMOS which effectively eliminate it as a
candiate for serious commercial development.  Won't share Workbench with other
AMOS programs, doesn't multitask well to begin with, won't run in interlace mode
on 3.1 ROMS, and a handful of other little thorns.  Because of the wide range of
system configurations out there, AMOS just can't guarantee 100% compatibility,
and what about future machines?  What evil new bugs will rear their ugly heads
then?  As a commercial developer (but not needing the speed of C at this time),
AMOS would have been the "dream language."  But, I can't afford to have even ONE
user unable to use my applications.  This makes me think of an analogy:  AMOS,
this ultimate environment with sooooo much potential, shoots itself in the foot
every time it runs.  Or, kind of like a screen door on a submarine...  Go
anywhere you want, just don't dive...

>JR> 2.  You guys love to hate AMOS!

>That's me, I think? :-)

I'm afraid it''s me, too.  Now I'm starting to sound like you guys...  Well, at
least it's good to know these things, even if I don't like it...

Right, unless it's a totally serious application that lots of working animators
and videographers are going to depend on for their livelihood :-( , in which
case, if I do it, I better do it right... Or, "Oh, say can you 'C'?"  I can 'C'
clearly now...  Time to dust off SAS C and reactivate those system assigns...
But AMOS still is mega-cool, and -- What's happening with the "AMOS Clone" the
"Update Team" is working on?  Is it happpening, or what?  If it has the features
of AMOS (but better) without those annoying little disqualifications, then I'd
buy it!  Will it be commercial, shareware, or (hey!) freeware?

>JR> 3.  3D Extension.  With AMOS Pro I received a 3D extension, and nothing in
the

>Buy KickStart 1.3 :-(

Oh, sure, that figures!  Why should it bother to be upward-compatible?  Like
AMOS, like certain AMOS extensions... :)

Thank you, to each one who has helped me to decide to be very careful what I do
with AMOS!  I suppose shareware game-type stuff would be ok -- if it won't run
on your system, then, oh well! :)  And thanks for letting me be the "guinea-pig"
so others can learn from my stupid questions.  If anyone does know anything that
might change my mind about not trusting AMOS 100%, speak up and let me know!
I'd gladly flip 180 degrees again.  Programming in C is not quite as quick, or
as fun as programming in AMOS.

Hi all.

I always read about AGA hacks, patches to open AGA screens from AMOS
and so on.

My question is:

is there anyone writing a REAL Aga extension for AMOS & AMOS Pro?

I think that Amos needs AGA commands. Why not writing a small extension to
open AGA screens (all resolutions, AMOS and Intuition), loading AGA sprites
and AGA pictures (256 colours or more)?

There was some rubish in the AMOSPro manual about being able to
pattern match on the names of variables to be made global, or define
them in strings, or something else totally stupid. Thankfully it doesn't 
work - it would lead to incredibly bad code if it did.

??? Whats kickstart 1.3 got to do with it? And, even if you do need it, 
there is a program called relokick (on aminet I except) to use 1.3 on 
any machine by placing the 1.3Rom code in ram without buying it).

As far as I know, you need the AMOS 3D extension for amos creator
because it contains some extra code to make the 3D extension run.
The .lib you found with amospro is only an update to make amos3D run
with amospro.

Well.. about this, It's the 3D extension that you for some years ago 
could bought in the shops, the original 3D package, this extension is 
for use with AmosPro... Nothing else, So if you would like to get the 
hold of it, You then have to buy the original! That's it... :-)

  I'm actually coding an extension for AmosPro, to allow it to play with real
screens/windows and so on... More powerfull than IntOs, I hope.

  I have to create some instructions like 'Screen', with double function:
     Ak Screen A     to select the screen to work on.
     A= Ak Screen    to get the nscreen's numer Amos is using.

     Yep, as the real instruction 'Screen'.

 BUT I FAILED!!!

Question: How should I initialise the token-table?.. I've tried this:
    dc.w  L_hop,-1
    dc.b  'ak scree','n'+$80,'I',-2'!
    dc.w  -1,L_hop2
    dc.b  $80,'0',-1 .......  approximately, I don't remember


  Who can help me ???

  Oh, yes.  I've never figured out how to do those.  What you have looks
right, but for some reason AMOS will only acknowledge one of the two
formats.  I have a feeling that Francois put in a kludge to make Screen and
similar instruction/functions work correctly... <sigh>

  What I wound up doing was something like:

Set Iscreen N	to set the current screen
N=Iscreen	to get the current screen number

I'm at the moment making a music-pack for my group, and are having
some trouble...

You see, I've gotten a design which is really cool, but I think it's
a bit hard to make it in Amos. In the pack, you are supposed to select
modules from a list with the mouse, and this list is longer than the
screen, and you are supposed to be able to scroll trough this list with
a scrollbar on the side of the listm just like this:


     Module 1
 _   Module 2  <---Screen top
| |  Module 3
| |  Module 4
| |  Module 5
| |  Module 6
| |  Module 7
|#|  Module 8
|#|  Module 9
|#|  Module 10
|#|  Module 11
|#|  Module 12
| |  Module 13
|_|  Module 14
     Module 15  <---Gfx laying on top
     Module 16
     Module 17
     Module 18  <---Screen bottom
     Module 19
     Module 20
     Module 21

#'s=Scrollbar

Now, to top it off, there's supposed to be some gfx on top of the bottom
of the list, but there's some holes here and there, so you can see the
list trough these holes. Does anybody know if this is possible at all???
I'd be happy for some replies.

Sure.  Cheat.  It's obvious frlom reading this list, many Amigans don't 
know what a Sprite REALLY is, much less a playfield.  Wintel boxes don't 
HAVE playfields, guys!  Don't argue.  Read the Ami Hardware Ref Guide.
 
Anyway, you can cheat by using dual playfield mode.  But I've read here 
that AMOS is unreliable for that.  Verdiict readers?
 
If you have free sprites (probably), you can position them (and define 
them to look like what you want) over there partial areas you want 
occluded.  It's easy, and doesn't involve wasting cycles (as common with 
bitmap diddling).

I also tried this idea for assigning/reading structured variables in 
Easylife, and successfully got it to tokenise eventually, but it 
in the "IScreen = N" version, it didn't automatically evaluate 'N' and
put it on the A3 stack like it normally does. Instead you had to call
an AMOSPro evaluate routine (Which I discovered from single stepping
one of the AMOSPro instructions in Monam). However when I tried
it, it was very unreliable and sometimes if the instruction was at 
the end of a line (But not always), it didn't move the AMOSPro 
counter to the begining of the next statement correctly.

I may be able to dig up the bit of code that did it when I go home 
the weekend after next if anyone's interested.

Hi everybody:

I recently got around to installing AMOS Pro on my A400 (after having it 
about a year!) and I've run into some problems.

Basically, I can't get it to run reliably. I was told to disable my 
caches, and this works, occasionally. Very infrequently, I run "cpu 
nocache" and then run AMOS with no problems. More often, I get a garbled 
screen and have to re-boot. Can anyone give me a more reliable way of 
running the program.

I also finally got around to ordering the AMOS Pro compiler, only to be 
told that it is no longer available. Is this true? If not, where can I 
get it?

Please forgive me if these are questions that are answered in the FAQ. I 
am impatient for answers, and I'm just getting around to reading the 
various files.

Thanks in advance,
<<<Les<<<

Nice. Mail me if you need any beta-testers :-).

Just of the top of my head:
-height differences in the landscape, i.e. hills, mountains, etc.
-trading with other cities (this is a feature I miss in The Settlers-demo 
(and yes, I am still considering buying it)).
-make things look more varied. Although Sim City is a great game, that 
still can compete with Sim City 2000, it all looks a bit boring. There is 
no shame in having all the fire-stations look different, as long as it's 
clear that they are in fact functionally the same.

I'll try and think of some more.

The usual trick is to perform some kind of benchmark at the start of the 
game to see how fast the machine is running. Then you can add some code 
slowing things down.

Dual Playfied is OK, as long as you put a "Wait Vbl" immediately 
before the Dual Playfield statement, otherwise you usually get a 
corrupt screen display.

That has been said on the list, yes. But I guess that depends on how you
make use of the playfield. If it's just for SIMPLE things like this,
you wouldn't have to meet any problems.

If Roy Antonsen doesn't know about the amiga too much, he should know this
when using the dual playfield, you'll have no more than 8 colors per field.
However, the sprite-method would not have this problem.

Also, but using the 'copy' command in a certain bitmap, you might have
the text in the list scroll 'over' the background, taking the color of the
background at that spot, just dimmed or lighted.
This can easily be done using 'halfbrite'. This like that look quite nice and
don't take too much time (none that you'd be aware of, actually).

Hi,

A few years ago I started writing a Dynablaster clone. After 
writing a bit of the map editor, the game suddenly 
transformed into a Sim City clone, and became SIMpliCITY. I 
havent touched to the code for about a year now, but i have 
a sudden urge to continue the project. SO far, the map 
scrolling is in place, as well as disasters such as fire, 
plague, pollution etc. And fire stations, police, power etc. 
Evem a little bus that roams around the streets! The players 
popularity is worked out from these factors, and other stuff 
such as tax rates etc, and people "move" in and out of the 
housing blocks etc. And, strangely for my programming, most 
of it works fine! I've nicked bits from lots of games so 
far, such as the "solar eclipse" from Utopia, except in my 
version, there IS an eclipse..if you have no power stations, 
the screen goes black, but if you have power, the the 
buildings and vehicles light up. Anyway, the point to this 
huge ramble is: has anybody got any good ideas they would 
like to see put into a Sim City style game? Anything 
really..disasters, miracles, alien invasions..oh, no, got 
them already! Email your suggestions to : pl@soton.ac.uk

Ta.

Lud.

P.S. In case anybody thinks otherwise..yes, it runs at a 
perfectly acceptable speed...in fact, it runs too fast on an 
 expanded A1200!!

Hi Paul,
   I read the other day your looking for 1.12 owners to test you 
auto.config prog.  Well if you can send me detail on how to get the 
program from your E-Mail in to amos I'll be happy to test it for you. 


Hi everybody else,
    Why has everybody started sending their progs embedded into 
E-Mail?  Its a pain and it makes the files I have to download 
extremly big.  Just remember 4k limit.  Also some of us have to pay 
per bit, so please if you have a prog mail a message and let those 
who want get in touch or put it on AmiNet.

Well thats my winge out the way for this year. 
(good news about Amiga coming back on line eh?)

 Hello all out there on the list..

 I am a new User here on the list and my first try to ask something was
 not successfull because there went somthing wrong with the message..
 sorry !

 So first the technical things: I have an A1200 with Blizzard 1230 III
 with 50 MHz and 4 MB of Fast Ram. I use Amos Pro 2.0,Compiler 2.0 and
 I use the (great) AMCAF and AMIPS extensions.

 I have a little Problem. I wrote a BBS Tool which runs perfectly,BUT
 I am not able to get any Character on the BBS Screen (FastCall) WHILE
 my program is executing. I used the WRITE CLI Command from AMCAF and
 with this command I can get my Chars on the screen,but only AFTER my
 Program has ended !! So there is a blank screen after the user uploaded
 something and after my program has ended the Grafix come to the screen..
 but this is lazy,of course I want to make some Info - screens like
 "PLEASE HAVE PATIENCE" or something like that !! So has anybody an
 Idea how to get my Graphics on the BBS Screen WHILE my Program is
 executing ??

 I just could use the FastCall AREXX-Port but there is no command in
 AMOSPRO to SEND any Messages to an AREXX Port (Just only the ANSWER
 Command).. I heared from an LDOS extension or something like that..

 If it is possible to SEND an AREXX Command to a port then could anybody
 e-mail this LDOS extension (is it an extension?) to me ??

             THANXX

What version of AMOS Pro are you using?  I have an A1200, and when I was 
using verision 1.12, I had to boot up in a non-aga mode, otherwise I 
would get those weird screens.  However, with version 2.0, I don't have 
to do that anymore.

Mark (and everyone else):

I'm using version 1.? (I think it's 1.1). I'd like to upgrade to version 
2.0, but according to the mailing list, the only way to do this is to get 
the AMOS Pro Compiler, and as I mentioned in my original message, I can't 
seem to get a copy.

I have tried booting up in a non-AGA mode, and it does work, but this 
presents it's own problems. I have Emplant installed, which performs some 
kind of "double boot." Therefore, I have to disable my startup-sequence 
to retain my manual boot settings, or they are overridden during the 
second boot. I know that it must be possible to alter my startup to 
selectively include items that I need, but this seems like a great deal 
of trouble.

Anyway, thanks for your reply, and I'd very much like to hear from anyone 
else with a suggestion (particularly regarding the Compiler, since this 
should solve my problem.)

Thanks,
<<< Les <<<

	In my endeavour to make my program consume as little
memory as possible, I have generated a small problem. Firstly I
am compressing on disk all the graphics for the 3d maps in my
game so when I need a certain graphic it is loaded into a bank,
uncompressed and then I copy certain portions of graphic data
into their respective icons. The error occurs when I attempt to
Make Icon Mask on the icons that I have just copied the data to.
It tells me that it is out of memory when I know for a fact that
there is a goodly sized chunk of memory available (~700K). The
icons are already reserved from the beginning of the program and
I am simply copying the graphic data from the bank that it was
uncompressed into, over to the start of the icons data area given
by Icon Base + 10(skipping over the size/depth info). The bank I
am loading the data into is easily large enough to hold the
uncompressed data so there is no overwriting of memory. This
error only cropped up recently when I decided to compress the
image data. Does anyone have any idea what may be causing my Out
of Memory Error?

I have a screen which is 640,256,16,Hires, and I unpack an IFF to this
screen, and this IFF contains is also the graphics on top of the list.
So far, the music-list is a part of this IFF too, but I'm thinking of
making the list into a BOB, so I can scroll the BOB up and down. I've
already made a scrollbar, with a sprite.

Thank you, I already know this, and as I use a 16 colour hires screen,
dual playfield is out of the question.

Well, what about making the list into a bob, and scrolling it with 'Y
Mouse' ? But I guess I would have to Double Buffer the screen to aboid
flicker, and as I also have a text-part on the same screen, the text-
thingie would be slow.

How about "KillAGA Amospro" ??? I haven't used that (i have Amospro2.0)
but it sould disable AGA features...

Jep, sometimes it is better put 2*"wait Vbl" or "Wait 1 and wait vbl"
combination, i dont know why, but 1*waitvbl is not sometimes enough...

Greetings,

Can someone tell me where Amos (Creator, if it's not the same for both)
stores the pointers to the GFX, Intuition, DOS, etc libraries that it always
opens?  I want to use some Graphics.library functions in an extension for my
game, and it would be a bit redundant to re-open the library myself in the
extension routines, if as I believe Amos opens the GFX lib all the time.

Thanks.

Seumas

The garbled screen phenomena could be caused by using interlace

MC> is there anyone writing a REAL Aga extension for AMOS & AMOS Pro?

Using a Intuition extension, you can get Real AGA, or even more: real
24bit screens with graphic boards.

AGA sprites is some problem: Due to the way the hardware uses DMA to
display the spritedata on the screen, the more you go left with your
screen (or only use hareware scrolling), the more sprites
disappear...

For this reason, I think that sprites on an intuition screen are
obsolete (moreover, most graphic cards do not support hardware
sprites except the mouse sprite).

I've got no idea how to fix this... I have to ask some more people
first and see what can be done.

Doesn't this BBS-Software come along with some library containing
such functions as well? Could be IMHO easier to use these
functions...

No, that is the old one that no longer exists.  This is the only one and I
have no idea why they have not updated it.

Yes I know this :-) Kick 1.3 is required for the object modeller

However, it's not legal to use a Kickstart 1.3 image file without

IMHO some memory has actually been overwritten, although you have
taken great care of the size of the memory blocks. This could cause a
memory list to be corrupted. Use "Avail Flush" to check the size of
the largest chip memory chunk.

Which command do you use to decompress the image data? Could you
please send in the specifiy piece of code you use? Thx.

Include the |wequ.s file and look after T_IntBase, T_GfxBase,
T_LayBase and T_FntBase. These are the negative offsets to the
pointers from the amos system data base, and this pointer is stored
in Areg(5).

weird thing with the "include" statement in amos pro...
it appears to 'upset' the amos_pro_monitor, resulting in instructions being
inapropriately interpreted; the "next instruction:" line often diplayes half
a statement or just the last couple and a half parameters, if it displays
anything at all.... the marked block with arrows [>>>] indicating the next
statement to be examined is not displayed at all and the scroll function
does not track the source as it's being interpreted.....
and finally to top it all of it just lock up, nothing works anymore not
even ramiga-a..... and i have to reboot...
has anybody experienced this too ???
is there a work-around ( apart from merging the included file into the file
to be edited ) ?????
thanx

	Well I'm back after a long break from the old Amiga (not
 that anyone really cares :) ) and I've decided that for the 
 next 2 months I will due one of the following:

	1. work on a Game or Demo (in C)

	2. or work on MARP

	For those of you that may not know, MARP was a project 
 started sometime in december that I put on hold because of
 school and the fact that Amiga was dying was no great 
 inspiration either.  MARP is a C library of commands, similar
 to Amos.  It's like having the functionality of Amos but
 with the power of C.  Not to mention OS friendly and AGA.

	Anyways, the purpose of this post is for me too find
 out whether or not the MARP project is a worthwhile one.  When
 I first started only about 10 people showed any interest, and
 I'd rather not waste my time if no one even will use MARP.

 To use MARP you will need a C compiler and you will need to
 know C but you won't have to know the Amigs OS much more
 that you do for Amos.  If there is interest in MARP and the
 amiga hasn't died completely I will also code an interpreter
 to interpret some Amos like Basic language. 

	If anyone is interested in MARP, that means that you
 would actually use it, be willing to pay for it ( this
 doesn't even mean I would charge for MARP but you would
 have to be interested enough to spend 15-20 bucks ) then
 please reply back to me and fill out the survey at the end
 of the message. 

	MARP, currently has about 100 fcns that let you open
 screens, draw gfx, use amos icon banks, use iff ilbm pics, handle
 input (ie. mouse/joystick), etc.  There are also no limit on
 "banks", that is you can have multiple icon banks. Plus tons
 of other stuff, like developer routines and on-line help.

	Anyways thanks for reading this...

				Mike

-------------------------MARP SURVEY------------------------------

1. Should MARP support:

	[ ] only OS3.x
	[ ] OS2.x and OS3.x

   (no MARP won't support OS1.x)

2. Should MARP support:

	[ ] only AGA machines
	[ ] AGA and ECS/OCS machines

3. Should there be current objects to which operations are applied or
   should the object have to always be supplied with the operation?

	[ ] "M_CurrScreen(0); Circle(M_MouseX(),M_MouseY(),30);"
	[ ] "Circle(0,M_MouseX(),M_MouseY(),30);"

4. Would you like MARP to be:

	[ ] One object module the you link with
	[ ] Seperate object modules that let you choose which
	    parts of MARP you want to use (possibly have a GUI
	    interface to make this easy)

Thanks, also please give me any ideas or comments.  Remeber this is
the time to tell me if you want any functions.

Hi all, I was wondering if anyone could give me a copy of the Amos Pro
compiler shell program since mine was just lost in an accident in which
my only copy of it now has an error,(ya I know I should of used a backup), 
I recently had a hard drive crash, and when I went to re-install the compiler
the install disk has an error on the shell program.

If someone could just mail me a copy of it I would be greatly appreciative.

thanks

Hmm, there are lot of people who dont have access to Amoslist,
but surely would be more than happy if you make this MARP...
So please continue you work.....

Sprites, bobs, screenoffset, doublebuffer etc...????
Mayby special copper support, (chunkycopperscreen) (its already
done by us, with AmosPro+Asm, but it would be nice have it
in function form...)

If you want betatester (and moral support), please choose me!
I have long time Amos(Pro) user, short time C,E,Asm user.
Current software: AmosPro+ProComp, SAS/C6.55, GCC, E, PhxAsm4.xx
Btw, is GCC support possible?? (I assume you develop MARP to SAS/Dice??)

Hi all, I have two questions, I'm hoping somebody could help me with:

1.  I need 8 way smooth scroling using tiles. Is this going to be possible
    in Amos? I've used the turbo v1.9 extension, but in only has commands
    to scroll left and right(aargh!!), I've seen the demo for turbo plus, can
    it do smooth scrolling up and down as well, it sure seems to do it left
    and right nicely.  I have seen 8 way scrolling in an Amos game, 'High
    Octane' seems to have it in two windows at the same time no less! anyone
    know what was done in this game?(it uses the turbo v1.76)

2.  Okay now a totally diffeernt question, I am working on a palette editor
    and I want to do RGB - CMY - HSV, I have no problem with RGB and CMY
    (CMY being just the color opposite of RGB), but HSV has totally eluded me
    I sort of understand the theory behind it, but havent' a clue as to how
    to code it.  What I need is a routine that would go betwween RGB and HSV
    and vise-versa.  Can anybody help me with this one?


    Any help on these problems woult be greatly appreciated

thanks.

	Is it official that no AF AmosPro results have become
available? What sort of game did you enter? Have they made a
statement as to when they think they will be deciding the contest
winner?

INTOS:
I've just read a so called "report" on INTOS in a local Amiga magazine.
 From what I gather it is not an extension, but a set of procedures that you
load up when writing your program.
Does any one one the list have this INTOS, and what is it like? Is it true
workbench, or does it just simulate the grey screen?

Andy: if you send me any advertising info you've written on your extension,
I'll submit it the magazine for publishing. This way people will know they
have a choice, what options are available, how it stacks up against INTOS,
etc. Who knows, maybe you'll get a few orders from it!


WB 1.3 to 2.X
I've just got the newer WB, and notice a few changes on how it affects
amos.
Under WB1.3 ,[A]+A will switch you back to the workbench, but under 2.X it
will not unless you have another program running. ie, you can't flip over
and open up a task unless it is already running.
Has anyone else noticed this?

To me they (AF) replied that results are in AF75, so we have to
wait month or two :( 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Attention!! If someboby finds AF75, please post contest results
here!!!!!! Thank you!

We (MellowChips) made some sort DungeonMaster style SciFi splatter
with bit of strategy element (not much, yet :) named: BloodFest
3 levels, few weapons, lots of blood and dead meat stays in scene :)
Should run with 2Mb Chipram (or 1MbChip+1MbFast..i hope)..My part for
game was half of all graphics....

If you want see some our previous work, look from (aminet) game/misc
game named Pucman2 Worlds, (Our group name was at that time Mystic, but
because some other used same name, we are now MellowChips....)

Actually, MARP is a very good idea, but currently, I don't know C
very well, and even more, I'm planning a new basic *compiler* for the
amiga with the easyness of AMOS but the possibilities of C and full
(and only) intuition support.

However, I'd like to fill the survey anyway ;-)

MS>    (no MARP won't support OS1.x)

Kick 1.3 is really obsolete and should not be supported anymore. This
is a very good opinion of yours. But even Kick 2.0 would be a lossy
base for such a programming language, if you think of such things as
'Locale' or 24 bit colour format etc.

MS> 2. Should MARP support:
MS> 
MS>     [X] only AGA machines
MS>     [ ] AGA and ECS/OCS machines

ECS is obsolete. However, most gamers only have OCS/ECS machines, and
despite MARP is especially for Games-writers, this is a very
difficult decision.

After thinking a bit about this, ECS machines should be supported to
that extent, that the graphic modes are available and can be used,
but as Kickstart 3.0 has to be mounted, users of ECS machines like
A3000+gfx cards will be very glad to see the games work on their gfx
cards.

My suggestion: Make it as system friendly as possible, provide every
program with an ASL screen selection requester and everybody would be
happy ;-)

MS> 3. Should there be current objects to which operations are applied or
MS>    should the object have to always be supplied with the operation?
MS> 
MS>     [X] "M_CurrScreen(0); Circle(M_MouseX(),M_MouseY(),30);"
MS>     [ ] "Circle(0,M_MouseX(),M_MouseY(),30);"

I'd prefer the upper solution in *this* case. But the other version
could be more useful in other cases (e.g Plot/Point?)

Hi!

Thanx to everyone who sent me suggestions for Simplicity, i have loads of great 
new ideas! Quite how im gonna program them all is another thing.. :)

One idea everybody suggested was having multiple cities.  A good idea, but 
perhaps a little to proccessor hungry. I didn't explain the plot of the game actually : 
Basically, its an "The Earth is dieing, find a new planet" thing. And of course the 
planet has aliens, who dont want you taking over. This is my cunning plan, as now 
to got with the Sim City elements, i can add in factories producing weapons, etc, 
and do a DuneII/Utopia bit as well. And now with factories (and all the other 
processing plants) there may be excess stock, so this can be sold off to other 
planets. Of course, with it being set in space, there is lots of scope for disasters.. 
missile attacks, meteor showers etc :)

Take the viewpoint and sim elements of Sim City, add the Spying from Supremacy, 
various chunks from Utopia, combat sections from Dune II, trading from Frontier, 
music from Enigma (!!!),  and that (hopefully) will be Simplicity. Which is worrying 
cos it doesnt sound simple at all so i may have to change the name! :)

Thanx everyone..ill keep you informed of progress. Oh, that is after i get back from 
the Canary Islands in 2 weeks time <grin>.

Ludwig

Thanks to all who sent suggestions re: finding a copy of the AMOS 
Professional Compiler. I tried Northwest Public Domain, Now 
Zip(per?)ware, but they no longer have and can no longer get the program.

I finally did get it through Software Hut in Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, 
one of the disks (the Compiler disk, naturally) was corrupt, and I am 
awaiting a replacement.

In the meantime, I was able to upgrade AMOS Pro to version 2, so I'm no 
longer having the problems that I've been pestering you about.

Subject: bank swapping
Status: RO
X-Status: 

I've a a huge load of bobs for a game I'm writing. They will not all fit
into one bank. I've split them up into several files.

My trouble is that I can't seem to load them into the program into
different banks.
ie the first lines of my program are:

Load "bobfile1.abk",1:rem works OK
Load "bobfile2.abk",20 :rem causes I/O error at line 95! when it only has 2
lines.

Each file is 1528020 bytes long.
The finished program will have 6 banks this size and be swapped for super
smooth animation.
Any help would be appreciated.

  The Load command uses the "bank" parameter differently.  (Once more,
Francois shows his stupidity.)  Try this:

Load "bobfile1.abk",0 : Rem Load first set of bobs as a new bank
Bank Swap 1,20 : Move it to another slot
Load "bobfile2.bak",0 : Rem Load second set of bobs as a new bank
Bank Swap 1,20 : Rem Swap first set back to bank 1 and second into bank 20

>Each file is 1528020 bytes long.

  And you have enough memory for all that?  I'd be lucky to fit three into
my system. <sigh>

 This is to the guy with the Bob bank problems. First off, did you ever
read the User Guide, or are you using one of the cover disk versions?
The reasons you are having trouble are many.

 1. Only bank 1 can be used for Sprites and Bobs. But under Amos Pro
    you can swap banks at will, I dont know about other versions.

 2. Your banks are too large! A max of 2 Meg CHIP is what Amigas have.
    Your banks are 1.5 Meg in size. All graphix and sound go into Chip
    Ram. If you plain on using any other graphix or sound you wont have
    any space for them.

 3. Many Amigas only have 1 Meg of Chip Ram. If you wont most users to
    be able to play your game you must stay below 1 meg of chip ram
    used. And remember just opening a screen to display your bobs will
    take CHIP Ram.

 Here are my hints for you. If it is a multi level game make different
bob banks for each level and load them when needed. Most other games
work in the level type or sections of play modes. So you should be able
to cut the banks into the sections needed. If you are going to use the
paste command to make backgrounds use Icons instead and remove the Icon
bank when its not needed. Also the less colors you use in the bobs the
smaller the bob banks will be.
 I hope this helps some.

                                    jeff.webb@the-matrix.com

Sorry for not quoting, but my off-line mail reader wont allow the long
internet mail address for this list. anyone know of one that will?

This is the case only, if the workbench screen is closed on the start
of AMOS. The Amiga-A function normally (sometimes it does, though)
does not reopen the Workbench Screen when pressing Amiga-A.

 My undying gratitude goes out to Chris Hodges for his example of an
keyfile in Amos, found in the last Amos-list. I have already run out
to the libaray for Encryption books.
 Does anyone have the dox to Paul Hickman's Easylife 1.10 in txt or
asii format? I cant install the guide Help system because I'm still at
Amos Pro 1.12. The Pro compiler is not to be found. I have tried for
months now. I just read were someone found it at Software Hut. That
ticks me off because they told me they didn't have it and could not get
it anymore, and that was over a month ago. I will try them again. If I
take the time to convert the Easylife dox to printable format, if
someone has not already, would anyone else like them? That is if
Mr. Hickman does not mind.
 I down loaded the Anim2bob program from Aminet and tried everything I
could think of to get it to work. After I installed the Amospro.library
version 2.0 (witch came with some other prg on the net) it quit asking
for it and started Guru'ing my system. There were no dox with it so I
could be trying to run it wrong. I tried running it from Amos, Guru.
Then as a Accessorie, Guru. Has anyone with a A1200 got it to run? My
system is A1200 2meg Chip 4meg Fast 68882 FPU 33mhz with Amos Pro 1.12
with Easylife 1.10 and JD extensions.

err.....opps.
The docs are in the program. On retrospect that was probably not a good
idea, since if the program doesn't work, you can't read the docs.
The reason it Guru's is because I used Turbo extension commands in it. I
complied it orginally as a WB executable and tested it on the different
machines of my friends. It booted and ran OK. I thought it was fine....so I
then recompiled it as a AMOS COMPILED prog so that the bobs would be stored
to it, which could then be saved out as a bob or icon bank by the object
editor.
Seemed a good idea at the time.....
Problems? yep. I didn't realise that the AMOS COMPLIED differs from the
AMOS WB executable. The amos compiled requires that you have all the
extensions that the program expects on your system (I could ,at this point
start blameing Mr Lionet again, but every one else does, so I'll give it a
rest).
So, trying getting the Turbo extension off aminet if you are in a hurry.

If not, I'll be releasing another version ASAP, that fixes this problem.

Any one got it to work? Any more bugs or suggestions?

That shouldn't stop you - the AMOSPro help supplied is for V2.00 in
that it is a guide conversion of the V2.00 documentation, but the 
viewer software should still run on an version of AMOSPro. (Although
I've now had E-Mails from 7-8 people for whom it doesn't run at all - 
except a new version in the future :-( )

No problem - I think there are guide -> text converters on aminet.

 Hi there ...

 It seems that nobody can help me getting my chars on the BBS screen.
 I found a way.. I only need a handler for the screen so i could start my
 compiled program with `PROGRAM >HDL: Options` .. but I do not have any
 knowledge of writing such a handler like NIL: or something like that.
 A other one told me I could edit the AUX handler.. but HOW??

 Well this would be the easiest way for me,but I can also use the library
 comming with the BBS Program.

 But now my Question:  HOW DO I CALL SUCH A LIBRARY FUNCTION ??

        In the library docu I read the following lines:


  Function: Typefile(Port,Filename)
                      d0     a1

  Offset  : -114

       
  I know I have to open the library with `LIB OPEN` ... but how do I call
  this function of the library correctly ???? Can anybody type a little
  listing???

           Thanxx..

 Now that I've recived some responces from the list I know that my mail
is getting thru, so here is my info (like anyone cares) and my first
batch of questions.
 My name is Jeff Webb and I'm an old gezzer (33). I joined this List
because I'm a big fan of Amos and I find power basic programing easier
than ML, which I can't afford to get into yet. I own an A1200 (spec's
are below in my sig) and program for the pleasure of it. I have Amos
Pro Version 1.12 (Registered no Coverdisk here) and am looking for the
Compiler, any Idea's where I can find it? I'm going to call Software
Hut this morning, but any other info would be great to have. I've read
two of the Amos-lists from aminet and will get the rest as soon as this
mail goes out. They are great! I just wish more of them were up like
the Imagine list in 3D, 0-Present day. By the way if you are into 3D
rendering get them they talk about more than just Imagine.
 I have been programing for a little over a year in Amos, mostly on one
program. Yeah I know a year is a long time but its been off and on,
mostly off. I programed on the C= 64 for years before I got my first
Amiga, in both Basic and Assembly Language so Amos was my first choice
on the Amiga. And I now find myself in need off help with my program.
 The program is a game (big surprize right?) that some of my friends
and I miss from the old C= 64 days. I'm writting a new version of Modem
Wars that I call CommBatt. It will be modemable only, and more like
DuneII than Modem Wars. From reading some of the recent post it seems
I'm not the only one who thought DuneII was a great combat game. Sorry
if it bothers anyone that I'm also doing a DuneII ripoff. But this is
combat only, and only modem to modem. As far as I know theres nothing
like it for the Amiga. It will be compatable with all systems from the
500 to the 4000 if at all possible. Which means 512K Chip and 512K Fast
maximum for the finished product (Any comments on that?). I also would
like it to be NTSC and PAL compatible. Theres a question coming up
about that one. Well thats the general idea of the thing.

 Now here are my questions...

1. I read some were that the serial control in Amos left alot to be
   desired. If this is true can anyone recomend an extension that will
   solve any problems?
2. Has anyone written Term like software in Amos that I could look at
   for hints? I will need FAST transfer to keep the game in step on
   both machines. Any authors will get credit for any help or code.
   Mr. Chris Hodges and Paul Hickman are already in the List.
3. Are there any PD or Shareware Music Bank editors that work like
   Protracker avalable? Or is anyone a good MOD writer? I can pay for
   a PT MOD that will convert into a Music Bank. Maybe even two.
4. Because of the way Amos handles the Serial input/output should I
   forget Proc's and Gosub's and use conditional variables with only
   Goto's in the Main Game Loop for maximum speed?
5. If I degrade my A1200 to a 50 Hrz screen refresh and a 50 Hrz system
   timeing rate will this allow me to test for true PAL Compatability?
6. How much will the timing change once the program is compiled? Will I
   need timing flags to keep things in step once its compiled? Lots of
   bob animation in this thing.
7. How many bobs is it safe to use above the default settings? Or
   should I stick to my original plains of just 25 units max per side?
8. Is it okay to use Zones on a Double Buffered screen or should I use
   Mouse corridnates?

 Well thats all my questions for now. But I'm sure there will be many
more before I finish this game. Opps just thought of one more.

9. Does this sound like a good game? Or will just me and my local
   friends be playing it?

 If anyone wants to answer me but not post to the list, for instants
about the mods files. My Internet Email address is at the top of the
following sig.

NEW AMOS PRO GAME ON AMINET - ULTIMATUM -
                              ^^^^^^^^^

LOCATION - game/shoot directory on Aminet. At the moment the only site I 
know for sure it is on is at ftp.luth.se
                             ^^^^^^^^^^^

   Ultimatum is a 3D tank game (using Amos 3D) in the vein of Battlezone and 
Cybersled. You play the Vindicator Rick Murphy and must fight Eight 
opponents - Seven Transgressors and their leader Traxxion. Each fight is 
one on one and takes place within the city's Battle Arena. The game is 
very fast and furious and includes:

   - A full 3D arena
   - Intelligent and varied opponents
   - Standard Laser and Missile weapons
   - Over 10 special Power-Ups and Extra-Weapons
   - Digitised Speech for the Opponent, Commentators and Crowd
   - Digitised Sound Effects
   - Full Music score
   - Practice mode
   - In-game Help Screens
   - AmigaGuide documentation
   - Options to suit your playing preferences.

Machine Requirements:
	- 2 meg ram 
	- _should_ work on any Amiga
	- hard drive or floppy installable.

* If you have a fast Amiga, then you may find the bottom part of the 
screen flicker. To correct this, go to the Options screen and bring the 
Game Speed down a notch or two (ie a value of 1 or 2).


NOTE: ULTIMATUM IS A SHAREWARE GAME - SEE DOCUMENTATION FOR MORE INFO.

All comments and suggestions are welcome.
Email me at co314519@student.uq.edu.au

 I think I will be waiting for the next version. All thats on Aminet
is a Demo of Turbo extension. I found Turbo1_9.lha on ftp.gate.net but
the archive was bad. It only lost one file, something.var, so I was
going to install it anyway untill I found out it had no dox.

Hey people does anyone know how to define global functions, in other words, you define a function with def fn which can be used across procedures ? normally Amos forgets them when you jump into a different proc.

This is my first time writing to the list.  My name's John,
and I program on Amos the Creator v1.36.  I'm now working
on two projects--a HTML reader set of procedures, and a really
cool baseball game.

I wanted to know what Public Domain and Shareware Extensions
are out there for Amos and AmosPro (as I use the AmosPro
Compiler to compile my programs)?  I'd also like to know
why whenever I compile a program with Turbo commands (v1.9)
it crashes when I exit?  I use an Amiga 500 with 512k chip/
512k fast.  Is it an incompatibility problem?  Thank you.

  Use Lib Open/Call/Close.  For your example:

>  Function: Typefile(Port,Filename)
>                      d0     a1
>  Offset  : -114

'Open the library.  <Channel> is a "file number" just like with Open, etc.
'<Version> is the lowest version of the library you can use, or 0 if you
'don't care.
Lib Open <channel>,"whatever.library",<version>
..
'Set up registers and call the function.
FILENAME$=FILENAME$+Chr$(0) : Rem Strings must end with a null character
Dreg(0)=PORT
Dreg(1)=Varptr(FILENAME$)
RESULT=Lib Call(<channel>,-114)
..
'Close the library when we're done with it.
Lib Close <channel>

Hi all

 I just joined this list to see how much traffic here is and to ask some
questions.

 I have done quite a many programs with Amos, with Knights (at Aminet) 
being the only so far released, and I'm having a big project now (165 KB
text source and growing..) which will be soon available from my home page.

 But question about constants:

 Does any Amos version/compiler support TRUE constants, not stupid variables
that are simply not modified?

 And is Pro compiler more efficient than Amos compiler? (I am using Amos
1.36 and have been completely out of ide4a what's going on Amos scene) That
one-pass compilation is quite a joke... (as is most of Amos anyway, wish
I had learned to code graphics in C..)

Well, I've started reworking the bug ridden beta version.
More features, better user interface, options.
I think it works this time, but, once again, I need a beta tester.
This time, I'd like feed back from the tester, not like last time!

If anyone wants to beta test it, let me know.

	I don't know how to use Harcol either and I also agree that the
	point x,y method is pretty much useless to.

	What I do is just set up a collison table... depending on what
	your doing this can vary... I just give a simple example...

	You can divide you screen up into sectors... say 16x16 pixel's

	Now create an 2 dimensional array that represents the sectors
	on the screen (ie. if you had a 320x192 screen then you
	would need array that was (320/16,192/16) )

	Now what you have to do is specify a 1 for a certain sector
	is it causes a collision and a 0 if it doesn't

	Once you have done that all you to do to find out if an object
	has collided is:

		If ( _ColTable( OBJX/16, OBJY/16 ) = 1 )
		 	we got a collision.
		else
			no collision.

	One bonus of using a somekind of MapEditor to create your
	background is that all you have to do is create a table
	for each tile.  That is, to check for collisons you just
	find out what "tile" the object is over and then look up
	to see if this "tile" causes a collison.

	Usally sectors of 16x16 or 32x32 are used.  If your game
	is designed so that the tile's or background is not really
	blocky. i.e. a moutine lanscape.  Then I suggest that you
	use the sector method for the intial quick test to see
	if there could be a collison in this sector.  Then use
	another method for testing for a collison within the
	sector.  Normally this is computed by AND'ing the collison
	masks (ie. Make Mask) of the object and the sector.  if the
	result is zero then there was no collison.

 I will beta test it for you. My mail server allows attached files.
I'm not afraid to crash my system a few times or even recover my HD
if it gets blown with a bad file write. I figured I would offer my
time because I was one of the ones it wouldn't work for the first
time. I wont hesatate to tell you if it dont work eather. If you
cant get it to me as attached mail UUEncode is fine also.

There is a list of extensions in the FAQ. Ask Michael Cox 
(mcox@access.digex.net ?) for a copy. I guess there would also be a copy 
of the FAQ on Aminet in dev/amos/ or on Andy Church's website 
(http://mmm.mbhs.edu/~achurch/amos/ ?).

Try EasylifeV1.10 on aminet (/dev/amos). It has plenty of string 
processing commands & structured variables which should be
of great help parsing HTML.

P.s. Checkout "http://www.sandia.gov/somethingorother"  (I can't 
remember the rest of the URL, and my WWW connection is down at the
moment) for a definitive HTML reference manual (And of course the
netscape extensions to HTML:

	"http://home.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/html_extensions.html"

That should be enough to put you of that idea ;-)

Exit the compiler or the program? If you mean the program, each 
extension has a rountine that gets called on program entry & exit, 
and the cleanup code in TurboV1.9 could be at fault. There is a 
rather hacky way of disabling the code, but that will cause turbo
not to clean up, and leave memory allocated. A better solution is
to get a version of Turbo Plus (Shareware).

  That's the reason.  The advantage of constants is that they don't require
variable references, and they allow a decent compiler to optimize code with
constants in it.  (Of course, AMOS is hardly a "decent" compiler...)

  And the amuont of time lost trying to work around AMOS's bugs.
Personally, I prefer C for most of my programming, particularly large
projects, because of its structured format and because the compiler doesn't
have any inherent bugs.  (There are always the bugs in the code I write,
but those can be fixed, at least.)

As most of you are aware, I wrote an article in the Dutch Amiga magazine, 
appropriatley called 'Amiga Magazine'. I have translated it, but do not 
think for a minute that I can write in English.

This article appeared in the Dutch magazine 'Amiga Magazine', issue 34 
(July/August 1995). It is copyright 1995 Branko Collin. Subscribers of 
the Amos Discussion List may have this article for personal use.

The translation was made from my draft version, so readers of Amiga 
Magazine that also subscribe to the Amos discussion list may notice some 
discreppancies.

Enjoy!

Amos and Internet

Internet can be useful for Amos programmers. The main reason for this is 
the existance of the Amos Discussion List. The subscribers talk about 
anything related to this basic variant. Often simple programming problems 
are mailed to the list, but also announcements of soon to be appearing 
software, discussions about what should be in new extensions and how Amos 
should be further developed. The special thing about this group of Amos 
users is that some of the top-developers are amongst them. Take Dominic 
Ramsey, programmer of a number of the official Amos Professional demos. 
Dominic managed to capture the attention of the British press with his 
program that successfully predicts the outcome of horse races - the 
program was written in Amos.
Paul Hickman is the author of the Easylife extension. It is the life of 
the professional programmer that is made easier with it. Easylife adds 
structured variables, pattern matching, console I/O and MUI 
compatibility. But those readers that did not understand a thing of the 
last sentence need not dispair. Paul also added some helper programs that 
anybody can use. Amongst these are a variable checker and an Amiga Guide 
viewer. For the latter he converted the Amos Professional on-line 
documentation.
Andy Church maintains the Procedure Library. Have you ever had the 
feeling that you were re-inventing the wheel with a certain procedure you 
were writing? Then there is a chance that someone else has added that 
procedure to the Library. Amongst others it offers you routines for the 
manipulation of screens and palettes, using Bobs with AMAL and 
circumventing the archaic Input command.
Furthermore some projects are inspired by the threating expiring of both 
Amiga and Amos. Mike Sikorsky is working on MARP, Mike's Amos Replacement 
Project [NOTE: Now called M-Lib]. MARP is a library that contains all 
Amos commands as C-procedures. Mike tries to take over as much of the 
programming as possible, so that the Amos programmer's only task is 
converting Amos commands into C-procedure calls. He is even thinking of 
taking away this last task by adding a conversion program. People about 
to leave the Amiga can still benefit from this project, as there are 
plans to make versions for both MS-DOS and X-Windos environments.
The other big project is called ADT, Amos Development Team. A year ago a 
rumour on the net said that Europress would make Amos' source public 
domain. The ADT got founded by the list's subscribers to coordinate the 
further development of Amos. Nobody would benefit from a proliferation of 
badly coded 'improved' Amos versions. Europress did not come true, but 
the ADT still exists. Now the members concentrate on inventing a whole 
new programming language that contains all the good of Amos and more. The 
ADT is of course open for all suggestions.
Besides all this serious stuff people are of course programming games. 
People like Ben Marty (TechnoVenture), Christian Mumenthal (Colonial 
Conquest) and the members of Dark Unicorn Productions (Scorched Tanks) 
know what they are talking about and so they do.
The Amos Discussion List is maintained by Michael Cox. He is not a 
moderator, but keeps track of the subscriptions and the FAQ.

Those that have access to the Internet can subscribe by sending an e-mail 
to amos-request@access.digex.net, including the word 'subscribe' in the 
text. The language of choice is English. Not that it is obligatory to 
post in that language, but there are only a few Dutch subscribers, so...
There is also a website, maintained by Andy Church, at 
http://mmm.mbhs.edu/~achurch/amos/.

Some time ago I bought a memorycard with 4M for my A1200. Some software, 
however, crashes the machine when the available fast mem goes below 2M 
(coverdisks of Imagine, PixelPro, ImageFX, but also RAM:). With Imagine I 
can live with only 4M (2 chip and 2 fast), but PixelPro and ImageFX are 
hardly useable. I seemed to remember that some programs did work with my 
memory, but I could not remember which. So I wrote an Amos prog that does 
the following:
1. Reserve 3.5 M fast mem as a bank
2. Change all the bytes in the bank
3. Erase the bank

This program runs fine, except when I switch to the Workbench during step 
2; then the machine crashes.

What I would like to know is:
-Do you know how to fix my problem?
-(if not) Do you know what is different between the way Amos handles 
memory and Amigados/Kickstart/whatever handles it?
-(if the former has nothing to do with my machine crashing when switching 
to WB) Why does my machine crash when I switch from Amos to Workbench 
during the execution of above mentioned program?

I know this is hardly Amos related. I wanted to take it to an appropriate 
newsgroup, but if I tell them about my testprogram they probably want to 
know how Amos handles memory first.

I did BTW check with the in built analyis (holding both mouse buttons 
down on start-up) and with AIBB, but both thought all was fine.

Many thanx in advance,

 Your welcome. The crashing wasn't a hassel. I'm not happy unless I
try to force this thing to do the Impossible three or four times a
day, more on the weekends.

My latest amos-game Fantasy Forces is ready for betatesting..

Fantasy Forces is a strategic/tactical game similar to Lord of Chaos
but with many new features which make it better for multiplayer game 
(currently 2-4 players)

I am looking for ppl interested to betatest - mainly for fun but also
for bug-finding, and I would like to find someone with direct connection
to internet (like grapevine + DCC), so that game for 3-4 human players
maybe set up (turns are moved as savefile via DCC)

Complete archive is around 150 Kb and requires PAL (currently) and
possibly fast machine (I have 1200/020 and it is not too fast on it..)

In a nutshell: very fun game.. unfortunately I do not have enough friends
near to do all required testing so I search here, too

Send me email if interested

	Hi there AMOS users,

	This is my first message on this mailing list.  I am working on a
game in AMOS and I am using a collision table method for the main character
to see where he can walk in a screen made up of 16x16 tiles.  It is similar
to the method described in this list by someone else recently.
I am using normal collision detection i.e. bob col etc.
for collisions between the main character and other baddies and weapons, but
if the main character stands behind a block, his head protrudes from behind
the block and he can still get hit.  How can I ignore collisions to the top
part of the bob i.e. his head? Bob col detects a collision to any part of the
bob, so is it possible to detect collisions on a certain area of a bob?

	I was just wondering if it is typical for a main loop of a game to
consist of MANY "if" statements?  I am worried my main loop might become slow,
but it is the only way I can think of to achieve what I want.  I chose to
do everything the hard way, without AMAL.  But now I am thinking of using AMAL
to control some parts of the game, because it is too hard to do it another
way without using a LOT of IF statements and flags to keep track of
things in the game.  Any suggestions?  When people make commercial games, do
they use techniques similar to AMAL, i.e. run things under interrupt, or do
they do it by using flags and counters to carry out something (like an
explosion) which would last for several game loops?  Because keeping track
of say two players, several baddies, bullets, explosions and other things
without running them under interrupt seems like a very daunting task to me...

I've written a 4-player tank game in AMOS Pro.  I later
decided to add the option of computer control to the
tanks.  I did this and it worked fine when the program
wasn't compiled, but as soon as I compiled it, the AI
system didn't work.

For some reason the compiled version of

   for t = 85 to 89
      if key state(t)
         if AI(t-84)=true
            ai(t-84)=false
         else
            ai(t-84)=true
	         endif
      endif
   next t

The problem is that AI()(never "retains"
the value True.  The problem has something to do with
AMOS Pro not handling arrays correctly, since a simple
variable will work in this case.  I am very confused
however since I used many arrays to handle the non-AI
part of the game as well and that part still works.

Needless to say, I am very frustrated.  Any help would
be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance

First, the table method is a good one to use.  Excellent choice.

You also have to check baddies against the same table and invalidate 
their collisions witht he main character if they are in collision with 
a background element that renders the main character unreachable to the 
baddy's attack.

If you want speed or at least synchronization in your game, try to get 
all the objects working from AMAL.  AMAL scripts can pretty well written 
to do any sort of animation and can be controlled by the main program.  
The big thing about AMAL is that they are compiled and their equivalent 
IF statements execute several times faster than source code counterparts 
in the main loop.

They most certainly are using an interrupting system.  If have experience 
with this from my SNES programming endeavours.

I am afraid that I am not completely sure what the problem is here. I 
take it that after the detection of a collision you could either compare 
the coordinates of the main character and the baddie for illegal 
combinations (i.e. is it the head that is touched) or the coordinates of 
the main character and the block (i.e. has the character moved enough 
behind the block to be safe). If you chose for the latter, you could do 
that before the collision test and then, if the character is in a safe 
spot, switch bob-collision of. This way you only have to test for the 
collision if the character is near any danger and not in a safe spot.

Hello all!

I just subscribed to ask 1 question and after that I'll unsubscribe
so I'm not going to bother all of you with stupid questions...except
this one :)...it's not about programming in amos but about a little
proggy I had years back namely NIALL - Non Intelligen Amos Language 
Learner...so as the name says it was written in Amos I thought
amoslist is perfect place to ask this thing...the 
question is: Does anyone konw where I can get it or is it available 
for ftp or what ever...perhaps someone can even send it to me 
uuencoded... Hmm...maybe even the author reads this list...
I'd really appreciate if someone could help me out on this. Any 
clue about the program (or author) is welcome, thanx for your time, 
Bye!

+ 	I was just wondering if it is typical for a main loop of a game to
+ consist of MANY "if" statements?  I am worried my main loop might become slow,
+ but it is the only way I can think of to achieve what I want.  I chose to
< clic clac>

All my games include numerous if-statements in amin loops and no AMAL 
(except one old which has problems described below)
- and the speed is problem.. Knights (my game in Aminet) has about 7-8 fps
in a500 and it keeps track of all creatures, players and missiles in 
variables and draws all required in each update (of course it moves them
around in one big map, and frame rate would be better when no activity is
not done, but you must be ready for slowing, right?)

The problem with AMAL IMO is:

There is syncronizing problem! You must do all in AMAL or you have problem
when standard program starts to slow (if it has possiblity for that)..
For example, you set missile to fly 3 pixels/vbl and main loop update
time is 2 vbl. But if main loop slows down for some reason, the missile
will not, and that may cause problems unless you do everything timed in 
amal... like missile collision to walls/critters etc.

 
At least things was like that about 2-3 years ago when I last time looked
at AMAL :)

Hi. I'm having some trouble getting the AMOS Compiler working
under AMOS Pro v1.12. I have the extension installed and working
correctly (I have an old AMOS 1.36 program that uses the Unsquash
command which requires the compiler extension and it works fine),
but the compiler won't run for me.

I have my AMOS files in Workbench:Work/AMOS_System, and I have
modified the line in the compiler.AMOS program to:

DPATH$="Workbench:Work/AMOS_System"

But when I try to run the program, I get the message:

>>> Disc error: AMOS_System MUST be in the CURRENT drive. <<<

Any suggestions for getting this to work?

  Maybe the author hasn't bothered to upload it anywhere.  I don't know.

  Incidentally, you can access the AMOS files directly on my FTP site.  FTP
anonymously to dragon.mbhs.edu and go to the /amiga/amos directory.
Extensions are under the software/extensions subdirectory.

 No way would I do that. I had a so called friend release a beta
version of a game I wrote on the old C= 64 once. It spread like
wildfire, freeware was hard to get back then. When I released the final
version NOBODY wanted it! "It crashed my system.. ect ect" Six months
down the drain. I wouldn't do that to anyone.

 I've writen it already (the modem control part). Its not any different
than modems on the C=64's just lots faster. One or two extensions are
on the Aminet with serial control in them, I'll have to read AmosFAQ to
see which ones are for Pro.

 I've set the transfer speeds in the Modem config section, and all the
params that take configuration have choices. 28.8 is not an option. I
dont have one and dont think 28.8 is needed. Its direct modem to modem
only, I have no info on how to write stuff for a server. Its a Fighter
Dual Pro type game except with armies. I asked about term software so
I could see how others tackled this chore. After all why reinvent the
wheel?

 I have a lead on some custom music already but keep any info coming.

E> NO!!!! Never use Goto's. They won't speed up the execution by that

 I figured that out. When I first started this program I had just
changed from Commodore 64 basic to Amos, I was still in the Goto Gosub
frame of mind then. Now that I have looked at the manual again there
are many more elegaint ways to do the same thing. And like someone else
pointed out, if I need more speed than proc's will let me have I should
be writting in another language.

E> > 5. If I degrade my A1200 to a 50 Hrz screen refresh and a 50 Hrz

 I can get down to a real 50 hrz 50 hrz system, so PAL testing is not
a problem.

E> The only timing you'll need to use is the "Wait Vbl" command. This

E> This will irradicate any flicker as well (Supposedly!!!)

 Not true. A Ntsc system is at 1/60th of a second per screen refresh,
and Pal is 1/50th per refresh. I found info in an old AmosList that
say's will keep it at the same rate on eather system, so I'm gonna try
it out. Flicker is not a problem, I know how to do that right. Darryl
also reminded me to use Amal. Those two toghter should work.

E> > 7. How many bobs is it safe to use above the default settings?
[stuff killed]
E> ??? Experiment - see what works

 After looking at DuneII again I decided 25 units per side will be
fine. It will peobably get hairy enough for the players to keep up
with 25 units on the scrolling battlefield anyway.

 I was half asleep when I added that one. I've done it many times

E> Sounds groovy to me!!!

 Thanks.. after the last four days of rewriting I need all the
encouragement I can get. Can we say BUGS! What I really need now is
a Amos RAID,BLACKFLAG or ORKIN accessory to kill all these BUGS!

E> I hope this is of some use! I'm sure some of the other peeps in
E> the group will be able to give you a bit more in depth advice.
E> Don't give up though.

E> Tim.

 Any and all advice is useful at this point. Thanks for the responce
and tips. I'm going to take another look at my modem control sections
and fine tune them as much as possible, maybe the an extension. After
all this game is dead without it.

 If you think your rusty let me tell you, I could have oxidized into

Greetings AMOS Programmers!

This is a note to tell you that airTaxi, my AMOS game, made it into issue 
51 of Amiga Power (disk/mag).  It should be out in a couple of weeks.

Anyone still out there who hasn't tried airTaxi can get it from the 
Aminet, where I'll be posting the latest demo.

Enjoy.

I found their bug:  you can't assign boolean values to
an array (in compiled code.)

Another bug I've found over the years:  when writing
in AMAL, don't use the variable Z.  AMOS doesn't
like it.

I tried this and AMOS didn't start because it couldn't find APSystem. I 
tried adding:

Dir$="Workbench:Work/"

and 

Dir$="Workbench:Work/AMOS_System"

to the beginning of the compiler, and I got the same error.  I was 
looking at the code for the compiler, and it looks like this error is 
just the generic response to any file error. I suspect that I'm missing 
some files.

I had AMOS1.36 with the compiler on my old A500 a few years back, and I 
bought AMOS Pro when I got my A4000, and never bothered to install the 
compiler, and my A500 doesn't run anymore, although I still have all my 
original disks & manuals.

It looks like I need to install AMOS, then install the compiler, apply 
the updates, and copy the necessary files over to my AMOS Pro setup. 
Could someone who has gotten the compiler working with AMOS Pro tell me 
how you did it?

Thanks in advance,

	yes... what you have to do is supply a different collision mask
	for your main character... Amos will automatically make your
	collison mask for you with it's Make Mask command.. The Mask
	is as wide and as tall as your object, but is only 1 plane deep.

	This Mask contains a ZERO everywhere there was Colour 0 in your
	object and a ONE everywhere else.

	This Mask is used like I mentioned before.. basically the mask
	of 2 different objects are AND'ed together and if the result
	is NOT ZERO there was a collision.

	So to turn off collision detection for an object all you have to 
	do is Make its Mask all zero's. You can also of course just
	turn off or part's by setting ZERO's/ONE's as you choose.

	The probelm with this method is that Amos also uses the same
	mask to "draw" you object.. so if the Mask was all zero's
	nothing would be rendered... there are probably a number
	methods to get around this.. one simple way is to have
	a "phantom" object that tracks your main character, this
	phantom object is what could possibly be used for the
	swapping in and out of the Mask's... I wrote a procedure
	a couple of year's ago (I think :) ) that will create a
	Mask for any colour and explains how.. it is in the
	Procedure Library under MAKEMASK[]... but it was coded
	pretty badly.. I didn't know how then to use the blitter
	directly.. and I didn't know how to get Amos's Rastport
	then to use the OS calls... so I had to code it in a
	roudabout way.. 

	_MASK_LENGTH = Leek( Sprite Base( - object ) ) - 4
	_MASK_ADDR   = Sprite Base( - object ) + 4

	' note: could also use Icon Base() 

	Knowing the length and addr's you can know 'Copy' data
	into the mask or even fill it.. ie. 
	
		Fill _MASK_ADDR to _MASK_ADDR+_MASK_LENGTH,0

	This would clear out the mask.. 

	If you had Mask's stored somewhere (in CHIP MEM) then you
	could probably Poke at the sprite base to tell it your
	mask's address.. this way you would only ever have to
	swap a few pointers instead of whole masks but I never
	tried this..

	I would use your main loop to handle the game flow (ie. Bob Update
	Off/On, screen scrolling, collison detection etc.) and your Main 
        Character (the main guy/gal usally requires more flexibilty than
	AMAL provides normally... )

	I would then use AMAL to handle the anything else that moves..
	ie. bad guys/paltforms.. 

	What I do is handle AMAL myself.. you disable AMAL but set up
	your own interrupt (ie. Every 2 or something) and have this
	interrupt call your Enemy handler, at the beginning of
	the  routine, disable your interrupt (Every Off) and Enable
	it at the exit (Every On).. you don't want to be interrupted
	inside your interrupt routine :) Oh ya make the second
	last instruct Synchro (ie. Amal GO )

	What I do then, is update the AMAL registers of the active
	objects.. for example.. you could check to see if an
	enemy should fall (ie. there is no soilid object under
	it's feet -- walked off a platform perhaps :) )

	If it the enemy should fall you can set a particular register
	to 1 (ie. Amreg(object,0) = 1)... With Amal automatic updating
	of you can have 64 channels all with a set of their own register..

	Some object may need more register than others and have different
	meanings so you should also give your objects a type.. then
	all you need is one enemy handler to get everything working..

	You also need to launch your enemies.. this could be included
	with your map data or something..

	I can't say for sure.. but I would say Interrupts.. it's too
	much to 'control' in one loop properly.. you don't even need
	Amal.. you could code your own version..

P.S. I don't know if this will of use to anyone but here is how I
     handled Goomba's in my SMB game.. Basically I had an _ENEMY_LAUNCH
     routine that set up the enemy... then in the _ENEMY_HANDLER
     routine I just looped through the active enemies either deleting
     them (ie. fell to death) or updating registers..

 If you have the Easylife extension it has the step by step explanation
on how to do it. And yes you will need to first install the updates to
1.36 before you install it into AmosPro. It works for me.

Hope this helps.

PS. Still converting Easylife guides into Printable dox. Time is hard
    come by right now.

It was available on Aminet. I have a copy of it that I can uuencode and
send to you if you want.
It was written in AMOS, but it is compiled. I do not have the source for
it.
Does any one have the source?

I'm not quite sure if this is really the problem... Pressing the
desired key will 'flicker' the AI-array variable between 0 and -1.
Now if you compile the program, the flickering might become so fast,
that you don't notice the changing (?)

To prove your theory, simply add a Print AI(T-84) line within the
For-Next loop you specified in your mail. I hope this could help to
find out the actual problem. If not, try other variable names or
array sizes (and indexes).

The times of 512 KB Chip are over for many years now. 1 MB Chip

Use any Protracker version around (preferably 2.3b or 3.15), and use
any of these neat little extensions which can replay Protracker
modules directly. The musician will thank you for that.

[Commercial on]

The AMCAF extension provides real Protracker support, including
VBL/CIA timing, speed, volume controls, voice-toggeling, vumeters and
amos samples/instruments playing during the music.

Goto is obsolete. Gosub might be useful in some occasions (in fact, I

I think so.

Vertical Blank waits like Wait Vbl should keep everything in sync.
However, sometimes it's useful to unlink the graphical movement from
the actual calculations. E.g the game runs the same speed on every
computer, only the display gets a little bit yerkier on slower
machines. This is an important aspect with modem-games.

JW> 7. How many bobs is it safe to use above the default settings? Or

The default value is at about 64 bobs. But 25*2 bobs should suffice.

JW> 8. Is it okay to use Zones on a Double Buffered screen or should I use
JW>    Mouse corridnates?

You can use zones on Double Buffered displays savely.

JW> 9. Does this sound like a good game? Or will just me and my local
JW>    friends be playing it?

Yeah, it sounds very interesting. I had some great hours with Dune II
and the possibility to play some similar game against some other
human makes the game even more valuable ;-)

It seems as if your memory chips are a bit faulty. Try a

Maybe the changing routine overwrites some bytes of memory which you

This a problem I also encountered. When the workbench has been

rb> The following code opens a screen that pretty much looks like a barcode...

Yeah, it seems as if the modulo values have been set incorrectly so
they display a random line of memory over the whole display.

rb> Screen Close 0 : Screen Open 0,720,608,2,Hires : Flash Off
rb> Screen Display 0,96,16,720,608 : Curs Off

These are very odd values indeed. Please note:

1. The minimum y position is 26.
2. The width of the screen must be given in LOWRES pixels.
3. The opened screen is not an interlace one, so the maximum height
is 284 pixels.
4. The maximum creatable overscan for a hires screen is:

   Screen Open 0,704,288,2,$8000
   Screen Display 0,96,26,352,284

5. Note that with this overscan you only have the sprites 0,1,2,3 and
4 left.

Dear mailing-list readers,

I'm proud to annouce that a shareware demo version of the
AMCAF-Extension has now become available from AmiNet dev/amos.

Short:    A shareware version of the AMCAF ext
Author:   Chris@sixpack.pfalz.org (Chris Hodges)
Uploader: Chris@surprise.rhein-ruhr.de (Chris Hodges)
Type:     dev/amos

AMCAF - the next generation in AMOS programming!

At last, the new and powerful AMCAF (i.e "Amos Miscellaneous Commands
And Functions) extension is available for AMOS Professional. The main
extension file is more than 40 KB long and contains more than 200 new
commands and functions  for every day programming  with AMOS Pro. The
package consists of two disks which can be installed on harddisk very
easily  using the  supplied  installation  software. The  manual is a
200KB amiga guide document  and can be adapted to the AMOS Pro online
help (pressing  the  help-key  in  the  editor will  pop up  the full
description  of  the command). Moreover a  program to  read the guide
with kickstart 1.3 is also  supplied. Every AMCAF  user will  get the
required support and help he needs by either email or snail mail.

AMCAF contains commands for:

- Bank manipulation and encoding
- Turbo graphics
- Blitter control
- Shade Bobs/3D Stars/Splinters
- Fonts (e.g to put a normal text font into a bank and vice versa)
- Colour handling
- Rainbow fading
- Disk access (dir reading, filecopying etc.)
- Pattern matching
- Powerpacker and FileImploder support
- Time and date functions
- 4 player adapter support
- 3D vector rotation
- Protracker support (including CIA-timing and sfx commands etc.)
- Even more various commands.

The registered version of AMCAF is available for only 25 US$.
A german version is also available on request.

Download the archive to see the real power of AMCAF ;-)

+ aga-compatible (well, to some extent), Amos compiler executables not.

Now this thing needs more clearing - what do you mean? I mean, all my
programs done under amos1.36 (note version) work in my A1200 without
problems (they did not work until I updated Amos to 1.36)

Anyway, is pro compiler still completely commercial or has it been somewhere?
(like some cover disk or something)

	When writing AMAL scripts do you do it from within the AMOS 
source code, or is it better to use the AMAL editor and store the AMAL 
routines in an AMOS bank?

	So is it safe to say most games programmers use an interupt 
system?  The reason I was avoiding AMAL was because I read in a computer 
mag that you shouldn't use AMAL in your games, and I thought that 
techniques like AMAL were only used in AMOS to make it easier for people 
to program games.  So I thought that I might as well learn how to make 
games without AMAL so that when I learn a different language I won't have 
any trouble.

	I think the latter idea is a good one, i.e. if the player is in a 
safe spot, then turn off bob collision.  But can you turn it off for a 
single bob?  Because I would still want bob col on for the other player 
(2 player game). How about if the player is in a 'safe' position, then 
just ignore the collision instead of turning it off?

	How can you tell how many fps your game is running at?  I am 
checking everything every loop, do you think I should use if statements 
to only check some things evry 2 or 3 etc loops?

	What about not running AMAL under interupt and using the synchro 
command?  Would that fix up the problem?  I am still fairly new to AMOS 
so I am trying to find the best way to do things, but not necessarily 
the best way for AMOS, but the best way in general, so that when I decide
to change languages I can still apply the techniques and they will stil work.

	I never really thought of doing that.  I guess that could be 
effective, but probably not in my case, as my main character is quite 
small, so it might be a waste having a seperate bob for the head in my 
case, do you think?

 Is it just me or does Turbo 1.9 Crash everyones Amos Pro? Could it
be my 3.0 kickstart? How much is Turbo now? Is it fixed to run on
my system? Can I get it from Northwest PD?
 I read the dox to turbo and this is an Extension I want! Or maybe
that new one just posted to the list is just as good. I'll snag the
demo and give it a look.

 Please answer this if anyone can.

Is their an Serial Extension that works under Amos Pro 1.12? If so
what is its name and where do I get it?

About My Game, Chris Hodges said dis:

CH> JW> As far as I know theres nothing like it for the Amiga. It
CH> JW> will be compatable with all systems from the 500 to the 4000
CH> JW> if at all possible. Which means 512K Chip and 512K Fast
CH> JW> maximum for the finished product (Any comments on that?).

CH> The times of 512 KB Chip are over for many years now. 1 MB Chip
CH> memory can always be expected. And because it's a modem game, a
CH> normal user with a modem should have at least 2 MB of memory in
CH> total.

 Belive it or not a friend of mine had only 512 K Chip untill just a
month or so ago. But if 99.9% of the users have 1 MB Chip the other
0.1% will have to upgrade. The extra 512 K Chip will make thing's so
much easier. Come to think of it so will the other 512 K Fast. Thats
the way I'm going to go, 1 Meg Chip, 1 Meg Fast minimum.
Thanks for making up my mind on that.

CH> JW> help or code. Mr. Chris Hodges and Paul Hickman are
CH> JW> already in the List.

CH> How do I deserve this honour? ;-)

 Your example of KeyFile Encoding. Just what I needed to make
ditributing this game easy.

CH> I wanted to write some modem game some time ago but I didn't go
CH> very far :-(

 On the C=64 I could do it. In Amos it looks like it can be done. It
might even take untill the ADT (is thier still an Amos Development
Team?) upgrades Amos before its done. But I'm not giving up!

CH> Use any Protracker version around (preferably 2.3b or 3.15), and
CH> use any of these neat little extensions which can replay
CH> Protracker modules directly. The musician will thank you for
CH> that.

CH> [Commercial on]

CH> The AMCAF extension provides real Protracker support, including
CH> VBL/CIA timing, speed, volume controls, voice-toggeling, vumeters
CH> and amos samples/instruments playing during the music.

CH> [Commercial off]

 Sound's like just the ticket. I'm going to Aminet right now (well
after this post) and get it. If it's all you say it is (which I'm sure
it is) look for my payment soon!

CH> JW> 4. Because of the way Amos handles the Serial input/output
CH> JW> should I forget Proc's and Gosub's and use conditional
CH> JW> variables with only Goto's in the Main Game Loop for
CH> JW> maximum speed?

CH> Goto is obsolete. Gosub might be useful in some occasions (in
CH> fact, I like them more than procedures). The cpu power won't be
CH> drained too much when using gosubs.

 Don't hit me but when I started this program I had just graduated from
Commodore 64 Basic to Amos, and goto was still very much in my blood
back then. Now I look at my code and say 'Why did I do that?'. I had
not looked at my code in some time. But when I saw the Amos section on
Aminet I was inspired again. And this List is a great help.

CH> Vertical Blank waits like Wait Vbl should keep everything in
CH> sync. However, sometimes it's useful to unlink the graphical
CH> movement from the actual calculations. E.g the game runs the same
CH> speed on every computer, only the display gets a little bit
CH> yerkier on slower machines. This is an important aspect with
CH> modem-games.

 Could you give me an example of this please?

CH> JW> 7. How many bobs is it safe to use above the default
CH> JW> settings? Or should I stick to my original plains of just 25
CH> JW> units max per side?

CH> The default value is at about 64 bobs. But 25*2 bobs should
CH> suffice.

 After looking at DuneII again thats what I decided to stay with.

CH> JW> 8. Is it okay to use Zones on a Double Buffered screen or
CH> JW> should I use Mouse corridnates?

CH> You can use zones on Double Buffered displays savely.

 That was a bonehead question on my part. I have done it many times
before myself. Thanks anyway.

CH> JW> 9. Does this sound like a good game? Or will just me and my
CH> JW> local friends be playing it?

CH> Yeah, it sounds very interesting. I had some great hours with
CH> Dune II and the possibility to play some similar game against
CH> some other human makes the game even more valuable ;-)

 Thats my point of view also. Not to mention being able to call them
up and say ' Ha! Wiped you out Sucker!' has an appeal all its own.

What does the shareware demo lack that the registered version has?  Just
curious as I do support shareware (Intuition) but hope to try it out
completely.  Your product sounds like quite an achievment and the $25 fee
does not sound high at all.

I was not aware!  I don't own my own modem though :-(  I do all my mailing

    Oh!  I only have a PAL system!  AMAL is an odd little thing.  For some
things it is good, others it's not.  Something you'll have to experiment with
a bit.  Plug away though - AMAL I found to be useful for mundane tasks such as
moving missiles, baddies etc.

    You're not wrong.  I'm starting to get jealous!!!  I'm not going to be

AMOS gets very stroppy about unusually screen sizes sometimes,
particularly if they are very small, or very large. There is a 
vertical limit after which nothing works, but I can't remember if it 
is 512 or 1024 or something else. The ony advice I can give is don't 
go around writing programs and expecting them to work :-)

You could always go down to your local supermarket, steal a
checkout (But leave the till behind, or you could get in trouble),
and try running one of those bar code scanner thingys
over it to see what happens...

I have now sended betatest version of FantasyForces for some who wanted it,
and it is still available for others if wanted.. (see previous posting
for details)

I'm especially interested in testing of PBM-support in internet via
grapevine/DCC (or similar method)

Release will come soon, because I am planning to convert it into C to
achieve portablity, real respect ;) and enjoyable coding environment..
any tips on Amos->C conversion is appreciated

Documents are quite crap, send me mail about all things or chat in irc

   I was working in a amos martial arts game where you play against the
computer.  I used 1sprite/1bob twice the size of the hotspot i think.
  Poblem was if i draw something bigger in spritex it will not show

  Anyone knows whhy?

About AMCAFext, Jeff Webb said this:

 Well Chris you asked for bug reports. I've got one for you and I
haven't even started to test the commands. When I installed to my
harddrive (Thank god for backups.) when it got to the Help file
extender/includer it..

 1. Never gave me the option to backup my help file. After it said it
    would give me this option.
 2. When it said Done. It then poped up Failed to install
    or something like that.And then gave me the Abort or
    Retry option. This was after it said Successful.
 3. Trashed the help system in Amos. I just replaced it no big deal.

 But other than that it is a great extension. All the demo/tutorial
files run fine. The splinters alone are worth the $25 for this nice
add on to Amos Pro. I have thought up loads of uses for them in my
game already, and not just intro/demo stuff eather.
 One question before I send you the bucks. I'm stuck with Amos Pro
version 1.12 and the 1.36 Compiler. Will the registered version of
the extension compile in this enviroment? If not I'm going to be one
sad coder. I can't find Pro Compiler anywhere.

 After reading some post and the manual I found that Amal my not be
such a good idea. If the main program slows down for any reason the
Amal will/may get out of step with the screen(s). Not a desirable
condition (at least IMHO).

 I have a friend on this same server that has a 9600 v.32 Hayes sitting
on a shelf at his house. If you want me to I can get him in touch with
you. COD and all that should not be a problem.

 That was a joke. I think the Var Checker from Easylife extension is as
close to a debugger as Amos gets. If you don't have it get it.

 Note to the next Extension Writer. How about one command that
controls a single Double Buffered screen for Bobs with Autoback1 or 0.
Another that controls a Double Buffered screen with Copy and Autoback1
or Autoback0. I'm sick of Bob Clear; do bob stuff; Bob Draw;Screen
Swap; Wait vbl... ect ect ect... Or does Turbo Plus do this already?

Hello everyone,

I'm working on a fighting game(like virtua fighter yet not nearly as complex)
with cartoon "Anime" type grafix.  I was wondering if anyone has a copy
of amos1.36 compiler.

BTW My beta blows away any commercial fight sim for the Amiga.

Hi Chris!

I installed the extension and changed the config. Very thoughtful of
you to think one might just want to try it out !!
I myself am not very much of a games coder but since it is 'miscellanious'
lets look!
The bigdemo program I found very, very nice! This demo definitly shows
what makes the amiga so powerful! I installed it at a friend of mine
with 25mhz '030 to see what it might achieve compiled. This was even more
impressive! My friend (who doesn't like amos enough anymore) refused to
believe this was amos. Even though the last part of the demo (with the
'this..is..the..end..' thing) did not work after which the computer had
to be reset.
I think you'll lose DM30 on me, but it is well worth it! 

A very impressed amos-(user/coder/hater/searcher/blamer/etc)*

About AMAL,

If I am right, the most heard comment about amal is the possibility
for it to go 'out of phase'.
Since amal supplies the possibility of using a 'synchro'-command
that can be placed in the program, slowing of the main loop can 
(if synchro is used sensibly) slow amal just as well. Ofcorse, the
16 bob limit is left at the same time and also the interrupt thing.
The difference is YOU decide where to 'interrupt'.

Too bad one cannot have some bobs go 'interrupt' and others go 
'synchro' or does anyone know tricks about that ?

I would think amal is quite lovely in the way it handles animation
and movement. I see no reason not to use it for things -already mentioned-
like bullets and missiles. (What harm is there in one's own bullets going
fast ?)

Hi all:

As I reported in a previous message, I finally tracked down a copy of 
AMOS Pro Compiler, only to receive a corrupt disk. The dealer said they 
would replace the disk for me, but only after waiting a couple of weeks 
and phoning them did I find out that I won't get a replacement until they 
get the program back in stock ('real soon now')
 
Bottom Line: Is there anyone out there who would be willing to make a 
copy of their disk for me. The disk in question is the compiler disk. I 
can provide ample evidence that I have actually bought the program: 
receipt, manual, original copies of the other two disks (as I said, I 
sent the damaged disk back to the dealer). If anyone is willing to do 
this, contact me and we'll work out the details.

Thanks,
<<< Les <<<

I have a challenge for everyone on this list, I just hope people will take
me up on it.
	I wrote about this before, but got no response, but I'll try again.
What I need is a routine to transfer RGB colour values to HSV (Hue, Saturation,
value) and back to RGB. I've tried to do it myself, but I'm completey stumped
A friend of mine has gone from HSV to RGB in 35 lines of code, but surely it
can be done more efficently than that. I need it for a palette editor I'm
writing, it would be very useful to me.

	So come on all Amos programmers, ya think you can do it? 

Replies can be made here on the list, or to me personally(address below)

Just wanted to say thanks for a great extension! My co-worker is going to 
be sending you the $25 shortly. AMCAF really extends the life of AMOS. 
We've almost finished a game called WARSTAR and will be putting it up on 
AmiNet, hopefully within the week. Once AMCAF (the registered version) 
arrives, we'll begin to revamp the game with new capabilities.

Thanks again! *8^D

I am trying to make a procedure that can make curves. However, before I 
start writing it myself, I seem to remember that someone had already 
written such a procedure and posted it to this list a while ago. Could 
that someone post it to me? (Or to the Procedure Library, assuming that 
the procedure was PD and a new version of the library gets released soon).

Many thanx in advance.

I have a routine in the Procedure Library that tries and finds the most, 
middlest and least bright colours on the current screen. Accompagnying it 
is a small procedure that calculates the brightness from RGB-values. I 
cannot remember the name of the procedure, but since I only submitted two 
procedures, and the other one is called SimpleArc, you should have no 
trouble finding it.

Now if you could tell me what HSV actually mean, instead of just saying 
what they stand for, then I could give your challenge a crack.

Just now, i have no access to program that use HVS, so to speed
things little, tell us how HSV is "builded" V is brightness but
in what scale 0-63 or 0-255?, and how these others go?

After that things are easy...

The Colorspace FAQ (available on rtfm.mit.edu) deals with this, and 
there's also code for it in Computer Graphics: Principles & Practice by 
Foley and Van Dam.

You'll find the FAQ in:

95.05.19 00:47      81k pub/usenet-by-group/comp.graphics/Color_space_FAQ

It's really not that difficult, and yes, you should be able to do it in 
less than 35 lines of code, more like 20, possibly less. But of those 
20-something lines, only a bit over 1/3 will execute for any given 
conversion...

	From what I could observe from DPaint, the HSV system
works as follows:

	Separate a colour register into it's 3 categories Red
Green and Blue, obtaining a value for each between 0 and 15.

	Saturation(S)=((16-(Smallest Colour Value+1))*100)/16

	Value?(V)=((Largest Colour Value+1)*100)/16

Hue is  the most comlicated consisting of several cases. Hue is a
number between 0 and 359. Red Green and Blue reside at the
locations 0, 120 and 240 respectively. The numbers between 0 and
120 are all blends of Red and Green;between 120 and 240, blends
of Green and Blue etc. This pure Hue is then altered first by the
Value and then by the Saturation, there for to convert back:

	Reduce the smallest 2 colours by the value of the
smallest value.

	Increase the largest 2 colours by the value that
the largest colour is off of the maximum.

The special cases occur when either there are two highest
colours, there are two lowest colours or all colour registers are
exactly the same.

If all three are the same, assume Hue of 0, Value of 100 and
Saturation equal to the calculation given above.

If the two lowest are the same, then the Hue is one of the pure
colors Red, Green or Blue(0, 120, 240) and you don't have to make
the correction.

If the two highest colors are the same then the Hue is one of the
intermediary colors Red-Green, Green-Blue, or Blue-Red
(60,180,300) and you don't have to make any corrections.

If it is not one of the special cases then take the corrected
values and choose the two highest(One will be 15). Start with the
value of Hue that corresponds to the highest of the two colors(0,
120, or 240). Add if it is to the right or subtract if it is to
the left, ((Colour Value+1)*60)/16. If the resulting value is
less than 0 then add it to 360. Viola! Not too complicated, now
just write the code! :)

X-Status: 


  Hi there...

  I still have a little (???) Problem with my library call...

  I wrote a BBS Tool for FastCall.
  There is a fastcall.library included in the FC package... which can be
  called and so you can get your chars on the BBS Screen etc..

  There is a function like this:

   Function: Typefile(Fastcallport,Filename)
                            d0       a1

   Offset : -114

            Well I call this function like this:

  Lib open 5,"fastcall.library",0     >>> This suxx !!
  tx$="HELLO! HERE ON FASTCALL SCREEN!"
  tx$=tx$+chr$(0)
  areg(1)=varptr(tx$)
  dreg(0)=0
  result=lib call(5,-114)

  BUT NOTHING HAPPENS !!!!

  In the snoopdos logfile I can see the following ...

   Findport       []              Fail

  (The [] is one sign like a ESC sign !!)

  The function of the library  should search for "rexx_fastcall0"
  BUT WHY IT DOESN`T ????  Is this an AMOS bug ??

  I am using Amos Pro 2.0 .....  In GFA Basic this all suxx (most Tools
  for Fastcall are written in GFA Basic) .. but it must be possible from
  AMOS Pro,too ... OR?? Can somebody help me ??

  I hope it is a fault by me... otherwise I am not able to complete my
  program,because how to code when AMOS has bugs in its lib call routine?

   Has anyone successfully forced AMOS-developed programs into DBLNTSC screen-

promoters - perhaps not the right one - but to no avail.

I noted than many amos creator compiled programs only generate a

fixed with Amos Creator V1.36.

It's still commercial and you can't get it anymore from Europress.
That's a big problem :-(

Yes of course...

I used this kind of game loop e.g in StrikeCommander.

  Do 
    Timer=0
    Bob Draw 
    Screen Swap 
    Wait Vbl : T=Timer
	       ^^^^^^^ This is the important part. It counts the
		       number of vbls the drawing process has
		       taken.
    Bob Clear 
    For TI=1 To Min(T,8)
	   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The loop will do as many steering steps as
			 time has expired. The maximum of 8 has been
			 used to avoid dead lock situations.
      Gosub EXTRAS
      For A=0 To 1
	If I(A)>-1 Then Gosub STEERING Else Gosub EXLOSI
      Next 
    Next 
    If GAMEOVER Then Gosub GAMEOVER Else Gosub INGAME
    I$=Upper$(Inkey$)
    If I$="P" Then Gosub PAUSE
    Exit If Asc(I$)=27
  Loop 

If this hasn't made anything clearer, I will write a new example
program. The principle is to count the VBLs the visual updating had
required and then do exactly the same amount of calls to the
control-routines to compete with the drawing process. So the visual
update will only jerkier but not slower.

Ooops! Sorry about this, it seems as if I've forgotten this option at

Minor bug. Just a little typing mistake (Pop Proc[1] instead of Pop
Proc[0]). Fixed.

JW>  3. Trashed the help system in Amos. I just replaced it no big deal.

I accidentally left in a Pof(1)=offset instruction in the code so the
map file has been corrupted if it has not been the one after updating
to AP2.00. Fixed.

Just try it. Leave the error messages on and compile any of the

It's sad but true. Very annoying, really.

Huch! The demo runs on my Amiga 4000/40 to the end without problems.
It has been tested on A500/00, A500/30, A1200/20, A1200/30, A4000/30
and A4000/40 computers.

MW> I think you'll lose DM30 on me, but it is well worth it! 

Thx! ;-)

*Note to all AMOS Users*: The address specified in the last screen of
the demo is NOT valid anymore. I have not seen a penny from those
guys for one year now (they have sold the german version of AMCAF)
and they DON'T have the english version. So please ignore this

1) You've probably got to create the fastcallport using another library
call and put its address in D0. It can't find the port beceause your
passing it 0.

2) "HELLO! HERE ON FASTCALL SCREEN!" is an incredibly

Hi, about this HSV-thing,

The HSV seems to come from the 'colorwheel'-thing.
In that thing, the Hue ('color') is the degree in the wheel,
The wheel is supposed to have certain colors fixed at certain points
(like RGB) which are nicely faded into eachother. Then point you look
at on the colorwheel has two coords: the angle and the distance from the
center. These represent the Hue and Saturation. In the middle, every
color has the same value. At the boundary of the 'wheel' the color
is the least mixed one. Since the colorwheel is actually a crosssection
of the color-tube, the Value decides the brightness or height in the
color-tube.
As is stated in another message, the angle decides the color as
from 0 to 359 using the 120degree spacing.

Well, there does exist the possibility of putting an amos-bitmap
into an intuitionscreen. Then the intui-screen (whatever it is made of)
will gladly show the amos-screen. *IF* the amos-bitmaps can be used
for such a DBLNTSC -that is. You would have to gave the user the possi
bility of choosing. This might be done by icon-tool-types and the
AMCAF-extension (which is very great!!) or from the cli (also by using
AMCAF...)
A bigger problem is how to read out the mouse and keyboard once you
put 'amos to back'. You could -of course- make use of libs to draw
icons and gadgeds and then you wouldn't use amos' functions anymore
but for the 'lib call' and string-handling. Almost C.
On the other hand, you could make use of a small number of functions
to read in the keyboard on the intuition-screen using a few lib-calls

Does anyone know library-calls for the reading of the keyboard and
the reading of the mouseposition on the current screen ?

Then, if your program does away with any inputs or other inkey$ and the
like, you could make your amos-program use the intuition-display and
even things like reqtools. I tried the reqtools bit. That works,
its just that I don't get any color in the requesters :(
I will look up the source on that, maybe it will help you. Also,
Chris Hodges knows a lot about this...

Theres also one in either Turbo or JD extension as well.
There was also a posting a while back that showed how to do this with a

[Cut]

	I have a 1200 machine and have been successfully
compiling programs with Amos Creator's compiler with no garbled
screens whatsoever. I think that this is a myth or that it was
fixed around version 1.34 or so. I have Creator 1.35(?!?) and the
compiler that seemed to come with it(It is uncompiled and the
source says that it is version 1.1). Does anyone know if this is
the compiler that is supposed to work with this version or should
I go to the trouble of aquiring 1.36. I have already downloaded
the updates from Andy's site but because thay were lha'd and not
warp'd, I have no idea what the title of the disks are and
unfortunately it seems to need a specific disk title in order to
update successfully!. Could someone let me know if there are any
big changes between the two versions or if I have the correct
compiler to go with my Creator. Thanks,

			Robert Currie

I have a question about AMCAF. Our game WARSTAR uses hi-res-interlace 
screens and we found that it is not compatible with Amiga WB 3.1. What it 
appears to do is strip out every second line. On multiscan monitors it 
scrambles the starting points of each visible line, producing a real 
mess. AMOS is the only software that I've used that does this. Does AMCAF 
have the ability to bypass what AMOS is illegally doing under 3.1?

You cannot promote AMOS screens unless you edit the amos created
copper lists by hand. AMOS uses it's own copperlists and not the ones
that intuition would create for you. The only possibility to create a
promoted display is to use intuition screens (e.g using an intuition
extension).

I'm gonna verify this incompatible problem on my friends Amiga soon
(I hope).

For myself, I don't have problems with interlaced displays, but I
only have Kick 3.0 and not 3.1.

VS> What it appears to do is strip out every second line.

So the display looks compressed in y-direction? Or is very second
line only missing in that aspect that the screen really doesn't
flicker the short and long frames?

I have an hypothesis:
Before switching from an intuition screen to an amos screen, AMOS
switches to a self-generated little low-res intuition screen. This
screen is used to set the custom chip registers to ECS-values. Now if
Kick 3.1 does not change all registers to the normal value this could
be the cause of display corruptions.

VS> AMOS is the only software that I've used that does this.

AMOS uses it's own copperlists. This is the main cause for all the
problems.

VS> Does AMCAF
VS> have the ability to bypass what AMOS is illegally doing under 3.1?

Although AMCAF is not a miracle cure instrument, there could be a
change if I could find out whats really going wrong on Kick 3.1.

MW> Well, there does exist the possibility of putting an amos-bitmap

There also is the possibility to put it the other way round: Allocate
a screen using the custom bitmaps of AMOS, as I've already shown it
in an example program I posted some time ago.
Although it saves a lot of memory, there are a few problems with this
option: 15KHz works fine, but Screens using double or quadro
bandwidth can lead into trouble. AGA-Bitmaps don't only need to start
on even addresses, they must be aligned to 64 bit. Even more, the
horizontal size of the bitmaps has to be a multiple of 64. If this is
not the case, you see the well known currupted display.
As AMOS (probably) reserves the bitmap memory using _LVOAllocMem and
not like it is suggested with _LVOAllocRaster, these restrictions
might have been violated. So even an intuition screen using AMOS'
bitmaps can lead to unpreciated results.

This is really a problem: For such an extension, you need to rewrite
*all* graphic operations, bobs & sprites commands etc. :-(

You cannot read the keyboard from a screen without at least one
(preferably backdrop) window. The mouseposition, however, can be read
directly from the screen structure.

I uploaded it at a site in Essen/Germany, and have seen it in a site

should find it too on AmiNet/dev/amos/AMCAF119.lha.

Watch out for the AMCAFUpd120.lha which fixes the bugs in the

This method of peeking the hardware registers is very discuraged. It
does not work with harddisks or any other device and the routines

Hi folks.

I may have located a store which still supplies AMOS Pro and the AMOS Pro
Compiler at a very reasonable price, and has them in stock as well! The
price is: fl 89,-- for AMOS Pro (=US$ 60) and fl 79,-- for the Compiler (
which is about US$ 50). I'll let you know when I receive my copies (next
week) -- I want to make certain it's not a dream :).

I've tested AMOS Pro (1.12) and WARSTAR on a 3.0 A1200 and it works fine.

I do, it looks the way WARSTAR does. "Everything" else works fine, it's 
only the interlace problem.

When I display on an RGB monitor, it looks like every second line is 
missing, and because of that gap, there is no flicker. On my multiscan, 
with the software or hardware flicker fixer on, it looks like each line 
is copied a second time to the space where the other normal lines should 
be, and each line draws plus or minus several 10's of pixels from the 
left.

If it "is" the latter, is it feasible for you to devise a "patch"?? The 
game that we've been making is a really good one and we'd like to ensure 
that it runs on the latest Amiga OS, if possible.

Thanks for looking into it! *8^)

I know that this is a 'nasty' method, but it does work. A number of
programs failed because of this reason. 
History lesson: Some programmers, in order to get the most speed out of the
amiga, hit the hardware directly. These games are usually those that bypass
the operating system, by having a custom bootblock. Commodore warned people
that the hardware locations could change,(and the ROMS for those that
picked code off the ROMS). 
Now, some of the extensions (no offense guys, but I've seen the source for
some of the extensions - not all- so no flames!) do hit the hardware
directly to get the neat little tricks in the shortest amount of code.
I have hit the hardware directly on my 3000 and it works OK. I don't know
about the really fast machines, such as the 4000, but I don't see why it
wouldn't.
The best method is to use the LIB's, so dig out the ROM manual (it's about
10cm thick and find what you want-taking a day or two).

Oh yes, to read the parrallel port, such as for an audio digitiser, you
have to hit the hardware. Even commercial software does this! Just be
careful and test it on a few machines to make sure it works.

I have been trying to install EasyLife2 but always end up with a message that
EasyLife2 docs doesn't exist. I am no sure if anything I am doing is correct
but I getting three patches in RAM which I renamed tmp just to get anything to
work at all. I have AMOSPro 2.0 on hard drive. I have EasyLife lib plus the
other lib that came with EasyLife2. I can read the patches that are created in
a text reader but I think they should be in my online help when AMOSPro is
running. I did start up AMOSPro first as suggested.

Any help would be great!

I am still looking for an example of a scene in use that was created with the
Turbo Scene generator or what ever it is called. I wrote my own scene maker in
CanDo 3.0 to create arrys for scenes in AMOSPro but would like to be able to
use the Turbo Plus Scene Editor.

Hi Paul,
   I read the other day your looking for 1.12 owners to test you 
auto.config prog.  Well if you can send me detail on how to get the 
program from your E-Mail in to amos I'll be happy to test it for you. 


Hi everybody else,
    Why has everybody started sending their progs embedded into 
E-Mail?  Its a pain and it makes the files I have to download 
extremly big.  Just remember 4k limit.  Also some of us have to pay 
per bit, so please if you have a prog mail a message and let those 
who want get in touch or put it on AmiNet.

Well thats my winge out the way for this year. 
(good news about Amiga coming back on line eh?)
