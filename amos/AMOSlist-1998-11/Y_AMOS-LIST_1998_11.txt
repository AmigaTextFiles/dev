Is their any way to make the clock run off the power from the PSU?

I don't understand why Amiga clocks don't work that way normally, so if
the power gos out you'll have to reset your Amiga clock with all the

Hello, all !

It seems that my old Amos 1.34 does not like my blizzard 030/50+32Fast.
When I run an executable file, I get an "Illegal function call".
If I do a "NoFastMem", then recompile my prog, it runs fine !

Anyone knows about this bug ? Is there a fix ? Am I getting nut ?

Hi-Res-Laced and Printing Screens on an Amiga 1200 in Amos Pro V2.0

Sun Nov 1, 1998 4:18 pm
David Brian Hayes <dbh02@students.stir.ac.uk>


I`m a student at Stirling University, and I am wanting to earn myself a
little extra cash! I am into personal electronics, and have wanted to
write a PCB creator for some time. I turned to my good old faithful Amos
Pro, while I had an A500, and the programming started to pick up pace.
The things that I wanted to happen, were working.
Then I got an A1200!!! Great I thought, this should speed up my creation
of the program, but it has stopped it dead in it`s tracks!
On an A500, when I do a "Screen Open 0,640,512,16,Hires+Laced" it
opened up a hires-laced screen, yet the same command on an A1200 opens
up a hires screen only, no laced. This is a bit of a bummer! But wait
there`s more;-
On an A500, when I did a screen print with sizing options, it printed
the screen in the write dimensions on my printer, yet on an A1200, my
computer gets a guru-meditation error something like 800000004 or
something. Can anyone out there in Amos land help?

This is a bug with the old AMOS library and OS3.1

There's a fixed version in

http://users.cybercity.dk/~ccc21504/amos/front.html

Not sure on this one. It could be your printer driver? Does it print out
other things fine on your A1200.

My old A1200 got busted and it hang up every time it tried to access
the printer.

If you like you could send me the printing routines and I'll test
them on my A1200.


See ya.

This problem has actually been fixed :)
So go to this address: http://www.seta.it/amos (The AMOS Factory)
And there you'll find the latest update with the interlaced screens fix
and the limit bob fix ;)

Don't know about that. I don't use AMOS to print.

Heres a little trick I used when I had an accelerator with no
battery:


I used Synclock every time I wen't online, that way my email always
showed the right time.

Of cource, its easier to have a battery backed up clock.... but no if
its leakin!

Doesn't that cause the clock PRAM to clear when you turn off your Amiga?

I was thinking more like connecting up the PSU with the battery terminals,
or maybe an external AC to DC converter.

Of course.

An external backup-system? Personally I don't think you should
bother with the PSU. You can't turn half of it off without a lot of
extra switches. And connecting an AC/DC converter involvs
as much soldering as changing the battery, I guess.
My suggestion is that you mount a battery-"holder" (Sorry, but I
don't
know the english word for it) so you can change battery more easily
in the future. Also, if the battery starts to leak, the acid won't
get anywere.

>Please stop using HTML.

I wish I could. But there's no option in Outlook97 (NOT Outlook
Express)
to do so. I've tried everything I could think of.
I'm sorry, really, but...
If anyone on the list could assist, I'd be greatful.

Magnus

I use...

Screen Open 0,640,512,16,Hires Or Laced

...in AMOSPro v2.0 running on my A1200 and I have no problems with that.
Use "Or" instead of "+". This may solve the problem. Because the screen

same result.

Speaking of IRC, #amos only ever has a small few people there ;(
when your online you should pay a visit to #amos on IRCNET

Yep, I discovered it a few months before they dissapeared
(when I still wasn't very active on IRC).
There are still some guys from time to time.

Well, there always seen to be a bunch of Germans who come
to 'see' Citrone ;) and some tori-amos fan people who join and leave
after finding out it's not about tori-amos, but there are enough real
AMOS users on the channel to not call it dead ;)

Speaking of #amos, was it started by Digital and Cosmo (ville ranke) ?

Amos Factory

Wed Nov 4, 1998 11:10 am
"Rune J. Keller" <keller@vip.cybercity.dk>


Just a short note to tell you, that I've moved the Amos Factory to Xoom. This
means, that the new URL for the site is:

http://members.xoom.com/AmosFactory

You can still reach it through the old URLs, though.

The move to Xoom has been done to obtain more space (11MB prior to 2MB) and
allowing more people to work on the site. First of all this means that Jens
Vang Petersen will now join the site, with his extension page. Thus allowing
you to download and read about all the extensions for Amos. This will be
completed in the very near future.

Thanks.

This problem belongs to the IO-extension that handles all printer
operations in AMOS Pro. When you call 'Printer Dump' there are
several various ways of calling, the longest (and most valuable
version) however crashes due to a stack-handling error in the
extension. I've managed to hack the extension with a simple hex-
editor and simply removed the troubled part (no the best solve,
but it works) I uploaded the thing to the list some time ago, but
it appears that most readers didn't notice, so here it is again ;-)

(Just copy it over the old one in APsystem..)

simulator. I've managed to make a car wars style module for it. The

well as grabbing the fine FBN products there for dl.

If you are going to upload it with source, then definitely dev/amos .. If
not, then demo/ecs or demo/file would be a good choice, I think...

a great shame too, because it looks like a brilliant game.

I offered to do some programming 4 it, but to be honest, Amos isn't
capable of very spectacular effects anymore.

We may as well wait for TGE to come out.

42.7 ?sounds like youve clocked it 8o)
The reason for ST2 not working for more than 2 mins,
is more than likely coz of being a Apollo board (if it is ?)

Apollo boards dont like AMOS afaik. if you wanted ST2 to work,
just disable the board boot without startup sequence, and
run it from dos.

(I dont have a apollo card, but it should work)

hehe nope it came @ 42.7 :) but I'm not complaining.

and I'm not running an apollo board, I'm using a
Magnum Mk2, although I may be using an apollo soon,
(my 060 may be an apollo)

Could be.

ST2 runs fine on my 1230/50, too. It may be that you didn't get the aga fix
for it. The aga graphic file got corrupted in the original somehow.

it's good... well, okay at least... the demo can be found on
Aminet with a search for "echaos"

I'm planning on a "eCHAOS_2".... but I don't know if i'll be able
to program it well enuf :^/

So chek it out every1 -- i'd appreciate comments!

Demo on Aminet

Hello, all.

I've just uploaded Old-Fx, the demo I wrote. If I did everything well,
it will be soon in the drawer demo/file.

You can see another product I did in game/gag.
It is a very little game where you have to send pies in Bill Gate's
face.
http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/public/aminet/info/www/dirs/aminet/game/gag/piebill.lha
(or any mirror)
The .readme file is absolutely weird, I typed it on a Mac, and the
carriage returns are not recognised by Aminet. Well, there is nothing
important.

regards

From what I have heard about them, the magnum or blizzard may
be better, Ive heard of them not been so 'system-friendly' as they disable
some of your hardware and they also dont work with various programs.

Even with TGE such 'Spectacular' effects are impossible.
You need optimized asm for that kinda stuff. Unless
AMOS NG will have a PPC version.

Hello everyone,

I have attatched some code that might be helpful to some beginners.

I hope you can forgive me for it being 40k in size;(

But after seeing someone's game, a bomberman clone, I had to send this code
so that they could see how it would be beter done. Plus, if anyone wants to
contact me about finishing off one of the games, then feel free :)

Please tell me off if it's too big. I promise no more large files.

I hope the code is good enough to let me off the hook ;)

Anyhow, See ya all soon,

and drop into #amos...Citrone and myself get lonely ;)

Jono.

AMOS to Back problems

Mon Nov 9, 1998 10:16 am
"Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>


I am having a problem when putting Amos Pro behind the workbench screen I
cannot get it back. I reckon it is down to carelessness on my part but it
really pisses me off when I have to reboot or launch another copy of Amos
Pro and I usually lose what I just edited.

I know that left-Amiga A switches Amos Pro to front and back, but when this
does not work is there any other way? Thanks in advance.

Declan.

always worked for me.

Hmmm, I don't know, PALLE could be confusing to pronounce.

Could just be PAL, for Pc Amos-like Language. Then you couls have .PAL

Hi.

Hey guys call me a dumb sod, but I've had to re-install 90%
of the stuff on my HD - Including AmosPro2 :(

(get to the point, stupid!)

heh okay..

anyway having reinstalled it all, I can't get the damn
gui compiler to work. :(

(v1.70)

according to the docs, I have to run a "patch", but I
can't find the damn patch prog anyway..
can anyone please tell me where I'm going wrong..

You can't do that with craft, can you? surly he wants DOOM Music
Extention. Then you can play samples over tracker mods.

/Or/

I've managed to get Octamed multichannel mods working with only 2ch.
(with a large hack) leaving 2 channels free for sfx.

Hi everybody,

Just an introduction...
I've just started refamiliarising myself with Amos after a good 3-4 year
lay-off.

I'm still using my A500+ bought a good 7 years ago. I generally use it to 'mess
about'.
My programming skills (Amos or otherwise) are too clumsy to have produced
anything
spectacular but I still enjoy it. The only programs written to date are a
Trapeze type game
and a Q+A with pictures for identifying Silver hallmarks and Maker's marks.

My major problem is my imagination. I have lots of ideas for games but I can
never
stick at something long enough. I understand the techniques and theory behind
writing
computer programs. I just haven't got the discipline to stick to it. It's
probably a case
of enjoyment vs results.

Anyway, looking forward to checking out some of the discussions but don't
expect too
much from me on the technical side.

Thanks

Tony

Keyboard tests...

Wed Nov 11, 1998 6:19 pm
Zangiacomi Sylvain <szan@club-internet.fr>


Hi you all,

Today, I tried a small code on an Amiga with an Infinitiv keyboard
interface to use with the original keyboard of this machine.

I tried this:

Do
A=0
If Key State(16) Then Add A,1
If Key State(17) Then Add A,2
Print A
Loop

On an AZERTY, pressing key A will print 1, B will print 2, and normally
pressing A and B together will print 3.

But on this keyboard interface, it is only A or B, no way to detect
multi pressed keys.

Very bad for action games with keyboard. Is there a way to really test
the states of the keyboard (that was possible on my poor A500) ?

Bye, Sylvain

Hi.

Can anyone tell me how to set the priority of a task, via
AmosPro2..?

I've combed through my Amos1.3 and EasyAmos Manuals and
I can't find a command thats suitable. :(

(I'm working on a gui that allows you to set the priority
of Lightwave.)

I could do with a command like

SetPri Lightwave.fp PRI=-1

anyone help..?

On many amigas, (like A1200), it can't detect more then one keypress on
the same row eg
.
on a qwerty keyboard, these keys don't work together:
qwertyuiop[] etc.

You'll have to make sure you map the keyboard carefully.

(The cursor keys are a pain, each one conflicts with one of the main
rows ;(


See ya.

There is not such command built in to AMOS, so you'll have to use a
different program. You can do this of you find either:

A cli program, you'd do Exec "pri Lightwave.fp PRI 1"

A program with Arexx, not sure how.

Unless theres an extention to do that.

AmosPro2 Upgrade List

Thu Nov 12, 1998 5:27 am
Bob Jordan <bjordan@soest.hawaii.edu>

----------
Would it be possible to get on an upgrade list of some kind so that when
AmosPro2 is available again, that those in NEED get notified ASAP.

I'm doing some heavy duty programming and version 1 locks up many times a
day. From what I've been told, version 2 is my salvation.

I saw the posting about being available in December, but the suspense is
killing me!

Take a look at Aminet in Dev/Amos and you'll find
archives for each month.

Hmmm, the SetPri command doesn't come with 3.0, is it with 3.1 or
something? Well, you'll have to find that program or similar.

Hello...

I have an 060/PPC and AmosPro 2 with the latest library from the Amos
Factory. I cannot get Amos to run unless I have SnoopDos running. I
tried to use SnoopDos to see why Amos keeps crashing, but instead I found
out the way to keep Amos from crashing! Anyone have a clue why this is
happening?

Greetings,
I have the CU Amiga disk 76 copy of the Craft Extension available if

Hi Everybody,

Has anybody produced any AMOS (pro or 135) Line of Sight or shortest path

How efficient are they and how does the Amiga handle them?

I'm just delving into basic AI. The theory sounds fair enough but I'm worried
about
the processing power.

So I tried :

Print Key State (51)
Loop

If I keep pressing key c, it prints -1, but if during this time I press
any other key (I've tried all !), it prints 0, and never comes back
to -1 !

Only key shift works fully togheter (Ctrl,2 Shifts, 2 Amigas, 2 Alts).

Games with keyboards are no more possible with such poor hardware.

Funny, when I tried that with my A1200, the C key worked fine with
every key except with a few others on that line.

I guess its a limitation with your keyboard interface ;(

Hi Amosiams ;)


I'm in a coding mood, so I'm going to start a new proggy
and before I attempt such a huge task (I'm a lame coder!) I need
to know if any of my ideas are possible with AmosPro2.


These are the ideas I have, could you please say whether AmosPro
could do these, and if they would be hard or easy to code.?

(the only extension I have installed is the SUPERB gui extension
version 1.70)

things I'd like to do are:-


a file locator util (using a gui)

a CDRom tray open/close util (gui)

a util that uses speech to tell me what frame imagine/Lw
is currently rendering and how long the last frame took to
render.

a simple game (like the old food fight..)
(I'm not sure amos can display enough sprites..!?!!)


please forgive me if I'm asking any dumb things, but to be
honest I'm a very very lame coder.. although I'm
enthusiastic... I'm really a 3d bod, not a programmer..
but hey, amos is fun...

Steve

ChangeTaskPri command comes with 3.0, and even with 1.x, I think. But it can
only affect tasks started from CLI.

Hmmm, I know you can read directionarys with amos (its easier with

Don't know about this one.

This should be possible with AREXX.

Amos can display 4 and 16 colour sprites, and Bobs no problem. It
also handels sprite/bob collisions for you.

load the exe into a bank, and do Call bnk no.

load the exe into memory, do Call $address

write a extension.

Are the following bugs being addressed for the next amos release?

Change the default screen to less than four colours and your sound gets
screwed up. Sam Play won't work, and the built in sounds, Boom, Shoot and Bell
will guru the Amiga.

Sam Loop Off gets switched to Sam Loop On after a run. The command still
works, but it gets shown on the screen improperly.

That should be simple, perhaps you should get the 'EasyLife'

That includes some direct device access, but still quite simple..

I havn't got a clue on this, sorry..

Perhaps you could do it using bobs ??

Well, we all started as 'lame' coders on some level, perhaps
on the C64 or in AmigaBasic, and I know that I'm sometimes
a bit anoyed with my first coding. I can't belive the amount
of Goto's I was using ;-))

Ehh, sometimes, It's possible to include executable code in an amosprogram,
either as a bank or a 'sealed' procedure. The process is descriped in
the AMOS Pro manual, but try and look in the on-line-help on 'Pload' and
'Call' that should provide some idea. On how to do.. But as noted in the
manual, It don't always work..

NO! Why? Because in the next release the Music Extension will be probably
removed forever!! It is the most stupid,bugged,bad written Amos extension
in the world! *AMCAF will be a total replacement.* It give you TRUE
protracker support (v3.5+) with /CIA /and /VBL /replay mode, and the
possibility to play samples over the tracker (.. and many other cool
functions)

Where possible i'll *destroy* the old Amos code, replacing it with a better
one. The AMOS asm sources are a collection of bad code! Now i'm working on
the devices interface, since i've to totally rewrite it!!! :(((( I've
discovered a really nasty surprise in the code.... In order to work propely
with the devices (like the printer.device, serial.device etc) you need to
call some exec.library functions not available in the old OS1.3... so
Francois Lionet in order to keep the OS1.3 compatibility has disassembled!
the linker library Amiga.Lib (.. wich provide the necessary 1.3 functions)
and inserted the code in the main AMOSPro lib! So now i've to work with
some rubbish like this:

L7C7D97A 	MOVE.L #$10001,-(A7)
	PEA 	$22.W
	BSR 	L7C7DAD0
	MOVEA.L D0,A2
	EXG 	D7,A2
	TST.L 	D7
	EXG 	D7,A2
	ADDQ.L 	#8,A7
	BNE.S 	L7C7D9A4
	MOVE.L 	D6,-(A7)
	BSR 	L7C7DB28
	MOVEQ 	#0,D0
	ADDQ.L 	#4,A7
	BRA.S 	L7C7D9E6
L7C7D9A4 	MOVE.L  D4,$A(A2)
	MOVE.B 	D3,9(A2)
	MOVE.B 	#4,8(A2)
	CLR.B 	$E(A2)
	MOVE.B 	D6,$F(A2)
	CLR.L 	-(A7)
	BSR 	L7C7DB00
	MOVE.L 	D0,$10(A2)
	TST.L 	D4
	ADDQ.L 	#4,A7
	BEQ.S 	L7C7D9D8


nice eh?? and the other sources are like this.. no comments, no info...
nothing!
Now you can image my situation, and you can understand the reason for wich
no one has updated Amos in the past years... someone has tried (.. the
several rumours) , but as we know nothing is happened. I've awaited too
many years, and now i won't give up! You already know my plans.. if i can't
really upgrade the main code, i'll expand it through our COOL extensions!

Final note: AMOS WILL NEVER WORK AGAIN ON THE OLD OS v1.3!

> and the built in sounds, Boom, Shoot and Bell will guru the Amiga.

Good :) I would kill everyone who has used this weird sounds in their
programs!

Of course....

You can do it very easly using a FD extension with exec.library support:

TASK$="Lightwave.fp" : TSK=_Lvo Findtask(varptr(TASK$))
IF TSK><0 Then PRI=-1 : OLD=_Lvo Settaskpri(TSK,PRI)

or you can use the boring standard way:

TASK$="Lightwawe.fp" : Areg(1)=Varprt(TASK$) : TSK=Execall(-294)
IF TSK><0 Then PRI=-1 : Areg(1)=TSK : Dreg(0)=PRI : OLD=Execall(-300)

Whilst I understand what you're writing, I've never come across a
line like 'If TSK><0' before... What does it do? Does it mean 'If
TSK>0 or TSK<0' or something else entirely. I'm confused...

"<>" or "><" means NOT EQUAL TO as in IF TSK IS NOT EQUAL TO 0 THEN BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH...

Hello!

Unfortnataly, due to lack of time and alike, ive had no choice
but to postpone the TGE beta perview due for today, I know
that a lot of you were awaiting it, but some things messed up
in the last minute, however, all I can say the the moment,
is that im sorry, and it will be out SOON, Im hopeing for next week,
it might be before and it might be after.

Also, before I release it I would like peeps opinions on
the buffering. I remember when I made games I always wanted
it to be this way, but some people may differ...

Atm, the buffering works like:

G Triple Buffer (or Double if you like...)
G Screen open .............

Then your main loop:
Do
....
....
....
....
G Swap Buffers *** Swaps the buffers.
Loop

I prefere this was as in the origional amos way
you couldnt do this and it allows YOU to select when to
swap the buffers.

Comments plz!

if enough people want it without the swap buffers I might do it
as a option.

cyas,

How is that different to the amos way? Surly that command does the
same as 'screen swap'?

Ok, apologies again, seems this message got out more than once. Don't
all complain at once, this bit is fixed, I just did a bulk mailing and
made an manual error.

> Pietro Ghizzoni

For all those who started their programming experience with Amos and that of
course includes young children the built-in sounds were great. With just a
few lines of code they could show a home drawn picture as a background and
have something happen with simple sound effects.
My point is that the value of Amos basic is that it is a *beginners*
language please don't forget that!
-------------------------------------
While I'm typing I may as well try and restate a point I tried to make some
weeks ago. I said that Blitz failed to hook me like Amos did. My message was
taken to be a Blitz vs Amos flame. In fact I was complaining about the Blitz
manual, and this aspect of the new Amos must not be overlooked. Until I
subscribed to this list I never had any other source of help for my
programming than the Amos original & AmosPro manuals, both of which were
very good. If a language is for beginners, and Basic is, then the
documentation must provide them with all the information they need,
including standard Basic structures.
-------------------------------------
Fascinating insight into the poorly written structure of old Amos, thanks.
-------------------------------------
Please keep up this considerable effort, the new Amiga will need a new Amos,
that's for sure!

Thanks

Just a quick message really...

I'm setting up a new AMOS Web page...
http://www.freeyellow.com/members5/a-zone
(go to the frames version as the non-frames version is on geocities
and probably wont be continued)

anyway, if you've been there you'll notice it's a little bit empty. I
know most of the people on this list have web pages of their own to
worry about but I'm only asking for the odd article or request for
articles, or some tips etc. It's designed to be mainly a BEGINNERS
page...

I might shove on some of my AMOS programs for download (Space
Monopoly my only COMPLETED project - it was in Amiga Format a few
months ago) and maybe some extensions...

Anyway, if you've got any ideas then email me. I don't expect too
much feedback on this because you all have your own web pages - but
just a few ideas eh?

Thanks, David

New AMOS

Mon Nov 16, 1998 3:56 pm
"David Vivash" <PMA98DAV@Sheffield.ac.uk>


I've been off the list for a month or two now - and I keep seeing
these messages appearing about a new AMOS... So what's all that about
then?
Is this a brand new AMOS from scratch or some new extension? I've
also noticed talk of AMOS for the PC. Presumably this isn't some naff
Europress Klik & Play sort of thing so is it *really* amos for the
pc? Now maybe I'm a pessimist but I don't see how AMOS could work on
the PC as it does on the amiga. Anyone who's used a PC will know that
it handles screens in a completely different way to the Amiga - which
means a whole new approach will have to be brought in in handling
screens when trying to convert AMOS-Amiga programs to AMOS-pc
programs. Anyway, if it does work it'll be a good thing to get back
to *fun* programming on a strictly non-fun machine.

There would be a few things I would recommend to change in the
editor though... Firstly, I presume this would run under Win95, and
so if we are to stick to the way AMOS works by running interpreted
code and creating compiled versions if you want them, it would mean
the AMOS programs would have to run under win95. This is not
necessarily a bad thing (you could make use of directx 6 for
example), but if you're working from a win95 environment it would be
expected you could write win95 applications. This is what worries me -
has anyone considered how HUGE a programming language would have to
be allow you to write win95 applications AND games. If anyone here
has ever used something like Borland C++ builder or even Visual Basic
you'll know how big these things are and you'd shudder at the thought
of having just one person programming them. So AMOS-pc would have to
be just for games I would say... unless anyone wants to argue with
that.

Of course, it's probable I've got the idea of AMOS-pc wrong
entirely... I have programmed the pc a bit and I know there's
not really any room for any more application builders. The one's out
there are pretty good anyway at what they do... there's no decent
games programming languages on the pc though. Keep that in mind...

Sorry for this rambled email. Probably got everything wrong but hey!
I'm a programmer, it' my job to get things wrong... i'll come back
and debug this email later...

David

Why do people stick with 1.3 anyway ?

its not as if its hard to get a a1200, they are practly free second hand,
and as it stands, 1.3 is prehistoric. Im supiresed that people with
1.3 still have it, I figured that the roms would have started to

Oh my god!! I'm dead them.
I actually use them a lot , specially boom.
Fact is that I use them for testing and positioning samples , so
later on I can go over the prog and substitute it.
For this only reason I think there should be built in sounds (beep)

Actually, i should probably agree with this one, even though I very, very,
very rarely even think about using them. Actually, I use bell to stop the
looping samples.. (normally muted though).

Hey Ghizzo, if you are replacing all the samples (cool !) bung in a default
couple of noises for "built in" stuff.

Not so much bugs, but replacing the entire gfx system is a

nah, or nafaik. The amos system keeps swapping buffers
and slowing your program down, then logic and physic are diffrent
ways of doing it. via having one buffer in fast ( I think).

Nop, I'm sorry, I still can't see how thats different to doing

Double Buffer
Autoback 0

do

blah blah

Screen Swap


loop.

And surly having a buffer in fastmem would be slower, as doesn't the
amos system actually change the screens bitmap offsets to the other
buffer, meaning an instant swap? If the other buffer was in fastmem,
then you'd have to physically swap the memory.

Anyway, if you can get it faster then thats enough reason for me ;)


See ya.

Can I just point out that AMCAF is not quite perfect yet for sound either.
It can't handle large samples.
I always use AMCAF for sound except for when the occasion arises and I need
a large sample played I have to go back to standard AMOS sound.

And I'll add that I play samples in excess of 64k all the time. If amcaf can't
handle them (I know dme wouldn't) then it's not a replacement at all.

i believe that this was mentioned on the amiga-uni mailing list. if so,
this is a microsoft-backed service that IS free, but in signing up you
are handed a piece of microsoft software to use with it. i heard someone
was going to connect to the server via amiga and bypass the pc promotion
(or what ever scheme they have devised to assimilate you), but i haven't
heard anything further.

What do you change it with? A great program is Icon_Installer
(logical :) Do you have New Icons installed? This may be
assigning default icons of some sort....

Hey, no probs. Just remember to make sure that the icons are
specified as "disk" not "drawer" or "tool" or something!

Regarding Workbench Icons, the .info file contains information abouit
what type of icon it is, i.e. it will have information stored about whether
it is a Disk, Drawer, Program, Project, etc... All .info files which contain
anything except the Disk information will be displayed, regardless of
whether the file it is attatched to is disk(disk.info) or
myfile(myfile.info)
My guess is that you tried to use a drawer icon as a disk icon, but
Workbench still thinks that the icon is still a drawer. The program I use to
correct this is Iconian. It is a shareware program, but not wholey
restricted in it`s use when you haven`t registered. This program (and
probably many others like it) allow you to load the offending .info file,
and by just changing a menu item (ie select icon-type from drawer to disk)
then saving it back out should work.
Hope that this information is of some help to you Declan.

It should work with Newicons, but I haven`t been around the Amiga scene
recently, cos I work with PC`s (SPITS OUT LOUD!) here at Uni, but I should think
that the latest version of Iconian should work with Glow icons. Sorry that I
cannot be of more help. I am using an old version of Iconian (came free with
Amiga Shopper, so you can gauge how old it is!)

Oh, i forgot :)
Thats probably why i did not work. But you do not need some special program
really.
You could just load your new icon into the icon editor which comes with
workbench, and then
make sure you set it's type to disk before saving again.

i haven't yet heard anything about the interface language from this list
(i read last month's transcript and didn't see anything there, either).
does anybody use the interface language? is anybody else having a problem
with the writing modes, such as transparent vs opaque?

is it ok to whine about programming problems on this list?

i am displaying graphics (line and box commands) and printing text on top
of them (for labelling buttons), and the writing mode changes at odd
though sometimes predictable times, though not predictable enough to
determine why the mode is changing, or why SetWriting is being ignored.

if there are bugs in the interface (heresy for me to say that, i know)
will they be fixed in AMOS II?

Is the interface part of a set of amos screens? I mean, could it be

We rarely use it these days, and as such, rarely talk of it.

Yow ! A question that is hard to answer ! There MAY be probs with it,
I don't know of any as such.

I've never had any probs with it, but I havn't tried doing odd writing
changes. I generally had the interface stuff on its own private screen
out the way of anything interesting, and nice and safe. I seem to
remember it using a whole bunch of its own commands, which may be the
prob. Show the prob !

> will they be fixed in AMOS II?

I'll lay odds no. AmosII is being written to take advantage of the amiga
WB3+ GUI and not use the internal interface language. It is unlikely
an update will be available for it. (Correct me if I'm wrong Ghizzo)

<whine>
the program which uses the interface lang heavily (to keep my checkbook)
i'm sure could be written for wb - given that i don't know exactly how it
will translate. and SO much of the program will have to be rewritten, and
the graphics replaced *sniff*. that will make it the 4th rewrite of the
program.
</whine>

it's progress i suppose. and practice. ;)

i've read alot about using the amiga libraries for wb programming, but i've
never actually got there.

actually i just got the gui_1.70 from the net but haven't "cracked it open"
yet. maybe my next programming step is to start reading the docs.

<rambling>
the program uses two interface channels to maintain 3 lists, the checkbook
fields, and a panel of supporting buttons, if anyone is interested. i
would have uploaded it to somewhere by now, but it's been in a constant
unfinished (i.e. unpolished) state, though very useable. if nothing else,
its a good example of almost all of the interface commands.

I would gladly take a look at it for you if you want. I've done some
progs using the ol' interface but have now left it for the
GUI-extension.

ok. i installed the gui lib into amospro, and now amospro freezes the
computer when i attempt to reload it. my first guess is that i need
amospro version 1.3 (i have 1.12). how can i upgrade amospro to 1.3?

V2.0, not 1.3. The compiler disks came with an update. Otherwise, wait a month
for the amos update files to go onto the official site and dl amos pro 2.1 (or
whatever they call it).

I've used it a lot previously, and I still turns to it from time to time,
eventhough I prefer to use the intuition/gadtools support in OS-DevKit..

The writing-mode thing is proberly due to the way the interface work, if
you define a button with some text to be displayed with a certain writing-
mode then you must remember that ONLY the update-segment of the button
is parsed, so in order for things like writing-modes, text colours and
so on, they MUST be defined in the actual 'update' sequence, also remember
that normal amos switches the writing-modes when ever it feels like it..


> is it ok to whine about programming problems on this list?

I think that it's what this list is all about... ;-)
Lots of people talking about new updates is fine, but since this
is a programmers-list then the actual coding should be the backbone
(This is my personal oppinion..)

(see above..)


> if there are bugs in the interface (heresy for me to say that, i know)
> will they be fixed in AMOS II?

As some people is compleatly wild about the intuition things, proberly
not. But many of the bugs in the interface can be related to poor
writing in the docs, like the BOx command (as I recall the docs state
that it's defined using X,Y,W,H or something, but actualy X1,Y1,X2,Y2
is needed), also there's the famous IL (InactiveList) which isn't there,
but actualy I find the interface very usefull as it is now, the capability
to create 'auto-centering-sizeadapting-buttons' is a nice thing, and also
the idea of building 2-arrow-buttons together with a slider to controle
an active list (all with your personal images for the buttons) appeals
to me.. And ofcourse a program written with the interface can run on a
1.3 system, nice.... ;-)

I used the interface language almost exclusively until the recent advent of
GUIExt which makes everything so much more system-friendly. Yeah, there are
some bugs (Inactive lists don't work among other things), but it's pretty
stable and easy to write for. However, why not just start using GadToolsBox
and the GUIExt? Much nicer indeed. Perhaps one day MUI will be supported in a
similar way (MUIBuilder and a MUIExt? One can only hope.)

I can't see why Interface would get updated considering how good a replacement
the GUIExt is. Maybe I'm wrong though.

IS ANYBODY OUT THERE who might know how I can do that?
With an Amiga and Amos programming language I used to
write great little childrens' programs.
What would it take to use such a program on my PC?
Is there an Emulator for the PC to run a standard
Amiga program like Amos Basic for the Amiga?
OR, does Amos have a PC version of its Basic Program?
I would love to hear from anybody who has been this route.
Any help or suggestion would be most welcome.

Yep, there's two ways:

1. Wait for the AMOS clone on the PC to come out.

2. Use an Amiga Emulator. I can point you to a site where you can download a
completely setup PC amiga Emulator with s/w etc.

or if you MUST:

3. Use QbAsIc (yuck!). It comes with dos.

See ya.

MUI ?!?

Its yuk, and easylife does it anyway.
I dont see how anyone could actually like it, all it does is take loads

AMOSPro v1.3 doesn't exist... the latest version is the V2 shipped with the
AMOSPro Compiler.... and obviously the GUI Extension require AMOSPro 2.

Note: AMOSPro V1.x is really unstable!!! expecially if you're using the AF
coverdisk version!

a little reminder: in December i'll release AMOSPro2 and Compiler for free
on the Amos Factory site!

The interface language si pretty stable.... as i know the only problems are
the Inactive List command wich doesn't exist, and some buffer problem with
REALLY big interface programs (.. just increase it to fix the problem).
Anyway the interface language will not be updated since i'm working hard in
order to make Amos more OS friendly and the interface lang. isn't the right
way. GUI Extension & OS Dev Kit Extension are the NEW AMOS interface
language ;)

Speaking about extensions.. it's the upgrade season :) Check the Amos
Factory site because soon you'll find:

- GUI Extension v1.75

- Main AMOSPro.Lib and AMOSPro_IOPorts.Lib upgrades!!! (yeaahhh.. now
finally TurboPrint works fine too!!!! Fuck Off OS1.3!!!!)

- DataBench Extension preview. *NEW!!!* (database support!)

I completely disagree. MUI offers a good looking, fully configuable
interface of amiga programs. It has features like window snapshotting,
iconifying and auto Pub. screen handeling that other GUI interfaces don't
have. It also makes writing a complex interface much easier (I've heard)

And it only uses up chipmem and speed if you still don't have a GFX
board.

See ya.

hmmm, i wonder if that's the reason i have had to set my variable buffer
to 2 meg to avoid crashes. actually i might get away with 1 meg, but i
got so sick of trying to be efficient and only allocating the mem that i
really needed, and had to constantly bump the mem as i processed
more data.

wow what a concept...a database! heh

Hello, Everyone

The extensionslists at the AmosFactory should now be 100% up and running
after a couple of weeks of modifications and testing. So Rune should
proberly get that text on the frontpage changed now (inside joke..)

Anyway, with the pages appearing to run proberly there's also been room
for a few updates, new this time is CRAFT availeble for download and a
link to the supportpages for TGE...
(Yeah I know, not an impressive update..)

The extensionlist currently looks like this:

Re: Using Amos Programming Language on a PC

Hi Everybody,

I'm not sure how long it'll take...

> I have used Qbasic, GFA Basic and Visual Basic but nothing equals AMOS in

too right ;)

the site is

http://www.classicgaming.com/aiab/

its basically got WinUAE, a config file and a fully installed HD. directorys
for wb etc.

To use amospro with it you'll have to make an ADF disk image, theres plenty
of programs on aminet to do that, and if I were you, I'd download the main
archive on your amiga with a copy of HTTPResume, trying to get it
downloaded on my PC was a nightmare! The download keeps interupting and
theres no Http Resume like program on PC's. What a load of MS crap!.


Anyway, this method is not recomended for novices, so if you don't feel
happy getting it set up, then you could wait of either AmosPC clone, or
Portable AmosNG.

See ya.

No. Your probem is another.. AMOSPro v1.12 sucks!

hehe :) Yes it's a simple concept, but AMOS doesn't support it and so the
DataBench extension is welcome.

MUI

Yes, it's slow, and it chews through the chipRAM, but it seems to be becoming
some sort of a de-facto standard for the Amiga (in the absence of a developing
OS that is). I REALLY don't want to get into an argument over this, but I just
see it as another way that AMOS gets left behind if MUI isn't supported (much
in the same way that Intuition was not supported until recently), and so
no-one took it (AMOS) seriously despite it's obvious power. As far as EASYlife
goes, Paul Hickman got it to work, but it was more 'proof of concept' than a
useable extension in regards MUI (His words), and many of MUI's more recent
functions are unsupported. Further, it's not very intuitive to use the
extension with MUI, not nearly as nice as GadToolsBox + GUIExt.
Please let's not start a big back and forth argument over this.
All the best
Rod Whiteley.

AmosPro, GUI Ext & Arexx

Mon Nov 23, 1998 10:39 am
"Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>


I am having difficulty with my program recognising Arexx commands.

I am using the GUI extension and the value -10 for Gui Wait to capture an
Arexx command. This is where my problem starts as I cannot get this part to
recognise the Arexx command. I am using the same code as printed in the GUI
Ext. docs and have inserted a Gui Beep at the beginning to visually alert me
when an Arexx command is received. I run my program and the GUI opens on
workbench. I send an Arexx command to my programs Arexx port via the shell
but there is no visual alert which leads me to believe there is a problem.

As a further test I go through the AmosPro manual and use some code from
that to do the same test. I run my program and from the shell I address my
programs Arexx port......it works!

Is there a problem with the GUI extension and Arexx or am I just not doing
it right?

Any help would be appreciated.

Declan.

I agree, but if you were to write up some procedures, the job would be done
in half the time, and for the more recent features you could use the .fd's

Bug or Feature?

Mon Nov 23, 1998 7:16 pm
citrone <citrone@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de>


hi girlz and boys,

last i ve written a small prog to see how fast the scrolling in amos
is...
i ve opend a large screen, say 1000*1000*32 and paste few bobs around
the
screen... what happens? Few Bobs where displayed correct and few dosent
displayed. How can this be? After a while I found that all Bobs at the
bottom of the screen never been displayed. this was after the 500'th
lines..?

Later I test it in 320*1000*32 but in this reolution everything works
correctly?

btw, trying the same with ICONS in 1000*1000 also doesnt works. Any1 can

test this to see if you have the same bug??

thanx

Have you updated the amos library file yet? I found I had a similar problem
with trying to draw graphics below that height, and all the problem was, was
a poor version of the amos library file OS 3.1. I think I might still have
the location of where to get it I`ll repost to the list when I find it.

Wanted : Arexx source to Amos/ASM/C/BlitzBasic source converter

Mon Nov 23, 1998 12:07 am
Geoff Crankshaw <steptoe@thescrapyard.demon.co.uk>


Hello People,

Would anyone like to take up this programming challenge for me in Amos ??


Introduction
------------
I have been looking for an arexx compiler for 4 years,I have yet to find
one. That includes looking through Amiga magazines,PD disks,web sites,ftp
sites,mailing anyone I can think of,and leaving messages on BBS,but to no
avail.

I do not want another line compiler and executable converter. I have all
of them.......



I want a program that will convert an arexx script into machine code,that
will run stand alone and a damm sight faster than normal.

If not this,convert an arexx script into another langauge that I can them
compile.



Ideas
-----
I have got the utils that have a go at converting Amos source into C and
BlitzBasic,but these are written in BlitzBasic !!

I have seen utils that can convert from languages like Modula 2 to Pascal
so I know it is possible.



Want
----
To be able to convert ANY arexx script,and convert it into ASM source,C
source,BlitzBasic source or even Amos source,that I can them compile and
speed up my most used scripts.



I want to be able to do this on one script that I use all the time to
remove those annoying BBS adds from my archives,its very good,but horribly
slow at loading the know adverts file into the array.











Suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~
If anybody has a script that will have the ability of going through an Lzx
OR Lha archive,picking out the nastly adverts,and saving them into a text
file that I can use either with the same program or with a dedicated
stripper I will be gratefull

The program MUST be able to handle the nasty things that people use for
advert filenames like '*' is a common one,and the blank filename that a lot
of the listers can't handle........




Thanks for any suggestions .......

Electronic breadboard to PCB designer .......

Sat Nov 21, 1998 12:02 pm
Geoff Crankshaw <steptoe@thescrapyard.demon.co.uk>


Hi There,


Will someone please tell me if a program that is on the PC is available on
the Amiga,or something very similiar to it.




The program does the following :

You design you're electronic circuit on a virtual breadboard,not worring
about crossing the wire,just draw it exactly how you would on a rough piece
of paper,then press a button,and let the program convert you're very messy
looking breadboard design into a full designed PCB,ready to be printed out
onto anything you want......

Presumably a transparency,then you can just use UV light to create the
PCB on a copper sheet........



And there you go,its about £150 just for a really basic version,and the
'proper' version is about £700 on the PC !!!!!!!!



I've tried all the electronic CAD programs that I can find on the AmiNet
for the Amiga,and they are very good at designinga layout or designing a
PCB,but the program I'm after will convert a breadboard design into a PCb
for you.





Thanks for any help anyone can give me.....

Poke to memory

Wed Nov 25, 1998 8:44 am
"Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>


Can anyone tell me why poking negative values to a memory bank results in a
totally different value being stored.
i.e. Poking -45 to a memory bank results in a value of 211 being returned if
you peek the same memory location.

Is this an AmosPro problem or a standard within computing? Thanks in
advance.

Declan.

I think this is a common way to handle negative values using a byte (as
256-45=211). I'm not sure how amos detects that it's negative (maybe there is a
flag or something).

This is no AMOS error! Actually you can't "normally" handle negative numbers
on a computer. When ever you poke, doke or loke a negative number to memory,
you will really poke the maximum number + your negative number.

Say you want to enter -1 in the memory. This is what really happens:

Poke (1 byte): 255 + (-1) = 254
Doke (2 bytes): 65535 + (-1) = 65534
Loke (4 bytes): 4294967296 + (-1) = 4294967295

When you peek a result back to your program, you should be aware, if you're
looking for a negative number and then use like peek(address)-255 to get your
result back.

What you would normally do is to say, that the bottom half of the results are
positive and the upper half of the results are negative. Like (for 1
byte/peek/poke):

0-127 = positive (0 -> 127)
128-255 = negative (-127 -> 0)

This is identical to saying that the first bit holds a sign which tells, if
the number is positive (0) or negative (1).

It`s 2`s complement. To store a -ve number, you take the absolute
value (45), write it in binary (00101101), invert all the bits
(11010010), then add 1 (11010011). If you were to then write that in
base 10, you`d get 211. Since the most significant bit of the number
is 1, we know it`s -ve. This is, therefore, a signed integer...

Now, since AMOS is returning 211 instead of -45 when you peek the
memory, it appears that it reads all memory contents as unsigned
integers instead, and so doesn`t do the 2`s complement conversion to
give you the actual result.

Whether you class this as a problem or not is debateable, since there
are times when you want to read bytes as unsigned ints, and if you
want to retrieve the value as a -ve number, you can always write a
simple 2`s complement function (reverse the above process) to return
the actual -ve value. In other words, if you know that you`ve been
writing signed ints to memory, you can always retrieve the -ve values
with just an extra function call, and if you know you`ve been writing
unsigned ints, you just take the values as peek returns them.

This is infact quite logical because a byte can only hold 256 different numbers
(0 - 255). When poking a negative number into memory you'll get an overflow (or
"underflow" ;) error. To get around this you can use numbers 0 - 127 for
positive numbers (0 - 127) and 128 - 255 (-127 - -1) for negative numbers. This
is the only way to get a signed byte. If you need more use words which has 65536
possible unsigned values.

Subject: [amos-list] Wanted : Arexx source to Amos/ASM/C/BlitzBasic
source converter


From: Geoff Crankshaw <steptoe@thescrapyard.demon.co.uk>

Hello People,

Would anyone like to take up this programming challenge for me in Amos ??


Introduction
------------
I have been looking for an arexx compiler for 4 years,I have yet to find
one. That includes looking through Amiga magazines,PD disks,web sites,ftp
sites,mailing anyone I can think of,and leaving messages on BBS,but to no
avail.

I do not want another line compiler and executable converter. I have all
of them.......



I want a program that will convert an arexx script into machine code,that
will run stand alone and a damm sight faster than normal.

If not this,convert an arexx script into another langauge that I can them
compile.



Ideas
-----
I have got the utils that have a go at converting Amos source into C and
BlitzBasic,but these are written in BlitzBasic !!

I have seen utils that can convert from languages like Modula 2 to Pascal
so I know it is possible.



Want
----
To be able to convert ANY arexx script,and convert it into ASM source,C
source,BlitzBasic source or even Amos source,that I can them compile and
speed up my most used scripts.



I want to be able to do this on one script that I use all the time to
remove those annoying BBS adds from my archives,its very good,but horribly
slow at loading the know adverts file into the array.











Suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~
If anybody has a script that will have the ability of going through an Lzx
OR Lha archive,picking out the nastly adverts,and saving them into a text
file that I can use either with the same program or with a dedicated
stripper I will be gratefull

The program MUST be able to handle the nasty things that people use for
advert filenames like '*' is a common one,and the blank filename that a lot
of the listers can't handle........




Thanks for any suggestions .......

I could be wrong, but a negative number is signified by a bit being set. So, a
peek would not return the proper value, you'd have to do a bit of converting.

You'll speed up all floating point operations... This will be
especially noticable in thing like Lightwave and imagine etc. but
won't make a difference in any games (well, probably not) - games
like alien breed will use integer math so speeding up floating point
maths wont help. As far as I know, one FPU is pretty much the same as
another - but I'd assume the more expensive ones are faster.
You'll need an FPU that's compatible with your 030 card though...

I think that's right.

It's a general problem with addressing, the reason is simple, bit it's
a bit tricky to explain...

Amos stores integers as signed longwords (32 bytes) when doing a poke/
Doke the unneeded bytes is cut off. The reson you end up with 211 stored
is that 0 in binar is just 32 bits with value '0', and to create negative
numbers you then use the high-bit (bit 31) as a 'sign'-bit, but in order
to make calculations easier you then define -1 as all bytes set high..

-45 binar looks like this: '11111111 11111111 11111111 11010011' when
you poke that the unneeded bytes is lost so the stored value is '11010011'
which happens to be 211. The same happens if you store as words with Doke
then the result is 65491.. Remember that the sign is NOT lost when you
do this, the sign-bit has just become bit 7(bytes) or 15(words) rather
than the normal 31..

You re-create the signing for bytes by simply using '=256-Peek(a)' and
for words '=65536-Deek(a)'. An alternative it to 'extend' the byte to
a longword (supported by some extensions) other extensions like AMCAF
and Tools has commands for reading signed bytes and words...

When you use signed bytes and words you move the 'range' of values you
usualy have availeble, so an unsigned byte holds 0 -> 255 while a signed
byte ranges -128 -> 127, same for words, the unsigned range is
0 -> 65535, the signed is -32768 -> 32767..

Disk Error

(Date unavailable)
"David Smith" <dsmith@bexley.u-net.com>


I thought I would share some information that I have discovered accidentally.
Someone somewhere might benefit from this one day.

Whilst attempting to load a half-completed programme recently from my hard
drive, I was dismayed to see the message `Disk Error' appear on my AMOS Pro 2
editor screen. After clearing this message, however, the screen remained
blank. Remembering that AMOS always makes a backup copy of all programmes in
the shape of a .bak file, I then attempted to load that file in its stead. But
the same error message was displayed. Clearly, the same error had been saved
more than once. Next I ran Quarterback Tools in order to sort out any disk
problems - but it wasn't that.

Reluctant to start work again from scratch on a 179K sized programme, I ran
the icon/bob editor to see what shape my bobs were in. To my surprise, they
were all still there, and it seemed incomprehensible that they should have
been loaded successfully without the main programme. I then closed the bob
editor and returned to the main editor screen; amazingly, my programme now
appeared in it.

This was not the end of the problem, however. The cursor refused to move below
the first line. Hitting the `down cursor' key merely caused the "bottom of
text" message to appear in the information line, and clicking in the text had
no effect. Pressing Return made the first line of my programme disappear.
Using the Edit/Information menu showed me that AMOS thought my programme was
the correct length, that it had about the correct number of instructions, but
that it had zero visible lines. After a little more fiddling about I finally
used the Procedure/Open and Close menu commands - after this I found that the
cursor would then move to any position in my programme. I immediately saved
the programme again under a different name, hoping my problems were over.

I tried loading my newly-named programme only to receive the same disk error
message - which was becoming tiresome now. By trial and error, I eventually
worked out that the problem was caused by an apparently over-sized icon; once
that was deleted the programme then saved and re-loaded properly. Fortunately
for me I had not removed the sequence of instructions from my programme which
had drawn the icon I had created with the Get Icon command.

No maximum icon size is shown in my AMOS manual, and I was wondering whether
anyone knew what it was. (Mine was almost the width of a hi-res screen, but
now I use a packed screen to display the image).

Yep, off topic again... but - I'm trying to write some programming
tutorials (on AMOS ) on the web - so I suppose it's not *that* off
topic. The problem I've got is getting the 'less-than' character (ie.
<) printed on a web page, so I can have lines like "If A<B Then" etc.
Just typing that in as text doesn't work as the'<' represents a tag
in HTML and so loads of my text disappears into and abyss or
somewhere after that. Any help would be much appreciated...

It's both..

I've been reading through the answers people have written, and most of them are
correct... ;-)

..but they missed out the reason why.

The method you are using to store your numbers is different to the way you
are retriving the numbers, it's like mixing integer variables and real floating
point numbers. Poke assumes you are storing a number from -128 to 127, and peek
assumes you are reading a number from 0 to 255. This of course, causes the
whole thing to be offset a bit (cough).

It's the same as saying l=3.4 and wondering why it comes out 3 in integer.
There
isn't the space for the .4, so it ignores it. Same with the negative. There
isn't space to poke a negative number, so it converts it to a positive.

Except you are going to read this message re-written and commented on by every
member of the list... Have fun. Don'tcha just love binary ?

Hi Rev. Giark,

I have installed ST3 and the Moded but I get an error 'can`t open
narrator', when I try to edit events or anything below that.
When I try to test the module it also has the same message.
When I load th module in the game proper it loads the data then crashes
with the error 'illegal function call'.
Any ideas?

There is a way round it: poke all your variables in as strings of the same
length, read them back also as strings and then do a VAL on what has been
retrieved. If normal rules don't work - cheat!

Yeah that'll be a bit slow though. Just do A=Poke ADDRESS : If A>127
Then Add A,-256.

That should work.
Probably.

I believe that was me that made it available. I've already sent the

(Parrottsoft) is finally getting underway tomorrow, so go there and get it.
For the Extension-list, you'll have to talk to Rune about it. :)

I've got the doc's, but I have yet to scan them (technical difficulties).

Oh my god! How much memory do you want to use... and dont get me started on
speed!
What do you mean Poke is expecting you to be poking a number between -128
and 127? Poke is filling the available bits.. (8 in a byte) with the
information on the integer! which will be stored as 0 to 255 same as peek
reads it in as 0 to 255... If you want a way round it do as others have said
use an offset of 127 so if you want to poke -10 actually poke 127-10 = 117
then when you read it in reverse the equation
A = peek( Address ) : A= A - 127 : A = 10

there you go!
GoodEvening and Welcome!

Whoops, I meant A=Peek ADDRESS...

Oh yes and 255 in 8-bit is 11111111, so which is -1 if you want it
signed. ie. 255=-1... 128=-127... hence my previous code


I think that's right.

Whoops, another debug, it should be 128=-128 above... My code should
have read:
A=Peek ADDRESS
If A>127 Then Add A,-256
And that's it. Providing you're only wanting to store numbers between
-128 and 127 this'll work fine (ie. you can poke as normal but peek
using the above method - poke Address,-100 will be peeked as -100
using the above. Probably.)

I really do think this is right now.

I never claim that my solutions are fast, neat or economical on memory. I only
claim that this one works with any number and thereby solves the problem first
put forward. It should also work with decimal point and hex numbers, if anyone
thinks that's worth anything. But I'm sure someone out there has a faster,
neater, more environmentally friendly way of doing it - there always is!

Turbo Plus V2.00 Docs..

Fri Nov 27, 1998 10:17 pm
Jens Vang Petersen <top_cat@post8.tele.dk>


Hello, Everyone..

Just an anouncement, I've just about had it with my loose-pile-of-paper-
floating-all-over-the-place-doc-system for Turbo Plus V2.00, so I've
started to write an amiga-guide as a fast-reference for the extension,
I'll make it availeble along with the extension itselve on the Amos
Factory later this weekend (I hope)... ;-)

BAR and double buffers

Sat Nov 28, 1998 6:42 am
Leto Kauler <letok@netspace.net.au>


Okay -- stupid question time...

If I use a "Bar" command, would it be quicker to draw it on a
Non-double-buffered screen or a double-buffered screen, or would
it be the same? It seems obvious that it _would_ be quicker
without buffering, but I'd just like to check with knowledgable
people!

It is indeed slower to use it with a double buffered screen, because it
has to draw the bar twice for each buffer:

''''''''''' Single buffer:

Bar 0,0 to 100,100 etc..


''''''''''' Double buffer:
Double buffer
Autoback 0

bar 0,0 to 100,100
screen swap
bar 0,0 to 100,100 etc..



Ofcorce, you don't /have/ to draw 2 bars in double buffer mode, it'll
just flicker on and off as you swap screens (you might want this effect;)

See ya.

Hello, Everyone..

The extensionlists at the AMOS Factory has been updated again. New this
time is download of Turbo Plus V2.00, and an AmigaGuide commandreference
for that extension.. BTW: The AmigaGuide is stored in seperate archive,
so it's not required to download the entire extension..

Music Extension

Sat Nov 28, 1998 11:08 am
Jens Vang Petersen <top_cat@post8.tele.dk>


Hello, Everyone..

I noticed some time ago that the music extension was obsolete (true)
and that it would proberly be removed in future updates. Well I just
wondered, what about the support for 'narrator.device' and the two
file commands 'Sload' and 'Ssave' which proberly are the only realy
usefull commands in that extension (Sload and Ssave should proberly
belong in the IO_Devices anyway..)

Trouble Compiling

Sun Nov 29, 1998 12:56 am
Christopher Kossa <abattoir@erols.com>


Hello AMOS Users...

When I try to compile any program while using the new "AMOSPro.Lib",
every compiled program when ran says "Illegal Function Call Line 7". Has
anyone else noticed this?

Also, anyone using a Picasso IV (with P96) have problems with Interlace
screens in AMOS jumping a lot?

Your right, Even programs that I compiled before I upgraded the
AmosPro.lib don't work. And some of my more complex programs actually
crash my amiga when compiled. What's going on? I'll have to find my old
AMOSPro.Lib now ;(.

I have a 4000T 060/PPC. Every program I tried, even a one like:

Print "Hello World!"

would give me an "Illegal Function Call" error.

I have an 030/50. I'm not sure what Pietro has, but it looks like it might
have difficulties with either 060 or ppc. I've compiled programs and they all
work fine.

I'm using the new AMOSPro.Lib without any problems, but I'm not programming

supposed to, what type of interface are you using AmosScreen or Gui???.

No problems on 060, it might be that PPC B***S***, there seems to be lotsa

And, if you were wondering, I use both gui extension interface and amos

This might sound like a completely stupid idea, ie you`ve probably tried this,
or you might not have done, but;-

Are you running the compiled version of AMOS Compiler? If you are, and you
haven`t already re-compiled the compiler shell, it might be worth doing so. So
basically what I`m on about is loading the compiler into amospro editor,
compiling it with itself, and saving out the finished amigados only version, and
running that. I might not even work, but it could be worth a try!

Well, it works with my A1200 PPC/040 and I know my RPG works no prob
on an 060, so it should work perfectly.

PS. If you do get a PPC, Don't upgrade your Flashrom yet, the current
one has lotsa bugs in it ;(

I tried with just the Music, Compactor, Requestor, IODev, and Compiler
extension. Installed the AMOSPro.Lib and I still get the same error.

Poor Pietro, with all the bugs he's trying to fix the old Amos, he'll never
