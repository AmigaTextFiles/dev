Is their any way to make the clock run off the power from the PSU?

I don't understand why Amiga clocks don't work that way normally, so if
the power gos out you'll have to reset your Amiga clock with all the 
other clocks in your house BIG FUCKING WHOOP 'T' DUE it's better then
having to fuck with dead batteries!

Hello, all !

It seems that my old Amos 1.34 does not like my blizzard 030/50+32Fast.
When I run an executable file, I get an "Illegal function call".
If I do a "NoFastMem", then recompile my prog, it runs fine !

Anyone knows about this bug ? Is there a fix ? Am I getting nut ?

Subject: [amos-list] Hi-Res-Laced and Printing Screens on an Amiga 1200 in Amos Pro V2.0
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: David Brian Hayes <dbh02@students.stir.ac.uk>

I`m a student at Stirling University, and I am wanting to earn myself a
little extra cash! I am into personal electronics, and have wanted to
write a PCB creator for some time. I turned to my good old faithful Amos
Pro, while I had an A500, and the programming started to pick up pace.
The things that I wanted to happen, were working.
Then I got an A1200!!! Great I thought, this should speed up my creation
of the program, but it has stopped it dead in it`s tracks!
 On an A500, when I do a "Screen Open 0,640,512,16,Hires+Laced" it
opened up a hires-laced screen, yet the same command on an A1200 opens
up a hires screen only, no laced. This is a bit of a bummer! But wait
there`s more;-
 On an A500, when I did a screen print with sizing options, it printed
the screen in the write dimensions on my printer, yet on an A1200, my
computer gets a guru-meditation error something like 800000004 or
something. Can anyone out there in Amos land help?

This problem has actually been fixed :)
So go to this address:  http://www.seta.it/amos    (The AMOS Factory)
And there you'll find the latest update with the interlaced screens fix
and the limit bob fix ;)

Don't know about that. I don't use AMOS to print.

This is a bug with the old AMOS library and OS3.1

   There's a fixed version in 

http://users.cybercity.dk/~ccc21504/amos/front.html

Not sure on this one. It could be your printer driver? Does it print out
other things fine on your A1200.

   My old A1200 got busted and it hang up every time it tried to access
the printer.

   If you like you could send me the printing routines and I'll test
them on my A1200.


See ya.

   Heres a little trick I used when I had an accelerator with no
battery:


   I used Synclock every time I wen't online, that way my email always
showed the right time.

   Of cource, its easier to have a battery backed up clock.... but no if
its leakin! 

See ya.

Doesn't that cause the clock PRAM to clear when you turn off your Amiga?

I was thinking more like connecting up the PSU with the battery terminals,
or maybe an external AC to DC converter.

	An external backup-system? Personally I don't think you should
	bother with the PSU. You can't turn half of it off without a lot of
	extra switches. And connecting an AC/DC converter involvs
	as much soldering as changing the battery, I guess.
	My suggestion is that you mount a battery-"holder" (Sorry, but I
don't
	know the english word for it) so you can change battery more easily
	in the future. Also, if the battery starts to leak, the acid won't
get anywere.

	>Please stop using HTML.

	I wish I could. But there's no option in Outlook97 (NOT Outlook
Express)
	to do so. I've tried everything I could think of.
	I'm sorry, really, but...
	If anyone on the list could assist, I'd be greatful.

I use...

	Screen Open 0,640,512,16,Hires Or Laced

...in AMOSPro v2.0 running on my A1200 and I have no problems with that.
Use "Or" instead of "+". This may solve the problem. Because the screen
mode has some spesific bits to be "Or"'ed and addition doesn't give the
same result.

#am!ga still exists ?
Wasnt it finished when StoneCold and Dor got banned from the net ?
(although he is back now...but stone is still gone ;)

Speaking of IRC, #amos only ever has a small few people there ;(
when your online you should pay a visit to #amos on IRCNET
(irc.stealth.net/irc.bt.net), there are still many amos coders
which arn't on this list that hang out there. Thats where I got
the 'AMOS Optimizer' (which I have now lost ;( ).

Yep, I discovered it a few months before they dissapeared
(when I still wasn't very active on IRC).
There are still some guys from time to time.

> Speaking of IRC, #amos only ever has a small few people there ;(

Well, there always seen to be a bunch of Germans who come
to 'see' Citrone ;) and some tori-amos fan people who join and leave
after finding out it's not about tori-amos, but there are enough real
AMOS users on the channel to not call it dead ;)

Speaking of #amos, was it started by Digital and Cosmo (ville ranke) ?

You're right, everyone should go there ;)

X-Status: 

From: "Rune J. Keller" <keller@vip.cybercity.dk>

Just a short note to tell you, that I've moved the Amos Factory to Xoom. This
means, that the new URL for the site is:

http://members.xoom.com/AmosFactory

You can still reach it through the old URLs, though.

The move to Xoom has been done to obtain more space (11MB prior to 2MB) and
allowing more people to work on the site. First of all this means that Jens
Vang Petersen will now join the site, with his extension page. Thus allowing
you to download and read about all the extensions for Amos. This will be
completed in the very near future.

Thanks.

42.7 ?sounds like youve clocked it 8o)
The reason for ST2 not working for more than 2 mins,
is more than likely coz of being a Apollo board (if it is ?)

Apollo boards dont like AMOS afaik. if you wanted ST2 to work,
just disable the board boot without startup sequence, and
run it from dos.

(I dont have a apollo card, but it should work)

I hope ST3 is more stable than ST2.. ;)

I never got to play it for more than 2mins without it crashing.. :(
a great shame too, because it looks like a brilliant game.

Hello David

On 03-Nov-98, David Brian Hayes smashed the keyboard with:

This problem belongs to the IO-extension that handles all printer
operations in AMOS Pro. When you call 'Printer Dump' there are
several various ways of calling, the longest (and most valuable
version) however crashes due to a stack-handling error in the
extension. I've managed to hack the extension with a simple hex-
editor and simply removed the troubled part (no the best solve,
but it works) I uploaded the thing to the list some time ago, but
it appears that most readers didn't notice, so here it is again ;-)

(Just copy it over the old one in APsystem..)

If you are going to upload it with source, then definitely dev/amos .. If
not, then demo/ecs or demo/file would be a good choice, I think...

After a long absence from the list, I'm back and ST3 is rolling along. I've
almost finished the module editor. SoloTrekIII is no longer just a star trek
simulator. I've managed to make a car wars style module for it. The
possibilities are huge. There's some info on the amos pages. Soon, I will have
the FBN website back up and you will be able to check out more of the info, as
well as grabbing the fine FBN products there for dl.

Could be.

>(I dont have a apollo card, but it should work)

ST2 runs fine on my 1230/50, too. It may be that you didn't get the aga fix
for it. The aga graphic file got corrupted in the original somehow.

Hey! Someone actually got my email and it wasn't all
gobble-de-gook! Cool!

called "explosiveCHAOS" -- a bomber / dynablaster type game....

Aminet with a search for "echaos"

I'm planning on a "eCHAOS_2".... but I don't know if i'll be able
to program it well enuf :^/

So chek it out every1 -- i'd appreciate comments!

Hello, all.

I've just uploaded Old-Fx, the demo I wrote. If I did everything well,
it will be soon in the drawer demo/file.

You can see another product I did in game/gag.
It is a very little game where you have to send pies in Bill Gate's
face.
http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/public/aminet/info/www/dirs/aminet/game/gag/piebill.lha
(or any mirror)
The .readme file is absolutely weird, I typed it on a Mac, and the
carriage returns are not recognised by Aminet. Well, there is nothing
important.

regards

--BOUNDARY.7615.1420.1747168024.1
Content-Type: text/plain

Hello everyone,

I have attatched some code that might be helpful to some beginners.

I hope you can forgive me for it being 40k in size;(

But after seeing someone's game, a bomberman clone, I had to send this code
so that they could see how it would be beter done. Plus, if anyone wants to
contact me about finishing off one of the games, then feel free :) 

Please tell me off if it's too big. I promise no more large files. 

I hope the code is good enough to let me off the hook ;)

Anyhow, See ya all soon,

and drop into #amos...Citrone and myself get lonely ;)

Jono.

Subject: [amos-list] AMOS to Back problems
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: "Declan Gorman" <declan_gorman@modusmedia.com>

I am having a problem when putting Amos Pro behind the workbench screen I
cannot get it back.  I reckon it is down to carelessness on my part but it
really pisses me off when I have to reboot or launch another copy of Amos
Pro and I usually lose what I just edited.

I know that left-Amiga A switches Amos Pro to front and back, but when this
does not work is there any other way?  Thanks in advance.

Declan.

anyway having reinstalled it all, I can't get the damn
gui compiler to work. :(

(v1.70)

can't find the damn patch prog anyway..

   Hmmm, I don't know, PALLE could be confusing to pronounce.

Could just be PAL, for Pc Amos-like Language. Then you couls have .PAL

My main hard disk physically died the other night.  Simultaneously, a 
clerical error deleted my website.  I'm not quite sure how much survived,

   You can't do that with craft, can you? surly he wants DOOM Music
Extention. Then you can play samples over tracker mods.

   /Or/

   I've managed to get Octamed multichannel mods working with only 2ch.
(with a large hack) leaving 2 channels free for sfx.



See ya.

X-Status: 

From: Tony Gray <tony_gray@uk.ibm.com>

Hi everybody,

Just an introduction...
I've just started refamiliarising myself with Amos after a good 3-4 year
lay-off.

I'm still using my A500+ bought a good 7 years ago. I generally use it to 'mess
about'.
My programming skills (Amos or otherwise) are too clumsy to have produced
anything
spectacular but I still enjoy it. The only programs written to date are a
Trapeze type game
and a Q+A with pictures for identifying Silver hallmarks and Maker's marks.

My major problem is my imagination. I have lots of ideas for games but I can
never
stick at something long enough. I understand the techniques and theory behind
writing
computer programs. I just haven't got the discipline to stick to it. It's
probably a case
of enjoyment vs results.

Anyway, looking forward to checking out some of the discussions but don't
expect too
much from me on the technical side.

Thanks

Tony

Subject: [amos-list] Keyboard tests...
Status: O
X-Status: 

From: Zangiacomi Sylvain <szan@club-internet.fr>


    Hi you all,

 Today, I tried a small code on an Amiga with an Infinitiv keyboard 
interface to use with the original keyboard of this machine.

I tried this:

Do 
   A=0
   If Key State(16) Then Add A,1
   If Key State(17) Then Add A,2
   Print A
Loop 

On an AZERTY, pressing key A will print 1, B will print 2, and normally
pressing A and B together will print 3. 

But on this keyboard interface, it is only A or B, no way to detect
multi pressed keys.

Very bad for action games with keyboard. Is there a way to really test
the states of the keyboard (that was possible on my poor A500) ?

  Bye, Sylvain

On many amigas, (like A1200), it can't detect more then one keypress on
the same row eg
.
on a qwerty keyboard, these keys don't work together:
qwertyuiop[] etc.

You'll have to make sure you map the keyboard carefully.

   (The cursor keys are a pain, each one conflicts with one of the main
rows ;(


See ya.

   There is not such command built in to AMOS, so you'll have to use a
different program. You can do this of you find either:

A cli program, you'd do Exec "pri Lightwave.fp PRI 1"

A program with Arexx, not sure how.

Unless theres an extention to do that.

----------
Would it be possible to get on an upgrade list of some kind so that when
AmosPro2 is available again, that those in NEED get notified ASAP.

I'm doing some heavy duty programming and version 1 locks up many times a
day. From what I've been told, version 2 is my salvation.

I saw the posting about being available in December, but the suspense is
killing me!

Hi.

Can anyone tell me how to set the priority of a task, via
AmosPro2..?

I've combed through my Amos1.3 and EasyAmos Manuals and
I can't find a command thats suitable. :(

(I'm working on a gui that allows you to set the priority
of Lightwave.)

I could do with a command like 

SetPri Lightwave.fp PRI=-1

anyone help..?


Steve

   Hmmm, the SetPri command doesn't come with 3.0, is it with 3.1 or
something? Well, you'll have to find that program or similar.


See ya.

Hello...

  I have an 060/PPC and AmosPro 2 with the latest library from the Amos
Factory.  I cannot get Amos to run unless I have SnoopDos running.  I
tried to use SnoopDos to see why Amos keeps crashing, but instead I found
out the way to keep Amos from crashing!  Anyone have a clue why this is
happening?

Greetings,
  I have the CU Amiga disk 76 copy of the Craft Extension available if
anyone is interested.  Craft adds 160 new commands to Amos including ones
for generating fractals and playing music modules.  Craft works with both
Amos and Amos Pro.  Email me privately if you want it.

Hi Everybody,

Has anybody produced any AMOS (pro or 135) Line of Sight or shortest path
procedures?
How efficient are they and how does the Amiga handle them?

I'm just delving into basic AI. The theory sounds fair enough but I'm worried
about
the processing power.

Thanks

Tony

 So I tried :

Do
  Print Key State (51)
Loop

If I keep pressing key c, it prints -1, but if during this time I press
any other key (I've tried all !), it prints 0, and never comes back 
to -1 !

Only key shift works fully togheter (Ctrl,2 Shifts, 2 Amigas, 2 Alts).

Games with keyboards are no more possible with such poor hardware.

 See Ya.

   Funny, when I tried that with my A1200, the C key worked fine with
every key except with a few others on that line.

   I guess its a limitation with your keyboard interface ;(

yeah, 3 ways in fact...

load the exe into a bank, and do Call bnk no.

load the exe into memory, do Call $address

write a extension.

Hi Amosiams ;)


I'm in a coding mood, so I'm going to start a new proggy
and before I attempt such a huge task (I'm a lame coder!) I need
to know if any of my ideas are possible with AmosPro2.


These are the ideas I have, could you please say whether AmosPro
could do these, and if they would be hard or easy to code.?

(the only extension I have installed is the SUPERB gui extension
version 1.70)

things I'd like to do are:-


a file locator util (using a gui)

a CDRom tray open/close util (gui)

a util that uses speech to tell me what frame imagine/Lw
is currently rendering and how long the last frame took to
render.

a simple game (like the old food fight..)
(I'm not sure amos can display enough sprites..!?!!)


please forgive me if I'm asking any dumb things, but to be
honest I'm a very very lame coder..  although I'm 
enthusiastic...  I'm really a 3d bod, not a programmer..
but hey, amos is fun...

Steve

Of course, if you know how to do it.

I think that this would be easier in Arexx?

   Amos can display 4 and 16 colour sprites, and Bobs no problem. It
also handels sprite/bob collisions for you.

Hello Stephen

On 14-Nov-98, Stephen Thornber smashed the keyboard with:

That should be simple, perhaps you should get the 'EasyLife'
extension to handle the directories and perhaps pattern-match..

 
> a CDRom tray open/close util (gui)

That includes some direct device access, but still quite simple..

 
> a util that uses speech to tell me what frame imagine/Lw

I havn't got a clue on this, sorry..

 
> a simple game (like the old food fight..)
> (I'm not sure amos can display enough sprites..!?!!)

Perhaps you could do it using bobs ??

Well, we all started as 'lame' coders on some level, perhaps
on the C64 or in AmigaBasic, and I know that I'm sometimes
a bit anoyed with my first coding. I can't belive the amount
of Goto's I was using ;-))

Ehh, sometimes, It's possible to include executable code in an amosprogram,
either as a bank or a 'sealed' procedure. The process is descriped in
the AMOS Pro manual, but try and look in the on-line-help on 'Pload' and
'Call' that should provide some idea. On how to do.. But as noted in the
manual, It don't always work..

Are the following bugs being addressed for the next amos release?

Change the default screen to less than four colours and your sound gets
screwed up. Sam Play won't work, and the built in sounds, Boom, Shoot and Bell
will guru the Amiga.

Sam Loop Off gets switched to Sam Loop On after a run. The command still
works, but it gets shown on the screen improperly.

I hope using the GUI Extension :o)

Of course.... 

You can do it very easly using a FD extension with exec.library support:

TASK$="Lightwave.fp" : TSK=_Lvo Findtask(varptr(TASK$))
IF TSK><0 Then PRI=-1 : OLD=_Lvo Settaskpri(TSK,PRI)

or you can use the boring standard way:

TASK$="Lightwawe.fp" : Areg(1)=Varprt(TASK$) : TSK=Execall(-294)
IF TSK><0 Then PRI=-1 : Areg(1)=TSK : Dreg(0)=PRI : OLD=Execall(-300)

Hello Rev.

> Are the following bugs being addressed for the next amos release?

NO! Why? Because in the next release the Music Extension will be probably
removed forever!! It is the most stupid,bugged,bad written Amos extension
in the world! *AMCAF will be a total replacement.* It give you TRUE
protracker support (v3.5+) with /CIA /and /VBL /replay mode, and the
possibility to play samples over the tracker (.. and many other cool
functions)

Where possible i'll *destroy* the old Amos code, replacing it with a better
one. The AMOS asm sources are a collection of bad code! Now i'm working on
the devices interface, since i've to totally rewrite it!!! :(((( I've
discovered a really nasty surprise in the code.... In order to work propely
with the devices (like the printer.device, serial.device etc) you need to
call some exec.library functions not available in the old OS1.3... so
Francois Lionet in order to keep the OS1.3 compatibility has disassembled!
the linker library Amiga.Lib (.. wich provide the necessary 1.3 functions)
and inserted the code in the main AMOSPro lib! So now i've to work with
some rubbish like this:

L7C7D97A        MOVE.L  #$10001,-(A7)
        PEA     $22.W
        BSR     L7C7DAD0
        MOVEA.L D0,A2
        EXG     D7,A2
        TST.L   D7
        EXG     D7,A2
        ADDQ.L  #8,A7
        BNE.S   L7C7D9A4
        MOVE.L  D6,-(A7)
        BSR     L7C7DB28
        MOVEQ   #0,D0
        ADDQ.L  #4,A7
        BRA.S   L7C7D9E6
L7C7D9A4        MOVE.L  D4,$A(A2)
        MOVE.B  D3,9(A2)
        MOVE.B  #4,8(A2)
        CLR.B   $E(A2)
        MOVE.B  D6,$F(A2)
        CLR.L   -(A7)
        BSR     L7C7DB00
        MOVE.L  D0,$10(A2)
        TST.L   D4
        ADDQ.L  #4,A7
        BEQ.S   L7C7D9D8


nice eh?? and the other sources are like this.. no comments, no info...
nothing!
Now you can image my situation, and you can understand the reason for wich 
no one has updated Amos in the past years... someone has tried (.. the
several rumours) , but as we know nothing is happened. I've awaited too
many years, and now i won't give up! You already know my plans.. if i can't
really upgrade the main code, i'll expand it through our COOL extensions!

Final note: AMOS WILL NEVER WORK AGAIN ON THE OLD OS v1.3!

>  and the built in sounds, Boom, Shoot and  Bell will guru the Amiga.

Good :) I would kill everyone who has used this weird sounds in their
programs!

Hello!

Unfortnataly, due to lack of time and alike, ive had no choice
but to postpone the TGE beta perview due for today, I know
that a lot of you were awaiting it, but some things messed up
in the last minute, however, all I can say the the moment,
is that im sorry, and it will be out SOON, Im hopeing for next week,
it might be before and it might be after.

Also, before I release it I would like peeps opinions on
the buffering. I remember when I made games I always wanted
it to be this way, but some people may differ...

Atm, the buffering works like:

G Triple Buffer (or Double if you like...)
G Screen open .............

Then your main loop:
Do
....
....
....
....
G Swap Buffers          *** Swaps the buffers.
Loop

I prefere this was as in the origional amos way
you couldnt do this and it allows YOU to select when to
swap the buffers.

Comments plz!

if enough people want it without the swap buffers I might do it
as a option.

cyas,

Hi

Where do I get this FD extension, and how much is it..?

looks very complex though :)

Whilst I understand what you're writing, I've never come across a 
line like 'If TSK><0' before... What does it do? Does it mean 'If 
TSK>0 or TSK<0' or something else entirely. I'm confused...

"<>" or "><" means NOT EQUAL TO as in IF TSK IS NOT EQUAL TO 0 THEN BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH...

Ok, apologies again, seems this message got out more than once.  Don't
all complain at once, this bit is fixed, I just did a bulk mailing and
made an manual error.

I lost the whole contents of my hard disk, I'm getting no sleep, don't
hassle me right now, my email is working properly now.

> Pietro Ghizzoni

For all those who started their programming experience with Amos and that of
course includes young children the built-in sounds were great. With just a
few lines of code they could show a home drawn picture as a background and
have something happen with simple sound effects.
My point is that the value of Amos basic is that it is a *beginners*
language please don't forget that!
 -------------------------------------
While I'm typing I may as well try and restate a point I tried to make some
weeks ago. I said that Blitz failed to hook me like Amos did. My message was
taken to be a Blitz vs Amos flame. In fact I was complaining about the Blitz
manual, and this aspect of the new Amos must not be overlooked. Until I
subscribed to this list I never had any other source of help for my
programming than the Amos original & AmosPro manuals, both of which were
very good.  If a language is for beginners, and Basic is, then the
documentation must provide them with all the information they need,
including standard Basic structures.
 -------------------------------------
Fascinating insight into the poorly written structure of old Amos, thanks.
 -------------------------------------
Please keep up this considerable effort, the new Amiga will need a new Amos,
that's for sure!

Thanks

Hiya,

leave it all to settle :) Hazle's a mate simple (well ;) ).

Well I just got your last email just now,

know most of the people on this list have web pages of their own to 
worry about but I'm only asking for the odd article or request for 
articles, or some tips etc. It's designed to be mainly a BEGINNERS 
page...

I might shove on some of my AMOS programs for download (Space 
Monopoly my only COMPLETED project - it was in Amiga Format a few 
months ago) and maybe some extensions...

Anyway, if you've got any ideas then email me. I don't expect too 
much feedback on this because you all have your own web pages - but 
just a few ideas eh?

Thanks, David

Subject: [amos-list] New AMOS
Status: O
X-Status: 

From:          "David Vivash" <PMA98DAV@sheffield.ac.uk>

I've been off the list for a month or two now - and I keep seeing 
these messages appearing about a new AMOS... So what's all that about 
then?
Is this a brand new AMOS from scratch or some new extension? I've 
also noticed talk of AMOS for the PC. Presumably this isn't some naff 
Europress Klik & Play sort of thing so is it *really* amos for the 
pc? Now maybe I'm a pessimist but I don't see how AMOS could work on 
the PC as it does on the amiga. Anyone who's used a PC will know that 
it handles screens in a completely different way to the Amiga - which 
means a whole new approach will have to be brought in in handling 
screens when trying to convert AMOS-Amiga programs to AMOS-pc 
programs. Anyway, if it does work it'll be a good thing to get back 
to *fun* programming on a strictly non-fun machine.

 There would be a few things I would recommend to change in the 
editor though... Firstly, I presume this would run under Win95, and 
so if we are to stick to the way AMOS works by running interpreted 
code and creating compiled versions if you want them, it would mean 
the AMOS programs would have to run under win95. This is not 
necessarily a bad thing (you could make use of directx 6 for 
example), but if you're working from a win95 environment it would be 
expected you could write win95 applications. This is what worries me -
 has anyone considered how HUGE a programming language would have to 
be allow you to write win95 applications AND games. If anyone here 
has ever used something like Borland C++ builder or even Visual Basic 
you'll know how big these things are and you'd shudder at the thought 
of having just one person programming them. So AMOS-pc would have to 
be just for games I would say... unless anyone wants to argue with 
that.

    Of course, it's probable I've got the idea of AMOS-pc wrong 
entirely... I have programmed the pc a bit and I know there's 
not really any room for any more application builders. The one's out 
there are pretty good anyway at what they do... there's no decent 
games programming languages on the pc though. Keep that in mind...

Sorry for this rambled email. Probably got everything wrong but hey! 
I'm a programmer, it' my job to get things wrong... i'll come back 
and debug this email later...

David

Why do people stick with 1.3 anyway ?

its not as if its hard to get a a1200, they are practly free second hand,
and as it stands, 1.3 is prehistoric. Im supiresed that people with
1.3 still have it, I figured that the roms would have started to
detieriorate by now :o)

hehe :o)
I used to hate those sounds, but now the audio channels on my amiga
have started to die, so I can't hear them anymore :}

	Oh my god!! I'm dead them.
	I actually use them a lot , specially boom.
	Fact is that I use them for testing and positioning samples , so 
later on I can go over the prog and substitute it.
	For this only reason I think there should be built in sounds (beep)

Not so much bugs, but replacing the entire gfx system is a

nah, or nafaik. The amos system keeps swapping buffers
and slowing your program down, then logic and physic are diffrent
ways of doing it. via having one buffer in fast ( I think).

Actually, i should probably agree with this one, even though I very, very,
very rarely even think about using them.  Actually, I use bell to stop the
looping samples..  (normally muted though).

Hey Ghizzo, if you are replacing all the samples (cool !) bung in a default
couple of noises for "built in" stuff.

   Nop, I'm sorry, I still can't see how thats different to doing

Double Buffer
Autoback 0

do

   blah blah

   Screen Swap


loop.

   And surly having a buffer in fastmem would be slower, as doesn't the
amos system actually change the screens bitmap offsets to the other
buffer, meaning an instant swap? If the other buffer was in fastmem,
then you'd have to physically swap the memory.

   Anyway, if you can get it faster then thats enough reason for me ;)


See ya.

Can I just point out that AMCAF is not quite perfect yet for sound either.
It can't handle large samples.
I always use AMCAF for sound except for when the occasion arises and I need
a large sample played I have to go back to standard AMOS sound.

And I'll add that I play samples in excess of 64k all the time. If amcaf can't
handle them (I know dme wouldn't) then it's not a replacement at all.

No, not necessarily, and you could EASILY find some .ROM images of v2+
almost anywhere off the net in conjunction with a decent ROM kicker.

	It's FREE! Should be availible at the Official AMOS WWW.
	I've got v2.0 availible if you want it. Mail me privatly.

Just to let you know about the maintenance of the server running the mailing
list.

From: ONElist Tech Support <admin@onelist.com>


Hello,

This is a notice to let you know that the ONElist system will be down for 
scheduled maintenance on Wednesday, November 18 from 6pm to Midnight Pacific

Time. We continue to experience explosive growth; in the past three
months we have more than quadrupled our user base. To keep up with our
growth,
we are continuing to upgrade the hardware that runs the ONElist system.
That is what we will be doing Wednesday evening. Any email sent during
this time will be stored and sent out when the system is back up.

Michael Cox
