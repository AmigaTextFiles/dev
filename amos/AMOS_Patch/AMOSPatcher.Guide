@node intro "Introduction"

How many of you are getting seriously annoyed that you can't run more than 1
copy of AMOS at once?  A lot?, well, I am so I wrote this program as a test
to get as many copies running at once as possible!!!

This program has been tested with 3 programs running at once with the AMOS 
Pro editor still available!

@endnode
@node sysreq "System Requirements"

Any os2.04+ miggy will do nicely :)

You'll also need a copy of reqtools.library in your LIBS: dir....

@endnode
@node inst "Installation & Configs"

This part isn't easy!.  Follow the step below:-

1)  Load the AMOS Pro editor
2)  Select `Set Interpreter' from the `Config' menu.
3)  Select `Load Default Configuration'
4)  Select `System Configuration, Page 2'
5)  Choose a key flip combination that will only work with your program!
    E.g. The key flip for this program is Left Amiga, Left Shift, Ctrl P!!
    If you are writing a program in Freedom, Liberator, Intos etc, that 
    only uses workbench, then choose the reset keys as key flip.
    Ctrl, Left Amiga, Right Amiga A.
6)  Save that configuration.
7)  Quit from AMOS Pro & Load it back up again!
8)  Load up your program and compile it, make sure to include the 
    AMOS.library inside the compiled program.
9)  Load up the AMOS Patcher program
10) Select your compiled program.
11) The program is patched and saved!


Known Bugs
----------

These are really to do with AMOS!!!
Don't use the AMOS LOCK command, as another program can still flip the 
display!

Make sure that you include the amos library in compiled programs.

The patcher is a bit stupid!  It changes all references from `AMOS' to `AmPt'
If you must say your program is written in AMOS then use Amos 
instead.  The patcher is case sensitive.

That isn't all it does :)))

The main part of it tracks down the AMOS switcher code and disables it :)

The idea is if it can't find another amos task then it can't tell it to
switch to a wait mode :)
