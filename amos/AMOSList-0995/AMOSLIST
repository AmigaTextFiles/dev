I think this is a possible idea if a lot of people wanted to help. Only 
thing is people on this list have their own games, demos and projects 
which they are already doing, and may not be able to find the time even 
for a wee bit of extra programming. I don't know. Personally, I have 
quite a lot of time and would be interested - if there was some more support 
by others.

Can't agree more on the smoothness. I also tried Robert Curries program. 
It didn't flicker (I think) on my 1 meg 500, But it was the chunky effect 
I didn't like also.

If anyone has any code for a fast 8 or 4 way scroll that goes smoothly, I 
and I think the person who wrote this message above, would like to see it.

No doubt a lot of others.

You should make the channel for animation do a loop. So you should not
use an 'anim-for-ever'-style.
The loop for the animation could check an external AMAL-variabele and
this must be checked to see if the animation should be done.
The movement channel should set the external amal-var to a true or a
false depending on movement due or not.

Understand ?

I only have the coverdisk version of Pro and Easylife works wonderfully 
well with it.

Nevertheless, the quality of a lot of 'commercial' coverdisk software is 
often so way below par that I have a hard time believing it once was 
being sold for hundreds of guilders. A program like Pixel Pro, how did 
that ever manage to be sold?
There's a DTP program out there that would make great coverdisk material.

BTW, one of the reasons I bought Amos Creator was because there was 
nothing wrong with the coverdisk version.

Also, I have PPaint v.2.0 from the Amiga Plus magazine. Not so long ago a 
British mag gave away v.4.0. The difference? The latter can use RTG 
screenmodes. Does anybody know what is going on here? I mean, you do not 
up the version counter by two points if there is only one thing different 
from the previous version, do you?

I do not agree with you about animating bobs not making up 'real' 
animation. This is the method that professionial animators use, including 
Eric Schwartz. I do not know the name of the program Eric's using, but it 
also uses 'bobs' on a static background. You could call this interpreted 
animation, as the program only makes the animation just before it is 
viewed, while 'compiled' animations (IFF) contain the full animation.

Of course this is absolutely of no use in your case because Aladdin only 
outputs 'compiled' animation (as does most of the animation producing 
software).
For character animation the 'interpreted' method is very useful though, 
because you can make changes without having to render a whole scene again.

Damn. :-). You beat me to it. No, honest, if I had not been so busy the last 
two weeks I would have suggested it already. My plan was the following:

In a little less than a year there will be Olympic games. Those of you 
that owned 8-bit computers may remember the hugely succesful computer 
games based on the Olympics. Usually they involved some 8 sports in which 
you could compete against friends or the computer. These games were not 
very complex. If they contained any scrolling it was sideways and on the 
whole only a few sprites were moved and animated. Gameplay: wiggle the 
joystick. Despite their simplicity they apparently involved a lot of 
programming, animating and composing. I remember reading that large teams 
worked on them.

Of course, that was their strength. Lots of programmers and artists got 
assigned a relatively simple task that they could implement relatively 
indepently.

If, say, we could gather about 20 programmers, we could make the biggest 
Olympics based computer game ever!

The other reason why I had not proposed this yet (besides being busy) is 
that my account at work expires at the end of the year. I'll still be 
able to exchange email, but software will be a bit harder (yes, I know, 
it's the ninetees, but I can't help it either).

So I propose:
-That the subscribers of the Amos discussion list form a group with the 
purpose of having a computer game based on the 1996 Olympic Games of 
Atlanta ready at the 1st of May 1996.
-That this group consists of at least a coordinator, a graphics artist, a 
sound artist and several programmers.
-That the coordinator takes care of (or appoints a programmer to) 
programming the main program.
-That the graphics artist develops guidelines for the looks of the 
different modules.
-That the sound artist develops guidelines for the sound of the different 
modules.
-That the programmers have a vote in making guidelines for the feel 
(mostly the gameplay) of the modules.
-That the programmers develop the different modules.
-That the program contists of a main program that succesively calls the 
game and other modules (start and end ceremonies, commercials, price 
ceremonies, etc.)

I have been thinking a lot about this modular approach and it seems to be 
the easiest for the programmers: this way they only have to 'obey' the 
guidelines. This will eliminate a lot of the bugs expected from other 
approaches. With a modular approach I mean this: All the modules and the 
main program are separate, compiled Amos programs, only sharing one 
graphics bank and one sound/music bank (and of course using proprietary 
banks for each module).

Obviously this method has a few drawbacks. The first that springs to mind 
is that with twenty expected modules the whole programme may be over 2 
Meg! I do not think that at the moment this is a problem we should 
concern ourselves with. There are undoubtedly methods with which we can 
bring this back to a manageble amount.
Another problem is the communication between the modules. Although Amos 
can start (execute) other programs, I have found as yet no way of testing 
wether a program has ended or not. Also we need to find a safe way to 
transfer scoring data to and from the main program (and/or to and from a 
possible score keeping module).

Well, I'll wrap it up for now. Before you start commenting on my proposal 
I would like to hear if the people that want to develop a game as Eddie 
has proposed would like it to be this game. I feel that my game as I see 
it has got a lot of potential but is still relatively easy to produce. In 
the old days it was required that programmers came to work, but now with 
Internet and all that one can start projects like this.
People might feel that this program will have no edge over the countless 
other games that will undoubtedly be based on the next Olympics. If there 
are enough programmers though (like my estimated 20), the sheer size will 
be the thing we have going for us. Otherwise we can always come up with 
something later. Classic Olympics for instance, set in ancient Greece 
(the game might even be banned in some countries if we used the 
traditional sportswear :-) ).

I really must stop talking now, because I could go on and on and on... I 
am really interested to know what you all think about my (and Eddie's of 
course) plan.

Oh, one last thing and then I will really shut up :-): If my proposal is 
chosen as the 'joint game to be made' I will be happy to be coordinator 
for the next few months. I will have to let go at a certain point, though.

Oohh noo! I'm sorry about that!  I've got absolutely no idea why it 
doesn't work.  There is absolutely no reason why it shouldn't.  All 
it needs is the one icon file (the one you double click).  The only 
other external files it uses are SCROTAX.DATA and DEFAULT.DATA, but 
neither of these are necessary and the game will load without them.  
It doesn't even use fonts, so it doesn't need to look for anything 
like that.

Unless, of course, it has somehow been corrupted on upload, although 
I doubt this?  Has anyone else got it to work OK after downloading it 
from Aminet?

The system I used to write it (by the way) is an Amiga 1200, 
absolutely bog standard.  No other features (except hard drive).  
Only 2mb memory etc etc.  I don't know exactly what software failure 
means!?

I did try very hard to get Scrotax to work with no need for 
installing or any fiddling at all.  I thought it was just plain and 
simple, easy... but then again, I suppose nothing is.

If anyone else downloads Scrotax, please let me know if it works 
ASAP!  I'll be away on holiday for a week from Sunday, but I'm going to keep 
subscribed to the Amos mailing list anyway, so I should read all 
comments!

Again, very sorry you had trouble and thank you for trying for so 
long to get it to work!  I'll see what everyone else says and get 
back to you.

:-(

I also used this type of scroller... it's really fast, but it gets

drawing operations for the logical screen...

D0> I don't know exactly what an IFF animation is. Is that some format that

IFF animation are animations, which base on the
InterchangeFileFormat. These files contain a standard-ilbm picture in
the first frame and then only the different parts to the previous
image (DeLTA-frames).

On Amiga, the most popular formats are Anim5, Anim7_16, Anim7_32,
Anim8_16 and Anim8_32.

AMOS supports the Anim5-IFF format so some extend. However, multiple
palettes are not supported (why?).

D0> which wasn't so tedious actually; I just procedured everything up.

But these images are uncompressed ;-)

Not as fast as it could be ;-))

    It's a great idea, just think: one guy may be good at music, one can 
assemble a nice sound bank, one is good at graphics, one is a good coder,
instead of being on their own and do a demo of one thing put them together
and get a mega-game!!!!!!!!!!!!
     I'm interested, maybe we could all get a great game going.

It's not a bad idea.  However, the only problems I can see is that 
everyone has a certain way of going about things.  When I write a 
program I like to make it very "me" and do lots of personal silly 
bits that amuse and entertain me (if no one else).  If we all got 
together it would have to be quite organised and therefore not quite 
so much a "bunging together" of random ideas that eventually takes 
shape into something quite fun and unique (Like Scrotax 2 - available 
on Aminet NOW! (Zzzz..)) but more a standard format of contrasting 
personalities etc and weird things.

Also, it'll be an absolute bugger to assign who does what!  How will 
you decide?

However, being as negative as that, I don't think it's such a good 
idea.  Although, I personally am not sure I'd be able to offer all 
that much assistance, I'll still keep an eye out for developments on 
the mailing list if there are any, and perhaps try to contribute 
ideas?

Ok, I'd be interested in doinbg some graphics for a game of some sort. I 
don't mind drawing any kind of graphics really. I can also program, 
fairly competently. So if anybody wants to share what they can or want to 
do we may be able to get started soon. There is also someone else who was 
suggesting the same idea with a winter olympiad game. I think this could 
be a good start. So people share what you can do, and lets get this going 
somewhere.

See ya round

Regarding the screw up in your graphics, I have experience
similar problems when compressing data. I have been compressing
my graphical data and on one(only one) of my images, there is a
distortion. I was able to correct it by changing some of the
pixel values. Forsome reason the compression does not like
certain patterns of numbers.

Regarding the idea to create a shared game:

	I think it is a wonderful idea. I personally am very
strong in the graphics and coding area(although I do admit that I
don't know as much about the hardware/software workings as some
of you people do). Perhaps someone should make a list of what
individuals have what strengths and what sort of game we would
want to create.

Oh yes it does ;-)...
... or maybe, on the other hand, we have our wires crossed.

I assume you want a group of buttons where only one
can be selected at once - no more, no less.  If this is the 
case then the above code WILL work - if you click on the selected 
button, it will temporarily become deselected and then return to its 
selected state as soon as the mouse button is released.  (IMHO this 
temporary deselection of the button is important to let the user know 
that his click on the button has been registered).
[The "BR1" bit does this part]

However, if you want any number (except none) of the buttons
to be selected then it is more complicated, but by no means 
impossible:

If you begin with x buttons selected then set 0VA to the 
value x (do this when buttons are defined).
Then configure each button so that:
1. If a deselected button is clicked on then increase 0VA by 1 and
   select the button
2. If a selected button is clicked on, AND
if   a) 0VA is greater than 1 (it must be at least 1 because at least 
        this button is selected) then decrease 0VA by 1 and deselect 
        the button
else   b) (0VA equals 1) then do nothing - this must be the last 
button selected.

In fact, this method could be adapted so that at least y 
buttons remain selected (where y <= x).

The End.

Cheers,

Mark

I may be wrong, but it seems that the font commands for Easylife and 
AMCAF are completely useless when it comes to changing fonts within 
interface programs (because the font number has been replaced by a 
font pointer) and so I can't do the "SF0VA;" type of command.

Am I wrong? If not, can I get round it?

I like the idea of the Make Font Bank in AMCAF, since this gives the 
possibility of creating a completely stand alone executable not 
relying on any external files (except a mathtrans library) - this, 
IMHO is the neatest, most reliable way.

Ahh! Could this also be the case for compiled programs in Amos Pro?  
Do you get a SOFTWARE ERROR with it?  If so, then that could very 
well be the problem with Scrotax 2!

I suppose with something like that, there will always be various

different events?  Something like that isn't a bad idea, actually..

The only problem with an Olympics based computer game is... what

I thought if you PRUN a program from within AMOS (if PRUN is what you 
mean) it comes back to the original program only when the other has 
finished?  Mind you, not sure what happens there when everything is 
compiled?

As for transferring the score, you could either do it using COMMAND 
LINE$ (probably the best idea) or just create a temporary file in 
RAM containing all the variables needing to be passed.  The advantage 
with that method is that it would be very easy to add new ones onto 
the list etc.

I think this is a much better idea.  Specific olympics games have 
been done to death, I feel, but if we brought in original, less 
serious ideas for the game it could be both fun, original and 
entertaining.  That way we could also come up with our own personal 
ideas and it would be a good source for a variety of different senses 
of humour.  If you do something to rigidly (like conforming to an 
Olympics game) it can become a bit too characterless, I feel.

Also, it could then involve lots of other people in it.  For example, 
I'm not a great programmer, artist or musician, but I can 
occasionally come up with some original ideas (incidentally, did I 
mention Scro... oh, yes, I did, didn't I?)  People who don't want to 
have to work really hard at it could occasionally chip in tiny ideas, 
little quirks or strange hidden bits., so that the more you play the 
game, the more you discover.  I like games like that.

My opinion of it has changed a bit since my first thoughts.  It's not 
a bad idea!

Hey Mike, I mean BEN...
	Here's an idea that would work well in an overhead view game. I 
remember reading a review in Amigaworld about a game called Murder! in
which you played a detective in an enourmous mansion full of interresting
characters and clues. Of course, there's a murder and you have to 
interview
everyone, investigate all the clues, and solve it with proof.  The best
part about this idea is that you can randomize just about everything.  You
could even have the house or the environment randomly created for each
game.  I don't know if this is the sort of thing you were thinking of, but
I thought its something I'd like to see done in Amos.  But, if you don't 
do
it, i will. 
	Were you thinking of doing a sort of RPG-ish game? I think it would
be fun to take the Valhalla idea and move it into the future, too.
 
Well, Good luck with your plans!

How 'bout a few of the old games on the Atari 2600 converted over to the 
Amiga like: - Adventure
            - Haunted House
            - Demon Attack
            - Wizard of Wor

Re-live old memories :) The list could go on and on ... many of which 
can't be all that hard to be converted over.

	I am having a problem with sound compression. Currently I
am trying to create a routine that will load in any size sample
stored in my own format and play it in the background. To do
this, I am using the Squash/Unsquash routines as well as the
SLoad, Sam Swapped and Sam Swap commands. The format I am using
for my samples is:

Frequency(2),Load Length(2),Final Size(2), Sample Data,
	    ,Load Length(2)...

The routine would get the frequency of the sample, and then get
the load length and final size. I would then use the load length
to Sload the Sample Data into my first buffer of 5k. If the load
length is less than the final size then I would proceed to
unsquash it with OK=UnSquash(Start(bufferno),Load Length). I
would then play the sample data stored in bufferno as a raw
sample. I would then estimate the time of play for that segment
and use the Every x Proc command to start the multitasking
loop. In the loop the next segment would be loaded using the same
technique as above and when Sam Swapped(voice no) is true I then
us the Sam Swap command to switch buffers to the new one so that
the sound sample would continue playing on that buffer.

The problem I am having occurs when the Load Length and Final
Size are the same(Squash was unable to compress the data). When
it reaches one of these segments it plays some garbage data that
sounds like an out of tune vocal ladder. The segments that got
compressed work perfectly. What is happening?!?

Hi all

I've got the amos pd-cd and have noticed that a lot of the programs are in 
PAL mode.  I've tried to boot my machine into PAL but have had no luck.

I looked up the Proc "_to_ntsc" but I haven't been able to get it to work
either.

Can someone out there show me how to get the PAL programs to run in NTSC??

Thanks

Pam

	Make sure that the Amos_System directory is in the root
of your hard drive partition. Also make sure that all .Lib files
are in the Amos_System directory. To change to an NTSC
environment you must run the Config1_?.AMOS program and select
the NTSC mode from the menu. At least that's what I had to go
through to get my Amos Creator working. I have version 1.3x, the
U.S. version and so I am not sure wether 1.2 is compatable at all
with NTSC.

	Usually, unless the programmer put in code for NTSC,
there is no clear cut way to go about it. You should be able to
run the PAL programs but you won't be able to view about an inch
of the screen that a normal PAL monitor would display. This is no
concern unless there happens to be buttons or information that
(invariably) is put there. Some programs have commented out
portions of their source code that can be used by NTSC users. The
Sprite Editor is one example of that. For the Sprite Editor, you
simply have to remove the commenting symbol from one line and it
will work for NTSC. Many of the North American users of Amos have
difficulties with all of the PAL software that emerges and is
inoperable by us because the programmer has placed buttons or
information out of sight of the user. There are some programmers
that have compesated for this by creating screens that scroll up
and down when the mouse reaches the top or bottom edge of the
screen and this is acceptable. As far as your problem is
concerned, the only alternative you have is to change the source
code and hope that the author is good at internal documentation.

In reply to someones response to my 8-way scroller:

Do in part to the mail daemon falling on its face, I couldn't
quote the message so this is simply my reply.

	Yes, I myself could have done it many many years ago(no
offense taken) and in fact this I threw together in 30 minutes
from scratch. Personally though I have not ever timed my efforts
so I was not aware of the speed barrier in doing this routine. I
definitely see now the challenge of getting it under 1 vbl and
with bobs and sprites active at the same time thatt could be a
big challenge. But if you simply want an 8-way scroller, I think I
have given some good ideas to a few people who may not be as
advanced as you are. I fiddled about with scrollers for awhile
until I decided to do my game in 3D so I thought someone might
benefit from the effort at least.

Oh God, I have just discovered the problem and all I can say is I'm 
very sorry - it is entirely my fault!

I forgot (eek!) to include the amos library in the compiled code.  It 
tooks for your AMOS.LIBRARY, probably finds the old Amos library and 
then crashes in desperation as it doesn't know what to do!!

As I said before, I'm off on holiday now, but the moment I get back I 
will compile the current version 2.01 and upload it instead.  It's 
not much different, but it should work!!!!  (and it's got proper 
gravity)

If you would like me to email it to you uuencoded, then please ask - 
it'll save you having to go look for it on Aminet.

Again, very sorry about this!!

That was when loading... I know about /these/ problems... but I asked
for bugs in the /Save/ /Iff/ routine...

ji> Other programs showed these pictures OK.

I've written a program, which loads 256 colour iff pictures (single
pictures of an animation) and then converts them either to HAM6, 32
colours or 16 colours grey scale. But sometimes the source pictures
seem to be corrupt, and then I load them again and everythings ok?!

It's probably the IFF-Header of your samples that has not been cut

any of your sampling software.

I like the sample-editor of the Protracker 2.2 and from Protracker
3.15 very much... :-)

Due to the stupid bank structure there's no way to add a sample

That would be a *little* bit easier, I think ;-)

I can't remember if the problems with Ultimatum (1.2, I think) 
crashing at the end of the intro sequence were solved or not, but 
I have found the following "cures" it:

After you press any key at the start of the intro, send Amos to back 
with the Amiga "A" combination, then wait for the intro to finish. 
Then flip Amos to front and you will find yourself at the menu page - 
it didn't crash! I can't possibly think why this could be - has 
anyone had any similar spooky experiences?

Cheers,

Mark

Could that be the problem? Are allocating memory banks, that should
have been in Chip-Memory but are not definately asking for chip-mem
(so perhaps you get fastmem instead on other amigas?).

A software failure is the 'Multitasking-Guru' of the Amiga. If a
program goes wrong, it could call up some illegal assembly command or
use an invalid address. The AmigaOS exeception handler then 'traps'
this error and opens a requester that's called 'Software Failure'
(with english locale settings). There it shows the error number and
the task name. You may then suspend the error (the task will be
halted, but no system resources will be freed, and there's the risk
that the program has already overwritten important data of other
programs), or you can reboot the machine immediately.

The guru-number is a hex longword. It's uppermost bit 31 tells you if
it is a recoverable alert (bit set) or a deadend alert. Only
recoverable alerts are shown in software failure requesters, deadends
will reset immediately.

The uppermost byte holds the library number. If it's zero, it's a
processor trap. Common numbers are:

00000000 processor trap
01000000 exec.library
02000000 graphics.library
03000000 layers.library
04000000 intuition.library
05000000 math.library
06000000 clist.library (obsolete)
07000000 dos.library
08000000 ram.library
09000000 icon.library
0A000000 expansion.library
10000000 audio.device
11000000 console.device
12000000 gameport.device
13000000 keyboard.device
14000000 trackdisk.device
15000000 timer.device

Always remember to add '8' to the first digit if it's a recoverable
alert.

The last two bytes of the code contains the error code. Here are some
of the common error codes:

Processor trap codes:

00000002 bus error
00000003 address error (uneven address, occurs more often on MC68000)
00000004 illegal instruction
00000005 division by zero
00000006 'chk' instruction
00000007 'trapv' instruction
00000008 privilege violation (using supervisor-instructions in user-mode)
00000009 trace (may only be caused by debuggers)
0000000A line a emulation (FPU instruction)
0000000B line f emulation (MMU instruction)

exec.library

81000005 corrupted memory list
81000009 memory freed twice
8100000C sanity check on memlist failed
8100000F memory list insane

(I hope you and the others on the list don't mind my little excursion
;-) )

Which extensions do you use?

I have the CD also.  I have an A1200 and I make it boot into PAL and can
run the programs and boot off of the CD just fine.  What system do you
have?

Subject: Group Effort Game
Status: RO
X-Status: 

OK, since a few people are interested in programming a group effort game,
I'll offer something.
I started coding a lunar lander game (come on, stop groaning!). It uses a
lot of different techniques. Unfortunatly, I then decided to 3D render the
graphics for it. Designing, gererating, rendering, and learning to use a 3D
package has now taken over from the game. In fact I wrote the Anim2bob
converter to make converting the images easier - a huge program in it's
self.

As a result the Lunar Lander game has been put on the back burner. I'll put
out the code to what I've already done, so a group of us can work on it.

Let's start simple to see if a group effort approach will work.

Anyone interested?

How about coming up with the actual code for this? A few buttons and the

   I've tried this myself, but even with my 030 it's slow (or too jerky 
using large increments) for full-size, 16+ color screens.  Have to cut 
down the size and colors to make it look more 'professional.'  I thought 
of a 2 screen screen-offset/screen-copy method a while back that might 
just work to create a silky-smooth display (at the cost of more memory of 
course).  Not sure how easily it would work with objects on it.  I'll try 
it in the next week and if successful I'll upload an example.

I was up the other night trying to think of a way to do 8 way scrolling, 
when I got an idea. (NOTE: I haven't tried this yet) 

For 32x32 tiles -
What about getting a screen 320 x 256 with four strips on it

#####1######
#..........#
3..........2
#..........#
#..........#
#####4######

# = strips
. = viewable screen

Ok, now paste your tiles in the direction you are scrolling and then,

Just use the pd turbo ext's fast interrupt scrolling to scroll the 
required piece into view. (understand?)

If anybody has any comments on this I'd love to hear them,

In regards to Mike Crowl's idea, I've thought of this also, but I don't
think that the turbo extension can scroll up and down, only left and right,
which I think was very stupid on the programmer's part. Now I don't know about
the turbo plus extension but I think it still suffers from the same problem
since its demo on aminet only scrolls left and right(although very fast and
smooth). Now if I'm wrong someone please tell me so, I'd love to be, this
would solve all our problems it I was.

PS what extension number is the Amos pro version of TURBO, I've lost my instr.
and my disk crashed and I have to re-install it.

There's not one -I put a SampleBankEditor program for AMOS1.3
on aminet years ago which will let you do this - it won't let you 
alter the individual samples, but you can merge banks, insert &
rearrange samples and it loads IFF files correctly without the click.
If you want to edit the samples, OctaMed is on loads of coverdisks
and has an integrated sample editor that does all the basics.

P.s. The volume of traffic on this list seems to be on the up - maybe
its time to suggest the dreaded word "Newsgroup" again - There can't
be that many people out there who still have E-Mail only access can 
there - I mean even compurserve have WWW browsers now...

	If we are going to create a program by splitting it up
into little procedures there are a few things that must be taken
into account:

1) All procedures must leave the system in the same condition
as when they were initially called. For example you would have to
remember which screen was active and return activeness to that
screen before leaving your procedure. If this is not followed
then one person will be spending many many hours trying to figure
out how to mesh together a bunch of procedures that won't
cooperate--this will not be fun.

2) All procedures will have there own predefined variable or
storage space that only they can access. This will prevent others
from corrupting data. For example one procedure should handle all
sound effects and/or music and be responsible for maintaining the
data space as well as the assosciated variables. In essence it
should resemble object oriented programming except we will be the
only ones enforcing this restriction. Certain public variables
can be changed outside the procedure and these should be declared
as global, all others should be shared within the procedure.

3) An agreed upon documentation standard should be created and
upheld in case there are any small changes that need to be
made. This will also encompass the creation of a procedure list,
maybe daily, which will show the parameters of each completed
procedure--just in case slight changes must be made due to design
flaws or language shortcomings.

There are probably more but I can't think at this time. If we
follow the guidelines above then we should emerge with a slightly
robust game engine which may require more memory and be a slight bit
slower than a game designed by an individual but it should allow
us to create a larger game in a much shorter time span.

One thing that I have discovered(at least with Amos Creator) is
that mimicing object oriented programming in Amos makes the
program much smaller and less memory hungry. In order to fake
object oriented language, I use only one paramter in my call to
the procedure:

Procedure SOUND[REQUEST$]
Shared CURRENT_VOL,CURRENT_SAM,SOUND_ON
If REQUEST$="Load Sample"
------
------
End If
If REQUEST$="Play Sample"
------
------
End If
End Proc

This not only makes code very readable but it also solidifies
data because only one procedure accesses that data area. If data
must be passed into the procedure then a global variable is
used-- the equivalent of a public variable. Anyways, I sound like
I'm preaching now so I'll shut up and let everyone say what they
think. :)

You even don't need the mathtrans library if you're avoiding sin/cos/tan
etc. (the qsin, qcos, qsqr routines don't need the mathtrans libary
though). ;-)

Hello all,
    When I mailed up the message for the group game idea on Thursday, I did
not expect to get such a huge response!  I've just read my mail box (Monday
morning).  There were 100 messages in it!!!!!

    Right, I will sift through all the replies when I get some time and then
post the initial results to the list.

    It looks like this may actually happen.  If people could actually let
everyone know what their strengths and weaknesses are etc. we can start to
think about who can do what!  Also, original game designs would be helpful!

Cheers,

I haven't heard that particular one before, but I've been told that by 
pressing a key during the intro sequence (to skip the intro) sometimes 
cures the problem.

I dl'ed two of the three recent source archives: Dennis' Morbith and 
Ben's Proclectius (or what was it again }-) ?). I have not actually 
studied the source, just looked at what the progs did. Dennis, try and 
include a bit more documentation for those who do not know who Andre van 
Duin and Jacques d'Ancona are. Some nice idead but the gameplay is not 
that special (maybe I don't know what I should do, so include more 
documentation).
Ben's stuff looks very useful and if you do not mind I might want to use 
some of it in the future.

If either of you want more a detailed reply, let me know.

Others mentioned using procedures too, and in that case it would indeed 
be wiser to use only five or so programmers. That is why I suggest that 
the programmers all deliver complete stand-alone products. This way the 
only thing they have to know is the format of the scoring and player data 
(i.e. Name, country, etc.). Of course there also needs to be a shared 
look and feel, but implementation of it will not cause any bugs (I hope).

The control program can probably be written in another program, as it 
does not need any fancy graphics or so.

I had a look a the 'procedure library' (suggested by Paul Hickman :-)
and it contains a procedure to set a font by first loading it via
the 'intuition-fonts-commands-stuff' and then doing a 'Get Rom Fonts'
This should work with amcaf and Easylife too. I think.
So you set the font. And do a get rom fonts and scan though the font-list
for the name of the font. Try it.

Yes, this also (always) cures the problem for me aswell.

A better technique of mimicing object orientation is to have seperate
procedures and call them OBJECTNAME_PROCEDURE name,
and then make the first argument of each always be the 'this' 
pointer. (Or pseudo pointer anyway). Then you don't have the
string processing overhead, but do have an object!

Yes, but this really defeats the object of using the El...Font 
commands, since they are intended to remove the need to search 
through the fonts to open a specific font.  What I would have liked 
to have seen is a Elopen Font command which gives a value that can be 
used within interface programs instead of a "font pointer".  As 
things stand at the moment, I am better off using the old system 
which is a bit shite.

Hi,
I would need to "link" to games together. The other one
is written in AMOS and the "subgame" in Blitz. Because
I don't really have much time to concentrate in this
nowadays & I hate "pointless" work, I though that instead
of translating the Amos code to blitz, I could maybe
launch the subgame (robot battle) from Amos part.
Amos part should wait until the Blitz part has finished
and then continue. 

Has anyone been doing something like this ? If so, could
you please send me the example of that (I'm not subscribed to
the amos-list currently) ?

OK,
    So far about 10 people have expressed a definite interest in producing a
group game.  Now comes the difficult part of having to wade through everyones
ideas.  To help, it would be handy to recieve all the information in a
standard form - 'cos plowing through huge mail messages is not my idea of
fun!!

    I think the best way to tackle this is to first of all see what everyone
can do, the amount of time they can spare and then any ideas.  Try and keep
this as concise as possible.  My mail manager is probably having a cow as it
is!!! :-))))
    My own personal abilities are included - please comment out :-)

1: Coding - What specialities do you have / what do you like doing!?
    [My best side - I'm q-good with most aspects inc. data storage + maths
stuff, as long as its not too heavy! :-))) ]

2: Graphics - Are you any good?  Pics, bobs, icons etc.
    [No good at all :-( Working graphics at best]

3: Sound - Can you create good effects, music etc.
    [Good muscian in real life - inexperienced with trackers on the whole tho]

4: Ideas - What game shall we produce? (It may be an idea to try a simpler one
           to start with!!)
    [Perhaps a conversion of an old 8-bit game to start with! {Chaos :-)))} ]

5: Time - Do you have any spare?
    [I have some spare but not a Great deal!]

6: Any other comments!
    [Lets just see how this goes to start with :-) ]

    The best way to tackle a large problem like this is to design the whole
thing modular.  Most people agree with this.  It would be wise to have a good
discussion on which game idea to go with and how to implement it before any
work is done.  A story line should be thought up as well to help the more
artistic members of the team to get a 'feel' for the idea!!!

OK - lets have those ideas coming in.......

It seems that it never will be - there wasn't anything about it in the

	Someone asked for ideas for games. I would like to see if
it is possible to create a fantasy doom-like adventure. Instead
of guns and ammo, the players would use swords and sorcery. We
could include a multiple player modem or network mode. The engine
for the display would probably have to be written in c or
assembler and called from within amos and we might have to make
certain restrictions for it so that the game does not bog down
but overall I think it is certainly possible.

	What does everyone else think?

There are quite a few sports games available... there would have to be
something different about it, like what you've described below. Do we
*have* to have the wobbling of the joystick from left to right!?!!?

I prefer the Winter Olympics games though, because of the stupid stunts
that can be done on the ramp events. ;-)

How about Space/Future Olympics? Then there could be loads of new events
eg. Ski-ing with jets, tobbogganing going down a black hole, etc.

Methinks you want to redo Heretic. 8^)  And almost all of the
game functions would have to be in C.  My A500 has enough
trouble doing 3D line grafx, let alone texture-mapped
grafx, which are about three times slower!

Of course, I've never used C or ASM, so I wouldn't know
how fast it could possibly get.  But it would seem
that AMOS wouldn't even be needed because the engine
would be the core of the program.  It sounds like
a neat idea, if you could get it fast enough.  Need someone
to draw the blood? 8^)

I like the idea of a common effort based on the upcoming Olympics in
Fernando's state. (Save us a room in your home for then Fernando! ;) )

Outside of the facts that any number of things could go wrong, no money
is likely ever to be made, and a coherent program has about a 30% chance
of emerging, I give the amos-list project a thumbs-up and am happy to offer
my services as a strictly amateur coder.

I would like to do a cross-country runner event. I envision a animated
bob of a runner in the center of the screen with trees and stuff coming
at the screen. Dunno if this would correspond to an olympics event though.

I think M. Lionet has messed it up again. Probably the same decrunching
will require an at least four bytes smaller data packed to decrunch... I
could be wrong of course, but it wouldn't be surprising, if this is the
fault... so don't use the compressed data on that file, even if it has
showed that it would compress to the same size. Moreover, to increase the
crunching efficiency, I would use 8-delta encoding. AMCAF provides
commands to do such an encoding :)

Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone could help me with this piece of code.
Its still in rough form, but the idea is there, what I need is a scrolling
screen, as you'll see from the program, you first grab the screen with
the mouse, and while holding the mouse button, then when you let go the
screen will scroll or spin, like I want it too. I have figured out the speed
of the screen(in pixels per second) when you let go of the button, but
have a real problem trying to figure out the delay for the scroll after you
let go. I've figured out that the speed and delay are a curve when graphed
and I have not a clue how to program this.
  One thing, make the modification shown below to get the speed at certain
delays, this is how I made the graph, it helped me a bit, but made the job
even harder since I figured that the speed to delay ratio would be a straight
line, but instead its a curve sort of like to top right part of a hyperbola.
If only I could get the formula for a curve from its graph, then this would
all be so simple.

So can anyone help me with this, this is for a game I'm making, its sort
of a wheel of fortune type game, I'd gladly give you credit in the game.
I'm also trying to make realistic deceleration of the screen as well, which
has also gave me some grief as well.

Feel free to modify the code at will, and make any suggestions that would be
helpful. YOu'd also have to sincere gratitude.

	Actually I finally got it to work. It seems that when the
Squash routine fails to compress data, it does not clean itself
up. The data that was unsuccessfully squashed is garbled. I
corrected for this in my conversion program by first making a
duplicate of the data and then attempting to squash it. The
routine now plays samples of any size up to a frequency of 15000
off of a harddrive with the sample segments being compressed. The
total memory usage is 10K. In total I can only get about 25%
compression which is not bad for large samples but pitiful for
smaller ones. What is delta-8 compression? Does AMCAF work on
Creator? I have theorized that for sound data, because of it's
sinusoidal nature, you might be able to get away with only
storing the differences between each sample byte. The difference
should be far smaller than the entire sample range -128 to 127
and might be representable by only 3 or 4 bits which could
theoretically save you 50%-62%. Has anyone thought of this or am
I totally off base? I am assuming that each sample is represented
by a single byte which seems to correspond with the play time for
each sample.

Giday Chris,

I today programmed this with a 224 x 224 screen and it worked with the 
AMOS scroll command. 
<- 160->    ^
 #####------| 32 
#     #     V
#     #
#     #
#     #
#     #
 #####

Thanks to all who replied about this. But I've finally got it scrolling 
without a jerk or a flicker. And it can go reasonably fast too.

And it has an animating bob on the screen too.

Seeya later

To the person with the accelleration problem:

	It seems that the solution is related to a simple physics
equation(or dynamics for those engineers). What you need is the
distance equation for an object experiencing deceleration.

	d=d`+v`*t+0.5*a`*t^2

Where d` is your initial position-- the position of release of
the wheel. v` is the initial velocity-- the pixel velocity that
you calculated. a' is some deceleration value which reflects the
friction of the ticker on the side of the wheel and the effects
of gravity(and of course air friction). t is the time in
second(or 50'ths of a second if that's what your velocity is
in). So to determine what the wheel looks at any one time, all
you have to know is which number was grabbed. Calulate the
distance that that number has traveled in the current
time. mod that value with the circumferance of the wheel to
obtain your offset and then draw the wheel accordingly. You
should do this in a repeating loop that exits as soon as the
velocity drops below a certain amount. Velocity is calulated as
follows:

	v=v`+a`*t 

which uses the same values as above. You will have to figure out
the deceleration value for yourself. Just choose a value that
seems to work correctly--there are too many variables for me to
make an accurate guess.

The reason this works is becuase you are dealing with the
tangential acceleration of a rotating object. The plot of your
curve probably closely resembles the deceleration curve.

I'd prefer a command /number/ instead of a string. This would make the

The other suggestions are quite sensible, though ;-)

It should work and it is a known way of compressing sound (provided that 
there is not too much noise in it, like drum samples). I wouldn't know 
how to implement it though.

What AF have you been reading then?
In my copy, there is a short piece explaining why Brilliance wasn`t
on the coverdisk (something to do with Digital Creations or whatever
they`re called now not coming up with the coverdisk version _yet_).

As to Real3D, remember what happened last time AF said they were
putting it on a coverdisk......yes, that`s right folks, we got 
Imagine2 instead (and I for one was delighted with that change).
Maybe next month we`ll get something even jucier, or maybe AF
_really_ do have Real3D for us.  We shall see.

Chris

Sound good ....but could we use AMOS 3d??? (have it but never use)
How fast is it....at least with drawing flat planes with a surface on 
it....(maybe you see where my ideas are headed)
We could create walls as flat planes and use an Iff screen as the map 
for them...
I have a random maze generator (code will follow)...
Anyone familiar enough with AMOS 3d to shoot my idea down?  :)

Later,
Joe

This code draws a maze on an IFF screen.
The size of the maze can change by variables MX and MY

This code was converted from an old C=64 routine I found in an old book

And it looks like a convincing demo too (and short). It works well on my 
A1200 with Fast Ram. Only scrolling to the right is a bit jerky (well, 
maybe I am hallucinating).

The only niggle I have is that you send such a large archive through 
email. Some of us have limits to what they can receive. I believe the FAQ 
mentions the maximum size an included prog should be.

There was another demo called HotAir.amos. However, Amos is talking about 
an I/O error upon trying to load it and AmosPro gives a similar error. 
Could the author send it to me again, PRIVATELY? Many thanx in advance.

Please count me in too!
I'm very much interested, I'll postpone my current project in favour of this.
I'm available as:
 * coder
 * co-projectmanager
 * gameplay designer (mechanics & algorithms and basic plot)

What you can't expect me to do:
 * compose music
 * animations and other gfx
 
I opt for a simple game, which can easily be enhanced with more levels/features.
As mentioned earlier by someone else, an old 8bit game could be a perfect
choice. (I personally loooooove the concepts of wizball and popeye (popeye eats
spinach and brutus starts running around like a crazy fool.)

First we could start with flick-screen method, and maybe we can add scrolling
later. I would like to point out that there exists an Amos game which
_presumably_  (I read it in AF) does a decent 8-way tile scroll. I haven't seen
it yet but it's called Hi(gh) Octane and is on Aminet games/shoot/

I really liked the Olympics idea as a group effort. The different events
make it modular. The upcoming Olympics make it topical. The variety makes
it interesting.

 A Doom style game is probably not technically possible and as a group
                   effort would collapse of its own weight. (My two cents)
 Popeye has been done before (and quite well) by Bignonia. It's even free.
 Wizard of Wor, actually, I have a prototype version of this which I will
                   upload as soon as my amiga is back on line

I logged on to an Amiga BBS via telnet yesterday and was amazed to have
ANSI graphics pop up via my internet line. If anybody else has TELNET (and
I imagine everyone does) try TELNET RAGTIME.COM .

   Well, I'd like to help out if I can.  I really don't know how much time I 
can give, but I do want to be part of whatever we do...

1) Coding:  I'd say I'm pretty good with most aspects.  I'm best with 
            BASIC and C, but only have BASIC (AMOS) for my Amiga.

2) Graphics:  I certainly hope I'm good here! =)  I'm best at 3D and 
              other pre-rendered FX, not as strong with real-time FX.

3) Sound:  Used to play keyboard, only minor experience with trackers 
           though.

4) Ideas:  I was never a big fan of those Olympic computer games (sorry).  
           I'm not sure a 3D texture-mapped game would be possible in 
           AMOS.  An unpractical amount would probably have to be written 
           in another language.  I'm sure something like Space Hulk would 
           be possible though.  I'd like to try something as original as 
           possible, but of course I have no other ideas right now. :}

5) Time:  Not a lot, I'm working on my portfolio for work right now, but I 
          should be able to do a little work at least.

6) Comments:  I agree, maybe we should try an easier project first, see how 
              things work, and then come up with ideas for a mind-blowing, 
              ground-breaking, Earth-shattering... well you get the idea.


*** Two new bits of info that are probably important ***

7) System info:  Amiga 2000, 030/882, 8Mb Fast/1Mb Chip, 185Mb HD, OS 2.1

8) Software: AMOS:  AMOSPro 1.12, AMOS the Creator 1.3 / AMOS Compiler
            Paint:  Deluxe Paint 4.0, Digipaint 3.0
          Imaging:  ADPro 2.0, HamLabPlus (demo)
               3D:  Imagine 3.0, Forge, VistaPro 3.0
            Audio:  OctaMED 4.0

   I do like the idea of making a fantasy game(group game) because I love
this kind of games.  I actually have the original code of the old 
'adventure'game so it will be easy to port it, but I finally decided on 
making my own rpg, just found out that it will take me forever to do it 
though because I need a new graphic for each room and so it is a lot of work.
  I can draw but my graphics are not something extraordinaire, still I can
prob manage to make my own standalone procedure with gra[phics and code.
  I will be uploading to aminet soon 3 demo games I made just to learn 
amos, since I started working in it recently.
  I downloaded "colpectius', I really liked the plasma code (be nice if 
the screen copies itself to fill up all and then autochange) and the 
explosion.

   I found the code of 'adventure' in an old magazine at the library :), 
it shouldn't be hard to convert it to amos.

	I just realized that I don't (supposedly) have the most
up to date version of Easylife for AMOS Creator. In the
documentation for 1.10 AMOS Pro Version it states that there was
at least a version 1.3x of Easylife for AMOS Creator. Not only
can I not find that on Aminet but I can't find the one I got
either(1.0). Does anyone know where I might get this version(1.3x)? My
version doesn't say anything about registering so I don't think
it's a registered users only thing. Supposedly Aminet has every
file ever created for the Amiga in it's archives. How do you
access these? If anyone knows anything, let me know.

	Also I've been fiddling with the 1.12 Amos Pro program
recently( I don't use it because I can't compile). It states in
the help file that you can use the AMOS Creator 1.3x compiler
with Amos Pro if you have the AMOSPro_Compiler.Lib which is
supposed to be on the productivity disk... which they did not
include. If I was able to get this library, would I be able to
use the commands from the extensions of AmosPro in my program and
then compile(and have it work)? If this is possible, where could
I get the AMOSPro_Compiler.Lib or is it still copyrighted even
though they aren't developing or managing their product?

I have a full net account at work (anything other than work related
business is frowned upon) and my own personal account(this one) which is
email only.
Whilst I'm not up on how to start a newsgroup, isn't is possible to link
this mail list to a group and visa versa. That way people (like me ;-)  )
can still participate, and the wider audience of a newsgroup can also be
involved.

Thanks to all who downloaded Colpectius1... there is/will be a new version
soon, with bugs fixed, things which people have hinted at and er... some
other stuff.

The new version is called "Colpectius1.lha", same as before. The new
archive should (?) wipe over the original. So, how will you know when
this is done? The new size is 26,428 bytes and the SHORT message is
different. That should make it identifable. :-)

If anyone wants this, who doesn't have Aminet access, tell me and I'll
UUEncode it to you. :)

Firstly, not all aminet mirrors carry all the files. 
wustl.wuarchive.edu & src.doc.ic.ac.uk are complete along with two
or three others. Secondly when a later version of a program they
already have is uploaded, they usually delete the earlier version, so
when I uploaded the AMOSPro versions, the old ones probably got
removed. 

Andy may have an old version on his WWW site - If not, I can upload
one (not to aminet - don't want them removing the AMOSPro version)
in a few weeks when I get back home. I think 1.44 was the last
released AMOS Creator version.

Not with a standard usenet comp.sys.... newsgroup (As far as I know)
however, you can now create psuedo newsgroups when run on a
WWW server using cgi scripts where this is probably possible.

In fact it would probably work best the other way around - create an
new E-Mail account on a UNIX machine, and  subscribe it to the list,
then have the WWW cgi-script parse its .mail file and display it as
a threaded subject listing.

Then anyone can read the mailing list without subscribing, and
the WWW site can contain a form for sending mail to the list. This
would also allow us to perform the rather neat trick netscape does
for news and make any URL in the mail messages into a 
hypertext link.

I would try seting this up myself except I don't have a machine which
I can create E-Mail accounts on, and that has a WWW server where
I can create cgi scripts. If anyone out there is master of their own 
machine or in a position to get this sort of thing setup, I'd be more
than willing to write the cgi program.

P.s. Please E-Mail me as ph@doc.ic.ac.uk  - I'm leaving eurotherm soon.

Hi all,

I just decided not to use 1.3 anymore.
Now I am faced with a problem regarding the OM program.
I alsways used it under 1.3 and it worked ok.
Now -you guessed it- nothing goes.
I tried the hints stated in the manual regarding the settingsfile
in the om-directory to make OM 68000/68020 useable. Didn't work.
Is there anyone willing to uuencode me a copy of their working 
(under 2.0) OM-program ?

I would be much obliged.

I am willing to help out if i can with this gropu project idea, I think 
all the people willing to support it should fill out a similar form as 
below. The extensions and versions of amos is one of the most critical 
aspects of this project.

1) Coding: Not bad in most areas, programmed in C,Pascal,AmigaE and 
of course Amos

2) Graphics: Okay with stills and small things, but terrible at animations.

3) Sound: Gastly, keep me away from musical instruments!

4) Ideas: Something simple to start with, if people are desperate for 
this doom type thing, why not do it in Robocop3 fasion without all the fancy
texture mapping. That way it may be possible to have it full screen and 
without huge ugly pixels like gloom or ab3d. Plus it could run ok on less 
powerfull computers!

5) Time: I could probibably manager 4 hours a week fairly easily.

6) Comments: Like i said above, something small to start with.

7) System info: A1200 2mb chip, 40mb HD. The Bog standard 1200
		Pentium 60 pc (used for graphics don't flame me!)

8) Amos Info: AmosPro2.0 + Compiler / Extensions : Amcaf,Easylife

9) Software: Graphics: Brilliance (amiga) Corel 5, FD Painter (pc)
	     Sound: Octamed 5

	I checked on Andy's site and all he has is your AMOS Pro
version. You can simply mail it to me if that is simpler. I will
be moving to my new account this week so if you want to do this
then I will send you my new address as soon as I find out what it
is. Thanx,

Status: RO
X-Status: 

There's a very annoying bug that seems to randomly surface every now 
and then with the amospro interface language:

It happens when I use a command like "Vdialog$(1,10)=NAME$" from 
within the Basic program and then try to print 10VA from within the 
interface program. Very occasionally instead of NAME$ being printed, 
I just get a long line of "junk" characters. On closer inspection I 
found that the contents of Vdialog$(1,10) contained these "junk" 
characters directly after the "Vdialog$(1,10)=..." Basic command. 
Therefore, the problem lies with this command and not specifically 
the interface language. The only way I can get round this problem is 
by doing something like...

Repeat
   Vdialog$(1,10)=NAME$
Until Vdialog$(1,10)=NAME$

...which is far from ideal.
I often find that using this method means that all the other 
Vdialog$(1,?)=... commands carried out afterwards for that channel 
work perfectly (there is no need to do it for every string - phew!).

I would like to hear if anyone alse has had this problem and maybe 
found a neater way to get round it.

Cheers,

Mark

I found (somewhere, aminet?) a game already written in amos (with source!)
that is basically a doom type game. It uses bobs for textures. Works Ok. If
interested I will dig it up and give you the name of it. Don't ask for it
to be uuencoded-it's too big!

Can some one get a modem to modem game working with amos. I'd like to get
something like that working.

 Still working on Anim2bob. It's list of features is growing.

Now, the question:

1. Has anyone written a point and click type hotspot setter code?

2. Has anyone written any code that moves the hotspot of bobs?

3. When we grab a bob, how does the 16 bit boundary affect it. Does it grab
it in 16 bit increments from the first x co-ordinate, or does it find the
closest 16 bit spot and use it?

No. Let's stick to the current method - it works and that's all that

	You can replace Sload with the command

SOUND$=Input$(Port#,5000)   'places 5000 characters of
			    'the sound file into string
			    'SOUND$

Copy Varptr(SOUND$),Varptr(SOUND$)+5000 To Start(CUR_BANK)
			    'Copies the data from the string 
			    'into the sound bank

	I'm not sure of the speed of this though because Input$
along with Copy might be slower than a simple Sload. These two
commands can be made into one line if you have the Easylife
extension. 

Mem Input$(Port#,5000),Start(CUR_BANK)

I'm all for this group project...Here's my strong and weak points...

1) Coding: Good in AMOS and ummmm thats about it... 

2) Graphics: Excellent in 2d backgounds, multi-frame animation( the 
more the better of course ) and character design.

3) Sound: Music?!?! You can make music on an Amiga?!?!?!  ;)

4) Ideas: I would like to see some sort of Graphic Adventure game 
engine...like Lucas Arts games...i.e. Maniac Mansion....or maybe a good 
Sidewinder type game (with lots of secret stuff ie 
bonuses,bosses,levels ect.) must have kickin' music like Sidewinder 
(since this project will be PD maybe we could sample some Offspring, 
Stone Temple Pilot or something else)

5) Time: 6 hrs a week...(that would be some paycheck :D ) could give 
more if I really get into it...

6) Comments: 

7) System info: A1200 2mb chip, 40mb HD, Squirrel SCSI interface w/

	Yes, I think I saw that. I believe that it is a little
bit memory hungry and limited for what I had proposed. Besides I
think I was ruled out on that one and we are going ahead with an
Olympics type of game.

ditto, please send me a copy of your lunar lander game code.

I think Darryl makes a good point in keeping it simple for a first project.
Has anybody been keeping a list of interested people?
Lunar lander sounds like a good candidate. We need a project in which many people could
get involved. In this case different people could be involved in different levels of the game.

With an Olympics game different people can get involved with different events.

I have another idea for a theme:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 We could do something along similar lines to the kid's educational Noddy series. 
This was actually written in AMOS (or at least in part) and looks and plays well.
My two young children love it.

It has an initial screen where you can select any of the sub-games or you can drive Noddy
around in his car to a specific part of Noddy-town and then play the sub-game. One of the
sub-"games" is a painting and drawing program for example, where you can paste pictures of
the characters on the screen, or load a background picture and fill it in with different
colours and patterns.

  Anyway, Noddy is similar in design to the Olympics game, is colourful, has reasonable
sound effects and runs in 1 Meg, plus there is an untapped market for educational games.
Each module appears to be an executable and the controlling program is written in AMOS and 
the source for the controlling program is viewable. 

Our aim though is to have fun and enjoy doing something as a group. 

Somebody mentioned a marathon event in the Olympics game. We could use the marathon man/woman
to move around the Olympic village to choose an event or just have the ability to choose an
event by point and click and then the marathon man runs to that event.
(just like the Noddy game (except Noddy drives his car)).

My 5 cents worth (2 cents isn't legal tender anymore in Australia)

 At the moment I don't have the time to join the group thing but it
could be real great. As for what the group should do why dont all of you
each come up with a unique idea for a game and then vote on it. That is
of course after someone starts controling the group and people really
sign up and commit themselfs to it.
 After what I have seen on this list and Aminet I think the Amos Group
could do what Vulcan did. Who's Vulcan?, you ask. Have any of you seen
Valhala, Valahala II or Time Keepers? All three of these COMERCIAL games
was writen by a small group of AMOS coders. If you dont belive it run
the disk thru ViruZII v1.16 or higher... AmosBank File... AmosSample...
and on ect... Well if they can do it so could this group. Thier main
draw was the game was simple AND if you look at them easy to do in Amos.
But the big thing was they were ORIGINAL ideas. Who knows? The members
of the group might even become Published Commercial Authors if it can do
what those seven or eight people did.

You have to upload to /pub/aminet/new, but only a few aminet
sites permit uploads (wuarchive.wustl.edu is one). You specify
the directory where the file will go in the readme file header -
something like:

Short: My Program Decsription
Type: dev/amos

Look a README_BEFORE_UPLOAD in the aminet root directory
for full information.

Firstly, Netscape would not be required - any browser that supports
forms e.g. Amiga Mosaic 2.0 will be OK. My comment on netscape
was that if you read news in it, it turns any URL's into links. For 
this system, the URL's would be turned into links at the server so
would appear that way on any browser.

Secondly, this proposal won't affect the current mailing list - it 
would still operate as it does now. The WWW system will provide a
method for reading all the messages on the list without subscribing
to it, and for posting messages from a WWW form.

It is also possible to setup a login system to the site that goes 
like this:

 - On your first visit, you fill in a form giving you name, E-Mail 
   address and mail signature, you are then returned a private URL
   for the actual list which contains a pointer to the information 
   you just entered.

 - You add this URL to your hotlist, and on subsequent visits you  
   get straight to the actual list without having to re-enter the 
   user information.

 - When you go to the form to post the message, it can automatically
   insert your name, reply-to E-Mail address and signature into the
   message.

See the Electronic Telegraph (An on-line version of a UK newspaper)
for an example of this technique:  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/

Hello all,
    Here is the list of names interested in a group project.  If I have missed
someone off, I appologise.  This is only a list of names, I haven't had any
time to compile a list of everyones ideas as well.  Sorry - I've got a mad
rush on at the moment :-(((

Any way, heres the list:-
Branco Collin
Ben Wyatt
Chris Hodges
Darryl Lewis
Daniel (DM9200@conrad.appstate.edu)
Fernando Bartra
Joe Bedard
Garrett Moon
Ben Crowl
Jan Lubbers
Max Monohan
Dimitris Panagopoulos
Paul Hickman
Robbert Currie
Semprini
Tim Wright
Tim Gunn
John C. Bintz
& myself Tim Lewis

    I hope I've spelled all you're names correctly!!  Everyone in the above
list, has expressed an opinion on the original idea.
    The main consensus of opinion seems to be for an Olympics based game.  I
think this is a good idea as everyone knows what the Olympics are about etc.
It's also a good reflection as the Olympics are about global co-operation and
friendship, and this group we have here is about as global as it gets -
fitting huh!

Any way, enough of this idle banter.  I will post more details as and when I
get time to do so....  Keep the ideas coming in!

That is Branko with a 'k'. Sorry if I seem a little nitpicky about this, 
but sometimes it seems that the whole world has decided to spell my name 
wrong :-).

Erm... I think it would be wise to present all the ideas you have 
collected so far and let us discuss about it. Although as the proposer of 
an Olympics type game I would very much like to see my idea be chosen for 
the project, it would not be fair to chose it without discussion and 
voting. I was fairly vocal about my idea, mostly because I had thought of 
making it a shared project before, and thus people might not have looked
at other ideas and agreed with me directly. Also, I was one of the few to 
post my idea to the list instead of privately to you.

So, my suggestion is that those who came up with an idea for a game send 
a ten line (70 chars wide for easy commenting) description (propaganda or 
as objective as possible :-) ) to Eddie <T.Lewis@bton.ac.uk> and that 
after a while Eddie sends a complete list of suggestions to the mailing 
list. We can then all comment on and add to the ideas. The ideas will be 
'recompiled' and the voted on.

Any comments so far?

I was thinking: Shouldn't we take this to a separate list? Or maybe the 
describers that don't join the group project do not mind the discussion 
here?

Yes, very much so. I have always toyed with doing a doom-like game in 
Amos just to scare the pants of the R3aL k3Wl dooDZ who say it just 
cannot be done on an Amiga. Anyone remember a game called Narco Police?

Glad you liked it!

One thing I forget to mention:  Vdialog(1,0) always holds the current number 
of buttons selected, so there is no longer any need to search througn 
all the buttons to work this out.

That's okay then ;-). It's a good idea and it gets my approval. :-)

      I like the idea of the Olympics game (for group) because then each 
one of us can work on one event and make his code a procedure of the main 
program, then all send their event/procedure and manager finishes up the 
game :)

  Coding:  Basic, Dbase 3, and Amos now.
  Sound:  got a sound digitizer if you want some speech in the game.  Maybe
          I can get my brother to do a song in Med, he makes beautiful songs.

We'll it looks like a number of people are interested in a group effort.
So far there have been 3 suggestions for the sort of game.
1- Olympics
2- AMOS DOOM
3- Lunar Lander

I think we should start off small, just to see if it is possible to do
something with it. That's why I'm in favor of Lunar Lander.
I suggest that we break off into groups to pursue the idea that most
appeals to you. Why be stuck coding something you don't like (jeez, I get
enough of that at work). If people want to change groups, then that's OK,
no restrictions, just work on the bits of code you want to.

I'll co-ordinate anyone who wants to help code Lunar Lander. I hope it will
eventually be an entire game from take off from earth to the moon and
return. (OK, so I've seen Apollo 13 a few times).
If anyone is interested, (one person has already shown interest) email me.

Actually, this is directed to everyone.

I'd like to upload a new AMOS game to AmiNet. The file is over 600K. 
Anyone here have some explicit directions on properly sending the file to 
the site? I access the Internet via FreeNet and it will be my first 
attempt at uploading.

Thanks for any help.

Well, here's my pros'n'cons list.  Enjoy!

1)  Coding:  Been doing it since I was 9, and I love to
work on AMOS.  Haven't learned C yet, but I'll soon start learning
for the IBM (sheesh!).

2) Grafx: Love to draw, mostly cartoonie stuff, but I'm handy with
a ray tracer, too.  Got a piece'o'crap program, though.

3) Music: Can play the guitar farily well, but never touched a Tracker in 
my life.

4) Time: Still in high-school and I run after school, so weekends and 
winter-spring are my most open times.

5) Ideas: Got a faboo idea now.  Remember Hacker?  Let's try throwing it 
into the 21st century, with live (fake) Internet connections and WWW 
(fake) access and BBS (fake).   An Intuition game like this would be great.

6) Comments:  I start a project and have only followed through once.  A 
little help would be great.

7) Sys Info:  Amiga 500, 2 floppy drives, 1 meg

8) AMOS Info: Amos Creator 1.36, AmosPro Compiler 2.0, Intuition 
Extension 1.3a, Turbo 1.9, LDos & LSerial (both unregistered)

9) Software:  AMOS (duh!)
              DP:TAS
              3D Master (a raytracer)

Hope you enjoyed it.  Thanx!

IMHO I think this would be a good idea, especially when you 
consider many design ideas are going to be put forward and votes are 
going to be made - none of which have anything whatsoever to do with 
Amos.

I'm all in favour of using this group to help with any Amos related 
problems that the "joined game" will encounter but 90% of messages 
about this game so far have had no relation to Amos at all :-(

Sorry if I sound like an old fart, but this needs to be said.

  I like this group project idea.  Unfortunately, I don't have any time
available that I'd be able to devote to it - I'm already involved in
several projects of my own - so I can't really help out.  But for the
curious:

1) Coding: Since I was 5; standard BASIC, AMOS, Fortran (sort of), Lisp,
           Pascal, C/C++, assembly (680x0, 6502, 65816, 80x86).

2) Graphics: Well, I can draw tiles, but I wouldn't suggest actually using
             them. :)

3) Music: Like #2.

4) Time: Zero. (see top)

5) Ideas: None, sorry.

6) Comments: That Olympic thing sounded like it could work, but it may be a
             bit ambitious.  I think that with the Lunar Lander type game,
             though, a lot of people would end up being bored.

7) Sys info: Amiga 2000, 030/25, 5.5MB RAM (don't ask), 1.5GB HD, Ethernet
             card

8) AMOS info: Creator 1.3, Pro/Compiler 2.0

  This would be the DOS Examine() call, and this:

>OS=Object Size :Rem Whats this in standard Amos

would get the size of the file.  Instead of those two lines, you can use:
Open In 1,F$ : OS=Lof(1) : Close 1

>Loke ST+OS,Asc.l("FORM"):Rem What's Asc.l in standard Amos

  Just use Poke$ ST+OS,"FORM".

Giday I'm currently trying to do some scrolling stuff with amos, and have 
come across something really annoying. When you use the scroll commmand 
in amos to move something about it works fine, but when you compile it, 
it gets this really bad flicker, which is not present when run from amos.
I need to be able to compile my programs, but still use this command.

Can ANYBODY help?!?

Take Monopoly for example: I guess I just have to use some random routines=20

Hi everybody !
I have some problems using menus in my game.
I'm using the On Menu Proc command but it doesn't work.
My screen is double buffered, and when I removed the double buffering, the=20
menus worked... But the screen must be double buffered !! What do I do wron=
g=20
??
The game is a cardgame, where you use a card on your hand pressing the left=

mousebutton and discards it pressing the right mousebutton.
The cards are defined as zones. My mainloop look something like this:
Do
   M=3DMouse Zone
   If M>0 And Mouse Key=3D1 Then PLY
   If M>0 And Mouse Key=3D2 Then DISCARD
Loop
But when I use menus, the program never goes to the DISCARD procedure when=20=
I=20
press the right mousebutton. What's the solution to that ??
I use AMOS Pro 2.00.

Greets to all,

I've uploaded yet another program of mine to Aminet (more to come). It's
in game/2play and it's called Knockout.lha.

It involves chasing around in a little car, trying to knock other cars
off the edge of a shrinking circle. And it's very addictive.

Slightly impressive technical facts about the game:
   8 cars running in a vbl without using Amal, including full collision
      detection and computer controlled (AI)!
   Each car is a different colour!
   The dual playfield is used without it jerking ('cos it doesn't scroll)!
   Screens fading into each other (sort of).
   Two games for the price of one (sort of).
   Amos source included!

Most of these will fail to impress once you play the game and look at
the source. ;-)

Hawkeye,

My advice is keep it simple.  Start off without the complicated things like 
bartering for streets.

It is always more satisfying to get something simple to work rather than 
fail with something complex.

Re: Dollars to donuts printing ;-)

Try checking which driver you were using on your 1.3 disk (in devs:printers)
against the one in 2.1.  You may want to even copy the old driver across if you
can't find a 2.1 one that does the job.  Only use generic as a last resort.

Has anyone found a way of using a joystick in place of a mouse in 
conjunction with interface programs - I have tried several methods 
and failed :-(  I want to be able to move my joystick so that the 
mouse pointer moves (that bits easy) and then when I press fire over 
a button I want the interface program to recognise that that button 
has been clicked - any ideas?

Now on to a completely different theme...

Can any of you clever extension writer come up with a command which 
ties Dim ARRAYNAME(X,Y) and Global ARRAYNAME() together in one 
command. It would be especially useful for those of us who have 
hundreds of arrays.

Now someting else...

What has happened to this mailing list - I'm only getting a few 
messages a day.

Has there been a mass suicide effort among amos users...?
Has the mafia mistaken the amos subscribers list as their next hit 
list...?
Or have lots of people started a new year at school...?

Cheers,

Mark

P.S Long live the amos mailing list :-)

re: modem to modem on AMOS

What kind of game were you looking for?

Presently, FBN (that's me when programming) is working on three.

1. ModemTrek  Over the modem play in the star trek genre with graphics,
   digitized sounds, lots of options.
   Release Date:  Late November

2. Dungeon II  Only you need this one.  All your opponent needs is an ANSI term
   prg.  It hearkens back to the days of text based adventure games and so far
   has two dungeon modules completed, a third on the way.
   Release Date:  Late October

3. Sub Challenge  Over the modem again, using Amos 3d.  Several different subs
   can be bought and customized while you hunt down your opponent.
   Release Date:  January `96

I have been concentrating on modem games as much as possible as we all enjoy
them so much more.  I've been refining my real time two player routines and am
getting some very promising results.

Unfortunately, FBN will be off the amos list after Sept. 25.  (my account here
expires).  You can get FBN games and utilities from CyberSpace BBS in the
Kitchener area. (I'd put them on aminet if I could figure out how to go about
that.  If someone would like to post how to upload to a site...)

I may be back a few times before then, but for now:

Goodbye to all of you.  It's been very productive being on this list.

Well met and godspeed,

...Hawkeye, right? Hawkeye:

I agree with Nick about your monopoly game. Keep it simple- that's the way
to go for now.

Bartering in Monopoly is dependent on the player's personality. Y'know, like
those idjits who'll trade away anything to get the Railroads. So to program
that sort of thing right, you'd need different computer personalities.

Get the program functional. Then do these sorts of extras.

my two cents, -Daniel Miller

now i got an LHA file to upload to aminet (3games in amos)buty the ibm disk
only accept 3 letters as extension after period (REA instead of readme). 
Shall I upload the file with the .rea file or they wont implement it because
instead of .readme Ihave a .rea file? or can I just make a readme file 
and put it inside the archive and will they accept that?

Yeah I have OctaMed (God knows what version), but no instructions so 
I've never really got very far with it.

As for your sample editor, I think I've seen it.  Will it work OK 
with Amos Pro then?

Well, let's start easily.... weaknesses:

* Not very good at using AMOS
* Not very good at graphics
* Can't compose music at all
* No sample or nice equipment
* Anything else
* Time (work almost all of it)

Strengths:

Hmm... I'll get back to you!

I may have got muddle up once more, but could the Amos program do 
something similar when waiting for the Blitz one to end:

Repeat
Until Exist ("RAM:FINISHED")
Kill "RAM:FINISHED"

Then, when the Blitz one has finished, it simply creates a file 
called FINISHED in (wait for it...) the RAM DISK and... erm... how 
about that?

Purple Saturn Day isn't it?

Mind you, I agree.  It's got to be something different and original.  
It would also allow the useless person (people?) like me to churn out 
increasingly useless ideas for it.

Or maybe that isn't an advantage?!

I think a Graphic Adventure game is quite a good idea, although we 
wouldn't need very many coders for it, it would allow lots of people 
to design graphics, write "music", come up with ideas and a plot etc.

The only problem with sampling Offspring or Stone Temple Pilots (or 
anything for that matter, really) is that it'll be very difficult to 
find music that we all like.  No matter what we say, they'll always 
be someone who thinks it's crap.  (probably me)

Robocop 3 was good, wasn't it?

Perhaps we should have a separate mailing list for this joint game?

I believe this was discussed a few weeks ago. Some CLI-based FTP programs 
will allow you to upload the program under a different name, like 
'put PROGRAM.REA Program.readme'. But I seem to remember that during the 
uploading session you can change the name of the files you already uploaded.
Has your FTP software, if it is GUI based, a rename button/menu?

I don't know about doom style, but wolfenstein like texturemapping
can be done with amos. I have a working engine where you can move around.
Everything texturemapped. And it does have monsters. Someday I'll release
a demo version of the engine. But first I'll convert the innerloops to
68k.

Hi everybody:

A short question. Anyone knows how to do trasparencies in AMOS?

Probably. A few of my old programs cause AMOSPro to crash because
of their menus - it this happens, remove all the command strings from
in the menu item names (All the LO 0,0 : BO 0,3 : LO 0,8 type stuff). 
This is due to a bug in the AMOS Pro menu commands.

P.s. To all those who think they can write DOOM in AMOS - Maybe
on chris hodges 68060, if he had 6 running in parallel! (P.s. AMOS 
3D's interpretation of the word texture mapping doesn't count - It 
just draws smaller vector objects on the surface, and looks crap).

Well, this looks good, I must say. Chances though, are that the group will never 
be able to dedicate themslves to just one of the great ideas that are being 
displayed here. To make things even more confusing I wish to announce my 
interest in this group, if I can find the time(I study).
My special abilities
1: I don't know what to compare with, but I suppose you could say I'm a little 
above medium in AMOS. I've also done C and Pascal but forgotten all about it

2: Graphics. Now we're talking! Maybe not. I raytrace, I draw, animate and move 
bobs and sprites around, but I don't think I'm up there with the kings.

3: Err...I have used samples, crappy on music.

4: Now we're definetly talking. I had in mind something in the style of 
Syndicate, adding elements of RPG's. You should be able to walk around talk to 
people(displaying a small pic of these characters), go into buildings trade. On 
bars for instance you could post messages and hire people. There you could also 
find small missions and stuff. The setting would be a large futuristic city of 
such size that you never can travel it all. It would be mouse controlled with a 
button interface at the bottom of the screen. Well, the potential is endless if 
you add...Multiplayer-capability via Internet or perhaps via some BBS. This can 
be done, I'm certain of it, they do play AirWarrior via modem. Think about 
running around in a large city, realtime, with other players running around in 
realtime. Interaction, trade, conversation, you name it!
	I have coded a program where you can walk around with a character, use 
different weapons(with different accuracy and sound effects), pick up ammo, 
walk, run and show a small picture in the bottom right corner of the interface 
screen. I'm currently working on the map-editor to construct 
background-graphics. I could upload this to Aminet or something I suppose, but I 
don't know how. Should Lha it? What rules exist? I have full Internet acces from 
the University I study at. Please give me a hint and some suggestions and other 
feedback.

5: I have perhaps 5-10 hrs a week.

6: I will return with more questions and problems in the days to come. Whatever 
project people settle with, I hope all things fare well.
I have: A1200 w 210 Mb HD 2 Mb chip. AmosPro 1.11

All Amos coders in Sweden could perhaps drop me a line and we could maybe do 
this locally?

Hi all,

My next upload is now visible on Aminet, it's called Bounce and it's in
game/jump. (Even more to come...)

It has no technically impressive programming feats, it's just a damn
fine game! It also happens to be my first proper Amos game, but don't
let that put you off! ;-)

It has very colourful, cartoony graphics and it mighty good fun to play.
You control a continually bouncing ball in his quest to collect jems,
get pulled through pipes, swim underwater and to get to the end of level
25!

Amos source code is included as well as a map editor.

Try using weights. Each option is given a weight depending on whats
happened. ie, If the computer owns 1 street out of 3 then give it a weigth
of 1. if the computer owns 2 streets give it a weight of 2. Then use a
random number generator to get a number (say between 1 and 3) if the number
is less than the weight, then the computer will buy the street.

This is a simple example, but I'm sure you can get the idea. You can
simulate different players by giving different weights for certain things,
such as one player who likes to buy railroads, another who buys anything,
and another who buys expensive streets, etc

Hm, Well I wrote a card game in Amos then upgraded to Amos Pro.  My card game
uses menus, almost extensively, including On Menu Proc.  I however, only use
a regular screen no double buffering for me.  I just had a idea snap into my
mind though.  If you use a double buffered screen would you have to set
the menus for both screens?  It sounds to me like this might be the case.

I thought of creating my GUI like this but I figured that it would be easier
to just use menus.

Yeah, I know about this one - and its VERY useful.  No more need for Set 
Zone commands...

This is definitely the right and only command to be used to find out 
which button the user is pressing with the fire button, but my main 
problem is emulating the actual click.

Hmmn, can anyone confirm this?  I know the manual keeps on going on 
about AMAL being much faster than their basic equivalents - but from 
my own personal experience this is not true. I don't know.

Thanks for your help.

I remember trying DIALOG UPDATE before but then I rejected it and I 
cant remember why.  One reason may be the inability of the function 
to cope with radio buttons (but I dont mind this TOO much).

Another reason may have been that I thought that the command does not
execute the "Button Change" code, but instead just the first bit of code 
which usually draws the button in whatever state its currently in - 
understand...?

However, today I found out that this clearly is not the case.  
Is it true that calling the DIALOG UPDATE (1,BUT,1-RDIALOG(1,BUT)) 
command when the fire button is pressed and then the same command 
when the fire button is released will EXACTLY emulate the clcik of a 
mouse button on a button which features the BR0 command so that it 
returns to its original position.

I hope this makes some sense!

Someone, I can't remember who suggested writing a game in a group,
this is a idea I've had for some time, and I would be very interested

you know) has been taken away by the ( nasty, unspirited, unfriendly, cruel,

2400baud, no Web (no WB3.0), curses...

This is always very difficult.  I have tried very hard to get my comput=

players to think in my Uno clone.  One of the methods I have had the mo=

success with is weighted numbers.  That is I give differnent possible l=

AI is basically the search to make computers think and they have come u=
p
with some interesting approaches.  So you might look in an AI book, but
it will probably be dry reading.

transparencies in AMOS. I'm now going to answer that question.

Making a screen with a picture and transparent text on it is
easy. Just make use of the fact that the Amiga uses bitmaps.
For example if you want a picture with transparent text on it
place the picture in the first bitmap(s) and then put the text
in the last bitmap.

This is a example of how to do this in AMOS:

----------------------------------------------

SCRW=320
SCRH=200

Screen Open 0,SCRW,SCRH,16,Lowres
Curs Off : Flash Off : Cls 0
Palette $0,$444,$555,$666,$777,$888,$999,$AAA,$976,$A87,$B98,$CA9,$DBA,$ECB,$FDC,$FED

PB=Phybase(3)

For P=1 To 100
   X=Rnd(319)
   Y=Rnd(199)
   XS=Rnd(50)+1
   YS=Rnd(50)+1
   Ink Rnd(6)+1
   Bar X,Y To X+XS,Y+YS
Next P

Screen Open 7,SCRW,SCRH,2,Lowres
Screen Hide 7
Curs Off : Flash Off : Cls 0

Text 50,50,"Just an example"
Text 80,80,"to show a transparent"
Text 100,30,"effect in AMOS"

Copy Phybase(0),Phybase(0)+(SCRW/8)*SCRH To PB

Hello all,
    Just a quick note to say that I am compiling all the messages that have
come in about the group project idea.  This will take a bit of time.  I have
not done it yet due to being away on Business!!!!  I actually have to work for
a living :-(

    Keep the ideas coming in.  More detailed info. will be supplied soon.

Some people have suggested setting up a dedicated mailing list.  How do you do
this, and is anyone prepared to run it?  How do you do it Michael?

Yeah, man, what more could a human being want other than sitting in 
front of an Amiga (it doesn't even have to be a '060, Chris ;-)) 
running a copy of Amos Professional.  I thought this was every 
Amos-List members' fantasy ;-).

Don't we all check our mail every five minutes just in case there's 
another fascinating stumbling block a fellow amos geaser has 
encountered?

Well, all I can say is Andy cannot be the dedicated amos user we all 
thought he once was - shame on you ;-)

Sorry, for the pointless message.

Cheers,

Mark


P.S Anyone have any thoughts about setting up a different list for 
the group game?
