thus comment on GUI Ext on the night of 29-Sep-97:
-> Mainly to Giark,

-> I have a question about the GUI Ext for ya...

-> If  I  install  it,  can I make use of the Iconify option even if it's
-> used in a normal Amos proggy such as a game etc?

-> I'm  not  really  interested  in writing WB Aplications with Amos as I
-> feel it's a bit too slow for this, or am I wrong about this too?

-> Thanx in advance...

Hmm, as far as I can tell, it should work with no problems. The only problem
you would have is if you used the GUI AMIGA 1 command, or something similar.

-> A minor upgrade, Realm of Sendai v0.63, is now avaliable to anyone

-> The next big thing that I plan to add to the game is music, and I'm

-> I would like to thank everyone who has tried the game so far for the
-> feedback they've provided. I haven't recieved many responses from the
-> v0.62 archive yet; if anyone has any first impressions, I'd love to
-> hear about them.

Its a nice game, I dont normally go for these kind of games, but you have put
an
exceptional amount of effort into it, especially with the GFX.

One problem I noticed (not sure if its in this newer archive) was after the
school had collapsed, I couldnt use the joystick to select the people who went
with me  =(   the rest seemed to work OK, but you have to remember that most
people dont have a keypad (mainly A600 users).

As for mod composers, try going on aminet or my PD library, and procuring the
email address's from some composers which you like the music from. Maybe they
have an unreleased mod or 2 you could use.

Yes, we appreciate the command. Just that we were first discussing this before

all,

I be looking for a bit of help.  I am writing a diary but need to be able
to validate a given date and return the day of the week the date falls (or
fell) on.  The date validation I have been able to do, including leap
years, but not the day of the week.

Any suggestions, example code?

Thanx

OK I give in! hands up `n' all that...

It's  just  that  I  used  InTOS  before  and  it  was very very slow.
(Although,  this  was  a  pre-release  version sent to me as being the
Amoszine  Editor ya see). Anyway, I thought it was Amos that was slow,
but I guess it was just IntOS all the time :)

Has  anyone  tried  the  Amos OSDev Kit? It was on 3 disks I think and
cost  about 30! I never got round to tring it properly, but I believe
it was supposed to be good and WB applications.

Wasnt it the easylife Iconify routine which generated quite a bit of CPU time,
when in iconify mode? I remember using one from an extension ages ago, and it
was quite CPU intensive.

Most likely. There's a similar command in EasyLife.

I  was  mighty  impressed with the speed of those demos ya sent me too
m8.  Who  would  have  thought it possible with Amos? The GUI Ext does
seem to be far more powerful than I first thought.

I  downloaded it and now have it slotted in. BTW I also downloaded the
GUI Compiler, but I'm having serious problems with it!

I  have it set up in my Amos Pro pull down menu, but when I access it,
it  obviously  throws  me  back to WB, but I thought the listing in my
interpreter would have been already set up to be compiled!

But  no!  I  have  to manually type in the filename I want to compile.
This  is  where  the  real  problem  occurs.  When I click on the LOAD
button, I get the good old Software Failure - Suspend/Reboot option!

It  works  fine if I manually type in the filename, but not if I click
on the LOAD button. Does anyone have this problem too?

And  can I use the GUI Compiler for normal Amos proggy compiling or is
it just for GUI applications?

I  agree, the Amos OS Dev Kit was far too expensive and from what I've
heard,  it was a right barst to use too. Although it was claimed to be
quite good if you knew what you were doing!!!

Still,  GUI  wins  the  day yet again. You've talked me into trying it
out.

You probably won't get a response! :(

But  your  idea  is  a  good  one and I think all the List guyz should
create  a  small  GUI  example and someone could send 'em all to Amiga
Format at once :)

In fact, it might be better if they were all sent individually to show
AF  how  pissed  off  Amos  users are when we read such crap about our
favourite language.

If  AF  think  Amos  is so crap, why on Earth did they see fit to give
away a coverdisk version all those months ago? And why oh why did they
used  to praise it to the high heavens and include source code on past
cover disks etc...?

Contradicting themselves methinx :)

Anyway,  AF  is turning out to be a real shitty mag! CU is much better
(as far as the CD's go anyway)

Gee! Thanx mom! hehehe

Cool advertising there methinx m8y...

Thanx  for  the demo's ya sent also. Amazing to see it in action....at
last.

BTW  I  also  had a quick look at the Amos MUI proggy a while back and
found it intersting, to say the least. Let's piss all over Blitz users
with some great MUI/GUI Amos coded jobbies please :)

We'll  show  Amiga  Format that Amos is still going strong and is well
capable of wb apps.

Do  you think we would all be wasting our time if we all sent at least
one little GUI demo to AF to get the point across?

I'll be in if everyone else agrees?

All we really need is a proper AGA Ext now and we're laughing....

Oops. Guess I better make another release- v0.64. I've fixed the
problem with joystick control in party selection, and also added
support for the cursor keys + enter.

As I've just graduated University, this game will probably have
the fastest tech support on the net... at least until I find a job!

Thanx m8. I thought the Pro version of Easylife had done away with the

thus comment on GUIExt on the night of 02-Oct-97:

-> Just a quick question for the GUIExt Experts:

Ooh, fire away...

-> I'm currently porting all of the AMOSPro apps I use here at work to use the
-> GUIExt. This means that I currently need to use standard AMOSPro and
-> AMOSPro+GuiExt alternately. My problem is there seems to be no way to end a
-> programme, and kill AMOSPro altogether (to give control back to the
workbench
-> with no trace of AMOSPro still running).

I dont quite get what you mean exactly here. Are you trying to quit out of
AMOS
and shut it down altogether, or just hide it from view. If you use the AMOS TO
BACK/AMOS TO FRONT commands in your progams, the AMOSPro editor will shift to
the back, giving workbench back etc. To quit the AMOSPro from within a
program,
use any command which would end a session in the editor, such as END, EDIT,
DIRECT etc.

-> Sure I can hide the AMOSProit when it
-> finishes, but if someone starts another app from the workbench, then AMOS
is
-> still in the background (at the editor displaying the last line of the
prog.)

>From this, it would sound like you are not compiling your programs with the
compiler. I am selling the AMOSPro compiler now for around 14 UK pounds, go to
WWW.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk for more details.

To make your program shut down AMOSPro altogether from the editor, you should
use the SYSTEM command, but beware, this will completely shut AMOS down.

-> This would be O.K. but AMOSPro doesn't let me do this reliably (disc access
-> always means a crash), and I guess I'm chewing up a whole bunch of memory
each
-> time. What to do?

The GUI Extension compiler patch allows you to compile programs, and also
allows
you to run any number of AMOS programs together, without messing any of them
up,
its really quite amazing. It doesnt use a whole lot of memory either when you
compile your programs.

-> TIA,
-> Rod
-> By and by, how do I get a hold of v1.63?

The V1.63 is only available to beta testers at the moment, as pietro is still
adding a few more cunning commands to it. When it comes out, it will be
available from my AMOS FTP site.

I have heard stories of IntOS being mightily cack, and so never pursued

This is another one that ive heard a few stories on, but never actually seen
it
in person to really decide for myself. Why pay 30 pounds for 3 disks, when the
GUI extension does it all, and much more, for just postcardware!

Did anyone else read the nasty article in AF (September 97) on the bottom
right
of page 16, by Ben Vost saying AMOS was useless at making OS based
applications?

I think i'll mail my Mailinglist Manager program to him directly and ask him
to
rethink when he see's what the GUI extension can do, hehe.

Nah! You don't wanna do it like that!

F$="yourtextfilepath"
BNK=10 : Rem Any Bank
Open in 1,F$
L=Lof(1)
Close 1
Reserve As Data BNK,L
Bload F$,Start(BNK)

ST=Start(BNK)

Do
  Exit If ST=>Length(BNK) : Rem I think this may be wrong!!!
  A$=Peek$(ST,79,Chr$(10)) : Rem 79 chars and Chr$(10) checked.
  Add ST,Len(A$)+1
  Print A$
Loop

The  above  is  just  from  my  memory, so it may not be 100%! You can
change the Chr$(10) to Chr$(13) if reading MS-DOS files.

If  that's  not  what  your after, I'm sure that the LDos Ext has some
commands to change the EOL character search.

eg.

Lset Eoln 13 : Rem MS-DOS check

or

Lset Eoln 10 : Rem Amiga-DOS check

Check out the LDos dox for more great string handling....

Hope this has helped :)

Andy Gee!

Dunno, sorry :(

Simply do the following....

A$=Hex$(50)
B$=A$-"$"
Print B$

Which will give the value 32 without the leading `$'

hope this helps :)

Sorry  I didn't have answers to your other quesies, but I'm sure I was

MIME-Version: 1.0

Just a quick question for the GUIExt Experts:
I'm currently porting all of the AMOSPro apps I use here at work to use the
GUIExt. This means that I currently need to use standard AMOSPro and
AMOSPro+GuiExt alternately. My problem is there seems to be no way to end a
programme, and kill AMOSPro altogether (to give control back to the workbench
with no trace of AMOSPro still running). Sure I can hide the AMOSProit when it
finishes, but if someone starts another app from the workbench, then AMOS is
still in the background (at the editor displaying the last line of the prog.)
This would be O.K. but AMOSPro doesn't let me do this reliably (disc access
always means a crash), and I guess I'm chewing up a whole bunch of memory each
time. What to do?
TIA,
Rod
By and by, how do I get a hold of v1.63?

I`ve just been doing this myself with my Monty game. I`ve also had 
problems booting up on 1.3 but now boots up perfectly.

>C

You dont really need this drawer, its basically only there to hold
Commands. If you want you can put any executable in the root drawer but
this just makes things untidy.

>S

Like you said this drawer is only really used for the startup-sequence.
Some proggys make prefs files here but that mainly for app proggys.

>Libs

This drawer is pretty obvious. Just copy over any libs you may need to
use. For example copy over the math librarys if your using any of the
math commands and copy over the diskfont.library if your using any
font reading. But remember to copy the correct versions of these
librarys because newer versions will make the executable bug out on 1.3
(as I already know :(  Cheers Andy)

Another drawer you forgot is the L drawer. This is used for certain 
handlers. If your using certain ports or drives. For example copy over
the ram-handler if your using the ram: disk.

>Has anyone made a working boot disk?

Yep I have, and its working perfectly now (havent I said that before ?)

Hope this helps Jace,

Anthony Sherratt

Did anyone else read the nasty article in AF (September 97) on the bottom 
right
of page 16, by Ben Vost saying AMOS was useless at making OS based 
applications?
     
I think i'll mail my Mailinglist Manager program to him directly and ask him 
to
rethink when he see's what the GUI extension can do, hehe.

The DEVS drawer also helps. Your 1.3 system-configuration sits here, as
well as your device handlers (eg narrator.device if you're using speech).
It's not required, though.

The other thing you'll need to do is "install" the disk...
Open a Shell window, insert your disk, and type "install df0:" (or
whatever drive it's in).
The install program writes a valid bootblock to the disk. Without this,
it'll never boot.


Ok. Hope that's helpful!

See ya'll

Hi All..

Now i have a question for all of ya AMOS freaks out there!!!

Is there some good extension that converts Dec to Hex ???

I know AMOS has one of it self but i doesn't like it.

A$=Hex$(50) give me the answer $32
But i doesn't want the $-sign in the value.. 

How do i copy a section of memory Ex.(175760-1788332) to
section (278544-281616)????



And now to my second problem!

If i load a hiscore with 
Bload"bla:bla.blascore",5
and a second one with
Bload"bla:bla.blascore2",6

how do i merge them into one hiscore??

with the highest first etc..
( i only need a type of sort routine or ???)

Happy to get answers..

The man most directly responsible for this twaddle was mtl.wberg@swipnet.se,
who did thus comment on need help on the night of 02-Oct-97:
-> Is it possible to make amos 2 change lines with another assii value than
-> then MS-DOS chr$(13)?

-> When i read a text file without that i will recive an error mezz
-> (input to long), 

-> Ex
-> open in 1,a$
-> repeat
-> input #1,b$
-> until pof(1)=lof(1)

This is a common problem which can easily be solved:

Ex
Open In 1,a$ : Set Input 10,-1

Repeat
Line Input #1,B$
Until Eof(1)

You can unpack any crunched file using the xfd decrunching tools off the
aminet.  You could read it then.

-> I  was  mighty  impressed with the speed of those demos ya sent me too
-> m8.  Who  would  have  thought it possible with Amos? The GUI Ext does
-> seem to be far more powerful than I first thought.

I am actually working on a larger, full GUI extension demo, which will cover
all
of its various powers. Because of the way Petro wrote it, it is as fast as it
possibly can go.

-> I  downloaded it and now have it slotted in. BTW I also downloaded the
-> GUI Compiler, but I'm having serious problems with it!

The GUI compiler should be in the same archive. You will need to run the
GUIPatch.AMOS program, which copies your system files and makes a patched
version of the APCmp compiler routine.

-> I  have it set up in my Amos Pro pull down menu, but when I access it,
-> it  obviously  throws  me  back to WB, but I thought the listing in my
-> interpreter would have been already set up to be compiled!

-> But  no!  I  have  to manually type in the filename I want to compile.
-> This  is  where  the  real  problem  occurs.  When I click on the LOAD
-> button, I get the good old Software Failure - Suspend/Reboot option!

-> It  works  fine if I manually type in the filename, but not if I click
-> on the LOAD button. Does anyone have this problem too?

Hmm, ive never had this problem. Try to compile the GUI Compiler as an
executable, and run it that way. You will need to direct it to the GUICmp
program before you can use it. If that still has problems, I suggest you get a
newer version of the ASL.library routines.

-> And  can I use the GUI Compiler for normal Amos proggy compiling or is
-> it just for GUI applications?

I think it can be used for normal AMOS programs, but unless they have valuable
GUI commands inside them, I wouldnt reccomend it.

Hmm, I tried one MUI extension-type system a while back, and couldnt get it to

What would be nice for MUI extension (super hint-hint) is an ultra-GUI creator
(like gadtoolsbox, but with all the major capabilities a MUI application can
display) so we can make even more powerfull functions.

I might try it once again when I finish my mailinglist manager.

Hmm, i have never *ever* tried to do it this way, it would be wayyy to big.
Twinz used a high score table of 3 sets of 10 positions, and i'll go get the
source and paste it into here...

      For N=1 To 10
         TP=TSCORE(N)
         If SCORE>TP : Rem or N=2 
            For O=10 To N Step -1 : TSCORE(O)=TSCORE(O-1) :
TSCORE$(O)=TSCORE$(O-1) : Next O
            TSCORE(N)=SCORE : TSCORE$(N)=TEX$
         End If 
      Next N

The routine finds the position of the highest point in the table it can go (if
any) by running through all possible entries, and its higher value will be
first, and N will be loaded with the current slightly-lower value.

The second part of the routine, shuffles them all down by 1 position, from 1
to
2, 2 to 3 etc. and inserts the value in SCORE in the correct space.

Your better off to load the text file into a memory bank. Once this is
done then just Peek from it to read each letter and type to the screen.

Screen Open 0,640,200,2,Hires

F$=Fsel$("")
Open In 1,F$ : L=Lof(1) : Close 1 : Rem Gets file size 
Reserve As Work 10,L : Rem Can be any bank number 
Bload F$,Start(10) : Rem Load file into memory

While POS<L
   LINE$=Peek$(Start(10)+POS,100,Chr$(10))
   Print LINE$
   Add POS,Len(LINE$)+1

Hope this helps,

Hi Peter

>Is there a smooth way to sort 20 variables???

If your using arrays (I think you are from the example) your better off
to use 'for` loops.  Is this for a high score table ?  Anyways heres
some example code.

Dim HISCORES(19),HINAME$(19) } At the beginning of the program 

For C=19 To 0 Step -1                      }  Checks where your
   If SCORE>HISCORES(C) : POS=C : End If   }  score ranks in the
Next C                                     }  high score table
'
For C=18 To POS Step -1
   HISCORES(C+1)=HISCORES(C) : HINAME$(C+1)=HINAME$(C) } Knocks all the

Hi!

Is there a smooth way to sort 20 variables???

and not do like this..

--------------------------------

If score1_1(1)>score2_1(1)

Loke S7+40,Leek(S5+20)

endif

if score1_2(2)>score2_1(1)

loke s7+60,leek(s5+40)

endif

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There's loads of different methods of sorting an array.
Most of them use loops. The quickest ones use recursion.

I'm sure there's a "Sort" command in Amos. I recall ever having
used it, but I'm sure it's there.

If you can't use that, try this:

cnt   - loop counter
cnt2  - second loop counter
siz   - number of array elements
srt() - the array to sort
tmp   - a temporary var to hold a copy of one srt().

For cnt=1 to siz-1
   For cnt2=cnt+1 to siz
      Rem Out of sequence?
      If srt(cnt) > srt(cnt2)
	 Rem then swap the two variables.
         tmp=srt(cnt)
	 srt(cnt)=srt(cnt2)
	 srt(cnt2)=tmp
      Endif
   Next
Next


A recursive 'quick sort' would be much quicker, but isn't easy to
understand like this one.

Hope that answers your question.

See ya.

Hello everybody out there..

I'm going to start out on a BIG project, an AMOS clone of Civilization,
here's a few improvements in relation to the original..

- MUCH bigger maps
- More various landtypes (Ideas, please !!)
- More various units (Ideas, please !!)
- More units allowed
- More city improvements (Ideas, please !!)
- Units gets XP's (So that an experienced unit is better than a rookie)
- Possibility to be seveal human players
- Upgrading units (keeping their XP's with new weappons)
- Cities can expand their grounds (Getting VERY big)
- City names can use 'special' characters (, , , , etc.)

I would love to hear about ideas and comments for this project, also I'm
looking for people who'd like to test it as I'm getting along and I'd like
to get in touch with some cool GFX people to draw landtiles and units.

But, as i'm planing to open for 256 various landtiles and 65536 unittypes
(I know sound wild, but planning it is easy), and I'd like to run everything
on a 64 colours EHB screen (making all tiles 64 EHB too) gets me in serious
trouble in relation to chip-ram (using icons/bobs), I've planed to reserve
a work-bank and put 'em there and then transfering the tiles/units with
Doke/Deek (width is 16). I know how that is done (not my first time), but
I was wondering if anyone had a better way of doing this, but it has to use
FAST-ram, (Cblocks is to slow, Icons and blocks uses Chip and loading from
HD is to slow)...

Just wondered, do you think it sounds to much to run on 64 colours screen ??

NB: If any of you've got graphics on stock I'd be very grateful, so I'll
have something to start on, The tile-size for both land and units will
be 16*16 in 64c EHB...

Happy greetings, Yours..

I haven't checked it, but something like:
Copy Start_of_Source,End_of_Sorce to Start_of_Dest
(Be sure that you've got enough memory at Dest or crash..)

Uhh, reserve a new bank with enough room to hold both lists, then sort 'em
out and put 'em in using the order you'd like, an easy high-hunter should
be enough as I don't expect you've got that many to remember, and to make
very advanced binary sorting on that is a waste of time.. (High-hunt= run
down the list to find the highest value, store that, then run down again
the find the second, and so on)

This is the second sorting thing written so heres my bubble sort 
routine.
Im doing this now from memory so it may/may not work

Dim v(20)               <-our variables
...
.....

Repeat
c=0
For q=1 to 19
IF v(q)>v(q+1)
 temp=v(q)
 v(q)=v(q+1)
 v(q+1)=temp         <-swap em round
 c=1
END IF
Next q
Until c=0

That should work!! hopefuly

This is from memory, so might not be perfect:

L=$7FFFFFFF 
For A=1 to 20
   T=-1 : SN=-1
   For B=2 to 20
      If SCORE(B)>T and SCORE(B)<L
         T=SCORE(B) : SN=B 
      Endif
   Next B
   If SN>-1
      'SN will hold the index-number of the score
      'Put is down where you'd like it to be
      'A holds the rating of the score (1=High, 20=Low)
   Else
      Exit
   Endif
   L=T 
Next A

NOTE: This won't handle two equal scores (I'll lose one of 'em), but that
should not be so hard to handle (Let me know if you got problems with it)

If a program has an AREXX port, they usually come with a set of instructions
in
the documentation files which tell you basically how to use the main program
via
a script.

What they will do, is perform actions in the program from a command-line, pre
set level, so they can perform common tasks etc.

It would be a good idea to study these commands, then make an ASCII file with
them in (according to the documentation) and run it with RX whilst Final
writer
is running.

Ive dabbled in REXX a little bit, I wrote a POP3 retrieval script and a few
other bits and bats, and the programs that use REXX usually have their own
command sets anyhow.

IntOS... *arrrgghhhhh!!!!* A very stupid program..... it is the tipical
example of how a Amiga program shouldn't be written!

I've tried it.... but it's very boring to use. You can create an
application only if you have a deep knowledge of the Amiga OS.

I'm recieving OK but I'm not sure that I'm sending OK. I never seem to
get my mail back that I send to the list any more. Has the list
changed so that it doesn't do this anymore or is something wrong or am
I just wrong?

Hi all!

Now i'm really pissed off...

I'm writing this hiscore merger and it's getting big.. 
Then the text buffer get's to small and i thought yup.. just to
do the buffer bigger.. Worked fine... But now when i'm loading the .AMOS
file it ask's for adjust buffer size, sure.. do it.. 
But when i'm pushed F1 it all crash.. GURU..! U know..

What's wrong.. If i load the .AMOS file, and adjust the buffer size..
and copy the listing to a new listing.. It all works fine.. But the old
listing won't work...

Anyone got the solution?????

Ever think of using Swap var1,var2? It's actually faster. Yes Swap is an amos

Oh no... you must use the GUI Compiler supplied in the GUI extension v1.62
archive. The one available on Aminet is a old version...

Install the new GUI Compiler/Shell and try again.

NO... you can use it for GUI application only. The GUI Compiler removes ALL
the Amos patches since the GUI works in a intuition enviroment, and it
doesn't needs all the Amos bullshits. But if you must display Amos screens,
and so on you must use the standard compiler.

Short:    Post Same Mails to Large Lists of Recipients Easily
Author:   Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett (mushypd@redrose.net)
Uploader: Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett (mushypd@redrose.net)
Type:     comm/mail

Ever had a large list of email recipients who you want to send the same
mail to, such as a mailing list of people for example, and cant be bothered
to make each individual message in YAM, or use the BCC: function in case it
messes up, well now you can safetly.

This small program has a simple GUI which allows you to input the necessary
data, such as where the list of recipients is, and the ASCII file you wish
to send them, your Email address, and its just a case of hitting the GO!
button.

Fully customizable interface, which supports many tooltypes for ease of
use, including GUI font sensitivity.

This program is WWW-ware, which means in order to keep using this free
utility, you must visit my Amiga WWW pages at
http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk and have a look around, and maybe learn a
few things!!

Subject: AMOSPro or GUI Extension bug?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: O
X-Status: 

Im having a problem with AMOSPro, and I dont know if it is the Pro editor
itself, or something in the GUI extension that is affecting it.

The problem is quite simple. My source code is being tampered with. Im
using a procedure which executes a DOS command, and sends its output to a
window which I define. Its not a GUI extension window, either. I'll rip the
source code for the procedures im using, and be right back... OK Here they
are:

Procedure WCL[N]
   ' This procedure closes a window I have opened
   If WINCON(N)=0 Then Goto ERR
   Dreg(1)=WINCON(N)
   X=Doscall(-36)
   If X=0
      Goto ERR
   End If 
   Pop Proc
   ERR:
   ERR=Doscall(-132)
   '   System 
   End 
End Proc

Procedure WEX[N,COM$]
   ' This procedure will execute a DOS command in COM$ and send the output
   ' To Window (N)
   If WINCON(N)=0 Then Goto ERR
   Dreg(1)=Varptr(COM$)
   Dreg(2)=0
   Dreg(3)=WINCON(N)
   X=Doscall(-222)
   If Len(COM$)>0
      V=Varptr(COM$)
      For ZZ=0 To Len(COM$)-1 : Poke ZZ+V,0 : Next ZZ
   End If 
   If X=0
      Goto ERR
   End If 
   Pop Proc
   ERR:
   ERR=Doscall(-132)
End Proc

Procedure WOP[N,X,Y,XX,YY,NAME$]
   ' This opens a CLI window XX=Width  YY=Height  NAME$=Title
   X$=Str$(X)-" "
   Y$=Str$(Y)-" "
   XX$=Str$(XX)-" "
   YY$=Str$(YY)-" "
   CON$="CON:"+X$+"/"+Y$+"/"+XX$+"/"+YY$+"/"+NAME$
   CON$=CON$+Chr$(0)
   Dreg(1)=Varptr(CON$)
   Dreg(2)=1005
   WINCON(N)=Doscall(-30)
   If WINCON(N)=0
      ERR=Doscall(-132)
      'System  
      End 
   End If 
End Proc

Procedure WPR[N,M$]
   ' This prints the text in M$ to Window (N)
   If WINCON(N)=0 Then Goto ERR
   Dreg(1)=WINCON(N)
   Dreg(2)=Varptr(M$)
   Dreg(3)=Len(M$)
   X=Doscall(-48)
   If X=0
      Goto ERR
   End If 
   Pop Proc
   ERR:
   ERR=Doscall(-132)
   WCL[1]
   '  System  
   End 
End Proc

OK, the above procedures are the ones which involve the CLI tasking which I
am/was using in my program. The below procedure is one of the ones which
are seriously affected by the problem...

Procedure _GETNEWS
   ' Executes the AREXX script which will grab the news for the user. 
   
   If Not Exist("Mailserv:REXX/NNTPTransfer") : Rem News Recovery Program
      SEL=Gui Req("News Recovery Error...","Cannot find news recovery
script."+Chr$(10)+"Please check you installed program correctly","OK")
      Pop Proc
   End If 
   
   ' Open up a CLI window and grab the news!
   Proc WOP[2,50,50,540,100,"Mailinglist Manager Output..."]
   Proc WPR[2,"Attempting to Execute News Recovery script"+Chr$(10)+Chr$(10)]
   Proc WEX[2,"SYS:REXXC/Rx Mailserv:REXX/NNTPTransfer"]
   Wait 200
   WCL[2]
End Proc

Now, the real problem is the fact that the routine is deleting the contents
of the WEX[""] line, no matter where i run it from, and no matter what is
in it, when I go back to source format, the line will read:

   Proc WEX["

Thats it, it misses a quote, and a square bracket. The wierdest thing, is
it tests OK, and will run again, but the contents that were in it are
annulled and doesnt pass any commands to the CLI apart from a ""

Ive never used these procedures in ages, and only after starting using the
GUI extension, am I discovering these wierd effects. Like I said, I dont
know if its AMOSPro, or the GUI Extension.

Can anyone here see what is wrong? When the program is compiled, it will
execute the script once, then it annuls itself, and wont close the window
as the system has locked due to the error. I really ned to send the output
of a program to a window though. Please help me!!!!

The man most directly responsible for this twaddle was Steve Wood, who did
thus comment on Amiga Format and Amos on the night of 06-Oct-97:
-> Guys,

-> Since the rounds of slagging AF off for their slagging off of Amos, have
-> you seen the current mag?

-> Readers stuff has 8 entries, 6 of which are written in either Amos Classic
-> or Amos Pro, the other to in Blatz Biscuit, or whatever it is.  The star
-> prize was even awarded to a compendium of classic arcade games written in
-> Amos.

-> Weather they like it or not, Amos is here to Stay.

-> Live long and Prosper!

Yes, its the same every issue. If you look real closely, for the last few
months, there has been an AMOS game by our very own robert Benjamin. I
havent got the latest issue yet, I didnt have enough cash when I was in
Software Hut.

They just dont seem to understand that AMOS is the choice of language for
all beginner programmers, and they tend to stay with it more because of its
simplicity and power - which AF dont seem to be able to figure out yet.

Anyone here know anything whatsoever about "The AMOS Learning Curve" in the
UK? Im curious if they are on the 'net or not, as I would like to get in
touch with them, rather than sending an SAE to the UK. Their adverts are
appearing in the amiga mags.

Just thought I would let you know of my progress with the US Immigration
department (as it would affect the library seriously if I was sent home). I
went for my greencard interview this week, and after a hefty series of
questions, along the lines of "What colour toothbrush does your wife use"
and other such pointless questions, they let me have my greencard for at
least 2 years.

This is great news, as I dont have to worry about stopping service to all
us AMOS users, as back in UK I couldnt be online nearly as often as I am now.

For those who cant get on the FTP site, its a problem at ml.org, and they
say that the DYNDNS scheme will be working again tomorrow.

Can anybody tell me what is wrong with this...

COM$="C:ViewTek Data:Pictures/Pic1"
AMOS To Back
Exec COM$
AMOS To Front

Instead of displaying the picture it asks me to select a picture.
Is it not possible to pass parameters to EXECed commands?

Note: I was only doing this in the absence of any AGA support.  Is there any 
sign of the extension yet??

Also, as an aside (not AMOS related!), has anyone managed (or even 
attempted) to install NetBSD?
It was on the cover CD of AF last month and again this month but I have 
followed the instructions to the letter and came a cropper when it says 
something like ' ensure LOADBSD command is in your path and execute it'. 
 Unfortunately the command did not appear to be included!  Any ideas?

P.S.  No luck with the printer as yet.  Will be getting some ink today so 
will try out the many suggestions tonight.
This command

Wayne.

Guys,

Since the rounds of slagging AF off for their slagging off of Amos, have
you seen the current mag?

Readers stuff has 8 entries, 6 of which are written in either Amos Classic
or Amos Pro, the other to in Blatz Biscuit, or whatever it is.  The star
prize was even awarded to a compendium of classic arcade games written in
Amos.

Weather they like it or not, Amos is here to Stay.

Live long and Prosper!

With a mighty cry of "You'll never get my taxes!", Cap'n Bubba arrives for
another update request.

If you read Amiga Report, you'll know that they are making the transition to
HTML format. This falls right into our hands. Along with the demos due on the
15th, can you all send a screen shot of your level? I'll compose a page as a
press release using all the screen shots. I'd like to include the intro anim
if it has been finished. I'll whip off a couple of Cap'n Bubba samples and all
that and also put it on my site for general view. With a bit of effort, we may
be able to get this monster ready for Christmas.
 
Well met and godspeed,

Hmmm, the LOADBSD file could be a problem, but it should go around it. Try
running the exact command from a CLI window and se if it works. If the
problem still messes up, try to run SNOOPDOS to see what the problem is.

Hi everyone,

I  thought  I'd  send  you lot this email I received from the CU-List.
It's  some  guy slagging off Amos. I think we should all flame him for
his total ignorance of our fave language...

Hmmm...I think Mathew needs a good (snip)

We  can't  let  peeps get away with this. It's harming our reputation.
Stand  up  for Amos. Please. If a PC owner slags off your Amiga, do ya
just sit back and let 'em?

So  why  should we let peeps do this to Amos. Not any longer. I'm sick
of it. I bet this guy hasn't even tried programming (even in C64 basic
never mind Amos!)

Phuk! ASCII scripts would be too much for him!

I'd better stop before I get started ;

ttfn, Andy Gibson.

BTW  Subscribe to the cu-list. There's loads of emails each day. I got
around 80 today and still more to collect tonite!!!

Hi everyone,

I was wondering if there's a way of finding the particular device that a
volume belongs to:

eg. Given "Workbench:" I want to find its particular device such as  "dh0:"

Its easy enough to find the volume name given the device by using the AMCAF
extension, but I need to do it the other way around.

Any help would be appreciated

Hello Everyone,


Just a little note to say that I have sent Mr. Giark an update to my
SideShooter stage.

The SideShooterDemo#5 will be of particular interest to anyone who
has a SLOW system (less than A1200 w/FastRAM).

The program now detects such a system and recalibrates just about
everything, from Bubba's velocity, shot-speeds/fire-delay, enemy-
velocities as well as full recalibration of all enemy pattern-data,
scrolling-speed and so on.

Be warned, it will be TWICE as intense now as you will be 
playing at the same "virtual speed" as the rest of us.


For those who had no problem getting good, fast action (50-60fps),
the only major addition is the MidBossBattle. See if you can
"bring 'im down"...


Anyway, hope you all like the new demo...


   Take  care,
   GARFIELD

Oh no.... the bug is in the WEX procedure, exactly here:


If Len(COM$)>0
      V=Varptr(COM$)
      For ZZ=0 To Len(COM$)-1 : Poke ZZ+V,0 : Next ZZ
End If 


This is a *very* bad idea. The FOR cycle is destroing your source code!
Poke directly a 0 into a amos string is dangeours... the explanation is a
bit boring. You can find it in the AmosPro manual... section 14.A.08


In order to fix the problem, remove this unuseful(???) lines from the
procedure.

Hello All,


I am working on a game in AMOS.

It's called SpaceWarsII (my brother wrote SpaceWarsI).

It is an strategy game, where you can order your troops around the systems. You fight with other ships, you land and fight men to men, you defend your bases with guard towers, you build more ships, you buy and sell fuel, men and ships and much more.

The game is about the good guys and the bad guys. The bad guys are the evil Empire and the good guys the people from Earth. Thousands of years have past since colonist from Earth took the step out in the space. 24 systems are now colonized. But then the evil Empire was created; and they set up bases on almost every planet. They ruled now completely all of the planets.
But then you came, and with anly one ship and some money, you destroyed the empire, and the peace in the galaxy was complete.
Many years has passed since that, and now the empire has rised again. From their mainbase at the planet Tyrus, they sent 20 big warships to crush the alliance. They almost succeded; only Earth survived this strike. The empire sent all thier power to destroy the opposition. But they failed, because of the extreme defence of Earth. All thier troops sent there was destroyed.
11 of the 20 warships is still existing and flying around and terror the people. The Empire have sent for 20 new warships.
Now it's your turn again. Defeat the Empire before the reinforcments arrive.
The whole world counts on you.

Does it sounds intresting?

Anyone wants screenshots or the half-ready code?

I'd like to have some thoughts and ideas about this game.
If anyone likes to help me with finishing it i would me more than happy to send you a copy.

Here's an AMOS-bug for your knowledge.

On <whatever> Proc A,B[<Anything>],C,D

Calling procedure A will always work but if you try to call C or D you'll 
probably collect a guru. Even B[] becomes very unstable.
Solution: Call a dummy Procedure like this...

On <whatever> Proc A,DUMMY,C,D
.
.
Procedure DUMMY
  B[<Anything]
End Proc

No more gurus :-)

Maybe try this out....

A$="df0:c/viewtek"
b$="df0:pics/mypic"

Exec A$+Chr$(32)+B$+Chr$(10)+Chr$(0)

You  may  not  need Chr$(10), but Chr$(0) should maybe be there at the
end to NULL terminate the file. Try it different ways.

Chr$(32) simply = " " a space. Hope this helps ;)

If  you can use Amos, you can use Blitz. I bought V2.1 and hated it to
death!  Blitz is harder to use and the interface is crappy compared to
Amos Pro.

I  still  haven't written anything worth releasing using Blitz. I just
hate it. Amos Pro does everything I ever needed anyway :)

Why change a good thing...?

> Its also FULLY AGA compatible and fully OS compatible.

We know (sigh), but one day Amos might have AGA too (We can dream!)

As  far  as OS goes, the GUI Ext for Amos is the best I've seen. I had
no idea that it would be so quick and easy(!!!). It's much better than
IntOS and all the other `so called' Amos OS Extensions.

Check it out...

> (Just a note).

It's  just  a  note that pissed me off. Why bother mentioning Blitz at
all  on  the Amos list? If you hate it, fine, so do I and many others,
but  let's  not  start a `I love Amos and Hate Blitz' campaign! It's a
waste of space.

Each to their own `n' all that. 

I  don't  know  if  I  picked you up wrongly, but were you for Amos or
against  it?  What  with  your opening line....STOP LIVING IN YOUR OWN
WORLDS! What was that all about?

Were you on drugs when ya typed this? hehehe ;

I can see a war starting...

(as long as there's no pulling hair or scratching, I don't mind :^)

ttfn, Andy Gibbers

Well, this does the opposite, but I'm sure you could fiddle about with
it and get the results and best of all, no extensions as suggested...

Cut  and save as AMOSFILE.asc and load into Amos using the Merge Ascii
option from the Project menu...

' If you have a disk in any drive and you want to kno what its name

'  You can use any device name such as DF0: DF1: HD0: DH0: etc.

' The printed result will be the name of the disk in DF1: in this

'
' One example to use this for would be when an app lets the user

Hi all,

It  occured  to me that some peeps still are not writing code for CD남
users to input their name into the hiscore table with a joystick!

Let's  say  your  demo of your latest game is on a CU or AF CD and the
user is a proud CD남 ownner and your game requires them to input their
name vai the keyboard only!!!

They're phukked!

Same  applies  to  the QUIT mode of your game. Don't just tell them to
press Q on the keyboard!

Why  not  make  use  of the CD남 Joypad routine? I think MUSH may have
this lying around, if not I do and it works 100%.

I've  tested  it  with my Competition Pro CD남 pad and it works like a
dream.

For those of you who don't have a CD남 pad and don't know where to get
one, look at Amiga Format Issue 103 on page 55.

GoldenImage (UK) Ltd sell them for 14.00  -  a bargain. Don't know if
it's Compitition Pro or original CD남 pad though! Still, it's the only
ad I've seen in a long time which mentions the cd남 pad.

call...0181 900 9291

or

Are you reading this Ant???

ttfn Andy Gee!

The man most directly responsible for this twaddle was Johannes Rydh, who did
thus comment on New AMOS game on the night of 07-Oct-97:

When you get some kind of preview/demo done, could you send it to me for
inclusion
in my library. Thanks.

The first version of the game, is this done in AMOS also, and is there a
playable version
of this game that can be placed in the library?

Take care

Mush

-> Hello All,


-> I am working on a game in AMOS.

-> It's called SpaceWarsII (my brother wrote SpaceWarsI).

-> It is an strategy game, where you can order your troops around the systems.
-> You fight with other ships, you land and fight men to men, you defend your
-> bases with guard towers, you build more ships, you buy and sell fuel, men
and
-> ships and much more.

-> The game is about the good guys and the bad guys. The bad guys are the evil
-> Empire and the good guys the people from Earth. Thousands of years have
past
-> since colonist from Earth took the step out in the space. 24 systems are
now
-> colonized. But then the evil Empire was created; and they set up bases on
-> almost every planet. They ruled now completely all of the planets.
-> But then you came, and with anly one ship and some money, you destroyed the
-> empire, and the peace in the galaxy was complete.
-> Many years has passed since that, and now the empire has rised again. From
-> their mainbase at the planet Tyrus, they sent 20 big warships to crush the
-> alliance. They almost succeded; only Earth survived this strike. The empire
-> sent all thier power to destroy the opposition. But they failed, because of
-> the extreme defence of Earth. All thier troops sent there was destroyed.
-> 11 of the 20 warships is still existing and flying around and terror the
-> people. The Empire have sent for 20 new warships.
-> Now it's your turn again. Defeat the Empire before the reinforcments
arrive.
-> The whole world counts on you.

-> Does it sounds intresting?

-> Anyone wants screenshots or the half-ready code?

-> I'd like to have some thoughts and ideas about this game.
-> If anyone likes to help me with finishing it i would me more than happy to
-> send you a copy.


-> ---

-> Regards, Johannes Rydh

 Hey guys...

 You may all love amos, but stop living in your own worlds, I use AMOS because I can't use blitz. Blitz is faster, better, and superior in every way except its slightly harder to use.

 Its also FULLY AGA compatible and fully OS compatible.

 (Just a note).

Hi everyone, still there?
Im back at uni after a very unproductive summer, but hey someone has
to be a bum (tough job!)
I hope the list is still alive. 
One tiny question to keep you thinking...

In Amospro how do you enter arguments for something you want to
execute?
ie
CLI:    viewtek df0:mypicture.iff
AMP:    Exec "viewtek"   ?????????

I`ve tried Commandline$, adding text in the quotes, reading the manual
(no help!). Any ideas??

If anyone has any ideas can you send them to me here as I only
requested joining the list today, so I'm not on it yet.

Keep Amosing!!

For anyone who's interested, my web page now has one or two programs
to download from the projects page. Most of my projects are Amos based.
There's not too many to download yet, but I'm planning to get more
there "real soon now".

Meanwhile, you're welcome to see what I've got already. Browse to
     http://village.vossnet.co.uk/c/champion


And now the real reason I'm mentioning it again....

The page was listed on the Amiga Web Directory on the 30th September.
Before the link, my hit counter was at just over 200. In the week since
the link, it has shot up to over 1000.  I'm not a great fan of hit
counters, but nonetheless I'm quite impressed  :-)


See ya'll.

Please don't start.  I hate these pointless mails as much as everyone 
else does.  I can GUARATEE that, because of this message, I will get at 
least fifty mails with the title "Blitz sucks, Amos rules" or something 
like that.  If youall want to have a little skirmish, please do it 
elsewhere, like on IRC.  I don't need the extra mail..  Thanks.

That would be me. Three screen shots!

You can check out this game on AmiNet at:

Funny, they slag AMOS, then review an amos game. BTW, this was an unsolicited
review, as far as I am concerned.

>  Hey guys...

   Hello "sniper"...

   First, a question: IF you can't use Blitz, how do you know it is faster,
   better, and superior in every way except being slightly harder to use.
   Who told you this??


   Now, I don't know about the rest of the people on this list but, I 
   use BLITZ as much or more than I use AMOS. In fact, I have two
   projects in development in it right now.

   So, being that I am well-experienced in both languages, I think I
   can be reasonably objective. 

   Blitz does produce much faster code, it's graphic's routines are
   very fast (yes, faster than the power bobs extension based on the
   PB-demo I executed) and it does produce smaller, more optimized
   executables.

   I think it provides excellent support for true, professional software
   development.

   Personally, I don't see what's so hard about it. I converted a simple
   demo from AMOS to BLITZ, the same day I received BB...


   Anyway, AMOS is an incredibly accessable language. It allows a
   developer to quickly have something "up n' running" (BLITZ allows
   this too but, AMOS develop is even faster).

   A GOOD programmer can use AMOS and run rings around an
   average programmer using BLITZ.  Of course, if the GOOD 
   programmer were using BB, then he'd probably be running rings
   around Assembler programmer's...

   The point is, I use both as they seem so similiar to me and actually
   I enjoy AMOS programming just as much as BB programming as
   AMOS really pushes me.  In my SideShooter demo, I wouldn't
   think much of it to have it running at 50/60fps if I wrote it in BLITZ,
   but developing it in AMOS, I know that if I can obtain 50/60fps
   than I can feel that I have really accomplished something.
   
   Anyway, I could go on all day about development-issues, design
   theories and language comparisons but, I really don't have the time
   to write it all and most people don't have the time to read all my
   babbling so, in summary let me say this:

   Use AMOS, if you enjoy using AMOS. Don't blame AMOS for
   slow, bulky programs, blame yourself.

   If you want to use BLITZ, use it. It is also an excellent programming
   language. Hey, if you need some help let me know.

   So, use BB, don't tell people how great it is. If you really believe
   it is far superior then DEVELOP something in it that will PROVE
   beyond a shadow of a doubt that BB is FAR SUPERIOR.

   Until you have done that, it's best not to say such things...


   HEY AMOS-LIST GUYS:

   I know you are thinking, this Garfield never learns but, I felt I
   should speak out as I seem to be about the only person who
   actually uses both languages and feels that to like the one does
   not mean you hate the other...


      Take  care,
      GARFIELD

     I use Amos because I haven't the time to learn Blitz. (or anythign 
     else for that matter)  But I wouldn't knock Amos as it does everything 
     I want it to.

Well I'm sorta new to the Amos list.  Been lurking for a couple of weeks.
I used to program in AMOS alot.  I am a EE student and have seen assemble,
C, Java, pascal, ...  I can say that I am nowhere fluent in any of them
anymore.  I don't think I am as ood in AMOS as I was a few years ago
either.  

I quickly found the limitations of the language.  There was many things I
found could not be done in AMOS.  After my big Hd crash I did not
reinstall it.  I had a couple of nice games in developmetn using AMOS, but
with the code gone and thinking of restarting I truly am going to go with
a C.  AMOS is good, but far from perfect.  I can say that you can do a
whole lot more with it in a shorter amount of time and produce some good
programs.  It is not the language that needs to be tested it is the
programmer.  In other words, the programmer makes the difference.  If the
language does everything you need in a fast an efficient manner and you
program to your potetial then it truly doesn't matter what you program in.
You make the difference, release quality software using AMOS and it ill
get the respect it deserves, but mostly you will get your respect you
deserve.

If someone knocks on your programming language, instead of trash tlking
them, show them the power of your language, and rlease some good programs
to make them take notice.  They will shut up eventually or they will be
forgotten as they can't program anyway.

Just my two cents.

Nice  one m8. Hope sales go well for you. Any news on getting Amos Pro
though?  I  think  I sent a message to you before on this subject. Why
not  do  away  with a printed manual? On disk Amigaguide would suffice
most peeps if it keeps costs down.

I  know,  I know, you can't beat the printed manual though. I agree, I
couldn't  do  without  my Amos Pro manual at times, but new Amos users
would maybe be happy with on disk text.

I  don't  hold out much luck for you getting Europress to release Amos
Pro  though!  Well, maybe if the price is right. They would want a few
bucks though, that's for sure.

I  can't  remember the figure Steve Bye mentioned to me when he tried.
But it was far too much :(

Anyway,  wasn't there a rumour sometime back about Europress releasing
Amos Pro as PD or even the code for the language so peeps could update
it etc? Hmmmm....

cya ;)

-> In Amospro how do you enter arguments for something you want to
-> execute?
-> ie
-> CLI:    viewtek df0:mypicture.iff
-> AMP:    Exec "viewtek"   ?????????

Simple. Exec "Viewtek DF0:Pic"

-> I`ve tried Commandline$, adding text in the quotes, reading the manual
-> (no help!). Any ideas??

A$=Command Line$ : Rem First line of program

Exec A$
Exec "C:Viewtek "+a$
Print A$
Wait Key
End

Hope the above answers were the ones you were looking for!!

Yes. It appears while running in interpreted mode, and in the compiled
software. I've been getting around it by buying second hand Amigas
with KS3.0 ROMS in them but that's crazy because at the rate they fail,
(hard drives refusing to boot, video chips getting fried occasionally,
floppy drives getting stuffed by dust) we aren't going to be able to
sustain 
our system for too much longer. Tough luck for passengers, they'll just
have
to take pot luck to get to their train on time.

I am using AMAL to scroll screens up and down, and left and right. I am
also using the serial port functions. What I really need to know is what
hardware or firmware - specific code exists within AMOS, and then
I need to find out what is actually different between KS3.0 and KS3.1 so
I can track the problem down and maybe avoid it in future.

Unfortunately, I am legally unable to give you my code (as much as I
would
like to) because it belongs to Queensland Rail.

Yawn.... Im sick of these stoopid arguments.

The GUI extension offers just as much, if not more power, than the Blitz
side of things. I personally dont like blitz, but have used it in the past
to do small programs etc. and was even working with Paul Burkey to figure
out TCP in his Foundation game, when I met up with him for a weekend last
april.

All I say is each to their own, and the programmer can certainly improve
the speed of his/her programs thanks to extensions etc.

Figured we needed a "worthy" message posted on this list...


Mr. Giark,

Are you insane?  I just read the script for CBATNAM (which is
why I am obviously feeling a bit insane) and am thinking
WHO is going to do all that speech?  WHO is doing all those
animations??  Are we targeting CD-ROM???

Haha... the script was good reading though. You have a good sense
of humor (well, when you're not bashing me about that horrible
five-letter word)...


Anyway, if you need a voice for some of the bad-guys or
whatever, let me know and I'll be glad to record some of the 
speech-clips.

I'm sure it will come across a bit better if we actually use
different people for the different voices rather than you trying to
change your own voice for each part... :-)


Speaking of speech, KEITH, do you need any speech-samples? 
I know you had a few ideas a month back or so. If you still need
them or want some new ones then just let me know.

Actually, I'm feeling very generous so, if anyone needs some
speech for their games or whatever, just send me a list and I'll
see what I can do (I'm not guaranteeing anything)...


There was something else I was curious about but, can't seem
to remember what it was... hmmm... oh yes, of course...
ADAM, how is that wicked 3d-rendering engine and stage
of your's coming along?

I know you have probably been asked a dozen times during
my "absence" so, I apologize for asking you again (if you didn't
have to stop and reply to these messages, you probably could
have finished it long ago, right? )


Also, I haven't received any feed-back on the latest SideShooter
demo... does that mean that no one has tried it?

I am particularly interested in hearing from those people using
unaccelerated A500s and such who thought the previous demos
were so sloooooooooow...


   Take  care,
   GARFIELD

I took a look at Amosteroids and the asteroids' bob images and AMAL code
are definately useable with minor changes.

Would it be alright to use these?  I mean, someone called P. J. Hickman
has their name to them.  Does anyone know this person?

Nonsense. CBATNAM has cd32 text input support. You can also find my cd32
procedures that do all cd32pad stuff. I think Mush has it.

That, Andy, is the hard way. I do wish people would stop pushing that version.
It grabs a lot of variable space na dis not the easiest to figure out at
times. I'll send my set of procedures to you soon so you can put them on your

Pete has a `tame artist' that he has tied to a touchtablet and is forcing to

We need a finished game before we target anything.

Bashing you about a five letter word? I'm lost now.

Like I said, they are done already. Pete or Mush suggested listening to the
samples while you read the script. I must admit, Shawna still cracks me up
everytime.

"Help me, Cap'n Bubba"

"Ah, my beloved Shawna!"

Listen to the samples first.

   Most of these games aren't written in AMIGA-mode (the OS-compatible
   side) but, are using the Display libraries in BLITZ mode.

   You will have problems with any PAL-only games regardless of the
   language. I have seen MANY AMOS, BLITZ as well as Assembler
   games/demos which either have garbled NTSC-displays, important
   data displayed off the visible screen, lock-ups due to the slightly
   faster NTSC video-synch, etc.  This was a common problem with
   commercial (most in Assembler I assume) games a few years back.
   I don't know how many times I had garbled screens or lock-ups.


   The solution I came up with is simple: Simply Boot your Amiga in
   PAL-mode then run the game/demo and it will work fine. Even now,
   I simply expect most games will require PAL-mode and don't even
   attempt to use them in NTSC.


   This is a real problem though and I hope more authors will cater to
   both PAL and NTSC users. It's very simple to add this kind of support
   and it makes it SO much easier on the end-user...

   For instance, the SideShooter demo automatically resizes the display 
   depending on whether you're using a PAL or NTSC Amiga. Of course,
   I'll probably have to change it for the final release as I believe we
   are suppose to be using a fixed-size display 234 pixels high
   (Mr. Giark?).


      Take  care,
      GARFIELD

I think your wrong about one thing here, the graphic routines in BLITZ
are SLOWER than the ones in AMOS. Dont get me wrong the complied code
is far faster then AMOS (this is what courses the speed difference).

I would just like to put in my 2 pence worth, I know people are going
to get peed off with the argument but this is what you get for 
mentioning BLITZ on the AMOS List :)

The main reason most people dislike BLITZ when converting (or trying to)
from AMOS is that its a big drop in the interface and how the system 
works compared to AMOS.

AMOS in itself has everything up and running ready for the user to get
straight into testing his (rarely her) programming, where as BLITZ needs
you doto this for it. Most people think this system is shyte but I 
put it this way, it gives you more freedom of what you want to archive.

AMOS`s interface and system is alot more friendly making it ideal for
the beginner. With it having a Montior and Direct mode, BLITZ`s 
debugger doesnt come near. Although its debugger is more of a ASM 
monitor.

At least BLITZ it still being worked on (Red When Excited) and theres 
even a rumor of BLITZ 3. This is another point which makes BLITZ more
of a choice than AMOS. I know people are still producing extensions and
I say `go for it`, this will make AMOS go as far as it can but this 
itself still cant compete with BLITZ`s producers. Unless someone wants
to make a AMOSPro Plus or sumot :)

Dont get me wrong I love AMOS and still program in it even if its just
for testing purposes(I wouldnt be on the list otherwise). BLITZ doesnt
come near to the ease of use and the time it takes to do the job. And
anyone who says converting code from one to the other is hard is
nonsence. I do it all the time, testing code in AMOS and then converting
it BLITZ for the speed.

So my final conclusion is that it all depends on what you want to 
program and archive. Anybody saying `so-and-so language is crap` or
`that proggy is crap because it was programmed in so-and-so` is 
aload of crap in itself. Every proggy made on this great machine all
depends on the programmer. Anyone can make a great proggy in what ever
language they are com with.

I had the same problem a few months ago. It seems you are better off
using the full path for executing. Like :

  Exec "c:ViewTek Work:pics/test.iff"

I've been a bit distracted lately, but I found a short example
that might be useful as an example. I have not seen any other
responses, but if you already have the hang of HUNTing, just
smack the old delete button.

The following code strips out the less than usefull elements
of an 8SVX file, correcting several common problems in the
process, and rewrites it. The PSVX routine uses HUNT to locate
the header and body chunks of the just processed file to play
it. Note that the PSVX routine knows it has been passed a
bank with a good iff 8svx form, so it doesn't error check.

Hope this helps, (or at least doesnt get in your way)

Correct. The menu program (have you looked at it?) detects your amiga type,
processor type, etc. and sets variables accordingly. It should work on any
amiga, though it will need at least 1Meg CHIP and 1Meg FAST to run properly.

The speech is done and is on the page.

Pete has a `tame artist' that he has tied to a touchtablet and is forcing to
go without food until the anims are done.

We need a finished game before we target anything.

Bashing you about a five letter word? I'm lost now.

Like I said, they are done already. Pete or Mush suggested listening to the
samples while you read the script. I must admit, Shawna still cracks me up
everytime.

"Ah, my beloved Shawna!"

Listen to the samples first.

Hmmmm....

Sounds to me like a good candidate for splitting into seperate screens.
I don't know what options you're trying to set up, but isn't there a
logical way to split them up, so that each set of options is available
from the main screen or window via a button?

If you've got so many options on screen that they look cramped at 640x512
and with the smallest type face, they'd surely be better off seperated
out a little.

To answer your actual question, 640x512 is standard PAL Hires-Laced. You
might get a little more with overscan.  But in all honesty, if you're
looking at a screen that size on a TV, using a 5-point font, you'll get
major eyestrain.


That's all....

      Yes, I had a look at the excellent menu executable. It's a very nice
      piece of work...

      I realize that I need to access the Config file to extract the user's
      desired configuration, but they can still center that 234-pixel box
      and I can use that data to center my variable-size displays. 

      I'm currently using a 225-pixel display for NTSC users and a
      265-pixel display for PAL-users, which is why NTSC-mode has a
      greater amount of vertical-scrolling compared to the tiny vertical
      scroll area on PAL-machines.

      The reason I'm using 225-pixels for the NTSC display is because I
      know for a fact that some televisions can only display 225 lines in
      NTSC.  My brother's television is one of them...

      Anyway, this really shouldn't matter as I will center everything
      based around the data the user has stored in the Config file, which 
      means everything should work out fine in the end, correct?


         Take  care,

   Yes, I've just downloaded the archive and listened to the samples...

      Yes, I know you want this project completed as soon as possible.

      Anyway, I just thought it was kind of interesting to see that the
      final project (WHEN COMPLETED) will probably be well over 5MB...

   Well, I've ported the samples (all 2MB) over to my Amiga... You did a
   great job.  They sound very unique as game-sounds go, sort of
   cartoon-inspired...

I don't program in Blitz, so I can only judge it by the games I've seen,
but I think that I may have seen one RPG that could have run in NTSC, but
it popped up a requestor saying something like the screen not the right
size, and then quit.

I have not seen any such problems in PAL Amos games, and if programers
would just let users adjust the SCREEN DISPLAY command their would be
no problems at all.

Thats not an option for a real gamer I play on my 35" SVHS TV.

Nice  one m8. Hope sales go well for you. Any news on getting Amos Pro
though?  I  think  I sent a message to you before on this subject. Why
not  do  away  with a printed manual? On disk Amigaguide would suffice
most peeps if it keeps costs down.

I  know,  I know, you can't beat the printed manual though. I agree, I
couldn't  do  without  my Amos Pro manual at times, but new Amos users
would maybe be happy with on disk text.

I  don't  hold out much luck for you getting Europress to release Amos
Pro  though!  Well, maybe if the price is right. They would want a few
bucks though, that's for sure.

I  can't  remember the figure Steve Bye mentioned to me when he tried.
But it was far too much :(

Anyway,  wasn't there a rumour sometime back about Europress releasing
Amos Pro as PD or even the code for the language so peeps could update
it etc? Hmmmm....

cya ;)

   The problem is these things are all subjective. The code-processing can
   be MUCH faster or a bit faster depending on your variable-types.

   In case I gave the wrong impression, let me clarify. Some gfx-commands
   are VERY close to AMOS's speed while others (like "bobs" or blits
   actually) are much faster.

   Yes, I like both languages, but even I am growing tired of all the
   discussion.  I do have a solution for this whole thing (see below).

[SNIP] - I agree with MUCH of what you said...

   I AGREE COMPLETELY!!!  


   Now, I think this whole debate can be resolved by simply referring
   any one who posts BLITZ vs AMOS messages to my webpages,
   which I hope to have up this weekend.

   I will set up an area with just this topic in mind.  There will be a
   demo written in both languages which you can simply download
   and then compare the two first-hand.

   Also, IF any one on this list has some interest in learning BLITZ then
   just write me personally (or visit my webpage) and I'll give you a hand
   converting code from AMOS.

   It's not that I want to convert PEOPLE over from AMOS, rather that I
   think people should have the chance to fairly judge the "other"
   language, BUT the place to do that is NOT here...

   Case closed!!  I'll post a message when I have the webpage ready...


      Take care,
      GARFIELD

   Well, that's just the programmer taking the easy way out.  Too bad
   really as obviously he was half-way there. Apparently, what happens
   is most of these programmers design everything based on the PAL-
   display and it's all hard-coded in so, resizing everything for NTSC
   (which would be necessary for an OS-programmed game or
   whatever, unless they opened a scrollable screen) would be too much
   trouble...


> I have not seen any such problems in PAL Amos games,

   Fair enough... I've seen games with garbled displays both because of
   NTSC-mode as well as running on an AGA-machine... BUT, I know
   this is not AMOS's fault as I have seen the same thing with
   games written in other languages.


> and if programmers would just let users adjust the SCREEN DISPLAY
> command their would be no problems at all.

   Well, I agree... I'd say if they would just do anything to support NTSC
   (and we try to fully utilize PAL as well), it would be a BIG step in the
   right direction. Certainly a bit more acceptable than just quitting the
   program...

      Personally, I've never given it any thought, but that's probably due
      to the fact that I never realized monitors caused hemorrhoids!!

Hi,
To all who tried to help me with my Exec problem, thanks. I tried
everything but to no avail, so maybe its my version of AP or my amiga
or something. Anyway it was only a curiosity thing so I'm not too
worried!

Keep Amosing!

I'm guessing that we need to make a final list of variables so that everyone
can access them.

That's only 6 disks or so. I can think of a lot of games that have been at
least that many and weren't nearly as humourly incredible as CBATNAM will be.

This concern is addressed in CBATNAM. I know, I already said it, but it needs
to be said again. CBATNAM will be the most unique AMOS game ever created, both
due to the fact of it being a good game and due to the international
programming team writng it.

To the programming team:
Deadline for your next demo (final demo?) in four days!

To the betatesters:
Get on it!

Hehe, ill be releasing prices for the compiler tomorrow, and i can assure you
i am cheaper than anywhere else. What I mean by demo, is send me any kind of
archives for the game you want to be available for anyone to download and have
a look at. Just email them to me directly.

-> Do you want the code for it?

I could put the code in the library and see if anyone else would like to

If spacewars 1 was written in AMOS, then yes, I would like to have it.

I now have the AMOSPro compiler in stock. The price for it will be 12 UK
pounds *without* the postage costs. I know the postage in certain countries
is more than other, so if you would still like to order it, please tell me
the currency and country, so I can work out an exact cost.

When sending cheques, I would prefer in UK and US dollars only, otherwise
cash value in your own currency. If sending cash, you do so at your own
risk. Please contact me if you would still like the compiler.

   I believe the final CB-project will speak loud and clear "AMOS is
   capable of far more than it's credited for!!".  Naturally AMOS won't
   receive all of the credit, some should go to the actual developers...

   The simple fact is, based on what is currently available on the 
   WebPage, I think the CB-project will easily be the most-impressive
   game ever developed in AMOS.  That's not to say that people aren't
   currently working on "better" projects, just that compared to the
   AMOS-developed games currently available, none compare to this
   CB-project or at least I've never seen these other AMOS-games, if they
   are better.

   Don't take this the wrong way.  I think a BIG, focused project like a
   Warcraft/C&C/X-COM/Warlords/Diablo-inspired game would draw far
   more interest, INITIALLY...

   But, it's not just the game-styles that are important, it's the
   EXECUTION of the game-style.  Anyone can sit down and make a
   very involved, BIG game, but what's the point if it "feels" like you're
   moving in slow-motion and the whole thing seems very sloppily
   programmed?  

   CBATNAM will be a good-sized game (over 5MB) when complete
   and will have all the elements of a great game:  Good playability,
   good audio/video feed-back, a "fun" storyline that will be depicted
   through "cinemas" and five seperate game-styles for the ultimate in
   variety, all slickly programmed as well.

   So, let people try CBATNAM and compare it to other games,
   particularly games developed in AMOS, and then we'll see if they
   aren't just a tiny bit impressed with the language and wondering why
   nobody has ever made such an impressive AMOS game before...



      Take  care,
      GARFIELD

INTRODUCTION
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    Welcome, to the October issue of the Mushroom PD report. This issue
see's the introduction of several new features, including the methods in
which this mail is sent to you. Previously in the past, if the list
contained any bad email address' the entire message would be returned to
some of the list members, which also meant the receiving of a large BCC:
list which was not only inconvinient, but took some time to download.
Having written and released a program called "MPDMailpost" which I uploaded
to my own library, as well as Aminet in comm/mail, which will send the same
email to everyone in a large list of mailing address' and uses a fully
customizable GUI interface (Thanks to the GUI Extension). This Mushroom PD
list now boasts almost 300 individual members.

    I would also like to apologize for the extreme delay since the last of
these messages. I was experiencing extreme hard drive problems, in which I
lost all of my partitions, and subsequently, the whole PD library. After
using lots of different methods, I was able to recover everything except my
Workbench partition, and I am still trying to put bits and pieces back into
it to make it work like it used to.

ANNOUNCEMENT
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    If you had read the last report which was released, you will know that
I had placed an order in to start selling the AMOSPro Compiler from my
homepages. That order has now arrived, in the form of 10 copies (5 of which
have already been reserved) which are now on sale.

    The package comes with a printed manual, the Compiler disk itself, an
updater disk (to make your version 2.00 if it already isnt) and an extra's
disk with examples etc. I also have included an extra disk with more
goodies on it. The package costs 12 UK pounds *before* the postage has been
added on to it, as with the various costs for international postage, this
will be added onto the overall cost.

    If you are interested in getting hold of the compiler, then drop me a
line at mushypd@redrose.net and reserve your copy now. You should also let
me know what currency you use, and what country you are in so I can work
out an exact price for you. Any compiler orders placed on hold will remain
so for 2 weeks, unless otherwise notified.

    In the next few weeks, I have been told there is a slim chance that I
can get hold of AMOSPro itself, so please keep in tune for these developing
news as they arrive!!

AGA REPORT
-=-=-=-=-=-

    Everyone knows that AGA in AMOS is currently not available directly.
This section will hopefully tell and show you how you can acheive it, and
the various extensions which you can use to get there. Lets start with a
small piece of info on the history of AGA AMOS.

    The first AGA graphics to be incorporated into any AMOS listings, were
simple hacks which altered values in the copper, to give the impression of
an AGA screen. The only back-draw to this method, was you couldnt really
display any AGA graphics, but you could display an AGA copper in the
background only.

    There were a couple of attempts at an AGA extension, and the ones which
were released were not very good at all, as all they really could do, was
display AGA pictures by reducing their palettes etc. There wasnt a single
extension at this time, which could claim to be a true AGA extension.

    Then came along the GUI extension. It is written by Pietro Ghizzoni and
is the first, easily manipulable extension that not only offers the best OS
application programming for AMOSPro - but will also let you program AGA
graphics for the very first time in the history of AMOS. Here is a note
from Pietro himself on the subject of AGA and the GUI extension:
On 29-Set-97, Mush wrote: GUI Extension

"Well... what i acheived with the GUI Extension is the first real AGA
support, no Copper hacks and so on. Due to its total OS respect the GUI
Extension can obtain the best from the system.. this mean it supports
AGA, Graphics Card, Advanced Screen Mode like the HighGfx modes. Now a
CyberGFX 24bit screen with 16M of colours can be easly handled in Amos.

Most of the GUI gfx commands are faster than the Amos equivalent, so you
can create cool and fast WB application. 

The GUI Extension v1.63 is the first approach to AGA. Now the phase 1 is
completed... i've a full working AGA enviroment for the GUI Ext... the next
phase is the 'Power Up'... a lots of new gfx commands and facilities for a
advanced AGA use.

What i hope to acheive with the GUI Ext in the future:

- Amos Screen promotion.... display a Amos screen in the WB

- a new fast animation system. Since the AGA introduce some High definition
screenmode, we need a powerfull animation system for creating a fast and
smooth animation... this mean XFA (eXtra Fast Animation) support. Actually
only some commercial softwares supports this standard... but in the near
future the Amos users will can use it too!

- extended TCP/IP commands set for a faster access

- other cool GUI stuff: drag'n'drop, iconify (MUI like), and other 100.000
ideas in my head ;) "


    At this time, there are 2 other extensions underway which will try and
bring AGA into AMOS. The longest in the works has been the JADE extension,
which has been subject to many rumours saying that it will not be released.
The original programmers claimed several months ago that they were writing
an AGA extension, before a long long period of silence. All we have seen of
their extension so far, is a list of commands which they wish to include,
and more recently an advert to the AMOS mailing list requesting beta
testers when a test version is released. Noone has submitted to me any kind
of demo, even though they claim the extension is just being debugged, and
the main part is completed.

    The other AGA extension being written, will be called the Game
extension, written by Peter Cahill. I have seen one example of this
extension, and from what I have seen, it will look very nice when it is
completed. Peter did send me a small file of what he hopes to include in
the extension, but I have misplaced it at this time  =(

    The GUI Extension is available both from Aminet in dev/amos and from my
PD library, and whats more, it is freeware, which means there are
absolutely no restrictions whatsoever.

PREVIEW
-=-=-=-=

    There is a new AMOS game in the works, called Captain Bubba and the
Nasty alien Menace. Its a world-wide effort being the first international
game to really come out from AMOS. There will be several different kind of
games merged into the one large game, with levels such as a tekken-type
fight, a raycaster, an excellent blood money-type level, plus a few others
which I wont spoil for you just yet!

    There are approximately 12-15 programmers (including myself) working on
the project, and we are hoping to have it finished in time for christmas.
The joint effort will be available to purchase exclusively from my
homepages at www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk and as the release date gets nearer,
I will let you know.

FREE FTP SPACE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    Are you an AMOS programmer who would like a small amount of FTP space
for storing your games, and information on other AMOS projects etc. but
dont have the space that you'd like? If you would like some space, then
contact me at mushypd@redrose.net where I will be happy to send you
information on how you can get some on my site for free. This only applies
to AMOS programmers.

Yep, i'll try to do a demo.
But it's problem with coding it. You see, i started to work with this project about an year ago, but then i stopped. At that time, I wasn't very good at programming. When i am programming now, it sometimes gets really messy. Concidering to completely re-write the whole game.

OK. First i'll try to come up with a version that can be programmed good, if you got what i mean. Without any mess...

It is written in AMOS.
I'll send you it in a private letter later.

What selector do you mean???

Are you using 1.3, 2.x or 3.x??? Amos Pro V1 or 2 etc.

Anyway,  try  this out, it might just be what you're looking for. It's
worked  fine  for  me  everytime. So I hope you have no probs. (It may
require Kick2.x)

BTW Check the VT dox and make sure you have all LIBS etc present :)

onwards....

Save  the  above  to disk as something like FILE.asc and use the Merge

m8, just trying to help... ;^)

Yyou  could  maybe  add some kind of loop with a Multi Wait command so
that  all  processor time is given back to the system when in WB. This
should  make  VT  run smoother also. And one more thing, try opening a
CLI  window  and  printing  some  text  to it to tell peeps that VT is
loading a piccy etc.

Use  Easylife  for Iconify or Amcaf, GUI Etx's etc for other great CLI
commands.

Lemme know how you get on also.

ttfn, Andy Gibson.

 I have a large dilema.

 Is there like a preset way, or an easy way of having a sprite land on a platform (I tried collision detection, but because the sprite moved 4  pixels at a time, it often ended up in the platform up to its knees)..

 The reason I ask it, I can't seem to make a decent platform game, I've made strategies (Command Until Crushed (10 meg)), but this is IMPOSSIBLE... All I want is a simple (very simple) game like Qwak (or Bubble Bobble).

 With 32 colour gfx :)

 Oh yeah, is there a channel where I can talk to you guys realtime? Instead of mailing?

Why don't you have a look at Dithell's Wonderland that came on the 
Productivity disk with AMOS Pro (if you have it). It's an *excellent* 
platformer and should be easy to follow along. If you don't have it, 
I'm sure I could email it to you.
 
> Oh yeah, is there a channel where I can talk to you guys realtime? 
Why, sure. Jump on IRC, and look for us on #AMOS. I know that I (as 
well as Mush, Giark, and most of the other Listers) use and IRCNet 
server (irc.stealth.net, irc.webbernet.net, irc.netcom.co.uk, etc.)

He has an email account at andy@ajco.demon.co.uk (this what what I was

concentrates more on his story writing and such.

Exec A$+Chr$(32)+B$+Chr$(10)+Chr$(0)

You  may  not  need Chr$(10), but Chr$(0) should maybe be there at the
end to NULL terminate the file. Try it different ways.

I tried this using my Viewtrek but its didnt worked! hmm still that
stupid file selector was coming up..

Then i tried viewing jpgs with fast jpg and then it worked. I think
it must be the viewtrek program that dont want 2 understand the exec 
line!

 Anybody who can help.. Please do. I need to save out the sound of the Amos Pro speech thing as a standard IFF or Raw sample for a song I'm making. Its not for a game or anything, i just like its robotic speech and want to make Amos save it out as a sample.
 
 Could  somebody give me the lines of code I would need (if its possible).. Thanks.

#Hi there. This is the usual Mushroom PD letter sent out every so often,    #

Mushroom PD is becomming an official distributor for F1 licenseware, owned
by Phil Wilkinson, also of 5th dimension licenseware. I will be signing the
contract any day now, and will begin selling titles before the month is
over. This will benefit my AMOS PD library tremendously, as a lot of the
titles in F1 are written in AMOS, and they offer some great extensions,
games and utilities, and I hope I can steer him towards recruiting new AMOS
programmers.

If you have any questions whatsoever, please feel free to email me at
mushypd@redrose.net and I will get to your question as soon as possible.

     A couple of questions....
     
     i) Is there an Amos extension that supports Midi?
     
     ii) Has anyone on the list written any Midi routines using Amos?
     
     iii) Where can I get some technical documentation on how to address    
          Midi hardware?
     
     Thanks.

Content-description: Mail message body

Greetings.

Well, I think I have a functioning demo to send to Giark for the List 
game (using John Bintz's old raycasting routine). I didn't want to 
have to use his, (I would prefer to use mine) but it was the only one 
I could work out on such short notice. I would have (and will be) 
using mine in the future as soon as I get it worked out (I've had 
a problem with the distance), but until then, this will have to do.

Attached is MY routine thus far (not the demo for the List game, 
but my raycasting routine, with the ASCII tables needed to run it, 
which, btw, are not converted to banks yet). I'm sending it to the 
List in the hopes that someone will be able to help me figure out 
exactly what's wrong with it. I've seriously considered re-writing it 
and starting over after I finish up my current demo.

Anyhow, anyone may look at it and modify it as they wish (so long 
as to make it work), and then send it what they've done/modified.
You may NOT spread it around, except for the purpose of letting 
someone else see and/or correct-modify it.

I would have refrained from sending this TO the List, but I figured 
this way EVERYONE can see it, which would mean more people could help 
me than the the 3 I originally asked (Two of which will remain 
nameless at this time, and the third which DID help me (Mush) via 
e-mail and IRC. Thanks Mush.) I don't want to hear any complaining 
either. This files NO BIGGER than 6k, and w/the message, it's nothing 
to whine about, especially considering it's worth it.

Again, I'm thankful for ANY (but please useful) help anyone can give 
me. Mail me if you have any questions (even though I've documented 
just about everything, so there shouldn't be any problems.) The .lha 
has been UUencoded for your convience. If you can't open it (or it's 
corrupt), just mail me and I'll send it again encoded differently.

errr... yeah...

Well I think we all know that that statement is bollocks.
If it were true, somehow I think we'd all be using Blitz.

Blitz is slightly more powerful but much harder to use and full of all
sorts of annoying things.
AMOS isn't perfect but its more perfect than Blitz and its god awful
editing environment.

I'm afraid that while I'm very happy about all this team work and progress
on the Bubba game, I'm not so sure about the statement that it is the most
unique AMOS game ever.
I haven't taken any offense and please don't either but I feel that I (and
many others too) have created a fair few unique AMOS games of our own.
I believe that they are good, and they are (and have been) created with the
help of various people around the world too.
Also adding the fact that they have been a bit more original and not just
recreated simple games that we've seen hundreds of times in slightly different
guises and you might understand why I think that you are maybe blowing it's
horn a bit too much.
It may turn out to be a great game and all but I don't think that telling people
its made in AMOS will make them think that AMOS is actually really good.
I'd find it more likely they'd think that AMOS is only just good enough to
create a whole load of very old and simple games rather than just being
plain rubbish, which of course, we all know better.

Having said that, I still hope it does become the great game that it is being
trumpeted as.

 HI ALL...

 I recently offered people some gfx, but only a few took, and some didn't send me the info I asked for (so they didn't get jack)... So, I'll offer something most people don't deny...

 FREE MUSIC. CREATED 3-4 and OVER 8 CHANNEl (Octamed Sound Studio) for you
games. I can supply it in Protracker, AMOS, MED and OSS.

 I would  however, like to know what type of game it is, what type of music you want, and etc.

 P.S: Alister.. Banana Islands got me craving RAINBOW ISLANDS SO BAD... ITS COOL (if slightly slow).

Hello.

My name is Morten Bolstad.

I haven't been online in quite some time, but now i have a little Amos
problem that i hope some of you can help me with:

When i print the first page of text it all look's fine, but when i print the
second page with text i have to use screen copy to get a fresh background
without page 1 on it.
That doesent look very good when you change page, so my question is:

Is there another way to do it so i can  fade the text on page one away and
print the next page without affecting the GFX in the background in any way?

The background has 5-10 colours and the colour used on the text isent used
in the background.
The screen is 16 colour Hires.

To make it short: i need a way to make text disapear smooth (fade) over a
background with many colours.

I hope there is someone that that can help me with this anoying problem.


Morten Bolstad.

On 14-Oct-97, mat@cu-amiga.co.uk scribbled:

Attention please, this is a very important annoucement.

CU Amiga Magazine, the world's best Amiga Magazine, is looking to recruit a
Staff Writer. The key responsibility will involve writing well-informed
and authoratative copy designed to inform and excite Amiga enthusiasts
world wide.

The successful applicant would need to be an Amiga god, greatly familiar
with the platform on a technical footing. Addition specific interests and
expertise in software genres such as 3D rendering, DTP, programming and
business packages would be required (though not necessarily those specific
genres). Knowledge of the major players in the Amiga scene both in hardware
and software is essential.

Experience in journalism is not essential but is highly prized. Certainly
potential candidates should be fluent with English structure and grammar
and be able to maintain a clear easy to understand train of thought.
Other skills that would be highly prized include the ability to compile
coverdisks and knowledge of HTML to help maintain the CU Online web site.

If you fancy turning your hobby into a career then send your CV and
a 500 word review of your favourite piece of Amiga equipment
to the Editor;

That's my job
CU Amiga Magazine

Hi, I`m new to this list and I thought I`d introduce myself.

I`m Mark Harman, and I`m looking for article writers for my diskmag
DoubleClick (DC). Just email me if you`re interested, or if you have
anything you want to contribute, then just send it to me.

DC is freeware, and covers mainly Amiga computing, although we except
articles of a more general nature.

Hope to hear from lots of you,

Mark

For the betatesters, a compiled version. For other IAPA members who can help
with optimization, AMOS script.

They will all go into one large executable. That's why the code for your level
should be 50k or under.

Well met and godspeed,

     I will try to explain this the best I can so bear with me
     
     I am trying to copy a memory block of 256 bytes from one address to 
     another using the following line of code which is causing my system to 
     crash.
     
     Copy Start(SBNK)+Val(SVCE$(SMZ)),Start(SBNK)+Val(SVCE$(SMZ))+256 to 
     Start(20)
     
     where SBNK is either 10 or 11 and SMZ ranges from 1 to 128
     
     At one stage when I ran the program where SBNK is 10 and SMZ is 1 I 
     got the following values
     
     Copy 1225400,1225656 to Start(20)
     
     The same line of code in direct mode does not crash and works fine but 
     when run through my program it crashes.
     
     I went stepped through everything to verify that I was getting valid 
     values for both SBNK and SMZ and every time they were valid.
     
     Can anyone see any obvious errors with my code or approach.  Any help 
     or advice would be appreciated.
     
     
     Declan.

The man most directly responsible for this twaddle was Joseph Hewitt, who did

No, its not possible at all to have it open on an AMOS screen. This would
meean a complete rewrite of the filerequester module which comes with AMOSPro.

Uhh, this is a bit of a long-shot, but try to calculate the val's outside
of the command.. (something like: wa=val(svce$(n)) and then use the variable
in the copy command, don't know why it happens, but by putting a break down
after the 'val' you can at least see what part goes wrong (I'm suspecting 
the VAL very much as the Copy command never gives me any problems at all).

Here's a few check-points for your help, but you proberly know them..

.. 'Copy' MUST use EVEN adresses, be very sure about this !!!
.. 'VAL' sometimes screws up when encountering strange char's, so make sure
   that the string starts right out with a valid number. Also be sure that
   the number is terminated by either a 'normal' char (A-Z,a-z) or space or
   the end of the string..
.. Have you tried to enter the numbers directly in the copy command ??

NB: The EVEN adresses on Copy should only apply to 68000->68020 CPU's, 
    newer ones SHOULD be able to cope with uneven (Havn't tried it)..

Don't really now, but you could try playing it to tape, and then sampling
the tape.  Please use the return key when you are typing.

Hello!

My name is Morten Bolstad and right now i'am working on a brand new Scene
DiscMag called "Retro", but i have reached a stage in the code that
leave's me with 3 Major problems, so i hope there are some cool guy's that
will bother to help me!


1. I have tryed for days to get the Text view'er i have included as an
   attachment to Unscramble the text with the Mem unscramble command from
   the Craft Extension without any luck.

   So maybee one of you can include it to the text Source for me, so it
   unscrables the text file before it is view'ed.
   I have included a smaal text file witch is scrambled with the Mem scramble
   command, so you can check if it works. The code for unscrambling the file
   is AMOS


2. When page one of the text is printed over the background, i have to use
   Screen copy to clear the text, before i can print the next page of text.
   This doesent look very nice at all when you change page, so i am wondeing
   if there is another way to do this without affecting the background,
   that is more smooth, like a fade or something??

   If you also helped me with the first question, and want to help me with
   this to, you will find the Screen copy that needs to be changed with
   something bether around line 7 in the DisplayPage Procedure.
   Maybee you could include this to into the text rutine.


3. This question doesen't have anything to do with the Text rutine as the 2
   questions before, but it's something i need for the Diskmag.

   I use the Text command to print the Main menu over the background and i
   use Set zone and Mouse Zone to define zones around the diffrent article
   names, so you can select a artlicle by clicking on the article name.

   I need a way to change the colour on the text that is inside a
   zone when the mouse comes over it.
   Lets say that the colour on the article names is gray.
   When the mouse pointer comes inside the zone to article name one,
   i want the colour on article name one to change to white without changing
   the colour on the other article names, and when the mouse pointer moves
   back out of the zone the colour is changed back to Gray.
   Is there a Way to do this??


4. I haven't been Online all summer becos of various reasons, but i dident
   close my accaunt, so when i grabed my E-Mail's last weekend there were
   over 1300 mails from this list and a couple of other i am Subscribed to.
   So i only bothered to read a few of them, but i am a bit confused abouth
   the AGA situation for AMOS.
   I read something abouth a AGA extension called JADE and a Game Extension
   witch would handle AGA.
   So i am wondering, what is the latest news abouth AGA for Amos, Are Jade
   out or some other AGA extension???
   Also, will i finally be able to use 32 or 64 colours in Hires on my
   Music Disk and DiskMag???


Ok, i really hope there is some cool Amos coder's on this list that can help
me.
If you only can help me with one or two of the questions i'am happy to hear
from you aswell, all help is good help.

I know it maybee a bit much to ask, but i would be really grait if the one
that desides to help me can finnish by Wednesday, so i can reach the deadline.

Those who help me with question 1-3 will ofcos get credit for their work in
every issue we use the code in, and i can personally E-Mail it to you as soon
as it is finnished if you want me to.

By helping me you will also help the Amiga Scene to get a new production
And you will feel grait too!

So come on!!
