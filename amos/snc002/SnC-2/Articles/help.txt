This  brand new menu has a dump load of features which can be controlled via the
buttons  on the control panel situated at the top of this screen.  Also the same
functions  can  be  performed  by  a  simple key press.  Some functions are only
available from the keyboard but these are the less important.

The  control  panel  has  13 buttons as you can see by looking at the top of the
screen.  These have an obvious function as it is printed on the button!

INDEX       - Brings back the main listing for the disk.
LINE UP     - Move the text up one line if it's not at the top.
UP A PAGE   - Skips up by a whole page of the text file.
TOP         - Jumps to the top, or first page of the text files.
COLOUR      - Cycles through a selection of colour palettes.
FONT        - Cycles through 4 fonts to view the text file in.
HELP        - Calls up this page.
LINE DOWN   - Move the text down one line unless it's at the bottom.
DOWN A PAGE - Skips down the text file to the next page.
MUSIC       - Toggle switch to pause the current music module being played.
BOTTOM      - Jumps to the end of the text file.
POINTER     - Cycles through various pointers available.
PRINT       - Dumps the current text file being viewed to the printer.


Most  of  the  keyboard  shortcuts  are  linked to the function they perform.  A
overall summary is listed below:-


                              KEY * FUNCTION

                                I - INDEX
                         Up Arrow - LINE UP
                   Shift+Up Arrow - PAGE UP
                                T - TOP
                                C - COLOUR
                                F - FONT
                             HELP - This page!
                       Down Arrow - LINE DOWN
                 Shift+Down Arrow - PAGE DOWN
                                M - MUSIC
                                B - BOTTOM
                              TAB - POINTER
                                P - PRINT

Option only available via the keyboard are as follows:-


       F1 - Toggle PAL / NTSC screen mode, useful for you foreign dudes.

                             F10 - Quit back to DOS


Sometime  in  the future I'll be putting in a detection routine so that the menu
will  start up in the correct screen mode depending on the frequency.  However I
can't test this as I don't know anybody with an NTSC machine.

From  the  menu  index you may also change the tune by selecting the extra tune.
The  you  can  change  back,  just  click  on  the  line which has the title and
composers name!
