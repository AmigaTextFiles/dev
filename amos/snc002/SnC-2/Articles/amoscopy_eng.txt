Needed:          One external drive ( DF1: )

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General:         AMOSCopy V1.0a is a diskcopyprogram !
                 But also you can format and checking your disks !

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calling:         AMOSCopy V1.0a could started from CLI,
                 or by using its icon from Workbench !

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOURCE &         To set the SOURCE- and TARGET-drive
TARGET:          you only have to choose the disksymbol on the left !
                 `0` means DF0: `1` means DF1: !

UPPER SIDE &     Every track by a disk will be presented as a box !
LOWER SIDE:      Only tracks they are selected will be work !
                 To set a track on or off you must select it with the mouse !
                 Follow options helps by setting the tracks...
                 ON:      This diskside can be worked !
                 OFF:     This diskside can`t be worked !
                 REVERSE: Inverse all tracks ( on=off  off=on ) !
                 DEFAULT: Set the default-settings !

START:           Starts the selected option !

ABORT:           Quits a working prozess !

VERIFY ON/OFF:   If VERIFY ON, then the worked track of TARGET drive
                 will be tested if there is an error (look CHECK).
                 If VERIFY OFF, then the worked track will not be tested.
                 This is much faster !

DISKCOPY:        Copy a disk from SOURCE to TARGET !

FORMAT:          Format a disk in TARGET drive !

QFORMAT:         If you want to format a DOS disk, it must not
                 worked the whole disk !
                 QFORMAT installs a new bootblock and formats track 40 !
                 This is enough to have new empty DOS disk !

ERASE:           Erase the disk in TARGET drive !
                 This option is very fast ( ca. 18 sec. / Disk ) !

CHECK:           Checks the disk in TARGET drive !
                 "0" - no error
                 "1" - not specified error
                 "2" - no sector header
                 "3" - bad sector preamble
                 "4" - bad sector ID
                 "5" - bad header checksum
                 "6" - bad sector checksum
                 "7" - to few sectors
                 "8" - bad sector header

INSTALL:         Installs a DOS bootblock on disk in TARGET drive !

BLOCK EDIT:      Edits single blocks of a disk in TARGET drive !
                 You can change the curserposition by using the curserkeys !.
                 ASC:   Shows the ASCII-code of the sign at curserposition !
                 HEX:   Shows the HEX-code of the sign at curserposition !
                 POS:   Shows the position of the sign at curserposition
                        on disk !
                 SAVE:  Writes the edited block back on disk !
                 ABORT: Quits the block-editor !

SHOW RAW:        Shows the datas of a track in `RAW` format !
                 This option is usefull to read and show tracks of a disk
                 with the long track format, which is often used by
                 copyprotected software ! But it will shown in uncoded mode !
                 Use curserkeys to select single sectors of a track !
                 Use space bar or escape to quit this option !

INFO:            Shows the name and the free bytes of a DOS disk
                 in TARGET drive !

DIR:             Shows the files of a DOS disk in TARGET drive !

SYS CHECK:       Checks the vectors... "ColdCapture"
                                       "CoolCapture"
                                       "WarmCapture"
                                       "KickMemPtr "
                                       "KickTagPtr "
                 If one of these vectors abnormal...
                 the vector and his pointer will be shown !
                 This option is usefull to check if a virus in system !

SYS RESET:       Starts a coldreset !
                 This option is usefull if one vector is abnormal !

ABOUT:           Short informations about the program AMOSCopy V1.0a and
                 the available memory !

EXIT:            Quits AMOSCopy V1.0a to Workbench !

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tip:             If you want to write a bootblock from one disk to another,
                 use following...
                 Take disk with bootblock in TARGET drive !
                 Start option BLOCK EDIT !
                 Answer blocknumber with 0 !
                 Take disk without bootblock in TARGET drive !
                 Choose SAVE !
                 Now the bootblock should be installed on disk !

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imprtant:        AMOSCopy V1.0a needs the Diskfont.Library in folder LIBS
                 on bootdisk !

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:            AMOSCopy V1.0a is my first Shareware program !
                 If you use it regular or take some routines from
                 the AMOS-code, please send me what you want !
                 As example a postcard with greetings or any else !
                 ( This would be a very honorable gesture ! Thanks ! )

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, that`s all !
I hope that AMOSCopy V1.0a will meet something !

                                         Good bye
