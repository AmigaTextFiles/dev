                   THE SECRETS OF AMOS PRO's HELP ACCESSORY!
===============================================================================

Whilst  putting  the  finishing  touches  to my latest AMOS creations I stumbled
across  some  amazingly  clever  secret  messages  which are built into the AMOS
Professional  system  Help accessory.  I usually use the Help option to check up
on syntax of certain commands which I don't use regularly.

The  amazing thing first happened a few weeks ago and I couldn't understand were
it  came  from.  When I pressed the HELP key during editing one of my programs a
message appeared saying:

                         "The worlds best programmer!"

It confused me!  I quit out of the Help accessory and then reloaded it - and the
message  had  gone!!   I  wondered  how I had activated it but couldn't think of
anything  so  forgot about it.  Then yesterday the messages returned.  This time
there was more and all different!

The  new  message  read "Queens Park Rangers".  What was it to mean?  At first I
thought  the  messages  were  activated  when  your  text cursor is in a certain
position  along  a  certain  line.  And this seemed to work in a single piece of
source  code.   But  when  I tried it in another program I'd written the message
wouldn't appear.

Then  earlier  today  (28/06/1995)  I found some more messages.  The first was a
long one and read:

"The young TV star has this to say about his football team:  Queens Park Rangers
are a super team!  They'll never win anything though..."

What  was the obsession with Q.P.R then?  However this message didn't come up at
ceratin  positions  in  the editor window.  It just kept popping up all over the
place.   Then  another message appeared saying "The only man to burn a hole in a
QWERTY keyboard.".  These messages are strange!

However  I think I've found how to get the last message up all the time.  It was
to do with the commands on the line the cursor was on.  It also depended in what
position the text cursor was in.

I entered this on a new blank line:

                                   Add ME UP

Then I put the cursor between the ADD and the ME so it was in the space!  I then
pressed the HELP key and it popped up; a message about QWERTY keyboards!!!

Now  I  can't  remember  what  I was doing when I got the other messages up so I
can't tell you how too.  I wrote this article so ask any other AMOS Pro users if
they've  found  ANY  other  messages  in  the Help system; or am I the only one?
Please  write  in  and reveal any other findings linked with the Help accessory.
Send  your  findings  in  and  I'll let every body know and give you the credit.
Scibble  down  how you think you managed to get the message to be shown and also
what the message is to this address:-

                                Sauce `N' Code,
                                   "Bradda",
                               Crowborough Road,
                                   Georegahm,
                                  North Devon.
