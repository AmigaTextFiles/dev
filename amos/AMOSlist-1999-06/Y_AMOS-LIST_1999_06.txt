   * ASCII signitures have been rebuilt where possible.
     Unfortunately Yahoo store messages in a way which means more than 1 space

     view HTML source in Firefox didn't make any difference.
     Where I have been unable to rebuild the ASCII signitures I have simply put
     "ASCII Signiture As-Is" by the message number.

     Thanks to Mark de Jong (from the AMOS-LIST) for helping me with rebuilding
     Floquet's ASCII signiture. (who else would keep emails for 7 years?!)

     Thanks to Andrew Allen for preserving Peter Cahill's ASCII signiture for
     me (see message 1613) in November 1998.

     Thanks to Michael Cox, as I was able to cross-reference some emails from
     the Onelist archives with ones posted to the Yahoo one to reinstate email
     addresses that Yahoo has discarded, and rebuild some ASCII signitures.

JOY vs KEYSTATE

Tue Jun 1, 1999 12:06 pm
"Eric Molyneux" <eric_molyneux@lineone.net>


Hi Everyone (those that are left ),
Here's a little
problem thaqt I can't figure out.
Take the following;-
If jdown(1):y=y+1:endif : rem Fine, bob moves down OK, no probs'
if fire(1):<proc _fire>:endif; rem Fine, _Fire works OK
Now do the two together and it works fine as you would expect, Bob moves
down and fires at the same time, no problem whatsoever, done it hundreds of
times.
NOW, do exactly rthe same thing using Keystate, with keystate(77) curs down,
for jdown(1) and keystate(64) spacebar, for fire(1).
Fine, they both work great.
Now try the two together and it locks up, Why?.
All the rest work OK, Up, Right, Left with Fire(spacebar). only down is
effected. in the end, I have had to use an Alt key for Fire.
A simple way to test this, is use "Bell " and "Shoot"in place of the bob
move and the fire
It's surprising how often one gets these things, which outwardly don't make
sence.
I had one once in Amal which would only work one way arround, but not the
other, yet they both made sense.
Anyone else out there come across these things that would make a handy tip
for the others, would save us all taking it out on the keyboard.
Oh by the way, I could badly do with Protracker if anyone knows where to get
it.
THANKS
(OLD
WRINKLEY)

It's (probably - haven't tried the exact keys out) due to the way the Amiga
keyboard is handled. Some keys just don't fit together.

It's the same on the PC. Ever tried playing Micro Machines in two player mode
on keyboard? If you hold down three keys, your opponent wont be able to
control his car! Very annoying!

Try to use the shift keys (Shift, Control, Alt and Amiga) - they never have any
problems.

If you look in the AMOS Pro manual, you will see this:
"...each dimension can have up to 65,000 elements."

The strange thing about this is that uncompiled, AMOS doesn't catch this
problem [or bug] (even if you go way over the limit; not sure how far,
though). However, if you compile the program, namely as a compiled AMOS
proggie, then it will quit with the error that you described.

Either way, it seems to be one of AMOS' limitations, and the only way
around it is to either 1) use less than 65,000 elements or 2) use an
alternative method for storing your arrays (ie. banks or sequential files).

Congratulations, you have descovered the EVIL which is keyboard conficts.
This happens whenever a key on the same line is pressed. (try c and v or b
or n for example) The arrow keys are evil as they conflict with all the
lines of letters and should not be used for more then one player

What you should have for two players:

[S or D]

[Z] [X] [C]

with shifts and

[0 or -]

[o] [p] [[]

with other shifts etc

That way you get no conflict.

Re: Motivation?

Tue May 25, 1999 11:38 pm
Steve Eaborn <eaborn@powernet.co.uk>


Motivation, huh?

Games are my forte. I've written a few since the first incarnation of Amos.
I look on it as a creative hobby, a bit like painting. I think that writing
a game is the most demanding application you can write for any computer. It
takes programming ability to be able to synchronise events in real time and
make a game appear smooth

I was away from the Amiga scene for quite a while until I found a
second-hand A1200 going cheap (my trusty old A500 having finally given up
the ghost), so I got back into coding games again and found the thrill was
still there. No matter what language you use to write, on whichever
platform, there is always a better way of doing something, and it's finding
the better way that gives the most satisfaction. I like Amos because it has
limitations (in it's basic form anyway), and I like to stretch these
limitations as far as I can.

As far as actual coding goes, I rarely finish a game. I like to look at an
existing game and say to myself 'I wonder if that could be done in Amos',
so away I go and try. If I make that idea work, then I tend to lose
interest in finishing the project. No game that I have written up to now
has been totally original (although I do have an idea that I'm dwelling on
at the moment).

Now I am married with a one-year-old son, I want to be able to write games
and educational programs for him. Even if the Classic Amiga disappears into
the sunset someday, you might still find me huddled in my study writing

Is anyone interested in crashing their computer? I've been

patterns, freezes the game... then sits thinking about what's
happening and then crashes!

If anyone was interested in wasting their time having a gander, or
have had something similar happen to them, I can send the

I did eventually find the problem, but *why* it happened still

There's also another strange phenomenon happening with AMOS:

When I run my "MapEditor" program... (hmm... this is a bit hard to
explain)... when I click a mouse button on certain areas, the
Workbench system sound is activated!! It also rings with certain
events during the program! The curious thing is, it doesn't occur
on every button click or event.....

I find this rather inexplicable.

You can imagine how quickly a "chomp" sound would get when played
over and over and over and over........

Any ideas anyone?

its buggy. Use 'F 16proc Icon' or 'F 32proc Icon'. They're almost as fast
but have no bugs (only work for 16x16 and 32x32 icons respectivly)

amos.com registration?

Fri Jun 4, 1999 11:49 pm
Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>


Hi y'all,

I'll get to the point very quick, well I see that the official amos page
is at,

http://members.xoom.com/AmosFactory/front.html

Which is quite a long address and is on free space, I wonder if anyone
would be interested in me registering www.amos.com if its still free or
www.amos.net if its not. This could offer email addresses for products,
and Amos groups etc, for example Andrew Crowes Mantasoft amos
group could have, mantasoft@amos.com as well as other groups having
other addresses.

We could also sub-domain from amos.com with things like,

www.mushy.amos.com for a Mushy PD site or anything of importance.

I was thinking that the main site could be a global place for amos users
around the world, how often have you typed anything of interest without
actually knowing if the site exists, you would type
www.name-of-a-group.com and most probably come up with a site to
do with the group you where looking for even if you didn't know the
site was actually there. I'm sure some people have thought lets try
for an Amos site, hmm maybe www.amos.com would be a good idea, its
easy to remember. they type it and find nothing exists, if i registered
it then we could have the biggest global resource for amos programs.

We could have sections for news, latest releases detailing anything
programmed in amos new, tutorials and help sections giving extensive
help into every single problem. We could have sections for important
projects like the new Amos with up to the second news on what is going
on, an amos swap section, questions and answers where people can
post questions and anyone could give an answer, ideas pool where
authors could get ideas from users who use their software.

Just think this could be a mass resource for Amos. For this to happen
I need *alot* of support to make it worth while buying the domain and
paying for hosting etc etc. I will also not beable to put 100% into this
project because of running alot of other things so would need alot
of help, ie. html coders, ideas, gfx, layout designers and other helpers
of other sorts.

You could advertise for rare disks of amos, need helpers for your
utility or game? this could be a great chance to let them know, put
together new teams to design new amos products, games/apps made
in amos or extensions etc. You never know big brother multi-million
pound company or an Amiga company could spot your work and give
you your break. It will allow a main centre for all small one man teams
to unite.

If anyone has any ideas on this or if you think its a good idea reply
to the list and let everyone know.

If www.amos.com is taken we could have www.amos.net or www.amos.org

Toodle Pip!

FTP send through amos?

Fri Jun 4, 1999 11:49 pm
Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>


Hi,

I was wondering if any knew if its possible to open a TCP session via
amos? I know its possible to access the serial port and also to run
external TCP programs but is there any internal Amos way?

My need to know this is I want to make a small example to send a file
from one computer to an FTP site on another. You run the program on
your computer and the file you suppy is sent directly to the ftp
site IP you give. I don't know if this is possible but if anyone has any
ideas then that would be great!

If its not possible then maybe the new Amos that is being produced
could have good TCP/IP workings. ie. allow TCP programs to be made.

Toodle Pip!

Hi Paolo

>Well, I am running it; but you must be warned that I am almost

>you...
>Anyway, what's the problem?

The problem is my keyboard interface.
it works fine without my ppc060 board, but when I plug in my
ppc060 9 times out of 10 the miggy won't come on when I power
up. (the num lock doesn't light) and I have to switch off
also if the miggy crashes or I reset, the keyboard locks
and I have to power down for 1-2 hours!!!

with the ppc060 out, it works fine and resets okay..

I've tried my ppc060 board in my spare miggy, and it works
fine, no probs.. so obviously the keyboard interface doesn't
like my accel..?

any ideas how I fix it..?

I need my 060, my backup accel (an 030) seems soooo slow.
its like wading though teacle... and It only takes an 8mb
simm.. I can do bugger all with 8mb :(

(BTW - my keyboard interface is a little farting thing which
actually "sits" on top of a chip to the right of where the
keyboard ribbon should go.)

any suggestions..???!!

Regards
Steve

Well, I have no idea...
But you could do like me, and use a (shame on me!) win95 keyboard, as
they are said to be cheap and the port at the back of the Power Tower
is ok for them. Then you just need to get a win95 keymap (it is on
Aminet, if I remember well), or you can use the english one correcting
the keys which are different (that's what I did, and now I've got 2
Ctrl and 2 Help keys). The only drawback I've found is that unless I
press the Left-A key it doesn't recognize either of the Ctrl keys, but
after pressing it once everything works fine...

Not much help, but if you can't find anything else...

Paolo

Help re Extensions.

Sat Jun 5, 1999 11:11 pm
Ashley Clarke <ashley@a-clarke.demon.co.uk>


I've downloaded three Extensions from the Amos Factory to find them difficult
to install:

"Craft", Has got a bad keymap for the installer (which also crashes on my
A1200);
"JD", uses location 12 on the Interpreter set-up which clashes with other
Extensions;
"OS Dev Kit", has the installer missing completely and some Directories, and
"Turbo+", messes-up the Amos Pro Interpreter-Config file (I think).

Where exactly is the Amos Pro Interpreter Config file read from?
I've tried using the Editor Menu options for Loading and Saving custom
Interpreter files
in "SYS:S", without much luck, although the Editor Loads the Default alright.
I'm using Version 2.

Can all the Extension commands be Compiled?
This is my first attempt to access extra Extensions, other than the ones
supplied with
the Updater. Do they really make that much difference to the ease of
programming?

Greetings, Ashley.

> Where exactly is the Amos Pro Interpreter Config file read from?
I'm not entirely sure, but I think it reads it from S: first, and if it's
not found there, then it checks your AMOSPro_System: directory. The file it
checks, of course, is the AMOSPro.Interpreter_Config file.

> Can all the Extension commands be Compiled?
Turbo Plus can (the full version anyways), and so can the others, unless
they are demo versions that won't allow you to compile them.

> Do they really make that much difference to the ease of programming?
Many can, namely AMCAF, Turbo+, TGE, and GUI, to name a few.

Weird bob/screen problem

Hi ppl

Today I discovered a weird thing about using 2 screens with Bobs... Try the
attachment and see the results...

Seems amos only wants to display bobs on the screen they were first displayed
on!

Does anyone know how to avoid/fix this problem?

Blizzard PPC boards doesn`t work with standart A1200/A600 PSUs. 4,5 Amps for
5 Volts is needed for A1200 with a Blizzard PPC,but standart A1200 PSU
outputs only 3 Amps for 5 Volts. Old A500+ PSUs outputs 4.5 Amps,so you can
use one of these.Of course best solution is buying a reinforced PSU (like
Goliath,e.t.c) or buying a Power Tower/Micronik Infinity with a strong PSU.

Yes, including hard drives + CD Roms.
It is suicidal to keep his Amiga out of a tower nowadays:
- You get a good power supply easy to replace with a stronger one if
needed
- Your accelerator board finds fresh air
- You can plug easily another hard drive, a CD...
- You can add SCSI extensions
- Your amiga gets a "pro" touch
- Your wife comes back, your son gets his exams, you win at Lotto.. ;)
- And many more !

The only bad point is that you loose the PCMCIA connector, but it is
possible to buy an adapter.

Weird bob/screen problem

Wed Dec 31, 1969 11:59 pm
"Paolo Rinaldi" <amifam.rin@tiscalinet.it>


Hi Arash!

> Today I discovered a weird thing about using 2 screens with Bobs... Try the

I know, I saw it before...

> Seems amos only wants to display bobs on the screen they were first displayed
> on!
No, it's only that it doesn't let you display the same bob on two
screens: as you didn't call Bob Off, the bob is still on the first
screen, and for some strange reason it doesn't want to eliminate it
for you, thus not displaying it on the new screen.

> Does anyone know how to avoid/fix this problem?
The only way I could come up with is to put a
Bob Off 1 : Wait Vbl
at the end of the loop: so it works, although it slows down everything
a little ;-(

Paolo

My RBM TowerhawkII doesn't even need an adaptor:) (tho it IS unusually big:)

What we could really use would be an easy to open mac-ish tower... but that'd
probably cost too much anyway...

Hello Andrew

I just downloaded the BM demo via your site.

It's VERY impressive, well done and good luck with it.
It ran very quickly on my 40/40, I didn't have time to read the loading
message!

Are the icons in Magic Workbench colours? I dont use that colour scheme so
they look a bit odd.

Leto Kauler <letok@netspace.net.au>



I said before that one of my programs was having trouble with the
system sound blaring all the time..... well, I found the problem!
(I think)

I noticed it in another program too, and found it was related to
whenever the "Text" command was used. In the end it turned out to
be some sort of clash with a Workbench program called "CacheFont"
which I run! Now that I've removed that program AMOS doesn't seem
to cause any more trouble.

Bizarre, huh ^_-

I suggest a little program called *MWB_2_NI* It does wonders for
MWB icons for NewIcon users.

Also, can I make a point for people doing programs / games in
AMOS: DON'T make people need to put assign in their start-up
sequences, etc. This is $%^*! annoying. It is quite simple to do
it through AMOS (well, Pro at least).

Thank you ;)

One thing that I do is check prg_state to see if the program's compiled. If
not, then I can use logicals to my data directories for development, otherwise
I look in the current directory for needed files.

What I usually do if I want to convert a MWB icon is use Iconian to make a
Newicon using the MWB colour palette.
I guess MWB_2_NI does the same thing (probably quicker).

Calling Gareth Griffiths

Hey Gareth,

I just saw the blitz list (grr!) on the latest AF CD and saw you are
making a GTA clone. I to was planning to do something similar a while
back and my letter featured in the last issue of CU Amiga about
doing this. I had someone doing the code in amos but unfortunally
I've given up on this project.

Instead I contacted Take 2 and the other companies involved and they
said they migh be interested if a company like clickBOOM do was prepared
to convert it. I past this information onto clickBOOM. They said they
would keep me informed but that was about 4-5 months ago, oh well,
maybe they'll release the 'real' thing one day. If you interested
in seeing what was our basic effort email me privately.

Toodle Pip!

- How do you feel about point and click graphic adventures?

- Do you think speech is an important feature? Full or partial?

- Is background music preferable to sounds? Vise versa? Or both?

- Are there any features which help a g.adventure stand out, or
should be included just because they're cool?

- Are g.adventures better humourous or more serious?

Point and click adventures are great - especially if you use a

Speech is not essential, however it does add a bit of quality

Background music is always essential, especially if you wish for
the game to do well.

Finish the game and then add the cool bits :)

Love 'em, expecially if they have cute cartoon graphics *grin*.

>- Do you think speech is an important feature? Full or partial?

Personally I acually hate speech in most games, ditto with movie sequences.
But it did work in some of the kings quest games..

>- Is background music preferable to sounds? Vise versa? Or both?

Background music definatly.. I've yet to find a graphic adventure that
acually makes good use of non-repeative sfx.

>- Are there any features which help a g.adventure stand out, or

Depends on the game.

>- Are g.adventures better humourous or more serious?

Humourous, but it's a matter of preference..
Not totally humorous to the point of being stupid, however..
There still has to be a reasonably serious plot line.

At Home Electronics World show in Keulen from 12 t/m 14 November they will
show the next generation Amiga's! If things are correct the first one will
be some what like the Amiga 500. I really hope Amos will be ported to the
next generation. The current Amos will still run on it but through some sort
of emulation. A next generation of Amiga's without Amos would not be the
same!

This will be the year we all hoped for. Some KICK_ASS computers, not the
shit they like to call Windows (I kicked my pc with Windows so many time,
it's a wonder it still runs)

Hi Leto!

They're really cool: they are the best types of game, together with
Napalm, of course ;-)

> - Do you think speech is an important feature? Full or partial?

Well, if it is good it fits well, but you should also write on screen
what is said (I'm getting mad trying to understand what Myst says ;-()

> - Is background music preferable to sounds? Vise versa? Or both?

Absolutely background music is a must have...

> - Are there any features which help a g.adventure stand out, or

Well it should be neither impossible nor too stupid to solve

> - Are g.adventures better humourous or more serious?

If they're well made there's little difference, though if you don't
know what to do in a humourous one you can at least have a good
laugh ;-)

Where does this info come from ? I've never heard about that. Maybe just
a huge PC running the new OS will be presented. Maybe...
Be careful with rumours. Especially when they say what we want to hear.

All you people must have heard that new Amiga's are coming! This info that I
previous announced is from a good source. The new OS will be running on a
excisting kernel called "Neutrino" (Don't know if I spelled it wright?). The
Amiga part will be build on that. The first machines will have OS 4 wich
later can be upgraded to OS 5. I still haven't heard what processor it will
contain. Some say PowerPC but i think (Peter Kittel likes this processor) a
processor from Hewlet Packet (The HP-A?). The "graphics card" will be better
then the one in the Sega Dreamcast. 24 gigabyte per second? There must be
people that know a bit more about this. Let me know!

Folks,

I don't know what 'reliable sources' you've all been reading, but check
out this link

http://www.cucug.org/amiga/aminews/1999/990509-cucug.html

for word straight from the horses mouth, it's an interview with Amiga's
Vice President of Engineering, talks alot about what the new OS will be
like, of course even coming from the horses mouth I'd still take all of
this with a grain of salt, I'm excited about the new OS, but forgive my
cynicism if I say we've heard alot of this talk before. At any rate at
least this guy is actually working in a lab, developing the new amiga,
instead of just talking about what it will be like.


Thanks,
Scott Matott sXe

BTW,

the os that was mentioned, the one Amiga OS 4 will run on top of is the
QNX os, I've heard really good things about it from Unix junkie friends of
mine, which is a good sign, as a rule those guys usaully hate anything
even remotely single-user-ish.

QNX like Unix has been compiled for a host of processors so the AMiga OS
will probly be as well. This is very good news, as the PowerPC is dead,
the alpha going and the Intel x86 ought to have expired years ago, like
right along with it's peer the Motorola 68k line, where it not for
Microsoft...

If I can sneak another personal note in here, I find it astonshing that
the i86 line is still around competing with, and actually beating, the
68k's successor, the PowerPC...

I think Alpha is the dead one:) ppl choose muli-processor x86 setups instead
of alphas nowadays... (more powerful and cheaper it seems)

one question about the ppc, whose developing it??

Not IBM, not Motorola, certainly not Apple...

Anyway, I don't want to get the list involved in
this kind of banter, my only real point is that portablility will be key
to any new OS and the Amiga will happily have that, we should stop
worrying about what kind and clock speed processor the thing will run on
and start asking about what software it will run.

IBM *_and*_ Motorola :)

They're resolving the differences in architecture of IBM's standard and
Motorola's AltiVec instruction set with their "Book E" project.

I agree... I don't really care what processors are chosen as long as the NG
miggy's do the job and do it better than wintel platforms:) (which should be
an easy task:)

Comic strip

Wed Jun 16, 1999 4:53 pm
Leto Kauler <letok@netspace.net.au>



A couple of months ago I created a comic strip character named
"BoingMan" which was supposed to be for a European Amiga magazine.
It was probably my fault, but this didn't eventuate.

To my knowledge, it is the only Amiga-specific comic about. But
anyway... I've only drawn one strip and some sketches but if
people are interested I was wondering if it would be worth putting
up a web-page for what has been done so far.

If anyone knows of any Amiga mags wanting a strip then they should
get in touch with me ;)

I -alas- don't know any mag interested yet, but I'd be blag to see that
on the web !
I'll ask for the (coming) amiga-news mag, scheduled for september. Your
strip will have to be translated into french, I can do it, if they
accept your work.

Just worked another 12 Hour day, so what's ten minutes?
I like survey questions, which in answering can help yourself.
This information would be helpfull for others too!

>- How do you feel about point and click graphic adventures?

It seems to be the most effective form of Biofeedback with
current mainstream technology. Don't you always test the Vocabulary
Parser for swear words on Text Adventures?

>- Do you think speech is an important feature? Full or partial?

English, for me please. But not escensial. They saw us.

>- Is background music preferable to sounds? Vise versa? Or both?

Both. The Amigas' got 4 Channels to play with, so why not?

>- Are there any features which help a g.adventure stand out, or
> should be included just because they're cool?

A good clue would be to simply look at the large Bill Boards around
Town. See how products "stand out" against the "normal" hustle and bustle.

>- Are g.adventures better humourous or more serious?

Either. It's up to the individual participating in the experience
of the "Adventure", whether they find it's content humourous or serious.

xor bobs

"floquet" <floquet@hp-sc.univ-lille2.fr>


Hello, all,

I would like to know if it is possible to paste something on the
screen, doing an x-or for every pixel: If I paste twice the same thing,
the screen remains as it was before.

I know how to do with plot, draw, text.. but I would like to paste
coloured things like bobs.

I have *MANY* objects to animate, but just a few at one time: One
invader, the player's ship, some bombs, lasers and bonuses.
The next invader will be moved at the next VBL, well you maybe know how
space invaders move !

If anyone could help me ?

of your suggestions to the game. Still, rather than have it rotting on my

If you're animating stuff on a clear background, why not just draw a
black rectangle over the old image, erasing it before you paste the new one
down?

Isn't there a way to set the bob drawing style using Autoback or Mask??
I know there's a way to set it so the bob draws in 'trails' style, so it
doesn't replace the background after it moves. Do you have the man or
help pages?? Look under the mask command...

Music Behind Samples...

Fri Jun 18, 1999 7:25 pm
"Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>



This must be an old old question, but does anybody know how to make
samples play over a mod, like just cancel the one channel instead of
pausing the whole song?
I know Amos str8 up won't let you do this with Mod's or MEd files, will it
allow it with amos Music files?? if so how to you make an Amos music file,
the manual seems to skirt around this issue...
Primarily, however, I am interested in such a routine for MOD files.

Since I don't have one, (and don't know where to get one for free) I am
going to write a program to put Sound/Music to Anim files.
Once set up it will play sounds at user specified frames in an anim. I am
leaving room for other effects too, fades, volume fades, ect.
anyway, for the music part, I want it to be able to play both music and
sounds at the same time...

Get the Doom Music Extention or Amicaf Extention, both let you turn MOD's
channels on and off.

You need to use the 'Set Bob' command to define the way your bobs are drawn
on screen. You can select whether or not to replace the background with a
single colour, define a mask (blitter mode) for drawing the bob, or even
set which bitplanes to draw the bob in.

syntax is...
Set Bob bobno,background,planes,mask

you must set bob before you actually draw the bob on screen.

They are the best games ever BTW :) I've played most of them

Well nowadays, yes, very important, it adds to the feel, makes it
look more like todays games and is a nice gimic that sells.

Music is a best choice but with some sounds, the music needs to be
very atmospheric and lots of it for different locations, ie, when
you enter the next location/screen the music really should change
to suit it. Lots of music or people get bored.

>

Graphics, need to be very cartoony (sp?) and colourful. They need
to have alot of detail, lots of it.

>
> - Are g.adventures better humourous or more serious?

No humourous all the time, just look at the likes of the humour
in Monkey Island series, very funny. Also Leisure Suit Larry
collection, smutty humour was good, depends on what the game
is about really. If someone was murdered and your finding
out about a murder then humourous comments won't go dowm
to well but..

A colourful game with bouncy but atmospheric music with humour
sounds good to me.

You really should find someone funny though and spend along
time working on the humour and test it on people lots before the
game is released. You don't want corney comments and silly
puns that aren't funny at all and the game is advertised as the
funniest game of the year, etc.

BTW, does this mean your making an c&p adventure game? can
I take a wee look :)?

Hope it was some help!

Amcaf.lha??? Sam Raw???

Sun Jun 20, 1999 5:48 pm
"Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>



Been working on my little project,
Two snags,
1) Visited amos factory (VERY VERY nice, hats off to you guys for a e that
is at once simple and buetiful, love the no-frames/no java line!)
Problem, the copy of amcaf.lha on the site won't unzip, I've
downloaded it twice, tried both amiha lha v1.38 and MacLha2.21 and no
luck. The files come out grossly corrupted, anybody else have this
problem?

2) Sam Raw ain't doing it...
even copying the text str8 out of the manual Sam Raw just plays garbage.
I know I am loading the samples right because loading one then saving it
to ram: then reloading in a MOD prog. works.
I have:
reserve as work 10,120000
bload "ram:sound",start(10) : rem sample is <120,000 bytes big
Sam Raw 15,start(10),length(10),8000

nothing, just looping noise.
well any ideas??
I want to use Sam Raw so i can put the samples in Fast Ram, leaving plenty
of Chip free for animations...

The problem is simple : you *CAN'T *play samples from fast ram, under any
circumstances. You *must* have the sound in chip mem or the custom chips
can't access it.

The only way to get round this is to have all the samples stored in fast
ram, and then copy it temperaraly to chip ram to play it.

Something like:

reserve as work 10,120000
bload "ram:sound",start(10) : rem sample is <120,000 bytes big

_SAMPLAY[10,8000,15]

Procedure _SAMPLAY[bank,rate,chan]

reserve as chip work 1000,length(bank)
copy start(bank),start(bank)+length(bank) to start(1000)

sam raw chan,start(bank),length(bank),rate

End proc


there you go, I've just typed it in to YAM so I'm not sure it'll work, but
you get the idea ;)

See ya.

I've only really now got back into using it from the demo version, and its
so god damn bloody full of bugs that weren't there before its almost
unusable!!!
So, has anyone got a copy of *full* version of the intuition extention

I've sent an email to Andrew, but I suspect he probably doesn't support
it any more ;(

That's a good idea ! In fact the backgrond is just composed of a
vertical starfield, but the use of a dual playfield may solve the pb.
Thanks a lot !

Desktop conversion

Hi everybody,
Old Wrinkly here, keep popping up now and again.
Please, I need help, (as usual).
I picked up a Desktop converted A1200 the other day, I really bought it for
the parts for my a1200, but it seems such a shame to undo all the work.
The point is, the reason I got it cheap was that they could not get the
mouse to work.
When I opened it up, I found they had cut off the end of the board, and with
it the mouse port, to get it to fit in the case.
I connected a mouse port to it, but as they told me, the mouse would not
work.
In the end, I put in a complete A1200 Motherboard, but still no mouse.
Now, what I am asking, is there anyway I can get access, without the mouse,
as I am unable to click on any Icons.
Is there anyone with any wiring diagrams of this sort of thing.
If you will bear with me, the following is a general rundown of the layout.
For some reason, it has two power packs, the usual one that plugs into the
power port and another one with the following details:-
SKY HAWK Switching Power Supply.
Input 115v/230v~5a/3a 50-60hz
Output =5@21a -5@ 0.3a +12@9a -12@ 0.5a Model ut230xt.
PC Keyboard through adapter (works OK).
HD Make unknown Floppy Drive
Ribbon connections to Floppy and HD
Both Power Packs are connected to one main switch
Main output from Skyhawk goes through a separate toggle switch then back
into powerpack
From the Powerpack comes a jungle of wiring, feeding the HD and Floppy
Drive, also feeding a switch panel, which has "Reset" "Turbo" and "Digital
Readout Panel"
On this wiring, there are 4 separate inline connectors, which look like they
have been set up for extra hardware
From the turbo switch, there are three separate wires, with a female three
way connector, which is not attached to anything (no idea what this is
for ).
I know it is a lot to ask, but someone may recognise the layout, I certainly
hope so as I would like to get it up and running
Thanks in anticipation
Old Wrinkly

Heh, an Amiga without a mooose is like a fish without water :P It is
possible on most screens to move the mouse around using Right Amiga and
the cursor keys. To left click use left amiga and left alt and to right
click, use right amiga and right alt. Combinations of these keys also
allow you to select and drag icons etc. You could also use a command
called Joymouse, which allows you use your joystick/pad to emulate the
mouse.

I've whipped up a few simple pages for the comic strip now.
Hopefully you'll be able to find it at:

boingman.cjb.net

Otherwise try:

letostarfish.cjb.net/zankoku/boing_main.htm

There should be one proper strip and a sketch available to view.
The strip is designed as a later "story" after the characters have
been introduced, etc... but you'll get the idea ^_^

Thanks, too, to all those of you who took the time to reply to my
graphic adventure survey. It seems background music is an
absolute necessity (with an option to turn it off!)... but most
people weren't OVERLY enthusiastic about full speech. Apparently
this is not very important.

I did not understand every word (i.e. what's a "dork" ? I don't have a

Some words on Sam Raw....

Mon Jun 21, 1999 5:16 pm
"Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>


>

>
> The problem is simple : you *CAN'T *play samples from fast ram, under any
> circumstances. You *must* have the sound in chip mem or the custom chips

>
A word in my defense, the reason I wasn't thinking about this is
because the I was reading the manual which actually says nothing about it,
although it's is the Pro manual I reckon it just assumes everybody's using
an unexpanded A500 and so wouldn't have any fast ram, thus Reserve and
Reserve as Chip would be the same.

Also this whole thing must be an over sight of the music extension
as well because to HEAR a sample it must be dumped to chip ram but clearly
amos forces you to also hold it in chip ram, let me explain:

To HEAR a Raw sound file you need only dump it to the Audio: device, I
believe it's called RAW: or something, the see that this is true, just go
into DOpus or a shell and try it, copy a raw sound file to RAW:, it will
beigin playing out of your amiga's speakers, pretty cool huh?
Sam Raw does this same thing, it dumps the contents of an Amos
bank to the RAW: device for playing.
Since the Amiga's custom audio chips can indeed only look at chip
ram, dumping a file to RAW: must copy it to chip ram and then play it, and
then discard it.
Then this is in effect what Sam Raw does.
But look at the code you actually need to make sam raw work. It
in effect does this twice!

1) Copy Sample from fast ram to chip ram bank
2) Run Sam Raw
a) This copies sample to RAW:, Chip ram!
b) Play sample from RAW:, discard it
3) Erase chip ram bank

Thus you are twice over copying the sound to chip ram!

Even if the details aren't perefect it's clear there must be two
copies of the sample made because right after the Sam Raw command we ERASE
the bank holding the sample, yet the sample will continue to play!

Clearly if Sam Raw were actually reading the sound from the bank
it would have to stop as the bank's been erased! If there's nothing in
the bank anymore then where is it getting the data to play the sample??
Clearly it must have stashed it in chip ram to play it, like putting it on
the Audio Chip's que.

Anyway, what's the point of all this?? My point is that to do it
the Amos way you need twice as much chip ram! You need Chip Ram once for
the temp bank holding the sample and once for the actual playing of the
sample in RAW:.
Quite frankly this sucks. Why? Obviously you only need the
double ram for a little bit as you quickly delete the chip bank. But the
real trouble is Memory Fragmentation. Does everybody know about the pie
theory of Amiga memory management?? Basically the Amiga slices it's
memory up like peices of a pie and hands it out to applications. The
problem is when the applications go to give the ram pieces back they're
already cut, the Amiga can't refuse them with the rest of the pie, it can
hand the piece out again to another app, or even cut it again, but it can
never re-connect it with the rest of the pie. An example:
Suppose you have 1 meg of ram, now run a 500k application (one may
actually be hard to find, amiga apps are so good and thrifty with ram :)
Now quit and try to run a 700k app (I've never actually seen one
of these ;)
It won't run, because the amiga has split it's ram, it cut a 500k
slice for the first app, leaving another 500k piece behind.
When you quit the first app it returned it's slice, 500k, but now
there are two slices, 500k each, waiting to be used.
So...when the 2nd app asks for 700k there isn't enough ram, even
though there is! There's one meg free, but only if you want it 500k at a
time. The only way to get back to a full 1 meg free is to reboot!

Since Amiga apps are so good with memory fragmentation isn't a big
deal, but it is the reason your amiga will never see the kind of UpTime a
good Unix box gets. No matter how small the apps are you run enough of
them and pretty soon your memory is split into all heck and you can't
start any new apps.
Getting back to amos, if all the samples I use are less than 50k
this shouldn't be a problem, but not all samples are, esp. the kind you'd
like to hear with an animation (ie Speach!) if my prog keeps opening up
100-300k slices of chip ram soon it will be fragmented beyond recognition.
And if it has to open these slices Two at a time it will fragment even
quicker.

Any ideas on how to get around this??


BTW Andy, thanks again for the original solution, I am plenty grateful
have something that works in the first place ;) you were right, yam be
damned the code worked right out of your email!

Better yet, use Set Bob so your bobs do no clean up, leaving
copies of themselves all over the place. Then put a Black Border all
around your bob, it will 'Erase' its old self as it goes.

Now all of those were left intact, but the mouse spot was killed?? Just

Anybody written a routine to interpret IFF sound files??
They seem to work like this, some lines with text saying it is an IFF
file, and then it's name, but where is the default frequency to play it
at? As this followed by the sample in raw data form.
Also how do I get amos to load the file, grab the info form the
header and then copy JUST the data to a memory bank for playing? I don't
want the header cause it makes random noise at the start of playing the
sample.

They did WHAT???? oh dear me.

The only thing I can think of is use a serial mouse with a serial mouse
driver. Look at Power Computings ads, I think they do that kind of deal.

What, you mean you put a full working (not totally butchered) motherboard
it but it still didn't work? Are you sure the mouse works?

Yeah, You're right, the manual words it *really* badly; it makes it sound
like you can store the sample anywhere in memory when they just mean any
bank no.

(they did 'Reserve as Chip Work' in there Sam swap example though)

No, I'm afraid that is completely untrue:

AMOS does not use the AUIDO: device, if it did then it would be AHI
compatible and be able to play long soundFX from fast memory or disc.

What AMOS does is simply access the custom chip directly and make it play
that section of memory. Absolutly NO copying involved.

Thats not because there are two copies in memory, thats because even
though you say 'Erase 10' or whatever, the actuall sound is still that part
of memory, just that block is now 'Free' and can be overwritten.

Try instead of 'erasing' it, using poke to change it all to 0. I think
you find that the sample would soon stop ;)

Ok, once you've written the header interpreter, simply create another
bank and copy the rest of the sample to it:

'
' Presume bank 10 has the IFF file in it and
' headerlength is the length of the header in bytes
'

reserve as chip work 11,length(10)-headerlength
copy start(10)+headerlength,start(10)+length(10) to start(11)


Somethink like that should do it. As for the header format, um, don't ask
me ;) (perhaps there's a doc about it on aminet?)

See ya.

Well, out of the frying pan and into the fire!! This is crazy! I

done otherwise, what's the garuntee I won't write over this data with the

no no, that's fine, besides knowing how it really works points to
a different and potentially more dangerous problem. It won't be hard to
get around though, so actually I'm better off than I thought, just gotta
make sure my bank's don't over lap. At least I don't need twice the mem

How did you figure that one out? Trial and error? it makes sense

Getting the header length in bytes will be the trick. I will have
to look at the file access commands see if there's a way to do it. Since
the header is just text, hmmm... How many bytes per letter, one for ASCII
characters right? Maybe the Header's are a standard length...

>
> reserve as chip work 11,length(10)-headerlength
> copy start(10)+headerlength,start(10)+length(10) to start(11)
Well I would copy it to fast for the time being, but yeah that
would work, of course I will have to have the file in memory twice...
(Just for a little bit though :)
I was looking at the Sample_Bank_Maker, it has a way of loading
files, it opens them using Open In, and then reads the header, and then I
think it reads the rest of the file byte by byte into the memory bank. I
suppose I shoudl try that...

> Somethink like that should do it. As for the header format, um, don't ask

You know I'm looking for it right now...

No, IFF's are pretty complex - same file structure
for all types, but same basic format.

4 bytes: chunk id (eg "FORM", "BODY")
4 bytes: n = length of data
n bytes: data (I think if the length is odd an extra
byte is included to word align, not sure)


I have (somewhere) a qbasic IFF 8SVX loader, but that
was for MS-DOS (yuck!). Amiga programs should use the
standard iffparse.library (but I haven't managed to
learn how it works :( ), which preserves extra data
that you don't need (like "ANNO" comment chunks, and
copyright info).


Good luck

Claude

You're thinking of keeping an output file open. With input nothing on the
disk is changing so no de-validation happens on a crash.

Nope, you don't want to copy a sample to RAW: 'cos you'll be there all
day. (unless you have a gfx card ;)

Yep, thats a problem I had with one of my games. I got round it by having
4 different chip buffers for each channel.

If you're only playing one sample at a time, it makes no difference
though as the sample would be stopped anyway.

Don't forget that even if it needed twice as much, all the rest of the
samples would still be in fast.

When you program a game with quite a bit of sampled speech, you soon run
in to problems keeping it all in chipram ;)

I once saw a program to make the mouse use joy port 2 instead of port 1.

I did, for my midi-driven sample player.
It handles only 8bit mono samples, but recognizes and uses the IFF
frequency chunck and works fine.
I'll cut the part of prog doing that job and post it soon.

I thought, we don't need a Bot to protect the channel, so i am useing
shell only to keep the channel opend. The last 6 months I wasnt on IRC,
now, when Iam back, I see that everybody is talking about Cool's Bot and
his childish behavior. I will observe the channel next weeks to see
whats the problem and do what is the best for the channel.

Ah, that was why you asked me some while ago if that Dutch magazine
had a comic strip :) (I didn't forget it but I didn't had time to reply)

I told one of the writers of the Dutch Amiga magazine (Amiga Scene)
about your comic strip (and also added the url for your boingman site),
so hopefully you'll hear from him :).

Amos Quirks Home-page

Tue Jun 22, 1999 11:01 pm
"Scooter D. Matott sXe" <sdmatott@midway.uchicago.edu>



Hey everybody,
My recent adventures with Sam Raw have inspired me to start up a web page
dedicated to Amos' Quirks, I'd like it to keep track of all those funny,
un- or poorly documented Amos features which have caused so many
head aches over the years.
the site is at:

http://greycity.cs.uchicago.edu/amos/index.html

the html is pretty primitive, I wrote it all in vi as a 'learning
exercise', which means it was an exercise in frustration, but alas....

Anyway, I only posted two quirks, the two I recall off the top of my head,
sooo....

If you all know of any Amos 'quirks' send'em this way!!

BTW:
For the quirk pages I just snipped from my old emails, I hope this
doesn't pee anybody off, I just figured, rather than pretend like I know
anything, why not take the info straight from the horses mouth?? Anyway,
I will set-up a contributors page to list all of you...

Thanks,
Scott Matott sXe

Intuition extention v1.3a ?

Wed Jun 23, 1999 7:22 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

A while ago Andrew Church kindly gave me a copy of the full version of
Intu extention 1.3b

I've only really now got back into using it from the demo version, and its
so god damn bloody full of bugs that weren't there before its almost
unusable!!!
So, has anyone got a copy of *full* version of the intuition extention
V1.3a that I could have please please please?

I've sent an email to Andrew, but I suspect he probably doesn't support
it any more ;(

See ya.

TCP in AMOS

Sorry if this has been fully covered before... I haven't really paid any
attention to this subject until I got my second ethernet card today :)

I want to communicate via the netcards in AMOS (for a game).

I guess I need some info about the TCP commands of the GUI extension.

If it's something else I should be looking for, let me know. I need to know
everything, as I currently know nothing...

At the point I only have a running network with two Amigas and one PC using
Samba.

Sorry, I've got 1.3b as well, but it's no worse than any previous version was.
I dumped int-ext long ago, just because very few of the features worked as
promised. I must add, however, that most of it is duplicated in the gui
extension, and gui is pretty much rock solid.

Yes. But you would be much happier with a copy of TV Paint (especially if

Um, maybe I have a busted version then?

Does, say, 'imouse key' work on your copy? if so then could you send me a
copy please ;)

(my copy of the int ext is 42596 bytes long)

> was. I dumped int-ext long ago, just because very few of the features

The GUI extention is useless to me as it currently doesn't have any way
of copying an amos screen to a pub screen (no, NOT gui clone, 'cos that has
no support for gfx cards) and also doesn't have a way of detecting if a
mouse button was pressed on a screen.

It also lacks the ability to pick up a section of the screen as a
bob/icon.

So, if anyone has a copy of the int ext V1.3a (full version) then please
send me a copy, please?

See ya.

Well, I have it...somewhere. Ill have a look around for it. I remember
When I got it of Andrew Church, it was about 2years ago, and since then
I have had many a HD crash, so I dunno if I still have it. Ill look for it
later.

When I got it off him, he had got only 4 requests for it that year,
and was considering to make it "unsupported", although afaik he had
stopped writing it a while before then.

If I have it, Ill mail it privately to you.

I think so. No guarantees. Like I said, I dropped it as a usable extension,
mostly because the commands I needed never worked properly (stdi/o).

Hmm, detecting mouse on a screen, you could be right, but gfx cards are
supported, aren't they?

Line Input??

Anybody know a command to get command line input into an Amos program?
Like a .key in a cli-script, you know so your program can be run with
parameters, like

Shell> AmosProg hd:temp/stuff/file

I want the projector for my Anim/Snd prog to be able to take input like
this...
Is there an extension with commands for this??

Thanks,

There is a command line$ command in AMOS, to get you the information pasted
after the actual command is executed. I Think AMCAF has it in too. You
could then use Open In to open the file, and Line Input # to read the data.
Remember to Set Input 10,-1 if it's an ASCII file.

Hi,
After finishing my game, Hooked!! (not yet on aminet, still struggling,
eh), I have thought to write a some kind of pinball construction kit. The
final game should have capability to build pinball tables similar to those
21st Century -games. Do you think I'm mad? At the moment I think so;-),
but I have already seen dreams of it, so maybe I have to try to write it.

What I need to know is what would you like to see in that kind of game or
would you like to see it at all?

Hi Andrew
On the 22-Jun-99 you said something about Re: [amos-list] cool96's bot so now I
am going to offer a witty retort (well maybe :)

PQ: What, Chris Seward AKA AIO editor?
PQ:
PQ: My word, I never would have though!

I've only just started reading this thread. I wouldn't have thought it
either! He seems like a decent bloke to me, and I can't imagine him
handing out Back Orifice. That's normally my job :)

Anyway, I assume you're using an Amiga, Mr. Moller. If so, then he
can't use Back Orifice on you anyway. That's why its dubed the Windoze
Remote Control System. Yes, there is an Amiga port of the Back Orifice
CLIENT, but not of the server. He cannot possibly harm your Amiga
using BO.

If you are using a PC however, it's a different story. But I still
can't imagine Chris doing this. He's a m8 of mine, and I can't figure
out WHY he would want to do that anyway!

As for that one about stealing miami keys, well why would he do that?
There's no point. And he couldn't do it anyway! There isn't a trojan
around that does this. There is Portal Opening 2, which allows you to
control another Amiga remotely, but I know the author of this very
well, and you have to AUTHORISE anything thats done to the remote
server.

So there.

I am actually quite shocked to see what I read and for some reason
don't beleive it either.

I don't recall stealing Mushs keys as the last time I talked to him
i'm sure I was friendly.

It seems all I have done is advertise the #amos channel in AF and
also in AIO so i'm am very disappointed to see that lots of people
have jumped on the band-wagon, people like Martin Møller who does
not know me at all saying this about me and noone has bothered
to ask me.

I have been away from the internet all week so it comes as a big
suprise to me that this has happend.

The person in question does not even own an Amiga so I rarely
talk to him apart from a bit of leg pulling like when he says he
hates me.. funny really.

Oh well I think you should beleive who you want because if noone
will back me up then my confidence has completely dropped in
the lot of you and I hope this could be cleared up as soon as
possible because it is not fair to me what he has said.

I will probably post more on this matter later today when I have
had a chance to get my head around it but if slanderus (sp?)
comments like this is what I am going to get from a PC user then
I'm afraid I may have to reconsider what I do for the Amiga
comunity.

Sorely disappointed.

It think you've got it wrong. The server takes orders from the client.
Hence the word server. To serve.
The client gives orders to do things. So the Amiga port of the client
can order the server to do certain things.

All I said was, someone tried to steal my keys. I did have a backdoor in my
software, and I had to format everything and restart. I dont know who was
behind it, but it's not nice, and I do know it started not too long after
getting files from your bot. As a distributor, you should *always* have a
virus checker running scanning files being both sent and received. I don't
even bother getting any file off IRC (in fact, you're lucky if you see me
on any more) as a lot of my friend's info, such as reg info from AmIRC V2
keyfiles, appear on these crack cheats.

I really think you are getting me confused. My bot has been running
about 1 month and a half and there is no file server, i havn't seen
you on irc for about 6 months to a year so?

How can it started after getting files from my bot, when my bot is
new and doesn't give files?

Hi Chris
On the 26-Jun-99 you said something about Re: [amos-list] cool96's bot so now I
am going to offer a witty retort (well maybe :)

PQ: Sorely disappointed.

I totally agree with you Chris. With you being the editor of AIO, I
cannot see you condoning piracy by attempting to steal someone's
keyfiles. More so, I cannot see you attacking someone's PC, simply
because it is a PC. I am willing to back you up on this. I used to
partake in a spot of this kind of thing (Back Orifice) and I know the
heartache it can cause people. That is why I have stopped.

Not that I'm suggesting you have done it :) I firmly believe that you
haven't.

If this goes to court or summat, lemme know and I'll back u up m8 :)

For the record, I have received quite a few files from Chris, and none
of them were infected by a virus, none contained a trojan of any kind,
and none have done any damage to my computer. So there.

Ermm, hopefully not :)

Well I think this has gotten out of hand. I did send him a file which is
a Pacman game of my friends but as I do not have a PC I asked
someone else who had a PC, namely the person who says his HD
is broke. If this had any virus on them I am VERY sorry because
I did not know but still I can't see it did, as I don't have a PC I
can't tell.

The fact the it ruined a HD is a bit hard to beleive because what
I know of BO it is to get into peoples HDs isn't it? it doesn't
delete them surely?

Last time I send a PC user anything :)

Lastly PC keyfiles would be no use to me, peoples internet accounts
would not as you get FREE internet accounts these days.

Also if I wanted something Amiga I can usually get it as a review copy
so I don'1 see any point me stealing keys. Mosty review stuff goes
straight onto some other editor so why do I not keep it all my self
if I wanted everything. Weird.

Why do you need a trojan to do it ?
You dont. You can give someone a program, which sends certain
files back to you. you canwrite such a prog in amos in about 20secs.

He denys it, but I know you years, and I know your

last year, cos there was another inncodent that
happened then.

You should start coming on IRC again!!!!
#amos is actually busy these days and you could
get to join in the q2 deathmatchs we have :)
Axi runs the server, so if your ever playing
with him, and he is winning or its a draw, and
he knows you cant stay playing for ever, he will
say "he is going to get something to eat", when you
hear that line, *DONT* wait for him to comeback,
cos he will just be killing time, waiting for it
to end. Thats the only way he EVER beats me :)
Speaking of which, I think he is still on this list,
so...

Well, he did get BO from the "PacMon.exe" from which, someone
(Im NOT saying you did this) corrupted his *.exe files. I know
that when the server starts, ie. you go online when you have BO
installed, it sends a msg to the cDc. I remember once, when akky was
on, I was checking if he still had it installed, and one of the cDc
was backdooring him, but they did NOT do any damage, (that he
knows of).

> I don't recall stealing Mushs keys as the last time I talked to him

Well, Ive known mush MANY years, and I dont think he would ever lie,
nor make false claims.

Im not saying you did or didnt do any of that, cos I dont want to
damage your reputation anymore....
But if you remember correctly, there was another person, which
a friend of yours & you did quite a low thing to - back in the
old #am!ga days.

Well you wern't on. I cant say anything about advertising, cos
Ive never read AIO, and I no longer buy AF, I stoped shortly
after it became really low quality. When I pay £8.90 for a mag
I expect more than 50pages.

Speaking of which, I remember you saying "I dont even have a pc...."
on IRC this morning. Since you dont (I believe you there :o)
you couldnt have logged into akky, and corrupted his exe's.

HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
Now thats a underestimation :)
Yous do talk quite a bit, he even knows every time of the week
when you come on iRC. And you have to expect him to hate you,
after all, you did put that (quite horrible) line on your WWW
about him.

Life isnt fair - get used to it :)

hehe.

Seriously, I am the one who noticed he had back orifice,
and I identified the PacMon.exe as been BackOrifice, compied
on Microsoft VisualC++. And you never denied giving him the exe.

HE is a PC user, so what ?!?!?!?
What has pc or amiga got to do with it ?
Where does that come into it ?

This isnt about the PC Vs Amiga war, which is nearly over
unless Amiga gets its act togeather. This is about
you giving a file, to akky, with whom you nolonger
get along with. The file installed BO, from which
his PC was badly damaged.

> I'm afraid I may have to reconsider what I do for the Amiga
> comunity.

No offence, but that line was uncalled for. Its a hollow treat
if ya ask me. If you dont want to be in AIO, then you would
quit anyway, not cos of this issue. If you do want to be in AIO
you wouldnt quit. You should have just wrote - "If anyone mentions
this issue again, Ill quit AIO", cos thats what it portrays.

> Sorely disappointed.

I know its a bad smack to get at that hour of the night.

I dunno if your innocent or not. Although, I would like
to think you are, look at whats pointing against you.
You gave akky a file, which you say a m8 gave you, but
if a m8 gave you it, why the hell would a *M8* of yours
send you a virus ?!?!
As I said, I am the one who identified the file as back orifice,
and I stand by it, it WAS that file which infected him.

But then, on the other hand, why would you infect akky ?
I know yous are arch enemys, but you dont have a pc,
so unless you have linux on yer miggy, it wouldnt have
been worthwhile for you to infect him, cos you cant get
a amiga bo client.

Ill stay judge on this :)
Just like on iRC last night.
*HINT* The judge welcomes donations, so if ya want my snail
addy, mail me privately *HINT*
hehe ;oP

Ah yes, I'm the one to blame. It's good to know that there's at least one or
two people there who are interested in my current project(s);9 I think there
was someone else who also tried to write a pinball-simu'. Haven't heard of
it since...

Release of the ultimate Pinball Construction Kit is closer than you may
think:) The BCK is a one mans project, I'm a terrible slow coder and the
game is mainly done with AMAL . These are quite good reasons why it is
taking so long to complete. Here's a list what I have done and what I should
do before it's free for beta-testing:

Ready:
-Table independent ball-routine - 50 frames/sec, of course:D
-Tables size 320x512 with 32 colours - palette may have to be locked:/
-Flippers, kickers, targets/drop targets, ramps, switches, buttons and
lamps - gRoOVyyY...
-Scoreboard - will be animated

Soon to be:
-Bumbers, lockers - are there anything else?
-Sound - this is problematic: I've only got Amos1.36 so it may have support
only for old ST-format for music. Any suggestions?
-Multi-ball support(?)
-Editor - it's a construction kit u know;D
-Anything else? Feel free to suggest...

All kind of mental support is welcome,

While I politicaly refuse to get involved with the rest of the thread,
I'll just point this out.

Acually, it doesnt send anything to cDc.. BO alone just runs all the time,
it's up to people to find your IP and portscan to see if it's running.

However there are certain wrappers that you can place around BO which send
a e-mail
(or ICQ) to whatever address the person who inserted BO into the exe
nominated.
So just pointing out it wouldn't have been someone from cDc, rather just
the lamer who
infected the program.

I have heard about doing that, but it DOES also send stuff to cDc,
Im pretty sure it does, cos the guys nick (I forget it now)
when he was talking to me, was one of the cDc.

hehe :o)

Ok, It was 3-3 in a match, he said "Ive got to go and get something
to eat", then about 5mins later he came back. Snuck up behind me,
then said "back" and shot me straight away, cos he knew I had to go
then. "4-3" is close, but "4-1" isnt, cos i slaughtered you in that
match. 2 of them with my BFG, one of them with the BFG at poing blank ;o)

Now, you tell us all about the "4-1" complete beating I gave you.

Hi Everybody,

I have my bomberman clone going nicely, but I still can't really decide
on a decent name for it, so maybe you guys can help out:

So far, I have:

· Blast Radius

· Blast Force

· Bomber Blaster

· Demolition Man (um, actually I think that name' s taken! dang)

· Maximum Force


So, whats your preference, or perhaps you can think of a better one? please?

Amiga audio hardware (aka Paula) is limited to playing
samples maximum length 131000 (or so). Any longer and
it plays the length MOD 131000, so for just over it
plays only a short part.

Solution: split the sample into several pieces
Solution: resample the sound an octave up (loss of
quality)

(If you use audio.device with iorequests (as in
AmigaOS
and not AMOS ;) then double buffering is really easy,
but the rest of the coding isn't)


Good luck

Nononono, it does NOT!
I just ran a copy and monitored the TCP/IP traffic through my firewall, and
the only signal
it sent was to the address I embedded in the wrapper.
I've dealt with BO before, it's part of my job :P
It doesnt notify the cDc.. unless that particular version was wrapped by
one of the cDc.

Forget modules. Use only sampled music as jingles. They will give an

Small anims when player scores something significant.

Does anybody have a formula/algorithm for plotting perfect(ish) circles?

I've tried several I found on the net (well.. they were vector rotation
algorithms, but that shouldn't really matter), and
none of them come close to the circles amos or turboplus produce...

I found a book with loads of raster algorithms ages
ago, I think it was called Fundamentals of Interactive
Computer Graphics (may be Principals instead of
Fundamentals).

I think I noted down the more useful ones, I'll check
to see if the circle (or ellipse) is one of them.

I you haven't heard from me in a week then I haven't
got it...

why join them with lines when you can simply plot every single point from the

But you might have gaps between some points if you make it too big...


By the way, what is wrong with amos' circle command? Do you want to do
something more with it then just draw it?

See ya.

well, suite yourself. if you drew a line you could problaby get away with
just 20-30 points on a smaller circle (speed may not be much of an issue,
but you don't want to wait hours while it draws a circle ;)

Ah, you're after splines then. I think there are some extentions that can
draw those (um, is it in Amcaf or turbo? I've seen it in one of those.)

Ah yes, I developed some rotating/scaling line vector routines a while
back. Havn't really done anything with them since ;(

See ya.

Hard Disks

Tue Jun 29, 1999 6:11 pm
"Eric" <eric_molyneux@lineone.net>


Hi! Knowledgeable ones,
Old Wrinkly here again.
QUESTION 1 - I have 2 hard disks (internal ones) is it okay to couple
the two of them and have them read as one drive.
QUESTION 2 - Is there an exterior lead that I can use on an internal
type hard disk, so that I can put it in a separate holder and use it from
one of the ports. That way I can use it as a mobile storage.
QUESTION 3 - Is it possible to use a PC internal type hard disk on an
Amiga.
Thanks In Advance

You can use them together, but not as one drive. They are still two
seperate drives. Don't forget to set one to master and one to slave (unless
its SCSI, I presume they're IDE drives right?)

> QUESTION 2 - Is there an exterior lead that I can use on an internal

You could do it anyway if you had a long enough lead, just have to leave
the case open. Long leads sometimes cause problems though, and don't forget
that HD's don't like being moved around, off or not. Maybe you should look
at a ZIP etc.

> QUESTION 3 - Is it possible to use a PC internal type hard disk on an

There is no such thing as a 'PC' hard drive. Most fall into 2x2 main
catogries: IDE/SCSI and 2.5"/3.5"

All you have to worry about is if you need an IDE or SCSI drive, as both
the 2.5" and 3.5" drives fit into an A1200/4000 etc. (although for a small
amiga like an A1200 its a good idea to get a smaller 2.5" drive)

See ya.

Well, in January I brilliantly passed my Geometry exam, so I think I
should share my enormous knowledge with you ;-)
Here's an example which should be quite close to what you need:

Degree
R=50 : XC=100 : YC=100
' R = Radius; XC,YC = coords of the center of the circle
' A is the angle: I prefer using degrees ;-)
For A=0 To 360
Plot XC+R*Cos(A),YC+R*Sin(A)
Next

' If you have Amcaf or any other fast extension you can use Turbo Plot
' or something similar instead of Plot

Paolo

No, you cant access 2 drives as 1.

No, unless its a SCSI HD. With a IDE you wouldnt have a long enough cable.
and if you got one, you would get to much interference on the cable,
unless you screened each one of the 40 ribbons. which would be WAYYYYYY
to much hastle

PC hd ?
A hard disk is a hard disk, theres no machine pacific ones. You might
need a 2.5" to 3.5" cable converter for a standard drive. (assuming
the standard to be 3.5" IDE)

Theres 2 worthwhile ways of doing this. You could use
Bresnhams midpoint algorithm, its fastest, and quite accurate.
Or Sin/Cos combined.

I remember I searched the WWW for Bresnhams one a while back,
only his line one seems to be floating around.
To do it in Sin/Cos, you will need to also use a line algorithm,
(use bresnhams, none other comes close, Ive got it if you want it)
With it, (for a ellipse) you do a:

' This presumes R1 and R2 is the radius, and you have a LINE procedure
' for your points array. and CX and CY are the center coords

PX = R1
PY = R2

Degree
For A = 0 To 90

S = Sin(A)
C = Cos(A)

X = C * R1
Y = S * R2

'Get the points in a line between the points.
LINE[CX+PX,CY+PY,CX+X,CY+Y]
LINE[CX-PX,CY+PY,CX-X,CY+Y]
LINE[CX+PX,CY-PY,CX+X,CY-Y]
LINE[CX-PX,CY-PY,CX-X,CY-Y]

PX = X
PY = Y

Next A

<end>

Of course, if you need circles only, you can make it
calculate only to 45 degrees, and add in 4 more
calls to the "LINE" procedure.

Its quite a while since I coded amos, so I dunno
if this will work directly, it should :oP

These circles are not *PERFECTLY* round, but they do look
it once the radius isnt somthing like 10000.

Or, for a more faster, more accurate routine, you should use
bresnhams algorithm, the above one isnt nearly as accurate
as it. If you want Ill code it for you also in amos.

That routine will work HORRIBLY SLOW!!!!
Your not taking advantage of circles been so geometric.
Also, what if the radius is about 200 ? Youll just end up
with a bunch of dots, in a circluar shape with there
been spaces between each dot.

If you get the right leads, it'll work no prob. If its a 3.5" drive
you'll have to take the kinda stretched out U shaped thing that the
keyboard rests on (the drive bay) and squeeze it under the keyboard. It
will fit though, I've got one in mine ;)

Hi

I found the algorithm for drawing a circle, here it is
in
pseudo-code. I haven't actually tested this, but it
should
work. It is Michener's algorithm, from

"Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics"
(c) 1982-3 J D Foley, A van Dam.

(This book has everything - from low level line
drawing up
to raytracing.)

All variables are integers. Just don't ask me how the
thing
actually works...

-->8--------------------------------------------------------

procedure circle(cx, cy, radius, pen)
// consider the first 1/8 of the circle
x = 0
y = radius
d = 3 - 2 * radius
while x < y
circlepoints(cx, cy, x, y, pen)
if d < 0
d = d + 4 * x + 6
else
d = d + 4 * (x - y) + 10
y = y - 1
endif
x = x + 1
endwhile
if x = y then circlepoints(cx, cy, x, y, pen)
endprocedure

procedure circlepoints(cx, cy, x, y, pen)
// plot 8 points on the circle, by symmetry
plot(cx + x, cy + y, pen)
plot(cx + x, cy - y, pen)
plot(cx - x, cy + y, pen)
plot(cx - x, cy - y, pen)
plot(cx + y, cy + x, pen)
plot(cx + y, cy - x, pen)
plot(cx - y, cy + x, pen)
plot(cx - y, cy - x, pen)
endprocedure

-->8--------------------------------------------------------

Anyway, why do you need to draw circles? Why not use
the OS
functions directly - they should be the fastest.

Good luck anyway.

Claude
