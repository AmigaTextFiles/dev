LAND OF MAGIC
The Resurrection

At the dawn of time the four Godbrothers Zol, Orix, Ze & Kara created the world called Nexon. On it they founded mountains, sea, land and animals.
#
Zol:

The oldest and the wisest of the four brothers. He created the animal kingdom Zologs, which was a very advanced and intelligent animal species.

Some of these advanced animals had a more developed brain, and later they developed into great incantators.
#
Orix:

The most beautiful of the four brothers. His beauty was so great, that an ordinary mortal would parish by looking at him.

He created the animals Orioxes, which was a very beautiful and peaceful species. These animals were vegetarians, who would never hurt another creature. He also made a very beauteous environment where they should be left in peace for all eternity.
*


This species had eternal life, and lived seperated from creations of the other Gods.
#
Ze:

The strongest one of the four Gods. The animals he created were called Zedians. These animals were very large and very strong. Being predatory animals, they never hesitated to kill when necessary. They lived from what nature offered, and their average age was approximately 50 years.
#
Kara:

The mightiest and the most powerseeking of the four brothers. He wanted the entire world for himself, so he produced the desperately feared animals: the Karaonian. They were horrible and deformed creatures, whose purpose was to kill the species of the other Gods.
*


Due to their atrocity, the entire land where they lived had been transformed into a dry desert, where neither plants, nor animals could live. Their average age: 30 years.
#
Zol's animals joined with Orixe's and Ze's to be able to defend themselves against the expected evil attack from the Karaonians. When the battle had begun, the God Kara joined his army as a human character. The war continued for several thousand years, and meanwhile the animals developed into human beings.

Zol wanted to end this war, so he appointed the greatest of the Zolog's incantators; Androz, and said to him:
*


"When the night falls, you shall go to the mountain of Zol, where you will see two falling stars. Take them and make a blade from one of them, and a helve from the other. Then seize power as king of your country and lead your hosts against the Karaonians. With this sword you will even be able to kill Kara."
#



Androz did what his master had told him. He went to the mountain at night, and he saw the two falling stars. With his great power he created an exquisite sword, which was so grandiose that it was glowing with strength.
*


He then lead his army against the Karaonians, and he met Kara himself at the Leta Valley. Kara laughed at Zol when he first saw who was going to fight him, for Kara being a majestic God and Androz had been nothing compared to him.
#



But when Androz lifted sword to fight Kara, he flinched, for the sword Androz held being so mighty and powerful. Androz and Kara fought for many hours, and in the meantime the world was dark.
#


Finally the sword was too powerful for Kara, and Androz struck with all his strength at Kara's body. Kara, who was still conscious when this happened, parried with his grand sword, the Sozia. But the strike from Androz had been more powerful than anything in the world. Kara dropped the Sozia, and Androz sword cut the left arm of the God.
#
Kara then released his anger towards his brothers, and he annihilated Androz and his hosts with his enormous willpower.

Kara, who now was very vulnerable and exhausted, retired with his army and settled down in his underground caves at home in Karaonia, where he also hid the sword that took his arm.
*

The Karaonians were still a very evil people, but after their ruler had gone underground to sleep for all eternity, they didn't dare to fight the other nations and their Gods.
#

But once again there would be war in the world, and this due to that Zol's disciple Zodi had left the good path to take charge over the Karaonians.

Zol was very disappointed by his disciple, and told Androz's kindred, Iz, that he would have to find the sword and destroy both Zodi and Kara.
*

For the legend says, that only a relation of Androz is able to lift the sword and face the majestic God Kara, who will rewake when Androz's kindred holds the magic sword.
#
Iz makes for the land of Karaonia to get the sword and to destroy his powerful opponents.

This is where Your adventure starts. For You are the chosen one.

You are Iz!
