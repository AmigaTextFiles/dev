Of course YES :)
Go to dev/amos on any Aminet mirror, and get short proc gtt.lha (made in Poland :) )

All the Best for all Amos/Amiga users in 1997 !

Sure.  Copyright still exists.  But who do you pay royalties to ?  And if
no-one is selling, no-one gets royalties.  So the author doesn't get paid
either way.  Net resulting difference between not-spreading and spreading
software:  More people get a copy, and the authors name lives forever.

> Spread the software and break the law.

True.  ..but look at how many old programs have been put into the PD now..

Yes!  There is a solution.... trash it and use the GUI Extension :))) INTOS
isn't an extension!! but a very LAME piece of software!!! There are several
choices:

- Gui Extension         (contact me! or Aminet -> dev/amos/GuiExt15.lha)
- JWindows Extension    (F1 Licenceware)
- Intution Extension    (Andrew Church)
- Os Dev Kit            (Blitter Soft)


INTOS is VERY, VVVEEERRRYYY LAME!! Don't use it any more!!!

Greetings.

I have recently come across a fellow Amos-er's homepage with an Amos 
routine that is supposed to map a texture onto the face of a ball. 
His links were all screwed up, thus I was unable to download it. I am 
interested in the file if anyone knows where I could locate it. It 
would greatly help me in coding my 3D engine.

"BALLMAP.AMOS" is the filename btw. Thanks.

Amos Pro went to 2.00, which is the version updated by the compiler.

I've heard there is a version that doesn't require a 68k and WB1.3, but am
unable to locate an update.

Not so. AMOS Professional was the last publically-released version of 
AMOS, and its version number was 2.00.

To my knowledge, there is no update. What you have is the only 
version of AMOS 3D that was released. I own a copy as well, and I too 
get the ugly flicker every now and then. Bummer, eh?

Yes, that would have been the classy thing to do, the way the Tuckers who
edited the licenceware disk mag Totally AMOS declared on their final issue that
all issues were now PD.

Yup, Paul's right ... I just don't know how hard dead ppl chase you, especially
when they show no interest in retaining the rights.

All the commercial AMOS stuff is now out of print except for the Pro Compiler
sold by F1 Licenceware in the UK (hi Steve), and it looks like it will all
become hobbyist stuff like the Atari software.  So what's the answer here? ...
we have some ppl still interested in continuing with AMOS, and yet all the AMOS
stuff except the Compiler can no longer be bought.

An old story, the sysop on this server is El Cheapo, and won't register it even
tho' he uses it as his Editor.  We've tried, but he seems immune to shame.

Happy New Year everyone,

When I use 'Read Text' in a program it all works fine when I start the program,
I use 'Key state' to get to 'read text' and the text is displayed.
But the funny thing is that  when I start the same program a second time
without quitting AmosPro the text displayer pops up at the start of the
program....

Is there some way to avoid that?

I guess its saved to some memorybank...its even displayed if I remove it from
the program...

U are wrong :)

But try example like this to get yout text on display:

Clear Key : rem to clear keyboard cache buffer
Do
K$=Inkey$ : KY=Scancode
if K$<>"' : Exit : EndIf
Loop

If KY=80 : rem F1 pressed
KY=-1:rem very important
Read Text Fsel$("**") : rem ... or give here path to your text file instead Fsel$
EndIf

Regards

Hi everyone,
Know the zoom command in AmosPro? Slow isn`t it! Does anybody know a 
better way to "zoom" a part of one screen to another screen to half its 
original size? I have an ASM bank which can magnify but it won`t reduce, 
would anyone be willing to code one which can reduce? Or if not is there 
a faster way to do it using Amos?

Thanks in advance!

I have got it. If you want I can send you in MIME format, but privately and
not on this list: someone could be not interested in it.

on the subject of Amos 3D.

I believe there was a little misunderstanding. I was referring to the 
Object Modeller, NOT the 3D library. I own both Pro and the Pro 
Compiler, and I know of the update to the 3D library. I was talking 
about the ugly flicker that you encounter with the old Object 
Modeller that was released with Amos 3D.

I`m not sure exactly what you want here but I think if you read th 
section on icons and blocks in the manual or other books it should help
Send me a more detailed description and I`ll see if I can help

Use TIMER to see how much time has elapsed (it counts from 0 when the prog
starts and goes up 50 counts each second) See about it in the manual
As a rule I don`t like to use it but if you want the clock to count in 
seconds you could use something like
EVERY 50 GOSUB clock
where clock is a subroutine that updates the clock, make sure to have 
EVERY ON just before the RETURN
Don`t use INPUT as it halts the program, write your own (if you have 
problems, again give us a shout)

Hope this helps! (Probably not!!)

Greetings fellow AMOSers.

The coding for my 3D engine has temporarily come to a halt and I 
am unable to continue with it until I find a more efficient way to 
code it. If anyone has some AMOS code they have finished or have 
worked on relating to texture mapping or 3D graphics of the sort, 
and do not mind for me using it (you'll be credited for the help) in 
my engine, please e-mail me and we'll work something out. I would 
GREATLY appreciate anyone who could render some help regarding
this matter. Thanks again. Long live the Amiga!

Check out my web page. I have some 3D code there for a PC under the PC
section. You may be able to convert it. Otherwise there is a link on my
home page to another page that actually has some amos 3D code.

on the problems with the 2 URLs you may use to reach my site.

Due to this request, and the many problems with frame-compatibility 
(still!) with many browsers, including Amiga based ones, I have 
decided since my site is still young, and frames for now just won't 
work, that I will be taking off them off and re-doing the design 
and look of site. I have considered this for some time, but because 
of the holidays I have'nt yet got around to it yet. I assure you 
though, that within 2 weeks the site should be up again with a new 
look and feel. Much better than what's on there now, I hope!

For those of you who still wish information on the projects I am 
working on, I will leave my product pages on until I totally redo the 
site. You may access them directly using the following URL:

http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/6116/fr-products.htm

I also have one more question. Anyone with an A1200 or A4000, or 
maybe even someone with one of the newestly-released Amigas on this 
list, will AMOS run on it? I program on an A3000 with 1meg chip, 
8 extra, with 2.1 and an '030 25. I also own an A2000, loaded, with 
an '040 25. I am curious though as to whether or not AMOS will run 
well on Workbench 3.0/3.1 or on a new A1200 or A4000. Anyone here 
please e-mail me with some specifics on if AMOS runs, and if it does, 
what (if any) complications do you have.

Also remember, ALL 3D coders (AMOS coders PLEASE, C code welcome), 
if you have or know of any texture-mapping, raycasting, etc. code 
anywhere I could use in my 3D engine develpoment, PLEASE by all means 
e-mail me and if I use it (I probably will if it's good enough), I'll 
credit you in my upcoming game. I stress this note with GREAT 
importance, as I need to continue the coding on my engine. The sooner 
I get it done, the sooner I can release it. Spread this note around!

Long live the Amiga!

A1200 and A4000 are not *NEW*, I think!
They are about four years old! Really new are the german
"Amiga Based"-Computers from EAGLE! Amiga 1500 and A5000 I mean!
Or the DRACO-Video-Computer! After all, Phase5 comes with the
POWER-AMIGA in the first quarter of this year!

AMOS makes no complications on A1200, A4000, Workbench 3.0 or Workbench 3.1!
I tested a compiled programm on the Draco, but it doesn´t work! I am working on
this and the grafik-board-problem. I am writing a programm, that makes it possible
to run AMOS-Programms on those machines.

>Also remember, ALL 3D coders (AMOS coders PLEASE, C code welcome), 
>if you have or know of any texture-mapping, raycasting, etc. code 

There exists a compiled AMOS-Programm called "AMRWolf". It has
a great looking 3D-routine! Very fast and with many animations!
I tried to contact the coder, but he seems not to exist ;-))

Adam, perhaps you have more luck. Do you know this programm,
or should I e-mail it to you?

>Long live the Amiga!

Forever!

I'm using WB3.1 on an a500/020. The only 3.1 related bug is the interlace
screen thing. Interlace screens don't actually show interlaced, but, if you
open a regular screen on half the screen and an interlace screen on the other
half, it seems to work.

Well met and godspeed,

Hi, I have a A4000 030 from about 1992-3. It has 2meg chip and 16 meg fast
In general Amos !.34 and Amos Pro 2.00 and Pro Compiler work fine, but 
there are a few quirks.
- Screens of width less than 200 are distorted horribly
- The memory indicator in the Ed and Direct mode say I have no free fast mem
- Very few extensions work perfectly (I`m not sure if this is their fault 
or Amos`)
- These include INTos, Craft, Turbo +, COOLStars

None of these problems happen on my A500 ,but it has only 1 meg , no hard 
drive and is slow , so guess which one i use for AMOS!

I noticed that someone mentioned the AMWolf engine, I agree its good
I think he used Amos but the calculations are done in Asembler
I have a guide file about 3d engines if you dont have it, its on the 
AMInet somewhere but I cant remember where, I`ll send it to you if you want
Best of luck with the game!

Hi everyone!
I was just wondering has anybody succeeded in making the AmosPro Editor 
look nice using the resource editor? I have changed it completely but I`m 
getting bored with it, anyone want to swap?

I`ve heard rumors about the AMCaf extension. Is it good? Where can I get it?

Sorry I know I`ve asked already: does anyone know a faster way to reduce 
a portion of one screen to another screen without using ZOOM command?

Also to make a game NTSC compatible is it okay to have the screen height 
just at 200, or is there more I must do?

Read ya soon!

Greetings all.

Geez! It's unbelieveable the enormous response I've recieved from my
recent digest I sent to the list! Keep it coming, though!

Here's some more information on everyone's recent mailings:

>From Benjamin Asen:

I am aware of this. I was originally referring to the Power Amigas
that will be released later this quater when I said "new."

The base reason I inquired whether or not Amos (Pro) would run or
compile on an accelerated or more recent Amiga was the factor in my
decision to continue using Amos or pack it up and turn to C. I realize
C is flexible and will run on most platforms, not sure whether Amos
would, including the new Power Amigas which are due soon. Though I
like C (it converts easily between PC and Amiga as well), Amos just
has an ease of use, as something in C would take longer to code than
in Amos. A program like Mr. Asen would DEFINITELY benifit the
programming community, myself included. If we had a program of the
such, it would gaurantee Amos running on any type of Amiga, from new
to old.

Many other people asked this of me.

Yes, I am aware of this program. I have it, as a matter of fact. I
located a copy of it several months ago. I cannot run it, however, as
I still run an ECS on both of my Amiga's (2000 and 3000), and it is an
AGA program! :(

Which, while I'm on the subject, real quick let me ask another 
question: I have been considering an upgrade to AGA for sometime. I am
not sure about buying ANOTHER Amiga (I have 3) just yet, and if I do
it would be the new Amigas that will be unveiled soon. I thought about
a new gfx-board such as Picasso II or Cybergfx. I am entertaining
offers, as I am willing to purchase an almost new or used gfx board at
a reasonable price. If you think you are interested in selling, please
e-mail me.Anything like that would help in my program development.

One more, from Matt Ward:

> Is it good? Where can I get it?

I never explored all of AMCaf's features or abilities, but it is a
good extension and I did use it for awhile. You can download the
shareware version (I think it's shareware) from Aminet.

also he wrote:

I know of nothing like what you want. I'm sure something like that
could be developed (maybe in a new version of Turbo Plus if it had
been continued), easily in Asm or C I'm sure. I'm not sure you could
get a much faster command anyways because of the "slowness" of some of
the ways the Amiga does it's gfx.

I repeat my request on 3D source code. Any texture-mapping routines
(or anything along those lines), please do e-mail them to me on send a
link to where I can download them. Thanks again everyone!

Long live the Amiga!

And you need to adjust any timing loops to use 60 instead of 50, since the PAL
timing is 50 jiffies/sec and NTSC is 60.

AMCAF is probably the best and the most useful extension for AmosPro. It runs
just with AmosPro (no The Creator) and it has whatever you need: special
effects, fast replacements, tracker support, font support and much, much
more!!! It is shareware: you can get the demo version on Aminet in dev/amos.
The demo is fully working, but it cannot be compiled: means you can test it
as much as you want before registering.

I have a routine to enlarge a section of one screen to another , it is an 
ASM bank which unfortunately I know zip about.  For the Amos ZOOM command 
to reduce the same area to a half is four times slower than the ASM so I 
had hoped somebody had (or could code) another ASM program to reduce 
graphics.

That's not a problem of any kickstart. place the screen a bit more to the

Yup. This started when I got myself more than 8 (?) megs of fast mem.

AMCAF works well on my Amiga aswell.

  I think you may have visited my page, sorry about the links not working
  but I set the page up the day I left uni for the christmas holidays and
  didn`t have time to fix it :(

  Anyway, the program BALLMAP.AMOS (or whatever it was called ;) is sort of
  a funny program, it uses the zoom command on an irregular shape stored as
  points in an array and scaled the lines accordingly instead of
  calculating each point out (that would be FAR to slow, or perhaps it can
  be done with lotsa pre-calc...hmmm ;)  Anyway, if you want to know how to
  mapping onto balls etc I may be able to upload an old C file (it was
  written for a PC but the documentation is pretty good) which does it far
  better!

  Sorry about the time it took to reply but I only got back today :)  And
  many thanx for visiting my web-site!

Hi,

I'm trying to incorporate samples into my game but an beginning to realise
how limited the Amos Pro language is in this area.

How can I test for when a sample has stopped playing?

Is it possible to have a sample playing continously (ie looped) on one voice
and while this is happening, play an unlooped sample on another voice?

Also, the sample bank editor seems to muck up the samples when it grabs the
bank from the program in memory. Its ok when you load it from disk.

Any help is much appreciated.

Please e-mail me any responses as I am not subscribed to the list.

Cheers,
        Mark

Happy New Year! Christmas hols are over, and I'm back on this list, and
already I've got a question:

I seem to remember an Assembler for AMOS where you entered you Assembly
progs as strings and then you called a procedure that executed the code.
Anyone got a copy or can tell me where to get it? (it's not on the
Aminet as far as I can tell) Or does anyone know of a suitable
alternative solution?

The version I have (1.34), does not run very well. But the 1.36, (which
I have now), runs quite right on my A1200.

  A few days ago I got hold of a utility that converts Imagine objects to
  another binary format giving easier access to all the points and faces. I
  wrote the 3d routine in AMOS and used the binary data to draw the objects
  and faces, my problem with it now is hidden face ellimination on inconvex
  objects... Doing it on the convex objects is quite easy so i can have
  spheres, cubes etc but when I use toruses and irregular objects like
  models of the Enterprise(!) the faces obviosly get muddled(I use only the
  most technical jargon ;)   So... does anybody know how to solve this
  nasty problem, any help would be MUCH appreciated.
  Oh, almost forgot, the faces are in clockwise order when they are saved

  If you want to get hold of the object converter it`s on the Aminet
  somewhere, can`t quite remember the name but I think it`s in the 3d/
  drawer.

  I have just read a post concerning setting colours in dual-playfield mode
  (sorry it`s taken so long to reply but, it`s Christmas!). Anyway I think
  the problem can be solved by setting the colours for the second screen as
  the colours 8-16(or is it 15?) when you set up the first screen, at least
  that`s how I rember doing it.,I think  :-?

Hello: Matt Ward & AmosListers

Matt you wanted to know if their was anything you needed to do to make a
PAL game run in NTSC other then using a ___,200 screen, and Mr. Giark wrote
that you need to adjust the timing. I do not think it is necessary to 
adjust the timing in all cases, because some games like Q-Bic & Bloodfest
seam to run just fine in NTSC the only problem with those games is that you
cant see the bottom of the screen. As for the ___,200 screen mode this is
also probably not necessary to as the Amiga is not a stinking PC, and dos
not need ugly black borders. The Amiga has the ability to run in OVERSCAN
screen modes and Amos screen are OVERSCAN screens, so to get your game to
run on a NTSC Amiga why not do what the people who wrote Guardian for the
CD32 did which is to let the NTSC user move the PAL screen to the top of
the PAL OVERSCAN area. To do this use the ( Screen Display number,x,y,
width,height ) command increasing y lowers the screen decreasing y raises
the screen y normally is 40. NTSC OVERSCAN is ___,241 , as a guide this is
from the top of the bridge monitor screen to the bottom of the Star Wheel
in Tobias Trek, Also keep in mined that the monitors are not perfectly 
quare they are bent around the edges. The monitor shrunk in to show the
NTSC overscan area will show 5 lines up from the top of the  bridge screen, 
and 5 lines down from the bottom of the Star Wheel.

                Hope this saves you from to much unnecessary conversion.

Would using a music tune with one sample playing help?
 
I`m also having some head scratching sessions over samples...
You all know WORMS, the way it has a load of samples which you can change 
simply by replacing the files on disk, is this possible with AMOS (Pro)

I guess from your 'subject' heading that you already know this, but all
you have to do is work out the distance of all the faces from you (the
camera). You can do this by adding up Z values. Then all you have to do
is sort these numbers (a simple bubble sort will do for starters) so
that the largest (furthest away) come first. You then draw each of the
faces in the order they are now stored in the sorted list. Easy. The
only problem is speed; the AMOS polygon routine just isn't fast enough;
unless, of course, you're not going for a real-time routine. Still, best
of luck...

There are two problems with that. First, on NTSC machines, y is 50, not 40.
Second, maximum overscan that AMOS will show is 234. (My wb screen is
overscanned to 241 (482 interlace actually), but AMOS won't go that far. To
show the maximum possible height on NTSC, you need to do the following:

Screen Open 1,640,234,16,Hires
Screen Display 1,128,26,640,234

I've experimented a lot with this and that's the maximum I can get on the
screen. BUT!

Why not add a couple lines to your PAL program that offers NTSC users the
ability to switch modes? It only takes a couple lines of code and anyone with
a 1Meg Agnus or AGA can do it.

A=Peek(Leek(4)+530)
If A=60
  Print "Switch to PAL (y/n)?"
  A$=""
  PAL:
  Do
    A$=Inkey$
    If A$=""
      Loop
    Endif
    A$=Lower$(A$)
    If A$="y"
      Doke $DFF1DC,$20
      Poke Leek(4)+530,50
      _SCREEN_HEIGHT=256
      _TIMING=50
      Goto _PROGRAM_BEGINS
    Endif
  If A$<>"n"
    Goto PAL
  Endif
Endif

Yes. For code, try examining the sample bank maker program that comes with
amos, as it is written in amos. You'd just have to write a routine to search
the disk dir for the sample names and compile them into a bank. Quite simple
really.

EME (Enhanced Music Extension) lets you do this easily for each channel.

above extension also allows that :)  And tracker music can be playing too.

huh?

   There is a site, on that huge great computery thing, which is indeed 
AMOS related (so don't worry).

   From there you can download a game, a game for 2 players, a game where 
the object is to kill the other player...so it's gotta be good then eh?

   You can also download a demo of a game written in AMOS...a platformer. 
It uses a rather nifty little AMAL routine for a real-time timer (!) 
aswell as a nice scrolly which has been a topic of discussion recently on 
the list.

   The source code is available for the first game and I am willing to 
divulge the tricks and tips of the demo should anyone be interested.

   There is also a lot of non-AMOS AMIGA stuff...so check it out.

So...I know what you are thinking!...

    a) Who the hell is this guy anyway?

and b) Where is this site then, cos I might just get around to taking a look.

Well...allow me to enlighten you...

a) Me. I'm Rich (or simply RMS). I admit that I haven't written much to 
the list...but I pay close attention. I have helped a few of you but only 
on a one-to-one basis. 'cos I'm shy.

b) Do you REALLY *REALLY* **REALLY** want to know??...Okay then...

   http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ma4rms/home.html

or you can go straight to the AMIGA page...

   http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ma4rms/amiga.html

(Hardly surprising that second one eh?)

Do let me know of any comments or suggestions that you might have!

Enjoy!

Long live the AMIGA...but don't be too harsh on the ole PC.

I'll get my coat.

Rich

P.S. Cowards rule...if that's okay with you.

Hi there. I was away for a short time, but am now back, sorta. Im sorry for
all the people who emailed me about the FTP site not working.

Im now in USA, and have brought my British Amiga with me. Ive ordered an
American powerpack for it, but will I need anything else to run my PAL
miggie here? It is supposed to be able to switch itself between PAL and NTSC
but most of my software is set to PAL. Does AMOS auto-set itself to NTSC if
it detects?

Im using a PC until my powerpack arrives, and telnetting my demon account.
Please let me know if I need anything else.

Hello: Matt Ward & AmosListers

I'm sorry I was wrong the WB can display more of a PAL screen then Amos can.
max monitor 234 or 0 to 233
max TV      231 or 0 to 230

Mr. Giark is also right that NTSC Y is 50, but PAL Y is 40, and because
your game is PAL Y should be set to 40 to maintain a normal PAL screen.

Mr. Giarks suggestion that you should offer NTSC users the opportunity to
run you game in PAL is ok as an option for people that like running their
games on their monitors.

I prefer to run my games on my 35' SVHS TV with external speakers that make
my windows rattle, and NTSC TVs no longer have the ability to run in PAL.

231 lines should be more then a enough room to get games like Q-Bic &
Bloodfest to run on a NTSC Amiga like Guardian for the CD32 does.

                          What kind of game are you converting?

Greetings!

Anyone familiar with the recent complaints about my sites frames and 
the URL problems? NO MORE! (If you don't know about this, then you 
should 1. read your mail more often, or 2. frequent my site more! hee 
hee, just kidding). The old pages have been removed, and the new 
grand graphics, pages, and feel of Amiga is being reconstructed. I'm 
estimating I should have the site ready for upload around 0500 GMT 
Sunday morning (or midnight Saturday here in the States). Please 
spread the word around about this.. well, cool and wonderful site of 
programming and Amiga pleasure!

I also feel the need to repeat one of my earlier requests again. I 
still run an old ECS Agnus on both of my Amigas, and I'm considering 
an upgrade to AGA, but I need a gfx board for that. Anyone who knows 
where I could locate either an almost new or used (good condition), 
Cybergfx is what I'm looking for, please e-mail me.

Long live the Amiga!

And where do you find that? My search on Aminet after EME only gave me
ExtremeAMOS. Or search for enhanced and the extension show up, for Blitz2.

                             AMOS With The CD32
                                     by
                             C. Edward Stewart
                            (joehick@golden.net)
                               (IRC: Giark)

Whether or not you happen to have a CD32, you may have access to a CD32
joypad.  With it, you have the option of programming a lot more neat options
(because it has a lot of buttons).  There have been several different
programs out there to read the CD32 joypad, but they all lack in one way or
another.  Here's my procedure that does it:

Procedure PAD
CD=0 : CD32=0
Lib Open 1,"lowlevel.library",40
Dreg(0)=1
CD=Lib Call(1,-30)
Lib Close 1
If CD and 1 Then CD32=CD32+%1
If CD and 2 Then CD32=CD32+%10
If CD and 4 Then CD32=CD32+%100
If CD and 8 Then CD32=CD32+%1000
If CD and 131072 Then CD32=CD32+%10000
If CD and 262144 Then CD32=CD32+%100000
If CD and 524288 Then CD32=CD32+%1000000
If CD and 1048576 Then CD32=CD32+%10000000
If CD and 2097152 Then CD32=CD32+%100000000
If CD and 4194304 Then CD32=CD32+%1000000000
If CD and 8388608 Then CD32=CD32+%10000000000
End Proc[CD32]

To use this procedure, you'll need to get the lowlevel.library (and a CD32
joypad) if you don't have it.  Now, the procedure is nice, but without the
code to use it, it's just so many cool AMOS commands.

Do
PAD=0
PAD : PAD=Param
If PAD and 1 Then PAD_RIGHT
If PAD and 2 Then PAD_LEFT
If PAD and 4 Then PAD_DOWN
If PAD and 8 Then PAD_UP
If PAD and 16 Then PAD_PAUSE
If PAD and 32 Then PAD_REWIND
If PAD and 64 Then PAD_FASTFORWARD
If PAD and 128 Then PAD_GREEN
If PAD and 256 Then PAD_YELLOW
If PAD and 512 Then PAD_RED
If PAD and 1024 Then PAD_BLUE
Loop

This loop checks all the buttons and acts on them.  If you want different
buttons to be sensed sooner, move them up on the list.  I've got all the
different buttons labeled as procedures, but you could use Goto's or
commands just as easily.  The code above just shows you what values
represent which buttons.

Most CD32s don't have keyboards attached, so don't put places in your
program for users to type unless you use some sort of CD32 joypad procedure
to get the characters.  Say something like the one below.

Procedure CD32_TEXT

To use the text procedure use the following code:

CD32_TEXT : IN$=Param$

CD32 joypad up and down scroll through the letters.  Blue advances a
character.  Red deletes a character.  Green terminates input.  The
parameter in IN$ will contain the text entered by the user.

With these procedures, you can write AMOS programs that can be included on
CD32 coverdisk CDs.  Also, you can have access to all those neat buttons on
the CD32 joypad.

You may be wondering why anyone would want to use a CD32 joypad.  For one
simple reason: More commands at your fingertips!  So go get a CD32 joypad
and start writing cool multi-button programs.

Well met and godspeed,

Yes, if you boot up in NTSC, AMOS will go into NTSC mode.

Where do I get this from?  Its not on the aminet. So I guess its not
shareware/PD. So, how much is it?

Thanks for your help.

Hello: Manuel

The file you are looking for is called CD32-Joypad.lha it is in the Amos
draw on the aminet. It contains the lowlevel.library witch you will need
in your libs draw to read the CD32 Joypad. I suggest that you read the 
Lib Call directly like ( If Lib Call(1,-30)=  Then ). You should also be
made aware that the CD32 Joypad if not just a 7 firing button device it
also allows for multi firing button, and directional pad combinations.

     The CD32 Joypad is the most powerful Amiga game Input device,
                       and I congratulate you on your choice to support it.

Hello: Matt & AmosListers

Matt yes I am interested in your game if you like you can E-Mail me a demo.
The information I was relaying to you, and the other AmosListers was not
intended to suggest a separate NTSC version from PAL version, but to suggest
one game capable of running in both NTSC & PAL modes like Guardian for the
CD32.
        looking forward to a demo. Hope you choose to support the CD32Joypad.

You can use the AMCAF extension that supports it, but it needs the
lowlevel.library in libs:

Hmmm. Good question. Since releasing issue 3, I have been gathering various
different articles together, as well as collecting from other AMOS coders
(which have been very very few) so that I can create a stonking shareware
4th edition, with full IFF fonts in the reader etc. The reader is completed,
and is stored on my Amiga, which I now have all the pieces for, and the
powerpack should arrive Tuesday with any luck.

Whilst I am in USA, I do hope to release several new projects, including
Issue 4. The latest poject I released just before coming here is a powerfull
phonebook program. This is available from my homepage. The registered
version also sends out Emails, although only compatible with some systems. I
hope to release some more puzzle games too, as I enjoy writing them.

If you have any AMOS or AMOS-related articles you wish to include in Extreme
AMOS, please email them to me at eamos@mushy-pd.demon.co.uk where I will be
happy to include them. You can also email me with any questions/queries you
may have. Providing I get my Amiga running, there will be a new version
before April, and it may probbably be HD only, if I make it big enough!

My homepage is http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk and here you can download
Extreme AMOS 3, the phonebook program, and other projects I have written,
including module players using CLI windows etc. Please leave a message on
the page`s reply form.

I hope to hear from you all very soon. Feel free to comment to the AMOS list
itself.

Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett

AMOS dudes!

Most of the AMOS stuff is sold from my post many weeks ago, and everyone
finally has what they ordered ...

- hi to Sam, whose UK post office wins for fastest delivery ... the
international letter came in 4 days! ...

- hi to Tonatiuh, whose post office wins worst award, they ripped the envelope
and broke 1 disk ... and they were slow ...

- hi to Goran in Sweden, and Claude the big buyer in Switzerland, if you need
anything off most of the club disks he has them now, and is going blind working
through all the code ...

- hi to Mike our moderator, Adam, and Eric in the USA

OK, here are the tenderonies left over:

1.  Charlie Chimp 1 and 2, source code:  I'm surprised no one grabbed this,
it's the complete source to this AF Gamesmaster winner which went on to become
a commercial game, check out Bell's magic, best routines for speed and
smoothness in a platformer, 4 disks, $3.00.

2.  MAPP Set, Mr. AMOS Programmer's Pack, 7 disk set of the best AMOS source,
assembled by the Mr. AMOS Club staff, orgininally sold for $29 by Playfield,
$5.00.

3.  Craft 1 Ext - 3 original coverdisks left, one of the best extensions, 160
commands, $3.00.

4.  Imagine II original coverdisk and 4 tutors on the mag pages, tops in
rendering and animation, $3.00.

As you can see, the price only covers postage, any photocopying, and the value
of replacement disks, I just want someone to get them that can use them.  You
can pay any way you want, personal cheque in your currency, money order in my
currency, or paper cash in your currency ... my bank cashes all of these as
part of my bank package.  Use my 'work' e-address below.

BFN,
-Chris.

I now have my links sorted out on my web site, the Geocities people who I
got my web space with only allow a few file types to be used(.ZIP, .RTF and
some other PC related ones) so I just ZIPped up the 3 progs and uploaded
them.  Unfortunatly now though 2 of the progs are zipped AND LHA`d, sorry
about that :o)

I think one or two of the progs use AMCAF extension, I advise anybody who
hasn`t got it to GET IT NOW!! Its the most useful extension for AMOS.
You`ll find it in the dev/amos drawer on Aminet.

The address...
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/9343/index.html

In the future (not so far off :) I`ll be posting the latest release of the
Zoo magazine (if it will fit on) and perhaps the source
for my new game if I can clean it up a bit...

Thanks for reading!

Is it possible to change keys in AmosPro Editor eg

I also wonder how to write a program that can be used during startup. A simple
example could be just starting a tracker module but when I write such a program
it stops startup until the program ends....is it possible to avoid that?

Try putting the line "Runback <progname>" in the startup sequence. 
 You'll need the command Runback (also know as brun) but you can 
get it from Aminet.

Hi there! I need some serious help. Ive recently got my British Amiga
working in America, and hooked it up to a PC monitor. The standard TV doesnt
give a crystal clear image, and the TV is digital, so cannot tune in manually.

The monitor I have will only work on my Amiga when the screenmode I select
is DBLNTSC or DBLPAL, and when I try and run AMOSPro, the screen tries to
overwrap itself at the sides. I used the Editor_Config to alter the
positioning on the screen, and so now I only have half a screen, as the
program moves my top-left to near-center of a normal screen, and only gives
me that small viewing space.

Is there any kind of program, patch or AMOS, that will allow me to stretch
this screen width further that that of the supplied editor config, or is
there a patch to change the screenmode AMOS logs in on. Im quite happy to
have AMOS sitting in the corner of my monitor, as long as it will view the
whole of a screen. Doesnt anybody here also use a PC monitor to run there Amiga?

I thank you all in advance for any help you may give me.

Yes. Just use the Run command.

Hello everyone!

Here's a wierd AMOSPro compiler bug for you to laugh at. Compile this
program:

Timer=0
For N=0 To 1000000
Next N
Print Timer

Timer=0
For N=0 To 1000000
Next N
Print Timer

The second loop takes much longer!

(or at least it does on my computer) :)

As an livetime AMOS lover there are some libs i would enjoy calling on,
there's just one problem...what and where. In other words where can i 
find the references and specifications of these lib routines.

Especially concerning the grafic library routines wich are at the moment
in very inefficient basic. 

Could someone tell me where these references (/kernels) are for sale, an
www adress would do nice also.

btw, after a long and hard IT study i can now continue with my real-time
     visual music application (VMA), for this i'm still searching for those
     interested grafic coders like a risk and some do.

     If u are interested in supplying grafic routine's (basic or assembly)
     and seeing your name on the credits list of the first real-time grafic
     synthesizer let me know at the following adress:

X-Status: 

Hi!

I know it is possible to monitor sound coming IN through a sampler (at
address BFE101 if I remember correctly), but I was wondering if it is
possible to monitor audio being sent OUT from the sound chip, ie when a
module is playing. It would be nice to monitor OUTPUT from each audio
channel.

I am making a music disk, and want to produce a graphic display of each
channel, similar to the waveform displays in ProTracker. I know how to do the
graphics part, as I have done it for sound coming in through a sampler. So is
there an address (or 4 addresses) where I can examine audio output? Or is
there another method?

Any help appreciated.

On my machine, the first loop takes 360, the  second  370  vbls.  Well,  it
probably has got something to do with the caches :-?

Try to turn them off and try again ;)

Try Twin Express. Is a shareware program, and it works fine for me. Is
in the Aminet. (I don't remember exactly the directory, but is easy to
find)

Cheers. My Amiga setup is:

A1200 with 6Mb memory, FPU and 28MhZ. I have an adaptor which goes into the
video port of the miggie which has the joystick-type plug on the end, and it
will fit most kinds of monitors. My monitor will display normal PAL/NTSC
screens, usually WB screens opened by progs like QB tools and Blitz public
screens work, although not AMOS screens.

AMOS would be fine, if the config allowed you to adjust the position of the
screen a lot more to the right. My screen (on TV) looks like:

                                  ******************************
                                  *
*                      *
                                  *
*    (AMOS    *
                                  *     Blank                          *
Screen)     *
                                  *

                                  *
*                      *
                                  ******************************

I have to do this because the AP screen wraps itself off the sides, and
around itself. If I could somehow extend the right borders even further, I
would be able to complete a full AMOS screen. Has anyone written a better
config program to do this?

Please help me, I am really desperate.

Oreyt!

Is there a way from Amos of getting the string of characters that are 
currently being executed by DOS?
You know something like what SnoopDos does.  Also is there a way of 
supressing these calls?

This is probably way out of reach for Amos but I thought it would be 
worth asking anyhow.

Hi,

Try sticking this in a loop (say 10 cycles) and then see what happens. Try
it also in a loop with 1 cycle (eg For A=1 to 1).

It doesnt make any sense!!

 When I use 'Read Text' in a program it all works fine when I start the
program,
 I use 'Key state' to get to 'read text' and the text is displayed.
 But the funny thing is that  when I start the same program a second time
 without quitting AmosPro the text displayer pops up at the start of the
 program....
 Is there some way to avoid that?
 I guess its saved to some memorybank...its even displayed if I remove it from
 the program...

I did post this before and got one answer but I can't get it to work. Any
suggestions?

I have an AmosPro program which has two reserved banks. The banks are
packed pictures and I need to change these pictures using new IFF files. 
Does anybody know how can I change the content of these memory banks.

Use the Spack command:
Spack "Filename of IFF-picture", bank number

Really easy!

Thanks to those who replied to my earlier query, and thanks to Matt Ward
I got it. Unfortunately, it seems to be AMOS-specifc, ie. it won't work
in AMOS Pro. Whilst I could dig out my old copy of AMOS, I've not
particularly keen. So, does anyone have any alternative solutions to the
whole AMOS-with-assembler thing?

I've never had much luck with that, but you'll probably have to  delete the
bank (Erase #) and pack the new pics.

No.

The WBStartUp drawer gets executed AFTER the startup-sequence is finished. The
DONOTWAIT tooltype is helpful, but not in this case.

Never had this problem myself (I wrote my own text reader), but you might try
the Erase All command at the start of your program to remove any memory bank
info that is hanging about. Also, remember to erase banks before you save the
program unless you WANT the bank saved with the program.

On another note, you may need to clear the input buffer with Clear Key before
doing your input routine.

I think he means changing the banks, and saving the program itself with
these banks. I have no idea how this can be done without a data file. Im
sure one of the others might know.

If it is in the startup-sequence file, surely a RUN >NIL: [file] would work
just fine? It will execute the program, and continue the startup-sequence at
the same time.

If you want to edit the currently used pictures,

Unpack the pictures to a screen save the screen out and edit them in a
paint package. The load the screen in amos and pack it.

IE i use '1' as an example bank number

unpack 1 to 0
save iff "piccy.iff",0

Then after edit

load iff "piccy.iff",0
spack 0 to 1


If you just want to replace the banks,

erase bank 1
load iff "piccy.iff",0
spack 0 to 1


The commands might be slightly incorrect but I hope ya get the idea.


Best of luck,

Hello: James & AmosListers

I just down loaded your game Frontal Assault from the Aminet, and I would
like to thank you for wasting 50 minutes of my time. Why can't you PAL guys
just let us NTSC guys reposition your game screens using the y variable in
the Screen Display command?

If you do this pleas rename your file FrontalAssult_CPC.lha, so I know that
your game is now CPC (Cross Pond Compatible).

the file in the list, but some people might not like it.

Comments about stuff in general!
Moving the screen up and down for NTSC users is a good idea.  I'll go 
home and put it in all the unfinished games that I am currently 
writing (about 3 at the moment)

Whenever I put up a question on this list I never get a reply.  Maybe 
my questions are just to hard to solve using Amos.

Also I have to let my A1200 warm up for 5 minutes before Amos will 
run.  I put this down to a crap 8Meg SIM.

Also Also,  Anyone know of a faster way of producing a sort of chunky 
to planer routine, speed is not important!.  Mine currently looks 
like this:-

for y=0 to 255
for x=0 to 320
i= (colour value bit) (not important)
plot x,y,i
next x
next y

I've tried poking directly to screen but thats strange.  I'me 
thinking of passing the screen addresses to a bit of C code but if 
theres a better Amos way let me know ;-)

Thats all I have to say for now,

It is possible, and the above example should work. I have used a 
routine similar to that many times before. Try this:

Assign "Fonts:" to "YourFontDir:"
Get Disc Fonts

This works for me, as I use Amos Pro 2.00. If you are running an 
earlier version of Amos, such as 1.36, I'm not sure whether or not 
the Assign function is implemented or not. You could use:

Exec "Assign Fonts: to YourFontDir:"

That should do it.

There are two possible ways that I can think of..

Get the LDos extension.. this allows you to load any font from anywhere 
and it also doesn't require you to load every single font off the disk.. 
It loads the font into memory as a ROM font.. which can then be read with 
a simple Get Rom Fonts..

or

If you are using AmosPro.. try 'Exec "Assign FONTS: DirName"'

(BTW I'm not sure if the command to run an external program is 'Exec' it 
may be something else similar.. sorry I don't have a manual handy.. )

How can I get the program to go to each label
only once?  (randomly)

I do know some complicated ways to achive this but there must be some easy
solution...?

I think it should be possible to use arrays but I don't know how to set it up.

Add this to the program:

'Erase old banks 
Erase 'banknr'
Erase 'banknr'


'Load "new pic" 
Load iff "new pic",Screen A
Load iff "new pic",Screen B

'Pack new pics to banks
Spack A to 'banknr'
Spack B to 'banknr'

After that delete those lines
and add:

Unpack 'banknr' to A
Unpack 'banknr' to B

I guess that should work.
By the way my daughter Sara says Hello to you...

I've written part of a text adventure game in Amos.  Its the first 
'proper' thing I've ever written, so I was hoping you guys and 
girls could give me your opinions on it.

Its not compiled, there is a read.me file with it and it was 
written in Amos Pro (but works with Amos 1.3).  

I'd be very grateful if you could pass on bugs (from the first two 
rooms, the rest is unfinished) and comments to me.  I hope this 
file is not too big for you all (12K ish), but I do think that the 
amount of debating letters on the issue of big files is larger in 
size than my file!

Thanks,
Jizzy

To shorten your discussions:

SEND ALL BIG FILES TO: kx0010@kulmbach.baynet.de   (IT´S ME!) 

I will collect them and will send (every week?) a list what files I get!
If YOU want one of these big files, write me an e-mail and I will
send it to YOU!

If you want ALL big files, I get, then write me an E-Mail, too:
  "Please send me all new files!   <E-Mail-Adress>"

Is that okay for all??? 

Lone.

I suppose you want an indefinate number of 'goto's.  This is really simple,
and you shouldn't use goto's at all.  If you only want them to be execute
once, then use an If..ElseIf..ElseIf..EndIf like the case function from
'C'.

If you want a number of functions to be executed in a random order, use a
for loop, not a do.  Set up an array, then randomize it, then go through it
using gosub's.  Here it is (I don't know if it works, just typing this on
my PC).

Dim A(xx) : Rem Where xx is the number of procedures
For I=0 to xx
	A(I)=I
Next I
For I=0 to xx
	Swap A(Rnd(xx),Rnd(xx))
Next I
For I=0 to xx
	Gosub A(I)
Next I
End

1	Rem Place Your code here.
	Return
2	Rem Place Some more code here.
	Return
3
...
xx	Last Bit of code
	Return

> 
> I think it should be possible to use arrays but I don't know how to set

	If this doesn't work (AMOS may not have true computed jumps, I can't
remember right now), I figure out a different way.

	When you specify the screen number, it kills any screen settings you may
have had previously.  The problem you are having is probably that you are
using DPaint.  Load your picture, and insure that absolutely everything is
turned off, especially stencils (since AMOS does not account for stencil
info in the BODY chunk), then re-save it.
	Also, make sure that the picture you are saving is a Half-Bright picture
(only 32 colours, and 32 half intensity), and not a 64 colour AGA picture.

	AMOS's internal assign command does not make a proper assign in AmigaDOS. 
Thus, when AmigaDOS is asked for the font list, it reports the normal fonts
directory.  Try:

	Exec "Assign Fonts: DH6:grok/ Add"
	Get Disc Fonts

It's not necessary to open a screen when you use the Load Iff "...",0 
command, as this will erase screen 0 and open a new screen that fits 
your picture...

If you want to load the pic onto your already opened screen, then 
omit the ,0 part

	Having a limit on the mailing list is not a bad thing.  What we should be
doing is sending messages like this:

	"If anyone would like to beta test my new game, send me you email address,
and I'll email the source/executable via uue."

	Then, after youve recieved millions of replies :) you email them it
directly, completely bypassing the mailing list limit of 4K.  This is how
it should be done.  We shoudn't demand a larger limit, or make a seperate
mailing list for files.  This is supposed to be a discussion group, not a
place to transfer files.

	Yes, but it doesn't do waht he needs it to do.  Each procedure can only be
executed once, and in a random order.

Yes, way back when, it was >4KB as being too big.  This really needs to be
a mailing list and not a program distribution list.  I am always willing to
receive files and either place them on AmiNet or even a WWW site.

Greetings again.

For those of you who are wondering how my 3D engine is coming, it's 
getting there. I cannot set a date as to when I will have it 
finished, but I estimate around this summer, which bumps up my 
original preimer date from this Spring to Summer. Nuts, eh?

Please remember that after I finish my engine, I will design a game 
for it, which has already been named "Eventuator 3D". The redo of my 
website is still coming up, but when its finished, you may visit it 
and check out the details on the game.

Also, if anyone wishes to donate some source in Amos that deals with 
chunky, chunky to planar (although slow), or any texture mapping 
routines of the such, OR if you wish to be on my beta testing team 
when the game is finished, please mail me. I will be releasing my 
game as shareware with the first mission or so, and then you may 
purchase the registered version for about 20 or 25 US dollars.

P.S. I'm sorry, but I will not be releasing my 3D engine and it's 
source as a stand-alone package, as some of you requested, not until 
I insure that the game sells effectively. Thanks.

Remeber to send me any links to any Amos or Amiga-releated sites so 
that I may post them on my web pages!

Long live the Amiga!

	1.) I don't believe it was the Craft II Turbo extension (I may be wrong)

	2.) Go ahead and email them to me, if you think I want them.  I'm trying
to load as many extensions as I can (I have 16Mb to waste), and my account
can certainly handle it :)

I believe the command is:

Randomize -seed

seed being the seed no. you want to use..

On Mon, 20 Jan 1997 15:37:27 +1000, Sara Alavioon may remember saying something along the lines of this:
: I have an AmosPro program which has two reserved banks. The banks are
: packed pictures and I need to change these pictures using new IFF files. 
: Does anybody know how can I change the content of these memory banks.

Yup. I guess it's going to come out now that I actually use AMOS quite a bit. So 
shoot me!

OK. What you do is to go into direct mode (press Escape from the editor), and type 
the following...

	Load IFF "MyFile",0

This will load the IFF picture called "MyFile" into screen 0. Now do this...

	Spack 0 To 5

This will compress the contents of screen 0 (ie. your picture) and put the results in 
bank number 5. That should do the trick.

X-Status: 

I have an A1200 with a PC monitor, and it will only display decent
images in DblNTSC mode. I really wanted it to run AMOS, but AMOS uses
a standard PAL/NTSC screenmode, which causes the image to wrap around
the sides.

Does anyone know of a patch that will alter the AMOSPro screen
settings to either a preset in a prefs file, or whatever I choose?

I want a prog that randomly goes to the code after each label exactly once. It
MUST go there once but may never return there. 
This code achives that:

A=1 : B=1 : C=1 : D=1 : E=1

Do 

_START:

Wait 5
X=Rnd(4)
Goto(X)

0
If A<2 Then Locate 1,1 : Print "1" : Inc A : Goto _START 1
If B<2 Then Locate 1,2 : Print "2" : Inc B : Goto _START 2
If C<2 Then Locate 1,3 : Print "3" : Inc C : Goto _START 3
If D<2 Then Locate 1,4 : Print "4" : Inc D : Goto _START 4
If E<2 Then Locate 1,5 : Print "5" : Inc E : Goto _START Loop 




The problem with this code is that there's gonna be a lot of writing if you
have hundereds of labels...

...and mostly that the more
labels that are 'checked' the more the program slows down since it has to
return to labels that already have been visited just to check that it has been
there....


So what I'd like to see is a prog that makes the selection in the top of the
loop and only goes once to each label.

I did get an answer before in a swedish BBS but I lost the code when parts of
my HD was destroyed. I'm more careful with backups now... 
Maybe it could be possible to use 'Sort', I don't know. That could be an idea
to 'scramble' a number of labels and get a list of labels and then read that
list in order one time.... ..just don't know how to programme it...

	I'll sell my old 1084S for $150 (CDN), but as I live up in Canada, it may
be hard to get it to you.  There was an AGA patch for 1.3, that gave you
256 colour modes, I haven't heard about it for a while, but have you tried
it (does it actually exist?)

No, not at the moment. However, (and I should have said this in my 
previous message to the List regarding my Engine), I will be posting 
the 3D engine in it's entirety in *compiled* form, *not* source. This 
way you will be able to design your own games (if you really have the 
time). It will be shareware, with either features disabled, or 
it'll just be a demo. The purchase price will be about $50 US, 
although this price is undecided. It seems like a fair price to pay 
for an engine that I vision will do all that Quake can. Please e-mail 
me if you have any questions.

P.S. Please remeber to continually check my site. Btw, if you have a 
link to or a page of Amos or Amiga related things, e-mail them to me!

Long live the aMiGa!

	Unfortunately, no.  There is no way of forcing AMOS into AGA
resolutions, without the aid of a hardware de-interlacer.  They do exist.
It would require a near complete rewite of AMOS's screen handling code,
which is something nobody wants to do.

	If you know a lot about AMOS, or if anyone can get a hold of the
source code for it, then it might be possible.  It would requires several
changes in the copperlist (to go AGA), and a couple more to get the
multiscan screen modes (like DblPal, etc).  Also, all the drawing routines
would have to be patched to access these weird screen modes, since their
usually interleaved bitmapped, and not planar.

Damn! I really wanted to get into AMOS whilst I was in the states. Guess I
shall have to buy a 1084 monitor dirt cheap, or wait till I go home at the
end of March. Is anyone here selling a monitor cheap in America?

I dont want to sound stupid, but why charge $50 for it? It seems odd to me,
as I would never pay that much for a piece of software unless I knew it was
really worth it. How do you expect to release it to us, in a .AMOS compiled
format, if we are to use it in our games, or is it a compiled program which
runs off a script?

If you are to charge that much, you would need to write a really good
example of it to give us that boost to buy it.

Sorry if I seem a little bit stoopid.

Hello!

Has anyone got a rotating asteroid sitting on their computers, 
preferably in less than 32 colours and 64x64 pixels?  I'm programming 
a variant on asteroids, so that should let you know what kind of 
thing I'm after ...

Or if someone can draw graphics, and they would like to be part of 
the project, E-Mail me also! 

Thanks, Carl.

I think this is the easiest:
dim a(n)
for i=1 to n
a(i)=i
next
for i=1 to n
r=rnd(n)+1
goto r
a(r)=a(n)
dec n
next

BTW, you can avoid line r=rnd(n), there is some command which gives you
last number given by rnd, but I can't remember how it calls.

I can't follow the logic of that program, but this program will do what was
originally requested:

Dim a(4)

' Store the label numbers in an array
For n=0 To 4
a(n)=n
Next n

' Shuffle the array about, 25 times
For time=1 To 25
Swap a(Rnd(4)),a(Rnd(4))
Next time

' Go to each label in a random order
For n=0 To 4
Gosub a(n)
Next n

0 ... Return
1 ... Return
2 ... Return
3 ... Return
4 ... Return

Mmm, may be 'Lowres' is the wrong bit; i think it is actually is a
screenmode value for the gfx library, since once i opened a laced screen
with amos1.3 using a

Screen open 0,640,480,32,Hires or $4

if you want to use EHB try something like

Screen Open 0,320,240,64,lowres or $80

but don't blame me if this will low-level format you hd ;-)

Greetings.

Mush recently had something to say about my 3D engine:

Well, first of all, like I said, the price is *UnDeCiDeD*. Second, I 
will probably release the engine itself as a type of "software kit" 
that will come with the engine in compiled executable with some 
sounds and textures which you can use to make your own 3D games.

> If you are to charge that much, you would need to write a really 
> good example of it to give us that boost to buy it.

Also, as I previously mentioned, I am *FiRsT* going to incorporate 
this engine into a 3D game called "Eventuator 3D". You'll have to 
check out my page (when it's finished, almost there, btw) for more 
details on the game. Both the game and the engine will be good, I 
believe, and that's why I'll be releasing shareware demos of both the 
game and the engine that you can download and try out. That way you 
can decide for yourself whether or not you like it.

Please continue to send me your links to Amos and Amiga releated 
homepages! Thanks.

I need a prog where you can select beetween hundreds of different name$ and
with each selection a variabel X gets a different number.

Could do it with zone$ etc but it takes so much space on screen, I'd like to
see some kind of selector window, possibly set up with Amos Interface
langugage.

Doesnt AMOS only open 64 colour images in EHB, meaning you can use no more
than 32 colour images saved in a paint package, unless saved in EHB mode?

AFAIR, there are two packings, SPACK and PACK

SPACK is the entire screen packed, PACK is an area of the screen packed.
Be sure of which these two banks are!

Otherwise you can

load iff "ram:pic.iff",0 : rem load iff to screen 0
spack 0 to 10 : rem pack screen 0 to bank 10

I haven't loaded Amos Pro in a long time, so I can't say if this will work, 
but...  Try using PromoteView (search Aminet), it patches the graphics.library 
or something, so that even some gurus appear ok on a DBL PAL monitor :-)

It is just possible that Amos Pro doesn't hack the Amiga that far down - then 
again...

Howdy, 

   My name is Skid, I'm learning Amos <or trying anyway> and I'm just
wondering if this list is still being used. 

I use an amiga 1200 020w/FPU.
I'm in the U.S.Air Force, I'm a jet engine Mechanic.
I made a bet with a friend of mine that by June I'd be able to have a small
game coded in amos.. one problem, I'm not very good at amos, and I have no
manuals for it. So I'll be needing some help from some experienced sources,
that's why I came here. 

Well, that's it for now. I hope someone is out there.

BTW... www.dragonlink.net/~amos is REALLY screwed up, someone should fix that.
;)

Hello Amos people.

   Well, I have Amos 1.3 , pretty outdated huh? Well, I also have Easy Amos,
but that's not much better. I can't afford or even find amos pro. So, I made a
bet with a bud of mine that by June I'd have something playable so here are my
questions to all you pros out there...

   1:how do I do so that a character is stopped from going through another
character/object? For instance, trees, chests, boulder, door, etc.?

   2:I use "load iff" but my colors get screwed up... how do I stop that?

   Well, that's all for now, I want to see if anyone will even bother helping
me out. If you DO, thank you in advance. If you don't... <sigh> :)

Later Amosites!

As a substitute you might try the amigaguide file on
aminet. I haven't seriously used it (always have a
manual handy) but it looked reasonable when I checked
it out. See: dev/amos/Amos.guide02.lha

Here's what it says about BOB COL (hyerlinks removed):


c=Bob Col(n [,s To e])

Returns -1(TRUE) if BOB number n has collided with any other BOB or
just a range of BOBs from s to e.


Good luck ony your game, with AMOS you should make it, easily.

It may be because of the flash command.. try this:

Screen Open 0,320,200,32,0
Flash off : Curs off : Cls 0
Load iff "Name of file"

You can also use Load Iff "Name of file",0 .. the ',0' will arrange 
screen 0 so that it will match the screen used by the picture you are 
loading..

Use BOB COL to detect collision between objects.

When you load screens, use LOAD IFF "[File]",[screen number] and disable the
flash with FLASH OFF before you load in the screen.

A better shuffling algorithm would be this:

Swap a(n),a(rnd(5))
Next n

Try this:

A=Rnd(15)
B=Rnd(15)
C=Rnd(15)

COL=(A*256)+(B*16)+C

Colour 4,COL

That ought to work..

Greetings.

I'm resuming work on my 3D engine since the holidays are over. Is 
there anyone left that wishes to donate any raycasting or texture 
mapping algorithms or routines they have finished or started on that 
would give me examples or help along the way? (The most difficult 
part of the 3D coding lies ahead.. hee.) E-mail me if you do. Thanks.

Just using the number will tell if a bob has collided with another bob.
With the range, you can check if your bob (number) has hit any of the bobs in

You're best off making some kind of table in memory and using that to keep
track of where walls, etc are.

Are you opening the screen to the same format as the pic? Is the screen

This could be wery slow - imagine that you have 100 labels and you have to

I personaly liked the most solution with swap(). And mine, ofcourse:)

 bu> Next time

Yes, I like it the most:) Maybe it is a bit slower, but nothing serious. 
However, here is explanation:

dim a(n)
for i=1 to n
a(i)=i
next
'all clear till now
for i=1 to n
'will do it n times
r=rnd(n)+1
goto r
'goto randomly choosen line, from n possible, n is at start size of a()
a(r)=a(n)
'last number in a() replaces used number
dec n
'n is decreased ('cause last number is moved) 
next

And now I got that it could be done with rnd (0) :

for i=1 to n
goto rnd (n)+1
a(rnd(0))=a(n)
dec n
next

And this have even less code (and SHOULD work:):

'v 1.2 :)
for i=n to 1 step -1
goto rnd (i)+1
a(rnd(0))=a(i)
next

On 23 Jan 1997 19:41:37 GMT, Chris Handley may remember saying something along the lines of this:
: In article <853548499.15730@dejanews.com>, mpd@mushy-pd.demon.co.uk says...

: >The monitor I have will only work on my Amiga when the screenmode I select
: >is DBLNTSC or DBLPAL, and when I try and run AMOSPro, the screen tries to
: >overwrap itself at the sides. I used the Editor_Config to alter the

: >whole of a screen. Doesnt anybody here also use a PC monitor to run there 
: >Amiga?
: >
: >I thank you all in advance for any help you may give me.

: I haven't loaded Amos Pro in a long time, so I can't say if this will work, 
: but...  Try using PromoteView (search Aminet), it patches the graphics.library 
: or something, so that even some gurus appear ok on a DBL PAL monitor :-)

: It is just possible that Amos Pro doesn't hack the Amiga that far down - then 
: again...

To my knowledge, AMOS doesn't use many (if any) Intuition calls at all
(that's what you use to open windows, unless there's another way -I'm
not too familiar with graphics.library). Certainly if you use ARTM, Scout
or whatever you won't see a screen listed for AMOS. Therefore, the
traditional methods won't work that well unless they themselves try and do
something funny with the chip registers.

It's ironic how enthusiastic Europress were about AMOS. I remember how
they tried to make Francois Lionet look like an angel, and
perpetually harped on about how much of an "Amiga man" he was. So, where
is this Amiga man now ? Have you SEEN Klick and Play ? Klick and Pray,
more like it! Boy does that thing crash. Wanna try opening a file
requester through one route ? Nope, crash. Click a mouse button when you
should press a key. Crash again. Well, to be truthful, AMOS is far from
perfect. Not only is it a bit of a hack in terms of interfacing into the
Amiga's multitasking environment, but it has a good collection of bugs
which make advanced stuff like Machine Code Procedures quite flaky. Having
said that, I wouldn't use anything else for quick prototyping because it's
dead easy to program with!

Hello you all.

   I'm curious... amos uses 64 color screens only? I know it'll do HAM /4096
colors... but it won't load 256 color images? 

also... I want to control a bob with the joystick... how do I do that? 
also2... if the character were to run into something... another bob... and I
wanted something to happen just by touching the bob... how would I use the BOB
COL command in that?

I know the syntax is : c=BOB COL(n [,s TO e])

but what exactly would do the c represent? I know "n" is the bobs bank
number..correct? and "s" to "e" would be any other bobs I collide with...
correct? would "c" be "-1" to represent collision? If so, would this work?

if -1=BOB COL (1,2) then print "hit"

saying that bob 1 hit bob 2?

You lucky devil. Back home in UK, the most I ever got was a 21" SCART

Hmm, I dont know any way of getting the mouse pointr into a higher
resolution, as it would certainly come in handy every now and then.

All the AGA extensions I have seen lately, just load an AGA screen and
display it. I dont think there is one extension which will allow you to do
much with an AGA screen, other than maybe load screens/banks, as the sprite
and bob banks wont hold AGA images (unless it patches them too).

Hi people,

I'm new to the AMOS list, so be gentle with me pleeeeze!  I've been into
AMOS
for years (oo-er and all that), but only recently gotten access to a
modem, so
only recently joined your wonderful mailing list.

I intend to spend a bit of time on the list over the next few months, so
here's
a bit of background information for anybody who's interested:

I used to be in an AMOS demo group called Cybornetics (whaddaya mean
"Who?!",
we released a few demos in the early 90's, the odd (very odd) game too),
and
since then I've been in several other demo groups, mostly as a
graphician but
doing a bit of ASM coding as well.  My current group is The Vegas
Gunmen, which
is basically four guys having a laugh at the world through the Amiga. 
We use
AMOS for development of 3D routines, stuff like that, then convert it to
Devpac.  We're working on a huge demo at the moment, but that's still
ages away
so I've started coding games in AMOS again in my spare time (Ah-ha!  So
THAT's
why he's joined the list!).

My current miggy set up is an A1200/Blizzard '30 with 18mb, WB 3.1 and
130mb HD
(which I'm just about to upgrade to a Gig or so).  I've got stuff like a
video
grabber and CD-ROM drive too, all running through as 21" surround sound
TV.

Real life wise (yeah, I've got a real life!) I work as a programmer
mainly
writing Windoze apps and stuff like that.  I don't own a PC though, 'cos
that
would be nasty.  I'm 23, drive a bright red Peugeot 205 XR and buy a
serious
amount of music.  My playstation gets a hammering every now and then
too.


OK, so a couple of AMOS questions then, since that's why I'm here...

I need to get my mouse pointer in hires.  Simply because chunky lo-res
looks, to quote The Right Reverend Dominik Diamond, Pants!  I've already
changed it to a bob (which was saved in hires from the object editor
thingy,
whether or not that makes ANY difference) using "Change Mouse 4" (the
pointer's
the first image in the bank).  All the screens are 640*256 Hires, but
the
pointer just stays chunky!  Help!

Also, the F1 home page advertises an AGA extension for about 4 UKP.  Has
anybody got this?  Does it do anything more that the PD Stars extension?

Thanks for you time and sorry this one was so long, I'll make sure the
next
one is four lines at most!

Cheers.

Rob/TVG.

I dont see how it is a problem, but thought that I had best check.

Greetings again.

Through some thinking and decision making, I have decided to make my 
current project (the game "Eventuator 3D") a team project. Please 
read the following for openings:

1. Assitance in the coding department.
* Not much help is needed here, however, a couple of experienced 
people wouldn't hurt. Iif you wish to assist, it would be helpful if 
you have had prior experience working on or have programmed a 3D 
game or any 3D type routines on the Amiga, in Amos preferrably.

2. Beta testers.
* When my game is finished, I will need plenty of these. I think just 
about anyone that can sit down and play "Pong" will do here. :)

3. Level designers.
* Anyone that has had previous experience designing levels for games 
on any platform (either on your own project or in a game like Duke 
Nukem or Wolfenstein) and a creative mind is qualified.

I have decided to make my game a team project since I thought it 
would be a good idea, plus it would help me save time from doing it 
all myself. pLeAsE NoTe: I have the graphics (they'll be rendered 
in Lightwave) and sound (created or digitized) covered. However, even 
though I am a musician, I would greatly welcome any assitance in the 
music department.

I do want to say that you will be paid for your services on this 
project (the harder you work the more you're paid). The details are 
undecided, but I'll notify everyone once the team is assembled.

I await your message! Thanks again for everyone's time.

Hello: AmosListers

I would like to create a program that reads the CD32 joypad, and emulates
the mouse like the joymouse program. I also want to use the buttons to
emulate key board keys. I want to poke the values directly in to memory.

Does any one now how to do this ?
Does any one now what pokes are in decimal (base 10)?

Actually, it won't do 64 color screens, just 32 EHB. (of which 4096 HAM
screens are part). Francois `must die' Lionet put a lot of code into AMOS that
isolates it from the rest of the system.

Use X=Joy(0)  (or 1, depending on which port, and move your bob based on the
direction returned. You can also use jleft, jright, jup, jdown and fire.

Yes.

Close.

If Bob Col(1,2) Then Print "Bango!"

Greetings enthused Amosites.

Geez! I didn't expect the response I recieved from the call I put out 
about my Team project. Well, to answer a number of questions I have 
recieved I thought I would put out answers to these questions to the 
list so everyone can see them at once. Here we go..

First, to all those that wish to beta-test, I'm very greatful. 
However, when my site's new look if finished and the new pages are 
up, I'll probably put up a mail posting form on one of my pages where 
you can sign up to be a beta-tester. I'll review all the requests I 
recieve and post everyones name on another page regarding who is on 
the beta-testing list. I'll also post the specifics on what your job 
will be as far as the testing goes (what you have to do).

Okay, now for some answers to these questions:

Mr. Eric Hyland wrote:
> I will Beta Test your game for free providing that it supports the 
> CD32 joypad, and its CPC (Cross Pond Compatible).

Well, I do not own a CD32 pad, and I will tell you that the game for 
now WILL not be CPC. I may make this change later. If someone (that 
will be in the coding department) owns a CD32 pad and has a routine 
that reads it in Amos, then I will incorporate it into the game.

> I'm up for all three!  Can you send me more details about the game

Again, you'll have to wait for my pages for any detailed specifics on 
my game, however, since not all of them will be up on them and you 
probably can't wait, here's some:

Type of engine:
Undecided, although it will be texture mapping and probably some 
enhanced raycasting (custom design) at the moment.

Minimum requirements:
512k Graphics and 512k Extra

Recommended setup:
1M Graphics and 1M Extra
with joystick and mouse

I have three Amigas, one is for programming and the other testing. 

A2000 with 1M Graphics, 16M Extra, and an '040 25. ECS.
A3000 with 1M Graphics, 8M Extra and an '030 25. ECS.
A500 with 512K Graphics, 3M Extra, and a 68000. ECS.

I'm seriously considering investing in some AGA hardware (graphics 
cards) and soon a new A4000 or A1200 (new or used). If someone would 
care to give me a rattle on any information where I could find one of 
the two (the card is fine for now, I need it worse, well, REALLY bad 
for this type of programming) I hear the PicassoII or Cybergfx is 
good, whatever you might recommend. I'll take a new or used in good 
condition with any manuals. Thanks for any replys. It would help.

Someone told me that this project was amazing, and, yes it is. I 
believe we can do it though. I got responses to this call on teaming 
up from people on the list I had never heard of! Cool, eh? Well, 
everyone keep in touch and keep the e-mail coming. I still have on 
file the list of everyone that mailed me on what position they would 
be interested in filling. Continue mailing until I get my pages up 
and spread the word around. Thanks again.

Long live the Amiga!

Hi Andrew,

If AF still sells back issues of that mag they might dump on you for
distributing it, but ppl shouldn't get the coverdisk Pro anyway, it was
crippled.  Since Europress/Francois have no further interest in the Pro, and
refuse to talk to ppl about it, it seems the better one to pass around, so not
to step on any toes.  It's really gone out of the commercial domain and into
the hobby area now.
-Chris.

Learning basics of Amos is not too hard... if you have a manual or at
least a list of commands and what they do. I suggest you find a manual.
I think Steve Bye sells something similar... maybe a tutorial.

Greetings Mr. Lugo.

You (Mr. Lugo) recently wrote to the List:

First of all, Amos IS an easy language, especially if you own the 
manuals, which I understand you don't, but even so, it is still 
pretty easy to figure out (Amos Pro is even easier since there is the 
built-in help program).

To your second question on "So far everyone has told me to give up on 
my project.. what's with that?" Well, whoever told you that is wrong. 
If you can use a computer (namely an Amiga), you can use Amos, and 
there is nothing wrong with trying, especially since 6 months is 
PLENTY of time to write a simple demo. Don't listen to the boneheads 
telling you that you can't do it. Stick with it. The only way you'll 
ever succeed is by trying and NOT quiting. Quitting is crap.

Well, as I'm sure you know that my recently-announced Team project 
"Eventuator" is underway, so I may not be able to help with a whole 
lot of source, but I think I can assist in some areas. Go ahead and 
send me the jpeg uu-encoded (or however you wish) and I'll go ahead 
and take a look at it.

P.S. All of you out there that are going around discouraging other 
programmers on the List (especially newbies to the language of Amos), 
stop it. If you are physically unable to say something encouraging 
then shut up and get off of this List. We can do without it.

Greetings Mr. Lugo.

You (Mr. Lugo) recently wrote to the List:

First of all, Amos IS an easy language, especially if you own the 
manuals, which I understand you don't, but even so, it is still 
pretty easy to figure out (Amos Pro is even easier since there is the 
built-in help program).

To your second question on "So far everyone has told me to give up on 
my project.. what's with that?" Well, whoever told you that is wrong. 
If you can use a computer (namely an Amiga), you can use Amos, and 
there is nothing wrong with trying, especially since 6 months is 
PLENTY of time to write a simple demo. Don't listen to the boneheads 
telling you that you can't do it. Stick with it. The only way you'll 
ever succeed is by trying and NOT quiting. Quitting is crap.

I will send you a few examples of my 3d routines. Im not too into texture
mapping (i have completely no idea) but have mastered the linear side of
things, and am just grasping the polygon command side of things.

I will be happy to betatest your game, and design levels. Ive had experience
in designing levels on my own projects, and several others. .
