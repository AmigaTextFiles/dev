Hi boys,
here there are some resource banks ready for you to use and their
relative pictures.

- Default_Resource1.Abk
- Resource1.Abk
- Default_Resource1.iff
- Resource1.iff

The Default Resource Bank is an improvement on hte default bank
included with your copy of AmosPro. It was extended by Paul Hickman,
and I added some more element. See included doc too see what was added.

The Resource is a great bank. It includes lots of buttons, led, box,
a series of digital number and lots of different display such those of
an equalizer. This bank cover lots of different element and should be
useful if you like the design.
I used it for a game I never finished (but on which I am still
thinking on). I hope it is useful to you as well.

If you want a resource interface and you cannot draw it, tell me.
I will design it for you.
