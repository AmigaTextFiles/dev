This docs are based on the docs included with version 2.2
but have been modified to list new features.

Preface

This program will be extremely useful to those programmers
who often use the resource maker of the AMOS.
I used the original version for some time and I found it very
frustrating. Infact I had to redefine the elements every time 
I wanted to change their positions, or when developing the image,
founding them not completely coincident with the icon I wished.
If I enlarged a button of one pixel I had to delete the button,
then redefine the box, and replace it on the new icon!!
It is not a problem if you have to remake one or two elements,
but it is quite boring when they are twenty or more!!

So I thought of something more efficient, and added some new 
features to the original program, just to make it a little more
flexible. When I started I realized that some more improvement 
could be done, and so I try to give them reality.

The most difficult part of the working was not carring out my ideas
but it was the integration of my own procedures in the main program.
I find more difficult understanding other's programs then 
writing them from the beginning, but here I have only to add some 
minor features so I opted for the update.
(Well, I'm not able to write and to read the right location in order 
to build up a bank yet).

New features

- the request window has been enlarged so that it can contain the new
buttons
- the slider has been improved:
  .the slider is higer so that you can see more elements on the screen
 ..it is more fast in unpdating the window after an operation
...the scrolling  of the elements is faster (3 elements at once
   instead of the original one at once)
- now the graphic editor supports pages larger than the size of the 
  screen
- you can modify slightly the size and the position of the flashing
  box of any of the element already existing without having to 
  redifine completely the very box
- you can move in a easy way the entire box when you want and where you want
- and what's more important is that all this is made completely automatic
- ith version 2.3 the resolution of the screen is automatically set to suit 
  that of the picture. Now you can load also hires interlacedd pictures and 
  the screen wil be hires interlaced as well. This has been introduced as it 
  seems very stupid having to load only lowres pictures to keep the proportion
  right.
- Added an error handler so that if you try to load a file which is not an IFF
  the program does not quit but displays an error message. 
Instructions

-As I saw (and as I think many of you experienced) with the original version
of the program any modification of the already saved bank was to be made by
remaking everything from the beginning.
Now you can spare a lot of time and pain with the new features.

-The button SIZE allows you to change the size of the flashing box.
Just press SIZE and INCX,INCY,DECX,DECY to resize the box to your wishes.
The changes are automatically saved. Note that the box will change its 
dimensions according to the kind of the element you are modifing.
So for example if you are modifing a button, a box or a horizontal line the
box will enlarge itself by 8 pixels horizontally and 1 vertically; if it is
a vertical line it will change size 8 pixels horizontally and 3 vertically.

-The button TRANS allows you to change the position of the flashing box.
Just press TRANS and INCX,INCY,DECX,DECY to move the box of 8 pixels
horizontally and 1 pixel vertically.

-You can use pages larger than the screen as the program will automatically
configure itself to the size of the page you use.
To scroll the pictures just move the pointer close to the border of the screen
and magically the images will move!
Just in the definition of the page, when you create it, use, as horizontal
number, a multiple of sixteen. This is not a must but it is recommended as the 
program rounds the X coordinate to the nearest mulpiple  of 16 and so, if you 
use the far right side of the images, you can lost part of you icons.
Well, just use multiple of sixteen or don't use the far right side of the picture.

In detail

For people who want to know how I programmed the new features I say...watch them!
You are allowed to make all the changes you want if you respect the condition
written below.
I dont't know any bug, but I know the limitations of my program (oh, sorry, the 
program I modified).
One of the limitation is the rounding of the pictures to one multiple of 16.
I first thought it was my fault the program did something strandge when using
other numbers, but then I see it was an AMOS fault. Infact the Screen Width function
rounds the size to the nearest lower multiple of 16.
The scrolling is made on that number but can be changed.
The value of the increment of the scrolling is held by the 'RR' variable.
Change that number to make the scrolling faster or slower (increment/decrement
the number).The default number is 16.
Note that if you make the value too large the scroll will litterally jump from
one side of the image to the opposite, that's not very...pretty to see.
But it's only a matter of taste and necessities (if you have a very long picture,
i.e. three/four time the width of the screen a very fast scrolling becomes important).

I'd like, if you make some more improvement on this program, that you add your
features as procedures as they are more easy to modify or to be replaced by more
powerful routines.

I hope my work will be useful to someone out there.


Distribution conditions

This program may be freerly distributed to anyone anywhere on the condition that
my name and the name of my corporation it's not removed from it, even if you modify
it, and no profit is made by doing so.

Latest notes

-The version 2.2 fixes minor bug that remained from the original version of the program.
The problem were when you tried to load a bank, then entered the graphic editor, and 
then quit the graphic editor just to press the 'Create a new bank' button.
The picture disappeared, but the elements remained in memory. So after loading the
required IFF picture, and having the list empty, the flashing box still was on the 
screen. If you deleted the first element (or if you defined it) the box jumped to the
following element and so on. It was not a terrible bug (just it needed to press the
'Clear' button, but I managed to fix it with very little pain.
