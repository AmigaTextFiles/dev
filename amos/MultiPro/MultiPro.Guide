		MultiPro Version 1.0. (C) Anthony Brice 1994.

This document is an AmigaGuide script and should be viewed with a utility
supporting that format for best results. The MultiView utility on Workbench
will work just fine.

MultiPro was written by Anthony Brice as a development tool for another
project I am currently working on and has proven invaluable. Use it and
please don't abuse it. If you feel, the need a credit within any program
you use the tool to help you develop would make me feel all proud and
sentimental etc. It's not really that much to ask after all, and it will
spur me on to write future versions.
@ENDNODE

@NODE WHAT "About MultiPro."

MultiPro was written over a couple of days as a simple procedure to enable
me to get data for a program I am writing. It has the facility to show the
mouse cordinates, check Joystick functions in both ports, dump and IFF screen
to disk (either packed or standard Dpaint style) and will also give you a
run down on the state of any keys on the keyboard. Prior to writing MultiPro
I was restricted to writing little test bits of code all over the place so
that I could see the correct mouse cordinates over the screen (Handy when you
are trying to work out Zone commands for programing icons or buttons) and key
check routines when I wanted to check for a certain combination and could not
be bothered to wade through the manual. A joystick checker is always handy
and isn't it more convenient to be able to dump a screen from another Amos
program at the press of a key rather than all that fiddling with filenames
(MultiPro uses the AmosPro file requestor so you can make sure you are 
putting the screen in the right place), save Iff, Pack screen number etc.
	To put it simply I wrote MultiPro so I wouldn't need to do all that
ever again. One procedure merged into the main program does it all and it
won't even mess up any data you already have stored (See note in How-To-Use-
Multipro later on).

	The Multipro procedure requires access to the MultiPro.IFF file when
it is called. There is a disk$= variable at the begining of the procedure
which you can edit to supply the correct path name.

	Please note that although MultiPro works fine at the moment, it is
an unfinished program - IE:some of the features are not working yet. This is
because I have recently dropped the graphic front-end into it and have not
yet had the chance to finish off updating the program. I am only putting it
online now because it does what it does well and I want some user info from
it. So give me a message, Huh?

@ENDNODE

@NODE HOW "How to use MultiPro"

Using the program could not be simpler; just load in your Amos program as
normal and then insert the following line anywhere in the program where you
will have the screen you want displayed.

MULTIPRO [NUMBER_OF_SCREEN,BANK_NUMBER]

Where Number_of_screen is the screen you want to get cordinates off - use 0
if you are using the program for another purpose.

Bank_number is the number of the bank you want to pack your picture to if
you intend to save it in that manner. If you are not going to use the pack
routine then just pass it the 1 flag as it won't really matter. I only put
this flag in so that people didn't get any banks overwritten in their code
if they were using the same bank as me.

After calling the procedure execution of your program will be temporarily
suspended (don't worry it will still be there when we get back). Now you
will have a small screen overlaid over the top of it showing all sorts of
usefull information - Joystick positions, Mouse cordinates and the other
information which MultiPro is used to see. Pressing any key will now give
you the relevant char$ value as well as scancode and ASCII number as well so,
if you are like me and keep forgetting how to use the escape key then you
won't have to worry anymore. The screen with this information on it can be
scrolled anywhere on the screen by holding down the left button on the title
bar to move it up or the right button to move it down this way there is no
area which you can't see with a little bit of finger pushing. And that is
basically all you need to know on how to use it. It really is that simple.
Just click on the (q) icon to go back to your main program as if nothing
had ever happened.
	Remember you can call MultiPro from as many places in your program
as you like - for instance if you have a couple of screens which you need
to zone out you can just plonk the line somewhere in there as well. I find it
a good idea to have a bit of music playing in the background (a module or
music file) as it stops you getting bored while you are working out all that
data (I know, I hate doing it too).

** Important note **
   --------------
Multipro currently uses the Amos zone commands for checking icon clicks and
the likes so it will overwrite any zone commands you have set prior to 
calling the procedure. I am currently looking into getting around this by
storing the zones in a bank just prior to clearing them out so that they can
be restored afterwards. As far as I am aware this is currently the only area
which might cause compatibility problems but it can be solved by just calling
the procedure before initialising any of these zones in your own program.

Once I have finally sorted out the extra features to build in I may also make
a custom icon reading routine instead so that none of the original programs
data is corrupted to ensure full compatibility. This little quirk will be
fixed one way or the other when I do the next revision.

@ENDNODE

@NODE RESTRICTIONS "Restrictions to the use of MultiPro"

Basically there aren't any. What I do want though is for people who use the
tool and like the idea to write to me with any comments or suggestions for
a later version as I would eventually like to make it into a very smart
tool indeed. That's all I ask of you all anyway.

I hereby agree that this program is placed totally free of charge to any
person who wishes to use it for the described purposes. I also claim no
responsibility or liability for any problems or loss of data that might
arise from using it and must specify that anyone who uses this program does
so at their own risk.
	Having said that MultiPro doesn't delete files or any other drastic
actions which could actually damage your data (It appends a .Pack extension
to any files which are saved as packed screens so it shouldn't overwrite any
screens you save over by mistake) so basically this bit is just me covering
my rear.
	I would also like to say that I have painfully tested MultiPro over
the last few days and have found no errors at all. Having said this someone
out there is bound to find one, so please let me know if I missed something.
Also as a sidenote: MultiPro works with either Amos or AmosPro just in case
you were wondering.
	I also grant permission for any magazines to include this on a cover
disk of some sort although I would request that they notify me first so I
can see my name in lights.
	And - finally - I would especially like this program to find its
way into the many P.D libraries that cater for Amos and AmosPro users because
that's what it is all about. Please pass it on to any library you know.

	Okay, what are you waiting for. I'm done here.
@ENDNODE

@NODE COMMANDS "A brief overview of the MultiPro commands"

Multipro has the following icons in this version.

	IFF will save the current screen data as an IFF standard file.

	PCK will  pack the current screen to a specified bank number and
	save it with the .Pack extension so that the original is not
	deleted.

Both of these routines call up a file selector so that you can choose a file
name and the screen is saved in its entirety, IE: the MultiPro window is not
shown over it. Remember though that if you use this routine to copy another
Amos screen from a program you could be infringing someones copyright. I do
not take any responsibility for this whatsoever so please check that it's
okay first before you do.

MultiPro also has two small arrow icons which do not serve any function yet
but will eventualy be used to cycle the background screens around if they
exist. This is so the program can be used on any screen and multiple calls
to the procedure become redundant.

If you want to check a joystick in the mouse port then you will have to
remove the mouse and plug the joystick in first (Kind of obvious that one but
I thought I'd better mention it).

@ENDNODE

@NODE FUTURE "MultiPro and its future

These are a few ideas I have had for future implementation into the Multipro
Procedure.

An Accessory extension. Ie: I could have the program do the zoning for you
via a point and click method and use the AmosPro Equates thingies to insert
Zone lines in the program with the data already set. I haven't researched
this much but I think it is possible and I will certainly be looking into
it. It would certainly make a great extension.

Multiple screens. If the screens are defined then let MultiPro at all of
them via cycle arrows on the interface. That would save the user having to
insert the command all over his program.

An AmigaGuide document. Oops, already done that. I just thought I would 
mention it because this is the first time I have written one and I am rather
proud of it.

Module support. It wouldn't take a great deal of programing for the program
to let you load a module and listen to it while you work. Well I got that
idea from the AmosPro compiler but it's a nice little user-friendly addition.

A Palette requestor. I could adapt the procedure supplied with AmosPro with
a little work so that it runs alongside the MultiPro utility so that screen
colour settings can be adapted prior to saving out graphics.

@ENDNODE

@NODE MORE "What I want from you"

With a lot more work, MultiPro could turn into a very usefull little tool
indeed. What I want in return for you using the program now are comments
and suggestions about how to improve upon it, and ideas for other development
time-savers to stick in. Go on, I'll even take the critiscism because I want
to take this program further so it has to be user-friendly towards other
people as well as myself. All it costs is a letter and stamp, and if you
send me a disk I will, of course supply you with the latest version. Which
will hopefully take note of your suggestions etc.

@NODE SYSTEM "How it was all done"

MultiPro was developed on an A1200 with 170meg Hard drive, Citizen 120D
printer, external drive and the AmosPro compiler (Not that I used it for 
this routine). The development was aided by the superbly designed Amos
system, the invaluable articles on AmigaGuide in March 94 Amiga computing,
a rather nifty little green Maestro (although what my car has got to do with
it I am not sure), a lot of too and froing of the seperate programs between
myself and my pen pal Michael Lysons, before eventualy emalgamating (I think
I question that spelling rather severely) the routines into what MultiPro
has become. It will get bigger and better.
	As far as I know, although I haven't had much chance to test it, this
routine should work on any system that Amos will run from. It's not much
use if you don't have Amos by the way, and I did a check 1.3 compatibility
before saving it out so old Amos users needn't feel left out.
	The program was developed over a couple of days and after a severe
hangover which I suppose, in retrospect, rather serves me right. Feel free
to customise the program to your own needs and send me a copy if you do
something much better with the program (like using those funny resource 
things which I haven't got to grip with yet).
	In the near future I also plan to build other procedures like a new
custom file requestor for those people who write programs which they don't
want someone to know they have used Amos for and they can't hack the hassle
of writing one themselves. I also hope to write a Bob crunching routine to
squeeze sprites to the smallest size they can go without losing any data. In
other words a sort of auto-topleft of all the sprites in the bank and then
get rid of any space underneath them so that Memory can be freed in large
progs which have lots of defined sprites or icons. This is a feature I
wanted to see in the AmosPro object editor but for some reason Francois
didn't think of it. Never fear maybe I'll save the day.
