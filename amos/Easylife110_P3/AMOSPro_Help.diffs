< 
< Double Precision info
< 
< We only got Double Precision working very near the end of the project, too
< late for the User Guide! So there's something else you need to know:
< 
< Single and Double don't mix!
< ----------------------------
< 
< Imagine you've just loaded in your favourite sine scroller and want to make
< it even more accurate with the new Double Precision feature of AMOS Pro.
< To do this you need to add the SET DOUBLE PRECISION command at the top of
< your program and then (and this is the new bit), you need to retokenise the
< program using the accessory which is available from the User menu.
< 
< The retokeniser changes all the single precision numbers in your program
< into double precision. This needs to be done because single to double
< precision conversions would have to happen during your program. These
< conversions are not very accurate and take longer to work out. So it's
< best to have the same precision throughout your program. You could run
< a mixture of the two precisions but you'll lose accuracy.
< 
< Configuration info
< 
< When you installed AMOS Professional, the installer set up options within
< the configuration that benefits your memory situation. For example the Undo
< buffers are set low on a 1 meg machine.
< 
< So don't use a 1 meg AMOS Pro disc on a bigger machine - just reinstall it.
< 
< Compiler and 3D Extensions
< 
< If you are a registered AMOS Compiler and/or AMOS 3D user you'll be wanting
< to use AMOS Professional with these two extensions. It was our plan to have
< the two intergrated for Pro's release. Sadly though we've had technical
< problems and the extensions are currently not compatible.
< 
< By the end of October we will have sorted this out and an update will be made
< availble. So call Europress at the start of November for information on how
< to upgrade your Compiler and/or 3D.

< Memory Considerations - 1 meg users of AMOS Professional
---
> @endnode
109,112d18
< AMOS Professional does its best to give you as much available memory as
< possible. But at the end of the day AMOS Professional is a huge program with
< many memory requirements. So we'll point you in the right direction by
< offering the following advice:

< * A Multitasking machine in its own nature needs to have spare memory to
<   operate properly. So you must ensure that at least 32k memory is left free
<   for the system's own needs. Trying to grab all the memory is just too
<   risky.
---
> Exits from the program.
120,121c25,26

123,126d27
<   If you find the Editor's drop down menus cannot be accessed, it's because
<   there's less than 72k available and AMOS Professional needs more to open
<   them. If you let this happen you are still able to use the keyboard
<   short-cuts.
128,129c29,30
<   AMOS Professional also has a memory grabber. When Pro detects less than 72k
<   is available it will erase the following until more than 72k is freed:

< * You may find that some programs will fail under AMOS Pro and yet work fine
<   in old AMOS. Obviously AMOS Pro's new Editor and features take up more
<   memory. So to free up memory when your programs run try these techniques:
---
> @endnode
142,143d37
<    - The Close Editor command will free a considerable amount of memory but
<      will still leave you with a 50k overhead compared to old AMOS.
145,147c39,40
<    - Using the new Kill Editor command will free so much memory that you'll
<      have 32k more to play with than was possible in old AMOS. The bad news
<      is you'll have to wait for the editor to load after each run.
---
> @node C_FREEZE "FREEZE"
> @{"Freeze" amos AMOSPro_Tutorial:Tutorials/Amal/Amal_5.AMOS}
149,153c42,43
<      Some programs that use Kill Editor may ask for lots of memory by
<      reserving banks and opening screens. Once the program has finished, AMOS
<      Pro attempts to reload the Editor. It will first ask you to insert the
<      System disc so that it can find the Editor files and then attempt to
<      load it.
---
> Freezes	 all  object  movements	 at  their  present  position.	They can be

155,156c45
<      If this fails due to low memory, AMOS Pro will clear all variables, the
<      screens etc.
---
> 	Freeze
158,160c47
<      If it still fails a small requester will appear that asks if you want to
<      erase the memory banks - this should be plenty for the editor to load,
<      if not you'll be dumped into the Workbench.
---
> @endnode
162,163d48
<      So when you program in a low memory state, ensure your program erases the
<      banks before going back to the editor.
