                        Easylife V1.10 Distribution
                        ===========================


    This is the third archive of a 3 part distribution. This file contains
    everything necessary to create an amigaguide file from your AMOSPro
    on-line help file "AMOSPro_Help.Txt". NOTE: Version 2.00 of AMOSPro
    is required for the patch to be successful.

    The files COPYING & COPYING.LIB apply to the GNU program "patch",and
    the GNU libarary "ixemul.library" which are contained in this archive.
    The patch & easylife are not GNU software, only the aforementioned 
    files

    Installation
    ============

    1)  Run AMOSPro, then quit so the AMOS Assigns are in place.

    2)  Open a shell, and CD to this directory.

    3)  Enter the command (on one line - split here for readability):

	patch -o Easylife2:Docs/AMOSPro/AMOSPro_Help.Guide
		 AMOSPro_Accessories:AMOSPro_Help/AMOSPro_Help.Txt
		 AMOSPro_Help.diffs

    You may need to change the first path to the directory where
    you installed the help files for easylife. Patch this file
    after installation of disks 1 & 2.


    If you have installed the AmosGuide.AMOS accessory, you may now load
    AMOSPro, and select Help from the menu for AmigaGuide on-line help
    for AMOSPro. Select the "Other Help Files" link at the foot of the
    page to access the Easylife documentation, and any other files in
    the easylife help directory tree, you select "Open..." from the
    project menu.
