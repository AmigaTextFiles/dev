So you are flash enough to own some FAST RAM eh?  Well as a special feature you get a free scrolly message to distract you as you read Sauce 'N' Code 3!!!  hehe.  After such a BIG delay from Issue 2 which appeared sometime in August 1995 I've finally found a way to fill up yet another disk of AMOS warez.  Now I'm at college finding time to do lots of kewl stuff is hard and I've not coded anything new for yonks!   NFA Productions have gone quiet, with only the odd issue of "The Word" finding its way out every couple of months.  Looks like I'll have to get something out soon!   Something completely different though:- who's going to the World OF Amiga Show '96 in April (unless it gets changed, again!) ??  I'm gonna find a way their hopefully so everybody else should go and support the Amiga pooter - proove to everybody that there's still millions of Amiga users and pentium peecee's should be avoided!  Special word for Møz 'PANTS' and that's it.  DOn't forget that you can see Balrog's Bra through his t-shirt (oo-er) and that Flossy has a chicken in his sock.  That's all from me - good day!
