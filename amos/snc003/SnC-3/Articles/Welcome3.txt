A  nice big 'oo-err', as SnC arrives back after a nice long summer holiday!  Not
had enough time to do too much so source code has been slow.  However a nice big
hello  to  the new NFA AMOS coding member Jok who has managed to contribute some
stuff.

Will  all  you  lazy dudes out there contribute something too?  Source code is a
little thin in the PD scene!  As you may have noticed from the contents page I'm
getting VERY thin in the way of source code to fill the disks. Pants.

Well since issue 2 was released the paper magazines have finally woken up to see
the  light.   Yep  that's right, SnC got reviewed in a few mags and scored quite
nicely.

                          Amiga Shopper 79% - Issue 1
                          CU Amiga      80% - Issue 2
               Amiga User International 81% - Issue 2

One thing I'd like to say to Amiga Shopper is:  although you down graded issue 1
of  SnC by 10% for its swearing content; how come you then go and say "Sauce 'n'
Code  provides AMOS users with source files and a crap pun." as i'd say that was
just  as bad in the swearing department!  I think £2 should be knocked off Amiga
Shoppers  cover  price so that I might actually buy it again!  All it's good for
at the moment is lining the cat litter tray (Hi Rich & Kev!).

Enough  gripes  though  - I don't mind what the press say, unless it's good so I
can pose with it infront of mates at college!  hehe.  But what's in this issue?

A  pile of stuff for demos, effects and the like, some little gems and some poly
filler.   Understand  all that?, good.  Will AMOS source code ever survive or is
there  not  enough  AMOS coders any more?  Should SnC become a multi coders disk
mag so all coders can read it?  Anybody wanna help?

What  about  supporting  Blitz Basic too?  I can't program in it to save me life
though!  hehe.

To end let me just remind you that to contact me, write to:

                                 Sauce 'n' Code
                                   ßudda/NFA
                                    "Bradda"
                                Crowborough Road
                                   Georgeham
                                  North Devon
                                    EX33 1JZ

Enclose  SAE  or  a  stamp for a nice reply or wait and hope.  I'm a good person
though, not a disk theif.  If you DO send some decent enough source code it will
be in the next issue of SnC with your name/handle slapped next to it.  Make sure
you put any comments IN the actual source code and it would be of help if a nice
small  explination arrived with it in the form of an ascii text file.  Any disks
sent will be returned - definetly!

                                 -------------

A little something that I'm intrested in doing but am stuck; can anybody help?
Here's my problem-o...

I desperetly want to play back large animations from hard drive/cd-rom.  But how
can  you  do this?  As you may have seen from issue 2 of SnC it IS possible with
an  audio  sample.   Any ideas?  The file format doesn't have to be IFF either -
whatever works the fastest.  The animation doesn't have to be full screen, maybe
about 1/4 of the screen is enough.

If any clever bod does know if this can be done, from within AMOS Pro then write
to  me  at  the  address  above.   I'd really like to find out if it's possible.
Maybe a reward is required if a routine works perfect???

                                 -------------

So  till  next  time,  stay  kewl,  any see if you can spot any swearing in this
issue!
