Hi there steve, I wrote a file requester procedure in Amos a while back, it
requires the LDOS extension, since I never could get Amos Pro's commands
for listing only files and assigns and devices(Any Idea's anyone???? Help)
It works alot like ASL, more like Final Copy II though, works great, but
it won't work on Amos Pro unless you have the Pro version of LDOS, I don't so
I can't use it bummer. Well if your interested in it, give me a reply

Why not? A little competition now and again can work very stimulating. 
Please try and outperform the official amoslist-website ;-).

Hi, I'm about half way through a project which needs to use a lot of maths
however I am having a few problems.  The first is that if I use floating point
numbers for a loop ie,
for c#=0.0 to 1.0 step 0.01
or something like that, and I set Double Precision on then the loop will never
terminate.  This is a bit of a problem, why does this happen?  Is there a 
simple fix - I have converted them all to integers and then divided by 100 in
this example but its hardly an optimal solution.

The second problem I am having is with powers (^). It doesn't work correctly.
If I raise a negative number to an odd power then the number is turned into
a positive, which it shouldn't do :(  Again I've got a work around but its
not exactly good coding. it goes like this :

	to raise c# to the power of x
	if x>0
		if c#<0 and (x/2)*2<>x
			c#=c#^x
			c#=-1.0*c#
		else
			c#=c#^x
		end if
	else
		c#=c#^x
	endif

s there any better way of getting around this problem?  I've Amos Pro v2 so
upgrading to a less buggy version is not an option.

thanks for listening

Paul

Yes, I know I go on about it, but one of my mates has just sent me
everything he has on the D-Sam extension, and basically its the lib,
and example program and a bit of text telling you how to install it. No
contacts, no license stuff etc. Can someone tell me if the extension is
PD (if so, anybody else want a copy?), and if not, a contact address..

Also, could the kind person who offered to help with my flickering
sprite problems email me again, as my mailbox crashed and I lost your
address. Soz! :)

I do not know why this happens, but using integers generally IS a good 
idea, as it is faster and I seem to remember some bugs having to do with 
floating points.

I do not know why this happens either, but I think you can replace this 
routine with the following line:
   C#=Sgn(C#)*C#^X
And if that does not work this should:
   C=C# : C#=Sgn(C)*C#^X

BTW, instead of 
   If C#<0 and (X/2)*2<>X
you could use
   If C#<0 and X mod 2 <>X

Good luck,

  Technically, that would work, but this is clearer:

C#=Sgn(C#)*Abs(C#)^X

because it shows what your intent is.  (If you're really crazy abøut speed,
you can get rid of the Abs() call, but it helps readability.)

>BTW, instead of 
>   If C#<0 and (X/2)*2<>X
>you could use
>   If C#<0 and X mod 2 <>X

  No you can't, because (2/2)*2 = 1*2 = 2, but 2 mod 2 = 0 <> 2.  What you
can do (and it's faster) is:

If C#<0 and (X and 1)<>0

  In fact, you can speed up this particular case even more:

About those maths-problems:

1) My guess is that it is caused by round-off errors. Adding 0.01 to itself 
   100 times will not present you with the answer '1.0'. Try this:

   for i#=0.0 to 1.0 step 0.01
       ?i, i#: inc i
   next i#

   and be amazed at the results. However, AMOS 1.36 stops when it reaches
   1.0, because the next number after 1.0 is bigger than 1.0. So I don't
   understand why your program won't quit, but then again, AMOS is full
   of nasty surprises.

2) I know this bug from the time AMOS 1.2 was released. I've written Euro-
   press a dozen times about it, but they never fixed it. It's present in
   every version of AMOS (including PRO and EASY). You can 
   a) not use powers
   b) use them with the workaround you've already written
   c) hack the AMOS-code to fix it
   d) use the mathffp.library yourself. 

   Choose!

Erm... yes... obviously :-) I meant
   If C#<0 and X mod 2 <> 0

BTW, could this also be
   ? If C#<0 and not (X mod 2)

I forgot wether (false = 0) or (false    <>    -1) in Amos.

        If I want a simple chain I use 

RUN filename

        but if I have compiled files it doesn't work!

How can I do? I have 3 progs:

---------------
PROG1:

blah... blah...
RUN Prog2
---------------

---------------
PROG2:

blah... blah...
RUN Prog3
---------------

        If they are compiled (under Amos1.31) how it works?

  No, because the Not statement (yes, Not is implemented as a statement!)
is broken in AMOS.  (What isn't?)

  True = -1, False = 0.  For testing purposes, True <> 0, False = 0.

Is there anyone else interested in Amoszine,  a cool new diskmag?  If so, 
place your orders this way and I'll send it back packed with DiskMasher.  
If you have any objections to me using DiskMasher then I will Lha it.  
The mag I will send is a PD issue, but it is still good.  Anyone 
interested?? :-)

Use a Dos execute call or Amos Pro's Exec function.  Make sure to run the 
program.  Then quit your existing one.  If you want to pass variables, 
use the command line (and command line$ in your other program to get the 
values back).

I'm about to embark on a fairly big AMOS project.  It's intended as an 
adaptable Quiz program.  I'd like to have options for picture and audio 
clues.  I'd also like split screens, copperlists, and if feasible, 
Intuition screens, requesters, etc.  There might be some small animations 
in it (anybody got a good digitized anim of the Earth rotating?).  And 
I'd obviously want to do as little work as possible, which implies the 
need for a later version of AMOS and compiler.  Ahh, but the BUGS...
 
SO, which version of AMOS has the best combination of features, with the 
fewest bugs?  I get the impression from reading this list that newer 
doesn't always mean "fewer bugs".  I'm also assuming you'll all suggest 
AMOS-PRO as a starting point?
 
Which extensions should I explore?  (I've never used one before, aside 
from what's built-into AMOS).  BTW, I don't expect to do any floating 
point math.  I do plan on samples and using some speech synthesis.
 
With all that said, what rev. of AMOS/Amos-Pro would you suggest?  Which 
libs, extensions, etc?

When I first tried to compile my Uno clone using Amos 1.34 I think
I had similar problems to what you had.  What I did that seemed
to clear things up was to set the stack to a higher value,
after that my program did not crash anymore.

How is the NOT instruction broken, because it returns negative number?
technically its supposed to: AMOS stores numbers as 32 bit signed numbers
so when you do a logical NOT operation it will set the signed bit:

eg.  then number 8 in 32 bit binary is 00000000000000000000000000001000
     when it is NOT'd     it becomes   11111111111111111111111111110111

notice the last bit(the sign bit) is set so it will become a negative 
number which you will notice is -9, which is what the NOT instruction
will return

Floating Point numbers are not perfectly accurate. This is due to the
limited amount of bits used to store the number. Therefore it is not
recommended to use constructions like 'If float1#=float2#' as they
could never be true, use 'If abs(float1#-float2#)<0.001' or anything
equalent. For-Next-loops should for this reason use only integer
values if possible.

It is. And it's much faster too... avoid IEEE where possible ;-)

PS> The second problem I am having is with powers (^). It doesn't work correctly.

Euh? Very bad thing this one... I never used powers (as they will
load the math libraries and I want my programs not to use any of
these) but bit shifting operations instead. I think AMOS is using
these math libraries to perform the power operation and therefore the
fault could (!) be searched there... ever tried an other maths program
that uses the maths libraries?

PS> 		if c#<0 and (x/2)*2<>x

Use

If c#<0 and (x and 1)

instead ;-)

I am embarked on the same sort of project once, but the bigness prevented

U should go for amos pro and the amos pro compiler then u will get the
update for amos pro to 2.0 which has fewer bugs, and u will get the
advantage of compiling directly in amos and se the result at a second.

And how about Turbo extension? Is there faster Bob routines, and whats

Is there any hope for my AmosPro and A1200? :)

I bet you all have heard that Blitz2 is fast....thats not true.
Bobs are fast in Blitz2 but calculations are very slow, 2-5 times
slower than AmosPro+Compiler.

BULL - From first hand, writing in C, Blitz, and AMOS, I know that AMOS 
math is no different than Blitz, you must be using quicks and not 
integers.  I have moved to C, though - only asm can beat optimized C 
math!  I had too many speed complaints and AMOS->bug reports from my 
programming in AMOS, and Blitz was SO SLOPPY!  With Blitz, you have to slam
OS functions anyway, so why not just do it in C...?  

By the way, folks, airTaxi, my final AMOS project, will be appearing on 
AMIGA POWER COVERDISK 50.  So keep an eye out.

        My problem is that I have to "link" programs compiled under
   Amos1.31 (I own AmosPro but I need 1.31 for this...) so I can't use
   AmosPro commands! How can I achieve this effect?

   Note:
 
 - RUN works only with interpreted progs
 - Ive tried with calls to EXEC but it doesn't work

   Can someone write down the necessary piece of code? I need to chain 
   a program ending the calling one.

   Program1
   blah...   blah...
   RUN Prog2
   END

                                                        Thankx

As far as we know (pluralis discussionlistis) Amos development by 
Europress has stopped completely. Several groups and persons of this list 
have plans to take it -within legal bounds- a step further. Michael 
Sikorsky is working on what-used-to-be-called-MARP, a project to replace 
all Amos commands with C functions, so that an Amos programmer could 
switch easily to C (and C programmers would not have to plough through 
numerous manuals just to open a screen). The Amos Development Team (of 
which the members are?) are working on a completely new Amos-like but 
less buggy language.
How about an update, guys?

In what sense? They are not disfunctional at the moment, are they? You 
can program with them, cannot you?

We have covered this subject before on this list. I guess the fact that 
both languages are popular means that both languages have their strong 
points.

Hello all,
    I'm new to this group so I'm just letting you all know who I am! :-)

At the moment I use Amos 1.3+comp. on a 500 with 1meg.  I do have AmosPro from
the Amiga Format Coverdisk but haven't got round to setting it up yet!!

So, I'm a bit lazy!!!!!!  I'm waiting for a Harddrive before I do anything
else.  I've been programming in Amos for a ggod three years now and know my
way around the language pretty well (I also know c & c++ if anyones
interested!).

When I started using Amos, I needed to set up a large 2d Array (For map
storage - 200*200)   Unfortunately, AMOS doesn't handle anything this large,
which stumped me for a good while.  (Is this bug fixed in AMOS Pro? - You can
define the array, but if you write to areas of it the machine hangs!!!).

If anyone else has this problem ..... I HAVE A SOLUTION!!!!!!

It's rather low level though, involving pokes and peeks to and from direct
memory addresses!

STEP 1:
    Reserve a data bank for use (This initializes a block of mem. to use)
        RESERVE AS DATA 6,200*200 : 'for array 2D 200*200

STEP 2:
    You need to have a formula that allows you to access an element quickly
and easily.  This may seem complicated but it does work!!!!!!
    For example, a write command (Storing data in an element) could be:
        POKE START 6+x+(y*w),2
; where x is the x co-ord, y is the y co-ord and
; w is the width of the map (The largest possible
; for x).  The value 2 is written to the location.

    This may seem a little complicated, but it is a lot faster than the DIM
function and allows you to define a larger array!!!!  It is also stored as a
data bank allowing the easy loading and saving to disk!!!

If you you want me to go into more detail then let me know!!

I hope this is of some use,

Tim.   -   tl14@bton.ac.uk

Same here, except I've got 3M and AmosPro & Compiler.

No, it's not a bug. add "Set Buffer 20" to the beginning of your program. 
INcrease the value until it works.

Yes, you're right.. definately a better way to do it. :)

Hiya,

I'm the sort of AMOS programmer who's pretty adept at moving bobs and 
pasting icons and very simple coding, but I've never been able to come up
with a top ten list routine.

Assuming the current score is in a variable called SCORE, could someone 
help me out with a procedure to chech and save it against a file on the
disk? this would be much appreciated.

I've always thought a scrolling 3d environment like that of the popular
ibm game could be faked in amos by using a directional animation of screens.
now i know that amos permits only 8 screens but if they are, say, 352 by
960 then you have (through judicious screen offsetting) effectively 24 
screens (or more) which should be sufficient for some excellent 3d scrolling
effects at lightning speed. I wanted to digitize some of those claustro-
phobic hallway scenes from _The Shining_ to try this, but my digitizer is 
not up to snuff.

Opinions? and what is Francois doing these days?

-Daniel

Hi all.

It's a lot of time i dont't write to the list but i'm always am AMOS
programmer!
A question:
 
- Is there a possibility to open a reqtools file requester on a WB screen
from AMOS without using Intuition extension by Andy Church?
The problem is: how to get the start address for the WB screen data 
structure?

   I hope in suggestions....

I bought a copy of AMOS the Creator (early version I think)
last year and still cannot run it on an AMIGA 500
with WB 2.5 rom, nor on an AMIGA 600, nor on an AMIGA 2000.
I have downloaded the upgrade and that hangs up when it fails to
recognise it's own disk!

This has to be the most difficult AMIGA program I have ever encountered
though I am determined to use it!

I cannot install it to hard disk and it hangs up when run from floppy.

All the computers have hard disk drives and extra memory. The Amiga 2000
has Gigamem (which I disabled with AMOS without any luck).

Can anyone help or should I switch to some other alternative
such as Blitz basic?

Regards, LIAM D.

Hello All,

I've got a real sod of a problem which is making my life hell!! Whenever I
run my new project on my A1200 it generates a SOFTWARE FAILURE error,
tells me to wait for disk activity to finish before rebooting.

I looked through the program on AMOS Pro using the step command and it seems
when it gets to an

UNTIL etc,

Command it skips to somewhere completely obscure in the program causing the
crash?

HELP!!!!!!

Is it AMOS (v1.36 with CRAFT and EASY LIFE extensions)?
Is it my HD?
Is it my A1200?

What the hell is going on?????!!!!

Yes, you can use reqtools for AMOS Pro with out intuition extension, but 
I don't know about AMOS. I have made routines to AMOS Pro for 
reqtools.library, but I had a hd-crash lately and the sources for 
reqtools went to dev null.... I am recoding them probably in this week, 
and I am thinking to send them to AMOS List.

Most likely.

> Is it my A1200?

It wont be your setup.  It is always AMOS that mucks everything up.  When 
Monsieur Lionet wrote AMOS, he was learning to program the Amiga.  He 
came from the ST!!!!!  Therefore, everything is badly bugged and he didnt 
even hear of a tool called Enforcer.  My advice is to disable those 
extensions and try again.  There is always clashing with different 
extensions.

Crap AMOS, thats what! :-(

Haven't seen any post on the list for almost a week now is the list:

1) Down
2) Dead
3) All of the above

Anyone have any word on the latest with the TurboPlus extension or is 
that dead as well (latest being v2.0). I was looking forward to seeing this
Scene Animation Language and also Colour Font commands implemented 
instead of having to use the procedures as well as the multitasking LOAD 
command.

Also has the Compact+ extension gotten off the ground yet ?

Perhaps your problem is related with the installed extensions. I recommend you
to de-install these extensions, and try again.

Another possibility is a problem with the memory chips of your AMIGA. Try some

Hey look, I've got a working alpha copy ready for FTP at 
ftp.rain.org/pub/doctorx/ if anyone wants to try it out. I need graphics, 
ideas, and if you want to finish coding it, it's all yours. I am no 
longer interested in it as much as I was. Currently I am working on a 
C64-style platform game and a MUD for Linux which is taking up all of my 
time (as if a weekly TV show didn't. Ha.)

This certainly is not normal behaviour. Although AMOS is a bit buggy, the 
things you describe should not happen.

Which upgrade have you got? 1.36? And how did you install the software? 
Was there a programme to do it for you? Where did your configuration file 
go? Has a directory called Amos_system been created and is Amos able to 
find it?

What do you mean with 'the upgrade hangs up when it fails to recognise 
it's own disk'? Do you mean the Amos (back-up, I hope) disk, or the disk 
the upgrade is on? And what do you mean with 'fails to recognise'? Do you 
get a message stating that (what?)?

Replies to the list, please.

Extensions won't cause a problem after startup unless you actually 
*use* the commands in them - if your not using the extension 
commands, de-installing them won't make any difference except to free 
some memory.

I very much doubt it - forget the HD - the program has already loaded 
& tested. If it was the machine it would be crashing left  right and 
centre, not just on AMOS loops, and if it was the memory, it wouldn't
happen everytime, as the program would be at a different address each 
time.

If it crashes at the end of a loop / if block, the probable cause is 
this:  When an AMOS command is executed, it receives its parameters 
on a stack using register A3. If must remove all these from the stack 
by adjusting A3 before it returns. The address to loop/jump to for 
if/loop commands is also on A3, so if a command does in the loop does 
not remove all of its parameters correctly, your program will jump to 
the wrong place. Can you mail me the section of code in question?

P.s. Congratulations on being the only person in the universe 
actually able to install the craft extension! Everyone I've spoken to 
had the installation program crash for one reason or another - on my 
machine the keyboard map was wrong, and I couldn't type :'s which 
made entering paths a bit difficult!

Hello,

I read somewhere the 'screen-struct' from intuition (I don't know
too much about this subject so don't flame me for using screen when it
should be 'layer' or so:-) can take a 'custom bitmap'. I believe this is
a pointer to a piece of memory with the bitmap, is this right ?
If it is, is it possible to have a intui.screen showing the contents of
an amosscreen (since amos can give the pointer to the bitmap of its screen)
I realise that there are differences in the screens but would a single
bitplane be possible ?
If this can be done, it would mean I can get amos-screen-data in a wb
screen on 1.3. 

Anyone ? (Andy, please ?:-)

Yes.

This does work and I could give you code that does it if you want.
From what I've done with it though, windows mess up the display and AMOS 
can't write to the windows directly.

You could do an entire 5-bitplane HAM screen if you really wanted to.
BTW: Most of the differences of the displays come from AMOS's copper list 
and not the bitmaps themselves.  The bitmaps will slide into a screen's 
bitmap structure directly.

Yes.  You still need to use intuition to do windowing though.

BTW, a Dutch TV-programme recently showed how autocues work. It was 
indeed a very simple screen scroller, one anybody could programme in 10 
lines of Amos. The only thing new I learned was that the 
news-presenter or an operator used a footpedal to control the speed of 
the scrolling.

Hi,

Is it stated anywhere in the amos(pro) manual that the 'Free'
function so happens to clear any 'Param' or 'Param$' ?!?!
(This cost me a lot of bug-searching!)

If anyone remembers my question about the (pro)compiler and my
large program (the big set buffer):
It helped much to have a number of 'F=Free' commands during
many string-operations, other than that,
it also helped much to make the buffer smaller. Which is a problem
because some 200 K of data must be read into array's (so whay not
use a Bank you'll say... alas, the most of the data will be
resized in the program, a bank would cost about 500K : too much)

When a compiled program gets stuck:

- change the order of your procedures
- Retokenize the program. This will correct most file errors
 (which are scarce, really ;-) )
- If using Data-lines, check out for comments etc. otherwise the
  compiler will be confused by this remarks.
- If using permanent banks, check if all the bank lengths are
  *even*. Not doing so will cause the compiler to create
  unexecuteable files.
- Try out both cli and wb executables.
- Try to reduce the string buffer size.
- Avoid dummy and trash strings where possible.
  Use DUMMY=Free in complicated string manipulation procedures.
- Ask Francois Lionet to fix the string bugs! :-)
- Give up. :-(

In case of very, very many string-operations:
these can be quite sure at fault:
Chris> "I've coded a lot of programs and my

Chris> it crashing after at least 30 seconds scrolling through large

Ya Andy:

   If this do'es work.  Could you upgrade your INTUITION extention to allow
your screen opens
to share a bitmap with Amos, instead of using the AMOSCOPY command.

    Only problem now, is the mouse.  The Amos mouse and Intuition's mouse
have nothing to 
do with each other.  You have no way of detecting zones.

-

Gau:
    Would you please send me a copy of your code.  I would like a chance to
play with this.

  According to his web page, you can reach him via E-mail at

Whoa hold on here, Ryan Scott had everything to do with Turbo Extension.  
He coordinated efforts from Manuel Andre, himself, me, and other 
programmers/designers to produce Turbo.  He did an excellent job (though 
he owes me some money)...

You sent it to the right person.  Nonetheless he has left the AMOS scene 
to make some money.  Hmmm.  it appears Ryan Scott has a web page.  
Something to do with NetCreations, Inc.

URL: http://www.netcreations.com/rscott/index.html

Maybe you can find some way of contacting him through NetCreations.

He does exist as rscott@netcreations.com, it seems to be an ftp-only site 
but E-mail is a possibility.

And if you find him, remind him that he owes Dave May $200.00!

Dave

You can get the Turbo+(Plus) extension from:

NorthWest Public Domain
P.O. Box 1617
Auburn, Wa 98071-1617
(206)351-9502 ask for John

The latest verion of Turbo+(Plus) is 2.0 which really isn't that much of an
update over 1.0 to be perfectly honest and I don't think Turbo+(Plus) is
being supported at least in the US anymore, but you still can get it from 
NorthWest Public Domain.

Still a good extension to have in your collection with many great comands 
at your dissposal along with an excellent colour font editor and scene 
editor.

Turbo v1.9 is very buggy on AMOSPro and doesn't include all the commands
that are in Turbo+(Plus).

Ok.You can find it in a lot of places.
If you have access to FTP, you simply have to connect to inca.gate.net.
You can find extension in directory pub/amos/software/extension.
Extension is archived with lha and it is damaged. Extension works fine 
but there are no manuals about it!
You can download Turbo19.lha from my homepage too.
Connect via Mosaic (or similar) to:

http://www.di.unito.it/pub/WWW/www_student/amiga/LucaFerraris/amosweb.html

See page "Amos Extensions" and download it. If you use Mosaic, select
option Load To Local Disk to download it on your hard-disk. If you are
using Netscape, press the SHIFT key click at the same time on the 
extension name.

Note: version present in my home-page is the same present via FTP on 
inca.gate.net!
However,i received from Mauro Fontana (MeF) the complete version with 
guides and manuals. It's not damaged and so i think i will put it 
on my hard-disk. So, you can try to connect next week to my home-page,
to download the complete version.

I think you have to thank Mauro Fontana!


I could e-mail it to the amoslist (uuencode) but i think it's not possible.
The size of archive is mote than 130K!

There was an autoque textscroller uploaded to aminet last week. I did not
check it out, but it could be exactly what you need.

Hi Martijn,

Sorry for taking so long getting back to you.

Thanks for getting in touch about my little problem.  Your 
doscall-calls would be very helpfull, especially if you can comment them.  My 
version of AMOS Pro came off the front of a magazine and I dont have the manual. 
 Being a student and all I dont have the funds to upgrade so any other 
programming tricks you dont mind sharing will be much welcomed.

At the moment I am developing a few PROCEDURES that Ive had to create 
for my programs and hoping to get most of them finished to either post to 
the list, up-load to AmiNet within the next few days.  Or if anyone wants 
them get in touch and Ill mail them (I have 2 versions so please state if you 
have the TURBO extensions).
These will include:

_3DBUTTON[]  ; done to death I know but I like mine
_3DBOX[]     ; probibly also done to death but Ive not see it
_ALERTBOX[]  ; allows box title, 6 lines of messages, upto 3 buttons
               (all automatically positioned) anywhere on screen
_EMBOSSBOX[] ; draw an embossed box any size anywhere on screen
_TELETYPE[]  ; display text 1 chr at a time, like the old telex 
machines
_EDGETEXT[]  ; puts a box around some text, sounds strange but I like 
it

Im also working on various other gadgets, such as sliders, cycle 
gadgets, tick boxes etc.  The main projects Im working on at the moment 
include a football statistic and (mayby) prediction system; and a program that 
will allow pre-Pro users to create interface boxes and screens 
interactivly, the source will then be saved as ASCII text to import back into programs. 
 this is the one Im most proud of but I cant workout how to save the 
information. Any ideas anyone?  I think saving it to a file like this will work:

Open Out 1,filename
.
.
Print #1,string-name

and then merging the resultant file with the program source you want 
to use it with.
(But I havent had time to try it yet.)

Gizmo,

Andy, are you the programmer of the Intuition extension for Amos?

Is it the same as the INTOS?

How much does it cost your extension? 

I'm really interested in using the Intuition through AMOS...

Thanks

Hi,
 
  A few days back I sent a message "Bits & Pieces", with a few questions on,
oddly enough bits and pieces. (Cheers for replying to anyone to did).
 
But I wasn't explicit enough on my q about WB and CLI compilation...
 
The problem is this, I've been trying to get tool-types working for an Amos
prog, but for some utterly weird reason, it doesn't seem to work. I would
usually throw MonAn (Monitor/Debugger that came with DevPac3) at the task, but
the code I wrote to read the tool types is in an included asm procedure, and I
would have to run through the entire Amos -startup code (ie crap) before
getting anywhere near where I am.
 
Help! Has anybody got this working - and no, I've looked - Easylife doesn't
*seem* to have it.
 
 
Cheers,
   Nick

Ed> Hello all,
Ed>     I'm new to this group so I'm just letting you all know who I am! :-)

Hello Eddie (?) :-) I should have done this, too ;-)

If anyone is interested (it got quite long, so get your coffee ready
;) ):

I've born on 26th December 1976, so I'm now 18 years old... my father
is an englishman, my mother is german and I think I have a rather good
knowledge of both languages... :-)

I got hold of my first amiga (500) in August 1986, and I coded a lot
of thingies in AmigaBasic (puke!) (I even wrote a kind of Gamedisk
containing some non-compiled programs %-)))) ), before I switched to
AMOS 1.0...

I've learned much from this time on and in November 1992 I licenced
my first AMOS Gamedisk#1 to The Software Society (the only company in
Germany, which seemed to be interested in AMOS-games), which didn't
sell well ('till now, I've sold unbelievable 7 (seven) disks!).
There were three games on it: Amotrix (a tetris clone for 1/2
players),
Messager (an agility game) and Ultimate Tron (guess what). The price
was 29,00 DM (aprox US $20)...

One month later, AMOS Help! (a accessory which is similar to the
AMOSPro Online Help, including help texts for all available
extensions in german and english, although it never was sold
overseas)
was released and got around a little bit better (34 disks in
total)...
it was updated up to 25.1.93...

Time passed... I've written various little programs for the
'AMOS VIP Club', which was part of The Software Society...

Gamedisk #3 was ready (Gamedisk #2 was a production of somebody else)
on 7.6.1993, contained two games Crack Out (break out clone) and
Free Trading Company (simulation), but sold even worse than
Gamedisk#1
(three disks, of which one was sold to a friend of mine ;-) )...

Meanwhile I start writing my first extension called PCGFC (which
should be some kind of 'PC-GraphicsFormatsConverter, but was soon
later renamed into AMCAF)...

Now, I see that it doesn't make sense to write commercial games
(no matter how good or bad they are) and so I write Strike Commander,
a Shareware dogfight game. (19.9.93)

It was the 12.11.93 when The Software Society phoned me and asked me
to convert TOME to AMOS Pro... half a month later, the TOME IV Pro
Version was finshed. This time, I requested a fixed sum, so I weren't
dependent of the profits share... :-)

December came and therefore another RAMSES Computerclub Developer
Party (RAMSES is a private club, we founded in 1985). We started to
code another tron version and I told my friend, that I would write a
amiga version of it in a few weeks... and so I wrote MegaTron, my
second AMOS Sharewaregame for up to 7 human players and 10 players in
total, featuring many weapons, events, options etc...

January 1994. I buy my modem and a whole new world is open to me.
Coding on AMCAF is running at high speed... 'Mr. Software Society'
suprised me, when he told me, that I'll gonna go to France to meet
F. Lionet to get all the essential informations etc. for an *AGA*
*UPDATE* of AMOS... you can't think, how happy I've been.

Then 25.03.1994: Europress is not interested in an AGA update and I
don't go to France... :-{{{{ I said to myself, that I will give up
AMOS after AMCAF has been completed...

Again, some time passes... September 1994... I acquired the job to
translate the whole Klik'n'Play (Klik'n'Play is a kind of Gamemaker
for Wintendo, but no commands are used, as all is done by dragin'
and droppin'. Guess, who has coded this stupid thing?) manual
within a month (they delivered it nearly a month later than
planned). I were under real pressure (don't forget, that I'm
a schoolboy ;-)) and the translation went somewhat badly...
Europress were really annoyed about the poor translation bla bla
but this is another story ;-)

Some time ago, I also wrote Tubes, a pipeline game... soon to be
seen on AmiNet, if nothing goes wrong ;-)

The AMCAF-Extension V1.0 was released on 16.10.1994. I cannot say,
how much has been sold until now, but I seems that most people are
very pleased with AMCAF... it was updated to 1.18 some months later
and the translation of the manual (which will not be so poor as
the Klik'n'Play one!) began... 50% are translated by now and I hope
to finish it within a month...

The story so far...

BOOO! Wake up! ;-))

Ed> At the moment I use Amos 1.3+comp. on a 500 with 1meg.  I do have AmosPro from

1 MB is not enough for AMOS Pro ;-(

Ed> So, I'm a bit lazy!!!!!!  I'm waiting for a Harddrive before I do anything

Get your harddrive soon! ;-) It's really a big step from a disk
system to a hard drive system...

You'll never want to work with disks again! ;-)

Ed> When I started using Amos, I needed to set up a large 2d Array (For map
Ed> storage - 200*200)   Unfortunately, AMOS doesn't handle anything this large,

It does, what stops you doing so?! ;-) Use the command Set Buffer
when running out of variable space :-)

Ed> which stumped me for a good while.  (Is this bug fixed in AMOS Pro? - You can
Ed> define the array, but if you write to areas of it the machine hangs!!!).

Never heard of this bug, euh? :-?

Ed> If anyone else has this problem ..... I HAVE A SOLUTION!!!!!!

This is a very /old/ solution ;-) But with huge arrays, you're right
;-)

Ed>     This may seem a little complicated, but it is a lot faster than the DIM
Ed> function and allows you to define a larger array!!!!  It is also stored as a
Ed> data bank allowing the easy loading and saving to disk!!!

Right ;-)

Ok... first, check out these simple load and save routines... (the
original Tubes routines)

Procedure LOAHISC
' The next line would create an empty hiscore list, if it doesn't exist.
  If Exist("Tubes.his")=0 Then CLRHISC : SAVHISC : Pop Proc
  Wload "Tubes.his",8 : Rem AMCAF command. See replacement below.
  ST=Start(8)
  For A=1 To 15
    HISC$(A)=Peek$(ST,12) : Add ST,12 : Rem holds the name of the player
    HISC(A,0)=Deek(ST) : Add ST,2 : Rem contains the score
    HISC(A,1)=Deek(ST) : Add ST,2 : Rem and this one, the level reached
  Next 
End Proc

Procedure SAVHISC
  Reserve As Work 8,15*(12+2+2)
  ST=Start(8)
  For A=1 To 15
    Poke$ ST,HISC$(A) : Add ST,12
    Doke ST,HISC(A,0) : Add ST,2
    Doke ST,HISC(A,1) : Add ST,2
  Next 
  Request Off 
  Trap Wsave "Tubes.his",8
  Request On 
  Erase 8
End Proc

For you, these should look like:

Procedure _LOADHISCORE
  Open In 1,"Hiscore.dat" : L=Lof(1) : Close 1
  Reserve As Work 8,L
  ST=Start(8)
  For A=1 To 10 : Rem assuming your hiscore table contains 10 entries
    HISC$(A)=Peek$(ST,12) : Add ST,12
'   ^^^^ is the array, that contains the playernames, which is fixed
'        to 12 chars.
    HISC(A)=Leek(ST) : Add ST,4
'   ^^^^ contains the score of the player
  Next
End Proc

Procedure _SAVEHISCORE
  Reserve As Work 8,10*(12+4) : Rem space for 10 players*(12 bytes
'                                   name+4 for the score).
  ST=Start(8)
  For A=1 To 10
    Poke$ ST,HISC$(A) : Add ST,12 : Rem writes the name into the bank
    Loke ST,HISC(A) : Add ST,4 : Rem writes the score
  Next
  Bsave "Hiscore.dat",Start(8) To ST
End Proc

Then, here comes the Hiscore-Table part:

[blabla...]
' Check if is better than the worst entry ;-)
If SCORE>HISC(10) Then Gosub ENTERHISC
[blabla...]


ENTERHISC:
' The first step is to find out his rank.
  For A=10 To 1 Step -1
    If SCORE>HISC(A) Then RANK=A Else Exit
  Next 
' Then push down all entries by one.
  For A=9 To RANK Step -1
    HISC$(A+1)=HISC$(A)
    HISC(A+1)=HISC(A)
  Next 
' Fill in the players data
  HISC$(RANK)=Space$(12)
  HISC(RANK)=SCORE
' Now fill in your input routine. Please not that the length of the
' name string must always be 12 chars!

' This is the original Tubes Hiscore part:
  Gosub HISCORESCREEN
  T[232,"You made it! Enter your name!"]

There's another way... in Tubes I use four 320x256 screens... the 4

Subject: Anim to bob grabber
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Wanted beta testers (only two or three)

I've just finished writting a utility for amos that takes a anim (Dpaint
mode 5 animation) and converts it to a sprite/or bob bank.

The idea is that you can create your bobs in Dpaint (or any similar paint
program) and animate them there until you get nice smooth movement. Then
using my utility you can grab this animation as bobs for use in amos.

The first colour (background) must be black, but otherwise it's all
automatic, including automagically checking for bob sizes. 

I now need a few beta testers to test it and give me feedback and
suggestions.
I will only give this out to a few people (I don't want a lot of buggy
versions going out and getting passed around before the final version is
finished), and I expect feedback.
Please do not ask for it if you are not willing to test it and give
feedback.

	I don't know anything about the Turbo Plus Scene Editor but if
        you mean that once you have a "map", how do you perform collision
        detection and object interaction then I can help you.

        By map, I mean that you some data that descibes how your scene or
        screen is to be created.  

        In general you have to transform from screen- or object-space into
        map-space.  Once you are working in map-space you can easily
        determine what to do.

        To begin, lets use an example of a simple break-out (or araknoid)
        type game.  The map you create would represent the layout of
        level: this is map-space.  To construct the screen-space you
        have transform the representation from the map to the screen.
        If you're using an extension, such as Turbo, then this is most
        likely a built-in command.  This step would actually paste
        the tiles (or icons) to the screen.  Now the "ball" that
        travels around the screen is your object-space.  You have
        to transform the object-space into the map-space to determine
        if the ball has collided with a brick, a boudary, or nothing.

        To transform from object-space to map-space, you have to find
        how the current position of the object (the ball) on the screen
        corresonds to its location in the map.  For this case of
        a simple break-out game you would do the calculations as follows:

            MAP X Co-ordinate = (BALL X Co-ordinate) / (TILE X Size)
            MAP Y Co-ordinate = (BALL Y Co-ordinate) / (TILE Y Size)
            (NOTE: / here means integer division)

        so if the ball was at (220,100) on the screen and the tiles
        were 16x16 pixels then the ball would be at (13,6) in the
        map.  It should be noted here that in this case the screen
        and object-space are equivalent, but they won't always be.

        Now that you know the ball is at location (13,6) you have to
        look up into the map to find what "tile" is at (13,6).  This
        look up depends on how you have implemented your map-datatype.
        Once you know what tile the ball is on you have to decide what
        to do.  I usally implement this by having a set of values associated
        with each tile, these values could represent what type of tile
        this was.  Once you know what tile the ball is on, say 47, you
        have to look up the type of this tile.  This value could
        represent that their was no collision (i.e. a background tile)
        or that it has struck a brick.  If there was no collison then
        you do nothing but if their was a collison then you have to 
        remove the brick from the screen and invert the sign on the
        balls y-vector.

        Of course the first value of the tile could give the type and
        once knowing it is a brick you could go and look up in another
        set of values what type of brick it was you struck.  This is
        all up to you.

        This can easily be extended to scrolling platform games, such
        as mario bros.  If you want this explained or you need more
        detail just ask.  I hope this helps.

Hi all,

I tried (a long time ago) to open the req. library using amos1.3
This worked fine. But I could not open the requester, everytime I
got a guru (8000 0004). So I started investigating but could not find
anything wrong.

The openlib-function from exec can be called as follows:

A1=pointer to "req.library"+chr(0) string
D0=version (eg. 0)
result=Execall(-552)

Works like a breeze and returns the library base in 'result'
Ok, you'd say. Just to test this, I tried for example a deek to
the library-base minus offset for some function. And indeed this
returns the op-code for the JMP command. A leek to the following four
bytes indeed shows a perfectly allright address within the 68k's space.

To simplify things even more I tried:

_EXEBASE = Leek(4)

This returns the current base of the 'exec.library' in _EXEBASE.
To open a library you'd think that a simple call to 
call _exebase-552
and having set the a1 and d0 registers would work. Not so.
It will crash. Only calls to a library function that does NOT
need parameters will work.
What does this suggest ?, well clearly the 'Call' command does
not seem to be interested in the areg and dreg-settings.

Does anyone know if this can be overcome easily or do I have
to use a 'bank' with some MOVE.L's to registers and THEN the
call ? (rather bothersome I guess and close to the AmosPro
Lib Call command!)

'AMOS 1.3, load a library: 
B$="intuition.library"+Chr$(0)
Areg(1)=Varptr(B$)
Dreg(0)=0

  'This WON't WORK!!
   _EXEBASE=Leek(4)
   Call Leek(_EXEBASE-552+2) : Rem openlin-function 


 _INTBASE=Dreg(0)

  'And this WILL work *help* 
   _INTBASE=Execall(-552)

Also, does anyone know what place to put the 'bitmap'-struct when
using amos ?
I tried opening a screen with intuition and intcall. Works ok.
Then I supply the screenbase with 'CUSTOM-BITMAP' (bit 6 of some offset)
and then I open an Amos-screen with the same dimension and put use:
loke (scr_base+184+8),leek (screen base)
loke (scr_base+184+12),leek (screen base+4)
to replace the pointers of the bitmap to my own amos-bitmaps
Works fine, when a 'rethinkdisplay' is called it shows the contents of
the amos-screen in the intuition-screen.
But this way, I trash the two bitplanes from the original intuition
screen!
(This way of putting an amos-screen in an intuitionscreen is VERY use-
full because the REQTOOL-requester will appear on your 'amos-screen'
in intuition, however, you'll have to rebuild you bitmap).

Sorry for the long message. I hope anyone will comment on this ?

    Just incase some of you were wondering about my alias.....

My real name is Tim Lewis.
My alias is Eddie.

Why?  Well, I'm a big fan of Iron Maiden and for those of you who don't know
they have a mascot called "Eddie"!!!!  One things leads to another, advocacy
upon my part and then, what do you know!  I end up with the nickname of ...

    See if you can guess .....

    Thats right Eddie!!!! :-)

This might sound extremely sad & on reflection it is.  Then again I don't
really care!!!!  Up the Irons!

AND NOW A MORE RELEVANT MESSAGE ...........

    The AMOS scroll routine sucks!  I need to scroll an area of screen which
is about 154x154 pixels.  This needs to be done STRICTLY within these limits.
I can't use dual screens either because of the necessary display of this
screen.  Are there any clever bods out there who can (or want!) to tell me how
to this by screen memory copying etc.  I know it can be done, but I don't
really have the spare time to do it myself!!

    Any other solutions would also be appreciated.  It might send my mind
racing of in a new direction.

    I'm writing a LARGE!!! RPG at the moment.  I should hopefully have a Beta
test version sometime over summer!  If anyone is interested .....  If anyone
has any ideas about what they would like to see in an RPG then let me know.
I will try and incorporate them if I can.  I do need some fast scrolling
routines though.  HELP!!!!!!!

A POINT TO REFLECT UPON...........

    They may have been a good side to the C= liquidation.  Did you notice the
frequency of all the new stuff uploaded to Aminet increased since that
infamous start of procedings! :-)  Every cloud has a silver lining.

Long Live The AMIGA!

Tim.

I need a GET statement for AMOS Pro.  The a$=Input$(2,1) instruction will read
a single character from a file, but it WAITS until something is entered.

I need something that will check a file for a single character and GO ON if
there is nothing there.

In any normal basic, Get #2, A$ would work, but AMOS has no comparable
instruction that I can find.  I tried using:
Do
Z=Eof(2)
if Z=True Then Loop
A$=Input$(2,1)

But Z is ALWAYS true, so this method doesn't work either.

The program is monitoring the STDIN channel and waiting for a key.  I am trying
to make it so that the routine doesn't hang if there is no input from STDIN.  I
need a `Get a single byte, go on if nothing there' instruction.

Well met and godspeed,

Just set an 'Illegal' asm command just before your tool types code,
then assemble it again and feed it into a procedure... save and start
monam... run through, until you come to this illegal exception and
then press Ctrl-S to skip it... then you are on the very right point
and you can debug your code as you like to ;-)

Hi everyone!

Does anyone know how to do the equivalent of an "avail flush" in AmosPro? 

I have a game that plays music using Paul Reece's Enhanced Music 
Extension v4.64.  I find that if I play the game after I've been using 
my Amiga for a while, the music causes random bits of garbled graphics 
to show up on my screen - obviously these are unused bits of data lurking 
in memory.  If I do an "avail flush" in CLI and then run the game, there 
is no flickering.

So does anyone know how to flush memory? I'd welcome any help :))

*wave*
Stuart.

Easylife has an instruction to do this, but I can't for the life of 
me remember what I called it - It probably begins with "El", but 
after that its anyones guess although to syllables "in" and "get" 
probably feature somewhere in it :-). Look in the manual under 
AmigaDos commands.

Call does read the Areg & Dreg settings, but it also expects the 
routine called to preserve the values in registers A3-A6. Most 
library routines will not do this so AMOS may crash after calling 
them. LibCall knows this and stores the registers first. Also, some 
libraries except to be called with their own base in register A6, and 
call would not do this.

Thats the best way. You can of course make use of the fact that the 
call command can take additional parameters which are placed on a 
stack off register A3 to pass the library base & offset of the 
routine to call. E.g. If the AMOS Code was "Call BNKNO,LIBBASE,OFFSET"

The bank code would be

	move.l	(a3)+,d7	;d7=offset
	add.l		(a3)+,d7	;d7=address to call
	movem.l	a3-6,-(sp)	;Preserve registers
	move.l	d7,a6
	jsr		(a6)
	movem.l	(sp)+,a3-6
	rts

NOTE: This assumes the library call does not use register D7, but I 
think your safe for most calls.

A friend of mine sent me the Demo version 1.3 of your extension.
I have tried it. But I didn't work. I had an message saying that tha Amos 
could not loaded the extension and to use the default configuration.
This before I started SnoopDos to see where the Amos failed. The strange 
thing is that the extension was loaded!
I repeated the event. Without SnoopDOs... nothing. Whith snoopdos running 
(and so delaying everything) Amos loaded the extension and started 
normally, but seeing the about on the loaded extension didn't give any 
name in the slot n14. The extension was there but his name not.
What's wrong? It is a regular thing (I think it is not !)?
Has the registered version the same problems?

Has anyone had my problems?

THanks

It can, just extract the size from file info block returned by 
examine/examine next. I don't have the offset to hand, but look in 
the dos.h / dos.i file of commodore includes, or any decent C/Asm 
programming book for a description of the FIB structure.

But why are you doing this - I know AMOS is full of bugs but I've 
never had trouble with the DirFirst$() / DirNext$ functions!

Hi,

Yes, it can.

When the 'Examine'-call is made, the 'FileInfoBlock' is read
This block is the header of the file and contains all information
about the file such as the protection flags, the size, the time and
date and the filenote.
So all the information is already in the bank when the filename is read
from it.
I do not know where what information is stord, however :-(
But I try to print some more of the bank used and find the place
where the size of the file is kept in it.

Hi all,

The other day, Tumu / BFB team <tumu@janus.otol.fi
posted a message containing the code needed to make use of the
reqtools requesters rtezrequest and rtfilrequest. They used a function

_RTFILENAMEPTR=Ma Malloc(108,Mem Public+Mem Clear)

in their code. I suppose this is to do a 'allocmem' from exec and this
can be done without the extension they propose. The easiest way is
to make use of :

Reserve as work 6,108
Poke$ Start(6),String$(chr$(0),108)
_RTFILENAMEPRT=Start(6)

Further, they use the Elmem$ functions to read out the text, this
can also be done with:

_RTFILE$=Peek$(_RTFILENAMEPRT,108,chr$(0))

which leads to the exact same result. However, there may be a reason
to do this as they did, if there is: Please post a message explaining
why!

Also:
I use the following code in my program to create an intuition-screen
and replace the bitmap-pointers with the ones from the amos-screen.
That way, you'll see your amos-screen in the intuiscreen, and thus it
should be possible to have the reqtools on your amos-screen. After
the requesters are done, you can put the intuiscreen away.
There are two serious flaws in this design (other than the ones you
might detect :-) 
a) the openscreen-call will create two bitmaps i don't use.
   (this can be overcome because the bitmaps can buffer the
    amos-screen but it costs some chipmem...)
b) Nico Francois clearly states in his documents on RT that one
   should *not* use the 'screen'-tag to decide on which screen the
   requester is to come. One should use 'pubscreen' instead.
The problem is: how do I set the 'screen'-tag in the taglist or what
ever it is called in amos ? I studied the c-source 'demo.c'-file in the
distribution but I have no idea where I must 'loke' my screen-base in
order to have RT recognize it.

Anyone ?

MW> Does anyone know if this can be overcome easily or do I have

No. AMOS requires the registers A3-A6 and D6/D7 to be unmodified and
many library calls *require* the library base address in A6...

I had the same problems, and so I wrote some workaround...

Long time ago, I tried this and it worked (although you could do some
optimations)...

main
.dr0    ds.l    14
.ar6    dc.l    0
.rout   dc.l    0
	movem.l d0-d7/a0-a6,-(sp)
	lea     .ende(pc),a0
	move.l  a0,-(sp)
	lea     .dr0(pc),a6
	move.l  (a6)+,d0
	move.l  (a6)+,d1
	move.l  (a6)+,d2
	move.l  (a6)+,d3
	move.l  (a6)+,d4
	move.l  (a6)+,d5
	move.l  (a6)+,d6
	move.l  (a6)+,d7
	move.l  (a6)+,a0
	move.l  (a6)+,a1
	move.l  (a6)+,a2
	move.l  (a6)+,a3
	move.l  (a6)+,a4
	move.l  (a6)+,a5
	move.l  (a6)+,a6
	move.l  .ar6(pc),a6
	move.l  .rout(pc),-(sp)
	rts
.ende   lea     .ar6(pc),a6
	move.l  a5,-(a6)
	move.l  a4,-(a6)
	move.l  a3,-(a6)
	move.l  a2,-(a6)
	move.l  a1,-(a6)
	move.l  a0,-(a6)
	move.l  d7,-(a6)
	move.l  d6,-(a6)
	move.l  d5,-(a6)
	move.l  d4,-(a6)
	move.l  d3,-(a6)
	move.l  d2,-(a6)
	move.l  d1,-(a6)
	move.l  d0,-(a6)
	movem.l (sp)+,d0-d7/a0-a6
	rts

I assembled it and saved it into a bank... the first 15 longwords
hold the data registers d0 to d7 and a0-a6...

The address of the routine to call is placed in the 16th longword
(i.e LibBase+Offset)

The results can be read out from the same addresses the registers
were written into...
 
Then a wrote some library-procedures that allowed librarycalls in a
way like:

OPENLIB["dos"]
LIBCALL2["dos","Lock",Varptr(NAME$),-2]
LOCK=RES : If LOCK=0 Then Print "ERROR!" : Return
LIBCALL2["dos","Examine",LOCK,Start(9)]
If RES=0 Then Print "Empty!" : LIBCALL1["dos","Unlock",LOCK] : Return
...

It was rather slow (due of the offset search), but it worked...


MW> Also, does anyone know what place to put the 'bitmap'-struct when
MW> using amos ?

Hmm... I don't really know what you mean... give me some more
information please :)

MW> I tried opening a screen with intuition and intcall. Works ok.
MW> Then I supply the screenbase with 'CUSTOM-BITMAP' (bit 6 of some offset)

Are you opening the screen using CUSTOM_BITMAP or hacking it into
afterwards?

You should use logbase(x) though...

There a other way round... there *are* intuition elements and
structures for a AMOS screen already (rastport, bitmap, layer and
layerregion). Why not implement them directly into a intuition
screen?

MW> (This way of putting an amos-screen in an intuitionscreen is VERY use-

You're right... But it is very useless to write intuition programs
using amos because
a) you create executables of huge size.
b) you need a lot of system experience
c) you could write it more easyly in C++.
d) AMOS causes a overhead which requires more processor time.
e) AMOS programs do not multitask (i.e if you start two amos
programs, one will be frozen)

I was trying to come up with an algrorthm the other day to determine the
most frequently occuring number in a group of numbers.

ie out of X numbers how many times does such a number occur and what is the
most frequent number.

Note: This is different from taking the average 

I came up with a solution, but it was ugly and very badly coded. I was also
long!

Does anyone have any neat answers?

You can use both ways to reserve the reqbuffer and rtfilenamebuffer but I 
like using Easylife and Makes lib commands because they are easier to 
use and Makes lib memory allocation routines are System friendly.

And I forgotted to mention that you'll need Easylife extension as well if 
you are going to use original Reqtools routines without modifications.

Try and allocate an impossibly large amount of memory to a bank - the 
Amiga OS memory manager will find it cannot, and perform an avail
flush to try to free the memory. Something like Reserve bank 
14,$70000000 should to the trick.

Or you can execute the "Avail" CLI command from within AMOS!

If you wanna find the size of a file just try:

open in 1,"filename"
L=Lof(1)
close 1

I never had problems with them either, BUT: when you do a 'DirFirst$',
amos read the entire directory. So there's not much sense in having to
do a 'DirNext$' other than the patternmatching. (Which is also in
some extensions..;-) The advantage of reading it using calls is the
possibillity to realy read one entry at a time and thus allow the 
(diskette-)user to select an entry before the entire directory is read.
More like the filerequesters.

Note that again you should not break the program... use the ESC key

(otherwise type Loke Areg(5)+$8BC,0 in the direct mode immediately
after the interruption)

I hope this will help you out a bit...

You can use both ways to reserve the reqbuffer and rtfilenamebuffer but I 
like using Easylife and Makes lib commands because they are easier to 
use and Makes lib memory allocation routines are System friendly.

And I forgotted to mention that you'll need Easylife extension as well if 
you are going to use original Reqtools routines without modifications.

Where's the problem?

Either use Screen Copy or the Scroll routines in conjunction with the
Clip-Command, which will perfectly stay inside your specified
limits...

However, I cannot imagine how to get such weird dimensions as
154x154... :-)

Look at this example program... it contains *one* Screen Copy command
for *all* directions...

Screen Open 0,320,256,4,0
Curs Off : Flash Off : Paper 0 : Pen 1

Ink 1,0 : Bar 0,0 To 320,256

  Wait Vbl 
  DX=Jleft(1)-Jright(1)
  DY=Jup(1)-Jdown(1)
  Screen Copy 0,X+Max(0,DX),Y+Max(0,DY),X+154+Min(DX,0),Y+154+Min(DY,0) To 0,X-Min(DX,0),Y-Min(DY,0)

Such unused bits should never be accessed by any program...

IMHO it's a wrong screen display/screen offset setting which causes
this crap graphics... where do there errors appear? Only in the
bottom of the screen or right in the current screen graphics?

Subject: anim2bob grabber
Status: RO
X-Status: 

I have now send off the beta version to all who wanted to be beta testers
of the anim2bob grabber. If you asked for a copy and did not receive it,
let me know so I can resend it.

I will release version 1.0 hopefully in a week or 2 when I get some feed
back from the beta testers.
Changes to come in V1.0 already include:

2 seperate versions. 
     One for Hard disk users. This will load as an accessory and auto
install. Very easy to use, simply press install. 
     The other for floppy users with small memory (ie a standard 500 or
2000). This will be a stand alone program that will save the bobs/sprites
into a file.

2 diferent ways of grabbing the anims.
     The version that was included in the beta version. It finds the
largest bob and grabs them all to that size.
     The other grabs the smallest size possible for each bob.

Option to save to disk as well as letting the object editor grab them.


I will post a uuencoded version of 1.0 in two weeks to the list (35K) if no
one objects ( and I mean no-one!). If some one does object to this let me
know (privately if you like) and I will come up with another way. 
The reason for this is that some people pay for their messsages, and if
they don't want it, thay shouldn't pay for it. Fair enough!

I am not sure what the files are called, but if you dl/view the INDEX 
file first you'll be able to find out yourself.

	The way HAM works is that the first pixel of every line defines a
color. The pixel beside it changes only one aspect of that color, either the
red, green or blue aspect. This pattern is repeated across the entire line
of  the graphics screen, each pixel only containing the change in one aspect pf
the color. By getting the pixel color, you are really only getting the value
of the change in one aspect of the previouse color. To calculate the color you
must actually apply the changes made to the first pixel of the line up to and

but I am sure someone could supply you with that information.

   HAM mode uses a base of 16 colors.  AMOS treats these like the colors of 
any ordinary 16 color screen.  A color index value of 0-15 in AMOS 
functions refers to one of these base colors.
   HAM stands for 'Hold And Modify'.  To display its thousands of colors, 
HAM 'Holds' the value of a pixel and allows you to 'Modify' the red, green, 
or blue value of the pixel to the right of it.  Color index values 16-63 
refers to the value the previous pixel is modified by:

  values 16-31: replace previous BLUE value  (new intensity=value-16)
  values 32-47: replace previous RED value   (new intensity=value-32)
  values 48-63: replace previous GREEN value (new intensity=value-48)

Example:
  Color 1,$fff        <- set index 1 to all white 
  Plot 1,1,1          <- plot white pixel on screen
  Plot 2,1,50         <- modifies the green value of the previous pixel to a 
                         very dim value.  This second pixel will be very 
                         magenta.

So... If you are trying to find the RGB value of a point on a HAM screen, 
its a tad messy.  You have to keep checking points to the left until you 
find a base color; reach the beginning of the line; or come across a 
modified red, green, and blue value.  Here's a rough outline that sould work:

CHECK THE CURRENT POINT
   if it has index value 0-15
      use the colour function to get the RGB value
      if this is not your first check
         modify with the value(s) you are keeping track of
      DONE
   else
      if you are not keeping track of this color already
         remember the modified color and intensity
         if you are now keeping track of a red, green, and blue value
            use this value with the other ones you have
            DONE
      if this is the first horizontal pixel
         use the value(s) you have, and use 0 for the missing one(s)
         DONE
      else
         move one pixel to the left, and GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING

I did once write a recursive procedure that did this but it was painfully 
slow and I deleted it. :}

You dont need to do this.  The menu items have keyboard shortcuts 
anyway.  You can call them by using the Call Editor or Ask Editor 
commands.  Look up the docs on accessories.

	Well as it says in the Amos Manual, a Ham screen doesn't map the
colors on the screen to the color index.  Only the first 16 colors can be
set from the palette, the other 48 are all preset.  Not sure what order its
in (I don't have the manual with me), but I think its something like
Red,Blue,green - thats is 16-31 are shades of red etc....

	This is cos of the way ham works, it uses the base 16 colors as
normal, but the reds, greens and blues just alter the current pixels color
relative to the previous pixel.

	Say you have black as color 0.  And you plot a point with it.  And
then the next point is 31 (max red) and then the next is whatever max blue
is.  You'd end up with a black pixel, then a red pixel, and then a purple
pixel.  That is where the color fringing you get comes from on really badly
scanned images.

	So to find out the color of a point on a ham screen - you'll have to
look at all the pixels to the left of it, until you find the left hand side
of the screen, or one of the first 16 colors.

Chris
PS Of course that lot is all for the OCS ham mode (4096 colors) *8).

That's not precise.
It is not the firs pixel on the screen which determine the colour... 
otherwise you could not have black and withe on the same line.

The HAM works this way (for HAM6):

The HAM is based on the fact that real good picture have lots of shade 
which can be "compressed" in less bits.
You have a base palette of 16 colors. Now, the screen is done by 6 planes 
(thta's why HAM6!).
The color of a pixel is described as follows:
the first 4 bit of the pixel (the first 4 bit-planes) tell you which color 
of the palette had to be used as the reference color.
The last 2 bits (last two bitplanes) carry these informations:
If both bits are 00 the color is used pure that's you see the same color 
which is stored in the palette base.
If I remember right the following value refer to RGB shades as follows...
If bit 1 is set to 1 you have a shade in the RED value of the color.
If bit 2 is set to 1 you have a shade in the GREEN value of the color
IF bit 1 is set to 1 and bit 2 is sey to 1 you have a shade in the BLUE 
value of the color.

So a pixel can different from the next on the left only of a single 
component of the color or it have to belong to the base palette set.

That's why you can't have smooth horizontal grey shades (but you can have 
smooth horizontal red, blue, green shades). A grey shade implies you 
firstly pass through the RED, the GREEN and the BLUE shade to finally 
reach the desired grey shade.
That is there are two pixels on the screen which are not of the desired 
color... that's called fringing.

Hope this will help.

    The scrolling thing.  The problem with using the scrolling in conjunction
with clip, is it doesn't clip properly.  Don't forget this is AMOS 1.3xxx that
I'm using (I am going to set up AMOS Pro soon!!!! - I need some more floppies
and a hard drive first!!!!).

    Thanks for the routine, I'll give it a go!!!  The game does indeed use
maps and tiles :-)  The only way to do it really!!!  I've written my own
custom editor for this!!!!

    When I quoted a scrolling area of 154x154 I was indeed wrong.  I am crap
at maths really!!!!!!  This should be 144x144 of course!!!! (16*9)x(16x9).

    Ho hum.  If you're wondering what the hell this is all about, the message
was getting sooooo long with the forwards, I thought I'd start from scratch
again.

Probably because the colour of a pixel on a HAM screen is dependent 
on the colour of the pixels preceeding it on the same horizontal 
line - each pixel either sets a new base colour (Values 0-15), or 
modifies one of the red, green or blue values of the preceeding 
pixel's colour. If you just read one pixel's colour, it is 
meaningless without looking at those preceeding it (Unless it has a 
colour index in the range 0-15).

The other explanation is there may be bug in the point command (Now 
that *would* be a suprise!)

Your missing the point. What Darryl wants to do is write a program 
which adds an extra option onto the end of the user menu that wasn't
there before. How can you use a keyboard shortcut if the menu items 
not there.

The AMOS equivilent of an installer script for an AMOSPro accessory - 
An AMOS program you run to integrate another AMOS program into the 
editor. If you have downloaded my easylife extension and installed 
all the accessories into the editor, you would know how useful such a 
program would be. Unfortunately the necessary functions aren't 
supported by Ask Editor/Call Editor, so the only way forward is to 
hack the editor configuration file. Does anyone know the format, as I 
too would like to make my accessories install themselves.

Hi all,
    If anyone has tried to mail me direct in the last 10 days could 
they plaese re-send messages.  My files have been corupted and am

isn't important, any answers will have to wait until the end of the

Sorry for the problem,  [8-)

Using TOME? I hope not ;-) The AMOS Professional Version of TOME IV

   Hi folk:
	
	Is there a way to chain compiled programs? It seems that
the RUN instruction works only with source AMOS codes and doesn't
accept compiled files. This is true for the classic package, I don't
own the AmosPro Compiler (maybe can't be found in Italy!) and I
have to solve this problem for the old version... do you know
a way to by-pass this problem? Please let me know...
(I have Kickstart/Workbench 1.3)


P.S. [READ ME, PLEASE]

	I just need the Amiga Format coverdisk 71b (the one that
contains Death Mask). If you have it please send it to me (DMSing
and uuencoding it) or let me know how can I find it thru the net

	I can't send it back to UK as it would takes ages to 
arrive here in Italy... If you want I can also demonstrate I've
bought the mag.

P.P.S. [READ ME IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME]

	How about the Amos competition? I have not enterd it because
deadline was too early (It needs at least two weeks to send something
in UK - just about 10 days to "cross" Italy!), I don't know if there
are news on it... I buy AF when I find it - usually one or even two
months later it's appeared in the UK! Having few problems with "my"
(actually: of the university!) terminal I can't access to the WWW, so
I can't read the FutureNet site...

	Don't forget about AF71b!

Hello,
   I have a question here. I am coding a football thingie, and want to 
make the program open different windows/screens dependant upon the users 
configuration. (example: if user has only 2.0, or < maybe I would open a 
screen 640x400 interlaced. If user has 3.0+ with display card, I want to 
only open windows on the WB screen - say 640x400 not laced)

   My problem is how to find out what the user has. (I could use WB 
screen as a default.) I know I have started to track the 
Env:sys/screenmode.prefs; but do not know how to parse it. (And is this 
eve there for older machines/os's?

   Thanks ahead of time!!!!

Hi,
I'm writing a program to help play the BBS game Trade Wars. Right now,
I'm getting the CIM data in my Term buffer, saving it, and loading it 
into my prg. What I want to do is add a simple term to the program
in order to aotomate this whole process and keep more up to date data
while playing. My problem is that I can't figure out how to implement
the ANSI codes (I can't even actually find a list of the codes). Has 
anyone done this already that would like to share the code?? Maybe an
extension somewhere??

Thanks in Advance!

Abbreviations:

Intro  an Introducer of some kind of defined sequence; the normal 7-bit
       X3.64 Control Sequence Introducer is the two characters "Escape ["

Delim  a Delimiter

x/y    identifies a character by position in the ASCII table (column/row)

EdF    editor function (see explanation)

FE     format effector (see explanation)

F      is a Final character in
	    an Escape sequence (F from 3/0 to 7/14 in the ASCII table)
	    a control sequence (F from 4/0 to 7/14)

Gs     is a graphic character appearing in strings (Gs ranges from
       2/0 to 7/14) in the ASCII table

Ce     is a control represented as a single bit combination in the C1 set
       of controls in an 8-bit character set

C0     the familiar set of 7-bit ASCII control characters

C1     roughly, the set of control characters available only in 8-bit systems.
       This is too complicated to explain fully here, so read Jim Fleming's
       article in the February 1983 BYTE, especially pages 214 through 224.

Fe     is a Final character of a 2-character Escape sequence that has an
       equivalent representation in an 8-bit environment as a Ce-type
       (Fe ranges from 4/0 to 5/15)

Fs     is a Final character of a 2-character Escape sequence that is
       standardized internationally with identical representation in 7-bit
       and 8-bit environments and is independent of the currently
       designated C0 and C1 control sets (Fs ranges from 6/0 to 7/14)

I      is an Intermediate character from 2/0 to 2/15 (inclusive) in the
       ASCII table

P      is a parameter character from 3/0 to 3/15 (inclusive) in the ASCII
       table

Pn     is a numeric parameter in a control sequence, a string of zero or
       more characters ranging from 3/0 to 3/9 in the ASCII table

Ps     is a variable number of selective parameters in a control sequence
       with each selective parameter separated from the other by the code
       3/11 (which usually represents a semicolon); Ps ranges from
       3/0 to 3/9 and includes 3/11

Format Effectors versus Editor Functions

A format effector specifies how the final output is to be created.
An editor function allows you to modify the specification.

For instance, a format effector that moves the "active position" (the 
cursor or equvalent) one space to the left would be useful when you want to
create an overstrike, a compound character made of two standard characters
overlaid. Control-H, the Backspace character, is actually supposed to be a
format effector, so you can do this. But many systems use it in a
nonstandard fashion, as an editor function, deleting the character to the
left of the cursor and moving the cursor left. When Control-H is assumed to
be an editor function, you cannot predict whether its use will create an
overstrike unless you also know whether the output device is in an "insert
mode" or an "overwrite mode". When Control-H is used as a format effector,
its effect can always be predicted. The familiar characters carriage
return, linefeed, formfeed, etc., are defined as format effectors.

NOTES ON THE DEC VT100 IMPLEMENTATION

In the case of the popular DEC VT100 video-terminal implementation,
the only mode that may be altered is the linefeed/newline (LNM) mode.
Other modes are considered permanently set, reset, or not applicable
as follows:

     Set:   ERM
     Reset: CRM, EBM, FEAM, FETM, IRM, KAM, PUM, SRTM, TSM
     N/A:   GATM, HEM, MATM, SATM, TTM, VEM

Control sequences implemented in the VT100 are as follows:

     CPR, CUB, CUD, CUF, CUP, CUU, DA, DSR, ED, EL, HTS, HVP, IND,
     LNM, NEL, RI, RIS, RM, SGR, SM, TBC

plus several private DEC commands.

Erasing parts of the display (EL and ED) in the VT100 is performed thus:

     Erase from cursor to end of line           Esc [ 0 K    or Esc [ K
     Erase from beginning of line to cursor     Esc [ 1 K
     Erase line containing cursor               Esc [ 2 K
     Erase from cursor to end of screen         Esc [ 0 J    or Esc [ J
     Erase from beginning of screen to cursor   Esc [ 1 J
     Erase entire screen                        Esc [ 2 J

The VT100 responds to receiving the DA (Device Attributes) control

     Esc [ c    (or Esc [ 0 c)

by transmitting the sequence

     Esc [ ? l ; Ps c

where Ps is a character that describes installed options.

The VT100's cursor location can be read with the DSR (Device Status
Report) control

     Esc [ 6 n

The VT100 reports by transmitting the CPR sequence

     Esc [ Pl ; Pc R

where Pl is the line number and Pc is the column number (in decimal).

v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v

The complete document describing the standard,  "ANSI X3.64-1979:
Additional Controls for Use with the American National Standard
Code for Information Interchange," can be ordered for $13.50 (plus
$4 postage) from

     American National Standards Institute
     1430 Broadway
     New York, NY 10018
     212/354-3300

It's best to read the full standard before using it. It also helps
to have copies of the related standards "X3.4-1977: American
National Standard Code for Information Interchange" (the ASCII
standard) and "X3.41.1974: Code-Extension Techniques for Use with
the 7-Bit Coded Character Set of American National Standard for
Information Interchange."

See also the chapter "Using Extended Screens and Keyboard Control"
in the IBM PC-DOS manuals (versions 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0), especially
for the coding for character attributes.

What do you guys think?
We can send them UUencoded.

	There are two commmands in Amos 1.3x, Follow[list of expressions...]
and Follow Off. This supposedly allows you to trace certain variables through
the course of your program, skipping over folded procedures and such. It is
supposed to open a small window over top of you program so that you can
view your variables at each command step. I personally have not tried it but
I think it is worth a shot!

	For AmosPro use the built-in Monitor (if you need an help on this, 
let me know...) otherwise put a "Follow On" at the very beginning of your program and a "Follow Off" (or Stop, I don't remember) at the end of the loop to debug (Im not sure if during the "following" CTRL-C still works!). It works even
under AmosPro!

It is not there on 1.3, it is on 3.0+, and I don't know about 2.0. 
You can check the OS version by reading the version number of 
the exec.library - code to do this has been posted in the past, and 
there are extension commands for it (I can't remember it offhand).

The screenmode prefs is an IFF file like all 3.0 prefs. Get hold of 
one of the IFF file editors on aminet (which I can't remember the 
names of) and they will be able to show the file broken into 
meaningfull IFF chunks.

If I'm not wrong (I don't have the original post, the name of the guy who
posted this though)

Subject: Phantom Collisions
Status: RO
X-Status: 


You start something simple and all hell breaks loose.  I began to write a 
'colorforms' type program where kids could arrange a bunch of bobs on a 
background.  My first step was to flesh out a routine to detect bobs with the 
mouse and drag them if a mouse key was depressed.  I began getting collisions 
with transparent portions of my bobs--but only to the left of the body.  I 
decided to test this rigorously and used a cross pattern for the bob (+) 
~100x100 and small boxes for the sprite. A 1X1 sprite worked as advertised with 
collisions taking place only when actual overlap occured.  However a 2X2 sprite 
collided with the cross about 12 pixels too early when approached from the left-
-but correctly when approached from the right. You can sneak into the left 
quadrant of the cross by moving the mouse down into the quadrant a few pixels 
left of the upright arm without collision.  However when you then move the 
mouse left (away from the cross) it snags something invisible and a collision 
occurs.  Using larger sprite images changes the number of pixels between the 
images where collisions occur--until you use a sprite 32X32 whereupon the 
routine functions correctly again!!!  I haven't tried multicolored sprites yet 
or other screen modes--I'm assuming that I can work around this problem when I 
get to my actual images.

I'm curious whether this behavior can be reproduced.  You might keep this in 
mind if you keep getting killed in a shoot-em -up when nothing has actually hit 
you.  It seems someone took some shortcuts in the collision detection routines.

Trust in me when I say "Thanks Branco" for indicating me this mistake
(I guess that the correct word was fight, you know like Street Fighter,
or Street Figther? ;-)). This is only one of the millions mastikes ;-)
I make. In this case, this is a typo-error (I think this the correct
word, isn't it?)... (Message stopped for no wasting more bandwith).

But I believe the internal format changed slightly between 2.04 and 3.0; 
which format 2.1 has, I've no idea.
Might it not be easier to lock the Workbench screen & read the ModeID 
from it?

Wasn't there a procedure on the AMOS Classic Extras Disk for running
CLI Commands?  This could probably be used to run the next Compiled
program, or execute a batch file to do the job.  The running version
would then Quit, letting the next program take over...

I haven't tried this but give it a go, yeah?

You should not use the exec version to check for AGA graphics or
other graphic capabilities. There are various users, which have Kick
3.1 on their A500s, and others which still have Kick 2.0 on their
A2000/A3000 with graphic cards...

Please either use graphics/_LVOModeNotAvailable (V36+) or
graphics/_LVOFindDisplayInfo (V36+).

I would even prefer a asl/DisplayMode requester on start of the
program.

There's a "The Meaning of Laff"??? I heard of "The Meaning of Liff"
and I own "The Deeper Meaning of Liff", but I didn't find "figth"
there... :-(
