Have you tried using Degrader or something like that? I know that's not
a solution but as far as I remember, this bug only shows up on Kick 3.1
machines.

....actually, this is a known AMOS bug, and has to do with the WB3.1
operating system.  Amos generates non-OS-legal interlace codes for the new
screenmodes.  Solution ??  Go buy a 500...  Either that, or don't use
interlace.  This problem occurs in compiled code as well.  It is annoyign
though.

I know now, why I can't display Interlace - Screen. A guy from this Mailing List 
helped me. It's because a Bug of Amos (only with WB3+). :-(

The problem is that, that I want to use it for an AGA Only Game, and when I use 
Degrader or something like that, I can't show AGA Graphics.

Yeah, I know: Amos should be improved and corrected, but Lionet is not
working any more for it and Europress doesn't want to sell the code.

 > AMOS was to be sold as a 'games creator', like its predecessor STOS and
 > its postdecessor (right word??) Klick'n'Play.)

Yes, that's true, but you can also do different stuff. It's sold as Game
Creator for its good and easy graphic system and because of business
reasons.

It does it just to help you. Procedures are like sub programs and in this

way
you're sure your sub is ok before folding it: I like it!

 > Can I use Logo on my 4000 with CV64, by the way?

I don't know: please, check it for me and let me know: I'm going to
translate
it in English and I could add it to its manual.

You can still load the picture in a normal Amos screen and then grab and

to an intuition window. Screen aren't supported yet, but going to be.
BTW no Aga at least for now.

Make sure your line 4 has the full path, like this:

AMOSPro_3d.lib -f<the dir it's in>

Edit the line if necessary.

I can be wrong, but there is two versions of Amos 3D, one for the Amos, the
Creator and the another one for the Amos Pro. The first one is unusable with
the Amos Pro, and this could be the reason of your problem. FYI, the second
one is included with the Amos Pro Compiler.

I agree completely.  It's a great shame that amos can't handle the new chips
properly.  Blitz can, but it has a really, really bad editor, and breaks
even easily.  Sorry to dredge up the old blitz/amos thing again though. 
Amos is better/nicer in a great many ways, but blitz is faster, can do aga
and can do proper OS stuff.  (Yes, you can do OS stuff with the gui
extension, I use it too.)  I'm using both amos and blitz, depending on what
I'm doing.  Its a shame they can't combine the best features of both.

Howdy! I'm a 3D animator myself, who dabbles in some BASIC programming
on the side, (AmosPro and Blitz Basic 2.1) mostly trying to build an
immense spaceship simulation and character roleplayer. Typical, I
suppose, but lots of fun! I'm very happy to see that someone's made
something serious out of AMOS; (I'm not into cash registers myself,
unfortunately) nice work. Your web pages were quite enlightening and
nicely put together. Incidently... worf.albanyis.com? Is there a service
provider in Albany?

Hiyall

I have 2 questions:

1) Does anyone know how many ppl are on this list?

2) Someone suggested netser (off Aminet) for my needs, but I have just 
not spent much time, and thought I check again. I am up to the point in 
my program of needing serial device communication. This will require the 
sending and recieving of data to and from one other machine over the net 
(IRC/'talk'/other?). Similar to chess clients on ones local machine, my 
program will use any term program to dial up a server, then one may quit 
their term prog (staying online) and start my program. My program will 
then have a small text window, some graphics, etc... I would like to just 
be able to accept a line of text, and send one...like a msg in IRC or 
something.

thanx.

Hy there all U A(-okey)mos folks,

As of today I'm back on-line (from a holiday break) and continuing 
the Amos projects. Hope all of U had a good time to !

About the Amos (Raw) sampling method 

> By Keith Hill

In one of my current projects VMA (the Visual Music Application) I used the
adres for audio polling, I'm using this without initialising the sampler for
in- or output. Input could be the default setting though.

I thought that there was an 128 byte buffer starting from ($BFE100) with
sampler data, are U sure that the input buffer is only 1 byte large ?
Polling using this 1 byte input value works fine on clean audio signals,
Amos however is not as fast as it should be so the polling does not (yet !)
match the sampling rates of a conventional noise-gate.

Has anyone got some more info on the use of the parallel port for audio sampling
using Amos, if so lemeseesoon pleeease.

I bought Blitz2, and I often try to use it, but the many crashes bring me back 
to Amos!

At the risk of being a metoo, I have to agree with Mr. Braneloc. I know
and love AMOSPro, but Blitz gives me up to the minute machine and OS
support that's part of the main programme. Despite the icky interface,
it IS nice being able to work on a 1200's Productivity Screen with
Workbench behind it. I'm using both as well, AMOSPro to establish code
and "throw it around" quickly and easily, and Blitz to put together the
final version. The other thing Blitz might have, is possible portability
to the PC in the future. So I for one fully intend to challenge the PC
with Amiga software for a change!

I would like to know if there's a way to know if AmosPro is still playing a

Thank you very much.

You need to use either AmIRC or GrapeVine (both on AmiNET) with a tcp con=
nection of some kind.  IRC is internet relay chat.  It lets a bunch of us=
ers talk together on the net.

Now, it's switched.  It is server-> irc.stealth.net and channel -> #AmosL=
ist  The time is 8pm -9pm.

I'm not sure what the time would be in GMT

                          About Extreme AMOS
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Extreme AMOS is a disk-based magazine, written by me, Andrew "Mushroom"
Kellett. Each issue comes spread out on 2 disks, with issues sometimes being
released on 3 disks, when lot's of articles or programs have been submitted.
Each issue costs 2 pounds, no matter how many disks it is packed onto, and
is released bi-monthly. There is also a HD version available from issue 3
upwards, so anyone with a HD can use it safetly. People with Internet
access can get it free of charge from there local provider, or from my
webpage as soon as it is set up.

    At the moment, the fourth edition is currently being constructed, with
the previous 3 all being released as shareware. Issues 1 and 2 were released
when I was working with a co-editor named Carl Drinkwater, who was later
sacked from the EA team for lack of correspondence towards the magazine, both
in contributions, and suggestions. Issue 3 was released in April 1996, and
showed more response than the previous 2 issues put together. It was
completely written, designed and programmed by myself, with compaction help
from Paul Burkey, and contains a full GUI interface system, with graphics
amongst the articles, as well as full-colour texts, unlike the first 2
issues. Within a day of it getting released onto the internet, I was getting
E-Mails from different countries, including Belgium and Hungary. Issue 4
already contains a new reader system, which allows the articles access to
over 13 different IFF fonts, so articles and adverts can have interesting
and attractive headers, instead of using the same boring old text style.
Issue 4 should be ready to buy around the end of September 1996, priced at 2
pounds. Issue 4 will not be released as shareware at the time of
writing this document.

    Extreme AMOS Issue 3 is the biggest release of EA to date. Altogether,
it contained over 300K of text files to read (all sizes when unpacked), and
more than 200K of squidged pictures to look at. It was also the first issue
to combine graphics and text together, to provide game reviews with IFF
screenshots for example. Previous issues never had coloured text, which
could be controlled via control codes, unlike issue 3.

    The issues are packed full of AMOS and non-AMOS programming routines
and source code for you to use and read straight away. There is even a
Hard Disk version of disk 1, so you can unpack all the articles without
having to wait for them to load slowly via floppy, and then wait for them
to unpack again. Extreme AMOS now also has a fantasy football league, run
by a chap named Mark Prestwich. In all 3 previous issues, the FF system has
been messed around with, and so I have found someone to hopefully do the
job properly.

  Getting involved with EA
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Extreme AMOS is always looking for people to contribute articles and
source code. If your Articles/Source is used, then the issue that it
appears in is sent to you free of charge. Articles may not appear in the
next issue they are sent for, but maybe an issue afterwards. Articles can
be typed out directly, with the text colours inserted in brackets where you
want them to go, or if you are familiar with the character control codes I
use, then you can place them in. Alternatively, I can colour any text for
you. Issue 3 contains several converter programs, as well as a text reader
program to view your own articles in.

    Any source code sent in to the magazine, will automatically be placed
into the library as shareware. Any source code used on the coverdisks will
also be treated as Shareware. Your name will also be mentioned in the
credits of the magazine.

    I am also looking for Games and utilities to place on the coverdisks.
Demo versions of games are also welcome, including demos of any powerfull
AMOS utilities. Send them to me at the address below, where they will all
be evaluated equally. Remember to include all documentation, libraries,
and other bits needed by the program, as I won't use it if even I can't
get it to work!

    Each of the shareware issues is available from Mushroom PD, priced at
1.20, or 1.95 if you live overseas. If you are going to supply your own
disks, make sure that they are formatted and checked for errors, otherwise
the program won't copy onto them properly. Each issue will cost 80p if you
supply disks, or 1.55 if you live overseas. The reason I charge extras for
overseas packages, is it costs over a pound more to send them, as the postage
rates are ridiculous nowadays. All cheques should be made payable to Andrew
Kellett, and mailed to me at this address :

Hi all!

If you are interested, Mellow Chips' latest demo can be found from
ftp.funet.fi/pub/amiga/demos/Assembly96/MC-Din*.lha. The name should be
DIM but someone uploaded it with wrong name! 8-( 

It's coded using Amos Professional v2.0 and assembler. It requires AGA
chipset, 68020+ cpu, 3.5mb of harddisk space, and at least 4mb RAM.
Recommended: 68030/50mhz

"Dim" was 2nd in the Assembly96 demo competition.

I would appreciate if you'd send comments about the demo to:
phakkine@cc.hut.fi

Subject: Dividing hex numbers by 2
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hello all!

I'm trying to divide hex numbers by two. For example:

$ABC / 2 = $556.

But AMOS seems unable to do this. It can only divide even numbers correctly.
For example:

$62A / 2 = $315.

But if the number was, for example, $7B3, it gives a silly answer.

Has anyone got a quick and easy solution to this, without having to read
each character and divide it manually?

Thanks!

Greetings to all amos extension wizards!
 
Is it possible to link my very own error routine to amos error system?
The reason why I want to do this is that I have opened my own copperlist
and everytime I got an amos error (Illegal Function call for example)
the amos error appears on amos screen and not in my (AGA) screen.
(I open the screen using my McExtension)

So I want to link a small routine to amos error system, so that whenever
an amos error occurs I could close my aga screen and restore amos screen
back to normal.

So if there's a pointer to amos error routine somewhere in the datazone, 
I would like to know about it. 

Any ideas, some1?

Hello,

I've been asked to forward this message to people who might be interested=

I can't at present accept 100+ megs through Internet Email to get those
files, but maybe somebody else can, or knows someone who can?

Hopefully, I have the right person. <G>

Perhaps you remember me as co-sysop of Dune Master BBS in Michigan City, =
IN.
We bought out Computer People who had the North American AMOS support sit=
e
years ago. =


We've just gone down due to the Internet frenzy. We went from 70+ callers=
 a
day to about ten. Anyway, we didn't just want to delete all the AMOS/Amig=
a
files. I don't know if anyone would have use for the old AMOS programs. I=

was hoping you'd be able to let me know. All of the Amiga files we had ha=
ve
been placed on two ZIP disks for a few weeks. There are games, programs,
add-ons, etc. From the age, many are from older versions of AMOS.

If you are interested or know someone who might want them, let me know. I=
've
got an account and can send them out. However, I'd appreciate it if it we=
re
only to a person or two or perhaps even a site. Let me know ASAP. I don't=

mind if you give out my e-mail address to anyone else.

You can reach me at

        or
        rajsic@aol.com
        or
        http://members.aol.com/rajsic/vmedia.html

Thanks, Seumas. Like I said, I didn't just want to delete them. If they'r=
e
just worthless (which is more than possible), let me know and I'll just
delete them.

I just cant reproduce your problem - maybe Ive got completely the 
wrong end of that so-called stick!

If you just stick the line:
Print $7B3 / 2
you get the right answer?!?!?!?!?!?!

Aya!
This is the second time I have typed this.  The first one got lost in 
the vast electronic wastelands!!

I have finished programming the second of the Loony Juice Software 
Atomic series of games.
The program works fine from the editor but when compiled strange 
thing happen:

I am pasting bobs onto a screen!  Paste Bob doesnt take any notice of 
hot spots does it so I am using an offset value like this:

Paste Bob x-xo,y-yo,img

img is the image, x and y are the actual coordinates and xo and yo 
are the offset values.

As I say on compiling this doesnt work.  What could be the problem?
Any ideas?

Keep a lookout on aminet.  Soon my digitizer designs allong with Amos 
decoding software should be appearing!

Bye!

No, this isn't what I want. I admit, I didn't think it through when I said
it gave silly answers - the answers are, of course, completely correct,
but not the answers I want! :) See below for what I want.

My AMOS works fine for dividing hex numbers, as you describe, but I only
want to divide each digit of the hex number. This is for the screen colours
and I want to calculate the half-brite colour. Colour(>31) doesn't work.

Anyway, for this purpose I use extension commands which are able to read
colours 32-63 correctly (ie half the colour of their equivilant).

The only situation I can think of is that there isn't an open screen when
you try doing something. Just try adding a Screen Open command right at
the beginning of your program.

Hi (if somebody is listen):

I don't know if the list is running or not, but I send this message for

By the way, anyone knows something about the Mike Sikosrky's project (I think)
to port the AMOS functions to C?

you mean $55e...?

..ok...

$7b3	= 1971
1971/2	= 985.5  (985 as integer)
985	= $3D9

Amos says: $7b3 / 2 = $3d9

...are you SURE about this ??

Please give lots of examples where it goes wrong, and I'll try and help. 
Either that, or your copy may need re-installing or something horrible like
that. 

There is a limit on the amount of hex numbers amos can keep track of though,
I think it blows up after a couple of million, errm, 2^20 or something like
that.

Hey everybody.. I delved into the AmosPro_default.font and made a wee 
program to edit it.. and I've made a font identical to the WB2.0 Topaz 
font.. and here it is.  Just replace you're old AMOSPro_Default.font in 
the APSystem/ Drawer with this file.  (That is if you don't like the old 
Topaz font..=)  )

P.S. If you want the editing program I wrote, just send an email to the

Hello AMOS people,


I need help and fast.
I have a monitor that only has the resolution VGA - Multiscan.
But when I startup AMOS I can't read anything.
because AMOS startup with PAL. :(

How can I startup AMOS so I can do my programming again??

Anybody out there interested in contributing to an AMOS Disk magazine?
Issue 4 of Extreme AMOS is currently being put together, and any AMOS
articles sent would be appreciated.

To get the latest version of Extreme AMOS, link up to my AMOS homepage
(given below) and download the archive. It will unpack to the HD and
run without any assigns or copying etc.

I also want AMOS webpage links to go on my homepages, so if you know
of, or run a good AMOS website then please get in touch with me with
details so I can place it on my links page. Thanks,

Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett

P.S. Does anyone know how to use the Trackerlib from AMOSPro in order
     to replay modules correctly?

You have to use masks:

R=(OldC And $F00)/$100
G=(OldC And $F0)/$10
B=(OldC And $F)
NewC=(R/2)*$100 + (G/2) *$10 + (B/2)

As far as I know you cannot run amos in doublepal/multiscan ( >15khz
modes). The only solution I can think of to use some texteditor to
write your code and compile it with apcmp (if you have the Amos
Professional Compiler). But then again if you open
amos' screens the screen would get corrupted. Of course it might be
possible to hack the amos copperlist so that it could theoretically work
in doublepal but it would be difficult as the planes and stuff are not
aligned to 64bit.

Hi Chris, 

I own two A1200's, one with an MTEC 63030 and the both work fine with the OM.
I cannot combine the 3D objects with AGA screens just because AMOS does not
support this goody. The second constraint in using 3D objects in AMOS is the
active 3D screen cannot be larger then 320 pixels width. 

To reply to Frank Smit problem, I own an Microvitect multiscan monitor and
AMOS (Pro to be exact) starts in all modes with it's own standard hires screen.

Hope this answers your question..

I'm here, listening to all that goes on, but a bit busy ATM.  Everytime
I feel the need to say something, I read the answer in the next message...

BTW I'm an AMOS coder from way back, just never released much onto Aminet.

If anyone is curious, look for Elevators.lha, LaserRace.lha or
PoswizDemo.lha for some examples.  All of these are old, but it gives
you an idea where I'm at.

Regards to all.

Neil.

I've read in an AMOS book of mine that on Compiling, some global 
variables do not work.. it recommends to use Shared at the start of each 
Procedure.. (I know this seems a stupid idea, but this global thing has 
happened to me before, and it was fixed when I used shared...)

AMOS only works with 15kHz screens.

Which Amiga model do you have?
If you have a big box Amiga you could get a flickerfixer/scandoubler card=

to make all 15kHz screens 30kHz.

Or you could use two monitors. Buy a used 1081/1084. Should be cheap thes=
e days.
I don't know if there is some kind of cable that gives you two monitor po=
rts. If not, you
will have to switch manually between the monitors. Might not be a good id=
ea though.

Your last option is to buy a multisync. Look for a used 1950/1960 for aro=
und $200.

It's a hardware problem. No software can help you. Sorry.


This 15kHz thing is something that really annoys me. I have a multisync (=
1960). But I also have a
graphics card and the 1960 is not good enough for a graphics card. You ca=
n't get a 70Hz
screen, nor can you get the really big screenmodes (anything above 800x60=
0 is a problem).

A cheap SVGA monitor would give me all this, but then AMOS wouldn't work =
any more.

So if I want to continue to use AMOS I have to buy either an expensive mu=
ltisync or a =

combination of a scandoubler and an SVGA monitor.

If I weren't in the middle of a very big game project (big for me that is=
), I would delete
AMOS and get a cheap SVGA monitor and forget all about it.

BTW, the game I'm working on is a space strategy game very much like Micr=
oprose
game, Master of Orion. You can have a look at it on my webpage (address b=
elow).
But be warned there's not much there yet. I'm working on it though.

You can't.
Period. Sorry.
You might want to write your amos programs in ascii and
put em through the compiler ?! :-(
The editor itself uses an amos-screen which can't be promoted!

I have feeble hope to be proven wrong.

There's command called On Error Proc YOUR_PROCEDURE

Howdy people!

I have this tracker module!
It is in several parts.  Each part is different.
In the Amos bible it says:-

Track Play bank,pattern

Where bank is where the module is and pattern is from which pattern 
in the module you wish to start playing the module.
Why does this not work?
Is the command wrong or is it just me?

Hmm.

I've written GIF converters in very small spaces.  I've even coded the 
LZW Treestep algorithm in Asm for very fast decoding, all in AMOS.  I 
know of a place where you can get GIF code in QBasic, which is easily 
converted into AMOS BAsic...

However, there are two problems:

1.  Most GIFs have 256 colors, so you'll have to develop a palette 
matching routine to get all those colors on the screen.  This I have done 
so many times its second nature, and I can show you how to do it.

2.  Unisys, owners of the LZW compression scheme, charge an arm and a leg 
for licensing ($100 US up front!) even for shareware programs.  I have 
not done this, as I need money for college.

GIF decoders are fairly easy to code if you have an example.  They're 
also very easy to understand once you code it.  But they're very 
expensive to use.  (and slow!)

As far as I'm aware, they dropped that requirement on GIF's when the iNet
community yelled blue murder at them.

Sorry, that wasn't exactly what I was looking for. 
I'm planning to it inside an extension, that is in assembler.
Do you know a way to hook an asm routine to amos error routines, so that
everytime an amos error appears I could run a piece of my own 680x0 code?

McExtension = Mellow Chips' Extension, some aga routines at the moments,
but I'm planning to add texturemapping support someday.

Meaning they've been thrown out of the window dozens of times, with a heavy
truck with muddy tires squeezing them in the mud thereafter :-D?

But that was not what I wanted to ask. While reading a few messages about
AMOS not supporting AGA in the editor, and AMOS 3D requiring an 68000 plus
KS 1.3, why not build a new AMOS ourselves? There are a few pretty good
programmers on this list who are capable of the job... I was thinking of
a completely modular programming language. In its basic form it knows
nothing about print and screens and such -- it only knows about the syntaxis
and variable types. So things like if/then/else, for/next, while/wend,
repeat/until, proc/end proc, gosub/return, integers, floats, strings...
Rather like C in that respect. Now then. If you want to do something, you
choose one of the many 'extensions' available, and tag them to your program.
There would be an advanced string extension, a graphics extension, an
animation extension, etc. I am using extensions because that is one of the
few things I like about AMOS. In fact, you can think of the variables and
syntaxis as a 'kernel' extension which can be replaced and upgraded with
the same ease as the rest.
    It would be a language which needs compiling. However, this is done
automatically before you run the program, so you do not require a separate
compiler anymore. If you ever used Pascal for DOS, you know what I mean. 
I have played around a bit with how the parser for programming languages
works, and believe me, it will save a *lot* of time if you compile your
programs. 
    The thing would be written in C with perhaps a bit of assembly here
and there. Writing the entire thing in assembly is crazy: it's a sure way
of asking bugs to come and hide in your program -- especially with a
program the size of AMOS. 

Has anyone had similar ideas?

Maarten

That`s not entirely true.  Earlier versions of the editor were
very picky about the Amiga they ran on, but the later versions
(including the one that appeared on the coverdisk) are not.
I certainly managed to get the coverdisk version running just
fine on my A4000/030/KS3.0, before it became an A4000/060.  Now,
of course, I can`t get the editor to run, though I haven`t yet
tried all the possible degrading options available.

Anyway, unless the A1200 in question has been expanded significantly,
or you`ve got one of the older editor versions, there should be
no problems getting it to work.

I've never got this command to work properly. I can play a module, but not 
choose
which track to start from.

O.k. I've written to about 10 ppl about this...and I myself asked this 
question before...In my experience...

Does Amos 3D work with A1200?

Well it goes like this...(and I dont use it much)...you can install 3D
in Amos Pro even! I have not gotten the editor to work without Relokick
(IMHO the BEST degrader and only one to use when running old 
garbage..err I mean wares).

So there it is. my $.02 on 3D. Because the Editor does not run normally 
on my machine I dont use it much, but since everyone keeps reminding me I 
have the extension installed I should write something with it! :)

Off the top of my head, the new editor had some changes in the
object positioning commands, which made it a LOT easier to 
get the objects oriented correctly wrt one another.  With the
older editor I usually ended up with one or more blocks of an
object slightly skewed relative to their neighbours, but the
newer editor helps to avoid that.  I think there were a few
other minor changes, but the main change were the behind the
scenes fixes to get it working on more machines.

To be honest though, even the newer editor still isn`t what I`d
call usable, it just doesn`t feel right trying to edit a 3D
object by looking at a 3D view of it.  Give me a nice tri-view
interface a-la Imagine and I`d be happy.

Ops, sorry, I didn't realize it.
I don't know a way to put that routine in your own extension, but you could
think to add a asm procedure to your Amos prog and then use the On Error
Proc
command.

You can insert asm code in procedure using menu from AmosPro.

That's all I can tell you

So, what's in that 1200? I'm using a 1200 as well (3.0 kick 3.1 wb, although
the wb part doesn't make any difference since it refused to work with 3.0
as well) and a Blizzard 1230, 8 meg fast. OM refuses to run. I get to the
title-screen but that's it. Occassionally, I do get it to run properly
for around 5-10 minutes but sonner or later everything goes hay-wire.

Well it seems I will only continue the quest, hopefully your wish will 
come true. I didn't have any problems installing it, but the editor does 
not boot up off the disk right. I have to use Relokick then boot off the 
disk to get it to work...*sigh*

Is there another way to 'install' it so that you can just 'click-andrun'?

I've got a utility called anim2bob on my web page in the amos section. It
converts anims (mode 5 dpaint) into bob banks.

Hi,

Does anyone know the best way to do hardware scrolling...?

Now I'll explain my situation - because I guess its pretty important!

(I'm using autoback 0 and bob update off)

I've got a lowres 640x480 screen which I scroll in a 320x190 display, 
about 15 bobs including a ball, which the scrolling follows. All of 
this (including scrolling) was controlled by AMal proggies.
To begin with I was running the game at 25Hz using the following 
method:

do
   [program code taking between 0.5 and 1.5 vbls]
   Synchro:wait vbl:bob update
   rem next line makes sure that we only wait a vbl if we need to
   If less-than-2-vbls since last last loop then wait vbl
   rem I've tried removing the line above and it doesnt make the 
          display any smoother
loop

This however, is very jerky.  So I then decided to make the ball move 
at 50Hz by taking it out of the Amal bank and putting the new Amos 
code just BEFORE each Vbl.

This was even worse!  However, when I ran the program by freezing the 
scrolling amal program, all was ok.  I think the problem is that 
while EVERYTHING visible is updated in one smooth burst during the 
Bob Update command, the scrolling is done during the Synchro command. 
So, in effect, there are 2 changes to-the-eye every Vbl.

Please Help!

I hope this all made some sense!

Cheers,
        Mark

Legally this isn't possible :(  You can hack the Amos Error Routine code, and
insert a Jsr to your routine...

O.k.

I DO have 3D installed in my AmosPro. It is listed in my extensions 
loaded list.

BUT when I load an example in 3D...and it gets to a Td <command> it says
'Can't Load 3d code'

Before I run the program I check it and there are no error. I have tried 
changing the dir it loads from, changing the current dir, and sacrificing 
green chickens to the Godz...nothing works...plz help me...arghhh..

   Hi everyone!

   I'm presently doing a *new* game in AmosPro.  But because I'm normally
very occupied (Yes, I'm only a 14 year old Canadian and I'm in 10th grade),
It will be long before I will finish it.  So stay tune for more information
about this game and it will be available when I'll tell you.

   Thanx for reading my message.

My suggestion (which you probably will not like..) is to forget using 
Amal and control the balls etc. using Bob draw, bob clear etc.. this 
should make things a lot smoother..

Hi!

I've got a view questions about Animations & Amos (Pro)?

1.) Do anybody know of a piece of Software to convert "IFF-Animations" to the
    "CDXL" Fromat?

2.) Is it possible to play big (IFF-)animations direct from HD using Amos?

3.) Is it possible to play AGA-IFF-Animations from Amos?

Okay, so much for this time.

What is wrong with Amal though?  If I use the Synchro Off (which I do) 
then I can show all the bob updates in one burst using the Bob Update 
command.  Surely, this cant be any smoother?

Has anyone maanaged to get a doublbuffered scrolling screen using 
Amal based game working smoothly.  This must be a very common 
approach - it must be possible!

Cheers,
        Mark

Probably the only way to get smooth scrolling and smooth ball movement is
to use a sprite for the ball (so you can update it separately from the
bobs) and maybe use Amal or an Every 1 Proc to control it.

If you've installed it the way that the AMOSPro help guide says, then I
don't know what's wrong!!!!

Besides, DO YOU REALLY WANT IT WORKING?!?! It's not all that good! :-)

In my big program I use the array USER(1) where each of the two 
elements is either true of false.

The only time I change their values is at the start of the program:

e.g User(0)=false:User(1)=True

But I was finding that when I compiled the game, User(1) was in fact 
"-214...."(you know that 32 bit number).  On closer inspection I 
compiled the game by changing the start so that it was:

USER(0)=False: USER(1)=True
Print True, USER(1)

The result was "-1  -214..." when compiled
and "-1   -1" when run under Amos

Whats going on???

Can I not trust "True"?

Cheers,
        Mark

Unfortunately, the ball needs to go behind bobs now and again.

Anyway, I've come up with an ok solution. It goes something like:

Synchro Off: Bob Update Off:Autoback 1
[Amos Code]
Wait Vbl:Synchro (this includes a scrolling channel)
bob clear
bob draw
wait vbl:screen swap

So this goes along at 25Hz, but now I dont get the jittery ball 
movement (you know like where the ball "appears" to jump back on 
itself)

Before, it was something like:

Synchro
wait vbl:Bob update
wait vbl

but I think the "Bob Update" command was not always completed  before 
the screen started to redraw again...

Hope this all makes sense!

Cheers,
        Mark

Isn't the number -214... still true though?  Anything except 0 = true 
doesn't it?

Right, I have decided to totaly re-write one of my games.  I wrote 
the original ages ago but it was sort of cack.
So I am re-writing it.  So far it works the same, looks miles better 
and is unfinished.

Yesterday I decided to put in a nice time bar.  A bar which reduces 
in size as your time runs out, simple.

Here is the bit of code I WAS using:

Bob off 10                                   bob 10 is the timer bar!
Screen 1                                    where the graphics are.
Get bob 6,0,0 to TI,10             TI is time remaining         
screen 0                                     play area screen.
Bob 10,30,230,6                        put img. 6 on screen.

This works for varying lengths of time before the computer crashes.  
I mean realy crashes! 
The program works perfect without it and crashes with it.
I presume it has something to do with the get bob command.

Hey how is it I seem to be finding loads of major bugs with Amos 
recently.  I think I am pushing Amos to the limits in some of my 
latest efforts.  Looks like I'll have to look for another language!

Hmmm.

Yes. It seems as Get Bob is breeding bugs.

What could be better (and much faster) is to draw each stage of the time
bar BEFORE the game starts. But this depends on the size of the time bar
really. If it is big, maybe you could put it down in steps of 4 pixels
or something?

Yes, I'm finding that as well. :-(

Now don't go over the top. ;-)

If the Joypad behaves like a normal CD32 Pad, there should not be a
problem. Otherwise you need to use a special sega-joypad code :-(

Why does it take so much mail to respond a yes/no answer to the 3D

put holes in them without losing processor speed.
