Nope.  The examples they give (Disk Mnager, etc.) are all very nice, but 
the interface code for them is too complex to figure out - I just wrote a 
bunch of procedures to do similar things.  (I would distribute them, but 
they are, shall we say, quirky.  One day I'll get round to tidying them 
all up...)

I haven't got any of the updates - I never got round to it.  Has the 
"Ctrl-C in direct mode crashes AmOSPro" bug been fixed yet?  It really 
gets on my nerves!

I'll get right on to tidying up my interfacing procedures...

Has anyone out there have the TrojanLight Gun Driver for AMOS ?

I've got it, but I am having troubles trying to get it to work with a 
Sega LightGun ... What is the difference between the Trojan LightGun and 
the original Sega Gun ? Is there another driver out there that will make the
SEGA gun work with AMOS or AMOSPro ?

>Has anyone created a decent interface with this yet?

I have managed to write a file selector using the interface and
it seems fairly stable. It is very much like the Pro requester
but it doesn't open on it's own screen with those unsightly
black borders. It's only about 11k archived and has extensive
comments so is relatively easy to follow. I'd upload it if I
knew how, and where to (I'm new at this comms lark).

I grew annoyed with the interface language though as I needed to
have a horizontal scrolling window and all the horizontal slider
did was to scroll it vertically. It took a good many hours
before I realised it couldn't be done (although I would love to
be proven wrong). I am now learning C as I wish to make my
programmes more 'system friendly', although I still go back and
tinker in Amos.

Mac.

I started one a while back, but other projects got in my way - I'll see 
if I can dig it up.  I didn't get very far, but 99% of the display 
routines are there.  They're a bit ugly, but they were designed for speed 
not as an example of good coding.  (A feeble excuse, but the only one I 
could come up with at such short notice!:)

And on another subject entirely, I have a few suggestions for if (when) 
the AMOS Pro source becomes PD and someone takes it under their wing...

Get rid of the ridiculous AMOS music format.  The only stuff in that 
format that I've seen has been the things that were on the AMOS disks.  
The ST/NT to AMOS converter bites BAD, and ST support is included in AMOS 
anyway.  (Perhaps this could be changed to PT support?)

Add a Case statement.

Add the following functions to the Mod Player :

   Which Block - return the # of the pattern currently being played
   Which Songlist Entry - return the position in the song "  "
   Which Instrument(channel) - return the # of the instrument playing thru'
                               the channel
   Tempo - make this a function so you can find out the current tempo

Add all the Turbo commands. :)

Improve the serial/parallel commands - AP was an improvement over the 
original, but it still needs work.


Well, that ought to keep someone busy for a while. :)


(Oh, and the Turbo SineScroll demo needs some peculiar math library that 
I can't find anywhere...)

Yep, the magazine Amiga Shopper has a big "what is Internet" feature
this month. They featured this mailing list last month, and have now
moved on to pointing out where you can get yer luvely Amos proggies.

One of their pictures is a listing of /dev/amos, and I'm happy to say it
included one of MY progs!!! ( swarm.lha, for those who don't know ) Fame
at last!!

But seriously folks, looking at what they have written, they are in need
of some more information, and as they now have an email address... 8-)

So, I will volunteer to mail them and get them better informed about the
Amos scene (on the Internet)  So, if you want to tell them about
anything, mail me and I'll include it.

ADT members (if their are any left) perhaps this would be a good time to
start up some real work!  If you don't mind, I will give them details of
ADT.

So let's tell the world what we're doing! 8-)  ( Intuition extension,
EME, etc.. )

[ if you don't want to go via myself, their email is:
amshopper@cix.compulink.co.uk   
the amos column is called 'Amos Action' and is penned by Simon Green, so
address amos-related stuff to him. ]

Yeah I have done a heap of work with interface, hundreds of K worth of 
source code that uses interface all the time.

Sorry but the source code is (c) to the people I write for but If ya have 
any questions then ask away. I might not be able to answer all but I have
a pretty good idea of whats going on!

Check out 'ACE' basic compiler (on Aminet). It's as easy as AMOS, but has
less bugs and is intuition-friendly. And costs nothing.

Subject: OK, who's got a fast computer & wants to help me?
Status: RO


Hello all you Amos peeps!

In a new game that I am writing, I have decided to raytrace a lot of the
bobs & backgrounds.  This is because I am not artistically gifted, but I
am good at design, so I like using tracers/CAD progs.  My point?  Well,
I have my free copy of Imagine 2 (from Amiga Format), but I only have an
A500 (with 4 Megs) so as you can imagine (ha ha), speed is a problem.

So does anyone have an A4000, suped up A1200, or anything like that
(preferably UK, I lose my account at the end of July) who would be happy
to do some raytracing for me?  If you want, you can help with designing
the models, game, help as much as you like!

The game is a multi-player driving sim, where you have a fixed ammount
of cash, buy yourself a car and equip it... (heard it before??)  I
suppose it's similar to Xtank, but with better world-modelling, as I
want to get it as 'realistic' as possible, without sacrificing speed.
To this end, I have a selection of attributes that describe each
vehicle, these are modified when you buy extra armour, weapons, etc..
and affect the performance. These are the basic vehicle types: Bike,
Trike, Car/buggy, Tank, Hover/Gravity drive. Levels will be races,
battles, protect an object, find an object, etc... I want a good depth
to the game.

The game's working title is:  The Bertram Hussey School of Motoring.
( thought up in 1 minute last night by my brother and myself )

Thanks for listening!

Just get EME.  I'm serious - this product kills the AMOS commands... PT 
support and the ability to play samples at the same time without a crash!
Lots of other good stuff as well.

Sounds good - where do I get it from?  Aminet?  (If it's there, don't 
bother telling me, as I'll have a look in a minute.)

Can't remember what it is, but it's not any of the ieee or mathtrans 
libraries.

> PLAYFIELD!

Here's some more suggestions.  :)

Outline font support.  (Just kidding!)
Support for binary trees, linked lists, hash tables, etc.
Redefine the default screen palette.  :)
Add an option to force variables to be declared before use.  (I'm trying 
to write a program that checks your source for undefined variables, but 
it's a pain! :)
ANSI control code support.
Amiga-M/N screen switching.
Draggable screens.
Speed it up!  I'm thinking of defecting to the BLITZ camp... :)

I could go on, but I think I've probably said enough... :)

My NTSC<>PAL Accessory is now available on Aminet in the dev/amos folder. 
This accessory will allow you to switch your AMOS Professional EDITOR between
NTSC (60Hz) and PAL (50Hz) modes. I recommend installing this accessory 
in your USER pull-down menu so it is readily available to call at will.

Enjoy !

If that's the Simon Green responsible for Extreme Violence, he's on this list

  Kimmo just posted a message to the list about ACE. ACE is
essentially a souped-up version of Amiga Basic. It doesn't have any
of the extras (like AMAL) that Amos has. However, it's extremely
stable, the author has an Internet address, and he usually fixes any
bugs as soon as they're reported. The only real problem with it is
that the compiler's kind of a memory hog, and you may have trouble
compiling/assembling any source code larger than 150K.
  When I released my own compiler (not a Basic compiler) a few
months back, I compared it to what other languages I had around. I
thought you might be interested in seeing the results of those
tests. Amos didn't do so good... :)
  The reason for the huge time difference between Struct/C and
ACE/Amos is that neither of the two Basics use register variables.
Assembly language programmers know how important this is.
  I used the Creator version of Amos.



  SAS C 6.2 is a commercial C compiler, published by SAS Institute.
The included assembler and linker were used. The optimization flag
was not used because the optimizer kept throwing the test code away.
(But, looking at the assembly code, I doubt it would have made much
difference)
  Struct is a copyrighted but freely redistributable compiler,
written by Roland Acton. The PhxAss optimizing assembler and PhxLnk
linker, included with Struct, were used.
  AMOS is a commercial BASIC interpreter, written by Francois Lionet
and published by Europress software. The AMOS compiler was used, and
the numbers given are for the compiled versions of the speed tests.
  ACE is a freeware BASIC compiler, written by David Benn. The A68k
assembler and Blink linker, included with ACE, were used.
  The tests were performed on an Amiga 500 with 1 MB chip and 2 MB
fast, running Kickstart 1.3.

Results (numbers represent seconds):

              C     Struct      AMOS      ACE
--------------------------------------------------
Test 1      114        107       662      504
Test 2      230        109      1694     1200
Test 3      441        107      2313      866
Test 4      119        119      1115      660
Test 5      114        114       887      571
Test 6      116         95       660      504
Test 7      130        107       709      538
Test 8      121         76       622      442

  The tests themselves were quite trivial and focused on loop
structures, comparisons, and simple mathematics. They are not
sufficiently general to be called true benchmarks. The tested
operations, however, are important parts of all useful programs.
  TEST 1 was a For/Next loop.
  TEST 2 used the Zeroloop construct, unique to Struct. For/Next
loops with negative steps were used in the other languages.
  TEST 3 was to acquire the remainder from a division and use it in
an If/Then. This was surrounded by a For/Next loop.
  TEST 4 was a Repeat/Until loop. Do/While was substituted in C.
  TEST 5 was a While/Wend loop.
  TEST 6 was a Loop/End Loop construct. For/Next was substituted in
the other languages.
  TEST 7 was a test of literal concatenation. An If/Then, with the
condition containing numeric literals added to a variable, was
surrounded with a For/Next loop.
  TEST 8 was to access memory. A Byte Peek with a computed memory
address was surrounded by For/Next loops. The memory reference
operator with char casting was used in C. Peek was used in AMOS and
ACE.

Nope, its a commercial product... You can get it through PD Plus in 
Australia or through PLAYFIELD! in the rest of the world.  Its only $14.95.

OK, then, get started implementing those suggestions and we'll catch up

Does anyone know of a utility that enables the compression of ST/NT/PT
patterns?  By compression I mean taking 1 to 4 tracks and resampling to
create a single track.

If there isn't I MAY be tempted to write one in Amos.  No promises
though...

I hope it got renamed - it confused the hell out of my UNIX box - it kept 
trying to redirect everything...  Avoid using characters that are 
considered "special" on any machine.  AmigaDOS doesn't mind, as it 
requires a space between filenames and redirections, but UNIX and DOS 
don't.  (And don't use | either!)

Well, I have registered for this extension and it is well worth it.  Very
easy to learn and use.  I am hoping for floating point and other additions in
the next release, though.  Anyone else been using this?

You sure can in AMOS Pro.  Look at the TRACK commands.  Also, Paul Reece
makes the EME extension which replaces the current Music.Lib and it does
everything!  I am sure he will contact you!  :)

I am currently working on my next Accessory program for Amos Professional 
that will crunch any program in the AMOSPro EDITOR using powerpacker.library
to disk and decrunch it back into the EDITOR. It is currently about 90% 
complete, I thought I had it finished ... but of course I had discovered 
a few more bugs and in the process of removing them I had changed a few 
things as well. I need to write the docs up sometime this or next week 
and then upload it to Aminet (wuarchive.wustl.edu) :)

Look for it soon !!

Greg

Hey all,
	This is my first addition to the list (There should be more ;> )  
Does anyone know where the Sticks Extension is?!  It lets Amos use all 
the buttons on a sega pad.  It supposed to be on Aminet, at least Ryan Scott 
said so.  It is public domain, if anyone has it could you mail it to me 
or put it on the list or something?

Thanks for your interest in my new program and it has nothing to do with 
the two commands that come with the AMOSPro compiler that pack banks. My 
Accessory once installed in your AMOSPro pull-down menu system will be a 
replacement for the menu options LOAD/SAVE/SAVE AS. Instead of saving 
your code that you've been typing in the AMOSPro EDITOR to disk using the 
pull-down menu option SAVE/SAVE AS you'll be able to use my option ppSAVE 
that will crunch the entire code including any banks that are attached to 
your program and save it to disk. To determine the difference between a 
normally saved .AMOS file and ppSAVE Accessory will be the suffix .ppAMOS !

Soon as I get it finished I'll send you a uuencoded copy :)

Later

Is anyone aware (and could briefly explain) of any differences between
WB 1.3, 2 and 3 regarding access of the serial port and, thus, any
differences which might have occurred between how AMOS and AMOS Pro accesses
the serial port?


BTW, regarding the use of Powerpacker library in AMOS pro (this might be old
news here) but the AMOS pro compiler also allows you to make use of PP library.

Listen you guys you hgotta read my post more carefully about my new 
accessory program in what it does cuz I don't know how many more ways to 
describe it ... feel like I'm repeating myself :)

It has nothing to do with the AMOSPro Compiler extension commands ppsave 
or ppload a matter of fact it's not an extension (commands) it is an 
ACCESSORY program which saves your CODE in the AMOS Professional EDITOR 
that you are typing on in and crunches it. When you wanna load in your 
programs you load in your program via the pull-down menu or hotkey and a 
requester appears and ask you to load in an .AMOS program well my program 
replaces this and does the same thing except crunches and decrunches 
(same as SAVE/SAVE AS/LOAD), a requester appears and you enter a filename 
with the suffix .ppAMOS instead of .AMOS and it loads it into your EDITOR 
where you can then edit it and there is no other program out there that 
does such a task that I am aware of. It doesn't use the compiler 
extension what-so-ever it uses Nico Francois's CRUNCH and DECRUNCH (CLI) 
commands and the powerpacker.library. Using this method to save your code 
to disk will save you alot of disk space compared to AMOSPro's ordinary 
method. You cannot use the ordinary LOAD option to load in your AMOSPro 
code you have to use the ppLOAD accessory. I hope this explains it a bit 
better if I confused any of you out there in AMOSland. No insults or 
arguments are intended on my part I am just seeing your post and it looks 
like some of you are getting the wrong idea on what my accessory program 
does. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH AMOSPRO COMPILER EXTENSION COMMMANDS THAT 
PACKS MEMORY BANKS !! :)

I'm not sure if this is quite what you want, but delitracker (Or one of it's
genies to be precise) lets you save the module to a single sample as it is 
played. If you do find any that compresses several tracks into 1, please me me 
know

Of course, he lives in Sunshine, Florida, so I don't know how much more of
a vacation he would need!! ;)

You're crazy.  ;-)

I've been so busy folks, sorry if no one has heard from me - I've been 
trying to reply asaipc.

I've been working 60+ hours a week plus TURBO PLUS comes out on coverdisk 
of CU Amiga tomorrow!

look for it everybody!

Ryan

ps: The folks I am dealing with took the liberty of calling it Craft 2 or 
something like that.  Dont' be alarmed.  Its TURBO PLUS and works like 
TURBO PLUS, not like Craft, thank god.

I am currently working on a new project which will be released soon into 
the NetWorld for all AMOSPro coders.

Project Name: ppLOAD
Description:  Loads an powerpacked ".AMOS" program into the AMOS Professional
              EDITOR.
Status:       100% complete just need to finish writing the documentation.

Project Name: ppSAVE
Description: Saves current program in the AMOS Professional EDITOR as a
             powerpacked ".ppAMOS" file. Saving you 1/2 the disk space 
             compared to AMOS Professional's SAVE AS/SAVE option.
Status:      100% complete just need to finish writing the documentation.

Both of these accessories will required to be installed in your USER menu 
or by selecting SET PROGRAM TO MENU option as which I have done. 

NOTE: Both the accessories will require the CLI commands "Crunch" and
      "Decrunch" by Nico Francois. These two CLI commands need to be
      in your current disk C: directory or your HardDisk else these
      accessories will not work.

I came up with the idea just the other day and only took me 2 hours to
write. The main reason was that I was looking for a method of saving my
AMOS programs in my current window within the AMOSPro EDITOR in half the
disk space that it would normally be saved if I used the option SAVE/SAVE AS.
Well this is what I came up with ... with the help of Nico Francois (Thanx!)
two CLI commands. 

Look for it on Aminet soon :)

	At first I like to thank Paul Reece(Its not your fault) taking the time 
to upload this but what's wrong with it?!  I printed out the docs, install 
the thing, restart amos (that requester was a surprise), and tried my 
hand at a small program:

	Do
	  M=Multi Joy(0)
	  Print Bin$(M)
	Loop

and what happens!?  The Loop executes once and quits!  It doesn't give an 
error, it doesn't do dome strange hang-the-system type thing, it just 
ends the program!  Has anyone else had this problem?  Maybe I just got a 
bum file or something.

Jedon,

If you want a fast 2D rotation routine (even in Uncompiled Amos) then talk
to Ryan Scott about getting a back issue #13 of Playfield!.  (Or Ryan, would
you mind if I post the Demo+Article here? (10k LHA file))

As for Rotating directly in the Bank, that wouldn't work so well as you'd be
rotating an already rotated image, and after a while your images would look
pretty ugly.  :)  But, rotating from the Bank to the Screen would work, as
the bank image wouldn't be touched.

Summary: How can you set up structures in AMOS like you can in C. Can you?
Keywords: AMOS STRUCTURES
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.2 PL2 [VAX/VMS]]

Just for simplicity, I use amos to get programs done and out of the way. 
Is there a way to set up structures in AMOS like you can in C? For example:

struct gameheader {
	unsigned int Version;
	unsigned char Name[8];
	unsigned char Reserved[52];
} Header;

Any help that you can give me is appreciated. I have a 1 drive system and 
amos is much easier for me to develop programs in than C because you can 
only fit so many libraries on one boot disk. Thanx again... 8)

If they have no plan (the company) for porting AMOS to PC, would there be 
any laws concerning a group of people getting together and porting it? If 
there are laws commercially, how about releasing it as public domain?

OK, this is probably a really stupid question, but:

My harddrive crashed, so I had to reformat it and re-install AMOS 1.36, 
which I had on it working just fine before.  However, now when I try to 
compile something which uses AMOS 3D or Turbo Plus or Craft commands, the 
compiler kicks me back out and tells me that the extension is not 
loaded.  but when I first run AMOS, it tells me that all the extensions 
are loaded.

Is there a compiler.config file or something that I need to play with to 
get the extensions to compile.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I have just uploaded a beta version of my easylife extension for AMOS pro for
aminet. New features are:

  - Support for loading and saving of XPK compressed data & banks (Not sprite
    & Icon banks, but now Andrew church has posted the format, I'm working on
    it).

  - Improved string searching commands.

  - A few bug fixes.


The extension is freeware. Distribute it as you see fit, but remember that this
is only a beta release - I believe the is a bug in the XPK load routine some-
where, as this has crashed a few times on me. Also included are 2 usefull
accessory programs:

VarChecker.AMOS
===============

This scans the a program in the AMOS Pro editor, and checks for:

  - Global variables being made global after they are used.

  - Global variables being made shared in some procedures.

  - Shared variables not be used in the procedure they are made shared with.

  - Global / Shared variables never being used / never having values assigned
    to them / never having their values read.

  - Using a variable before defining it (E.g. Add A,1 before A has been   
    initialised with e.g. A=0)

  - Never refering to a variable you have assigned a value to (E.g. A=5, then
    not using A again in the procedure)

If your programs pass these tests, you can be confident that you style of coding
is good, and that your programs contain fewer bugs.




Shorten.AMOS
============

Those who have beta tested my pratched text editor (Which I hope to release,
eventually - I'm still converting to AMOS Pro & doing 1001 other things) may
recognise this bit of code, which I have adapted to work with the AMOS Pro
editor. It takes a program, and strips away all comments, and optionally also
replaces all long names of variables/labels/procedures with shorter ones.

This saves space both on disk, and during execution.





Please let me know if you download these programs how you got on. Even if you
have nothing to say other than "I downloaded it, It worked". I'd like to hear
that everything is OK, just as much as bug reports/suggestions.

You can produce a clone of Amos if you use all your own code and just 
duplicate the functionality.  After all, Amos is just a dialect of BASIC.

They are not porting AMOS but Francois is making a product called Klik N Play.

Define "better" - VB is a pig.  It's not BASIC, no way no how, and it 
runs under Windoze, which is a minus for any application.  Even the 
scripting language in WFW is better!  (I wrote a game in it.  :)

Yes, but from what Francois tells me - Klik n play can do 100 256 colour 
bobs on screen moving in full frame rate.  Big ones.  Sounds fantastic 
and a bit unbelievable, but never know....

Visual Basic sucks, sorry to say - I mean it has some hidden power in 
there, but its dog slow, graphics wise at least.

Ok, everyone TURBO PLUS V2 is now available - update from V1 is $7 to 
help cover my costs - it comes with a new manual and a new system disk....

Features:

a handful of new fast commands - F Sqr (double speed square root)
Scene Scan X&Y for searching horizontally and vertically in a scene
plus some more I can't remember (I didnt intend to post this login session!)

Scenes are now standard AMOS banks and can contain several THOUSAND 
icons!  And they are even FASTER than V1 scene commands!

The Scene Editor has been improved greatly as well - pages of icons 
instead of just one measly screenful, brushes are completely visible on 
screen in real time, many new features including 10 ranges of random and 
stencil - change range with a simple keystroke.  Lots of good stuff - 
worth every penny.

Look for V1 on CU Amiga NOW - beware I think they disguised it as CRAFT2 
(spread the word, it sure isn't related to CRAFT!)

Again, update for registered users is $7, sent to PLAYFIELD!

	You know, there's a Visual BASIC for DOS too.  And you can't argue
that it's not BASIC because it can compile any QBASIC program (and QBASIC
is an expansion on BASIC).  I wouldn't rate it as high as AMOS (because it
doesn't look possible to make a language as good as AMOS on the PC... please
someone prove me wrong), but it looks like THE high level language to use
on the PC to me.  I've been programming with Visual BASIC (both DOS and
Windows) for about a month and a half now (where I work) and have come up
with some pretty nice programs ... very quickly!

Latest news on my latest Accessory program for AMOSPro has been put on 
HOLD due too I think it needs some more work. All is working, but not as
I would like it to be and I for one don't wanna distribute a half-as* 
program that's not user friendly. Soon as I do get it finished I'll let 
ya all know.

Sorry for the delay for those who have requested it, I haven't forgotten 
you and I will send you all a UUENCODED version as soon as it is 
completed. Thanx for your patience :)

OK, here's a weird one: When I try to define more than 14 edit zones in and
AMOS Pro interface program it says "Interface error: buffer too small"
This error is totally undocumented and I can find no way t increase the buffer!
I have tried SET BUFFER and RESERVE ZONE to no affect. Help!

First off a bug - If you had the following code (Line numbers added for
clarity):


1|  If A=1
2|    Print "A equals 1"
3|  Else If A=2 
4|    Print "Hello"
5|  Else If 6/0=4
6|    Print "Go Away"
7|  End If



You will notice in line 5 there is an error. However, when the program
crashes, AMOS Pro reports the error to be in line 1. I spent 1/2 an hour
last night trying to work out how the line 'If SCRW = 4' could produce an
illegal function call!!!





Second off, a bug/question:

In the manual it says that the =Dev First$("") function can be used with
the following strings:

	"**"   =  List all devices and assigns
        "D/**" =  List just devices
        "A/**" =  List just assigns

In reality I find:

        "C:"   =  List all devices and assigns (Any 2 character+ string
                  ending with a ':' will work)
        ""     =  List just devices

Anyone know how to list just assigns?




Finally, does anyone know a way of detecting if a line of AMOS code is
a procedure which cannot be unfolded because it contains machine code,
using the Ask Editor/Call Editor commands from an accessory?

Why do you need to convert from Protracker to Soundtracker???

Soundtracker is the same, except it doesn't have the fancy Exx effect 
commands.
(or 9xx)

Why not just get EME?? :-)

Actuall it's quite easy... :-) Try this

Dialog open CHAN,DIALOG$,100,10000

This sets up the buffer you need!

OK, I spoke to Francois a week ago and this is what's happening.

AMOSPRO will be coverdisk material around Xmas.

At this stage, there will never be any updates to PRO, AMOS or the compilers.

If Europress agree to it, the PRO Source code will be released into PD.

Just thought you would like to know.

I've hit the same problem. I also seem to recall that the same problem
arises when you have that many buttons also. I would also like to know the
answer.

Will the PRO compiler make it into PD or coverdisk any time soon?  How 
about 3D, etc?  (And how about making Turbo PD? :)

There hasn't been a specific version for AMOSPro, However the old AMOS 3-D
will work with AMOSPro.

There are a few games out there in AMOS 3-D such as Night Assault which I 
wish was available on Aminet so I could check it out and also Super 
BattleZone.

I thought they fixed Amos 3D so it works with pro? I use original so don't
flame if I'm wrong.

As to it's source code, I don't think it will be avalible in PD as the
extemnsion was done by VooDoo software and not creators of Amos but let's
keep our fingers crossed.

Subject: Aaarghh! Turbo Plus
Status: RO

I'm writing an application in Pro on my '030 500+, and thought I'd 
replace all my button drawing commands with Turbo Plus's (from CU Amiga)
F Draw commands.

It certainly speeds up the redrawing of complicated screens, but has the
annoying habit of filling the screen with random horizontal lines about
5 pixels long.

Is this a known bug in Turbo Plus. Is it fixed in V2?  Ryan?

I do know the answer to the compiler question, but you will all have to 
wait and see! I can't speak for Turbo, As for 3D, Whoever wrote it still 
have the rights to it.

You might have problems getting the Object Modeler to work with anything
greater than KS 1.3 though. :-(

	I was just tooling around in amos this afternoon (It's about all 
I do).  I wrote a program that was supposed to speak a phrase using the 
amos say command while displaying a moving mouth.  A bit of my code:

	...
	Say PHRASE$,1
	For I=1 to Mouth
	  'Move the mouth
	  'There really was code here
	  'but its not relevent
	Next I
	...

>From the looks of the manual the ,1 at the end of the say command should 
have spoken the phrase with multi-tasking while continuing with the rest 
of the program.  The Problem?  It doesn't multi-task and my program ends 
up looking like an old, dubbed japanese flick.  Does anyone know how to 
get around this.  Can you even.  Any info would be helpful.

NO! And probably never will be, as far as AMOS is concerned, it is dead, 
the only new stuff you will see for it will come from loyal users.

In the august number of "Amiga Computing" there is a review of
"Liberator".
Does anybody have any experience with these extensions?
I'd like to know does it work with AMOS Pro and ifso, how can
I order (and pay)?

You know, I haven't heard of this bug, except on my computer - no other 
testers or users have mentioned it ever.  I thought it was because my 
machine is running a strange way - I have a rom file running in ram and a 
14mhz accelerator, etc etc... It only happens occasionally.  It is most 
noticable when multitasking - TURBO PLUS wants to own the blitter as much 
as it can for speed reasons.  Try turning Multi No when you can and let 
me know what happens.

It only does it when it feels like it, so it's quite hard to check. I don't
think it happens with Multi No, but that's not much use to me, as I
need the multitasking for the program I'm writing. :-(

Liberator is Intuition interface, essentially.  Very complicated because 
you have to know everyuthig about Intuition to use it - structures, every 
damn little thing.  I think I'd rather learn C than learn Liberator - but 
really I'd rather just use Andy's Intuition Extension - much more AMOSized.

I would it be possible to use Multi no before the drawing and then 
reenable?  Multi No in Pro does not entirely disable multi tasking - Key 
State and even Inkey$ still work.  You may even be able to use AMOS Pri 
to change the priority.  Admittedly I'm just guessing, I'd have to see 
your program.  I wonder - does it happen more when you are running other 
programs on your system at the same time, or when its alone?  Do you ever 
get those lines on other screens like the workbench?

Well I have a copy of it - if you wish to use it you better get out your 
Rom Kernal Manuals.  Its powerful but a steep learning curve.  You're 
better off jumping right into C.  I don't know how to order, sorry.

Has anyone ever written a program to accept STDIN or piping?  For
instance, if I wrote a program called WC that would count the number of words
and lines in a text file, would I be able to:

type textfile.txt > WC

or

type textfile.txt | WC

I know i can do: WC textfile.txt, but then could I do:

WC textfile.txt > result.txt

with result.txt being created and containing the output of WC?

If anyone is familiar with programs like AWK or GREP, help me out if you
can, please!  :)

I'm not sure how the shell handles pipes - the easiest way to test it 
would be to try it!
 
> I know i can do: WC textfile.txt, but then could I do:

Only if WC directed its output to the current shell window, which under 
AMOS is hard to do.  You could be sneaky, and use a different 
metacharacter, maybe @ or something else that isn't used, and get the 
AMOS program to redirect it, but it's not a very good solution...  For 
this kind of thing you're better off using C.

Here's a nice awk program...  (Dunno if it works in GNU awk, but it works 
in System V...)

awk '
FILENAME != prevfile {    # new file
    NR = 1                # reset line number
    prevfile = FILENAME
}
NF > 0 {
    if ($1 == lastword)
        printf "double %s, file %s, line %d\n",$1,FILENAME,NR
    for (i = 2; i <= NF; i++)
        if ($i == $(i-1))
            printf "double %s, file %s, line %d\n",$i,FILENAME,NR
    if (NF > 0)
        lastword = $NF
}' $*

It looks for pairs of identical adjacent words...  Kinda nifty. :)  (And 
you can pipe it.  Not that this helps you at all. :)

I don't think AMOS was really ever designed for running from a shell, so 
while there probably IS a way of piping and redirecting input and output, 
C would be a lot easier.  (What am I saying?  C EASY? :)

Any awk/grep questions, just ask! :)  (And here's something nice - search 
for users with no password an a *NIX machine :

grep '^[^:]*::' /etc/passwd

Not that I condone this sort of activity... :)

I thought you might say that.  :(  I can write it in C without any problems
just because it has special/standard facilities for STDIN and STDOUT.  I
just get tired of C at work.

There's always a possibility that it uses the PIPE: device...

Tired of C?  Blasphemy!  :)  For years I was scared of C - all those 
braces gave me nightmares, but it's actually a nice language...  Now all 
I need is SAS C!  What AMOS needs is stdio support, but really AMOS is 
useless for shell programs - the compiler produces some BIG code!

This is kind of off the AMOS topic now, but anyone know how far the LINUX 
port to the Amiga is from completion?  (And what kind of system will it 
require?)

Nope. Although holding down Left Amiga and A constantly for about 5

This is not excuse making, but one thing to keep in mind is that TURBO 
PLUS was created for raw speed and not necessarily to be nice in 
multitasking.  Although this doesn't make an excuse for serious bugs ;-)

ONE NOTE:  Turns out some foolish git at CU Amiga put a very old version 
of TURBO PLUS on the coverdisk.  Spread the word - the update for 20 
pounds is QUITE substancial.

	I just a couple days ago wrote a program that takes input from STDIN
and outputs to STDOUT.  But it was on the PC (even though I'm normally and
amiga programmer).  It was to eliminate the chr(7)'s from a file that is
being output so I don't get beeps then TYPEing binary files.  The ways I can
use it are:
TYPE file | quiet
quiet < file
Type file | quiet | more
but NOT:
more < quiet < file  (not on the PC anyway... is there a way to do this?)
If you want to output the results to a file, I think you can go go like this:
type file | quiet > outfile
That would output the original file to outfile without chr(7)'s.
maybe you can even go like this, but I havent tried:
quiet < file > outfile

Pinball Dreams/Phantasies Clone w/Editor so you can construct your own

money $$$ in the process.

Anyone else out there have any good GAME idea's to write in AMOS ? or

Status: RO

  Given the likelihood (or is it certain now?) of the AMOS source code
eventually going into the public domain, I think a team of programmers
should be created which would work on improving AMOS, fixing the bugs,
etc.  The team would discuss problems and send code through E-mail, and
release updates occasionally.  This way work on AMOS could be
coordinated and accomplished quickly, and there would be a single
official version, rather than people going and making their own changes
to the code and having lots of different versions (which would most
likely be incompatible with each other).

  If you would be interested in joining such a team, let me know.  You
will need experience in assembler, since that's what AMOS is written in.
The AMOS code itself probably won't be out for a while, but the team
could still bounce around ideas, compile a bug list, etc., and be able
to start working immediately when the code is finally released.

I'm having trouble with mail bouncing back from the list btw...

I heard something about the entire nsf backbone going down a few days ago 
- but they got it back up relatively quickly.  All the routers just quit.
The net can survive a nuclear attack, but not its own engineering ;-)

I wanted to get the word out - please spread this information far and 
wide -

some foolish git at CU Amiga put an OLD version of TURBO PLUS on the 
coverdisk.  I don't think it even had any decent demos.  Spread the word, 
and let people know that this makes the update even more substantial.

I'll reup the demos I had in the next message- spread em please!  damage

Liberator is Intuition interface, essentially.  Very complicated because
you have to know everyuthig about Intuition to use it - structures, every
damn little thing.  I think I'd rather learn C than learn Liberator - but
really I'd rather just use Andy's Intuition Extension - much more AMOSized.

Anyone read the latest Amiga Report 2.22?  Some very nice information in 
there about C=, and some good reviews etc.  I was impressed with this 
issue...

Ha!  That issue is already in, here in Hobart!!  (should be anyways - 
Doesn't take long)

We have a local store that imports the mags from a place in QLD which 
imports them from the UK REALLY QUICK!

I get mags about 2 months or so before the Newsagencies get them...

  Is there a list somewhere of all Amiga-related magazines?  I know about
AmigaWorld (a.k.a. AmigaWhirled :-) ) and Amazing Computing for the Amiga,
but that's it.

Ok, here's the ones I can remeber off the top of my head...

Amiga Format, Amiga Shopper, CU Amiga, Amiga Computing, Amiga User 
International, Amiga Force, Amiga World, Amazing, Amiga Power, CD32 User 
(or something similar), plus The Edge, a multi-format magazine that 
(occasionally) covers the Amiga.

There are loads more in non-English speaking countries...  I have 
addresses for most of the above, if anyone wants to subscribe.

  Someone's reading my mind... :-)  This is exactly what I'm in the
planning stage of right now.  When it's done (which may be a while,
what with all the other things I'm working on too), it'll have all
sorts of stuff, including all your standard targets, ramps, ball
locking, ball eaters :-) , and of course SFX (user-definable, and
can use samples off your HD!) and music (the same).

  Any ideas, etc., let me know.

  As an addendum to my proposal, I'd like everyone to let me know of any
bugs you've found in AMOS Pro.  (I need specifics: not just "this doesn't
work", but rather "when I try to do this, this happens instead".  Of
course, now I'm going to get 10-15 messages quoting that last
sentence.... :-) )  Also, mail me any suggestions you have for
improvements.  This way, when the source code for AMOS is released, the
AMOS team can get to work right away.

  You can also send bug reports from the Compiler, although I don't know
whether we'll get that source.

Here's a complete (I think) list of UK `off the shelf' Amiga specific mags.

Amiga Format
Amiga Computing
Amiga Shopper
CU Amiga
Amiga Pro (Incorporating 32 games mag)
Amiga Power
Amiga Force
Amiga Action
The One - Amiga
Amiga User International
   (Occasionally incorporating Amiga CD! a CD based CD32 magazine
   with CDXL video clips, demos, reviews, PD games & some CDTV stuff)
Amiga CD32 (with cover CD) - Related to Amiga Format & Amiga Power
Amiga CD32 Gamer (with Cover CD)

There is also the subscription only magazine JAM (Just Amiga Monthly)
for `serious' Amiga users. It is a black & white 48 page mag, with
virtually no advertising, and is produced entirely on Amigas.

If you wanted it to be `official', you'd have to talk to Europress first.
If they release it as PD, then ANYONE will be able to do whatever they
want with it.

I don't see any reason why assembler experience should be needed. There are
a lot of very experienced AMOS programmers who know nothing about assembler.

Something I'd like to see would be a change to the extensions system, so
any number of extensions could be loaded at once, and not have to have their
own extension number. I think this will be a big problem if/when the source
code becomes available, with everyone producing their own extensions.

I did upload these, back on the 14th of july, but they don't seem to have 
appeared on my local aminet mirror yet - I haven't looked anywhere else, so

your time ( & Disk Quota), but for those with AMOS Pro, you should use the
variable checker, even if you don't want to because you know it is going to

Does anyone have an AMOS routine to read ALL the buttons on the
CD32 controller?

I have the Blitz2 program that does it, but can't seem to convert it
to AMOS.

	Hello Everyone!  just out of curiousity.  If The Amos_Pro 
Compiler is going to be released on to an Amiga Format disk or 
something.  Does that make it Public domain?  Because I have very hard 
time getting ahold of these Euro magazines that release this stuff.  Is 
there any chance it could show up on aminet or something?

	Just curious  :-)

	Thanks!

                             ^^^^^^

`Should' being the operative word. There is nothing to stop ANYONE else
setting up a similar group, releasing incompatible versions of AMOS.
This is where some kind of backing from Europress would be very useful,
even if it is just a mention in their doc files, when they release the
source code, with an address for the `Official AMOS Product Development
Team'.

But knowing how AMOS works *will* help. It is only people that have real
experience of AMOS that can tell you exactly what needs to be done to
improve it, and exactly what the bugs are. If the team is just a group
of assembler programmers, you will end up with a new version of
AMOS, that will only be of use to other assembler programmers, who will
not bother with it as they could do better in assembler!

AMOS was produced with the average user in mind, and should stay that way.
The only way you will do anything to improve it is to get maximum input
from the people who use it every day.

Also, lots of assembler programmers working on different aspects of one
program is bound to lead to problems. The Main Development Team for
AMOS Pro consisted of one main assembly programmer (Franois), and
eleven AMOS enthusiasts. Richard Vanner would ask us all what we wanted
to see in AMOS Pro, he would tell Franois, and Franois would go off
and do whatever he wanted! The system worked perfectly!
(Well, 97% perfectly according to Amiga Format and CU Amiga)

Perhaps you should ask Franois if he wants to be on the team! :)

In Australia there is:

Nope..  Copyright still exists until Europress actually SAYS that it is PD..

The idea is to STOP this from happening...  Everyone will have rogue 
versions of Amos and 1 program will have trouble working on different 
copies...  = BIG TROUBLE!

Exactly..  The source shouldn't be available to everyone..  If it does 
however, the 'team' can put out their own release..  Look whats happened 
to many other programs on the Amiga....

Hi all,

Remember last year (those who were here) when somebody thought it would
be a good idea to make an Amos Christmas demo?

It never went ahead because it started too late...but I think we should
get a group together to show everyone what Amos can do...particularly
now that there are Turbo extensions out etc.

If anyone is interested, I have a little christmassy tune that I
volunteer to use.  It's short, but it's very christmassy.

Any suggestions?

Carl.

official didn't mean 'Official Europress Seal of Approval'... Just to

True, but what code are they going to write for AMOS?  The development 
list should only have folks who are integral to development, with input 
from the regular amos list, which most in the project would already be on.

Yeah, I agree 100%.  And Manuel tells me that with AMOS Pro, 2 registers 
get saved & restored every time a command is called in an extension.  
This wastes lots of time...

He's discovered many many new areas that need fixing up.  He's gone 
through more areas of the source code - believes he can speed up sprites 
at least 2-3 times, bobs at least the same, working on copper list 
routines, copperwrap 8 way scroller, aga graphics, and lots of other 
goodies at the moment.  Sped up Screen command which can make a big 
difference depending on the program.  300-25% or thereabouts...

AMOS still has a VAST amount of power that we're just starting to chip 
away at.  It can go many many times faster than it currently does.  Thats 
pretty much the aim of the TURBO project - *speed*

Its been my experience that you are not allowed to copy them, but people 
do anyway, even to pd boards.  But if someone wants to copy TURBO PLUS 
coverdisk - they can feel free....  the further it goes the better.

Sure thing.  I could imagine some 'shadow' organization trying to pull it 
off - of course it'd cost $150 upon release...  he he..

I really doubt Eurpress gives 2 cr*ps about AMOS anymore.  However, I see 
your perspective.

Well, the development team should release updates to the regular amos 
list, if you ask me, or  separate list of beta testers/suggestion 
makers.  to have a core list for programmers is important too - so they 
can interact without too much interference or input until and when they 
want it.  But yes I see what you are saying...

> Perhaps you should ask Franois if he wants to be on the team! :)

I agree, but whatever they release will have the Europress name on it. I
don't think they particularly want rogue versions of AMOS - with their 
name on - wiping people's hard disks etc.

Maybe post the program (if it is not over 4k) and see if someone else can

Well, you are supposed to pay for it by buying the magazine.  Perhaps you can
find someone who has access to the mags to buy it for you?

Below is the Blitz listing for the CD2 controller. Does anyone fancy
trying to convert it to AMOS. It seems not all Amigas are capable
of reading the controller, which might give you some probs :)

I am particularly interested in the Play/Pause button. Blue and Red
are easy.

Just wanted to inform you:

My brother just called and said that there seems to be an update
to "LDos" by Niklas Sj=F6berg. I had received a letter with 2
disks in it... The update, hopefully :-) I'll tell you later
what's new.

(I hope that LAnsi() finally works :-)

BTW - I wanted to unsubscribe, but I still am on this list...
but now I receive every message only once. Cool :-) Maybe I'll
hang here a bit longer.

PS. Amiga E v3.0 demo version is on aminet. Check it out :-)
    I hate C, but E looks cool.

PS2. ACE Basic update should arrive within a couple of weeks.
     The author told on ACE mailing list that the work was delayed
     because he watched Jupiter explode.

One assembler programmer working on a large project is more likely to 
experience more problems than a bunch of them.  The reason for this is
that he/she doesn't have the variety of knowledge and experience that
a group would have and have anyone who knows the project to bounce ideas
off of.  Just look at all the side effects and inconsistencies that are
present in Amos and you will see that things weren't done in the best 
way that they could have been always.  The interface language especially
comes to mind - it is not logically designed - and at the time I started
learning it I wondered what world the programmers who wrote it were in -
well I now know it was done by one guy and understand why it is the way
it is.

But AMOS enthusiasts can only make suggestions unless they know about the
inner-workings of AMOS and can at least read assembly code.

Well, except for all those darn bugs, inefficient algorithms, design
flaws, inconsistencies, side effects, and bizzare implementations.

	Thanks for the note Paul.  :-)   I was never quite sure how that 
worked.  Do you happen to know which Magazine is going to have the 
Compiler as it's Cover Disk?  and which month it will be featured in?  
That will make it a little easier for me to snag.

	Thanks Again!

	I'v been hearing a little bit about this TURBO PLUS.  What 
exactly can it do?  (please excuse my newness to the list  8^)   ...
Which magazine featured it as a Cover disk?

I believe you simply specify a screen with 64 colors.
You cant redefine the last 32 colors, they are halfbright the first half.

In that case, any chance of you uploading the intended disk to Aminet?  
:)  I hate to think I paid my $67867891 for CU to get something you 
didn't want me to get...  *grin*

Just in case you don't actually know this, it means that colours 32 -> 63 
are half as bright as a corresponding colour in the first 32 colours.  
For example, if colour #1 was $888 then colour number 33 would be $444.

If you want to use all sixteen greyscale shades (ie. non AGA, surprise 
surprise) then your don't need to use all 16 shades in the first 32 
colours.  Youd have to work out what shades you need to define though.

  For the curious, here are the necessary RGB values (pick any 11 colour
registers of the first 32):

$FFF, $EEE, $DDD, $CCC, $BBB, $AAA, $999, $888, $666, $444, $111.

(The last 3 can vary - this is one possible set.)

DB (I call you DB because it is quicker and it sorta sounds like a

Second, anyone ever write one of those programs that takes a phone number
and spits out all the different letter combonations?  If you have the
little routine that does all the figuring of the combonations, I would
appreciate it.  I did it long ago, but can't remember a thing!

I am not sure if this message got through, but there is a tactical
star fleet battle game called Fleet and it is on Aminet under the
game/think directory.  The filename is fleetv1.lha

It is written in AMOS Pro and is pretty nice to play.

                          gcox@ctsnet.cts.com

I'm looking for:

- FontBankMaker Pro
- LadyBug Mapper (For the LadyBug game)
- APro Rainbow Maker
- Any kind of Plasma or Fractal programs done in AMOS or AMOSPro
- RAMOSPro
- CrossFire (TARG arcade clone NTSC version)
- Arcadia (ARKNOID aracde clone)
- ScrollingMapDefiner
- DUMP Extension (If one exist)

Thanx! 

Only send it if it is freely distributable, as I'm am not sure if any or all
of the above are or not.

	I tested the easylife extension on TechnoVenture.  It did pretty well
I guess... just one or two serious problems (Unreferenced variables).  I was
passing a parameter that i didn't use in one procedure.  The other problems
weren't so serious.  They were all undeclared variables (or something), but
all variables I expected to be zero or didn't care what they were at the
beginning.  But I have some consolation in the fact that TechnoVenture
testing also found a problem in the accessory (I guess it's not such a
"consolation" to Paul Hickman).  The following program will cause an
unnecessary Unreferenced variable notice:
TEST
B=Param
If(B mod 4)=1 Then Print "hi"
Procedure TEST
End Proc[5]

It doesn't believe that the variable B is referenced.  Silly me, I probably
didn't need to make a procedure... I just wanted to make it as similar to the
original program segment as possible.

I have two or three Julia/Mandelbrot plotters...

Copy the AMOSPro System disk, and delete the following files from the 
APSystem folder:

AMOSPro.Editor
AMOSPro.Editor_Config
AMOSPro.Monitor
AMOSPro.Monitor_Resource

Then either change the startup-sequence to read "AMOS progname.amos" or 
just call your program AUTOEXEC.AMOS.  (It's all in the manual, Chapter 
14, Appendix B.)

Dunno - is this anything like the STOS SBK dump/edit thing?  If so, I 
have one I wrote years ago...

> > Thanx! 

If you want the Mandelbrot/Julia things, let me know - the ones I know I 
have are :

Mandel64.AMOS    - Plots the Mandelbrot/Julia sets in 64 (yes, 64!) grayscales
                   on any Amiga.
MandelScape.AMOS - Plots the Mandelbrot set as an isometric projection.
Frax.AMOS        - Mandelbrot/Julia plotter with quick previews.

They're all fairly short, about 30 or 40k as far as I remember.  I wrote 
them all myself back when Mandelbrot sets were cool. :)
