Nope, the 2.0 update disks come with the Pro Compiler.
If you didn`t get the update disks as part of the
package, you need to speak to your dealer!

-Amos Compiler Probs-

Has anyone had any problems with Amos compiler similar to this:-

I starts compiling ok, but when it gets to within 4 or 5 arrows from the end,
it half stops.  It doesn't give me an error message, but just keeps on
compiling until the disk is full, a bit annoying when there is 100MB free on
my partition.  I didn't used to have this problem, but it keeps happening on
most things I try to compile now, so it either a problem in my listing or a
bug in the compiler.  I write the progs in AmosPro but they load up into Amos
fine.  I think it started when I updated from AmosPro V1 to AmosPro V1.12 so
the compiler would work in it, but I can't see what probs this would cause,
the same thing happens if I boot off my old floppies rather than using the
version on my hard disk.  It may of started when I got my Blizzard 1220/4
which takes amos up to a very useable speed to write some half decent games
in.

Is AmosPro compiler any better as I may have to buy that?

This sounds strange.  I`m using an A4000/060 with lots of Fast RAM
and a hard drive, and I`ve not had any problems with either
AMOS or AMOS Pro.

You don`t say which version of AMOS you`re using though.  I`m
on AMOS 1.36 and Pro 2.0, though I`ve also used every version
from AMOS 1.34 and Pro 1.10 upwards on the A4000 with no
noticeable problems either.

Is it just AMOS that crashes, or are you noticing crashing
with other software as well?  It might possibly be your
memory board causing the problems, rather than AMOS.

You haven`t added anything new to your Workbench setup
have you?  I know how easy it is to add a new system patch
or commodity, then forget about it until you discover
months later that it`s causing problems with a new bit
of software/hardware...

I can`t really think of anything else to add, I hope
some of this might help you though!

Chris

Yup, I program in AMOS amongst loads of other much more fashionable 
things, just because it's quick and easy to play about with.

Well anyway, excuses aside, I have an A1200, and I never had any problems 
with running AMOS... until I put in 4 meg of fast RAM. Now it crashes all 
the time, and it's really irritating...!!

I'm also incidentally running off hard disk, if that makes the slightest 
bit of difference...

Does anyone know of any patches or anything that will stop AMOS crashing 
all the time??

Thanks in advance... sorry to burden you with such trivial problems!!

Well, this could be my last program for the Amiga. Nobody seems interested
in helping each other anymore, which was one of the great things that was
happening when I first joined the list all those many years ago.
That doesn't seem to happen any more. I even put my latest anim2bob convert
up on my web page( the server that it's on - the same as the amos page -is
down at the moment, it might be back up next week). No one has sent me any
feed back on it. Jeez, it was free, but even then, no one could be bothered
sending some suggestions or comments. Does that mean no one downloaded it?
Or no one uses amos anymore.
   
    My current project is an upgraded version of spacewar, with 3D sections
and a possible net interface to play it over the phone. I'm stuck on a few
things- so I need help. In the past, when I've sent my projects out to
people who wanted to help, I've never received and replies. They just take
the programs and dissapear. This the last time I'm going to send out code
if I don't get some people interested in helping.
  If your interested, mail me back, and I'll post the code, otherwise
.....goodbye.


Till then, here's a quick piece of code that I knocked up in an hour. It's
fairly specific to bobs from a series of them in a single IFF.
ie              bob1   bob2   bob3  bob4
                bob5   bob6   bob7  bob8
etc.
It also loads and displays banks. It's a lot quicker than the object editor
to view banks.
PS.. for a huge speed increse, try compiling the object editor, and all the
accessories and save them back under the same names so the editor can find
them. Remember to back up the accesories first before overwriting them,
just in case you need to restore them later.

oh, the program:

Thanks very much for replying!!... I am also using amospro 2.0, and yup, 
I've also got 4 meg of fastram... it's bizarre, because nothing else 
stopped working, just AMOSPro. :(

Sometimes it'll be fine, but then sometimes it'll load up then crash after 
a while, sometimes the graphics will be corrupted, and sometimes I won't 
get anywhere at all and just end up stuck on a black screen...

What's even more annoying is that it's not just the editor, it also 
applies to things I or other people have written in AMOS or AMOS Pro, 
which undergo the same frustrating sometimes work, sometimes don't.

Maybe it's a problem with my memory board, but then it seems bizarre that 
AMOS is the only thing that doesn't like it, and everything else works fine!

Still, what is nice to know is that this isn't a problem everyone has, so 
if I can manage to finish my current lovely project, then other people 
will be able to run it without problems : )

Thanks for the feedback... it's ver much appreciated : )

bye for now.... John

P.s. why can I not access that lovely dragonfire.net website any more??

I'm using AmosPro 2.0, but the problem is it's not just the editor that 
crashes, if I compile something and try to run that it sometimes crashes 
too, although it's >>usually<< ok when compiled. So this applies to ANY 
programs anyone has written in any version of Amos, which is of course a 
pain.

Nope, nothing else that I've tried is crashing, only things AMOS related. 
But I do think it is a problem with my memory board, it makes sense if 
no-one else is experiencing the same problem with similar 
configurations.... ah well

Um, I have added one or two things, like popup menus and stuff... so I'll 
give it a go removing that, but then having said that I've tried booting 
up with no startup-sequence and going via the CLI, and whilst just about 
always this works, on one or two highly frustrating occassions it still 
crashes! It seems like I can't win!

> some of this might help you though!

Yup, I'll go away and try some of what you said....thanks very much!!

And like I said elsewhere, it's nice to know that not everyone is 
experiencing these problems, so when I'm finally finished with my AMOS 
project other people will be able to use it : )

Yeah, I have the same set up as you and I'm experiencing the same problems.
Everything freezes, right? Some days it works, some days it doesn't!! It does
happen with 1 or 2 other programs but AMOS progs seem to be it's favourite
to crash. ;-)

I've had it like this since January 96, and although it's occasionally
frustrating, you learn to cope. ;-)

I think it's caused by the power drain of the memory board and hd. I *think*
anyway. You may need a new power supply, but I'm not sure...

I am winding up on my new raycasting game, The Hunt is On.  A few more 
levels in the shareware episode, a few more textures, and some neat intro 
pictures, and it'll be ready to go.

Why is this one so cool?  EHB graphics, meaning 64 colors of 
texture-mapped and scaled graphics.  I figured out how to add sprites 
into the game, so there are finally things to shoot.  I've sped up the 
algorithm, adding half-walls [they look ike shelves], and making it so 
you can shut off texture-mapping so even those of us with 68000s can 
play...in a very ugly-looking environment.  However, I beefed up the 
raycaster, and those with fast raycasters can get very good-looking  
environments.  Right now, there are only two weapons-a pistol and a 
shotgun (Doom, anyone?).  It probably won't be up on Aminet until the end 
of the month, due to my new job (which will fund my accelerator upgrade), 
but it will be there soon.  Write back with any input you have.  Thanks.

Hi, I might be getting a 3000 system and I was wondering if Amos 1.3 is 
going to work on it....I'm not sure about the 030 giving it any 
problems.  If it doesn't then what about Amos Pro?

    AFAIK, it should be OK.  Amos and AmosPro both work with no AGA, which
seems to cause the most problems & the A3000 uses ECS so that should be OK.  I
can't see the 030 giving it too many problems.
    I can't see any problems, but I'm not 100% sure.  Sorry to be so vague,
but I hope it helps.

BTW - Congrats on getting an A3000 - good machines!  I am envious!

Hellow folx!

I am a 22 year old boy that want to create a good Music disk/Diskmag
for the Amiga, but i am to stupid to manage it all by myselves so
here is your Chance to help a fella Scener and also get some credits
in the final prod.

Here is what i need help with:

I use AmosPro only!


A source to encrypt Ascii files so no one can read them right from
the disk.
And a source to decrypt and load the Ascii text in the Musicdisk/Mag.
The encrypted text must be a external file that Amos loads in.
Some way to pack the encrypted file would also be nice.

A way to play powerPacked modules from AmosPro.

I find the Module player in AmosPro to be bad, there is some
problems with the filter and Led on/off dos not seem to help.
So is there a Player update or is it some library i can use witch
plays the modules perfectly from AmosPro??

Oki and some other Amos questions:

What abouth the AGA update where is it??


Why wount Amos 3D work??
It fails right before the 3D editor is finnished with the loading???
Will there ever bee a 3D update.


I'll be happy for help on diz questons

Both Amos 1.35 and AmosPro 2.0 works on my 1200 at least (with an '30
runningat 50 Mhz) so it should run.

Ok, thanks to all of thoses who responded. It proves that there may still
be a future for the old amiga out there yet.

Heres my code that I'm having trouble with. I can't seem to get the
movement of the ship correct. It doesn't move in the correct direction when
thrust is applied. 
Please attempt to see what is wrong. I'm willing to send the rest of my
code, 3D engine, editor, etc if enough people seem interested in working on
this project.
I'd like to get every one on this list working on it - a group effort. We
could make a great game and show what amos is capable of.

 Hello to all extension programmers!
         I finally thought I might as well learn how to program an extension, so
 i tried to write myself a plot routine.  It doesn't work.  If antone knows
 how to do this, then please tell me!!!
 Here is my code :


 ;       RJsr    L_GetEc
 ; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ;     Get screen address: In: D0.l= number, Out: A0=address
 ;

 L_MYPLOT      equ     3
 L3    move.l  #0,d0           ; Screen number into d0

       Rjsr    L_GetEc         ; Get screen address, in a0

       move.l  (a3)+,d3        ; Get Colour
       move.l  (a3)+,d0        ; Get Parameter Y
       move.l  (a3)+,d2        ; Get Parameter X

       move.w  d0,d4           ; We need Y multiplied by 40
       lsl.w   #2,d0           ; Multiply by 4
       add.w   d4,d0           ; Add it again (making it x5)
       lsl.w   #3,d0           ; And multiply by 8.  Yey!

       move.w  d2,d4           ; Backup X for later
       lsr.w   #3,d2           ; Divide X by 8
       add.l   d2,d0           ; Add X to Y

       and     #7,d4           ; Mask out highest 6 bits
       subq    #7,d4           ; Invert bits
       bset    d4,(a0,d0)      ; And plot the point!

       rts

 But all I get is an Illegal Function Call when I do my plot 10,10,1 (this
 dissappears when I comment out the RJsr L_GetEC line)

 (I know the colour part does't do anything, I want to get this working first...)

 Thanks for any help.

I've got an A1200 with a 50MHz 68030 and 68882, and I have no problems with
either AMOS or AMOS Pro.

So it should definately work on your A3000.

Ok, heres some soure code for the old game of asteroids. It uses amal, so
when it's compiled, it screws up badly. Try to compile it to see what I
mean.
Anyone feel like converting the amal to normal bob commands......

Hi, guys!

I have a problem with the AMOSPro Interface language and I
wondered if anyone of you can solve the problem.

Here is the Interface section :

Hi!

Good! :)

>i tried to write myself a plot routine.  It doesn't work.  If antone knows

>Here is my code :


 ;       RJsr    L_GetEc

 ;     Get screen address: In: D0.l= number, Out: A0=address

This is the error! You must pass the screen number in D1 and not in D0. The
documentation is bugged like Amos!! :-)

ATTENTION!! L_GetEc returns the Amos Screen Structure address and not the
screen address! It's the equivalent of the Amos Screen Base instruction.

Why you don't use the graphics.library WritePixel function??? It's fast and
your code will be shorter!! You can obtain the Rastport address of the current
screen here:

          move.l    T_RastPort(a5),a0   ; Current RastPort address

. and here the graphics.library base:

          move.l    T_GfxBase(a5),a6    ; Graphics.library base

> But all I get is an Illegal Function Call when I do my plot 10,10,1 (this
> dissappears when I comment out the RJsr L_GetEC line)

.because you pass the parameter in the wrong register.

> Thanks for any help.

No problem :-)

Hellow Fella Amos Users!

It's me again with some more Questions.


AmosPRO Only:

When i load in my copiler i get the fileselector with this messy on the top:

Cannot load config file
Please schoose another one.

Then i click my way into AmosPro directory and cliks on a file called
Compiler config and the Compiler loads in.

Why da hell dont it find that file the first time??
Anyone know a way around this??

Oki, some of ya ansvered me on the questons conserning the music disk witch
i wanted to make and i got some mixed answers but none that really worked.
From last time i have Managed to Install Amos Craft and Ldos so using
Power packer is no problem anymore.

But some one also said that i should download Amcaf from:
src.doc.ic.ac.uk but i had to give up that coz i only got abouth 80cps
and i got a 19200 connect to my modem pool.
Well i read the text file and if i'am not wrong i cant compile code with
Amcaf unregistred anyway so that's no help.

Oki, once again here is what i need (credits will be given)

* a source for crypting a standard Ascii file to unreadable text
  and saving it to a external file.

* A source to load in the external crypted file and decrypt it back to
  normal Ascii text.

* A extension that plays the modules from Amos Bether than the crappy one
  in Amos.


Oki, cum on and help me.

     Credits will be given..

Hi everyone:

Anyone had problems getting the source coded Darryl has posted? I don't know
if it is a problem of my mail reader or because the size of the post is very
large, and the list can't manage.

If someone else had this problem, please Darryl, put your code in your WEB
page, so, perhaps, other people can help you. And please, continue developing
for the Amiga.

Another question, the Andy's WEB page is still running?

There isn't. Hires is limited to 16 colors unless you have an AGA-machine
but even if you do own an CD32/A1200/A4000 it won't do you any good since
AMOS doesn't support AGA.

Yes, I also had this problem.  It said that there was no End found or 
something.  I agree Darryl, you should put your code on your web page.

Sorry morten, it's a sad fact that if you only have ECS you can only use 
16 colours on Hires screen.  

One thing I can suggest, which will probably not solve your problem, is 
to open two 640x128 screens, each with 16 colours, one above the other.  
At least then the two screens can have two different palettes.  Sorry, I 
know this doesn't solve your problem.

A few people have had problems with it being cut off. I'll post it in ascii
form this weekend, and then only uuencode the banks, which I'll send in a
seperate message. All you have to do is load the banks into the programs.

Due to all the positive feed back I've received, I'll continue with the old
amiga. Gosh darn!

 AA> Another question, the Andy's WEB page is still running?

His server (Dragonfire) is offline at the moment. My page is also on his
server, so it's also down :-( It should be back soon... I'll let everyone
know when they come back online.

Hello,

 a> They were both corrupted at this end.  Can you send them direct to me

or

How could he send them without uuencoding them? He could use Ascii format,
but what about the sprite banks present in the programs.

I think he could get a better uuencoder (or learn to use its own) and then
send again.

Ok, a few people have said that the uuencoded program arrived short or
corrupted. This time I'm sending it as two posts. The first, this one, is
an ascii text of the program. Load it into the amos editor using merge
ascii from the pull down menus. The second mail is the bank (sw.abk). It is
lha'ed then uuencoded. Hopefully this smaller file will make it thru
uncorrupted.
UUdecode the bank, then lz x it, and save it to ram. The program will find
it there.

The problem it that the ship does not move correctly at angles. Play with
it a while and you'll see what I mean.

Well, I'm not sure about, but AMCAF extension has an example to show an AGA
picture with 256 colours: probably it can also display Hires with 64

colours!

You have to get it and test it.

If you are interested I have a complete diskmag-source that I've made earlier,
but don't use. It doesn't have the articles in one big file outside Amos, but
inside the source, so editing the articles is an ungreatful task. If you want,
I can send you an executable so you can see how it is.

The AMCAF-extension is nice for this. It plays CIA-timed modules perfectly.

>Oki and some other Amos questions:
>What abouth the AGA update where is it??
Doesn't exist. There are some extensions avaiable that lets you open
intuition-screens so you can use AGA.

>Will there ever bee a 3D update.
You'll need a version that came with a Amiga-magazine some time ago. This
version should work fine.

X-Status: 

OK, I looked at the source code for spacewar. I think the problem was that
values less than 0 were being added to an integer. AMOS rounded the float
down to 0 and so no movement was made.

Anyway, I rewrote it, using integers and here it is (requires sw.abk from
previous version) :


Degree 

' Load bob images if needed
If Length(1)=0 Then Load "sw.abk"

' Open new screen
Screen Open 0,320,200,8,Lowres
Screen Display 0,128,37,320,200
Flash Off : Curs Off : Cls 0
Hide On 
Double Buffer 
Get Bob Palette 

' Predefine all angles and store in an integer array for extra speed 
Dim FSIN(31),FCOS(31)
For A=0 To 31
   ANGLE#=A*(360.0/32.0)
   ' Strange organisation of bob images in bank, so these formulas are a
   ' bit strange (ie cos is negative) 
   FSIN(A)=Sin(ANGLE#)*256 : FCOS(A)=-Cos(ANGLE#)*256
Next A

' A few default values 
' Position of ship is multiplied by 256 to keep it as an integer so it's 
' faster than using a float
XSHIP=(Screen Width/2)*256 : YSHIP=(Screen Height/2)*256
XSPD=0 : YSPD=0 : ANGLE=0 : BOOST=0

' SHIP=0 for Star Destroyer
' SHIP=1 for Enterprise
SHIP=0

Repeat 

   ' Accelerate 
   If Jup(1)
      ' Increase acceleration factors
      Add XSPD,FSIN(ANGLE)
      Add YSPD,FCOS(ANGLE)
      ' Put booster on 
      BOOST=32
   Else 
      ' Turn booster off 
      BOOST=0
   End If 

   ' Rotate the right way depending on if left or right is pressed on joystick
   Add ANGLE,Jleft(1)-Jright(1),0 To 31

   ' Add speed to ship and loop around screen edges 
   Add XSHIP,XSPD,0 To Screen Width*256
   Add YSHIP,YSPD,0 To Screen Height*256

   ' Slow down ship (same as multiplying the speed by 4/5 but faster) 
   XSPD=(4*XSPD)/5 : YSPD=(4*YSPD)/5

   ' Update bob 
   Bob 0,XSHIP/256,YSHIP/256,SHIP*64+BOOST+ANGLE+1
   Wait Vbl 

' Until ESCAPE is pressed
Until Key State(69)


Hope that helps!

Okay, anyone knows if the powerbobs extension's got any problems with AGA
and/or accellerator boards? AMOS Pro 2.0 has started to behave very weird
since I installed this extension, sometimes it will freeze completely or
it will make the machine do a reset (a guru I think, but the flashing red
box never appears) and at other times it works beutifully. And it doesn't
matter if I have used some powerbob-commands or not.

My configuation is: A1200, 2+8 meg, Blizzard1230-III.

The prepareemul program for Shapeshifter is running too, if it's the VBR
beeing moved that's causing the problems.

Powerbobs is version 1.0 (I don't know if there's any more recent
version).

Thanks for any help I might get.
