@Node "Req" "Requirements"

Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 BobClip requires                   BobClip take use of

 o 68000+ processor                 o Extra Chip mem
 o Kickstart 1.3+                   o Fast mem
 o 512 KB Chip                      o Harddrive
 o Mouse

 The unregistered version of BobClip contains only ONE limitation, but a 
 very serious one: 
 @{i}- You can not save a memory bank created with this program.@{ui}

 To find out how to be able to save your work, please read the @{" register " Link Reg}
 section.

 BobClip only supports standard ILBM (Iff) files at this time using the 
 following screen formats:

             PAL                                   NTSC
 
   Width     Height     Colors           Width     Height     Colors
   ============================          ============================
   320       256        2-64             320       200        2-64
   320       512        2-64             320       400        2-64
   640       256        2-16             640       200        2-16
   640       512        2-16             640       400        2-16
 

 The 64 color mode is actually 32 color EHB (Extra Half Bright) mode.
 EHB mode takes half the brightness of color 0-31 and copies it to color
 32-63 making it 64 colors. 

 I did not manage to fix the HAM-detect routine, so HAM pictures will be 
 loaded in 32 color EHB instead of 4096 colors for now.

@Node "Intro" "Introduction"

Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 BobClip is a very system friendly as well as user friendly program.
 It has been created specially for Amos programmers to save valuable time
 when it comes to cutting out those bobs for your games and utilities.
 
 Using BobClip you can easily cut out bobs (sprites) into a special memory
 bank which then can be saved on to your harddrive and loaded into memory 
 from within your own program. 
 Simply load your saved bank into memory bank #1 and you're all set to go.
 Now you can display your bobs using commands like Bob n,x,y,i and Paste
 bob x,y,i. The bobs will automatically be taken from bank #1. 

 To be able to use BobClip in conjuntion with other programming languages 
 such as Assembler, C++, C, Amiga E and Blitz Basic, you will need to know 
 how Amos sprite files are build up. (Not provided in this document).

 BobClip has been tested on an Amiga 1200/030 with 2MB Chip, 4 MB Fast and
 an Amiga 600 with 2MB Chip.

@Node "Inter" "Interface"

Interface
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 BobClip is controlled by using the mouse on the screen and in the menus.
 There is also keyboard shortcuts for nearly every option in the menus.

 To cut out a bob on screen you first need to load a picture. This is done
 by holding down the right mouse button, selecting the 'Picture' menu option
 and then the 'Load' option (from the menu of course :)
 (this could be done by pressing the 'F1' key as well)

 Select a file and press 'ok'. The selected file is now loaded and buffered
 (for fast and easy access later on)

 Now, to cut out a bob press down and hold the left mouse button on a 
 desired place on screen. 
 To determine the width and height of the bob you are about to cut out, move 
 the mouse in any direction while still holding down the left mouse button.
 A border will be drawn from where you first pressed down the left mouse
 button and the current mouse position.
 When releasing the left mouse button, the bob will be cut out within the 
 area of the borders.

 Cutting out bob's like this repeatedly will create a bob bank for you which,
 if you are a @{" registered " Link Reg} user, can be saved onto disk and loaded into your
 own programs very easily.

 To view or animate your cut out bobs and to learn about all the other 
 features in BobClip, please read the sections under the @{" Main " Link MMenu}, @{" View " Link VMenu}
 and @{" Animation " Link AMenu} menu.
                  
 To flip between BobClip and Workbench, use Left-Amiga-M.

@EndNode

@Node "MMenu" "Main menu"

Main Menu
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Everytime you start BobClip you will be taken directly to the Main menu.
 On the main menu the BobClip version is displayed at the left followed by
 the current bob number 'Bob# x'
 The bob number specifies the number of the bob you will cut out next.
 For example, if it says 'Bob# 47' it means you have cut out 46 bob's and
 the next time you cut out a bob it will be bob number 47.

 To the right of the bob number your preferences will be displayed.
 For more information on these preferences, read the 'prefs' section further
 down on this page.

 A - Next bob auto.
 B - Cut bob +border
 M - Marker on.
 V - Verify on.

 If you have coords on, the coordinates of the mouse pointer will be 
 displayed to the right of the preferences.

 Shortcuts to all menu options are in brackets ()
 Shortcuts are NOT case sensitive.

@Node "VMenu" "View menu"

View menu
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the View menu you can view (!) all the bob's in the bank to see that they
 are ok (looks ok). It's also useful to step back or forward in the bank to
 the bob you want to go to, and be able to see just that bob at the same time

@Node "AMenu" "Animation menu"

Animation menu
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The first time you enter the animation menu a requester will appear asking 
 you to type in the First and Last frame to be animated and the frame speed.
 For more information, please read the 'Settings' section below.

 Once you have been in the animation menu, the requster will NOT appear every
 time you enter the animation menu afterwards.

 Shortcuts to all menu options are in brackets ()
 Shortcuts are NOT case sensitive.


@{" Animation  " NoLink}

   Settings (1)  - A requester will appear asking you to type in the First 
                   and Last frame to be animated and the frame speed. The 
                   frames correspond to the bob numbers in the bank and the 
                   frame speed is the delay in 50:th of a second between each 
                   frame.
                   For example, typing in 5, 25 and 4 would animate bob 
                   numbers 5 trough 25 with a delay of 4/50:th of a second 
                   between each bob (4/50 = 0.08 sec).

                   where you were when you entered the View menu).

@{" BG Colour  " NoLink}
 
   Increase (up arrow)   - Increases the BackGround colour on which the 
                           bob's are displayed.

@Node "Example" "Examples"

Examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The 'Examples' directory contain the following files:
 
  o Example.abk  - An example file on how the bobs in a banks created with
                   BobClip looks like. Try to load it in BobClip!
  o Example.amos - An example file on how to use a bank created with BobClip.
  o Example.iff  - The image used to create the 'Example.abk' bank.

 
@{" Example.abk " NoLink}

  You can use this file to load into BobClip and see how a bank created
  with this program looks like. To do this, just load the bank and go into
  the view menu.
  To animate the bank, load the bank and then go into the animation menu.
  When the requester comes up asking you to type in first and last frame
  and frame speed, type in 1,13 and 14.


@{" Example.amos " NoLink}

  Simply load the file in amos and run it! You can examine the code to see
  how easy it is to use the banks once you have created them.


@{" Example.iff " NoLink}

  This file could be used to experiment on the functions in BobClip.
  Here are some examples:

  @{" Cut bob +/- border " NoLink}

   You can see the difference in using the 'cut bob +border' option compared
   to the 'cut bob -border' option found in the @{" Main menu " Link MMenu} under 'prefs'.
   Try them both and cut out a bob placing the crosshair on the box 
   surrounding the bob.

  @{" Multicut " NoLink}
   
   When you choose multicut and the requester asking for columns and rows
   appears, enter the values 5 and 2. This will cut out the bobs in the first
   two rows. To get the remaining three bobs, choose multicut again and enter
   the values 3 and 1 (or you could cut them out one by one as well).
   You can now view these bobs from the @{" View menu " Link VMenu} or
   animate them from the @{" Animation menu " Link AMenu}.

  I think these are the most important functions to understand in order to 
  get the most out of BobClip, so I'll leave the rest up to you to experiment
  with.
