        Due to the large numbers of orders I have received for Mushroom
    disks, I have decided to reduce some of my disk prices. Hopefully, you 
    will like the reduced prices too !!
    
ý
                For a 1-disk program, it will now cost you 60p
                   For a 2-disk program, it will cost £1.20
           For every disk over the first 10, it will cost 50 pence

                 The same also goes for the source code disks
    
        Remember, for every disk of AMOS programs that you send in, you 
    can exchange it for a disk full of source code, or a Mushroom disk 
    out of the library list that uses the same number of disks as you sent
    with stuff on. For more information, or any questions that you might 
    have, you can reach me at this address :
