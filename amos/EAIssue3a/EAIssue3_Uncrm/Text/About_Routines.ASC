                                About Routines
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
þ
        The procedures and routines listed in this section, are designed
    to help make your AMOS life easier. Each routine has been explained in
    the best way that the programmer can do so, and to provide you with as
    many examples as he/she feels necessary.
    
        If you have an excellent AMOS routine or procedure, then why not
    document it and send it to me at the below address. Remember, the
    first issue that I include your article in, you will receive for FREE.

    Meanwhile, on this month's issue of Extreme AMOS, we have several

    different routines which you may or may not find usefull. These
    include a selection of executable routines, which basically show off
    AMOS a little bit. This issue, we have :

        All of this issue's routines were written and coded by me, Andrew
    "Mushroom" Kellett. Any source code mentioned in any routine or
    tutorial can be found in the Source drawer on disk 2.
    
        If you have an interesting routine that you have documented, or
    would just like to show it off without including the source code just
    yet, then the address to send it to is at the beginning of this
    document. The first issue your work appears in, you will receive a
    FREE copy of the edition.
    
        Do you want to get in touch with other AMOS contacts, then why not
    get in touch with me, and I shall put your name and address in either
    the pen-pals, or the Programmers section, or both, depending on what
    you want. Remember to include some articles on a disk.
