                              Encrypter Routine
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ù
        So what exactly does an encrypter routine do? Well, basically it
    disguises one piece of code into another, so that when it is read into
    a binary editor, or a word processor, then you would produce some
    strange effects on-screen, yet when untangled with the right
    procedure, it will come out of the other end perfectly entact.
    
þ
        There are several different kinds of encrypter used. The first,
    and maybe the most difficult, is for the computer to recognise certain
    words and phrases in the text, and replace them with a combination of
    characters, which may not be true ASCII. This can also be called a
    cruncher, but we are not discussing that particular subject. A more
    easier kind of encrypter, is to simply swap the values of each
    character around. This is an extremely simple task, and can fool
    anybody for a brief amount of time, unless you know the text is
    encrypted, and you are trying to uncrunch it. This is done by creating
    a table of possible characters, up to 255, and assigning them with a
    number up to 255, so that each of the different characters have a
    different number, but not necesarilly in order. Your list could look a
ÿ
þ
    bit like this :
    
    
û
                                    A = 4
                                   B = 200
                                    C = 19
                                 D = 128 Etc.
    
    
þ
        If you are using just a few letters of the alphabet, or maybe all
    the letters and numbers, then you could always assign more than one
    number to a particular letter, to make unpacking even more complicated
    unless you have the right program to uncrunch it with.
    
    
ý
        One simple way of crunching a piece of text, is if you type out an
    AMOS program similar to the one below, remembering that the below
    version is only a brief example of how the system works. The easiest
    method to encrypt is :
    
ÿ
û
        ' Quick Encryption program.
    
        ' This program will only encrypt 9 letters of any piece of text.
        ' These are a-h, and CHR$(10), a character string VITAL to the
        ' ASCII System. Characters are in lower case.
    
        Do
           F$=Fsel$("","","Select the SOURCE file","to Encrypt")
           G$=Fsel$("","","Select DEST file")
    
           Open In 1,F$ : Reserve As Data 10,Lof(1)
           Reserve As Data 11,Lof(1)
           Close : Bload F$,10 : Rem Load in all of source file
    
           ' Now for the Loop
    
           LE=0
    
           Repeat
              P=Peek(Start(10)+LE)
ÿ
û
              If P>96 and P<105
                 If P=97 : CHAR=2 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=98 : CHAR=5 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=99 : CHAR=1 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=100 : CHAR=4 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=101 : CHAR=3 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=102 : CHAR=8 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=103 : CHAR=6 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=104 : CHAR=7 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
              Else
                 CHAR=P
              End If
    
              If P=10 : CHAR=252 : Print "Changed CHR$(10)" : End If
    
              Poke Start(11)+LE,CHAR
              Inc LE
           Until LE>Length(10)
    
           Bsave G$,Start(11) To Start(11)+Length(11)
ÿ
û
           Erase 10 : Erase 11 : Cls
        Loop
    
þ
        The above program is only a simple version, and will only encrypt
    the letters a - h, along with CHR$(10), a character extremely vital to
    the working of ASCII. With this character disabled, the text viewer
    will place all characters onto one line. Remeber, that the encrypter
    is case sensitive, and you will have to change the values for the
    upper and lower case versions.
    
ý
        To un-encrypt the program, simply change the IF... ENDIF
    statements around to read :
    
û
           Repeat
              P=Peek(Start(10)+LE)
              If P>0 and P<9
                 If P=2 : CHAR=97 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=5 : CHAR=98 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=1 : CHAR=99 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=4 : CHAR=100 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
ÿ
û
                 If P=3 : CHAR=101 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=8 : CHAR=102 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=6 : CHAR=103 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
                 If P=7 : CHAR=104 : Print "Changed Value" : End If
              Else
                 CHAR=P
              End If
    
              If P=252 : CHAR=10 : Print "Changed CHR$(10)" : End If
    
              Poke Start(11)+LE,CHAR
              Inc LE
           Until LE>Length(10)

        One problem which you might encounter using this system, is the
    fact that the computer will try to change the wrong kind of
    characters, hence the need to account for ALL possible characters. For
    example, in the above programs I have only used a limited number of
    codes, so if a CHR$(5) is found for example, in the decryption, it
    will be changed to the value that CHR$(5) should be, even though the
ÿ
ú
    decrypter didn't change it in the first place.
    
ø
        Well, I think that is all I can tell you really, apart from the
    fact that I will create a demonstration program to crunch a text file,
    using the characters a-z and A-Z, and I shall leave you with the
    challenge of creating the decrypter !!
    
ü
        Happy AMOS-ing, and if you wish me to cover other subjects, such
    as multi-encryption, then why not drop me a line at the Mushroom PD
    address with a letter demanding I do so !!
