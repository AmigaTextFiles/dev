        There has not been all that much happening in the AMOS world, but
    I will try and cover as many things as I can. The main important
    change of this issue, is the fact that Carl Drinkwater is no longer a
    member of the Extreme AMOS team. He has failed to send me a single
    item to contribute to EA, and won't even get in touch with me to come
    to some arrangement. After the warning in the last issue, he still did
    not get in touch, so I feel that he is no longer a member of the team.
    If you are reading this Carl, then get in touch with me soon if you
    want this to change. The official EA address is the same as the
    Mushroom PD address. In case you are unsure of it, here it is :

        And now, for the rest of the news methinks! Something here may be
    of interest to you. If not, then go onto the next part !!

     *  Extreme AMOS has now gone full-colour, both in the ability of
        displaying text, and now able to show IFF pictures from within a
        piece of text. I have not had time to develop the routine, but by
        the next issue I should be able to have graphics and text on the
        same screen without any problems. Any ideas or suggestions that
        you have that you think would improve the engine are very welcome,
        and should be placed on the questionairre. PD disks are now 60p.
    
    
     *  WAC (Whitby AMOS Club) run by Paul Gumsley (check out adverts) is
        now licenseware. It has been enlisted by 5th Dimension PD, and all
        future copies must be obtained from there. Check out the adverts
        section for more information. Any issues under issue 7 can be
        obtained from Paul, including several Shareware issues. For more
        information, send a disk and SAE to this address, making sure you
        say that Mushroom sent you:

        Paul has managed to remove some nasty bugs from his engine, which
        will now allow it to work on an A500/A600 without any problems at
        all.
    
        WAC was also reviewed in the April edition of Amiga Shopper, where
        it was awarded a rather good 80%.
    
    
     *  A new PD library is being set up by a friend of mine. It is called
        ZZG-PD, and caters for all Amiga programs and languages. Prices
        of disks range from around 60-95p depending on the number that you
        order. He is also thinking of setting up a licenseware scheme. For
        more information, send SAE and a good disk for a catalogue list
        to this address :

        As he is just setting up, it may take a small while for you to
        receive your catalogue disk, but don't stress. Most PD titles are
        available, including the Assassins disks.
