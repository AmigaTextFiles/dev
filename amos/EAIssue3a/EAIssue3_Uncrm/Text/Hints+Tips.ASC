                             AMOS Hints and Tips
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
þ
    Many programmers that write software in the popular language do try
    their hardest to hide the fact that their creation was coded in Amos.
    
ú
    There are many techniques that help you to disguise your program,
    whether it's a game or utility; that it was coded in Amos.
    
ý
    Well, first impressions do tend to count quite highly, and if the
    Amos logo appears or you notice the default Amos arrow appear, it does
    put some people off from judging the program fairly.
    
÷
    So, let's get in there with some tips...
    
û
    1) When you compile your program as an executable, turn off the
       "Create Default Screen" option. This will prevent the red screen
       flickering at the beginning of your program. Don't forget though
       that you will then have to begin your code by opening a screen.
    
    
ÿ
û
    2) Use the "Break Off" command at the start of your coding which will
       prevent people using the Ctrl+C keys to break into your famous
       (Well maybe) creation.
    
    3) Use "Amos Lock" at the start of your code; this will prevent
       Multitasking with the Amiga + A Keys.
    
    4) Don't forget to use "Hide" at the start of your program (again!) to
       prevent the Amos arrow from appearing.
    
    5) If you insist on using the Amos default arrow (Amos Pro) then use
       the palette of:
    
ú
       Palette ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$0,$f33,$fff
    
ý
       This will adapt the colours to the Workbench arrow.
    
û
       If you're still a user of Amos Classic, then you'll have to
       upgrade your version !
    
ÿ
û
    6) If you don't require the use of your mouse, keyboard + Drives; turn
       off the operating system before the command "Do", but don't forget
       to turn it back on if you need to access a disk or keyboard.
    
ú
       Turning off the Operating System, speeds up your Amos programs and
       prevents your external disk drives from constantly clicking.
    
       You can do this with the Multi Yes/No commands from an extension
       such as Turbo_Plus or if you don't have the extension, use:
    
þ
       FE=Execall(-132)      Turn Off system
       FE=Execall(-138)      Turn On system
    
û
    7) If you use an executable cruncher to cut down the size of your
       program (after compiled - obviously!) this will prevent people
       using Binary Hackers (Sorry - Editors) to find the Amos.Library in
       your code.
    
    
    
ÿ
û
    8) If You use the Amos Professional Compiler, Turn the "Include
       Amos.Library in Code" to the "On" selection, so that you don't need
       the external library floating around on disk.
    
    9) When saving Banks to disks, don't use the extention .Abk, use
       something like .Dat.
    
       This won't effect your program at all, but just hide the fact that
       you are using Amos banks.

        Some good tips there from our friend Asa. Now, some more tips
    which maybe someone out there will find usefull.
    
û
     1) Try and avoid using Resource banks (AMOSPro) if possible,
        especially when multitasking the program. Try and come up with a
        similar DRAW routine, as they can sometimes crash quite horribly,
        especially when something else is taking all of the processor time
        whilst they are being drawn.
    
    
ÿ
û
     2) Instead of having large Icon banks, why not save the images to a
        screen and SPack it into memory. This reduces the size of the
        file, plus it will crunch down even further when you crunch the
        executable with something like stonecracker.
    
     3) If you use an A1200, avoid compiling your programs with an icon
        bank in memory, as I have heard this causes nasty errors for
        machines under WB3.
    
     4) Avoid using the commands in the Turbo extension, when compiling
        with AMOSPro compiler. When you leave the program, it causes a
        Suspend/Reboot message. Hence why I compiled this issue in Classic
        Compiler, which has no problems at all, and is faster than AMOSPro
        in certain areas.
    
     
    
    
    
    
ÿ
û
     5) If you use the Classic Compiler, and the program you are compiling
        requires the use of the current drawer (displayed when you type in
        CD on CLI), then make sure you turn "RUN CLI PROGRAM IN
        BACKGROUND" to OFF, as for some reason, when turned on, it always
        sets the dir to SYS: when called from a different partition in CLI
        command mode.
    
     6) Don't use the SQUASH functions in either of the compiler programs.
        In AMOSPro, it is heavily bugged, more bugged in fact than the
        Amazon rainforest. In classic AMOS, it ain't very powerfull. You
        are best off using an executable cruncher such as Stonecracker or
        Crunchmania.
    
     7) NEVER delete the .Bak file of your latest AMOS project, until you
        know you have backed up the original. Ahem, I speak from
        knowledge!

þ
        Well, I'm afraid that is all that I can think of. If you have any
    really good tips that you would like to contribute to the section, or
    have any kind of questions you want answering, then you know where you
    can get in touch with me !!
