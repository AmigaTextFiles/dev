        Are you an AMOS coder who is just dying for someone to write to,
    to exchange ideas, programming tips, source code etc? If the answer
    is yes, then this is the section for you !!
    
ý
        The names and addresses which appear in this section, have been
    approved by the people who entered them, so you are guaranteed a
    definate reply from them. You can submit your own adress to, by
    sending it to me in ASCII format, along with a couple of AMOS
    articles, or some programs you have written. The address is scattered
    around various sections of the magazine. You can also include an IFF
    version of your message, as long as it is 320x200, and uses no more
    than 32 colours.

        OK then, because this is the first release of this article, there
    won't be too many names and addresses in here, so don't be put off by
    the fact. If you are a user group for AMOS, then why not send in your
    details !!
