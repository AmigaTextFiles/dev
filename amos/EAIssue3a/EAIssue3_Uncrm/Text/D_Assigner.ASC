                                Assigner Diary
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ý
        Do you have loads and loads of ASSIGN commands in either your
    user-startup, or startup-sequence files? Would you like to eliminate
    them all from the files, and call them all using one program - well
    now you can !!
    
ø
        Included in the source code section of disk 2, is a program that I
    wrote called ASSIGNER.AMOS, which will do just that when compiled. If
    you do not have the compiler, then the executable version is also on
    disk 2 in the C: drawer, under the name ASSIGNER.
    
þ
        The program works, by first, the user creating a second startup
    file in the S: drawer of their bootup disk named Assign_List.ASC. In
    this list, are all the assigns which you wish to make. If an assign is
    called, and cannot be made, then it is missed, and skipped onto the
    next one in the list.
    
    
    
ÿ
ý
        Assign values must be made in the below format. A standard word
    processor can be used, and examples must be entered in this way:
    
û
     Music:
     Work:Music/
     Extreme_AMOS:
     Library:Magazines/Extreme_AMOS/
     etc.
÷
     EOF
    
ú
        It is vital that the EOF is placed directly after the path of the
    last assign, and you must press ENTER after it, otherwise AMOS will
    return with an "End of file" error.
