                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~

        Have you ever written an AMOS program that requires a font from
    the disk, but when you are a HD user, for example, have to wait ages
    and ages whilst the computer looks through, and examines hundreds of
    fonts, whilst the program could be carrying on with something else?
    Well hopefully, you will be able to take care of this problem using
    the help and advice that I will be giving you in this little doc.

        This magazine boots with a fast-font maker. What it does, is
    change the assign value of FONTS:, to a totally new location, where 
    only the fonts for the magazine are neede, and so saves a lot of time 
    with the GET FONTS command. In order to preserve true valus, I take a
    reading of the original FONTS: path, and store it in memory so that I
    can re-assign it after all the necessary fonts have been read.
    
ù
        To give you a small idea of what I am actually waffling on about,
    I shall explain exactly how I made the program work. When the program
    boots, I set the default path to the FONTS: drawer using DIR$, and
    store the value in memory. The true path will be stored in memory, not
ÿ
ù
    just the FONTS: that I assigned it. Now I have changed the path back
    to what it was when I booted up, and changed the FONTS: drawer to the
    cuurent path's FONTS drawer, where everything for the magazine is
    currently stored. Now I call GET FONTS, and change the original FONTS:
    setting back to normal, so that if the program quits, or is
    multitasking, then it will all call to the original FONTS: volume.
    Here is a simple program to demonstrate what I mean :
    
û
          A$=Dir$ : Rem Boot Path
          Dir$="Fonts:" : B$=Dir$ : Rem Get Fonts Path
          Dir$=A$ : Rem Change path back.
          Assign "FONTS:" to A$+"/Fonts/" : Rem New Fonts Drawer
          Get Fonts : Rem Retrieve the fonts list.
          Set Font (All fonts to be used) : Rem Copys Fonts needed to mem.
          Assign "FONTS:" To B$ : Rem Return it all back to normal.
    
ø
        See, dead simple! It is best that you use the SET FONT command on
    all the fonts that you need before you re-assign, as AMOS could look
    at the re-assigned original drawer, and discover it not there.
    Anyhow, once loaded into memory, they stay there until you quit out.

        Well folks, I think that is just about it for this simple little
    programming excercise. If you have any questions or queries, then why
