                             About the tutorials
                             -------------------
    
ø
        The tutorials featured in this issue, are designed for to get the
    most out of that particular covered subject, and to show you how to 
    acheive it. Often, the AMOS tutorials will also provide any source 
    code examples to allow you to load any example routines straight away. 
    Because this tutorial is for a non-AMOS program, there are no source 
    code examples, but examples are included within the file itself.
    
û
        When you use any of the AMOS tutorial example source code
    routines, it is always suggested by the tutorial author that you
    include their name somewhere in the program, preferably the credits,
    under the section "Extra Programming", or one that matches the
    external source program.
    
ý
        The magazine is always trying to get it's hands on new tutorials
    and programming diaries, and any AMOS article in general. If you have
    any of these kind of articles, and would like them published in
    Extreme AMOS, then why not send them in to me at the address given
