                            Using the Text Reader
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
þ
        Welcome to the help file for the EA text reader. Updated and
    programmed by Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett of Mushroom PD. All operations
    can be controlled via the mouse, and all page movement can also be
    controlled via the cursor keys. To exit the reader, simply click the
    left mouse button on the EXIT button.

        Firstly, I best explain what the different buttons do:
    
ø
                    NEXT PAGE - Goto next page of the file
ù
                  PREV PAGE - Goto previous page of the file
ú
                    LAST PAGE - Goto last page of the file
û
                 FIRST PAGE - Goto the first page of the file
ü
              GOTO PAGE - Goto a user-specified page of the file
ý
             PRINT PAGE - Print out the current page (text only)
þ
              PRINT ALL - Print out entire document (text only)
÷
                           EXIT - Leave the reader
    
ÿ
þ
        You can use the mouse to click on any of the movement buttons, or
    if you can move around the pages using the cursor keys. The LEFT
    cursor key acts as PREV PAGE, the right cursor key as NEXT PAGE, the
    up cursor key as FIRST PAGE and the down cursor key as LAST PAGE. To
    exit from the reader you must click the mouse on the EXIT button, or
    if you are like me and used to using a program such as DirOpus, then
    you can click the right mouse button to exit.
    
ý
        Using GOTO PAGE you can skip as many pages as you want to, just by
    entering the page number in the file that you wish to travel to. If
    the page is valid, then it will be displayed on-screen for you to
    view.

                                   Graphics
                                   ~~~~~~~~
þ
        As well as being able to display text, the program will also draw
    graphics on the screen. These can be of any resolution that the author
    selects. They are specially packed down using a unique AMOS graphics
    compactor, written by Paul Burkey, which crunches them down even
    further than a standard SPack, but explains also the way in which they
ÿ
þ
    unpack. Once the picture is fully unpacked, it will remain on-screen
    until the mouse button has been pressed, where the picture will be
    "Cut" in order to fit into the standard viewer screen. Screens which
    unpack to NTSC size are hardly effected, but standard 256 high
    pictures tend to lose the bottom half of the picture, and take a lot
    more time to unpack if there is a lot of detail. The best screens to
    use are 320x200 with up to 64 colours, as you hardly lose any of the
    image when the buttons etc. are on-screen.
    
ú
        To limit the amount of memory used, the program will load in the
    graphics file as it needs it, so users with only 1Mb can still use the
    program properly. This also reduces the size of individual articles,
    and allows me to use the picture data in more than one article, which
    saves me from using more than one copy of any particular file.
    
þ
        If an option is called, such as PRINT or GOTO PAGE, and the screen
    is in a different resolution than the default, then the picture is
    cleared, and the screen set to the default size in order for the
    on-screen graphics to appear on the screen. This is so that the icons
    which are to be placed on the screen are in the correct size that they
ÿ
þ
    were programmed to be. Sorry if it causes an inconvinience.
    
ý
        Well, that just about covers it. If you are still having problems,
    then why not drop me a line at the Mushroom PD address, or give me a
    call. For information oh how to create your colour articles, then
    consult the article GETTING INVOLVED where everything is explained.
