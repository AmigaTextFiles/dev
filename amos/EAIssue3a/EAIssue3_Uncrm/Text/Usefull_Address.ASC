        Somewhere along the lines, you may feel that you need the help of
    someone other than myself. This following article contains some
    usefull names and addresses which you may or may not find usefull.
    They are addresses for anything from other AMOS disk magazines, to
    user groups and individual programmers. First of all, I shall give the
    official Mushroom PD and Extreme AMOS address :

      If you have an AMOS user group, or PD library, and would like for
     me to place it into this section, then send me info on the club, as
    well as some adverts for the ads section, as well as maybe a couple of
            AMOS articles. I am sure you know the address by now.

      Remember when writing to the above addresses, you say you got the
      address from Extreme AMOS, and you may get a slightly faster reply
                     depending on how busy the guys are.
