        Welcome to this small, but handy little section. Here will be
    listed the source code that has been given away on the last issues of
    Extreme AMOS, and as the issues progress, the lists will be updated.
    If I am getting a bit short of space on the disk, I shall begin
    cutting some of the earlier sections off.
