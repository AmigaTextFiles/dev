        Why, it has been such a long time since I last wrote one of these
    files, I can hardly remember which programs I mentioned last time. Ah 
    well, I shall just go through them all and point out some of the good
    ones from the PROGRAM LIST file.

        If you are still working on your programs using Classic AMOS, then
    maybe it is time you upgraded. Mushroom Disk 17 contains the Coverdisk
    version of AMOSPro, which is a heck of a lot better than the Classic
    AMOS program. It will run all AMOSPro commands, and is supplied with
    the accessories disk so that you can start producing masterpieces
    right away.

        Love to laugh at crap productions? Try loading FLEEGLE, featured
    on disk 45. A complete waste of bytes on the disk !!
    
ù
        Adventure games seem to be the in-thing, with Relics of Deldroneye
    2 coming out. The library has a few of these kind of games, including
    a demo of the first RELICS OF DELDRONEYE, Disk 18 (2Mb), and LETHAL
ÿ
ù
    FORMULA, Disk 57 (1Mb), and STARBASE 13, Disk 19 (2 Disks). All play
    relatively the same, as they were all written using the GRAC program,
    available from F1 Licencesware. Each puzzle is packed to the brim with
    stunning graphics and puzzles, which are sure to keep you going for a
    hell of a long time.

        If you saw the demo of TWINZ on the last issue, then maybe you
    would like to know that I have changed the program, in fact, I have
    totally re-written it ! Having lost the old source code whilst
    Re-Org'ing my WB partition, I never got the chance to work on the
    registered version, so I have started all over again, and added lot's
    of new features, including more levels, and tiles per level, rotating
    vectors, boards which change size with the difficulty level, plus a
    heck of a lot more. If you would like to get your hands on the latest
    demo version, then order disk 47.
    
ù
        SQUIDGER is the excellent graphics compaction routine that has
    been used in EA. It was written by Paul Burkey, and a simplified
    version is available on disk 58. On it, comes the squidger executable,
    along with several smaller programs, which allow you to view and save
ÿ
ù
    original SQG files. Also supplied, is the AMOS source code for
    unpacking the squidged pictures into your own programs. You also get
    several pre-packed SQG files to play around with.
    
û
        If you would like to entertain your friends with a bit of sick
    humour, or would like to pose some really foul-mouthed questions to
    the most shy of babes, then disk 32 is the one for you. On it, is a
    program named PURITY TESTER. In it, are sections packed with some
    really sick questions, to work out how pure you are. They start off
    simple enough, but believe me, they get worst as they go along! 18's
    only i'm afraid !!
    
ù
        How about a bit of a good earbanging session with some excellent
    music soundtracks eh? One demo which I highly recomend is the Prodigy
    - No Good Start The Dance (Mushroom disk 62) which has it's graphics
    demo written in AMOS. An excellent 600K soundtrack, with superb
    sampling, and of course, you will need at least one megabyte to have
    the pleasure of viewing it.

        Well, that's about all I can instantly see that is willing to
    appeal to anybody. If you want to get in touch with me about the
    magazine, or about Mushroom PD disks, then you know where the address
    is !!
