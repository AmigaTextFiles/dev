        This section is set to inform you of currently known projects
    underway. This is so that you don't spend days on a project, only to
    find out that someone else has also done a version. If you want your
    program information included, then send it to me at the Mushroom PD
    address, along with an article for inclusion. Here is the current list
    of programmers, and what they are doing:

      Paul Burkey
      -----------

        Paul is currently updating his AmigaGUIDE reader - Smoothguide.
    The program will now read in guides that have been crunched with
    PowerPacker, or any XPK cruncher. He has also added italics and bold,
    and speeded up the whole access of the program. The program will not
    crash on an A500/600 anymore.

        He is also working on a Wormz/Scorched tanks type game. It's
    looking very promising at the moment, with some great ideas for
    gameplay. Keep looking at this space for more information.

      Paul Gumsley
      ------------
    
ý
        Currently trying to get the WAC engine to work on an A600/A500, as
    it seems to crash horribly, rendering under WB3 users stuck,
    especially if you don't know the cruncher system. Paul is also working
    on an extractor program that is compatible with LHA, LZX, LZH, ZOO and
    probably a couple more.
    
        WAC issue number 9 will be released alongside Extreme AMOS at the
    'World of Amiga' convention in Hammersmith, London.
    
        Paul is currently updating his 'Legend of WAC' programming diary,
    and a demo version will be released also at the 'World of Amiga'
    convention.

        At this moment in time, I am writing this document for EA Issue 3.
    I have also been working on Twinz Proffessional, a fully-upgraded
    version of the old Twinz game, with a brand new engine. Check the
    review in WAC 8. I am also adding the finishing touches to MMPlay GUI,
    my own fully-usable module player. It includes commands from MMPlay
    CLI, as well as a few more goodies. Simply point and listen. A
    demonstration version will be ready by the time you read this text,
    and will probably be on the coverdisk.
    
        Other projects that I am currently trying to finish, are Cardfile,
    a small WB utility which allows you to store information on a
    person/company, and view it with ease. You can also include pictures
    (if available). I am also trying to do a simulation of the C64 hit
    Commando. It is coming on very slowly, as I can't draw the soldiers
    very well !!!
