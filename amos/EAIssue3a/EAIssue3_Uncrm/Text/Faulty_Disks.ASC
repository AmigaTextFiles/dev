        Alright, Alright, I admit it. The odd couple of disks may slip past
    me with a read/write error. However, for all you lucky dogs out there,
    all is not lost. If you return the ORIGINAL disk to me that I sent to
    you, you can look forward to receiving a fresh, working copy.
    
ý
        The disk/s must be sent back to me within 3 days of you receiving
    the dud copy. If you live abroad and it takes a bit longer to post,
    then I will still exchange them. If I find the disk to be damaged on
    purpose, I may decide to not renew the disk. All official receivers
    who I sent out this issue to are logged down, so all you tyrants out
    there cannot receive repaired disks. If you accidentally delete a file
    on the disk, and all operations cease to work, then tough. You should
    not have deleted it. Try using DiskDoctor in WB to recover the deleted
    file/files.

        Only disks that were supplied by Mushroom PD can be exchanged by
    me at my address. If you picked up this copy at a different PD
ÿ
ú
    library, then you must take up the matter with that library. The one
    and only address for any Mushroom PD suplies and returns is :

                        Extreme AMOS Supplies/Returns
                            32 Castleton Crescent
                                   Gamesley
                                   Glossop

                                   ENGLAND

        The same also goes if you order any PD or registered disks from
    the library. You can opt for the exchange of a new disk. If I find
    evidence of tampering, then I will not exchange the disk. If you
    accidentally delete any files from the disks that I have supplied to
    you, then it is your own fault !!
    
ü
        All kinds of hate mail are welcome, especially letters telling me
    to continue my good work as a dedicated AMOS team member. Also,
ÿ
ü
    letters about any kind of queries you may be having will be answered
    as soon as possible. I will probably reply in the form of an ASCII
    letter on a floppy disk, so if you don't want me to do this, then you
    must say so in your letter. Also state what computer setup you have,
    including HD's, extra RAM etc.

        If you would like to contribute articles to the magazine, then
    why not trundle over to the section labelled GETTING INVOLVED in the
    Editorial/More section. If you want to know more about contributing to
    a specific section, then look in the CONTRIBUTING article in that
    section, if one is there. With the adverts, the contributing file is
    already included amongst the adverts themselves.
    
þ
        Extreme AMOS is always looking for new ways in which to get you,
    the reader, involved via the articles and advert/message services
    scattered around. As I said above, any queries or suggestions are
    especially welcome, and I would be especially interested if you have
    any ideas as to how it can be improved.
