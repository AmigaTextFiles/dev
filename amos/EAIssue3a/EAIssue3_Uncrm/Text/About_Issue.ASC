                               About this issue
                               ----------------

        Welcome to the third and final Shareware version of Extreme AMOS.
    This newer engine see's several changes from the last issue, and are
    all for the better I hope.
    
        As you will be able to see, this engine is very similar to the
    very first issue's engine. This is MY code, and I have never seen the
    source code from the engine Carl wrote, which apparently seemed to be
    the only contribution he ever made to the magazine, as he is now
    excluded from the team.
    
        I have tried to customize the icons as best I can, although I am
    not a brilliant graphics artist as you can probably see. I think it
    gives the whole magazine a feel of it really being worked on by the
    programmer (it sure took a lot of time to plan and write!). I have
    tried to draw a picture in each icon that best represents the article
    it is over, so that you can almost see what all the articles are
    without having to read the text underneath.

        I have also implemented colour text into the reader. Everybody
    else seems to be doing it, so I thought that I had better keep up with
    the times and do the same. Still, it looks nice. I have also made the
    reader display pictures which have been squashed with a relatively new
    AMOS graphics compacter, named Squidger. It was written by a good
    friend of mine, Paul Burkey, and crunches pictures down a lot better
    than the standard SPACK command does. You can save the files it
    produces in PP form, which crunches it down even further. The only
    drawback with the system is the amount of time it takes to unpack the
    files, as you will no doubtedly see when it comes on to viewing a
    picture, like the one in the "Asshole of the month" section for
    example. See the "New Reviews" section for ways of obtaining the
    Squidger program from Paul.
    
        The entire magazine is now in NTSC form, as some readers from
    abroad had a little trouble in running the program in PAL form. The
    picture viewing routines in the reader will still show full PAL
    screens, but it will chop them down a bit when it comes back into
    using the system. Hopefully, the NTSC form will stay in providing I
    don't get too many complaint letters !!!

        The adverts and messages sections have been improved a lot too.
    Because of the new graphics compaction routines, I am now able to fit
    lot's of IFF adverts and messages onto the disk without having to
    worry too much about running out of space on the disk. The reader has
    a screen size of 20 lines, each holding 79 characters, which gives the
    perfect parameters for designing a text or IFF advert, and it takes up
    hardly any space on the disk at all.
    
        This issue also see's a heck of a lot more articles than the
    previous 2 issues. They are all crunched using Crunchmania to provide
    you with as many different articles as I possibly can squeeze on the
    disk. It should keep you busy for a few hours at least !!
