                             Getting Back Issues
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
ú
        If you want to get hold of back issues of EA, then you need look
    no further. At the moment, all three issues are shareware, so you need
    not worry about any kind of ridiculous prices, unless charged by other
    PD libraries.
    
þ
        If you know of someone who already has issue 1-3, then you can
    copy your back copy from him/her. Any issues after number 3 are
    registered, and must be purchased from me.
    
ú
        You can get either of the first three issues from me, by either
    ordering the appropriate Mushroom disk from the library (it will cost
    you £1.50). Alternatively, you can send me 2 formatted disks and an
    SAE, with another first class stamp enclosed for each issue wanted,
    and I will copy the issue you request onto the disks, and mail them
    back to you the following day.
    
þ
        Also, you could send 5 first class stamps per issue, and I will
ÿ
þ
    supply you with the disks. If you are sending your own disks, then why
    not fill them full of AMOS PD, such as source, and of your own
    programs, so that I can include them in the library on Mushroom disks. 
    All source and programs which work correctly will be included, and may 
    even get on the coverdisks.
    
ù
        The address to send your orders to is scattered around various
    different articles of the magazine, so I won't bother repeating it
    again. Hope you enjoy the rest of the magazine. If you have any
    suggestions for improving the magazine, then why not fill in the
    questionairre and send it back to me. Meanwhile, here is a quick
    rundown of what was featured in the previous issues of EA.
