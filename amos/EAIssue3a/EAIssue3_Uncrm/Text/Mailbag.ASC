        Well, there does not seem to be vary many letters this issue, in
    fact, none at all. So, to make up for it, I shall answer some
    questions that have been asked about EA, which may help you out. If
    you have any letters about any kind of EA or AMOS subject, then why
    not drop me a line at the usual address.

    Dear Extreme AMOS,
    
        I am a A1200 user with a 500Mb external hard drive, and have
    installed each issue of EA onto it. I am a bit ticked off, as each
    time I want to run the issue, I have to also run the run-time data
    decruncher to unpack the data. If I try and copy the information with
    the decruncher running, it crashes my system for some reason. Do you
    do any versions which are already unpacked?
    
    
û
        Actually, I have thought about this myself, and have come up with
ÿ
û
    a good idea. If you send back your original disk (only if it was
    supplied by me at Mushroom PD), then I can exchange it for a HD 
    version, which contains a large archive of disk 1. The program asks 
    for a destination, and voila! It unpacks all the un-crunched data to
    your hard drive, taking a bit more space up.
    
        I have had problems in copying lot's of crunched files whilst the 
    decruncher is running myself, and I hope this helps some people out. 
    If you order future issues and would like the HD disk instead, then 
    remember to state that in your letter. Now, onto the next question.

    Dear Extreme AMOS,
    
        I have an old A500, which has been upgraded to 1Mb. In the past, I
    have had trouble trying to get your magazine to work. Could you please
    let me know how to run it, as nothing works at all on the disks I have
    been sent.
    
    
û
        OK then. The only thing that I can see that is affecting your
ÿ
û
    computer, is the fact that the previous 2 issues have been sent to you
    in FFS disk format. FFS represents the fast-file system read by
    Workbench 2 and upwards. The old Amiga 500 will only read an OFS
    formatted disk. As from now, I am making all future issues of EA on
    OFS disks, so you should be able to read this issue with no problems
    at all, as it needs at least 1Mb of RAM to function.

    Dear Extreme AMOS,
    
        I am a little confused. I have been reading EA since it first came
    out, and was interested in advertising some of my best-selling games.
    In issue 1, you were charging absolutely ridiculous prices, which made
    me stop and look in other sources, as there was no way I was going to
    pay those kind of expenses. In the second issue, you said that Carl
    had gone from the team, and that the cost of placing adverts have
    gone. Could you please set for the record, the actual prices for
    placing adverts so that I can sleep a bit better.
    
    
ÿ

        Yes, the prices were a little steep in the first one. The first
    thing I said to Paul Gumsley when Carl released the first issue of my
    magazine, was that no-one was going to pay those kind of prices - and
    I was right. Because of the lack of correspondence that he gave me, I
    dropped Carl from the team, and began ranning EA as I did the old
    Mushroom PD magazine. The second issue was a rush-job, as it was four
    days before the release date when I began programming that engine, as
    Carl left me with nothing to use. It also explains the poor quality of
    graphics.
    
        As for the price of adverts and messages, well I have abolished
    the scheme, as I never had a "Pay to Place" system before. All I ask
    of advertisers, or message leavers, is that they send me an AMOS
    article. wether it be a simple review of a latest AMOS extension, or
    game, or maybe even a tutorial for a particular subject or command. If
    you are sending lot's of pictures/messages in, then it would be nice
    to receive a few articles, or a first class stamp.

        I know the old prices put people off, and I hope that Carl didn't
    do too much damage when he did this. Well, the record is now set
    straight. I hope you start advertising with us soon !
    
    
ý
        Well, that just about does it for another month. Remember, the
    address to send your letters and articles to is scattered around the
    various different places of the magazine. Hope you enjoy the rest of
    your read !!
