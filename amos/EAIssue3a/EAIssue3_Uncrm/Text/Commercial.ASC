        This is the Licenseware section of Mushroom PD. In this section,
    you can acquire fully-registered versions of any kind of programs,
    ranging from games, to utilitys. The prices in this section are
    specified by the entrant, and cannot be changed in any way. The
    contents of the disks are not PD, and cannot also be exchanged for any
    other disks.
    
        At the moment, the library only has around seven titles, so it is
    not worth listing all the available programs. If you would like to
    enter a fully-registered version of one of your programs, then read
    the below file on SENDING YOUR PROGRAMS. The address is also goinf to
    be listed below, where you can also make any enquiries about the
    programs available.

                            Sending your programs
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        If you would like to go about getting your own programs into
    licenseware, then you must follow the below checklist.
    
þ
      1. The program you are sending must be written using AMOS. The
         source you use does not have to be included unless you want it
         to.
    
      2. You must send me a written or typed piece of paper, telling me
         the exact configuration your program uses. These include A500
         compatible, amount of memory used, if a HD is usable, if any
         external drives can be used, and the number of disks the program
         takes up. You must also tell me of any seperate programs you will
         need to run the program. I also want a fully-working demo copy of
         the program to include in the Mushroom disk section of the
         library.
    
    
ÿ
þ
      3. If the program will work on a 1Mb or under machine, then the disk
         you send the program on must be OFS, to allow old A500 users to
         use the program.
    
      4. The disk must autoboot, unless is a utility which plugs straight
         onto another program, or is a data disk.
    
      5. You must supply me with some screenshots from your program, using
         the SAVE IFF command. This is so that when it comes to be
         reviewed, I can show the readers what the program looks like. If
         the screen is split, then send screenshots of each screen, for
         different parts of the game/utility, such as different levels,
         options screens, or good-looking bits of the program.
    
      6. You must send me details on how you would like the cash to be
         paid to you, either monthly, quarterly etc., and if you would
         prefer a cheque, or payed straight into your bank account.
    
      7. You can register your program with other licenceware companys if
         you want to.
ÿ
    
û
        Basically, that covers everything apart from the price. You can
    ask as much as you want for your program, and I deduct a minimal
    amount from the cost to cover disks and postage etc., and the rest is
    then sent to you at the end of each month, or whatever system you have
    requested. You can charge anything from £1, right through to £100 if
    you think that your product is worth that much. If the program uses 1
    disk, then I will deduct 60p from the cost. If the program uses 2
    disks, then I will deduct £1.20, and for every other disk needed by
    the program, I shall deduct 60p. The price of postage is then
    deducted, and the rest of the loot goes back to you.
    
        In order to begin, you must send me the latest version of the
    fully-registered program that you wish to sell. No copies of it will
    be made to non-paying customers, and all copies sold will be
    documented and sent to you each month or whatever system you
    requested.
    
        You can also withdraw your disk from the library at any time, by
    letting me know in the post first, as It will take a couple of days.
