                             New Program Reviews

        Welcome to this month's review sections. Here are some of the new
    additions to the Mushroom PD library Mushroom disk section, as well as
    a couple of older reviews. We have new programs from Paul Burkey, Asa
    Margetts, as well as myself. None of the reviews of my programs were
    written by me, so I can't rig the review and say it is the best
    program to buy. I have decided to let others criticize my work for
    now. The games we shall be reviewing today are :

       Some of the above reviews contain screenshots within the review.
    When the picture has finished drawing, press the left mouse button to
      return the mouse pointer and the reader options. If the screen is
    bigger than the reader screen, then the bottom bit of the picture will
                  be "Chopped off" to retain the NTSC form.
    
    If a screenshot is going to be shown, it will be loaded from the disk
      and drawn on the screen. In order for you to get the system back,
      press the left mouse button, when you have finished looking at the
       image, so the computer can cut it and return back to the reader.

    Have you done a review of a recent AMOS game, or has someone reviewed
     one of your games, and you would like it entered here? If the answer
     is yes, then why not send it in to me at the Mushroom PD address so
     that I can include it in the next edition. If you want me to review
        your game, then send me a working copy. Please state if it is
      shareware or not, to determine wether I can put it in the library.

                            Author - Asa Margetts
                     Format - Hunt down and kill opponent

        Contentious is the latest game to come from Asa, and his first to
    become licenseware. The game is extremely simple - hunt down the
    opponent and shoot him dead. The game is for 2 players only, and you
    play a dude who has to wander around a small maze looking for the
    other player, who is also looking for you.
    
        On the way around, you can collect various weapons, which can do
    anything from increase the size of your bullets, to add speed to your
    shot, as well as shoot through the walls to hit the opponent. The
    gamescreen is split into 2 halves, and both screens scroll rather
ÿ
û
    well, and will both update the sprites rather well when they appear
    on the opponents screen, which looks rather confusing when you are
    trying to concentrate on a particular screen, when the above is doing
    exactly the same.
    
        To top it all off, you also receive a special level-editor in the
    program, in which you can design your own mazes, and save them to the
    disk for future use. There is a whole array of different kinds of
    walls and barriers to choose from to try and outsmart your opponent.
    You can even design your own player, and save that to the disk.
    
        This game is very typical of one of Asa's programs, taking oodles
    of space on the disk even when crunched, yet there appears to be
    nothing in the actual program that should be the length on the disk.
    The program runs very fast, and an updated version is already
    underway, with a whole new array of weapons and new playing tactics.

                          Game - Emotional Conflict
                            Author - Asa Margetts
                          Format - Graphic Adventure

þ

                  Compatibility - Any Amiga with 1Mb of RAM

ù
        This is the 3rd in the series of graphical adventures by Asa, if
    my memory serves me correctly. In this game, I supplied him with the
    plot, although he changed the original idea slightly.

        The objective of this small PD game is to try and capture a
    bad-ass renegade by the name of Mutant Mickey, and retrieve an
    invaluable golden coin he has stolen from a museum. The game is played
    with the mouse, as is all of the graphic adventures written by Asa,
    and basically, you just click on the screen at what you want, and all
    actions are automatically performed.
ÿ

ù
        There is some thinking involved however, such as where you get a
    particular key from, or how to recover a map. The game itself is
    actually quite small, which is hardly surprising for one-disk freeware
    production. The games he did after this have got slightly bigger in
    length, and also have more of a variety of puzzles to try and solve.

        Graphics wise, the game is very good. You can tell the artwork of
    Asa a mile off by the way he draws his cartoon images, as he has a
    character font of his own. Have YOU ever seen your mom with a yellow
    face? or maybe a paranoid scitzafrenic with a purple face? Well, there
    you have it.

        This is a puzzle game which should keep you going for a couple of
    hours. The entire game was made into a programming diary, and featured
    in WAC (the Whitby AMOS Club magazine) and covers all areas of writing
    these kind of games. For more information on this, Contact P. Gumsley.

                          Reviewed by - Asa Margetts
                        Type of Program - Music Player
       Module types supported - AMOS Music banks, Tracker modules, and
                      OctaMED on the registered version.

ú
    Okay, this is a music module player, a utility coded in Amos
    Professional with no extra extensions.
    
    The first thing that strikes you upon loading the program is that it
    uses full Intuition (E.g. a CLI like Interface) which for Amos is
    unusual and bloody difficult to do (with no command extensions!).
    
ÿ
ú
    Anyone who has seen the program MultiRipper will notice a resemblance
    in the presentation. MMPlay will support many types of music module:
    Noise Tracker, Sound Tracker, ProTracker, Amos Banks and the registered
    version also supports OctaMED modules. There are many available options
    which aren't really necessary, but useful none the less. Some of the
    extra features include: Displaying ASCII within the memory, being able
    to search the memory for certain ASCII keywords, typing an ASCII file
    from disk to screen, creating directories and resaving your loaded
    modules to new locations.
    
    There are other options that will allow you to customise MMPlay to
    your own liking. These preferences will be stored to disk and be loaded
    in every time you run MMPlay. You can even adapt the coordinates of
    the Window size displayed on screen (Shows attention to detail!).
    
    A more original option is being able to set Preset modules, therefore
    allowing you to load in more then one module at a time and storing them
    until you wish them to be played. Another option which I really like is
    the built in ScreenSaver! Very original for a music player. Draws a
    series of lines on screen and moves them around creating artistic
ÿ
ú
    patterns! As you can imagine Andrew Kellett has obviously tried to
    make this as original as possible by adding options that no other module
    player has.
    
    Loading and playing a module from disk couldn't be easier. The program
    automatically detects what type of module it is and plays it, so all
    you have to do is type "Load" followed by the path and name of the
    module. The program will display the modules internal name and size.
    
    Certain commands such as "Dir" and "Type" require the C: commands to
    be in the C: of the boot disk or hard disk as it calls and executes
    them from within the program.
    
    Presentation wise, this program is near perfect for a CLI based utility.
    Text is not just one boring colour, but uses all four of the Workbenches
    colours (Standard Amiga). As the program supports the Operating System,
    it obviously and happily Multitasks along side your Workbench, so
    permits you to listen to your favourite module at the same time as
    painting on DPaint. You can switch back to MMPlay any time and change
    modules simply and easily.
ÿ
ú
    If you are an experienced AMOS user, you will know that AMOS takes a
    lot of processor time even when it is dormant - not MMPlay ! You can
    run any other utility whilst it is running, and not lose ANY processor
    time. You can even powerpack files whilst it is running !!
    
    As with all programs however, there are minor problems or downsides to
    things.
    
    The program commands are displayed on screen by entering "Help" or more
    simply "?". During the use of the program, you'll find you have to do
    this quite often, so it may have been a better idea to let the user just
    tap the "Help" key.
    
    If you're like me and have loads of modules scattered on many disks and
    you want to search each and every one of them for a certain module, then
    you'll find this rather time consuming as you'll have to keep entering
    the command "Dir (Path)" each time. A requester would have been a lot
    easier to search disks and a lot quicker to load in the actual modules
    too. However, in the registered version, he has entered a file
    requester to load in music modules, as well as setting up preset
ÿ
ú
    modules. See what a bit of nagging can do !!
    
    The program is infact shareware with a couple of features diabled such
    as the OctaMED module option and a few other useful options are also
    disabled. However, for the small sum of £2.00, Good old Mushroom will
    send you the full version with your name encrypted and all options
    enabled. He'll also listen to any comments or improvements you'd like
    him to make to the program.
    
    This isn't another boring old module player, but one with attention to
    detail and has some very nice options (Got the point yet?), it was well
    written and for the money, it is worth every penny. I thank you all!
    
    A GUI version is currently being coded, and many requests from
    previous registered users have been implemented, and a demonstration
    version is available when you register, and you will also receive the
    full GUI version. Not bad value for money, methinks !!

ú
                   And the scores on the doors:
    
ý
          Conclusion: A decent music module player, well worth buying if
                      you have a collection of music modules and require
                      a steady multitasking music player.

                 Demo available from Mushroom PD (Disk No. 1)
                     along with other Paul Burkey demo's
    
û
        Jelly Othelly. Bit of an odd name this for a game, but the game is
    exceptional. It is based on the classic "Othello" game, and you must
    try and outwit the computer opponent by placing a jelly dow, and
    trying to capture the opponents jelly's.
    
        Paul has certainly changed the whole outlook of the classic
    Othello game here, by implememnting lot's of comical manouvers into
    the game, including a highly entertaining system of performing your
ÿ
û
    move. You can play at either 1 or 2 players on this game, and you can
    also choose the computer opponents difficulty level, ranging from
    simps, right through to damn near impossible. As you play the game on
    the difficulty levels, you can see the different ways the computer
    works out it's moves.
    
        Each time you go to play a move, your "Jelly", which replaces the
    traditional black and white tiles, is squeezed out of a tube onto a
    spoon, which you then move around with the mouse. Lot's of detail has
    been added here, including the jelly that blinks at you as it is sat
    on the spoon. When you go to place your actual tile, the spoon tilts
    and launces the jelly at the wall, splatting it into the playing tile,
    and transferring any of the opponents tiles in your path of the move
    into your colour. Plus, the more tiles you win off the opponent, the
    computer will make a totally wild and outrageous sound effect, ranging
    from the simple "Splat" sound if you get one or two tiles, to a wierd
    rhino call, and several other wild and wonderfull sound effects if you
    get over 5. The more you win, the wilder they get.
    
        This goes on until all the spaces on the board have been taken up,
ÿ
û
    and the computer then counts all the colours and decides a winner.
    There are several different board layouts in the full version, with
    just the traditional Othello board on the demo version.
    
        For this game, I would definately give the graphics a good nine
    out of ten, and the same goes for the sound effects, as there are some
    crazy sounds genarated the more tiles you win off the other player.

                Demo available from Mushroom PD (Disk No. 47)

ù
                                What is Twinz?
                                --------------
    
    Twinz is very similar to the old "Pairs" game, in which you must
    uncover 2 tiles at a time from a grid. If the tiles match, then they
    will stay where they are. If they are non-matched, they are to be
    turned back over, and you must choose another 2 tiles, bearing in mind
    where any other cards are that you have turned over, so that you can
    go back to them.
ÿ
    
ù
    The round is then completed when all the cards have been turned over
    and then the computer goes on to the next round.
    
                              Playing the game.
                              -----------------
    
    Like we mentioned earlier, the idea of the game is to match up two
    identicle pairs of objects in the alloted time and moves. Every time
    you match up a pair of tiles, you will gain 3 extra moves,
    as well as 5 seconds extra time, plus a small addition to your score,
    depending on your skill level. If you run out of time or moves,
    then it is game over. If you manage complete the round, then you go
    onto one of the 2 bonus rounds in the game. The game structure is not
    difficult to master but it's all a question of remembering where you
    last saw that matching pair.
    
    
    
    
ÿ
ù
                               The bonus round.
                               ----------------
    
    Well the bonus round is to be blunt a bugger. Some of the pairs are
    all the same at first glance. But looking again quickly you discover
    that there are indifferences to the tiles. Tiles such as different
    coloured cirlces, coloured electrical resistors are amonst the tiles
    featured. I actually found myself leaving the the bonus rounds as i
    thought they were off putting. Others will disagree with me but thats
    life.
    
                                  Features.
                                  ---------
    
    There are 5 different tile sets in the game ranging from Aliens,
    Letters + Numbers, People and others. So there is a few tiles to
    choose from if you get bored of seeing the same old tiles game after
    game.
    
    Other features include upto 3 difficult settings. Namby Pamby, medium
ÿ
ù
    and Difficult. The other option is to choose whether you require the
    SFX on or off. Basic, but functional features for a basic but
    challenging game.
    
                                 Conclusion.
                                 -----------
    
    Well i have seen some of Andrew's work before and i can say that his
    programming technique is improving with each program he does. This is
    a very well programmed game indeed. It does not pocess stunning
    graphics or a thumping rock music track, but what it does have if
    instant appeal. It's a simple, no fuss game that you can play as soon
    as you press your mouse button. A very good game.
    
û
    Graphics     7  Clear and functional. Just what we need really.
    Sound        6  Annoying count down drone and decent effects.
    Gameplay     8  Nice and easy to play that will get you going quicly.
    Lastability  7  Can get boring after a long playing session. Have a
                    break every so often.
    
ÿ
ý
    Overall      8  A well programmed think'ers that will kepp everyone
                    quite for a while.
    
ú
    STOP PRESS! STOP PRESS! STOP PRESS! STOP PRESS! STOP PRESS! STOP PRESS
    
ù
    Just as we were going to press, Andrew Kellett sent in these
    ammendments to Twinz. These make the game a lot more playable and less
    annoying. I increase the overall mark to 9 out of 10.
    
ý
     * In the old demo, the computer made a sound telling you what bonus you
       got. It was hard to work out what it was with no sound, so now a box
       flies across the screen giving the name of the bonus.
    
     * The size of the playing board now increases and decreases depending
       on the difficulty of gameplay which you choose.
    
     * Lots more bonus levels !!! I have made one out of eyes and it is even
       more difficult than the resistor level !!!
    
     * You can now choose between music and FX when you are playing.
ÿ
    
ý
     * A hell of a lot more boards, although I am struggling a bit to make
       new levels than the ones already done. The old levels have lots
       more tiles added on to them.
    
     * I have removed the rather annoying moves system, allowing you to do
       any number of moves in the time limit you have.
    
     * Basically, an overall better-looking and smoother running engine.
       Improved speed factors are the score and time bars, to minimize the
       amount of time taken to draw. The program has been genarally
       smartened up graphics wise, with 3D vectors popping up now and
       then, and the ENTIRE program has been re-written from scratch, with
       ideas from registered users included.
    
     * If you are already a registered user of any of Andrew's games or
       utilities, you can pick the full version of this game up for 3
       pounds, instead of the regular 5 pounds register price.

        Paul took a very basic idea, and transformed it into one of the
    most addictive games to date. In this case, he took the traditional
    "Worms" style game, you remember the ones, where you have to crawl
    around the screen, collecting the dots, and trying not to crash into
    the other player, or yourself. Well, Paul has certainly given this
    traditional game a bit of a flare.

        He has added many, many new weapons and ideas to the game, to make
    it much more challenging. For starters, you can have up to 8 computer
    players on-screen at the same time, chasing after all the goodies that
    are around. You can also play as "Teams" to try and kill the
    opponent's team. When you start a game, you get 1,000 pounds, which
    you can go into the shop and buy all sorts of possible weapons, which
    you can use to help beat the opponent. These include speed boosters,
    extra size, shields, bomb deflectors, stunners, bombs, auto-turn, as
    well as loads more. As you progress through the game, you can win
    money, as well as gain interest on what you have already got. If you
    start to run a bit low on cash, you can take out a player loan from
    the bank, but you must pay it back with interest.
    
        Each game starts off the same, in an empty arena. Every so often,
    dots start appearing. If you collect a black dot, you will increase
    your speed slightly for a while. If you collect a white dot, your
    snake will grow slightly (if you are not using auto-grow). You can
    also collect various different amounts of cash which keep appearing
    now and then, as well as new weapons, such as bombs, stunners, and my
    favourite, the virus, which slowly kills you when you collect it, and
ÿ
ú
    to get rid of it, you must pass it on to another player before you run
    out of body segments. Blocks also start appearing, which reduce the
    length of your snake when you crash into them. If you have auto-turn,
    then the computer will steer your snake out of any situations where
    you can lose size, unless there is no possible way out.
    
        You can use your bombs etc. straight away by colliding into the
    player who you wish to harm. If he/she has any kind of shields or
    deflectors, your bombs could prove to be useless, but if they work,
    you will blow a hole in the middle of the players snake. Stunners
    temporarily halt the players snake in one spot. Ideal for stealing
    lot's of on-screen bonus's.
    
        When the time runs out, you must make your way to the exit. The
    first in is the winner, and takes most cash awarded for the win. If
    you don't get inside the exit fast, you will die.
    
        Every so often, a random arena crops up, which places certain
    objects in certain places to make your job a lot harder. These range
    from blocks strategically placed on the screen, to whole areas of the
ÿ
ú
    screen being cordened off. Sometimes, the only way around the screen
    is to use the side doors.
    
        Sneech has had a lot of detail added to it, including lot's of
    different high score tables, for things like biggest worm made, and
    most money collected, plus lot's more. You can even change the colour
    and skill level of your worm, to loads of different possibilities.
    This is one game I definately recommend to everyone.
