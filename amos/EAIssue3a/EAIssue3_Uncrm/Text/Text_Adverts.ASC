    Yes, I do!! Extreme AMOS needs input from it's readers in order for it
     to survive, as I don't know what you would like to see, plus I don't
     think I will be able to come up with many more articles such as the
    amount I have done in this issue. If you have any kind of AMOS article
    you have written, or maybe a review of a piece of AMOS software, then
                  why not send it in to me at this address :

û
        Fed up of having to copy all of your files over to your HD, and
    unpack each and every one of them to make loading instantaneous, well
    with EA you can do just that.
    
þ
        If you have purchased a copy of EA from me, and only me, then you
    can return the first disk, and ask for the HD version, which I will
    replace free of charge to original EA disks. This is one big archive
    on the disk, which will automatically unpack all of the files to your
    hard disk, without them being crunched. If however, you have obtained
    your copy from another library, then you can send an SAE and a disk to
    me at the Mushroom PD address, where I will be happy to send you it.
    If you require a registered HD version of Extreme AMOS, then you can
    only order these from me, and you will recive it when you order the
    full cost of a magazine. State which version you want when ordering,
    otherwise you will receive the floppy version.
    
ý
        Alternatively, when ordering, you can ask for the HD version,
ÿ
ý
    which will be sent to you instead. Only original Mushroom PD disks can
    be exchanged, and any copies of the shareware issues which are
    obtained from other libraries do not count.

    Mushroom PD supports a lot of AMOS titles, sent directly to me by the
     programmers themselves. Here is a few of those titles listed below,
                  which you may be interested in purchasing.
    
þ
          Under the games section, we have the following top titles:
    
ú
       Scorched Tanks V1.85              Mushroom disk 53      1Mb RAM
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      ~~~~~~~
û
        An excellent game of strategy, in which you must destroy your
     opponents tanks using a whole variety of different weapons. Use your
       skill to calculate the correct angle and power of your shot, and
       choose from over 70 different weapons and shields to bring your
    opponents down. This version caters for 68000 and 68020 machines, and
     configures itself graphicswise to provide you with the best possible
              speed. Allows up to 4 human players. Demo version.

                            PLAYTESTERS WANTED !!
    
þ
        I am looking for people in which to help test a new game I will
    be writing. It is going to be a heroquest-type game, with many new
    additions to the gameplay. It will be played on a large map, with
    lot's of baddies, treasures, traps, and other natural or man-made
    obstickles. I am going to begin coding at the start of July, and so
    would like to gain a list of testers willing to have a look at the
    game and help writhe out the minor bugs.
    
û
        I am looking for people in which to test the game, to help in
    ironing out any minor or major bugs I have happened to overlook. As
    well as testers, I am looking for people in which to help design
    levels for play, which can vary in size and difficulty. I am no
    graphic artist, and would be gratefull to any artist out there who
    want's to become involved, who can draw good-looking fantasy
    characters, such as barbarians, thieves etc., in the form of the
    Heroquest game. I will also need help in designing the sprites and
    different weapons.
    
ÿ
ý
        People who already play the Hero-quest game, or a similar one, may
    like to undergo this task, as a player myself, I can spend ages
    playing games with my friends, and would appreciate any kind of tip's
    you have for improving the gameplay, and overall look of the game.

        If you wish to get involved, then why not write to me at the below
    address. You can send anything on disk, as I will reply to you in the
