    This is the shareware version of this magazine, Extreme AMOS 1. Recently
reviewed in Amiga Computing, it was stated as being reccomended to look at.

    On the first disk, is all the articles me + Carl have written,
including my Equalizer tutorial, and Tracker tutorial. These both come with
example programs, so you can load them straight into AMOS.

    The whole lot is controlled by an impressive engine Carl wrote, similar
to this Mushroom PD engine.

    On the second disk comes 2 compiled programs, both of which were
written in AMOS. Here they are in a bit of detail :

                               Piles'O'Tiles
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ý
    This is an amazing little puzzle game created by that AMOS god, Paul
Burkey. Remeber the Shanghai games? Well this is a jolly good
representation of these. There has been a total facelift when it comes to
the tiles, including pictures of Mushrooms, Cars, Faces, Disks, Flags, and
loads of others. I am told that the full-version has the original tileset
available as well.

    I highly reccomend this game, as with all of Paul Burkeys games, it has
that amazingly playable feeling.

                         TERDS Stereogram creator
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ý
    This is the second program on the disk. It was written by Carl, and it
allows you to create and save those horrible RDS pictures, you know, the
ones with all those millions of coloured dots.

    Carl and a couple of others tell me that they work, but I cannot see
nothing in them. If you like these stereogram pictures, then this program
is for you. Everything is controlled via on-screen menus for ease of use.
The registered version also has animation under the mouse etc. included, as
well as all the options turned on.


    Only the shareware version of Extreme AMOS is freely distributable
across all possible forms of media transfer, providing no more than 1
pound is charged.
