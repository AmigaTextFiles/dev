    Starbase 13 is a graphic adventure, created by E.W. Clay. You must
board a spacecraft which has lost radio contact, and basically find out
what the hell is going on in there.

    There has been a lot of attention paid to this game, both in the
graphics division, as well as the puzzles. You need fast reactions in parts
of this game to avoid being killed, as you do not know what lurks around
each corner.

    This is one game that I would definately reccomend to an adventure
player. Plus, you also get the .AMOS sourcecode, so if you own a copy of
AMOS, then you can see how the program was put together.
