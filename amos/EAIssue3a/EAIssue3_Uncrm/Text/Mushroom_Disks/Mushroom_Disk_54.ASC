ý
        An excellent Streetfighter-2 clone, boasting large sprites, packed
    with lots of different moves. Although only a demo, you can still
    choose from a few of the different fighters.
    
        Will work on any Amiga, but is slightly slow on anything under an
    A1200, but is still playable. This program requires at least 2Mb of
    RAM to run.
