    Legions of Dawn is the sequel to the ever-amazing Black Dawn series.
Programmed in AMOS by Andrew Campbell, they have to be the most popular
games ever to be written in AMOS.

    This game boasts the same gameplay fashion as the Black Dawn games,
with extremely well-detailed graphics similar to that of the 1200 game
Doom.. Everything is controlled by pointing to it on the screen with the
mouse and pressing the buttons, with controls similar to that of Captive.

    Although only a demo, you still get a couple of worlds to have a go at.
There are some extremely difficult puzzles in this game, set out in the
same kind of way as Doom.

    This is definately the best AMOS game I have seen to date. It is highly
reccomended to everyone, even if it is just to show off the powers of the
AMOS programming language.
