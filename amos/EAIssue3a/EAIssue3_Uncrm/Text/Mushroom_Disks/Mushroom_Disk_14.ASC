    This is a game created by Asa Margetts. It is called Pounds Island, and
is a graphic adventure, in which you must find and kill a guy who killed
the kings dog, or something.

    This game was written using the tutorials that Asa sent to WAC for
publication, and the game has quite a good gameplay to it. Some of the
puzzles are a little bit obvious in places, but there are some nice details
he has included, and rather a good morph-ending to look at when you
complete the game.

    With this game, you just point to whereever you want to go, so there is
no typing in on the keyboard. You need at least 1Mb to run this demo.
