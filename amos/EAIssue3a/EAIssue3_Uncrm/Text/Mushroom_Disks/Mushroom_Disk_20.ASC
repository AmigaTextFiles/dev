ý
    This disk contains Issue 3 of the Mushroom PD magazine. Everything in
this was done before I teamed up with Carl to run Extreme AMOS. The
magazine engine is very primitive, as it was designed only to list the
contents of the library. Everything is controlled by the keyboard, except
for the text reader.

    This disk is freely distributable amongst any possible forms of media
transfer, as long as nothing over one pound is charged.
