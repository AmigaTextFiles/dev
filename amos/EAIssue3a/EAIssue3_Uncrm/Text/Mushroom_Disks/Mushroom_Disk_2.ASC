    Black dawn II has to be one of the best AMOS games currently on the
market. Although only a level, you can still play 10 levels. The game is
set out in the same style as that of Doom and Captive, using the same style
of graphics, and screen controls.

    It has been reviewed in most PD libraries, and if I am not mistaken,
has appeared on a coverdisk. This is the official demo, so all little
extras are included, as no space has been made to accomodate a coverdisk.

    This game is extremely highly reccomended to all players of this type
of game, as it is the best AMOS game around to date.
