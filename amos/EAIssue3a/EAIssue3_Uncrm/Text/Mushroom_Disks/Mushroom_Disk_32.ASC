ý
    This program is not for the easily-offended. When you run the program,
you are given a list of subjects in which you must answer the questions
given using YES or NO. When you have answered all 12 sets of questions,
the computer gives you a purity reading based on the answers you have
given.

    Note that some of the questions asked are EXTREMELY perversed, so this
program is not for children, or the easily-offended.

    This little game is a version of Pong, with a bit better graphics than
the original. The game requires 2 players, and you must get the ball across
to the other players goal area.

    This disk is freely distributable amongst all possible means of media
transfer, as long as no more than one pound is charged.
