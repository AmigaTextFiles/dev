ý
        AMOSZine is another AMOS disk magazine, although not as popular as
    WAC. It is the special edition version which appeared on the Amiga
    Shopper coverdisk a while back. You will need at least 1Mb or RAM to
    run the magazine.
    
        Boomin 'Eck is a DynaBlasters-type clone, in which you must run
    around the screens planting bombs, to try and outsmart the opponents
    by blowing them up. Lot's of addictive action. Works on any amiga with
    1Mb of RAM.
