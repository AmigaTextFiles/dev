                                What is Twinz?
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
ý
    Twinz is very similar to the old "Pairs" game, in which you must
    uncover 2 tiles at a time from a grid. If the tiles match, then they
    will stay where they are. If they are non-matched, they are to be
    turned back over, and you must choose another 2 tiles, bearing in mind
    where any other cards are that you have turned over, so that you can
ÿ
ý
    go back to them.
    
    The round is then completed when all the cards have been turned over
    and then the computer goes on to the next round.

                              Playing the game
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
ý
    Like we mentioned earlier, the idea of the game is to match up two
    identicle pairs of objects in the alloted time and moves. Every time
    you match up a pair of tiles, you will gain 3 extra moves,
    as well as 5 seconds extra time, plus a small addition to your score,
    depending on your skill level. If you run out of time or moves,
    then it is game over. If you manage complete the round, then you go
    onto one of the 2 bonus rounds in the game. The game structure is not
    difficult to master but it's all a question of remembering where you
    last saw that matching pair.

                               The bonus round
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
ý
    Well the bonus round is to be blunt a bugger. Some of the pairs are
    all the same at first glance. But looking again quickly you discover
    that there are indifferences to the tiles. Tiles such as different
    coloured cirlces, coloured electrical resistors are amonst the tiles
    featured. I actually found myself leaving the the bonus rounds as i
    thought they were off putting. Others will disagree with me but thats
    life.

                                  Features
                                  ~~~~~~~~
    
ý
    There are 5 different tile sets in the game ranging from Aliens,
    Letters + Numbers, People and others. So there is a few tiles to
    choose from if you get bored of seeing the same old tiles game after
    game.
    
    
ÿ
ý
    Other features include upto 3 difficult settings. Namby Pamby, medium
    and Difficult. The other option is to choose whether you require the
    SFX on or off. Basic, but functional features for a basic but
    challenging game.

                                 Conclusion
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~
    
ý
    Well i have seen some of Andrew's work before and i can say that his
    programming technique is improving with each program he does. This is
    a very well programmed game indeed. It does not pocess stunning
    graphics or a thumping rock music track, but what it does have if
    instant appeal. It's a simple, no fuss game that you can play as soon
    as you press your mouse button. A very good game.
    
þ
    Graphics     7  Clear and functional. Just what we need really.
    Sound        6  Annoying count down drone and decent effects.
    Gameplay     8  Nice and easy to play that will get you going quicly.
    Lastability  7  Can get boring after a long playing session. Have a
                    break every so often.
ÿ
    
ù
    Overall      8  A well programmed think'ers that will keep everyone
                    going for quite for a while.

    STOP PRESS! STOP PRESS! STOP PRESS! STOP PRESS! STOP PRESS! STOP PRESS
    
ý
    Just as we were going to press, Andrew Kellett sent in these
    ammendments to Twinz. These make the game a lot more playable and less
    annoying. I increase the overall mark to 9 out of 10.
    
û
     * In the old demo, the computer made a sound telling you what bonus you
       got. It was hard to work out what it was with no sound, so now a box
       flies across the screen giving the name of the bonus.
    
     * The size of the playing board now increases and decreases depending
       on the difficulty of gameplay which you choose.
    
     * Lots more bonus levels !!! I have made one out of eyes and it is even
       more difficult than the resistor level !!!
    
ÿ
û
     * You can now choose between music and FX when you are playing.
    
     * A hell of a lot more boards, although I am struggling a bit to make
       new levels than the ones already done. The old levels have lots
       more tiles added on to them.
    
     * I have removed the rather annoying moves system, allowing you to do
       any number of moves in the time limit you have.
    
     * Basically, an overall better-looking and smoother running engine.
       Improved speed factors are the score and time bars, to minimize the
       amount of time taken to draw. The program has been genarally
       smartened up graphics wise, with 3D vectors popping up now and
       then, and the ENTIRE program has been re-written from scratch, with
       ideas from registered users included.
    
    
    
    
    
ÿ
û
     * If you are already a registered user of any of Andrew's games or
       utilities, you can pick the full version of this game up for 3
       pounds, instead of the regular 5 pounds register price.
