    This disk is another of one of my music demos. This time, I have created
3 demos, which each have a different tune for the letters A through to Z. I
developed this from an old program that I had on the Spectrum, so I created
a small emulator and copied the idea.

    The whole lot was written in AMOS, and the source code for the demo is
in the Tracker tutorial of mine, as well as the equalizer being in the
Graphic Equalizer tutorial that I did. You will need at least 1Mb of RAM to
run each of these demos.

    These demos are freely distributable amongst any possible forms of media
transfer, as long as no more than one pound is used.
