    These puzzle games, are part of a large project I was working on quit a
while ago. Remember the old sliding puzzles, where it was a grid of squares
with one missing, and you had to slide the tiles around until they all
fitted together correctly? That is what these puzzles are. They are not the
best puzzles in the world, but they can cause you a bit of a headache.

    On this disk, are puzzles 6 - 9. Some of them are better than others,
and the engines get better as the puzzle numbers increase. Judge for
yourselves.

    These small games are freely distributable amongst all possible means
of data transfer, as long as no more than one pound is charged.
