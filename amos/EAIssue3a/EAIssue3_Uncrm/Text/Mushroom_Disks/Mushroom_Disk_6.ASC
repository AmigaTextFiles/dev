    Dithell in space is an amazing little platform game, programmed in AMOS
by Darren Ithell. You may have seen Darren's game "Wonderland" If you
purchased the AMOSPro V2 package.

    Dithell in space is the same kind of layout as this, but with loads
more obstickles and baddies. There is some amazing graphics in the game,
including a mind-blowing special level effect with the background. There is
also a built-in preview section for all the other levels, so you can get an
idea of what the full version contains.

    This disk is freely distributable amongst all possible means of media
transfer, as long as no more than one pound is charged.
