     Description of Mushroom Disk 46     Twinz V2 - Requires 1Mb of RAM
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~~
ý
        This is a game written by Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett, in which you
    must match up all the pairs of tiles, and clear the board.
    
        On the way, you will come across bonus tiles, which can either
    help or hinder you, depending on the choice the computer makes. A much
    better version of this demo is available on Mushroom disk 47. You will
    also find a better description there.
