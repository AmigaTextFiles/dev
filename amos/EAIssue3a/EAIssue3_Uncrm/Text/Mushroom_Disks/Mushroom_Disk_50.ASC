                                  ~~~~~~~~~~
    
ý
        An excellent Flashback clone, with amazing graphics, and gameplay
    exactly the same as in Flashback. Although only a demo, this little
    puzzle should keep you going for a while. You will need at least 1Mb
    of chip RAM in order to play this game.

                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
ý
        The third in the Skiddy Things series. Choose the track you want,
    and the weather conditions to suit you and your opponents, and try and
ÿ
ý
    ice-skate round the track without crashing into the sides. Some nice
    graphics, as well as a feeling of addictiveness when playing. You will
    need 1Mb of memory to play this game.

                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
ý
        A rip-off of Mortal Kombat, except you play a piece of fruit, who
    has to batter other pieces of fruit. Some nice graphics and speed have
    been included in the program, including a rather odd "Final Hit"
    routine when you kill one of the opponents. Requires 1Mb to run.
