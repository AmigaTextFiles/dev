    This is a very good graphics demo, written in AMOS. It contains some
amazing routines, including a version of a cube, and each side has a
different animation on it. It also caters for the 3D extension, with some
amazing objects for you to look at.

    If you want to be astounded by some AMOS capabilities, then this is the
disk that you should have a look at.

    This disk is freely distributable, as long as no more than one pound is
charged for duplication costs.
