    This disk contains 2 games :

                                 Big Will

    You are in a quiz team, and some evil person has nicked your buddy,
sticky troll, and you must rescue him. You must collect beer tokens as you
go along, avoiding various baddies, such as killer-penguins, and psychotic
mummies.

    Although only a demo, you still get to compete in 4 worlds. The full
game has many more to offer.

                                Fruit Salad
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~

    This is one game that I like to play. It is similar to the style of
ÿ
ý
Bubble bobble, except that you have to collect all the gems to get to the
next level. In this version, there are 20 levels, and every 5 levels you
get a code.

    There are some good-looking baddies in this game, and a lot has gone
into making it what it is. I reccomend this game to everyone who is looking
for an extremely simple game to play.

    This disk is freely distributable amongst all possible means of media
transfer, as long as no more than one pound is charged.
