This disk contains 2 games:

                              Martial Spirit
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ý
    This game is a clone from the Streetfighter games on the Nintendo. In
this demo, you are only allowed to play as one player, unless you swap
characters, or play a 2 player game.

    The game has all the same features as the streetfighter games,
including the screen scrolling system. Each of the players have their own
special moves, and their own fighting methods. Each of the players sprites
is well-drawn, and the backgrounds in which you play are very well
presented, to give it a feel of a real fighting game.

    This game is a bit on the slow side on a 68000 processor, but anything
above should give it that little bit extra speed and gameplay. I reccomend
this game to all fighting game fans.

                                  Fleegle
                                  ~~~~~~~

ý
    Fleegle was written by a chap named Asa Margetts, to prove to himself
just how essential AMAL is to an AMOS game. Written without it, it shows
just how much of a difference it makes to the whole game.

    Even so, this game has an original storyline, in which you have to find
a special pod for your friend tadpole before he snuffs it. There are some
nice graphics at points, which give it a bit of a lift from the lack of
AMAL.

    This disk is freely distributable amongst all possible means of media
transfer, providing no more than one pound is charged for duplication
costs.
