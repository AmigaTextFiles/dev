    Jump 'Em is a small game written by Andy Cashmore, in which you play
this circular thing, who must jump over the tiles to get to the exit. Sound
simple? WRONG !! Each time you jump from one tile to the next, the one you
have just been standing on will disappear, leving a hole for you to fall
down.

    To add to this confusion, you have other tiles which can force you to
jump in a particular direction, or jump you somewhere else. To help you on
your quest, you can get tiles which do not disappear, as well as tiles
which will allow you to jump on them twice, as well as 3 "Bridges" which
will be drawn underneath you if you jump onto a blank square. If you run
out of these, then you will fall and die.
