        This disk contains games written by Paul Burkey. They are Shroom
    Backgammon, Jelly Othelly, Sneech, and a 50-level demo of Peg-It.
    
        Shroom Backgammon is a very good representation of the traditional
    backgammon game, with some very nice graphics routines in it. The
    source code for that river ripple is in the library, folks, so if you
    want it, then you know where to find it !!
    
        Sneech has to Paul's most famous game to date. This is one of the
    older versions, but it is still highly addictive. Remember the old
    "Worm" games, well this is one of them - with a difference. Collect
    bombs and other weapons to help you score the most points. Blow your
    opponents to smithereens, collect turbos, slide over skidmats, the
    list is endless. This game is a definate reccomendation to everyone !!
    
        Peg-It was Paul's first major release. You must jump Peg-It's
    over each other, until only one Peg-It is left on the board. Sounds
ÿ
ý
    easy? WRONG !! You have a set amount of time, as well as jumps, and
    some of the puzzles can be extremely difficult. To help you, as well
    as stop you dead in your tracks, are loads of different items,
    including boxes, trampolines, bombs, teleporters, and holes. You must
    make use of all these items in order to clear the screen. There is also
    a password system in this game for each level, so if it takes you
    months to clear a level, you can go straight back to the next.

        Jelly Othelly. Bit of an odd name this for a game, but the game is
    exceptional. It is based on the classic "Othello" game, and you must
    try and outwit the computer opponent by placing a jelly dow, and
    trying to capture the opponents jelly's.
    
        Paul has certainly changed the whole outlook of the classic
    Othello game here, by implememnting lot's of comical manouvers into
    the game, including a highly entertaining system of performing your
    move. You can play at either 1 or 2 players on this game, and you can
    also choose the computer opponents difficulty level, ranging from
    simps, right through to damn near impossible. As you play the game on
    the difficulty levels, you can see the different ways the computer
    works out it's moves.
    
        Each time you go to play a move, your "Jelly", which replaces the
    traditional black and white tiles, is squeezed out of a tube onto a
    spoon, which you then move around with the mouse. Lot's of detail has
    been added here, including the jelly that blinks at you as it is sat
    on the spoon. When you go to place your actual tile, the spoon tilts
    and launces the jelly at the wall, splatting it into the playing tile,
ÿ
ý
    and transferring any of the opponents tiles in your path of the move
    into your colour. Plus, the more tiles you win off the opponent, the
    computer will make a totally wild and outrageous sound effect, ranging
    from the simple "Splat" sound if you get one or two tiles, to a wierd
    rhino call, and several other wild and wonderfull sound effects if you
    get over 5. The more you win, the wilder they get.
    
        This goes on until all the spaces on the board have been taken up,
    and the computer then counts all the colours and decides a winner.
    There are several different board layouts in the full version, with
    just the traditional Othello board on the demo version.
    
        For this game, I would definately give the graphics a good nine
    out of ten, and the same goes for the sound effects, as there are some
    crazy sounds genarated the more tiles you win off the other player.

        Sneech has to be the best game that has come out of Paul Burkey's
    Amiga. It is known everywhere in the AMOS world, and has even
    appearead on several coverdisks.
    
        Paul took a very basic idea, and transformed it into one of the
    most addictive games to date. In this case, he took the traditional
    "Worms" style game, you remember the ones, where you have to crawl
    around the screen, collecting the dots, and trying not to crash into
    the other player, or yourself. Well, Paul has certainly given this
    traditional game a bit of a flare.
    
        He has added many, many new weapons and ideas to the game, to make
ÿ
ý
    it much more challenging. For starters, you can have up to 8 computer
    players on-screen at the same time, chasing after all the goodies that
    are around. You can also play as "Teams" to try and kill the
    opponent's team. When you start a game, you get 1,000 pounds, which
    you can go into the shop and buy all sorts of possible weapons, which
    you can use to help beat the opponent. These include speed boosters,
    extra size, shields, bomb deflectors, stunners, bombs, auto-turn, as
    well as loads more. As you progress through the game, you can win
    money, as well as gain interest on what you have already got. If you
    start to run a bit low on cash, you can take out a player loan from
    the bank, but you must pay it back with interest.
    
        Eacc game starts off the same, in an empty arena. Every so often,
    dots start appearing. If you collect a black dot, you will increase
    your speed slightly for a while. If you collect a white dot, your
    snake will grow slightly (if you are not using auto-grow). You can
    also collect various different amounts of cash which keep appearing
    now and then, as well as new weapons, such as bombs, stunners, and my
    favourite, the virus, which slowly kills you when you collect it, and
    to get rid of it, you must pass it on to another player before you run
ÿ
ý
    out of body segments.
    
        You can use your bombs etc. straight away by colliding into the
    player who you wish to harm. If he/she has any kind of shields or
    deflectors, your bombs could prove to be useless, but if they work,
    you will blow a hole in the middle of the players snake. Stunners
    temporarily halt the players snake in one spot. Ideal for stealing
    lot's of on-screen bonus's.
    
        When the time runs out, you must make your way to the exit. The
    first in is the winner, and takes most cash awarded for the win. If
    you don't get inside the exit fast, you will die.
    
        Every so often, a random arena crops up, which places certain
    objects in certain places to make your job a lot harder. These range
    from blocks strategically placed on the screen, to whole areas of the
    screen being cordened off. Sometimes, the only way around the screen
    is to use the side doors.
    
        Sneech has had a lot of detail added to it, including lot's of
ÿ
ý
    different high score tables, for things like biggest worm made, and
    most money collected, plus lot's more. You can even change the colour
    and skill level of your worm, to loads of different possibilities.
    This is one game I definately recommend to everyone and anyone who
    fancies a bit of a challenge, as 8 players including yourself can get
    very very competitive when it comes to a challenge !! The source code
    for a brief sample of Sneech is available from the library under the
    GAMES section.
