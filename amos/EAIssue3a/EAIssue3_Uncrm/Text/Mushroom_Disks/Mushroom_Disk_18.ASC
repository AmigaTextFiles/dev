    This game was written using the GRAC package, available from most other
PD libraries. It is a graphic adventure, with some amazing graphics.
Although only a demo, you must escape from the prison cell, which can be
very difficult to do at first.

    Everything is controlled with the mouse, and there are some very good
graphics qualities in the game. The little guy even follows the mouse when
you whizz it round the screen. This is one game that I would reccomend to
all adventure players.
