    MASH is another demo from Paranoid, the same group who coded the "Ant
Wars" games. This game has had a total facelift, and plays rather well.

    Still playing in the same fashion as the previous "Ant Wars" games, you
control either a tank or a spud, and the objective of the game is to kill
the oppenent. The game boasts some nice ray-traced graphics, although a bit
slow on a 600, the game is still very playable.

    This disk is freely distributable amongst all possible means of media
transfer, as long as no more than one pound is charged.
