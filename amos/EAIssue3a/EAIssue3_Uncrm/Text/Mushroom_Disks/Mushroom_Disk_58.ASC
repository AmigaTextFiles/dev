                   Review of utilities on Mushroom disk 58

                              Disk Catalogue V2
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
þ
        An extremely simple disk cataloguing program, which stores all the
    contents of lots of disks. It stores the information by asking for a
    disk number, and you entering information on that disk, which is then
    instantly loadable, and displayed on-screen. A much better version
    will be released very soon.

                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
þ
        A small CLI utility which will allow you to listen to any AMOS
    music or tracker bank, OctaMED module, or any Sound/Pro/Noisetracker
    module whilst you are working on something in Workbench. The program
    loses no processor time, as it is fully CLI automated.

                       Squidger V2, SQGShow and SQGView
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
þ
        This is an excellent graphics compaction system created by Paul
    Burkey, which crunches IFF, and SPack pictures down further than what
    the standard SPack does. There are 7 different kinds of crunching you
    can choose from, to best suit your compaction needs, ranging from a
    left-right pack, and even a plane pack. The SQGShow and SQGView allow
    you to look at your work. For the source code to the unpacking
    routines, so that you can use them in your own programs, look in the
    GRAPHICS section in the library, for the file PB_UNSQG.AMOS. You must
    have Paul's permission first before you can use his system.

                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
þ
        A phonebook program which I wrote, because I kept losing the babes
    phone numbers! Extremely simple program, as it is only catalogued to
    search for a name. The source code is available from the library, and
    the program was built up in the second issue of Extreme AMOS, where I
ÿ
þ
    released the first part of my Database tutorial. The second part of
    the tutorial, and a much better search option is available in EA issue
    three. See the PROGRAMS LIST for more information on acquiring a copy
    of the magazine.

                        Type of Program - Music Player
       Module types supported - AMOS Music banks, Tracker modules, and
                      OctaMED on the registered version.

    Okay, this is a music module player, a utility coded in Amos
    Professional with no extra extensions.
ÿ
ý
    The first thing that strikes you upon loading the program is that it
    uses full Intuition (E.g. a CLI like Interface) which for Amos is
    unusual and bloody difficult to do (with no command extensions!).
    
    Anyone who has seen the program MultiRipper will notice a resemblance
    in the presentation. MMPlay will support many types of music module:
    Noise Tracker, Sound Tracker, ProTracker, Amos Banks and the registered
    version also supports OctaMED modules. There are many available options
    which aren't really necessary, but useful none the less. Some of the
    extra features include: Displaying ASCII within the memory, being able
    to search the memory for certain ASCII keywords, typing an ASCII file
    from disk to screen, creating directories and resaving your loaded
    modules to new locations.
    
    There are other options that will allow you to customise MMPlay to
    your own liking. These preferences will be stored to disk and be loaded
    in every time you run MMPlay. You can even adapt the coordinates of
    the Window size displayed on screen (Shows attention to detail!).
    
    A more original option is being able to set Preset modules, therefore
ÿ
ý
    allowing you to load in more then one module at a time and storing them
    until you wish them to be played. Another option which I really like is
    the built in ScreenSaver! Very original for a music player. Draws a
    series of lines on screen and moves them around creating artistic
    patterns! As you can imagine Andrew Kellett has obviously tried to
    make this as original as possible by adding options that no other module
    player has.
    
    Loading and playing a module from disk couldn't be easier. The program
    automatically detects what type of module it is and plays it, so all
    you have to do is type "Load" followed by the path and name of the
    module. The program will display the modules internal name and size.
    
    Certain commands such as "Dir" and "Type" require the C: commands to
    be in the C: of the boot disk or hard disk as it calls and executes
    them from within the program.
    
    Presentation wise, this program is near perfect for a CLI based utility.
    Text is not just one boring colour, but uses all four of the Workbenches
    colours (Standard Amiga). As the program supports the Operating System,
ÿ
ý
    it obviously and happily Multitasks along side your Workbench, so
    permits you to listen to your favourite module at the same time as
    painting on DPaint. You can switch back to MMPlay any time and change
    modules simply and easily.
    
    If you are an experienced AMOS user, you will know that AMOS takes a
    lot of processor time even when it is dormant - not MMPlay ! You can
    run any other utility whilst it is running, and not lose ANY processor
    time. You can even powerpack files whilst it is running !!
    
    As with all programs however, there are minor problems or downsides to
    things.
    
    The program commands are displayed on screen by entering "Help" or more
    simply "?". During the use of the program, you'll find you have to do
    this quite often, so it may have been a better idea to let the user just
    tap the "Help" key.
    
    If you're like me and have loads of modules scattered on many disks and
    you want to search each and every one of them for a certain module, then
ÿ
ý
    you'll find this rather time consuming as you'll have to keep entering
    the command "Dir (Path)" each time. A requester would have been a lot
    easier to search disks and a lot quicker to load in the actual modules
    too. However, in the registered version, he has entered a file
    requester to load in music modules, as well as setting up preset
    modules. See what a bit of nagging can do !!
    
    The program is infact shareware with a couple of features diabled such
    as the OctaMED module option and a few other useful options are also
    disabled. However, for the small sum of £2.00, Good old Mushroom will
    send you the full version with your name encrypted and all options
    enabled. He'll also listen to any comments or improvements you'd like
    him to make to the program.
    
    This isn't another boring old module player, but one with attention to
    detail and has some very nice options (Got the point yet?), it was well
    written and for the money, it is worth every penny. I thank you all!
    
    A GUI version is currently being coded, and many requests from
    previous registered users have been implemented, and a demonstration
ÿ
ý
    version is available when you register, and you will also receive the
    full GUI version. Not bad value for money, methinks !!
    
þ
                   And the scores on the doors:
    
û
          Conclusion: A decent music module player, well worth buying if
                      you have a collection of music modules and require
                      a steady multitasking music player.
