    This is a highly-addictive racing game called High Octane, written by
Paul Overy. When you load it, you are greeted with a brilliant introduction
animation, and the game is not disappointing, either.

    You can race either against another player, or have both the computers
racing each other, to learn tactics etc. The screen is split into two, so
you can both race totally independant of each other. Collect things like
fuel, time, and weapons to blow up your opponents car, in order to be the
first over the chequered line.

    Extremely well detailed tracks are selectable on the title screen, so
you are not stuck with the same course all the way through the game. This
is one racing game that I would definately reccomend.
