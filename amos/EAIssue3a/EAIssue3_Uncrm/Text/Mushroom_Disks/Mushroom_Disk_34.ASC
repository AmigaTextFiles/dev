    This disk contains 2 games :

û
                           Scorched Tanks V1.85
                           --------------------

ý
    This has to be one of the most addictive games I think I have ever
played. If you are not familiar with any of the Scorched tanks versions,
there are between 2 and four tanks on the screen. You must work out the
correct power and angle settings of your tank, and shoot a whole variety of
different weapons at the oppenent, in order to be the only tank left alive.

    This version now has 70 weapons, as well as the ability to have 16 or
64 colours on-screen. The program will work on any Amiga, and even
configure itself it is a basic A500. This game is extremely addictive, and
I highly reccomend it to everyone. Once you start playing, you cannot stop.

                             Dangerous Natives
                             -----------------

ý
    In this puzzle game, you must guide your man across the playing field,
collecting all the gems off the screen. Written by Aaron Fisher, this
puzzle is controlled entirely by the mouse, moving across the field one
square at a time. Sound easy?

    Every time you move off a square, it disappears, plus there are arrows
firing in all directions, which update to their new positions every time
you make a new move. There are 3 different skill levels to this game, and
even the easy setting is rather difficult.

    This disk is freely distributable amongst all possible means of media
transfer, as long as no more than one pound is charged.
