        The second Shareware release of the magazine. Packed onto 2 disks,
    and uses a new WB-Style engine to make it's use easier. Carl has now
    left the Extreme AMOS team, and so I have all the magazine bits to
    complete.
    
        Packed with the usual source and programs. Here is a list of all
    the programs available on the second disk :
