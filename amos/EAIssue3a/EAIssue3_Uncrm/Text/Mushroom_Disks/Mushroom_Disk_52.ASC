        An excellent racing game by Phillip G. Harle. Although only a demo
    version, you get lot's of tracks to choose from. All scores and times
    are saved to the disk each time you play.
    
        The game is viewed overhead, and you can also play 2 players with
    a split screen. Different game speeds are also available, from a
    snail's pace, to extremely fast. Lot's of nice looking graphics and
    action, which is sure to keep you going for a very long time. Comes
    highly reccomended.
