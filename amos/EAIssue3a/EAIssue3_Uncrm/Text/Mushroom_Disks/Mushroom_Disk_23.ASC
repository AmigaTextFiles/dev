    Green 5 is an amazingly good-quality graphic adventure game, written in
AMOS by Mark Judge. The game has been reviewed in most PD sections of all
the magazines, and boasts some amazing graphics+speed for an AMOS
production.

    You are one of two life forms, who must try and survive by helping each
other out. If you fail, you will be erased from a database, in order to
make room for new life forms.

    The game plays in the same fashion as the Impossible Mission games,
with the man running along the screen in much the same way. As soon as you
start the game you must begin to work out some very complex puzzles. Lots
of detail has been put into this, including a woman who morphs into a bird,
who helps you as you go along.


    This is one game that all players must have a look at, as lots and lots

transfer, as long as no more than one pound is charged.
