ý
    This disk contains 4 rather handy utilities for you to use.

û
                               SAnalysisV2.2
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ý
    This is a small program, which tells you the current settings of your
system. It is handy to put in the startup-sequence of a disk, as it looks
for things like external drives, and tells you exactly how much CHIP and
FAST memory you have. The program was written by Asa Margetts.

û
                              Disc Cat V2.11
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ý
    This extremely handy little program catalogues the contents of all of
your floppy drives. It comes as 2 programs, the first will hold up to 5,000
entries, and the second will hold up to 10,000 entries. Both programs will
work on a 1Mb machine, but it reccomended by the author that you use the
ÿ
ý
5,000 version until your list gets a bit full.

    You can then save this list to a disk file, or search through it for
any particular program name. Written by Gary Hoyles, this is one
reccomended disk utility.

û
                               MenuPRO V1.2
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~

ý
    Written again by Asa Margetts, this little program allows you to
control WB operations from within AMOS. It stores paths etc. for operations
such as PPMore files, and you can then access them directly from the click
of a mouse.

    The program was designed as a front-screen for compilation disks. It
will hold up to 10 entries, and all instructions for using the program are
situated in the DOC file which accompanies the program.

                              Rainbow Writer
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ý
    This is one ultimate rainbow editor, written in AMOS by Malcolm lavery.
Everything that you could possibly think of doing to design a rainbow has
been entered into this program, including the function of making the
program as easy as possible to use.

    You can draw individual rainbow lines on the screen, ranging up to
shaded blocks. Also on the disk, comes loads of example rainbow, including
.AMOS programs which allow you to edit and use the rainbows in your own
programs. The source code for the rainbow editor also comes along with the
package. This has to be the best rainbow writer I have seen in a long time.
