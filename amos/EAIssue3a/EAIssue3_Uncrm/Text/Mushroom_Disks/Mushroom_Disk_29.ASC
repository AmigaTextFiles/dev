    Before me and Carl teamed up to program Extreme AMOS, I used to run my
own individual magazine. It only ever got up to issue 4. This disk contains
issue 4. This is the first proper attempt at programming a nice-looking
disk magazine. It used large colour fonts, whereas the old versions used to
make use of the PRINT and TEXT commands. In fact, having looked at the
program, I had only just joined up with Carl, as some of his stuff was put
inside it.

    In issue 4, you also received some source code from the library, as
well as the tracker tutorial. In the tutorial (which you unpacked from an
executable) you received several .AMOS tracker examples, as well as the
large colour fonts used in the actual magazine.
