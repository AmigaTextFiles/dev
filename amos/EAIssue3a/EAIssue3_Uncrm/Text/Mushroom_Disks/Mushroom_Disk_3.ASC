    This is a shareware version of the Whitby AMOS Club disk magazine. It
briefly contains what the newer versions contain, but is still quite
impressive to read.Paul boasts that this is the biggest pile of s*i*e he has
ever written, and just to be nice, I am going to offer it for distribution.
Ha, you can get rid of NADS 1 if you want, as it is in the library anyway!!

    Everything is controlled by the mouse, and clicking on-screen icons, so
no real instructions are needed. The WAC magazine is now up to issue 8 at
the time of writing this text. This is a reccomended disk magazine to look
at, as it was all written in AMOS.
