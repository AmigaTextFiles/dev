        This is the 3rd in the series of graphical adventures by Asa, if
    my memory serves me correctly. In this game, I supplied him with the
    plot, although he changed the original idea slightly.

        The objective of this small PD game is to try and capture a
    bad-ass renegade by the name of Mutant Mickey, and retrieve an
    invaluable golden coin he has stolen from a museum. The game is played
    with the mouse, as is all of the graphic adventures written by Asa,
    and basically, you just click on the screen at what you want, and all
    actions are automatically performed.

        There is some thinking involved however, such as where you get a
    particular key from, or how to recover a map. The game itself is
    actually quite small, which is hardly surprising for one-disk freeware
    production. The games he did after this have got slightly bigger in
    length, and also have more of a variety of puzzles to try and solve.

        Graphics wise, the game is very good. You can tell the artwork of
    Asa a mile off by the way he draws his cartoon images, as he has a
    character font of his own. Have YOU ever seen your mom with a yellow
    face? or maybe a paranoid scitzafrenic with a purple face? Well, there
    you have it.

        This is a puzzle game which should keep you going for a couple of
    hours. The entire game was made into a programming diary, and featured
    in WAC (the Whitby AMOS Club magazine) and covers all areas of writing
    these kind of games. For more information on this, Contact P. Gumsley.
