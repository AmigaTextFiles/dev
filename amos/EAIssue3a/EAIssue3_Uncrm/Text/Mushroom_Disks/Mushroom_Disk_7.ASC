    Obstickle is one of the few christmas games I have in the library. It
was written by Malcolm Lavery, and comes with a neat level editor.

    You are a christmas tree baubel, who was brought to life by a magic
fairy after all the childrens christmas presents were stolen. You were
transported to this world, and can only return when you have collected all
the presents.

    There are some nice graphics in this game, and an excellent christmas
tune, which may be featuring in the christmas edition of Extreme AMOS. The
controls take a couple of minutes to get the hang of, but then you are
away. The only disappointment is the one level, but you have a map editor.

    This disk is freely distributable amongst all possible means of media
transfer, as long as no more than one pound is charged.
