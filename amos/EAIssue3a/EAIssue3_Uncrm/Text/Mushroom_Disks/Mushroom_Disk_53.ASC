        An updated version of the classic game. For one or more players,
    and the objective of the game is to shoot your opponent to pieces,
    using your skill to judge the power and angle of your turret.
    
        Over 60 different weapons to choose from, plus the added extra of
    A1200 screens and options. This is one game I highly reccomend, and to
    help out even the novice Amiga user, the program configures itself for
    the machine setup you have. Smashing !
