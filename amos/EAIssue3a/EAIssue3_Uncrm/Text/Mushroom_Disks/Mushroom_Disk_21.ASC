    This is a great little game from an AMOS coding team named Paradox.
The game is called Ant Wars, and although only a demo, it is still very
highly addictive. You will also need 1Mb minimum to play.

    It is a lemmings clone, with all the same options as to what you would
find in the original lemmings games. A lot of attention has been put into
the game graphicswise, as there are simply millions of different objects
for you to dig through, and blow up.

    The thing that seperates this game from the Psygnosis version, is the
fact that you can put your ants into jeeps, or aeroplanes, to blow up all
the various different obsticles in your path. You can then walk your
ants through as normal.

    You can also play 2 players at this game, both using the mouse in the
standard port, and the joystick in port 2. Both screens scroll totally
independant of each other, so you can have a real head to head challenge.

This is one game that I highly reccomend.

    This disk is freely distributable, and can be spread across any
possible means of media transfer, providing no more than one pound is
charged for doing so.
