        Hello and welcome to this, an new section, which allows you to get
    in touch with other AMOS contacts. Unlike the Useful Addresses
    section, the addresses here are of actual AMOS coders who are actively
    seeking new contacts. The Pen-Pals section contains new addresses of
    those who wish to say a bit about themselves. OK then, I will give my
    name first, I think.

        Please note, that when you write to any of the addresses, that you
    state that you got hold of it from EA. If any of the addresses decide
    they don't want to reply, then it is not my fault.
