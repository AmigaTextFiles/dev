 What modules am I looking for?
 ------------------------------
ý
    You don't look for anything, the computer does it all for you. You must
type in commands for the computer to begin searching etc. The most common
form of modules used in games, are Noise, Pro and Soundtracker modules, as most
programming languages can accept these in some for or another. If the memory
counter detects one of these, or a Jam Cracker, Delta Music, Startrekker,
SIDmon, plus a couple of other types of module, then a small piece of writing
is displayed on the screen telling you so. Extremely basic commands allow you
to save this, or listen to it. See below on using the commands.

ü
 What else can it do?
 --------------------
ý
    Although only a demo, Multiripper can do a heck of a lot. It can also
search any DOS disk, and a lot of Workbench NDOS disks for music modules, and
decrunchers, which you would not be able to see in WB. All this information is
displayed on the screen as it is found.

    You can also display memory dumps on the screen, as well as save large
chunks of memory directly to the disk just by specifying the address of the
ÿ
ý
start and finish point.

    As I said above, you can also play around with decrunchers. Decrunchers
are like archivers, they store information in a compacted form, for use mainly
when a program starts. These decrunchers must not be wiped whilst unpacking,
or it won't know what to unpack. The ripper finds these, and you can sometimes
change the unpack address to a safe place where it won't crash with anything
you are currently working on. You can then decrunch it, and use the various
module hunting commands to look for any modules that might have be there.

    The powers of this ripper are amazing, and don't be too surprised if it
takes you a few weeks to seriously get the proper hang of it.

ü
 Commands
 --------

þ
    The commands that you will most likely use, are HUNT, HUNK, DUMP, FIND,
TEXT, SAVE, RS, RI, WI, CLR, PLAY and SCAN. I shall now describe each of the
commands in detail :

ÿ
û
 HUNT - This is the main module hunting command. It will look through memory
        in the given set range, looking for any of the compatible music
        modules.

        For serious use of this command, look at the section on FINDING
        MODULES.

 HUNK - This is the same as HUNT, but looks through memory to find decrunchers.
        Sometimes, the decruncher can be moved to decrunch in another part of
        memory. To do this, hit M, and type in the new address, followed by D
        to decrunch it there.

 DUMP - Displays an ASCII dump of the memory, starting from 0, or from the
        address you give after the command. Pressing ESC will exit you from it,
        and the cursor keys will move you up and down in memory.

 FIND - Allows you to hunt for a string in memory. The address for all strings
        mentioned after the command will be placed on-screen. The program will
        find your string 5 times anyhow, on A600 + A1200 anyway.

ÿ
û
 TEXT - Displays all ASCII text in the search range on the screen, a bit like a
        typewriter. Pressing the mouse button will exit.

 SAVE - If you have found a module with HUNT, then the program will SAVE it to
        the path given after the command.

   RS - Read sectors into memory. Enter the command followed by the first
        sector, then the last sector, followed by the address you want them
        loaded into.

   RI - Reads the file given after the command, into the address given after
        the path of the file. This is like a LOAD command, but you have more
        control over it.

   WI - Writes a file to the disk. Specify the start and finish adress's,
        followed by the path to save it to. This can then be loaded into
        anything you want. Note, that I am unsure about executables here, as I
        think it just saves as DATA files.


ÿ
û
  CLR - Clear the computers memory from the first address given, to the last
        address given. It is ideal to do this when looking for new modules,
        before you load the actual game, that way the only DATA there has to
        be from the game, and you don't get infections from other programs.

 PLAY - This command on it's own will attempt to play a music module found
        by HUNT. You can have this module playing, and work on other parts
        of the ripper. STOP will turn the music off, and FILTER will switch
        the LED on and off.

 SCAN - This scans the disk currently in the internal drive, for modules and
        decrunchers. All information found is displayed on the screen, along
        with the sector number it was found at, so it is a good idea to write
        them down if you want them, as the process of scanning is slow.

        It is a good idea to read sectors into memory, and add a few to them,
        to make sure that you have got all the information for the
        module/decruncher.

ý
    If you are unsure about any command, then typing it on it's own in the
program will give you a brief description on how to use it. Pressing HELP will
bring up all possible commands available.

 How to rip a module
 -------------------

ý
    OK then, here is the main nitty gritty on ripping out a good module. Whilst
ripping modules, you will come across 4 different types of module:

þ
1) THE PATHETIC MODULE
----------------------

ù
    The pathetic module, is when the computer starts displaying module names,
as things such as NOT ENOUGH CHIP MEM, or a long sentence seen in a game or a
program. These modules must not really be played, but too check if a module is
true or not, type in INFO, which will list all the samples in the found module,
if they are available. If this is filled with rubbish as well, then you
definately know that the module is a dud.

ÿ
þ
2) THE COMPLETELY INSANE MODULE
-------------------------------

ù
    This is where the computer finds a module, either a true, or a possible,
and displays it's length at a ridiculous length. The maximum position in memory
on a 2Mb machine is 1FFFFE, and sometimes it shows modules as even longer than
this.

    These modules are duds, and should not be played, or a crash could result.

þ
3) POSSIBILE MODULES
--------------------

ù
    Possible modules are when the computer stumbles on what could be a module.
The easiest way to test this, is to attempt to PLAY the module, but this can
result in a program crash.

    If you want to make sure, then you can use the DUMP command, to look in
memory for ASCII, for the sample names. If it comes up as complete rubbish,
then the module is a dud, and should not be played.
ÿ
ù
    If you do get words from the DUMP, then you can now try and PLAY the
module, or SAVE it to the disk. If it sounds a mess, then try and enter STOP
as soon as possible, or the system could reset. If it does, then just load
in the program again, and carry on from where you left off.

þ
4) PROPER MODULES
-----------------

ù
    This is where the computer comes up with a sensible name for a module,
which should NEVER be more than 20 characters in length. You can play this,
and save it to the disk for future usage.

    Typing in INFO will let you look at the samples used, with a brief length
of each one. Any ripped modules can be edited in most Tracker editor programs
available, providing the module is of the same format.

ü
 Working Example
 ---------------

ý
    You have heard me explain about the program, so it is now time for a
ÿ
ý
working example. Everybody has got the game LOTUS 2, so I shall now tell you
how to rip out the main tune:

û
1) Load up LOTUS2, and wait for the music to start playing. Wait a few moments,
   and then re-boot your machine, unplugging the HD, otherwise the module is
   un-rippable.

2) Load up your ripper program, and type in HUNT.

3) If the memory is not cluttered, then it should eventually say:

   Module located at $4E5D6
   Module name : Bootup
   Module Length $14566

   Type in PLAY to listen to the module. You can save it to the disk now, and
buzz from ripping your first game tune !!


÷
    Well, it's that simple !!! Now, read the other part of the tutorial, where
ÿ
I give you instructions for ripping other tunes, as well as how to extract from
decrunchers stored on disk.

ú
    Also remember, that it is ILLEGAL to rip music from any commercial
game, and to try and sell it to make you some profit. It is also
illegal for you to claim ownership of any modules ripped.

û
    This tutorial is designed to help you rip modules for your own
personal listening pleasure, and if you do distribute any of the
modules you rip, then the project they are included in must be
FREEWARE, meaning you make no money from it!!
