                                 Next Issue !
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
þ
        Next issue see's the first in the Registered editions, priced at
    just £2. This issue you are reading will hopefully be the last 
    Shareware issue for a while, unless a slump in sales forces me to do
    yet another issue.
    
û
        Next issue is going to be packed !! I am attending the "World of
    Amiga" convention, in Hammersmith, London, in which this issue has
    been officially released. I will be documenting everything that is
    going on down here, including interviews with many AMOS people who I
    happen to see down there, and anyone who wants to get involved,
    basically.
    
ù
        The reader will be fully improved, with the inclusion of my
    routine which will allow you to use graphics alongside any text you
    wist to use, very handy for fancy titling on the top of reviews etc.
    Maybe I will do a new engine, or just improve this one, depending on
    how many hate letters I get telling me the engine is rubbish. We shall
ÿ
ù
    have to wait and see !
    
ý
        We will also be seeing yet even more routines and source code
    programs, along with piles more hints and tips, and maybe even an
    extension or two on the coverdisk. Place your order now, by sending a
    cheque for £2 (£2.50 if you live outside of UK) to the below address,
    where the issue will be sent to you as soon as it is completed.

        New features to look forward to in the first non-Shareware release
    of Extreme AMOS include multi-coloured text on each line, faster
    graphics routines, and a whole selection of IFF fonts for you to use,
    which can be implemented to make posters etc. to cut down on the IFF
ÿ
þ
    files needed on the disk.
    
ý
        So, until the next time we meet, have a happy AMOS-ing time, and
    don't go playing with the traffic outside !! And remember, if you want
    the HD version of Extreme AMOS instead of a crunched floppy version,
    then remember to tell me in your order !!!
