        Hello and Welcome to the third Shareware release of Extreme AMOS.
    This should be the last shareware issue for now, but if I don't get 
    much response, I may have to release another. If you subscribe for the
    next issue, and it becomes shareware, then you will receive a refund.
    Unfortunately, I was due to release this product at the "World of
    Amiga" convention in Hammersmith, but due to a bereavement in the
    family, I was unable to attend. So, to make up for it, I spent a few
    days writing more articles and improving the engine a bit, hence the
    late date. So, if you see anything mentioning the convention, then
    just ignore them.

        Due to a number of requests, you will see that this program runs
    in NTSC mode, as a few people abroad had some problems in loading it.
    The text reader is also in NTSC mode, with a minimum amount of screen
    size to allow for the buttons.

        In case you missed the last issue, I stated that if Carl did not
    send me any articles or any brief words, I would "Drop" him from the
ÿ
ú
    EA team. Well, he has not even phoned. I got in touch with him before
    christmas, but didn't get much chance to talk, so I am no longer
    including him in any way. Carl, if you are reading this, get in touch
    with me if you want to change this !! In case you are not familiar
    with the way Carl f****d up the first release of Extreme AMOS, then
    read the article EA COCK-UP in the Editorial/More section. Makes for
    some pretty interesting reading.
    
û
        Onto a higher note now, methinks. This is the third and final
    Shareware release of Exreme AMOS, although not the final issue.
    Heavens no !! I have got tired of messing around with waiting for
    Carl, and having to design and program a full engine in about a week,
    so have decided to plan and program my own, which is what you can see
    now. If has taken a month of programming, to try and get everything
    together, and all the articles, and create the AMOS program to run it
    all. Next month's issue will have an even better reader, which will
    incorporate text and images together, as I have not had time to modify
    the routine enough for this issue. I am always trying to improve the
    magazine, so if you have any sugestions, then why not let me know. I
    am also looking for a co-editor to give me a hand in writing
ÿ
û
    articles/source code etc., so get in touch if you are interested. I
    would prefer someone fairly local so we can work together a couple of
    nights a week.
    
ý
        We have reviews of many new PD AMOS games, including one or two of
    my own which some people have very kindly sent to me. We also have the
    regular tips section, which has a couple of questions. I have also
    prepared several tutorials this month, including a nice one for using
    Multiripper 3 !! You can now extract the music from your favourite
    games !! You can also begin improving your database programs with the
    second part to my Databases tutorial, which has proved to be quite
    popular. Also covered, is several small routines, including a nice
    change for a graphic equalizer, consisting of a cross, which draws
    itself in time to the music. The file for this is stored in the DATA
    drawer under the name VU_CROSS, and can be loaded straight into AMOS
    as a picture bank, as I have left it uncrunched.
    
û
        New sections include an executable routines section, which allows
    you to view some interesting AMOS programming. This month, as it is a
    new section, all examples have been coded by me. They consist of 2
ÿ
û
    rotating vector designs, which if I am asked enough times, I may find
    the time to complete a tutorial on them. Also featured, is an example
    of the VUMeter Cross program, which is documented and source appears
    on disk 2, and a nice screensaver-type program, which I developed off
    the trusty old Speccy 128K.
    
ý
        The coverdisks are brimming with source code this month. Everyone
    seems to be writing 'Extractor' programs for the magazines, so I have
    decided to have a go at coding my own. This will just unpack the
    issue's source code to a selected drawer, where it will all be sorted
    into categories etc. Too many people are writing extractors to pursue
    the idea fully. A good extractor to look out for is the one on WAC, by
    Paul Gumsley. Providing I don't begin to run low on disk space, then I
    will put all the source into an archive, otherwise it will be ready to
    use straight away.
    
þ
        At the time of writing this article, I have absolutely no idea
    about the programs which I shall be including on the coverdisks. See
    the appropriate section for more up-to-date information, including
    lists of the source code for this month. I know that Shroom Gammon, an
ÿ
þ
    old game by Paul Burkey has been included, but that is about it.
    
ù
        I have also decided to drop the samples section. The lists take
    up too much valuable space on the disk, plus not many people wanted
    them, so I have decided to sell them in quantity in the 'EA Special
    Offers' section.
    
û
        As well as the usual sections, there is the Mushroom disk viewer,
    which can be called from the user menu. Just enter the number of the
    disk that you wish to read the contents of, and providing that it
    exists, then the information will be brought up on the screen.
    
ü
        Well, I suppose that I had better not take up any more of your
    time, and let you get on with reading the rest of the magazine !!! If
    you are interested in contributing articles in the future issues, see
    the 'Getting Involved' section.
