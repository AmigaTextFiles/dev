                             AMOS Screen effects
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
û
        When writing computer games and utilities, it helps if the program
    you are writing does something on the screen in a fancy kind of way, 
    like clearing the text from the screen. It would be rather boring to 
    use a simple CLS command, but using a screen effect, you can clear the 
    information in such a way that would keep the user enthralled for 
    quite a while.
    
        The most common kind of screen wipe available is the FADE command, 
    which reduces the value of the colours on the screen, so that they 
    reduce to black, or a specified set of colours, within a certain time 
    set by the command.
    
        Other commands that can be used are CLS, SCREEN COPY, PLOT, DRAW, 
    plus loads more, including commands from various extensions. 
    Hopefully, this small document will introduce you to various different 
    kinds of screen effects, other than just clearing the screen.

                             Using Colourshifting
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
û
        One very interesting screen effect, is using a colourshifting
    sequence. This involves a picture being drawn on a screen, and the 
    pallette of colours it uses being shifted, rather than you actually 
    changing the picture. This can result in huge proportions of the 
    screen changing colour thousands of times faster than using a command 
    such as FILL or PAINT.
    
        The different possibilities for this are endless. Common ones 
    include "Plasma" effects, which use around 32 colours, and shift up by 
    one at a time, which produces the plasma effect.
    
        Another example of a colourshift is the VU Cross, found in the 
    executables section of this issue, and in source code form on disk 2. 
    The colour values of the cross are changed with the values in VUMeter, 
    in order to give a graphic equalizer effect.
    
        If you had read the last issue, you would have seen that I had a
    colourshifting text sequence, which drew the text of your choice on
ÿ
û
    the screen, and altered the colours in sequence. In case you didn't
    get a hold of this program, I shall place it in the source code on
    disk 2.

                                  Using CLS
                                  ~~~~~~~~~
û
        Using CLS on it's own will just clear the whole screen instantly.
    Interesting effects to use would be to use coordinates after the
    command, to clear little boxes off the screen. To do this, you can
    genarate a small array in memory, to hold wether or not a particular
    section on the screen has been cleared. You can call these sections at
    random to produce an interesting screen clear.
    
ü
                                  Using DRAW
                                  ~~~~~~~~~~
û
        If you decide to use DRAW, there are thousands of different ways
    of which to do this. Because DRAW can clear whatever it has underneath 
    it fast, you can create interesting fading patterns, even whilst a 
    colourshift is underway. There is a small program situated on disk 2 
    to tantalize your taste buds in what I mean, so scoot on over there.

                              Using SCREEN COPY
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
û
        SCREEN COPY can produce some amay-zing effects, at extremely high
    speeds. It can be used to clear or introduce a new screen into view,
    in much the same way as the CLS command using blocks. You don't have
    to even clear the screen underneath, as everything in it's way will be
    cleaned out, even the colour 0, unlike bob's which will merge with the
    colour 0.
    
        For a much more better idea of what I am prattling on about, try
    loading the example on disk 2 into your AMOS editor, and hit the play
    button.

                           Other Interesting Ideas
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
û
        There are hundreds of different ways in which you can spruce up
    your screens. Take for example, the vectors featured at the bottom of
    the screen you took this document from. These can be really
    interesting, especially when formed into shapes that correspond with
ÿ
û
    the program. You can also make them go at any speed, either by using
    DRAW, or storing them in the memory as BOB's. The 2 vectors in this
    section were done using DRAW, but the 3 at the start of the program
    was done using a sprite bank, simply because DRAW could not provide me
    with the adequate speed that an AMAL string provided.
    
        If enough people hassle me this month, then I may consider doing a
    tutorial on the vectors I have drawn. I am unsure however, on any ways
    of using "Hidden lines" in either a cube or a more complex shape, so
    if anyone out there knows, I would be gratefull of any examples and
    tips you could provide me with.

                         Brightening Up A Dull Screen
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
û
        Hmm, I often get asked how to do this. You should start by looking
    at the simple things which you see in front of your eyes. A screen of
    text, for example. Hmm, you could use a font off the disk to give it
    that little bit more jazz. Now then, there is still something missing.
    Ah, a nice little border around the edges using DRAW. Now then, it
    says at the bottom "Press ENTER to continue", so that can go, and I
ÿ
û
    can replace it with a 3D click button saying "Click to Continue".
    There, brightened up the whole thing.
    
        See, even the most dullest of situations can be brightened up with
    just a few extra AMOS commands, which only take a few extra bytes when
    compiled. If you want your program to be noticed, so that the user may
    think of buying it, you will want it to stick out in the crowd.
    
        As mentioned at the top, instead of having the old "Press ENTER"
    stuck at the bottom of the text, you could have a click button, and
    use a font instead of the old Topaz font. Why not use an IFF font to
    make interesting headers, or have a neat fade in/out routine using
    either FADE or something like SCREEN COPY. The list is totally
    endless.
    
        I think I have covered most of this subject, and only you can
    think of the ideas to finish off your program. Good luck !
