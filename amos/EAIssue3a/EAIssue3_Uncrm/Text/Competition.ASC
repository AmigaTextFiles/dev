                            EA Competition
                            --------------

ý
        Well, it's competition time. Here is a chance for one of you lucky
    dog's to win yourself a crisp fiver !! All you have to do is design an
    AMOS program which will do one of the below things :

ù
        *  A fully user-interfaced crossword/wordsearch editor AND player.
           The user must be able to edit and play old and new grids at any
           time, with the greatest of ease.

        *  Design a packer program which will crunch down text files, and
           also unpack them at a relative speed.

        *  A graphical card-game such as poker, with the option of having
           up to 4 human/computer players all competing against each
           other.



ÿ
ù
        *  A utility of some sort, which would be extremely usefull to
           someone out there. I am willing to look at any kinds of
           utilities for this section.


û
        Well, that should keep you going until the next issue. I will
    decide a winner for each section, and the overall winner will receive
    the fiver in the post !! The runners up from each section may claim 2
    Mushroom disk orders for FREE.

     The last competition (Gulp!)
     --------------------

û
        Well, due to an unforseen error, I did not get any entries for the
    last competition. Maybe the postman stole them? who knows. To cut a
    long and boring story short, I did not get a single entry. Perhaps it
    was something someone had done, and they went to see/do that instead.
    Who knows ?

        Be a devil, and enter this compo. After all, you can do no worse
ÿ
û
    than lose !! Plus, if you turn out to be the only person to actually
    enter this competition, you could actually benefit from it all by
    automatically winning that fiver.

        Pack your program on a disk, and stuff it in a jiffy bag, and post
    it to me here at Mushroom PD at this address before May 30th 1996 :

        All programs sent will be included in the library, and the winner
    will have his/her program placed on the coverdisk for everyone to see.
    I would also prefer it if you sent the program in source code format,
    so it can go straight into the source code section for all to see.
    Until the next time !!!
