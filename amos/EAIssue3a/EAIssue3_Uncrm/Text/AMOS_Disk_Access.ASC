                               AMOS Disk Access
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
û
        One thing that I feel is important in an AMOS program, is the way
    that the game you are playing enters the disk when loading in
    information. I have an external drive, which is invaluable to me, as
    my internal drive does not function correctly.
    
        It really pisses me off when I am told of a top new AMOS title
    that has been released, and when I manage to get hold of a copy, it is
    always popping up "Insert Volume... in DF0:". Because I can't even
    validate a disk in my internal, it means I have to play around with a
    binary editor to change it all around.
    
        The reason I am writing this document, is to tell people how they
    can avoid all this torment and anger. One way, and extremely simple,
    is to use the volume name of the disk, as this will look on any drive.
    If you need to look onto a root disk or something, then don't always
    assume that it is the internal drive, if you use the volume name SYS:
    then the program will look on the disk it was booted from, in the
ÿ
û
    drive it was booted from.
    
        What I am really trying to say, is there are more than one person
    out there with a slightly-dodgy internal drive, and want to play your
    games using an external drive. So make these simple changes in your
    program, as they will make a lot of other people happy to.
