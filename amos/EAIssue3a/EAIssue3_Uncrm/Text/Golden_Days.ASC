                                The Golden Days
                                --------------
    
û
        Remember the good 'ol days before the Amiga stepped into the
    limelight in the way it has today, and the larger Sega and Nintento
    companies had hardly ever been heard of in this country, and the old
    8-bit machines such as the Spectrum and Commodore 64 dominized this
    country's game markets.
    
        I used to own both machines, with a +2 and a +3 Spectrum, which I
    remember swapping for a hi-fi system. I also used to own the Amstrad
    CPC 464 machine, and I knew a guy who had a TRS-80 and the Commodore
    16, as well as a VIC 20.
    
        As I glare hesitantly into my past thoughts of the old Commodore
    days, thinking nowadays "Why?", I can see myself running home as fast
    as I could to load and play top games such as Commando and Aztec
    Challenge, which nowadays don't even register against some of the
    modern games we can buy in the shops. I can even remember when our
    local library used to rent out Commodore 64 games, and I used to spend
ÿ
û
    loads on renting, and on blank tapes to save onto with my Action
    Replay cartridge.
    
        Looking back on it, I still think that the Commodore 64 was the
    best home computer ever to be invented. I would gladly like to shake
    the hand of the guy or gals that invented it, as it contained some of
    the best things that a computer could ever possibly have. For
    starters, the SID chip was a revolution of it's own, providing us for
    the first time with quality chip music, using hardly any memory at
    all. Even on my Amiga today, I have C64 SID emulators to listen to
    some of the amazing C64 music that was out at the time, and no modern
    music makers or players can EVER take away that true and original SID
    sound !
    
        Another amazing inclusion in the commodore package was the fact
    that you could now have colour sprites, whereas on the Spectrum and
    Amstrad machines, you could only use 1 ink colour. Sprites however,
    were rather complicated to program in if you did not have a sprite
    editor, and I gave up loads of times after designing my images on
    paper. As well as the colour sprites, the home computer could now
ÿ
û
    display FULL colour images, instead of the pathetic Spectrum system,
    which kept colour-crashing the screen when certain colour combinations
    clashed with each other. Gamesmakers and demomakers took this to the
    advantages, creating some stunning graphical scenes for games like
    Robocop, Midnight Resistence, and many others. The full effect of the
    C64 had not come into full effect yet.
    
        Several years ago, there was one man who made the world stop and
    look at the C64 with a totally different view. His name was Jeff
    Minter, and he created some of the most outrageous games like Attack
    of the Mutant Camels, and the ultimate in gaming - Hovver Bovver,
    which was so outrageous and entertaining to play. The long-haired hippy
    turned the games industry for the 64 into what it was a few years ago,
    as he inspired many more programmers to work at home on their systems
    just like he did. All of his programs were featured on the cassettes of
    Commodore Format, a magazine for the C64.
    
        Then came the PD scene for the 64 in a massive way. This brought
    us graphics and chip music so spectacular, you would not have thought
    it possible on the 64 at all. Demo companies from all round the world
ÿ
û
    began releasing demo's with amazing scroll routines, graphics, and
    genarally just anything that the 64 was capable of doing, they did it
    with brass bells on. Me and a friend of mine, Mike Wilcock began
    collecting these for a while until the numbers of demo's available
    were too many to even begin counting.
    
        Some of the demo coders went on to produce games. One example was
    a Tetris clone, which was so unbelivably fast, and had graphics which
    made it look as though it was done in Amiga HAM mode. We also began
    seeing games suddenly change into multiplex combinations of graphics
    and sounds, and they were now beginning to stray from the traditional
    beat-em-up's, to new and untried ideas. One of these ideas was the
    "Creatures" series, an excellent game in which you had to save these
    creatures from torture. They added a humourous look to the game, with
    the sprites dancing along to the music, and the bosses for the game
    were silly things like worms on bicycles, controlling huge mechanisms
    which kept killing them off, yet look amazing graphics wise.
    
        Although the Amiga nowadays is overpowering to the 64, it just
    goes to show what could be done on a home computer several years ago,
ÿ
û
    before the Amiga had really been released. I personally don't think
    that the 64 era will ever be beaten by the Amiga, at least not for a
    few more years, and the dedicated 64 user will NEVER forget the system
    he/she used to own !!
    
        Thank-you for taking the time to read this document. I hope that
    you had some good memories of your old computer systems whilst reading
    it. I am now going to leave you with some screenshots taken from some
    Commodore 64 demos. Hope you enjoy them !!!
