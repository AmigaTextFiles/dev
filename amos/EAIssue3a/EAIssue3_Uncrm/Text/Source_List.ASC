                           This Issue's Source Code
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
þ
        Alrighty folks, it's time for a rundown of this issue's source
    code. This time we have 41 uncrunched AMOS programs, which I think is
    the most I have ever placed on one issue. So, here we go with a brief
             rundown of each. All authors are listed at the end :

û
      This is the source code which comes with the Assigner tutorial. It
          saves you having to place lot's of ASSIGN commands in your
     startup-sequence file, and allows you to place them all in one ASCII
     file and initalize them all at once. Handy especially to a HD user.
