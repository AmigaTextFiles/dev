                              Using Extreme AMOS
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Welcome to the third and final shareware release of Extreme AMOS.
    I hope that you have enjoyed what you have seen so far. This engine 
    was designewd and programmed by Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett of Mushroom 
    PD, as was designed to be as easy to use as possible.
    
û
        To find your way around the system, you just simply have to click
    on the icons that are on display in the current window. The current
    window is the latest window to have been opened on the screen.
    
ø
        Some of these icons will lead to new drawers on the screen, and
    other icons will take you into the magazine text viewer, to begin
    reading the file/viewing the pictures within it. If you require help
    on using the reader itself, then you can either click on the HELP
    button, or press the HELP key whilst you are inside the actual viewer.

        Each window when opened, displays the contents of that drawer on
    the screen in the form of icons, which you can click on with the left
    mouse button. In the top left-hand corner of the window, there is a
    small box. This is known as the close gadget. Clicking on this will
    close the current window, and return you to the previous window. If
    you closed the final window, then the program will reset the Amiga.
    
ú
        The gadget next to it, which goes to the edge of the window, tells
    you the name of the current window, or the section it is representing.
    This has no effect when clicked on at the moment.
    
÷
        As well as the on-screen icons, you can also select a couple of
    items from the EA menu. This is activated when you hold down the right
    mouse button, and moving the mouse to the top left hand edge of the
    screen. Simply let go of the mouse button when you have made your
    choice, and the action within it will be taken.

                       Using the Mushroom disk section
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
ø
        If you are interested in looking closer at the contents of any
    Mushroom disk, then you can select the Mushroom Disk option from the
    menu, which will present you with a screen. It will ask you for the
    Mushroom Disk number you wish to view.
    
ý
        If you press Enter on it's own, then you will resume back to the
    rest of the magazine. If you enter a number, then the computer will
    check to see if it exists. If it does, then the program will read the
    appropriate disk. If not, they you are asked to enter another Mushroom
    disk number until the Enter key is pressed.
    
þ
        The size of the Mushroom disk files are very small, and contain
    brief information about the programs. If the Mushroom disk is reviewed
    by anyone, then the review will take it's place instead of my old
    text. Once the review has been read, you will be asked for another
    disk number.
