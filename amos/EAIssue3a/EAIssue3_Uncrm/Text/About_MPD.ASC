                              About Mushroom PD
                              -----------------
    
þ
        Mushroom PD is an AMOS Public Domain library that I decided to set
    up just over a year ago, as I found it hard to get hold of bulk AMOS
    PD without having to pay huge prices either to recive the products, or
    just to register to the group who supplies them.
    
ú
        After viewing the price lists of several AMOS PD libraries, I
    began trying to collect as much AMOS Source and programs as I possibly 
    could get my hands on. A couple of months later, I opened the library 
    to the public, and allowed the users of AMOS to get out of it just 
    what they really need.
    
û
        The library operates in 2 main parts, the source code section, and
    the Mushroom disk sections. Everybody is always needing source code
    for their AMOS projects, as they are bound to get stuck on something
    at some point, and require an already-written routine to look at to
    see where they had gone wrong. All the source code in the library is
    categorized, so that when it comes to buying source, you know just
ÿ
û
    what type of source it is that you are looking for. Each issue of
    Extreme AMOS see's all the source code listed in the library, with the
    total size of the section underneath to help you work out how much
    space on the disk you will need. As the long long lists begin to grow,
    I will probably just list the sizes. Plus, on the EA disks, I include
    some of the latest source code to be entered into the library for you
    at home to use straight away. New sections are always trying to be
    added to the source section, to make the selection of source code you
    want even easier. If you have a disk full of source code that you
    would like to include, then why not send it in to me at the end of
    this document. You can exchange this source for more source code out
    of the library, or you can opt to receive a Mushroom disk.
    
þ
        Another major section in the library is the section on the
    Mushroom disks. These are special PD disks which can be filled with
    absolutely any AMOS related programs, ranging from games, utilities,
    right through to music demo's, which seem to be very popular. Each
    mushroom disk costs the standard prices listed in the PRICES section,
    and if you have a new game that you want to include in this section,
    either in full or a playable demo, then you can send it in and
ÿ
þ
    exchange it for another Mushroom disk title. Alternatively, you can
    exchange it for a disk of source code, or not to exchange for
    anything. Mushroom disks come "As-Is" and are fully tested before they
    are entered into the library. The PROGRAMS LIST lists all the programs
    that I currently have, and the Mushroom disk they appear on. Remember
    that some disks may only contain the one program, and others can
    contain up to 5 or 6 different programs. No information can be added
    to these disks, and if you accidentally damage them after you receive
    them, then it is your own fault. If the disk however is genuinely
    faulty when you received it, you can use the returns section in the
    FAULTY DISKS section to claim a fresh copy, only if you have bought it
    from my library.
    
ý
        Entering your own Mushroom disks do require some parameters before
    they can be entered. Firstly, something on the disk must be written in
    AMOS, such as a small driver to play the music files at the minimum.
    If it is a game or utility, then the game or utility must have been
    coded in AMOS. I am also trying to get the library to appeal to A500
    users, so if your program only needs a maximum of 1Mb RAM, and does
    not require anything over WB2.04, then the disk must be OFS
ÿ
ý
    filesystem, so that it can be read and played on an upgraded A500. The
    disk you send must contain all librarys and necessary doc files, and
    the whole thing must autoboot, so that even the most unfamiliar
    Workbench users can get it to work easily. Your name and adress, as
    well as any other advertisements for any of your games are freely
    acceptable, including adverts for other PD librarys etc., as I am not
    really fussed. I would be gratefull if you did include an MPD advert
    in somewhere if you use a lot of adverts. When you send your disk(s)
    to me, you must tell me exactly what programs are on the disk, and
    what amount of memory it will need to run, as well as any special
    equipment that is needed to run it. Multidisk programs are welcome.
    Well, that just about covers it.

        The library is also looking for new kinds of AMOS sections in
    which to add, and any sections which you the AMOS coders would find
    usefull. If you have any comments or suggestions, then you get in
    touch with me in the following manner :
