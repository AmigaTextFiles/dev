                      Making a Multiripper disk
                      -------------------------

ù
    In order to create the correct kind of ripper disk that is featured in
these below tutorials, you must have a copy of Multiripper V3.00. This is
shareware, and an update can be acquired from the programmer at the
above address.

    The first thing for you to do, is format a new disk and install a
bootblock onto it. Then, make the drawer S, and copy the Multiripper program
file onto the root of the disk.

ÿ
ù
    You will then need to use a wordprocessor to enter the name of the file
you saved the ripper as, enabling it to boot automatically. In the archive,
the file is called MR30, and once this has been typed in, save it as
S/STARTUP-SEQUENCE so that the drive will boot it up.

    If you want to, copy the DEVS:SYSTEM-CONFIGURATION file into the root of
the disk, which enables Topaz 80, rather than the default Topaz 60 font.

    The rest of the disk is to be kept blank. No librarys are needed by the
program, so it uses as little memory as possible.

ü
                           Why this setup?
                           ---------------

ù
    A lot of games have their music files stored right at the beginning of
the memory block. When you reset your Amiga, this information is still kept
there, and the next program is loaded over the top of whatever was underneath,
without the computer knowing that it is doing so. Multiripper searches
through the memory of the computer to uncover music modules of certain types,
or decrunchers, which unpack vital information from games, such as tunes and
ÿ
ù
graphics.

    Multiripper is loaded right at the start of the memory buffer, enabling as
much memory as possible to be searched. If you have lots of programs running
beforehand, then the ripper is loaded further into the buffer, and your
chances of finding the modules that you want are very slim indeed. That is
why you only have the absolute essentials to boot the program. No DEVS drawer,
no LIBS drawer, as the computer can put these into memory, making the ripper
load further inside the buffer.

    It is also a good idea to have a couple of formatted disks ready, and it is
also a lifesaver if like me, you have a hard disk, and are able to pull the
power plug easily, as this wipes a lot of memory when booting in. If possible,
always try and use ripper with your hard drive turned off, then put the disk
in with the ripper. All modules etc. found can then be saved to disk, giving
you that extra 50,000+ bytes at the start of the buffer.

                           Why rip modules?
                           ----------------

ù
    A lot of programmers require various music tracks to include in their own
games, as they cannot write their own.

    They must say that they did not write the music, otherwise it is theft,
basically. It is also a good way to get hold of some pretty outrageous samples.

ü
                           What's to come?
                           ---------------

ù
    The second part of this tutorial explains just how to use the ripper
program and the third part gives you even more examples to work with, including
extracting modules from decrunchers stored on non-DOS disks.
