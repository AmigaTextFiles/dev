                            Format - Spectrum 128K

        Eeee by 'eck. Remember when this pointless animation series was on
    the TV? It's going back a few years now. Suddenly, all this Trapdoor
    stuff appeared everywhere, including the game, released by AUI
    (Alternative Software).
    
        You played Berk, the stupid blue blob with eyes, and all you had
    to do was keep up with the demands of "'im upstairs". He would request
    thigs like a can of worms, or boiled slimies, and you would have to
    work out the puzzles in the game to try and give him what he wants.
    
        To get the can of worms, for example, you would have to open the
    Trapdoor that all the horrific and comical monsters come out from in
    the series, and let a few worms crawl out, and shut it before some
ÿ
ý
    hideous or pointlessly insane monster comes out. You would then have
    to scatter round and pick up all the worms and put them in a can,
    before that stupid little grub-friend of yours eats them all. I cannot
    for the life of me remember it's name. It may come to me. Once you had
    filled up the can, you put it on the lift and send it up to "'im
    upstairs" and await your next order. I have just remembered, that
    thing is called Drut. What a stupid name?
    
        Sometimes, you would have to open the trapdoor and allow certain
    monsters to come out of it in order for you to complete your mission.
    For example, if he want's fried eggs, you have to let this stupid bird
    out, and run around with a frying pan to try and collect the eggs that
    it keeps dropping. Once you had caught enough, you had to fry them and
    send them up in the lift.
    
        There was one level, where you had to let this bouncing thing out,
    and make it land in a vat to juice some creature into a beaker. Wierd.
    
        As well as the good monsters, there were a few which came out
    which really got on your nerves, the main one being this stupid thing
ÿ
ý
    which shoots you with a ray-gun type thing, and transports you to a
    totally random location, messing up your game completely.
    
        The game can be really difficult to get the hang of, especially
    when it comes to getting him a can of boiled slimies, as you had to
    wade into this pool in the cellar, and try and catch these eye things
    that kept popping up in places. Really difficult when you first try
    and do it.
    
        Good points of the game, were the fact that you could launch Boni
    down the trapdoor, as well as Drut. Plus, the added bonus of when you
    get bored solid of the game (takes a very short time) you can kill
    yourself by falling into the trapdoor. Overall, I think I would rate
    the game as good for the first couple of times that you play it. After
    that, it get's just a little bit boring.

                             Game - Blood 'N Guts
                            Format - Spectrum 48K
                     Reviewer - Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett
    
þ
        Blood 'N Guts had to be one of the simplist games that there could
    ever be on the trusty ol' Speccy. You played the sprite of a kind of
    "Bionic Commando", and have been shrunken down and injected into some
    guy's body to try and rid all the virus' which were making him ill.
    
        The game was very simply put together, using the traditional
    Spectrum methods of creating huge maps - simply by sticking lot's of
    cloured spaces together to form the "Outline" of the part of the body
    you were in, with more detail paid to parts of the body such as the
    brain and heart. Every now and then, a part of the body would flash,
    meaning that it was being attacked by a virus.
    
        In order to kill this virus, you first had to find a "Vaccine"
ÿ
þ
    cell, which pops up every now and then for you to collect, and help
    you to kill this virus, rendering the part of the body well again for
    now.
    
        It had the classic Speccy 48K tune, consisting of what can only be
    described as pointless, random beeps of a varyied pitch and frequency,
    and only after a while of listening, could you determine that it was
    actually a tune.
    
        Although rather repetitive, the game was actually quite addictive,
    although a modern version would be a sensible idea, and could be done
    using AMOS. The graphics were simple and sweet, with easy detection
    between a virus and the so-called vacine pills. The diver-type bloke
    in which you played the part of was rather well detailed for a
    Spectrum, and all the different sprites had animation to them, which
    could be a rareity on the Speccy sometimes.

        Every time this game comes to my town with the fair, you have to
    cue for about 10-15 minutes before you can even see the machine, and
    that is no lie!! Move over Mortal Kombat, stand aside Outrun - Bubble
    Bobble is here!
    
        This has to be one of the oldest arcade games around, and even
    today, is still extremely popular with a hell of a lot of people.
    Basically, all you do is wnder around the screen, both Bub and Bob,
    shooting bubbles at baddies, and collecting all the goodies. Then
    why is it so addictive?
    
        There are endless levels to complete, and even on the arcades, you
    can be playing a game with one credit for quite a while. The tune that
ÿ
ù
    accompanys it is extremely familiar with most gamers, as it has been
    remixed and re-vamped so many times, everyone has bound to have heard
    it at some point in their lives.
    
        If you manage to get to this machine in the arcades, then check it
    out by having a good ol' play of it, and trust me, you will be hooked
    for hours.

        Kane had to be one of the best Spectrum games of all time. It was
    certainly one of the first "Split-Level" type games, in which there
    was a completely different kind of task to do on each level, which was
    what I think made it stand out from the rest of the crowd.
    
        The game consisted of 4 levels. The first was an excellent "Birdie
    Shoot" in which you had to shoot lot's of pigeons out of the sky,
    which would fly around at various different speeds. For every 3 or
    4 birds that you managed to shoot down, you would get a "Lif" to use
    on the other levels of the game. You had a limited number of arrows,
    and each time you shot a bird you got the arrow back, so you could
    literally go on shooting until all the birds were either dead, or had
    got to the "Home" marker.
ÿ
    
ý
    The second level was perhaps the most arkward level to play. The great
    train ride. You had to race your horse against a moving train,
    jumping over Cacti and other things such as hedges, until you managed
    to get to the front carriage and stop the train from moving. The third
    level was perhaps my favourite. The traditional "Shoot-Out" like in a
    western movie. You had to shoot loads of little bad guys, who would
    pop their little heads up from round the back of a door, a barrel, or
    maybe even a stagecoach. If you did not shoot them first, they would
    take potshots at you. The game also had an ammunition limit to your
    gun, and you would keep having to run to the side of the screen in
    order to fill your ammo clip with bulletts. The backdrop was very
    detailed, even for a Spectrum's graphic capabilities. The final level,
    riding back to Kane, was literally the same as the second level,
    except there was a whole load more obstickles thrown into it to try
    and stop you. The best thing about these 2 levels, was the fact that
    when you died, your man would fly off his horse, and eat the dirt.
    Much more entertaining than completing the level.

        This game has to be the best car-racing game of all time. Featuring
    8 different tracks, with 15 other drivers, and the ability to promote
    to a super-league, is an amazing setup for a game of this age.
    
        The actual game is made up of Vector graphics (solid lines and
    blocks), which make the game really stand out. The gameplay is very
    fast, with your car being fixed still on the bottom of the screen,
    if you turn or jump, the view of the track alters accordingly instead
    of the gar, giving it that extra feeling of realism to it. There is a
    real feel for speed here as well, especially when you start ripping
    those boosters along the straights.
    
        It may seem dead easy by sound, but trust me, it isn't. You are
ÿ
ú
    placed onto a track in the air by a crane, and you must race on
    straights, corners, holes, and huge mounds, at sppeds of over 200 MPH
    without barriers on the edges to stop you from falling off. What's
    more, you have a damage meter at the top of the screen, which
    increases every time your car is damaged in any way, wether it be
    from falling off the track, or taking corners too fast, or going over
    bumps and ramps at too great a speed. There is also a chassis damage
    meter, which creates big holes in the damage meter, and every time the
    line comes in contact with it, it skips past, making you absord less
    damage before you become a wreck.
    
        Each of the computer players have their own tactics for racing,
    wether it be to stop you from overtaking, which is a skill of it's own,
    to shooting ahead of you by miles on the track. Each skill has to be
    learned the hard way. Each track also has it's pitfalls, the most
    hardest to learn being the Stepping Stones, which consists of a
    high-off-the-ground square track, with 4 huge holes dug in one side,
    with just a few metres of track on each. If you encounter this at
    either 5 miles too fast or slow, your car is immediately written off,
    and smashed into a million pieces. Other great pitfalls, include
ÿ
ú
    slanted straights, in which you have to slow right down for, Huge
    drops, which you must ramp off at certain speeds in order to land
    safetly either further down to the ground, or across a small pitfall.
    Some of the most trickiest obstickles to master, are all the different
    ramps. The Big Ramp for instance, is a rather large jump, with a
    smaller jump in the middle. You must hit the first jump at exactly
    the right speed, so that the slowdown on the smaller ramp consists
    with the second smaller jump, and making you land to take the
    left-hand corner straight away. Major problems with this, are that you
    go too fast, miss the middle altogether, and land right into a wall, or
    you land over the corner, and fall off. The crane then has to lift you
    back on, allowing the computer to gain valuable distance in front of
    you.
    
        Cornering is the most difficult of all the obstickles to overcome.
    You have to learn where and when to either turn, or let go of the
    joystick. The best course for this, is the Roller-Coaster, which is
    also the fastest track in the game, and in division 2. This will teach
    you to take all the different corners available, with some of the
    fastest possible speeds. Other factors which you learn through this
ÿ
ú
    track, is the familiar bounce-around technique, which jumps you around
    the straights, and around the corners, which also takes a lot to
    master re-gaining control. The computer automatically centres the
    steering wheel whenever you let go anyway, but it is no use when you
    are going flat-out.
    
        The good thing about this game, is that you can practise on any of
    the tracks, in any of the divisions. In order to practise the
    super-league tracks, you must get into the super-league, which means
    coming first in Division 1 - a MAMMOTH of a task. It took me 2 years,
    a C64 and an Amiga! You can also save your division ratings, along
    with the best race+lap records, so you can load in a new division at
    any time. This is especially helpfull on the super-league. The
    super-league is entered when you reach the number one spot. The tracks
    and the drivers are the same, but a lot changes about the cars. Your
    car becomes twice as powerfull, with the damage factor being more mean,
    as well as the computer cars speeding up as well. You accelarate twice
    as fast, and you can reach an easy 350MPH without having to boost all
    that much. The counter can reset twice on these levels. Plus, you have
    to re-think your whole playing strategy's for each of the circuits
ÿ
ú
    again, for instance, on the big ramp, you can clear the middle bit, and
    land cleanly on the other side without going anywhere-near flat out.
    If you go round using your old speeds, then the computer is sure to
    shoot right past you.
    
        This is one car game that I definately reccomend to ANY car-game
    enthusiast, as it will keep you going for absolutely ages. It took me
    2 years on and off to master to the top of division one, and now I
    can't get any higher than the super-division 2.

        Commando has to be my all-time favourite Commodore 64 game. It is
    now a good few years old, but I can still remember running round to my
    mates house to play it for hours and hours on end. It even got to the
    point where I bought the computer off him, just to play this game. It
    definately ranks alongside Aztec Challenge in my all-time favourite
    list.
    
        Basically, Commando is a shoot-em-up, with some amazing gameplay
    and action. You had to work your way up to the main outpost, where you
    had to kill loads of different guys who would come running out. Many
    games after this tried to copy this kind of level play, but they were
    all abismal compared to this original. Armed with a machine gun and 5
    hand-grenades, you had to do battle in this hell-hole to the death.
ÿ
    
þ
        Another thing which really got me into the game happened to be the
    music, as it was so addictive. The in-game tune was so hip and
    happening, you could really groove to it. It sure made the best of the
    SID capabilities of the C64. Written by Rob Hubbard, who is renowned
    for making amazing music for many formats, with excellent samples of
    his work on the Spectrum on games like Escape from Singe`s Castle. The
    hiscore table music was also a nice and mellow module to keep you
    ticking over that little bit longer, to begin playing the next game.
    
        If I had kept my 64, I would probably be still playing this game
    today as I found it so addictive. I hope it is long remembered by many
    people all over the world !!

        Robocop was one of the many "Manufactured" platform games to come
    out on the C64. By manufactured, I mean have exactly the same gameplay
    as maybe 20 or 30 other Ocean platform games, but change the main
    sprite and some of the background graphics, and you have a new
    platform game to sell.
    
        Despite the above, the game did have the odd little feature added
    to it to seperate it slightly from the others, including some of the
    major bugs that were in the game. One of the biggest, was if you
    walked over to a wall, kept pushing in that direction and waggle the
    joystick up and down, you would walk straight through a brick wall.
    Bit of an X-File there methinks.
    
ÿ
ú
        The game had an amazing loading picture of Robocop's head, and
    looked as though it was scanned. One thing I like about all the
    traditional Ocean games, including this, Target Renegade, Wec Le Mans,
    and many many others, is the traditional loading format. It would
    kick in with the ever-popular Cyber-Load format, which consisted of
    the border lines changing clours as the information was being loaded
    in. Then, came what can only be described as the greatest EVER
    Commodore 64 loading tune, which was so cool. I used to stop the tape
    recorder on purpose just to listen to the loading music. Then, the
    picture would appear bit by bit in the traditional C64 way, at quarter
    of a character per time.
    
        Gameplay was not too bad. The sprites moved cleanly, and were very
    neat, and there were quite a few baddies to kill. Every time the
    computer loaded in a new level, then you would re-start from there
    when you died. You had to work your way through the streets, to the
    office of Dick Jones, where he had the old man by gunpoint. You had to
    shoot Dick several times to kill him, and complete the game.

        Remeber the old beat-'em-ups, before all the Super Nintendo and
    Sega stuff came along? Target Renegade is a class of it's own, both
    on the speccy, and the 64. You must guide your bod through several
    different levels, consisting of a multi-storey carpark, a street, a
    mall-thing, the park, and a barfight to kill the big boss at the end.
    You can go at this alone, or have 2 players on the screen at the same
    time.
    
        Different functions of the game vary on the 2 formats. For example,
    at the bottom of the screen on the 64 version, there is a face, which
    changes expression every time you get hit. This is not there on the
    spectrum. The spectrum version is also not as colourfull, as you can
    only have 2 colours in any 8x8 square, or else it crashes the colour
    scheme.

        The game plays very well on both machines, without it slowing down
    at all, even on the spectrum. Some large sprites, mainly different
    types of men, as well as dogs and motorcycles. One way the speccy cut
    down on sprite buffers was to give all the men the same legs. You can
    pick up the usual weapons, mainly baseball bats and pool-cues in the
    bar, and the game is different every time you play it.
    
        There are both sound FX and music on the 2 versions, the 64 having
    an ultimate soundtrack, whereas the speccy has an almost-as-good tune,
    but at a very low volume, familiar with the 128K music scene. No sound
    crashes crop up anywhere, so all is well here.
    
        If you are a beat-'m-up fan, and have not seen this game before,
    then I suggest that you get a copy of it. It is priced at around 3
    quid now, and follows very closely to the double-dragon games.
