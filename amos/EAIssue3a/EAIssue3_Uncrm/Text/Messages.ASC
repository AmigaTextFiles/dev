      Welcome to the messages section of this magazine. At the moment, I
     don't have all that many messages to give out at the moment, so this
    section is rather small. If you want to include a message to someone,
    then send it to me in ASCII form, along with at least one AMOS article
         that I can use in Extreme AMOS somewhere, to this address :

       If you include an AMOS article along with your messages/adverts,
       you will stand a greater chance of it appearing in the magazine.

      Text: Well Paul, I hope you like this issue, as it has taken me a
            while to complete. I have reviewed some of your latest games
            in the REVIEWS section, so that may generate a bit more income
            for you to spend on Newcy Browns !!
    
            Thanx also for the compaction routines. They have really
            helped me out this issue, as I have been able to squeeze a lot
            more pictures into the issue without having to worry too much
            about space available on the disk.
    
            Well, I best go now, as I have about 25 more articles to write
            before I get anywhere near completed. Hope to hear from you
            again soon !

      Text: Greets from the old Mushroom man. As you can see, after all
            that pestering that I did for articles, I still managed to get
            the whole thing together. As you may already know, I have
            reviewed a couple of your games, as well as included the
            screenshots that you sent to me, so maybe your licensceware
            game Contentious will make a few more sales.
    
            As soon as the upgrade to Contentious is completed, you must
            send me a demo and some more screenshots so I can look at the
            new improvements that you have made to it.
    
            Thanx for the review that you did on MMPlay. You did forget
            one or two points on the full hit, about the fileselector
            appearing when you go to load a module, and when you set a
            preset module. Speak to ya soon !!

      Text: Well Paul, I have finally managed it. After sifting through
            the thousands of SID modules that you sent me, and hours of
            typing in CED. Cheers for doing the review of Twinz by the
            way. I hope now that someone decides to actually buy it.
    
            As I have not got a working copy of WAC at writing this
            article, I can't really compare it to your magazine. Anyhow, I
            don't supose that I will get anywhere near as many registered
            users as what you have got. Still, I can dream I suppose!
    
            I managed to rip all 24 of the Koala images out of the C64
            demo that you sent me. I am currently trying to program a
            converter in AMOS, which is coming along nicely.
    
            Got to go now, but I hope to hear from you very soon ! In
            fact, I shall be talking to you in London when I give you this
            disk !!

      Text: I don't know if you have seen the adverts section, or the
            Usefull address section, but I have included some stuff for
            your PD library in there. Could you send me a copy of your
            catalogue disk, as I don't think I have got one yet.
    
            Thanks for doing some of the graphics in this issue, and for
            the Mushroom PD sections. The plaque really suits MPD to the
            ground. A new reader layout, with all nice buttons would be
            very nice, as I can't draw to save my life. Still, I can only
            try and do my best.
    
            I have to go now, and finish some more articles I have been
            working on. Hopefully I shall speak to you in London, Yes?

      Text: G'Day sport! Sorry I have not had the time to write to you,
            but I have been extremely busy in trying to get Extreme AMOS
            back on it's feet. Gary tells me you have found a program
            which suits your house inventory needs. I have been adding
            bits to the program I was doing for you, but have since
            learned new tricks, so if you want me to continue, then give
            us a yell.
    
            I hope you have no problems in running this issue on your
            computer. You will need at least 1Mb of RAM to run it, but if
            you ain't got that much mem, you should be able to use the
            seperate reader program.
    
            Well, got to go now, but I hope to hear from you soon with
            some articles from down under!! Toss a steak on the barby, and
            have a tinny for me !

      Text: Well, here it is. I hope you find this new and much improved
            system a much better and easier to use than the previous
            issues. Since Carl's demise from the EA team, a lot more work
            and effort has been put into creating this, as I don't have to
            rely on anyone else to provide valuable source for within the
            magazine itself.
    
            The goods don't stop here! Next issue see's the introduction
            of yet an even better text reader, which will allow text and
            images to be on-screen together, making articles much more
            interactive to read. I have not had enough time to develop the
            system fully for inclusion in this issue.
    
            Remember that EA is your disk magazine, full of the things
            which you would like to see in an AMOS magazine such as this.
            Please keep sending in your articles and suggestions, so we
            can keep improving the whole magazine. Please take the time to
ÿ
û
            fill out the questionaire form in the EDITORIAL/MORE section,
            so I can really find out what you think. No names and
            addresses are asked, so it can be sent in anonymously, if you
            have some really degrading comments to make.
    
            I would also like to thank all the people who have helped me
            this issue, by sending me in their articles, source, pictures,
            adverts and messages. I know that there is not many people
            involved at the moment, but I am hoping that will change now.
            I will also introduce new sections, full of pen-pals who are
            looking for new AMOS contacts of their own. If you want your
            name and address included in this, then drop me a line with a
            couple of AMOS articles, and I shall pop you in there.
    
            The fourth issue, and the first non-Shareware issue, will be
            available on May 12th, and it will feature all the info and
            news which I collected at the "World of Amiga" convention,
            where I will be hopefully attending with Paul Gumsley and Paul
            Burkey, providing all goes well. I will be there with my
            "Mushroom PD" and "Extreme AMOS" T-Shirt on, as it has my
ÿ
û
            address and E-Mail no. on it, so if you see'd me, then you
            know I was there. To order your next issue, send me a cheque
            made payable to "Andrew Kellett" to the Mushroom PD address,
            which in case you don't know, is :
