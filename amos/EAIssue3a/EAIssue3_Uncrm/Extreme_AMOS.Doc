Dear Reader,
        
    Hello and welcome to the third Shareware version of Extreme AMOS. Written 
and programmed entirely by Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett, of Mushroom PD. This 
little document has been placed here to give you a brief idea of what is in 
this issue, and exactly what is going on in the world of Extreme AMOS.

    The first thing to say is that Carl Drinkwater is officially no longer in 
the EA team, due to lack of contact amongst other things. For a full brief on 
this, read the article EDITORIAL/MORE/EA COCK-UP where everything is 
documented.

 REQUIREMENTS
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    EA doesn't need all that much. It will need the MATHTRANS.LIBRARY in the
LIBS: drawer, and the CrM.LIBRARY for the Crunchmania run-time decruncher to
work (if you are using the floppy version). The programs on disk 2 for
creating EA articles will also need the AMOS.LIBRARY which is located in the
LIBS drawer of disk 2, as well as the Assigner program in the C: drawer of
disk 2.

    Lot's of new and improved changes have now been made to the magazine
engine due to the fact that I have had a lot of time to work on it, unlike 
the second issue. The program will now allow you to look at colour pages of 
text and graphics, which eliminates the use of the sad old scrolling text, 
which was all in one colour. You can now look at both graphics and text 
using the click of a mouse button. The graphics are packed with an AMOS 
compaction system named Squidger, written by Paul Burkey. A demo of this 
program, along with examples and source, is available from the library on 
Mushroom disk 58.

    This issue see's a heck of a lot more articles than the previous 2 
issues. There is over 300K of articles in this issue, and has took me ages to 
write them all, although the little help I did get was a relief. All text and 
data files were crunched using Crunchmania 1.7, to save me space on the disk. 
Executables were crunched using Stonecracker. As well as the articles, you 
can choose from 3 different music modules, and have access to over 30 
different screenshot files, which pop up in different articles. We have a 
very big tutorial on using Multiripper 3 by Jellyfish/D.I.D, typed out by 
myself, which also includes some example games of which you can rip the tunes 
out yourself, as well as advice on getting at other game tunes. We also have 
lot's of classic and modern reviews, covering many new AMOS games, as well as 
classic games written on other machines such as the Spectrum and Commodore 
C64. Screenshots from the games also come from some of the new reviews.

    Disk 2 is also very packed. We have another game from Paul Burkey named 
"Shroom Backgammon" which is absolutely amazing graphics-wise, and the source 
code for the river ripple is in the library under the GRAPHICS section. We 
also have over 40 AMOS programs for you to use straight away, and only 2 of 
them are AMOSPro only, so everyone can use them. There are also three 
programs for allowing you to create your own articles for use in future EA 
articles, should you wish to colour them in yourself. There is also a copy of 
the reader that is used, which has been cut out from the rest of the program, 
and had all the turbo extension commands taken out of it, so it could be 
compiled in the AMOSPro compiler, as the filerequester looks nicer. It is a 
bit slower than the magazine version, as I have also left out the locks etc. 
It will also allow you to read all the articles if you only have 512K which 
is nice for all those Amiga 500 owners !! There are also 2 indenter programs 
for converting ASCII files to EA readable files. The uses for these are 
documented in the article GETTING INVOLVED.

    If you are a HD user, you can get your disk 1 of EA in the form of a
large archive, which unpacks all of the data to your HD unpacked without
Crunchmania, so everything loads in quicker. You can exchange your Issue 3
disk for this, by returning it to me. This is only available if you have got
your EA3 Floppy version from me directly, otherwise you will need to send an
SAE and a disk marked "EA3 HD version". This option is available from issue 3
and upwards only.

    Well, I think it is time I should be finishing this article. If you would
like to contribute to Extreme AMOS in any way, then feel free to contact me 
at the above address with anything you want to include. The next issue is the 
first non-shareware issue, and all people who's articles I use will receive a 
FREE copy of the first issue they appear in. Full issues of EA will cost £2 
in the UK, and £2.50 anywhere else in the world, to cover the extra postage. 
The fourth issue will be available around May 15th, so get your orders in 
now.

    If you want to advertise some of your AMOS products, then why not send in 
some IFF or text adverts? Even better, send me a shareware version of the 
program, along with some IFF screenshots, and I will see about getting it 
reviewed. It may even appear on the coverdisk if I like it lots !

    Until the next issue, I shall see you later !

            Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett & Millie T. Cat.
