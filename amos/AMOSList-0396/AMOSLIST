Someone named Sewards (I think) was asking if his proposed quality AMOS
RPG would make him any money:

 Don't do it for the money, or you'll end up one among a legion of disgruntled
 shareware authors.

 Actually, I think in the UK the "License-Ware" market could possibly maybe
 perhaps allow you to make a small amount if it's real good. They have this
 large gaming crowd there which is virtually non-existent stateside.

 You might talk to someone who has actually made some money this way. Shane
 Munroe (author of Scorched Tanks) comes to mind. Ben Wyatt's excellent
 efforts should have netted him sommethhing if he ever tried to sell them.
 The german author (whose name eludes me) of that monkey-island RPG (whose
 name eludes me) wrote the list saying it wasn't selling well.

 Oh yeah, that was Parrot Island.

 Bottom line: if you're going to write it, write it firstly for the fun of
 it, secondly for the experience, and thirdly (if at all) for the money.

 Well, actually I'm doing it for all of those things, hopefully with some cash
thrown in. :) But I suppose how well a product sells depends how one markets 
the demo version. If, for example, I sent a demo into Amiga Format for inclusion
on their coverdisks it would be reaching many people who would essentially be 
FORCED to take a look at it. Don't forget, on the Aminet, people make a choice
of what they actually download and a small .readme file could never tell anyone
how good a game is. I mean, who wants to take the risk of downloading a muli-
megabyte game which could be a load of rubbish? 

 A good example of success by coverdisk inclusion is Brian Bell's 'Charlie Chimp' 
game. This was on the AF coverdisk and he sold over 2000 copies of it. The fact 
that it won the Gamesmaster AMOS competition is entirely irrelavent. People were
inclined to look at it because it was 'just there on the disk' and consequently, 
many people liked it and bought it. 

 As for the Licenseware option, I'm none too happy about the way companies like
'F1 Licenceware' treat the people who send in programs. For example, if one sends
a program into F1, they only give the programmer 1ukp for each sale. If they charge
4ukp for a 1 disk program, they are making 3ukp on each sale. A cheap disk should
only cost about 20p at the most and the labels are probably printed in bulk for 
an extremely low cost. In the end, F1 are making at least 2.50ukp on every sale.
Of course, this would be more if the program was on more than one disk. What is
it? 25p to the programmer for each additional disk? Taking this into consideration,
if a program was on 5 disks, and F1 sold it for 8ukp, they would be making a massive
5ukp if not more on each sale! This is, in my opinion, explotiation. 

 I will take everyone's comments into consideration (Send me more!) because, after
all, you are the sorts of people who would be buying it in the end. :)

L8r,

CS.

P.S. The comments about F1 are my own and if anyone wants to argue with me, send me 
a private message at my address and I'll explain why I feel this way. Thanks.

Don't expect a game to sell loads just because it's on a coverdisk. I've had
5 coverdisk releases so far and the orders that I recieved from the coverdisk
release only range from 10-100. This shows that it depends on what the game is
like, how your demo version is crippled and how much you are charging.

If you do want to make money DONT give a full version away!!!!!! I've done
this once and only got 3 registers.

NOT because of the coverdisk but because of the competition!!!!

As for licenceware, if you want to make money don't use licenceware.

Hi all!

I'm often silent (cause I'm still new to the Amiga) but thought I'd finaly
speak up after this long wait...and long move to California...

1) I DID get the Amos 3-D running on my 1200 finally! Nice...hope I can 
use it with Amos Pro.

2) Still looking for Amos Pro Compiler *sob*sob*...

3) Thanks for keeping many of your responses geared toward 
beginners...I've been programming for more than 10 years, but only 1 on the
Amiga...so every bit helps! (hehe I'm punny)...

4) My NEW address is xenotech@sj-coop.net

[Whitby AMOS Club]
I was wondering the same thing ... I did his intro titling and he has used
quite a few of my articles and code but the last I heard from him was issue 6
last summer, August I think.  His issues were always late but he had quite a
bit of support and I thought he'd hang in there, and I was surprised when he
didn't do an Xmas issue.  I wrote him in Nov but no reply.  I thought he tutor
series on RPGs was good.

So it looks like the only club left is AMOSzine, 3 disks per issue, and very
well done, issue 10 was the Xmas issue.  Do you need an address for them?
CYA,
-Chris.

The best shot at licenceware is "F1 Licenceware" in the UK, the owner Steve
Bye used to be on this conf but has unsubsscribed recently, likely because he
usually checks his e-mail once a week or so, and if you do that you end up
with about a zillion List messages, probably blew away his BBS time limit :-)

But he does a good job of marketing if he accepts your work, and where many
marketing companies get floods of complaints he gets next to none.  You hear
back within the week about whether the quality is good enough, and what price
range you are beiZxng slotted into.  Go with what he suggests, he knows what
he's doing.  All the F1 stuff advertised in the UK mags is his company.  He'll
send you a demo game is you want to see what level of quality he expects.  To
touch base with him his e-address is below, and give him a few days to reply:

steve@dcancy.demon.co.uk

NEW INTERNET SOFTWARE STORE

There is also a new Internet store called Albert's Ambry that has set up a Web
site 2 months ago where users can download a demo of your program, and if they
like it they can enter their credit card number and then DL the whole program.
AA keeps 20% of the sale amount.  They sent authors their money every yearly
quarter, and if you want to see how your sales are going there is a Web page
to look that up.  If you want to do this they send you a legal agreement to
sign which states that they have exclusive Internet sales rights, but it
allows the author to market in other areas like Compuserve, so I don't really
see the point of it.  And you agree to support users questions or problems
with the software, and if you don't and AA gets complaints, they have the
right to refun2oÔÛŒÿm=‰8œ›¬P@Ö√´™\HX'jªB“˝öﬂ≈˝q’

Sorry dudes, my message about software marketing got cut off, but I think it
will go through.  I was just about done anyway, but here's the rest:

If AA gets complaints that you haven't supported purchasers, they could refund
the money to the buyer and debit your account.

Anyone had any experiences with Albert's Ambry?

Subject: Help:iff format
Status: RO
X-Status: 

I'm wondering if there is any way to peek the RGB values of an AGA screen
in AMOS.
The screen is 640 x 512 Hires with 256 colours.
Amos is unable to open a screen of this many colours.

My next option is to actually read the IFF file directly and figure out the
indivdual colour (RGB) values from the file structure.

I then wanted to dump the values to the screen or to a file.

Has anyone done something similar before? Does anyone know if this is
possible? Is there any programs which will peek these values?
HELP!!!!!!

If Andy's been good enough to send out his Intution extension to us, I'm

It should have been up this week, but for some weird reason, my modem keeps

Hi!

Is there a *program* which is capable of converting an AMOS program into
a plain ASCII file? My new monitor does not allow me to run AMOS, and I would
like to obtain a hardcopy from some of my programs. If the program can also
do a ASCII to AMOS conversion, I'd be very happy.

Maarten

(Please note: an executable *program*, *not* by choosing the correct options
from within AMos (1.36)).

Yes, you can. Check the 'Latest News' in help menu (In AP 1.12). if yo=20
have problems, contact me.

Btw, the Amos 3D sucks, but there's nothing better available now..=20
Somebody should write a new 3D-extension!

I have never heard of a amos channel, but logically it would be #amos.=20

Hi there, I was wondering, how exactly does Amos draw circles, it doesn't
seem to use the math functions(sin, cos), when I try to do a circle using
these functions it looks real ugly.  I need to draw a circle manually, but
a good looking one.

I used this code to draw my circle:

Degree 
Circle 60,100,15
For I#=0 To 360 Step 4
X=16*Cos(I#) : Y=16*Sin(I#)
Plot 100+X,100-Y
Next 

Any help would be appreciated.

Yep, it's possible, and it shouldn't be too hard, just open the file, look
for the palette longword (Which I can't remember off the top of my head,
COLS, Or CREG, or something like that - should be quite obvious. Then the
colours are stored in order, as simple RGB numbers!

I THINK! :)

Try something like this:

 For I=3D0 To 360 Step 4         (use Step 1 to get it more good-looking)
 X=3D16*Sin(I) : Y=3D16*Cos(I)
 If I=3D0 Then Plot 100+X,100-Y : Else Draw To 100+X,100-Y

Hi!

I'd need a procedure that 'Clips' a drawn line to the screen.
Amos crashes when my program draws >10000 pixels long lines, and the Amos=
=20
Clip command doesn't help.=20

The procedure should work line Draw command, and it should use variables=20
XMIN, XMAX, YMIN, and YMAX to set the drawing area.

Can anyone help?

	This is a routine which uses second order differences to generate
the circle. Notice that this does not use any sin or cos functions.

Proc Circle[RADIUS,XC,YC,COLOR]

  X=0
  Y=RADIUS
  D=1-RADIUS
  DELTAE=3

          Inc X
      Else
          D=D+DELTASE
          DELTAE=DELTAE+2
          DELTASE=DELTASE+4
          Inc X
          Dec Y
      EndIf
    
      Plot XC+X,YC+Y
      Plot XC-X,YC+Y
      Plot XC+X,YC-Y
      Plot XC-X,YC-Y
      Plot XC+Y,YC+X
      Plot XC-Y,YC+X
      Plot XC+Y,YC-X
      Plot XC-Y,YC-X

  Wend
END PROC
  
Notice that this employs 8 fold symmetry and can in fact be optimised even
further by keeping 8 sets of coordinates and incrementing or decrementing
them accordingly.

You should try to implement a binary search of coordinates along the line 
in question. The routine should follow this method:

Check boundary conditions-- If its totally in, draw the line
                            If its totally out, discard it
      
If one endpoint is in then
Recursively discard segments of the line--
  (Can be implemented with a while loop)
  Find the midpoint of the line inx,iny-->outx,outy
  Is that point within the clip region?
     If it is, temparily adopt that as the new 'in' point
     If it isn't then adopt it as the new 'out' point
  Recurse until one of the coordinates equals one of the clip coordinates
Draw line using the final point 

If both endpoints are out but a line segment is in then
  Binary search the line to find a point that resides in the clip zone
  Find endpoints using a technique similar to the one above
  Draw the two lines

Exit



Either that or you can simply write your own line routine and not plot points
that occur outside of the clip plane. There are several good line algorithms
that can be used such as Bresenhams algorithm for line drawing which only
uses incremetal integer calculations.

This might help, if i can make it fast enough.

I'm doing this in Amos and for line vector graphics, so it should be 
_fast_.

Not in amos :(

There is a formula doing the clipping perfectly, but i can't get it 
working in all corners of screen. Here's a quick ascii version:

Blimey, that's old isn't it! :) I think it was something to do
with the people involved with AMOSpro wasn't it? Tells you
things about them or something. 

Actually, it's not a bad idea, as well as making a list of
optimisation tips, we should send in secret codes/tips
and hidden features etc. (If there are any!) and make a
big list for downloading. :)

Giday Ville,

I downloaded your underwater.lha and the animations were great!!  
unfortunately I could not try the game because I only have amos the 
creator. Would it be possible for you to get the games and stuff for amos 
creator, or is this an impossiblity?

Thanks,

BEN CROWL

Well you just send it to the coverdisk department of the magazine. They
sometimes have a contact address in the coverdisk pages.

As for rules, they don't really have any major rules. Basicly the smaller
the better so cut down on the samples etc... You should really aim for
the 200k mark unless it's amazing.

All my coverdisk releases were written in AMOS and they were:-

Picturesque       ; graphics utility
Peg-It            ; puzzle game
Jelly Othelly     ; board game
Sneech            ; you must know this one :)

Some appeared on more than one magazine and one (jelly othelly) appeared
on the same magazine twice!!! for some strange reason :)

Sneech has sold well over 300 copies while Jelly-Othelly has been on
AUI magazine twice, and has sold less than 50 copies. Jelly Othelly
only took a couple of weeks to write though so I'm not too bothered ;)
One think it does show you is that coverdisks don't sell games for you!!

My last game Piles'o'Tiles never made it onto a magazine coverdisk although
I consider it one of my best games. Although with no coversisk release it
has still sold more copies than most of my games.

Cheers!

 Help! Lost my Compiler!

 I just finished a new beta version of CommBatt and started to compile it
for testing when what should happen? Disk Error: <Filename> not found.
That was hard to belive because I was compiling form the program listing
and it was telling me that <Filename> what I named the output file was the
program that could not be found. Anyone ever hear of this?
 Okay before you ask yes I tried other programs. They all did the same
thing except when I tried to save to floppie and not Harddrive the compiler
just locked up everytime.
 The only thing that has changed sence the last time I used it was I tested
PowerBobs and the Newest AMCAF demo. Okay thats not all. Here is
everything I had installed when it stopped working.

PowerBobs Demo version      
AMCAF Newest Demo version <--
Tome Updated for Pro      <-- The only things NEW from last use.
Range Updated for Pro     <--
EasyLife Latest version

New 1942 Commodore Multisync Monitor <-- Well this is new also.

 I removed everything except the monitor and it still will not compile. I
also noticed that I had to reinstall all the error messages in the Editor.
When I installed the Compiler Update they became empty somehow. I even
removed all Commodities for my system before trying the compiler because I
had changed a few and still nothing. Anyone have an idea? If all else fails
I will backup all the examples, procs, libs, and source code I have
gathered in the last five years and reinstall Amos all over again.
 Please help me before I spend a whole day archiving everyting again
clearing my harddrive off and ReOrging my drive and then reinstalling!!

Yes I had this problem once, I ended up replaceing the compiler-config file
in S directory I think??. Anyway after that every thing seemed to work fine.

I just got the Compiler (great!) and I had also installed the
latest AMCAF demo version. After removing PowerBOBs and AMCAF
everything worked fine again. With me it wasn't disk errors,
but screen flashes and lockups and I was extremely low on
memory. Perhaps because you can't compile AMCAF-programs, or 
because PowerBOBs needs you to press enter if you've got the 
demo version.

Sorry, Jeff, that's exactly what I have been doing last Saturday.
It works, though. With me there was another problem, that of AMOS
not being correctly installed on my HD. I had to let the compiler
reorganize backups of my AMOS disks and then reinstall AMOS again.

Please, AMOS wizards, help poor Jeff, we've all been waiting for
Commbatt (well, I have).

Good luck,

Marco.

If the games use AmosPro commands, they don't work with Creator.. so you 
might get them working if you replace all Pro-code with Creator-code 
which does the same thing. Otherwise it is impossible.

..but what if i'd compile the games you want?

Ahhh, my favorite topic, money :)

Well it depends on who uses your program and what their current payment
rules are and what restrictions YOU put on your software.

Amiga Computing paid 150 for each program that was in 1991 and 1995. AUI
didn't pay anything for any of them :(

If you tell them you want to be paid money for your stuff then they will
pay, but then again they might not use it if they have to pay. Years ago
I remember seeing adverts in magazines offering up to 1500 for a single
coverdisk program!!! I'm sure they get enough offers for free stuff these
days so they seem to have stopped giving away that sort of silly money :(

As payment goes, you should expect to get more money from Registrations
that you do from a 1 off magazine payement so thats the main reason for
sending programmes to them. I haven't had much luck with 'game based'
magazines up till now so maybe a game on a games magazine would do
better than a game on a more serious mag :-/

You also find that they sometimes go from PD games to shareware utils to
commercial demos to "exclusive give aways" so there are times when a
magazine won't even consider what you have.

We should have a competition to see who can make it onto a magazine cover
disk from now!!!! Everyone should send their programs off now and we'll
wait and see what happens. I haven't bought an amiga magazine for a few
months so if anyone can look through a few and send some addresses and
details into this list we could all have a go :)

It would be cool if two or even three of us shared the same disk :)

cheers,

You might be interested in another coder in CA ... Rudy Sanchez in Coronado,
quite active, we've shared some projects, but he doesn't have e-mail yet.  If
you want his address or phone let me know.

I wrote the above answer, but I should have waited a couple more days, because
I just got his issues 7 and 8 in the mail ... he must have heard us talking :)

Issue 7 is 2 disks, and 8 is one disk.  With issue 8, WAC is becoming
licenceware under 5th Dimension Licenceware run by Saddletramps PD, and will
cost 2.95 UK pounds per issue.  He doesn't have e-mail yet but plans to, but
he wrote that he has got some things cleared up so he has more time to devote
to WAC, and has big plans.

I just got these issues in the mail and haven't looked at them yet, but when I
do I'll put a note on the List about what's on them.  WAC's address is:

Paul Gumsley
5 Lockton Rd.
Whitby, No. Yorkshire
UK    YO21 3NB

Nice idea, but will fail on strings larger than 255 characters and will
create a lot of mess when the string already was 0 chars/bytes long...

Better use:

S=Varptr(S$)-2
P=Deek(S)
If P Then Doke S,P-1

Hi Carl,

I guess we spoke too soon ... did you see my message the other day that WAC
has mailed issues 7 and 8?  Anyway Paul is back at WAC, and has got 5TH
Dimension to market WAC as licenceware, for 2.95 UKP.

Steve has turned the editor job over to Andy Gibson in Scotland, here's his
address:

Not sure which source you mean ... my school game Night Math Attack is in the
MISC/EDU dir of Aminet without source, but everything else I've done for mags
or whatever shows the source.  Anything in particular you're looking for?

I am having a game marketed by him. So far his work has been very efficent
and quick. IMO, he's very good.

Keep a look out for the demo version of Borisball in game/demo soon!

Finally got all the pieces together and put a cheesy raycasting demo at

out my Web page below.

When you get it, write me and tell me how many FPS you get, and all that 
other hardware stuff--mainly, CPU speed (020 33mHz, that stuff), and the 
amount and type of Fast Ram you have (4 meg, 16-bit, for example).  If 
you break 15 FPS, write me ASAP and tell me your specs.

One note--there is no machine language (because I don't know it for the 
Amiga), and I can scrape along at exactly one FPS.  Its very 
exhilirating.  (PS:  No baddies!)

Depends on how good it would be. If it would beat the original Amos 3D, 
it could be commerical (i would probably pay for a better version of 
Amos 3D if it were shareware).

Subject: Flood filling with a bob image
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Hello all

I'm having a few problems in getting AMOS's Paint command to use a bob
image to fill with. The AMOSPro manual says this should do it :

   Ink 15,0 : Rem Or Ink 15,1
   Set Pattern -1
   Paint X,Y

But it treats it as a monochrome image, using only the ink and paper colours
to draw it.

Any ideas anyone?

Even better would be a routine that replaces a certain colour in a screen
with a bob image or another screen. Is this possible with some clever
Blitter commands in AMCAF, or something...

 What is the magor difference in internal structure between standard

 Does the "CMAP" repeat, or is all colour data just placed after
 it's first occurance.
HOw would you determine the colour of each individual pixel.

  I'm sure there's real documentation somewhere; just look at the source of
any IFF ILBM read/write program, or pull out the Includes/Autodocs RKM.

  There *is* no difference.  They are one and the same format.

  Um, no... what do you mean?  The CMAP chunk stores the RGB values of each
color index.

>HOw would you determine the colour of each individual pixel.

  The same way you'd determine the color of a pixel on a screen: get its
color index (done here by loading/uncompressing the file), then look up the
red, green, and blue color values for that index.

Hi Carl,
[source on Web page]
No I haven't done that, I've sent a bunch off to the clubs over the years,
routines to do this and that, but not enough to deserve a Web site :-)

[WAC]
That's strange you haven't heard from him.  His target date for submissions
for issue 9 is March 19, so I'll be sending him some stuff in a few days, and
I can tell him to shape up.  Have you paid for an issue that you haven't got? 
Issue 7 is still the old price of 2.50 UKP but with #8 they're licenceware and
it's 2.95 UKP.  Give me your address and I'll pass that along too.
Major contributors get complimentary issues, but I always send a pound for
postage, cause clubs have gone broke handing out freebees and trying to absorb
the cost of disks and postage.
From me he
he's using mostly animation effects, rather than code, because that's what I'm
into now, but anim files are large and often hard to fit on club disks.
TTYL,
-Chris.

Does that mean that the only difference is the number of bitplanes?
My documentation (Abacus books -Amiga graphics inside and out) only covers
the earlier (85) standard. It's information, I suspect, is even incorrect
for that. Following it's information, I get complete garbage trying to get
info off the file of it's picture size.

Basically, my machine can't do AGA. So, my only way of getting data from
the file is to read directly off it's file format. I'm not trying to
display it, just get the RGB value of each pixel.
Does anyone know how to uncompress the IFF format to get the RGB value of
each pixel in Amos?  My attempts have failed miserably.

The amcaf extensions protracker routines will inform you about the end of
the song with a special value of the =Pt Signal function.

A demo version of amcaf is available from aminet/dev/amos

Note that the amos music extension noisetracker routines will play on
pattern to far.

Hi2all - I'm Mike Drummond from Rosendale, New York. Ben Wyatt couldn't
get the set pattern -n command to work.  It seems to work okay for me.
Ben, did you remember to "Get Sprite Palette"? You're not using colour
registers above 15, are you? I got correct colour in all resolutions.

Elie Messo wanted to know how to tell a track was finished playing. (I 
assume he 
means one tune in a multi-mod.) Even with Paul Reece's Music Extension, there
doesn't seem to be a handy way.  The only hack I can think of is to set a volume
level in the last block to some unique value, and use Vumeter to check for it.
Yuck.  In fact, music in AMOS is a sorry subject.  I got MIDI to work, though.

Yes, I've made sure of all that. It only fills using the first two colour
registers. :-(

Some people were wondering how serious F1 are about licensing their
programming efforts. As far as I can see quite serious.

My editor called asking if I were willing to write a review, as the
deadline for the next issue of Amiga Magazine is nearing and they
still have a few pages to fill. Apparently F1 had been flooding his
desk with review copies of the software they sell. So in the next issue
there will be a review of Magic Paint Box (not by me, BTW) and
hopefully my review of The Graphical Adventure Creator (GRAC 2).

The packaging looks nothing special, but you notice that at least
some care has gone into it.
On the front of the manual it says: "Recommended retail price of #6.99,
of which the programmer will receive a 25 % royalty payment share from
F1 Software."
The two disks used are TDK.
I estimate that P&P (I don't know if it's included in the price, though)
would run up to somewhere around #1.75.

As the deadline is approaching rapidly (Amiga Magazine had originally
hoped to use the space for a review of the Surfer package, but
apparently AT is giving them the cold shoulder [not just them though,
the package still isn't for sale]) I invite you all to send in comments
you might have about GRAC 2. I cannot give you a mention or pay you for
any help you might give. The only reason I ask for help is that I
cannot hope to explore the program fully in the time I have left for
writing the article.

Anyone out there got any ideas on how to read MS-DOS discs from AMOS ? I
guess one have to make use of the trackdisk.device, but I`m not really into
this stuff.

In addition, I have CrossDOS, but I have forgotten where I placed the
manuals. (Bogger!)

If U have CrossDOS its no problem to read PC-DOS disk (except it must
be disk formated to 720 kB ,if U dont have high density floppy drive 
in Amiga).

Simple use device name PC0: to read MS-DOS disk from DF0: and its all.

If U want read text file using Input commands from pc format U should
use Set Input 13,10 first.(on Amiga -> Set Input 10,-1)

    Best Regards :)

If you just mount PC0: through crossdos then all you have to do is refer to
the drive as PC0: instead of Df0: I'm sure there are numerous "difficult"
ways of doing this, but why make life hard?

I've not fully thought this through, but you could do it like this (I think!)

Make the bob 6 planes deep, and draw in the top colour (ie 63, hence all
bitplanes are filled)

Then Draw the bob, with the mask set to the screen colour, (Ie, you'll have
to work out what bitplanes are required by each colour - not too hard!)

I think this'll work!

  All rights reserved By Pascal Felique.  Author of RIL multimedia language.


Did you know that it is possible to write a full-working interpreter in AMOS !!

I have written my own language in AMOS. I have called it R I L . 
RIL stands for Reduced Instruction Language.
RIL is especially designed for developping Multimedia applications. In very
short time you can write powerful applications with only a tiny space of code.

  Example of new improved zone command :
 ---------------------------------------

  Z (x1-y1) (x2-y2) (action,parameter,mousebutton) 'filename'


This instruction creates a zone at coordinates (x1-y1) - (x2-y2)
The zone will be activated by mousebutton defined in "mousebutton".


  0   Reaching Zone (clicking not necessary) will activate action

  1   Left button activates action

  2   Right button activates action


"Action" specifies the action that will be executed by activating the zone.

 Possible actions in RIL environment :


  0    load other RIL application

  1    load RAW sample   ( optional parameter specifies Kherz)

  2    load MOD file     

  3    load MED file

  4    Load IFF file

  5    Load IFF animation ( optional parameter specifies amount of repeating )

  6    Load Text file in window

  7    Dump Screen to printer  ( HARDCOPY )

  8    Print ASCII Text file to Printer specified in PREFERENCES

  9    Exit Action


  " filename" specifies the appropriate file that has to be loaded.


 The commandset of the RIL language is very flexible. You don't have to
 use the exact notation.

  Examples :
 ------------

  The following 4 lines are all correct in RIL environment :


    1       R(20-20)(620-230)

    2       R    ( 20 - 20 ) ( 6 2 0 - 2 3 0 )

    3       Rectangle (20-20) (620-230)

    4       Rechthoek (20-20)(620-230)

  Only the first CAPITAL LETTER will be evaluated, then the interpreter
  searches for the bracket "(" and so on ....

   This is ideal , it can be used for multilingual purposes :

   for example :  

    Rectangle (x1-y1) (x2-y2)      (english)
    Rechthoek (x1-y1) (x2-y2)      (dutch)
    
    Line (x1-y1) (x2-y2)    (english)
    Lijn (x1-y1) (x2-y2)    (dutch)          

    Ink (FFF)                 (english)
    Inktkleur (FFF)           (dutch)

   
  I have also written a Graphical RIL editor. You can draw in it, and
  specify zones on screen. Add actions to it. The Graphical Editor produces
  code in RIL format.

  send me some E-mail :

  Amos users who are interested in the IFF format might be interested in 
  the documentation I have :

   - I have some listings in Amiga Basic for reading an IFF file without
     using the "graphics.bmap" file. I have it from a dutch book :

     " Werken in Amiga Basic  Data Becker Holland "

      In this book there is also a chapter which explains the inner workings
      of the IFF graphic format ( CMAP ; CHUNK , ... )

      If a lot of you are interested I will put an english  translation of
it on       the mailing.

In the Amos Interface language you can define an EDIT ZONE:

Can this Edit zone be larger than one line.

IMHO is no way to set more than one line in ED interface command.

Re IFF RGB values

By converting an IFF file to a SCUPT file (which is uncompressed) and
reading it as a HEX file in DirectoryOpus the RGB values can be read. This
sound long winded but it works. Any comments?

`Fraid not! You'd have to have loads of edit zones, and flick between tehm
with TAB. If you look at the old Amal Editor, that had a reasonable code for
a small text editor. I too tried to write my own language in AMOS, called
MISC (MultImedia System Creator.) and the editor was based on the AMAL
editor. MISC worked very well BTW, but I abandoned the project due to boredom!

I'd like to introduce myself.  My name is Neil McKnight, I live in Albany,
Western Australia, and I have been using AMOS since v1.0.  Whya have I not
joined to list until now?  Easy - Albany is at the edge of the net, and I
wasn't the first to join either.

Anyway, I've been reading the AMOS list files from Aminet to get up to date
with what is happening with AMOS, before I had to ask silly questions which
you would probably already have answered.

Because I have no knowledge of assembly, I must thank all those who have
provided little snippets over the last year or so, as I have found them to be
most helpful.  I would never have worked them out for myself.

My current project is a Point of Sale, inventory and stock control program for
Amigas called "Poswiz".  See biz/demo for a demo of version 1.  This is a
commercial product.

As I use a plain AmosPro v2.0, without any of the nice extensions I have since
heard of, I created my own interface routines using standard AMOS commands.
The total code size of Poswiz v2 is presently just over 750k of source and it
is almost finished.  Screen shots will be uploaded to Aminet soon.

I would much prefer to keep using AMOS as long as possible.

If there is anything that I can be of assistance with, let me know.  As I have
said, I have done considerable work with GUI routines (not using AMOS
interface), disk handling and other areas of general programming.  Although I
have written a few games, they are not my stong point.  Look for Elevators.lha
or LaserRace.lha for examples if you are curious.

I have coded a lot with Amos 3D, but i have not yet have been able to 
make a working ground routine with all rotations. But if you're moving 
only in 2D space (like cars or boats), you have to draw ground yourself
with Td Background.

How does a McExtension sound? ;) That's the name of the extension I'm 
working on and
it will have gourad & texturemapping polygon filling commands ... 256 
cols... Probably won't be finished until xmas'96 thought.
Gourad shading works already (on AGA screen of course)...

This sounds fantastic, will it have c2p routines or write to planes?
Would an imagine 3.0 object converter be a good idea, It would save writing
an object editor.

Also another graphics related area I'm interested in would be a viewer, 
converter for Fractle image compression. This is a resolution independant
bitmap that can store a 24 bit image (works best with photo graphs in 5-10k
If you want lower quality then it's possible to save a 24 bit image in less
than 800bytes, that looks resonable on a 320x256 screen.

There are plenty of progs for the PC, also a viewer which is a Netscape 
plug-in If we had a A-rexx version of the same thing, then not only 
IBrowse, but also Scala etc. could be able to view these files.

The makers of this math compression method are Iterated Systems Inc.

You have to see this to belive it..

(Remember Blade Runner? Zooming in on a photo which contains more information
than it's scanned resolution..

If Everyone on the net used this for images (WWW) it would speed up
considerably, making screen image quality for graphics take up the same
bandwidth as text.

I'm just interested in the maths behind it too. I think the maths is'nt too
dificult, but to di it fast is a trade secret (from itereaated systems)

Subject: fine grained movement

Hi all!

I do have a question, and I hope someone can help...
For a game I'm programming, I have modeled the movement for a car as follows:

The car has variable speed, say 0-10

When I move the car north (0 degrees):
I multiply the speed with 1 (angle-modifier).

When I move the car northeast (45 degrees):
I multiply the speed with 0.5 * sqrt(2), obviously

For coordinates I use fixed-point maths.
So I store in a table the calculated angle-modifiers (sine of angle)
For readability I have used a factor of 1000 here instead of
a large power of 2, which I actually use.

degrees  x_movement y_movement
   0           0      -1000
  45         707      - 707
  90        1000          0
etc.

Ok, what happens when my car moves at speed 1, direction northeast?
Assume (startx,starty) = (100,000 , 100,000)

x: 100,000  100,707  101,414 102,121 102,828
y: 100,000   99,293  98,586   97,879  97,172

On screen this would result in the folling coordinate list:

x: 100 100 101 102 102
y: 100  99  98  97  97
      
dx:   0   1   0    1
dy:  -1  -1  -1    0

Which of course causes a jerk in the movement and THAT is the biiiiiig
PROBLEM. I don't want that jerk in my movement. :-(

However, after bumping my head to a wall for days (after having tried
numerous other solutions, like moving 1 pixel every n frames, where a
is a variable depending on the angle and the speed),
I come to you for help! I'm desparate...
When I look at a game like Super Cars 2 or Nitro, or All Terrain Racing
I __never__ see the jerk movements in these games like in my own game.

Why-oh-Why?

Regards,

Yours desparately,

Jan Lubbers, student AI

  You might try rounding instead of truncating the values:

x: 100 101 101 102 103
y: 100  99  99  98  97

dx:   1   0   1   1
dy:  -1   0  -1  -1

  Just a thought...

Hi all. I'm making a musicpack, and want to have a timer showing the play-lengh
of the module currently beeing played. Now, I've got this so far:

        B=Timer
        B$=Ct Time$(B) : Rem AMCAF command.
        Text X,Y,B$

But it won't jump back to 0 after it has hit 59, it continues to 60 and further
on, like this:

00:00:59
00:00:60
00:00:61
00... and so on. See? How do I make it work like a normal timer/'stopwatch'?

Welcome to the zoo.  Were you ever a member of the Aussie AMOS Club? I sure
liked their newsletter.  Used to e-mail the Code Clinic editor Jason Hutchins
a bit, now he's into E and C.  Francois said the club had 2000 members at one
time.

Are you aware of the 2 AMOS disk clubs in the UK ... WAC and AZ?
CYA,

How can I call the Amos routines such as Screen Open from within a

Thanks in advance.

Yes I was when it first started - I still have a few newsletters laying about
somewhere...  I think I was member #103 or such, but that was a LONG time ago.

I've been pretty much isolated here since the world began, and had to work out
everything for myself.  Although I could code before I got AMOS, I have got a
lot better in last 8 or nine years :)

Once I wrote a program for Video Libraries in Amiga-BASIC, that was used for
about 4 years, until the library was finally closed down.  It used an A500
with 2 floppies and could handle 12000 movies and 8500 members.  That was back
in 1987.

I realise the above is not strickly AMOS related, but the following is:
Poswiz v2.0 - a point of sale, marketing and stock control program, is almost
complete.  A set of screen shots will be available soon, and there is always
the demo of version 1 on Aminet to give you an idea.  Of course it is written
in AMOS PRO v2.0

Pet peeve - only being able to open 9 files at once (not 10 as stated in the
manual), make writting a database handler interesting.

I am willing to supply certian routines if anyone would like them.

Hi there.


Just to say I'd LOVE a copy of the FAQ you mention. 

Also I'd like to say I'm working on an AMOS megagame at the moment called
Darkness. It's got 3 layer paralax, rotoscoped animations, megabytes of
levels, gratuated backdrops, gore, blood and extremem violence !

FBN-D21u.lha

A new AMOS game based on the old text-style adventures!  Features a verb 
vocabulary of over 35 words and an unlimited noun vocabulary.  Point and 
click interface for the local user.  Solo, Modem, or Null Modem game 
options.  Eight different game maps already.

Dungeon V2.00 is an adventure game with a twist - you can play it over 
the modem against anyone with an ANSI compatible term prog.

With its modular design, it's easy to create a new dungeon (dungeon 
editor still under development) so you can go from a medieval castle to a 
spaceship.  Or how about recreating your favourite book or movie?

Grab Dungeon V21u from aminet, or, send me mail and I will attach a copy 
for you.

A quick question t
hat I've been meaning to ask:

I have a program with a huge amount of cutting and pasting in the code,
ridiculously bad programming that started when I first got Amos and is
too far goone to correct now that this dusty project nears completion.

I'm running out of space in the text buffer, there are simply too many lines of code. "Set Buffer" does not seem to do a damn thing to fix this. Any suggestions ???

If I understand you right you're trying to enlarge the text buffer. You can 
do this in two ways:
1. In one of the menues there are a command to set the text buffer. Enlarge 
it by 10k and you will have some room for more lines.
2. To always have a larger text buffer you can set this in the interpreter.

The command <Set Buffer> allocates memory for variables. Not for sourcecode.

I hope this will help.

I'm looking for the AMOS AGA expansion, and also EMM (I think),
the music/sound expansion. Could someone please tell me:

1) Where I can get them (duh)
2) Can AMOS AGA provide 16 colour dual playfield screens (ie two
16 colour screens dualled together)?
3) Does it support AGA sprites?

Thanks for any help. Email would be appreciated in case I miss any
replies....

Any suggestions ???

Have you tried including your procedures?

Ie. Get all the "Dusty" procedures, that you're no longer working on, put
them into another program, and Include them (AMOSPro Only!)

I've been trying out ModePro and find it to be quite good at promoing 
different screens.  However, I seem to be unable to get it to pick up 
AMOS screens.  I would like to be able to promote them to PAL whilst my 
WB is in NSC.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks!

Hi!

I have made release versions of 'Coordinates' and

Hi folks.


I'm using AMOS Pro v2, and am having some Variable-related problems. 
I am programming a Flashback style game and am using a variable _LOOP that
controls the Animation algorithm. However, this variable seems to be a dud!
Whenever I "Inc" it, its value remains the same, whatever I do to it! It's
vital that this variable can be incremented, but it refuses to do so. It
just stays at a value of 1, unless I specify another value for it. I have
had this problem a few times and its REALLY getting to me !!


Help !!!!

Cya on IRC sometime. Bye !

What's Reboot and Xena? Never heard of them here in Germany :-(

I'm quite surprised to find DS9 in your list and not TNG ;-)

TG> Now for some questions:
TG> 1) Do all ECS machines come with 1M chip as standard?  I think so, but am

Yes. All (true) ECS machines come with 1 MB of chip mem... You shouldn't
really care of machines with less than 1 MB chip mem. ;-)

TG> 2) Is the Jd extension shareware?  I can't read German (I had to use an

The JD extension is FreeWare AFAIK.

TG> 3) Is there anyway for the screen copy command to make colour 0

TG> wrong though).  I have tried the various mask combinations to no avail.  
TG> I think its because it doesn't use blitter area A.  Currently I'm

Try this one:

Load Iff "dh1:grafik/dpaint/picture/misc/A500.iff",0
Wait Vbl 
WX=Screen Width : WY=Screen Height : AC=Screen Colour : PL=Binlog(AC)
' Target screen
Screen Open 1,WX,WY,AC,0
Curs Off : Flash Off : Paper 0 : Pen 1 : Cls 
Get Palette 0
' Temporary bitplane 
Screen Open 7,WX,WY,2,0 : Screen Hide 
Curs Off : Flash Off : Paper 0 : Pen 1 : Cls 
Blitter Copy Limit 7
' Create mask: 
Blitter Clear 7,0
For A=0 To PL-1
  Blitter Copy 0,A,7,0 To 7,0,%11111100
Next 
' Change background of target screen 
Screen 1
For Y=0 To WY-1
  Ink Y/4 : Draw 0,Y To WX,Y
Next 
' Copy with mask only
For A=0 To PL-1
  Blitter Copy 0,A,1,A,7,0 To 1,A,%11110100
Next 
Screen To Front 

It first creates the mask of the picture and then copies the parts with
are not transparent to the target screen.

TG> 4) Is it possible to save a portion of the screen to a bank without 
TG> compression? I'm asking this because it would be faster on '000 machines

TG> degrade to '000 anymore at home.

Well, you could simply try the following.

Procedure STOREPICCY[scr,bank]
  OLDSCREEN=Screen
  Screen SCR
  WX=Screen Width/8 : WY=Screen Height : AC=Screen Colour
  PL=Min(Binlog(AC),6) : RES=Screen Mode
  Reserve As Work BANK,WX*WY*PL+16
  ST=Start(BANK)
  Doke ST,WX : Doke ST+2,WY : Doke ST+4,AC : Doke ST+6,PL
  Doke ST+8,RES
  For A=0 To PL-1
    Copy Logbase(A),Logbase(A)+WX*WY To ST+16+A*WX*WY
  Next
  Screen OLDSCREEN
End Proc

Procedure EXTRACTPICCY[scr,bank]
  ST=Start(BANK)
  WX=Deek(ST) : WY=Deek(ST+2) : AC=Deek(ST+4) : PL=Deek(ST+6)
  RES=Deek(ST+8)
  Screen Open SCR,WX,WY,AC,RES : Screen Hide
  Curs Off : Flash Off : Paper 0 : Pen 1 : Cls 0
  For A=0 To PL-1
    Copy ST+16+A*WX*WY,ST+16+(A+1)*WX*Wy To Logbase(A)
  Next
  Screen Show
End Proc

Haven't tested this, but it should work...

TG> I have a few more questions but I think I'll keep them for latter.  I'm 
TG> getting close to that 4K limit.  I'll keep my postings short in the 
TG> future if there are any complaints.

Oh, I think you shouldn't really care about that 4KB limit for you really
got some nice questions hehe ;-)

Erm? I think both extensions are quite well suited for speeding up
programs, however I guess amcaf has more non-graphical commands?

First, thanks to everyone who replied to my last post- I got too
many replies to deal with individually, but YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE..
:D

Now, the nasty question. I'm reliably informed that the AGA expansion
does NOT provide a twin 16 colour dual playfield display, even though
the AGA architecture supports this screenmode. So the question is, can
I fool/trick/bully/bludgeon AMOS Pro into opening such a screen anyway,
given that once open the architecture should handle the screen transparently
to AMOS?

Possibilities:
1) After opening the screens and dualling them, reformat the screens
from 8 to 16 colour without alerting AMOS... (ouch!)
2) Somehow kill off the error checking that stops me dualling two 16 
colour screens (double ouch!)
3) Rewrite the Dual Playfield system from scratch (yeah, right!)
4) Open the screen through Intuition, then hand it over to AMOS somehow. (Hmm.)

Any suggestions? As before, Email would be preferred.

Terrence:
	AMOS wedges itself UNDER the AmigaOS and becomes an OS of it's 
own (notice the OS in AMOS?).  You'd probably have to write code 
specifically to adress this, I'm not sure.  Maybe someone else can help.

This isn't a solution to the original problem, but has anybody seen
the new OS friendly extensions for AMOSPro?  I seem to remember reading
something about it in AR and seeing it in c.s.a.announce too.  Supposedly
you can write completely OS friendly programs in AMOS with this extension.
Is it true?

I am using Amos Pro. The Set Input command will let me indicate whether the
text file being loaded has both a line feed and a return cahracter at the
end of each line. Lovely. 
     But when Amos saves a text file, it always saves the line feed and
return character. I want it to save in the Amiga format, with just the line
feed. Is there a command to make this happen?

Is there any specific IRC server to connect to as I tried a few on Saturday 
23rd March just after 22:30 GMT but I couldn't find #Amos. Did I miss it or 
what?

Quick Plug while I'm here:
Visit my web site (URL below). It is mainly about Panik software and our 
products. You will be able to download them and do loads of other things too, 
like how we slag each other off! It will also have a section on Amos soon.  
The site is under construction at the moment so I apologize in advance. Most 
of it should be ready in a week or two (If all goes to plan).

astonishly simple...!  Just do a...

	print #1,a$;chr$(10);

or equivalent, puts it into amiga format.

I recently tried a program from Aminet called RemDate on my A3000 
(NTSC).  When I ran it, the bottom part of the screen drops off the 
bottom of my monitor screen (and yes, my monitor is properly adjusted).  
Is this one of those AMOS programs or is it just a PAL screen?

Right now I'm having problems getting PAL screens to display on my A3000 
due to recently installing an IV-24.

Any help greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Well, I was hoping to use this message to announce the FBN website being

You can still get there: http://www.waterloo.net/~joehick/

When I call AmiNET, the files show up in a list that you can click on in 
AWeb, but they aren't FTP.  Does anybody know how they do this?

Anyway, all the FBN files (all written in AMOS (See, it IS amos related)) 
are there.  You'll just hve to tell your browser to download it as a 
file, not an HTML document.

Well met and godspeed,

I've had the same problem, so I searched through the list of screen

which will create a screen, however, I never found out the syntax...

Hi folks !

Just a little message to tell you that my program Collector (entirely 
coded in AMOS) is available on Aminet (gfx/misc).

It's a picture catalogger like Piczoo, Picview or ImageDesk...

Give me your opinion if you try it ! ;-)

Bye !

Hi Chris,

That's the big problem, it's no longer being published by Europress and no one
else has taken over the rights, altho' plenty have tried, including the editor
of the AMOS Club USA, and I think Steve at F1 in the UK tried too.  So unless
Francois gets his act in gear the pirates will be in charge soon.

If you want Easy Amos I have it on an Amiga Format coverdisk for $3.00, it will
get you started.  AMOS Pro was on a later coverdisk but was a crippled version,
but I don't have that one.

I've had the same problem. After searching a month and phoning
several companies, and getting help from F1-Licenseware I ended up 
with:

Exclusive PD
7 Beresford Close, Waterlooville,
Hants
PO7 5UN
(0705)642409
United Kingdom

I could order by creditcard and got AmosPro 2.0 for less than
20 English Pounds. Even though I live in the Netherlands, I got
it within a week.

Greets,

Marco.

It already has c2p routines ;) Only 2x2 and 2x1 pixelsizes at the moment.

Hello there everyone.

Basically, I wish to ask all of you a favour..  

ANYONE who has either BOUGHT the "Enhanced Music Extension" for AMOS/AMOSPro
*or* have
seen it advertised - could you PLEASE drop me an email detailling where you
got it, when, and
how much it cost.

I'd especially be interested if it is being sold in the UK or other parts of
Europe at all.

Your response much appreciated (in private email please - I dont subscribe to
the amos list)

Regards,
Paul.

Hi, all
I'm just putting the finishing touches on my web page. Groan. It's taking
longer than expected.
You can check it out, as it has an amos/amiga page.
Not all the links are fully working yet. They should be in about a week.

Thanks to Andy Church, for the Web space.

A while back, someone asked about a file requester for amos.  I've just 
finished a file requester (no amos interface or fsel used) which has the 
following features:

Pattern matching
point and click to change dir, pattern
double click to select file
slider bar
uses NO mouse zones, so it can easily port into any program

If anyone is interested, let me know.  It's only about 9k.  Would it be 
too large to uuencode and post?

Well met and godspeed,
