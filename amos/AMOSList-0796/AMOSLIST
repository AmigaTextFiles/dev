I found out, that the Kick 3.1/Amos Pro-Interlace Bug only occures on AGA
machines. Interlace definately works on A3000 machines with Kick 3.1.

However, you might have problems with the AMOS Editor creating some
bus-errors, which will hang the machine for some ms. Use Dtack to avoid
this.

I'm sure you're aware about this will only work on 320 pixel wide screens.
If you need some other sizes for screens and don't want to use mulu, why
not create a table of the y-offsets forehand? ;-)

You're not writing into the bitmap of the screen but to the screen

Because L_GetEc wants the screen number in register d1, and if d1 contains

extension v1.1 and I haven't got any kind of problem.

What you say seems very strange and I don't think Powerbobs can be the
reason. BTW, when does your Amiga crash? At Default command or
running/loading a program, or just when it wants, while you're typing a
program?

Are you using the registered version or the demo?

As long as I know, version 1.1 is the last and it's dated 26/01/1996.

Hmm, I've hunted around a little bit, but no trails on the Aminet could be
found! I can only assume the beta's wandering around lost in the jungle or
disappeared without trace in a bog somewhere.

	I've also been getting my head around learning the EasyLife structured
variables, which hold great promise. They certainly make coding a
roleplaying game more versatile, but I would like to know what methods are
used to quickly locate an instance in a stack. With an array, it's easy:
element x's value is known at all times. If an rpg game has an inventory of
1000 objects, object #753 can be instantly accessed by x=inventory(753).
But with a stack of structured instances, only connected to each other
sequentially using a Next variable or something similar, it looks like you
have to work your way through the stack until you come across the object
you want, which seems like a lot of valuable time lost. Translating a mass
of arrays to a pile of structures isn't quite so straightforward as I first
thought. Its like the difference between old 8 bit BASICs using line
numbers (eek!) and AMOS.

	Does this mean I need to define a second structured variable to act as an
index to the first? Or are there some techniques for data access and
storage I should know?

Hello,
I`m making a Football Manager game and I have to make fixtures for the matchs.
Every year there has to be a new League draw.
There are 18 teams and 34 weeks to play.
Does anybody has any idea how to do this?
It seems easy but I`m stuck with this from about two days.

I`m looking for something to encrypt and decrypt files to use in Amos does it exist?
I`ve readed that there is a music extension called EME,where I can find it?
I would like to know if there is site were I can found some programs from the Amos PD library.
Thanks in advance for all replys!!

Hellow Folx:

Thanx to you guys that mentioned the Commands in Amos Craft for:
Crypting, Decrypting and playing modules.

But i have installed Amos craft and i dont get any errormessage on the
loading of AmosPro, but when i try to write in an Amos Craft command
all the Letters are turning to big letters and i get a Syntax error.

Well, i tryed to run AmosPro_TURBO_plus.lib and i got this error:

 AMOSPro_TURBO_Plus.Lib
Program failed (error#80000004).
Wait for disk activity to finnish


Suspend               Reeboot




So my best guess is that the AMOSPro_TURBO_Plus.lib is not working
and that's why the Craft messages dont work from Amos.
Does anyone else have a betther Guess??

Well can you folx pleez thel me if it is a Amos Craft version out there
on the net or something witch has the Mem scramble Mem Unscramble and
the module players commands witch i dont have to register??
Pleez let me know where i can find Amos craft closest to Norway!!

Oki, another question as some of you already know i am planning to code
a music disk but i am limited to only 16 col in Hires and that suxx.
So what if i got a pal of mine witch codes in blitz to code a file witch
only shows the picture in 32 or 64 cols and if i load that file into the
musicdisk with the exec command will that work??

To Chris:
Nope i cant say i got your message over the Mailinglist, but
i got the Email and ofcoz i'am interested in the Amos 3D coverdisk.

You should get and install APME14 form aminet. It lets you choose what
extensions to load when amos is booting, thus you can soon find out what
extension is causing trouble. It's great for this sort of problem. It's
also great for loading extensions that occupy the same extension number.

More specific to your problem: Powerbobs was programmed by the same guy
that wrote Turbo. Turbo has a lot of problem trashing the stack. Perhaps
its using similar code.

Hi Mike, had some list messages to Conan bumped, guess that was the reason,
didn't know the e-address changed.  Is it permanent?

Oops, I was sending List stuff to the old address @Conan ... but I see the new
one at @Access ... so you should get this.  We can move this into private
e-mail when you reply ... use my first address below.

Yes I have 3 of the original AMOS 3D coverdisks for sale, with the pages from
the mag that have the commands and tell about it.  Also I still have Craft I,
Imagine 2, and DevPac Lite.  The first disk is $3.00 and each one after that is
$2.00, shipping included (I'll pay shipping).

> Joust let me know how to get it.

If your bank charges a fee for Interntional Money Orders don't do that, I'll
take a personal cheque to save you the fee.  Are you in Norway? ... you can
write me a personal cheque in Norwegian currency that is equal to $3.00 CAN.
My bank lets me cash interntional cheques for no fee if under $100 ... so make
sure it's under that :-)

If you'd like references from people who have bought stuff from me I can give
you several e-addresses to make sure I can be trusted ... several AMOSers from
this list too.

BFN,
-Chris.

Roy, if you need that AMOS 3D coverdisk I have 3 left for sale, $3.00 each. See
the other message on this List to Morten about the same thing.  If you can do
e-mail use my first address below.

Hi Everyone,

Just heard some knews and tho't I'd pass it along.  Steve at F1 says Andy is no
longer editing AMOSzine, the premier AMOS disk club, and Steve has taken back
control.  They might publish another issue if enough stuff comes in.

Haven't heard from Paul for a few months at the Whitby AMOS Club, so don't know
what's happening with him.  With issue 8 WAC became Licenceware.

Mark at AMOS Club USA is not sure whether he will publish another issue.  He's
the only one with e-mail, at:

MSchult@execpc.com

BRN,
-Chris.

Chris is both reliable and fast.  I got the AMOS 3D disk from him a while
back and had no problems with it.

For AMOS Pro, remember to use the AMOSPro_3D.Lib in slot 4 and copy the
c3d.lib to apsystem.  Also copy the xfont to your fonts dir.

Well met and godspeed,

Status: RO
X-Status: 



Hello,

I want to tell you a new bug found in AmosPro (and probably also in Amos).
If you have a Every X Proc you cannot use Wait Y if Y=>X otherwise the
program stops to the wait command.

For example:
   Every 2 Proc _WHATEVER_I_WANT
   Every On
   ....
   Wait 2

This code will stop to Wait 2 and cannot go on.


I don't know if it was already know or not, but I thought it could be
interesting. BTW, is there a way to avoid this problem? I could use
   Timer=0
   Repeat : Until Timer>100
but it isn0t very nice: any other way?

Bye

You could think about a Read/Data system. You could store the matches in

this
form:
Data 1,2,3,4,... where it's Team1 vs Team2 - Team3 vs Team4 - ...
Data 1,10,2,18,... where it's Team1 vs Team10 - Team2 vs Team18 - ...

Get Craft extension: it has this kind of commands.

I don't know, but I think you should see AMCAF before (just if you have got
AmosPro!): it has got a great music system.

Well, I think you are confusing Craft extension and Turbo extension: these
are 2 different extensions; Craft is commercial and you have to buy it,

Turbo
is shareware but you can get a demo version from Aminet (dev/amos).

The scramble/unscramble commands are of the Craft extension; the Turbo has
other kind of commands to replace the standard ones with faster.

Yes, it could work well: even if you have to use Blitz. :-)

Howdy chaps,
        Any suggestions on this one? Its me with the old Easylife
structured
variables again. I'm finding that the AMOSPro Compiler abandons a
compile that contains any Easylife commands in it, claiming
"Extension not loaded". Now I've made sure everything's installed
properly, and I even tried adding the Easylife.lib and Easylife.library
to the Compiler's system files. I've already emailed Paul Hickman
(creator of Easylife) and he replied
 
> I seem to remember from when I last used AMOS (A long time ago now)   > that the compiler uses the RAMOS.Env file instead of the normal
> environment - so you have to install the extension into that           > interpreter configuration as well. I don't have an AMOSPro compiler so > I have never tested it.

Any bright sparks out there with any other clever suggestions? I don't
really want to go back to AMOS just to get SV's, gorgeous as they are.

Have fun

This is true for several leagues, for example the Bundeliga and the Spanish
league. This means that, for every season, only the numbers assigned to each
team (and possibly some of them) changes.

In these cases, it is better if the fixtures are stored on a file, then you
can read it different types of fixtures and differnt teams for different
seasons and leagues. This is how my Football Manager works.

The problem is: what happens with other leagues, like the Italian and the
Premier League?. I don't know the reason, but they don't follow the same
rule. In this case, you have to manage to get the proper number for every
round. In these cases, some programs need to input the correct match
(see SuperLeague v4.01 in Aminet as an example, made in AMOS).

I hope this helps

Hello,
I`m making a game using amos and the Easylife extension.
I saved my variables in a bank with bsave.
Now I load the bank back but I don`t know how to insert the data in variables another time.
I want to use this for a Load/Save option.
To put the variables in memory I`ve uset the elmem from Easylife extension.
And here it's ok.
The only problem is that I make a list with about 100 names divided by a space.When I load back
the bank I don`t konw the lenght of the names so the all get wrong.
This is the code I used to load them back:

Reserve as work 5,10000
Bload"MyBank",5
X2=0
ADRESS=Start(5)
For I=1 to 100
   X1=5
   IM$(I)=Elmem$(ADRESS,X2,X1)
   X2=X2+Len(IM$(I))
Next I

With this only the first name comes out wright,from the second they all come wrong.
I think the error is in the command X1=5,the problem is that I don`t know how to get the length of
the name so I can load it in the variable.
Advanced Thanks!
ByE

Yup, that's right.  Turbo Plus was taken over by Black Legend in the UK, and
they market it under the name Craft II Turbo.  Craft 1 is a different
extension.  Black Legend has an e-mail address that I could look up if anyone
wants it.

I have some Craft 1 and Craft II Turbo coverdisks left if anyone is interested.
 Plus Imagine 2 and DevPac Lite.

Several people answered the solution to this problem. For example,
Pietro Ghizzoni (author of the GUI extension) wrote in May 96:

Then, you can recompile the Compiler_Shell.Amos program and use the new
executable to compile your AMOS programs.

Mike, perhaps this has to be included in the FAQ.

I hope this helps

That's always been the method I use. Not very nice, but at least it works!

Sure, here it is:

I haven't used it for many months so hope it works.  If you want to write them
it's:

Black Legend
Fulling Mill Barn
Fulling Mill Lane
Welwyn, Hertshire
UK     AL6 9NP

They told me that they sell a more complete version of Craft 2 than was on the
CU Amiga coverdisk ... bigs fixed and works with all AMOS versions.

Ok, I have asked for some help on writing an extension before, but I have

        move.l  T_ScreenAdr(a5),a1

        lea     MyCols,a1

Where CALLGFX is my macro to call the gfx library from my extension.  There
are no errors from Amos, but the palette of my screen isn't changed.  HELP!! :)

Hi guys!

...here there are 2 useful programs for you! :)

First Aswitch.... this little CLI program (84 bytes) put amos to front. This is
useful when for some reason the amos editor is locked to back, and you haven't
saved the source code of your program!  (it's happened to me, and it's very
irritating!)


begin 644 aswitch

G@&<6($`J:`!8<@$@;?_X3J@!(#M\``#_<$YU($%-3U,```````/R#
end
size 84



And now a nice procedure! Do you have locked a procedure, and now you want
modify it? No problem! With the UNLOCKPROCS procedure ALL the locked
procedures of your program will be unlocked!

..this is my version:

Bload "MyBank",5

   IM$(I)=Peek$(ADDRESS,100,Chr$(32))

I haven't tested the program, but it should be OK :)

..hang on..  dja mean there is a NEW version of Amos 3D I havn't got ??

I hate going back to the old machine and kickbacking it to 1.3 and forcing
it to use the 68000, forcing the hard drive not to work (AFS/020vsn), and
using floppies every time I want to use the editor..

Good job I don't use it much these days.

Subject: Overriding the maximum screen size
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Hello!

This may be a dippy question, but does anyone know a way to override the
maximum size of screens? I want to open a screen bigger than the maximum
size of 1008 pixels - somewhere around 1500 pixels is the size I want.
The height isn't too important - that needs to be 200-400.

OK, so I could build the screen up with blocks/icons and scroll with them,
but that would be too slow and rather clumsey for what I want to do.

Surely there must be a way of getting rid of the screen width limit - it
does seem to be a rather pointless boundary. However, it probably requires
hacking away at the amos.library so I won't be surprised if I don't get any
answers!

Thanks!

Hello Folx!

Yeps it's me again, the one ho has been bugging ya all on this list
with the Crypting problem. (Morten Bolstad)

I have been so stupid and i finally found a another solution to my
problem here one day, but i dident get my idea to work fully coz of my
lack of Braincapasity and programming knowledge, but here is my idea:

reserve as work and bload the text file into an bank for example bank 1
and save it as an Abk file. So long everything oki, but when i load the
Abk file and prints it with: print Chr$(Peek(start(1)+I));
the lines are getting fucked up and they isent in line like the normal
ascii text.

So here is the code i need (no extensions)
The one who codes the Fastest,Easiest to understand and the Best rutine
Will get credits for their work in the finnished production (musicdisk)
and the musicdisk sent to them.

I need:


a way to successfully put an ascii text into an abk file and print it
correctly on the screen from the abk file.

the lines must be in order as it was in the original Ascii text.

If it's possible it would be much bether if it was possible to use
the text command to print the text instead of the print command coz i think
the print command leaves a square around the text and then it would look
shitty with the gfx behind and a square around the text.


the text i am planning to use is max 40 characters wide and
so it would be nice if you could leave a way in the code to change
the x and y cord of the text.

also it would be nice if you made it so if you pressed the right mouse
button you printed 40 char wide and 15 lines down and if you pressed the
right mousekey again you got more text and if you pressed the left one you
got one page back 40X15).



Oki here i try to sum it up as easy as possible:


* Save an ascii file (40x???) to an ABK file.

* Load and print the text from the Abk file in Amos using the text command.
  The lines must be in order as in the original text file.

* A system so if you press the right Mousekey  you go one page forward witch
  consist of 40x15. And if you press it again you go another page forward
  and so on.

* A system so if you press the left mousekey you get one page back and so on.


I am still looking for an Music Extension for AmosPro is there any usables
out there witch i dont have to register. ( I'am very Poor)


I graitfully welcome any help on diz one!

I think you need to include a bulk of procedures. There are no actual
commands, JUST procedures!

You'd be better off to get the GUI extension from Aminet...

Hi everyone,

Just a quick message to ask if anyone has any source code of a "Columns" 
type game.  I would be very interested to look at the code that checks to 
see if there are any blocks that need to disappear.  

...also...

did anyone see that game on the front of one of the AMIGA Computer 
Magazines a short while ago called "Egg" something.. I'm not exactly sure 
what it was called but it was apparantely made in AMOS.  Please reply if 
you bought a copy of the magazine with this on it.  It was similar to a 
falling blocks type game, but with little eggs. 

Thanks all,

L8r

I have it, and I'm also beta testing the new version.

Yep. Or at least, the next version will.

It's something like SCREEN_HANDLE=J Easy Load Iff(FILE$). That will load any
picture from 2 colour lowres, to S-Hires HAM.

> and BOBS? I'm desperately needing this!

No, not bobs. Nothing on this planet can give AGA bobs to AMOS. :-(

Yes, I bought this.

I don't have any source for a Columns game, but I have written my own version
of that "Egg" game - it's exactly the same, but it's not on the Amiga.

I can't remember the rules of Columns, but with the "Egg" game, you need to
join four or more blobs together in any formation. If you want this code,
let me know!

I think you'tr talking about SuperFoulEgg by IMPACT. Actually I haven't got
that magazine, but that game is also present in the CD version of
AmigaFormat
of July.

It's made in Amos the Creator and I must say it's very nice and addictive.
You can play also against the computer and the hard level is really hard! I
think it's a very good game!!!

While writing a program I discovered that the INPUT command doesn't

just erased, does anyone know about this bug or have a fix to it. It 
is kind of important for the program that I am writting to be able to 
accept commas.

Thank you for you help!

Hello everyone. I am just writing to ask everyone if they are interested 
in giving a little support for my new Diskmag. It is currently in the "Making 
issue 2" mode. The engine is programmed in Amos (my native language!) and the 
Amos section is a bit bare at the mo. Please could any of you help with a few 
articles and copyright-free code. 

If anyone is interested in obtaining the completed copy of issue two, in the not 
too distant future, then you will be able to obtain it from the address below. 

I'm only able to read replies today (18/7/96) and tommorrow from this e-mail terminal,
please send your replies, after these dates, to my snail-mail address.

I could do with some backup on this project so please help me out. Free copies for
multiple contributors.

Address: Entity, 25 Denness Place, Llandudno, Conwy, Wales, LL30 2UX.

E-mail (back on sept. 1) : jono@yjblib.demon.co.uk

I hope some of you can help, goodbye friends ;)

...use Line Input instead of Input!

Ex: Line Input "Enter some text ";A$

This method works fine :)

This is not an Amos bug. :-)))

You have to use Line Input command instead of Input.
Input can accept several values separeted by commas, instead Line Input
accept several command separeted by a Return.
I think you should use always Line Input as well as you should use Line
Input# instead of Input# for the files.

Hello!

If i'am not mistaking the replayer library plays all kind of Protracker
modules perfectly, thats what i have been told by some peoples so my
question this time is if some of you cool guy's out there knows how to
use replayer.library to play the modules from Amos Pro instead of the
built in player???

The music makers for my productions are pissed at me coz the built in
player tends to fuck up a bit in the modules some times.


Also, do anyone know a trick to use 32 cols in hires??
remember there is also going to be some text written over the 32 col
gfx so it can't be to slow.
Any successfull way to do this with 2 screens or so??


I graitfully apprisiate any answer you might got for me!

Well, that might work, it's been a year or so since I programmed AMOS
the last time, but it'll probably only work if you have activated the
*-matching from some commodity or other program. In standard DOS you would
type delete ram:data/#? and I would think the same goes for AMOS.

I'd use Exec "Delete <>NIL: Ram:data/#?". A bit messy, but it works!

Hi Dudes,

Marten and I wanted to know if anyone has found a problem running AMOS 3D or
Craft 1 and 2 on a 1200?

Also, are the coverdisks the complete versions of these?

Thx,

	Unfortunately, AMOS can not deactivate the Double Buffer system once
activated.  But there are two ways around it.  First of all, you can set
the Autoback to a 1 or 2, 2 being the most like the normal system.  A work
around that might work (I haven't tested it yet), is to open an identical
screen, copy the contents, and delete the old ones.  As a last test, try
something like 'Close Logic'.

Giday Amos people,

Can someone tell me why every time I load AMOS The Creator V1.36, on my 
Amiga 500, it brings up a big line about 3 pixels high at the bottom of 
my workbench screen?  It didn't use to do this, but now it does for some 
reason.  Wy Workbench Screen is 640x269, and I have Turbo Plus and LDos 
loaded in as extensions in AMOS.  Doees anyone know a solution to this 
wee problem of mine.

I've also noticed that it becomes a screen on my workbench.. Meaning that 
if I press Left Amiga-M (which swaps screens) it first moves this wee 
screen of about 2 or 3 pixels to the back... This is really annoying, so 
please help me..

Thanks in advance,

Ben Crowl

	Hello everyone,

	I'm trying to load, then play an .iff sample in amos pro (cover
disk vers.).    
	Nothing special, just one sample, played once...  The limited
help files have just got me blundering around setting up memory banks,
start addresses, etc.... surely it can't be that difficult, can it?

	Any program examples of 'how incredibly easy it is, actually',
gratefully received - please e-mail if this would be too big for the
list. (Everything else works ok - I won't bother you again, probably:)

	Many thanks,

A couple of years ago i had a friend who learned me some Amos code and
one day if i'am not remembering wrong i asked him if it's possible to
put 2 pictures next to eachother on the same screen and he answered
that that only works if the screens are on top of eachother, is this
right or is he a lamer??

Well, the reason for the story is that i really need a way to do this:







           ------------------------------
           |     :                      |
           |  L  :                      |
           |     :    OTHER             |
           |  O  :         STUFF        |
           |     :                      |
           |  G  :                      |
           |     :                      |
           |  O  :                      |
           |     :                      |
           ------------------------------



Oki lets say that the logo part is scrren 1 and the biggest part is
screen 0.
Then i need the logo part to scroll over the big one when i for example
click the mouse.

Well to do it easy:

* How do i place 2 pictures next to eatcother???


I think i'll manage the scrolling for myselves.

Errrr, you can't do it that way.  Put them on the same screen and blitt=

like crazy.

Ok, you'll have to use something like screencopy to copy the logo from =
the
left hand side of the screen to the right.  Copy the screen to a buffer=
, and
screencopy parts of it in a nice loop.  That'll sort you out.  Easy.

You put them on the same screen...   If the logo was above or below, it
would be a lot easier..

Hi Everyone,

REQUIUM FOR CLUB USA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some sad club news ... on July 15 Mark wrote the members of the AMOS Club USA
saying the disk mag club was done.  Memberships and submissions were dropping,
and he had no luck trying to purchase the Pro from Europress.

Starting in 90-91, Mark outlasted all the other clubs, including AMOSzine and
Whitby AMOS Club who are also no longer publishing but haven't yet officially
quit.  And he was a class act to the end, even sending refunds for the
remainders of the memberships.  The only other one to do that was the great
Brian Bell at Mr. AMOS Club.

Mark is still open to communication from AMOS users, and his e-address is:
MSchult@execpc.com   He sometimes gets behind on his mail so you may wait a few
days.

He hasn't said whether all past Club disks are now declared PD, the way Totally
AMOS announced when they quit.  I'll send him a note and find out.

And he has an AMOS library with 5 years' accumulations ... someone might want
to make him an offer for that.

Mark might post his own good-bye here too, but I wanted to as well.

You might like to post the e-addresses of the other hard-core AMOSers from the
club.

Thanks for hanging in there Mark (and publishing all my crap, er, stuff).
Showing that helped me get my second computer job.  If you ever get converted
to PC C++ let me know ... I'll try and clean your crappy code up for ya :-)
Here's a toast to the past, and may the wind always be at your back .........

-Chris.

You should use the Dir First$ and Dir Next$ commands to get the names of

all
the files in the dir and then use Kill.

Kill("Ram:data/"+Dir First$("Ram:data/")
Do
   A$=Dir Next$
   Exit If A$=""
   Kill(A$)
Loop

This should work, but I cannot be sure since I have no way to test it now.
I
cannot remember if the Dir First$ and Dir Next$ return a string with just
the
name of the file or also the lenght of it: in the second case you have to
separate the two parts with another command.

Bye

I don't know what your problem is, but I don't think it's a bug: I used to
use Craft player commands quite often and I have never had any problem..

Yes, though the list traffic has been down on the
normal load.  I suspect this has a lot to do with
it being the summer => most students away from their
net access.

Of course, it may just be that no-one`s writing AMOS
stuff anymore... it has been a while since I did any
AMOS coding :-(

Hi guys!  :-)
 
I have a problem with AMOSPro, which seems I can't solve by myself... :-((
I want to issue MoDem commands ("atd 1234^m" or "atz^m" etc.) via AMOSPro but
I have no idea how this could be done. Although simple ASCII text can be read
and be send, the at commands don't work.. :(
I've read everething I have and asked everone I know but nothing happend.... 
:(
 
Any help would be very apreciated!

I plan on taking over the old Amos Web Site (remember that?  8^) ), and I 
need some info from youall on the Mailing List.

Its going to be set up so that you'll hvae access to all the Amos files 
on Aminet sites from around the world, the freeware and shareware 
extensions, info on the commercial ones (which I really Need, Craft being 
to only commercial one I own!), ASCII source code of programs and 
procedures and stuff, and info on the mailing list.

What I need from everyone is:

  * A list of the extensions you regularly use, along with some sort of 
comment on its functionality (Cool, Sucks, Blows Goats, etc.)
  * Alist of the files you put up on Aminet, wriiten in or for Amos
  * For all you assembly progrmmers, examples of how to use asm in Amos
  * Source code of nifty stuff, in ASCII format, so Amosand AmosPro 
people can use it to their needs

This is going to be a big project, mainly to test the functionality of my 
new HTML viewer (not browser, viewer), but also to let everyone know what 
the heck is going on in those mysterious posts to 
amos-list@access.digex.net (or amos-list@conan.eds-ms.com, whichever is 
working).  I want the site to be a pinnacle of Amos information...and 
I'll need your help to do it. What do you say?

If you're going to send me any files, send them to bintzer@pop.erols.com, 
as that is on the receiving end of a real EMail program, on my 
Amiga...not on a computer over in Canada.  Thanks a bunch!
