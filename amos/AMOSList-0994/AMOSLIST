  Heck, no!  I send the demo version.  And before I get questions from lots
of people about "why won't the screens and windows close", that's why - the
demo version doesn't close them.  That's the crippling... and the incentive
to get the full version. :-)

Hello,

Yes, the time has come and tommorow is the last day of employement which
means no more email for me. Which means no more me. I can see you are all
crying, but maybe I'll get a modem one day and log on through Almac /
Demonnet in the UK.

If you want to compliment me on my brilliant Tone Dialler (ehem...) then do
it quick because my address will be invalid in 1 day from the date on this
mail. Otherwise, goodbye.

But remember : if you recieve this on the first of september - I'm not gone
yet.

Thanx go to:

Mike Cox - for being a great admin geezer.
Andy C - for his intuition extension which I am determined to get working.
Paul Reece - for having a small chat with me.
Ryan Scott - for his comments and the promise of distributing stuff.
Dominic R - for being totally insane and not reply to my mails.
Christer Hanhanhanhanhan(!!) - for asking for lots of things.
David Hollway - for his help and advice.
Matt Funnell - for not posting any hacks (hehehheheh).

and last but not least

D Lewis - for just being there with his Kangaroo generators.

Okay got 2 go, 1 last day on email and thats it for me...

J-/\-M `94.

Status: RO

  I have been getting various reports of crashes when using the
Intuition Extension and the two demos included.

  First, the Shanghai program is apparently defective, and will be
removed from the distribution.

  After a debugging session tonight, I discovered what appears to be the
source of the crashes: AMOS is incapable of handling an extension larger
than 32k, as it uses signed word offsets (range -32768 to +32767) to
locate the extension's routines.  I will post programs to patch various
versions of AMOS to fix this as soon as I find the time to create said
programs.

  BTW, I'm sending a letter to Europress asking whether the proposed
AMOS Development Team can take over development of AMOS now that
Francois appears to have quit.  Anybody know about how long it takes
them to reply to a letter?

Hello,

I just recently joined the list and am just getting back into 
programming. I'm still fairly inexperienced tho. The last thing i even 
got near completton was a character generator for the marvul super heros 
rpg. 

After i get back on track i'm going to start working on a small rpg 
myself. I would like for it to have a top down perspective and am going 
to play around with building rooms out of ascii characters for a bit to 
see if i can get some form of grid system to work. I would ultimately 
like to have it set up like the Knights game that recently arrived to 
AmiNet.

Does anyone on the AMOS list have any experience in writing rpgs, or more 
appropriately a movement system for a rpg? 

Any help from anybody would be more than welcome..

					-Brandon

Hideehi.
I've been off the list for about 2 months (WHAT do they call that? 
Holidays?), and now I'm back (Really?).
I've read lotsa mails (476 to be exact) concerning AMOS, and I want to 
put in my little stone (that's Dutch proverb, doesn't matter if you don't 
understand.) Anyway, here goes:

Why does AMOS (Pro) crash when sending data to a procedure with 
On...Proc[data]? I know it's not legal to do so (hence the Guru), but 
why?
Some time ago (before the holydays) some discussion was going on about 
the exact pronounciation of AMOS. Let me all give you a hint: listen to 
the installer sample...
A tip for all those people who try to read ASCII files in their programs. 
In some programs, it takes awfully long to read in a specific program. 
Some use Until LOF(x) or something... Don't! Please. Use Errtrap or 
assign the LOF() value to another variable, but don't use it in a loop. 
(This may sound a bit patronizing, but really, I've seen it twice 
already, and it's very annoying.)
Why won't Scorched Tanx (from the AP coverdisk) work on my A500 (1 Meg)? 
The introductory text says it'll work with 1/2 Meg of Chip Ram, but it 
crashes after the terraforming.. :(
Oh yes, and something about New Statesman.. That guy who wrote that 
article was my dad. Just kidding. No,what I want to say is that people 
don't now a fraggin' sh*t about 'puters. Last time, I read something 
about a special computer program that allows fans to communicate with 
their idols via a PC. Even (insert a celeb) here gets some 20 messages a 
day. The program was called E-Mail :) Silly sods...

**** Sorry if I overload your mailbox, but I don't have the address of 
Ryan, so I'll put it here... ***

I bought the best CU ever (it was the coverdisk that made it so good)
But: LightSpeed (a shoot 'em up) doesn't work. It scrolls for about 8 
pixels and then it Guru's. Why?
If I use F Paste bob/icon, I can't use the HRev or Vrev commands...
Can I get the full list of Turbo I from you? I don't like CU, and I don't 
want to pay every month just for one or two pages of explanation.
Do I have to pay less when upgrading to Turbo II if I already have Turbo 
I ;) ?
 
And something else..
For Jam!
I've got a quote concerning your problems with sending mail (it took too 
long, I recall. It's from Alice in WonderLand. (hope you'll be able to 
read this before you leave...)

"You couldn't have it if you did want it", the Queen said. "The rule is, 
jam tomorrow, and jam yesterday - but never jam today."
"It MUST come sometimes to 'jam today'", Alice (read: the AMOS-L 
subscribers) objected.
"No, it can't", said the Queen. "It's jam every other day: today isn't 
any other day, you know."

Well, that'll be all, I guess. Thank you for your attention.

Well... the price is a steady $30 for TURBO PLUS 2, no matter what.  
Unless you *bought* a copy of TURBO PLUS 1, (CU doesn't count)

The problem with the CU disk was that they put an OLD version on the 
disk.  They COMPLETELY SCREWED IT UP!  <pwhew, had to get that out there>

Whats in TURBO PLUS 2?  4096 Possible icons, faster mapping, some smooth 
scrolling routines, better map editor (visible brushes and lots more 
features), and some other goodies (like a MANUAL!)

You can get it direct from me ($3 overseas shipping) or Kompart.

Subject: AMOS Pro 2.0 Patch
Status: RO

  OK, everybody, here's a program to patch AMOSPro.Lib in AMOS Pro 2.0
so that it will work correctly with the Intuition Extension (and any
other large extensions that happen to come along).  People with older
versions of AMOS, just hold on... I'm working on it.

  The program looks for AMOSPro.Lib in your APSystem directory (the
pathname is obtained from AMOS).  If for some reason it can't find the
file (e.g. you renamed it), it will put up a file requester and ask
you to select it.  Once you do that, it will rename the original to
the same name followed by ".bak" (or ".bakNNNN" if <name>.bak already
exists, where NNNN is a hexadecimal number), then update the file.  If
for whatever reason AMOS does not work after the patch is applied,
simply copy the backup file over the patched version, and let me know.
(Note: the size of AMOSPro.Lib should be 98184 bytes before the patch.)

  Hmmm, that didn't work as well as it had seemed to at first... :-(

  Don't use the patch program - it's not quite correct.  I may end up
just splitting the Intuition Extension into two parts (for now)...

Hello,

All this parallel speak has just made me think about the serial port.

I wanted to use a serial cable to join two Amiga's together. I have already
made it up and it consists of : a ground, a send and a recieve wire.

Whenever I used open port 1,"ser:" it just gave no results, I think I had
the serial.library installed at the time but would it make any difference?

Does anyone know how to send a string of text along the serial cable which
is then interpretted on the other computer?

Mail me if ya do....

J-/\-M `94.

Hey Mike,

Where can one find the AMOS in Action book at ? I've never seen it in the 
local dealers or book stores.

I have uploaded August's messages.  As usual they are in the dev/amos
directory.

Has anyone bought the Weird Science AMOS CD ROM, or even the CD PD IV?
I want to know if there is all that source code on there.

	I've found a player that works fairly well, but I have run into 
another problem.  The recording programs that I have record, and put the 
information into chip memmory.  This means that I can only sample about 3 
minutes worth of information, and I need to do about 30 minutes at a 
time.  Is there anything that I can do to get the sound programs to 
record to my HD?  Or, is there another program that will record to HD?  
Thank you for all of your help! :)

  DSS8+ (Digital Sound Studio) v3.0 claims that it will record directly to
hard disk, although I can't verify this claim since I haven't had a chance
to upgrade yet. :-(  I've also heard of a couple others that will sample
directly to disk, but I don't remember their names, and I think they were
more expensive as well (DSS8+ is around $125 US, from what I've read).

  Francois Lionet is a BAD PROGRAMMER!

  ... There, I've gotten that out...

  Anyway, while I've been trying to patch AMOS Pro 2.0, I've run into
several annoying problems.  The most annoying of those is that if AMOS
encounters an unexpected situation (except for not being able to find an
extension), it crashes.  The whole system, that is.  Deliberately.  In
other words, probably more than half the system crashes you've had while
using AMOS were deliberately coded into AMOS by Francois.  (Number one on
the bugs-to-fix list...)

  So I'll keep trying, and if I somehow manage to succeed, I'll let you
know.

Yes, you can use a sound spooling program.   I don't think EME will do it 
yet (sorry if I'm wrong, I should know :-P), there is a little music 
extension that does do it - dsam.  But its AMOS only as far as I know 
and its not so great otherwise.

I have not seen it either.  I know it was published in the UK by KUMA.  I
have been asking John at NW PD and I think he is still trying to get a line
on it.

I am trying to get in touch with KUMA, the only problem is... If they are 
like Europress, they are going to want me to buy 500 units to get any 
kind of price break.  I don't think there is that much of a market for it 
over here.

Anyway, Weird Science AMOS PD CD, I should have them Tuesday or Thursday 
this week, I will post when they come in.  It is supposed to have disks 
1-620 plus the first 6 issues of Totally AMOS on it.

Hey Everybody!

This is my first email to amos mailing list, so hope I got this right.
Here's a list of AmosPro bugs I know, if somebody is really interested.


			A M O S P R O   B U G S
			-----------------------

Please e-mail me if you have solved these problems somehow or you know
more bugs.

Software & Hardware:
I have an A2000 (CPU 68000) with 1M of chip ram (no fast) + other hardware
(HD etc), my Kickstart is version 1.3 (argh!). Following bugs will appear
at least with this hardware, sum won't especially if you have 68020 CPU
or better.


	Sorry about the lazy English...


(*) A Compiled (PRO COMPILER) program with Icon or Bob bank
    crashes when run from WB or CLI/SHELL on A500/A2000.
    If the machine has a 68000 processor there will be a crash,
    otherwise it is uncertain what happens.
    On A1200/A3000/A4000 the programs *usually* runs fine.

(*) When a compiled program ends and it should return to Workbench, 
    a guru will sometimes appear.Again no guru on A1200/A3000/A4000.
    For some odd reason this bug appears completely randomly, but
    I suggest it has something to do with program's length.
    (Over 100kb programs crashes more often than small ones)

    Example (really simple)

	Screen Open 0,320,256,2,Lowres : Cls 0
	Repeat : Until Mouse Key=1
	Screen Close 0
	End 			<<< BOOM!!!

(*) Upper & Lower instructions doesn't convert scandinavian characters
    AmosPro Editor has the same bug.
    For example, if we have a label with scandinavian chars in it
    the editor won't convert them to UPCASE.

    I think there is an extension with new versions of Upper & Lower
    commands that can handle scandinavian characters. Yeah, it's
    called 'Fractal extension'.

(*) You cannot dimension an array inside a Procedure if
    you want to make it a global array.
 
    Example (from Amos Pro Manual p. 05.05.07) 

	Procedure VARIABLES
	  Dim ARRAY(100,100)
	  Global ARRAY()
	End Proc

     `Array not dimensioned' error will appear.
  
(*)  Following piece of code doesn't work:

	Dim A(10)

	For I=1 To 10
	  Read A(I)
	  Print A(I)
 	Next

	Data 1,2,3,4,5 : Rem Comments in data area
	Data 6,7,8,9,10 : Rem can cause harm

      The program above can crash (KS1.3 or 68000) or values of A()
      can become trashed (KS2.0+ or '20+) depending on the moon's phase.

(*) Sometimes when I quit Amos Pro and return to WB, I found
    a 32 pixel wide line (that's one longword) somewhere on the WB
    screen. That means there's a dangerous leak somewhere which
    should be covered immediately!

    NOTE:
    I've a WB close option set in Amos Pro Interpreter Configuration
    and I'm not aware if this bug appears when the option isn't
    set!

(*) Bobs and Icons won't update correctly (or doesn't appear on screen)
    when using a very large screen. For example, if you try to draw a
    bob on a 960 x 960 (32 cols) screen using y coordinate greater
    than 512, there will be a trashed bob (one plane will be drawn)
    or nothing. I think Amos won't calculate the Blitter Destination
    address correctly, if the screen is very high.

    Ex. Screen Open 0,960,960,32,Lowres : Cls 0 : Hide 
        ' You need very much free chip ram to perform this trick!

	Screen Offset 0,0,600 : Rem 

	Bob 1,200,700,1

	or

	Paste Icon 100,800,1


    Do you know how this could be fixed??? I'm working on a game, but
    cannot go on becoz it has a 960x960 screen with screen offset scrolling.
    If no solution appears, I have to dump the project or make
    my owm bob routines in 68000 (ugh). Please help me!!   

(*) You have to tell the Pro Compiler if your program uses floating
    point variables. This bug should have been fixed in Amos Pro,
    but it's still somewhere there. Add A#=0 at the
    start of your program, if you're using floating point vars.
    I'm not sure if this is needed in all occasions, but it won't
    do you any harm if you use it.  

    Ex. 
	A=Sqr(20)
	Print A : Rem A should be 4.4721... but isn't!!!

    This works if run from the Amos Pro editor, but compile it and
    check out what happens then!


(*) Amos goes to WB (Amiga + A) even if the WB Screen is closed!
    Sure the display becomes trashed. Of course you can get back
    to Amos with Amiga + A, but...
	

			M U S I C . L I B    B U G S
			----------------------------


(*) MTempo & MVolume doesn't work with Tracker or Med modules!
    There should be commands like Track Volume, Med Tempo etc.
    if it's not possible to fix MTempo & MVolume commands to support
    Tracker & MED.

(*) MuVolume doesn't work with MED modules (returns zero).

(*) Programs which uses MED and Sam Play command will crash even if
    run from Amos editor (no compiling needed!). I think Sam Play
    command will cause the crash.

    Example

	Med Load "...",15
	Med Play 15
	Repeat : Until Mouse Key=1
	Med Stop
	Load "samples",15 : Sam Bank 15
	Sam Play 1     <<< --- BANG!
	Repeat : Until Mouse Key=1
	End


(*) Tracker player doesn't support following commands (or they've
    some bugs there) due to old playing routine. These are very
    hard drawbacks.

	19xx (sample offset): doesn't work
	1Fxx (double note):      - " -
	Finetunes:               - " -

	B (position jump):    

	top of screen (off-screen area) flashes white.
	(I think this is for testing purposes but someone has
	unfortunately forgotten to remove it).

	This bug can be avoided by putting Colour Back $fff instruction
	in the program or using an overscan screen which covers the whole
        screen area.		      

(*) Track Loop On

    When module starts playing from the beginning after it has
    played once or more, Tracker plays the first pattern of module
    more than once (random count?).

    Although this can be avoided by putting B (position jump) command
    to last pattern causing a jump to beginning, it's still a bug... 

(*) Med module stops automatically when a new bank is loaded into memory. 
  
    Example

	Med Load "...",15
	Med Play 15

	Load "any AMOS bank",any amos bank number  <<<--- Med stops here	
	
	... program continues ...

    I have a bugfixed version of music extension (v2.01) which has
    this bug fixed. If you want it, I can email it to you.
    Btw. the bugfix was done by my friend, Mikko Kallinen.

Those LIARS said that it was written by someone other than Mike Welch.  
It looks like the exact same program to me.

I tried to compile a program which had some instructions from the Turbo 
extension (the sucking one,Ryan (strange grammar, no?:).
When I try to compile, the friggin' thing says: Extension not loaded. 
According to the Compiler manual, this is a very rare error, and it 
mentions some things I should do (stuff like deleting things and so. But 
I nver put on another Config file, so why should I delete it?) An other 
option was to change it. How do I do this? Is there any way I can change 
the Compiler's configuration (except from the Config part in the Compiler 
Shell itself, but there I can't change the extension list.) the way i can 
change it in AMOS Pro? The commands work perfectly in AMOS Pro, mind. 
(Especially the Texp command is very, very handy. Thanks, creators of 
TURBO:). Anyone?

			crisis, so don't laugh. :) DON'T!
P.S. It's AMOS Pro v2.00 and the first version of the compiler (is there 
eny other version?)
P.P.S. Have you noticed how badly those manuals are built? In the 
Applications maual, there's a reference to 'the last chapter', where 
they explain the use of scenes, and so. Never found that last chapter :(
And then, not all the compiler errors aren't covered as well. I once got 
a 'Disk Error', when the program I was trying to compile, never tried to 
access the disk (and my disks were ok as well.) Never compiled that 
program too :(

Hey Andy,

That post you put out a few days ago that is to try to fix the bug in the 
AMOSPro.Lib ... well your fix is buggy as well as when I try to use my
ppAccessory from my Editor's menu system it crashes my system as well as 
creating a kinds of strange effects, but works fine when I replace the 
original AMOSPro.Lib

So is the gadget system ready in the Intuition extension ?

You need to not only install the TURBO.lib in AMOS.ENV, but in RAMOS.ENV.
That'll do it.

You're welcome, that was my little idea....  I hated doing it the old 
way, got sick to death of it.

Which, the AMOS Compiler manual?  Yeah... I noticed that parts seemed to 
be missing as well...

Has anyone ever made a digitizer for the Amiga?

I'd like to connect the Amiga to a tape-deck or a 4-track.  I REALLY need one
and I think I could make it myself...only I need a schematic, or some advice on
connecting which pins to where.

If you know ANYTHING about this...please reply.

Carl.

Petri,

"A=Sqr(20) : Print A"  will always return 4, you need to use "A#=Sqr(20) :
Print A#".  FYI.  (Unless you just forgot the # in your example, and
the problem's someting else)

Ryan,

What was the Amiga Mag that has Turbo on it, and screwed it up by using
an old version?  I'll remember to not give that mag and Amiga Power
any chance to have my game on their cover disks...

It was CU Amiga, Kompart says that CU wouldn't have put it on unless they 
used the name Craft, because it was established (established as crap 
if you ask me)...

I noticed this a while ago - the AMOS Pro file is full of "illegal" instructions.
However, if you have any version of devpac, there is a simple way around this
problem:

monam AMOSPro_System:AMOSPro

When monam loads, press 'R' then 'G'. Now if AMOSPro crashes at anytime, you
usually go back to monam which reports the error, instead of crashing the
system. It is also handy for debugging extensions. Just remember to put the
AMOS screen to the back if you set any breakpoints.

For those who use APME (And if not, why not?), change the call to AMOSPro
in the script to load monam first.

Status: RO

Yes! 

I just upload Chaneques to Aminet, it is in games/think directory
the game comes in two disks (Chan and Fases) called chaneques_1.dms
and chaneques_2.dms. Download it if you can! really is very good.
I am trying to uuencode these files but UUxt crashes my machine. I think
the reason is the file size (430kb and 530kb), I going to try with other
uuencoder.

This game was created with Amos the creator v1.36.

1. I have now put the people who asked into the E-Mail directory. If anyone else
   wants in, E-Mail me your name, E-Mail address, and URL of your homepage if
   you have one. If not, see below

2. It is still impossible to download any software, but I'm working on it (And
   pester ryan a lot). I have got rid of the access denied problems - but there
   wasn't anything in the directories to which access was denied anyway :-)

3. I'd like to recieve buglist for AMOS Pro / AMOS Creation. Mike Cox - I believe
   you have a rather large one (No inuendo intended :-). Thanks to Petri Hakkinen
   for those posted to the list. I will include those on the list I intend to
   put on the web site.

4. Some of you wanted to know how to write html. The source for my page & a
   html quick reference guide is below. It is quite easy really. If you don't
   have a suitable http server at your local site (Ask you root if you don't
   know - If you are root, compile one :-), E-Mail me the page, and I'll put
   it with mine on gate.net.

   NOTE: The lines begining with a ; are comments I've inserted, and are not
          HTML

   NOTE: HTML is free format - the line feeds & spacing of the source are
         not important - <P> ends a paragraph.

   NOTE: < , > and & are the only reserved characters - you must use &lt; ,
         &gt; and &amp; instead to get them in the html text.

HTML Quick Reference

HTML is composed of a set of elements that define a document and guide its display.
An HTML element may include a name, some attributes and some text or hypertext,
and will appear in an HTML document as

   <tag_name> text </tag_name> 
   <tag_name attribute_name=argument> text </tag_name>, or
   just 
   <tag_name> 

For example:

   <title> My Useful Document </title>

and

   <a href="argument"> text </a>

An HTML document is composed of a single element:

   <html> . . . </html>

that is, in turn, composed of head and body elements:

   <head> . . . </head>

and 

   <body> . . . </body>

To allow older HTML documents to remain readable, <html>, <head>, and 
<body> are actually optional within HTML documents. 

Elements usually placed in the head element

<isindex>
   Specify index file 
<title> . . . </title> 
   Specify document title 
<nextid>
   Set a variable value. Attribute: variable name 
<link>
   Specify relationships to other documents. Attributes: same as Anchor below 
<base>
   Specify the name of the file in which the current document is stored. This is
   useful when link references within the document do not include full
   pathnames (i.e., are partially qualified). 

Elements usually placed in the body element

The following sections describe elements that can be used in the body of the
document.

Text Elements

<p>The end of a paragraph that will be formatted before it is displayed on the
   screen. 
<pre> . . . </pre> 
   Identifies text that has already been formatted (preformatted) by some other
   system and must be displayed as is. Preformatted text may include embedded
   tags, but not all tag types are permitted. 
<listing> . . . </listing> 
   Example computer listing; embedded tags will be ignored, but embedded tabs
   will work 
<plaintext>
<blockquote> . . . </blockquote> 
   Include a section of text quoted from some other source. 

Hyperlinks or Anchors

<a name="target_anchor_name"> . . . </a>
   Define a target location in a document 
<a href="#anchor_name"> . . . </a>
   Link to a location in the same file 
<a href="URL"> . . . </a>
   Link to another file 
<a href="URL#target_string"> . . . </a>
   Link to a target location in another file 
<a href="URL?search_word+search_word"> . . . </a>
   Send a search string to a server. Different servers might interpret the search
   string differently. In the case of word oriented search engines, multiple search
   words might be specified by separating individual words with a plus sign (+). 

Required attributes for anchors: one of name or href.

Optional attributes: rel, rev, urn, title, methods. Note that not all 
methods are valid attributes to an anchor.

The structure of a Universal Resource Locator (URL) is similar to: 

   resource_type://host.domain:port/pathname 

where the possible resource types include: file, http, news, gopher, telnet, and wais,
and the colon followed by the TCP port number is optional. A more complete
description is presented in 
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html 

Headers

<h1> . . . </h1> Most prominent header 
<h2> . . . </h2> 
<h3> . . . </h2> 
<h4> . . . </h4> 
<h5> . . . </h5> 
<h6> . . . </h6> Least prominent header

Definition list/glossary: <dl>

<dl> 
<dt> First term to be defined 
<dd> Definition of first term 
<dt> Next term to be defined 
<dd> Next definition 
</dl> 

The <dl> attribute compact can be used to generate a definition list requiring less
space.

Present an unordered list: <ul>

<ul>
<li> First item in the list
<li> Next item in the list
</ul>

Present an ordered list: <ol>

<ol>
<li> First item in the list
<li> Next item in the list
</ol>

Present an interactive menu: <menu>

<menu>
<li> First item in the menu
<li> Next item
</menu>

Present a directory list of items: <dir>

<dir>
<li> First item in the list
<li> Second item in the list
<li> Next item in the list
</dir>

Items should be less than 20 characters long.

Entities

&keyword;
   Display a particular character identified by a special keyword. For example
   the entity &amp; specifies the ampersand ( & ), and the entity &lt; specifies
   the less than ( < ) character. Note that the semicolon following the keyword is
   required, and the keyword must be one from the list presented in: 
   http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Entities.html 
   -or- 
   The ISO LATIN I character set 
&#ascii_equivalent;
   Use a character literally. Again note that the semicolon following the ASCII
   numeric value is required. 

HTML Forms Interface

The HTML forms interface allows document creators to define HTML documents
containing forms to be filled out by users. When a user fills out the form and presses a
button indicating the form should be "submitted," the information on the form is sent
to a server for processing. The server will usually prepare an HTML document using
the information supplied by the user and return it to the client for display. 

The following tags implement the forms interface: 

   <form> . . . </form> 
   <input> 
   <select> . . . </select> 
   <option> 
   <textarea> . . . </textarea> 

The last four tags can only be used within a <form> . . . </form> element. 

<form> . . . </form> 

ATTRIBUTES: action, method 
ARGUMENTS for: 

   action: The URL of the query server similar to:
      <form action="URL"> . . . </form> 
   method: One of get or post similar to:
      <form action="URL" method=post> . . . </form> 

<input> (there is no ending tag) 
   Defines an input field where the user may enter information on the form. 

   ATTRIBUTES: type, name, value, checked, size,
   maxlength 
   ARGUMENTS for: 

      type: 
         One of: "text", "password", "checkbox",
         "radio", "submit", or "reset" 

         type="text" and type="password" accept character
         data; type="checkbox" is either selected or not; 
         type="radio" allows selection of one of several options; 
         type="submit" is an action button that sends the completed
         form to the query server; type="reset" is a button that
         resets the applicable default values in the form. 
      name: 
         "textstring" where textstring is a symbolic name
         (not displayed) identifying the input field as in: 
         <input type="checkbox" name="box1"> 
      value: 
         "textstring" where the function of textstring
         depends on the argument for type. 

            For type="text" or type="password", 
            textstring is the default value for the input field.
            If type="checkbox" or type="radio", 
            textstring is the value of input when it is
            selected. 
            For type="reset" or type="submit", 
            textstring is a label for the input field. 
      checked: 
         No arguments. For type="checkbox" or type="radio",
         if checked is present the input field is selected by default. 
      size: 
         width or width, height where width and height are
         integer values representing the number of characters by number
         of lines for the type="text" or type="password"
         input fields. 
      maxlength: 
         length where length is the number of characters accepted
         for type="text" or type="password". This attribute is
         only valid for single line "text" or "password" fields. 

<select> . . . </select> 
   defines a list of options the user can select for the field. This element employs
   the <option> element for each item in the list. 

   ATTRIBUTES: name, size, multiple 
   ARGUMENTS for: 

      name: 
         "textstring" where textstring is the symbolic
         identifier for the select field. 
      size: 
         The argument for size is an integer value representing the
         number of <option> items that will be displayed at one time.
      multiple: 
         No arguments. If present, the multiple attribute allows
         selection of more than one <option>. 

<option> 
   Within the <select> element the <option> tags are used to define the
   possible values for the select field as in: 

   <select>
   <option>textstring 1
   <option>textstring 2
   <option>textstring 3
   </select> 

   textstring 1, textstring 2, and textstring 3 represent
   possible values of the select field. 

   ATTRIBUTES: selected 
   ARGUMENTS for: 

      selected: 
         No arguments. If selected is present then the option is
         selected by default. 

<textarea> . . . default text . . . </textarea> 

Defines a rectangular field where the user may enter text data. If "default text" is
present it will be displayed when the field appears. Otherwise the field will be blank. 

ATTRIBUTES: name, rows, cols 
ARGUMENTS for: 

   name 
      "textstring" where textstring is a symbolic name that
      identifies the <textarea> field. 
   rows and cols: 
      Both attributes take an integer value which represents the lines and
      number of characters per line in the <textarea> to be displayed. 

Miscellaneous

<!-- text -->
   Place a comment in the HTML source 
<address> . . . </address>
   Present address information 
<img src="URL" alt="Alternate Text">
   Include a graphic image. "URL" is the location and filename of the image file.
   The alt attribute allows a text string to be put in place of the image in clients
   that cannot display images.

   Other possible attributes are: ismap and align.

   The argument for align can be one of top, middle, or bottom. 
<br> 
   Forces a line break immediately and retains the same style. 
<hr> 
   Places a horizontal rule or separator between sections of text. 
<link rev="RELATIONSHIP" rel="RELATIONSHIP" href="URL"> 
   The link tag allows you to define a relation ship between the "URL" specified
   and the HTML file. The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the
   HTML file and the "URL". The rev attribute specifies the relationship
   between the "URL" and the HTML file. The only currently implemented link
   relation ship is rev="made". 

   <link rev="made" href="URL"> 

   allows the file maker or owner to be specified in the link "URL". The most
   common use of this is as follows: 

      <link rev="made" href="mailto:EMAIL_ADDRESS@HOST">

Anyone have any further idea as to when AMOS may be released into PD? I 
know it's probably a well-worn question by now, but you must appreciate 
the position of people like me. We planned to buy AMOS just when this 
rumour arose. Not wanting to shell out a couple of hundred dollars for 
something that may soon be free, we patiently wait in limbo, without AMOS.

In reply to Anthony Murphy's question about using different
fonts.  There should be a procedure that you get on one of 
the Amos Pro disks that loads the font into ROM.

  I think its in the dir procedures/fonts/openfont.AMOS on 
one of the productivity disks.
  
This is a lot better than mucking around with the get disc 
fonts command which really is a waste of time.

The new font will appear after the topaz ones so you can 
access it by using "get rom fonts" and the other font 
commands

Could somebody tell me more about this coming Intuition extension?
Can it handle actually intuition screens and windows or
is it just a fake? And what about gadgets?
Can you do a Workbench program with it?
Does it need KS2.0 or better (almost all new wb progs requires...
I've only KS1.3 =(( ) ?

If it works with low memory systems (about 300 kilobytes free when
amos is run) I could do sum examples & demos for it...

	O.K.  Now that many of you have had your chance to get TechnoVenture
(I hope SOME of you took your chance by now), I'm considering updating it.  I
know there are a couple things that could use some changing.  I've already
gotten at least one message about it.  Now could everyone post any bugs or
minor upgrades (fix things that aren't broken, but could be nicer) including
anyone that's already told me (I think that's only one person).
	If you haven't DL'd TechnoVenture from anywhere, I suggest you do.
If you can't find it on a BBS, try to FTP it from aminet (someplace like
wuarchive.wustl.edu do I have that right?) in game/jump as TV125b.lha.
Eventually, I'll be giving out cheats (which may greatly enhance gameplay of
harder maps if you have 

oops... if there are too many hard maps to play).  If you previously got
TechnoVenture, but it crashed your system, but have had success with other
AMOS/AMOS Pro programs, try getting TV125b because I've fixed the problem
by un-powerpacking the programs.  If you have a version of TechnoVenture that
crashes your system, run it through powerpacker to un-powerpack it.
	Oh I forgot one thing.  If you DO FTP it and can't find it on any BBS's
please PUT it on the BBS's!

It's nothing personal, but I can't understand why AMOS would be brought 
into PD so soon. Could you imagine Cannon Fodder being brought out to PD 
within a couple of years? And those Sensi guys sure did less coding 
coding on CF than Francois did on AMOS. Personally, I'd never like it 
when so much work becomes available for everyone without them paying 
for it. I'm not trying to be the big capitalist here, but admit it, you 
wouldn't like it too.

Thats strange about your bobs, I'm CC; this to the list, maybe someone 
will know.  I have not run into that problem, although i haven't used 
screens quite *that* big in practice.

It'll have new bob routines alright, but what's even better is Manuel 
tells me we'll be able to use 128 sprites on screen at once.  He's 
rewritten the entire sprite handling system, making it faster and easier 
to use...

Maybe we can skip bobs entirely.

Get a copy from me, support our work so we can keep doing this.

  I've heard the rumours about AMOS going PD, but someone mentioned that
Europress said they didn't have plans to release it...

  I sent a fax to Europress early Monday morning asking whether the
proposed AMOS Development Team could continue working on AMOS where
Francois has apparently left off.  I haven't yet received a reply (which
at least means they haven't refused me outright); about how long should
I expect to wait for a reply?

  No.  A few of the functions (such as public screens) require KS2.0
or higher, but 95% of the extension will function under KS1.3.

  I believe it does - I haven't heard of any memory problems.  I'll

That's nothing...last week I got email from the blitz list (which I
un-subscribed from last semester) dated November 93!

Well...it's at LEAST a couple of months late (the date must be wrong
surely...no message can bounce around for THAT long can it?)

It has nothing to do with bobs nor number of colors on the screen
nor screen offsets. You don't have to set the offsets to 0 even if the
manual says so.

Do this:

1) Open screens
2) Wait 2
3) Dual playfield them
4) Wait 2
5) Set dual priority now (if needed)
6) Wait 2 

The Amiga hardware needs some time to initialise the new display mode..
that's why there are those Waits

If this doesn't work, swap the screens (Dual Playfield 0,1 -> Dual 
Playfield 1,0 and then set the dual playfield priorities)

I had this same problem when coding a game called Zhandulin Helmi,
that is by the way a finnish (lang.) textadventure with music and some 
graphics (anyone interested ?). It has a dual playfield screen with
a one 640 x 256 (4 colors) screen at the background and an another
4 color screen for the text on the foreground.

I send a piece of example code (opens a dualplayfield screen) to amos list 
soon...
             Bye!

You have the most recent version.  The deal with the sprites is not until

Hello Michael Cox!

Thanks for your letter of welcome!

As you might remember I have just joined AMOS Mailing List (6-Sep-94).

I have recently bought Amos Pro and have been happy to develop programs.
However I have a lot to learn (and I want to learn).

By having already received some mail from amos-list I seem to understand
that programming in Amos Pro is including a lot more than just the "Amos Pro" package 
as I bought it. Therefore I would truely appreciate if you would kindly do me the
fever to send me a list of helpful and most useful additions and extensions.
That is I would like to know what software I should collect in order to having
the best possibilities to make great programs.

I did not know weather I should mail this to you personally or to amos-list.
If you regard my request as a matter for amos-list then please redirect my mail.

Thanks a lot - and may the future be bright for AMOS.

NB. You were talking about a FAQ that you were working on, I would like a copy
    if it is not too much trouble.

    If some of my questions seem stupid it could relate to the fact that I am
    also a novice within the world of Internet - I have just been assigned to
    Internet through a University in Denmark.

    If it is therefore possible to send me some amos programs or utilities 
    through Internet that would be truely fantastic. (Am I dreaming ????)



The best regards from
 
    Frank Busborg   alias as Frank Dux.

First make sure you are using hardware coords for the offsets.  If that's 
not the problem, I don't know what is.  I've posted several times to this 
list about dual-playfield problems and the only answers I recieved were 
that it's an AMOS(+Pro) problem.  Furthermore the only person who knows 
how to overcome the dual-playfield problems is unable to release the 
working code :P  Hope you have better luck than me...

Gee, wouldn't it be nice if the programmers of these extensions had
access to beta testers that would perform a feature by feature
test with every command tested against every command on a wide
variety of system configurations?  Sure would be nice I would
think :)

  I've had some other people tell me that AMOS Creator crashes when used
with the extension.  Could I get an idea from those on this list that have
the Creator how stable the extension is under it?  (Remember to tell me
what version you're using - this may be a problem limited to a single
version or two.)

Everyone seems to have problems with Amos's Dual Playfield.
Well, here's a simple example how to do it:

Screen Open 0,320,256,4,Lowres : Curs Off : Paper 0 : Cls 0
Screen Open 1,320,256,4,Lowres : Curs Off : Paper 0 : Cls 0
Wait 2 : Dual Playfield 0,1 : Dual Priority 1,0 : Wait 2
Double Buffer : Autoback 0

Screen 0
Pen 3 : Centre "Move your mouse!"
Pen 2 : Print At(10,10);"This is screen 0!"
Screen 1
Pen 1

Repeat 
   X=X Screen(X Mouse)
   Y=Y Screen(Y Mouse)
   If X<>OX or Y<>OY
      Wait Vbl 
      Cls 0
      OX=X : OY=Y
      Bar X,Y To X+60,Y+20
      Text X,Y,"This is screen 1!"
      Screen Swap 
   End If 
Until Mouse Click=1

Screen 0 : Flash Off : Fade 2 : Wait 30

Is there anyone out there who thinks he wrote the most fab demo (in AMOS) 
ever? If yes, please send it to me... Otherwise, if someone thinks he 
once downloaded the most fab demo (in AMOS) ever, but the creator isn't 
on this list, don't bother and send it to me as well.

Status: RO

  When I asked for the version of the extension if you discover that
your copy is crashing, I didn't mean "demo version"... I already know
that!  I meant something like "version 1.2a", which you can get two
ways:

  - By typing "version <filename> full" at the CLI prompt, where
    <filename> is the full path to Intuition.lib.

  - By looking at the extension title in AMOS.  (In Pro, this is under
    the "AMOS" menu, item "About Loaded Extension".

  I just remembered that I sent version 1.2 (not 1.2a) to some people
before I realised that upgrading my assembler had destroyed some
critical portions of code.  If you have v1.2, that's the reason for
the crashes - let me know and I'll send you the new version

  Yes, all the crashing problems you've had with the Intuition Extension
are my fault.

  As it turns out, the "version 1.2a" demo archive I sent actually
contains version 1.2 (the one that crashes).  It seems that I forgot to
re-assemble the demo version.  For those of you wondering why the title
says "version 1.2", that's why.

  I'll be sending out the real version 1.2a shortly to all those who
have previously requested it.

  I'd encourage flames, but nothing you could send me would be nearly as
caustic as what I've already given myself...

Here is a little procedure which I wrote that will give you the hex$
address of any TASK currently running in your system as long as you know 
the name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedure TASK_ADDRESS[TASK_NAME$]
Areg(1)=Varptr(TASK_NAME$)
D=Execall(-294)
TASK$=Hex$(D)
End Proc[TASK$]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's it. Here is an example of usage:

TASK_ADDRESS["Virus_Checker"]
Print Param$

  No, you have to add a Chr$(0) to the end of the string:

TASK_ADDRESS["Virus_Checker"+Chr$(0)]

Otherwise you may not get what you expect.

  Also, why return it as a string and not as a number?  If the program
wants it in string format, it can call Hex$() itself, but addresses are
rarely used for output (except in debugging).

Hello everybody:

I've returned from holydays the 1st of September and I don't received any

Thank you Michael for the answer (the only one) but the images have more than 4
colours and so I can't use sprites. Anybody has any idea?

I've heard that the amos for pc is called "Click & Play". It's
a programming "language" like Cando on Amiga or something.
(gadgets, icons etc.)

Francois Lionet has been busy with the Click and Play now for over half a 
year...  That's all I know (not pretty much eh)

  OK, here's that encryption program in AMOS.  Note that the program will
both encrypt and decrypt using the same algorithm - run a normal file
through and you'll get an encrypted file, run an encrypted file through
(using the same password) and you'll get the original file back.

  I haven't actually tried this in AMOS, but it *should* work... :-)


Default
F1$=Fsel$("**","","Select input file")
F2$=Fsel$("**","","Select output file")
Repeat
   Locate 0,0 : Print Space$(40)
   Locate 0,0 : Input "Password (8 chars): ";PASS$
Until Len(PASS$)=8

Open In 1,F1$ : L=Lof(F1$) : Close 1
Reserve As Work 1,L : PTR=Start(1)
Bload F1$,PTR
PASSOFS=0
For I=0 To L-1 Step 4
   If(I and 4095)=0
      Locate 0,1 : Print "Converted";I;" of";L;" bytes"
   Loke PTR+I,Leek(PTR+I) xor Leek(Varptr(PASS$)+PASSOFS)
   Add PASSOFS,4,0 To 7
Next I
Locate 0,1 : Print "Converted";L;" of";L;" bytes"
Bsave F2$,PTR To PTR+L


  Note the use of Leek and Loke to save time - since the Amiga OS always
allocates memory in 8-byte chunks, there's no need to worry about
overwriting other memory if the file's length is not a multiple of 4.

Well, unless you've got a virus of some sort (unlikely - this doesn't 
sound like a virus), I think your df0: is knackered.
 But before you curse, grouse and fork out for a new drive, it might be 
worth your while to give the current drive a thorough clean.
  Don't use a disk-head cleaner unless you really want to - the fact that 
your Amiga is complaining "No disk present in df0:" indicates that it 
can't detect _anything_ at all in the drive. If the drive read/write head 
was dirty, then the Amiga would complain "Volume df0: is Bad", or 
"Read/Write Error", or "Checksum failure" etc etc.
  But because of your description of the symptoms, I'd suspect that maybe 
the drive isn't detecting disk insertions at all. So get a fine 
paintbrush (anything in the size range OOO to 1 I'd say) and give those 
bits of the drive that are visible through the disk-slot a good brushing, 
to clear out the dust and lint that inevitably accumulates. If you feel 
sufficiently confident, you'd find it easier to do this if you opened up 
the Amiga and removed the drive. Actually, opening the Amiga isn't such a 
bad idea.. you could then check to make sure that the drive data & power 
cables are firmly plugged in (both to the drive, and to the motherboard).

 If your drive still doesn't work after all this, it's definitely 
knackered. But at least it's now *clean* and knackered :-)

OK, that's all.. sorry to the other readers of this list, it IS a bit off 
topic I know, but I suppose I just get carried away :-)

	The AMOS RND() function, if I remember correctly, is a very good one.
How often do you get 4 or 5 same results (of 7 numbers)?  You're using it
correctly and everytyhing?  I suppose you could do it manually

seed=123
for t=1 to 7
seed=seed*314 mod 513
Print seed mod 27 + 1
next t

	I just chose a bunch of large random numbers.  Use whatever you want
in their place.  I have NO IDEA how this will work.  Let me know.

Hi,  Can anyone help???

I need a good amos random routine, to pick number between 1 and 27

In my current code I use the RND() function, but in a sequence of

seven randoms, I get 4 or 5 the same!!!!!                                       




Any Help would be most welcom.

Hi all,

   I walked in on the middle of the discussion, so I never caught the
essentials of what this product was about.  Can someone tell me the
basics of this product Turbo for AMOS?

   Commercial or PD?  Does it give added commands?  Does it, as the name
would indicate, speed up a program?  Does it work with regular AMOS?
How about AMOS3d?  Compiler?

                                                  Thanks,
                                                    Matt Gdowski

How about an example of how you are doing it?  Are you seeding it 
correctly?  How exactly are you calling it?

If your program is not synced to vblank then you can use XY position of
the beam to give a "random" number. All you would have to do then is scale
it so it's in the range 1 to 27

Have you tried Randomize Timer before each sequence?  This should give 
more "random" numbers.

I just got the AMOS PD CD from Northwest PD.  I will be checking it out and
let everyone know what I find.  It says: 1600 source code files, 100 sprite
banks, 250CText banks, 800 samples,hours of Music banks, and much, much, much
more.

The main thing to remember is NOT to use Timer to seed any random number
generator. Timer is set to 0 when AMOS is loaded, so a compiled program
will always give the same sequence of numbers. This is true for the
above example, and when using Randomize and RND().

 ok, here's a question.  Say I wanted to create a program that generates 
dual frequencies...I know there is a command in regular basic to 
generated sound tones, but how do you accomplish this in AMOS?  What I am 
getting out is that I want to simulate to tones of a touch tone phone.  
Anyone...?  All help is greatly appriciated as usual!! :)

RDB would probably mean Ridge Disk Block (or something similar)

The RDB is the part of a harddrive where some drives save things like =

I just wrote a couple of pages on how great my new version of Easylife, with
MUI support & structured variables is, then sent it to the someelse instead
of the list! I can't be bothered to type it all again, so just download it,
and please email me your thoughts / bug reports / non-bug reports (I.E. What
you tried & did work). The archive is 300K+ and contains new versions of the
variable checker & editor enhancer & over 200 of amigaguide documentation!

Download it from wuarchive.wustl.edu only - not other aminet sites:

/pub/aminet/priv/EasyLife.lha	(This is different to the first filename I
				 gave, if the original message does get
				 forwarded to the list)

NOTE: This is only a beta release.

The problem is that computers, being mostly deterministic beasts, are bad at generating random numbers. The least you 
should do before calling random is using a randomise function. I guess you can say something like 
Randomise(Timer) in Amos.
The suggestion of using the position of the 'vertical beam' (I am not sure I know what I am saying here :-)) also seemed 
like a good idea to me (I guess you could also use the resulting number as a seed for the randomise function).

Well, unless you've got a virus of some sort (unlikely - this doesn't 
sound like a virus), I think your df0: is knackered.
 But before you curse, grouse and fork out for a new drive, it might be 
worth your while to give the current drive a thorough clean.
  Don't use a disk-head cleaner unless you really want to - the fact that 
your Amiga is complaining "No disk present in df0:" indicates that it 
can't detect _anything_ at all in the drive. If the drive read/write head 
was dirty, then the Amiga would complain "Volume df0: is Bad", or 
"Read/Write Error", or "Checksum failure" etc etc.
  But because of your description of the symptoms, I'd suspect that maybe 
the drive isn't detecting disk insertions at all. So get a fine 
paintbrush (anything in the size range OOO to 1 I'd say) and give those 
bits of the drive that are visible through the disk-slot a good brushing, 
to clear out the dust and lint that inevitably accumulates. If you feel 
sufficiently confident, you'd find it easier to do this if you opened up 
the Amiga and removed the drive. Actually, opening the Amiga isn't such a 
bad idea.. you could then check to make sure that the drive data & power 
cables are firmly plugged in (both to the drive, and to the motherboard).

 If your drive still doesn't work after all this, it's definitely 
knackered. But at least it's now *clean* and knackered :-)

OK, that's all.. sorry to the other readers of this list, it IS a bit off 
topic I know, but I suppose I just get carried away :-)

It adds about 130 new commands and they are all very fast.

Regular graphics commands are 2 to 5 or more times faster, while things 
like mapping with icons are hundreds of times faster than normal.  I'll 
send you a full feature list in private, not to the list.  If anyone else 
wants a copy, just send email to
rscott@gate.net
with subject of 
SEND TURBO FAQ

Its not truly a faq yet, but a feature list.

I should have the auto send feature up rsn.

thanks!

INTO SEQUENCING SOFTWARE AND MIDI INSTRUMENTS--AND WITH THE LUXURY THEY AFFORD 
I HAVE NEVER HAD THE INCLINATION TO ENTER MUSIC THRU THINGS LIKE MED.  ALAS 
YEARS HAVE PASSED AND NOTHING HAS APPEARED.  I HAVE TRANSLATED SOME PUBLIC 
DOMAIN PROGRAMS FROM AMIGA BASIC THAT USED AN OLD OBSCURE MIDI.LIBRARY AND HAVE 
EXTENDED THEM INTO AN AMOS PROGRAM THAT DOES STUPID STUFF LIKE PLAYING AN 
EXTERNAL SOUND MODULE FROM THE KEYBOARD AND TRANSLATING NOTES PLAYED ON AN 
EXTERNAL MIDI KEYBOARD TO NOTES ON A STAFF.  BUT THE LIBRARY ROUTINES ARE 
PRETTY SLOW AND KLUDGY TO DO ANYTHING SERIOUS WITH.  I WOULDN'T MIND UPLOADING 
THESE THINGS--WHENEVER I FIGURE OUT WHERE AND HOW.  BUT ASIDE FROM THIS MOST OF 
MY SPARE TIME IS SPENT PROGRAMMING GAMES FOR MY KIDS.  I DO LIKE AMOS A LOT--I 
PUT OFF BUYING AN AGA MACHINE UNTIL AMOS SUPPORTS AGA, AND AM SUFFICIENTLY 
SPOILED THAT I DON'T THINK I COULD BUY ANY OTHER COMPUTER PLATFORM WITHOUT AN 
INTERFACE AS USEFUL AND EASY TO USE AS AMOS.  AND IF AMOS IS DEAD--WELL TO PUT 
THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE MY KIDS STILL PLAY GAMES I WROTE WITH BASIC-XL FOR MY 
ATARI 800--USEFUL TOOLS WILL REMAIN USEFUL FOR A LONG TIME.  I'M HOPING THIS 
FORUM CAN GENERATE ENOUGH INTEREST TO KEEP THE DREAM ALIVE FOR A BIT LONGER.

  Here's a routine I use that works well (at least, well enough for most
circumstances).  You need to initialise the global variable SEED to some
value; any given seed value will always return the same sequence of
random numbers.  The parameter passed to the routine is the maximum value
you want (the minimum is always 0).  So if you want a number from 1 to 27
inclusive, you'd use "RAND[26] : N=Param+1".


Procedure RAND[_MAX]
   A=16807 : M=2147483647 : Q=127773 : R=2836
   HI=SEED/Q : LO=SEED-HI*Q : TEST=A*LO-R*HI
   If TEST>0
      SEED=TEST
   Else
      SEED=TEST+M
   End If
   N=(SEED*1.0)/M*_MAX
End Proc[N]


  Note that A*Q+R is equal to M, the maximum positive integer; in other
words, M/A equals Q remainder R.  I don't know why A has the value it
does (I just translated this from a routine given to me by my Computer
Science teacher), but you should be able to pick any value of A you want
and calculate Q and R accordingly to get a different set of random number
sequences.

Is that an offer?????? 


For anyone who is interested I have uploaded the next beta version of Easylife
to aminet, and I would like as many people as possible to test it. I don't 
expect everyone to do a full feature by feature test (Although I won't complain
it you do), but I would appreciate it if EVERYONE who downloads it E-Mails me
which features they did use, and whether they worked. I want non-bug reports
as much as bug-reports. 

Why download it? Well, there are 2 rather mega-nice major new features:

 - Commands & Functions to easily create MUI interfaces from AMOS. Who needs
   intuition! (MUI V2.1+ is required)

 - Structured Variables. These were literally added yesterday and there is no
   documentation for them as yet, but there are 3 examples. 

The archive also contains updates to Editor Enhancer & Variable Checker (Which
now uses structured variables to index variables with a binary tree which makes
it 2-3 times faster, especially on large programs.). There is also over 200k
of amiga guide documentation.  

How to download it (This is different from normal):

Since these is not even a proper beta relase, but just a copy of all the files
as far as I have worked on them, I have not made this publicly available. So
you must connect to wuarchive.wustl.edu (NOT a mirror), and download the file

		/pub/aminet/priv/easylife.lha

The priv directory cannot be listed, but the file is there. 

P.s. This is only the AMOSPro version - I still haven't got the XPK features
to work with AMOS creator, and I'm to busy with AMOSPro to be bothered with it
at the moment.

Well... ask the user to press keys SDFDJFKD simultaneously at
the beginning of program ;-) This will make a random delay...

If your program is not synced to vblank then you can use XY position of
the beam to give a "random" number. All you would have to do then is scale
it so it's in the range 1 to 27

The size of the screen is 320x256 (PAL Lowres). It has 32 colours.

> Do you use dual playscreen mode?
Yes, I use dual playscreen mode in the game I am developing (if you say
double buffer to avoid the flicker of the bobs), but I have send a little
part of the game to the list, in which the double buffer is not used (I
think). I can send you this part if you want.

> How many colours are your bobs?
I am not sure, but I think they have 32 colours

For those of you using the virus killer VMK30, there is a message from AMINET

this is not amos random routine, you have to write one yourself, but this one
is good for every language (this is C-version)

you need two global variables (seed1 and seed2) and reset them to some 
nonzero values at beginning (from clock?), btw.. all variables must be 
longwords (=32bits):


static long seed1=0x12345678,seed1=0x87654321; 
               /* initialize global variables */

random()
{
long temp;   /* initialize local variable */

temp=seed1;  /* set seed1's value to temp */

seed1=seed1+seed2;  
  /* add seed2 to seed1. (in c you can do this: seed1+=seed2;) */

seed2=temp;        /* set temp's value to seed2 */

temp>>=16;      /* shift temp's value 16 bits to right */
                /* you can also do this with command: temp=temp/65536; */

/* here you have random number 0-65535 in variable temp */

temp= temp % 27; /* get modulo of division temp/27 */
                 
/* i think there is an operator mod in basic to do this: temp=temp mod 27 */
/* if that doesn't work, try this one: temp = temp-(temp/27)*27  */
/* tho you have to be sure you don't use floating points if you use 
   that one... must have long ints */

/* now you have random number 0-26 */

temp=temp+1;

/* now you have random number 1-27 */

return temp;   /* return random number out of the subroutine */


}



so.. complete random routine that gives random numbers between 1-27 is here:
(without comments and optimized for C)

static long seed1=0x12345678,seed2=0x87654321;
random27()
{
long temp=seed1;
seed1+=seed2;
seed2=seed1;
return ((temp>>16)%27+1);
}

	I have had every part inside my A4000 (except HD) and of
	course it was done on a part by part basis... then after that
	was all done my HD still did not work properly... the dealer
	I purchased it from set the 'Mask' and 'MaxTransfer' completely
	wrong... nice eh?  Because when I ordered my A4000 I ordered
	it with a 240meg HD... and this was not covered by the warranty
	so I had to figure what was wrong with my HD myself... well I just

	I started work on a C-2-Amos complier... it is intended to be
able to compile 'C' grammer into Amos.  Anyone that has used 'C' and
'Amos' knows exactly why...

	Next semester I am taking a course on complier design where I
most likely will be designing a C compilier.  At the same time I have
decided I will do a C complier for Amos... but I have already started
working on the C-2-Amos compilier.

	Basically what I want to know is if anyone is intrested in
this and would use it ? thanks...

Why not just ask the user "Type in a number between 1 and 27" and use
that. :)

	Okay I finally decided to sit down and try to write and extension..
and well I read through |music.s, |compact.s, |request.s and I think I
got I pretty basic Idea of what is going on... so I edited the |compact.s
to just add one simple inst... a plot instruction..

	I got it to assemble no problem and also when I use the 'About
Loaded Extensions' on AmosPro it says that my extension was loaded but
it will not 'tokenise' the one command I have... and I have played for
about 2 hours on this problem and read over and over the section on how
to specify the syntax of an instruction... now that I played with it a
little bit when I quit Amos the mouse ptr hangs for about 3 secs...?
(it didn't use to do this)... 

	I would really appreciate it if you extension coders out there
could just take a look at this extension below (its < 2k) and most of
it is the plot function...


	thanks a lot in advance... mike.

Randomize Timer

----cut----------

This will give you a pseudo random number, different each time the amiga is
run. Tha amos random number function uses a set seed value to derive the
'random number'. Therefore each time the machine is turned on, the same set
of numbers will be generated. By randomizing the timer we change the seed
to the value of the timer, thus it changes each time the game is run.
There is another way of generating numbers.
take a seed value
divide the seed by a smaller number
the interger portion is the random number
The mod is used as your next seed

I wrote a program that does this in 6502 assembler (yes for a C64). If you
email me back, I'll dig up the program and try and convert it to amos.

Easy peasy to sort this one out - just reset the random seed whenever the

Does everbody remember the games like Xenon,XenonII,X-out?
When these games came, one was thinking about if these were the best
that could be done in a A500.Now when some time has passed since their
arrival, there has been changes on Amiga power.Aga came,processor power
went up and so on...But what I'm wondering about is if a shootem up in
A500 written with assembler(say XenonII) is somewhat equal with an attemt
to make the same game in Amos but instead using A4000 (perhaps with
accelerator).I mean, what you are loosing in power of language,should you
gain in hardware power.
I'm sorry for my poor english but I hope I could make myself understood.

Hi Yall!!

	I have uploaded a Version of Scrabble, to wuarchive.wustl.edu 
	today, currently in /pub/incomming.

	It is written in AMOS 1.3, and is stand alone.


	I wrote it because I couldnt get a commercial version,
	no matter how hard I tried!!!


	Check it out...

Regards

  Martin.

Note: It is a Limited version.  No Load/Save & Only 15 words can be played.
Full un-cut version on registering!!

But sometimes you might want to generate a random number without any
user input (as in my insult program for instance), in which case you're
better off using something like the system clock for the seed.

APOLOGIES FOR JUMPING IN BLIND--BUT I'M CURIOUS IF THIS WHOLE MESSAGING SYSTEM 
REALLY WORKS.  I'VE BEEN INTO AMOS FROM THE (AMIGA) BEGINNING RIGHT THROUGH TO 
AMOS PRO.  I ALWAYS FIGURED IT WOULD BE JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE 
ELSE WOULD WRITE A FULL FEATURED MIDI EXTENSION FOR AMOS.  I WAS ALREADY HEAVY 
INTO SEQUENCING SOFTWARE AND MIDI INSTRUMENTS--AND WITH THE LUXURY THEY AFFORD 
I HAVE NEVER HAD THE INCLINATION TO ENTER MUSIC THRU THINGS LIKE MED.  ALAS 
YEARS HAVE PASSED AND NOTHING HAS APPEARED.  I HAVE TRANSLATED SOME PUBLIC 
DOMAIN PROGRAMS FROM AMIGA BASIC THAT USED AN OLD OBSCURE MIDI.LIBRARY AND HAVE 
EXTENDED THEM INTO AN AMOS PROGRAM THAT DOES STUPID STUFF LIKE PLAYING AN 
EXTERNAL SOUND MODULE FROM THE KEYBOARD AND TRANSLATING NOTES PLAYED ON AN 
EXTERNAL MIDI KEYBOARD TO NOTES ON A STAFF.  BUT THE LIBRARY ROUTINES ARE 
PRETTY SLOW AND KLUDGY TO DO ANYTHING SERIOUS WITH.  I WOULDN'T MIND UPLOADING 
THESE THINGS--WHENEVER I FIGURE OUT WHERE AND HOW.  BUT ASIDE FROM THIS MOST OF 
MY SPARE TIME IS SPENT PROGRAMMING GAMES FOR MY KIDS.  I DO LIKE AMOS A LOT--I 
PUT OFF BUYING AN AGA MACHINE UNTIL AMOS SUPPORTS AGA, AND AM SUFFICIENTLY 
SPOILED THAT I DON'T THINK I COULD BUY ANY OTHER COMPUTER PLATFORM WITHOUT AN

THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE MY KIDS STILL PLAY GAMES I WROTE WITH BASIC-XL FOR MY

Subject: AMOS colors...
Status: RO

Hi folks, I'm new to the AMOS list, and have a couple of things
to ask about. I've heard it was rather slow around here lately,
so if anyone is listening...  I have interpreter ver. 1.3.
After many tries, I still can't get the front screen of a dual
playfield to scroll correctly.  I think it might be the palette
that's goofing things up.  Both screens are 3 bitplanes deep,
and the bobs share the same 8 color palette. How does a dual
playfield interpret GET SPRITE PALETTE?  Does the bob palette
need to be 16 colors to cover both screens, or 8 colors and
loaded into each screen seperately?

		Thanks in advance,

  If you set the default screen to 1 bitplane in the Interpreter

are that Default will not work correctly and Sam Raw crashes.

GEE, that's really weird!

Are you sure the 1bp default screen is causing the bugs??
Sample instructions sometimes crashes if medplayer.library is opened....
I think.

What do you mean with that Default won't work correctly...
Is the screen opening or does it become trashed?

  Quite sure.  I tried the standard configuration (4 bitplanes) and it
worked fine, as it did when I reduced it to 3 and then 2 bitplanes...
but when I took it down to one, it crashed.  Any doubts left? :-)

>What do you mean with that Default won't work correctly...

  The AMOS Pro internal routines will respond to Default correctly, but
none of the extensions will.

Don't let the volume of traffic stop you asking questions.

>I have interpreter ver. 1.3.

Can you get it to display still images OK. If might be that you have
to put wait vbl instructions before & after the dual playfield instruction.

Secondly how are you scrolling it? Screen offset, or real scrolling with 
screen copy or an AMOS Turbo equivilent?

At a guess, I'd say 16 to cover both screens.

Send an example of the code causing the problem to list, then we can see
exactly what the problem is, and have more chance of solving it.

Hi all,

I saw in a pc mag about 4 or so months ago a hint that something called 
"PCOS" would arrive on its humble platform. This was said to be a version 
of AMOS for the pc. Is there any truth in this? Its not that I want to 
abort the amiga (even if the big C= does!) but it would be a great reason 
to do even less serious stuff at work and I might be able to play around 
with texture mapping etc.

Does anyone know of any WWW pages, threads etc. for Blitz Basic 2 on the 
(dare I say information super highway <-| ) internet?

The only reason I use it is because of the AGA support, intuition support 
and the speed as well as some more complex variable handling etc. I will 
always use AMOS as my first approach for the cool interface and general 
user  friendliness it offers but I'm afraid once the code is perfected I 
port it over into blitz for the final touch ups and tweaking.

I'm currently re-learning maths at the moment ( its been about six years 
since I last used that part of my brain) and I am trying to get my head 
around 3D graphics and filled polygons. I understand the theory of 3  
dimensions and vanishing points etc. but its causing me premature 
balding, Does anyone know of any good books, literature etc. on the 
subject.

If anyone has any suggestions, comments or just luuuvrs to go on like me 
then I can be contacted at:

Deards@nca.bbc.co.uk

Cheers, Matt.

PCOS is, AFAIK, closer to SEUCK than AMOS - it provides an sort of point-
and-click interface for building games, rather than being a programming 
language.  If you want to do any PC programming, I recommend C.

If you have any specific questions, I'll try and help you myself, but for 
general 3D tips, the book "3D Graphics Programming for the Atari ST" is 
pretty good.  Ok, some of the code needs hefty modification, but all the 
theory is there, as well as general algorithms for clipping, depth 
sorting, light sourcing, etc.  There should be a copy at your local 
library, or if not, get an inter-library transfer form Chandler's Ford 
Library, as I know there's a copy there. :)

I just posted a review in USENET c.s.a.reviews.  It is not really in-depth as
it is impossible to do that for each AMOS PD disk.

If any of you have a CD ROM drive, you HAVE to get this CD.  It has a ton
of demos, games, utilities, and source!  Heck, it even has AmoNER on a few of
the disks!

I only know it is available from Northwest PD in the USA.  Weird Science puts
it out in UK.  For $19.95 (or less) this can not be beat!

	My problems are finally solved.  The manual example used Wait Vbl after
the
	Dual Playfield.  This caused a scrambled display.  Wait Vbls before AND
after
	solved the problem.  Thanks for the tip, Paul!

	I tried Get Sprite Palette to the front screen with 16 color bobs.  The
front
	palette (registers 0-7) was correct, but the 2nd screen (8-15) was way
off.
	I cheated a little:
	Screen 1: Get Sprite Palette: For T=0 To 7: Colour T+8, Colour (T) : Next
	Of course, Bobs on both screens have identical palettes.

I've heard AMOS Pro will be a coverdisk.  Have other AMOS products
(AMOS, AMOS compiler, 3D...) been coverdisks?

Hi!

I finally uploaded Chaneques to Aminet.

If you don't remember, it is a game written in Amos
the creator, it have 25 levels, good graphics and
music. I uploaded it to game/think in wuarchive.wustl.edu
and I hope in one or two days it will apear in RECENT.
 
This game demostrates that with Amos and a couple of
imagination you can do semi-comercial and fully
comercial games.

This game comes in two disks fulls of bytes: one called
CHAN, and other called FASES. 400Kb each in lha format.

If you can't access to FTP, I can send it to you in
uuencode format. (somebody in Australia request it to me
three weeks ago but i cant't remember who, sorry)

While were on the subject of EME.

The October issue (42) of Amiga Shopper has a review of Paul Reece's
Enhanced Music Extention. Simon Green gives it a very good review.

If I was into music in Amos I would almost certainly purchase it.
Unfortunately, I'm not :(

Even Ryan gets a mention as a distributer for EME

	#1.  How do I call a fcn in Amos from an extension ?

	#2.  Is it possible to a call a fcn in another extension (ie.

	#3.  How do Access some of Amos's internal data zones.. like
	     what the current Ink value is or What the Screen Base is
	     for the Current Screen.. ?


	I have tried to figure this out myself.. but the CLoset I have
	come is to Using Rjsr L_call... but this is not working...

	Thanks a lot....  I really appreciate any help I can get.. I find
	that every time I keep reading through the example extensions I
	think Francois gets krazier... (It would have been nice if they

  There are some macros in equ.s that allow you to call certain functions
from AMOS (but not all of them, and not Screen Open); the screen functions,
for example, are called using EcCall <funcname>, where the <funcname>s are
listed right before the macro.  If the macro requires a number, it is
passed in A0; if it requires an address, that is passed in A0.

>	#2.  Is it possible to a call a fcn in another extension (ie. 
>	     like Turbo) ?  and if so how ?

  Not without knowing what the function number (Lnnn) is, and even then,
you have to know exactly what the function expects and where (register-
wise).

>	#3.  How do Access some of Amos's internal data zones.. like
>	     what the current Ink value is or What the Screen Base is
>	     for the Current Screen.. ?

  label(A5); the defines are near the bottom of equ.s.

  You're only allowed to do that for a few certain calls, like L_Error,
L_ExtError, and the various L_Bnk.*, L_Dev.*, etc. functions.

  I agree perfectly about the Francois bit... if you're wondering why AMOS
is so buggy, that's why.  At some point I may well write up a "how-to"
document on writing extensions.

Hi y'all,

Just a quick post.

I'm in the process of writing an iff image to ascii art convertor.
It's nowt special, just a little proggy I decided to write on a whim.

So far, it's lookin ok. I'll just have to write the output text to file
routine and it should be finished.

If you would like a copy of the program let me know.

Adios,

G.

PS. I'll be uploading it to the Aminet/Amos W3 site when finished.

Hi boys,
I'm new on this list and I hope you can help me.
I have JDlib. I have tried to install it and after a night of mess I
managed in the task. But then I realized I could not understand a word of
the docs (they are written in German!). I tried some commands on my own
but I have obtained only GURUS.
I needs the graphics extensions...
Does anyone can help me sending English or Italian docs of JDLib?

Which are the current extensions for AMOSPRO which can be obtained?

Thanks a lot

Note that not all functions can be called - Those defined in the Lequ.s
cannot be used if the program using the extension is compiled. P.s.Andy,
should the number not be passed in D0? (That's just from the way you wrote
the sentence, not anything I know about the EcCall macros)

How do you do if you do know these things. In the next version you will be
able to call some of the easylife routines, mainly the structured variables,
as I am moving them into a normal amiga shared library which easylife will
call. This works quite will, as I can use the library base for the easylife
data zone pointer when initialising the extension, which means all of my
extension datazone is automatically allocated at runtime, and some of it is
intialised to certain values by the initlist in the standard shared library
header.

This will mean it will be possible to use structured variables in extensions,
or from other AMOS assembly code, such as Asm banks & assembler procedures.

I have uploaded a symbol table to the WWW site which explains what a few
(And I mean few) of the symbols mean from the amospro equ.s file. If anyone
knows what any of the others are for, please let me know, so I can update it.

The only thing here is that there are only 26 slots....  If anyone wants to
collaberate in extending easylife, instead of creating new extensions I'm
willing. Obviously for major extensions, such as mike C-->AMOS this isn't
practical, but for smaller projects it may be. (But NO starfiled commands!)

I'm the creator of an update  of the Resource Bank maker which you'll find
on aminet with the name of SRM2.2.
It is a very good program (I think) which let you use images larger than
the screen and a various of options to move the definition box without
having to redefine all the buttons when you alter slightly your image.

Have a look at it and say me what you think.

Hi folks!

Have someone downloaded chaneques from Aminet?

I remember you Chaneques is in Aminet game/think
chaneques_1.lha and chaneques_2.lha, 400kb each.

If you can't download it from aminet I can send it
to you in uuencode.

I want to know what you think about my game!

....and now for a quick plug.

Nigel Critten's Sticks2 extension will allow you to do the following.

You can read a mouse from both ports during a Forbid(),Permit()
You can read Sega MegaDrive joypads 4 buttons and Sega MS 2 buttons.
You can read analogue joysticks
you can read CD32 joypads
and you can read two joysticks from the parallel port.
it also contains diagrams so you can build your own SEGA adaptor, analogue 
adaptor and parallel adaptors . I have found that some parallel adaptors need a
wire moved.

Sticks2 requires lowlevel.library (in CD32 ROM, on disk with Workbench 3.1)

Nigel will allow you to use the extension for either a royalty, or
a small fixed fee (20UKP for a shareware game).

If you want to know more, email ncritten@cix.compulink.co.uk

Hello everyone,

This is just a quick message to ask a very important question.

Are EuroPress still going to support the Amiga in the future? And if so, are they still
going to develop AMOS?

Because I haven`t heard EuroPress mention anything about it in a LONG time, hmmm
maybe they`re trying to keep quiet about it! :)

Answers on a post card please!

	Regards,

	Mat.

Hi dudes!

Could somebody tell me what are these "structured" variables like in
Easylife, please? How do they differ from normal variables and
what can I achieve with them that I cannot do with normal vars ?
(see, I don't have easylife ;) )

I'm working on a textadventure (with graphics and muzaks),
could structured vars help me somehow on the job (easier
array handling or something)?
 
Thanks!

Sounds like an invitation for a plug to me...

Think of a structured variable like a table e.g.


Name		Age		E-Mail
---------------------------------------------------
fred		10		fred@nowhere.special
ann		34		midnight@the.lost.and.found
jim		52		jim@naysium

A row of this table would be represented as one variable, of
a type person (Instead of string, real or integer which AMOS provides).
Person would be described in terms of the amos variables e.g.

persion = structure
     name  = string length 10
     age   = integer from 0 to 150
     email = string length 50
end


As you can see, some specialisation of the AMOS variable is necessary / provided.
Strings have a fixed maximum length (Disadvantage) memory for which is always
allocated to the string, but then integers can be specified to only be allowed
to take values between an upper and lower bound (Advantage) e.g. the 0 to 150
of age. This means an error will occur if you try to set the age to -6. Also,
the easylife structured variables system will recognise that only 1 byte is
required to store age, so only use 1, not 4. It also knows that only 1 byte
is needed to store integers in the range 10000000 to 10000006.

You can also specify an element to be another structure e.g.

car = structure
     type : string length 20
     passengers : array 4 of person
end

This defines a car as having a name, and 4 people inside it. You can then
refer to the people in the car such as car.passengers[2].name (Not AMOS/
Easylife syntax). However, the real power comes from pointers - an element
which contains the address of another structure. This allows you to create
data structure such as lists & trees.

All structured variables are refered to in AMOS as an integer, which is
the address of the structure. This means they can be passed as procedure
arguments, returned as param's, etc. and anything else that can be done with
 integers - AMOS doesn't know they are structured variables (But I wouldn't
recommend arithmatic on them :-). They are allocated memory dynamically, but
without fragmenting the system memory list, and are accessed via function
calls and commands.

Then its not a text adventure is it - its a graphic & muzak adventure :-)

Undoubtedly. Like *no* array handling - use lists / trees of structured
variables instead.(Of course the elements can be arrays if you want). The
only slight problem is there is no documentation of the structured variables
section yet, as I only wrote it the day before uploading. This will be
remedyed soon though.

There already is a iff2ascii converter in the general purpose 
ascii-paint programme. It is called SigMaker and is written in 
AMOS by a Finnish chap who was (or still may be) a subscriber to 
this list. I suggest you take a look at what he has done (it is 
somewhere on Aminet), so you can compare the quality of the 
programmes.

Ok after spending a couple of months cursing with other languages,
I decided to give Amos Pro a try (again :-). It's a nice system,
but _why_ does it always crash on my Amiga? Turbo Extension 1.9
crashes it always when I exit. LDos (newest version) kills it
within 2 minutes, even hitting "test" button means bye bye program.
JD_Library seems to be one of the few extensions that work
without crashing, which is a shame, since LDos and Turbo would
be awesome if they worked :-( Is anyone else experiencing
problems with these two extensions? I have to cripple my AmosPro
totally and only use the standard extensions if I'm gonna do anything 
with it.

And another question, someone on the list was bugfixing AmosPro.
Does he have the sources or what? Are the updates official?
As I see it, EuroPress has dropped Amiga support completely.
Is the compiler going to be updated?

OK. So it seems that previously unknown to me, EuroPress are ceasing
support for AMOS. :(

Does this mean that EuroPress are no longer writing ANYTHING for
the Amiga? :(

Oh well, it`s there loss!

So what happens now? I mean, we might as well learn either Blitz Basic, or
even C (which isn`t that hard really!)
 
Other coders knocked AMOS whilst it was still going strong, what are they
going to think now? (Not that I`m really that bothered - but do you see
my point? In comparison we`ll be like OS 1.3 owners - just clinging to the
past!)

How about C? (I know this is an AMOS mailing list - but why not make it

I think most of the dudes on the list already know how to program in 
Asm/C... It's just that Amos is good for little tests/weird 
utils/gfx/some types of games. No-one is going to make the next 
world-conqueror word processor in Amos :-)

I must be boring all you guys dead :-)
But anyway, here it comes...

I tried AmosPro with "nostartup", I painfully re-installed 1.12 and then
updated it to 2.00, used NO non-standard extensions, and didn't touch
the settings. Same thing: When I save/run/test the program, sometimes
mouse pointer disappears and the whole thing freezes. Sometimes
when the mousepointer disappears, the border areas of screen flash.
Quick left-right-click unfreezes the machine for a while.

So I have come to the conclusion that AmosPro just does not like
68000 OS2.1 machines with ECS/2MB chipram... Is there a fix anywhere?

I thought AmosPro works on A3000/AGA machines. Why the hell doesn't it
work on my trustworthy A500+? Lemme guess... It sees "wow, 2MB chip"
and thinks "This is A3K or AGA machine" and activates some kludge... I mean 
"fix", which in turn does not work on A500.

My head just exploded *^(

Get some newer versions, matey!  V1.9 of Turbo is OLD... Try TURBO PLUS - 
its not half as flaky and has a LOT more features... try this:

I like Matthew Gorners idea about incorporating more languages, why not
include  some like (M2, E, C, Oberon, GCC, DICE...).  The list traffic
would increase by 3 fold and may bring a greater number of examples on
code.     Just a thought though...  I wish Europress would support
AMOS again, I guess I just wasted a penny in a dry fountain / well.

 I received a variety of responses to my question about the possible
release of AMOS Pro into the public domain. Some seemed to think it
was highly unlikely given the work that went into creating it (?).
Yet, wasn't the AMOS Pro compiler recently distributed on a magazine
coverdisk?

 Others suggested it may be released eventually but that the time in
between might be better counted in years than months.

 I'd be silly to buy AMOS Pro amidst such uncertainty, but I might
consider buying a used copy. If anyone in Australia wants to get rid
of their copy cheaply (with manual, of course), contact me via email.
My question to the list regards the version(s) I should be looking
for: can all versions be updated to the most recent revision via those
freely distributable upgrades or do I have to look out for a
particular version?

PS. I've read the FAQ.

I have no idea.  I have never had any problems with TURBO.  I do not have the
latest LDos, so I can't say about that.  Is LDos on Aminet?

As far as I know, AMOS is still in the hands of Eurorpress.

Probably not.  They still do their magazine, Amiga Computing.

I already know C, but just don't know all of the Amiga specifics to get sprites
and all that other stuff going.  AMOS makes it easy.

There are already mailing lists for C and I think there is one for the Amiga
aspects.

Do you have Devpac?  You can run Monam and then run AMOSPro through it and
maybe see what is happening.

  I've used AMOS Pro 2.0 with a 68000, OS 2.1, 1MB chip, half-ECS, and I've
had no problems.

  That could be... given Francois, I wouldn't be too surprised.

Perhaps your missing the point here, this is a mailing for
AMOS not for C or any other language.  I for one dont want 
my mailbox full of examples of Oberon and M2.  Perhaps 
a new mailing list is want you want along the lines of
general code for any language.

Yeah I'v had some problems with other extensions such as Turbo1.9   It

The list traffic would increase by more than that, and I would promptly 
drop the list.  If I want C information, I'll join a list for C.  I don't 
have time to sort through uneccesary information, thats why I sub to 
lists and don't read newsgroups - theres much better signal compared to 
the amount of noise.

If you want a general purpose programming list, create one.

  I've used a text buffer of 192k for as long as I can remember, and it
hasn't caused any problems.

  I was a bit inaccurate when I stated that I had had no problems with
AMOS.  I have, in fact, had one problem, that caused by a one-bitplane
default screen.  (Moral: don't use a one-bitplane default screen. :-) )
Other than that, though, Pro has worked fine for me.

In the 80s text adventures were popular, everybody(?) played them.
Nowadays only few if any play these great pieces of computer history (i'm 
talking about 
games like Zork and Lurking Horror by Infocom). Times have changed and
people only enjoy Lucasfilm's and Sierra's games (though they
don't support Amiga anymore sob! :-( ). In my opinion games were much
smarter and educative in the past, but today's games are too simple
with all those fantastic new point&click -systems.

Well, I'm starting soon a new project, it's going to be an
adventure game (text or graphics i dunno) so i need your opinions now.

I have already made a parser which can handle pretty complex
sentences (it's a finnish parser) and it would be easy
to extend it to an adventure. Actually I've made
one text adv. game already called Zhandulin Helmi
but so far almost nobody has told me do they
like it or not (and what's wrong with it, if they don't).

Please tell me, if any1 would like to play textadventures
anymore...  Should I dump the project and start to code
a virtual-reality like system or what?

Anyone?

I've also thought about making an english text adventure
but the problem is: my english is grap!
If there's a finnish dude (who is also interested in text adventures)
somewhere there reading this, please email me! I'd especially like to
hear your opinions.
I can also email Zhandulin Helmi (uuencoded) if somebody wants it..

If you like to flame, go ahead!

Thanks for reading...

Thanks a lot

  No - it comes with the Compiler.

>P.S Which are the differences between v1.12 and v2.0?

  The Compiler and some bug-fixes are all I can think of.  And, now that I
think of it, I don't recall seeing the default screen problem before I
upgraded to 2.0, either.

Don`t you mean the AMOS Classic compiler? That was on an Amiga

Hello fellow list readers.

Since I`m new to the list, I`ll introduce myself.

I`ve been using AMOS since its release many many moons ago,
and I`m currently using AMOS Classic 1.36 and AMOS Pro 1.12
on a A4000/030/882.
I`m mainly interested in graphics programs, and my current
projects are:

1. A 2-D map generator, using the techniques described by
Mike Singleton for his Midwinter program.
2. A raw 24-bit to 16 level greyscale converter (would be 256 level
if AMOS had AGA support :-(. The conversion and plotting is
done in 68k assembler with AMOS used for system setup and
file/memory handling.

I`ve just finished my first degree here at the University of Newcastle
upon Tyne, England, and am about to begin a Robotics PhD here.
(Well, if the University wants to give me free e-mail for another
three years then I`m not going to argue about it:-)

I HATE INFOCOM ADVENTURES!!!!!

But really, I do like text adventures.  They're good if the descriptions
are good anyway.
As for Lucasfilm type adventures, I dunno.  They're cute and all, but
because of the point and click system I think they're too easy....all
the answers are there on the screen if you move the mouse around
(well...almost).
Still, I like the graphics ones better.  Maybe you should compromise and
have graphics, but a textual control rather than mouse.  Have commands
like:

  Walk to shelf.
  Look on shelf.
  Get the Babel fish.
  Stick Babel fish in left nostril.
  Snort.

Well...you get the drift.

There's my opinion anyway.  Long live Zak McCracken!

Carl.

Well, I for one do not like graphics adventures at all. I have 
bought the Secret Treasures of Infocom I and am still happy with it 
(not playing a lot though).

I think text adventures look more intelligent because people have 
come to expect well-formed answers to ill-formed questions. Look at 
Eliza for an example. For some reason it seems harder to get that 
kind of results with graphics.

Any text-adventure would be welcome, but keep in mind that I do not 
understand a word Finnish. On the other hand it might be a 
challenge to produce a graphics adventure that comes across as 
being intelligent. You might want to read some books or articles on 
cognitive science or artificial intelligence on the subject (do not 
know of any, though).

Anyway, good luck!

There are enough reasons to knock Amos, even by Amos coders (well - 
I see complaints about the language on this forum every day). But 
that is beside the point. The reason we all use Amos is because it 
has advantages that supercede the disadvantages. Amos is ideal for:

-prototyping
-interfaces
-intelligent viewers
-(hate to admit it :-)) spaghetti programming
-rereleasing 8-bit classics (i.e. Pacman, Donkey Kong, Break Out)

...and probably some more things I cannot think of right now. I 
mean, would you still be using Amos if it had absolutely no value 
to you? I am afraid you are just being a bit pessimistic.

	So you're talking games like Kings Quest I-III (they lost the textual
interface somewhere between IV and VI).

Perhaps you missed my point! I didn`t mean to write off AMOS completely, I
agree entirely with your comments above. Indeed, AMOS is an ideal language for
"ideas people" (As someone on the list accurately described it as!) Where you
want to try out an idea for a game, or an interface for a program, but need to
knock something up quickly to see if it`s worth pursuing or not. I`m in the
middle of converting the "Aliens" board game into a point and click, "top view"
strategy game! (Looking good so far! Before I release into PD, I`d like to get
peoples opinions on it) But in order to do something like this in C, I would
still be working on an IFF loader!

The whole point of the message was to provoke ideas for continued support for
AMOS.
I for one would like to see AMOS progress further. It has a lot of areas for
improvement.

Just a note that I don't think it would be such a good idea to include 
languages other tha AMOS in this group, for the reason that the focus 
would be so diffused.  And by focusing on AMOS this might become main 
source for keeping it vital, given the question about Europress 
maintaining it.

Help me AmosPro veterans (well, I've had Amos since the day Amos 1.1 was=20
released, but I've been too lazy lately :-)

I have ran out of ideas about what might be wrong with my AmosPro setup.
I tried disabling _all_ non-standard extensions.  Then I loaded a program
that worked perfectly well a few months ago.

I hit "run", and got an error "cannot open math libraries" to the editor's
status line, and then AmosPro hanged.

Sometimes, after I either try "test" or "run" buttons or F1/F2, the mouse
pointer disappears and AmosPro hangs.  If the machine does not crash, click
left-right clicking on mousebuttons solves the situation for 10 seconds or
so, after which the machine hangs again.

Sometimes when I launch Amos, the editor corrupts my program. I have to=20
reboot and reload the program....

This is really frustrating.  I have a bugfixed and updated version=20
of SigMaker  just waiting for some final touches...  It's been=20
lieing on my HD for months now, but I can't do anything with AmosPro now.

My machine is A500Plus, 2MB chip and 2MB fast, with SupraTurbo28.  AmosPro
worked fine earlier on this same setup, except I only had 1MB chipram.  I=
=20
have done heavy rearranging of directories and files, but everything else=
=20
works fine and I did run the "locate_APsystem" program. I rearranged my=20
HD and got 1MB more chip at about the same time that AmosPro stopped workin=
g.
The Chipram AFAIK can't be what is causing the problems, since I have
checked it with various utils and the RAM is OK.

I almost gave up totally on AmosPro, but now I've noticed that programming
in C just isn't as much FUN ;-) so I _must_ get this thing working again.

This is what the AmosPro-directory looks like: Only Ldos and JD_Lib
are in use of the non-standard libraries.

  Well, the Intuition Extension works with Pro. :-)  I believe that Turbo
Plus also has no problems.

  That was me.  I don't have the sources; I was using my debugger to
write the bug-fixing code.  Unfortunately, it didn't work. :-(  I'm
trying to get permission from Europress to continue development of AMOS,
but I haven't heard from them yet.

Status: RO

Am I in the right place?
  Less than a week ago I joined a list that was supposed to discuss amos.  Now 
there's rummblings  to expand the language coverage.  I might be naive, but I'd 
be willing to bet there are other mailing lists that deal with neglected orphan 
languages like C and ASM.

Its bad enough there's no more official support, I don't want to be slowly 
buried in THIS* forum with postings about languages I have no intention of 
learning or using.

On a more practical note:

Can the pro compiler deal with commands generated by turbo ECE etc. ?
If so, when you compile as a stand alone program does it need to find the 
appropriate extension library somewhere or does it imbed the needed code into 
the program?  (the manual talks about amos.library but not extension libraries)

*I apologize for SHOUTING in my last posting.  Would you believe I composed the 
message on an Apple II which has no lower case characters? ...I didn't think 
so.

Well, the README file will help to describe our game:


              *************************************
              *     Amoeba software presents:     *
              *        C H A N E Q U E S          *
              *************************************

                          Made with AMOS
                          Made in Mexico

                        code: Ramses Moreno
                    graphics: Tonatiuh Moreno
                       sound: Tonatiuh Moreno
                       Music: Efren Jimenez

     ============
     INSTRUCTIONS   
     ============

Starting
========

Everything will be ready when you see a dancing spider on a wall. Use a
joystick connected to port 1 to move between options. Push the joystick
button  to  pick  a  choice.  'Begin'  to start the game from the first
level, 'Info'  to see information about the autors and the program, and
'Code' to key in a code  for a specific  level (this codes are given to
you  at  the  end  of  each  succesful  level).  The chaneques are also
controlled with the joystick.

And now?
========

The goal of the game  is to steal all the things you can find on screen
(TV's,  chocolates,  diskkettes,  books,...)  by pushing them through a
interdimensional  door  (commonly  known  as Chandra), but this must be
done before the rooster sings (this one sings by midday). Each chaneque
(whose name are Chanok, Chencho, and Chepo) has distinctive habilities.

The Characters
==============

Chanok.
-------
He can walk, push objects and dig.
-He is selected with the right arrow key.
Walking: Press the joystick to the left or the right to make
  Chanok walk.
Pushing: If  Chanok  is  near  an  object, you may push it by
  simply walking (You can push, but you can not pull).
  You can push several objects at a time.
Digging: Push the button to make  Chanok dig with a pneumatic
  drill, and move in the direction you want him to dig.

Chencho.
--------
-He can walk, push objects and climb.
Walking: Press the joystick to the  left or the right to make
  Chencho walk.
Pushing: If  Chencho  is  near  an object, you may push it by
  simply walking (You can push, but you can not pull).
  You can push several objects at a time.
Climbing: If Chencho  is standing by a wall, you can make him
   walk  vertically  by moving the joystick upwards or
   downwards.

Chepo.
------
He can walk, climb and bridge (bridging?, make a bridge?... )
-He is selected with right arrow key.
Walking: Press  the  joystick  to  the  left or right to make
  Chepo walk.
Climbing: If  Chepo  is  standing by a wall, you can make him
   walk  vertically  by moving the joystick upwards or
   downwards.
Bridging: If  you  press the button, Chepo will make a bridge
   with his  own body. Other chaneques and objects may
   pass over him.


Keys in the game
================

.P.
Pressing  the P key  pauses the game. Time stops and you can go to eat.
To enter the game again, press the joystick button or the P key again.

.M.
If music starts  to harass you, then you can press the M key, and again
to make the music re-start.

.Esc.
With  Esc you can escape the level if you are  in a difficult position.
The  initial  screen  appears again,  so you may try once again. If you
press Esc again,  then you will end up at the  introduction screen. One
more Esc, and you will return to Workbench.

.Arrows.
With arrows you select a chaneque:

Enjoying the game

Play it, boy.

I like playing text adventures!
But they have to be written at least in English!

Search a UK/US help for correcting your errors in English. This should
provide good (in text) adventures.
Also try making new story... not always those set in the past...
What about a futuristic tale?

Well I've never seen this game.. is it on Aminet?

Why not write a hybrid text/gfx adventure, that has words to click on to 
make sentences ("drop", "push", "give" etc), but also has a "command line 
interface" that has a parser? I'm thinking that prehaps it might be a 
really good idea to write a game that has the same sort of screen-layout 
as Monkey Island etc (ie large graphic display with words to click on 
below it), but also has a text-input line. The way this would work is 
this:

The user clicks on words & objects to give orders (eg GET SPADE), and the 
graphic display updates to show this action). As an alternative to this, 
the user could type "Get Spade" in the command-line box.. I can't explain 
this very well, but it's just an idea!

Yes, but it's much better than my finnish! :-)
I'd be willing to help you write an english text adventure if you want..

Hi everyone!

I`ve been trying to think of problems that I`d had with AMOS in the past, that
I could pick all of your brains about! (Imagine what a mess that would make! :)

The only thing that I could come up with appeared *AGES* ago, was when I was
writing a load of routines that simulated Intuition/GadTools within AMOS. (This
was before any Intuition extensions had been thought up!) And that was the
problem of coding slider gadgets. Because the sliders that AMOS offers are
*terrible* :( And the idea was to simulate the look and feel of Workbench 3.

I had all the other routines finished, which were extremely flexible, in fact
they had the same layout and names as the structures in the C GadTools header
file!

I wanted the same flexibiliy in the slider procedure. So that you could enter
any amount into it, and it would calculate the size of the "slider handle".

The routine I did worked, but only some of the time, there would be certain
exceptions were it would give unpredictable results! :)

Somebody must have tackled the same problem! And I would appreciate any help on
the subject. Any ideas?

Regards, Matt.

Hi again!

After I sent the message about slider gadget coding, I came to the conclusion
that we need to have more coding examples in the traffic!

Something that will make people think, "Hey, I`ll try that!"

Have YOU got a procedure that you`re really proud of?

Doesn`t matter how small it is! You never know,  someone might find it really
useful!

	Hear from you all soon! (I`m sure I will! :)

	Mat.
