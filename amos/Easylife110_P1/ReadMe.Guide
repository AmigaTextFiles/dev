			@{u}@{b}The EASY LIFE garuntee@{ub}@{uu}


EASY LIFE is garunteed to:

    a) Not necessarily to what the documentation files say it will

    b) Not necessarily do anything

    c) Not necessarily allow AMOSPro to load

    d) Contain at least 20 spelling misstakes in each file

    e) Really get on your nerves, and not really make your life
       very easy at all, if some command decides it's not going
       to act the way it's described here, but to invalidate your
       hardisk instead.

    f) Run off with your girlfriend/boyfriend/spouse/pet hedgehog.
       (Which of course, can never be ...)

    g) Make disgusting noises when your grandparents enter the room.

    h) Be water resistant to a depth of 50 metres.  

    i) Not to do any dishwashing.

    I do not accept responsibilty if any, or all, or none of the
    aforementioned (Or unmentioned) events occur (except the last one-
    If it does any dishwashing, It's my fault - blame me). If anything
    else goes wrong, or right, or anywhere in between, tough,
    I absolve myself from having anything to do with it. So don't sue
    me. In fact if you are even the type of person that would consider
    the merest possibility of allowing the thought of sueing the author
    of any free computer software to begin to form in your mind, you
    are expressly forbidden from using this software, and must delete
    it instantly. (This also applies to anyone who likes tennis).

@node Foreword "ReadMe / Foreword"


                         @{b}@{u}Welcome To Easylife V1.10@{ub}@{uu}


@{u}Before You Start@{uu}

    Firstly, if you don't have a MagicWB palette as your defaults, ensure
    your  current  screenmode  is  exactly 8 colours  and  click  on  the 
    "UseIconPalette"  to see these icons in their full glory.  MagicWB is
    not required to use easylife - I just like that style of icon.

    Secondly,  make sure you  have read  every Terry  Pratchett  book  in
    existance (Except Strata, which for some wierd reason was crap). This
    will help you understand some of the more technical  terminology used
    in the Easylife documentation.

    Easylife is an extension for AMOS Professional V1.00+.  It provides
    some  improved  variable  manipulation  capabilities, including the
    addition  of  structured,  or  "record  type" variables.  Also AMOS
    command/function  interfaces  for  the  popular  powerpacker  & XPK
    libraries  are  provided, together with the less well known pattern
    library,  which  provides  UNIX  style pattern matching on strings.
    (This  is also available in amiga Dos library V37+).  There is also
    a  large  group of commands & functions which enable you to use the
    Magic User Interface (MUI) system for you AMOS interface code.  Who
    needs intuition???

    The extension's features are supplimented by a set of new AMOSPro
    accessory programs. These are not only very useful, but also serve
    as examples of using the easylife commands & functions. They include:

  - The Variable Checker. This accessory will check your source
    codes for errors not detected by the AMOS 'Test' function,
    such as the mis-spelling of a variable name, and will also
    find redundent code, such as procedures that are never called.

  - The Editor Enhancer. This accessory replaces the AMOS editors
    search & replace menu with improved versions, and adds 4 small
    user menu utilities.

  - The Zone Editor. This accessory will allow you to draw your
    zones on the screen with the mouse, then save them as a bank,
    or write 'Set Zone' commands straight into your source code!

  - The Taglist Editor. An example of an MUI application, this
    accessory allows you to create MUI taglists for your own MUI
    programs.

  - The Structures Compiler. This is necessary for you to use
    structured variables in your AMOSPro programs. The definitions
    of the structures are stored in comments in your program
    source code, and are converted into global variables & a bank
    by this accessory.

  - Amosguide. This accessory replaces your on-line help viewer with
    an amigaguide document reader. A patch to create an amigaguide
    file from your AMOSPro help is on disk 3 of the distribution.

@node Requirements "Readme / Requirements"

                               @{b}@{u}Requirements@{ub}@{uu}

    The minimum requirements are:

  - An amiga with 1Mb ram.

  - Any version of AMOSPro.


    To use the XPK compression features, you will require the XPK
    master library, and some XPK compressor libraries. These can
    be found in the XPK package on aminet in /pub/aminet/util/pack.

    To use the MUI features, you will need at least 2Mb of ram, 
    Kickstart 2.04 or greater (3.0+ recommended), and of course
    a copy of @{"MUI" link mui}.

    
    Not necessary, but of use are:

  - A copy of powerpacker professional (The comercial version)

  - ASL library autodocs / include files (For MUI use of asl)

  - The AMOSPro inuition extension (For creating MUI programs with
    their own screens).

@node Contents "Readme / Archive Contents"


                             @{b}@{u}Archive Contents@{ub}@{uu}

    Easylife is distributed as 3 archives, this file being in the
    first of them. Floppy disk users should have extracted them to
    the root directories of 3 floppy disks. Harddisk users can
    extract the archives to temporary directories on the RAM: disk
    or on the harddisk if you don't have the memory. 

    NOTE: The files in archive 3 are not required permanently - only
    to create an amigagudie on-line help file. If you are low on memory, 
    extract & install the programs on disks 1 & 2, then do disk 3 later.
    

    @{u}Part 1@{uu}

    This disk contains the initial installation files, the accessory
    programs, the demo programs, replacemnt AMOSPro icons, useful

@node Distribution "Readme / Distribution Conditions "

                   @{b}@{u}Distribution Conditions@{ub}@{uu}


@{u}Section 1: This Package@{uu}

    This package is freeware. It is not in the public domain. This means
    you may distribute in anyway you see fit, as long as both archives
    are distributed, and are not modified (apart from extracting them to
    disks, and distributing the disks). A charge of no more than twice
    the price of a floppy disk + actual postage paid may be charged to
    cover distriubiton expenses.


@{u}Section 2: Programs which use easylife@{uu}

    If you want to distribute a program of your own which uses easylife,
    the following conditions apply.

  - The file AMOSPro_Easylife.Lib may be included if needed. Also, any
    file from the procedures directory may be merged with your source
    code. You may also distribute AmigaGuide.AMOS if you use it for on-
    line help, but then you must also include AmigaGuide.Guide.

  - The file Easylife.Readme from the Misc Directory must be included
    with the distribution, and it must be one of your programs conditions
    that it is not removed.

  - You must send me by E-Mail or on disk a copy of the program. If it is
    a shareware program, send the registered version, along with anything
    else you offer to registered users. If it is a commercial program,
    send it in the form sold to the public with all packaging and
    documentation. 


@{u}Section 3: Exceptions@{uu}

  - Some of the files in this archive are in the public domain. This will
    be made clear at the top of the file. If no mention of distribution
    conditions is made, the above applies.


@endnode

@node Installation "Readme / Installation"


                               @{b}@{u}Installation@{ub}@{uu}

    The installation of easylife falls into 3 phases - Getting all the
    file in the right places, then configuring AMOSPro to use them, then
    setting up the on-line help. The First stage is carried out by the 
    installer script. If you do not have the installer, manual installation
    instructions follow below. How to install each part of the distribution 
    into AMOSPro is described in the installation section of the 
    documentation for each program. Finally you must patch your AMOSPro
    help file into amigaguide format. Everything you need to do this is
    in archive 3 of this package.


    @{u}Manual Floppy Disk Installation@{uu}

    You should have extracted the 2 parts of the easylife archive onto
    2 floppy disks. Relabel these "Easylife1" and "Easylife2", this disk
    being Easylife1.

    Copy the contents of the libs directory of this disk into your 
    AMOSPro_System Disks libs directory. If you already have some of
    these libraries check that these are newer versions before copying.

    Copy:

    Lib/AMOSPro_Easylife.Lib          To AMOSPro_System:APSystem/
    Lib/AMOSPro_Default_Resource.Abk  To AMOSPro_System:APSystem/
    Lib/Default_Resource.IFF          To AMOSPro_Accessories:System_Iffs/


    When installing accessories programs into the user menu, as described
    in the seperate guides for those accessories, the actual accessory
    programs can be left in Easylife2:Accessories, as there will not be
    room in AMOSPro_Accessories.



    @{u}Manual Installation Hard Disk@{uu}

    The first thing you should to is run AMOSPro, then quit immediately.
    This will create the assigns for the AMOS disk names used below. You
    should have extracted the easylife archives to any temporary location.

    Copy the contents of the libs directory from the 1st part of the archive
    into your harddisk LIBS: directory. If you already have some of
    these libraries check that these are newer versions before copying.

    Copy:

    Lib/AMOSPro_Easylife.Lib          To AMOSPro_System:APSystem/
    Lib/AMOSPro_Default_Resource.Abk  To AMOSPro_System:APSystem/
    Lib/Default_Resource.IFF          To AMOSPro_Accessories:System_Iffs/


    From part 2 of the archive, copy the contents of the accessories
    drawer into AMOSPro_Accessories: drawer. The Docs drawer of part 2
    should be copied into somewhere on the help path (I.E. The HELP: 
    device is assigned to the drawer, either directly, or using assign
    add). You can either copy them into your usualy HELP: drawer, or
    put this directory somewhere else, and multi-assign it. (E.g. Make
    AMOSPro_Tutorials/Docs, and put these files there, along with other
    amos programs documentation).

    The Procedures, MUI & Demos drawers may be copied anywhere you
    chose. Some recommendations are:

    Procedures:  AMOSPro_Productivity2/Procedures/Easylife/
    MUI:         AMOSPro_Productivity2/MUI/
    Demos:       AMOSPro_Productivity1/EasylifeDemos/

    Easylife is being continually upgraded as I find bugs, or requie
    more features from AMOSPro. If you can think of any new features
    you would like to see, please @{"Contact Me" link Author}.

    Every new version, beta or full will be uploaded to the PLAYFIELD!
    AMOS WWW SITE. 


    @{u}Web Access:@{uu}

    Open the URL 'http://www.mhs.edu/~achurch/amos/' then select from the
    menus the links 'Software', 'Extensions', 'Easylife'. Then select
    the version to download.

    
    @{u}FTP Access:@{uu}

    FTP to 'gate.net' and give a login of 'ftp' and your E-Mail address
    as a password. The easylife file can be found in the directory
    '/pub/amos/software/extension'. The filename will be EasylifeXXX.lha
    where XXX is the version number without the '.'


    Full non-beta versions will also be uploaded the aminet in the
    directory '/pub/aminet/dev/amos' with the same filename. You can
    connect to aminet at (among others):

    ftp.luth.se
    wuarchve.wustl.edu
    src.doc.ic.ac.uk

    Again login as 'ftp' with your E-Mail address as password.


    @{u}By E-Mail:@{uu}

    The src.doc.ic.ac.uk aminet server also has ftpmail access. Send
    a message with the body text 'HELP' to ftpmail@doc.ic.ac.uk for
    details. 


    @{u}By Snail-Mail@{uu}

    From the UK, you may send a Stamped Addressed Envelope containing
    3 Disks (The program may grow) to @{"me" link Author}, and I'll
    send you back the latest version. (Notice I didn't say blank disks -
    I'd be much happier to find other AMOS Programs, or PD/Shareware
    software on them, especially if it is not on aminet).

    You can also write to me from other countries if you supply suitable
    UK coinage for return postage, or have any UK stamps lying around...

    The person you'd like blame (But can't because I said so in the
    distribution conditions / legal stuff) for this softare is Paul
    Hickman, an undergraduate computing student at Imperial College
    in London, England. Easylife has been going on for 2 or 3 years
    now, being extended whenever I needed something new from AMOS.

    Do you need anything from AMOS that isn't there? Then E-Mail me
    your ideas. I also want to know of any bugs / quirks in the
    programs, or if you have any ideas for improvements. Feel free
    to E-Mail me as @{b}ph@doc.ic.ac.uk@{ub} until June 1996 when
    my course finishes.

    After then (Or before if you have no E-Mail), I can be contacted

                          This application uses


                        MUI - MagicUserInterface

                (c) Copyright 1993/94 by Stefan Stuntz


MUI is a system to generate and maintain graphical user interfaces. With
the  aid  of  a  preferences program, the user of an application has the
ability to customize the outfit according to his personal taste.

MUI is distributed as shareware. To obtain a complete package containing
lots of examples and more information about registration please look for
a  file  called  "muiXXusr.lha"  (XX means the latest version number) on
your local bulletin boards or on public domain disks.

          If you want to register directly, feel free to send


                         DM 30.-  or  US$ 20.-

    Easylife does not require MUI, except of course if you want to use
    the MUI interface commands. However, since these are so powerfull,
    you'd be a complete idiot not to. The aforementioned "muiXXusr.lha"
    can be found on @{"aminet" link Upgrades} in the "/pub/aminet/dev/gui" drawer, along
    with a "muiXXdev.lha" archive which you should also download.

@node Credits "Readme / Credits"

Easylife, the accessories & the documentation is written entirely by 
@{"Paul Hickman" link author}.  However if would not have been possible
without some help. Thanks go to:

  - Michael Cox, Ryan Scott & Ben Marty for suggestions and bug
    spotting with the extension & it's support programs.

  - Andrew Chruch for the masses of technical information about AMOS he
    regularly posts to the AMOS-Mailing List, which has made some of these
    commands possible.

  - Mike Sikorsky, on whose AMOS powerpacker procedures the Elpp commands
    were orignally based.

  - Stefan Stuntz for creating MUI - Easily the best GUI I have seen.
    
  - Urban Dominik Mueller & Andreas M. Kirchwitz for the CSH shell with
    which I organised the archives.

  - Urban Dominik Mueller (again), Kristian Neilsen & All the other
    authors of XPK.

  - Nico Francois for powerpacker library & Angela Schmidt for pattern
    library.

  - Chad Randall for Iconian, Electronic Arts for DpaintIV, and anyone
    who has uploaded XPK icons to aminet from which I took icons, bits of
    images and templates for this distributions icons.

  - Roger Nedel whose badlinks program found all (?) the errors in my
    amiga guide links.

  - Francois Lionet for writing AMOS.


Anti-Thanks go to:

  - Christian Mumenthaler for writting Colonial Conquest II. Without it,
    this lot would probably have been released a week or two earlier. 
    Please don't write anymore excellent AMOS strategy games.

  - Anyone who has posted a message comparing Blitz-Basic to AMOS. Frankly,
    I don't care about it, and I am pissed off with all the junk mail.

  - The BBC who will undoubtedly broadcast wimbledon yet again. (I *Hate*
    tennis).

  - Francois Lionet for writting such bug ridden code when writting AMOS.
