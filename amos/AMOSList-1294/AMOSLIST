Does anyone know if there is a way to force Amos Pro to print to a file
(using Print #, of course 8^) using a forced floating-point format?  So
that...

     A#=1

     1.0

Thanks for the help!!

The delay on everything except strings would be neglibigle - after all, 
copying an
integer so only a move instruction or two. If you have the capability to load 
your
strings at a particular memory address, you can use St Get (As opposed to St 
Get$)
to obtain the address of the string, which for example could be passed as the 
buffer
address of a DOS library Read() call to load directly into a buffer.

Not necessarily. Depends on how you organised the banks. With structures it is 
particularly easy to build trees which can be very quickly searched ( Order 
log n)
if the elements are inserted in order. And for sorting, you won't have to copy 
the
strings around - just change the pointers. You may get some help from a 
computer
science text book on abstract data types, most of which go into great detail 
about 
the different types of data structures you can build with pointers, and the 
efficiency
of reading / changing each. They will also give you some good sorting 
algorithmns.

A good example of where structured variables are faster is the easylife 
variable checker,
which runs 2-3 times faster now I have changed it to store the internal lists 
of variable
names in structures. I am also currently adapting an asteroids game I once 
wrote to use
structures.

The number of instructions executed during the average structure access is not 
very
high - the only loops occur in finding the correct structure if an element 
name is used
in more than one, and in processing the indexes of arrays. Other than that it 
is basically
a fairly short bit of straight line code - The differicult bits were the 
memory allocator,
and the initial structures compiler program (Later versions used structured 
variables
themselves).


On the MUI front I'd be interested to hear your (and anyone elses) ideas, as I 
don't
think many people have used that.

it is not compatible with my version.

Any ideas who may have a copy?

Mant Thanks.

I need to read the date and time from a 1200 with AMOS The Creator.

I can't find anything in the User Guide for AMOS about reading the system 
clock. Is it possible????

If there is no simple 'PRINT TIME' command, can I access it by peeking
at the memory location where the time data is stored? And if so, where is
that register(s)?

Many thanks.

    I haven't test it but I think you can use banks.Say you have a 
bank and you want to change its length.Just reserve a new one with 
the desirable size and copy the contents of the old, to the new 
one.
    Example:
    During runtime you access Bank No #1
        
    bnum=1
    reserve as work bnum,<size>
        .
        .
        .
    reserve as work 999,<new size>
    copy bnum to 999 ' I don't remember the command now (I'm at the 
Univ.
    reserve as work bnum,<new size>
    copy 999 to bnum
    
    Another untested way is poking the addresses BEFORE the Start(n) 
address.See the manual.

P.S.  I 'll send you the answer of the second way later...

Hi Mike,

I realize I am not reading anymore the Amos List. I tried to unsubscribe
some days ago but it didn't work. Can you do this manually. I'll probably
keep in touch with Amos using the archive you upload to Aminet...

Thanks in advance,

If some one gets this, could they send me uuencoded version as I only have

	I'm writing my own bob and sprite handling routines 
for my 1200 under Amospro. These routines can use full AGA capacities.
The 256 colors bobs works fine, but are too slow....:-(. I discover that 
recoding the screen using the copper would speed up the blitting. Amos is
really good for coding games , but when you have to access the hardware 
directly, the job can be done faster and better in C. Also the compiler 
doesn't produce code for 020,030,040 and 68882 copros, doesn't optimize 
the code (see GCC) and the amos degugger (Monitor) really sucks!!!
(see SAS cpr,  REAL debugger). So I decided to do all the job using C.
It's why i am very interest in MARP... I have just one question about
MARP : will MARP support AGA using highly-optimized-direct-hardware-access?
If not, I think I go to do my own ARP during the christmas holidays...

	 I have a big question about sprites : in the sprite bank, bobs are
stored plane by plane and this is good for blittering (but slow). Sprites
lists needs a line by line coding(i.e. 1st line of the 1st plane until 1st
line of the last plane, then 2nd line ...). Therefore sprite memory 
storing isn't compatible with the bob one. So I thougth that when the
'sprite' command is called, amos recoded the image datas in another place
in memory, but I watch the memory just before and after a sprite call, and
I noticied no change. So, does amos use a special copperlist to handle 
sprites and bobs using the same memmory data, or are they another way ?

PS: I hope you don't suffer too much reading my really bad english... :-)

Some information for you all, attached!  CEI has an account on our 
machine here at CyberGate and I've been talking to them.  It looks very 
very promising!

    it will... but it is not a high priority rigth now... I want to
 get most Amos functionalty first.. then go and produce more 
 specialized routines... I hopefully should have some of these done
 for the second release...

   I thought sprites/bobs were stored exactly the same way... I don't
 have my Amiga in front of right now so I can't check... but I remeber
 doing stuff like to convert an Sprite->Icon bank by just hacking
 the header of the bank... but no imgae data... ?

This is a SMALL part of the IRC conf with the Prez of CEI, I merely included a
few of my comments. This only contains a few of the parts that I wanted to
comment on. Watch the next Amiga Report for the complete transcript which
covers many more topics and plans....

IRC log started Tue Nov 29 14:51

<alex_cei> We are overwhelmed by the response from around the world today.
The support has been incredible, our hope is to finalize the deal shortly and
bring back the Amiga!

        Good :)

<Overlord_> Will you [alex] consider using GLint chips for the amiga?

    <LehmanNAV> [Request for clarification: what is GLint?]
    <LehmanNAV> [GLint is a 3D gfx chip from 3DLabs -Thanks EdS]

<alex_cei> No, the Commodore engineering team was working on
<alex_cei> a chip set with superior performance with a lower cost.
<alex_cei> This chip was internally referred as a 3d/risc chip set.
--
        Boy this better be one cool little chip. I would like to know more
about it. IS it a RISC processor or more a RISC GFX chip.

<gabe> ok what my question is what do you think about DSP? and also about 040
for a base cpu for the amiga (ie 040 1200, 040 cd32) and WHat about amiga dos
on a risc machine? (no windows nt) one more thing what about tcp/ip in
amiga's? thanks
--------
        Motorola is going to ship a new 040 chip that is created with RISC in
mind, this chip (if I remember all this right from the artical in EE times) is
2x2mm Dye size runs 2.2volt and very cool. I am imagining that it could run at
100Mhz easily as well.. We will see. This chip is going to be ALOT cheaper
than the current 040s and could indeed be the base minimum chip for all the
Machines.
--------
<alex_cei> First and foremost, DSP are good and necessary but, the
co-development of applications is necessary. As the price of the 68040 is
reduced it will make the processor attractive for low end platforms.
The general transition has been to start with the advance processors on the
high end machines and migrate to the low end as price permits.... The OS needs
to migrate to a new processor within the next twelve months.  There is no
reason that the new Amigas can't be multi-os machines.  AmigaDos first and
everything else is just the topping on the cake.

--------
They better still run ALL 68k software or it is lost.
--------

<peman> Will next Amiga have the ZorroIII bus, or what bus will be used in
future Amiga?
<alex_cei> The Zorro bus is as important to the Amiga as AmigaDos.  I believe
the next generation machine should have the Zorro and the PCI bus.  This will
enable developers to add products relatively easilly.

--------
PCI! YES! Gimme! :) This would secure many sales for people.
--------

<Jason-AR> 1.  What is the current status of your bid and the negotiations?
<Jason-AR> 2.  Are you making any deals with the UK? 

<alex_cei> CEI is in the final negotiating stages with the trustee.  If all
goes well and there are no legal roadblocks there is a possibility that the
contract can be signed early next week.  The inventory situation remains
murky. Commodore's raw material inventory was moved from the old C= factory to
a warehouse where a number of product were lost or misplaced.  Our goal is
to reintroduce the Amiga as soon as possible so the material issue is
important. There is also an abundance of legal issues which are being
resolved.  If all goes well an announcment will be made upon the signing.
As far as the UK status, CEI is willing to work with whatever party to make
the Amiga succesfull. Our plan calls for opening up a new operation in the UK
and Germany within the next sixty days.  These operations will be staffed by
the most competent individuals possible (either old/new Amiga management) and
new blood .

--------
I hope this doesnt take another 2 months... this is getting real old
--------

<Bewdah> Sorry to interrupt, but what about including a better text editor,
paint program, term program, etc  ala IBM OS's? Ed really stinks.

<alex_cei> ABSOLUTELY....What about a terminal program to communicate with
Internet? The possibilites are boundless.  I fully realize that our look and
feel needs to be more professional and "zappier".

--------
I am beginning to really like this Alex Armor guy.. WB3.2 should ship with all
new EDitors, a nice terminal like Terminus with advancements (they could buy
rights to it), AS225 from Interworks (latest soon to be released version),
Envoy, and Icons like NewIcons and other great PD hacks that really improve
things. These wouldnt add more than 3 disks to the OS.
--------

<alex_cei> When we acquire the assets from Commodore we will be getting 17
engineers.  Plans call to increase that number to 103 by the end of the year.
We will also be working closely with other manufacturers i.e. Ameristar for
networking, etc.

--------
Ameristar? For software or Hardware? interesting.
--------

<Fila> Will you continue to make  and support CD32's

<alex_cei> Yes.  But, I see the future as an Amiga 1200 type machine with a
built in CD.  We  must be realistic that competing with the big boys(Nintendo,
SEGA) will be extremely difficult.  Lets take the advantages of our technology
and move them forward. The CD32 is a great unit for interactive kiosk
applications.  The next machine will utilizing the new technology has a better
chance agaisnt the big boys.  Unfortunately, C= lost too much valuable time
with the CD32 and trying to bring it back will simply cost too much.

--------
Smart Man, All Amigas need to come with CDs and be 99% CD32 compat, this will
drive the market of CD32 games incredibly.
--------

<alex_cei> PS. Most people will not purchase an Amiga because it will run NT
but, some will not buy it because it doesnt. CO-development with Scala is not
out of the question. CEI has an excellent relationship with SCALA. We look
forward to working with them in the future.

--------
Exactually, The Amiga should NOT run NT stock, but if it could run it, it
would be VERY nice and attract alot of people. And it is a good thing they
work With Scala, Scala is a nice company, it would be nice to have a bit of
Scale worked into the OS.
--------

<Axios> Is a CD-ROM unit with CD32 and MPEG support for the A4000 on the list
of immediate releases once things get going?

<alex_cei> YES!

--------
Cool! I would love to see all the new machines come with a Mpeg chip Socket
and ATI/CEI sell the little mpeg cards/chips to fill them later when the user
wants to upgrade.
--------

<Tachy> HI Alex, will future releases of the Amiga-OS support
memory-protection by MMU like OS/2, UNIX and others? As a programmer, I think
we should care about the efficient OS and multitasking of this machine too...
what does CEI think about it?

<alex_cei> Remember, I'm not an engineer or a programmer.  I believe that the
market expects that all Amigas be equipped with MMUs.  

--------
Boy, programmers are gonna love this guy. MMUs should be in EVERY amiga from
now on. You cant even run enforcer without one.... not to mention VM.
--------

<alex_cei> CEI
<alex_cei> 5555 West Flagler Street
<alex_cei> Miami, FL 33134
<alex_cei> USA
<alex_cei> Att: Amiga Suggestions
<alex_cei> Once we have accomplished the acquisition we will publish the
E-mail address.

--------
They should have someone answer mail all the time from a suggestions@ati.com
or something like that.
--------

<alex_cei> RTG is the top item on our need list.  It's time has come.

--------
correct
--------

<alex_cei> We have taken a close look at the SGI, Windows, etc.  They look and
feel more professional then our beloved Amiga.  

--------
Unfortunately very true, while the Amiga runs it the smoothest, the most
effiecently, and the coolest, it doesnt look real professional.
--------

<alex_cei> I believe there is room for improvement on the basic Amiga 1200.
This does not necessarily mean a redo on the machine but, might mean new
models (A1400, A1600, etc.).The working name is currently Amiga Technologies
International, remember this is subject to change depending on the legal
types.

--------
And 4MB fast Ram, and a CD (he said they all get that), and a 040.. :)
--------

<dracon> The amiga has always been a great sounding machine since the 500
<dracon> What ideas have CEI got for the enhancement of the amigas sound
capabilities? 16bit audio, inbuilt midi support?

<alex_cei> Again, DSP is instrumental (pun intended) to move the Amiga in the
sound theater.

--------
I hope it is basically fully compat with the old Paula so the old nice progs
scan still run things.

        Hi,

        Tim Dee wondered whether it was possible to read the clock from AMOS.
As I remember with AMOS 1.3, a procedure called GetTime.AMOS was included which
when modified quite a lot will actaully give you a very nice little clock
indeed. I do not have the routine with me at the moment, but I can mail it to
the list if anybody wants it along with my updated version for getting the day
of the year and other things.

        See ya.

                                Del.

Nenad,

C isn't really that great for hardware hitting, it's best for OS compliant
applications.  If all you need is AGA stuff in Amos, your very best bet
is to write an Amos Extension in Assembly that will do the hardware hitting
you need.  From your description, I bet you have been doking/poking/loking
the blitter all from within Amos?  If so, writing those routines in an ASM
Extension will be MUCH faster, and you'll still have the power of all of
Amos' other commands.

Well, about dynamic banks...
I thought on them for some time and cannot Paul add a 
Banklenghtadd(bytes) command? I don't know, call it Elbnkadd(number,bytes)
or better Elbnkadd(number of the bank, position, bytes).
This will solve many problems.
Poking directly with the bank's lenght is quite dangerous as you could 
overlap memory used for something else.
And copying the bank is quite slow if you have a large bank. 

Any ideas or comment?

Where I can find the MakeLib extension?
Remember... I cannot program in C, so a simple command would be much better!

Errrr... what does you want more precisely?
Do you need a 8 way scrolling routine? 
I have one made with turbo extension which is really smooth and uses 
16x16 pixels icons. With standard commands it is a bit slower.

And it is very easy to use and change to your needs.

	How about using MakeLib extension (1.6kb) which has some nice mem.
	allocation + list handling routines ??

	Like:

	BUFFER = Ma Malloc (1024,MEM_PUBLIC)
	if BUFFER
		<Do what ever you want to do for BUFFER (1024 bytes)>
		Ma Free (BUFFER) : Rem Free BUFFER
	End If

	You can also forget Ma Free or can use Ma Free All (Which is
	automatically executed when quitting AMOSPro or compiled AMOS
	program)

	This is something I call _dynamic_ memory allocationg AMOS banks(tm)
	sucks.

    You were right! I tried to poke Start(banknum)-20 address.
    ( Loke Start(bank)-20,size).Then I executed ListBank command and 
the size was altered!I said great and tryed to re-run it getting a 
GURU from exec library (free twice) as an answer! So forget it!
    When I suggested using Copy to copy two banks I meant the command 
Copy start(bank1),start(bank1)+length(1) To Start(bank2).Is it slow?
    You don't have to use C.You can also allocate memory using the 
exec routine AllocMem().You can call whichever routine from OS you 
want within AMOS.

Yes, I'm searchin a command to add space to a bank as data get bigger.
Just think a text editor where you can write from 0 to 1MB of text.
It would be stupid reserve 1MB of memory if you only want to write "hello 
everybody!". And if always a limitation.
If I could add space as your text is going bigger it would be a great thing.

However, thanks

	I thought there already was a bank resizing command.  Yeah, there is,
but I think it's only in AMOS Pro... unfortunately it can only shrink a bank
(I think it's called bank shrink).  I guess you're looking for a way to expand
banks.

	Perhaps you can use the Free (or Fast Free or Chip Free?) command
to reserve a portion of the total memory availabe (so you don't get an error
by allocating more than is available) and hope that they don't wont to do
something else at the same time :) ... maybe you can reserve a portion
of the total memory and allow them to reduce it if they want to use less.
Or perhaps you can reserve one bank for every 10k and join them into a single
bank at 100k (sounds like it'd get complicated though).  But maybe the best
way since I don't think copying is THAT slow is this:  Reserve 10k.  When the
10k is full, reserve another bank at 20k, copy, bank swap with the old bank
(so the current bank number is always the same), then erase the 10k bank.
When it reackes 20k, reserve 30k etc....  Also, double check and make sure
there isn't a bank expand command or something in AMOS pro... or have you
already?

Well, I did but I didn't find anything. Maybe I have miss it (as the

How many time does it takes copying a 300K bank, by the way?

	Hey, if anybody else has similar problems, let me know.  I can mail
whatever you're interested in directly to you.  I'll post a list of the
available programs for which I have source code right here.  I don't want to
post full programs on the list, however.  This listing may even be pushing
the the limits.

Alien Life

This is nothing like a normal life program. It was simply an interesting
experiment in stack/queue use in AMOS - using the storage to store coordinates.
It's often useful in mazes, I've also had fun using stacks and queues in flood
fills and other design makers. This is one interesting result.

IFF->ANSI Converter

This converts an IFF picture (prefferably Hi-Res) into ANSI codes which will
reproduce the same picture PIXEL for PIXEL when displayed using the type
command in AmigaShell. It can handle up to 8 colors (3 planes). In order to see
8 colors on the Workbench screen, you may have to get a program to set the
number of bitplanes on Workbench. I've tried typeing the resultant file in
WB2.0 and it did not look so pretty, but it works great on an Amiga 500 w/
WB1.3 in AmigaShell. The only thing you have to check for is the palette, I
don't believe there are ANSI codes to set the palette.

EasyRainbow Generator

This program contains a subroutine that will generate smooth AMOS "rainbows"
given the starting and ending color. It is optional to make the rainbow slightly
wavy. With the waviness turned off, the rainbow still looks banded, but if the
waviness is enabled, the rainbow looks very smooth.

Filled Polygons

This program lets you draw polygons with up to 10000 sides. Rather than using
AMOS' Polygon command, it manually draws a filled polygon. This is a great
demonstration program with copious comments. It also demonstrates a linked list
in AMOS since the edges are stored in a linked list.

Linked List

This demonstrates the use of linked list in AMOS. Included in the
implementation of linked lists is the ability to store strings, insert before,
insert after, delete, set the current element (move forward or backward),
retrieve the current element and collect garbage (re-structure the list after
elements have been deleted).

Mandelbrot Generator

The Mandelbrot routine in this program implements the parameters without
directly passing them so that the subroutine can be compiled separately from
the program and used in an uncompiled program. This program contains a
demonstration of how to use the routine. You may specify the resolution,
position, size, and area of the Mandelbrot set to display.

MazeMaster 3D

This program allows you to: 

     Generate & save mazes of specified size 
     Re-Load Mazes from RAM: 
     Automatically solve mazes and save solution to RAM: 
     Explore mazes in 3D 


Memory

Remember the sequences played on the four colored buttons. Play back as many
as you can. 3 rounds per game. Update the code to fit your own preferences.

Plot 3-D

3D plotting and rotation for Red&Blue 3-D glasses. Precalculates 18 frames of a
rotating cube and then bounces them all over.

Sentence Maker

Generate funny random sentences. The code which optionally outputs the
sentence to the printer has been commented out so AMOS doesn't lock up if you
don't have a printer.

You could always do it like this:

B#=A#*100 (or more, depending on how many decimal places you want)
A$=Str$(B#)
B$=Left$(A$,Len(A$)-2) (for 2 dec places)
B$=B$+"."
C$=Right$(A$,2)
B$=B$+C$
Print #1,B$
and so on

Yes, you're right, but if I had to learn all OS calls I'd go for C!

It might do, but it would only reserve a new longer bank, and copy old one over
it, then delete the original and call bankswap to change the numbers (Which was
the original solution to this problem). As this is 
 
a) Only a few lines of code

b) Rarely Executed (I.E. It wouldn't be in a fast loop)

c) Crap coding anyway is it uses at least double the memory of the bank

I don't think it is worth adding to easylife. A much better solution is to use
some form a dynamic memory allocation - I.E. instead of making the
bank larger, reserve another bank for the extra data. 

In practice its easier to reserve memory for each structure seperately, 
which is what both easylife & makelib do.

Quite dangerous is an understatement. DON'T DO THIS.

I don't call this dynamic. It is only as dynamic as:

trap Reserve as work bnkno,1024
if not errtrap
	'Do whatever
	Erase bnkno
endif

Makelib's linked list structure is dynamic, but is restrictive in that it is 
only
a list - you can't build arbitary structures, and accessing the elements of
the list still involves poking & peeking the memory of the list. Whilst this is
faster than easylife's structures representation it does mean that you have
no type-checking on the list elements, and if you change the format of the
data poked/peeked you have to rewrite your code, not to mention the
readability stinks.

However the linked list is still a much better solution than trying to use
Ma Alloc, or Reserve as work for this purpose.

> 
> Where I can find the MakeLib extension?

It is on nic.funet.fi in the /systems/amiga/programming/amos directory. 
Don't ask me why when there is an aminet mirror at the same site!

	I'm writing my own bob and sprite handling routines 
for my 1200 under Amospro. These routines can use full AGA capacities.
The 256 colors bobs works fine, but are too slow....:-(. I discover that 
recoding the screen using the copper would speed up the blitting. Amos is
really good for coding games , but when you have to access the hardware 
directly, the job can be done faster and better in C. Also the compiler 
doesn't produce code for 020,030,040 and 68882 copros, doesn't optimize 
the code (see GCC) and the amos degugger (Monitor) really sucks!!!
(see SAS cpr,  REAL debugger). So I decided to do all the job using C.
It's why i am very interest in MARP... I have just one question about
MARP : will MARP support AGA using highly-optimized-direct-hardware-access?
If not, I think I go to do my own ARP during the christmas holidays...

	 I have a big question about sprites : in the sprite bank, bobs are
stored plane by plane and this is good for blittering (but slow). Sprites
lists needs a line by line coding(i.e. 1st line of the 1st plane until 1st
line of the last plane, then 2nd line ...). Therefore sprite memory 
storing isn't compatible with the bob one. So I thougth that when the
'sprite' command is called, amos recoded the image datas in another place
in memory, but I watch the memory just before and after a sprite call, and
I noticied no change. So, does amos use a special copperlist to handle 
sprites and bobs using the same memmory data, or are they another way ?

PS: I hope you don't suffer too much reading my really bad english... :-)

Well, about dynamic banks...
I thought on them for some time and cannot Paul add a 
Banklenghtadd(bytes) command? I don't know, call it Elbnkadd(number,bytes)
or better Elbnkadd(number of the bank, position, bytes).
This will solve many problems.
Poking directly with the bank's lenght is quite dangerous as you could 
overlap memory used for something else.
And copying the bank is quite slow if you have a large bank. 

Any ideas or comment?

  Because some of us (like myself) have to go to a lot of trouble to get
news, or simply cannot get it at all.  Also, this mailing list is for a
specific purpose, unlike a.a.s.d, and it doesn't have a very high volume.

	You've tried to be specific, but I still don't understand.  Perhaps if
you mention what kind of a program you're trying to write.  Is it some kind
of landscape rendering program?  And tell us how, exactly, this particular
method is necessary.

Yes, I did receive it.  My questions were:

Is it because I have the unregistered version (and you should be receiving my
registration fee any day now) and screens won't close that the system hangs
after the program ends?

And is there a specific procedure (or order) to opening intuition screens and
windows?

Right now, if I open a window, the system dies right away.

Unrelated question:  What is the latest version of the music extension?

Well met and godspeed,

Subject: Map Creation
Content-Length: 1028
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Hi,
     I've just remembered what I thought I had forgotten to fail to not
remember about. (I think)
 
     As part of my Eternity project, I will be needing a map creation program.
If anyone has one, or knows how to write one or whatever, this is what I need..
 
   World Creation - the ability to make an entire world, not just an island
                    (similar to civilisation).
 
   Sizeable - I don't want to be restricted to just a single map size.
 
   Customisable - I want to be able to define what type of planet will be
                  produced, ie. barren, desert, snow, etc.
 
   3d - Yep, I need it in 3d too, with a few different terrain heights, from
                  sub-aqua to mountaintop
 
   Features - such as rivers, lakes, trees.
 
 
I realise that this is a lot to ask for, but and help would be appreciated. As
my attempts have only been partially successful :*)

OK, let me try again.  I want to use some kind of fractal routine to
generate two sets of code:

The first will fractally change a number between 0 and 255 (or between a
minimum and maximum value).  The fractal value must change smoothly over
time.  This code is for an addition to Imagine, a 3D rendering program.  I
have programmed a waveform envelope generator/editor to control the
strength of a lightsource (hece the 0 - 255 value range).  I want to be
able to let the user press a button and every value following the first one
(that's the one the user initially sets) has some kind of fractal algorythm
applied to it.
 
The landscape generator is for a later project.  I basically need to create
a grid of values where, lets say, 0 represents flat terrain, 1 represents
low hills, 2 = medium hills, 3=high hills, -1 represents marshes, etc. 
What I need here is to fill an array of x by y with a value of 0, then
apply some kind of fractal operator on the array to build the hills,
valleys, lakes, etc.
 
Hope I've been a little less vague...I'm working on very little sleep these
last few days :^(

Well, as some of you may well know, I have not been around this mailing 
list for a looong time... I have about 800 messages backlogged and I'll 
never be able to read them.  

I have not been able to keep PLAYFIELD! going like it should.  I am 
looking for someone to help and I am willing to pay for each issue upon 
completion.  You can have almost complete creative freedom to do whatever 
you want, I just want to get them published.

Please contact me via email if you are interested.  Desktop Publishing 
experience is a must (not necessarily professionally, just know how to 
use Page Stream ;-)  8-12 pages (4 page groupings only)  I have enough 
material to print a few issues with.

Please only serious enquiries.

Nick,

I haven't had any experiance myself with random map generators, but it
sounds like your best bet would be to look into Fractal algorithms for
yor main terrain, and just choose certian random spots on the map to generate
special features or special terrains (using the fractal engine).

You might want to get ahold of the Map Maker program that someone posted
abot a while back, the one that creates a random landscape and makes it
bigger by averaging the middle pixels.

  Yes, the unregistered version doesn't close screens and windows.  (For those
who didn't know, that's the "crippling" in the demo version.)  It shouldn't
crash on exit, though...  What OS do you have?

OS2.1 ECS

It doesn't crash on exit, so much as when I try to flip away from that screen.
I figure its because intuition is looking for the prg that belongs to that
screen and can't find it.

Also, if I open a window (on my screen, not on wb) it opens, then garbles and
then my computer locks up.

Hey Andy (Church),
                  Is the following a bug or is it supposed to happen?

I wrote a test program using the demo intuition extension.  Obviously, I can't
close a screen after the program ends, but, after compiling my test program,
the screen to back gadget causes instant guru.

Code is as follows:

Amos To Back
Iscreen Open 1,640,200,2,Hires,"Demo"
Icls : Ilocate0,1
Iink 1
Iwrite
Icentre "Hello. Welcome to the test."
Iwrite : Iwrite
Icentre "Enter something to end the demo."
A$=""
1 A$=Iread Char$
If A$="" Then Goto 1
Iwrite A$
If A$=Chr$(13) Then Goto 2
Goto 1
2 Icls
Amos To Front
End

Also, when I used Iread Str$, it gave me no input, but if I ran the program
again, whatever I typed from the last run appeared.

Is the guru because the screen remains open but the program for it is gone?

Any ideas about the Iread Str$ problem?

Well met and godspeed,
                      Giark

  I have exactly the same system as you do, and did not experience any of the
above problems.  Your test program worked fine for me.  Unless anyone else has
experienced similar problems (has anyone?  Please let me know), I can try
resending the archive and see if that helps.

  On the subject of crashing after quitting, I admit that I do not know what
the effects of my crippling will be on any system; what I had to do may not
agree with the system, in which case I'm sorry for any trouble it's caused,
but I had to take extreme measures to ensure that the crippling could not be
worked around by software pirates.

	I don't think the hotspot matters much in collision detection.  If the
graphics actually overlap there will be a collision.  If they don't look like
they are touching, there will be no collision.

GREGORY,

I don't think the hotspot determines the collision: I think it is just the part
of the bob that is positioned according to the coordinates you determine. AMOS
detects collision when the bobs/sprites outlines hit, but if you want to make
sure the outlines you want as the outlines of the bob are those that trigger a
collision then you set the background colour of your bob as transparent using
Make Mask.

One thing i would like to know: I see there is an example of a breakout game in
the AMOS Pro help files, but the blocks are all represented by bobs. I think
this is a cheat, as an attempt to program a proper breakout game using bobs
only would probably exceed the maximum number of bobs.

I thought it might be possible to do this using Paste Bob to set up a screen,
but how could one program a collision detection system that would make the ball
bounce off the outline of each block, and then allow one to delete it and
replace it with a background icon?

I know breakout is the oldest game there is, but I am only programming for fun,
and as an educational experience.

Thanks,

Jonathan

For breakout, try the GetPoint or whatever to test the colorof the area
next to the ball. Then make it so each cube has a border the same color
as the background screen. Floodfill the cube that was hit with the
background color, and it disapears! Then invert the velocity of the ball.
When checking the color, different colors could do different things, and
other special data could be kept in a 2d array, corresponding to the width
and height of the cubes, ie array[2][5] with 16 by 8 pixel cubes would be
at screen location (2*16)+0 to 16, (5*8)+0 to 8.  only check about 8 areas
around the ball with getpoint, as it will slow the game down! Or, if you
are using the Turbo ext, use the fast zones.

It is not on there as it is not PD yet.  It only came with the compiler.

                I have written a few things in AMOS, a couple of games and one

Aminet. Try your local site for the following :

They are : mimic.lha - games/misc
           codefinder.lha - games/think
         & bootcontroller1.0 and version 1.2 - disk/misc

        Have a look and tell me what you think.

        See ya.

I've noticed a slight bug with the easylife structured variables system -
all real numbers get converted to integers by the AMOS tokeniser, which
means that they don't work. The upshot of this is that if you declare
structured variable elements of type 'real', you will not be able to set
the values correctly. I am working on fixing it.

You would use Paste Bob, and store all the blocks in an array, checking
each position in the array as the ball passes over it.

Amos doesn't compare hotspots to determine if two bobs have collided...
Only if the images of two bobs overlap does a collision happen.

Hi!

Now, is there a way to set a hotspot for icons? I know there isn't
a command to do that, but by tricking amos somehow it maybe could be 
possible.

In the Icon bank structure there actually is a field (that is two words)
for hotspots. I tried to change these but nothing happened...

PS: What about adding a Set Icon Hotspot instruction to Turbo extension ?

Maximum bobs depends upon available memory and your Amos configuration.

A fellow user has told me of your AMOS PRO extensions to allow access to
Intuition et al.  I would appreciate if you could give me some details

Assuming of course, that we're all agreeable :) ...

I`ve just been reading the latest Amiga Format (with AMOS Pro
on the cover) and I see an advert for IntOS, an AMOS extension
to provide Intuition support.

Question:

Is this in any way related to Andy Church and his extension?

And can anyone help me - my HD crashed, and when I tried to re-install 
AMOS Pro I get an error telling me it can't find the configuration 
files.  I tried booting from the install disk and running the install 
program from WB, and neither one works.  I copied the 
AP_System_Master:ExtraConfigs/AMOSPro_Configuration.backup to 
AP_System_Master:APSystem/AMOSPro_Configuration but that didn't help, so 
can anyone send me a copy of the config. file?

Thanks...

  It's been rather quiet recently, but yes, it is.

  If AMOS Pro itself is refusing to load, it sounds like your
AMOSPro_Interpreter_Config is messed up.  The file you need to fix is
S:AMOSPro_Interpreter_Config (or S/AMOSPro_Interpreter_Config if you didn't
boot from the disk you're fixing).

I too did not receive anything for a couple of weeks. I stopped receiving around 26th 
November. Perhaps you have somehow been unsubscribed mysteriously like me.
I emailed Michael Cox and he couldn't understand why I was no longer subscribed and 
he re-subscribed me!

Just to remind everyone that if mail sent to you ever gets bounced back for
a reason such as Host Unknown (Authorative answer) or User Unknown, you
become unsubscribed.  This prevents a multitude of bounced messages.

Now, can someone post details about the AMOS Pro coverdisk?  Like, what
else comes with it, do they sell the manual, do they mention Europress's
abandonment of AMOS, etc?

Also, unrelated to AMOS, has anyone (mainly UK-based people) bought/used
one of those workstation stands for the A1200?  I don't have the magazine
in front of me, but it is like a stand to place over the A1200 so you can
put your monitor, external stuff, etc. ontop to save room on your desk.
Does anyone know what I am talking about?  I want to build one myself or
buy a cheap one.  I have a mode, external HD, ext floppy, and, soon, a
Zappo, and things are already cluttered on my desk.  I understand that it
does not have extensions for the joystick ports to place them on the side?
If I built one, I could probably do that.  Any info would be appreciated!

Subject: Screen rastport of AMOS screens?
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII
Content-Length: 468
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Hello everybody!

I am currently replacing some AMOS procedures
by Assembler programs. As my AMOS routine contains
a Plot command I intend to use the WritePixel
routine from the graphics.library.
The problem is that I have to know the screen
rastport of the current in AMOS before calling
my Assembler routine (to which I can pass it
with Areg(1)=rastport). Can I use the "Screen base"
command? What offset do I need?

All help is welcome!

Thanks in advance,

	Chris

  Ain't none such.  AMOS uses its own screen routines and hence its own
structure.  I suppose it would be theoretically possible to create a
RastPort for an AMOS screen, but I've never tried and don't want to.  I
prefer just using the Intuition Extension. :-)

They may still sell it, but they are not going to fix it.

	Why not make a plot entirely of your own?  I don't know assembly so
I'll use BASIC.AMOS-Like statements to describe this:
(ScreenAddress=Phybase(0))
Addr=ScreenAddress+X/8,Y*(Screen Width / 8)
Poke Addr,Peek(Addr) Or 2^(X mod 8)

	This isn't all of course, but maybe the most important part.  There's
still important parts to figure out for color (you have to do this for every
plane of which the color is a member and use "And Not" instead of "Or" for
every plany of which the color is not a member).  I'm not sure whether that
2^(X mod 8) is right or if it should be 2^(7-X mod 8).  Also, I'm sure in
assember that many efficiencies can be added... you don't want to use 2^, 
rather some other method of setting bit number [X mod 8].  
	Why are you re-writing plot.  There are free versions of the Turbo
Plus extension that have a fast F Plot command.  (Oops, the first period should
of coursse be a "?".)

Hi,
I missed the October (issue 42) of amiga shopper here in Australia. I
suppose it was more important for our newsagents to have the latest issue
of "drenching cattle for fun and profit" rather than a computer (new
fangled machine) book :-)

Did anyone on the list get that issue, and if they did, could they send me
the amos programs that were in that issue. I believe that it was supposed
to be about texture mapping and shadding.

Since that discussion on Marp a while back, I've started going through the
ROM Kernal routines. I believe that Amos uses the copper to open it's own
screen using viewport.

Also on the Marp subject, most of the screen functions in Amos come
straight from Rom Kernals. ie, Dual Playfield, double buffer, serial comms,
parrallel comms, a lot of stuff.

Now time for a question: Has any one used the hardcol() collision function
in AMOS? If not, could someone try, as I can't get it to work.

I wonder if this extension has been dis-continued as we haven't seen any
updates, news about any developements on the TurboPlus Extension. Last 
update was 2.0 and it wasn't even a major update. Still missing CText 
type commands and the long awaited Scene Animation, Multi-Tasking LOAD 
command ect...

I for one would really like to see an extension for AMOSPro that allows 
better use of the serial device such as LSerial was for AMOS "The

    Amos do not open intuition screens.It uses viewports, view,

and windows(layers).I'm going to work on it (give me some time!), but 
the best solution would be accessing AMOS data zone and somehow find 
out rastport's stucture address.

Recently there have been some mailings about the TURBO(+) Extension.
I have used it once to speed up my line-drawing with the function F 
Draw. Everything worked fine until I compiled the program. The 
compiled program works, unless you have the insane desire to quit the 
program. Guess what, it crashes, GURU's, commits suicide etc. 
Just a warning if you want to use this extension.

I would like to have some information on this too please before I 
buy the issue. What I would like to know is will the AmosPro 
coverdisk work on my A1200 w. 2/4 meg chip/fast. The reason I am 
asking this is because the last few months Amiga Format has put a 
lot of bugged software on their disks, to the extent that I could 
not use any of the programmes of the November issue (and I really 
could use PixelPro).
Now I know that AmosPro has a lot of bugs (which version, BTW?), I 
only need to know if it will run at all on my 1200. I only buy the 
British magazines for their coverdisks, as their contents usually 
are below any par you can think of. You can see that bug-ridden 
coverdisks are a waste of money for me.

Just rummaging thru my back copies it seems that the Amos section in
October's AS was not about texture mapping/shading, but was about
musinc & samples. The listing were as follows;

1. Changing the pitch of a sample whilst it's playing.
2. Accessign MIDI from Amos.

If you want these I can type them in and mail them.

BTW, I think Simon Green was being sarcastic when he said the October
ish would concern VR, gouraud shading and anit-aliased texture mapping.

Hi everybody!

Thanks to the replies to my original posting.
Some people missunderstood me: I am not writing
a new extension or something, I'm just
translating a time consuming routine into
assembler code. As the AMOS routine contained
a Plot command, I wanted to use the equivalent
command from the Gfx library which needs the
RastPort of the screen.

Well, it may be true that AMOS does not use
Intuition screens, but they have a RastPort.
I know because I found out myself last night.

Register a5 seems to be pointing permanently
to an internal AMOS structure. The RastPort
of the actual screen is in Leek(Areg(5)-6346)
and the GfxBase is in Leek(Areg(5)-6318).

I have tried it out with this simple
assembler program (I hope it's correct because
I haven't got it here right now):

move.l (a3)+,d1  ; Get y coord
move.l (a3)+,d0  ; Get x coord
move.l -6346(a5),a1 ; Get RastPort
move.l -6318(a5),a6  ; Get GfxBase
jsr WritePixel(a6) ; Call WritePixel of graphics.library
rts

Once assembled this program can be loaded
in a bank and called with

Call 15,x,y

It plots a point on the actual screen at (x,y).

Note that:
- The graphics.library seems to be permanently open in AMOS
  (No need to open it)
- The parameters x and y are put on a "stack" to which a3
  points at when you use the Call command. (See AMOS manual)
- This program corresponds more or less to the "F Plot"
  command of the Turbo extension. It's quite a lot faster
  than the original AMOS Plot command. (I'm not sure if
  it is faster when used this way, though, as the AMOS
  "Call" command may need a lot of overhead (saving
  the actual registers and other stuff?). I haven't looked
  at it.


Greetings,

	Chris

I read in my AMOSPro manual that Htan, and similar mathematical 
functions, are used in eg racing games. I experimented with the function, 
but it seems my brains are not sufficient to understand the functions. 
Anyone who could explain me how they work. (You can suppose I'm familiar 
with sin and cos, coz I am :)

Thanks in advance,

Do you know how one would go about re-directing output of say a ReqTools
type requester to pop up on an AMOS Screen instead of the Workbench 
Screen ?

I have been wanting to use the ReqTools 2.2c type requesters using ARexx 
as well, but can't get the requesters to pop up on say an AMOS screen 
that I have created using the Screen Open command. Any idea's, 
suggestions, or knowledge what-so-ever would be great !!

Thanx

This is the structure described in the equ.s
file that comes with AMOS. The labels in this file
are positive offsets from A5, and those in wequ.s
are negative offsets from A5.

I think these are labeled T_Rastport and T_Gfxbase.
However, some gfx library calls may not work correctly
on the AMOS screens,and intuition library calls definitly
won't. Note that T_Rastport gives you the rastport of the
current screen, so if you have several open, be careful.

Small point - you should make sure that you preserve the
values of registers A4-A6 during your assembler routines,
and only change A3 to remove paremeters from the stack.

It is, along with dos, maths, diskfont, layers and exec. Look
in wequ.s for the T_????base labels.

Flint,

I'm not sure what HTan does, but I can tell you this:

Never ever ever use Floating Point (eg. Sin/Cos/HTan) in any program that you
want to be FAST.  For any type of arcade game you should always create integer
tables for the Sin/Cos/Whatever functs you need, and simulate floating point
by just dividing by 1,000 or something when you need the integer number.
FYI.  ;)

Help.

Amos is screweing me out of memory.  I've got a huge program, 340 k of source
at 7,400 lines.  Whenever I add a few lines of code, usualy using a few If/else/
endif blocks or a few while wends, I get an Out Of Buffer Space error when I
test the program, and I have to add to the Set Buffer command.  But NOW my set
buffer command is at 70 k!!!  When I put a Print Free in the middle of my
program, it says there's almost 50 k of UNUSED buffer!!!  What's wrong with
Amos here?  Why does it think I need more buffer than I do??
(And no, I don't use HUGe strings, and no, the Print Free was AFTER all the
big Arrays are dimensioned.)

I don't think that's entirely true, cuz I have used a CLI command that 
does some requester type thing and when it prompt's up a requester it will
come up on an AMOS screen. 

I have figured out how now to plot, draw lines, circles, bars, boxes 
ect.. using the graphics.library directly onto any AMOS screen (0-7) that I
want ... now with the help of using a formula to give me the current 
Rasterport address of any of the AMOS screens (0-7). I'm not sure how 
much faster this is since I haven't time tested it, but it does work :)

AMOS works with two buffers:

	- The first one is used for variables, like arrays and so on. If you
	  run the program and AMOS answers you "Out of variable space" you
	  must increase this buffer with the command "Set Buffer" in your
	  first line of the code.

	- The second one is used for the program itself as text. If you have a
	  huge program and you can't add more lines, you must increase the Text
	  Buffer size. You can do this with a special menu option (called "Set
	  Text Buffer"). If you usually work with huge programs I recommend you
	  to increase this buffer in your configuration. This is the buffer that
	  you have to increase.

I hope this helps

Does amos support booleans ?

I need an array of 19 x 29 x 3 Booleans..

I know I can stuff the three bits in one integer...
But then I must check with 'AND's.. which is slow.
And add them with 'OR's..

How can I tell AMOS to use Booleans ? (Or bytes for that matter)

  True - Intuition's AutoRequest() requesters (the kind you get for "Insert
volume xxx", etc.)  But any other requester system (e.g. ReqTools) won't do
it.

To init garbage collection you could give a command like:

x=Free

Amos will/should/may do garbage collection then.

	Or use the Btst function.  You can test specific bits of an integer
and it's probably implemented with an identical machine language instruction
so it is probably pretty fast.

Ok folks, maybe I should have stated it, but I'm not an idiot.  :)

The problem with Set Buffer I was having was that all the time when TESTING
the program I'd get Out Of Variable Space messages, and I'd have to increase
the Set Buffer command for the program to run.  But when I did a Print Free
(to print the available Variable Buffer) in the program I had nearly 50 k of
unused Variable Buffer.

I called Aaron Fothergill, he was the only one who could help me.  Amos uses
the Variable Buffer to store and compute the Names of Labels and Variables,
so it needs an extremely huge Set Buffer to let it TEST out OK.  BUT, Amos
does NOT need all that extra Var Buffer when COMPILING.  The answer is to
make a copy of the Amos Program Source, BLoad it in, and fiddle the Value
after the Set Buffer TOKEN down a ways, then BSave that out and compile.

Yes you can.

And if you want really use boolean variables take EasyLife extension and 
learn how to use the structured variables.

When I compile a program which has icons in memory, it works fine when 
compiling it to Amos window, but when I compile it working in cli and 
then try to run this program from cli a guru will appear.
Has anyone else found this same problem??
And is there any way to solve this problem?

Just a quick question here.

I want to be able to use the RND() function to create random numbers, yet
have those "random" numbers the same under certain circumstances.  See, I
want the user to be able to specify a "seed" number, so that inputting the
same "seed" will provide the same results.  Should I use RANDOMIZE SEED??? 
Thanks!

  No - that won't work (although it's supposed to - bug #153).  You'll have
to use this random number routine:

Procedure RAND[_MAX]
   HI=SEED/127773
   LO=SEED mod 127773
   TEST=16807*LO-2836*HI
   If TEST>=0
      SEED=TEST
   Else
      SEED=TEST+2147483647
   End If
   R#=SEED/2147483647.0
   R=R#*_MAX
End Proc[R]

  I sent it to you twice!  Is it getting lost on the way?  OK, I'll send

Darryl,

Yes, you can use Arrays for the Sin/Cos etc tables.  You can also use a Bank
and Peek/Deek it, then you can build the bank before and just load it in,
so there's no delay at the start of your program to compute the tables.

Subject: Reading IFF Pixels
Status: RO
X-Status: 

For my particle engine, I'd like to add the ability for a user to load a
2-colour IFF of any size.  Then, the program would randomly (or
not-so-randomly) set the particle positions where the pixels of the IFF are
not set to colour 0 (Black).

1) Can I do it?
2) Can I get from a file the resolution of an IFF, colour depth, etc.
3) How do I read the IFF into the computer if the resolution is greater
than the displayable screen (one pixel at a time)?

Thanks for lending me your neurons!

1. Yes
2. Yes, but I couldn't tell you how off the top O my head, it is contained in
the IFF header chunk at the start of the file. Load an IFFwith a text editor
and take a look.
3. You could calculate the size of the picture by multiplying the width,
height and depth, then open a screen with those dimensions, AMOS
allows you to open a screen larger than the displayable area. You can
then use Screen Offset to position yourself on the screen, or just use Read
pIxel or whatever.

Hope it helps a smidgeon.  -Jedon

  Yes, yes, and not easily; but there's a simple way to do it that doesn't
require knowing the IFF format.  Load the picture like this:

Auto View Off : Rem So the user doesn't see the picture
Load Iff PICTURE_FILE$,7 : Rem Load the picture into screen 7
Screen Hide 7 : Rem So the screen doesn't show up later
Auto View On: Rem Restore normal screen operation

  Now you have an invisible screen with the picture on it.  You can use the
Screen Width, Screen Height etc. commands to find out the screen geometry,
and open another screen with the same values.  Then all you have to do is

Screen 7 : P=Point(X,Y) : Screen 0 : Plot X,Y,P

  Admittedly, this is not fast, but it's about all you're going to get out
of AMOS.

  All of them?  I wish!  No, all I mean is that there are a lot of bugs -
more than any reasonably-well-written program should have.  (I can't wait
to hear the agonized screams of Klik'n'Play users when their machines start
crashing. :-) )

>If so, could you send me a copy, so I can try to avoid them when I program.

  Most of the bugs are not program-related (meaning that they won't affect
whether or not your program works correctly), but of those that are, here's
a summary: (all of these are for AMOS Pro)

- Don't include Sprite or Icon banks in a compiled program, or the program
  will probably crash.  Load the banks at runtime instead.

- Don't use the same bank (at different times) for both MED modules and
  samples.

- If you need a looping music module, use MED format - the Tracker player
  does not loop correctly.

- Don't divide by negative numbers, because AMOS gives inconsistent results
  (in terms of rounding).

- Bobs and Icons can't be displayed with a Y coordinate greater than 512.
  (This appears to be a hardware limitation rather than an AMOS bug.)

Thanks for posting that quick list of bugs, I was wondering why division 
only worked properly sometimes. (Really played hell with the hydraulics 
calculation program I was trying to write, so I gave up and am writing it 
in HS Pascal instead). 

Boy, that's something I would have looked forward to seeing in my 
PlayField! newsletter, that is if I had gotten more than 1 issue out of 
my subscription.  

So Ryan (Scott) what's the deal? Are you going to honor our

Hi there all..


Do any of you remember EME?? (Enhanced Music Extension)

Well, after 4 months of delays, version 5.0 is finally ready for
betatesting.  It should then be ready for release!

What does it feature?  Well besides all the other bits, it also now has:

 - TFMX Playroutines (still bugfixing this one).
 - BitEvent system - for triggering samples/etc.
 - Wave banks - easy storage.
 - Samples can be played over tracker music etc. (was that in 4.64??)

and the BIG ones:

 - Audio channels are ALLOCATED by Amos (thanks to Andy Church)
 - CIA Tempo's can finally be used in Protracker Modules!!!!
 
 
Anyway, for more info: http://www.clare.tased.edu.au/~preece/eme.html

OR

email me.. (to preece@clare.tased.edu.au please - the other system is
down until I go back to work to fix it!)



Regards,

Paul Reece.
