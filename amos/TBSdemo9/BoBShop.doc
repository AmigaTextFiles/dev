Introduction
    The Bob Shop is a Sprite/Bob editor written in Amos Pro
V:2.0. It is a paint program designed around the creation of
sprites/bobs for use in games and animations with an emphasis on
creating animated sequences (this will become more apparent as the
program matures).I have tried to include a good basic set of tools for
this initial release. Future releases will include a more extensive
set of tools as well as enhancements to the current set. If you are
familiar with any Amiga paint program you should find many of The Bob
Shop's methods quite familiar. Bob creation is vert straight forward
but if you intend to work with sprites please read the section in your
Amos manual on this topic to be certain you understand their
limitations and restrictions. One feature that may seem unusual is the
way the sprite/bob bank is handled. The easiest way to think of it as
a storage device. The image you draw on the screen is not placed into
the bank until you do so manually with the Store in Bank  command. If 
you try to proceed without saving your changes you will be prompted to
avoid accidental loss of data. Currently The BoB Shop is capable of
loading and saving Amos Sprite/Bob banks only. Future versions may
include the capability to save in C or Assembly source. 
This manual has been laid out so that the gadget descriptions  follow
the gadget placement on the screen in a left to right top to bottom
fashion grouped by function (ie all tools together). 
The left mouse button is referred to as LMB, the right mouse button as
RMB.The BoB Shop Interface.
The BoB Shop interface screen is divided into three regions. The
drawing area along the top the palette strip just below the drawing
area and the control panel at the bottom.
    
System Requirements
    Amiga 500,600,1200,2000,3000,4000
    Amiga Dos 1.3 or greater
    1 meg ram total minimum 512K chip
    1 floppy
    Amos, Amos Easy, Amos Pro 
     (accessory version compatible with  Amos Pro only.)


The Drawing Area.
    The drawing area consists of two rectangles the large
rectangle in the top left hand corner is the drawing area all drawing
is clipped to be contained inside of this rectangle. The small
rectangle in the lower right corner of the larger rectangle is the
sizing gadget for the drawing area. To resize the drawing area
position the cursor within the sizing gadget, press and hold the LMB.
The large rectangle will now expand and contract relative to the
cursor position. You will notice that the width of the drawing area
jumps by 16 pixels at a time. This is because the x coordinate must be
a multiple of 16. To use the new size release the mouse button. To
begin drawing select a tool from the control panel and follow the
instructions for that tool. 
  
The Palette Strip.
    The palette strip is the narrow band located between the
drawing area and the control panel. The blocks of colour represent the
colours available for drawing. The colour on the left hand side is
colour register zero, this is the colour that will be transparent if
you assign a mask to your sprites/bobs. The currently selected colour
or foreground colour is the block that is slightly larger than the
others and has a smaller block of a colour contained within it. The
colour in the centre is the background colour that is used in
conjunction with the foreground colour when using patterns. To change
the foreground colour position the cursor over the colour you wish to
use and click the LMB. To change the background colour click on the
colour you wish to use with the RMB.

The Control Panel.
    The control panel is where almost all of The BoB Shop's
functions are controlled. It is divided into four areas,the drawing
tools, bank manipulation tools, disk management and screen controls. 
The drawing tools are on the left hand side of the screen, along the
top centre  section is the info line, the mid centre contains all of
the screen manipulators, the lower centre takes care of image bank
manipulation and finally the left hand region has the disk I/O gadgets
and a scrolling pad.
The info line along the top centre contains information about the
currently selected sprite/bob in the format of "x:xsize y:ysize c: 
# colours bob#/total in bank".

Scroll Pad           Keyboard Shortcut cursor keys  
    Purpose:
            Screen scrolling.
    Method:
            This gadget serves a dual purpose depending on which mode
        you are in. If zoom mode is active then the arrow buttons scroll the
        zoom window in the direction of the arrow. Just click on the desired
        direction with the LMB. The button in the centre of the arrow keys
        toggles between 2x magnification and 4x magnification. In normal mode
        the arrow buttons scroll the current image in the drawing area. This
        is used to keep your sprite/bob bank as small as possible by having
        each sprite as small as possible. Simply scroll the image as far as
        possible in to the upper left hand corner of the drawing area and
        resize the drawing box to be as small as possible.

        type in the name of your file. The standard file extension for 
        a sprite/bob bank is ".ABK" this is not absolutely necessary  
        but it will make things easier to keep straight.


Page Flipping
    Page flipping is a tool used in the creation of animated
        sequences. It simulates the way that an animator using the traditional
        method of paper and pencil would flip pages with his fingers to
        preview his work. The 10 function keys along the top of the keyboard
        represent the animation frames relative to the currently displayed
        image. F6 corresponds to the image stored in the bank at the current
        position. F7 to F10 correspond the current image+1 to current image+4.
        F5 to F2 represent the current image-1 to the current image-4. F1 is
        user definable and can be set to display any image in the bank
        regardless of the current position. To set the F1 key goto the desired
        image in the bank and press CTRL+F1.
        All drawing function support page flipping. While you are drawing  you
        may use the function keys to flip to any other image as           
        defined above. The new image will be displayed on the screen for     
        a few seconds and the current image will then be returned to the
        screen. This can be done while you are in the middle of a drawing     
        operation (ie positioning a curve) so that you can relate one         
        frame to a previous one.

The Future OF The BoB Shop.

Some of the enhancements I have planned are sprite/bob rotation,
multicoloured fill patterns, complete support for custom brushes with
all drawing tools, cutting sprites/bobs from iff files and an improved
and expanded manual.
Much of what you can expect from The BoB Shop depends on your feed
back. I look forward to hearing from you with your suggestions
comments and complaints. I can be reached by at
