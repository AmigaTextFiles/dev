   While I'm "here":  MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYBODY!!!!  Hope you <BR>
                             all are having a wonderful holiday.<BR>
<BR>

   I sent you the Final SideShooter Stage last night and it has just<BR>
   bounced back to me.  The follow-up message I sent after the<BR>
   the stage-submittal has also bounced back to me...<BR>
<BR>
   I sent the archive to: giark@hicksville.dyn.ml.org<BR>
<BR>
   Are you using a new e-mail address?<BR>
<BR>
   I have a couple of small modifications I want to make, so it's <BR>
   probably good that you didn't receive the source I sent last night...<BR>
  <BR>
   Anyway, I'll make these modifications and wait a few hours for my <BR>
   message to relay back to you from the AMOS-list.  If I don't hear<BR>
   anything (new e-mail address?) by 11pm (it's 5pm now) I'll send the<BR>
   final stage archive again and "hope for the best"...<BR>
  <BR>
<BR>
      Take  care,   <BR>
      GARFIELD<BR>
