Okers, I have sent my final hi-score program to giark to be sent to the<BR>
homepages. I havent sent him the source code just yet, as im gonna hold<BR>
onto it till monday night to make sure there are no bugs in it (plus I need<BR>
to document it for him, hehe).<BR>
<BR>
OK, some things you should know. Firstly, it creates a random "score" to<BR>
decide wether to enter you into the table. There is a section to say you<BR>
didnt make it, and also, the bit that you did, derrr. I have used a SID<BR>
file, as with all these THX problems with the extension, its actually more<BR>
memory economic to use a true SID file than a THX (IMHO), and it has 2<BR>
tunes, one for when you get in, one for when you dont. The tune BTW is by<BR>
Maniacs of Noise, Cybernoid 2.<BR>
<BR>
The system can be controlled by either the joystick, or the keyboard.<BR>
Keyboard keys are O, P and Space, or ENTER on menu's where prompted. Slide<BR>
the scroller to the left/right to pick letters, fire/space to select them.<BR>
The square character is the space character, <- is delete, and arrow down<BR>
is exit.<BR>
<BR>
I already know about the mouse pointer being there, so thats one error you<BR>
need not report, hehe. I have tested it in bits, but not fully, so please<BR>
exploit it to its limits!<BR>
<BR>
CBATNAM coders, If I forgot to put your name in the default scores, gimme <BR>
a shout!<BR>
<BR>
When the scores are being drawn on the screen (a seperate procedure, for<BR>
use within the main title screens for displaying the scores) press either<BR>
fire/enter to exit the routine.<BR>
<BR>
Included in the archive is playsid.library for all those who haven't got it.<BR>
