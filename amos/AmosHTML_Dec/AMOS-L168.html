It was on the night of 21-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Pietro jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop<BR>
shouting about "Re: Needs GUI" until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>
<BR>
-> >I finally got the gadtoolsbox to vork :) (Thanks Giark & Troy E. Bouchard)<BR>
-> >So now i need to know where to get the latest version of the GUI<BR>
extension.<BR>
<BR>
-> The latest public version is always available on aminet. dev/amos<BR>
directory.<BR>
-> The latest version is the 1.62<BR>
<BR>
I already mailed V1.62 of the extension to him ages ago, when this thread<BR>
first started!!<BR>
