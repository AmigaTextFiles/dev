I am having a small problem with my Fleshee 2000 map editor saving aspect.<BR>
I have no screwed around with the code for it to work from reserved work<BR>
banks and saves fine when I use the 'Save' command.<BR>
<BR>
The only problem is that when I use the 'Save' command it also includes my<BR>
icon file (obviously), which is small but an annoyance nonetheless. But I am also<BR>
having problems with 'BSave', because between banks 10 and 11 there is a<BR>
large gap of space that AMOS itself uses. So when I attempt to save from<BR>
the beginning of bank 10 to the end of bank whatever it includes ALL that<BR>
data, which sums up to over 300K.<BR>
<BR>
How do I get around this?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now, on other things.....<BR>
As I have mentioned on my web page I need people to help me make good<BR>
maps. So I am wondering if anyone wants to help and is not involved with<BR>
CBATNAM ;). What I can offer you is the full version of the game when it is<BR>
completed (if it ever get completed...).<BR>
<BR>
If you are interested EMail me... I will fill you in on any details (if<BR>
they exist?!?).<BR>
