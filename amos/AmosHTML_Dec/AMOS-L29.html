Aaaaarrrrggghhh!!!<BR>
<BR>
Ahem, just in case you were wondering, im still being so inundated with <BR>
requests for Extreme AMOS, that I am now officially back on the job!<BR>
<BR>
Issue 4 was almost finished enginewise, and the reason it was stalled <BR>
was because noone had sent a single article, just congrats on the third <BR>
one, which literally stormed me with greets etc.<BR>
<BR>
Im making a public plea, PLEASE SUBMIT ARTICLES/PICS/TEXTS of ANY KIND <BR>
which you would like to see included. Once the Bubba project is shuffled <BR>
to the side, i'll be working full time on issue 4. I hope to make it a <BR>
monster 3-4 disk monster issue this time!!<BR>
<BR>
If you are not familiar with the workings of Extreme AMOS, it was a disk<BR>
magazine I originally worked on with another fellow, who later left after a<BR>
mild controversy. Anyhow, I put together a large, tutorial packed issue<BR>
(the third) which turned out to be the most popular release of the magazine<BR>
to date, with over 300 copies mailed out personally, and countless<BR>
downloads from my AMOS homepages. I also received hundreds of mails telling<BR>
me what a great magazine it was, and how it helped people solve particular<BR>
AMOS problems, but unfortunately only received several small articles back,<BR>
and I wasnt prepared to spend another 7 months writing articles for an<BR>
entire issue again!!<BR>
<BR>
Any questions whatsoever, I can be contacted at mushypd@redrose.net<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>
<BR>
