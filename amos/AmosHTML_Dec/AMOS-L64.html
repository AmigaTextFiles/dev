Hiya list members<BR>
<BR>
Me and a friend is making a skateboard-game.... I'm coding and he's <BR>
making the gfx. So what's the problem? Let me put it this way.<BR>
A simple equation will show it...<BR>
GROUP - THE CODER GUY - THE GFX GUY = THE MUSIC GUY..... Eh.. =)<BR>
So. What we need is a musician for making SID of THX modules. The ongs <BR>
should be happy. Reply me with a private email if you're interested.<BR>
<BR>
And I have another problem. On Andrew's Amos-homepage, I can't download <BR>
the Doom extension. All the other extensions works fine. Am I he only <BR>
guy in the world with this problem. Perhaps someone can mail me the <BR>
extension..<BR>
<BR>
So. That's all. Bye... /Ravon<BR>
<BR>
