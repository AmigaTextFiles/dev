Hm.. well, a manual or some docs (tutorials) would be helpful. Of course,<BR>
if you have any past experience (or know anyhow who does), this would too.<BR>

HECK YES! Do you HONESTLY THINK I would be coding a 3D Engine in AMOS if<BR>
*I* didn't think I it was do-able (possible)? AND do you think I would be<BR>
coding on CBATNAM if it couldn't be? Not much waste of thought there.<BR>
<BR>
As a matter of fact, Andy Gibson I believe it was (a fellow AMOSer and<BR>
Lister) coded an AWESOME 3D racing game of sorts with TONS of graphics and<BR>
sounds (which I haven't tried yet, hehe, but the screenshots were COOL!). I<BR>
don't have his URL right now, but if you'll wait (or he sees this message),<BR>
I'm sure one of us could get it to you. It's a must see.<BR>
<BR>
Anyhow, yes it can be done with some effort and time, and I'm sure<BR>
depending how much you want and what you want, it will be good.<BR>
