It was on the night of 28-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, skid jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting<BR>
about "amos web ring" until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>
-> Hello all..<BR>
-> Sorry to bug all of you with this..<BR>
-> It has come to my attention that there are tons of AMOS related web sites<BR>
-> out there, unfortunately I don't have the URLs to them. So I searched for<BR>
a<BR>
-> web ring containing AMOS pages and guess what I found? TORI AMOS!!! AAAAK!<BR>
-> So, I took it upon myself to creat the AMOS programming language web ring,<BR>
-> or "AMOS Ring" for short. :)<BR>
-> So.. since I KNOW most if not all of you have SOMETHING related to AMOS on<BR>
-> your sites.. <BR>
-> <readies for a beg...><BR>
-> PLEASE join the AMOS ring?<BR>
-> It'll benefit you <more hits>, me <more members>, and the world.. <seeing<BR>
-> AMOS users united!><BR>
-> Well.. that's all for now.. thanx for your time.<BR>
-> You may now flame me. :)<BR>
-> Oh yea... here's the URL:<BR>
-> http://www.radiks.net/skid/amos/<BR>
-> ...simple isn't it? :)<BR>
