<BR>
Hehe, I wrote this one last week.  Scan the file for VHDR, and then<BR>
add 20(ish) to it, and do a deek.  If you find it jibberish, do a -1.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Err, use an external proggie, there are loads.<BR>
<BR>
> 3) The file-format if an AIFF file ??<BR>
<BR>
No idea.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Try it, you'll be suprised.  <BR>
