It was on the night of 21-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Garfield jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop<BR>
shouting about "CBATNAMdemo..." until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>
->    CBATNAM Team,<BR>
<BR>
->    Just had another thought and since I plan on completing my stage<BR>
->    tomorrow, thought I'd consult with you guys now...<BR>
<BR>
->    How are we handling the demo-version of CBATNAM?  As in the<BR>
->    demo Mush sends out for CoverDisks and such.<BR>
<BR>
->    Obviously, we can't be giving out the full game, so I assume we (the<BR>
->    stage-programmers) are to be supporting a demo-version, correct?<BR>
<BR>
->    Just want to make sure this is what you want, although I don't see<BR>
->    how else we could do it as effectively...<BR>
<BR>
->    It's no problem, just give me another flag (DEMO) and if it's true<BR>
->    I'll limit the duration of the game-play to about 30 seconds of Phase<BR>
->    One (or maybe ten seconds each of Phases 1, 2 and 3)...<BR>
<BR>
->    I think this would be just enough to "bait" the player into purchasing<BR>
->    the full version.  We have five stages, so if we all gave a 30-second<BR>
->    preview then we'd have a solid two and one-half minute playable-<BR>
->    demo.  Actually, we could reserve the Bonus Stage for the<BR>
->    registered users (more incentive to order the full version), but I<BR>
->    have enough to think about, so you guys can sort that out... :-)<BR>
->   <BR>
<BR>
->    Anyway, just give me some feedback guys (Giark, Mush)... should<BR>
->    I go ahead and add this demo-mode support?<BR>
<BR>
->    If this has already been discussed then I apologize - I missed it...<BR>
<BR>
A flag which supports the demo mode will be fine, say, 15 secnds. Ill be<BR>
playing with the code a bit anyhow for the demo version, so i'll be cutting<BR>
unused bits out. Should also show a still of the boss, and some text about it<BR>
so the player gets to miss out n the fun, hehe!<BR>
