It was on the night of 18-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Robert jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop<BR>
shouting about "Extension users!!!" until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>
-> Does everyone here have extensions for their versions<BR>
-> of AMOS? I use AMOS THE CREATOR V1.34 and<BR>
-> the AMOS PRO COMPILER..<BR>
-> I have written over 14 games and never use any extensions,<BR>
-> am I the only weirdo, or are there others who don't use any<BR>
-> extensions?<BR>
<BR>
I used to try to not use extensions when I wrote games, for example, Twinz<BR>
never used any, but unfortunately, AMOS requires a lot of commands and<BR>
instructions which dont always work as well or as fast as a prticular<BR>
extension command. Take the GUI extension, for example...<BR>
