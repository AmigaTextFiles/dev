Why would you want to play a THX song next to a PT song?<BR>

THX reserves that for filters, it precalcs the filters instead of doing<BR>
that on the fly (which would use way too much cputime). It's probably<BR>
possible to not use this function if the song doesn't use filters (have to<BR>
consult this with the programmer) as older songs do not reserve this memory<BR>
as they don't use filters. Anyway, the memory can be given back if you're<BR>
not playing a song.<BR>
<BR>
I like THX so there. ;)<BR>
