It was on the night of 14-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Jens jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting<BR>
about "Re: GUI extension.." until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>
<BR>
-> >Any other questions, just ask!<BR>
<BR>
-> Isn't that what this list is for ??, or have I got something wrong :)..<BR>
<BR>
Nah, only a couple of us really know how to use the full power of the<BR>
extension, as we get the beta versions and have to test everything, hehe.<BR>
