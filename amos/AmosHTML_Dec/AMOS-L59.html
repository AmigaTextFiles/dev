Greetings.<BR>
 <BR>
> No good. The game is going to be finished this sunday. No exceptions.<BR>
<BR>
Well, I'm bustin my hump trying to get all done that I can, but, I'm <BR>
sorry, it will HAVE to be good enough. You can't do the game without <BR>
my level (and without the Taxman), and I say you'll have to wait a <BR>
bit longer (Garfield was behind a bit too, wasn't he?) :P<BR>
<BR>
I'm don't want to (or am) trying to slow the project down, but <BR>
there's just not been enough time to put everything I want into the <BR>
level AND get it finished on time.<BR>
<BR>
Btw, my ISPs been having some major problems lately, so anything I DO <BR>
send may get there a little late (unless they finish their upgrades <BR>
before the end of the week).<BR>
<BR>
Try and meet me on IRC sometime for a chat.<BR>

Before you criticize a man, walk a mile in his shoes.<BR>
That way, when you do criticize him, you'll be a mile<BR>
away and have his shoes. - Unknown<BR>
