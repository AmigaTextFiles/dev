Probably not. A problem I often find is if you're using amos and<BR>
switch to workbench and use something there that uses sounds (octamed,<BR>
multiview a sample etc) and then flip back to amos the sound has gone<BR>
mental. This is because (among other things) amos not reserving the<BR>
sound channels (as octamed does) essentially this prevents others<BR>
progs interfering with the sound. One solution is to quit amos and<BR>
start again and don't run other stuff. Another is get the AMCAF<BR>
extension (Hi Chris!!) which has better sound support and can put a<BR>
lock on the Audio so external interference should no occur. Happy<BR>
sampling! <BR>
