<BR>
If you look at the AMOS manual on how the banks are stored you can<BR>
actually peek the basic values out. But you'll only get the X size to<BR>
16 pixels.<BR>

<BR>
Actually, I find the screen copy routine quite reasonable. All the<BR>
other GFX things are bad though.<BR>
I find most extensions that are supposed to speed up GFX routines are<BR>
rubbish and its actually the other things that make the difference.<BR>
e.g. Using Qsqr from AMCAF has doubled the speed of one game that used<BR>
Sqr alot.<BR>

<BR>
It works as it says in the manual.<BR>
You cannot detect the mouse though. A solution would be to call Hide<BR>
On and then define your own mouse with a sprite and amal which you<BR>
could then detect.<BR>
