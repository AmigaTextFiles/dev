Greetings.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry Giark that I havent had a chance to get on IRC and have some <BR>
last minutes talk with you (for long enough, namely).<BR>
<BR>
Just an update on the stage: It's almost done. I'm implementing <BR>
objects now (which is giving me a little trouble, all of these <BR>
routines for sorting the objects, plus all of the variables involved, <BR>
I'm having to go through and debug my source).<BR>
<BR>
Anyhow, after that, I'll put in the routines for the Taxman (which <BR>
will include a "real-time cinematic sequence" when you come up <BR>
against him.) I also plan to implement support for enemies (just your <BR>
basic STAB, the Taxman's minions) and of course objects (said above), <BR>
ammo, health, and treasure. The banks will also be able to be <BR>
completely modifiable by Giark (only the textures and objects). I <BR>
also think I told some of you (programmers mainly) that I've updated <BR>
and added graphics (new status bar and textures, it all looks COOL!)<BR>
<BR>
Other than that, it should be the end of the week before I can have a <BR>
(demo?) for you guys to see (wont send source directly, as I want the <BR>
guys to see what I've got upto that point, then afterwards take the <BR>
next day to work out any extra bugs). Plus, EJ said it would be <BR>
"later this week" before he could have my music, so tada..<BR>
<BR>
Please be patient and stay tuned (you wont die, I assure you).<BR>
