The strange thing is, I never switched from AMOS to WB and ran anything<BR>
outside of the running prog. But I found out specifically that the MED I<BR>
was playing in my Intro was causing the problems.<BR>
<BR>
I'm now wondering would an AMOS Music Bank get around this, because my<BR>
simple text intro depends entirely on the music for that *evil* atmosphere,<BR>
especially when I fade the title in. If the music bank does get around it<BR>
how do I go about converting a med to a AMOS Music Bank?<BR>
<BR>
Also, does the Doom Music Extension handle MEDs better? I might consider<BR>
using that if it does (I've already gotten it of course).<BR>
<BR>
I'm not one for commercial extensions (hope ya don't mind Hodges), because<BR>
I prefer freeware. It seems to make more sense because I've already paid <BR>
for AMOS and the compiler. Besides, I'm trying to get a beta version of<BR>
Fleshee 2000 up on my page ASAP, so I don't feel like getting yet another<BR>
extension.<BR>
