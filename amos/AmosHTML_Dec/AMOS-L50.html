It was on the night of 08-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Mr. jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting<BR>
about "Re: Final Hi-score routine uploaded to giark" until I was forced to<BR>
knock them out:<BR>
<BR>
-> All the music used is by EJ and is in pt format. Don't make my life more<BR>
-> difficult, please.<BR>
<BR>
I explained to you on IRC ages ago, that until the mods are released as<BR>
protracker, i'll use a temp mod for inclusion in the meantimme. Nothing worse<BR>
than a silent-looking program, hehe.<BR>
