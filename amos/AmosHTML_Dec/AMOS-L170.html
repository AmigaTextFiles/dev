Greetings.<BR>
<BR>
Well, finally being on Christmas break (got a couple days extra in before<BR>
this week, Thurs. and Fri.!), I've been re-organizing and managing my mail<BR>
here on my (eek!) PC (over the weekend), moving everything over to (Bill's<BR>
newest toy) Outlook Express (new and pretty-cool mailer with IE 4.0).<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, I *inadvertantly* deleted my Storage folder (in Pegasus)<BR>
whilst transferring all my files, thus losing all the mail sent to the List<BR>
(by you guys), BUT, this is no problem as I can go fetch the archives of<BR>
past months off of the web (Aminet most likely). Also (hehe) please forgive<BR>
me if this message ends up funny. Having most of the options figured out<BR>
and configuration set, I'm still messing with the word wrapping, so, if<BR>
this message is sent crappy, DONT BLAME ME (entirely).<BR>
<BR>
Anyhow, that was Friday, and it's been going fine the past couple of days.<BR>
This having NOTHING (really much) to do with the point of my mailing, I am<BR>
meaning to say that, Giark and Mush: need to chat (namely about CBATNAM).<BR>
With the upcoming (soon) release and demo talks, I need to get in some chat<BR>
time with you guys (a good hour or so). SO, if you guys are available<BR>
anytime (mornings or evenings, noontime preferred) during the next two<BR>
weeks (until Januray 5th, preferrably this Christmas week), that would be<BR>
nice (I'm off, so I can be on almost anytime, day or night). Okers? Mail.<BR>
<BR>
Btw, to CBATNAM team: I will be sending an update (which I meant to send<BR>
last Monday but didn't get around to it, been working away) on the status<BR>
of the Dungeon level here in a couple of days.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks again for your time. Time to recluse again.<BR>
