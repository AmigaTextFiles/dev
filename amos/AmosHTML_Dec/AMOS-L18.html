   EHB, stands for Extra Half-Brite mode and the name comes from <BR>
   the design of the video-mode.<BR>
<BR>
   You can change colours 0-31, but colours 32-63 will be half as brite<BR>
   as colours 0-31.<BR>
<BR>
   Say you made colour 1 white with $FFF, the hardware would then <BR>
   make colour 33 grey with $777.<BR>
<BR>
   It's a neat mode really.  You have to put a bit more thought into<BR>
   palette-design, using the brightest colors for the first 32 registers, <BR>
   but you can get some nice shadows and such.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      Take  care,   <BR>
