Hello, Sample-trouble online :)<BR>
<BR>
I'm in a bunch of trouble with a sample-loader I'm trying to build into<BR>
a program. I want it to load several different formats.. BUT:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
1) How do I get the sample-rate of an IFF-8SVX file ??<BR>
<BR>
2) How do I convert a WAV (PC) sample to a raw one.. (Or just the file-<BR>
   format :)..<BR>
<BR>
3) The file-format if an AIFF file ??<BR>
<BR>
4) If I want to scale a 8-bit sample (to another rate), is it as simple<BR>
   as scaling GFX ??, is it just a matter of taking out, say every 3rd<BR>
   byte or is there some nasty trick that needs to be done ??<BR>
   (calc. average of two bytes to make it even better ??)<BR>
<BR>
I'm in trouble with some .au files, they're very noisy. I fact so noisy<BR>
that it's almost imposible to hear the sound. I've written about this<BR>
before and got some advice on '8/16 bit', 'flipping', 'signing' and the<BR>
'sample rate'.. I've tried several processing-programs but with no luck.<BR>
Is there any sample-expert who can solve it (I can send one of the<BR>
samples if someone would like to look at it..)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I hope to get something from this, as I need it very bad, Thanx...<BR>
<BR>

Happy greetings, Yours..<BR>
