Hmmm...   How about a demo variable, with 30 seconds or whatever plugged into<BR>
it, and we count it down to zero...  <BR>
<BR>
Of course, on the real version, demo=-1<BR>

Well, as per your idea, I will be implementing a timer in the demo variable<BR>
as above unless info to the contrary is received Giark.  Perhaps stick <BR>
"DEMO TIMER = 30" on the screen counting down.<BR>

It hasn't AFAIK.<BR>
