It was on the night of 07-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Jamie jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop<BR>
shouting about "THX SUCKS" until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>

-> virus, not a program!<BR>
<BR>
I hadnt tried that much with it, but I did notice it steals half a meg of<BR>
public memory before playing any mod!<BR>
