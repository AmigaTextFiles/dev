<BR>
Thats exactly what I meant.<BR>
I attempted to start writing a conversion program lst night but didn't get <BR>
very far.<BR>
I was trying to get it to just do REM statements initially but had trouble <BR>
splitting up the file into the bits I wanted.<BR>
<BR>
So far I have got a header of 20 chars (using AMOS Pro v2 - probably <BR>
different on other versions) and a trailer of 10(ish) chars.<BR>
<BR>
If I strip these bits of I am left with the main program in some encrypted <BR>
format.<BR>
Coding a small program...<BR>
<BR>
Rem a<BR>
Rem b<BR>
<BR>
...shows me that the HEX string for the REM statement.<BR>
Now if my program is just 1 line then I get approx 8 character back which <BR>
seem to map to the REM followed by some junk followed by the actual remark <BR>
(a).<BR>
With the program above I would expect just for the string to be repeated <BR>
with b replacing a and maybe a decimal 10 and 13 stuck inbetween - no such <BR>
luck though!<BR>
It seems that it just sticks what it likes in the file.<BR>
<BR>
At the rate I am going its not looking very promising - it would probably <BR>
take me a couple of years to find out the format.<BR>
<BR>
Do I recall correctly that the source for Amos is now PD?<BR>
If so, does anyone know where I could get it.<BR>
I think if I had the source then I could just pull out the LOAD, BLOCK ALL <BR>
and SAVE AS ASCII commands and stick them into an executable .<BR>
