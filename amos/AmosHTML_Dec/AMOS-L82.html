On Wednesday 10-Dec-97 at 15:46:52, a nutter named Ryan Watson<BR>
had wet pants when they typed about `Strange Sample Problem'.<BR>

You don't know what you're missing if you don't buy Amcaf! It's not as<BR>
if it costs an arm and a leg either :)<BR>
<BR>
We've  all  said  it  before,  Amcaf  is  a  MUST  if  you're  an Amos<BR>
programmer.  The  features  it  provides  are  great.  If peeps didn't<BR>
support  Chris by registering for Amcaf, we would never have been able<BR>
to use the great commands it provides.<BR>
<BR>
(and of course the future ones in the FREE updates to registered users<BR>
too).<BR>
<BR>
Have you even tried the free demo version of it? Go on....<BR>
<BR>
BTW What exactly is Fleshy 2000 then? Have I missed something?<BR>
<BR>
Tarra, Andy<BR>
