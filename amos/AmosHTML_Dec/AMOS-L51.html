It was on the night of 08-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Evert-Jan jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop<BR>
shouting about "Re: Final Hi-score routine uploaded to giark" until I was<BR>
forced to knock them out:<BR>
<BR>
-> And besides, they're far better then what MON have ever done. :)) Ofcourse,<BR>
-> if y'all want to use different musics I'll just throw my 28 Bubba tunes in<BR>
-> the bin and go home.<BR>
<BR>
MON were one of the best SID artists in the business, alongside them cool<BR>
brits Galway, Hubbard, Dunn, and all the rest.<BR>
<BR>
SID (IMHO) is much more c-64 like than THX could ever be, but ive heard a<BR>
couple of good THX sounds, so things could look up. I'll never prefer THX over<BR>
SID...<BR>
