Heh, you don't need to convince me about SID music, I have about 60mb of it<BR>
right on my HD and I listen everyday. Shows you what a life I've got. :)<BR>
<BR>
Galway's my favourite, his tunes are incredibly brilliant. Dunn was a<BR>
horribly underestimated musician, Hubbard was very good until he started to<BR>
use digitized sounds (with the exception of Skate or Die! and maybe BMX Kidz).<BR>
<BR>
I was ofcourse joking about my music being better than MON. I hope I will<BR>
come near to them some day in quality. <BR>

By me I hope :) But probably not ;))<BR>
<BR>
never prefer THX over<BR>
>SID...<BR>
<BR>
Have you heard some of my THX conversions of C64 music? They sound like the<BR>
real thing, at least, people still ask me what program I use to convert SID<BR>
files to THX. :)) (check out THX.HOME.ML.ORG for a lot of great tunes. And<BR>
a few by me :) Besides, ringmodulation is planned for the next THX release.<BR>
THX may be no sidmusic, but it's damn close.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I wish there was something like THX for the C64, as I'd really like<BR>
to compose on that machine and I can't really get into those C64 music<BR>
editors.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry to bore you like this but if someone mentions the words "Sid" or<BR>
"C64" there's no stopping me. :)<BR>
<BR>
There's a conversion of SidPlay going around, have you looked into that one?<BR>
