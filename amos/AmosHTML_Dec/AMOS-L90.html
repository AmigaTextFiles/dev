It was on the night of 11-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, --==MURRAY==-- jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt<BR>
stop shouting about "Re: Mushroom PD Report - December 1997" until I was<BR>
forced to knock them out:<BR>

Yup, glad you liked it! The command is still a bit unstable, but pietro<BR>
assures me he will be cleaning it up a little, and it should be in the next<BR>
release. Its just a simple command that copys the current AMOS screen, so its<BR>
a lot less hassle!<BR>
