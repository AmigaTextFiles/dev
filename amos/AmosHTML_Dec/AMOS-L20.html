Greetings.<BR>

Yes, change it from within AMOS if you want. (Palette$ command)<BR>
 <BR>

<BR>
The reason for this is in EHB (Extra Half Brite mode), the Amiga <BR>
takes its 32 color registers and SPLITS those colors (brightness) in <BR>
half (giving 32 more colors that are HALF as bright as the FIRST 32), <BR>
hence you have your 64 EHB color palette.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, when you change, say, color 16 as above, color 48 is going <BR>
to change as well (16+32=48). Any of the first 32 colors that are <BR>
modified will have a DIRECT effect on the last 32.<BR>
<BR>
> Anyone know a way around this ?<BR>
Depends on what you want to get around. :) As said, there's no way to <BR>
change the Half-bright colors (last 32). If you want, just get AGA.<BR>
