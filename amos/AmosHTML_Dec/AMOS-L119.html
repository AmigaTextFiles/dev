Sorry to bother everyone again but hopefully some of you may shed some<BR>
light on the problem here.  Recently I posted to the list about my not<BR>
being able to run AmosPro after my HD crashed but I still haven't been<BR>
able to get it to work.  Here are a couple of things:<BR>
<BR>
1. I'm loading no extra extensions (except whatever came on the default <BR>
   system disc)<BR>
2. I'm using a fresh copy of the original disc (Version 1.12)<BR>
3. To the best of my knowledge, there are no old configuration files or<BR>
   anything else lingering on the HD that might be conflicting with the<BR>
   new install<BR>
4. Someone suggested I run SnoopDos so here is the logfile when I tried<BR>
   to run AmosPro<BR>
<BR>
 C Process Nam Action    Target Name                   Options  Res.<BR>
 - ----------- ------    -----------                   -------  ----<BR>
 1 [7] amospro OpenLib   intuition.library             Ver 0    OK  <BR>
 2 [7] amospro Load      APSystem/amos.library                  OK  <BR>
 3 [7] amospro Open      s/AMOSPro_Interpreter_Config  Read     OK  <BR>
 4 [7] amospro FindTask  _Switcher AMOS_                        Fail<BR>
<BR>
What is this _Switcher AMOS_ task?<BR>
<BR>
Does anyone have a clue as to what might be causing the conflict here?<BR>
Thanks for the help.<BR>
<BR>
