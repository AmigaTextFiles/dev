It was on the night of 08-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Eric jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting<BR>
about "Re: AMOS Announcement: Extreme AMOS Back in production!!" until I was<BR>
forced to knock them out:<BR>
<BR>
-> Why not do a best of the AmosList section. You can pick out some of the<BR>
-> interesting things we've written about, and cleanly put the threads <BR>
-> together.<BR>
<BR>
-> Before I joined the list I read some of the Aminet AmosList archives, and<BR>
-> thought that it would be nice if someone would organize this mess.<BR>
<BR>
That was already planned, and in fact, I still have all the old texts I was<BR>
going to use from over a year ago!<BR>
