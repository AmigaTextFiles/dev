<BR>
   I don't like being a main part of the reason our project is delayed, so<BR>
   if it would help, I can send you the source and support files for the<BR>
   current version.<BR>
<BR>
   This way, you can start plugging them in and when I complete the<BR>
   remaining items on my work-list, I can just send you the new modules<BR>
   and relevant bits that have been changed...<BR>
<BR>
   What do you think?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
   BTW - here's another update:<BR>
<BR>
   2.  keyboard prefs have been implemented<BR>
   3.  stage-map has been minimized and converted to bytes. Result<BR>
        is binary map now consumes only 10,800 bytes compared to the<BR>
        previous 57,600 bytes.<BR>
   6.  the asteroid phase has been tweaked and is now a bit faster.<BR>
   7.  the midbossbattle phase has been tweaked and is now "clean".<BR>
   8.  I've added a slightly more interesting beginning to my stage.<BR>
<BR>
      As soon as I mail this, I'm going to work on the final module for<BR>
      the FB Battle destruction...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      Take  care,   <BR>
      GARFIELD<BR>
