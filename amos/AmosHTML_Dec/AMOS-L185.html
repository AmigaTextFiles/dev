Greetings.<BR>
<BR>
Well, even though just on time: Happy Holidays to all of the List (and many<BR>
pots of black coffee to those idiots making a Christmas Eve riot at their<BR>
local pub!) Merry Christmas (and all the loot that comes with it, hehe),<BR>
Happy Holidays and a good New Year. Remember the the Reason for the Season!<BR>
<BR>
Btw (a sidenote on CBATNAM), Mush: I'll be getting those screenshots to you<BR>
soon. Giark, Mush, and Keith (which I just talked to breifly): A chat<BR>
sometime during the next several days (through the Break).<BR>
