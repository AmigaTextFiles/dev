<BR>
   Well, I actually devoted four hours earlier today to working on the<BR>
   Final Boss phase.  Trying to find the right design as I want it to be<BR>
   interesting (at least a little).  Think I have it sorted now , so it's<BR>
   just a matter of implementing the remaining control-modules and<BR>
   Phase Four will be complete...<BR>
<BR>
   Of course, after I get that done I need to work on the remaining items<BR>
   on my work-list, most notably:<BR>
<BR>
   1. Adding a "[G]rab" option to allow Mush (or myself) to take a few<BR>
       snapshots of the display.  Won't take long to implement, just<BR>
       need to create a simple remapper to convert the Dual-Playfield<BR>
       display into one 16-color screen which can be saved out to disk.<BR>
<BR>
   2. Cleaning up.  This involves several tiny (although important)<BR>
       modifications.<BR>
<BR>
   I'll try to at least finish the FinalBoss Battle and add the "Grab"<BR>
   option tonight, but I'm afraid I will have missed the deadline as the<BR>
   clean-up won't be complete until at least tomorrow and possibly<BR>
   Tuesday...<BR>
<BR>
   I'll do what I can, but if the other guys are all done then just go <BR>
   ahead with the next phase (code-optimization?) without me and I'll<BR>
   "be there" as soon as possible...<BR>
<BR>
   Sorry guys, hate to let you down, but things didn't turn out as <BR>
   expected and I ended up losing (most of ) Thursday and Friday as<BR>
   I simply did not feel "up to par".  However, I am back 100% now!!!!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      Take  care,   <BR>
      GARFIELD<BR>
