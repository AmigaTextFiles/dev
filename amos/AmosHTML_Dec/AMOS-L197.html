Greetings.<BR>
<BR>
Just some news (for those that haven't heard, which I would guess would be<BR>
all if not most of you! hehe): The source code for Doom (from id Software<BR>
on da PC) has been released! This was a couple days before Christmas, and<BR>
after I heard about it, I went and got it. Very cool.<BR>
<BR>
The address for you to visit to get the source code is:<BR>
ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source<BR>
<BR>
Unfortuantely, due to copyright issues, John (Carmack, the creator of both<BR>
Wolfenstein, Doom, and Quake and their Engine's) and the id Company<BR>
*couldn't* release the PC (C,C++) source code, BUT, this version is for<BR>
Linux, thus making it pretty portable. It's in a .zip, and contains a<BR>
readme and the source in a .tar (UNIX compressed archive) :(<BR>
<BR>
Anyhow, this mail to both John Bintz but also CC'ed to the List (for<BR>
everyone else interested). Hope you enjoy! Thanks again.<BR>
