      This sounds fine to me. If DEMOTIME is greater than -1, I'll count<BR>
      down, once it hits 0 the stage ends... Great Idea!!<BR>
      Giark can simply set DEMOTIME in the Main Code and it will<BR>
      apply to all stages...<BR>
<BR>

      Yeah, I wondered about that. 30-seconds sounded good, but the<BR>
      overall 2 1/2 minutes does sound a bit long.  Maybe go with 15-20<BR>
      seconds per stage.  Anyway, using your idea Giark can set the<BR>
      timer to give just enough of a "taste" to hook people...<BR>
<BR>

   Very good... I will go ahead and implement this in my stage also.<BR>
   The "DEMO TIMER = XX" sounds good as well.  I'll put that right in<BR>
   the status bar using the "oh so simple" Print command...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
           --------<SLIGHTLY NEW SUBJECT BEGINS HERE>--------<BR>
   Giark, are you still alive?  I post a message bristling with frustration<BR>
   and you are right there giving encouragement, but I haven't heard<BR>
   anything about the MUSIC and DEMO support...<BR>
<BR>
   Anyway, I will implement the MUSIC support based on the status<BR>
   of CB_MUSIC (that's the name I'm using unless told otherwise)<BR>
   Basically, I'll replace the main sounds calls with BUBBA_FX and<BR>
   BUBBA_SP and the other sounds will be conditioned in with<BR>
   If Not(CB_MUSIC)<BR>
      Sound Played Here<BR>
   End If<BR>
<BR>
   Also, I'll use DEMOTIME to count down the demo...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      Take  care,   <BR>
      GARFIELD<BR>
