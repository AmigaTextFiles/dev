      Haha...  Okay, maybe I did go just a tiny bit overboard... :)  <BR>
      oh well, I guess I needed to be humbled anyway!!<BR>
<BR>
      I have that 1Vbl-update firmly ground into my mind and so, always<BR>
      am shooting for it. <BR>
<BR>
      Anyway, no need to worry Giark, I will finish the stage within the<BR>
      next day or two.  Oh and no more whining either... ;-)<BR>
<BR>
      Actually, if I had written this in CENSORED, then I'd have 1Vbl<BR>
      and you wouldn't have had to put up with my whining... the best<BR>
      of both worlds...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      Take  care,   <BR>
      GARFIELD<BR>
