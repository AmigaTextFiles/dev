Greetings.<BR>
<BR>
Thought you might want to pick up on CBATNAM, i.e. go back over some <BR>
of the variables, anything else that's needed (besides all our code!) <BR>
and things like that. I've had to go back and read through some old <BR>
messages to get some of the variables I need to put in my code! <BR>
Nonsense I say. Anyhow, it would be last-minute helpful.<BR>
<BR>
Also, does ANYONE know of (or better yet HAVE) any FAST Zoom-like <BR>
drawing routines (name off Extensions, some of which I have, or ANY <BR>
Assembler). That's the only way I'm going to get my level sped up at <BR>
all. I've used AMCAF, but it uses zoom factors (with Bzoom), and I <BR>
dont have time to do up any equations to handle them. (Plus, Giark <BR>
has to compile the code, and I'm not sure he has it. Neither do I, <BR>
well, demo version, haven't registered yet, but plan to). Help!<BR>
<BR>
Any help SOON would be appreciated. Thanks.<BR>
