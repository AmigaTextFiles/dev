It was on the night of 18-Dec-90, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Morten jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop<BR>
shouting about "Newsgroups&Stuff(Non Amos)" until I was forced to knock them<BR>
out:<BR>
-> Hello.<BR>
<BR>
-> Well, i think there maybee some persons that dont like it if i started <BR>
-> asking abouth everything i need help with outside Amos on the list, so<BR>
-> can someone recomend some nice active mailinglists or Newsgroups for the <BR>
-> Amiga, hvere i can ask for help on Software and Hardware problems in<BR>
general.<BR>
-> And also can somebody recomend a nice program to use with Newsgroups.<BR>
-> I'am currently using Miami and Yam, and i dont think Yam supports the usage<BR>
-> of Newsgroups.<BR>
<BR>
Well, you'd want the comp.sys.amiga.* newsgroups, there are about 13 different<BR>
ones there, plus countless scattered all over the place. The best reader to<BR>
get would be Thor or MNews, but I prefer Thor much better. Its on Aminet.<BR>
<BR>
-> And finally WHEN will Jade extensin be released???<BR>
-> I'am dying to use some AGA colours!!!<BR>
<BR>
I haven't heard anything either  =/<BR>
