On Sunday 14-Dec-97 at 23:00:16, a nutter named Jens Vang Petersen<BR>
had wet pants when they typed about `Samples..'.<BR>
<BR>
Hi there....<BR>
<BR>
>I'm in a bunch of trouble with a sample-loader I'm trying to build into<BR>
>a program. I want it to load several different formats.. BUT:<BR>
<BR>
>1) How do I get the sample-rate of an IFF-8SVX file ??<BR>
<BR>
Hmmm...duno about this one, sorry! If you just wanna know it off hand,<BR>
load  it  into any sample editor and read the value I guess! If you're<BR>
talking  about via your own prog, then you'll need to Peek or Leek the<BR>
file  probably as the value will be held in the file. (as long as it's<BR>
not RAW).<BR>
<BR>
>2) How do I convert a WAV (PC) sample to a raw one.. (Or just the file-<BR>
>   format :)..<BR>
<BR>
Get  a  copy  of OctaMed sound Studio. Load the sample and save it out<BR>
again as Raw Data. Eay peasy Lemon Squeezy :)<BR>
<BR>
>3) The file-format if an AIFF file ??<BR>
<BR>
Never heard of this one, sorry :(<BR>
<BR>
>4) If I want to scale a 8-bit sample (to another rate), is it as simple<BR>
>   as scaling GFX ??, is it just a matter of taking out, say every 3rd<BR>
>   byte or is there some nasty trick that needs to be done ??<BR>

<BR>
Get  hold  of  Audio  Master IV. It allows time stretching and you can<BR>
alter the sample rate easily too if you want. I've just heard of a new<BR>
program  named  Sound Probe which should be of use to you also. See CU<BR>
Amiga. There's a demo of Sound Probe on CUCD 18 too :)<BR>
<BR>
>I'm in trouble with some .au files, they're very noisy. I fact so noisy<BR>
>that it's almost imposible to hear the sound. I've written about this<BR>
>before and got some advice on '8/16 bit', 'flipping', 'signing' and the<BR>
>'sample rate'.. I've tried several processing-programs but with no luck.<BR>
>Is there any sample-expert who can solve it (I can send one of the<BR>
>samples if someone would like to look at it..)<BR>
<BR>
Try  contacting  CU Amiga's Tony Horgan on this one. He's a real sound<BR>
expert.  He's bound to know the answer. Tell you what, I'll email your<BR>
question  to  the  CU  Amiga Mailing List and ak for an answer on your<BR>
behalf....<BR>
<BR>
>I hope to get something from this, as I need it very bad, Thanx...<BR>
<BR>
I hope you do too :^)<BR>
<BR>
Tarra, Andy Gibson<BR>
<BR>
Merry Xmas BTW<BR>
