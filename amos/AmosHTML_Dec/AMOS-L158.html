   CBATNAM Team,<BR>
<BR>
   Just had another thought and since I plan on completing my stage<BR>
   tomorrow, thought I'd consult with you guys now...<BR>
<BR>
   How are we handling the demo-version of CBATNAM?  As in the<BR>
   demo Mush sends out for CoverDisks and such.<BR>
<BR>
   Obviously, we can't be giving out the full game, so I assume we (the<BR>
   stage-programmers) are to be supporting a demo-version, correct?<BR>
<BR>
   Just want to make sure this is what you want, although I don't see<BR>
   how else we could do it as effectively...<BR>
<BR>
   It's no problem, just give me another flag (DEMO) and if it's true<BR>
   I'll limit the duration of the game-play to about 30 seconds of Phase<BR>
   One (or maybe ten seconds each of Phases 1, 2 and 3)...<BR>
<BR>
   I think this would be just enough to "bait" the player into purchasing<BR>
   the full version.  We have five stages, so if we all gave a 30-second<BR>
   preview then we'd have a solid two and one-half minute playable-<BR>
   demo.  Actually, we could reserve the Bonus Stage for the<BR>
   registered users (more incentive to order the full version), but I<BR>
   have enough to think about, so you guys can sort that out... :-)<BR>
  <BR>
<BR>
   Anyway, just give me some feedback guys (Giark, Mush)... should<BR>
   I go ahead and add this demo-mode support?<BR>
<BR>
   If this has already been discussed then I apologize - I missed it...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      Take  care,   <BR>
      GARFIELD<BR>
