It was on the night of 12-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Eric jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting<BR>
about "Re: MPD Announcement: F1 Software deal clinched!!" until I was forced<BR>
to knock them out:<BR>
<BR>
-> Catalogue disks? Are these like prog,cost,description if so will this be on<BR>
-> your web page, or do they have demos on them as well, and if so can we down<BR>
-> load the disks from your web page, and how many of them are their?<BR>
<BR>
Each program isnt individually priced, it goes off the number of disks. I dont<BR>
get to set the prices either, but I do get to modify what goes on the disks. I<BR>
will be holding descriptions of every title in the library, with the<BR>
possibility of screenshots etc. Depending on space on the disk, there may be<BR>
demo's, but I have at least 30 links to demo versions of many F1 titles at<BR>
this time, so I may just leave demo's as links on the homepages. I shall also<BR>
be trying to squeeze my Mushroom PD indexes on their too.<BR>
<BR>
It will be downloadable from my homepages, as well as a fully-updated HTML<BR>
version.<BR>
<BR>
The catalogue will be a single disk in size, so people can even mail it around<BR>
to mates etc.<BR>
