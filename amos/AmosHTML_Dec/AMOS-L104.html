It was on the night of 13-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Jens jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting<BR>
about "GUI extension.." until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>
-> Hello..<BR>
<BR>
-> I've started to use the GUI extension (great stuff) but a few questions<BR>
-> has popped up:<BR>
<BR>
-> 1) The command 'Gui Title' is noted in the guide, however that command<BR>
->    does not exist (Looked in the lib with a hex-monitor and found that<BR>
->    the command is called 'Gui Titles')..<BR>
<BR>
This is a known bug in the guide file. You also have to have 2 entries for<BR>
each command, where IIRC the guide said you could use just one.<BR>
<BR>
-> 2) While looking in the lib I noted that the extension calls up the<BR>
->    'Gadtools.Library'. Is this a rom-lib (like exec) or should it be<BR>
->    in my libs: (it isn't there but the extension runs great anyway)..<BR>
<BR>
It works fine without it, as it is a ROM lib.<BR>
<BR>
-> 3) There's a slight bug in 'Gui Asl', if I pad the path with '/' (like<BR>
->    'ab3:includes/' then the returned filename holds two '/' in row <BR>
->    ('ab3:includes//test.lnk') and the file can't be found by amos..<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I fixed this problem in one of my examples for the next release of the<BR>
extension. Le,mme get the code...<BR>
<BR>
   If A=9<BR>
      ' Grab a file from the user<BR>
      Do <BR>
         F$=Gui Asl$("Pick a List of Email<BR>
recipients..."+Chr$(0),Dir$,"",Chr$(0))<BR>
         F$=Gui Dir$<BR>
         If Mid$(F$,Len(F$),1)<>"/" and Mid$(F$,Len(F$),1)<>":" : F$=F$+"/" :<BR>
End If <BR>
         F$=F$+Gui File$<BR>
         <BR>
         If Gui File$="" : Exit : End If : Rem Exit <BR>
         <BR>
         If Exist(F$) and F$<>""<BR>
            Dir$=Gui Dir$<BR>
            TEMP$="" : Gui Set 1,2,0,Varptr(TEMP$)<BR>
            TEMP$=F$ : Gui Set 1,2,0,Varptr(TEMP$)<BR>
            Exit <BR>
         End If <BR>
      Loop <BR>
   End If <BR>
<BR>
This is the code I use in my MPDMailpostV2 routine, and it handles it all<BR>
fine. It also handles the bug for when you change directorys, as it will<BR>
only add the / onto the end if it really needs it.<BR>
<BR>
Any other questions, just ask!<BR>
