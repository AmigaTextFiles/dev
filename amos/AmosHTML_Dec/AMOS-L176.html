<BR>
      So, we (stage-programmers) don't even need to worry about a<BR>
      demo-mode as you'll just set LIVES=1 in the MasterCode and<BR>
      that will apply to all of the stages, correct?  <BR>
      Sounds good, certainly makes it easier on us!!<BR>
<BR>
      I think a GOOD player might be able to complete my stage with<BR>
      just one life, so perhaps you could add a tiny check and if the<BR>
      demo-stage being played is the SideShooter, you could cut the<BR>
      energy in half: BUBBASHIELD=50 <BR>
<BR>
 <BR>
      I've added the support code for multiple lives, music/fx and now just<BR>
      need to clean up a few things. Mainly just removing the counter in<BR>
      Phase One, fps/chipram-calculation/display and all that<BR>
      development-junk.<BR>
<BR>
      You will definitely have the final version by Wednesday as I don't<BR>
      know of anything else I can do. Maybe remove the comments and<BR>
      possibly clean-up the source a bit, but I think for an AMOS<BR>
      program it's pretty clean right now...<BR>
<BR>
      Speaking of which, I seem to remember someone (Keith?) <BR>
      mentioning an extension that allowed AMOS programs to use<BR>
      CONSTANTS and STRUCTURES... this would be a key factor in<BR>
      my decision to do future AMOS-programming, so what is the<BR>
      name of this extension? All I can think of is EasyLife, is that it??<BR>
<BR>
      Anyone considered writing a FAST parallel-blitting routine?<BR>
      I'm thinking of something that would set-up the blitter and while<BR>
      that was drawing one image-bitplane, the CPU would draw the next<BR>
      image-bitplane.  Probably not much difference on a 68000, but with<BR>
      a 68020 and certainly 68030 or higher, it could be MUCH faster<BR>
      than AMOS's current Bob-routines as a FAST CPU might be able<BR>
      to draw two image-bitplanes per the blitter's one.<BR>
      Instead of calling WaitBlitter() and having the CPU doing nothing<BR>
      while the blitter does all the work, why not actually use the CPU to<BR>
      draw the next bitplane (or two on FAST processors). <BR>
 <BR>
      Another thing I've considered is a few general purpose ASM<BR>
      routines that can process a list of objects simultaneously. You<BR>
      could pass the address of an array along with the number of "reps"<BR>
      and the ASM-module would add/subtract a value from this array,<BR>
      or you could pass two array-addresses and the ASM would add<BR>
      the contents of the second array (delta-values and such) to the<BR>
      contents of the first array.<BR>
<BR>
      When is that JADE AGA-extension to be released?  If I remember<BR>
      correctly that was to contain VERY FAST Bob-routines... <BR>
      hmmm... since it is still in development, perhaps they could <BR>
      implement the parallel-blitting design.  Then the thing that has<BR>
      always been one of AMOS's greatest weaknesses (Bobs/blitting)<BR>
      would become it's greatest strength!!!!<BR>
<BR>
 <BR>
      Take  care,   <BR>
