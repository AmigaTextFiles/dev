Mushroom PD has signed all the necessary paperwork to become an official F1<BR>
distributor in the USA, and distribution of all existing F1 Software titles<BR>
should start from early January 1998. The necessary details were cleared<BR>
with Phil Wilkinson earlier this week, and the masters have mostly arrived<BR>
here.<BR>
<BR>
F1 Software is a high-quality licenseware library, which distributes high<BR>
quality, exclusive software by programmers all around the world. The<BR>
library contains all kinds of games, utilities, tools, educational<BR>
software, and everything else that could cover your Amiga needs.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next couple of weeks, I shall be working on my catalogue disks<BR>
configured to US prices. If you would like to receive a copy when its<BR>
finished, please email me at mushypd@redrose.net where I will be more than<BR>
happy to oblige.<BR>
<BR>
Thank-you<BR>
<BR>
