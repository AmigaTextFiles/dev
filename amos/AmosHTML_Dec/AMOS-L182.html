On the day of: 24-Dec-97, a guy called: Ragnar Fyri<BR>
was jumping on his keyboard, resulting in a text about: Files and stuff<BR>
<BR>
>I tried uploading some files to Aminet the other day, but it didn't <BR>

<BR>
>http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Alley/6837/<BR>
<BR>
>and the dl links are at the bottom of the page. Can someone here put <BR>
>them on Aminet for me? (Remember to change the uploader info. And the <BR>
>filename suffixes - I had to change them to make Geocities accept them.) <BR>
<BR>
I just uploaded them for you, and it should work. :)<BR>
<BR>
>And if anyone else wants to put them in their own collections you are <BR>
>welcome; just let me know.<BR>
<BR>

>What the files contain? Well, one is Amos related, the other is not... <BR>
>If you're really interested, read the txt files. If you're not, don't <BR>
>ask. ;)<BR>
