On 04-Dec-97, Ryan Watson smashed the keyboard with:<BR>
>I'm currently working on a game which I have entitled Fleshee 2000.<BR>
<BR>
>I have done very little on the actual game coding, but am almost finished<BR>
>the editor.<BR>
<BR>
>What I'm trying to get to is, I am having small problems dealing with<BR>
>screen drawing and saving.<BR>
<BR>
>The screen refresh procedure for when you move from one map to the next<BR>
>runs at a fairly fast speed, but it is not as fast as I need/want it to be.<BR>
>Can someone give me some code to quickly draw 10X10 icons on the screen<BR>
>with a grid of 29X15?<BR>
<BR>
My best shot: The turbo+ extension has speedy commands for this..<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
>My other problem deals with the saving method I am using. Basically what it<BR>
>does is run through each screen and saves each little block. It will run<BR>
>fine with about 10 screens or so, but when it is at 100 screens (the max<BR>
>for my editor) it takes a horribly long time when it only has to save about<BR>
>41K of information.<BR>
<BR>
>What would be the fastest way to save this assuming any map configuration<BR>
>from 2X2 to 50X2 and each screen has to save 435 variables?<BR>
<BR>
Stock the variables and maps in a bank (Tools extension is good at this), <BR>
and then save the bank (save or Bsave)<BR>
<BR>
NB: Turbo+ is a comercial extension..<BR>
Tools extension is PD (Aminet or my homepage..)<BR>

Happy greetings, Yours..<BR>
