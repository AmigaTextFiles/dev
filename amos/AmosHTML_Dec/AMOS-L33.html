It was on the night of 07-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Keith jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop<BR>
shouting about "Cap'n Bubba and the Castle Assault stage." until I was forced<BR>
to knock them out:<BR>
-> Well, the code is effectively done apart from a few tweaks, the sound<BR>
-> is done (apart from maybe a tweak), and a lot of things have improved.<BR>
-> The new graphics for the levels are about done, as is level design,<BR>
-> but not yet implemented, and will be coming as an update VERY shortly.<BR>
<BR>
That reminds me, Im still doing the scroll text for the hiscore routine, so if<BR>
anyone has any messages/greets etc. they want in, get the AMOS DATA statements<BR>
to me by monday night!!<BR>
