Hello all,<BR>
<BR>
Just a note to let you know that awhile ago I wrote an ARexx script<BR>
for my Thor system that will allow you to copy all the messages in<BR>
a Thor Conference to HTML format.<BR>
<BR>
I am going to do just that for the AMOS-L and upload it to Aminet<BR>
(I hope).  If not just email me and I will send it off to you.<BR>
<BR>
There are two types of HTML processes for this.  One is that I copy<BR>
each message to it's own HTML page with an Index (of course) and<BR>
the other is for one huge HTML page with links within the document<BR>
to all the messages (sort of a digest).<BR>
<BR>
I haven't found a browser that supports the links within the document<BR>
for the Amiga yet, so I have to use IE4.0 on my PeeCee :(<BR>
<BR>
Tell me what you think of this Idea.  I know that all the messages<BR>
will be uploaded (sooner or later) to Aminet (and I joined the list late<BR>
so there is only about 240 messages there) but I hated trying to go<BR>
through a hugh text file line by line (sucks)....this is *MUCH* better<BR>
