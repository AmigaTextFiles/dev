It was on the night of 03-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Hakan jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop<BR>
shouting about "screen" until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>
-> Is there some way to make Amosprograms display<BR>
-> on WBScreen in a window or must these programs always use an ownscreeen?<BR>
<BR>
Its possible with the GUI extension, which should be available to the public<BR>
very soon!<BR>
