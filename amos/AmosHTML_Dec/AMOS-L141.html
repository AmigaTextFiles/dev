It was on the night of 18-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, geosync@ozemail.com.au jumped out from behind a rock and<BR>
wouldnt stop shouting about "Multi Tasking" until I was forced to knock them<BR>
out:<BR>
-> Hello again,<BR>
<BR>
-> Does Amos Pro have a Multi Tasking override so that I can switch off<BR>
-> multi-tasking during run-time?<BR>
<BR>
You could use commands such as Multi Off, or I use E=Errcall(-132) (-136 to<BR>
turn it back on again before doing anything in AMOS) but you will lose things<BR>
such as keyboard uses (although one extension overrides that) as well as disk<BR>
access.<BR>
