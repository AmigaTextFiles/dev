On 27-Dec-97, geosync@ozemail.com.au smashed the keyboard with:<BR>
>Hi Jens,<BR>
<BR>
>You say you can open an AGA screen with AMOS, GUI and OSDevKit?<BR>
<BR>
YES, but the key is the OSDevKit, the GUI just handles my requesters as<BR>
they are very difficult to write in the OSDevKit..<BR>
<BR>
If you'd like something simpler to open AGA screens then drop by the<BR>
AmiNET and look in the 'dev/amos' there's an extension called<BR>
'intuition' it's also capable of opening AGA screens and uses full<BR>
intuition. Unfortunaly the docs are not even half-finnished, but some<BR>
good examples comes along and makes it a little easier to use. The only<BR>
problem with THAT extension is that it's not capable of setting colours<BR>
in AGA notification, it only uses the old fassion 4bit setting, while<BR>
the OSDevKit can set the colours in 32bit (AGA standard)...<BR>
<BR>
I've also heard that the next version of GUI is capable of opening AGA<BR>
screens but I've not seen it yet...<BR>
<BR>
If you'd like the intuition extension (both TC and PRO can run), then<BR>
visit the extension-list at my homepage, I've got a download-link there<BR>
to the AmiNET at 'paderborn'. It's in slot 25..<BR>

Happy greetings, Yours..<BR>
