I tried uploading some files to Aminet the other day, but it didn't <BR>
work, so I put them on my website instead. The address is<BR>
<BR>
http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Alley/6837/<BR>
<BR>
and the dl links are at the bottom of the page. Can someone here put <BR>
them on Aminet for me? (Remember to change the uploader info. And the <BR>
filename suffixes - I had to change them to make Geocities accept them.) <BR>
And if anyone else wants to put them in their own collections you are <BR>
welcome; just let me know.<BR>
<BR>
What the files contain? Well, one is Amos related, the other is not... <BR>
If you're really interested, read the txt files. If you're not, don't <BR>
ask. ;)<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and Merry Christmas!<BR>
