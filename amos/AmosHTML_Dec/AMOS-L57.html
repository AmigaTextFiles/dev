   Ahem... "nerd" deep intelligent voice?  Thanks! :)<BR>
<BR>
<SNIP!! - List of 19 samples was here...><BR>

<BR>
   If you can wait a day, until I complete this latest version of my<BR>
   sideshooter stage, I'll take a shot at it. Actually, the sideshooter<BR>
   speech is like "normal" (my normal nerdy voice I guess), but if you<BR>
   need them really DEEEEEEEEP, I can certainly do that as well...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      Take  care,   <BR>
      GARFIELD<BR>
