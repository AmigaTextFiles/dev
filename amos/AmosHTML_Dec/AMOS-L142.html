It was on the night of 03-Jan-78, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Peter jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop<BR>
shouting about "CDburners (not amos)" until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>
<BR>
-> Hi,<BR>
<BR>
->  Im thinking of getting a CD-r soon, but I use IDE-fix for my CdRom.<BR>
-> Does anyone know if the Mitsumi 2600 (cd writer) works with IDE-fix<BR>
-> or any Atapi software, or would it be better to get a SCSi CD-r ?<BR>
<BR>
-> Please reply a.s.a.p as I am in a real hurry to find out,<BR>
<BR>
The CD ROM burners I have seen are all APTAPI compatible, so I imagine it<BR>
should work fine.<BR>
