 Hi,<BR>
<BR>
 I think this is directed to Garfield, or one of the people with a good voice... Oh well, anyway, I need some samples digitized...<BR>
<BR>
 I need them in 8bit (yuck), 44100 (yay), and I want the following said in a "nerd" deep intelligent voice..<BR>
<BR>
 "We have lift off in 20 seconds..."<BR>
 "15 seconds"<BR>
 "Engines start, all primary power systems online"<BR>
 "Engage Thruster sequence"<BR>
 "All functions online"<BR>
 "All functions have passed check point"<BR>
 "And in 10"<BR>
 "9"<BR>
 "8"<BR>
 "7"<BR>
 "6"<BR>
 "5"<BR>
 "4"<BR>
 "3"<BR>
 "2"<BR>
 "1"<BR>
 "We have lift off, repeat, we have lift off"<BR>
 "Course is set"<BR>
 "Engage and control automatic guidence system"<BR>
<BR>
 If you can do that in a really deep, cool HUMAN (it has to sound human like), then I'll be glad to get the samples from you :)<BR>
