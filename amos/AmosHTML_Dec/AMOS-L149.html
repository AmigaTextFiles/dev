It was on the night of 19-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Alastair jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop<BR>
shouting about "PFS" until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>
-> I've had reports that my program goes wrong with PFS (Profi File<BR>
-> System - or something) <BR>
<BR>
-> This could either be AMOS or just the disk reading AMCAF commands.<BR>
-> Any idea which? Any solutions?<BR>
<BR>
Ive never heard of the file system, but the AMCAF disk commands seem to be<BR>
quite stable. I did experience heavy crashing when I combined the AMCAF<BR>
extension with the JD extensions, so I removed the JD from my setup, and it<BR>
cured my program completely.<BR>
<BR>
-> Also.... anyone know why my clock would ALWAYS set itself back 10<BR>
-> minutes upon reset????<BR>
<BR>
I often get my clock completely screwing up when I crash my Ami, its just<BR>
one of those wierd things due to the way it saves the clock to the card, hehe!<BR>
