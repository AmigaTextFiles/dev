This is not a virus ! I think, it's a bug in the THX extension (Jotre) because <BR>
i've got the same problem during the development of my extension (DOOM Music Extension). <BR>
But i've removed this bug. :)<BR>

You can use the DME for playing THX sounds with different commands like<BR>
Thx Vu,Thx Continue,Thx Voice (for playing SFX) etc. It's available on Mush's homepage.<BR>
