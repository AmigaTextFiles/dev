   Well, I'm putting some time in, but I wouldn't say I'm bustin' my hump<BR>
   trying to get it done.  Just steadily chopping away...<BR>
<BR>
   Now, for a quick update on the sideshooter stage's progress:<BR>
<BR>
   The Final Boss battle is now up n' running and the SnapshotGrabber<BR>
   is implemented (in fact I've already sent Mush four snapshots)...<BR>
<BR>
   Now, it's on to the important clean-up and fine-tuning bits.  The thing<BR>
   is with this being the absolute LAST version of our stages I have to<BR>
   keep working on it until everything is fully implemented, cleaned-up<BR>
   and fine-tuned, otherwise I'd send a new demo now and work all this<BR>
   stuff into the next one...<BR>
<BR>
   Anyway, here is the remaining items on my worklist:<BR>
<BR>
   1. Complete Final Boss Battle by adding SS_FBDESTROYED<BR>
       module.<BR>
<BR>
   2. Modify keyboard-code to use player's key-prefs (variables) rather<BR>
       than the current hard-coded key-values.<BR>
<BR>
   3. Decrease the stage length to the minimize needed for the stage<BR>
       and convert the long-word size map-data to byte-size map-data.<BR>
       I already have created the utility to do this, so just need to <BR>
       determine the final map-size then run through the convertor.<BR>
<BR>
   4. Replace the current "SpriteBob Col()"-based collision detection<BR>
       with my custom rectangular-based collision-detection routines.<BR>
       I converted to SpriteBob in the last demo as I thought it might be<BR>
       faster on the low-end machines like stock A500s and such, but<BR>
       the SpriteBob are no faster (and are slower on faster machines)<BR>
       and also error-prone.  The scrolling screws them up.<BR>
<BR>
   5. Add support for music playing.  One thing I've always found with<BR>
       Amiga programming is it's so limiting having just four voices, and<BR>
       sound effects add so much to a game that I never even bother<BR>
       with music as I tend to need all four voices just give good audio<BR>
       feedback.  <BR>
       Giark, I need some way to determine if music is being played.<BR>
       Rather than using the variables you listed, I'd rather make a<BR>
       more dedicated design for handling music to maximize the <BR>
       audio-feedback.<BR>
<BR>
   6. Tweak the asteroid phase, it should be faster.<BR>
<BR>
   7. Tweak the MidBoss phase, it needs to move off-screen further<BR>
       when destroyed and then, of course, all bobs need to be freed.<BR>
<BR>
   8. Add a slightly more interesting "beginning" to the stage.<BR>
<BR>
   9. Design a simple "death-sequence" and implement that as just<BR>
       fading out the disply and saying Bubba has been obliterated is<BR>
       pretty "cheap".<BR>
<BR>
   10. Design a simple "victory sequence" and implement that as just<BR>
        saying Congratulations, Bubba has cleared the SideShooter is<BR>
        also pretty "cheap".<BR>
<BR>
    Finally, I'm really not happy with the speed (or lack of it actually),<BR>
    so I'd like to boost the speed on lower-spec systems.  Probably not<BR>
    possible as just the gfx-updates seem to be pushing AMOS to the<BR>
    limit. :(<BR>
<BR>
    I'm not giving a date for completion as there's no sense in it.  As<BR>
    soon as I have everything done and all working satisfactorily, I will<BR>
    send Giark the source and executable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      Take  care,   <BR>
      GARFIELD<BR>
