It was on the night of 04-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Jens jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting<BR>
about "Foundation.." until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>
-> Ok, now I think it's time for a little help to foundation, that bloddy<BR>
-> 'mush' has made me aware of :)<BR>
<BR>
-> 1) What's a 'peasant-hut' for (what do you get from it) ??..<BR>
<BR>
Well, if you want your population to expand and grow, not to mention<BR>
position itself around the island better, you need to build these for your<BR>
people to live in. You have to note, the master house can only hold x<BR>
number of people before it starts to become damaged to mass overcrowding.<BR>
<BR>
-> 2) When I get to about year 23/24 I begin to loose people quite fast <BR>
->    (mission 2), I've build a hospital, and have plenty of food in stock ??<BR>
<BR>
You also have to keep their morality high, if they have no task, or they<BR>
get sick of eating wheat over and over again, then their morale will be so<BR>
low, they might decide to kill themselves!<BR>
<BR>
Go into GAME STATISTICS and click on the one with the cross, as it shows<BR>
you every person who has died, and what they died off.<BR>
<BR>
Are you sure your population didnt get a virus of some kind? The guys have<BR>
flies buzzing round their heads if they do.<BR>
<BR>
Also, if the enemy attacked you, because you had no guards and such, they<BR>
just slaughtered you, hehe!<BR>
<BR>
-> 3) Is it possible to stop a fire in a building before the building gets<BR>
->    destroyed ??<BR>
<BR>
Yes, simply summon a wizard to the building to put it out.<BR>
<BR>
-> 4) I can't increse the population (also se point 2), what am I doing wrong<BR>
?<BR>
<BR>
See above. You have to expand.<BR>
