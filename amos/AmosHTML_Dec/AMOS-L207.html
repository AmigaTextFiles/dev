Yea, and if you need any, you can always ask for some. I have most of them<BR>
up on my web site (listed below in sig) under "Information.. Links" page.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Hm.. well, I could flame up a bit here, BUT I won't since someone finally<BR>
did (even though I WAS going to after the Holidays and updating my site as<BR>
Mush and I had talked about it for a bit some time ago.)<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
1. Yes, I'm going to join. 2. My site is NOTHING BUT AMOS if nothing else!<BR>
3. I don't plan on using the .GIFs for my ring (I'm going to make a small<BR>
cool table with some 3D .gif's and add all the info there.). They look ok,<BR>
but I would prefer something that fits my site's motif.<BR>
<BR>
> You may now flame me. :)<BR>
Consider yourself flamed.<BR>
