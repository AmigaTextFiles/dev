It was on the night of 06-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Troy jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting<BR>
about "Re: Foundation" until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>
-> >> Where does one pick up the Foundation Game?<BR>
-> >Some of it's on aminet, the rest is on mush's ftp site.<BR>
-> Kinda makes it hard to get all the pieces don't it?  What are<BR>
-> all the archive names?  I did a search on Foundation and nothing<BR>
-> turned up - on either site.<BR>
<BR>
-> Yo! - Mushy! Can you send me the whole distribution (PD)?<BR>
<BR>
OK, i'll put up a list here of *ALL* available foundation goodies, and<BR>
before anyone asks, im not goine to email archives, as a basic demo will<BR>
take at least 4Mb of Lha archives, and thats only for a crappy game!<BR>

AGA Mugshots (people's faces) for use in the game. Optional, but looks<BR>
nicer when they are installed. Each face is different (for each bloke) and<BR>
is better than looking at the same pic for each bloke/maiden. NOTE that<BR>
these are not compatible with the RTG version!!<BR>

<BR>
The optional samples file for the game. Its optional, but I highly<BR>
reccomend that you get this file, as there are some beautifull sounds in<BR>
there which reallty add to the atmosphere of the game.<BR>
<BR>

mode, only reccomended for very fast Amiga's.<BR>
<BR>
FoundMedium.lha           657208 ----rw-d 26-Nov-97 07:29:54<BR>
<BR>
Again, modifications to play the game on a meduim sized resolution.<BR>

FoundUpdate.lzx           690691 ----rwed Wednesday 00:07:53<BR>
<BR>
This file will always be the latest update of the game. I'll post to my<BR>
homepages when newer versions are available. This is currently the 6th<BR>
update, which you will need to get and also install correctly to fix some<BR>
of the major bugs in the first releases.<BR>
