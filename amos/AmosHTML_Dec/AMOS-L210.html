   Well, I wouldn't say "AMOS isn't the best language for ANY type of<BR>
   program",  It's great for throwing together utilities and such.  Also<BR>
   good for certain styles of games-programming, for example AMOS<BR>
   should easily be able to handle a flip-screen game like Flashback and<BR>
   I'm sure it could handle a nice Warcraft-clone as well.<BR>
   Command&Conquer might overload it with all the missile-weapons,<BR>
   explosions and such, but you could make a scaled-down version...<BR>
<BR>
   Actually, with a lower frame-rate (20-25fps), all kinds of games can<BR>
   be implemented in AMOS. Just don't try to clone SNES/Genesis <BR>
   style games with a standard frame-rate of 50/60fps or you'll be in for<BR>
   one heck of a fun time, trust me!!<BR>
<BR>
  <BR>
      Take  care,   <BR>
