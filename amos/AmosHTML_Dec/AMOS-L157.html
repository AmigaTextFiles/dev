>>Haha...  Okay, maybe I did go just a tiny bit overboard... :)  <BR>
>>oh well, I guess I needed to be humbled anyway!!<BR>

<BR>
      Haha!!  Yes, I know... you are a riot, Giark.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      If I remember correctly,  we have two voices to use:<BR>
      BUBBA_FX and BUBBA_SP<BR>
      So, now I just need to determine the best way to "compress"<BR>
      everything to use only two voices as I have been using four voices<BR>
      for the sound effects. I figured we'd just have a flag set for the<BR>
      music option and if the user did NOT want music, we'd<BR>
      conditional-in the sound effects)...<BR>
      I still think this would be the best/easiest way to handle it.  Give<BR>
      me a variable to check for the music-status and I'll just add a<BR>
      conditional-check to the sound calls.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      BTW - The frame-rate will be a bit more stable as I have dropped<BR>
                a few procedure-calls by joining a few together. The<BR>
                "engine"-limits have been scaled-down: used to handle<BR>
                a max of 29 bobs simultaneously and this final version can<BR>
                handle a max of 20 bobs simultaneously.  Hopefully, this<BR>
                will make a few people happy (I'm not the only one who<BR>
                wanted to eliminate the slow-down).<BR>
<BR>
                Also requested in many beta-reviews - improved gfx:<BR>
                two enemies in phase one use an orangish-scheme<BR>
                and I've tweaked the palette in phases one & two.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
   Just remembered, my stage doesn't support multiple-lives, so I'll<BR>
   need to add a routine or two to handle losing a life as well as the<BR>
   standard flickering-in while invincible.<BR>
<BR>
   That's it, once I have support for music (FLAG please) and Bubba's<BR>
   multiple-lives my stage WILL be complete!!!!!<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
   <BR>
      Take  care,   <BR>
      GARFIELD<BR>
