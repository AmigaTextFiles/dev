Has anyone got a util to convert AMOS source into an ASCII file?<BR>
<BR>
or...<BR>
<BR>
Is it possible to write an AMOS program which can in turn load a source and <BR>
save it as ASCII?<BR>
<BR>
or...<BR>
<BR>
Does anybody know the format in which source is stored?<BR>
<BR>
I am after something which I can use via DOpus - Just double click the <BR>
*.AMOS name and it appears in a readable format.<BR>
<BR>
Also, can anybody send me some instructions on how to create installer <BR>
scripts?<BR>
(Please don't point me at Aminet as I don't have full net access).<BR>
<BR>
Thanks in advance,<BR>
Wayne<BR>
