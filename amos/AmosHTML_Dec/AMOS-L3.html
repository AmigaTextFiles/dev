It was on the night of 04-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Peter jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop<BR>
shouting about "Re: Offtopic: Foundation" until I was forced to knock them<BR>
out:<BR>
-> Somebody by the name of Mush wrote a letter for some reason possibly<BR>
-> 'Offtopic: Foundation' and so heres a reply 8)  :<BR>
<BR>
-> hello,<BR>
<BR>
-> >Just to please all those people who already dislike me for taking away all<BR>
-> >their spare time <grin> the 6th update for the Foundation demo is now<BR>
-> >available from my FTP site in /pub/foundation/<BR>
<BR>
-> Why does EVERYONE like foundation so much ?<BR>
<BR>
Basically, because its so much fun to play! Especially now. I remember the<BR>
first time I saw it, and that was about 12 months ago. It has certainly<BR>
come along heaps and bounds.<BR>
<BR>
-> I like those kind of games but I think that the settlers is much better.<BR>
-> I have downloaded the full game a while ago and it was extremly buggy and<BR>
slow<BR>
-> I didn't get to play the game that much as I lost intrest in it cos it<BR>
crashed<BR>
-> so much - I never got to play a full game of it without it crashing.<BR>
<BR>
The full version of Settlers, or foundation? If its Foundation your talking<BR>
about, you havent been getting the updates then (up to 6 ATM, 7 tomorrow)<BR>
which fix probhlems Paul has been aware of.<BR>
<BR>
-> >This update features some rather funky stuff, and I got back from a show<BR>
in<BR>
-> >Maryland last night, after making my Amiga star of the moment whilst<BR>
showing<BR>
-> >off the excellent features of Foundation, as well as some GUI Extension<BR>
-> >examples.<BR>
<BR>
-> Is there many diffrences between the demo versions ?, Im not sure what demo<BR>
-> version I have. Why is the game so big ? The settlers is only 900k (approx)<BR>
-> including all music,sfx and graphics. I there has been many changes I might<BR>
-> download the new version.<BR>
<BR>
You only need the update files, and to install them. The game is so big,<BR>
because it has so much fantastic stuff in it. Its being developed for CD<BR>
ROM, so why not exploit all that lovely space, with ray-traced pics, heaps<BR>
of sound, music, and GFXX to top it all off!<BR>
<BR>
If you compare settlers to Foundation, then you will easily see that<BR>
foundation has pages and pages or more features in it, which is why it is<BR>
currently the worlds #1 most awaited game on the Amiga.<BR>
