It was on the night of 22-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Rune jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting<BR>
about "zelda-style" until I was forced to knock them out:<BR>
-> I'm doing a zelda/action style game and currently need some graphics, sound<BR>
-> and music. It must be in the Zelda/Nintendo style which means chipmusic and<BR>
-> cute gfx. Please reply if you're interested.<BR>
<BR>
I start6ed work on a zelda game eons ago, bit it didnt run too quickly as I<BR>
was using lame routines. I can send you my tile sets if you want them, its<BR>
about 150 tile pieces I was using to construct buildings, grass, and other<BR>
pieces in the tile manner in the gameboy version.<BR>
