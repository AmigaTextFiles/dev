It was on the night of 11-Dec-97, when no creatures were stirring, and all was<BR>
silent. Suddenly, Wayne jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop<BR>
shouting about "Re: AMOS>Txt + Installer docs" until I was forced to knock<BR>
them out:<BR>
<BR>
-> Do I recall correctly that the source for Amos is now PD?<BR>
-> If so, does anyone know where I could get it.<BR>
-> I think if I had the source then I could just pull out the LOAD, BLOCK ALL <BR>
-> and SAVE AS ASCII commands and stick them into an executable .<BR>
<BR>
The source for AMOS has been speculated for a while, but so far nothing has<BR>
ever become of it.<BR>
<BR>
Doesnt the Pro Compiler APCmp export as ASCII? I'll have to read thru one<BR>
of the manuals.<BR>
