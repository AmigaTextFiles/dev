     Unfortunately Yahoo store messages in a way which means more than 1 space

     Thanks to Mark de Jong (from the AMOS-LIST) for helping me with rebuilding

     Thanks to Andrew Allen for preserving Peter Cahill's ASCII signiture for
     me (see message 1613) in November 1998.

     Thanks to Michael Cox, as I was able to cross-reference some emails from

After thinking about this problem, turning it up 'n down, I agree with
you, Truls,
it is the best way.
Even storing all datas in a bank, and poking at varptr(x)+I won't be
faster, and may cause crashes...
I just think about this : Maybe you can try to use the hard-pain way:
a$(1,1)="1st value"
a$(1,2)="2nd value"
...and 585463 lines later:
a$(127,16)="Last value (phew!)"

If you write a little prog that generates a .ASC file containing all the
variables, the you just have to merge this into your project... I really
don't know if this will speed up the intitializations. Maybe...

Naaaaah, progress bar rulez !

Off-Topic: Scsi.device

Tue Nov 2, 1999 12:17 pm
Rune Keller <keller@vip.cybercity.dk>


Sorry to bother you with off-topic stuff, but I have a problem I can't seem to
solve.

At exactly 1st november 00:00 I started to get two nasty guru-style requestors
every time I boot. They say something like:

"OS Development Group Warning

You are using an expired beta of
IDE_scsidsk 43.24 (9.11.98)

For legal and safety reasons please replace it."

The other requestor says the same, except that file is "fs 43.20 (9.11.98)"

It seems that it is the files Loadv43Module, a1000.ld.strip and fastfilesystem
that causes the mess. These come from the Amiga.de page and are supposed to
fix scsi.device for the problems with the 4Gb limit on harddisks and have
worked fine until now...

Anyway, the betas are now expired and there are apparently no new versions
anywhere. I can set my clock a year back, but that's not really a great
solution.

Have anybody experienced the same (somebody must have!) or do anybody know a
good solution?

Translated from a message in a french mailing-list I did not check that
:

At ftp.phase5.de in pub/phase5/scsi you will find FFS 44.7 ( I don't
remember the exact name of the archive but it's here ) and with this
version, there are no more problems, whatever IDE or SCSI.
Of course disks >4go are supported.

Surely you could redesign the routine now with the result being a

The amiga.de page says that betas are betas for testing and not general use,
so even if it fixes the problem it isn't strictly safe. Maybe use Arq (I think)
to automatically cancel the requesters before they appear.

Amos to C converter

"Gaz Davidson" <gaz_d@hotmail.com>



I`ve been thinking about making an Amos source code to C source code
converter so that I can recompile all my Amos stuff on the PC...

No, seriously! If you were only allowed to show one screen at a time, with
no sprites - only bobs, no interrupts (no amal, no rainbows etc..)

It might even work (when I can work out a way of re-writing Amos
"string equations")

Does anyone fancy giving me a hand re-writing the 400+ Amos commands as a
vast pile of header files in C?

This is a cool idea but completely unnecessary unless you simply want the
fun of the project itself.

If you are familiar with C/C++ then simply download the Allegro library
and you will find all of the audio/video commands which AMOS has
plus a bunch more offering realtime rotation, scaling, and even true 3d.

Have fun!

And such program already exists.. Amos2C somewhere in Aminet, but it
converts only the program structures (do/loop for/next if/endif...)

I'd be *VERY* glad if a program doing full conversion existed, even
considering the 1-screen/No-sprites... limits !

On a stock A1200??? Don't be silly, it'd only get 50fps on at least an 030.
It has automatic frameskiping though.

URL: IVWT?56_`a9`NZd\R@WYbeeF\iIqhM`LMgjvt/

Here is the key part of the encryption:

Where position is the current character position in the URL string

Very easy to decode. Most likely, someone is already writing a

Here's my 50fps map scrolling routine, it needs the turbo extention, and

Okay, here is the single line which when placed inside a loop the length
of the encrypted string will decode the encrypted URL:
*StringChar++ -= position;

Obviously that C speak basically translates to the following
AMOS speak:
Mid$(STRINGCHAR$, POSITION, 1) =
Chr$( Asc( Mid$(STRINGCHAR$, POSITION, 1) ) - POSITION )
OR:
CHAR = Asc( Mid$(STRINGCHAR$, POSITION, 1) ) - POSITION
Mid$(STRINGCHAR$, POSITION, 1) = Chr$( CHAR )

Erm, I'm no C expert but surely the above code is not legal? The C standard
doesn't say when the ++ happens, I assume you want it to happen after the
entire line and not inbetween accesses to *StringChar.


Feeling particularly pedantic this evening.

actually, knowing from experience, its not the cpu speed on the amiga that
slows things down, its the blitter/graphics transfer bandwidth. Hence,
things run at the same speed on an A1200/020 as with 060. True, they don't
need compiling... Anything that uses low computational power will be slowed
down by the gfx bandwidth. Have a look at any proggie that uses a lot of
graphics updating.

Of course it is legal.
If it had not been I would not have wrote it. lol ;-)

I am post-incrementing. I know exactly when the increment occurs.
After the entire line is processed and the new value has been
loaded into StringChar.
If you wanted to increment it before the value was pulled from
the variable you would use pre-increment ( ie. *++StringChar ).

This is of course off topic and I know the elders will surely make

Exactly, that only applies to *non* cpu intensive gfx routines. My map
routine, although uses hardware srolling, uses cpu driven Icon drawing, as well
as quite a bit of amos calulation, all requiring lots of CPU. I can assure you,
it doesn't have a hope in hell of being as fast on an 020 as an 060.

Try it and you'll see ;)

Awww, you should have just posted the decode code. Hehe. Next time use a

Never too late, good idea.
Admittedly my AMOS skills are a bit rusty with the Amiga still
in storage back in PA, but I think this routine will decode it:

Dim POSITION, CHAR$, SOURCESTRING$, STRINGCHAR$

SOURCESTRING$ = "IVWT?56_`a9`NZd\R@WYbeeF\iIqhM`LMgjvt/"
STRINGCHAR$ = ""

For POSITION = 1 To Len( SOURCESTRING$ )
CHAR$ = Mid$( SOURCESTRING$, POSITION, 1 )
CHAR$ = Chr$( Asc (CHAR$) - POSITION )
STRINGCHAR$ = STRINGCHAR$ + CHAR$
Next POSITION

Print STRINGCHAR$

Hello there!
I had a Techno Sound Sampler 2 for my Amiga at one time.
Yep, ordered the darn thing and when it arrived I discovered it would
not plug into the port in the back of my Amiga. Really sucked.
The damn plug was too small compared to the hole and the local
Radio Shack had no adaptor that would work. :(
Ah, but we are not here to discuss my problem, besides that was
years ago. lol!

So.... if I actually had such a thing hooked up to a computer I reckon
that by writing an extremely tight loop to grab values from the port, I
would be able to create a sound "image" (reproduction).

I imagine AMOS has its own commands to open and read from a port
but I would skip that and use a direct Peek (or perhaps Deek
depending on the width of the data being received) of the port address.

Sound sampling, like any realtime sampling, is pretty simple.
You basically just monitor the incoming data stream, pull values out as
fast as you can and store them linearly at another location.
The challenge is in the speed (frequency) of your sampling.
The faster you can grab a value and store it, the more samples you grab
within a certain period and time and the closer your sound "image" will
be to the original.

At a very basic level, the process could be as simple as:

Dim STORAGE

Reserve As Chip Work 11, 128*1024

For STORAGE = Start(11) To Start(11) + ( 128 * 1024 ) - 1
Poke STORAGE, Peek( PORTADDRESS )
Next STORAGE

What port are you plugging that thing into?

Anyway, I hope this helps ya. Tell us the port you are plugging that
thing into and someone can probably give you the hardware address
to monitor.

Happy sampling. :-)

if you could write me a code I would be very happy. I am okay at amos(done
it since 1994 on and off) but I never used deek, poke and shit like that
except on my old atari 800 xl. also I were trying to make a 3d room
I made the wireframe by command like draw,box and sin,cos and it would
rotate left and right but kill my machine would I tried to make it up and
down. do you know how to use amos 3d? as all the other amos people do not.
my main goal is to make a simple 3d world which consist of 3d rooms as I am

Need the address of the parallel port.
Maybe a dataflow control register too.
I am at work now, my Amiga is 1,000 miles away (stored in my old home

Mapping the Amiga which documents the hardware addresses.
When I go home tonight I will check on that address if no one else

Sounds cool.

At work?
I am working on applications development and database programming.
Doing mainly Oracle and SQL programming at the moment but since
I am the Lead Software Developer I am involved in all the projects
which means I also do some Visual Basic, Visual C++, and HTML stuff.

At home?
I occasionally do some C programming and use the Allegro library.
Nothing really major. Since I started working fulltime in programming
I do not have as much desire to program on my personal time.

Hello there!
I had a Techno Sound Sampler 2 for my Amiga at one time.
Yep, ordered the darn thing and when it arrived I discovered it would
not plug into the port in the back of my Amiga. Really sucked.
The damn plug was too small compared to the hole and the local
Radio Shack had no adaptor that would work. :(
Ah, but we are not here to discuss my problem, besides that was
years ago. lol!

So.... if I actually had such a thing hooked up to a computer I reckon
that by writing an extremely tight loop to grab values from the port, I
would be able to create a sound "image" (reproduction).

I imagine AMOS has its own commands to open and read from a port
but I would skip that and use a direct Peek (or perhaps Deek
depending on the width of the data being received) of the port address.

Sound sampling, like any realtime sampling, is pretty simple.
You basically just monitor the incoming data stream, pull values out as
fast as you can and store them linearly at another location.
The challenge is in the speed (frequency) of your sampling.
The faster you can grab a value and store it, the more samples you grab
within a certain period and time and the closer your sound "image" will
be to the original.

At a very basic level, the process could be as simple as:

Dim STORAGE

Reserve As Chip Work 11, 128*1024

For STORAGE = Start(11) To Start(11) + ( 128 * 1024 ) - 1
Poke STORAGE, Peek( PORTADDRESS )
Next STORAGE

What port are you plugging that thing into?

Anyway, I hope this helps ya. Tell us the port you are plugging that
thing into and someone can probably give you the hardware address
to monitor.

Happy sampling. :-)

Forget it, AMOS3D sucks big time. I started writing a platform puzzle game
with it, but gave up because it was crap, to be honest...


Also, I had a 'working' AMOS sampler program for a technosound sampling cartrage
:) (I believe this is what this thread /was/ about ;)

The sample you get from it sounds crappy (it's all destorted) but the
frequency's right (I'm proud of that bit :) and it is partly destinguisable.

It's based on the source code in the technosound manual :)


By the way, if anyone knows why it doesn't work propperly...? :)


See ya :)

As I had a few moments (and a touch of insomnia 8) I thought I would put
this to the test, and found it's really not that bad (IMO).

It's probably a bit late now, but I thought I would post my efforts anyway
in case anyone's interested (anyway, it's a bit too quiet on this list for

It does make use of peek$ & poke$, so you'll need amospro (or use a

I've been asking for stuff like this for a long time, I managed to get a small
very noisy sample recorded. To get high quality samples you need very accurate
delays, and assembly coding is the way to go, but I haven't managed it yet.

Good luck.

Not too tight, unless you think that sampling at 1 MHz is a good idea...
The sampler probably wouldn't be able to react that quickly to the signal
anyway, and the parallel port isn't that good is it?

Seems logical, would be getting bytes.

Not as fast as you can - you need to do it fast for high quality, but it is
more important to have a steady speed (otherwise you get frequency distortion).

Yep. 44.1 kHz is CD standard, 22.05 kHz is a good compromise, 16 kHz is useful
for general samples for music modules etc, speech is intelligible down to about
4 kHz (8kHz you can recognize different voices).

Stock = stick, besoffen = drunk, lieber = rather, als = than, dick = fat

Stock might mean something else too.

Sampling at 1 MHz?? I would like to see somone hit that in AMOS!!
Hahahahaha. Granted I had a 20 MHz 68020 so I am not sure
what a 50MHz 68060 is capable of but I am sure AMOS is not going
to hit 1MHz sampling rates on anything.... not that they would be
needed. Who in hell would need that kind of dataflow? Even in the
sampling we do for custom manufacturing environments, several thousand
samples per second is efficient. I am sure even the missile guidance
systems are operating within a similiar range.
Audio recognition/reproduction is one of the most demanding forms
of real time sampling.

The speed should not fluctuate, obviously a tiny amount in a multitaskng
environment but that should be the least of your worries.
If you are using AMOS you had better make a lean and mean, supertight
loop in order to come anywhere close to grabbing the quantity of samples
per second to result in a quality recording.
Certainly, do not add any intentional delays between the sampling!!!


>Yep. 44.1 kHz is CD standard, 22.05 kHz is a good compromise, 16 kHz is

>down to about 4 kHz (8kHz you can recognize different voices).

Yes.... and 12K is very nice overall.
That is 12,000 samples per second.
That means you need to pull 240 samples/PAL Vbl, 200 samples/NTSC Vbl.
The 16K would require 320 samples/PAL Vbl, 267 samples/NTSC Vbl.

As with you, I am not sure what the Amiga parallel port can handle in
terms of data transfer. I know it can handle scanning devices as I had a
handheld scanner which transmitted a lot of data very quickly.
The exact bandwidth I do not remember.

If you were writing this in C or Assembler then you could think about
delays and tweaking everything for perfection but using AMOS your first
priority is gonna be on speed. Make the loop as tight(=fast) as
possible.
Then, after you have achieved the sampling rates you are after, it is
time to focus on the smoothing, processing tasks.

Have a super day!!! :-)

THANKS!! I appreciate the response!! :-)

BTW - Your post on the sampling was cool too. I may simply
not be accurately remembering how fast/slow AMOS was.
I know I could get some great speed out of AMOS but several
hundreds of samples within one Vbl, I cannot remember if that is
realistic or not. When you develop in C for 400 MHz PC Systems
it is very difficult to remember what is possible in AMOS on a
14 MHz Amiga.
Hey, did I say 20MHz in my other message??
Yes I did.... wow!! that 68020 was only 14MHz!!!!

I haven't got it with me at uni, and it is in E/assembly not AMOS.
If you still need it in a month then mail me again.

Eh?

You can generate sin and cos waves through simple recurrence
formulae (like y(n+1) = a * y(n) + b * y(n-1), you just need
a and b... I have code somewhere too)

Realtime drawing - do you mean like an oscilloscope monitor?
I have no idea how to do this.

Should be pretty easy to make a functional oscilloscope in AMOS,
right? I mean all you need is a data stream to monitor.

Simply sample the data at the "in" port and then plot it on the screen
or connect the points from each frame to produce a better graph.

A simple oscilloscope could just (assuming a 640 pixel wide screen)
repeat this sequence....
Clear the screen
Sample data for 640 frames and plot the values on the screen

Happy sampling.

As far as I can just figure out you will have a lot of problems in converting
the very strange Amos-handling of data to c....

How will you handle i.e. data statements, labels and accesories (IMHO the only

Yes, I remember answering that question with a design of the process
involved and also the code.
Another guy then posted a follow-up to my message which had the code a
bit more
streamlined ( something I always like to see!! ).

Anyway, here we go:

If you have this map:

BDF
HJK
NPQ

And you rotated it clockwise 90 degrees, you would end up with:

NHB
PJD
QKF

As you can see.... all we are doing is remapping from horizontal to
vertical or
vice-versa, depending on how you are looking at it.

Basically, I see it as we are simply starting with the left column and
using that
as the source, we are starting with the top row and using that as the
destination.
Now we loop from left to right copying each column into the rows
(traveling from
top to bottom).

That is the whole theory in a nutshell.

I have no time as I am heading to a wrestling bash tonight and need to
leave
right now or I would post some code.

Happy rotating!!

How is the fastest way of rotating 2d points?

Let me put it another way:
Lets say you have two (or more) points on the screen,
and you want to rotate it lets say 30deegrees (by origo)?

x' = x * cos(angle) + y * sin(angle)
y' = x * -sin(angle) + y * cos(angle)


for lots of points store c = cos(angle) and s = sin(angle)


make sure you specify whether you are using degrees or radians
(default) - radians are quicker (degrees are converted to radians
before each calculation anyway)


if speed is crucial use lookup tables (as always...)

The fastest way of rotating a 2d point?

Hmm.... not sure. Let us all find out together.


Thanks to our good friend Claude for supplying the basic
formulas for rotation (which I would need to look up):
newxpos = oldxpos * cos(angle) + oldypos * sin(angle)
newypos = oldxpos * -sin(angle) + oldypos * cos(angle)

Okay, first thing we need to do is kill these cos(angle) and
sin(angle) tables.
We can create QCOS() and QSIN() precalculated data tables
(also known as Lookup Tables years ago, as Claude mentioned).

Just run a loop through the full range of rotation and
store the result of the Cos and Sin functions inside the data tables.
Dim QCOS#(360), QSIN#(360)
For ANGLE=0 To 359
QCOS#(ANGLE) = Cos(ANGLE)
QSIN#(ANGLE) = Sin(ANGLE)
Next ANGLE

Cannot quite remember how Amos defines floating point vars.
Might be #QCOS instead of QCOS# but at any rate you have AMOS
handsy so can find that out within a few seconds.

However, we are gonna kill that floating point nonsense anyway.
I have never found a need for floating point.
Integer math is much faster and can do anything floating point can.

Here is the integer version of the lookup tables:
Dim QCOS(360), QSIN(360)
For ANGLE=0 To 359
QCOS(ANGLE) = Cos(ANGLE) Asl 7
QSIN(ANGLE) = Sin(ANGLE) Asl 7
Next ANGLE

I am hoping that Asl is the AMOS version of the Assembler instruction
Asl Arithemetic Shift Left. Which is the fastest way to multiply by a
power of two. The result of the Cos and Sin functions is likely to be
something with a couple decimal places so ya can promote such a
number to a pure decimal by multiply it by 100.
Multiply is quite slow so instead we use Asl 7 which multiplies by 128
and is close enough to work perfectly anyway.

At this point the formulas for the rotation look like:
newxpos = (oldxpos * QCOS(angle) ) + ( oldypos * QSIN(angle) )
newypos = (oldxpos * -QSIN(angle) ) + (oldypos * QCOS(angle) )


Oh yeah we need to Shift back to the right by 7 to bring the value back
within the correct range too.

Also, those multiplies are gonna drain speed.... so someone else needs
to continue this quest to find the ultimate speed as I am leaving now.

Monday night wrestling is coming on soon and I still need to grab the
beer and pizza.


Good luck!!

It depends, in fact if you rotate points more often than you translate
them.
If rotation is the main thing, consider polar coordinates instead of
cartesian.
cartesian are : X pos, Y pos
polar are : Distance from center, Angle

Your display will be something like:
XD=XC+D(I)*Sin(A(I))
YD=YC+D(I)*Cos(A(I))

So if you want to rotate points just change all A(I) values and
everything will rotate.
If you want to woom-in zoom-out, just change all D(I) values...
If you want to translate ALL points, just change the center of screen
(XC and YC, i.e 320 and 100 for a 640x200 screen).
If you want to translate just some points, it's a little bit harder.

Hope this helps.

ME> ....someone else needs to continue this quest....

Wow, cool. Hey, I will see if I can contribute anything to this. :)

Hmm.... those multiplies need to go.
As always, ya need to look for patterns.
We have:
oldxpos * QCOS(angle)
and
oldypos * QCOS(angle)
both of which translate to:
somenumber * QCOS(angle)

What if we could expand on our earlier datatables and produce an
array which when fed with value, angle would return the newvalue?
Something like the following would then become possible:
NEWXPOS = POSBYCOS(OLDXPOS, ANGLE)
NEWYPOS = POSBYCOS(OLDYPOS, ANGLE)

Depending on how efficient AMOS deals with 2d arrays (obviously there
is multiplication involved internally to locate a cell within a 2d
array), this may provide no speed increase or a great speed increase.

Assuming the speed increase is significant we still need to consider the
table size.

The definition for ROTPOS is as follows:
POSBYCOS( 0....319, 0....359 ) lowres 320 pixel wide display.

This means we need 320 * 360 = 115,200 elements.
AMOS uses four bytes for each of these array elements, so total memory
required is 115,200 * 4 = 460,800 or 450k

We would also want to produce a table to update QSIN.
POSBYSIN( 0....318, 0....359 )

At this point, the rotation formulas are:
NEWXPOS = POSBYCOS(OLDXPOS, ANGLE) + POSBYSIN(OLDYPOS, ANGLE)
NEWYPOS = POSBYSIN(OLDXPOS, ANGLE) + POSBYCOS(OLDYPOS, ANGLE)


Let us discuss trade-offs.
We are looking at 900k for these two tables.
900k is a lot of RAM if you are using a 1MB machine so this is obviously
not workable. However, 900k is completely acceptable if the tables do
actually speed up the position calculations significantly.
One could say, hey, it is almost 2000. Get with the times, get some more
RAM. With a 4MB or higher machine 900k on these kind of data tables
is no problem.

However, you can also save some RAM by altering the table definitions.
Can you put up with rotation in 2 degree steps?
If you can then you have just saved 450k as the new table defs are:
POSBYCOS( 0....319, 0....179 ) and POSBYSIN( 0....319, 0....179 )
Just remember to use 0-179 in your system for rotation and all will be
fine.

If you can get by with rotation in four degree steps then you can drop
the RAM requirements even further, saving another 225k.
POSBYCOS( 0....319, 0....89 ) and POSBYSIN( 0....319, 0....89 )
Now, you would need to use 0-89 in your system for one complete rotation.
Still, 90 frames for one rotation is quite smooth!!
Both tables would now require 225k total.... workable even on a 1MB
machine.

It is time for me to get some actual work done, so I am sending this now.
Hope it provides some help.

We need to combine all of this stuff into an actual system at some point
but that will have to wait for another time or another person. :-)

Have a great day!!

ME> Both tables would now require 225k total....

One thing we also know is that we do not need the four bytes AMOS uses
for its variables. By focusing on this we can save memory and increase
speed.

By storing a 16-bit value instead of a 32-bit value for each element in
the POSBYXXX data tables, we can cut the memory requirements in half
again.

320 positions X 90 angles =
28,800 elements of data X 2 bytes each =
57,600 bytes
which is slightly over 56k.
Both tables will easily fit inside 113k.
Dim POSBYCOS, POSBYSIN
Reserve As Work 11, 57600 * 2
POSBYCOS = Start(11) : POSBYSIN = Start(11) + 57600

At this point, we would access en element using this formula:
VALUE = Deek( DPOSBYCOS + ( OLDXPOS * 180) + (ANGLE * 2) )

Two multiplies are in this formula so obviously we are not gonna use
that.

Now, we just saved a load of RAM.... 112.5K to be exact.
We can significantly increase the speed of the access to these
data tables if we are willing to sacrifice some of that RAM.

In the above formula, the ( OLDXPOS * 180) is finding the base address
of the Angles for each Position (90 possible angles X 2 bytes each).

If we were willing to throw away 76 bytes per Position (320 possible)
we would be losing only 24k.
We are now saying that we have 256 bytes of data for each of the 320
positions.
In reality, the last 76 bytes of each are unused (of course, you can
use them for something else if you need to).

The new formula for accessing the data table is:
VALUE = Deek( POSBYCOS + ( OLDXPOS * 256) + (ANGLE * 2) )

AHA!! Look at that 256 and 2. Both are values at a power of two!!!!
This means we can now completely eliminate all multiplication from our
forumulas and use something like this:
VALUE = Deek( POSBYCOS + ( OLDXPOS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) )
VALUE = Deek( POSBYSIN + ( OLDXPOS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) )

Again, I cannot remember the exact syntax of the AMOS Asl command but
I think you can see I we are shifting the value of OLDXPOS by 8 and
shifting the value of ANGLE by 1, in effect multiplying by 256 and 2
respectively.

I would dare say this new formula would be much faster than AMOS's
normal 2d array access.

Now, the full rotation formulas are:
XTC = Deek( POSBYCOS + ( OLDXPOS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) )
YTS = Deek( POSBYSIN + ( OLDYPOS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) )
NEWXPOS = XTC + YTS
XTS = -Deek( POSBYSIN + ( OLDXOS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) )
YTC = Deek( POSBYCOS + ( OLDYPOS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) )
NEWYPOS = XTS + YTC

I broke that all down to better illustrate how we are using the new
data tables but in practice you can eliminate the four intermediate
variable loading steps and simply load the result of the full formula
directly into
NEWXPOS and NEWYPOS:
NEWXPOS = Deek( POSBYCOS + ( OLDXPOS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) ) +
Deek( POSBYSIN + ( OLDYPOS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) )
NEWYPOS = -Deek( POSBYSIN + ( OLDXPOS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) ) +
Deek( POSBYCOS + ( OLDYPOS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) )

Compare that to the original forumulas:
newxpos = (oldxpos * Cos(angle) ) + ( oldypos * Sin(angle) )
newypos = (oldxpos * -Sin(angle) ) + (oldypos * Cos(angle) )

Of course, there might be a mistake in there someplace and I cannot
test this stuff at the moment, but assuming it is reasonably accurate
(which I think is safe to say) we have completely eliminated the four
multiplications and floating point math.
We now have very detailed, and highly simplified forumulas for
producing the new rotated positions.

Another benefit of breaking everything down like this is that it
allows us to easly convert the formulas to Assembler which of
course gives you the maximum speed.

Another great thing is that you can easily test this right now and see
if the new pure integer, bit-shifting forumulas are faster than the
original floating point, multiplying formulas.

I would be interested in testing this myself if I had my Amiga handy.
Again, I am pulling this all from the top of my head "on the fly" so
there is no way I can test this and guarantee it is perfect.
All I can say is that is SHOULD be. Very damn close at the very
least!

DIM POS, ANGLE, TIME1, TIME2
Dim POSBYCOS, POSBYSIN

Reserve As Work 11, 57600 * 2
POSBYCOS = Start(11)
POSBYSIN = Start(11) + 57600

Timer=0
For POS=0 To 319
For ANGLE=0 To 89
NEWXPOS = (POS * Cos(ANGLE) ) + ( POS * Sin(ANGLE) )
NEWYPOS = (POS * -Sin(ANGLE) ) + (POS * Cos(ANGLE) )
Next ANGLE
Next POS
TIME1=Timer

Timer=0
For POS=0 To 319
For ANGLE=0 To 89
NEWXPOS = Deek( POSBYCOS + ( POS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) ) +
Deek( POSBYSIN + ( POS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) )
NEWYPOS = -Deek( POSBYSIN + ( POS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) ) +
Deek( POSBYCOS + ( POS Asl 8) + (ANGLE Asl 1) )
Next ANGLE
Next POS
TIME2=Timer

Print "TIME1 = " + str$(TIME1)
Print "TIME2 = "+ str$(TIME2)

If all goes as planned, TIME2 will be much smaller than TIME1.



Good luck!!!!!!!

Hmm.... seems I missed this one until now. :-)

You could created a set of procedures and it should not be too bad....

int SetDataBuffer( unsigned int SIZEOFDATABUFFER );
Allocates space for the Data
Implementation.... just use calloc/malloc
Set the DataBuffer Base address to the start of the memory.
Initialize (unsigned int)DataReadPointer to 0
Initialize (unsigned int)DataWritePointer to 0

void Restore( char *DATALABEL );
Sets the DataBuffer base-offset to the location pointed to
by DATALABEL
Search the DATALABEL list, if the name is found then
Set the internal DataReadPointer equal to the associated
DATALABEL DataBuffer offset.

void Read( char* STRINGVARIABLENAME );
Reads the next item of data into STRINGVARIABLENAME
Implementation.... data is pulled from memory starting at
DataBuffer Base + DataReadPointer, as the data is pulled
in, the DataReadPointer is incremented. This continues until
the special dataitem termination characters are read.

void LabelData( char *DATALABEL );
Adds a label reference to the beginning of a section of data
Implementation.... Store the DATALABEL in a list along with
the current value held in DataWritePointer

void Data( char *DATASTRING );
Adds dataitems to the databuffer.
Implementation.... DATASTRING is parsed, dataitems are
seperated by a single comma (",").
As each dataitem is located it is inserted into the DataBuffer
where each dataitem will be terminated with some character
combination we choose.
As each dataitem is added to the DataBuffer the DataWritePointer
is updated ( incremented by length of DataItem + terminators ).

Which in practice could be used like this:
int dataitemnumber;
char dataitem[80];

if ( SetDataBuffer( 5 * 1024) ) {
LabelData( "DATAONE" );
Data( "This is a string, 5, That was a number." );

Restore( "DATAONE" );
for ( dataitemnumber=0; dataitemnumber < 3; dataitemnumber++ ) {
Read( dataitem );
printf( "%s\n", dataitem );
}

}
===========

Granted it is not as straight-forward as AMOS/BASIC data statements
but considering I just threw this simple design together in ten
minutes, I am sure if someone actually focused on this problem for
a few days they could come up with an excellent solution.

May your data always be free of corruption.

Thanks for helping me on that 3D room code!

ME> ....someone else needs to continue this quest....

Wow, cool. Hey, I will see if I can contribute anything to this. :)

Hmm.... those multiplies need to go.
As always, ya need to look for patterns.
We have:
oldxpos * QCOS(angle)
and
oldypos * QCOS(angle)
both of which translate to:
somenumber * QCOS(angle)

What if we could expand on our earlier datatables and produce an
array which when fed with value, angle would return the newvalue?
Something like the following would then become possible:
NEWXPOS = POSBYCOS(OLDXPOS, ANGLE)
NEWYPOS = POSBYCOS(OLDYPOS, ANGLE)

Depending on how efficient AMOS deals with 2d arrays (obviously there
is multiplication involved internally to locate a cell within a 2d
array), this may provide no speed increase or a great speed increase.

Assuming the speed increase is significant we still need to consider the
table size.

The definition for ROTPOS is as follows:
POSBYCOS( 0....319, 0....359 ) lowres 320 pixel wide display.

This means we need 320 * 360 = 115,200 elements.
AMOS uses four bytes for each of these array elements, so total memory
required is 115,200 * 4 = 460,800 or 450k

We would also want to produce a table to update QSIN.
POSBYSIN( 0....318, 0....359 )

At this point, the rotation formulas are:
NEWXPOS = POSBYCOS(OLDXPOS, ANGLE) + POSBYSIN(OLDYPOS, ANGLE)
NEWYPOS = POSBYSIN(OLDXPOS, ANGLE) + POSBYCOS(OLDYPOS, ANGLE)


Let us discuss trade-offs.
We are looking at 900k for these two tables.
900k is a lot of RAM if you are using a 1MB machine so this is obviously
not workable. However, 900k is completely acceptable if the tables do
actually speed up the position calculations significantly.
One could say, hey, it is almost 2000. Get with the times, get some more
RAM. With a 4MB or higher machine 900k on these kind of data tables
is no problem.

However, you can also save some RAM by altering the table definitions.
Can you put up with rotation in 2 degree steps?
If you can then you have just saved 450k as the new table defs are:
POSBYCOS( 0....319, 0....179 ) and POSBYSIN( 0....319, 0....179 )
Just remember to use 0-179 in your system for rotation and all will be
fine.

If you can get by with rotation in four degree steps then you can drop
the RAM requirements even further, saving another 225k.
POSBYCOS( 0....319, 0....89 ) and POSBYSIN( 0....319, 0....89 )
Now, you would need to use 0-89 in your system for one complete rotation.
Still, 90 frames for one rotation is quite smooth!!
Both tables would now require 225k total.... workable even on a 1MB
machine.

It is time for me to get some actual work done, so I am sending this now.
Hope it provides some help.

We need to combine all of this stuff into an actual system at some point
but that will have to wait for another time or another person. :-)

Have a great day!!

Well, yeah, that way you could implement "simple" data statements and labels
to them.
(Uh,oh, long time no C... Damn, It's all fuzzy to me...)

But we still need the "goto" and "gosub" labels...
(Don't say that procs can be used instead. That's not always the case. I.e.
if you have to refer to a label in the main program then it's not a good
idea to be located in a proc):
And... As I said - only simple use is supported in your (I know, quick)
c-implementation.
I.e. you can goto/gosub an expression, like this:

Do
G$=Inkey$
Trap Gosub "LABEL_"+G$
Loop
LABEL_A: Print "you tammed the A-key" : Return
LABEL_1: Print "One for the money,"
LABEL_2: Print "Two for the show,"
LABEL_3: Print "Three to get ready now, go cat go..." : Return

etc...
(Well, I find this a brilliant replacement for the missing "Switch" statement,
and it actually works...!)

In AMOS it is also actually legal to put any expression (not just simple
types) in data statements:

Restore _PATH
_PATH$=""
While not Exist(_PATH$+_FILE$)
read _PATH$
Wend
Open In 1,PATH$+_FILE$
..
_PATH:
Data "S:"
Data "C:"
Data "Work:AMOS/files/"
Data Fsel$("Can't locate file, please specify dir!","(Do NOT select the file)")


(yeah, a fileselector in a data statement. Everytime the thing is read, a
fileselector pops up :) )

(Off course, this was typed on an O2 at the university, probably with loadz
of typoz)

Well, what I was getting at was you could build a system that would
do anything that AMOS does.
If Lionet did it for AMOS then you can do it for C/C++.
Just need to find a way to interpret the whole thing.
That is why I had the idea of placing the data into a string.
The battle we are facing is that he had the luxury of dealing with an
interpreter (and building his own compiler) when he made AMOS
and C is a strongly typed, compiled language.
Hmm.... I guess that is the key.... use a preprocessor....??

AMOS Next Generation

Thu Nov 11, 1999 9:39 pm
"GarfieldAtWork" <garfield@dtgrp.com>


Ya know.... if people really wanted a Next Generation AMOS....
it should not be that difficult to create.

Obviously, it would take time to implement the thousand commands
found in AMOS Pro + the most popular extensions but a basic, usable
version could be created in reasonably short period of time.

If such a thing were created, I think it should be platform independant
and renamed to something like NGB: The 21st Century BASIC.

When you really think about it, taken a command at a time, each task
is pretty damn simple.

Using C or C++ the code would be almost fully portable if created the
right way (ie. all audio/video operations channeled through a seperate,
platform specific, audio/video library(ies).

Since these libraries already exist for every platform out there.... well,
I am sure you can see the point.

Anyway, it is kind of exciting to think about such a project, in fact I
think Keith (aka Braneloc) should get started on this right away.
Hahahahaha. :)

Of course, what I mean is we pass them through one central
library which will initially contain skeleton code and not do much of
anything.

However, each audio/video function can be implemented by using
libraries found each platform.

For example:
PlotPixel( int Bitmap, int xpos, int ypos, int color)
Is what we call from the main program code when the programmer is
wanting to plot a pixel.
On the Amiga, PlotPixel may in turn call the GMS PixelPlot routine,
on the PC it may call DirectX or WinAllegro pixelplot, etc.

Yes, it would place another layer between command and actual
implementation but it would not make that much difference and the
ease of portability would be well worth it.

Besides, this will make Keith's job easier! lol.

The problem is nobody really wants to commit alot of time to this kind
of project.... apparently.

I would be willing to devote 4-5 hours per month, some months less,
some months more.

If we had a list of all the most used commands and if we had around
ten great C programmers who were willing to create 4-5 commands
per month and if well, I guess that is all ya need to get started.

Of course, getting those programmer resources is the hard part, but
if.... just IF ya did get them and IF together they really did produce
40-50 functions per month.... well, it would still take a hell of a
long time to create a thousand commands but at least it would be a
rate that would show dramatic progress each month.

Actually, if someone is prepared to do a lot of command conversion and
continue the project after I'm done with it, I might be prepared to write an
interpretive/compilable kernal, if I get enough convincing.

NGB: 21st Century Basic - DOES ANYONE WANT IT?

Hello all.

Well, Keith and I have been talking about this project.

We were wondering if there is really anyone interested in a new
language similiar to AMOS but upgraded.

The main idea is that this language will be completely platform
independant. If your program works on the AMIGA it will work
on the PC and MAC with no changes at all.

In order to accmplish this task we will use a simple bitmap
graphics and raw sound format. Do not worry, compression will
be an option or perhaps standard!!

It will also use a custom audio-video library which pipes everything
out to the individual platform audio-video libraries currently avalable.
I have already mentioned this in a previous post.

The thing is.... is anyone interested in using such a language?????


If you give a hoot about this please say so!!

Will it have 2 and a half D software bobs (bobs that rotate and scale)?

Will it have true 3D, and a good 3D modeler, and maper?

Will it have software multi-transparent screens ((screens that let sub
screens show through color 0 (color 0 is transparent or noncolor black
would need to be another number))?

Will it support all screen modes, and colors modes ((2, 256, 1.6 million)
(320x200, 640x480, 1024x576 etc...)?

I use AMOS because it is easy to use and pretty powerful. If you can make me a

EH>Will it have 2 and a half D software bobs (bobs that rotate and scale)?

No problem.... we can stick that stuff in.
I would not take it serious if it did not have these kinds of things!


EH>And a good 2D modeler, and maper?

Not sure what you mean by a 2d modeler and mapper?


>Will it have true 3D, and a good 3D modeler, and maper?

It can have these things.... if we find a good library which already
has these features. :-)
That is the beauty of this design. We are creating a core language
which can tap into all of the best C/Asm libraries floating around
out there.

Worse case scenario is that I dig out my 3d game programming
book and consult with Adam Parrot. In other words we make our
own super fast 3d lib in C.


>Will it have software multi-transparent screens ((screens that let sub
>screens show through color 0 (color 0 is transparent or noncolor black
>would need to be another number))?

On the PC this would be easy..... simply because things like WinAllegro
support this and we only need to call their functions.

Some of these things are just not possible on a standard Amiga.
Sure we could code it in, hell we can make anything but the problem
is how can we possibly dynamically update an entire bitmap fast
enough for realtime framerates? I will give it my best shot but unless
you have a graphics card you will be looking at AGA dual playfield
mode which gives you 6 + 16 colors in each screen.


>Will it support all screen modes, and colors modes ((2, 256, 1.6 million)
>(320x200, 640x480, 1024x576 etc...)?

It will support all of the modes you have mentioned, at least not color
depths.

We are planning on offering the following:
SCREEN MODE 0: 320 x 200 x 8 bit color
SCREEN MODE 1: 320 x 200 x 16 bit color
SCREEN MODE 2: 640 x 400 x 8 bit color
SCREEN MODE 3: 640 x 400 x 16 bit color
SCREEN MODE 4: 640 x 480 x 8 bit color
SCREEN MODE 5: 640 x 480 x 16 bit color
SCREEN MODE 6: 800 x 600 x 8 bit color
SCREEN MODE 7: 800 x 600 x 16 bit color
SCREEN MODE 8: 1024 x 768 x 8 bit color
SCREEN MODE 9: 1024 x 768 x 16 bit color
EXTENDED MODES:
SCREEN MODE 10: 320 x 200 x 32 colors
SCREEN MODE 11: 320 x 200 x 64 colors
SCREEN MODE 12: 640 x 400 x 32 colors
SCREEN MODE 13: 640 x 400 x 64 colors
SCREEN MODE 14: 640 x 480 x 32 colors
SCREEN MODE 15: 640 x 480 x 64 colors

Obviously, the extended modes are really only of value to Amiga
programmers and on the PC and MAC these will be mapped to
8-bit color displays.

Basically, the whole system is you ask for one of these screen modes
and you get the closest thing available on the other platforms.
To you, it is seamless and does not effect anything.


All of these things can be implemented in time.... if you are asking if
everything you have mentioned will be available within two months the
answer is no. However, given time all things are possible and even
likely.

People should know my main concern is always on FAST, COMPACT
code. It is what I do best. Keith and I have already discussed the
basic design which would offer the maximum speed while
allowing us to create incredibly compact executables.

There is no doubt that Keith and I CAN do it, the question is WILL

The more people that are honestly interested in such a project
and the more Keith hears of money will certainly push BNG one
step closer to reality. :-)

There is no doubt that Keith and I CAN do it, the question is WILL
we do it?? Man, I feel like I am having Deja Vu. Hahahaha. ;)

If we decide to do this project.... you can help in one of three ways.
ONE: $$$ motivate Keith. I can ask him to work on the project for
the fun and challenge of it and he may contribute some time.
You can send keith $5(or pounds) and he will contribute time.
Hmm.... how many people are on this list? Hahahahaha.
TWO: Research. You can perform resource availability research.
THREE: Testing and feedback.
FOUR: Example programs. You can create some of the BNG example
programs which would come "packaged" with the language.

Please note that IF we do this project and you want to contribute
Testing&feedback or writing example programs, we may require you
to send a letter of intent which simply states you will not send the
stuff out to anyone else without our approval.
Ultimately, I have no problem with sharing the information but we
would not want the project being spread around in bits and pieces
the whole time we are working on it.

Well, I think we have enough interest at this point to go ahead and
start on a simple prototype. From what we had discussed, Keith
will be handling the parsing and I will handle the code generation.

Obviously, we will not be implementing anything major at this time.
Just a test of some of the concepts we have thrown around.
I would say we will end up with a simple compiler which can handle
integer variables, for.... next loops, maybe the ability to add
variables/values, and I guess we would need to stick in some type
of print command.

That should be enough to test some concepts, solidify a development
strategy and of course the best part is that we will have proof of the
compact, speed code we are convinced our design will produce.

I will talk to Keith about this and ideally we have something working
no later than tomorrow. It's gonna be FAST!! Hahahahaha. :-)

Ofcource I want it.

BUT, Is it likely to be finnished while I live?

i would be happy to devote some alpha&betatesting when and if the project
come so far. but I have seen these projects come and go so often that i am
a little worried.

But count me in, I would like to see a "easy to program over the

A new Amos-generation would be great!!!

having being an AMOS programmer for eons, i found it an extremely usefull
language for learning program & structure on, as well as making some small
& powerfull utilities pretty quickly. I very rarely use AMOS any more to
code in, mainly because im concentrating fully on C and C++.

Ive been using SAS/C, and a lot of the commands in AMOS can very easily be
done. Im also coding in C++ on the PC, and from an AMOS users perspective,
feel that there is no need to make a PC version of the language, because
DirectX is generally the same thing. Ive been spending the last few weeks
writing directx code which emulates simple AMOS functions, for example:

Create_Full_Screen(640,480,8); // Opens a screen 640x480 8bit 256 colours

whats more, if i called it again with different parameters, it would change
the screen automatically. Its great for game coding, once you create the
procedures.

I know what you mean. I am also no longer programming in AMOS.... I
do not even have my Amiga handy at the moment.

Well, ya know I have been saying this for months (years?). Hahahahaha.
It is not only DirectX but WinAllegro too. Rotation, scaling of images
in
realtime. On the Amiga I also used SAS/C along with Gamesmith and
tried GMS a few times too but found it to be so buggy at that time to be
virtually useless.

I used to wonder why people were always talking about a new version of
AMOS when like you say, there are loads of libraries available for C
which handle all of the audio-video for you.

It just hit me this past week that these people simply have no desire to
learn C. They are comfortable with BASIC, like the idea that everything
you need is built-in (more or less) and simply want to have that same
type of development environment only upgraded to the next level.
Kind of like that old Nintendo slogan, "now you're playign with power"
I guess.

Since you are a skilled C programmer and also have experience on
both the Amiga and PC perhaps you would be interested in working
on such a project???

Yes, I have noticed this over the past several years that I have been on
this list. Very strange. I imagine what happens is that people start
work on such a project and discover they like C + libraries as much or
possibly more so see no point in continuing.

I used to see it that way.... I am a C nut..... think it is a fantastic
language and the oo support in C++ are very cool too!!

However, I have kind of come full circle now and since I have already
been coding games and utilities and loads of miscellaneous odds and
ends in C for the past four years or so, the excitement and "magic" has
worn off.

To me C is like BASIC like Assembler, etc. All basically the same.
However, the idea of creating a new language based on AMOS
but completely platform independant.... the idea of giving all current
AMOS programmers the ability to easily tap into the PC and (maybe)
MAC markets (I do not know any MAC programmers at this time).....
the idea of surpassing Francois Lionet (some say I am arrogant, I say
I am confident).... the idea of offering a new language for an entirely
new generation of programmers to use and master as they develop
their skills.... well, I almost kinda like these ideas!! :)


>But count me in, I would like to see a "easy to program over the

A very interesting observation!! You would be amazed at how true

Hehe, i use my PC more and more nowadays, but still like to putter around

Never tried GMS, i poked a little into how it worked, but thats about all.
I do like the DirectX stuff, and it runs very nicely, so all of my gaming
efforts will be used with it, apart from thiose i bring over to Amiga.

Im probably stepping on people toes when I say "Get out of basic". Think
about it, if a new highly advanced language was created, people would still
have to learn it. With power, there is always going to be millions more
options, parameters etc. It won't be BASIC like it is now, it will be a
close form of C, especially for it to be portable.

Some functions would be the same, however, if you simplified a hell of a
lot of them like in AMOS right now, imagine the slow-down you'll get,
mainly because everything in an option would be turned on, rather than
specifying bits you wanted. It would result in thousands of lines of
repeated code, just to change a simple parameter, if you worked around it
with procedures.

I say the way to go, is tyo create a massive collection of
graphics/sound/video structures in C, that way, anyone can download and use
them.

If i can jump directly from AMOS and learn SAS/C in less than 2 weeks, im
sure a lot more people out there could do it.

It's interesting, but im still fairly new at it, only created one or two
tiny games, both of which were crap.

I hear ya and can understand completely what you are saying.
In fact I think that is what Keith and I are looking at.
A kind of bridge between AMOS and C.
It will be very BASIC like (of course, I think C is already very BASIC
like) but much faster than AMOS or BLITZ ever dreamed of being.

Keith and I have designed a system that will produce incredibly fast
and compact code.

I agree with this as it is exacly the kind of thing I was doing.
Trying to build up a library of routines. BNG will do the same thing, in
fact it is a big reason why we think this project is gonna be fairly easy
(although very time consuming).

I think you are right.... alot of people could do it, I am not sure of
how many could do it within two weeks. You need to consider the fact
that you were one of the best programmers to begin with.... I mean you
had a lot of programmng experience to build on. Once you are at that
level I agree.... BASIC, C, ASM, whatever the language is.... all are
more or less the same in the end. However, it takes time to get to the
point where everything clicks and you can truly see it that way.

We will just have to see what happens in the coming weeks.... I can
understand completely where you are coming from and then I can also
remember a time when I wanted to have something like a turbo charged
version of AMOS. Guess it all depends on how much work Keith does.
Hahahahaha.

The prob I always had was there was never any language I was fully happy
with. Some things in every language are just plain annoying. Amos is good
for some things but not others, blitz can't do this or that, other languages
are just plain irritating.. Nothing really allows rapid development better
than amos, but....

Hehe, I've seen the first prototypes running now... The system works, and
we are racing to complete it.

Hehe, I see a pattern forming.. While this is still fun, work will get
done.. Seriously, this project is quite achievable, if we can just stay
interested long enough... The more pledges for support we get, the more
interested we get, and the more work gets done.

A bit of info, Garfield and I have both studied a whole heck of a lot of
stuff, including compilers, and both of us have even messed with this kind
of thing before...

Oh yeah, and while we know exactly what we want from a language -
"everything" - what is the minimum people will be interested in ?

Perhaps a system that allows (nearly) unlimited extensions and an open code
system that allows easy insertion of new "libraries" for multiple platforms
? One that allows the code to be run directly on peecee and amiga ? One
that is actually quite quick ? Perhaps something that doesn't desperately
need mucking around with assembler ?

I'm not sure<cough>.... what do you lot think ?

I have a small question in the middle of all this enthousiasm:)

Won't this new language be a "powerful amos for pc" with very crappy amiga
port?

It seems to me like most of the things you're going to include and the speed
they need to work at is coined for the PC (or other "brute force" and/or
chunky gfx platforms)...

Ofcourse if ever a real brute-force amiga comes along and takes over as
standard it might be useful, but it'd just be too frustrating for most people
to have options that are far too slow to use...
And hows is easy plane manipulation possible when it's heavily based in
chunkyness or portability...

And why are there no PAL modes in the plans? It's fine that 200 and scanlines
are most "portable" to vga-type systems, but do you want people to have a 56
line black border under their monitors or do you assume all amiga users live
in the us?

Maybe I'm just being pessimistic right now, but this just reminds me of the
A/Box "amiga!" "maybe amiga" "amiga-ish" "different" rolling specs back in the
days:)


Good luck with it tho...

2D modeler is the amos bob editor(I'd like it to be more like DPaint).

The maper is like TOME (which I have not use). As I understand it you paste
tiles around with a mouse save the map then use the amos tome commands to
move the map around. I think it's suppose to rotate and scale the map to.

I think you should call it Amos 3D BASIC. I think most people think AMOS
is a name.

I think I would buy it. Their would be PC, Mac, Amiga 68k, Amiga PPC, and
Phoenix versions right?

I thought there was an AMOS NG coming, has that crashed and burned?

Of course a new language with the same ease and power as AMOS would be
wanted. As far as I know AMOS sold very well. I'm surprised no ones already done
something similar for the PC.
For me AMOS was the number one thing I used my Amiga for. I bought
Blitz because I thought it was going to be a modern version of AMOS, (didnt
like it).
I would definitely buy something that gave me the same amount of pleasure
that AMOS did.

BTW A good manual is VITAL. Basic is for beginners as well remember. The
reasonably good AMOS manual was very important to me.

I see no problem with that :) (Well, I do have a PPC amiga, but still, an
040/060 should do a fair job at it...)

We really shouldn't tie this new kinda amos like thing with the restraints of
using old custom code for the older amigas.

Anyway, as for this idea, well, I can't contribute to the coding, but (/if/)
it ever does get finished, I could write some example progs for it ;) Sounds
like a good enough idea :)

(Actually, Peter Cahill's already started something like this, maybe we should
talk to him?)

Letsee..

Perhaps it would be nice to run the same thing on both machines.. Or
perhaps those who want to develop on the amiga to develop on the amiga and
magically have a peecee version. Or vice versa. Since we are working in
parallel with both machines..

You want a manual too ? Good grief, you guys are never satisfied !!
Actually, the command structure we are using on the prototype version -
well, you'll pick it up very quickly. Manual and more information will
probably be more forthcoming when things become more advanced.

How about just using graphics.library (and layers.library) as the target
library, like DirectX on PC or whatever. That would guarantee good performance
on most Amiga's, and compatability with AGA automatically. And would need
less coding. If the OS is there, then use it.

Again, no problem. I created a Map Editor in a few days time when I was

EnemyMotionDesigner utility in a few days time.
Just make a list of the ones you want, also keep in mind that Keith and I

Currently, there are Amiga and PC versions in parallel development.
MAC version will be forthcoming as soon as I locate an exeptional MAC
programmer. As far as Amiga PPC, that is a simple matter of

Who? Amos Development Group?? Oh, you mean Keith and I.
Hahahaha. We are currently dabbling with the idea of developing
a powerful new BASIC programming language similiar to AMOS,
however BNG would not be a simple upgraded AMOS, rather we hope
to create a language as exciting now as AMOS was when it first
came out.


>Yes, I would be interested in it, but I'm afraid I would not be of

>You could base it on Java, and thus get help from Pietro...

No problem. I am not sure of the connection between Pietro and Java
but as I have mentioned in a previous post.... BNG does indeed
borrow from the JAVA model. :-)
Whether there is another language being developed or not is really
no concern to us. Personally, I have my doubts as these things have
been announced several times on this and I have never seen any
actual files, test results, etc. Keith and I have a combined amount
of 40 years of programming experience during which time we have
both created our own languages, compilers, parsers, etc.
The difference with BNG is that if we decide their is enough interest
and we choose to commit to the project.... it will be done.
If another group do actually produce an upgraded AMOS that is
great as it simply means you will have more options to choose from.

Yup.

If the manual had been better I might have got off the ground. It seemed to
me Blitz was aimed at a much more advanced programmer than me, maybe
someone who already knew C, so what was the point ? My AMOS programming usually
started with an iff bitmap
then I would work out how to get objects moving across it. The Blitz manual just
didnt seem to speak that sort of language.
This is why I mentioned the manual for BNG. AMOS has a good appeal to
complete beginners. I'll never forget the excitement of putting together
home made pictures with home made samples and writing a small bit of code to
make magic happen for my kids. I really miss that pleasure. Surely if there isnt
already
anything like AMOS for the PC, (I can hardly believe there isnt) there really
MUST be a market for it.

>I have a small question in the middle of all this enthousiasm:)

It will be a new BASIC type of language. We are obviously, modeling it
after all of the stuff we liked about AMOS while also copying the best
features of other languages to get away from the weaknesses of AMOS.

The language is being developed in parallel on the PC and Amiga at the
moment. Since yesterday, we have a working compiled example program
(very simple: around 8 commands have been implemented at this time)
which is fast as hell and incredibly small (193 bytes).


>It seems to me like most of the things you're going to include and the
>speed they need to work at is coined for the PC (or other "brute force"
>and/or chunky gfx platforms)...

That is very true in a sense. Obviously, the more power you have
available on the main CPU the more capable any language becomes.
For the Amiga, BNG will allow you to everything that AMOS does and
then a bit more. It will also do it much faster and require much less
RAM.


>And hows is easy plane manipulation possible when it's heavily based in
>chunkyness or portability...

I will only say that a command or two or three can be stuck in for
anything like this. Remember, the whole system is that we are relying
on existing Audio/Video libraries. Gamesmith for example offers
manipulation of the bitplanes. GMS is another option.


>And why are there no PAL modes in the plans? It's fine that 200 and
>scanlines are most "portable" to vga-type systems, but do you want people

I did not include PAL modes because I am an NTSC user, living in the US.
Hahahaha!! :)

Sure we can add these to the Extended modes section.
On the PC, they will be mapped to ModeX displays or more likely centered
in a standard NTSC size display which means you would lose the border.
Hmm.... or possibly, I can scale them in realtime.

We obviously have not had time to test every single thing.
We had a concept.
We created a design.
We implemented a test of the design.
It works.

Anything like the points you have mentioned can be handled. I am not
worried about these issues at all. There are always options such as the
three I have already thought of the PAL to PC display mapping.

Work continues on the GUI extension at least. I have an update from about 2
weeks ago from Pietro. I have tested thoroughly the new iconify and uniconify
commands. They work as advertised. Imagine that, icons on workbench from an
amos program. Neither Pietro or I are devoting full time hours to this, as
real life gets in the way. The docs are coming along slowly. The gui commands
are getting to be more streamlined and have more high end user functions
added.

One thing I keep hearing from people who want to program is that it's
too difficult for a starter to learn C, with pointers, structures,
etc, so if you can make it quite easy to manage for beginners, but
still able to do powerful things, it would really be a winner ;-)

Very valid points. BLITZ was an interesting language which had
a lot of things I liked, mainly the greater control it gave you but
even I agree there was a definite difference between AMOS and
BLITZ.... something was missing.

I think it was the fact that BLITZ required more study and work
on the part of the programmer to produce something. The beauty
of AMOS is that it allows a beginner to sit down and literally
within 15 minutes they can have bobs flying around the screen,
collision detection implemented, etc.

Great point! If we go to the effort and time to create a new
language we want it to be something that takes full advantage
of modern machines. If people want languages for older
Amiga configurations they can use AMOS. It was made for
such machines. Problem is the current AMOS tied to the
Amiga's custom chipset actually holds back more powerful machines.
(I am speaking of 68030 CPUs and above). That is not to say that
BNG would not be usable on a 68020. Of course it would with
damn nice results too. :)

Hahahaha.... well, please remember the project is still in consideration
phase and we only have around two days of actual design and development
into BNG. It is progressing at warp speed but it will take a little
while longer before we have something tangible to show.... unless anyone
is interested in seeing the current example code execute on a PC.
It is a simple nested loop three levels deep, adding vars together and
incrementing another variable and displaying the values on the screen for
the duration of the loops. The compiled code is 193 bytes in size.
It is about 95% the speed of optimized C code. It is FAST!!
As soon as Keith installs the C kit on his Amiga or I get a decent cross
compilation system installed (working on it just takes time and it has
been a busy weekend.... replying to these emails, hahahaha) we will
have the Amiga version ready to test. Actutally, I think Keith may have
an emulator working but it would be much slower than the real thing.

Yes, that's it!! You are right!! That is what we need to capture in
BNG. I have completed entire games in AMOS (AMINET: ss2000.lha
and tsmash.lha) in nine days or less.... sure these were very simple
games but the reason I am mentioning them is that I would like to have a
language which I can use to develop similiar small projects within 3-4
days. By contrast, I spent I believe almost a month on my first BLITZ
game (AMINET: tinvaders.lha ). Definitely a difference.

So, ease of use.... maximum results for minimum time and effort
would be a top priority in any language we may develop.

AMOSPro, AmoNG & BNG :)

Sun Nov 14, 1999 10:13 pm
Pietro Ghizzoni <ghizzo@agonet.it>


Hi!

Ok... since there are some intersting posting around the list, is time to
reply :)

First some infos about the new AMOSPro distribution... it's called AMOSPro
Phoenix, and it's structure is ready. Now the whole AMOS system is hold in
only one directory.. no more libs and config files around your HD... i've
removed
where possible the craps in the code and deleted all the unuseful stuff.

As stated i've not worked on the original sources since it's not very
usefull.. they are a mere pile of shit... the upgrade is represented by our
new extensions and all the features added.... they replace most of the AMOS
stuffs with the equivalent OS friendly result. Don't worry.. same design...
same style... easy as always. Before someone ask... no Intuition/AGA Bobs at the
moment...
first i need to create a full RTG system, then i will be able to quickly
add the Bobs support.

Finally now i've a serious system with PPC board and Gfx Card so i can
develop a more compatible kernel for my extension.

I'm again working on the GUI Extension... Rev. Giark is working on the
docs... essentially this is the only missing part of the project.... but
it's the more important. Probably i'll release soon my second project..
it's called AmiGate, and it's the first AMOSPro Phoenix project. You'll
have a idea of the new features like localization, app windows and appicons,
fast
internet connection (i've totally rewrote the old system) and a totally OS
integration.When?

AmiGate in 2 weeks.... AMOSPro Phoenix 25 December :) (Rev. Giark??)

Probably a lot of peoples doesn't belive any more in my work, and i can
understand..... i'm sorry but the time is the main problem, and i'm the
only one working on this project.

Now few words about the AmosNG project... Brice Fromentin is the author,
but he is vanished in the limbo with all the project.

I don't know the BNG design, but i can give you a idea of the AmosNG one.

Since the main goal is the portability, the AmosNG compiler works like a
C++ compiler, but in a higher way :)

For those who doesn't know how a C compiler works:

the C compiler translate your C source into ASM source, and after using a
internal or
external assembler the executable will be created from the ASM sources.

The AmosNG compiler translate your code into C++ code and after using
automatically the GNU C++ or EGGS compiler the executable will be
created. Since the GNU C++ compiler is available (for FREE) on ALL the
platforms, you can port your programs on ALL the OS of this world.

The extesions are simple C linkable libraries.....

I really hope that the BNG project became a reality... but i'm worried
about some things.... the language is interpreted or compiled?

If compiled, what kind of debugger can we use? And what about the PC and
Amiga CPU code generation?

At the moment the bobs, directX, 3D blah, blah, blah are NOT important!
First we need a working compiler able to clue together the basic statements
of the language like For/Next, If EndIF, A=(5*B)+4-Z and so on.

Keith... if you are really able to do it (able to do it means also to have
the *time* to do it!!) well... good luck! No time for coding, but i will be
very happy to help you in the desgin of the language.

A portable AMOS-like language is the only reasonable solution for the
future... i'm working with Java and i've some AMOS<->Java ideas....

The problem I had with blitz was there were too many graphics systems, none
were well documented, the support for other stuff required too much
knowledge of amiga, and the really sucky bit apart from the editor: Lack of
forward declaration of functions, and you had to write code in order.
Eeeew. I stuck with it for as long as I could bear, but it was too nasty.

Sounds good. Will their be data .bnk's so we don't have to peek/poke game
save variables?

And will we be able to make multi-tasking programs, so a star chart, and
a data base can be seprate active programs from the main game passing data
back, and forth?

No problem.... we can stick that stuff in.
I would not take it serious if it did not have these kinds of things!


EH>And a good 2D modeler, and maper?

Not sure what you mean by a 2d modeler and mapper?


>Will it have true 3D, and a good 3D modeler, and maper?

It can have these things.... if we find a good library which already
has these features. :-)
That is the beauty of this design. We are creating a core language
which can tap into all of the best C/Asm libraries floating around
out there.

Worse case scenario is that I dig out my 3d game programming
book and consult with Adam Parrot. In other words we make our
own super fast 3d lib in C.


>Will it have software multi-transparent screens ((screens that let sub
>screens show through color 0 (color 0 is transparent or noncolor black
>would need to be another number))?

On the PC this would be easy..... simply because things like WinAllegro
support this and we only need to call their functions.

Some of these things are just not possible on a standard Amiga.
Sure we could code it in, hell we can make anything but the problem
is how can we possibly dynamically update an entire bitmap fast
enough for realtime framerates? I will give it my best shot but unless
you have a graphics card you will be looking at AGA dual playfield
mode which gives you 6 + 16 colors in each screen.


>Will it support all screen modes, and colors modes ((2, 256, 1.6 million)
>(320x200, 640x480, 1024x576 etc...)?

It will support all of the modes you have mentioned, at least not color
depths.

We are planning on offering the following:
SCREEN MODE 0: 320 x 200 x 8 bit color
SCREEN MODE 1: 320 x 200 x 16 bit color
SCREEN MODE 2: 640 x 400 x 8 bit color
SCREEN MODE 3: 640 x 400 x 16 bit color
SCREEN MODE 4: 640 x 480 x 8 bit color
SCREEN MODE 5: 640 x 480 x 16 bit color
SCREEN MODE 6: 800 x 600 x 8 bit color
SCREEN MODE 7: 800 x 600 x 16 bit color
SCREEN MODE 8: 1024 x 768 x 8 bit color
SCREEN MODE 9: 1024 x 768 x 16 bit color
EXTENDED MODES:
SCREEN MODE 10: 320 x 200 x 32 colors
SCREEN MODE 11: 320 x 200 x 64 colors
SCREEN MODE 12: 640 x 400 x 32 colors
SCREEN MODE 13: 640 x 400 x 64 colors
SCREEN MODE 14: 640 x 480 x 32 colors
SCREEN MODE 15: 640 x 480 x 64 colors

Obviously, the extended modes are really only of value to Amiga
programmers and on the PC and MAC these will be mapped to
8-bit color displays.

Basically, the whole system is you ask for one of these screen modes
and you get the closest thing available on the other platforms.
To you, it is seamless and does not effect anything.


All of these things can be implemented in time.... if you are asking if
everything you have mentioned will be available within two months the
answer is no. However, given time all things are possible and even
likely.

People should know my main concern is always on FAST, COMPACT
code. It is what I do best. Keith and I have already discussed the
basic design which would offer the maximum speed while
allowing us to create incredibly compact executables.

BTW- Name change from Keith, now called BNG....
BASIC: the Next Generation
.... I assume. :-)

You want a manual too ? Good grief, you guys are never satisfied !!
Actually, the command structure we are using on the prototype version -
well, you'll pick it up very quickly. Manual and more information will
probably be more forthcoming when things become more advanced.

We agree completely!! Naturally, everyone wants to get to the

but the important thing is for us to lay a solid foundation and that is
exactly what we are working on at the moment.

Well, I suppose that one message I posted sounded like that.
Hahahahaha. I understand completely what you mean about

I thought there was an entire team working on this?
Actually, I also thought this project died last year as I do not recall

programming at the beginning of '98.

That is so damn strange. Why these people do this I will never
understand. Drop the project if you feel the time requirements are too
much for you.... that I can understand but to take all the source,
eliminating any progress which was made, makes no sense.
If we decide to commit to the creation of BNG and I decide that the
project is no longer fun, the moon turns red or I feel it is draining too
much time.... I will pass everything on to Keith.... well, actually Keith
will have everything anyway as we have been sending updates back

The BNG design is exactly this:
First, it is all a concept which became a design and then was tested.
It works, is blazingly fast and incredibly compact.
At least for me, BNG is still an idea.... something which I know can
be created but I have not commited to doing so at this time. I am
simply experimenting at the moment. I am not sure of where Keith
stands on this decision.

The language takes advantage of the fact that there are powerful
audio and video (ie. game programming) libraries avalable for the
Amiga, PC, MAC and probably every other platform out there.
The language is being written in straight C.

Having written BASIC to machine code compilers in the past, we
have decided to try another approach this time. As you know,
many compilers compiled to a sort of SpeedCode, something
about one step or two above machine code.
Obviously, SpeedCode is not a set format and any author can
create their own version.

In this way, BNG will be similiar to Java which produces ByteCode.

The SpeedCode principle allows BNG to be easily ported to
every platform out there as long as we can compile the C source
into the engine executable.

It also opens up some very interesting abilities such as multi-tasking
programs or interrupt driven routines. These things are very easy to
implement when you are using a Virtual CPU.

The language design is basically being thrown together by both Keith
and I "on the fly" at the moment (dabbling).
The compiler is being created by Keith on the
Amiga.
The BNG Virtual Machine (CPU) is being created by myself on the PC.

Definitely.... agreed. :)

Yes, I was actually just thinking about this last night driving home.
The AMOS data banks are one of the things that made AMOS so usable.
I think it is safe to say that we will have dedicated graphics image
bank, dedicated sound bank and general purpose binary data banks.

Amos Multitask...

Mon Nov 15, 1999 2:36 pm
Truls Osmundsen <ozzy1@online.no>


Hi!

Usually I just run Amos and work only in the editor when I program.
But here the other day, I had to check one mail when I was in amos.
The workbench was crawling... My PicassoII (with P96) was draaawing
and updating sooo slow, and all I had up was Yam and amos.
The program in amos wasn't even running, only the editor was up.
Has anyone the same problem, or is my amos proffesional copy broken
in some way?

no i'm sorry i can't. i'm actually planning a 3D wireframe type thing

Just having amos editor running on my amiga eats litrally 0 cpu time,
although it may be conflicting with P96 or sommin?

Nah, having it 100% compatible would be sooooo dificult, all it has to be is
roughly similer, so it isn't too hard converting programs to it.

That way, you could make it easier to write the language, and make the
language better as well :)

In fact, I am quite certain this will be incredibly easy to implement
and plan on doing so in the next session (probably tomorrow night).
I think I will limit the Virtual Engine's multitasking abilities to
eight tasks or so just because even that seems like overkill.

Okay, that is what Bill Gates said about 640k of RAM and we all know
how that turned out, so I think I will go with 16 tasks running
simultaneously.
Surely that is plenty!!!!! What projects are gonna need more than
sixteen different tasks running at the same time? Poorly designed
ones, that is the answer!! Hahahaha.

One thing we obviously need in such a system is an easy way for the
different tasks to communicate so Keith, we need to add a few commands
to facilitate this InterTask Communicationt:
SENDMESSAGE (integer)TaskNumberToContact, (string)MessageDate
(Integer)NumMessagesWating = CHECKMESSAGES(Integer)TaskNumber
(string)MessageData = RETRIEVEMESSAGE(integer)TaskNumber

Yeah, I think this should do the trick.

Erm, if you use lists (like exec.library does) then it is ridiculously easy
to have any number of tasks. And lists make task switching very easy (no
need for extra variables to store which task is on.

I really really hate hard-coded limits, especially when there is no need.

A few diferent brands of BASIC compilers offered that option.
I think the Comal and Promal languages compiled to SpeedCode
also.

Of course, there were Adventure Writers such as Infocom and
Scott Adams and later Sierra who all created similiar languages
to make it easier to do their thing.

If I wanted unlimited number of tasks I could easily use linked lists,
dynamically allocating memory for each new task.
I never said it was difficult, just see no need in it.
i think people are forgetting that we are generating this language
"on the fly" so far.
There has been an amazing two days of development!!

I see no need for the need.

Busy waiting for what???
You call the routine... if it says 0 then you have nothing talking to
you. If you want to wait until something actually sends you a message
then you can, but it would make more sense to continue processing.

Also, not sure how you missed it but in the next paragraph
this was upgraded to sixteen tasks.

Just to be on the extra safe side, I will set it at 32 tasks.
If someone needs more than that they would be well advised
to rethink their design.
You could easily build a Robots game easily this way.... 31 robots
running simultaneously each coded by a different programmer.
One task reserved for main control, loading, starting the other
tasks, etc.

I don't see the point of the tasks having a direct line of communication if
you use global variables you can send a flag to remote trigger actions. You
are implementing Amiga DOS type global variables right?

Is their a web page for this project? I'd like to see a command summary.

Say you have a task, that does processing when it gets a message. Then
once it has finished processing it replies (or whatever). The task now
has nothing to do until the next message arrives. You really need a
WaitMessage() function, because otherwise the task has to loop, checking
for messages, which wastes CPU time. Imagine 30 tasks (about average on
my system - dos handlers, workbench, various utils) all frantically looping
just checking for messages.

Better to have the sendmessage function check if the destination is waiting,
and if it is then wake it up. Like exec.library does ;)

Using global variables is unsafe - you need semaphores to regulate access
otherwise unpredictable results and deadlocks can occur. Basically the
problem is that a task switch could occur between reading the variable
and writing it. Example:

x = 2

task 1 reads x
task 2 reads x
task 1 writes x = x+1
task 2 writes x = x+1

result x = 3, although it should be 4.


Concurrency needs to be handled very carefully.

BNG - THE PROJECT THAT MIGHT BE....

>> Is their a web page for this project? I'd like to see a command summary.
>Hmm, Garfield, do you think a we should do a command summary and
>website after barely 2 days development, or should we wait till the end
>of the week?

Hahahahaha!! I guess I need to stop replying to posts and
getting things fired up, huh?

Just so everyone knows.... there is no official BNG project at this
time. We are just dabbling, messing around and having fun.
There is no command summary, no website, no anything yet.
Everything comes into existence about ten minutes before it is
implemented.

At work I do enough "proper" development, creating design docs,
cost analysis's, etc so this is very refreshing to just jump in and
have fun with this thing in a sort of crazy fashion.

I know people are gonna say that is no way to approach this kind
of project.... but I think it is. As long as we do not take this
thing too seriously and just have fun with it, progress will continue
at the current rate.

I think a main reason why we have seen so many attempts at
creating a new language fail is that everyone gets into so much
detail, the progress slows to a crawl then stops completely as
people become buried in a ton of design issues, pressure to make
everyone happy (impossible), etc.

Personally, all I wanted to know was that people were interested in
a new language. Now, I am just gonna continue consulting with
Keith and just having fun with this project. This is just a "use what
we already know" kind of thing which is why development will be
at a tremendous rate as long as we keep things straight-forward
and fun!! :)

Of course, gotcha!! See, I always checked for incoming events and
if there were some, processed them, if not then did other things
(scrolling messages, loading data, etc.) unless it was just a simple
application where everything was completely Event oriented.

I had thought about this over the weekend and to be honest even
though event driven languages are very cool in their own way
(Oracle, VB, etc), I am leaning toward the more linear style of
processing offered by AMOS and C.

However, you make a valid point, and I can see where this would
be very handy when dealing with the multtasking processing....so
we now give two choices:
CHECKMESSAGES immediately returns the number of messages in
the message buffer allowing you to continue processing.
WAITFORMESSAGE freezes the task until a message arrives.

Mainly because this has just been completely "in fun".
Keith and I have been operating under this rule for the
three days of development: SIMPLICITY AND FUN!

So, we have one limit in BNG. The language will "only"
be able to execute 32 independant user-written programs.
I just do not see where this is any major restriction.

We are not building a multitasking operating system or
an operating system at all for that matter (well, okay maybe
a super scaled down one in a sense but hardly anything like
Intuition), rather a language. If someone wants unlimited tasks
they can run BNG multiple times on the Amiga or PC.

No, we are not implementing Amiga DOS type global variables.
We are not copying the Amiga operating system at all.
We simply want BNG to be able to handle 32 independant tasks.

I came up with those commands for direct communication just because
they seemed sensible and obvious. A task needs to be able to send
messages, check for new messages, and receive messages. Of course,
we now have a fourth command which will wait until a message arrives.

That is probably as close to the Amiga OS as BNG will get.
We just think it would be cool to allow these tasks to have direct
communication. Less overhead, easy to process, yet very powerful.

Remember, ideas are simply popping into our minds all the time.
Just this moment I was thinking of getting a cup of coffee.... er, I mean
I was thinking of event driven stuff that we do need in BNG and of
course a menuing system and dialog boxes would be two things we
will need to implement through an Event Driven System.

Speed....

Tue Nov 16, 1999 7:34 pm
"GarfieldAtWork" <garfield@dtgrp.com>


As you know I have been saying BNG is gonna be fast.
In most other language comparisons (say AMOS - BLITZ)
that translates to a 50% increase in overall performance.

Great news.... I did some timing tests this morning at home and
the BNG code is now hitting an incredible 99% of the speed
of C code.
This means that even after we have added the overhead of
messaging, multitask tracking, and whatever else may creep
in the days ahead, BNG should still deliver 90-95% of the speed
of C!!!!
For those who are interested.... Keith and I performed some
tests last year and found that C was by far the fastest of any
Amiga languages except pure Asm (obviously).

We compiled a test program in AMOS, BLITZ, BLITZ+Asm, and C.
The speed was in the order I just listed (slow to fastest) with the C
program being five times faster than the AMOS version.

Does this mean BNG will allow you to make games with 5x as
much stuff on the screen at the same frame-rate as your current
AMOS version? Of course not.... but it is reasonably safe to
assume the completed Amiga version of BNG would deliver
2-4x the speed of AMOS, depending on how graphic intensive
the program is.

BTW - this is a lunchbreak message!! Hahahahaha. ;)

Rem f1=0 readable f1=1 nonreadable

x = 2: f1=0

if f1=0 then let task read x
Let f1=1 : task 1 reads x

if f1=0 then let task read x
task 2 waits to reads x

task 1 writes x = x+1: Let f1=0

if f1=0 then let task read x
Let f1=1 : task 2 reads x
task 2 writes x = x+1: Let f1=0

result x = 4, it should be 4 all's ok.

Tasks have priorities so the CPU only works on one instruction at a time, so
this should work. I like global variables for global things, and local
variables for local things. Basic lets me program how I want to right or
wrong it's up to me I hate structured programing languages. Please include
global variables, so I can continue to be as unstructured as I want to be.

Hahahahaha!! Now, see what I was saying about
why most new language projects fail? :)

Actually though, when I really consider what you
are saying, it means much less work for us:

Basically, what you are suggesting can be achieved
very easily.... everyone simply codes their own database
language and runs it in a seperate BNG task.


BTW -
it just hit me why you are so adament about things like the
unlimited tasks. It is a EUREKA!! moment here. ;)
You are coming from the angle of the way the real BNG
should be developed.... if it was taken seriously (not that
seriously - I mean if we commited to the project) and we
are just messing around build a prototype to test our ideas.
This is a test and only a test.
.
If we commit to actually doing the BNG project you will have
no built-in limits on anything, including tasks.
The current prototype engine code will be trashed and I
will build a new one: it will be a better engine.... better....
stronger.... faster. (sound familiar?).

We know there is a lot of interest in the BNG project.
We know that our basic concepts and design work flawlessly.
We know the quickly thrown together half-assed Engine
prototype is working incredibly well.
We know that Keith has both the BNG compiler and decompiler
in simultaneous development and working perfectly.

So, I guess it is time we made the decision.
Do we commit to producing BNG or do we say, "well, that
was a lot of fun but it is over now"?? :)

What do you say Keith??? (gotta like how I put you on the
spot like this). Hahahahahaha.

Global variables would be in the system but they would be
local to the individual task. You would use the messaging system
to communicate directly with any tasks as needed.

If you like, I guess we could always stick in a few GlobalTaskVariables
so you could set flags. :)

Have you checked so it's not software related? (Virus/conflicts)
Boot up with no startup-sequence, leave it. Still freezes?
Try the same by disabling the HD and boot from an empty floppy.
Can you hear if the HD looses speed suddenly? If so it can be your PSU.

For those who aren't sure, this is also a test to see if Keith & Garfield
can actually write a new language in less than a week !! Strange, but true.
The fact we are bunging in multitasking and other wierd stuff is to prove
how easily it can be done !

I suppose this means they want the compiler to debug their code as well...

Just keep everything advanced like you have been! Along those lines,
OPTIONAL intelligent warning messages would be great, such as:
"Keith here: I noticed you have made a possible error in line 12.
It looks like you might have intended to reference the existing
variable by the name of 'hisDarnVariable' and made a typo when
you entered 'ThisDamnVariable'. If so I will correct this for you, if
not then I will assume you want to create a new variable by the name of
'ThisDamnVariable' and continue compilation. Have a nice day!!"
Would you like Keith to change this Variable name to 'ThisDarnVariable'?
Please press y or n.

Yeah, I know what you mean. After seeing how much we have
accomplished in three days though.... kind of makes me want

Well, I meant that I would focus on doing things the proper way in the
engine instead of the incredibly fast and oh so straightforward way I
have been using.... ya know things like designing the task messaging
commands in seconds as I am writing them in a message to the list.

Website? Erk!! Man, that is too serious, isn't it?? We cannot maintain
that thing. Well, maybe if we made a small utility to scan the compiler
data and auto write the webpage doc, listing all commands, it would not
be too bad. At least then we only need to upload the html file once or
twice per week.

In fact its not even on the AMIGA any more (beyond this point anyway).

However, I know there are plenty of talented people with good equipment out

What I need is voice samples. Lots of them.
A variety of males and females saying specific phrases (which I will tell

I suppose this would be best done by someone who has a good sound sampler
and can fiddle with the settings to make the same person sound like

Anyway, if theres someone willing to help me with this, it would be great.

If I'm reading this right this would mean that if I have 4 tasks that need
to use the same variable I would have to make 4 variables that contain the
same information (wasting memory), and setup 4 variable updateing routines
that inform all 4 programs to update (needlessly wasting cpu cycles). This
does not seem very resource thrifty.

Do you mean have both Global, and Local variables ( A,A$,A%, and @A,@A$,@A%)
? Then yes that's what I would like.

Are variables going to be limited to lengths of 256 still?

Probably not. Do you mean variable names ? It'll handle at least 256 times
that... Is this a low limit, or should I make variable name length longer
?? If you mean string length, well, available memory sounds about right to
me. Wouldn't recommend it though.

Yes, that is a correct analysis of the basic usage.
The idea is to offer encapsulation.... independant self-contained
tasks. In AMOS (C, etc) when a programmer calls a procedure,
any data passed into that procedure is stored in new variables.
This sort of thing is happening all the time throughout a program
seamlessly to the programmer.
As far as wasted CPU cycles are concerned.... whether you are
analyzing a local variable or a global variable is not going to make
any difference.
The only additional overhead I can see would be if you wanted
to inform the other three tasks ("simultaneously") that new data has
arrived. Using a Global variable, you would simply make one
statement, such as:
G_AllTasksUpdate = TRUE
instead of sending three messages from Task0 before it could
continue processing, such as:
SENDMESSAGE Task1, "NewData!!"
SENDMESSAGE Task2, "NewData!!"
SENDMESSAGE Task3, "NewData!!"

One way of handling this would be to simply create a chain:
Task0: SENDMESSAGE Task1, "NewData!!"
Task1: SENDMESSAGE Task2, "NewData!!"
Task2: SENDMESSAGE Task3, "NewData!!"

Another way would be for Keith & I to bit encode the TaskIDs
the same way AMOS handles Voice selection in the Sample commands:
Task0: SENDMESSAGE Task1+Task2+Task3, "NewData!!"

Regardless of the global variable issue, the bitvalue based TaskID
could be cool, however it would once again lock in a limit on the
number of tasks.
If we used 64-bit TaskIDs then obviously we could only have 64 unique
TaskIDs which means we could only have 64 tasks (which I think is
plenty but I know, I know.... BNG is supposed to be "unlimited").
Something to consider.... Keith, what do you think?



>If you like, I guess we could always stick in a few GlobalTaskVariables
>so you could set flags. :)
>> Do you mean have both Global, and Local variables ( A,A$,A%,
>>and @A,@A$,@A%)? Then yes that's what I would like.

Well, actually I meant just some Integer variables so you could
set flags and stuff. hahahaha.
What the heck, making some Globals are no problem, but I like
to organize things a bit.... so I am now thinking of predefined
instead of dynamic variables:
IGTV0 thru IGTV15 16 Integer Variables
FGTV0 thru FGTP15 16 Floating Point Variables
SGTV0 thru SGTV15 16 64-character String Variables
See, my mind keeps thinking of things like this because I am
thinking part of the fun in programming is working out how to work
around the limitations of the language. If we make a truly unlimited
language where would the fun be in figuring out a cool way to do
something?? (yeah, I am twisted, huh?) Hahahahahahahaha.

See, now that we have basically commited to doing this project these
are issues we are gonna actually look at and design. We wanted to
avoid that and build this "on the fly" but I guess we need to take a
day or two and actually properly design the language.... I suppose.
Just cannot have things becoming too serious.... life should be fun!!

Unsafe! Example: task 1 may be doing some calculations with a global
variable, task 2 changes it, so the calculation gets messed up. You
really do need semaphores - but you could get the compiler to hide the
gory details from the end user programmer.

Also, if you have one variable for "update all tasks", how do you know
when all the tasks have got the message? It would work the first time
you changed the variable, but after that it doesn't make sense (when do
you set the flag to false?). Use messages, maybe have a special send()
function that sends to all tasks but your own. Compare BOOPSI - that
has a class that sends messages sent to it to all the objects in a list,
with checking to make sure that each object gets each message exactly
once.

The general theme is: some clever people have worked out the theory of
multiple tasks, and the best ways to avoid problems. So obey the rules
of laziness:

1: there's no point doing something if someone has already done it
2: if something's worth doing, someone else will do it first if you
wait long enough, then see rule 1

Yes, I agree but that is the programmer's problem, not mine.
If someone wants to use globals then they will need to handle this.

Again, I agree completely but the guy wants to use Global variables
so I am assuming he had considered these things.

Yes, that popped into my head but I did not want to keep writing as that
message was rather lengthy as it was. hahaha ;)

Well, that seems like common sense and is to a large degree but I think
as programmers we have that desire to live on the edge a bit, try
something new and perhaps even find a better way as we are not exactly
unclever ourselves. The difference is we are giving a window into the
thinking process, (like I said, l am writing down what is running through
my mind at that moment) where the other clever people only showed the
final result.... and, if anything, that is what made them the cleverest
of us all. :)

The only things required (at this time) would be either an Amiga running
Workbench or a PC running Windows (preferably 95 or higher).

We are not using anything from any specific operating system because
A) it is completely unnecessary and B) it would obviously make porting
the language difficult. We can make streamlined routines which do
everything we need and run faster than the "take care of everything"
OS routines while still being completely portable.

The only thing that will be used on each platform which is specific to
that platform will be an audio/video library. However, these audio/video
routines will be seamlessly linked in so you will not have to do anything
other than the BASIC programming. Before someone screams about
program size... let me point about that a PC game demo I created with
Allegro and C is only 219k (uncompressed) even though it displays VGA
and SVGA graphics, plays custom sound samples and a few tunes.

Demos will be posted as soon as I can be bothered to code the new
Virtual CPU.

As far as the compiler/decompiler are concerned, Keith has everything
under control and is making rapid progress. Actually, he had it parsing
and compiling most things within the first day but of course we keep
changing things as new ideas hit us.

I hope to spend at least a couple days this month working on the new
Virtual CPU. It should only take two days to complete it.

By Christmas we will definitely have Alpha versions available, providing
Keith and I can both find 2-3 free days next month. :-)

Don't worry.... we will not let you down!! :-)

New entry and OSdevKit

Sat Nov 20, 1999 5:48 pm
Marco Vettorello <marcoegon@tiscalinet.it>


Hi everybody on this list!
I'm a new entry. My name is Marco Vettorello, i'm Italian, 22 years old. I'm
studying as a psicologist at the University of Padua.
First: my English is far from being good, so have fun with my errors ;-)

I'm using Amos since 1990/1991 and I've a little of experience. I've written
some utilities in AmosPro using the Gui Extension and all the other extensions
made avaiable for free on the AmosFactory. In particular: Vocabo and MVslink

Vocabo is a spellchecker. It uses an Arexx port, waits until a word is sent to
it and then checks if it's a legal word of your language. For the moment i've
included only italian vocabulary but on my HD there's and archive with English
words. It's on Aminet. In the archive there are some Arexx script working with
BlacksEditor but I think it will simple to translate them for another TextEd

MVslink is a splitter. Have you got really big files? Do you want to transport
them with floppies? Then this utils is for you! It uses a smart memory usage
not Bload and Bsave but Sload and Ssave: it loads only a part of the big file
and save to disk, it loads the next freeing the previous allocated memory and so
on... Also in the archive on Aminet there SubSlink that enables you to slink a
file bit by bit: you can save the first 3 bytes on a particular file, the last
10 bytes on another file. It's usefull for deleting headers and footers in
datafile.

Ah, each archive has the source code! :-Ð

Also I've written a simple cripting util (MVcrypt) that uses a fast algorithm
known as St.Cyr
But it's not on Aminet. Ask me it if you have some interest. Source included.

A simple memory indicator. 2 gauge in a window on your wb screen. Source
included, ask me it.

A nice (mmmh.. maybe) address organizer using random access file. Source
included, ask me it.

I hope to give my hands to you and, of course, I need yours.
Amos can still do much for our community. That's the real goal.

My first question is about OSdevKit. There is a better documentation? A lot of
commands aren't documentated.

Bye.

It can be better...

Yes!!! They have to kill me (or my A4000/040) to stopping me writting programs
in Amos.
I have to admint: Amos has not a good editor _at this time_. When it became
available it was up to date but now :-| it is a bit old. I would like to use a
standard texted (even Ed of our AmigaDos) opened on my workbench screen. I would
like to have an Arexx port. And other features in order to have Amos as much as
possible OS compliant. But it works and give me extrafast preview of what I'm
doing. No other language I've tried (ACEbasic, PureBasic, GNU C++, AmigaE) do
the same. Well they are compiled not interpreted, but the concept is 'I want to
know _now_ what I'm doing'.

> We have heard rumors that a couple guys on this list are working on a

Maybe Pietro and his group?
I've read an article of an italian magazine: AmigaLife. Pietro (which is quite
famous here in Italy) spoke about the new extensions that will be available for
Amos. They are doing a great job, I think, let's wait and see what will happen.

<sounds of scribbling on random scraps of paper>
Yes, I agree with your point on the interpreter. That is without a doubt
one of the main reasons AMOS is such a nice development system.
Whether you are playing a game, using a database or developing software
one thing remains constant: you need the ability to quickly and
seamlessly interact within the environment while receiving logical
feedback.

The interpreted nature of AMOS makes it ideal to develop in as you can
quickly change a line here or there, click Run and immediately see the
results of your changes. It is the aspect which makes AMOS such a fine
choice for new programmers.

Actually, if you are using something like GCC on the PC on decent
machine then you can have that too. My sources compile into executables
in seconds, but that is another story.

HAPPY THANKSGIVING, MY FELLOW AMERICANS!!
HAPPY THURSDAY, MY NON-AMERICAN FRIENDS!!

Great news.... Keith and I discussed this BNG project last night and
it looks like everything is well under control. We have actually spent
the past few days designing things and now have several designs
floating around for the different aspects of the project. These design
docs will almost certainly come in handy, we hope! hahahaha ;)

We are still targeting a pre-Christmas release of the demos (both
De/Compiler and VirtualCPU. You will most likely NOT be able to do
anything with audio or video other than simple text but you can still
have fun messing around with the foundation, comparing speed, and
even writing text-based dungeon romps, etc. (Ah, I remember those
days well.... amazing how excited you could get over confronting an O
or finding some T).

We might even release a source or two which you can compile and
actually execute. :-)

Give me a "b".... "B"
Give me an "n".... "N"
Give me a "g".... "G"
What do we have? "bng", "bng!", "BNG", "BNG!", "BNG!!", "BNG!!!"
We appreciate your support! hahahaha. :-)

Have a nice day!

AMOS Professional released as PD.

Fri Nov 26, 1999 2:26 am
"Adam Parrott" <parrottsoft@usa.net>


Hello, there.

For those who have been searching high and low for a copy of AMOS
Professional 2.0 and the Compiler: look no further. An Amiga site called
"Back to the Roots" (http://back2roots.emuunlim.com) has received
permission to post the entire AMOS library, from AMOS Classic to AMOS Pro,
.zip'ed in .ADF format (readable by UAE) on their site. You may obtain any
of the AMOS Basic library by visiting their Files area at:

http://back2roots.emuunlim.com/About/History/Files//211/

or, if you wish to read the news page about the release, goto:

http://back2roots.emuunlim.com/About/History/

and read up a brief history of AMOS and find some useful Amiga utilities. I
have yet to install these AMOS disks in WinUAE, but I assume that they will
work. The "AMOS Professional Update 2.0" seems to include the update to the
Pro Compiler as well, for those who are looking for the Compiler. :)

On a side note (CBATNAM-related): I await some new gfx routines from PAC.
As soon as I get them, then I will release the latest demo for the Dugeon.

And lastly, I wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving. Thanks again and enjoy!

AMS and OSdev Kit

Hi guyz,
I 've a problem to call back AmosPro with the command AMS when the extension
OSdev is installed. Without this extension I can switch from WB screen to Amos
screen, but if i install it (on slot n 20) I've no response. I've checked what's
wrong with SnoopDos and it say me that AMS looks for a task named AMOS and
fails. I've checked the Task list and I've found a task name AMOSPro. I've done
the same without the OSdev and the behaviour is the same: AMS looks for AMOS but
finds it, and I have back my Amos screen.

Now, simply ;) , what's wrong?

Maybe a new version of AMS could be the right answer? ( Ciao Pietro!)

Awesome, another fine looking development system!
Yes, the PC market is full of cool stuff like this!! :-)

Unfortunately, this seems to be available only for the PC.
I could find no Amiga version (and not even MAC). I also
noticed they are already expecting to charge at least $50.

It looks like a cool game creator though.... kind of reminds me of
a 90's version of the old Activision Game Creator I had on my C64.

problem.I have AmosPro 1.3 and Amos compiler(original).I have managed to compile
some source code,but Amos Compiler just doesn't suport many Pro commands.I
think,it should be possible to start compiler from Amos,but I have no idea,how
to do it from AmosPRO.I know Amos PRO compiler exists,but it seems to be quite
impossible to get.I heard,some amos source-code had been released to net,maybe
even from compiler?If someone knows where I could get it,I would be happy to
know.

Downloading all the disks will enable you to install amospro then the
upgrade disks and finally the compiler - don't try it by hand.

I would actually hesitate to even call this a BASIC as it seems
more like a glorified (3D) game construction kit than a true
programming language but this is simply my impression.

Can it be used to create a database, utilities, etc?
I wonder if it can actually handle this(??):
For REP=1 To 10
Print REP * 10
Next REP

Actually, I am not even sure this so called Dark Basic can handle
non 3D rendered games(???).

Still, DB does look like a very cool development kit for anyone
interested in developing 3d rendered games for the PC.


I mainly just want to make sure people realize that Dark Basic,
although appearing to be a powerful 3D Game Creation System, is not
a version of BNG nor is it associated with BNG in any way.

BNG is a real programming language which is about 80-90% directly
compatible with AMOS while still being much faster than AMOS.
BNG will be available for both Amiga and PC at the same time which
means you can throw together a simple "demo" on the Amiga, compile it
and execute that demo on both the Amiga and the PC.

OS3.5 is not a rom upgrade. It uses the 3.1 roms.

3.1 is known to cause probs with interlaced screens, but this is fixed with the

Well, if you can dynamically change textures, like drawing shapes etc. to
them, then it would be easy. If not, then it would be limited so some degree...

Good grief.

...and this is just the beta ?

The only problem with it is the middle mouse button doesn't scroll on
the editor - and it quits every once in a while, save proggies, and
you're fine. There are some wierd quirks with the language, but
those can be programmed around easy enuf. Could change screenmodes
quicker, but then again, couldn't all top of the range graphic cards.

3D/2D/Maths/Force Feedback/Etc...

Even the demos are impressive. VERY impressive.

Does pretty much everything except windoze... Like thats a problem.

Some of it is quite amos-like, some of it isn't. It is a full basic
system, works in an amos-like editor "interpreted" or compiled, I
seem to be having very little trouble testing it at the mo.

Most of the commands are "slightly different" but the conversion is
quite easy. Suggest you power up a second machine to look at the
.htm help files, as the amos-like context sensitive help is disabled
in this version. You don't NEED to though, the help clicks on/off
quite easily, similar to the way amos does it, except via html. In
other words, you can't type in amos listings without messing around a
bit.

It saves its proggie files (.dba) in raw text format, so you can mess
with them externally too.

Some of the commands are a bit stricter than amos, some commands
accept only integers instead of variables, and it took me a full 15
seconds to figure out while...wend is now while...endwhile.

In a couple of hours at the machine I should have a more interesting
test proggie available, probably with some 2D and 3D thrown in for
good measure, and doing something interesting.

They supply a basic test set of (probably) everything you need in the
initial download, and have additional stuff available online as well.
The demos and examples provided are quite reasonable.

You can read most of the code with little effort, as with anything
though, a hard copy manual might be helpful, as online help can get a
tad tedious. Then again, you can live without it.

The suprising thing is the power of the commands... it seems to be
acomplishing things a heck of a lot simpler than it should !
Comparing to amos 3D ? Well, it exceeds ALL the limits of amos 3D,
has support for landscapes, objects, animated objects, movable
objects, plenty of textures, FOG, and a bunch of other stuff I havn't
looked at yet.

Yes it does give fairly impressive results.

The only problem (and its one BIG problem as far as I'm concerned) is the
way it uses and editor like AMOS's. Please, we're well past using custom
interfaces in this day and age. A windows editor would have been much
better, with colour coded keywords etc.
Anyway, its something that should have been out on the PC years ago. I would
have loved it then. Now though, I fear I'm too stuck in C++ land to go back
to that sort of thing.

I'm sure someone could put together a darkbasic mode for emacs, or
whatever text editor you prefer using.. Hmmm, can you do that sort
of thing in wordbasic ?

Oh, someone said can you do dynamic textures and stuff ? Yeah, you
can. VERY dynamic. Dynamic landscapes are way easy.

A full basic system, eh? Now, that is very interesting indeed!!

There are so many development systems available for the PC, the
difficult part is choosing which one to use. I always leaned towards
Allegro and C/C++ but their are plenty of others such FastGraph,
Nautilus, DirectX, OpenGL, etc, etc. Actually just doing a search
for "game creation", "game development", etc will lead you to many.

If everyone simply wants to be able to develop games and things on
the PC as easily as AMOS allows on the Amiga then there really is
no need for BNG as all you need to do is search the Internet and you
will find several options to choose from. :-)

BNG: The language that never was?

Mon Nov 29, 1999 3:29 pm
"GarfieldAtWork" <garfield@dtgrp.com>


>If BNG ever gets finished that is....
>(hopefully it will, but what happened to the last AmosNG?....)

Hahahahaha! Well, we only had the initial concept and started throwing
messages around on the list a mere two weeks ago.

Bearing in mind that Dark Basic was in development for over two years and
is still not 100% complete. How long has Paul Manias(?) been working on
the GMS library? Seems like it has been a few years now.

I am not criticizing these people for the length of development time,
rather I mention them to simply illustrate that it does take time to
produce a working language or library system. Also, we are not talking
about a simple project.... full multitasking built into the language
itself, fully portable between platforms, ability to run the same BNG
program on multiple platforms, 80%+ directly compatible with AMOS, etc.

It is almost certain that BNG would be in development for 3-4 years if
produced by the creators of Dark Basic or anyone else.

So, please keep in mind that BNG is a rather large project and if we are
able to actually complete it by Christmas 2000 that will be incredibly
fast in comparison to similiar projects (3-4 x faster)!!

We are both trying to devote 2-3 hours per week on this project but
sometimes that is very difficult to do. As long as BNG remains
interesting we will work on it. If we become bored with it then we will
throw up the source for what we have and someone else can carry it
forward.

In the latest news I devoted my time yesterday and created the core
file system. Keith is working on compiler/decompiler tweaks when
he is not playing with Dark Basic or building websites for his clients.

I just converted my TwinzPro game (and several of my 3D routines from
AMOSPro) into DarkBasic, in less than a day. I like the language (even
though it's stuck in a 640x480 editor, which Lee tells me it is going to be
fully customizable) and it's damn quick when you use the SYNC commands with
your graphics. If you don't use them, its like an AMOS program when drawing
on the screen, i get about 7 tiles/second at 96x120, however, using the
commands, i can get in excess of 300+ a second.

Hmm.... from what Keith has been telling me he actually likes this Dark
Basic and it appears that you do too. :-)

I will have to give DB a proper checking into right after I check out the
latest version of Andy (Hawkin's) awesome looking PC surfin' game.

Keith says it is very simple.... alot of power for a little work.... hmm,
sounds like AMOS. You are saying it can almost be fast enough for
realtime games, actually 300 tiles per second is only 5-6 tiles per Vbl
which seems very close to AMOS's speed but of course those are some
big tiles you are blitting and I thinking of 32x32 AMOS tiles!!! :-)

Instead of drawing directly to the screen, can't you draw to a hidden
bitmap and the do a blitcopy all at once to the Video RAM?
The way the PC architecture's Video Board access is designed a one time
dump of a full bitmap should be much faster than several hundred small
blits.

If you have seen the demo's you'l know the power it has. My favourites are
the seademo, and the little tank demo, virtually no code, yet a lot of
result =))

My tiles are 16-bit too =)) I could make it go even faster if I wanted too =))

Thats pretty much what the sync commands do. In the start of your code,
you'd have like:

sync on : rem Manual control over screen drawing

function DoAllGfx
rem Do all the graphics, paste all tiles, update player scores, update
scroller, and anything else graphics related

...

sync
endfunction

the sync command on it's ownb them tells the system to do all the drawing,
instantly. Instead of drawing it, swapping to back buffer, bringing back
buffer to front etc. It will just draw everything in one jump. Many many
times faster =))

Right now, im working on a 3D racing game, and its looking very good =))
even for me, hehe

A couple of days, or less than a week. Then another 3 years
gathering the graphics....

I'm working on something else, but this idea was one of the first
(two).

Of course, I can just import the lightwave objects straight in
without rendering them first this time... And it would use force
feedback on the joystick, full colour, faster graphics, better
scrolling, better ceilings, better a hell of a lot of stuff.

After messing with it, I have no doubt this is the new amos-like
peecee software to use.

Oh, the author said he was gonna add middle mouse scrolling to the
editor...

It's still in development and even the beta version just totally and
utterly rocks. It's complete enough to do almost anything already.
Put it this way - the beta is free, and it is worth a hell of a lot
more than I was ripped off for when I bought blitz & all its
expansions. Creativity unlocked, just like amos. Impressed with it
? Oh hell yeah. I woulnd't mind a hard copy manual though, but the
help files have everything a manual should, including auto-example
loading, just like amos. Hmmm, I should be able to convert the html
into a book...

Hello bLADe
Do you know how to use a sound sample on amos ?

You are giving the impression that you actually like this Dark Basic. ;)
Actually, you are making it sound like the new AMOS for the future,
already well in development, for PC.
I will definitely check into this thing.... what kind of code does it
produce? The executable demos I downloaded were kind of bulky.

DB is freakin' HUGE!!

What makes DB better than any other development system, such
as Euphoria(http://www.rapideuphoria.com/), for intance?

The zip for Euphoria is only 550k for Windows and 482k for Linux
(yep, they already have multiplatform support).

Actually, it looks like Euphoria is using the same method we came
with for BNG. Compiling source to a custom format and then creating
lightning fast interpreters to execute the compiled files.

Kind of bulky...

> DB is freakin' HUGE!!

Yeah, it also likes bitmap and wav formats. I can live with that
till the upgrade fixes it. I could write my own conversion routines
I suppose.

None of the tedious mucking about with darkbasic, it's all
integrated, and it uses my 3D graphics card and FFB joystick, does
real time textured polygons at stupidly complex levels way quick, 3D
animations, bobs, easy as falling off a log and a whole heck of a lot
of other stuff...

I seem to have collected 100megs of bitmaps for it already. I hate
bitmaps. I remember when that was a lot of space. Ah well, only
another 6.5 gigs left on my drive. I suppose I should empty the
couple of gigs in the trash sometime and delete a couple of CD
archives. Ah well...

> The zip for Euphoria is only 550k for Windows and 482k for Linux

True, Euphoria is a hell of a lot smaller, has faster download
mirrors, but going by the demos the things done in euphoria could
have been done in any language. Ok, I'll admit I've only
superficially glanced at euphoria, but after the same cursory glance
at darkbasic, there is no comparison. Tedious mucking about ? Been
there, done that... Darkbasic is all in one. Yeah, a couple of bits
need a bit of work, it has a few quirks I have found already, and
I'm already encroaching on its limits, but I can live with that and
program around it.

Why am I going on about it so much ? For a very long time, I have
been unsatisfied with every programming language I have tried, none
of them did everything I wanted. Blitz had a sucky editor and needed
too much messing about to get anything done, C++ or C was just pure
messing about, peecee basics were just unfriendly and nasty, visual
stuff just didn't feel right somehow, the miscellanous languages just
sucked for doing anything cool, amos didn't do AGA properly, and ran
too slowly for my liking, but in the long run was the best
development system I had encountered so far. I got all the
extensions for it, I even messed around writing my own 3D routines,
and got along quite well writing a brand new amos extension which got
tedious very quickly. There is only so much low level stuff you can
do without getting bogged down in the detail. The designs got so
powerful, the implementation would have taken forever. I have
written a lot of stuff in a lot of different languages, I'm the one
who broke all the records on my programming courses, and yet I have
been so restricted. I looked at that java thing that is supposed to
be the new amos but it didn't seem to be released yet. (Maybe its
out by now, I don't care anymore) I've looked at a lot of junk, and
seen a lot of promises. I'm sure the promises will all pay off in
the end, but it is taking so long, and I am really fed up of waiting.
Yeah, I can do a hell of a lot of really cool stuff with C, pointers
to functions and other stuff, but it takes so long to write anything
with it, its a million declarations and I just don't seem to have the
time for that any more.

Then a couple of days ago I saw darkbasic, and even the beta was
everything I have been looking for all this time. All of a sudden,
instead of being held back, I have my creativity back. I can now
actually go implement all those things I have been planning for years
without reinventing the wheel and getting tied up in quirks. I can
actually do REAL programming again.

Thanks Maurice, for pointing it out to me !

WOW!! That was one powerful message, Keith!!

I can tell you folks, I have now downloaded Dark Basic and am looking
forward to trying it out. For this thing to have made this kind of
impression on Keith, Andrew(Mr. F1 Licenseware) and Maurice you
can bet it is really something special!!!! :-)

sure

create a samplebank, (this is a file containging all the the samples you
wish to use in your program then you can play the sample

so if you had only 1 sample in your bank you would use sam play 1
etc
