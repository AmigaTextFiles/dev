A.S.O.S. and it's executables are written using AMOS.

AMOS is not completely compatible with 68040's and 68060's.

To make AMOS programs work using your processor, please use
the cpu ( or similar ) command to turn off any caches your
processor might have. This should alleviate any problems
running AMOS programs.
