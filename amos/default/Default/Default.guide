@node Introduction

An Introduction To The AMOS_Default_EDIT program.
-------------------------------------------------

        I purchased AMOS, Version 1.2, a couple of years ago and, once set
 up, found it an excellent and easy to use Basic language.  My Amos has
 since been updated to version 1.36, AMOS_Default_EDIT was written using
 this version.

        In the mean time, AmosPro has come onto the market.  This program,
 very similar to Amos, but with a brand new GUI (Graphics User Interface),
 and with a more modernistic approach, gives you the ability to alter the
 parameter of the Default screen (Screen 0).  Unlike Amos, where you can
 only alter the Default Screen Display Position (Pos.y).  Just why (???),
 Francois Lionet restricted us to only this one change I have not the
 foggiest idea.

        I decided it was time to fix the problem, NO more dirty Orange
 (NTSC) screen that Flashed every time you ran a project.  The AMOS user
 too, can NOW have a nice, clear black screen to run a program.  I must
 say at this point that unlike AmosPro with the ability to change the
 Default Screen to any Size or Type Screen, I have restricted my program
 to alterations of Hires or Lores, a Screen Height of 200 or 256,
 Number of Colours (2 to 32) and the Changing of the Colours themselves.
 I feel this is more than adequate.

        Give AMOS_Default_EDIT a try, it's Real easy.

@node Envelopes

The .ENV Extensions.
--------------------

        The Envelope (.ENV Extension) files (among others), are all stored
 in the AMOS_System Drawer.  These files hold all your parameters as to
 the way you would like AMOS to look, the Colours of the Editor screen,
 how many lines, the positioning of the different screens and the File
 Requester and many others.  You have more probably ran the program,
 Config1_2.AMOS or Config1_3.AMOS to alter these parameters.  I have four
 (4) of these files in my AMOS_System drawer, these are:-

             AMOS1_2.ENV      (left over from a previous version).
             AMOS1_3_PAL.ENV
             AMOS1_3_NTSC.ENV
             RAMOS1_3.ENV

        You should have at least three (3) of these files.
 The RAMOS1_3.ENV is used by the Amos Compiler.  Because here in Australia
 we use the PAL Television System, my Amos uses the AMOS1_3_PAL.ENV file.
 An American or Japanese Amos user would use the AMOS1_3_NTSC.ENV.  As
 this is No technical article, I will leave it at that.  Less to be said,
 it will be these files that my program, AMOS_Default_EDIT will Load.

@node Compiler
The Compiler .ENV File.
-----------------------

        The Amos Compiler uses the RAMOS1_3.ENV.  Just to get away from
 that Orange Square when running the Compiler, all I changed in the
 RAMOS1_3.ENV, was Colour #1, to $111.  I suggest you do the Same, as
 this is all that is really needed here.

@node BackUP
Making BackUP Files.
--------------------

        Before anything else I think it a VERY GOOD idea to make a backup
 of ALL your '.ENV' files.  Just Find and Open the AMOS_System Drawer and
 MAKE a COPY of ALL the '.ENV' Files before ALTERING any of them.

        Done It!  Good Job!

@node Doing_It
Running The Program.
--------------------

        The First thing to do is to put the AMOS_Default_EDIT program
 where AMOS can get to it.  If you have a hard drive, in the same
 partition you have Amos and the AMOS_System drawer will do fine.  If you
 Boot with a floppy disk, then you'll have to have space to put it in, on
 the same disk that you have the AMOS_System drawer on.

        Load and run the AMOS_Default_EDIT program, you will first see a
 small screen across the middle of your Monitor, the Title of this screen
 is 'The Command Screen' in the right top corner is the word 'Drag', you
 can slide the screen Up or Down at any time by Click and Holding the Left
 Mouse Button on or near this word and sliding the pointer Up or Down.

        Looking at this screen from Right to Left, we see a small blank
 square (this square will show the Default Screen Parameters on loading
 an Envelope file), and underneath, 'Hires' and 'Lores' buttons, towards
 the middle, buttons for 'Screen Height' and 'No. of Colors' (pardon the
 Australian spelling).  In the middle are the three (3) sliders for
 changing the individual colours.  On the Left are four (4) more buttons
 'END', 'Save', 'RESET Screen 0' and 'RESET Colours'.

        Above (should be?), three (3) or four (4) buttons with the Names
 of the '.ENV' files.  

        IF THESE FILES ARE NOT SEEN, IT MEANS AMOS_Default_EDIT
        CAN NOT FIND THEM.  MAKE SURE THE AMOS_Default_EDIT PROGRAM
        IS ON THE SAME FLOPPY DISK OR IN THE SAME HARD DISK PARTITION
        AS YOUR - AMOS_System DRAWER - (Dir).
       
        I'm going to assume you are using the 'PAL' Mode of operations.
 If you happen to be using 'NTSC', the same will apply except, you will
 have Clicked on the AMOS1_3_NTSC.ENV file button and you CANNOT use the
 '256' button.

        Above these (in the Title), is 'BANK 10: ' and the word 'ERASED',
 I use Amos Bank 10, to hold the Envelope file you Load.  If you Load a
 file it will show the Length of the file.  You can UNload a file by just
 Clicking OFF the same button.

        So, Click on the AMOS1_3_NTSC.ENV file button, another Screen will
 appear behind our Command screen, this is 'The Default Screen', this is
 the SAME screen you see, should you push the 'ESC' button while using
 the Amos program.  The ONLY difference is this screen Now has the Title
 Line and the 'Standard' Amos Default screen Colour Set, graphically
 represented in squares.

        To Change a 'Colour', Click on a colour square (ON the Default
 Screen), then use the Sliders (On the Command Screen), using the same
 method as you do with 'Dragging' a Screen.  One word of WARNING, Always
 have a good contrast between colours #1 and #2, or you may NOT be able
 to see any Printed Text.

        I feel the 'Buttons' speak for themselves, it's best to start
 changing the Screen Mode from Right to Left:-

              Set Buttons ... Hires or Lores.
               '    '     ... Screen Height.
               '    '     ... No. of Colours.
              Set Individual Colours.

   If you make a mistake use 'RESET Colours' to get back the Original
   colour SET.

   If you want to start all over again, use 'RESET Screen 0', to Totally
   reset the Default Screen.

              Use 'Drag' (On the Default Screen), to POSITION it best for
 your Monitor.

        Last of all, if you think you have everything Correct and the way
 you would like it set.  Press the 'Save' Button.  The Command will alter
 slightly to give you a second chance, Click either 'Save' or 'Cancel'.
 Cancel will return you to the Normal Command Screen.  After Save, tap
 any key to return to the Command Screen, then use the 'END' Button to
 Close the AMOS_Default_EDIT program.

       Your NEW Default will be there the NEXT time you Run the AMOS
 Program.
