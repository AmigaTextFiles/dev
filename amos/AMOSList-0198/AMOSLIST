 I'm looking for a good programmer (GOOD), who will get 10% (possibly 20%) of the profit made from the game (expected outcome (from Team17's accountants) is in excess off 500 pounds ($1000).

 Anyway, the majority of the main graphics are finished (the main characters, eggs, a few of the backgrounds and a nice juicy amiga logo).

 I will need from this programmer:

 A level editor
 A DEMO version of the game (containing 8 levels, which I can quickly make in the level editor).
 And the full game.

 There will be a total of 80 levels, 8 different types of landscapes, a plot, and blah blah blah. I may also need a musician  as I am having trouble with creating the correct sort of tune.
 
 Yes, I know this sounds like I'm pushy, but this game has a deadline, and a price tag to go with it.

 Other things:
 2 player support (two joysticks running at the same time).
 A frame rate of AT LEAST 25fps, preferably 50, but this IS AMOS we're talking about.
 A short introduction (animated by me), and a fairly large ending.

 Other people who are needed for production:

 *SOMEBODY WITH A SOUND SAMPLER
 *SOMEBODY WHO CAN MAKE CUTE MUSIC
 *AN ASSISTANT SCRIPT WRITER

 Thankyou for you time, and I hope to receive your help :)

Hello.

I'm Timo Engman, and programming a new extension - which is called 
"Second-Hand Extension", the current version is 0.01d6 but please, all 
AMOSPro users - mail me and let me hear if I may add new commands to this 
extension that the users want...For now, the extension have five commands 
:-) pretty lame. But I learning how to program the graphics...

Bmove adr,x - move bytes quick as hell much faster than Poke (no checking)
Wmove adr,x - same here but words much faster than Doke
Lmove adr,x - same here but longwords , faster than Loke

I mean 4-5 times faster !!!

and then two shitty commands

Shand Version
Shand Stage$

The extension uses slot 22 but mail me and I may change it to whatever.
Check the aminet/dev/amos/ for this extension...later...
Maybe I mail the .Lib file soon, to the Mailing List.

A Problem 1: How to return a string from a routine (and change it's 
length) from it, the string is in the extension

dc.w TheLength
dc.b "TheString",0
even

Problem 2: How to get a pointer from the extension in assembler, 
typically i want the pointer for a variable, same as Varptr(variable) and 
pointer for an array, same as Varptr(var(array))

Hope that all peoples understanding my bad english (I'm swedish)...And 
those people who don't like the assembler language.

/Timo Engman

First of all, Happy New Year to everyone. 

Second of the rest, the files I mentioned last time are now on Aminet 
(thanks, Martin!) so I have removed them from my web site.

Third, here's a little Pro routine I whipped up some time ago (based on 
an even smaller routine I found on the list). Have fun!

Many  thanx  for  just  thinking that I was responsible for that game!
However, I am not :(

To be honest, I don't even know what game it is, nor have I seen it!!!

I'd love to though.... :^)

So just who was responsible and what's it called?

Tarra, Andy Gibson

BDW The way my coding is turning ouut these days, I'd be struggling to
code a Pac Man clone, never mind a Super Road Racer :(

I'm in one of those, `Can't Be Arsed Coding!' moods ya see :)

hehe, _sorry_ about that. We have two (or three) Andy's on this List (that
I know of), and the one I was referring to was Andrew _Hawkins_ (Mr.
GeoSync Software). HE'S the one I meant. Ooops. He HASNT, however, been
frequenting the List alot lately, neither mailing nor CBATNAM, so I haven't
a _CLUE_ where he is. If anyone wants his URL, I can get it to you.

hehe, funny funny.. _EXCUSE ME_. I HAVE been working FULL TIME over the
Break (several hours a day) getting _MUCH_ accomplished, just no updates or
demos yet (although on the way within the week). Don't start YOUR bitching.

As I said when we chatted last night, my level is about 60% done. You may
have to wait alittle longer as I just sent off my registration to Chris
(Hodges) for AMCAF, and I may end up using some of it's commands (C2P).

> Anyway, I am getting back to normal slowly.
> Still no SCSI controller to access all my AMOS stuff.
hehe, just a side point: Were you _EVER_ ("back" to) normal? :)

> Looks like the base system for the game will be moving to 020 minimum.

One thing: I can't send _ANYTHING_ until I get the music from EJ I need
(That would be aLL of it EJ, hehe). Speed is also a big factor in my level,
so bumping up the speed requirements is a must (BESIDES, who's _really_
going to be playing this on anything less that an '020, i.e. a 68000, hm?)

> I just want to hear from the team.
Well, you're hearing from them now.

Okay I`m fessin` up. Firstly I`ve been reading the List Messages just
about every day, I`ve just been secretly plotting against YOU ALLLLL 
HAH HAH HAH HAH---just kidding.  Secondly, I wrote game engine called
Rally World which maybe the racing game you`re talking about.

If so the details of this engine are a little different to Lotus
Esprit.  I`m using polygons and bitmaps to create the 3d effect.  I
think Lotus Esprit uses clever line scrolling, which I have a basic idea
of how its done but I think you`d have to do some clever programming to
simulate this. You could use the Turbo R Bar command I guess.  Actually
the Bar command would work well to create voxel landscapes.  

Anyway, I`m going to use the Rally World engine to do a Car Wars game
for about June 98.  Any suggestions (except where to go, flames etc.)
would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers crew,
Andy H.

   Hmmm... well, you're definitely back.

   Well get on it!!  The last deadline has come and gone. We're now in
   1998 and you still haven't released the final CBATNAM game!!  ;-)

   Has someone been bitching about speed? :)

  On 68020s running at 14MHz or higher (which probably represents
  95%+ of Amiga-users) the sideshooter will be fast and intense.
  After you compile with the ProCompiler (my brother just reminded me
  of this), the stage will be fairly fast on A500 machines.
  I forgot about that... after purchasing my A1200clone I switched to
  Amos Compilerv1.36 to remove the "glitches". The ProCompiler only
  gives me around an 8% speed increase (over the AC1.36) as the gfx-
  updates are taking up the majority of a frame where on stock A500s,
  the ProC has more "room" to improve the performance. Combining
  this with the fact that the stage is now faster on ALL machines due
  to a few modifications I've made, the A500-users should almost be
  satisfied... hopefully.

   You are hearing from me...  

   BTW- I will make a few modifications to my source and send you the
            new "revised" version.  Nothing major really, just need to
            "beef-up" the audio-feedback in the FinalBossBattle phase...

            I was debating whether to bother or not, but since you aren't
            able to do anything yet I might as well "fix" this lacking.
            It can only make the final game a bit better.

  
      Take  care,

Hey all, 
How goes it? I have a simple non-amos related question.
Has anyone ever heard of any non-AGA A1200's ever being made?
I have never EVER been able to play any AGA games on mine..
I can view HAM8 images and set up for 256 colors at once.. but 
I could never play AGA games.. my screen gets all garbled.
Any clues?

	Current status: Slow progression.  Very slow what with Christmas and all
that other stuff messing everyone around and being dead boring.  There WILL be
an intro anim, no matter what happens.  I just hope it'll end up long enough to
be used.

Ok, next code update will be with you shortly, unless there are any changes to
be made, along with new level design.  You'll like some of the new animation.

One thing that would make all of us wake up, is another demo release, from
anyone !

 Hi all,

 I am extending my offer for free SOUNDTRACK music (meaning I must have access to all 4 channels). 

 I am especially good at moody (atmospheric) songs and of course, fast music (especially techno), but I can handle most other types.

 Also, if you need any soundfx, just give me a buzz, now that I have my digitizer going (I already have in excess of 50 meg of sound fx).

 Speech etc, but don't expect me to make a song with somebody singing in it, unless your paying for the singer :)

 Jamie Bentley

 P.S: Still need a programmer for Qwak 2 - Return of the Duckies

I've added your extension to the extensionlist at my site, if you'd like to
see what slots are used and for what you can always drop by :))

>A Problem 1: How to return a string from a routine (and change it's 
>length) from it, the string is in the extension

>dc.w TheLength

You need to ask for memory and then build the right structure, when looking
at the string the first 2 bytes (word) holds the length of the string, then
at the 3rd byte the string itselve starts. You can see this by trying to
define a string in AMOS and then do a Deek(Varptr(W$)-2), that'll return
the 'len'..

Here's a way to do it:
 First you ask for the stringspace (needed length in both d3 & d0)

                                        ;Ask for string space...
        and.w   #$FFFE,d3               * Only EVEN!
        addq.w  #2,d3
        Rjsr    L_Demande
        lea     2(a1,d3.w),a1
        move.l  a1,HiChaine(a5)
        move.l  a0,STa_d(pc)            * Store adress     
        move.w  d0,(a0)+                * Store length

 Now the structure-adress of the new string is placed in a locale 
 data-area to be returned to the caller, and the room for the string
 itselve is pointed by a0, be carefull not to swap these as they differs
 by 2 bytes !!!!..
 Then create the string with the first character starting in the adress
 pointed by a0, and end your procedure with:

        move.l  STa_d(pc),d3            ;Stringadress
        moveq.l #2,d2                   ;Returning a string
        rts

 (Remeber to clean up the stack BEFORE you put this, I'd forgotten once,
 and the same bug can be found in the IO_devices 2.0)

 That should return the string to the caller..

---

>Problem 2: How to get a pointer from the extension in assembler, 
>typically i want the pointer for a variable, same as Varptr(variable) and 
>pointer for an array, same as Varptr(var(array))

I havn't got a clue, I've been looking for a solve for the same problem
some time. I think it's hidden somewhere in the include files that
comes with AMOSPro.. Unfortunaly they're not very well documented..

---

>Hope that all peoples understanding my bad english (I'm swedish)...And 
>those people who don't like the assembler language.

And I'm danish, so that isn't much better :)

I am in need of about 2 megs of file storage space, at a FTP site.
Does anyone know of a good place to store files that can be
downloaded (FTP) I tried Tripod but they won't download from
there, because it's not an FTP site, AMINET is nothing but a
nightmare anymore, it's always down, or so slow it makes connecting
very hard, any help would be apreciated.
Mush's site is only on at certain hours of the day, so it's out of the
question also.

Hmm.. so I take it this is an _urgent_ need? What exactly for?

Au contrare! (sp?.. On the contrary!) I have (and use) an account with
Tripod (and Geocities for storage). They both have FTPs (my pages and
website are on Tripod and have been for quite some time). Who says they
have no FTP? (ftp.tripod.com, btw) I use it all the time! (hehe, and it's
_quite_ more reliable, -etc.- than Geocities I might add..)

Tripod (and Geocities, ick) both offer 2M of free space (just what you
need? hehe), however Geocities doesn't really like (or condone) the use of
their free space for storage (which is why I don't unless needed).

Yea, you could say that about Aminet (of course some of the UK mirrors
aren't _TOO_ bad compared to wustl). As for Mush's FTP, I think he's
working on getting a dedicated (extra) phone line for it, so as to keep it
up around the clock 24-7 (you'll have to talk to him about the specifics).

Greetings.

Well, the Holiday Break is over (for me anyhow), and now I have to get back
to work and my studies, SO, that means for a week or two (for a bit), I
won't be able to spend as much time on CBATNAM as I'd like, but don't fret:
I'm going to be getting to it as soon as possible (and, later this week,
will be sending some updates on what's been happening in the Dungeon, hehe)

For Keith and Mush (who's been away, when's he going to be back anyhow?):
I'm going to get those graphics to you (screenshots for Mush and MIB shots
for Keith). It would be easiest to get these to you on IRC (whilst chatting
about them, explaining anything that you have any questions about, i.e.
anything else you need). This means you guys telling me what times during
the week are convient for you to be on (preferably around the same time).

Sidenote: I've noticed there's not been much activity on the List lately
(in the past few days, after the Holidays). What's going on here?

When am I on IRC ?  Good question.  Maybe I should map out an activity table
from the logs or something.  It tends to be when I get a chance, so around
7am, 4pm, 6pm, midnight, or 3am or another time at complete random.  All times
UK..  ;-)

   AMOS doesn't directly support this due to Amiga palettes being
   register-based.  If you had a hi-color videocard then it should be
   possible, but then AMOS still wouldn't directly support that either...

   So, you have two (or three) real options:

   1. Use a larger palette and use different color-ranges for the
       different parts of the screen.  For example, if you wanted to fade 
       each quarter of the screen independantly, you could use say
       a 32-color palette and allocate 8 colors for each quarter-screen
       section...
      ----------------
      |  A      B  |
      |  C      D  |
      ----------------

      if you only use colors 1-7 for A, colors 8-15 for B, colors 16-23
      for C and colors 24-31 for D then you can simply use the fade
      command to fade in each section according to the colors used in
      that section.

 2.  A twist on this if you only need to seperate the screen vertically,
      then of course you can open multiple screens and fade each
      independantly (or horizontal sections of each screen seperately
      using the above technique).


3.   Finally, you could generate a light-table consisting of color-
      references for each light-level: HUE_LT(ColorReg#, lightlevel) and
      actually remap the pixels in the rectangular area according to
      this light-table.

      You could use a simple palette-matching algorithm to build the
      LT, but the best results would probably be from hand-coded
      color-entries.
 
      The problem with this method is it will be quite slow in AMOS as
      the FadeArea routine would need to rely on Point/Plot to actually
      redraw the screen as it "fades"...

      This is similar to the way I implemented fading in my first IBM
      programming (QBasic) as I used EGA-mode which has a fixed
      16-color palette. If you take a look on my webpage, you can find
      the source (in ASCII) which might be helpful if you are interested
      in this light-table method. 



      Take  care,

I've come across this on my travels. I don't think it's called AMOS as
such but its title is an acronym (I hope that's the word I'm looking
for!) so it should be A.M.O.S. which wouldn't infringe on copyright.

»->  Sorry to anybody who mails me after this, you won't get free music you'd

Im always on the lookout for artists sending me interesting Mushroom PD
logo's, and could do with some new ones for Extreme AMOS (hint to all  ;))

Try running the GUI SENSITIVE OFF command before opening any windows, this

I usually leave it turned off.

How could one be so assinine as to post someting like this to
alt.religion.amiga and alt.religion.amos ?

The people there are trying to get away from spam. They do not need,

It was on the night of 01-Jan-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Troy jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting
about "HTTP digest" until I was forced to knock them out:

Hmm, this is a bad idea if it wont support Amiga browsers. One of the
output functions of my mailinglist manager, is to create either single
mails, or a "digest" which can be made in either plain text, or HTML
format. It was designed for very high traffic lists.

Ive added the HTML version to the PD library and will look at it tonight on
Ibrowse, then releqase a version with my program to compare the difference.

Hello Amos listers.


This is to let you know that in my latest upload to Aminet, I've included
the Amos Pro source code for it.

The program is called Mouse Maze, and it's a sort of artificial-inteligence
experiment. It tries to find it's way around a maze.

I've uploaded to Aminet, but there seems to be a problem on Aminet at the
moment, so you're probably better off visiting my homepage at
http://village.vossnet.co.uk/c/champion/  -  all my programs can be
downloaded from there as well.

Also (relatively) new is HAL9001, another AI program, but much more
interesting. It tries to build coherent and gramatically correct sentences
from a dictionary of words input by the user.


If you want to get hold of the Amos source code for any of the other
programs I've written (or am writing), feel free to ask.  (I will probably
want something for it tho...!).

MouseMaze source is absolutely free. Enjoy.


Best regards to you all.


     Simon "Spudley" Champion.


PS: Mush - if you want to take any of these progs for your Amos archive,
feel free to d/l them from my homepage (or Aminet).

I've since fixed the problem with the Amiga Browesers.  Yes ... It was
MY FAULT... I read the HTML book wrong.  Anyway - I won't upload and
double the work if you are going to publish in HTML.  I only saw text
files and when downloaded and opened it was very agravating to plow
through all those headers and such to finaly get to the meat of the
message.  HTMLDigest takes all that out and you just see who it is
from the date, and subject.  If you want to read it - click on the

On Tuesday 13-Jan-98 at 08:45:50, a nutter named Mush
had wet pants when they typed about `Re: GOOD Programmer Wanted+Other.. QWAK 2
productions starts'.

>The programmer of the game would require more than 10% of te overall monies

while

>Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett

I  agree  with  what you say Mush. I just didn't wanna be the first to
say it m8 :)

After  all,  would  any  of the list guys work on a project (coding it
all) for a measly 10%???

I  realise  that there is other guys to pay (Musicians/Gfx/Admin etc),
but surely 10% for a programmer is pretty low?

Maybe  if  this  Team  17 (I thought they had left our Amiga!) project
will be a BIG payer though???

Andy Gee!

 Pity your incorrect Mush...

 The programmer now receives 25%, AND I'm doing most of the work, they simply make the engine, I'm doing the gfx, level design, music, sound, distribution, plot, licenses, animations (3d ones) and I'm also handling one or two other things.

 NOW who'd be sitting back doing almost nothing? Keep in mind there are 80 levels, 8 different types of landscapes, 16 different backgrounds, in excess of 500 frames of animation in the characters alone, not to forget the 3d animated segments, which will be massive in themselves, I'm also handling remapping, the A1200 version and disk-mashing.

 Anybody else WANT TO TRY PICK ME OFF?

 Okay Alastair, you don't get jack.

 Sorry, put that the wrong way :) You still have to program NUKES, which I sent you the gfx, the music, and a heap of other tidbits, plus a PILE of text files with them, and a description of everything, and you haven't even got CLOSE to starting that, oh yeah, I want AT LEAST 30fps scrolling on  NUKES.

It was on the night of 15-Jan-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Jens jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting
about "AMOS on the WEB.." until I was forced to knock them out:
»-> Hello..

»-> As I'm rewriting my entire set of homepages to frames, I'm also shuffeling
»-> the links section around. So does anyone have some AMOS related sites that
»-> they'd like me to add to the list.. If you've got a banner you'd like to 
»-> show as a link to your page then let me know the URL too...

I went to your AMOS extension pages, and had a look around. Its a good idea to
have placed there, but its Wayyyyyy to bloated. Plus, the frames version
doesnt display on the Amiga Ibrowse (at least not on my regged version) and I
had to type in the full URL manually to get on the pages. Also, the CRAFT
download link on one of them goes to stars, rather than CRAFT.

Seeing as you will be changing the pages, wouldnt it be good to reduce the way
you are displying the stuff on the screen? Why take a full browser screen to
display a bit of info, where you could just as easily place another table
inside there, and use all of the screen, rather than just the left side. Just
some comments, no offense meant.

Hmmm, very demanding arent you! 30FPS isnt exactly the most easy of tasks to

Well, the mail you sent to the list said 10%, or do you wish to still
contest this? I didnt mean to say you were doing nothing (or do you not
know the true meaning of the word Pun?).

excess
»-> of 500 frames of animation in the characters alone, not to forget the 3d
»-> animated segments, which will be massive in themselves, I'm also handling
»-> remapping, the A1200 version and disk-mashing.

Let me get this straight, you have to do this stuff all on your own? If you
have secured a game contract from Team 17, you should be able to get any
musician or GFX artist on the case for free of charge, it goes without
saying as they will offer you any services to finish the game they so
desire want.

Also, was it my imagination, or had Team 17 finished with the Amiga some
time back?

Who's picking you off?

about "Re: HTTP digest" until I was forced to knock them out:

»-> I've since fixed the problem with the Amiga Browesers.  Yes ... It was

Feel free to upload the HTML archives, but all I suggest is you add the month
AND year in the archive, so in years to come, people wont get mixed up. Oh
yeah, best place them all in a folder with the Month and year too, as there is
nothing worse than unpacking an archive into a root drawer, only to discover
it places them all in no folder of its own, hehehe. Just gonna check your
archive version...

Ok, back. Dear oh dear, its extremely basic. Why are you using Thor, of all
things, to make the files? Why not just use AMOS instead of an AREXX script.

First thing I did, was load in the massive HTML file, which still has a lot
of HTML errors in it I may add, and decided that the file was way too big
to be using as a digest file anyhow, especilally people to low-spec
machines (the browser window buffer size would be too great). It did have
some nice looks on it though, which improved the index.html file layout,
which serves the user a lott better.

My program will format itself completely different, provide more info
on-screen, as well as some cute GFX, index files, and other bits and pieces
to make it look more presentable. I would like to try and put together the
one for January if thats OK, as I have a copy of all the files anyhow for
when I post them all to the newsgroup.

If January's test is successfull, I shall convert all the files from the
last 5 years to the HTML format and upload them. Anyone has any comments or
suggestions, feel free to contact me.

»-> After  all,  would  any  of the list guys work on a project (coding it

No way, like I said earlier, at least 20% of whats left after paying everyone
else, as the programmer does the hardest part of the program (and has to put
up with all the nagging!!)

»-> I  realise  that there is other guys to pay (Musicians/Gfx/Admin etc),
»-> but surely 10% for a programmer is pretty low?

If the game is being produced by Team 17 and he has signed his contract, then
Team17 should be offering him this help for free. I know sadeness help Paul
Burkey out a bit with Foundation, so I guess they must have to help to get
their stuff on the shelves.

»-> Maybe  if  this  Team  17 (I thought they had left our Amiga!) project
»-> will be a BIG payer though???

Thats what I had heard (and thought I read). Must be a damn good Amiga game (a
major milestone for AMOS too) if its going to bring them back!!

Do tell us more, Jamie!

Yeah, im offering true FTP login accounts for free, and at the moment, im not
charging (and the space is unlimited). In about a months time, im buying yet
another house phoneline, so will be online almost 24 hours a day. I will be
also officially opening my WWW server very soon too, and may begin offering
free web pages to the lucky few.

If your interested in an account, let me know.

I was trying to combat this problem with my large Mailinglist program, so a
popular list could set it for say, 10,000 entries, or just 100, depending on
its popularity.

Every attempt ive made at using any kind of command line, or tooltype value
with SET BUFFER (even on the very first line) doesnt work, as it will only
seem to accept a true numeric value.

The test version of the GUI extension (which is due for public release not
too long from now) fully handles AGA and any graphics card screenmodes
selectable in an ASL screenmode requester. It blows away the OS Devkit, and
all the others!!

The GUI extension allows you to change the colours of any screenmode, just
as easily, if not easier, than regular AMOS screens. Keep your eyes peeled
for the new public release!!

»-> I've also heard that the next version of GUI is capable of opening AGA

Its true. I can send a compiled demo if you want. I have one here which
demonstrates the use of bobs on an intuition screen (about 650/sec on a 32
colour Superhires-Interlaced screen).

Try running the GUI SENSITIVE OFF command before opening any windows, this 
should set it to the default topaz fonts. If you have it on, the system tries 
to adjust itself to your WB enviroment, and it doesnt always work too well, so 
I usually leave it turned off.

I am not 100% sure about this as I usually have trouble with it but I think 
after you have done INIT, click on the variable you want to watch in the top 
window and it will be displayed in the bottom window and updated when it 
changes.

(or at least thats the theory - whenever I try it I usually get an error 
along the lines of 'Unable to resolve variable.)

The monitor V1.0 was full of bugs - it was rewritten for V2.0. As far
as I remember if you want it to display a value you click on the VAL
button then on the expression itself in the code. Some things it
can't/won't evaluate. I never use the monitor so I'm afraid I'm not
much more help to you.

Hello..

As I'm rewriting my entire set of homepages to frames, I'm also shuffeling
the links section around. So does anyone have some AMOS related sites that
they'd like me to add to the list.. If you've got a banner you'd like to 
show as a link to your page then let me know the URL too...

NB: I'm changing the URL to the amos-extension pages, so if anyone is
linking direct to those they have to search down the new URL.. (I can't
tell you yet, as I don't know how I'm putting them down..)

Happy greetings, Yours..

   Now, that's more like it!!

   Sounds like a LOT of work.  Obviously, this is a HUGE project for
   one or two people to undertake.  Other than offering their previous
   support-files (gfx, music, etc) and the QWAK name, are Team17
   involved at all in this project?  Will they be publishing it??  Also,
   you mentioned something about "in excess of $1000 according to
   Team17's accountants."  That was for the programmer being paid
   10%, so I assume the estimate is now that the programmer will be
   receiving $2,500, correct?

   Hmmm... an extra $2,500 would almost tempt me to take a shot at
   this, if I wasn't in the process of building my own Budgetware
   (Amiga/PC) business...


>  Anybody else WANT TO TRY PICK ME OFF?

   That's not very productive... 

   Some people were talking about the first AMOS-list game being
   "too small and too simple", so this might be the perfect opportunity
   for a second AMOS-list game. 

   You have Team 17's name, HUGE gfx/animation requirements,
   an estimated $10,000 profits from the final sales... if the idea of
   combining AMOS with a commercial game backed by Team17
   isn't enough to motivate you guys, maybe a chunk of that cash
   will be...


      Take  care,

It was on the night of 16-Jan-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was 
silent. Suddenly, Declan_Gorman@modusmedia.com jumped out from behind a rock 
and wouldnt stop shouting about "AMOS Pro & Arexx" until I was forced to knock 
them out:

I have an IRC bot here written with the AMOS Arexx commands if you want it to 
look at.

 Okay,

 1) Team 17 have almost nothing to do with the project, all they have to do with it is they let me use the name Qwak (and all things related to it).

 2) Team 17 will not distribute it.

 3) The programmer receives 25% of the total amount sold.

 4) Any confusion about people who want to try out for the job will have to realise the following:

 This game will take up *around* 5 meg, when NOT compressed.
 The finished product must NOT look like an AMOS production (do anything    possible to hide this fact).
 There are three different title tunes, loaded randomly when the game starts.
 Since I'm creating the enormous amount of levels (well, me and a small team, god forbid), the level editor should be fairly easy to get to grips with.
 Because there is no scrolling, there should be no problems with speed.
 The title tunes are in MED, but the in-game music is in protracker 3 channels, which you can freely convert into ABK if you wish (provided when a sound is played it KEEPS going, instead of stopping).
 Aproxomatly 20 colours are reserved for the sprites/bobs (or about 18 I think), and the last lot are for the back ground.

 Some Backgrounds WILL HAVE TO BE animated (simply stuff, like clouds slowly drifting across the screen).

 The entire palette will have to change when the Ducks use their egglaunchers, when the egg hits, the screen will brighten by around 50%, giving it the impression it was  a powerful blast.
 None of the files can be larger than 1.2 meg, because it won't compress onto a disk very well.
 Over the forground (the GROUND) sprites, there will be background sprites, which don't affect anything. (Adds more to the look of the game).
 Well, their the things that just it CAN'T be without. Oh, and at LEAST a 25fps frame rate :)

 I'll think of little touches as I continue making the graphics. Please note, that, all of the title tunes have singing, so they won't be smaller than 300k, and I'll try keep them under 600.

 Any questions?

 Alastair: I'll take up your offer, you can program Qwak.

 ANYBODY want to program NUKES? Its like Scorched tanks, onyl with better graphics, better sound, better music, better playability, more new ideas, faster, up to 16 tanks at once controlled by only 4 players and will need muliple layers of background. This will be a PD production.

Oh yes, frames do work, just your text file doesnt appear in the frame, just
the "permanantly under construction" bit, and nothing else whatsoever, even
after loading the 58K file. I think you missed a tag off the table, which is
preventing it from being shown.

Good idea  =)

Hmm, I wouldnt say for certain, but I do get a fair few visitors to my pages a
day. I would like to add other AMOS-related features to it, to give the user a
more enjoyable stay, but dont always have the time. Anyone have an interesting
idea they want to try out?

   You mean this isn't it?!  I think you could easily consider this
   AMOS-list to be the center of all that is AMOS...

   First, we have our debates, discussions and Q&A-sessions... most
   having something to do with AMOS, of course.

   Second, this is where the first worldwide, totally AMOS-oriented,
   multi-game-engine, action-packed, multi-programmer driven AMOS
   game was developed.

   Third, by looking at the signatures of the posted messages, you can
   find loads of AMOS-oriented websites (or at least pages).

   By doing this, I discovered Mush's, Giark's, Murray's, Keith's, Ben's
   (Wyatt), Adam's and many other fantastic websites all of which 
   have (or at least had) some AMOS-oriented pages/files, etc.
   

   Yes, I think this must be the center of all that is AMOS...


      Take  care,

Well, I haven't made the announcement yet (had planned to wait a few more
days), but I guess now's the best time to tell it: I'm (or _have been_)
redoing my webpages as well (taking time from programming over this past
weekend to do them), as they haven't been updated since last August (eek!)
and there's some pages I never finished and sections never added (ah!).

You can go ahead and ADD my website to your listing of links (the URL is in
my sig below). Go ahead and add the banner as well if you want (mail me
privately for either a URL, the banner, or both). Thanks again.

So _NOW_, all the sudden, YOUR doing everything?? Hmm.. just wondering. The
pay cut increase to 25% is an inticing incentive, but what's left to do in
the game (since you have taken over what _appears_ to be the rest of it?)

The game sounds like it'll be cool, btw, and I hope it does good. As
Garfield asked, does Team17 have any involement in this project (or any
other future projects you have planned, or both)? I also take it that the
$10,000 sales projection is just a planning figure.

I think _SOMEBODY_ needs to (better before I do).

Well, if you use AMOS for _any_ length of time, (and try your hand at
tackling any big projects), your BOUND to have some problems eventually. :)

No problem. Some of those here on the List can identify with you. ;)

Well, there is no _OFFICIAL_ AMOS homepage, but there are a few (I'm one of
them). I'd say Mush's PD pages would have to be one of the most popular
(and biggest at the moment, although mine are getting close to being as big
if not bigger after my updates!) I have a listing of many (if not most)
GOOD AMOS homepages (most of their creators-maintainers are on the List).

It's good enough to get started looking around on if you want (I'm not sure
if anyone here has a complete comprehensive listing of ALL of the AMOS
sites out there, but I'm sure most of the good ones would be on the List).

Give me a private mailing for any specifics on it.

   Haha...  sorry about that.  I'm the one who started that confusion. I
   assumed the programmer's 10% amounted to $1,000 which would
   have made the total estimated profits at $10,000 and increasing the
   programmer's cut to 25% would obviously increase that $1,000 to
   $2,500...


>  Yeah, the first qwak didn't even make that much.

   The first QWAK didn't even make $10,000????  I've talked with PC
   shareware authors who are earning over $20,000 on one product
   (for the first quarter). Granted this is for their best product... their
   poorest products average a modest $500 (for the first quarter)...

   Are you sure they aren't estimating 1,000 sales (as in copies sold)
   instead of $1,000?


      Take  care,

Ya, but what I think our friend was referring to was a _WEBSITE_ (am I
right?) that was the "center" of AMOS (or an Official AMOS page).
Since my last mailing on this subject, I forgot to tell him that
there is a newly-created AMOS Webring (by our friend Skid a Vis), btw.

> First, we have our debates, discussions and Q&A-sessions...
> most having something to do with AMOS, of course.

True.. I'd have to vouch for all these (especially debates, hehe, as
we've had quite a few since I joined; I will refrain from naming names).

> Second, this is where the first worldwide, totally
> AMOS-oriented, multi-game-engine, action-packed,
> multi-programmer driven AMOS game was developed.
True again.. which will be out sooner or later, btw.. ;)

> Third, by looking at the signatures of the posted messages,
> you can find loads of AMOS-oriented websites (or at least pages).
For those few observant ones on the List, hehe.

> By doing this, I discovered Mush's, Giark's, Murray's, Keith's,

As I've notified the List of my sites updating, it will include many more
AMOS oriented pages (as well as those that weren't added; Amiga AND AMOS).

> Yes, I think this must be the center of all that is AMOS...
What can I say? It _could_ be.. definitely the only MAILING list..

      Hello Everyone.

      This isn't really AMOS-oriented, but...

      As you may know I am venturing into Budget-Software
      Development on the Amiga and PC.  My first title will be a much
      enhanced version of StarStrike2000 and is already underway.

      I'd like to form a small "Idea Group" with other developers.
      Basically, so we could just throw some ideas around, and have
      an all round good ol' fashioned brain-storming session or (better
      for e-mail), take part in a "pass the pot" cycle.

      This "IdeaGroup" would deal with issues such as concept and
      design, and all the subjective aspects that must be dealt with
      before we can proceed to the implementation phase. Think of it
      as a lot of BSing that hopefully produces some interesting
      game-designs, expands and solidifies raw "ideas", provides new
      twists on old play-mechanics/genres, etc.        

      I particularly would be interested in working with my CBATNAM
      team-mates in this "Idea Group" (lame name I know - Creative
      Consultants is better), but the offer is open to anyone...

      It really shouldn't be too time-consuming and if we could get
      five or six people involved in this, I'm sure it would be both
      interesting and productive.

      If you're interested, please reply to me directly...


      THANKS!!!!

 Hello all, once again.

 Qwak 2 will soon be in the hands of Alastair Murrary to program, and while he's programming that, I'm buying a few copyrights on the name for a game which has yet to be disclosed :)

 Anyway, it will be a Monkey Island type game, with the 12 disks worth of graphics and story lining etc, but I want an editor for the game, but it can't be distributed to anybody else, only the finished compiled product (the end game).

 While the actual editor must remain in only the programmer and my hands, since releasing it would be a bit of pain, as it would simply erase the amount of money that I would make. 

 It would need to be able to play protracker tunes, work in 64 EHB 320x256 (56 pixels for the playing menu), and have all those little touchesthat Monkey Island has, like when you select something, it recomends what to do (if you right click it will do it... IE: If you move the pointer over a door and click the right mouse button, it will try open it).

 I  would also need to be able to create "ground areas" where the player can and can't walk, mulitple layers of bobs so they can  walk behind objects, and a good scripting system.

 The Programmer will get a standard 25% of the profits made, since me and a small team are writing the plot, while I'm doing the graphics and the  music.

 Any questions?

 Jamie Bentley

Hey guys. Don't stop reading now, but don't you think it's time for an AMOS 
port for PC:s? Seriously, The Amiga is a wonderfull machine and all but you 
must admit it's not THAT popular anymore. And the AMOS programming 
language is far to important to sink with the amiga (Okay, I know most of you 
say the amiga will rise again and sure, if it did I would be the first to start writing 
Amiga AMOS extensions again but until it does...)
   You know... When a guy with a PC want's to start programming he gets to 
choose between QuickBasic, which is deadly boring and almost unusable for 
any form of graphics programming, or Klik and Play, which is not programming 
at all. (You seriously don't learn programming from drag dropping your mouse 
for an hour.) Am I completetly wrong? Is there no interest whatsoever for a 
PC-Amos? Well, If I am not, do you think it would be possible to get the 
source from Mandarin Software (Or whoever owns it now) or do you think it 
would be easier to rewrite the whole thing. Or, am I possibly to late? Is there 
already some sort of PC-Amos port? Please mail me your opinions (or post 
'em right here for that matter...)

Hi Erik,

Europress  were  (reformed  name, no longer Manderin) resposnsible for
Amos and I have a contact who works at Europress.

In  fact,  many  of  the list members may also know of him. Lee Bamber
anyone?  Relics  Of  Deldroneye?  Yup,  good  old  Lee  got a job with
Europress  a  couple  of  years  back.  Apparantly  he helped out with
development with Klick N Play too.

Anyway,  Europress  have  `NO' plans to release Amos for the PC (or an
Amiga  update).  Even  the  source code has been held back. Dunno why?
There were rumours that it was gonna be released to Amiga PD some time
back, but methinx that was just a Myth!

When  Europress moved to the PC, they took all the ideas from Amos and
created  Klick N Play. A pile of crap (for those of you who have tried
it, for those who haven't - don't!)

Klick N Play was a flop! You mainly get it bundled FREE with some PC's
now. It's only of use to spotty kids wanting to impress their other PC
friends with rude words on their games!

Anyway,  Europress  never  give  up  and  when  an update for Amos was
required, we got Easy Amos and then Amos Pro, what did the PC get?

Ahem...The  Games Factory. This is just another Klick N Play, but with
added features and gfx to use etc. Still a pile of pooh.

I  firmly  believe that Europress would have already released Amos for
the PC (maybe called PCOS) by now. After all, Klick N Play flopped and
The Games Factory isn't doing much better....so I assure you that Amos
is NOT an option at present.

So  what  are  Europress'  plans? Guess what? They have now started to
distribute other software house's games! Slamtilt being one of 'em.

Obviously  they  still sell their own products such as Fun School etc.
They  also released a few SONG BOOK titles. BLUR and OASIS. These CD's
hold  titles,  words,  music,  video  etc  of the bands mentioned. Yet
again, another Europress pile of crap!

Budget  software  galore  is  being  released on PC though. As I said,
mainly  from  other  houses, just distributed by Europress. Nothing to
write home about...yet!

Most  of  these  titles (about 10UKP each) sell in bargain buckets. No
box  or  manual, just a CD case and the inset. Nothing of quality ever
shone through in any Europress releases apart from Amos for the Amiga.

They  had  a  good  product  and  a good user base. Sure, they must be
making a fortune on the PC distributing everyone elses titles now, but
they will NEVER have as good a product (of their own) as they did with
Amos on the Amiga. That is a fact.

If you don't believe me, check out their web site. I think it's:

                  www.europress.co.uk

(search for europress if it's not and you'll get there....)

Go  into  any software shop such as Electronic Boutique, Game, Dixons,
Currys,  Comet,  Toys  R  Us,  PC  World  etc...you  will find lots of
Eurporess  stuff  for PC at bargain prices and I for one hope that you
will NEVER find Amos!

It's  an  Amiga  product  (ahem,  well,  ST to begin with I guess) and
should  stay  that way. It wouldn't be right if PC owners had anything
like this.

I  have  been  using  Amos for years and it's one bit of software that
keeps me from buying a PC and ditchin' my Miggy! If PC's did get Amos,
how many peeps would buy a PC? I might, but I don't wanna!!!

The  Amiga  is  now going uphill and maybe, just maybe, Europress will
see  fit  to  re-release  Amos in an update. But I have to ask myself,
should  we  really  support this software house after they left all us
Amos users alone with no updates for so long....?

I  wonder just how much money Europress would want for the rights (and
source) for Amos Pro?

How  many  peeps  are on this Amos List? Maybe we could all throw in a
few  quid  and  buy  it  ourselves?  Now  that  would  be nice....keep
dreaming....I guess....

Anyway guys, I'm typing a lot here, so I'd better sign off and let you
get back to your production(s) I guess.

Guess what...I think I have something already that might fit the bill.
The editor i use for my RPG system can do all that, and it produces text
files which can easily be read, and interpreted, by any program other than
mine.  A few small changes can be made to fit your exact needs, but, other
than that, it can do the following:

  * Draw, and compress, bobs in the editor (another util takes Amos bob
banks and compresses them externally)
  * Allow up to 256 zones on a screen of any size that players can bump
into, start scripts, or, in your case, allow clicking on for info.
  * Allow up to 64 characters and other bobs on a screen, all animated as
they walk using special FrameSets to define animations up to 10 frames
long.
  * 64 EHB screens are de facto for games like this, and the editor
already has this built-in.  Plus, screens are super-compressed, just like
the bobs, so they take up no space at all.
  * Compression is Spack, plus XPK Nuke, which does a eal number on images
(a 200000 byte bob bank becomes 100000 when Spacked, 50000 when Nuked
also)
  * Bob optimization, resulting in smaller Bob bank sizes (but not smaller
compressed file sizes) so they take less memory when running.

I'll even let you use my bob FrameSet animation and cacheing routines.
What do you day?

I think it's in the Turbo+ extension:
Vbl Wait Y 
where Y is the position of the raster beam (I think that's what you
call it - the beam that zips around the screen updating it) so by
waiting until that is at a certain pos you can wait between 0-Vbl. Of
course I'm probably wrong on this or confusing it with something else
but it's early in the morning - you understand!

Ello.
Prospector Pete is nearly finished (MYST held it up over chrissy).
One problem though:-
I need a delay which I can vary in length. Easy enough although the 
delay must be between 0 and a Vbl.
Vbl being the maximum allowable time delay.
At the mo I am drawing a box off screen somewhere a variable amount 
of times, there must be a more elegant and time constant way of doing 
this.

I'm assuming this was posted to the list, but if it wasn't (it ended up
in my "In-Box"), I'm still replying to the list as there seems to be a
lot of interest in this subject and this is the closest thing I've found.
I'm also on the Allegro mailing list (PC C/Allegro developers) and one
of the projects being developed should be of interest to you guys...

   Well, no the Amiga isn't mainstream anymore...

   I'm not sure about that... there are loads of languages available for
   the PC.  Personally, I prefer C/Allegro over anything...

   I think it would be far easier to visit the following website:
   http://www.games.ndirect.co.uk/

   Once you've arrived, click on the "The Game Creator" link.  In case
   you're curious about what you'll find, "The Game Creator" sounds
   vaguely familiar... doesn't it?

Hi all! :-)

First of all... Sorry if I'm asking a lot of stupid questions which
you all probably know the answers to!!! :-/
(Are there any AMOS FAQ?)

I use AMOS Pro, uppdated to version 2.0, and the compiler.
(No extentions loaded.)

- Is there a bug in the Parallel commands? As soon as I use
  Parallel Get, Parallel Send... the computer goes stone dead!!! :-(

- Is there an AGA extention? If there is, where do I get it / the
  best one?

- How do I got Amiga-M to work with my AMOS programs?

- How good is Blitz Basic? Is it a big difference from AMOS?

- Can I include C and / or assembler source and / or compiled
  programs into my AMOS programs in any way?

- Are there any programming language similar to AMOS on the
  PC? Or any header file for C with AMOS similar commands?
  (I'm not talknig about Windows crap now :-))

- Are there any good extensions for music? For example
  something to play modules better?

- How do I create extentions? Are there any guide/instruction
  for this?

- Are the bob routines reely this bad??? Yesterday I changed
  the background under a bob (with a bar) and then moved the
  bob... guess what happened... nothing (exept a small flicker
  the backgound was just the same as before). I then tried
  pasting the bob before... what happened then??? nothing
  exept that irritating flicker again!!! :-(
  Finally I just went back to the sprite I had used earlier...
  (and got less colours) no problems!
  Are there any extention or something with better routines?

Poouh... Oki... time to catch some breath... Sorry for taking
up your time... but I reely hope you have the answers to my
questions! :-)

Thanks in advance! :-)

Have a nice day and good luck with your programming!!! :-)

   Any GOOD PaintProgram will have a "Grab" option which will
   allow you to easily grab a Workbench-screenshot. 

   If you don't have a decent PaintProgram (how do you get by), I
   can go into BLITZ and throw together a simple one for you (time
   permitting of course)...

   Right now, I'm about to launch PersonalPaint and work on a new
   "baddie" (copyrighted term for enemy appearing in developer's
   latest project)...

Hello.  I'll take a few of these questions...


> - How good is Blitz Basic? Is it a big difference from AMOS?

   Go to my webpage (see below in my signature). Click on the
   AMIGA-link then click on the AMOS-link.  Download the archive
   containing "the AMOS&BLITZ demos".  It's nothing spectacular,
   but it will allow you to see first hand how well the two languages
   perform.  Also, you can read my views of AMOS and BLITZ (go
   to the BLITZ-page).


> - Can I include C and / or assembler source and / or compiled
>   programs into my AMOS programs in any way?

   Source, no.  Executable, yes.  BLITZ allows inclusion of both
   source and excutable Asm.  Also very easy to convert from C to
   BLITZ...


> - Are there any programming language similar to AMOS on the
>   PC? Or any header file for C with AMOS similar commands?
>   (I'm not talknig about Windows crap now :-))

   See message I posted to list VERY recently: 
   Subject:"If you MUST have AMOS for PC then READ THIS!!"
   Hmmm... you are on the AMOS-list, right? If not, and you didn't
   receive that previous message, drop me a quick line and I'll give
   you the URL for a PC AMOS...

   If you want to use C then check out the Allegro game library. It
   contains loads of powerful commands for MIDI, WAV playing,
   bitmaps, palettes, sprites, scrolling, etc.  It really "ROCKS!!!"

   Go to my IBMclone page and you can download two simple demos
   I created with C/Allegro:CrzyStar and BOBdemo.


> - Are the bob routines reely this bad??? Yesterday I changed
>   the background under a bob (with a bar) and then moved the
>   bob... guess what happened... nothing (exept a small flicker
>   the backgound was just the same as before)...

   Well, the bobs might be considered "bad"... but, that's not the
   cause of your problem. Chances are, you're trying to do the above
   without shutting down AMOS's automatic bob-update system.
   Try something like this (after opening your screen and in place of
   your current "loop"):

   Double Buffer : Autoback 0 : Bob Update Off 
   Amal Off : Synchro Off : Sprite Update Off : Flash Off
   Rem the first thing I do in my AMOS-coding: Kill all that junk!!

   Now, we can begin...

   ALLDONE=False
   Repeat
      Bob Clear : Rem  ... Remove the Bobs

      Ink Rnd(31) : Rem  ...Select a Random Colour
      Bar 80,100,y1 to 239,155 : Rem ...Draw the Bar

      Rem  Update your Bobs position here...
      Bob Anumber, Xpos, Ypos, AnImageNumber

      Bob Draw : Rem  ...Now Redraw the Bobs
      If  (Fire(0) Or Fire(1)) then ALLDONE=True
      Screen Swap : Wait Vbl
   Until ALLDONE

   The key is to do all your background modifications (in your case,
   using the Bar command) between the Bob Clear and Bob Draw
   statements.

   Hope this helps!!


      Take  care,

Seriously why not just give the Amigas arch nemesis AMOS,AmigaDOS, and of 
course are custom chip set, so thay to can toast more then just bread.

If the PC's gets every thing that makes the Amiga an Amiga why the fuck would
any one buy an Amiga!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

>Hi all! :-)

>First of all... Sorry if I'm asking a lot of stupid questions which
>you all probably know the answers to!!! :-/
>(Are there any AMOS FAQ?)

First of all, I've never seen a stupid question on this list, I've seen
stupid answers :))


>- Is there an AGA extention? If there is, where do I get it / the
>  best one?

There's no direct AGA extension out now, but some alows you to use AGA,
one is the OSDevKit (comercial) but it's a real pain to use. A more decent
choice is the intuition extension, but it don't support palette settings
very well. I know of two that's on the way the GUI extensions is coming
in version 1.63 that should support AGA, and the JADE AGA extension is
currently in Beta-status. Besides an extension known as the 'game extension'
is in the works. Drop by my extension list at my site for more 
information on extensions :)) (Intuition is availeble for download)


>- How do I got Amiga-M to work with my AMOS programs?

You don't, AMOS is NOT using standard intuition screens and can't use the
default keys (you can't use Amiga-N to get to WB from amos). Again some
extensions allow you to use standard Intuition screens (same as the AGA
extensions)..


>- Can I include C and / or assembler source and / or compiled
>  programs into my AMOS programs in any way?

ASM programs and compiled C can be included as either a databank and called
with the 'call' command or they can be included as an procedure in your
program and called like any other procedure..


>- Are there any good extensions for music? For example
>  something to play modules better?

Get hold of the DOOM extension (at mush's or at my site), it's proberly
the best, other extensions like AMCAF (shareware) or SLN (Danish docs)
also holds good protracker players..


>- How do I create extentions? Are there any guide/instruction
>  for this?

See the source-code for the music extension ('tutorial/extensions/music.s'
I think), it contains information on the way it's done, both on the special
file-format, the special commands availeble and how to get/return variables
in your commands..


>Poouh... Oki... time to catch some breath... Sorry for taking
>up your time... but I reely hope you have the answers to my
>questions! :-)

I've left those out I don't know anything about, but as far as I can see
others have dealt with those before..

It was on the night of 21-Jan-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Declan_Gorman@modusmedia.com jumped out from behind a rock
and wouldnt stop shouting about "GUI Hot Links Editor" until I was forced to
knock them out:
»->      
»->      I am having a small problem with this utility, it may sound a bit 
»->      stupid but I can't figure it out.
»->      
»->      I have selected my first Root gadget and the appropiate Link gadget. 

»->      How do I move on to select my next Root gadget?

This is one feature im completely re-writing (with working examples) in the
next guidefile for the release of the public version of the new extension
(very soon) so if you bear with me a couple of days longer, I can send you the
finished text files for this editor.

Except for the dungeon stage `tomorrow for sure', all the stages are done. My
system is without SCSI controller for a while longer, so the CB final assembly

   Well, these are all NON-AMOS related now, so better to move
   them off the list... I'll reply to you personally.

   One note though, the link to "The Game Creator" (PC-AMOS)
   should work fine. It worked for me as well as two others who
   have tried it and wrote back...

Are you setting the maximum/minumum vales using GadToolsBox, or the GUI SET

The final stage is probably going to be completed sometime in 2002. There are
no in between stage pictures. There are no anims.

I haven't heard from Michael yet (the converter guy). I'll call him
tomorrow to see how far he is (considering most tunes are huge big
puslating pod-spawning behemoths).

Anyway, the layout for the tunes is something like this...

|- Title Tune
|- Intro Tune (haven't made this one yet)
|- Highscore Tune
|- No Highscore Tune
|- Credits Tune
|- Level 1 Tunes
|    |- Get Ready
|    |- Life Lost
|    |- Game Over

Seeing that no two tunes are alike, this makes a grand total of 45 tunes.
Now, if anything should be changed or added; let me know and I can squeeze
it in...

Anyway, I'll call him tomorrow. I'll probably give him a hand because it's
hard to find good samples for synthsounds (and I'm still not happy with the
way the Secret tunes sound in PT.. but that's another story :).

Greetings.

Well, I was beginning to wonder if I was _EVER_ going to hear
anything from Giark (for awhile there), CBATNAM-wise namely (hehe).

Hm.. I'm working on it (I'l be sending a short status report to the List in
a bit on what's done, what's not, and last-minute things I'm working on)..

I registered AMCAF about 3 weeks ago (end of the Holidays, _AWESOMELY COOL_
Extension, btw!), and have been talking with Chris about some new drawing
commands. I've done quite a bit of optimizing, and even though it's some
faster, it's not much (although through many tests and additions, there's
quite a bit of improvement.) I'm working up on the logic for the enemies
and objects, and after that's done I'll optimize what I can for those
routines and wait on Chris' turn ups. I will be doing most of (if not all,
unless you say otherwise) pics and at least anims for my level.

> I haven't received any new music (nor most of the music) at this point.
Hm.. me neither, although I _did_ just read EJ's message about the
converting guys hold-ups, although I DO need that music! I won't be
finishing ANYTHING until I can have SOMETHING to test in my level.

> The final stage is probably going to be completed sometime in 2002.
> There are no in between stage pictures. There are no anims.

Hehe, very funny (pardon me while I laugh). It'll be done soon enough (take
my word and say no else). I take it you have Andy Hawkin's (Tekken) level
as well (I just wondered, as I hadn't heard anything from him in quite
awhile, was curious as to where he was. Probably working, unlike us.) :)

Basically, I've been quite busy lately (after the Holidays) doing studies
and other things, but I'm getting right back to it here over the weekend.
Btw, we do have perfectly sliding Wolfenstein doors (w/textures!)! I'll
give a bit more info on this and some other bits in my status update.

Use the GUI SET command with the slider parameters to set the amount of space
available at that time, hence saving the display on the screen:

SLIDER    - Gui Set window,gadget,0,pos (Set Position of Bar)
Gui Set window,gadget,1,sm (Set Minimum Value of Slider)
Gui Set window,gadget,2,mx (Set Max Value of Slider)

Try using the same values in GUI SET, not sure if it will work any better, but
it might:

I know and I humbly apologize for the holdup. I'll work on the Terror music
myself, I had already started making a few patterns.

Anyway, I can't really blame the converter guy for taking a bit longer,
there really are a lot of tunes to cover and he has to go to school during
the daytime. No excuses.. just an explanation.

     Are you setting the maximum/minumum vales using GadToolsBox, or the 
     GUI SET Command?

Ok, i'll try to explain better: my problem is that the slider is not a
gadget by its own, but is part of a listview+arrow up+arrow down + slider;
the Gui Set cmd doesn't allow to set it individually afaik.
May be the only solution is to split the listview into 4 entities??

It was on the night of 23-Jan-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Fabrizio jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop
shouting about "Re: Max value for listview" until I was forced to knock them
out:

If you have a large Listview gadget on the screen, and say, you only wanted to
display 2 items inside it, is this what you mean? The only way I can think of
to do that, would to be physically shorten the array you are copying into it.

Hey, no problem(s). Finish it when you can. :) I was just wondering when
you would have something for testing in my level (not all of it). Anyhow,
no problems, just let me know when you get SOMETHING. Tanks (hehe).

It was on the night of 26-Jan-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, geosync@mail.ozemail.com.au jumped out from behind a rock
and wouldnt stop shouting about "StarFighter Download?" until I was forced to
knock them out:
»-> Hi there all,

»-> Has anyone downloaded the new StarFighter demo and played it yet?  It`s
»-> just that a few people have been having problems with the archives and I
»-> was wondering if anyone else had problems?

I have downloaded the archives for the PD library (took a hell of a long time
for each) and will have a play on it tonight. I can make a link to my FTP site
if you wish, it would certainly speed things up for a lot of places.

For those people who have FTP coounts with me (ones with a real login, not an

Ive installed a web server here and wish to test it a bit to get all the bugs
out of it.

If you dont have an account and would like one, simply send me a username and
password for use in the FTP account, and also if you want a webpage, and if
you want the FTP site available to the public.

Hello..

I'm working on a trackloader in AMOS (for a game-editor), and I need to
reserve the drive while working (just like format and DED does), so
very simple: How do I lock a drive (and marks it as 'busy' to all other
programs running) so I don't get all those blody 'NON-dos-disc-errors'
from the WB and DOpus ???

BTW: How do I unlock it when I'm finished ? :)

Thanx in advance :)

I tried that when I got a bit pissed off with AMOS after spending ages
on Backbone to find AMOS had all sorts of problems that wouldn't let
it work on one persons machine when it was fine on another.

But I found blitz to be even worse. After finally getting the editor
to run without crashing (it conflicted with a commodity) I found all
sorts of terrible problems, the worst being that almost everything
crashed at one point or another, even the very simple examples.

I like AMOS cos its quick. I can just cut out a few GFX and be away in
minutes. It CAN create very good 2D games and even fairly complex ones
with a bit of good programming. I get very annoyed that it isn't
supported any more and therefore has the familiar problems of no aga,
dodgy screens and other bugs but I hope (pray) that some extensions
coming out soon will help this.
I don't have the time to use anything else.

Oh and when is the new GUI extension out?
And is Jade dead now?

      Well, like I said before, I don't have any problems with v2.1, so I
      really can't understand this, but I'm not going to get into that
      here.
      I wasn't trying to promote BLITZ as being superior, I was simply
      saying that talking about BLITZ being superior, while never actually
      using it, made no sense to me.

   Yes, that is definitely it's strong point. Now, if the graphic-speed
   was accelerated by a factor of  2 or 3 times, structures and constants
   were added, along with full AGA-support, I'd say AMOS would be
   much closer to being the perfect development-language.  Strange, 
   how every language seems to include aspects of the "perfect"
   language, but none actually manage to combine all of them into
   a seamless package...


> I don't have the time to use anything else.

   I understand what you're saying and AMOS does indeed allow 
   incredibly fast program-development.  However, I think by
   applying their experience, writing some dev-tools, etc., a
   programmer can realize those accelerated development-cycles in
   other languages as well...

   That's what I'm currently debating... if I decide to switch over to PC
   development then it will be no problem to throw together an
   improved EnemyMotionDesigner, AutoImageGrabber, etc.


> And is Jade dead now?

   Good question?!  JADE sounded like it would be THE extension to
   bring AMOS up-to-date (and the one extension I might actually try)...
   what is the status, is it dead?!?

I take it your program is booting from floppy when it does this. In the
Startup-sequence of your boot disk, simply make the following line:

Assign ENV: Ram:

And that should solve all of your problems! If the user is booted from a
workbench disk/HD this error will never pop up.

In testing the new WWW server I have on my system now, ive moved a mirror of
my demon AMOS pages to this url:

http://mushy-pd.dyn.ml.org

I would be gratefull if people outside the UK, who normally find my pages a
bit slow, could try this to see if things get speeded up a bit. Ive also
shifted all the button and GFX links from my geocities pages, back onto the
demon/us site, which should also speed up things a little.

Out of all the poeple who had assigns for FTP space, only 3 people have gotten
back to me about a true FTP account and free webspace. I still have plenty of
space left if anyones interested.

Hi, folks!
Could you help me with these promblems:

1) My program uses GET DISC FONTS -command to locate the font I need.
On A500/KS1.3 this works fine but when I run my program on A1200 AMOS
-requester pops up whining that it could not find device ENV:. How can
I get rid of it?

2) This is actually for assembler-users, sorry (but it does have an 
effect on my next project. How the blitter's line drawing mode  
acts when you're using it on modulo-screen (for example 40 bytes wide
screen with 4 bitplanes => modulo=160)?

You  could use the Amiga DOS command called LOCK I guess. Simply Bload
it  into a bank and run it from within Amos. I think this would be the
easiest way.

I'm  also  sure  the JD Extension has some trackdisk commands, but not
sure if it's what you need.

And what about DOS calls? Have you tried some of them?

I  dunno  who  is  best  to  offer  advice  on DOS calls regarding the
trackdisk.dvice,  but  Chris  Hodges  is one of the most clues up guys
I've  ever  spoken with when it comes to being able to find a solution
:-)

Anyone know any better....???

Try something like this:

A$="DF0:"+Chr$(0)
Dreg(1)=Varptr(A$)
Dreg(2)=1
A=Doscall(-726)

>BTW: How do I unlock it when I'm finished ? :)

A$="DF0:"+Chr$(0)
Dreg(1)=Varptr(A$)
Dreg(2)=0
A=Doscall(-726)


This will only work with V36 and up (AmigaDOS 2.0+)
Prior to that you had to send packets to the handler
directly, and it is much more involved.

Just a note, there's actualy two great AGA-supporting extensions in beta-
state right now. The new GUI, and the new OS DevKit. For those complaining
about the OS DevKit being hard to use (like myselve) it's now including
some very easy-to-use screens, windows and gadgets commands, one of the
best features is that it's capable of fully supporting datatypes and
locales in your programs (localisation is almost imposible with GUI as far
as I know for now).. I can inform you that I'm currently beta-testing the
OS DevKit 1.54 and from what I've been told about GUI I'd prefer OS anytime
as it gives so much else that the GUI don't have. The lib file of OS is
currently about 92 Kb in size and are almost bigger than the mainlib of
AMOS Pro 2.0 :)..

I hope noone takes this too serious but I'm a bit pissed by always hearing
that the GUI is the best solution for intuition and it's the only serious
looking extension for AGA users.. WRONG, GUI might still be the easist to
use, but OS gives much better control for whatever you plan to make, and
it dosn't matter if you want intuition or AGA screens, this will be my
no. 1 choice from now on... And by the way, there's a little program that
can convert a GUI build with GAD-tools-box to a pice of OS-source :))

The GUI Extension is the only library out there tht ive seen in action, I
havent seen any of the OS devkit examples yet, even though the author said
he had re-written a ot of things and would send me something to play with.

The GUI extension does lack a lot of stuff, indeed Locale is a major
downside, but their are a lot of things that it does support, such as
virtually full GFX card support (screenmodes etc.). Does OS Devkit support
GFX card modes, or just AGA modes?

GUI extension allows to open custom screenmodes too, for example, I could
open a lowres screen of just 50x50 pixels. Frokm what I can tell from the
lib, the extension now supports IFF loading and displaying of images in the
library. Until pietro gets back to me with some info on the newer commands, I
cant be certain of how they work properly.

One thing that makes the GUI extension a pleasure to use as well as the OS
stuff, is the excellent TCP commands is boasts, as no other extension ive
seen can handle the net in the same way they do. For example, having
timeouts so the system doesnt lock, asynchronous operations, the works.

Im not taking it too serious, but the question remains with the user. "Why
should I pay X amount for this extension, when that extension does just the
same". What does the OS DEvkit have that the GUI extension doesnt? Im not
getting at anyone here, just asking a simple question.

Ive been waiting for some stuff on the new OS Devkit for a while so I can
explain a bit about its newer functions in an MPD report. Id also like to
try a few speed comparisons on the two extensions.

Hello everyone!

I've made a few programs for kids, with Amos of course. They have always been
working correctly, until last week.
I installed them on my brand new A1200 (second hand actually) with Blizzard
1200 (4MO) and seagate HD (210 mo).
Sometimes they work, sometimes they crash. And I can't find the reason! When
they crash, you still have the screen, 
but nothing moves. The left Amiga - A does not work (Amos to back). It's the
first time I have this problem. The Amos Pro interpreter I installed on the
machine also crashes!

The programs work perfectly well on my other 1200+ Blizzard 1240, as well as
it used to work on my previous Blizzard 1230.
What's happening? Help needed!

Sniper,
    That's not an RPG.  That's a graphic adventure.
I'm working on that kind of editor.  But, the Interface will be the
'old-school'  typing in the verb + noun.  I'm not to fond of 
these 'dumbed-down' interfaces of today.  There's not
much thought required when everything is spelled out for ya.
It's more Kings Quest-like rather than Monkey Island.
    I can't remember, but I think I might've sent you an iff pic
of one of my screens way back when in '97.  I wouldn't mind 
getting the support of you & your connections, but the game
would have to be what I have in mind.  I have an original storyline
sketched out.  As far as the editor goes, I can take any iff pic
and turn it into an active game screen:  Multiple background & 
foreground objects of varying sizes: rocks, trees, shrubs, buildings,
etc,
a joystick controlled character that walks around the objects, &
collision detection. Screens that have water: multiple walking depths,
(haven't completed the swimming animations or code yet).
Oh..just 1 screen specification: 32-colors, 320x200, can't use 
the last 10 color registers (22-31), so your actually lookin at a
22 color screen, which doesn't look too shabby.  You can send me
a full 32-colr screen, Digi-View 4.0 can re-draw the screen with user-
defined number of colors. Your call, dude.
Thanks,
Ken

A few extentions also have commands for locking, reading and writing 
to the drive that will work with OS 1.2 and 1.3 as well.
I think either Easylife or Turbo extentions had it. I cant remember 
which...

Hello.

-- Whole message cut :-) --

I only wish there was a GUI ext. that would work with kickstart 1.3!
I know that most people have kick 2 or even 3, but it seems that 
those (like me) who didnt bother upgrading before Commodore went out 
are having a hell of a time finding roms at a reasonable price!

The GUI Extension is the result of years of frustrations using the bugged
intuition extension and waiting the official intuition support by F. Lionet

My frustrations are the frustrations of all the Amos users:

- no AGA support
- no intuition
- no standard GUI
- my programs eat upto 80% of the CPU power!
- no multitasking

And so i've created a extension that solve all this problem, and offers a
easy way to handle everything, using simple/fast ready made commands for
all the boring/repetative intuition operations like open windows, handle
gadgets, events and so on.

The OS Dev Kit does the same things, but in a different way. You must handle
everything manually... IMHO it isn't a good idea, expecially for
GUI/intuition based operations.

Very well, a good news,  but there are some considerations to do:

- The OS needs some commands to define gadgets, and open the window. When
you'll compile the program, the executable size will be bigger than the GUI
ext. equivalent...  and also the GUI will be faster due to the use of GUI
banks, wich old all the infos in a "precalculated" way to speedup operations.

- Define your gadgets directly in Amos may be usefull if you must do some
little changes in your GUI... but in the 90% of the cases is a disadvantage!
Create a interface without a WYSIWYG editor is a frustation! (see the AMOS
interface language for example) for this reason exists the GadToolsBox, the
MUI Builder and the other ones.

The upcoming version 1.7 doesn't fully support localisation... it will be
ready in the v1.71 but with some extras ;) i.e. the user can translate in 
real-time your GUI without waiting that someone release the catalogs
needed.

much better control????? Let me an example......

Using the Gui Wait command only, you are able to control a unlimited number
of windows, the Arexx port of your program and 32 internet connections!

Try to do the same with the OS Dev Kit and see how complex (and big) your
program
will be thanks to the 'better control'

Also consider the GUI Ext. automatic hotkeys support and gadget-links. In the
v1.7 there is also a on-line help like MUI!


>no. 1 choice from now on... And by the way, there's a little program that

Not very usefull... because:

when you've created your GUI using the Gadtoolsbox, you must convert the GUI
into AMOS-OS code, and merge it into your program. OK... but if in the future
you must modify the GUI you shall convert the new GUI into OS commands,
delete the old ones from your AMOS program,  and merge the new ones.

Using the GUI banks and running the GUI Converter as accessory, you can
upgrade
your GUI automatically, without modify your source code.


I'm sorry for the big late... but now i'm busy with another great project!
In the *near* future you'll agree with me that there is a very good reason!!

Anyway if you want, you can mix the GUI Extension and the OS Dev Kit, and
obtain the best of the 2 worlds! :)

I don't know exactly your problem, but avoid GET DISC FONT command.
If you have a hd, with probably a *lot* of fonts, it's VERY sloooowwww.
Try AMCAF extension (you can find a demo version on Aminet): it has some
commands to handle fonts in a very easy and fast way!

Hmm, no probs with my 060 anyway, not with amos.  Runs quicker though..

What file-system are you running ??..
Have you tried to make a 'low-level-format' from HD-Tools-box ??..
Is it a SCSI or FAT/AT drive ??..

I don't know if ya' know this, but:

On blizz1230/50 with fpu, AMOS has often crashes. I used several days to
try and find the bug, so that I could avoid it..

Problem is:
-A fast moving loop with an 'inkey$' inside, something like:
Do
 w$=Inkey$
 if.....
 else if...
 else if...
 endif
Loop
(As long as the user don't push a key the loop keeps running around)
After some time the loop begins to be unstable (strange chars might be
written, some lines appears on WB) and the Amiga Crashes.. This takes
around 3 seconds to happen..

The solution is to put a 'Multi Wait' into the loop, this also has the
advantage of giving some CPU-power to other programs while yours is
awaiting the user to do something. I expect a similar fix would be to
put 'wait vbl' inside the loop, but I've never tried..

It was on the night of 29-Jan-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, geosync@mail.ozemail.com.au jumped out from behind a rock
and wouldnt stop shouting about "Strings and Things" until I was forced to
knock them out:
»-> Hello all,

»-> As I`m developing a program sometimes I want to go to the Direct mode
»-> and check the contents of strings.  But lately I`ve been getting strange
»-> results.
»-> If I want to look at the contents of F$(x) and I look at say F$(1) it
»-> displays the correct string but if I try F$(12) or something higher I
»-> get the actual AMOS code being printed on the screen with control chars
»-> doing strange things like wiping text and redrawing etc.

Ive had this problem a lot. I found a couple of ways to prevent it was to give
it a rather high SET BUFFER command at the top (to give you more variable
space than actualy needed) plus I checked my code and removed anything that
would poke and peek around any variables with VARPTR. After some messing, it
just disappeared as fast as it came, hehe. I also used to get it with
particulay large strings.

Hm.. well, as Mush offered (the demos on his website), there are no other
places that I can think of (and no "Official" website either). I have a
copy of it (with manual, docs, printed matter, and the disks.. from Chris
Evans, who has since left the List). I might be able to send a copy of this
package to you for a small fee (for postage, etc.). Contact me for more.

Hello all,

As I`m developing a program sometimes I want to go to the Direct mode
and check the contents of strings.  But lately I`ve been getting strange
results.
If I want to look at the contents of F$(x) and I look at say F$(1) it
displays the correct string but if I try F$(12) or something higher I
get the actual AMOS code being printed on the screen with control chars
doing strange things like wiping text and redrawing etc.

Anyone had this problem?

Andy H.

Greetings.

Well, as few may have noticed, I've been off the List for the past couple
of days (no mailing or computer, etc.) as I've been fighting off some
flu-like symptoms. I'm over most of it now, so I'm off to reply to some
mail.

Hiho.

heh, I read up on this topic, all the messages, flames
and things. Sounds cool, but let me start by asking:

"Have you ever DONE -ANYTHING- (code OR engine) like this?!" It sounds like
you're wanting to port (do up) a Quake type game! hehe, no harm, it's being
done by some people at ClickBoom, BUT, just a reminder: It takes QUITE a
bit of work (if you don't have any extra routines or docs, EVEN IN AMOS!).

I'd love to help (there are several knowledgeable people on the List on the
subject and coding of 3D games, myself to name one, Johnny Bintz, Mush, and
a couple others), but I'm still busy with CBATNAM and my own (AMOS) 3D
Doom'er (Cafe Engine) and upcoming game, meaning I may not be able to help
with coding, but maybe with some docs or some example source (I've got
PLENTY of BSP sorters, renderers, and the like, ALL in C! And of course you
can look around on Aminet for docs and such).

I also have several cool demos of some good C and ASM coded 3D Doom and
Quake type engines (there's one that runs GREAT on an ECS '030, uses c2p,
BSP, and lots of cool stuff, but its only a demo right now, no source).

Anyhow, many flames (and good luck). If you need any help or docs, mail me
and I'll see what I can dig up (ask Mush too if you haven't already). :)

Methinks I'd like to take some webspace, to help you test out your server
(if you still want), and for myself to try out with (and without) my FTP
account, and to see how they go together with my existing website. I'll
mail (or chat with) you if you need any account info or specifics.

Hello: AmosListers

I was looking trough my copy of Frontier Elite II CD32, and found two
devices the Multi-Targeter, and the Target Enhancer. Has any one got
to the point where these devices come in? If so is it rank, or date 
, or Elite status that brings up this point?

Have any of you ASM guys thought of making a better trainer?

IF so hears a couple of things I would like.
1 asteroids on for all ships.
2 turret mounts correctly positioned. (so you don't blow up your ship)
3 fuel scoop mounts for all ships. (so the cargo scoop will work)
4 jump range only limited bye fuel. (so a 10 ly ship can jump 20 lys 
in 2 weeks, or 30 lys in 3, and so on this needs to also apply to 
pursuers)

5 if possible when you call for help some one will respond other then 
the pirates.

6 if the above is time based a date accelerator.

 Hello Eric,

 Have you ever looked at the executable file in PPMORE, or NZ, it is the EASIEST thing to hack in the world, you should see mine :)

 Hack it yourself, just change some coords of the ship (for the turrets), and rename the ships so a eagle is turned into a pantha or whatever.

ahhhh.
Well actually, I'm using a blizz1230/50 with fpu with no problems but
as I've said before alot of people have troubles running some of my
programs. That sounds like it may help. I'll give it a go.

Hello..

First of all I'd like to send a little 'I'm sorry' to Pietro Ghizzoni
(the author of GUI) I had no intension of insulting you or your work,
and I'm very sorry of you felt that way..

After my little note on OS DevKit as an alternative to GUI and JADE, I've
gotten many mails from people not knowing what this extension is, or
some who's not aware of the new, and easier, commands. Loads of questions
on what the extension realy is. Apparently Brice (the author) is not
on this list, or is to busy to advertise his work, so as a Beta-tester
I'm writing this to inform about what this extension is, and what it
supports..

--

Regarding:       OS DevKit V1.54 (beta-test-release) 
Extension size:  93444 bytes..
Slot:            20.
Author:          Brice Fromentin

General notes:
 The extensions supports a wide range of systemfunctions, many of the
 areas is covered by 2 different sets of commands, one (original) that
 is on machine-level, and one on user-level. The first requiring quite
 complex setups, but it gives complete control of everything you'd like
 to use. The second is much like the regular AMOS system with simple
 and easy-going commands. The two levels of commands can be mixed most
 of the way to give a maximum of control and power with the least 
 effort...

amigaguide.library
 - Display amigaguide files on a public screen..

asl.library
 - File/Screen-type/Font requesters..

datatype.library
 - Full datatype support including pictures, samples and animations..

dos.library
 - Doslocks
 - Notification
 - File loadning/saving
 - System clock support
 - Starting external programs

exec.library
 - Version commands (for libs/system/cpu/fpu)
 - Nodes
 - Memory
 - MsgPorts
 - Tasks

gadtools.library
 - Full gadgets support, easy to customize to requrements.
   (Programing of gadgets is done by giving cords,sizes and ID-number and
   some data to stuff inside like arrays, texts, images, etc..)
 - Full pull-down-menu support

graphics.library
 - All regular drawing operations
 - The special (difficult and powerfull) filling system
 - Blitter and chopper support
 - Sprites
 - Fonts
 - RTG support for graphic-cards..

icon.library
 - Full tool-types support..
 - Opens for retriving images from Icons..

intuition.library
 - Intuition screens and windows..
   - Newscreen/Newwnd structures support..
   - AMOS like screen open/close availeble..
   - Full AGA support (including HAM8 screens)..
   - Custom/Public screen support..
   - Use ANY public screen for requesters and windows..
   - Palette can be set using 4bit, 8bit or 32bit notification..

locale.library
 - Full support for locale.library..

lowlevel.library
 - Joystick/gamepad/mouse support..

wb.library
 - App itims support (icons, windows and menus)

Eh?

What was that in aid of? Can't you handle critisism? 

I  was  only trying to support Jamie and his concepts, so why on earth
you should sent me an email with that kinda reply is beyond me!

Did anyone else on this list get a nasty reply from Robert?

There was no smiley, so I guess he's being serious!!!

Oh  well,  I won't lower myself to his standards. If he wants to react
like  that,  I think he'd be better of moving to another list. I don't
have  time  for  this  kinda crap and I guess nobody else on this list
would either!

Robert,  please  don't  waste my time with a reply like that. It's not
the kinda thing I wanna see....

To  put  everyone  else on this list in the picture....I have left the
rest of Robert's email in tact, sorry to quote it all again, but theen
you'll see why I am a bit miffed as to why he sent me a nasty reply!

Grrr....

Hello..

A request to all of you excelent sound-extension-people. Can any of you
write a sample-replayer into your extension (or even a simple AMOS-
procedure) that can handle long raw samples (+100.000 bytes) the only
way I can find to replay those bloddy things is to call an external 
player like Play16.. Gah...

It was on the night of 30-Jan-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Jens jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting
about "Re: Looooooooong Samples" until I was forced to knock them out:

»-> That's right and it might turn to be the only answer, but that system
»-> was intended for loading samples 'on the fly' so it was possible to
»-> play samples longer than memory.

»-> My problem is that I have the sample in memory (I've converted it from

»-> to play it :(
»->      

Try downloading the Snd&Music.Lha archive from the library (I think its in
Source, or somewhere like that) as it has all kinds of sample programs, and
music ones all piled in. I dont know off hand if it has what you want, but
maybe its worth a try.

This is still in an early idea stage, so nothing has been settled
about programming, but it *could* be an Amos project...

I've done some experiments, and it appears that the loop gets unstable
when it's runing VERY fast. So the crashes is seen more often if AMOS
is running from a clean WB (No Opus or other things running). As soon
as something else is running the chance of crash drops..

That's right and it might turn to be the only answer, but that system
was intended for loading samples 'on the fly' so it was possible to
play samples longer than memory.

My problem is that I have the sample in memory (I've converted it from
a special format) so it's a bit stupid to begin and split it up in order
to play it :(

It was on the night of 30-Jan-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Jens jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop shouting
about "Re: Apollo 060" until I was forced to knock them out:

Its not only the 060 which has this problem, its often occured on my machine
(blizzard 1220, 28MhZ FPU) with the Foundation Mailinglist. At night, i'll
reset my machine and run Miami + Foundationlist and if I get up in the middle
of the night its usually frozen about 5 hours later. One way I got around
this, was to limit the no. of cycles used in a loop to an absolute minimum,
and thus ive had (at the most whilst in england) 39 hours out of the list
program, and reset the machine remotely whilst it was still running.

Instead of using Do...LOOP commands, try something else, like Repeat...Until,
or While...Wend even. Just experiment with different measures and see the
results.

So I'd suppose that a faster processor would also increase the chance
of a crash...

Thank you for responding to my mail. I have looked at the code of my
CD32 version , and the 2 disk Amiga version that is how I found the
Multi-Targeter, and the Target Enhancer.

Unfortunately I am not a hacker if I was I would make my own trainer.
If you can hack why not get some fame, and make a better trainer?

Ok now to answer my own question on closer examination those two 
devices are new devices like the NEW-ZZ1 Navigation Aid. This device
dosn't exist on the 2 disk version it may on the other version. It 
kick in a couple of months or so after the start of the normal game.

Does any one have a disk version with the NEW-ZZ1 Navigation Aid?

You can try this one.... it's a double buffered replayer wich use the GUI

Oh no,no.... i'm not offended :) I was too serious with my previous message

intuition/AGA extension!! hehehehe :)

I agree with you... the OS DevKit is a good extension, but first i want see
the new easy-to-use commands. Could you please send me (or to the list)
come simple ASCII examples?

_CUT_

COOL! And now the new stuffs added to the GUI Extension:

- AGA support

- Custom/Public/Gfx Cards screen support

- support for 4bit and 32bit AGA color definition

- new gfx commands (Fill,plot,point ect)

- AMOS Screen promotion! You can display a Amos screen under intuition!

- automatic on-line help. i.e when you move the mouse pointer over a
  gadget, a message (defined by you) will be displayed.

- you can display AmigaGuide documents

- improved mouse handling commands

- new commands for internet connection. Totally asynchronous design! Now
  everyone can easly create a internet client.

- it's always FreeWare ;)

- and much more 



I must send a *big* 'i'm sorry' to Mush... you'll receive the infos in a few
days!

It was on the night of 31-Jan-98, when no creatures were stirring, and all was
silent. Suddenly, Martin jumped out from behind a rock and wouldnt stop
shouting about "Arexx calls from amos" until I was forced to knock them out:
»-> Hi guys.

»-> Can anyone of you tell me if there exists a arexx extension for amos.

Not that I know of, one isnt needed  =)

»-> I would like to be able to send a command directly to yam.

»-> Something like this would be nice:

»-> Arexx address="YAM"
»-> Arexx send "getmail"

»-> Does this extension exists?, and where to get it?

»-> I know i'm able to use the exec command like exec "RX Script.arexx".
»-> But that's another problem i'm having, it's not stable enough.
»-> Some times the script works perfectly, other times it just executes
»-> the first three or four lines. and then hangs. Have anyone else had this
»-> problem, and how do i avoid it?.

OK, take a look at this program that allows AMOS to interact with AmIRC. At
the bottom is also the small AREXX script, mish.amirx, which goes in AmIRC and
all channel text is sent to it:
