                               Introduction

         Visionary Revelations(tm) presents The Amos Protection System

             Finally, you don't have to save all your AMOS banks
              within your programs for protection from hackers.

             Now you can protect your data from file spies, load
            it into your AMOS programs and quickly uncode it with
                         your own secret password!

           - Fair warning: You use this program at your OWN risk. -
           - I cannot, and do not take any responsibility in any   -
           - loss or damages that may result from the use/misuse  -
           - of these programs.                                   -

- An Amiga computer (This is a MUST!!)
  
- A hard drive or a floppy disk (to store this program on)

- AMOS V1.2 or higher (If you encrypt AMOS files)

- AMOS Library in LIBS drawer (Provided in this archive!)



      To install:
 
            Copy AMOS.library and Powerpacker.library to LIBS:
            
                Put everything else wherever you'd like.

         


         This program should work with any system configuration.

                               Instructions

         TAPS is made to be very easy to use and now it's even better
           with v1.2 it features a new GUI! Just run the program,
            click on the 'Load' button, choose a 'Load' file.
              Click on 'Save' and choose the 'Save' file.
               
            (e.g. Filename.abk to be saved as Filename.coded)

             Now you need to enter a password, enter any 11
         digit numeric code, click on 'Encrypt' and your file will
                           be coded in seconds!

          To uncode a file just click 'Unencrypt' and choose your
            load/save file names. Now when the file was coded,
           the program automatically made a password file for
           your records (Keep it somewhere safe.) and will grab
         the password from the file if it's in the directory with
            the file you want to uncode, otherwise you'll have
               to enter the password for the file yourself.

           That mysterious 'Compare Files' in the main menu will
          allow you to test your original file against an UNcoded
                file to see if everything went smoothly.

         You probably won't need to test any files but I included
          it just for the sake of research. You can for instance,
          code a file, then uncode it with a slightly different
          password and test it to see how much encryption still
           remains! (I've tested files that were uncoded with
            the original password except I changed the last
           digit, try it yourself and see if you can run the
            file when your done. I couldn't!)

          And the 'Quit' menu item, well I think you can use this to
         stop using the program, but I'll have to run some tests! `B)


          Like I said before your file is (un)coded in seconds
           so you shouldn't have big delays in your programs!

                         Using the uncode procedure

         Using the 'uncode' procedure in your own programs is easy
         too! Just load the "uncode_proc.amos" program into AMOS
         and cut it with 'cut block', then paste it at the end of
         the AMOS program listing you want to use it in.

         The format is:
                       uncode[filename$,bank number,password$]


         An example for loading a coded Sprite/BOB bank:

                    uncode["RAM:Coded_Bob.file",1,"1234567890"]
                                      |         |        |
                                     /          |        |
The name of your coded file (string)/           |        |
                                               /         |
       The bank you want it to be placed in(#)/          |
                                                         |
                                                         |
                   Your secret password (in string form)/

         A wise Vietnamese man once said, "Problems, problems, problems
         everybody's got problems." (I hope I got the right number of
         "problems" in that!)

        This program should not have any problems, but if it does please
        send them in to me so I can fix them on update.

        TIP: Make backups of any files you are going to code, that way
             if you make a mistake you can start again with these!

        In case you can't get help from me right away try some of the

                                               Use the TEST feature

                                Technogibber

                WHY DID I MAKE THIS PROGRAM in the first place?
            Well, I have been somewhat concerned about releasing any
            AMOS programs that needed to load in external files
            because it's quite easy to take one's Sprite/BOB bank
            and load it into AMOS and take a look at the sprites,
            alter them, or even steal them. I was quite shocked
            to think that the graphics, sound, music... etc.
            that I had worked so hard on could end up in someone's
            rave demo and I couldn't at least slow them down!
            (I've seen pictures in magazines where Robocod and
            Lemmings that have been ripped from their games are
            used in demos!)

            I HAVE SEARCHED, AND HOPED FOR A PROGRAM that would do
            some sort of encryption for my AMOS files, but I couldn't
            find such a program. With me not knowing how to do much
            in the way of binary hacking, I gave up ever having any
            protection for my files that way and started trying to
            keep them all within my programs, but as you probably
            know, it's almost impossible!

            WORKING ON SOME WAYS TO CODE text files so they couldn't
            be read got me closer to realizing this program, I
            didn't think I could do it! BUT HERE IT IS!!

                         VR T.A.P.S. - Version 1.2

                                  Updates
   From unreleased
   version 0.5:

               "Yes, there should be at least one update, I
             would like to include a loading procedure for you
            to use in your own programs to load coded text files.

            The uncode procedure V0.5 will only load AMOS BANK
             files.

            Also, when a sprite/BOB file is coded it is turned
            into binary and can be loaded into AMOS as FAST RAM
             data instead of CHIP RAM unlike a TRUE BOB bank.

            So I'm working on a new version of the uncode_proc
            that will allow you to implement this feature in
           your own programs, imagine loading hundreds(+) BOBs
           into memory and not even using one byte of CHIP RAM
                until you uncode them into the BOB bank.

           Check for yourself how much CHIP RAM is used by BOBs
           type the following into AMOS:

                      Print Chip Free
                      Load "Your BOB BANK with 100+ bobs"
                      Print Chip Free

           See how it eats away at it!"

           V1.0:

            As you have read I was able to do all those things
            so I can't think of anything I need to add right
            now.

           V1.1:

            Thought of something! Now you can load coded ILBM picture
            files directly to the screen.

                 To use: Where BANK # used to mean the bank to
                         uncode to, now it is the screen to
                         load the picture into.

                 (e.g. UNCODE["DH1:Coded.pic",0,"1234...")

                    This loads Coded.pic into screen 0!


           
           V1.2:

            Well, I seem to have made some slight mistakes on the
            AmigaGuide code for this document on V1.1 so I've fixed
            them now.

            Also, many of you might have had "File Format Not Recognized"
            errors when using 1.1's procedures, a dumb mistake on
            my part kept AMOS guessing. I've fixed it!
            (I wondered why I didn't get any E-MAIL, you probably said,
            "This doesn't work.", and promptly deleted the whole thing!)             

                   V1.2 features a new GUI and faster ILBM
               encryption and has better coding for all other file
              types as well, this unfortunately doesn't allow for
                          backwards compatibility.

            SO DON'T GET RID OF V1.1 if you have it, until you uncode
            any encrypted files!!!

               VERSION 1.2 IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH V1.1 OR LOWER!!!

                         VR T.A.P.S. - Version 1.2

                             Special Features!

         Some great features that are included in this system are:

                      * Special encryption for text files!

                        - Need a lot of external text for your
                          adventure games? TAPS will load any
                          ASCII file and use 'TEXT' encryption
                          so players won't be able to peek at
                          the answers to your game!

                      * 'NO-CHIP' Sprite/BOB loading!

                        - Tired of running out of CHIP RAM
                          when you load in several hundred BOBs?
                          Now you can load encrypted BOB banks
                          into FAST RAM and uncode them when
                          you need them!

                      * All format encryption!

                        - It doesn't matter what kind of file
                          you want to code, TAPS will do it
                          and offers two levels of encryption!
                          So you can code all of your regular
                          files, and not just for AMOS!

                      * -NEW- for 1.1 Direct coded ILBM loading!

                        - See @{"Updates" link update}
                      

       - TEXT ENCRYPTION -

       When ever you load a file into TAPS a check is run to find out
       if it is an AMOS BANK file or not, if it isn't, TAPS will ask
       whether you'd like to use 'TEXT' coding. 'TEXT' coding is a
       higher level of encryption that will try to make your files
       totally unreadable. This option takes a little longer than the
       normal coding so it's not recommended for use on your AMOS BANK
       files. (I think you'd rather have fast uncoding for your BOBS,
       music, sound, etc., so I reserved this for text.)


       - 'NO-CHIP' BOB/SPRITE LOADING -

       I didn't think this could be done, but ANIMs must load into
       FAST RAM or we'd all run out of CHIP RAM when we wanted to
       play an animation! All you need to do is code a BOB bank in
       the normal way, then put the "UNCODE_BANK" and "LOAD_FILE"
       procedures in your AMOS program and follow the example below.
       (Please note: TAPS uses bank 10 for uncoding so don't use it.)

                 Load BOB bank into FAST RAM:

                           LOAD_FILE["Your file",any Bank #(not bank 10)]

                          (e.g. LOAD_FILE["DF0:Coded_BOBS",11])

                 Now your BOBs are in FAST RAM (bank 11), to unpack them:

                           UNCODE[From bank#,To bank#, Password$]

                          (e.g. UNCODE[11,1,"12345..."])

                 Any type of coded AMOS file can be loaded this way,
                 even text files.


       - ALL FORMAT FILES -

       TAPS codes most anything! You can choose to have fast uncoding
       encryption used on your files, or the not-so-fast 'TEXT' encry-
       ption for more protection. Code anything from MODs to LHA arc-
       hives.

           Ok, so you've got your files encrypted and ready to use in
           your latest mega-creation, but before you go...

           I was reading the docs to an AMOS extension the other day,
           and the author was talking about file encryption and how
           hackers can single-step through your main AMOS program and
           find your password.

           This is very true! Your password IS right out in the open
           in the midst of the uncode procedure's brackets!

                 UNCODE["BOBS.FILE",1,"HERE IT IS. TAKE IT!"]

                   Even in compiled form it may be visable!

           So what should we do!? You could chose to have your program
           PowerPacked when you compile it.

                                      OR

           Put the UNCODE command inside a procedure:

                         Procedure UNCODE_MY_FILES
                         UNCODE["BOBS.FILE",1,"YourPasword"]
                         End Proc

           Then run the FOLD.acc file that came with AMOS to lock the
           procedure, you can't see inside a locked procedure when it
           has been compiled. (Unless you have MANY free hours to spend
           hacking away for nothing but someone's sprite file!)         

           Well, I'm thinking of some other ways. If I come up with a
           good one you can find it on the Visionary Revelations
           web page or wait for me to upload add-on files to AmiNET!
