Giday Lee,

I have a suggestion if you were going to use a bar the full width of the 
screen.  I would use a bob which is the bar at full length, and then move 
it backwards with each step.. 
eg.

(Lets say image 6 is the bar, this could be execute every second for 
instance)


Dec BARPOS
Bob 10,0-BARPOS,30,6

this would make it look as if the bar were getting shorter.. when it is 
really only moving back.. =)

AMOS does have its limits.. but in terms of ease of use.. it is the BEST 
thing around.. (IMO)

I have now set up a bot on IRC at channel #AMOS which will allow you to
download my AMOS PD library as it is at the moment. You can also upload
your own programs and utilities.

The bot is only a dancer, and so is only on whilst I am on. It is also
in it's test stages, so would appreciate a couple of volunteers to help
tune it in. Info is displayed when you log into the channel. Thanks

Some time ago I had a similar problem with True and False: there's a bug, so
you have to use 0 and -1.
I don't remember actually where, but it seems to me that you cannot use
True/False in Pop Proc commands (for example Pop Proc[True]).

However, I think it's always better to use -1 and 0. This should run well.

Are you sure this is the fastest routine possible? Why not an easier Bar
command? I didn't test the speed but it seems to me easier and, probably,
even faster (even because you don't have one more bob always displayed on
youe screen 0.

No, do not! :-)

Then you have never programmed C, where this is exactly the case. It makes
for very efficient checks on because a check for either 0 or something else
can be done in one ML statement. Why would assuming everything other than
0 is true be bad programming? It's either true or it isn't, and whether
you choose to implement it as 0 and -1 or as 0 and anything else does
not really make a difference.

Wrong. Because in your book 0 is false, so the last equation should read
true and true = false, which is false. 

> (but in your book 0 = a and b = True and True = True (contradiction))

Where did the a=0 come from?? Not from the above example, in any case!

> If I set USER(1)=True, then I expect USER(1) to equal "-1" always!!!!

But this is not really an issue. If you ask AMOS what True means, you will
get -1. Ask C, and you get 1. But that does _not_ imply that anything else
is bad or wrong or false or something-we-don't-have-a-name-for. They could
easily return a non-zero random value, for example.

AdPro in conjunction with the conversion software for CDXL, which can be
found on the Amiga Developer CD V1.1.

Yeah. As long as the Delta-Length does not exceed 32 KB (often does with
full screen ham animations).

A program for doing this can be found in dev/amos/PrgCollection.lha

> 3.) Is it possible to play AGA-IFF-Animations from Amos?

No. Workarounds:

1. Write your own iff-anim routines. or

2. Try to temporarily hack the bitplane pointers and the number of
bitplanes in the current screen to the right values, create an aga
copperlist and display it.

3. Split the animation frames into 2 seperate frames containing 4
bitplanes each, use the amos animation commands for playback but an aga
copperlist for display, which merges the 8 bitplanepointers again.

Hi,

> Isn't the number -214... still true though?  Anything except 0 = true 
> doesn't it?

Its VERY bad programming to consider anything other than 0 to be 
True (IMHO)

eg

a=1 (=True in your book)
b=2 (=True in your book)
but..
a and b =  0
True and True =True

(but in your book 0 = a and b = True and True = True (contradiction))

If I set USER(1)=True, then I expect USER(1) to equal "-1" always!!!!

Cheers,
        Mark

A good place is the init routine of your extension..... insert this:

          Rjsr      L_Error             ;Deafault Amos Error Routine call=

          move.w    #$4EB9,(a1)         ;Hack the code, and insert a Jsr
          move.l    a0,2(a1)            ;with the address of your routine=

          move.w    #$7200,6(a1)        ;another useful hack....

=2E..well done! Now when Amos generate an error your routine will be call=

                           --- ATTENTION!!! ---

we have trashed the first 8 BYTES of the original amos error routine! You=

execute the replaced instructions at the end of your routine!!! You MUST
follow this scheme for your routine:

               .....

               ;very important
               ;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ADPro offered CDXL and IFF-ANIM support in the last release. Commodore al=
so distributed a CDXL load & saver for earlier versions of ADPro as well,=
 but only to CDTV developers. (ah, the good ol'days ... sigh.) The format=
 is actually quite simple, and I ended up writing AMOS code to do tweaks,=

 an uncompressed series of color-map, bit-planes and audio data.

I have now set up a bot on IRC at channel #AMOS which will allow you to
download my AMOS PD library as it is at the moment. You can also upload
your own programs and utilities.

The bot is only a dancer, and so is only on whilst I am on. It is also
in it's test stages, so would appreciate a couple of volunteers to help
tune it in. Info is displayed when you log into the channel. Thanks

A good place is the init routine of your extension..... insert this:


          bra.s     .Hack
          Rjsr      L_Error             ;Deafault Amos Error Routine call=

=2EHack     move.l    *-4,a1              ;amos err. routine address -> A=

          lea       MyRoutine(pc),a0    ;address of your routine
          move.w    #$4EB9,(a1)         ;Hack the code, and insert a Jsr
          move.l    a0,2(a1)            ;with the address of your routine=
 :)
          move.w    #$7200,6(a1)        ;another useful hack....

=2E..well done! Now when Amos generate an error your routine will be call=
ed! :)


                           --- ATTENTION!!! ---

we have trashed the first 8 BYTES of the original amos error routine! You=
 must
execute the replaced instructions at the end of your routine!!! You MUST
follow this scheme for your routine:


MyRoutine      movem.l   a0-a6/d0-d7,-(sp)        ;important......

               .....

               your code
               .....

               movem.l   (sp)+,a0-a6/d0-d7

               ;very important
               ;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

               add.l     #2,(sp)                ;correct return address..=
=2E
               moveq.l   #$13,d1                ;These are the trashed/ha=
cked
               moveq.l   #-1,d2                 ;instructions....
               tst.b     $A07(a5)               ;we MUST execute them....=


               Rts                              ;OK! Return to the origin=
al..




Bye!! and happy hacking! 8-))

Hi everyone, Matt here all the way from Ireland!
If I`m doing this right a whole lot of fellow Amosians should get this soon!
Special thanks to Ben Wyatt for mailing instructions to me to join the list!
I`m using a rather sad effort called pine on the uni peecees to do email, 
still you can`t have everything ;-)
I haven`t released any games or anything yet but I have a rather LARGE 
and exciting game nearly done. Curious?? 
Does anybody know where I can get the Turbo Plus Extension. Ben tells me 
that Playfield (I think they might have made it) are gone. Would anybody 
have any suggestions? I`d even buy it second hand (so long as no laws are 
broken of course.) Well, read you soon!

I have a number of programs that I enjoy using that use Amos. I even
thought of trying my hand at programming in Amos myself, but never did. I
fear I do not have what it takes to program, or if I do am not willing to
invest the time and effort. Yet for those that do, and widh to receive
something for their efforts there is a group that might be able to help.


 
The Amiga Development Fund is a group of people that wish
to distribute funds donated by amiga users from around the world to
developers and programmers for new and improved programs for the amiga. We
believe that many small contributions combined would be larger enough to
pay for any projects necessary to keep the amiga alive and competitive
with other computer platforms. A web site is in the making and feelers are
being sent out.
 
I was wondering if it would be possible to have a link for ADF's website 
or have some type of advertising placed on your mailing list.

Thanks for keeping the Amiga alive with all your efforts. Sorry to ask for
more.

Hi,

If somebody knows how to calculate splines or bezier stuff, please tell
me. I've a set of points, and I would like to calculate the points
between them so that it would form a smooth curve.

Hi everyone!
Matt here, I`m newISH to the list, I don`t know if I`m properly 
subscribed though... 
Does anybody know how to get a list of ASSIGNS and DEVICES?
The manual says something like

D$=Dev First$("a/") to get the assigns and
D$=Dev First$("d/") for devices
and then
D$=Dev Next.....

This produces no noticeable result! I`ve tried everything! Does anyone 
know how to do this? (I may not have typed in exactly what was in the 
manual `cos I don`t have it with me, but I tried that and everything else 
I could think of.....)
If Amos can`t do it could the CLI dir command help me?

Also I`m desperate... I WANT,NEED,CAN`T LIVE WITHOUT (well..) the Turbo 
Plus extension, (I know I`m repeating myself but I really would like to 
have it) If anyone knows where I could get it or if anyone wants to sellme their old copy (not breaking any laws) email me.

I just got the Black Dawn 2 demo. Wow... :-O :-))

Ok bye for now...

If anyone is replying can you email me direct as I don`t think I`m 
subscribed properly yet!

Hello from Canada!

As a new subscriber, I just thought I'd introduce myself to the group.

I've used AMOS in the past and having recently made a "tour"
of some of the available programming languages(most notably Amiga E)
on the Amiga, I'm back with AMOS!

So now I'm ready to settle in with AMOSPro again and begin learning what the
system can really do. I've already got a project going and will no doubt be
calling on the group for help in the near future 8o)

Regards,

Dale

Does anyone have some good tiled-backgrounds in "Scene Bank" format?  I
am currently experimenting on a 8-way scroller but my time is limited,
so I have not designed a good background for testing.

Also, does anyone know where I can poke to alter the screen address of
running AMAL programs?  The reason I ask is because I need to update the
bitplane pointers on each screen in order to do horizontal hardware
scrolling, so that bobs don't get clipped as the screen moves left to
right.

(I'm not poking addresses without good reason ;)

or if anyone has designed a good 8-way scroller, I'd like to see it! ;)

thanks..

Has anyone got any thoughts about the parallel port.
At current I am moving 128kbytes from an external static ram into an 
Amos memory bank.  I am doing this with something like this:

Reserve as chip work 10,131072
Open in 1,"PAR:"
Sload 1 to start(10),131072
Close 1

This takes about 10 to 15 seconds to transfere the 128k.
Any ideas to shift it faster?

Hello.
Just joined the Mailing list. 
I've used AMOS (&pro) for a long time.
I've used mail for a day. 

I have 2 games that I'd like some feedback on.

WECKERS- Platformer where a little green man and a clown bust up TV's &
Microwaves to finish levels, squishing cockroaches etc.. 

CPT. CUSTARD- Shoot-em-up in 32 directions. If you remember Time Pilot, it's like
1972 in a starfeild (except bigger and faster).

Plus lots of bits & pieces which may give you some good ideas-
Interface Procedures in Standard AMOS
Bob Grabber
Map Engines- Populous, Dungeon Master...
 
If you want these please tell me if there's a better way than e-mailing it
to you directly, (I know this much " " about Aminet.)

Also- can someone tell me more about JWindows, Does it let you throw
bobs/blocks around a 256 colour Workbench window?

For Adam, and  anyone else with stuff to upload, here's how:

You need an FTP program. If it is a command line driven FTP then run it
and type:

	open wurchive.wustl.edu

Give login name "ftp" and your e-mail address as password. Then type:

	bi			(option for binary file)
	ha			(displays progress)
       	cd /pub/aminet/new	(Where to upload)
	put progname.lha	(Send the program)
	put progname.readme	(Send the readme file)
	quit			(Take a wild guess)

Microsoft/ X Windows based ftp clients are available - if you can write
programs, you should be able to figure these out for yourselves...
Windows 3.11/95/NT & unix all come with a command line ftp program, just
type FTP at the DOS/Shell prompt. Amiga ftp programs are on aminet in
/coms/ftp.

More details of this process and what to put in the readme file are in
the file:

Here's how the AMOS interpreter treats booleans, and therefore how AMOS
programmers should think of them to avoid headaches:

"True" is a 0 argument function call that always returns -1.
"False" is a 0 argument function call that always returns 0.

Now forget they exist when considering the rest of the picture:

<, >, = , <> , <= , >= are 2 argument infix function calls that return
either -1 or 0.

And, Not and Or all perform bitwise operations on their arguments as
unsigned longwords.

If, While, Until, etc. treat any non-zero value as "true" - this "true"
has absolutely nothing to do with the True function call.

They can be compiled.  You just have to send the c3d.lib along with the c=

Hi everyone!
 
Matt again with another does anyone know how to.....

Is there a way of pasting a graphic (bob/sprite/icon/block etc...) so 
colour zero stays transparent but all other colours are pasted as one? (A 
bit like you can with dpaint brushes?) Having copies of bobs/icons in one 
colour is not an option due to the memory it uses.

I hope someone can help me with this and my other recent queries...

Thanks, happy Amosing

Good evening everyone.
I'm rather new at all this programming stuff, and I'm a bit feeble at it.
I have a query, and I would like some advice.
I have been writing a game type thing, and when I try and compile it, it

It is.
I know.
It told me.
What should I do?

About as much as me my friend! I`ve just deleted a whole directory of

Of course! Why try using GCC when AMOS is easier and better! (flame war 
gonna start, I know!)

You poke away!

I wrote one ages ago, and thought it was working. Although I just took
another look at it and it's a bit iffy. It runs at 50fps though, and it's
very close to working properly. Once/If I get it working properly, I'll
mail it to the list.

Greetings!

As expected, I've come to a sticking point in the program I'm working on.

I need to open a sequential file, find certain characters, replace them with
another, different character, and save the modified file to disk.

Some of these files are a little big so ldos' lreplace command using memory
banks isn't really much help.

Any suggestions as to how I could accomplish this would be greatly
appreciated.

Regards,

Dale

No I have not done much in the way of C, but I have done a lot in the way of
neat good quality programming.  Whats more I know that I would like to use a
data type where a variable can only exist in one of two states - true or false.

The thing is that logical operators used in most "imperative" languages
apply to ALL bits in the "Input" values. If the "input" values are 1 bit
long (as I would like to be able to do) then there is no problem. But Amos
forces you to use 16 bit values (as a minimum) and therefore it is "good
programming" to set ALL bits to 1 or ALL bits to 0. My example below is
correct, although badly explained...

>for very efficient checks on because a check for either 0 or something else
>can be done in one ML statement. Why would assuming everything other than
>0 is true be bad programming? It's either true or it isn't, and whether

As a "good taste" example, say you have a variable called PEOPLE which
stores the number of people using a system. If I want to do something when
some people are using this system if would write:
"If PEOPLE>0 Then..." and not "If PEOPLE Then.."
because I'm treating PEOPLE as an integer and not a boolean value.  I know
this isnt strictly what we are talking about, but I'm merely highlighting a
point...

I'll explain the example better!!!...

In your book:
[you dont care what you set a and b to coz its all non-zero ;-)]
Let a = 1 (= true)
Let b = 2 (= true)
(true and true) = (a and b) = (1 and 2) = 0 = False
But true and true does not equal false!!!!!!

In my book:
a and b would both be set to -1 and there would be no problem ;-)

Do you understand...?

Quite frankly, what C does or does not do, is irrelevant - this is an Amos
list in case you havent noticed! C has a concept of data types and so this
problem does not arise!!!

Quite simple:

FIND$="char to find"
REPLACE$="char to replace"

Open In 1,"original file"
Open Out 2,"fixed file"

REPLACE:
ST=Eof(1)
If ST=True Then Goto _DONE
IN$=Input$(1,1)
If IN$=FIND$ Then IN$=REPLACE$
Print #2,IN$;
Goto REPLACE

_DONE:

The bot will be on all this weekend, from now till about midnight
tonight, and from 5pm onwards on sunday (UK time). I am looking for
volunteers to test out the bot, as there as still one or two bugs in the
programming. Join channel #AMOS and a text will tell you how to use it.

Thanks

P.S. Good to see the list back online again.

Press F2 and resave the program. That should do it.

I'm in the final stages of writing my Web browser (yes, an actual browser 
that grabs pages from computers far away!) and I'm having a teeny 
problem.  I used GetURL by James Burton as a basis for how I do my 
Netting around, and if you can't afthom what's going on, don't 
worry...the protocol is not the problem:

First, I open the device "TCP:<computer>/<port>" with Open Port
Then, I write the necessary HTTP stupp to the port with Print#
Then, I read back the header with Line Input#

Sometimes, the distant computers tell you how long the file is, and some 
don't.  When they say how long the file is, I use Input$() to grab the 
file from TCP:.  When they don't, I use a deal like this:

Repeat
  a=Port(1)
  if a>-1
    Poke Memory_Bank,a:Inc Memory_Bank
  End If
Until A=-1

The only problem is that AMOS and my TCP/IP Stack, Miami, don't like 
Port().  If anyone can find a work-around, or program a small program to 
access TCP: like above (I completely forgot all C!), it would be appreciated.

The other solution is to say, " Sorry, but the server this file is on 
sucks." and not many would appreciate not being aboe to visit Microsoft 
(who doesn't give file lengths)/.  8^)

Hello to you all....

When I try to use fonts from disc (not from AMOSPro 
but from Fonts: or from another fontsdrawer)it just 
won't work... 

Assign "FONTS:" To "SYS:FONTS2"
Get Disc Fonts 
Do 
Set Font X
Text 20,20,"Commodore"
Inc X
Wait Key 
Loop 


AMOSPro will tell me: 
Fonts not examined at line 5' 

This happens also without the assign but not if 
I use 'get fonts' 

I would like to use fonts in my drawer FONTS2:
Someone who knows how to do it? 

Another question: 

Do 
Goto Rnd(5)
0
1
2
3
4
5
Loop 

Is there any good way to make the program 
go to each label exactly once?

Right now, there's a copy sitting in the new dir on Wustl, but they have =

having problems with their hard drives.
If it wasn't so big, I'd offer to uuencode it.  Also, aminet won't accept=

Does anyone have any good source code programs which demonstrate how to
use AMOS with my modem, to create a Bot, or other such IRC program?
Please Email to me at mpd@mushy-pd.demon.co.uk as I would like to learn
more, and even make my own commands.

If Someone in this planet could tell me where to find this

If you get AmiTCP <fx: vomit, 'cos I use Miami!>, you can use the TCP: 
device to access sockets on remote machines.

If you want to write an IRC bot, you would probably need to (if you 
haven't already done so) get the RFC for the IRC protocol(?) and use TCP: 
to read/write to the ports, maybe using the OPEN DEVICE command?

TCP I/O is an interesting concept in AMOS... let me (and the rest of the 
list) know how you get on ;-)

Amos (Classic) Compiler I presume ....
Test your program and then save it straight away without making any more 
changes (even adding or changing comments) Then it should compile ok.
Alternativly upgrade to Amos Pro and the Amos Pro compiler or even just 
the compiler if you like Amos Classic, Its much better.

Have fun

Hi,
I kind of caught this converstion half way through but I can vouch that 
true does not equal -1. I had a perfectly working program a while back so 
I compiled it for that extra bit o` speed... and then the blimmin thing 
goes wierd. It was a real frustating thing to fix as the uncompiled 
worked fine...anyway to cut a long story short it was because I was 
relying on true being equal -1. I don`t know why the compiler didn`t like 
what I`d done but once I`d put  `-1` in not `True` it was fine......
Hmmm

I wonder if anyone knows if I can link up two computers via the serial 
port to play dual tv games. I am sharing a house with 3 others, and 2 of 
them have Amigas aswell. It would be fun to write some game to link up 
computers.

Thankyou, and MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!!!

up. Anyway, I'm going to send them a new version sometime...

Roit'en, my question: How do you read a second mouse, without the aid of
an extension? What I really need here are the memory addresses, not a
fully fledged routine. Ta.

BTW, having only just got on the 'net, I keep on wondering, why isn't
there a proper AMOS newsgroup, rather than just this mailing list?

Good.  I hate AmiTCP, and I have used TCP: to access machines on the 'Net 
with HTTP.  However...

...in my dealings with HTTP, I noticed that some servers didn't send the 
file length.  What this involved in the end is a looping Port() command, 
reading the port until I got -1, in which I aborted the read.  It worked 
great, but Port() is buggy, and after closing the port and then reopening 
it, "Miami Airport", or the TCP: device, crashed the computer.  If 
someone can write a replacement to open Port and Port() thatn doesn't 
crash the computer, it would be most welcome here.

Hi chummers!

I apparently read throug the V40-Release Notes and found some interesting
notes, which might be the cause why interlace screens are not displayed
correctly on kick 3.1... does anyone know if this really could cause this
bug or if I am complete wrong?

    -   ScrollVPort would fail to modify the FMODE value in the
intermediate
        copper list of an interlaced screen. This is because it was looking
        for a DIWHIGH move followed by an FMODE move. The interlaced
        intermediate copper lists have two DIWHIGH moves, and have LF/SHF
        bits set in the opcodes.  Fix was to AND out the LF/SHF bits and to
        make it skip as many DIWHIGH writes as appear.
        one AND.L #immed + 1 bra.s.  (40.24)

    -   Graphics has added a performance enhancement via VideoControl()
        which allows an application to request that its ViewPort's
        intermediate copper-lists not be kept up-to-date.  Intuition now
        detects and handles such ViewPorts correctly by ensuring that
        MakeVPort() is always invoked on such a ViewPort if MrgCop() is
going
        to be called.  (39.2415)

Yes. And no.

Yes, you can address the serial port in AMOS, but it's not that 
reliable... or so I've found.

Now, correct me if I'm wrong (and it's before 9am, so I'm bound to be 
;-), but it's possible to use TCP: *outside* of AmiTCP? I haven't used it 
for so long, but now you mention TCP:...

Port()? Eh? Sorry, I'm a little bit confused what the Port() command 
is/does...

Hello people.
Something strange happend a while ago with my Email not getting 
anywhere so here are some questions Againg!

Has anyone any ideas about shifting in 128kbytes of data faster than 
this program does it:

Reserve as chip work 10,131072
Open in 1,"PAR:"
Sload 1 to start(10),131072
close 1

this takes 10 to 15 seconds.

Second problem.
If anyone has it can they directly mail me a copy of the arp.library 
version 39 or above, at the address below.
Cheers.

Also!
Can someone forward the bit of mail about uploading stuff to the 
Aminet which appeard recently.  Sorry but I got a bit happy with the 
delete key!

I personally have never had any problems with True. I only use it to set
variables to it. e.g. N=True. For people doing things like If N=True Then...
STOP!!! Just do If N Then... It's faster and it works! Doing this will
make sure you'll never have any problems, whatever AMOS decides to set
True to.

As far as I am aware, statements such as N=True are the only real use of
True.

Hi Peeps!

Since I'm new to this list, I don't know if anyone has asked this
before, but: How do you access a second mouse with AMOS without using an
extension. All a really need is some memory addresses and I can figure
out the rest...

BTW, why has no-one ever bothered to set up an AMOS newsgroup? Surely
that would be better than a mailing list?

I've written several games using the serial port.  It's totally reliable
as far as I can tell.  I have a set of procedures that do a total
serial port set up with prompts for the user, etc.

Hi everyone!
I sent this email already but it got returned to me so I`m not sure if it 
was sent or not but there`s no harm in trying again....

Does anybody know how to get a list of ASSIGNS and DEVICES?
The manual says something like

D$=Dev First$("a/") to get the assigns and
D$=Dev First$("d/") for devices
and then
D$=Dev Next.....

This produces no noticeable result! I`ve tried everything! Does anyone 
know how to do this? (I may not have typed in exactly what was in the 
manual `cos I don`t have it with me, but I tried that and everything else 
I could think of.....)
If Amos can`t do it could the CLI dir command help me?

I just got the Black Dawn 2 demo. Wow... :-O :-))

Ok bye for now...

Ooer hold on a tick...

If you have the compiler or pro compiler choose the no option for 
creating a default screen. Remember to open a screen/load iff/unpack a 
pic etc. before outputing to screen or the program will come to a halt. 
If you`re not copiling put in the line

	Screen Close Screen
or
	Screen Close 0
and you should get the same effect, remember to open one before graphics!

If you want a screen but hate the colours do
	Flash Off
	Palette 0,0,0,0,0,.......,0
to set all colours to black (incidently does ANYONE use the flashing 
colour? I HATE the flippin` thing)

You should Hide the mouse pointer at this point too if you`re not using it.
For a really nice approach for compiled games set default screen to no 
and load up with all workbench colours at black. This means your game 
will load from floppy with no poxy orange screen or any sign of workbench!
Neat?

Hope this helps your prob, 
Have fun

Port() is the supplement command to Open Port.  If you have AMOSPro, its 
on the same pages as Open Port in the manual.  Otherwise, there's no 
solution except to use ARexx to grab the pages.

TCP: is AmiTCP's link to the bsdsocket.library, and this library is only 
open when AmiTCP is running.  You have to be on the 'Net to try stuff 
out.  I had fun whilst getting HTTP to work, as I constantly used 
www.microsoft.com, and I occasionally terminated the link prematurely.

Sorry if this is off topic, but I know someone here can help.

I have a GVP 1230 bellyboard in my 1200, and every since I have had it it 
gets hot and crashes my machine (only in the summer)...anyways, I have 
learned to use a fan on my machine and everything has been o.k.

My main problem NOW is my machine is crashing or not powering up with a 
green screen. The power light flickers, and the screen flashes with green 
and light green colors. This has been a recurring problem every since I 
took my machine to someone I shouldnt have.

I've disconnected EVERYTHING except the bellyboard, and it took my about 
20 tries to get it started again....I finally had to let it cool off for 
a while, and it still crashes after a minute or two. THis has happened 
like 6 times the past 3 days. I am lucky to be on without it crashing.

Is this a ROM problem?
Is this an accellerator problem?
Should I junk my motherboard?
Arghhh!!Helllllllp.....

Firstly, kill that .sig file of yours, then, assuming you have the comp=

If you havn't got the compiler, errrm, don't open an orange screen...

Not really sure about this off hand, but did you two-button guys know that
'mouse key' will also return three-button mouse codes.

	Left	1
	Right	2

..maybe you could try and figure out the judderings from the joystick port
(not really a good idea).  Let me know if you find out.

I know EXACTLY how you feel.. I had a problem almost identical to this.  
I finally realised it was my powerpack that was failing.. I'm not to sure 
about power in 1200's (I have a 500) but this is apparently one of the 
most common problems with Amigas..

Take a look at your P-Pack.. and see if you can get it fixed..

Oreyt!

Wonder if anyone can help?
I have two banks, bank 1 and 2.  Each bank contains sprites.
Bank one contains 5 sprites (1-5)
Bank two contains 1 sprite (1)
Is there an easy way to put the one sprite in bank two into sprite 
position 6 in bank 1 without pasting it on a hidden screen and then 
'get'ing it from the screen?
It is imposible to include the sprite in bank one in the first place.

Thats the problem.

I just got ACE basic off this months Amiga format.  Has anyone else 
got the GUI to work 'cos I cant!

Hi,

On Mon, 21 Oct 1996, Ben Wyatt (who normally make some sort of sense, 
but on this occasion you are talking jibberish ;-) ) wrote:

I never write If N=True Then ....
I write "If N Then...." if and only if N is either 0 or -1
I write "If N=X Then...." if and only if N is anything other than a 
variable which takes either 0 or -1.

But you still come up against problems (as I described earlier) coz when 
I have the code:
USER(0)=True
Print USER(0)
...I do not get -1 !!!!!!!
(in some compiled situations)
This is very annoying but can be solved antisocially by using -1 and 0 
instead of True and False.

Cheers,

Mark

Tried that already. Doesn't work. If anyone's interested, I have managed
to find out the ones for a parellel port joystick adaptor. I'll have to
go and have a look before I can post them though.

Anyway, my original question still stands; anyone got the address(es)?

Or, you could just type "Trap Screen Close 0" at the beginning (but
after the "Set Buffer" command) of your program (if you're using AMOS
Pro). And I agree: if you haven't got the compiler, get it *NOW*!

Hellu!

I have a question:

Is there an easy way  to this:

lets say i have a bob that is abouth 50 pixels Wide/High and has the colour
white.
and then i have for example a picture in hires 16 colours and on that picture
it is some text that have the white colour.
What do i need to do to get it so that the bob is only shown when it is
over the white text, it must not be shown fully only where it is white
text.

Hope you guys understand what i mean and have a easy solution to this one.


Thanx :-)

Why would you want to print -1? By saying USER(0)=True, you are effectively
saying that USER(0) is a boolean value. Therefore, it's not holding data,
it's holding the status of a flag. If you do want to print a boolean value
as an output, do something like:

	If USER(0)
		Print "True"
	Else
		Print "False"
	End if

Printing "-1" or "0" is pretty much meaningless. The actual values of True
and False shouldn't matter - this is hidden inside the language. If AMOS
decides to use some random number for True, let it!

But, if you really HAVE to do what you're wanting to do above, it'd be
better than using the values -1 and 0, to use variables called _TRUE and
_FALSE or something.

I'm simply showing that when you say A=True that doesnt always give you A=-1 !!!

This isnt the point. I gave an example a couple of weeks ago...I guess I'm
going to have o give a similar one again :-(

a=1
b=2
So, a=true, and b=true (as you would like)
But a and b =0 =false which does not equal true!!!

All I am trying to say (even though I'm drunk!) is that when Amos decides to
call True anything other than 1, then when we apply functions such as AND
and OR then we get problems...

>Printing "-1" or "0" is pretty much meaningless. The actual values of True

Look at the example and learn, my friend ;-)

Thanks, I know ;-)

uh, wait a minute.. I just loaded amos pro, and typed the following the
editor.

A=1
B=2
Print A=True
Print B=True

Both print statements returned 0 (False)

If I type:

A=True
B=Not False
Print A=True
Print B=True

Both print statements returned -1 (True)

An If statement will executed it if is NOT equal to False

For instance:

If 0
   Print "Hello world!"
End if

Never prints "Hello world!" no matter what!  The following:

If 1
   Print "Hello world!"
End If

will print "Hello world!" every time.  As long the test equals "Not
False" (anything but False) then the If statement will execute, which is
not a bug in amos.

Greetings.

One and all. I am a newbie to the list, but I am a keen AMOS 
programmer, and I am hoping there are still some AMOS-ers still alive 
somewhere out there on this list.

My first question is, where can I locate a copy of AMOS 3D? I REALLY 
need it for my programming and am interested in any information 
anyone has on locating a copy. I need the manual and all. The only 
related files I have on 3D is the 3D-extension that came with the 
Compiler extension. I am running AMOS Pro. Please e-mail me.

This is a mad technique I used to use when programing in BASIC on my 
beloved ZX Spectrum.  Ah those were the days.
All blimmin languages test all the statements in an 'AND'ed IF.
Using the method above is better.
It does speed things up emensly!

Is my Email getting through or is this absolute shambles of an excuse 
for a network playing up again.  I would be better off sticking my 
head out of the window and shouting.  At least the message would have 
more of a chance of getting somewhere.
Do you know I even have to fill a blimmin form in if I wanna upload 
stuff to Aminet.  Thats all it is around here blimmin forms for this, 
forms for that.
And if computing services are reading this ('cos I know they do (but 
they shouldnt (data protections act and all))), sod off!!!!!!
Sorry had to get that of my chest.

Hello.... 

I want to save two numbers on a file on disk and get them 
back later. 
I save the numbers this way:

A=100
B=200
Open Out 1,"RAM:TEST"
Print #1,A,B
Close 1

But when I try to get them back like this...

Open In 1,"RAM:TEST"
Input #1,A,B
Close 1

I will get an error saying 'type mismatch'. 

What's wrong in this one?

This above example works fine...


My AmosPro manual 10.02.12 says:
Input #channel,variable list
.each value in the list must be separated by
a comma.

I guess thats what confuses me since you put
A$ instead of A,B,C$

But whatever....now the program runs...

Merci bien, Richard.

I'm afraid I'm going to have to shout to get one of the important points in
this topic across:

THE BUG IN AMOS IS THAT IN CERTAIN COMPILED CIRCUMSTANCES AN ASSIGNMENT OF
"TRUE" TO A VARIABLE DOES NOT GIVE "-1". THIS THEN LEADS TO BUGS. (I'M NOT
GOING TO WRITE THE EXAMPLE FOR A THIRD TIME!!!!

Sorry about that bad netiquette, but it seems that this is the only way I
may get the gist of this topic across :-(

Cheers,
        Mark

Not so...
I thought this was a problem but the use of brackets solves this..

	If ((phrase 1) and (phrase 2)) or (phrase 3)

or whatever...

What fun! This is all too exciting for me ;-)

Seriously though I have noticed something else about Amos which is a bit 
odd(?)

Say you have a few conditions, I`ll call them C1,C2,C3,C4; C1 is most 
likely to happen, C4 least likely...

Now if you have an If statement....

	If C1 and C2 and C3 and C4
		...
	Endif

and C1 happens to be false (or zero or whatever!!) the other three C will 
be evaluated in turn EVEN THOUGH C1 IS FALSE, kind of slow if the other C 
are long fiddly equations...

Here`s a better way...

	If C4
		If C3
			If C2
				If C1
					...
				Endif
			Endif
		Endif
	Endif

This will only do the next test if the C is true(or not false etc.)
By putting the least likely first then the next likely and so on you get 
an equivalent to the first lines BUT its faster! (Test it!) the downside 
is its uglier and physically longer :-(

It`s off the point of the old True<>-1 debate but it might be of use to 
someone.....any takers?

Read you soon!

Apologies to all If you have already got this one ...
/\/\att

Hi everyone!
 
Matt again with another does anyone know how to.....

Is there a way of pasting a graphic (bob/sprite/icon/block etc...) so 
colour zero stays transparent but all other colours are pasted as one? (A 
bit like you can with dpaint brushes?) Having copies of bobs/icons in one 
colour is not an option due to the memory it uses.

I hope someone can help me with this and my other recent queries...

Thanks, happy Amosing

Im doing this from my head..
put ,",", between the two numbers becaue amos expects number to be 
seperated by commas when red from a file

hope this helps...

Sorry, no really easy solution. If you weren't using hires, then you
could cheat and use bitplanes, but since you're already using all your
colours, that isn't really an option. Instead, it looks like you'll have
to make a copy of your "16 colour picture), make the "white" bits colour
zero, and pick it up as a whopping great big bob. Then, for each frame,
you:

- Clear the screen
- Paste your little "50 pixels Wide/High" bob
- Paste your whopping great big bob of the entire picture

Of course, this will be rather slow, but I can't think of a faster
solution (apart from the bitplanes one that isn't really appropriate).
Oh, BTW, I recommend that you have double buffering on when using the
above technique, otherwise the effect will be very flickery.

There must be something inherenly wrong with me, or I;m the only person
who understands what's going on with this whole true/false thing.


   a=1
   b=3
   Print a and b  = 1

This is a bitwise "and", not a true/false comparison.

Similarly, 1 and 1 = 1, 2 and 2 = 2, 3 and 2 = 2 etc...


Also, if C1, C2 and C3 were three conditions in order of likelyhood,

   C1 and C2 and C3

will equal false if ANY of them are false, rgardless of likelyhood.
Eg, They ALL have to be true for the entire test to be true.


   something(array)=True

Will always stuff up due to a compiler bug, but

   something(array)=-1

will work just dandy.


True is always -1 (all bits on) in Amos and false is always 0 (all bits
off).

Don't confuse a logical AND with a bitwise AND.  Amos will use the
appropriate one depending un whether or not values other than 0 and -1
are used in the expression.

Otherwise, a construct like:

   size=5+(x>0)*10

wouldn't work.   Which works just fine, compiled or not.

BTW, the line above would replace the following:

  size = 5
  If x>0 then size = 15

I just had to say something, as you all just didn't seem to "get it".

Reagrds, Neil.

Well, your making the output on the same line.

If you check the file with a text viewer, it would be like:

100                           200

Heres a better way:

A=100
B=200

open out 1,"File"
Print #1,a:print #1,b
close

open in 1,"file"
input #1,a:input #1,b
close

print "A is"+str$(a)
print "B is"+str$(b)

This will work much more better.

Actually, AMOS doesn't have a logical AND - all ANDs and ORs and NOTs
are bitwise. Its just when the values in question are all -1 or 0 the
bitwise operations have the same effect as the logical ones. 

P.s. Here is one of the few sentences in the english languages to use
the word and 5 times in succession and still be gramatically correct:
"Two pairs of logical operators are or and and and and and not."

Are you sure? I thought AMOS always used a bitwise AND.

Sure it does. If (x>0) is true, then -1 is returned, otherwise 0. And if
you do "If (x>0) Then..." then (x>0) still returns -1 if it's true. The
"If" checks this and if it's other than 0, it does the "Then" bit.

> BTW, the line above would replace the following:

Or rather, it's:

	size=5
	If x>0 Then size=-5

:-)

Try writing like this:

A=100
B=200
Open Out 1,"RAM:TEST"
Print #1,A
Print #1,B
Close 1

...and reading like this:

Open In 1,"RAM:TEST"
Input #1,A
Input #1,B
Close 1

Hope this helps.

Here we go again!

Using the TCP: device in AMOS is a real pain in the neck!  First off, you 
need to access it with Open Port, as you need to be able to read and 
write to it.  This means you cannot detect EOF with it, which is needed 
as some servers don't send file lengths to files.  This means that Port() 
would be ideal, but its buggy and thrashed TCP: (at least in Miami).

If you need an example, get on the Internet (start AmiTCP), and run this 
AMOS Example:

Open Port 1,"TCP:www.yahoo.com/80"
Print #1,"GET /"
Print #1,""

Set Input 10,-1
Repeat
  Line Input#1,A$ : A$=A$-CHr$(13)
  If Upper$(Left$(a$,15))="CONTENT-LENGTH:"
    FILESIZE=Val(Mid$(A$,16))
  End If
Until A$=""

If FILESIZE>0
  Open Out 2,"Ram:Index.Html"
  B=FILESIZE/1024 : C=FILESIZE mod 1024
  For I=1 to B
    Print #2,Input$(1,1024);
  Next
  Print #2,Input$(1,C);
  Close 2
Endif
Close 1

This small example will grab the Index page from Yahoo!.  Look at it in a 
Web browser, and you'll see that I'm correct.

The TCP:www.yahoo.com/80 device is as follows:

  TCP:    the device
  www.yahoo.com      the computer
  80      the port (80 for HTTP)

That small exchange first is HTTP's way of asking Yahoo! about the index 
file, then getting the file length.  If you were to try Microsoft's Web 
Site (www.microsoft.com/80), the wouldn't give you a file length, and 
you'd be stuck.  You could loop a Port() command, and when you hit -1, 
you could stop reading and close the port, but, as I said, this thrashes 
TCP:.

If you need some more help with TCP:, get GetUrl-1.06.lha from AmiNet.  
This is where I figured al this stuff out.

Yep, absolutely (although I must admit that I had no idea that Amos had 2
different types of AND)

But what if (and this is the case!) you expect "a" to be "True" but a bug in
the compiler sets "a" to "214..." - believe you me this does happen!!! You
write the program expecting "a" to be True or False but it isnt!!!! - this
is where annoying (blameless) bugs can occur.

BTW we have a solution to this whole problem which is to use -1 instead of
True (and I guess we should therefore also use 0 instead of False).

>Similarly, 1 and 1 = 1, 2 and 2 = 2, 3 and 2 = 2 etc...

Very good.

Excellent. 10 out of 10. You may give yourself a pat on the back ;-)

Yeah, I guess its a solution but not ideal...

Surely a bitwise AND on boolean values (ie 0 or -1) will produce the same
result as a logical AND?

I dont understand - whats this got to do with AND?

Hello.

Here is a question.

I found a source where there was 3 round bob,s that moved around on
the screen and when they collided they was in some way transparent or
something like that, it's a bit hard to explain so i sent with the
source so it will be easier to understand.

So i am vondeing if it's possible to make a 1 colour bob transparent so
the background changed colour when the bob moved over like when one bob
moves over another in th e source??

It looks to me as this line ha something to do with it:

Set Bob 1,1,1,%11100010

but i dont know what the numbers after % does.
I know what the first part of the line is for, but i dont know what this
part does: %11100010

Does anybody have an idea?

I don't know where you actually got that BitplanesOverlayDemo from, but  if
you  got it from the PrgCollection.lha in dev/amos, there's another program
called Scheinwerfer2 which just does what you want to.

Yes, I have, for I've written this program ;-)

Your a bit wrong with the %11100010 part of Set Bob, which only is used  to
gain a little bit more speed (this programs runs on an 7mhz A500 uncompiled
with about 50fps).

Take a deeper look at the series of Set Bob commands, you might even should
have a look at the manual. :-)

Ink 1 : Circle 31,31,31 : Paint 31,31,1
[AMCAF Users could use Ink 1 : Fcircle 31,31,31]
Get Bob 1,0,0 To 64,64 : Hot Spot 1,31,31

Draws a filled circle with colour 2^0 = 1.

Ink 2 : Circle 31,31,31 : Paint 31,31,1
Get Bob 2,0,0 To 64,64 : Hot Spot 2,31,31

Draws a filled circle with colour 2^1 = 2.

Ink 4 : Circle 31,31,31 : Paint 31,31,1
Get Bob 3,0,0 To 64,64 : Hot Spot 3,31,31

Draws a filled circle with colour 2^2 = 4.

Each bob in fact contains the same graphics (the shape of the circle),  but
each  in  another bitplane. To keep AMOS from deleting other bitplanes than
the ones the graphics is in (e.g drawing bob 1 should not  erase  areas  in
bitplane 2 & 3), the Set Bob command is used.

Set Bob 1,1,1,%11100010
            ^
Limits the drawing of Bob 1 to bitplane 1 (%001 = 2^0 = 1).

Set Bob 2,1,2,%11100010
            ^
Limits the drawing of Bob 2 to bitplane 2 (%010 = 2^1 = 2).

Set Bob 3,1,4,%11100010
            ^
Limits the drawing of Bob 3 to bitplane 3 (%100 = 2^2 = 4).

If you haven't understood the technique yet, have a look at the  additional
informations  which  can  be found in the AMCAF Manual, Chapter 'Additional
Index/Bitplanes'. ;-)

Here is another question for you smart guy's to help me with:

I am going to fade a 16 colour hires picture from black and up to
the original colours.


So after the load, spack and unpack commands for the picture i have
set a line like this:

Palette 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0


so then all the colours is black.

An then i want to fade the black colours up to the original colours
that the picture has when you view it from D-Paint.

So then i use Fade 5,$???,$???  and so on for each of the 16 colours.
But the problem is that i dont know witch numbers i must set in instead
of the ??? so that the picture will have the same colours as it have from
D-paint.
I know $0 is black and $FFF is white, but i dont know anymore.

Lets say the first colour in D-paint has:


R:       32
G:  16
B:  16


What will the first (Fade 5,$???) value be in amos for that colour and how
do i find it out.


Thanx!

Hello!

Here is yet another question from me:


I have a logo in Hires 14 colours that takes up the upper half of
the picture and the rest of the screen under and around is black.
And i have a some sort of scroll text that scrolls text from the bothom
of the screen and up like it is in the end of most movies exept that on
the movies it moves down.

So what i want is that when the white text moves upwards and hits the
logo it moves under the 14 other colours than the black and white colour.
Instead of moving over the logo.

Anybody have a easy solution to do this exept for making the logo a BIG
bob?

Thanx for all help!

Pardon to all for my blatherings the other day...

In my hurried message I got the result of that wierd formula wrong,
mainly because I didn't bother to work out what the result was.

The formula was to do with the true/false thing.  An yes, Amos only
has a bitwise AND (too many languages, I get muddled sometimes)

Anyway, If you guys would care to give your opinions on a few things
I've written, it would be appreciated.

Elevators in game/board
LaserRace in game/board
Poswiz_demo in biz/demo

All are written in Amos, the games are quite old, Poswiz is a
commercial product, version 2 nearing completion.  Any suggestion
are welcome.

I'll go back in my corner now... :)

Regards, Neil.

You'd be better off with DPaint IV ECS, not the AGA-version. Then you only
can choose between 16 values in the palette-definer in DPaint.
0 and up to 9 is the same in DPaint and Amos. But when you get to 10 in
DPaint, it is the same as $A in Amos. So a color with the values 10,15,9 in
Dpaint is $AF9 in AMOS.

10=$A
11=$B
12=$C
13=$D
14=$E
15=$F

Hi All,

A friend asked me to post this idea about PAL/NTSC:

Subject: Cross pond compatibility.
Language: Amos Pro

NTSC Amigas do not need to be switched to PAL to run ___x256 PAL programs.
If you use the NTSC command to detect the video mode, and you use the
Screen Display number,x,y,width,height command (use the y coordinate to
raise the screen) to raise the screen into the NTSC Overscan area most PAL
games will be playable.  With a little creativity (automatic or manual
autoscroll, multi screen fluff graphics covering up techniques) you can
even get overscan PAL games to run in NTSC mode.

End.

Bye,
-Chris.

 m> I know $0 is black and $FFF is white, but i dont know anymore.

Load your picture and then dim an array of the size of screen colours. Then
copy all the colours values in the array and that's all!
Let's pretend your picture has 16 colours, so enter:

Load Iff "My_own_picture.iff",0
Dim C(15)
For T=0 to 15
   C(T)=Colour(T)
Next

Now you have in C() all the colours: put those value in your Fade command.

ALL is right but $A $B ..etc is NOT only an AMOS notation but 
hexadecimal notation of colour parts (RGB).
$ marked all hexadecimal numbers in AMOS.

decimal val.0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 
    hex val.0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A  B  C  D  E  F

That sounds like a problem with the memory size.  The anim is one of Q
dancing on the bridge while the mariachi band plays music.  What kind of
Amiga do you have and how much memory of each?

Unfortunately, since the samples and such are total ST:TNG rips,
accepting money for it would be a little dicey.

That's a thought.  I'll keep that in mind for the upgrade.

You're dealing with hexadecimal numbers there.  As you know, each colour
register can be 0-15 (0-255 in your example).  First off, divide your numbers
by 16 to get a value from 0-15.  Then, for each color (RGB), 0-9 are the same,
10 is A, 11 is B, etc.

>R:       32
>G:  16
>B:  16

$211

Another Example:

R: 240
G: 128
B: 14

Divide by 16

R: 15
G: 8
B: 0

$F80

My friend has just written a daft little game in which there are 4 blokes 
on a screen, all controlled with joysticks (2 of which using the parallel 
port adaptor thing), who run around picking up weapons and killing each 
other. Well, when you run it from AMOS it works just fine (a bit slow), 
but when you compile it and then load it, when the joystick in the normal 
joystick port is moved or fired, the stupid computer decides to have a 
bit of a crash session. My friend has threatened to eat himself if he 
can't work out what is happenning. PLEASE HELP HIM!

Thanks,

This parallel port thing caused me problems a while back while I was 
designing my video frame capture thingy.
I couldnt find any info on direct parallel access so I just had to 
put up with putting some feedback into the computer.
If anyone has any info on accessing the parallel port directly I to 
would be greatful for it.

Using the parallel port through Amos (using the operating system) is 
slow (very slow).

The easiest way to controll stuff through your computer is by the 
serial port !.
There is an IC (cant remember number sorry) that will directly 
connect to the serial port and will give you 8 bits output and 8 bits 
input.  This is quite easy to use from Amos.  I will get the part 
number and mail it here tomorrow if I remember!

Goodybye!

I hope this is correct but as I am about 25 miles from home I have no 
reference stuff with me.

If you have a clone of the screen in screen 1
from your screen with all black colours do something like

Fade 3 to 1

This, if I remember correctly should fade the current screen at a 
speed of 3 to the colour palette of screen 1

Erm, Hope someone backs me up on this!

Greetings.

I've got a question and some comments to you guys.

Question: What is this "Solotrek" you guys have been talking 
about. I believe it was Mr. Giark to You that mentioned it and it 
sounds really interesting, and of course, I am a big Trekkie and have 
had plans for a cool TNG game in AMOS for about 2 years. Someone 
please fill me in on this.

Comments: I do want to say I like this list. You get questions and 
you give answers, and sometimes the other way around. I have started 
my own software company, hence Parrottsoft, and just started projects 
for it I've been planning for about 2 years before I purchased any 
AMOS products.

My first, current, and really big project I'm working on at the 
moment is a 3D engine similar to Build and Quake, with the 
multi-level sectors (like in Duke Nukem where you can fly around and 
things..) and those sorts of things. Anyways, the engine is still in 
it's early stages and there's no telling where exactly its going to 
go, however I do have an idea where I would like for it to go. I am 
always open to suggestions for new utilities and games, and I would 
like some input on my 3D engine as I construct it.

Please visit my homepage for more information and spread the word 
around about it. If you need any more information, of course e-mail 
me. Thanks once again.

Hi!
Im new on the amos-mailing list.

Ive got some problems with Amos3d:
Amos 3d rotates by joining three 2d rotations around the x,y and z-axis.
(First rotate about a then about b and then c.)
The effect is that any rotation the axes are used like:

a: x-axis, full object relative.
b: b-axis: depends on the a and c-axis.
c: z-axis full global world relative.

My problem is: i want an real 3d-rotation about 3
object-relative axes:


   y   z    z:forward
   |  /     x:left/right
   | /      y:up-down
   |/
---o---x
  /|
 / |
/  |


what i need is a code that convert three object-attitude-relative axes to tree
angles a,b,c for the Td Anlge Rel command.
could anyone post me some hints or (would be great) the amos-sourcecode parts
for the control of the camera-object (0)

Please answer!

e-mail to geisler@ibm.net

Paul Geisler, Hamburg, Germany (Sorry for all the bad english!!!  ;-)

(im waiting 1 year for an answer for this problem!)

The numbers after the $ mean red value 0-15 green 0-15 blue 0-15. The 
reasn that letters some times appear is that it is hex notation (base 16) 
so after 1,2,3...,8,9 it goes a,b,c,d,e,f and then 10. It`s handy for the 
colours though.
eg Blue $00F Navy $005
   Green $0F0
They work like light so red+green=yellow
			green+blue=cyan etc.
When you type in some numbers Amos might change them eg $00F -> $F it 
doesn`t matter ,it`s just disgarding unneeded zeros.

About your black -> colour fade.

Load "your picture",0 : Screen Hide 0
SC=Screen Colour
Dim _COL(SC)
For I=0 To Sc
	_COL(I)=Colour(I)
	Colour(I)=0
Next
Screen Show 0 : Rem the screen is black
Wait key
Fade 1,_COL(0),_COL(1),_COL(2),......etc
Wait key
Fade

Note: This will work for any palette.
      I`m not sure if `Screen Colour` is spelt right (I`m doing this from 
memory)- Check the manual if its wrong.

P.S. I also have a routine which fades a screen to a dimmed grey image 
and back, If anyone wants it drop me a line!

Hope this helps!
Happy Amosing,

Hi everyone...
At the moment I`m working on a Hired Guns style game in Amos.
What I`m wondering is does anybody have the origin Hired Guns and drew 
their own characters because (no coincidence) I use these in my game ;-)
If anyone has some characters drawn and/or would like to help me with gfx 
for my game please contact me!

Please foward this to anybody you know who might be able to help.....

Thanks.

Greetings Fellow AMOS Lovers/Users/Both,

I have recently joined this list in the hope that I will keep abreast of 
the attitudes towards and the support available for AMOS.

I have currently got a game, by the name of Am-Tank, in circulation. It 
is available from my Web Site at:

   http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ma4rms/home.html

It is also available from the AmiNet under game/2play.

However, far more interestingly...it is public domain and as such the 
source code is also avaialble for you to peruse. The source is only 
available from my page, no the Aminet.

As a matter of interest, Am-Tank has featured on two Computer Magazines 
in the world. That must mean something?

Anyway, feel free to send your comments and suggestions to me at either 
of the following two addresses:

   ma4rms@bath.ac.uk

   rms@abingdon.geoquest.slb.com (Until July '97)

Enjoy!

Rich

In light to all the different methods of fading I have seen in this list
over the last few days, I thought I may as well place here the fading
procedure I use every day for my games and utilities. If you set it as
an AMOSPro accessory in the menu, the program will ask for the IFF file
you wish the palette read from, and directly paste the $RGB figures
straight into your program at the cursor, so there is no need for any
arrays and long lines etc.

Enter this short program into AMOS, and add it to your accessory menu:

Set Accessory

Dim C(31)

Screen Open 0,640,26,8,Hires
Flash Off : Curs Off : Cls 0
Screen Display 0,128,42,640,26

Input "Palette or Fade (p/f) >";A$
A$=Lower$(A$)

Load Iff Fsel$(""),1
Flash Off : Curs Off
Screen Hide 1

For G=0 To 31
   C(G)=Colour(G)
Next

Screen 0

Call Editor 29
If A$="p"
   B$="Palette "
   For G=0 To 31
      B$=B$+Hex$(C(G),3)+","
   Next
   B$=Left$(B$,Len(B$)-1)
   Call Editor 71,,B$
End If
If A$="f"
   B$="Fade "
   Print
   Input "Fade speed > ";A
   Input "Wait (y/n) >";C$
   C$=Lower$(C$)
   B$=B$+Str$(A)-" "+","
   For G=0 To 31
      B$=B$+Hex$(C(G),3)+","
   Next
   B$=Left$(B$,Len(B$)-1)
   If C$="y"
      B$=B$+" : Wait "+Str$(A*15)-" "
   End If
   Call Editor 71,,B$
End If

Screen Close 1 : Screen Close 0


There you go. I have also got the procedures for getting at the palettes
for Icon banks and Bob banks, if you are interested. Log your FTP
program to mushy-pd.demon.co.uk and look in the graphics section for
PALPROCS.LHA which has all these programs ready for your accessory menu.

Im looking for new PD to add to the library. Please upload any recent
projects you have along with a short .Readme file to the uploads drawer,
or UUxT them to me at:  mpd@mushy-pd.demon.co.uk

I hope this short routine solves everyones problems.

Hi =


I have great problems with my equation file for AMOSPro 2.0
When I try to use en eqaute editor says "Cannot load equate file"
I have tryed everything (I even got a new copy of AMOSPro System disk
from Europress but it didn't help) and you guys are my only chance.
I tryde to shorten the file and to change its path in Interpreter
Settings but nothing worked. Len Tucker of AMOS Support suggested that I
should use Set Double Precision but that faild to. Please if anyone else
is having the same problem write to the list.

I am developing a Dialog Editor s=E5 I desperately need the equation
features.

Hi 

I'd like to know what is the book like. You can compare it with either
AMOSPro Manual or Amiga Game Maker's Manual with AMOS Basic or anything
you think will describe it best.

Sounds interesting, but a word of advice: I strongly recommend that
your write the engine in C and possibly include some asm routines to
speed up things.
If you're going to make it in AMOS you're going to have difficulties
when (if) the new PowerAmigas arrive. + It will be hard to use 256
AGA colors in Amos (though it's possible to write custom copperlist to
do this). For such projects as yours, you'll need to split the source
to small bits, which is very easy with C.

But anywayz, good luck with your projects!

Subject: RE: Cursor changing
Status: O
X-Status: 

As far as I know, you cannot change the cursor shape to that of a bob or
sprite, but can change the way it looks. By default, it is the
Underscore character "_" but can be changed to anything using standard
binary commands.

The cursor is an 8x8 grid, which can be defined using the standard
binary conversion from 0's and 1's or you could use the correct values
if you know how to convert binary. Here is a brief explanation. Each
line is broke up in to 8 bits. Each bit has its own value. These values
are then added up which gives you a total between 0 and 255. Eg:

The bit on the far left of the binary is always 128. The next to the
right is 64, and the next is 32, 16,8,4,2, and 1 being the far left. Add
those totals up in that string which have a number 1, and you will know
the figure to enter.

                        11111111   =    255
                        10000001   =    129
                        10000001   =    129
                        10000001   =    129
                        10000001   =    129
                        10000001   =    129
                        10000001   =    129
                        11111111   =    255

So SET CURS 255,129,129,129,129,129,129,255 would turn the cursor into
this box. Try it. If you are lazy, you could always do something like:

L1=%11111111
L2=%10000001

Set Curs L1,L2,L2,L2,L2,L2,L2,L1

Which does the same thing, by giving the value in numbers to L1 and L2,
the string of 1's and 0's you defined. I used this technique on my games
on the speccy.

If AMOSPro cuts numbers off the line when you hit the ENTER key, dont
worry, its cutting it to a shorter version.

Ooooooh...non-orthogonal 3D routines!  [drooling]  Do you have working 
AMOS source code to that sucker?!?  This has awlays been my biggest 
goal.  And the speed problem is true.  I've written a Wolf3D game...only 
one level, but very easily expandable.  If you'd like to see it, I'll put 
it up on my Web Site for all to see.

I'd be more than interested to see it.

Hmm, I guess duke nukem isn't done in "wolf"-style, but the walls and
stuff are polygons which are "sorted" with BSP.

I've written a wolf engine myself too, anyone care to see it? 
It's in aminet (demo/aga if I remember right) and the filename is
My3dEngine.lha. It's a bit old by now, but has some monsters and special
effects :)

Please put it up. I thought your orginal 3D amos engine was very good.
For those of you with access to a PC, you can get some 3D source code and
exe's from my page.

Changing the pointer in amos reads easy in the bible but I have never 
got it to work so I use Amal.
This is without using it for a while so try this.

Hide
sprite 8,150,150,image number
Amal 8,"Loop: Let X=XM ; Let Y=YM ; Jump Loop"
Amal on 8

Erm! I think the XM any YM are correct above but if I am wrong 
someone will correct me.
image number is the image number of the image in the sprite bank.  
And it can be any size/colour whatever.

Hello people.

This isnt really Amos related more C related really but since this is 
the only list I am on here it is:
(But I suppose you could use the librarys from Amos)

Does anyone out there know where I can get hold of descriptions of 
some of the librarys.  In particular the intuition library and 
graphics library etc....
Is there somewhere on the WWW where I can get hold of this stuff?

Fellow AMOSers:

I would lilke to thank all of you on the list that has given me both 
criticism and praise for my upcoming projects, not to mention my 3D 
engine. Keep it coming. I always love to hear everyones input.

To John Bintz:
I'm not ready to release any of my source code as I do the 
programmers thing: split your whole project up into stages of code, 
and right now I'm in the 2nd or 3rd stage of my engine, and I am not 
ready to release any of it yet. However, I do have a Web page for my 
company, Parrottsoft, and when I do happen to finish this engine, I 
will release it alone and incorporated into some 3D games as 
shareware, the engine for a bout $35 US and the games about $20-30 
each US, depending on the game. Fair price for a good engine eh?

The only thing that I WILL tell you guys about my engine, and that 
may motivate you is: 1. DONT GIVE UP. It takes alot of hard work. Of 
course most of you should know that by programming in AMOS. 2. The 
walls and textures are rotated using the ZOOM command. Try it. I'm 
not going to say anything else. You figure it out.

Btw, to Mr. Bintz and Giark I think it was, please do post your Wolf- 
like engines on Aminet and your homepages (please give me the URLs to 
your pages, btw) and I will look at them. If you will submit them to 
me, I will post them on my page, as long as they are not very big.

Again, thanks. Long live the Amiga!

Hi!


Some questions:
Does anyone have the AMOS3D Editor that they could e-mail in DMS form?
Would anyone like to program some GUIs for my new AMOS package?
Does anyone else have the problem that I have when using the AMOSPro
Interface - my text and buttons regularly become corrupted - if so, how do I
stop it!?

If you`re going to use amal a better bet is to use the autotest system.
,it will be smoother than the above. There was a perfect example in the 
old Amos manual but the AmosPro isn`t as clear... read up the section on 
AUtotest in Amal for more details.

A cheap alternative to the pointer problem is to change the colours used.
If you have Pro the pointer shape is fairly acceptable and you can make 
it look ok if you get rid of the poxy brown/orange colours.

Try:
Colour 17,$fff
Colour 18,$5
Colour 19,0

Near the start of your prog.

Note: I`m note sure if its cols 16 to 18 or 17 to 19 for the pointer! 
Just play around in direct mode for the look you want!

If you have Amos with its poxy HUGE pointer  .........

Ok, for the pointer, you hve to be very specific.  Your Bob (yes it
needs to be a bob) must be LO RES and FOUR(4) colours.  It should be
16x16, but I think you can make the height more if you need to.

Well met and godspeed,

Hi everyone...
 
I just thought I'd let you know about the new piece of software that I have
uploaded to the internet - I've decided to send it to you, but if you are
unable to recieve attachments then you should be able to find it in
pub/aminet/gfx/misc on the ftp.wustl.edu site sometime tomorrow or over the
weekend.

It is programmed by Peter Clark and is called Sound Anims Plus.  It is a
simple but friendly utility that lets you add sounds to your animations.  A
CLI player is included and, if you register, you will recieve an AMOSPro
Procedure that plays the anims.
