                         -----------------------
                 
This program adds four very simple, but very useful utilities, to the 
AMOSPro editor's user menu. They are:

 
SCANCODE

 - Press a key, and it's scancode is inserted in your program at the
   current cursor position.
   

ASCII

 - Press a key, and it's AscII code is inserted in your program at the
   current cursor position.
   
   
FILE

 - Select a file from the file requester which appears, and the full path
   of that file is inserted in quotes into your program at the current
   cursor position.


UNFLIP

 - Unflips any fliped Sprite / Icon images. Call it before loading the
   object editor to get all the objects unflipped in the object editor.


Also, it replaces all the AMOSPro Search & Replace menu option with new
improved versions.



Installation
============

Install the new Default Resource Bank as described in the file 
Default_Resource_Bank.Doc first.


Unfortunately, there is a lot to do. You install each of the 4 user
menu utilities seperately - If you really don't want any of them, you
can skip adding them to the user menu, or if you are a masochist, you
can not change the search functions, but if you install 1 part of the
program, you might as well to the rest - it won't take any more memory
(Well OK, a few bytes for the strings you enter)

NOTE: Either install all search menu functions, or none of them. If you
      install just some of them, they won't work properly.
      



1) Put the Editor_Enhancer.AMOS file in it's permanent location, and on
   the AMOS Pro boot disk / hard disk, if you don't want any disk swaps.
   AMOSPro_Accessories: is a good place.

2) Load the AMOSPRo editor.

3) Select 'Add Option' on the user menu, and type 'Get Scancode' into
   the requester, and press OK.
   
4) Select the 'Get Scancode' option which has now appeared on the user
   menu when asked which menu option to assign a program to, then select
   the Editor_Enhancer.AMOS program.
   
5) In the next requester, set the options as below, then press OK:

   - Run as hidden program
   
   - Keep after running (Important that this is on)
   
   - Command line = 'SCANCODE' (Without the quotes)
   
6) If you want a keyboard shortcut, select the 'Get Scancode' menu option
   again, then press the keyboard shortcut. If you chose not to add a
   shortcut, don't worry, you can do so later on with the 'Set key Shortcut'
   option in the config menu.
   
7) Repeat steps 3-6 to add three more options, 'Get AscII', 'Get Filename',
   and 'Unflip Images', setting the command line to 'ASCII', 'FILE' and
   'UNFLIP' in each case.


8) Select 'Set Program To Menu' from the config menu, the choose the
   'Search New' from the search menu. Select the Editor_Enhancer.AMOS
   in the file selector. In the next requester, set the options to:
   
   - Run as hidden program
   
   - Keep after running (Important that this is on)
   
   - Command line = 'FIND'
   
9) Repeat step 8 five more time, selecting each search menu item in turn,
   and setting the command lines to 'FIND NEXT', 'FIND PREVIOUS', 'REPLACE',
   'REPLACE NEXT', 'REPLACE PREVIOUS'.
   
10) Select 'Save Default Config' from the Config menu to make the changes
    you have made to the menu permanent. Alternatively, you may save to a
    different configuration file with 'Save Config'. If you chose the later,
    you must reload this configuration with 'Load Config' every time you
    use AMOS Pro.   

    Try the program before saving the configuration - if you are seriously
    deranged, and don't like it, don't save the configuration, then call
    a shrink to help you work through your problem (Or if you are a shrink,
    find a mirror, and don't get offended at the term 'shrink' - I'm to
    crap at spelling to even contemplate thinking about the spelling of
    the P word).



Usage - User menu
=================

        Select the appropriate user menu option. The first time you do so,
        the program is loaded, and will then remain in memory. It will then
        appear in the accessories list on the program menu. Do not run it
        from here, as you cannot set the command line. However, you can
        select 'New' on this menu to remove it from memory.


Usage - Search menu
===================

        Search menu options are activated in the same way they were 
        previously. The differences are:
	
        - A busy pointer appears instead 'Press Control-C to abort'.
          You can still press Ctrl-C to abort though.
	
        - The Replace Next / Replace Previous functions replace the
          occurance of the search string that is currently beneath
          the cursor, then look for the next/previous occurance. The
          original versions searched, then replaced, but this mean't
          that you could not see the occurance you are replacing! If
          you select Replace Next / Replace Previous when the cursor
          is not over the last occurance of the search string found by
          one of the search commands, a Search Next / Previous is performed
          instead.
	  
	  
        The Search New / Replace New requester has the following
        features:
	
        [F1] Backwards

            When checkmarked, the initial search is backwards from the
            current cursor position
	
        
        [F3] From Begining
	
            The search begins from the top of the program when this
            is checkmarked.
	    
	    
        [F4] Search Strings
	
            Occurances within strings are only found / replaced if 
            this option is checkmarked.
	  
	  
        [F5] Search Comments	  

            Occurances within comments are only found / replaced if
            this option is checkmarked.
            
            
        [F6] Search Code
        
            Occurances outside comments & strings are only found / replaced
            if this option is checkmarked.


        In the replace section, if either box is checkmarked, then the
        occurances are replaced immediately, otherwise, the first occurance
        of the search string (Using F1 & F3 settings) is found, and the
        replace string is used in all future Replace Next / Replace Previous
        calls, until it is changed.
        
        NOTE: If the search string is empty when you exit the requester,
              the search / replace operaion is always canceled. The
              replace string may be empty to search & delete.



Cavat
=====

        You can't use any of the menu functions assigned to this
        program if it is in an open edit window. Hide it if you
        have this problem. This does mean it is impossible to use
        search / replace on this programs source code!




De-Installation
===============

        You want to remove my wonderful program ???????????????????
        
        
        
        
        
        Well, if you just want the memory back after using it, select
        it on the accessories menu, and 'New' it. If you want to remove
        a user menu option permanently, select 'Delete Option' from the
        user menu, then the option to delete. If you want the get the
        original search / replace functions back, select 'Set Program To
        Menu' from the config menu. Remember to save the configuration
        after making any changes.




Development
===========

        Send ideas for more features / bug reports to me (Paul Hickman)
        via e-mail (ph@doc.ic.ac.uk). Also if you modify the program,
        please send me back the changed copy for redistribution. I actively
        encourage do to add features to this program - it should be
        obvious how to do so - just put an extra 'Else If' in the main
        program. Use 'Reserve As Data' to store permanent variables between
        runnings of the program. Insert code to reset these to the default
        values in the	
	




Legal Stuff
===========

        This program may be freely distributed in its original form 
        as long as no profit is made from doing so, either directly,
        or indirecty. Modified versions may also be distributed under
