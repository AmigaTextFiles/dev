Is this a separate program that has to be run, or something that has
to be added to an AMOS source? Either way, I'd be interested in
having a look!

btw, Mush, how about sending me the HTML for your banner so I can
add a link to my web page?

Subject: GUI Ext problem
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

X-Status: 


Greetings to all AMOS Listers;

I've been having problems getting started with the GUI Ext. 

I'm using AMOS Pro 2.0 and have v1.62 of the GuiExt.

Here's the story so far:

1) I've installed the extension as per the installation instructions.(I
think!)

2) I've downloaded the gadtoolsbox20c.lha archive, though when I run it, it
says it's v.20b.

3) I've made a test gui in gadtoolsbox and saved it unpacked, topaz 8, etc.

4) When I run GuiConv.AMOS the file selector comes up asking for the *.gui
file and I select my file.
  
 And here's the problem.......the file selector closes and immediately
re-opens again asking for the *.gui file.
It won't cancel and it won't accept any other gui file either. 

Am I missing something obvious? If anyone recognises this and can help, I'd
sure appreciate it.

He emailed me several weeks ago saying he was doing an Amiga version and
was having a few problems in writing a compiler (rather than an interpreter
which the PC version basically was), and he asked me for some help. I asked
for more details and haven't heard from him since.

I thought he was on this list. Are you out there Carl?

Unfortunately this link to the PENTOS beta no longer works.  Could someone
point me
to a valid archive?

On a related point.  I went down to the Amiga show in Columbus on Saturday.
I didn't get to see
as much as I would have liked but I did get an Amiga.  I picked up an A2000
with 8 Meg Ram, a 2 Meg Agnus
(which I gather is a good thing...) a 340 Meg IDE hard drive and a monitor
for $183.  That was the good
news.. The bad news?  NO ONE HAD A COPY OF AMOS!  I couldn't even find the
cover disk version.
I did pick up something called 'Easy-Amos' that I haven't had much chance to
look at.

Can anyone tell me where I can still buy AMOS?  Preferably AMOS PRO and
COMPILER.  Altrenately a
downloadable or e-mail of the cover-disk would be great till I can locate an
retail copy.

Thanks

Carl

Ehh, Does any of you know how the SLN extension ended up, was 2.0 the
latest or did Søren make newer versions ????

Hiya guys,

Just  to say thanx for all the info on the Easy Life Iconify option. I
was  using  EL  V1.44  and  have now downloaded V1.10 which is a newer
version!!!

It  now  works  a  treat and I can at last return the CPU when Amos is
Iconified.

Another  thing I found was a neat util called Amos Patch which at last
lets  Amos compiled progs multi-task with other Amos compiled jobbies.

One  more thing....has anyone heard from Chris Hodges lately? (Calling
Chris.....)

BTW  Even  though Chris Evans is away at Uni, his dad is mega kewl and
sends  me plenty of emails! He's a wicked dad. Down to earth and knows
how to use Amiga's!!! My dad is never that kewl, is yours????

And  a  final message to all of you who are in the progress of writing
or  updating  an  Amos Extension, please could you add a command which
allows text to scroll off in the distance ala Star Wars fashion?

I asked Chris to add this to an update of Amcaf and he says he'll try.
Anyone else.....?

And can anyone actually get the Comp Test Off command to work????


And  I  would  like  to  say thanx to Garfield for AIG. It's very neat
indeed.  I  haven't  found  any  bugs  with  it  (yet)  but  one small
niggle....When  i  access  the  pull  down menu, half the loaded piccy
vanishes!  Ping!  But  it  does return after I let go of the mouse, so
it's fine.

One  thing I'd like to see is an option to actually scroll through the
bobs manually, or just an option to replay them as an anim. Once isn't
enough.  What about a speed control so we can make sure everyone is in
perfect position?

Just a thought....

Cheers.

cya l8r....

Andy Gee!

thus comment on GUI Ext problem on the night of 02-Nov-97:

-> 3) I've made a test gui in gadtoolsbox and saved it unpacked, topaz 8, etc.

-> 4) When I run GuiConv.AMOS the file selector comes up asking for the *.gui
-> file and I select my file.
->   
->  And here's the problem.......the file selector closes and immediately
-> re-opens again asking for the *.gui file.
-> It won't cancel and it won't accept any other gui file either. 

-> Am I missing something obvious? If anyone recognises this and can help, I'd
-> sure appreciate it.

Did you make the GuiConv.AMOS prog run as an accessory (add it to your user
menu and call it from there) ?

What it should do, is automatically ask you for a .Abk file to save it in,
as it saves it to disk and needs the accessory part as it will write it
into bank 20 of your program automatically.

If you want, send me the GUI file personally, and I will see if I can find
the problem for you.

-> I did pick up something called 'Easy-Amos' that I haven't had much chance

Easy AMOS (from what ive seen, which is very little) is a more simplified of
AMOSPro, 
yet is supposed to be able to do exactly the same things. The good thing
is, it will work with the AMOSPro Compiler.

I sell the AMOSPro compiler from my homepages (I have a couple left still)
so if you go to www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk you might find a bit more info on it.

Im currently in negotiations to get AMOSPro, but at the moment, the manual

order for it to be the right prce  =/

YO !!!!

Ok, this is third time I'm posting this problem to the list, and I've got
no responses on the first two.. But as they say 3rd time lucky....

Does anyone have a new 'printer dump' procedure, either in an extension or
a simple amos-code. The command in Amos Pro 2.0 crashes when used with all
the parameters. I've looked at the source code for the I/O extension, but
I'm not capable of finding the error....

Come on, somebody must have been in trouble with this before, what did you
do, simply give up ??????????

Ya, that's the right one.

This doesn't matter for compiling it, but you need to be on a PAL hi-Res
non-laced screen, using Topaz/8 for it to come out correctly.

The file you save is the normal GTB one, not the code for c or asm or
anything.

Make sure you're using the saved data from the GTB, not any generated source.

Many thanks to Mush and Giark for their response to my request..

Giark wins with the Hi Res PAL screen requirement that I somehow forgot
about...I'm sure dumping the old gadtools install and starting from with a
fresh installation didn't hurt either!

Now, on to more of the gui adventure in AMOS.

Thanks again,
Dale

Hi!
I have a Pal machine so am used to all the various to dos with that.
I can also force the computer to use an NTSC screen by using a
specific Doke. (Similar I suppose to Set Ntsc in AMCAF). What I'm
wondering is this:
1) How close to a real NTSC machine is this?
ie if my game fits on my pretend NTSC machine will it be okay on a
real one?

2) If a real Ntsc machine used Set Ntsc or Set Pal (or my Doke) what
would happen?

Don't use the amos printer commands. Open a port to PRT: and then take control
yourself.

Probably the program was compressed using the SQUASH compiler options...

just a note:


              *DON'T USE THE COMILER SQUASH OPTIONS!!!!!!!!*


The squasher is very,very bugged!!!!

Do you've saved your GUI as a GUI file? and remember that your file name
must finish with .gui extension.

?? I don't think I can make a screen-dump that way, sending text, fine, but
graphics ????. The alternative as I see is to open the printer.device and
feed it the parameters manualy and then send a device do, but I don't know
how to do it (or should I say, I don't know how to get the values the device
wants to make the dump)....

   Have little idea as I have never seen a true PAL machine use the
   NTSC-switch.

   I assume it is very close to a true NTSC-mode machine...


> 2) If a real Ntsc machine used Set Ntsc or Set Pal (or my Doke) what

   Depends... If we had booted in PAL then we'd flip back to NTSC-mode.
   If we were already in our native NTSC-mode then our display would
   not change at all.

   As for switching to PAL, it would be the same for us.  If we had booted
   in PAL then no effect from the PAL-switcher, but if we were in our
   native NTSC-mode, we'd be switched to PAL-mode.

   When I switch to Pal, using Poke $DFF1DC, 32, my display shifts up
   around 30 pixels, leaving a large blank area in the lower part of the
   display.

   Apparently, the display is actually "compressed" and perhaps the
   starting line is shifted up a bit as well to allow a PAL-screen to fit
   within the display.

   If any of you PAL-users have played an NTSC-only game then I
   assume you know what I'm talking about.  The screen is way up to
   the top of the monitor and there is a large blank area at the bottom.

   
   Hope this helps...


      Take  care,

Hmm, I tried that program you sent me, and it couldnt allocate itself in
memory, even though I had 5.5 Mb free.

Well, its my 21st today (4th), so im off to get drunk.

P.S. The FTP site might not be up today, or then again, might be on for a
few days, as I could be too hung over to bear the noise of the clicking

TFX wont play in NTSC mode, even if you use hacks and such, and the black bar
still makes it boot in PAL mode, no matter what you do to it.

I think so, but I don't have a PAL Amiga.

It would flip to 50 MHz move the top of the screen higher, but still be 
limited to the max NTSC overscan display of 237 v Amos or 241 v WB.
To get a true PAL screen you need to set PAL in the early boot menu 3.0, 
and up.

Thanks for the prog, but it is not a TRS like the old PC DOS TRS's, so TFX
just shut it down with the WB.

I need something nasty like a virus that will kick TFX's ass if it tries to
shut it down.

Eric, consider a hardware switch. On 2000 its very easy (jumper on the
motherboard) and its actually not too dodgy on a 500 either (I did it myself,
took about 10 minutes).

Fairly close. The single doke only changes the screen sync, however.

Yes, but the timing will be off.

You need to use two commands: a doke to set the pal/ntsc mode on the agnus and
a poke to set the computer timing speed to match. If you want the stuff, let
me know and I can send youu my tips file #1 that contains the info.

Cap'n Bubba uses the correct pal/ntsc switching method for complete mode
emulation. (Sorry, had to plug the game!)

Hi all you Amos wizards.

Iv'e trying to get the EasyLifeMUI.guide to work fully :+)
and keeps fighting in the dark '+(.

The problem is:

Unpack the MUI developers archive (mui22dev.lha) = I did and also tryed
(mui38dev.lha)

Convert the MUI autodocs to amigaguide format = I tryed but with no luck '+(

AdToHt AUTODOCS=autodocs INCLUDES=<Include Dir> HYPERTEXT=<DestDir> = Does not
work
because adtoht does not recognice the 'AUTODOCS' and the 'INCLUDES' '+(

Iv'e tryed different versions:
ADtoHT 2.1 (1995/04/22)
ad2ag 39.2 (1992/12/ 9)
ad2ht 33.67 (1991/11/15)
NON of them works with the lines mentioned in the EasyLifeMUI.guide '+(

If anybody has installed the autodocs, and they work then please take
me by the hand, and lead me safe through the procedures, becourse I can't
figure the trick '+(

Enough crying from me ;+)

*PLEASE* *HELP* *ME* *!* *!* *!* *!*

Time is passing.

Space Attack - Garf, what goes on?
Planetary Assault - Keith, new demo by the weekend, you said?
Gates Of Doom - Andy, very nice. All of you check it out!
Dungeon Of Ultimate Terror - Adam, something! Anything!
Bubba's Bubbles - Pete, what's the word?
Intro and other Anims - Keith, how goes it?
Music - EJ, how many tunes left to go?

I've begun writing the manual. It keeps the tone of the intro and such and
should be a good read, as well as a good manual. I'll need a screen shot from
each level. 

To do that, run your level (uncompiled). When you get to a screen that shows
your level off well, hit CTRL-C. Then go to direct mode and type Save Iff
'screenshot.iff' and hit return (add a path to wherever you want it). Then
attach that picture to email and send it to me. It will go into the manual and
on the CBATNAM public access website. The screenshots will also goto Amiga
Report, along with a press release about the game and to Amiga Format.

Remember, Mush will be selling the game from his website. We may also be able
to make CD copies of the game to be sold through mail order. The manual will
be printed with a DTP program and the whole thing will look quite professional
when we are done. Keep working, guys.

TFX is a NTSC game, and if you press the Help key it will flip to NTSC, but
you can't do this until you are flying, so all the initial set up is in PAL,
and this is most annoying, and unnecessary.
                                                Happy birthday Mushy.

   Yes, seems to go faster every year...


> Space Attack - Garf, what goes on?

   You really want to know?! Okay...

    First, I wasted a couple days at the AF-forum where I discovered
    unintelligent life...

    Next, I "completed" my image-remapping module for a soon to be
    released commercial BLITZ-project. Very happy to have this "done"!!

    Then, I set aside some time to create a small demo on my IBMclone.

    Finally, I have updated my webpages with the addition of the IBM
    Clone page.

    Speaking of IBMclones, somebody posted a message inquiring
    about an AMOS for the PC (hmmm... Personal Computer, well that's
    your Amiga as well, so you already have it!! Haha)...

    If you are looking for a true conversion of AMOS then I can't help you,
    but I will highly recommend DJGPP and Allegro.

    DJGPP is a c/c++ compiler and Allegro is an audio/video library.
    Together they make IBMclone software-development very easy.
    As easy as AMOS on the Amiga, in my opinion.

    I haven't seen any decent support-tools yet, but you can be assured
    once I complete my part of the list-game, I will be focusing on the
    creation of some fine development-tools for the DJGPP/Allegro
    developer.  A port of the AIG is high on the list...


    You can download my first DJGPP/Allegro demo from my IBMclone 
    page as well as read about my experiences in IBMclone land...


    Okay, Giark as far as the SideShooter, I haven't worked on it since
    I submitted the last demo (SideShot6.lha), but I will get back to it
    either tomorrow or Thursday. Try to have a new demo to you this
    coming weekend.


> Keep working, guys.

   Will do!!  And you keep working on the marketing aspects.  I think
   this is another area where you apparently excel...


      Take  care,

Hi,

 Some of you might have noticed that I was missing for the last few
weeks. This was because of my telephone line been down, so I
couldn't use the net 8O(

 This happened just before I got to send out a new pang demo
and a beta of TGE I will send out demos & more mails very soon as
I have around 3000 mails to read first.

cya,

The Allegro development library has recently been mentioned here and talk
of an Amiga port (if I understood the post correctly).  I'm not trying to
dissuade anyone from porting this nor am I trying to convert AMOS users
but I find that SAS C (it can be bought VERY cheaply now,$10 I think) and
the Games Master system (GMS) make a great setup.  I encourage you to take
a look at it.  Paul Manias has it on Aminet under dev/misc I think.  If
I'm not mistaken, AMOS users could also use the GMS (although not
as easily I suspect).  Anyway I would highly recommend this to anyone
doing game development.

Yes. They are standard (but a bit old) RAM chips.

You don't have to talk to an amiga dealer. Any electronic supply store will be
able to get them for you. Just take in the manual and show them the chip
specs.

Wait 50 is one second in PAL timing. Wait 60 is one second in NTSC timing.

PAL - 50 jiffies/sec
NTSC - 60 jiffies/sec

Go to

Matt, I registered last month, and I sent the amount quoted in the demo.
It worked for me... I now have my registered version, so I guess the
answer is yes.


See ya...

Hello to everyone,
	I'm Mike and I just joined the AMOS mailing list today.  I was 
wondering if you could help me out with some stuff.  First of all, 
does anyone know if the author of PowerBobs and Turbo Plus still 
exists?  Mr. Andrae (I think) in Belgium.  (By the way: I can't 
spell)  I sent him 500 Francs (the requested amount) this past July 
to the address printed in a demo of PowerBobs and asked that he would 
kindly send me the latest version of both PowerBobs and Turbo Plus.  
He has not responded.  I'm a little frusterated at my loss of 500 
francs,  I hope this is not how all shareware transactions are 
handled.  Does anyone know anything about where to obtain the latest 
versions of these extensions?
	I'm also looking for a short list of the syntax and usage of the 
commands available in Turbo Plus.  I have a demo of it, but haven't 
been able to figure out how to create scrolling tile maps.  I can't 
figure out some of the commands.
	Finally, I've been stuck on a problem with collision detection for 
almost 3 months now and it's really annoying me.  I need to be able 
to quickly test 10 bobs against eachother and then choose a logical 
route around one another if any have collided.  I can do it with 2 
bobs, but the collision detection is too slow for more, and the code 
becomes too cryptic.  Any help?

Thanks,
Mike

Use the filter functions in the configuration, selecting the TO: as the
recognizer, and simply select the MOVE option to place it in a seperate
folder.

Hold on there guys! I'm sure there was an Amos Ext named the Dump Ext.
I'll  check  out my back issues of Amoszine to confirm this and let ya
know.  I'm  sure  Malcom Lavvery used it for his excellent Magic Paint
Box program also.

Yup,  I have it here. Not tried it, but I do have it. I'll send a copy
to  MUSH (and one to yourself). If anyone else wants it, just email me
direct. Or get it from MUSH ;)

   HEY!! This is an AMOS-list and these kind of messages have no place
   here!! :) 

   I'm not trying to convert people either, besides what some members
   might think...
   
   Anyway, I wrote the Allegro-post in reply to the last AMOS for PC
   inquiry. As I'd seen several of these messages in my time on this
   list, I thought, now that since I finally have some actual modern-day
   experience in IBMclone-land, I would present my views on the subject.

   No,  Allegro isn't being ported to Amiga, but if a person is looking for
   an easy development-system for IBMclone development then I highly 
   recommend DJGPP and Allegro.

   I downloaded an early version of the GMS last year and it looked very
   promising. With GMS for the Amiga and Allegro for the IBMclones, this
   would be the ideal set-up for commercial development.

   Don't be taking these posts the wrong way. We aren't attacking 
   AMOS, it's a fine language. However, I know that I would find it very
   interesting to see my new "friends" (the people on this list) developing
   in other languages as well as AMOS. There are some damn fine
   programmers on this list and you could apply that talent and
   determination to other languages IN ADDITION to AMOS. I can't
   understand why you feel it has to be one or the other?!

   Perhaps, our next project could be in C/GMS or (I'm really out on a
   limb now) even C/Allegro with Giark still leading the troops...


   Okay, I'm bracing for impact... and yes Giark I will be resuming work
   on the SideShooter stage tomorrow, providing I'm not kicked out after
   this message comes through.


      Take  care,   
      GARFIELD

There was a 'bug' in the form (well not the form itself but the text above)
where  it  said  AMCAF  would sell at USD 25,-. This is wrong. AMCAF can be
bought for USD 20,- (cash)  or  USD  24,-  (cheque).  The  other  applyable
currencies & prices can be found in the docs/reg form.

All you have to do is:

Chose /Configuration/ from YAM's /Settings/ menu.
Go to the /Folder/ page, and make a new folder.

Save the config, and you have a folder for the Amos ML.

If you want to have Yam to filter the mail from the list to the new folder,
then open the config again, but go the /Filter/ page, and make a new
filter, chose a name for it, it dosen't matter what name you chose for it,
in the /Match/ box, you write the address for the ML, in /Field/ select
/From/, and in /Action/ select /Move to/ and select the folder you want Yam
to move the mail from the ML to.

BTW: Please check your time.


Henrik

Yup.  I  registered a couple of weeks back (30DM) and am now the proud
user  of  this  great extension. It is by far one of (/if not the/) best
Amos ext ever written.

Contact Chris direct for more details....

My continued leadership would hinge on the successful completion of CBATNAM.
And I'd rather continue as IAPA, rather than learning a new language. Perhaps
on an allegro or C list...

You read this Adam! I know you have a 3d bubba, used to render the first Bubba

That would be me. It's part of the menu system. But I can't do much on that
until I GET THE CODE! That puts the onus squarely on the shoulders of the six
people writing the five game modules.

The early boot menu is okay, but some programs will still kick out, even if
you use it. (Insight Dinosaurs for one)

It's the second poke, telling the system to use 60 jiffies for ntsc that is
missing.

^Ok, but it's an Amos 1.3 extension, and don't run on Pro, anyway I think it
might be what I'm looking for, course in the docs it says that the source
is included, does anyone have that, if they do I'll try and include a pro
version of the commands in my own extension..
Thanx in advance..

   Fair enough... IAPA it is!!
   An allegro or C list, are you kidding?!  My whole point was so the
   "gang" (IAPA... IBPA, ICPA, etc) could join forces again. I respect
   the skills of all the CBATNAM-developers (and the AMOS-list
   members who are working on their own projects as well) or I wouldn't
   have mentioned it.  Of course, it's hard to judge Adam's stage...
   just kidding Adam, I'm sure it will be well impressive when it arrives!!


> Remember, all, that we want the game ready for December.

   Ah, a solid deadline.  Right, I have completed my CBATNAM work-list
   for the next demo and starting tomorrow (Fri.), I will devote the next
   five days to the SideShooter, or until I have completed the work-list,
   depending on which comes first...

   Anyway, you will have a new demo no later than Wednesday...

Hi all!
Anyone got anyideas on this one:

I want to use a three character string eg "ADC" or something.
Now suppose I want to change one character to "E" by removing the
lowest in this case "A". Is there a way of doing this quickly (ie in
one line) , no matter where the lowest is?

Or I could do it that I keep adding letters to the string and then I
need a fast (very) way of picking out the highest 3 letters. Any
ideas???

Ah. Well, we would need a project that we could all enjoy again. I think there
were some ideas floating around, but that will be decided AFTER Bubba takes

Ok, what does FOR December mean ?  As in BEfore december, or during december, or
by a particular date in december ??

I intend to have a new demo(damn near finsished) version out damn soon, then a code
release either at the same time, or shortly afterwards, then the release of more
game levels as soon as I can get the graphics for them.

--------------------------------------

You need to use Asc() to get the ASCII values of each character, and
compare them.

Try something like this:
(this routine should work for any length of string)

    For COUNT=1 to Len(THE_STRING)-1
        If Asc(Mid$(THE_STRING,COUNT,1))>HIGHEST Then HIGHEST=COUNT
    Next

In some other languages, it's much easier than this. Amos may have it's
good points, but it can't do everything the easiest way  :-}

That's all for now....

Fair enuf.  Announcing code one:
	invunerable

When this variable is negative (preferably a quite large negative), the game runs
quicker and bubba is extreeeeemly unlikely to get killed.   To be used in the 
safe for several seconds after being killed routine.  I'm gonna add some to it
when you get killed though..

hehe, Yes, speaking of which, this is what that mailing is about. As 
I may have said before in previous mailings, I have been sweating 
away trying to get this thing out, but one thing after another keeps 
happening (this being my first time doing a full-fledged raycaster 
from SCRATCH). I did enlist the help of John Bintz ("3D master", 
hehe), and he offered alot of help, which was mostly suggestions, but 
he's been quite busy so he hasn't had a lot of time to help lately. 

Fortunately Giark comes to the rescue by offering me a very basic 
raycaster he found from an (unknown to me) diskmag, which includes 
freely modifiable source. This is good, and I've been reading the 
docs and stripping it down to bare-bones figuring it out (hehe, which 
isn't hard, what's to figure?).

Anyhow, I've had to rename most of the variables, sort and reorganize 
(as well as add to) these 100 lines of mostly uncommented spaghetti 
logic. The newly refurbished code is almost ready (and this will, for 
source purposes Giark, be released as a special edition of the Cafe 
engine, hehe), and I should have a demo here in a couple of days.

I will of course notify the List minutes before I send the demo to 
Giark, so as to let everyone know (namely those that dosn't visit
the CBATNAM page very often).

Yes, I read. I haven't checked my mail in about 2 days, and I've been 
reading through everything. I'll send the model as soon as I can.
 
Unfortunately, the model itself is in a semi-specific format 
(weirdo format saved out by the modeler I'm using), and it doesn't 
export 3D Studio (3DS) files! Argh. Anyhow, this can be remidied. It 
DOES export .DXF files (which Lightwave can read), which is good. 

What I'll do is export the model as DXF, bring it into Lightwave, 
touch it up, and then export it from there as 3DS. And from there of 
course, I'll send it to Giark (NOT the List. I don't want everyone on 
the List that doesn't have access to the CBATNAM page to be able to 
get the model and mess with it). Giark can notify everyone from there 
that he has it and it'll be up on the page for whoever wants it.

Btw Kieth, sorry for not getting it (or any other pictures) to you 
sooner! I've been busy with my level and had forgotten since.

   #%*&$@#!!!

   Haha... if it isn't one thing, it's something else!!!!!!

   I was "chopping away" at my SIDESHOT7 demo work-list, had just
   completed all the "fine-tuning" and added the collision-detection
   between Bubba and the MidBoss, saved the file and the HardDrive
   light just keeps going and going and going...

  Finally, it stops with a requestor "Unable to Validate drive DH0, 
  error in Header on block xxx" or some such babble.  Hmmm... I don't
  recall ever saying I wanted it validated!!! 

  Anyway, the result is I can load from my harddrive and I do have the
  latest version on there, but I can't write anything to it.


  So, I'm heading off to Aminet to see if I can find that fix-disk utility
  I thought I already had... :)


  Anyway Giark, this will only be a bit of  a delay.  Once I can "fix"
  the harddrive, all should be fine.  If I have to, I'll copy all the files
  onto floppies and finish the demo.

  At least I have my IBMclone (working fine as always), so Internet
  acess is no problem...


  Take care,
  GARFIELD

  Current Projects:
  "Fixing" the harddrive: 00% complete

Just wait some more time before loosing your hopes. Anyway, did you send
money in a normal envelope? This isn't very safe: I'd prefer big envelope you
cannot look through.

Usually they are not: shareware works very well and problems like that aren't
common. But it's always better to be sure about addresses and names, sending
a letter before any money.

EJ, question.  With a CD release of Cap'n Bubba very likely, can you convert
your sounds so they can be output as CDDA ??  A CD soundtrack would be dead
cool.

To the one known as Mr.,

Some more variables of interest that probably everyone else is using too:
	men		Number of lives.
	score		Something to do with the number of things killed.

Maybe if we set 'men' to a negative number, Bubba may have infinite lives.
Mine will support this in about 5 minutes.  Currently, my level gives
Bubba 5 lives.  If you give him -5, it'll display it the same, but 
he'll never run out..

Oh, as for a release saturday, I'm damn near to finishing it now, I CAN
release a demo saturday if required, but I'd like to wait a couple more
days.

Have the 'enter codes' editor finished, well, except for setting
unreleased variables, and I can then think about releasing my code...

New codes supported by my level:

			it behaves normally.
	invunerable	When negative, preferably a large negative, it makes
			Bubba immune to being hit.

To the one known as Mr.,

Ok, here are some more variables for you:
	bubba_sp	default=%1010
	bubba_fx	default=%101
for Bubba speech, and Bubba Sound Effects.  Set them to zero for silent mode
for people who hate things like speech and sound effects.  YOU need to set the
defaults, Mr Giark.

....just to keep you busy....   ;-)

I wanna see the enter codes section on the menu !!

   I located the excellent DiskSalvage and downloaded it yet again 
   (apparently, the archive I had previously downloaded was stored on 
   harddrive in one of the sectors that "failed"... what are the odds?!)...

   It's been processing for almost two hours now, repairing as it goes.
   With a little luck my drive should soon be restored.

   The great thing about using DiskSalvage is that it generally restores
   your drives almost to the level they performed at when you first
   purchased them, so Giark, all appears to be well...
 

      Take  care,

Subject: Dump Ext Again!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hiya all,

Someone  emailed  me and said the Dump Ext which I sent to Mush (and a
few others) does not work with Amos Pro!!!

Can  I just say that I added it to slot 10 in my Amos Pro and it works
fine ;)

Although  I  will  remove it coz it's using my JD Ext slot and I think
I'll use JD more than Dump :)

Can  anyone else confirm that the Dump Ext DOES in fact work with Amos
Pro.

BTW Sorry, but I deleted the mail before I replied to the guy who said
it didn't work :(

Oh well, that's what this list is for I guess....

cya, Andy Gibson.

Well I have MIDI equipment here, a couple of friends could do some
guitar stuff if necessary, so I think it is possible. What do you need
to do to 'burn' the music on a cd?

Hi!

 Does anyone know of any hacks on 'How to Connect a PC High Density floppy to a A1200' ?
I have looked at some of the ones on aminet but most of them
need one specific type of drive.

Also There will be a new pang out soon *and* a beta
of TGE (for beta testers ONLY)

cya,

Yeah, that would really make some good quality. NOT! OctaMED can save a mod as
digital audio anyway.

Subject: More dumps !!!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hello..

Well, I was the one who said that the dump extension don't work on pro,
ahmm, well it does. I'd only read the docs when I wrote that one, but
the instructions work on pro 2.0, however it's clearly not an extension
intended to run on Pro, course the extension-information can't be shown,
exension slot 10 appears to be empty when it's installed, so other parts
may be unstable to..

Anyway, I'd still like if anyone has the source-code for that extension,
it's noted that the code is PD, please send it to me, so I can change it
into a real pro-extension, besides I find it anoying that it takes slot
10, course that's where my LDos should be...

Just a problem, I can't get 'noformfeed' to work with the dump, no matter
what I do the printer does a FF after the graphics has been send, I'd
like to send graphics with a height of more than 1024, or has anyone a
better way to do that (it's just 2 col...)

X-Status: 

Hello, everybody..

Hope you don't get to hate me for keep hacking on that 'printer dump',
BUT, now I've found the error in the original Pro library, the problem
is a simple error in the stack-handling, and it crashes the computer
when leaving the command code..

Anyway, just one problem to go, I only have the source-code for IOPorts
v1.0, so I'm hunting a newer version, I'd prefer the source for 2.0
but if anyone has it for something in between, please let me know....

I've been planing to disassamble the lib, but after looking a bit on the
extension I once wrote, I gave up that part.....

Anyway, if there's someone out there who'd like to see a 100 % working
printer dump with the standard IOPorts, then take a look in your AmosPro
in 'tutorial/extensions' drawer and find the version number on the 
'|io_Ports.s' file (it's a text file)....

I guess, but I'd prefer a quality CD soundtrack, err, higher than the amiga one
perhaps.

You'll need a high density disk drive to do it, then use cross-dos to
read the disc, that work for me..

Wouldn't that give a big loss of quality with the extra noise you get?
On the PC you have software to put .WAV files directly to the CD as
digital audio, I was wondering if something like that existed for the
Amiga.

Hello, this is proberly the last dump note from me..

-------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:  ****!!!**** NEW IOPorts Included with mail ****!!!****
-------------------------------------------------------------

Why is it so easy to find the solves, 5 min. after one has asked for help ?

Ack, Yesterday I asked for a new source-code for the IOPorts extension, to
try and fix the bug in 'printer dump'. Well this morning a friend of mine
gave me a new de-asm program, that was capable of getting something usefull
back from an amos-extension-lib-file. So I tried it, it worked and now I've
fixed that bug that has annoyed me for the last 2 years, great feeling...

--

The related problem with the dump extension sending FF after the graphics,
is due to the way it works, it opens the device, sends data, closes the 
device. Well when closing the device some drivers sends FF to the printer,
the IOPorts don't do that, becouse YOU control the open/close of the device
very nice feature...

So if you'd like to send 2 pictures to the same page, then use:

Open Printer
Printer Dump
Printer Dump
Close Printer

Cool ey ??

--

I know I'm proberly breaking some rules on the list, but I'm including the
fixed IOPorts extension in this mail (3680 bytes), as I think quite a few
AMOS-users is going to like this..

Well that answers my previous question :) Although I'd rather convert
the music to 'real' instruments (ie. some MIDI equipment) rather than
putting the same music as the normal game on CD. What would be the
difference between playing a module from a player or playing a module
streamed to CD? Then again, my plans always get trashed horribly :)

Well, I've been thinking the last 5 seconds since I wrote the previous
message, if I do the music on a MIDI keyboard I'd still have to tape it
all. Doh! So that would still mean loss of quality, except if I could
record the music directly onto HD, and then stream it onto a CD. Er, can
I? I haven't really done this stuff before.

Anyway, the biggest problem is time. I am working hard on the music
(honestly I am) in THX/MOD format, and with a December release date it
would be very hard for me to do the extra CD tracks, unless someone else
volunteered to do that stuff. Well, the bottom line is, CD music would
be nice, but it isn't essential.

                             Introduction

This is a new AMOSPro extension called "DOOM Music Extension" which
provides about 180 new commands & functions to AMOSPro and Compiler. The
extension  commands provide the possibility for tool and demo programmers
(for game  coders too) to use different sound-formats in their productions.
We hope  that you can use this extension often. This music extension
supports  following formats:

         Internal-Player             External-Player
         ---------------             ---------------
        * Protracker                 * TFMX Pro & V1.5
        * THX Soundsystem V2.0       * Med
        * The Player 6.1A            * Octamed

(Octamix)
                                     * PlaySid¹
                                     * FutureComposer V1.0 - 1.3

No info right yet. I'd like to know as well, as my 1200 is being shipped now.
Also, anyone know how to install a pal/ntsc switch on a 1200? I know you can
use the preboot menu, but I want an actual hard switch.

The Range Extension (or Shuffle how it's sometimes called)  is  the  former
AMOS  Club Extension developed by Aaron Fothergill. The Range Extension was
included in the well-known TOME Extension kit for AMOS Creator.

Aaron stopped developing stuff  for  AMOS  after  he  had  a  quarrel  with
François  Lionet  on  some  AMOS Pro issues. There's no official version of
TOME nor Range for AMOS Pro from Aaron.

> Just wondered, what is it, and where can I get it ???

Well, it contains some neat little commands for various  topics,  and  it's
documentation  was  only  available to the members of that former AMOS Club
UK.

For anyone owning the original TOME for AMOS Creator, I've done  an  update
of TOME and Range for AMOS Pro, which can be found on my homepage. For TOME
was commercial, this update is only available  for  those  out  there,  who
BOUGHT an original copy of TOME at that time...

I've mentioned a bug on this list before which could be the cause for  this
'Illegal function call' message.

François thought he would be a genius to  optimize  certain  multiplication
and  division  commands.  The  AMOS  Pro  Compiler  uses bit shifting where
possible. But bit shifting is not 100% equivalent to certain divisions.

Examples:

Operation       Correct result  AMOS Editor     AMOS Pro Compiler
 7 / 10         0               0               0
 7 / 16         0               0               0
-7 / 10         0               0               0
-7 / 16         0               0              -1

The error is caused by shifting the value of -7 to the right, so  the  sign
bit  will always result in values below 0 when dividing negative numbers by
powers of 2.

So if you ever wondered, why your program doesn't work when compiled,  look
at this little program:

Dim TEST(10)
Print TEST(-1/8)

This will work in the editor (-1/8=0) but not compiled (-1/8=-1).

I have the facilities to do this as well.  Streaming amiga audio directly onto
HD is the easiest, I'd have to have words with my sound guy about midi hardware
though.

What's the difference ??
=09One:	It looks a lot better, makes people think their money is well
=09	spent, is more professional, takes up space on the CD.
=09Two:	Under no circumstances whatsoever can the music interfere

   Okay, I do trust you.  However, in my case I am very happy to report
   that DiskSalvage repaired and validated my drive without trashing any
   of the files in the process. Took a little over two hours for a 420MB
   drive, so I guess that illustrates what kind of shape it was in....:)


   Giark, I resumed work on the SideShooter tonight: the fine-tuning is
   complete, keyboard-control is now supported and PhaseThree:
   The Asteroid Field is well underway.... those rocks (a gift from
   Andy Hawkins of GoD fame) look quite nice too, considering they
   have been remapped to just four colors....


      Take  care,

Does anyone know where I can register the Turbo Plus extension?  The 
last address and phone number I have is from a place called 
"Playfield" in Florida.  When I tried to call the number I got some 
old lady's house.  The BBS number was disconnected (suprise suprise) 
and I didn't dare send any money to the address.  Any help?
	I am also looking for the syntax of the Turbo Plus commands.  The 
demo I have only lists the commands but gives no usage information.  
I have been able to figure out how many arguments each command takes 
and in some cases what each argument does.  But I still can't figure 
out some commands.  I especially need to know how to set up a 
scrolling scene with Turbo. If anyone has the heart to let me in on 
this info I would be greatful.
	Is Turbo still being developed by anyone?

Thanks,
	Mike

Probably, or MPeg to digital audio. I just pointed out that we can get the
original mods to cd fairly simply. I didn't expect any interest, let alone
getting jumped on by every other user. Q8-{)

Remember, we need a finished GAME first.

Simple. Then, CD game owners could pop the CD into any cd player and say
"listen to the cool tunes from this neat amiga game, you ibm weenie!" They
would be real cd-audio tracks, playable without the game.

Don't worry about this. It's all just cloudtalk until the GAME is finished.

I'd rather see the game tracks done first. Don't worry about anything else

 Hello,

I'm making a program in which I want to turn off multitasking. I've tried
the 'Multi No' command from the Turbo Plus Extension. I've also tried using
'NUL=Execall(-132)' to turn it off.
Well, both of these commands works great, the only problem I'm having is
that the mouse moves really REALLY slow when I use em.

I've tried to put the mouse in mouse port #2 and read the coords using the
AMCAF commands 'X=X Smouse' and 'Y=Y Smouse' which works just fine when
multitasking is off. But I'd really like to be able to use mouse port #1
instead, so is there any way to do this? Would it be possible to make such
commands in AMCAF Chris?

I've also tried to read directly using 'X=Peek($DFF00A)' but then I would
need some sort of resident program which can check this continuously...
Anyone now how to do this (Asm?).
Is there any other adresses for checking mouse movements except the $DFF00A
and $DFF00B?
Any ideas?

HI!!
I received the following. But, the rest got scrambled on the way over.
I'd still like to help with the game.  Try sending your info again.
Thanks, Ken


I am starting development of Final Existence, my Chrono-Trigger style
Role Playing Game for the Amiga.  I have attached the story outline,
character information, and development information.  I also need people
to help.  I asked a while back, but didn't have enough of the story
finished then.
Now I do (I believe Ken Axsom asked...) and I need your help.  Reply
back to uv334@freenet.victoria.bc.ca with any requests or offers for
help.  Thanks!

Subject: Permanent GUI Bank
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hello,

I've been leaning the GUI extension (it's great, Pietro), and I've come
to the point where I want to save a GUI bank as a permanent data bank
along with the program so I don't have to load a separate .abk file at
runtime.

I've tried everything I can think of, including loading the .abk,
reserving as data another bank with the length taken from the GUI bank,
and copying the contents from the GUI bank into the new data bank.  I
then ran a test to assure that both banks were the same, byte for byte. 
It didn't work.  When attempting to Gui Open then new bank (which is
byte-for-byte identical to the GUI bank I loaded from disk, the program
says "Not a GUI bank at line such and such."

Can anyone help me?  The AMOS manual and online help files both are
fairly lacking in detail as to the exact procedure for creating a
permanent bank.  Unless it really is that simple to do, and something is
going wrong with the newly created bank.

Help!

Sincerely,

John F. Rodgers

   Don't know what you need this for, but any program that would be
   killing the OS, would likely be running in a tight-loop (a game or 
   demo), so you should be able to check the mouse deltas each
   loop and presto, you have OSless-mouse control.

   I implemented this in my last SideShooter demo.  I could send
   the OSlessMouse demo (which, of course, includes the
   DirectMouseReading procedure), but I'm simply reading the
   registers each frame and you already know how to do that...

   I haven't tried it, but perhaps you can install a VBL-interrupt in
   AMOS even after the OS is kicked out, if so you could then use
   an Every 1 Proc _DirectMouseRead or something similiar... 
   Hardware-wise it should be no problem, the question is whether
   AMOS supports it or not.

  
      Take  care,

                             Introduction

This is a new AMOSPro extension called "DOOM Music Extension" which
provides about 180 new commands & functions to AMOSPro and Compiler. The
extension  commands provide the possibility for tool and demo programmers
(for game  coders too) to use different sound-formats in their productions.

I've been having some trouble programming both sound fx and music 
through AMOS.  I've left one channel open on each of the in game mods 
and instructed AMOS to play to samples through the open channel.  It 
does, but then it repeats the sample.  And repeats it again...and 
again...incessently.  It's really annoying and I don't know ow to 
stop this.  Has anyone else ever had this problem?  Any help would be 
great.

Maybe I should explain why I want to kill the OS :)
Actually, I don't need to kill the OS, the only thing I want is for the
bob's to move smooth and not jerk like they do now. I found out that when I
used the 'Multi No' command the movements were perfect! So, I figured the
only thing I need to do now is to make the mouse move like it's supposted
to. But, hey... If there's any other way of getting smooth movements I'll be
VERY happy!! :)

I've tried everything from update off, bob update, update every and so
on...... Still jerky.
I talked to a friend today who told me that AMAL (which I'm using for the
movements) use interupts, and that's what's causing the jerks. He also told
me that the AMAL program needs a higher priority and that there was a way to
do that. Anyone know how? (He said he read it in a magazine a long time ago,
but couldn't remember what it said).

Sure  does.  Simply use OctaMed Sound Studio and record the mod to HD.
This is simply a big sample which can be played back from HD.

Sorry  I  can't remember the actual function name for this, but anyone
using OMedSS should find the function with ease.

In fact, the audio tracks on previous AF (or was it CU) CD's were done
this way, so it is an option :^)

I'm  not  much involved in burning CD's, but I bet it's easy enough to
save the file onto CD too ;)

You won't find any skills on this list though ;þ

Seriously, see...another V2.00 update. So why is it some peeps managed
to  get  a  V2.01 then when most of us only have V2.00 on our Compiler
Updater disk????

(BTW If you do need any help with programming, MUSH has loads of stuff
and God, oops, Giark has a few tips files on his web site etc)

Phew!  As  long  as it worked I guess everything went fine? But do not
just take it for granted that Disksalv or even QBack Tools won't trash
your HD.

Now  this  sounds  like  a stage of the game I'd love to play. I don't
know  much  about  the  sideshooter level, but I bet it's running at a
good pace and is worth waiting for :)

When the game is available from MUSH, I will be one of those who is on
the order list, even if it's just to play this level.

The  Asteroid  Field  is  enough  to make me wanna rush out and buy it
today. See, I love the section on Deluxe Galaga and I hope you section
is similar?

Anyway, I'm away for a blat of Galaga now....

PS, has anyone ever written a good clone of Scramble???

   You must be compiling with the Pro Compiler...  The reason I don't
   like the ProCompiler is due to these glitches or "pops".
   If you are at a low frame-rate like 25/30fps or below then you won't
   see them (at least not nearly as much), but if you are achieving the
   max frame-rate of 50/60fps, the ProCompiler gives you these glitches.

   It looks so amateurish, and in my opinion only serves as one more
   reason people think AMOS is used only by "lil' kids" and simply is
   not to be taken seriously.  So, I'd rather sacrifice a few % speed
   (which you can make up for anyway) and have Smoooth bobs using
   the Amos Compiler v1.36...

[regarding the DirectMouseReading demo...]
> Please, do send it!
 
   I'll put it on my AMOS-page, that way anyone who is interested can
   grab it...


      Take  care,

   Hello.

   I just played a few rounds of DeluxeGalaga(AGA version)... 

   Okay,  maybe there's a couple different types of Asteroid-rounds??

   I only played the game until I made it to the first Asteroid-section.
   It consisted of some large slabs of rock drifting down the screen
   which you had to dodge while also trying to grab the bonuses which
   occasionally appeared...

   It seems I was wrong, my simple AsteroidPhase will certainly NOT
   be destroyed by his (if this is the one you were referring to)...

   My asteroid-field contains five different sized asteroids all with full
   rotation with movement and rotation speed based on size.
   Also, you can still fire your weapons and blast the heck out of the
   asteroids which looks quite nice...

   It still needs to be fine-tuned, but at least the current Phase is
   playable. 


   BTW - I sent the SideShooterDemo7 archive to Giark earlier today,
   so it should be on the CBATNAM webpage soon...


      Take  care,   
      GARFIELD

hehe, ye, BIG surprise. Playfield still exists, but I don't think at 
the same address (on neither the Web or geographcially), and I don't 
think that the old phone numbers work.

The guy from Playfield who was into AMOS and helped with Turbo Plus 
was Ryan Scott, who has actually turned Playfield from a successful 
AMOS mag (which I don't think exists any longer) into a couple of Web 
pages on his Web site. He now runs a Web designing and consulting 
business with a couple of other people. Do a Yahoo! search on him, 
and you're sure to find something (I can always get the URL to you).

Well, I own the latest version of Turbo (2.0), as I managed to secure 
a copy of it with photo-copies of the manual from a faithful List 
supplier (Chris Evans, who's no longer on the List). I could scan the 
pages (I WONT type them up) and send them to you via email, but most 
assuredly majority of them wont work since you have the demo version.

I could also send you copies of the disks (snail mail or e-mail 
.DMS), but I may have to charge you a small bit for them (if sent 
snail mail) to cover shipping, etc. (And any type of legal stuff.)

I'm not sure. To my knowledge, not at the moment.

Kill the Music Extension and use AMCAF (Protracker and Samples). Or  reinit
the  music  extension on every start (using AMCAF). Or don't use samples at
all. You've got the choice.

I thought this was done automatically.  That is, if you don't erase a
bank it will be saved with the source.

I only learnt this after Amos repeatedly ran out of memory after two or
three runs/saves of a game I'm working on which has a very large bob
bank.  The .AMOS code file just grew and grew!

Is IS that simple to create a permanent bank, well my best shot is that
either the GUI-extension checks to see if it's a permanent bank, if that's
the problem there's absolutely nothing to do...

Number two is more likely, The GUI-extension checks for the NAME of the
bank, if so then you have to copy the name from the old bank to the new one
(the name is in Start(bnk)-8 and is 8 bytes long)...

An easier way is to change the original bank to a permanent one, this can
either be done with the AMCAF extension, or you can do this:
Doke Start(bnk)-12,1 (For FAST-DATA bank)
or
Doke Start(bnk)-12,3 (For CHIP-DATA)
or
Bset 0,Start(bnk)-11 (Makes a work bank permanent)

Just a note:
Bclr 0,Start(bnk)-11 (Will make a permanent bank -> work bank)

Hope it helps...

Problem see before, bug in AMOS Pro 'Sam Loop' Command.

Solve:
Use an extension to play samples:
AMCAF sample commands works nicely..
SLN sample commands also works great (Extension only has danish docs, sorry)

This is my best and only shot at this, I'm allways using SLN to play my
samples as the original music is Crappy shit (EME might have fixed that)..

Well, we need invulnerable, infinite ammo, infinite shields, so far. Any ones
you want to put in after that, just let me know what the flags are called so I
can add codes to the menu to activate the cheats.

I'll take anything you give me.  I naturally prefer E-mail stuff,

all up to you.  BTW, does 2.0 come with a map editor?

I need to keep in touch with my Amiga, to make sure the FTP site is working
correctly. If it isnt, then I just send a command, which will reset my
system and dial in on another line. Its so all you people can carry on
using it while im away, hehe.

I was supposed to meet up with a few people, lee atkins and a couple of
other AMOS guys, but I never heard a peep out of them. Was all gonna spend
the day in the Arndale, and do some serious shoppin' and stuff. Anyone up
to it?

Well, im going over mainly to see the family, and also im gonna go see Phil
Wilkinson to just tap off my F1 software contract. Plus, I miss the boring

      Ah yes, sorry about that, I wasn't paying attention was I? :)

      I have updated my address-book, replacing your old e-mail address
      with your new one...


   ----------<NEW SUBJECT BEGINS HERE>----------

   Out of curiosity, has anyone on this list released a shareware Amiga
   GAME this year (Jan01toNov12)?

   If so, what is the name of the game??  How is it doing (as in sales)???

   I know an "average" commercial Amiga game sells between 500 and
   10,000 copies depending on the time of year it's released, the mag
   reviews and other factors (like quality and the "wow"-factor).

   What I'm trying to determine is if a shareware Amiga Game market
   exists, and if so how big is it????  

   So, if anyone has earned more than $500 (about 335 pounds) from
   Amiga shareware-game sales this past year, PLEASE let me
   know.

   Also, please do NOT respond regarding sales from shareware games
   before late 1996 as this does not help in determining the current
   market.
   


      Take  care,   
      GARFIELD

The GUI Extension checks the bank name... you must copy from Start(x)-8.

Phase warping...  Why didn't I think about that ?

Ok, well, since phase warping is wanted, phase warping you shall have.  Invoke
the variable H_WAVE, with the wave number you want, and the level shall skip
to the predeclared wave number.  For 'cheat' purposes, level numbering starts at
zero.  Oh yeah, make sure this one is positive...

Hello:

I havea Question that is partly non Amos.

As some of you might now, the diskmag i have coded is finally out.
But in next issue we will have a chart, but it's hard to get peoples to
fill out the votesheet.
But here the other day i got a wotesheet from Showtime that Darkage had
sent out to many peoples at once.

So i'am wodering how they do that, and is there some sort of program that
lets me have a Ascii file with hundreds of E-mails addy's and then send
the same mail out to all the E-Mail addy's on that text file???

I, am not to happy with the idea of writing abouth 800-1000 E-mail addy's
manually into my Mailprogram.

Or is there someone that will take the job and code such a program, if
it dont exsists??
I think there are more than me who would like such a program.

Morten Bolstad.

On the PC CD-Audio Tracks seem simple enough to do.  I don't have a
cluehow to do it on the Amiga as I have never tried, but I am interested.
Now I know there are two possibilities for burning a CD.
	Either Data first and Audio Tracks second or vice versa.  If you
go with Data first then you cannot play the CD in a standard CD player.
Games lake Quake put the Audio tracks first so people could play the Audio
in a standard CD Player.  They even had professional well known groups do
the music, so I doubt that you could impress a PC user.

It would be more professional to lay down seperate Audio tracks that way
you have full control of voices for Special effects.  But it also means
that the hardware is capable of mixing CD and Amiga audio, and I am not
sure if all Amiga models are capable of doing so.  But almost all CD
drives have external audio jacks so a sufficient stereo system will allow
mixing of Amiga and Cd inputs.

Good Luck and keep me posted as to your decision and how you implement it.

BTW it is considered good practice to burn sevral test CDs during
development to make sure that your HD speed does not affect the game when
it gets onto a slower CD.

I do not believe this is true. I never had a problem playing cd tracks from a
cd which have data on track 1. Just start from track 2!

Mush has a mailing list manager that does it, but you need amitcp installed. I
have one that uses YAM. You write the mail once and save it into the queue
(for best results, have it the only one in there). Then you make up a standard
ascii file containing a list of email addresses, 1 per line. Then run my
program. It will generate a mail for each address and put it into
yam:outgoing. Then, just update folder in yam and send all.

Let me know if you're interested.

     Greetings,
     
        Using GUI Convert I am trying to convert a .gui file that I created 
     using GADTools but on loading the .gui file I am asked to select an 
     Image file for Window 1.  The only reference I can find in the docs 
     about .img files is for Image Buttons.  I am not trying to create an 
     image button as none of my buttons are without text.  What is going 
     wrong?
     
     
     Declan.

It's my fave part I think?

I've never seen an Amiga version of this classic arcade game :(

I have a number of AMOS source files, with the .amos extension.  That 
appear to be tokenised source.  I can see the variablenames but no commands.

Does anyone have a tool which can batch convert the files into ascii 
source.  I know that the Amos interpreter can do this but its not really 
a batch process.

probably:

1- you've added a GetFile button in the GUI. The GetFile gadget doesn't
exist!!... it's a GadToolsBox extra not supported directly by the GUI
Extension.... the GUI Extension create a ImageButton instead! After you
must pass the image for this gadget...

2- you've created a button gadget without text

No, I hadn't forgotten WHAT you wan't, but yes, recently I have 
forgotten. And whilst on this subject (of the Bubba model, Keith):

I have previously said (namely to Keith via IRC and to the List) that 
I would be able export my Bubba model to Lightwave (as .DXF) and then 
from there save it off as a 3D Studio (.3DS) file. Unfortunately, I 
can't. I thought I could EXPORT those multiple formats, but I mixed 
that up with IMPORTing them, so, no export, no model (the modeler I'm 
using saves it off in its own special format).

If you guys want shots, you'll have to ask me for them (what you 
want, and please tell me what I'm format(s) you prefer, optionally 
image size and colors, and if you want .zip or .lha).

Keith, James, I'll get you guys what you want. Btw, Keith, what 
exactly did you want again? You've asked so many things, I dunno. :)

I've had trouble the other way round on CD-Extra thingies.  Putting the music
first screws up on all machines, except the newest amiga.

That's assuming the tracks are layed out so that an Audio player can
identify them.  If you do disk at once or some unknown to the cd player
format then you get nothing.  It is listed on every help thng about
burning cd's about where to put the audio tracks and data sections.  It
may have changed recently, but I still figure it would be true.
	Since I don't do any burning I could be very wrong, but from all
the reading I did trying to figure out how to design a CD game with or
without audio tracks I ran across a lot of information.  
	My biggest worry is that most amigas do not mix Amiga and CD
audio.  I belive there is an audio input plug on an A4000 motherboard but
I don't think it is possible on any other amiga.  Definately must do some
research into this, but I figure that is far from where I'm in development
as music and sound FX are usually the next to last things added to any
game or program.

Anyone with speceific URLs to check any info please post it.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hello Everyone,

Once again I turn to the amazing AMOS list for help...

I am having a bit of a problem with the Set Font command (Using AMOS Pro
2.00).  It doesn't seem to work after 2,541 loops.  When Set Font number
2,542 is attempted, I get a visit from the Guru.  Sometimes the number
of successful Set Fonts is less, but never more.

I reduced the number of different fonts actually set until I finally
just set the same font over and over (font 1), and still the thing
crashes on attempt number 2,542.

I have tried the Trap Reserve As Data 10,1000000000 trick to flush the
fonts out of memory, but this has no effect, whether I do it every 100
Set Fonts or after *every* Set Font.  The Guru still visits, and he is
never late...

I have tried adding a Get Disc Fonts after every 1024 Set Font commands,
but this also is useless.  2,400 or 2,500 Set Fonts is as far as it will
go before crashing.  I have run out of ideas.

Is this a problem with AMOS - stack, buffers, pointers, garbage
collection routines - or is it an Amiga Dos problem?  I used to have
AmigaE installed, but I don't right now, otherwise I would try it with E
to see if it is just an AMOS problem.

And for the curious among you, I'm not just doing weird things with
AMOS!  I'm working on a titling program which will have to run
unattended 7 days a week, or at least for 24 hours between Gurus and
automatic rebooting.  2,500 Set Font commands just are not enough! 
Eventually, I'll do it in C or E, but for now, AMOS will be quite
sufficient (or at least *should* be sufficient).

Ideas, anyone?

Sincerely,

John F. Rodgers

I missed the start of this message, so I guess your talking about my

It too (now ive got time to update it) also works fine with YAM. Ive also
added a few little extras, including support for YAM files, so all should
be OK. Im gonna try and test it all properly tonight.

Anyone want the new version, just let me know.

Yes, i'am very interested in doing it your way, becos i Use Miami instead
of AmiTcp.
But will it work with a unregistered version of Yam??
I havent used That E-mail program before, so i'll try and see if i can find
a version of it on Aminet.

It would be nice if you could mail me the program you mentio ned for
generating a mail for each address.

BTW, do you know why i get permission Denied every time i trye to upload to
Aminet, i have coded a Diskmag, and i want to upload it to Aminet.
I have packed it with Lha and i have made a Readme file, but i always get
permission denied??

Thanx for the help m8!

yea, I do. Why? Here it is btw in case you need it:

"All objects within a closed system tend to move toward a state of 
greater stability but lower potential energy."

This goes right along with chemical bonding.

 Is it possible to make modem games with AMOS? So you could play up to say, 8 or 16 people at once?

 I think that would KICK, although, perhaps thats just my warped sence of humor.

 If so, could you mail me? I may need some help on this one :)

I prefer 'maximum disorder', since greater stability and lower potential 
energy do not cover it completely.

But I'm also interested to know why you want to know whether we know
the 2nd law. Are you building a thermodynamic calucations package?

The man most directly responsible for this twaddle was Alastair Murray, who
did thus comment on Re: Modem Games with AMOS? on the night of 16-Nov-97:

-> This is the sort of game that I'm VERY interested in making.
-> I think a really good original internet amiga game would be great.
-> I was going to suggest it when the next amos-list project comes up
-> after bubba.

Hmm, it certainly would be difficult to involve several programmers at
once. One of the projects I had been working on, was a net version of Paul
Burkey's excellent "Sneech" game, and also write it with the GUI extension
to allow GFX card users the chance to play an excellent game. Ive spoken to
Paul about this several times, and he thinks its a great idea.

Im currently converting his excellent PilesOTiles game to AGA, and its
coming along very nicely, I have to say. I just need Pietro to finish
working on his AGA tiles engine so I can use AGA tiles, rather than 32

There are several ways in which you can do it, you can either write an
external server program (which communicates with the game asynchronously)
or through a library call system like AMarquee, in which several players
can connect.

-> Doesn't exactly answer your question... but just letting people know
-> I'd be in for this sort of thing if other people are too.

The best way to practice, is to make it connect to just one other person.
This way, you can mess with sending info etc. Any more than 2, and it
starts getting a bit more complicated, not to mention slower.

Well you could certainly make games playable over modem or over a TCP/IP
connection or whatever but I would not recommend allowing up to 8 - 16
players as I feel this would severely slow down game play.  Personally I'd
stick to 4 or less which is still enough to provide a fun environment but
not bog down the game.  Just my opinion.

Subject: AMOSPro Release: MPDMailpost Update!!
Status: O
X-Status: 

This is an update to one of my AMOS programs, written with the excellent
GUI extension. If anyone would like to have it sent to them via email,
please let me know.

Im also looking for betatesters to try it out before I place it on aminet.
If your interested, please tell me your machine configuration so I can note
it down.

Mush

Short:    V2. Post Same Mails to Large Lists of Recipients Easily
Author:   Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett (mushypd@redrose.net)
Uploader: Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett (mushypd@redrose.net)
Type:     comm/mail

Ever had a large list of email recipients who you want to send the same
mail to, such as a mailing list of people for example, and cant be bothered
to make each individual message in YAM, or use the BCC: function in case it
messes up and bounces to everybody in your list, if even 1 of the long
list of address' was bad, well now you can safetly.

This small program has a simple GUI which allows you to input the necessary
data, such as where the list of recipients is, and the ASCII file you wish
to send them, your Email address, and its just a case of hitting the GO!
button.

Fully customizable interface, which supports many tooltypes for ease of
use, including GUI font sensitivity.

This program is mailing-list ware, which means that as a way of saying
thank-you to me, just send me info of any mailing-lists which you may run
with the program, or groups which you post to. These lists will then be
placed on my WWW pages for all to see and read about. Please, dont
subscribe me to the lists, as I get enough mail as it is. If I like the
list a lot, then I will join.

If you wish to be informed of new updates and releases of this program,
then drop me a line at mushypd@redrose.net with your email address.

CHANGES FROM V1.0
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

* Now has support for users of YAM who found the AmiTCP mail-sending
  functions a little confusing in the previous release. It simply writes
  the mail to the YAM:Outgoing/ folder, so when you go into YAM and open
  the outgoing section, they will all be listed as individual files. The
  old UUSPOOL: mailing functions are still supported fully for auto-SMTP
  delivery.

* Detailed statistics. I have included two percentage bars, one which tells
  you how far through the list of recipients it has progressed so far, and
  the second how far through the individual mail the program is working on.
  The first is handy for large lists of people, so you know roughly how far
  along it is, and the second if you are sending large mails (only usefull
  in YAM, UUSPOOL: mails just progress in 4 steps)

  There is also 2 boxes at the bottom of the GUI which will tell you how
  many bytes in total the system has posted (which is saved to the disk)
  along with a total for the time in which you have had the program
  running. The same kind of system also appears for the number of mails
  posted through the program.

* Scripture interface scheme added. This is especially usefull if you
  have a mailing-list program (such as Mailinglist Manager) you can call
  the program by having it check for a special script (located in the root
  of SYS: partition/disk) which a program of yours can generate, and all
  you need do is start this program once.

* Number of bug fixes, mainly the one where when you hit GO! for a second
  time, it would sometimes shut down due to a small file remaining open.

THINGS YET TO DO
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Add my own SMTP posting routine, which connects directly to the server. I
have a routine which already does this, but removed it at the last minute
as it was causing some strange results on the server.

The next version will probably have news posting capabilities. I have
already written several programs which do this (part of my Mailinglist
Manager software package) and havent had time to incorporate them into this
version.

Im unsure of what else to add, if you have any suggestions, then please feel
free to contact me at mushypd@redrose.net where I will be more than willing
to help you just as soon as I can.

This is the sort of game that I'm VERY interested in making.
I think a really good original internet amiga game would be great.
I was going to suggest it when the next amos-list project comes up
after bubba.
I'd be more than happy to do most of the actual game code, the only
thing I'm not sure about is how you go about sending/recieving
internet information but if it was a group project i'm sure someone
knows how to handle this sort of thing.

Doesn't exactly answer your question... but just letting people know
I'd be in for this sort of thing if other people are too.

Well, ive had that kind of distraction for a bit over a year now, hehe. Ive

Well, thats because you dont seem to have enough of a supply of resources.
Make sure you have plenty of mines, refineries and farms, not to mention more
that enough water pumps. Building a few peasant huts are a good thing, and
build a barracks and begin to make more guards, that way your people will feel
safe, and be safe against an invasion.

Add loads of [Sheild] power ups before the 'mid boss battle'
as it IS the first level of the game

#Any comments?#

The game is cool !
Its extremly playable !
Brilliant sfx !
The Mid Boss is perfect
The Asteroid field is my fave bit  8)
After I read the doc (I always read the docs after I get near the end)
I guessed the cheat first go - I wont say it though just to
let others guess it too 8) it gives bubba unlimited firepower&shields

BTW...
What is the [Destructor] power up meant to do ?

Hi,


 Theres going to be a new 'bubbas bubbles' ready soon !
(sorry about the delay Giark)

and I'm having a small few questions about....

sfx: are the speach AND fx meant to be in the one channel ?

gfx: Adam Parrot - could you send the 3d bubba to James ?
     BTW I drew up the diffent weapons & bonuses myself

     James NEEDs pics of a 3D bubba running in one direction
     (Bubba has to be animated before the next demo)
     If you have any questions about the 3D animated bubba
     ask James or me 8)
     I think that 4 frames would be ok.

EJS: Can you send the music in PT yet ? if you can mail it to me !

What way is the score going to be ?
(eg. What should be the maximum amount of score you can get off
     one bonus 300/3000 ? )

What amigas and ram is the game meant to run on ?

Is there a maximum size of the 'level+files' ?

Is the game going to use a keyfile for regesterd versions ?

How much is the game going to cost ?

Mush.  You're a damn nuicance.  I downloaded it, and before I knew it, ten hours
had passed.  I was trying to do something else.  Argh !

It's a damn good game though - apart from the way all my people keep commiting
suicide.

 Hi all!

I know you have been talking about this in the list before, but I'll ask
again ;)
When running an AMAL program in PAL  will the delay be the same as in NTSC.

For example:
If I use A 0,(1,5)(2,5) it will wait 5/50 second between each frame on my
PAL, but will it on a true NTSC too?
I'm wondering because when I use NTSC in the early startup option on my
A1200 and run a program like this it's a bit faster than if I run it using
PAL. (I use a switch in my program to set PAL/NTSC accordingly)

Basically my question is this: Is 1 vbl the same amount of time on a true
PAL as a true NTSC (1/50 second on my  PAL)

Any help appreciated!

// Mike

How many fonts are you actually using? If the number is low, why not make the
fonts in question into bobs? Paste bob is pretty much the same as working with
external fonts.

It would require an internet connection (obviously) and the amarquee library.
I have not had a chance to do much with it yet (CB is #1 priority right now)
but it should be workable. Or maybe it can be done with the GUI extension TCP
commands. But, yes, it can be done.

   Yes and no.

   For all intents and purposes, consider the two equal.  If an animation
   or whatever is "tweaked" for PAL it should also be fine for NTSC
   although it may be faster in NTSC. 

   Actually, PAL updates at 50 Vbls (or Jiffies as us "old-time
   programmers" say) per second while NTSC updates at 60 Vbls per
   second.

   In PAL,   1 Vbl/Jiffy= 1/50th of a second
   In NTSC, 1 Vbl/Jiffy= 1/60th of a second


   I say it may be faster in NTSC as theoretically it would be 20% faster
   moving from 1/50th of a second to 1/60th of a second, BUT what
   often happens is that a game can no longer update at the full frame-
   rate in NTSC-mode and the result is we get 30 fps which means the
   game would in fact be slower than it was in PAL running at 50fps.


   I hope I have helped and not added to the confusion...


      Take  care,   
      GARFIELD

   Press the second firebutton on your joypad, the second mousebutton
   or the Rt. Alt for keyboard-control.

   The second firebutton (or key) will activate a destructor which performs
   a "smart-bomb"-effect inflicting mass damage on all enemies and is
   also good for the MidBoss...


   THANKS for the comments, I'm glad you liked the demo.

   With all the people telling me the first phase is too green, I will 
   fix this.  Look for some of the enemies to be changed to a
   red/orange/yellow-ish hue in the next demo...


      Take  care,   
      GARFIELD
