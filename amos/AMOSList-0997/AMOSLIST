Old bug, be sure all amos banks have an even length.

Old bug, do not save icon/sprites banks along the  program  but  load  them
after start.

Your fault :)

Now I wonder what Start(BNK) will  result  to.  Start(2435213124)=somewhere
where it is green? :)

Hunt does work indeed.  And  it's  one  of  the  few  commands  that  /are/
bugfree...

My distributor can almost get it, but rest assured when he does, I shall be

Well, my level is well on track now, but I'M STILL AFTER SOME MORE GRAPHICS !!
Particularly for the artic level (which I would REALLY like to do) and a
TOTAL LACK of enemy fighter aircraft !  As stated on the list page info,
closest to player views, at a sensible angle to the player considering the
style of level I'm doing.  New demo will be out any minute now with a lot of
stuff included that wasn't there before.  You'll like it.  Probably.

Are you using a previously compiled executable of the compiler? I often find
that the executable
compiler was usually compiled off my system with the extensions that I have,
and if I add any new
ones, then I have to re-compile the executable.

Couldnt agree with you more. What limits do you want, I say no more than 32
colours (or 64 EHB pushing it) to get the best possible quality.

I have a nice pose I normally use for VDOPhone (full length) and one
wearing my AMOS t-shirt, which isnt full length, and you dont see much of
my face (now dont all answer yes to this one at once!  ;))

Ill scan it on the PC [spit] later today, as my Amiga scanner is only Black
and White.

P.S. My morphing sequence is coming on great. Check out a speccy game
     called Solaris for a similar methos of name entering!

When an executable version of the compiler is made, it is compiled with the
extensions that are in the AMOS setup folder at that time. There is no
other way to add new extensions unless you load the compiler source into
AMOSPro, and re-compile it, with the extensions loaded in the config
menu's.

You should have the compiler shell as a shortcut in your menu anyhow, its
much easier.

	JAN,
	I'm not positive about this but I think the Compiler may have it's
own config files that you have to tell to use the extensions, check under
the compiler setup stuff. Also some of the PD/Shareware extensions don't
compile unless registered, but I don't have any so I don't knwo which ones
they are.

Woah!

I had this problem when I bought Craft, and I eventually gave up, and
just never used the Craft extension. It cost money, but I basically
wrote off that cost. I've never used any extensions since then.

It would never have occurred to me to have to recompile the compiler.

What'd you do? Load the compiler source into Amos and, er, compile it?

hehe!

Ah well, now I know what the problem is. Maybe I'll get a chance to use
that Craft extension I paid for.

Cheers.

	Mush,
	This sounds nuts to me, the compiler laods it's command set from a
config file.  Moreover, I've added the turbo extension and never had to
re-compiled the compiler-shell, infact I've only ever used the compiled
version that came with the package.  But oh well I guess if it works, it
works, although I can't believe there isn't an easier way.

I find it works OK with the compiled version of the compiler, but more
often than not, I just use it from the User menu, so I never have to alter
any compiler config files. Still, there should be an easier way.

Colours ?  24bit will do, they'll all have to be in the same palette anyway,
I'll scrunch them down this end.  Any file format imagefx can handle.  I
need your vertical altitudes for scaling purposes, so the shortest person
doesn't appear the tallest.

Great, though it'd be better if we somehow managed everyone wearing the same
type of outfit though.  It'll add to the value of the pics in the end  ;-)

Shudder.  Now got two video digitizers (b/w & colour), full photoCD set up
(errm, like a CD drive & camera), and access to a full colour flatbed
scanner.  No probs.  Thinking about digital camera, and writing an amiga
driver for it.  Not sure about the price though, they're a bit much.  If it
was that quality, and under a hundred pounds, I'd probably get one today.

Cool.

Hi,

  *A NEW PANG IS UP ON THE WEBPAGE - DOWNLOAD IT!!*

In my extension for amos I wasnt sure which slot to use
(#The Game extension#)

I have slots 7-15 & a few others free
Or I could add It in to the Music extension so
You could have the Music extension + the Game extension
in the same slot  (I could also debug the music ext too)

Which slot would you prefare (1/7-15) ?


bye,

As soon as we have something from all levels, I'll put together a slideshow
thing and put it on the page. If everyone likes it, we'll send it to aminet's
announce section.

....it should say 'probably very low on chip mem'.  It should work if you
shut everything else down, it IS using less than a meg chip.  I am trying
VERY hard to keep it under a meg, but it is gonna go right to the limit,
can't help that, at least till later.  The object optimising routine hasn't
been written yet.  (The kill all objects that aren't used so people with
1meg chip can play routine - very important with dragon - 630 frames of
graphics on that level, errr, actually 650.)

I'm going to be relying on fast mem to get round the 1meg chip limit, that
will hopefully be implemented in the next demo which may use less chip mem. 
Loads of paging.  This is almost entirely so Mr Giark can run the game.

If any people with 2meg chip have any problems loading it, I'm astonished.

Yeah, very naughty.

> If assigned to amos_pro: says file not found.

Took me several minutes to get it working.  First:
	assign amos_pro: ram:
	makedir ram:pang
	cd ram:pang
	lha x pang
	pang

..and it should load.  That was from memory, so don't complain if it doesn't
work.  It's actually quite nice !  I really like the bit at the bottom of
the screen where the score is, but it's a tad big.  Collisions need work
though.  <HINT> A standard score routine for ALL levels is a good idea </HINT>

..am I gonna have to support the bonus level on my level ?  This could be
interesting.  I can see the hard drive light going crazy..

Full body would be best.  Facing front.  At an angle maybe, but still facing
front.  Otherwise it'll just look dead wierd.  ..Plus, as a bonus, when we
all send in the photos, and it's all scaled and composited correctly, it'll
make one hell of a cool image on the other credits page.  World map &
People.  Fascinating stuff.  Scary somehow though.  Hi-res, full colour 
images will be best, 'cos they'll all need scaling for height anyway !
If THIS bit works, it'll be one heck of an international success in
cooperation !  ..an easy to remove background would be nice.  A second
photo, head + shoulders area would be good as well (as well, meaning not
instead.)  This is one we ALL need to put an effort into, otherwise the idea
won't work.  If digital form is difficult at your end, I can scan a hard
copy.

Im going to try and leave my FTP site running from now (3.30am) until at
least 5pm USA EST time.

I apologize for all those who cannot get through to it. My ISP has recently
changed all of its modems to 56K compatable, and im still not sure why,
mine and the wife's modem often drops a couple of hours later, or usually
after a few minutes. Im logging onto a line which doesnt have them yet, but
it is usually so packed, i fall off after a while anyhow.

Anyhow, its late here, so many people shouldnt be on, and the lines will be
OK. Can I please stress to people uploading, that you must include a
.Readme file with your program, otherwise it may not be included.

Thanks

Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett

P.S. Anyone know why a partition suddenly starts to generate checksum
     errors for no apparent reason?

The man most directly responsible for this twaddle was Mush, who did thus
comment on FTP Site on the night of 04-Sep-97:

Well, its 8am and im still online OK. I guess the line is going to hold for
quite a while.

But its way too hard I think that bubba should have more
energy

Apart from that its really cool!

   Hello. Your new Pang is MUCH better!

   There was a bit of a problem with collision-detection and

   I will send you more detailed feedback in a day or two.

   Overall, GREAT work. The bonus stage is really shaping up well.

   I agree completely! Looks VERY nice.

   Er, I agree to a degree. I actually made it through first time.
   Matter of fact, made it to a stage of NOTHING. Well, there was
   background-scenery, but NO enemies or scaling interactive
   scenery...

   At the beginning it did seem quite difficult though.

   Overall, GREAT WORK Keith!! The spiders look cool, like pencil
   sketches... I seem to have missed the webs though. I'll be more
   observant in my next "test"...


>PS: What has happened stage 1 - The side shooter ?

   You will be happy (I think) to know that I will be returning to
   work on the SideShooter within the next week.

   Our father passed away, so Robert and I have been VERY BUSY
   handling all the associated issues and I really haven't been in
   much of a programming mood... BUT, it won't be long now!!


   A bit off the topic, but anybody know where I can find a GOOD
   PD language for the IBM?

   I'd like a nice INEXPENSIVE C/C++ compiler and a good
   INEXPENSIVE gfx-library. Is YAK-Icons still available?
   Really can't afford Fastgraph right now...

   PLEASE Reply To Me Personally!!

Greetings.

Well, unknown to me, Hotmail had me on a "trial period" for accessing 
my mail via POP3 with my email software (Pegasus), and the trial has 
ended. Now they want me to PAY $18.00 for a year's usage of POP 
access. heh. I don't think so, at least, not now, maybe later.

Anyhow, I will soon be closing up my Hotmail accounts, and would 
prefer if everyone that doesn't (or hasn't been) using my forwarding 
accounts @usa.net, to please use them instead.

And you say Hotmail is free? :)

This is all that I could find, its from an old Micheal Cox file. I really

You don't need an extension to do that easy stuff any idiot with a CD32
JoyPad, and the lowlevel.libray can do that easy shit, but reading all
the various combinations of firing buttons, and firing buttons & D-Pad
combinations is tough. If your not going to tackle the tough stuff then
don't even bother!

Dear AMOSers,
Just a quick question that I hope there's a quick answer for.
I want to make some measurements from some digitised video sequences (of
people throwing). Specifically I need to know the angle of elbow flexion (the
angle made between the upper arm and the forearm) at various parts of the
throw. The standard solution to this is to use 2, 3, or even 4 (film) cameras
sync'd together, then the 3-D data is extrapolated from these. This makes for
a very accurate but expensive solution. Then I thought that since the the two
vectors we are measuring are of a known length, I should be able to
extrapolate (by accounting for the perspective foreshortening) what the actual
angle between the two parts of the limb are. The problem is that I don't know
the relevant 3-D maths. I figure though, that anyone writing (for e.g.) a 3-D
modeller, a raycaster, a CAD programme, etc. should be able to point me in the
right direction. So, can anyone help or point me in the right direction?
Rod

..this is why it took so long ;-)  Glad you like it.  There is (cough) MORE
to come.  Particularly IF I GET ANY MORE GRAPHICS <***HINT***>

Hard ?  You sure ?  I sail thru it without losing a life nearly every
time...   Then again, I've played it a thousand times, and know exactly what
the enemies are thinking...   Can you give more details on hard please..

The update I sent has a couple more powerups in it.  Unarchive on top of the
old one.  They appear right in a nest of spikey columns...  ;-)
 
> Apart from that its really cool!

Glad you like it !   ...Is it FAST enough though ?

ATM, I'm trying to make it run in 1meg chip a lot better, adding more SFX,
more flightpaths, getting the dragon moving properly, looking to add
multi-hittable objects (not many), object triggered SFX other stuff.
A new level is slowly under way, with many of the same objects, and (sob)
only three new ones so far.  Arctic level nowhere to be seen...

Mr Giark: On level size, it uses less than 70k source, (a hell of a lot less
when I take out the level generators and other programmers utils), and less
than 110k compiled.  Chip mem size, well, it pushes 1meg to the wall.  Get
that 2meg chip upgrade....   Fast mem, well, it'll end up using about a meg
or so in the end.

Urk.  I'll put support for it in.  I remember one person having some wierd

Wonder how big Adam's level is ??  ;-)
Wonder what it looks like....

..actually, Adam.  Is there a poseable Bubba available ?  Need the gun
pointing straight forward for my level, and by the looks of it, straight up
in the pang level, and to the right for the sideshooter.  Oh, a few frames
of 'falling out the sky' would be appreciated.

Yeah, fully aware of that..  It should have had an early dragon at the
beginning before the nothing though.  It is going to have more dragon
frames, errr, and a few columns.  Then it goes onto the next level.

Comments on the new demos:

Level 2 (castle assault)

! Looks really good!
! Let Bubba be invulnerable in 5 seconds after he died!
! How about some animated frames of Bubba? Would look even better!
! Scrolling background. Just a little bit would do well.
! I still think the attack waves are too fast! Not the update speed, but the
speed between each update.
! How about an animated rainbow to illustrate the speed-effect?
! Sound missing when Bubba shoots!

Level 5 (Pang)

! Won't load! File missing?

Good.

I'm not the only amiga owner that doesn't have aga. We're trying to make a
game for everyone's amiga, remember?

Okay, so people will need a bit of expansion to play it. I don't know anyone
with no fast memory.

Go on, you know you want more chipmem.  I'll be squeezing it down shortly,
gonna be moving the samples to fast mem to start with.  That'll help a lot.

The man most directly responsible for this twaddle was Chris Hodges, who did
thus comment on Amos Extension List on the night of 05-Sep-97:

I would like any information as to the whereabouts of any of the extensions
listed in the below reply. I have cut out those I think I already have/know
about.

If they are shareware/freeware and anyone has a demo of them, I wuld be
gratefull if you could email them to me at mushypd@redrose.net and
information as to wether they must be bought directly is also welcome.

About 50k for your code. about 600-700k of LOADED graphics and sound. As you
can see from the castle assault, as long as you load it separately, you can do
as many graphics as you want.

Hi!

I've been reading all the time I has been subscribed to this AMOS Mailinglist
about this Cap'n Bubba.

What is Cap'n Bubba? That it is an game (probebly made in AMOS :) is rather clear to me...

Is there any betas or something to download on aminet?

I wish you all good luck with it, whatever it is!

I dunno. As it is, its pretty easy to get the power ups. Maybe have him bounce

In the other two channels. EJ leaves two channels free so we can do speech and
fx along with the music. I think we have channels 3 and 4 for fx.

HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD IT! :)

All the Captain Bubba musics are *three* channels, so EJ leaves one channel
free for SFX.

Making normal music using two channels (with lead, bass, drums, and chords)
is neigh on impossible.

So one track for SFX. That's enough isn't it?

Subject: LISTVIEW bug in GUI Extension
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: O
X-Status: 

Im not too sure if anyone else has noticed (I think Adam Parrott had at
some point) there is a bug in the GUI extension (both 1.62 and 1.63) which
causes the conents of the displayed listview to become corrupt.

I have noticed this several times when testing my mailinglist manager with
large lists of files (im testing with 2,000+ entries). I have however,
found a way to overcome the problem. The contents are not altered within
the array being used, it is some kind of refresh bug. If you call the
routine GUI SET again shortly after, it should be OK. The best way to
overcome it (how I have done it anyhow) is like so:

Procedure GETLIST[LST$]
   (blah blah blah)
   Gui Set 1,0,1,ARRAY(TP$(0))
End Proc

Procedure MAIN
   Proc GETLIST["AMOSList"]
   Gui Set 1,0,0,0
   ' The list is displayed, but can be corrupted at this time if the system
   ' wants to be a pain in the bum.

   Repeat
      Gui Set 1,0,1,ARRAY(TP$(0)) : Rem Reset the display so it is corrected

      A=Gui Wait

      If A=0: Rem A Listview Function was Called
         Gui Set 1,0,1,ARRAY(TP$(0)) : Rem Reset to prevent Error
         ....  Add any other Code for the listview function ...
      End If
   Until A=-1 or A=1
End Proc

... And hey presto, its gone! If you dont have the set just before the GUI
Wait command, you often see the mess on the screen until you hit something
inside the listview window, so its nicer to leave it there. Please feel
free to place this message/example in the GUI Guide on the GUI SET command
for Listview, or under the "Known Problems" section.

Pietro, is this a bug as such, or just something that the OS does rather
crazily?

I can hardly wait.

>His idea for disabling the spaceship is gonna look dead cool animated.

Can you make the animations in sections? Obviously, some will be played
between stages, but I'd like to see no one part bigger than 500k (so we can
distribute on floppy). Also, the `play intro' entry on the menu will have two
options: Intro and whole movie. And, could you possibly make the anims about
160 or so high? Then the Bubba movie will look like a 70mm movie.

Well met and godspeed,

Subject: bug in GUI Extension with Listview
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Status: O
X-Status: 

Sorry if this appears twice, the old title didnt seem to send the mail
view, so I changed it a bit.

Im not too sure if anyone else has noticed (I think Adam Parrott had at
some point) there is a bug in the GUI extension (both 1.62 and 1.63) which
causes the conents of the displayed listview to become corrupt.

I have noticed this several times when testing my mailinglist manager with
large lists of files (im testing with 2,000+ entries). I have however,
found a way to overcome the problem. The contents are not altered within
the array being used, it is some kind of refresh bug. If you call the
routine GUI SET again shortly after, it should be OK. The best way to
overcome it (how I have done it anyhow) is like so:

Procedure GETLIST[LST$]
   (blah blah blah)
   Gui Set 1,0,1,ARRAY(TP$(0))
End Proc

Procedure MAIN
   Proc GETLIST["AMOSList"]
   Gui Set 1,0,0,0
   ' The list is displayed, but can be corrupted at this time if the system
   ' wants to be a pain in the bum.

   Repeat
      Gui Set 1,0,1,ARRAY(TP$(0)) : Rem Reset the display so it is corrected

      A=Gui Wait

      If A=0: Rem A Listview Function was Called
         Gui Set 1,0,1,ARRAY(TP$(0)) : Rem Reset to prevent Error
         ....  Add any other Code for the listview function ...
      End If
   Until A=-1 or A=1
End Proc

... And hey presto, its gone! If you dont have the set just before the GUI
Wait command, you often see the mess on the screen until you hit something
inside the listview window, so its nicer to leave it there. Please feel
free to place this message/example in the GUI Guide on the GUI SET command
for Listview, or under the "Known Problems" section.

Pietro, is this a bug as such, or just something that the OS does rather
crazily?

Archived on floppy, or running from floppy ?  I'll assume running on floppy
for now.  Please insert disk 12..

Consider it done.  I'll also be sending you a (very) preliminary animation
player shortly.  I don't think the EVD format will work for this one.
Of course, the whole movie would probably have a bad ending from the menu.. ;-)

Oh yeah.  I know this one.  I just keep refreshing it, that solves it. 
Messy though.

Cool, another one. Hope you enjoy your stay.

-> stay in alpha stage B+), I'm lazy thats why ;+).

Cool. If you have released any demos/full versions for release to the

Im going to experiment with my CD ROM drive attached to the FTP site. As
far as I know, it can only be reached with an FTP client (not a browser) by
typing in CD0: in the path at the top (where the "/" usually appears).

Ill keep my AGA Experience 1 CD in it (from Amiga Format) which has lots of
cool and usefull stuff, ranging from demos, to pics, and all sorts of games
and raycasters etc.

Ive also added a script to my miami config, which automatically activates
my PD library server as soon as it comes online, as im at a job interview
today, and will be leaving it up all day.

Anyone know of a stats program which also measures how much information (in
K or bytes) which was saved/read by the CD, HD and Floppy drives?

Running from floppy if absolutely necessary. I can hardly wait to see the

Cool. Everyone I talk to thinks the 70mm look would be very good.

I will probably make it randomly select good ending or bad. Or maybe it should
only show the good ending if you actually win?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

X-Status: 

I've got round to having another look at the Bubba work in progress so thought I'd give some 
comments.

Pang:
Very good graphics.
Not too keen on the gun. One of the elements which I think made Pang special was the ropey gun 
thing where it sticks to the roof and stays there for a certain time.
Also, maybe the bubbles need better movement. They are too perfect diagonals too look right.
Use either some Sin and Cos calculations or probably better would be a speed and acceleration 
routine.
So the X-Speed of a bubble would stay constant but the Y speed would alter.
So if its in mid air and the Y-Speed is Zero, say you increase it each turn (acting as gravity) 
and thats how many pixels it moves down so it speeds up as a real object would as it falls (a 
maximum Y-speed may be needed too) then when it hits the ground you just make the y-speed 
negative so it is now going upwards and will reach the same height it started from.
I also found a few bugs but couldn't say what the problem was.
All sorts of weird things happened which I assumed weren't meant to happen.
A still bubble appeared at the bottom of the screen and did nothing.
After a while, all collision detection just stopped working too.

Castle Assault:
Much better graphics than the last time I played it. looking very nice now.
I maybe think the player is a bit unresponsive.
I think it relys FAR too much on memorising the entire level because you have no real hope of 
avoiding anything once you see it.
I know I don't have the patience or desire to just play a game over and over again when I think 
little skill is actually involved.
Collision detection is a bit dodgy, I sometimes died when nothing was anywhere near me.

Sorry for all the negative comments but at this stage I suppose theres alot of tweaking involved 
to get things just right. Just recommending some tweaks...

Oh and a couple of other things.
Can people tell me how five pounds converts to other currencies approx? (mainly US and DM really)
Just enquiring for future shareware things.

Also, I asked this before but got no response. Does noone have the full easylife manuel?
Mine has all the sections on Structures missing as well as several other things. 

Thanks,
-Murray

Hi,
   Slight correction to the timeline, I proposed the Bubble Bobble level 
not Mush.
The I stuffed up the disk and instead started pang.

Subject: IMPORTANT: Library Shutdown
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Until further notice, Mushroom PD will b shut down on a permanant basis. I
have gone and done the stupid thing of completely erasing my 1Gb HD, whilst
messing around with the rigid disk block on another HD I had connected.
Somehow, the system got these 2 mixed up, and wrote a 203Mb HD diskblock to
my 1Gb, causing me to lose evrything.

I have a lot of my PD library on PC (on tape storage) from around christmas
time, and I am open to absolutely any possible suggestions as to what
utilities I can run on my Amiga to recover as much of my data as possible. I
have lost everything, including my mailinglist manager source code (which
was almost near completion) and the entire PD library.

My amiga is barely online with my other HD, so please email me at
mushypd@redrose.net with your suggestions. I am sat here almost in tears
wishing I had made a backup a lot sooner than christmas.

Thank-you

Mush

The man most directly responsible for this twaddle was Mr. Giark To You, who
did thus comment on TCP: on the night of 09-Sep-97:
-> Is anyone using socket.library calls to hit a tcp port? If so, can you send
me
-> the code?

I would be interested to see any code too. Thanks

Remove the Gui Set 1,0,1,ARRAY(TP$(0)) from the procedure GETLIST, and put
it outside.. just after the call to GETLIST. i.e.:

Procedure MAIN
   Proc GETLIST["AMOSList"] : Gui Set 1,0,1,ARRAY(TP$(0)) : Gui Set 1,0,0,0

Now it should (...must :-)) works fine without the extra calls to Gui Set.

Oh no.... the bug will be fucked as soon as possible!! Im my programs the
"Know Problems" section never exist! :) If i know a bug i kill it before
the release of the program.

Probably it's a problem of the refresh routine.... probably i already have
the solution :) Stay tuned....

Ive got this far, it puts it in all kinds of wierd drawers (disksalv data

Where shall I start first ?

I would just like to know if anyone has had a look at my gfx on the web
page ?  (story pics)   Its just that I have had no replys since I 
started and its not giving me any incouragement.  I know I`ve been slow
but I`ve been very busy recently with 2 games and starting my new year
at college :(

Also I am now hearing that Keith Hills `tame` gfx artist is also on the
act with animations and stuff. Does this mean I`m out of the picture 
now or just up with some competition :)  ?  

Dont get me wrong, I am still doing the pics its just that im busy. I
can get most of them done soon. Just wait while I get settled at 
college and I`ll get on.

Greetings.

Want to cover a few things real fast.

Firstly (sp? hehe), I want to apologize for not having my level ready 
when I said I would. It's taken more time than I thought to get a 
working raycasting routine (after writing two using Bintz's qbasic 
routine, and finally two of my own, which almost work). I'm getting 
the final quirks out now, and after I get some textures ready, it 
will be on it's way to Giark (ya!)

> Wonder how big Adam's level is ??  ;-)
> Wonder what it looks like....

hehe, I'm not sure how big it will be compiled, but the source is 
about 20k or so right now, may get bigger.

> Actually, Adam.  Is there a poseable Bubba available ?  Need the gun

Ah, yes. For those of you who asked for pictures, Keith of Hill and 
James Brown, I will have those to you as soon as I can (probably this 
weekend is the only time I'll be able to do them, maybe sooner.)

Thanks again everyone.

Hi!

	I am currently working on an anime-style RPG in AMOS. Having
just finished the first part of the adventure, I would like to get
some opinions on the interface, graphics, and gameplay before moving
on with the rest of the program.
	If you are interested in trying this game, and possibly
telling me what you think of it, just reply to this message. I can
send you the lha file as an email attachment, or if you aren't able
to recieve MIME something else can be worked out.

					Thanks!
					Joseph Hewitt.

In the original proposal, I did suggest that we do a bubble bobble clone, 
as that game was so addictive. Even after we all voted, it was declined 
to be used.

I've seen them and liked them, as you know.

Not everyone will want to see all the anims between levels, nor see them all
the time, so you are still on the hook for pictures. You're no slower at it
than any other member of IAPA.

Well, thought I would let you know how it is going. At the moment, i havent 
been able to recover anything whatsoever, and am coming to terms with the fact

that I have lost every piece of code that I had ever done.

I also found 52 megs of stuff on the PC (copied from when I was sending
mail off the PC) so it looks like i'll be formatting my disks and copying
that over. Im waiting for a few programs to arrive first to see what they
can offer.

Could the chap who offered me Amiback by email, please send it. I have the
CD ROM disk with quaterback tools on it, so ill give that a try tonight.

Just a quick message to all members of the Amos List.

I'm now subscribed and although it took about three weeks, I'd just like to
wish you all well with the List Game you all seem to be working on.

If I can help in any way, please email me. I'd love to see the progress on the
game too if it's not too much trouble.

BTW I think you should get in touch with Anthony Sherratt to do some gfx for
the game. His gfx are excellent, but you alredy know that - right?

While I'm here, I may as well ask, does anyone have some code for a gfx
inventory for a gfx adventure game panel? I'm having a bit of a problem with
mine! Just a simple bit of code to paste icons (3 at a time) which can be
clicked through.

You know what I mean. Myself and Anthony Sherratt are working on a gfx
adventure called Roswell which has been in the making for a while now,
but only just back in development.

A demo will be ready very soon.

BTW send example inventory code in MIME or UUEncode with email to:

andy@agasinc.demon.co.uk

Thanx in advance :)

Has anyone heard anything about the new AGA Extension lately?

Is this just another hoax. And what about the rumour of Amos Pro source being
released as PD from Europress? Guess this is just a dream too :(

Ho hum..

Thanx for your time guys `n' gals.

ooo, ouch. I'll bet that smarts. How much are we talking about here,

Quarterback Tools? Alright. This should be a definite help. It's the 
only thing I need (and can really depend on or use that works) that 
will do everything you need or could imagine! Salvage, format, 
unformat, reorganize (which is how I erased my A3000's HD0 partition 
about a month ago, remember? hehe), etc. Anyhow, best of luck.

Hi all... can anyone tell me what has been going on on the mailing list for the 
past couple of months?  I had to un-subscribe ages ago because of a change in my 
e-mail address, and have only just got around to re-joining...  If i remember, 
just before i left everyone was talking about writing a killer game  (and a 
couple people where complaining that it would never get off the ground)...

Cheers

Craig.

I had been using the above method on setting up partition 2 (my PD Library)
and even though I had aligned up DekSID to show the root blockl for DH2 and
DH3, it still wouldnt show when I reset.

However, it struck me after dallying around, to align disk 4 first, then 3,
then 2 etc. I have now managed to recover all partitions except 1 (my
workbench partition) as this was screwed up. The library is completely
intact, which I am certainly glad, plus I was able to recover all my source
code etc.

My Work partition before going down, had developed a read error, as i dont
know why, but the second HD i had attached to the line would also trigger
the 1Gb to make noises. Im running Disksalv 4 on it at the moment (a mate of
mine had registered, so he gladly helped me out).

I expect to be back online with the FTP site by monday. Im working this
afternoon so will have all weekenbd to try and rebuild a workbench partition.

Thank-you to everyone who helped me out by sending programs and advice. With
my first paycheck im gonna buy either a tape drive, or a CD ROM Writer (the
wife wants one too) so I can put my library on CD at the same time.

A couple notes:

The anim prelim drawings are on the page.

How long will it take to do the anims?

Make Shawna less heroic looking. The idea is good, but she looks to much like
a superhero.

The STAB agents should look less threatening and more comical. Ill fitting
uniforms and floppy hats maybe?

The bartender is a robot, not a fat guy.

The sketches are a great beginning.

The GUI Extension offers asynchronous read/write operations. See the
NetDemo program included in the archive (v1.62). The TCP commands aren't
documented in the doc :( ... but they are very easy to use... just see the
demo source.

Hmm, jetpaks, space aliens, other planets... Doesn't sound much like the
present. You should go to the web page and read all the texts.

About the compiler multitask thing. Exactly what does the fix do? Right now,
my bot, as usual, grabs 100% cpu because that's what compiled prgs do. Does
your fix correct this?

     Greetings,
     
        I have a bit of a dilemma about a program I am thinking about 
     coding.  I have a few questions for you that I hope will either set me 
     on my way or stop me before I start what I cannot finish.  We have all 
     heard that you should not begin to code something that may be beyond 
     your abilities so here I am asking for some pointers before I do 
     begin.
     
        I have a music synthesizer that allows me to edit,save & load voice 
     banks.  So I want to code a program that will allow me to load about 5 
     of these banks into memory and say pick the best voices from this 5 
     and put them into one bank.  Save it to disk and load them back into 
     my synthesizer.  Sounds simple enough, right??
     
        This is my first attempt at using and manipulating memory banks and 
     I know I may have picked a bad way to start but bear with me.  Before 
     I go into the details my first question is would I have to use machine 
     code to manipulate the memory banks to achieve what I want?
     
        Do I have to load the file into a memory bank?
     
        I have experimented using BLOAD to load the file into my Amiga and 
     it loads just fine.  The size of the example file I tried is 53,248 
     bytes, obviously it would vary with the number of voices in the bank.  
     I have used RESERVE AS WORK 10,55000 to reserve the bank and loaded 
     the file into Bank 10.  I have also noticed that I can load the same 
     file into memory when I use RESERVE AS WORK 10,2500.  Does the Bank 
     Length have to be the same size as the file I load into memory.
     
       Obviously I will have to know the file structure before I can do 
     anything but I am working on getting this from the manufacturer.
     
        Any help or advice, good or bad, would be greatly appreciated.  I 
     know that coding an application like this is much different that 
     coding a game but I am up for the challenge.  Thanks in advance.
     
     
     Declan.

I have fixed a bug in Realm of Sendai which would cause the game to
crash if a player died of poisoning during combat. In addition, the
speed of the game has been improved considerably. Send me a message
and I can send you the fixed archive.

The comments on the game that I have recieved so far have been of
great help. I look forward to hearing from more of you in the
future. :)

I don't care anymore. Pietro's GUI extension has TCP commands in it. I'm just
waiting on some input from him, then I'll switch over to that.

Speaking of GUIs, anyone find GadToolsBox one of the most cryptic prgs ever
invented?

^Just wondered, If you want to free some power to other programs, then use
the 'Multi Wait' command in your loops, that'll alow other programs to run
nicely at the same time, note that it's best used in loops where some action
is awaited (key press, or menu choice)...

Greetings.

Mush said he had an asm zoom routine, but he never sent it, probably 
because of his recent troubles, for which I don't hold against him.

Anyhow, I was wondering if anyone had what he was talking about 
(there had mention of this before on the List). The routine was Asm 
and was directly insertable into AMOS code (it zoomed AMOS screens, I 
think at different widths of 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, etc.) If someone has 
this routine (or any other routine like this, with or without the 
different magnifications), please send it, by all means.

Thanks again.

I've got a similar problem to what I think Mr Giark had.

If I remember correctly he wanted AMOS so I wouldn't grab 100% of the CPU.
Well I'm using the easylife Iconify command so AMOS becomes a little window in the workbench,
the thing is, everything else still goes super slow when using this (as if I had just presses
Amiga A to return to workbench and left the AMOS program running), this seems pretty stupid to me 
and seems to defeat the point of having an iconify command.

I've tried various Multitasking commands in all the extension, (JD Multi On, Multi Yes etc) but 
whatever they do do (which I couldn't figure out) they don't help.
I can't even do a loop with Multi Wait in it as the command Z=Iconify blah blah, waits until the 
window is closed to return to the amos commands.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
-Murray

For backups consider a ZIP or JAZ for the rewriteability vs. a CD
Writer, though a CD Writer would be KICK, and the disks are cheaper.

I mean you don't have to "mirror" every partition every time you make
a backup. Just save work that has changed. I am very happy with my
ZIP. We have two. The first broke early on, but Iomega replaced it
overnite delivery. No problem with the replacement (used on a 2.1
A500) or the second Zip on my A3000.

Once a year or so I backup almost everything. In the meantime I use
the Archive bit to keep an eye on files that have been altered. But I
don't want to keep overwriting my backups, I usually keep them for
about a year. So you might need about half again as many disks as you
need to make one full backup.

I've been using ABackup, but I downloaded fback yesterday, and it
looks promising.

The GUI Extension correct this.... AMOS doesn't use a OS friendly system
for waiting events like key press, menus select etc and for this reason a
tipical Do....Loop grabs the 100% of the CPU power.

Using the GUI Extension and the Gui Wait command, your program grabs the
0% of the CPU like all the other standard Amiga programs.



                            *The GUI Compiler*

                      *What is it, and what it does???*


The GUI compiler is a patched version of the AMOSPro Compiler.

It creates a more OS friendly code(... i've removed ALL the AMOS hacks!
Now we are working under intution, and we don't need the fucked amos patches)

The programs works in multitasking! as you know you can't run 2 or more AMOS
programs togheter. But using the GUI Compiler, you can do it ;)

the GUI compiler has a Purify function. If you zap the executable produced
by the AMOSPro compiler, you'll find tons of AMOS-related rubbish... using
the GUI Compiler all the rubbish is removed

i've removed/hacked some internal functions... now is impossible to discover
the AMOS nature of your program! You can use SnoopDos, Scout, ARTM, SIP and
so on... nothing! Expecially if you have used the Gui Amiga 1 command at
the start of your program (... see the GUI Ext. doc)

Firstly, I think that you can only create a GUI using Topaz/8 (im not sure
whatever happens if you use another font), and are you using the GUI
SENSITIVE command at all? If not, try to Experiment with it.

My Mailinglist GUI seems to work pretty good when I turn sensitive off.

The GUI Extension correct this.... AMOS doesn't use a OS friendly system
for waiting events like key press, menus select etc and for this reason a
tipical Do....Loop grabs the 100% of the CPU power.

Using the GUI Extension and the Gui Wait command, your program grabs the
0% of the CPU like all the other standard Amiga programs.



                            *The GUI Compiler*

                      *What is it, and what it does???*


The GUI compiler is a patched version of the AMOSPro Compiler.

It creates a more OS friendly code(... i've removed ALL the AMOS hacks!
Now we are working under intution, and we don't need the fucked amos patches)

The programs works in multitasking! as you know you can't run 2 or more AMOS
programs togheter. But using the GUI Compiler, you can do it ;)

the GUI compiler has a Purify function. If you zap the executable produced
by the AMOSPro compiler, you'll find tons of AMOS-related rubbish... using
the GUI Compiler all the rubbish is removed

i've removed/hacked some internal functions... now is impossible to discover
the AMOS nature of your program! You can use SnoopDos, Scout, ARTM, SIP and
so on... nothing! Expecially if you have used the Gui Amiga 1 command at
the start of your program (... see the GUI Ext. doc)

The man most directly responsible for this twaddle was --==Murray==--, who did
thus comment on Multitasking on the night of 15-Sep-97:
-> I've got a similar problem to what I think Mr Giark had.

-> If I remember correctly he wanted AMOS so I wouldn't grab 100% of the CPU.
-> Well I'm using the easylife Iconify command so AMOS becomes a little window
in
-> the workbench,
-> the thing is, everything else still goes super slow when using this (as if
I
-> had just presses
-> Amiga A to return to workbench and left the AMOS program running), this
seems
-> pretty stupid to me 
-> and seems to defeat the point of having an iconify command.

-> I've tried various Multitasking commands in all the extension, (JD Multi
On,
-> Multi Yes etc) but 
-> whatever they do do (which I couldn't figure out) they don't help.
-> I can't even do a loop with Multi Wait in it as the command Z=Iconify blah
-> blah, waits until the 
-> window is closed to return to the amos commands.

What I did before using the GUI Extension, was simply open up a CLI
window from within my AMOS program using CON and a DOSCALL routine, and then
have a second routine respond only to when something has been entered in the
windiw, or clicked on. The sources I had were originally written by Volker
Stepparth.

To see this in action, try running MMPlay CLI (Or titchyplay) as these were
written with those routines, and not the GUI extension. I can dig these
routines out if you want them.

Hi all,
I think someone had this problem recently so hopefully someone will be able 
to help.

Problem is using extensions with Pro Compiler.
Program running via AMOSPro runs fine but when I compile I get 'Extension 
not loaded'
Strange thing is that it used to work fine before as I am using a couple of 
programs which I have previously compiled with extensions.

I think the trouble started when I lost a load of data from Workbench:  I 
was getting invalid checksum errors so I backed up all the data and 
reformatted the disk. (Probably a silly thing to do really!)  It appeared 
that for some reason QB tools only backed up part of the stuff (probably 
forgot to tell it to do all so it checked for archive bit or something.

I managed to find an old config file but obviously it was different and now 
I am unable to compile using extensions.

Any help would be much appreciated.

Hi there!.
I'm pretty new at this so it would be nice if anyone of ya, could tell me
how to 
make some AGA graphics in AMOS Pro... I' also wanna know how to make a sinus
flag.. I've made one this weekend but it IS VERY slow.. Is it AMOS or is it
just 
my code.????

I'm using " F#=0.2*sin(x) " for the curve.
and i do use plot for putting it on the screen.. 

          " Plot 310,F#*51+350,2 " 

Is it Plot who is that slow or is it sinus... I'we tried to put all the sin(x)
results in an array, but it wouldn't get better..

HELP

Okay, I'm trying to make an arkanoid type game, but my routine for the ball
hitting the bricks is flawed if not fatally.

What I have right now, is a 5x5 pixel ball, which is a sprite, and the bricks
are just screen zones(I figured 300+ bobs was out of the question :) ), what I
do is I check for 4 points on the ball, one on the center of each side, and if
it enters a zone, it checks which one, deletes the brick, and changes the
angle of the ball, depending on which side of the ball is in the zone, thereby
also detecting which side of the brick was hit, and at which angle to change
to.  
You see, what the problem is, is sometimes at strange angles, the wrong side
of the ball is in the zone, and the angle is changed wrong as well.

Anyways, Anybody have any better ideas, on how I might do this?

Any help would be appreciated.

Okay, but what if I DO want to use amos screens? GadToolsBox can't create a
scrolling game screen. Your APCmp patch does what?

Are you compiling with disks, or a HD? If you are compiling on floppies, try
the @Copy all libraries to RAM@ option switched on.

No problems, just send me them stonking GUI creations for inclusion in the
library if you ever release them to the public!

Im pretty much a wiz at the extension now, so if you have any more questions
(this applies to everyone) just give me a bell.

Simply make sure you dont use the GUI AMIGA function on, and just compile with
the regular compiler.

plus, i dont think it would be worth placing a GUI and an AMOS screen in the
same program. Try experimenting with some of the GUI scrolling commands etc.

One of the newer features will be to copy AMOS screens directly to a window
(when do i get to test this update, pietro?)

Probably you haven't used the topaz.font/8 with the GadToolsBox. You must
create your GUI using the topaz/8... after the GUI Extension will adapt the
GUI to the current screen font. If you don't like font sensitivity, you can
turn it off using Gui Sensitive Off.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Tcp F Open"
@NEXT "Tcp Put$"

@TOC "Main"
=Tcp Read(<logical file number>,<buffer>,<size>)

Get <size> bytes from the channel, and put them into the <buffer>, a
previously defined AMOS bank.

e.g  S=Start(10) : X=Tcp Read(1,S,100)

Using the bank as a buffer allows the command to run asynchronously. The
command doesn't wait for data to become available, it just sends a request
to the channel. When there is data to be read, Gui Wait will inform you.

A very simple example:

S=Start(10)
A=Tcp Read(1,S,100)
B=Gui Wait
If B=-9 : Rem TCP/IP message received
 D=Tcp Code : Rem D=number of bytes received
 B=Tcp Buffer : Rem B=address of the buffer where the data is stored
EndIf
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Tcp Code"
@NEXT "Tcp Time"
@PREV "Tcp Read"
@TOC "Main"
=Tcp Code

When you receive a TCP/IP message (Gui wait returns -9) you can obtain the
associated code

e.g. if you receive the result of a read request, Tcp Code returns the number
of bytes received. If it's a write request, Tcp Code returns the number of
bytes transferred.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Tcp Time"

@TOC "Main"
=Tcp Send(<logical file number>,<buffer>,<code>)

Send the specified number of bytes, starting from <buffer>, to the channel.
Like Tcp Read, this command is asynchronous. The command doesn't wait for the
end of the transfer, but quits immediately so your program can continue its
work. When the transfer is complete, you will receive a TCP/IP message. See
the @{"above" LINK "Tcp Read"} example.

e.g. X=Tcp Send(1,S,125)
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Tcp Reset"

@TOC "Main"
=Tcp Channel

Returns the channel number associated with the TCP/IP message returned by
Gui Wait
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Tcp Buffer"
@PREV "Tcp Channel"
@TOC "Main"
=Tcp Buffer

Returns the buffer address associated with the TCP/IP message returned by
Gui Wait.

e.g if you receive the result of a read request (Tcp Read) Tcp Buffer is
the address where the data is stored.

^You should be able to use the 'copy' command to move the data to another bank
     
>        Do I have to load the file into a memory bank?

^I see little other alternative (You could ofcourse reserve a bit of memory
with an exec call and put it there, but the result would be the same...),
another alternative could be to use arrays to hold values, but that would
REALY need some memory...

^Nope, But it should be AT LEAST as long as the file you'd like to load, if
the bank is smaller you begin to write to none alocated memory, and if
another (or even your own) program uses that area, well down you go.. You
should always check the file length before loading something into a bank.

^When you've gotten hold of the structure, then it should be quite easy to
do, the only problem will proberly come up if you'd like to hear the
voices in your program, (Sam Raw might help there), simply copy/move data
from memory banks (or parts thereoff) to other memorybanks, is a piece of
cake.....

	Don't worry if you can't finish what you start in AMOS, it's not quite the same as say starting somethign at the local Pub :)

	Most likely yes.  Do you have the AMOS manaul?  The AMOS machine code
commands you'll have to use are pretty simply, just readin and writing stuff to memory addresses, and as an added benefit AMOS will tell you what address so all you have to do is know the bank number and how big your samples are.

	No, AMOS is smart it will automatically resize the bank if you try to load more data into it than it has room for.  See while it may seem intimidating at first, AMOS memory bank manipulation is really pretty easy.

	Yeah you will need the file structure, hopefully it has as little overhead as possible, since that will make life alot easier on you.  Well I'm not sure what to tell you, perhaps if you can get more specifics about the file strucutre, maybe post a file to the list and folks here can examineit for you.  
OTherwise, good luck, and don't worry, just sace before you run your prog and the worst thign that can happen is your AMiga resets, I'm sure you're familiar with the words "GURU MEDITATION" by now. 

	Thanks,

OK, the system is pretty much back online now. I have (sort of) replaced all
my
assigns, libs, fonts etc. and the next step will be to recover the FTP data
files (they are there, but not activiating for some reason).

If any of you have ordered stuff from the library (some 60 people, well over
200
programs) then please please be patient. I will get to your order as soon as I
possibly can.

In the next 2 or 3 days, i will be releasing a new library report and update
of
new software, so if you have anything you would like included, please send it
to
me as soon as possible.

The best way to deal with sin & cos is to build a precalculated table and
store the values of the curve into an array.

Thanks to all who suggested how to sort my compiler problem.

It was sorted in minutes using the following steps sent to me by Magnus 
Sjöberg:

(Text by Pietro Ghizzoni.)

1) Load the Compiler_Shell.Amos program.
2) Open all the procedures.
3) Go to line number 573.
4) Replace "Until R<-26" with "Until R<-42".
5) Save the program.
6) It's done! :)

The same error is in the Tiny_Shell.Amos program at line 288.

Basically I changed that number and recompiled and all is now fine.

Wayne.

Try
Open In 1,"<filename>"
A=Lof(1)
Close1
Reserve As Work 10,A

To move the info around, use

Copy <start of data location>,<end of data location> To <new location>

all locations are memory addresses

I don't want both. I just wanted to know what the apcmp patch fixes. The docs
in the extension say it patches several things, but not what they are.

Pietro, how about a command to set the version info of the prg so when you do
a version command it will return something other than amos Pro 2.00?

The major way of gaining speed is not to use floating point arithmetic ...

For example ...

For G=0 To 359
   MYCOS(G)=Cos(G)*256
   MYSIN(G)=Sin(G)*256
Next

Now when using MYCOS(), just divide everything by 256 ...

For G=0 To 359
   Plot 160+(MYCOS(G)*100/256),128+(MYSIN(G)*100/256)
Next

Which draws (Hopefully!) a 100 radius circle!

Carl.

If your floor is based of a series of pallete colours (say 5 to 11) and using
a
SET HOTSPOT on the lemming sprite (or something along those lines) you could
retrieve the colour of the point directly under his feet, and also, directly
in
front say, the 6 pixels high. A second point under his feet should check 1
above
for a non-hit, so that you ensure he is not walking through a floor/wall.

If there is no pixel a the point underneath his feet, then it is presumed that
he is droping down the floor, so move him down until he hits a point. Scanning
to the left/right side of the character at the height of a wall limit, will
produce a hit of wall if the wall is too high, and if it is blank, then you
know
that he can walk up there, else he will not be able to move in that direction.

Usually, the programs reserve a chunk of memory upon loading (hence why some
need a lot of memory) which is increased automatically when a certain size is
reached in memory, of your document size.

Usually, the buffer is all in one part of the memory to make loading/saving a
file a heck of a lot easier.

Here is an example:

This is how it could look like.00000000000000000000000000000000000000
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

would be how it looks in the buffer. a small flag within the program knows the
exact place to save to, and a BSAVE command is issued, so you dont get the
full
length of the buffer, aven if the file is only 1 character.

If the map is only 80x20, then make a line of 80 characters, copy+paste it 20
times, then make the map using an overwrite mode instead of insert.

It's the best way m8 :)

Try this out...

F$="name of file"
BNK=10
Open In 1,F$
L=Lof(1)
Close 1
Reserve As Work BNK
Bload F$,Start(BNK)

This  will  open in your file and get it's actual size. Then Amos will
create a bank this size and simply load the file into it.

Coz you're new to Amos, you can save this bank easily with:

Bsave "new filename),Start(BNK) to Start(BNK)+Length(BNK)

This  would save the original file to disk for you, but you don't need
to do that just yet.....read on...

Could  you  be a bit more specific? Is this just a RAW sample or what?
If not, you may need to remove headers etc :(

Can  you  send a file to myself (or the Amos List guys if it's not too
big)? So we can try and understand the file a bit more?

Some aspects are the same and it's not too hard when you get going m8.
BTW Do you have the Amos manual and is it Amos Classic or Amos Pro you
are using? Coverdisk or full versions? Let us know :)

Right,  you  also  wanted  to  copy banks to other banks. Well, simply
follow  the  above procedure and load you 5 or so files into different
banks.

eg 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14

Now  you  will need a bank to hold ALL the others. Simply do something
like this...
ST=0
For X=10 to 14
XXX=Length(X)
Add ST,XXX
Next X

Now reserve a new BIG bank to hold all the others...

Reserve As Work 16,ST

And  use  the  Amos Copy command to copy the other banks across. Don't
forget  to  update  mem  position also after each copy so next bank is
copied to the BIG bank after the previously copied data :)

This is all from memory and may have little errors, but hey, I hope it
helps.

Now  simply  save the Big bank as described earlier with BSave and you
have your file :)

Let us know how you get on Declan.

	Cori,
	Hey instead of setting up complicated Screen zones, why not
	jsut use Point or F Point to check the colour around your ball
	then just make the bricks use a set range of colours, like
	the alst 16 or something.  This will work identical to 
	using screen zones only is Much Easier to implment
	and shoudl use a ton less memory.  As for the angle business
	I recommend only checking certain sides of the ball
	depending on the Angle, so if is going up and right you only
	check points on those sides.  This should let you check
	more points and also will make sure you only catch the right
	bounces.  Well otherwise more specifics about your
	code will be needed.  
		Thanks,
		Scott Matott sXe

 Okay guys.

 I'm making a Lemmings clone, and I've got to make the lemming BOBS trace the ground, so they appear to be walking on it, the ground is NOT a bob, and is a background (basicly I PASTE bobs to it, so its more or less an IFF picture).

 Does anybody know a sort of easy way I can have a lemmings walk up and down along the ground, and if he comes up to a wall (about 6 pixels high) turns around?

 Thanks.

Hello out there...

I'm working on a rewrite of the AlienBreed 3DII Editors, as I went along
I found that I need to write a simple (one screen 80*20 chars) text-editor, so
now I'm wondering, how a fast editor like 'GoldED' or 'McEmacs' is working
when one's just typing ahead, does it simply reserves an amount of memory and
then when I enter a new letter (Inserting) it simply moves the text after the
new character a place (Using something like AMOS 'copy' command) or is there
some other better way to do something like this ??

-- 
Happy greetings, Yours..

 Hi guys,

 Because I'm making a Lemmings clone, I also want a level editor, it should
work in the way that the user can put down any of the gfx cut outs, and 
paste then down, the editor should record where it put them, in say, COORDS
or something, save it and then load it. But how do I make it save this type
of command?

 What is more, how do I WRITE it in the first place?

Well, i dl'ed some files from the secret page a while ago, so it looks 
like time for some comments. Un14-8ly the machine I'm using only runs 
Netscrape which messes up everything it doesn't know, so the only things 
that got through unscathed was the text files (which is my answer to the 
question in one of them about "why are you reading this and not playing 
the game) and the zip file, so the only thing i can comment on is the 
Castle Assault level.
Actually i have only played it a couple of times and didn't get far 
enough to see the dragon (?) and whatever comes further in, but as the 
heading says this is just first impressions. I got further the second 
time than the first, so I would say the difficulty is about right. *But* 
there is one thing that is really a killer. The reason most games make 
the hero invulnerable for a few seconds after losing a life is to keep 
him from hitting the same baddie over and over not getting anywhere. 
That's what happened to me the last time. "Oh, i'm hit! Get ready, go! 
Oh, i'm hit! Get ready, go! Oh, i'm hit! Game over!"
BTW, groovy voice, Giark. I feel tempted to ask if you're related to 
Rowan Atkinson or something.
And i liked the ringshaped missiles (or whatever they are supposed to 
be) too. Un14/8ly it looks like i won't be able to comment on any newer 
versions or the other levels for a while because the library has started 
locking the disk drives again, which means no dl for a while.

Your GUI needs to be designed on a non-interlace screen, otherwise the heights
will be munched.

The width is still not coming out right. I design it 640 wide, but it shows up
about 500 wide, but that may be the font sensitivity.

Yeah me too, but most people can't stand all that bleeping, and it isn't
possible to use samples with THX music.

The micro-emacs strategy, at least in the flavors I studied, had
a line structure like:
  - list link (pointer to next line)
  - allocated size (how much memory allocated for this line)
  - actual size (how much used for this line)
  - buffer pointer (to the line data)

The memory allocated was based on the expected growth of the
line. A line read from a file was given just enough allocation
to hold it (not growing). Then when edited the line allocation
would be increased to a multiple of a preset block size. An
insert or delete of a character would indeed 'copy' the rest
of the line's data to new positions in the buffer.

Anyway, the allocation scheme isn't really where the 'speed'
comes from. (Good thing, too, as I would expect that to be
a nightmare to try and mimic in Amos. Probably easier to
allocate for a very big line, and leave it.) Speed is judged
by the response time the user sees, and the slowest part is
actually putting the characters on the screen. There are
many ways to do this (many Memacs variations had a 'cost'
table, where several ways to refresh the screen would each
be 'scored' for cost, and the strategy with the lowest score
was used to paint the screen. Definite overkill for your
case.) 

The core of the strategy always came down to update as little
as possible, and the most common case was erase from cursor
to end of line and reprint what should be there. That should
be a lot more practical.

Hope this helps,
-Richard

-> The width is still not coming out right. I design it 640 wide, but it shows

Hmm, are you sure your doing it right?

My Mailinglist Manager program uses a window of 640 wide, and when in the
program, it comes out fine.

In the first line of your program before any GUI commands called, put the GUI
SENSITIVE OFF command in there. This stops the program auto-squashing windows,
gadgets and buttons to the sizes of the proportional fault set in your
workbench
prefs.

No Im not the person who drew the sketches but I could do some also if
thier wanted. Im much better with pencil and paper than I am with mouse
and err... screen :)

But even if I did it wouldnt be any use, I dont have access to a

Very soon. Its still needs a bit of work and should be out early
October at the latest.

I could sent you a new improved demo if you want ?  Email me
personnally and that goes for anyone else who wants a new demo to try.

Sure. I noticed that I forgot Tcp Close. I wonder if there are any other tcp
commands that were not in the demo?

Next week, I will be sending mail to ALL those who have access to the

On 16-Sep-97, Jamie Bentley sat on a keyboard and produced this mess:

>  I'm making a Lemmings clone, and I've got to make the lemming BOBS trace the ground, so they appear to be walking on it, the ground is NOT a bob, and is a background (basicly I PASTE bobs to it, so its more or less an IFF picture).

>  Does anybody know a sort of easy way I can have a lemmings walk up and down along the ground, and if he comes up to a wall (about 6 pixels high) turns around?

Yep, it's quite easy to do. Assuming the hot-spot of the lemming is at the
bottom of him you can do this for walking right - it's something similar
for walking left...

   If Point(x+1,y-6)=0
      ' x+1 - for next pixel
      ' y-6 - to check if wall to the right is too high
      ' =0  - 0 is background colour

      ' Isn't too steep, so he can move right
      Inc x

      ' Now we have to find out how steep the land is...
      If Point(x,y-1)=0
         ' Check at ground level first because it's the most likely case
         ' Here we don't need to move him up at all because the land is
         ' flat or slops down - if it slops down, he can fall down when he
         ' next gets updated.

      Else If Point(x,y-2)=0
         ' Now he has to move up one pixel
         Dec y

      Else If Point(x,y-3)=0
         ' Moves up two pixels
         Add y,-2

      Else If etc - Could do this with a loop but it may be slightly slower
      End If

   Else : Rem Must have hit a wall
      ' Change direction
   End If

I hope that helps.

No, it's that sometimes, the proportional font is actually wider than the
topaz font.

On a different note, how does the Tcp work? For my bot, I need to read in a
line of text, process it, read in the next.

Now, the size of the lines will vary, so what happens when I read a line
calling a set number of bytes? I figure I should use 256 for the size, as
that's the max size of a single IRC line. But, will the buffer grab part of
the next line too? I don't think it will, but an explanation of how the TCP
commands work (not how you use them, I got that part) would be nice.

One of the problems im experiencing in my mailinglist manager program will be
the size of the overall source code, and lack of usability. I have opted to
use
several external modules (now that several AMOS programs can run in
accordance)

Is there a way to tell the GUI extension to shut up for say, 30 seconds,
without
a massive suck on the processor. One of the modules is a statistics viewer,
which will update every 30 seconds (or whatever the user sets). I can do it,
just wondered how the GUI Extension would see the less CPU using time and
method.

OK, just abrief few words on my mailinglist manager programs, and how it will
help the AMOS mailing list (i hope).

At time of release, I shall also be keeping a catalogue of email receivers, so
it is optional to either subscribe to the list directly, or to go through my
address. My list is just a mirror of the AMOS list, and there are no real
extras
as all the commands can be made accessable from either way.

As i mentioned in a previous email, it will have a module to save the entire
days postings in the form of a digest. This is where instead of just pasting
lots of ugly headers, followed by the message, then the next set of headers
etc.
it will firstly display all of the mail topics in one part of the top, then
underneath, each page will be cortioned off and have only limited headers
(such
as from: subject: etc.) and a nice divider system, so the overall document is
not so tatty and easier to read.

The newest quality I have been adding on, is the fact it can open its own
public
screen on any screenmode, including AGA and graphics cards mode. This prevents
the rather nasty flickering and stretching some cards use to display lower Hz
screens.

It now supports backlog postings, in the way you can send a message and the
program will automatically archive, and send you the postings made on the date
you request. I have set it to work by day, month, or year sensitive, or to
have
all postings ever mailed to you (phew!) at any address that you specify.

A similar system developed from the above idea is running a fileserver through
email, which as some of you have experienced from my library, can be a
helpfull
thing to have as I am currently doing it all be hand. This is still in
planning,
and not sure wether to add it or not.

I have a few ideas, but I dont want to bore you to death. Please contact me
through the list if you have any suggestions, so everyone else can put their
piece in too. Im especially interested to hear about any features current list
members would like to see/not see.

I see, well why didnt you say that! The only way around that, would be if the
screen it is opened on can accomodate the GUI, otherwise it will do rather odd
things. A GUI SENSITIVE ON command might do a little bit of help if the screen
is slightly thinner, but im not sure how your fonts would react with it.

Cool, sounds easy enough. Use the TCP READ command.

-> commands work (not how you use them, I got that part) would be nice.

The way the command works, is it will store stuff directly into a bank/buffer,
so you could either wait until a TCP message has been received (the extension
has a flag which you can make warn you if you have a TCP message waiting to be
read in) and so just read in the new stack. It should only be one line, but
you
could optionaly check for the EOF character, or simply the IRC command
(remember, an IRC input/output string is *NOT* just the text you want the
channel/nick to see). An example input would be (copied from a log) :

PRIVMSG Mush :hello there, mush old bean!

would make the bot MSG me!

Mind you, you should already know all this, otherwise you will have to sit and
learn all the nescessary bits and pieces to respond to pings, nick changes,
messages etc.

The man most directly responsible for this twaddle was Peter Falkesand, who
did thus comment on AGA on the night of 15-Sep-97:
-> Hi there!.
-> I'm pretty new at this so it would be nice if anyone of ya, could tell me
-> how to 
-> make some AGA graphics in AMOS Pro... 

OK, the only real AMOSPro graphics i have seen is in the form of a simple
copper
effect (which is about the only thing out) but the GUI Extension I am
currently
messing around with for Pietro opens GUI Workbench public screens, and will
draw
and paste bobs etc. with the greatest of ease.

Hello,

I'm new to the list (again, after a couple of years).  I am currently 
working on a project for which AMOS should be sufficient.  However, in my 
internet browsing for information, I came across a comment that seemed to 
indicate that AMOS has trouble with Hires Laced screens in WorkBench 3.1. 
 Is this true?  I am not too concerned with unusual WorkBench modes, 
because my project is intended for dedicated systems which won't be 
bogged down with any fancy modes or other software to interfere with AMOS 
(or AMOS to interfere with them).

I'm using AMOS Professional and its accompanying compiler.  My Amiga is 
an A500 with WB 2.04.  Does anyone have a list of caveats when 
developing for the A1200?  I won't need any AGA information, just 
backwards compatibility info for 3.1, 3.0, 2.0, etc.

Can I expect my AMOS program written under 2.04 to work on a new Amiga?

BTW, I have a really great file requester procedure I wrote a couple of 
years ago which looks like the 2.0 or the reqtools requester, but instead 
of a "Volumes" button it has "Devices" and "Assigns," like the DPaint 
requester.  It needs no extensions or anything, it's just written in 
regular AMOS Professional.  I thought about offering it to the AMOS List 
before, but never did it.  If anyone is interested, send me email and 
I'll email it to you.

Thank you,

John F. Rodgers

MIME-Version: 1.0

Hi,

As work is progressing well on #The Game Extension# I was
considering to put in AGA support aswell (This would be
Super Hi-res laced screens aswell as 256 colour)

But AGA is a lot of extra work and will delay the
relase of the extension by about 1-2 months !

I know that Evert Jan Slypen was doing a AGA extension
a while ago but I dont know how near it is to be finished
cos I think that it might be a waste of time for me to
start to add in AGA when EJS might be doing AGA aswell

AGA will also be alot slower than 16col LowRes
as there are more colours,bitplanes,better gfx,etc......

But a 16col,LowRes in my extension will be faster han a normal
Amos Screen

Anyway.... Does *EVERYONE* want *AGA* /quickly/ ?

No, I just have to make the GUI a bit wider and leave a bit more space between
gadgets. Q8-{)

I just don't want any slowdowns, as GUI looks to be a speed up function.

I know that. My bot would be pretty lame if I couldn't do any channel stuff,
eh?

Well met and godspeed,

Subject: Still not connecting but thanks anyway

To all AMOS auto-repliers:  Please, let there be no confusion, even though 
there apparently is.  I am not woman!

Thanks to Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett for his reply to my question. Well, I sent 
him some artwork for review around 8-21-97, just to see if there would be any 
problems getting attachments. Did not get any response for some time, until 
9-14-96 (last Sunday) when I got email which stated that he had not heard from 
me lately, so I send an email in response to see if he got the pics. Tues 
rolls around and still no reply, however he did submit a question to the AMOS 
list group on 9-16-97. So I figured that maybe he is connecting at the least 
with the list group, so I tried connecting through the group. Still no reply.

My first impression is that he is receiving email, but is not replying for 
some unknown reason.  However...I did receive an email on 9-14-96?  So, I do 
not know.  Maybe he is not getting email from his receiver. I personally am 
not familiar with this problem so far.

Really, I do have alot of things that I need to work on, so I do not feel 
inclined to continue with this so-called "connecting" problem.  Sorry, to have 
bother you all with it, however I do appreciate the reply to question.
