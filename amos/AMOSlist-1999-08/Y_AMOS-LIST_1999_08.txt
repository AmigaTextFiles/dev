Using the info in the technosound manual I got data from one, but it didn't
seem to be much use as when I played it as a sample it was just noise.
Perhaps I have to sign the data, or maybe it couldn't sample it fast enough to
get any meaningful sound from it?


I don't seem to have a copy anywhere, but if no-one else has a /working /one,
I could try getting it working again.


See ya.

Ah, floating point no's are around 3 to 4 times slower then integer when
compiled, but so what? My James Bond game uses a lot of floating point stuff and
that runs fine, if it didn't have to contend with the blitter's speed it'd run
at 50fps ;).

If you want the game to remain at the same speed, add an automatic frame
skipper, and store stuff like sin/cos's in a table instead of calling them
directly.


See ya.

Screen Problem

Mon Aug 2, 1999 5:33 pm
roger buckley <rogerbu@callnetuk.com>


Hi everyone,

For the last couple of years any buttons I've used have all been inside the
640x200
range as even though I open a 640x256 screen and alter the mouse limit I
cannot get the mouse down low enough. My latest project involves
forward/backwards buttons which look pretty stupid half way up the screen.
Can anyone help please ? If I can solve this I might be able to stem
Andrew's monopoly of the Readers Games Prize (fat chance!). Actually I
might get on with my projects faster if I could stop playing James Bond all
night.

Kind regards

Have you tried either:

Limit mouse 0 (that turns off mouse limiting, or is it 1?)

or

Limit mouse x hard(0),y hard(0) to x hard(640),y hard(256)

Don't worry, I doubt that I'll be doing any more readers games, I'm breaking

Yes, thats right, be on the look out for such brilliant titles as 'Blast

woah no, I'm sorry, I can't upload 4 megs to the damn Tripod server, I'd be
there all day! What you can do, is use this program (from aminet). Its a PC
file splitter, that way you can use it to split the game up on the PC, then copy
it to disks and re-join it with, say, MuiJoin on your amiga.

Do you still have that info? It would be a great help
as AMOS isn't my first language anymore. Did it
detail
the custom chips registers you had to deal with?

The format is probably 8bit signed or unsigned, just
experiment. Sampling fast enough could be a problem,
if you have a 7 MHz processor sampling stereo at
22050 Hz that leaves you with about 160 clock cycles
to do everything, including running the operating
system. Time for assembly language...

you know asm? excellent, thats what language they gave it in, I just modified
it to amos code. Here's what the manual says:


1. Initialise the parallel port:

Move.b #0,$bfe301 ;set port to input
Move.b #6,$bfd200 ;ini left and right channel
Move.b #2,$bfd000 ;select left channel (send 4 for right channel)

2. Read the data.

Move.b $bfe101,d0 ;Get sample data
Subi.b #128,d0 ;sign the data



there you go, It was a simple task of changing the move.b's to peeks and pokes
to use it in amos.

See ya.

I know that it sounds stupid, but have you tried putting the Direct
Mode window lower? I found that most of the times I cannot get the
mouse lower unless I put the window down...
Hope this helps

Points about Limit Mouse:

1 it uses the screen position, (128,50) as an offset
2. It uses low res coordinates, no matter what screen you are opening

so

Limit mouse 128,50 to 447,305

should work.

447= 128 (x offset default) + 319 (low res version of screen width, weird but
true)
305= 50 (y offset default [may be different on PAL)) +255 (low res again)

Tried that but still limited movement so I inserted and loop to print the
mouse co-ordinates and found that although I opened a screen of 640x256 the
mouse co-ordinates were top left 124,40 and bottom right 448,294 giving a
display of 320x256 for the mouse. I've fed these co-ords in and all is
well. Many thanks for your speedy response it's much appreciated.

I wish you well in the future with commercial stuff. Had Ocean released your
James Bond a few years ago as an official tie-in they perhaps wouldn't have
been lumbered with such a bad reputation for crappy film tie-ins like Total
Recall etc.
Many thanks too to Paolo Rinaldi who also helped with this problem.

AFAIK the offset is not covered in the online Help for Amospro, hence my

Yep, thats because it works in hardware co-ordinates.

By the way, After checking with the Amos manual, I was wrong about the limit
mouse thing:

To set the mouse limit of the current screen (thats to the screen's boarders)
all you have to do is:


Wait Vbl
Limit Mouse


That way the mouse will be perfectly limited to the current screen.

(The wait vbl bit, apparently, is important)

See ya.

I was working on an Animation player thing
to add soundFX and music to anim's as well as fades and
set frame rate, plus make it possible to stream many anim's
together....
Turns out there is already animatED out there to do this!
I downloaded it today, will check it out, my Amos
prog is fully written, just that unless Pt Raw can get working
sounds will ruin any music being played. Also I am considering maye
maybe using DME to do the music bit, it is strange though, you
must specify a channel to shut off, then play a sound
then I guess turn the channel back on again for music...
Ok for games, but will be tricky on a system like this, where
I need to be able to handle any thing a user can throw at
the proggy..

Anyway, I may release my code anyway, even knowing animatED
is out there, it seems similar but I have a few tricks up my sleeve that
may make the AMOS go at an Anim/Sound system worthwhile...

!James Bond on a GFX card screen!!

Thu Aug 5, 1999 9:37 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

Whats that you say? You can't use a GFX card with amos?

Well, Think again! James Bond V0.98 is now out (cor, that was quick - ed) and
this time it supports ANY GFX CARD!

Yes, thats right! Now all you BV/CV owners who were missing out because they
didn't have a scandoubler can now finally play You Only Live Twice.

And if that wasn't enough, the CPU players are better and some bugs are fixed
too ;)


So, why not go to my homepage, Http://members.tripod.com/~mantasoft/ and
download a copy of James Bond V0.98 now ;)




PS. James Bond has not yet been /tested/ on a gfx card, but the routines it uses
have, so it should work no prob.

PPS. Does anyone have one of those 4-player adapters? I would /really/ like to
know if James Bond actually works with it...

See ya.

TCP commands.

Sat Aug 7, 1999 5:28 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

Ok, I've started making some changes to my James Bond game to allow for a TCP
network option, but I still can't figure out the GUI extention's TCP commands.

So, has anyone at all got any example code of some simple TCP commands, say a
Telnet program written in amos? please?

See ya.

Hi Everybody,

Ok, I have more spasific questions about the TCP commands in the GUI ext:


How do I make it wait for someone to connect to you? I've tried opening the TCP
port on my machine (my IP no.) but that fails.

I want to make it set up a server for people to connect to, but I can't for
the life of me work out how.

Also, how would that affect multiple logins? Like, what would happen if someone
was connected to it, and someone else tried to connect?


Anyway, if anyone has any amos program that can communicate with another copy of
it's self over the 'net could I plleeeaaaasssseee have a look at it?

See ya.

You would use inetd (part of your system in miami or whatever) and launch the
program that way, just like any other daemon. inetd will send the port info to
your program and you can read it using the Command Line$ instruction.

I've just started working on a Lunar Conquest INet version, so I'm wrestling
with the same problems.

I just told you. You'll have to experiment with the arguments and see how it
comes through, but it should launch properly that way.

Well, if the data can be kept separate, compile the program with gui mode, not
amos mode, so you can run multiple copies.

They are not quite like serial commands..

a server program needs to put a socket in listen mode, and when detects a
client connecting process the data from the client..

to have multiple connect sessions, you need to start the server <-->
communication in a separate thread, and then put the server socket back in
listen mode..

Well that works under win32 and unix, may be different using AMOS though..

Yeah, but they're far more complex, and I don't like complex things, I'm

Oh no, I can't run it in GUI mode, it uses too much interupt stuff. I have
the multitasker patcher though, it removes the switcher code. But could I run
multiple copies to test it? Would it work if all copies were on my machine?

Go into miami's interface, under interface and look at the inetd entries. You
could pick a port for your game, then set up a command to run it followed by
the port data parameters.

Depends on whether you want multiple users logging in. I think you can set
inetd to only spawn 1 process.

Well, I don't use Miami, I use AmiTCP Genesis. I'd better check it has it...

Ah yes, here we go. I've got a section in the prefs and an exe. Lets see If I
can work out how to use it. Well I can't understand all that in the prefs, lets
try running it:

11.Workbench:> inetd ?
SERVPRI/K/N,TOOMANY/K/N,DEBUG/S,CONFIGFILE:
inetd: already exists

Um, hmmm, err, what does that mean?

So, could I run this from my amos program, like say Exec "Inetd blah blah blah"
or would the user have to set all that up manualy if he wanted to host a game?

Also, is the Inetd system used in Miami and genesis different? Would I need two
routines to handel each?

Well, the only incentive I have is that the sooner you can do that, the
sooner /I/ can add TCP support to JamesBond (thats, if you like JB that is...)

Anyway, cheers ;)

Ah good, I have a funny feeling it would be a lot easer having 4 seperate
ports for the different players.

Miami, AmiTCP and Genesis (which is just a GUI for AmiTCP) works in the exact
same way AFAIK.

Hi,
I'm doing a game in AMOS, sort of like Grand Theft Auto, only
wihtout the cars (at the moment anyway ;) and have just done a
map scroller test, because I've NEVER done a scrolling game before ;)

The map data is stored inside the program ATM (see below) and all
files needed are included.

My questions are:

1) Why do the map graphics trash up when you go so far down (and I

InetD is always running, for it is your own personal port monitor/manager.

No, you set up an entry in your database for InetD like this:

Port 453 myprog parameters

and when someone addresses your system on port 453, it will run your program
and pass the parameters you specify to it, allowing you to make a tcp
connection.

InetD is just a program launcher, basically. It works the same across the
board. You'll have to find out how the prameters are dealt with, but amos can
read them.

So, what would happen? Say I was at IP addy w.x.y.z and someone from a
different one called TCP OPEN 1,"w.x.y.z/453" what would happen?

Would the program just run whatever? What would it output? How would I then
use that to open the connection to the other person?


And finally, can I set this up on the fly? I really would not expect people
to have to set up about 6 different ports on there own just so they could host a
game of James Bond. (thats how many I think I'd need, because trying to do it
all with one port would get rather messy I think)

I mean, Quake can set up a listening port without messing about like that, so
there must be a way? Anyone?


See ya.

Your problem is simple, it is the same problem I had while writing JamesBond:

Your screen is too big.

I'm afraid you're limited to about 640x512, otherwise at a certain point down
the screen almost none of the Amos gfx commands will work. (as you have found)

The only alternative is, I know the Turbo extentions F 16proc Icon command
will work on a screen that big, I have no idea about bobs though, prehaps the
PBOB extention'll work?


> 3) How can I store the map data in a file and read it in later?

easy, first you write a level editor, then do this:

'sx - x size of map
'sy - y size of map

Dim MAP(sx,sy)


------------ level editor bit goes here ----


sav: Rem suproutine for saving.
open out 1,FILENAME$
For x=0 to sx
for y=0 to sy
Print #1,map(x,y)
next
next
close 1
return

lod: Rem suproutine for loading.
open in 1,FILENAME$
For x=0 to sx
for y=0 to sy
input #1,map(x,y)
next
next
close 1
return

then just use the 'lod' subroutine ingame.

So how would I do what I want to do then? Say, have a map the same

stick to lowres. Consequently, instead of using Screen Offset, I'd
have to use something else. Has anyone got any formulae, ideas, CODE?

Well, I have a FAST infinite map scrolling routine (50fps on my amiga).
Unfortunatly it is too complex for even me to understand propperly, so it's
really no use any anyone I'm afraid. (Not even me ;(

I can send it to you anyway though, but you have been warned. ;)


By the way, apparently TOME is no good I'm afriad.

I guess you'll just have to reduce the map a little?

Turbo is free, off the Amos factory homepage.

Well, the inetd would then launch your program, and pass the other person's

Right. I've used a text editor (BED) to create my map file, which
looks like this (or part of it does anyway ;)

11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111

11122222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222111

etc. etc. Now, when I try and load that in using the routine above, I
get "Input too long at line xx". Now I'm guessing that AMOS is
attempting to read the ENTIRE line into the variable. Is there a way
of making it retrieve the first character in the line, and then the
next, and then the next and so on and so on.

I REALLY do not want my map files to look like this

1
1
1
1
1
1
etc. etc. ;)

Yuch, there has to be a better way? Anyway, wouldn't the other persons TCP
request just bomb out with a timeout error? Or would it work?

Also, could I get it to lanch the Echo command and have it print the details to
ram and have my program pick them up?

you could load them as strings, but you'd have to set Bed to save as LF+CR or
AMOS won't accept it.

That would be one way of doing it

Well, if you have a map editor then it wouldn't matter what the save format
was like.... (Once you have a map editor you can develope a compressed format
etc.)

What's up with AmosNG?

Mon Aug 9, 1999 7:52 pm
"Sasu Lintula" <samali@utu.fi>


Hi all,

just have to tell you that the Pinball Construction Kit ([pre-]beta) is finally
seeing light:D It's going to be so good that I'm trying to $ell it somewhere -
actually never thought that it could work at all:P

There's an one 'little' problem - Aga-support; At the mo PCK uses 32-colours
which is essential for speed and reasonable memory usage, but I have to update
it (at least later) to use Agas 256 colours. One possibility is to rewrite PCK
to Blitz but I really don't want to do that 'cause I've used mainly Amal - it
would be pain:((( The best solution should be the AmosNG but nothing has
happened for ages, or has it? So, what's up with it, Pietro (are you on this
list anymore?)? Peter, where's your Aga-extension?
I really want to stick with amos but it seems that there's no other way:( - hope
you see my point...

There's other thing; I need more beta-testers with different configs. At the
moment there are only Andy (H), Christopher and Palle who has promised to help
me out:|

I don't want it to actually run the program if someone wants to connect
though, that would be very annoying if you didn't want to have a game,

I just want it to tell the program, when the program is on the title screen, so
that it can open a connection then.

See ya.

Searching for Niall.. :)

Heyas,
Has anyone got a copy of Niall? I remember I had it on a coverdisk, but I
seem
to have lost it :)

It's a AI Eliza'ish program, but it acually learns words as you give it
sentances.

Cheers :)

Hello.

This is just a quick message to let you all know that the king
(me dammit, not Elvis!!!) is alive. LOL

So, what ever happened to CBATNAM?!
My Amiga is packed in a box back in Pennsylvania (I am now
living in Missouri) so I cannot do much to help but I am quite
sure I have the .lha archive for my stage! Thinking about
putting it on my website.

What about the rest of you guys? Hell, at least if we did
that people could enjoy the work we putinto this thing!!

A couple of years ago I was writing a game that used mapdata and I found a
way to store the map as hex in a file. the map[ can be up to any size you
want it (mine was 512x512) and took up one meg of hard disk space so if
this interest you can you please send me a message and I'll send to code
with an explanation of how to use it to you.

Even worse :). It want to load your whole file in the variable.
AMOS usually uses 2 characters to tell when the line end, but standard
Amiga texteditors use only 1. To use normal textfiles you got to tell
AMOS to use the normal Amiga textfiles standard:

Set Input 10,-1

But you also got to do something about the fact it loads the complete line.
(And I think you switched the X and Y too... The horizontal lines in the
texteditor
are vertical lines in your program?)
The best way is to do:

Set Input 10,-1
Open In 1,FILENAME$
For Y=0 To SY
Line Input #1,MYLINE$
For X=0 To SX
MAP(X,Y)=MID$(MYLINE$,X,1)
Next X
Next Y

I havn't tested it but it should work :).

Yeah, a real good point. Current state of it: Levels (mostly) complete,
combined code debugging and strapping together under way(cough), and the
sound is dead wierd - but I think with CD-sound it'll be problem solved.

The game will be available on CD, or as a massive download as soon as
possible, but with the current state of my stuff, it seems to be one delay
after another. Maybe I should get amos installed on the emulator (cough).

Giark, if you are listening, any high-quality sampled sound (don't care what
format, as long as I can read it) and to any other members, if there is
anything outstanding, SEND IT to me, and we'll drag it out. This has been
too long a time waiting and would be nice to finally see it in one go.

In the mean time, the more you pester me to get it put together, the more
likley it becomes, and the more submissions (you know who you are) the more
likley it becomes. A *LOT* of work has gone into it already, it would be
nice to see things in the final finished form.

I will dig up the traces on the various machines they inhabit and
re-assemble things as soon as I have a chance. Why is it I get bored, but
still have a hundred things to do ?

The CD case is already designed though....

..etc.

I still have all the data that was sent to me. I think you have it as well.
Whatever happened to all the artists that were doing pics? One after another,
they volunteer, then disappear.

I had a system of intro setup thing sort of kind of like, but my artist
disappeared. It was a cool intro, too.

>Giark, if you are listening, any high-quality sampled sound (don't care what

Like what? I thought we had all the sound covered. BTW, my intro was a
complete Cap'n bubba intro story, shown on a tv screen with cool japanime
effects. Damn artists! Get back here!

This would create a file consisting of ascii-strings seperated by linefeeds.
A bit unprofessional, I would say.

Better to use:

'sx:size-x ; sy:size-y
dim map(SX-1,SY-1)

' (editor here)
End

sav:
open out 1,filename$
sprint 1,varptr(map(0,0)) to varptr(map(0,0))+sy*sx*4
close 1
return

lod:
open in 1,filename$
sload 1 to varptr(map(0,0)),sy*sx*4
close 1
return

Which creates a raw file containg sy*sx longwords.

Take a look at an A500.

Ask the A500 to show a VBl-timed animation syncronized to some sampled music.
Then ask the PeeCee to do the same.

The A500 would win.

The funny thing is, that if you /do/ have an FPU then double precision is much
faster than single precision (see, AMOS single doesn't use the FPU at all)
Just a little optimizing tip :)

hope you see my point...

My extension did RTG too, but I canceled it cos noone liked GMS, and the
entire extension was based on it. There was a pre beta out, it only did
basic pixel handling, iff loading, p61 support and a few other bits.
Before it was out I did have bobs working, but I had a new, better
design for how it should handle them, so I removed my old bob code
and started to code the new ideas I had for the bobs, that was when it
was canceled, so the pre-release beta never did do bobs. But it fully
did AGa on all of its commands, and they were all much faster than
the amos equivilents(like much much much faster :). After the prebeta
I pretty much stopped it altogeather cos of all of the GMS moans,
I remember adding c2ps into it, they used EBH and got 47.3fps. on
my 030. But I never released them.

As for pietro, I think his amiga has died completely. I remember
he was having trouble with it a few months ago. If you like, Ill contact
the other members of the Amos NG group to find out about it ?

Also, (if it is really going to happen) how portable is it? Any chance of a

That's what Pietro Ghizzoni told me in a message about amos..

I'm looking for the amos pro compiler, can anyone send it to me (I also
understand that it also updates AMOS Pro 1.12 to AMOS Pro 2.00) and last,
but not lease, does anyone know of an online version of the AMOS Pro manual?
I lost mine in a move..

Other that that, can anyone recommend any essential extensions..

BTW - James Bond rocks.. even on my PII 333 ;-)

I dont want to shatter your expectations, but I honestly doubt a
release this september. That couldnt have been last september cos
the sources wernt even released then.

True, but also dont forget Jama3d, although its probably 3d only (some
part of the name sort of suggested that to me :). It claims to have
linux & MaC ports planned.

If it is going to happen, it will be quite portable. Of course,
most of the compiler, and gfx/sfx handling routines probably wont be.

That's why AmigaOS file notification would be useful
here:

1:Your program asks the OS to be notified when a file
(say ENV:mynotifyfile) is modified.

2:InetD (or whatever) starts a program that modifies
the file.

3:The OS sends a message to your program telling it
the
file has been changed.

(3) only happens if you did (1) before (2) happens.


(File notification is part of AmigaOS 2.04+ I think)

F1 Software

"Andy \"Mushroom\" Kellett" <mushypd@redrose.net>


For those of you who haven't heard just yet, I purchased F1 Software, 5th
Dimension licenseware, and all of Phil's other Amiga pieces and copyrights
whilst I was in the last stages of my trip to England.

Later on today, I will be releasing a large(ish) press release regarding
the whole matter, so you can read about a lot more stuff there. The URL
will be http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/f1purchase.html for those
interested, it should be up later today.

Over the course of the next few weeks, I would like to introduce a lot more
software into the library, and that's why im mailing here first. All of my
current best-selling titles have been written in AMOS, and are currently
making their programmers a lot of money. I know that there are a lot of you
here on the list writing new games, utilities and internet app's, and if
some of you are interested in making a lot of royalties from your work,
then email me and talk to me. I would like to see a working version of your
program. I strongly beleive in AMOS as most of you know, and would still
like to see a lot of good quality games written in it.

If anyone has any questions or queriers, feel free to email me at
mushypd@redrose.net. If you know anyone interested in getting their work
published who isn't on this list, then forward this mail to them. Thanks.

That's all well and good, and I tahnk you for the suggestion, but
unfortunately SPrint and SLoad don't tokenise. Is it part of an
extension? Don't say AMCAF please, because I have that installed!
A file of ASCII's would be unprofessional yes, and I have no idea how

SLoad and SSave (sprint doesn't exist!) are normal AMOSPro commands.

Actually, SLoad and SSave are part of the music extension. The 'S'
was for Sample, to use for double buffered sample playing, but they
are very handy for many other things, too.

Hi All,
Eric here (old wrinkly). Regards to splitting files on the PC with
"FSplit" I have done this, as I was sent Imagine and couldn't fit it on
floppies. It split the file okay and had imagine.ca1 - .ca4 and
imagine.fsi. I could not find the append command in WB 3 or 2, so I was
unable to use the files. I did try the "Join" command and although it
joined the files to one, it would not run. Firstly, where is the append
command to be had and secondly, what am I doing wrong.
Thanks.

What do you mean it wouldn't run? What error message did Lha give?

Also, if in doubt, download MUIJoin or simmilar from aminet and use that :)

Amos with comms example/program!

Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>


To whoever asked about amos and comms,

Can't remember but someone wanted info about using Amos with a modem.
Don't know if the persons question was answered but heres a program
I wrote a few years ago for when Sysops have to repair their BBSes
and need a message system setup.

The colours don't show because at the time I didn't realise how to show
them but now I know.

Hope this is of some use or whatever...

Hi Keith
On the 14-Aug-99 you said something about [amos-list] Question so now I am going
to offer a witty retort (well maybe :)

> Anyone know anything about the Commodore 64 Internet machine I saw on QVC
> the other night ?

The C64 WebIT? Its not COmmodore I don't think, they just used C64 so people
could associate with it. I think its a 64-bit (no shit) machine, with full
net capabilities. But, like most 8-bit systems of old, it relies on
interrupts for sound (j/k) :)

> All I know is that it exists.

Yea, and at a hefty price as welll!

Oh dear, I'm sorry. I obviously shouldn't rely on my memory anymore (too
many drugs in the 60's!). 'Join' is what I was thinking of, I dont know why
I thought it was append.
I have done this operation successfully. I used Split on the PC. Make sure
that you join the files in the correct order. The command template is Join
fileA fileB AS fileC. Note no commas between file names. Are you sure of
the final file name?

The memory loss is probably triggered by word association problems like
Join/Joint and Split/Spliff. Oh dear back to the Camberwell Carrots again.

You can use a regular C64 on the internet via a shell account. A couple of

You might have downloaded it on the pc in ascii format.
PC browsers don't know lha and lzx and might try to download them as text.
They also convert those textfiles to pc format so all chr$($A) characters
will be changed into chr$($A)+chr$($D) ;)).
Try FixLHA which is on Aminet which reverses that effect.
Then it should work.

Yes... there is a easier way. You're considering the problem form the wrong
point of view.

It seems that several peoples are interested in internet gaming, but the ideas
are a bit confused ;)

Make your game acts like a server is not the best solution, mainly for one
reason:

If i want to play with you, i need to know if you are on-line and mainly
your IP address. HOW????? Maybe:

Using ICQ or IRC i can obtain your IP, but it's boring.... a solution is to
obtain a 24h on-line dedicated server wich share your IP address to all the
connected players ( ... like the ICQ servers does when you're connected ) but
not everyone is so lucky to own a server :)

The secret is to use the public available tecnologies... and in the above
case the solution is.... suspence....... IRC!

Several applications use the IRC method in order to solve problems like
this... you've not to consider IRC just like a users CHAT, but it's
dedicated for the applications too!!

There are several IRC servers around the world.. a good news since the
players can use a local connection. Now... how can i use IRC for the game?

Solution:

Your game will works as a small IRC client and not as server... you've to open a
connection with a IRC server, and create a dedicated Channel for your
game.. for example JBonds.

When the players join the channel, your program will be informed, and you (..
your program) are able to play (chat) with all the players or just some of them.

For the protocol to use, you can be inspired by the other internet protocols
like HTTP,FTP,IRC an so on. Just use simple ASCII commands... for example if you
want to move a player you can send a command (message) like this:

MOVE James,50,90

when the program receive the above msg it moves the player James to the map
coordinates 50,90.

Using IRC you can send the message to all the players connected at the
JBonds channel, or just one of them so your're able to setup a complete
enviroment.

I've not tried your game, and so i don't know what it does exactly.. anyway
you've just to create a command for every possible action of your game...
like:

move,kill,fire,escape and so on...

and send them trough the IRC channel to the other players.

That's all folks!

Oh yuck. That's all the Internet needs, more excessively verbose
protocols. It's not very Amiga either, to use 16 (plus IRC protocol)
bytes when 3 will do. You have replaced a simple Internet port
programming problem with a complex "first write an IRC client, then
write your protocol on top" problem.

Inetd is designed to listen on certain ports, and start a new instance
of a particular server proggy for each incoming connection. Since your
proggy still needs to do everything except listening for a connection,
you are probably better off simplifying things by just adding the
"listen for a connection" part yourself.

I can't solve this particular problem for you though, I don't even have
AMOS Internet extensions.

Oh, and do us all a favour, design a compact protocol that uses all 8
bits of the bandwidth, rather than having every 8th bit wasted. It's
well overdue that the Internet changed to 8 bit protocols instead of 7
bit protocols and all the encoding that has to go on to cater for
sending 8 bit data through a 7 bit protocol working over an 8 bit link.
This sort of madness probably wastes about one quarter of all available
bandwidth just on un-needed overhead. All to cater for some ancient
systems that probably only exist in museums now.

Sorry about that, it's a pet peeve of mine. All the reasons for using
innefficient protocols on the Internet went away a long time ago, and
most of then probably didn't exist when the bulk of protocols where
designed.

...But, wouldn't that be rather slow? And what if people joined in the chat
thing and started mucking about with it?

Also, that method just would not be practical at all in an action game, I'd
have to be able to send and recieve binary, you can't do that with IRC could
you?

That would be a good way of starting a game automatically, but it would just
not work for the actual game.

Well, it's a good idea but unfortunatly not practical for a game like James
Bond :( it'd work for a statergy game, but not an action game :(

I couldn't see how InetD would listen for ports, and how amos'd connect to
em. And the current GUI extention has no 'listen for a connection' feature as
far as I can see.

Wouldn't a direct TCP connection be 8 bit?



So, Pietro, how about doing a 'open listening port' command for the gui
extention ? plleeeaaaassseeeee :)

See ya.

Yeah, make it return a value in Gui Wait or something if a connection on a

Ok... you're right! I know the problem but.... i've just solved *ALL* the
problems in the *most easy to use solution* for all the AMOS coders.

Problem... i'm on-line, and i want to play with you, but i don't know
if you're on-line and your IP address.. how can i open a connection with
your port???.... and the "simple internet port programming" is simple only if
you know how it works ;)

I belive again in the IRC solution because:

- you don't need any specific inetd/sockets knowledge (probably only the 2%
of the users on the list has some real knowledge about it) so everyone can
use it.

- the IRC protocol is VERY simple to use

- you don't need to code a FULL IRC client.. just the essentials are
needed. There is a AmosIRC client example already done in the GUI Extension
archive.

Sure... it's not the best professional way... but it is a /valid and/
/working solution!/ About the protocol format.. i agree with your point of
you.. obviously the format can (must!) be reduced. See below...

Not a problem... take the .fd file of the bsdsocket.library and the FD
Extension builder.... in few seconds you'll obtain a ready to use
extension with all the bsd functions inside!

Hey... it's just a stupid example to explain easly the situation.

You can reduce the 16 bytes to just 3 byets.. example:

the MOVE command can be just the letter M...

the coordinates 50 and 90 can be their ASCII equivalent.. the chr$(50) is
the char 2 and the chr$(90) is the letter Z so:

M2Z (3 bytes!)

can be interpreted as MOVE 50,90

there are even better solutions.... this is just a hint.

I agree. My examples was so expanded in order to explain better the idea.
Is up to the coder to optimize and setup the protocol.

First, you must decide which port you want to use for your game, for example
234. Now, you make an entry in inetd, for port 234, that will launch your
program and send the parameter that contains the incoming port data, for
example:

jamesbond %p (I'm not sure of the format for the variable)

in your program, you do:

prt$=Command Line$

this reads a command line when your program starts, similar to vt ram:pic.iff
and prt$ would be "ram:pic.iff" (Try it, amos programs can be started with
command line parameters)

Tcp Open prt$

or whatever the syntax is.

So, when inetd gets a hit on port 234, it launches your program, passing the
info on what port to connect back to. Your program then starts up, connecting
to the user who is waiting on port 234.

Clear now?

Hi Everybody,

But what about speed? Syncronising 3 or 4 people over IRC isn't going to be
that fast is it? & wouldn't it slow down the entire IRC server, as they aren't
designed to handle untolled numbers of people sending multiple packets every
screen update...

But why not just use an IRC server as a game listings, showing everyone
that's online and then letting you connect to them?

But what about characters under 32 or over 128? Would these show up, or be
scrubbed by the irc server?

Anyway, I'm still pretty sure that using IRC will be too slow, as I think I'd
have to send about 15-20 packets between computers per update, but ok ok, I'll
give it a shot.

See ya.

No no no no, that really wouldn't work becuase:

I don't want the game loaded up JUST becuase someone's accessing that port on
your computer, that'd be silly as anyone could start JamesBond on your amiga
even if you really didn't want to.


Why not just do

Echo >RAM:tmp %p

and then where the program checks for a connection:

if exist("ram:tmp")
open in 1,"ram:tmp"

etc etc...


Although I still don't see how InetD is supposed to be set up, and having
people try to set it up on there own is asking a bit much I think...


Well, anyway, thanks for trying :)

See ya.

Ok people, does anyone know ANY way of logging onto the same server with both
AMOS and AmIRC? It's a bit hard testing the IRC solution when you can't see
what's happening :(

You use the services entries to set the port data up

protocol: tcp

Why else would someone be accessing port 234 (to stick with our example)?

For a net game where people link, somewhere there needs to be a server,
running all the time, to route the traffic. Only a direct link from 1 computer
to 1 computer, no other parties, can operate without a middle man. Someone
will have to be running a james bond hub. That's where inetd comes in.

Bitch at the miami guy for not having any docs. I've set up my own web servers
and pop3 (mail) servers, so it is not all that difficult.

I'd have to send about 15-20 packets between computers per update, but ok ok,
I'll give it a shot.

iRC will be WAY to slow!
It normally has a 3second lag!

But, Ive got a better idea :)
You could run it through the partyline in #amos!!!
(its on my new bot "Karma" in #amos)

once in the partyline, everything is taken off the irc servers,
and it is handled directly by the bot, which is running on a
damn fast server. It runs just like a mini irc server, appart
from theres no lag at all.

To use it, you will need to log on to irc as normal, you dont
need to join channels or anything, just dcc chat with the bot,
and when you are speaking to the bot, via dcc chat, it sends the
message to everyone else who is dcc chatting to it. You should
get a quite fast speed through it. It will definately be
faster than irc. At the moment, the partyline is fully
functional appart from atm, it doesnt let you upload
files onto it, cos I dont want people to fill my hd
with files :) But you wont need that unless your putting
a autoupdate jamesbond thing in it :)

I think checking out "amarquee.library" might be worth while,
It has server support. you would just need to do some lib calls,
and you prolly wont have much probs with it.

Http access w/ TCP commands.

Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

Ok, I don't suppose anyone would be kind enough to give me an example, using
the Gui extention, to read a text file from a website?

I've tried, but for some reason it just won't do it. I remember there being a
program that got the Aminet recent list, but I can't find it anywhere...

See ya.

Strange AMOS

Tue Aug 17, 1999 7:50 pm
Neil Ives <neil.ives@btinternet.com>


Hello, AMOS experts.
Can you shed any light on this please?
My Amos Pro has been behaving strangely lately. Often the Compiler screen
takes some (5) seconds to appear when called from the editor, also the
editor takes some time to quit, occasionaly blacking the screen for many
seconds. Just this week a strange AMOS style message has started to appear.
I'll try and reproduce it in ASCII text.

Any ideas?

Amos IRC program.

Tue Aug 17, 1999 9:31 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

Ok, I have a small request:

I have tried, and failed to adopt the AmosIRC program for use as a James Bond
netgaming forum. So, I'm asking very nicely if someone could try writing:

A Simple IRC program (simple as in so that /I/ can understand how it works
:), that runs asyncro. (the main loop needs to be constantly updated) and
finally, that uses the amos custom screen.

If you would write one, I'd be really really greatful.

I'll be a bit more specific:

A) Could it please only have a very simple interface using 1 or more AMOS
screens (I can integrate it into my own iface later;) where it sends and
recieves messages and the basic IRC commands.

b) Could it also be able to get a list of everyone on that channel and put it
into an array, on demand?

c) Could it be simply written with lots of REMS please? Contrary to popular
belief, I'm not an expert in programming :)


Anyway, any help I get will be very much aprechiated :)

See ya.

Here's the scene: You are happily surfing the net or playing quake online

James Bond jumps onto the screen, causing much annoyance.

AmiTCP btw.

Anyway, I managed to get it working, you forgot to tell me to add an entry in
'services' and then fiddle about with the cli command.

As I've go a program that outputs the command line its given to a file in ram,
but lo, I can't get it to output any kind of IP no. or anything.

And AMOS locks up when I try to do anything with the port...

Besides, I don't want to have to expect poor people to fiddle about in the
settings like that.

Quake can have a direct TCP connection between two computers, why not GUI TCP
commands?


See ya.

Only the server end. As in, one computer sets up inetd, the hub. Others just
connect to it. You wouldn't set up inetd for all users. Others would hit the
hub.

I don't know the parameter, but it will do it. I'm fiddling about with it
myself.

The one that is reported or the one you set up?

They wouldn't.

Now, let's try to get on the same page. I'm talking about a game with three or
more people logged in at once, as you originally stated. If you only want to
direct connect person a to berson b, that is dead simple. The irc example
would do fine. Or, for that matter, any kind of connection where you can get
the ip or domain or whatever of the person you want to connect to. Even just a
little window saying 'enter ip number to connect to'.

I think you still have to set up the port so your system will let it work, but
I may be wrong. Once you know the ip to connect to (both ends need to know the
other guys ip), you just instruct one guy to open the port (he would be like a
host) and the other connect to it (he would be the user). It's easy to set
that as a flag, then the host program would initiate all data transfers, the
user would respond. bingity bangity boo. I've done similar stuff with my
serial game "dungeon", using dialup instead of net connect, but the idea is
the same.

Ok, I've found what was causing probs with my first try:

1. 'TCP OPEN' seems to lock up if amos is in front ?!

2. Gui Event causes 'Amos to back' whenever its called.


I'm still having trouble with it though :(

But Tcp Open only works one way. There is no 'Tcp Listen(port)' type command.

IRC would be totally useless for ingame, as a) its slow and b) everyone would
get kicked off for flooding.

IRC is perfect for doing the pre-game forum though, for people to find each
other and start games etc. (Which is what I'm trying now... :)

Yeah, thats what I'm after but I really think there should be an easier way
then using InetD. Surely it can't be that hard to add a Tcp Listen(port) command
or whatever, can it?

Hi Everybody,

Ok, I've /almost /found what kept crashing my attempt at an IRC proggy:

1) Tcp Open seems to lock up if the Amos screen is in front. bug?

2) Gui Wait and Gui Event force amos to back, even when I a) really really
really don't want it to and b) even though I called Amos Lock. Any way of
stopping this or a way of catching incomming TCP stuff without it?

You wouldn't need it, maybe. We're getting too theoretical here. You're trying

Well, for just direct person to person, I don't think you'd need inetd. It
would take a bit of experimenting with the command. If you and I knew each
other's ip numbers and you did a tcp open port 1.1.1.1/234 (or whatever), then
I did the same, using your ip instead, I think they would hook up. Anyone
doing any experimenting with direct tcp connect yet?

Pietro? Possible to add a tcp wait command in there that doesn't rely on the

Sprite problem

Wed Aug 18, 1999 10:36 am

Hi,
Have anyone managed somehow to get all eight hardware sprites on screen at the
same time?
I have a pice of code using sprite numbers 0 to 7 but Amos only shows only one
sprite of each group (0/1,2/3,4/5,6/7). In the manual there's nothing of missing
pairs but all example code in manual folder are based only on four sprites.

You must make sure that your sprites have a maximum of 4 colours (2
bitmaps), otherwise the sprite system uses pairs of sprites to display any
more than 4 colours. Also, if you use hardware scrolling for left/right
then you can't use sprites 6 & 7 (this is a hardware limitation according
to the manual).

Cheers,
Steve.

Sounds like you're using 16 colour sprites, right?

If you use 16 colour sprites, they actually use 2 sprites. If you need 8, either
use 4 colour sprites, or use computed sprites (no. 8 onwads).

Or use bobs instead?

See ya.

Hi Everybody,

>:), that runs asyncro. (the main loop needs to be constantly updated) and
>finally, that uses the amos custom screen.

Ok, after that desperate plee for help, I managed to make one myself anyway.
(typical eh?).

The problem was trying to get the commands working when amos was in front,
which just didn't work. I solved this by using the intuition ext. to use a
pubscreen. As James Bond already supports pubscreen, using the current GUI
ext commands would work, but there'd be not custom screen mode option while
having a net game.

PS. Pietro, how about not forcing amos to back when calling Gui Event, and
please fix the TCP OPEN when amos is in front bug?

On the subject of net James Bond, I have almost finished the comms routine,
I've got it to save all the outgoing packets (thats from the host to the remote
copies). I've found that it uses around 100-200 bytes per frame. Say the game
was running at 15fps, that'd make the total outgoing bandwith around 18kbits,
which is quite a lot, but a fast connection between to 56kbit modems /should /be
ok. (not taking into consideration net lag etc.)

Using IRC for this game data would be impossible, because that is about 2-3k
of binary data every seccond, and IRC just isn't designed for this kind of
application.

PPS. Thanks for the idea Rev. Giark, but I already tried TCP open on someone
else, it just fails. It seems that the program has to open that port for
someone to connect to, and so far (hu-hum Pietro) there seems to be no command
that does this....


PPPS. Can someone send me a program that downloads a text file from a webpage
please, I can't work out how to :(


See ya.

Nope, my sprites have only one colour by this way:
spr0 - col 17
spr1 - col 19
spr2 - col 21
spr3 - col 23
spr4 - col 25
spr5 - col 27
spr6 - col 29

is that the actually colour the sprites are painted in?

If you're using 4 colour sprites, make sure that the images are *4* colours. (as
in drawn on a 4 colour screen).

Even if they only have 4 colours in them, if they are on a 16+ colour screen
then they count as 16 colour sprites.


The pallette for 4 colour sprites goes like this:

Sprite 0 &1

sprite colour 1 -> screen colour 17
sprite colour 2 -> screen colour 18
sprite colour 3 -> screen colour 19

sprite 2 & 3

1 - 21
2 - 22
3 - 23

sprite 4 & 5

1 - 25
2 - 26
3 - 27

sprite 6 & 7

1 - 29
2 - 30
3 - 31


See ya.

Eh. Sorry, that's not the way it works...
The hardware doesn't "count" the colours you use. So even if you only use a
few colours on a 32 colour screen the hardware assumes that you use all 32
colours.
To tell AMOS that your sprites are in only 4 colours you have to grab them
from a four colour screen.
The sprites will then use the folowing colours in the palette:

Sprite Colours
8+1 17-19
2+3 21-23
4+5 25-27
6+7 29-31

For some reason Europress thought it very clever to rename sprite 0 to sprite
8... So even though the hardware refers to the sprites as 0-7 then AMOS refers
to the hardware sprites as 1-8 where sprite 8 is reserved for the mouse
pointer when it is shown.

I think (I may be wrong) but that isn't the case:

Sprite 8 is the first computed sprite. The real sprite 0 is usually tied up with
the mouse pointer. To free it up, call 'Hide On' to free it up.

Very interesting ! As Megadrive/Genesis' joypads are now hard to find,
Playstation ones are everywhere !
And most of time stronger and easier to handle.

Please can you tell us when this guy will achieve his wiring ?

Thanx.

Server Connection

Thu Aug 19, 1999 11:15 am
Pietro Ghizzoni <ghizzo@agonet.it>


Hi!

Ok eagers :) do you want play with sockets and servers... voila'! I've created
for you the AMOS BSDSocket.library survival kit :))

Included:

- a FD Extension with all the bsdsocket.library functions
- the .fd file of the bsdsocket.library
- the Sockets doc
- a set of Amos procedures for a easy access to the functions

In the future i'll integrate all the functions of these procedures in the
GUI Extension... now i'm working for the Pianeta Amiga fair, and i've not
enough time to do it.

First you need to install the extension... it's the number 25. If you already
use a FD extension, or you've another extension in the slot 25 i suggest you to
run the FD Extension builder and create your version. In the archive there is
the .fd file and the ASCII version of the procedures, too.


*You need the EasyLife and GUI extension too.*

Now you're ready to use the procedures. They are very easy, and offers all
the necessary functions for open a connection,send and receive datas, and
obviously the possbility to open the famous listening port :)

Since the "open listening port" is the request number one.... example:

SOCK_OPENSERVER[PORT] : PORTSOCK=Param

that's all!! :)

if the PORTSOCK param is ><-1 everything is fine, and your PORT is waiting
(listening) for connections.

In order to know is someone wants open a connection...

SOCK_SERVERCHECK[PORTSOCK] : ADR=Param

If there is a connection waiting, the ADR param is ><-1 and it's the socket
number associated to the remote system. Now you can chat with the other computer
using the SOCK_SEND and SOCK_READ procedures... or fuck it with a nice
SOCK_CLOSE :)

In the above case, if i want send 100 bytes of datas to the connected
computer....

SOCK_SEND[ADR,Start(10),100]

simple eh? The name of the procedures are self-explaning, and there are
some connents inside....

When you've finished remember to close all the opened sockets!

DAMN! It seams like you are right.
Where did I get the idea that you could't use sprite 0???
(I even tested it before I wrote the letter - but apperently my test was not

Yep. Hardware sprites go from 0 to 7.

Hi Everone, Old Wrinkly here again.
A while back I asked
about a Hard Drive off a PC fitting the Amiga.
Now I want to know, will the external Floppy Drive I now use on my Amiga,
run on a PC.?.
May sound obvious to most, but I've got to ask. as it could save me a few
bob.
I want to couple my Amiga to the PC via a parnet lead and the PC I will use
has no Floppy Drive, I need this of course for the software.
I'd also like to enquire again, "Does anyone know where I can get Cinema 4D"
Thanks A Lot

I know a while back there was a link on Dave's Video Game Classics that had a
link for a site that had schematics for hooking up N64, PSX, NES and other types
of controllers to a serial/game port on a PC. Maybe this can help you out. If

Nope, there's no where to plug it in on a PC. Seeing as the drive probably
isn't a high density drive, there wouldn't be much point anyway.

If your PC needs a new drive, just get some cheap replacement disk drive, you
can pick them up for peanuts nowerdays.

Yep, but if you need L<>R scrolling screens, just use Screen Display to

As far as I remember, you have to make sure you open a screen, and that
screen *has* to be screen 0, or else the compiler bombs.

Another reason for the compile bombing is when you compile a program with
the sample bank saved in it. You have to erase bank 5 before compiling,
and load it off the disk instead. Or you did when I was really into Amos
anyway. Hope this helps.

Also you can't store icon banks that has an odd length. They must be loaded

Not directly.
The amiga floppy drives are modified pc floppy drives, so if you
were to get a soldering iron at the floppydrive you could do it,
but it would stop the drive from working on your amiga and theres
quite a few things you would need to hack at.

Id advise you just to buy a pc floppy drive.

On my pc, I baught my floppy drive for IR£11 in a shop. Thats about
£8.50 sterling. Of course that drive is a HD drive also...

One way would be to upload the software from one computer onto
a FTP site somewhere or somewhere on the internet, then plug
your modem into the other one, and download on it, then you could
set up your parnet then, and you wouldnt need to repeat that.

> I'd also like to enquire again, "Does anyone know where I can get Cinema 4D"

I have it, somewhere on a cd. It was on a AFcd years ago.
Maybe by trying to get a backissue of af you could get it ?

bits & Bobs

Fri Aug 20, 1999 2:24 pm
roger buckley <rogerbu@callnetuk.com>


Hi,

I'm currently trying to convert an old Mike Singleton(Lords Of Midnight &
Doomdark's Revenge) designed game to the Amiga. The two previous version
were written for the Speccy & the BBC. I have a problem with the bobs.
Ineed a set of 5 bobs, no problem, but 8 colour sets of the bobs. Is there
an easier way than having forty bobs, of changing the colour. They are all
two colour and I don't fancy using paint and having 40 sets of co-ordinates
cluttering up the place.

I may also have the old copyright problem again. The programme was published
as a type in prog in C&VG Yearbook(god only knows which year) and no
programmers' names are quoted in the article, only the designer.

Kind regards

Cinema4D was on CUCD27, the very last one they issued but they made a balls
of it and the installer doesn't work and you need a registration code from
Hisoft which they are now refusing to give out. However the code is the
same for everyone. The correct installer is on an AFCD33, December 1998,
Issue 117. They also give you Hisoft's number but don't bother as they
won't give you the code. I believe that Hisoft are still selling a later
edition of 4D but I've no idea of prices. Suggest you contact their web
site.

(Off-Topic) Mobile fone for sale!

Sat Aug 21, 1999 12:59 am
Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>


[*UK Mainland ONLY*]

Dear all!

Sorry this isn't really to do with the mailing list but i'm putting my
mobile phone up for sale so if anyone is interested then read
below;

Vodafone - 'Pay as you talk' for sale!

Ericsson GA628 digital phone connected to the Vodafone digital network
for the BEST in clear sound quality.

£5.00 built in calling credit with roughly 165 days service credit, ie
you won't have to top-up for at least 165 days if you don't want to!

The phone comes with belt clip, two front covers, the original one and
an extra wacky yellow one worth £4.99. Slim battery as standard
with recharger, only 1hr for full charge. All with original boxes and
manuals hardly ever toutched.

With the Pay as you talk service you only buy credit when you need
to, you don't have to be 18, you can be under 18 and there are no
contracts and no monthly bills. You do not get charged any standing
charge each month and no phone bill.

All you do is buy top up cards from most shops, news agents or
most retailers and phone a number and enter a simple code, you
then will have the value you paid on your phone ready to use.
A simple toutch of a button will tell you your credit balance and
how many days you have left.

Digital phones are state of the art, you can phone people with
perfect quality, to land lines or other mobiles, you can even
phone over-seas with excellent quality (I phoned Canada with
little loss of quality) - Quick charging batteries that you can
even use the phone while charging.

Mobile number is : 07887 664 915

You can send SMS messages to and from your phone because
it is digital. Many different ring tones, including normal rings
and other tunes.

Attached is a front view of the phone. Note, it does not come
with the blue front but with the original black vodafone one and
an extra wacky yellow one worth £4.99.

Don't forget you get £5.00 of calling credit built in so you
are ready to make calls and also if you bought this phone
new you would not get the 160+ days service credit and the
extra yellow front cover.

Interested? email me,

amiga@thefree.net

Toodle Pip!

I dont think Im talking about that version, Ive got
Cinema4D on a AF cd, it installed 100%, and I didnt need any
reg codes, it worked perfectly for me. I think I have Cinema4d 2.

Why use the party line through IRC, ie eggdrop or type bots who
use partyline when you could basically run a server through
the shell itself?

A shell access is 24 hours so it'd be more simple to run a 24/7
server offa your shell then IRC access is not needed, your
shell could reroute all the data with a permanent server ip.

Taking andrews data, sent to your server on your shell then
your shell sends it off to whoever is playing. You wouldn't
even need to access IRC if you set up a list to beable to be
accessed of who is on.

You'll obviously need to program a Linux program to do this
but it cuts out IRC.

JamesBond net play results....

Sun Aug 22, 1999 12:42 am
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

Ok, I am pleased to say that my netplay version of JamesBond worked!

What it didn't do was play nearly fast enough. It seemed that most the data
packets just went straight out the window, resulting it about a 1/2 fps frame
rate on the client machine :(

I'm using the procedures donated by Pietro, but I think they may not work
well because I converted my working irc proggy to them and it stopped
working....


The other posibility, is, I'm simply trying to send too much through the
internet:

The server needs to send about 400-500 bytes to each client every seccond to
play at an acceptable rate. This equates to around 3.6kbits per seccond, which
considering most modems are 56kbits shouldn't be a problem, but, who knows?

PS. The macine that was acting as a server in my tests had a super fast cable
modem, I only ran one client and the ping to them was 200ms, Which is (should)
be good speed.



So, anyone got any idea why its so slow? Would the gui ext V2's tcp commands
do a better job Pietro? Or I'm I just expecting too much from the internet?


BTW. Pietro, would it be possible to make a command that sent the same TCP
packet to more then one user? That'd reduce the network load 3 fold with a
4player game :) (if that is possible with tcp...)

See ya.

What, that presses them for you? You can't make amos press keys (unless you
poke into the keyboard buffer?).

If you want it to reset, use an extention that has a reset command (like
craft)

> How can I upload to Aminet ?

Read the aminet readme's, they explain all.

> Where on Internet can I find the best sites for download AMOS source files

The amos factory:

You won't want any of mine, they break just about every rule of good
programming :)

What do you mean download the amos-list? Do you mean recieve messages from

YES. Not many of us I admit but after years of Speccy Basic I found that
Amos was the kind of versatile language that suits my 'spaghetti
programming'. I tend to use trial and error in preference to flow charts,
bad form I know, but Amos shows up my mistakes without trashing everything
and as the stuff I write tends to be static I don't need the lighning speed
of assembler, C or Blitz and I'm far to old to change my methods now. All
my grandsons want is a program that responds accurately to their imput and
IMO Amos gives programmes that stability.

Ok, you can't promote amos screens in any way, let alone to a gfx card.

What you can do, is get an extention like the Intuition extention that can open
a gfx card screen and copy an amos screen to it.

This copying has to be done every frame, so it drops the frame rate a little,
but it is currently the only way of having a real amos custom screen on a gfx
card.

It does work, you can see my JamesBond game for proof :)

See ya.

Very true, esp. if you want to distribute your Amos Prog to

other people's machines, well trashinh all the banks and loading them

Crashing IFF anim...

Tue Aug 24, 1999 3:38 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

I've recently been playing with Lightwave, and have produced a most excellent
animated logo :)

I converted it to a ham6 320x480 IFF anim, so that AMOS could play it.

After writing a quick testing routine to see how fast it would play back. It
started playing nice and fast, but then suddenly as soon as the lensflare came
into view, the screen trashed quite spectacually and crashed.

I guessed that the frame was too big, so I reserved a massive amount of memory,
but it still happened.

I then reduced the anim to 320x240, but again the screen got trashed just after
the lensflare and for about 15 frames after that, but then returned to normal.

After a bit of messing around I found that any frame over about 42k just
wouldn't render. I finally had to cut the anim down to 320x200, which finally
got it running.


I'd really like to have it in 320x480, because it looked much nicer. So, is
there any way of getting large anims to work in amos, or an extention that has
support for a different format? (I really don't want to have to use an external
program to play them...)

See ya.

Yes. Now you can copy from/to a GUI Screen to AMOS and viceversa.


P.S* I need a quick reply!* The old commodore monitor *1940* is able to display

I got an email from a bloke called Steve and his email follows. It
seems a shame to waste all the work that was done, so if anyone
was interested in helping him out then maybe you should contact
him at the address given. I personally have not heard of the
game, and really don't have time to work on it. I'm sure someone
could tho ;)

*** Forwarded message, originally written by Steve Bovis on 23-Aug-99 ***

HI,
I see by your web site that you like point & click adventures, I
ask this because about 5 years ago I created a game using AMOS PRO that
was nearly published by Grandslam Interactive , it was shown at Earls
Court at the 96 Ects show, we had every magazine looking and doing a
work in progress on the game. We had a CD32 magazine cover CD disk and
an 8 page spread on the game. Alas Grandslam pulled out when the Amiga
game scene started to crumble and the project got shelved!

Now nearly 5 years on from its creation do you think it is worth
publishing? Would you be interested in finishing the Amos Pro codeing
with me?

Oh by the way the game was called LIMBO of the LOST.

The guy I usually work with (Gaz Hoyles) cant be reached ATM, and I was
looking for someone who could design me a really awesome disklabel graphic.
I want to stick with the F1 Car theme, and am looking for someone to draw
me a really realistic F1 car, prefereably like a williams renault that
damon hill used to drive, but im pretty open. Ideal angle is facing
front-forward, with the front to the left at about 40 degrees so you can
see the side of the car too. Im not fussed about the fancy stickers that
they had for advertisers, but feel free to put on what you want. If you
think you can help me, please let me know. Thanks.

Transparent Screen Copying

Fri Aug 27, 1999 6:53 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

I want to be able to copy one screen onto another so that all of colour 0 is
transparent, and shows through the destination screen's gfx.


So far, the only way I've been able to do this is by picking the whole screen
up as a bob and pasting it back down.


This isn't a very good method however, so is there a better way of doing it?

See ya.

I made a routing that does it.
I don't don't know if it's faster than getting a bob and pasting it.
I guess it is.
In all cases it usesless temp memory (it uses the memery of onebitplane, that
is 10k in 320*256)
The routine expects the source and dest screen to be of the same size (not
same number of colours, though)
You have to give it a number of a temp-bank it can use for the mask. And set a
flag: True if the bank is to be reserved and erased; False if it is already
reserved.

By the way, during the test I found a(nother) bug in the AP-compiler:
Min() doesn't work with floats.
Try to compile
Print Min(6.0,4.0)
(Result 6, should be 4)

Well, here it is. Only tested a little, but it appears to work.
(Copy 16 colour 320*256 to 16 colour 320*256 takes 5 vblanks on '060 after
compilation):

Well, I gave it a go and it does work, quite well infact, but it is slower
then the picking up bob method, the loading time increases by a few secconds.
(it doesn't seem like much, but it all adds up, and whatabout people with less
then an 040?)

I was thinking, could you do two procedures, one that creates and saves the
mask, and then another one that loads the mask and uses it?
That should speed it up a bit :)


Anyway, thanks for helping ;)

Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>


Dear All,

Does anyone have the original of a point and click adventure similar
to Monkey Islands called *Willy Beamish* by Sierra?

I can't remember when it was released but probably some time
between 1991-1994.

I'm only looking to buy the original so if anyone has it and is willing
to sell it please contact me.

Toodle Pip!

Hi Sasa,

I've tried your ball routines and they seem to work quickly and bug free
on my computer. I have an Amiga 1200 4mb Fast/2mb Chip 68020 w/ 1.6Gig
HDD. I guess the best place to look at my work is by going to...
http://www.space.net.au/~geosync/tainment/scrnst5.htm
..And...
http://www.space.net.au/~geosync/digiart/page1.htm
(just dont go to the index on this last site..it's been overwritten!!!)

That should be no problem.

call CT_MAKEMASK[SRC,TMPBNK] to reserve TMPBNK and create a mask in it.

call CT_COPY[SRC,DST,TMPBNK] to do the copy-operation. If TMPBNK is reserved
then it is used as a mask. If it is not reserved then CT_MAKEMASK is called -
and afterwards TMPBNK is erased again.

That is: If you are to make a single copy then just call CT_COPY with an
unused bank.
If you are to do several copies then first call CT_MAKEMASK. Then call CT_COPY
the acquired number of times. Then erase the tempbank.

Without the mask making 16 colour 320*256 to ditto now only takes 3.2
PAL-vbl's on '060.
(With mask making it takes 4.6 vbl's)

thanks :) The routine is about as fast now, but almost certainly uses less
memory. Is it possible to make it faster though? I do have an 040, and I'm just
thinking as this requires lots of CPU power, what about lesser amiga's?

There doesn't seem to be anywhere we can make more efficency gains, as I
couldn't save the stenciled picture, I'd end up with 100's of different
combos...

Although, I was thinking, couldn't we use the blitter to cut the mask out of
the destination screen? I would've thought the blitter'd be good at doing that
kind of bitplane stuff?

See ya.

Hi everyone,
This is my first post to this list, so 'Hello!' once more :)
I was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of:
A) GRAC resources (except Andy Gibson's page
B) Gfx resources
C) Mods

I'm doing a game in the aforementioned program, and need some graphics
people to work on it. The game will be released via trogladite software
(http://www.trogsoft.f9.co.uk, or www.egroups.com/groups/tsoft).
If anyone feels like helping, then mail me :)
I already have one gfx guy, but haven't seen any work from him yet...

Internet gaming... (packet problems)

Sun Aug 29, 1999 6:15 pm
Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>


Hi Everybody,

After precious little success with getting JamesBond working on the internet,
I decided to do a little test.


I wrote a very simple program that sent the equivilent amount of data that JB
uses to its self, then sent it back and measured how they came in......



What I found was that packets seem to arive with intervals of a few secconds,
in a batch of about 20! (both the server and client program were running on my
A1200 asyncronously)



That meant that somewhere along the line, all my precious little data packets
were buffered together, then sent in one big batch a few secconds later...

Is there anyway I can stop this from happening? It kinda makes writing a real
time net game a little hard when it's packets are handled like this...


PS. Pietro, how's GUI v2 going? :)

See ya.

Yes.
But coding the blitter directly from withit AMOS is for some reason very
unstable (tried that, but some random blits will be done wrong).
And if you use AMOS' built in commandos to do it, you have to do some ugly
poking around in the screen base.
Well.
Been there, done that :)

I assume that Leek(Screen Base)=Logbase(0).
If that in some future AMOS will not be the case, then the program will
certainly crash. Use on your own risk.
On '060 it is actually a bit slower than the old program, but as all work is
done by the blitter then the speed should be the same on every Amiga. I guess
the new program will be faster on everything else than '060.
Replaced TMPBNK with TMPSCR.

Don't you think that the rest of the users on this list are getting tired of
strange AMOS-programs being posted here...? Perhaps we should continue this
off the list...?

Haven't you all got AMCAF? There's a command for masked screen copy operations,
I think...
It should be fast enough:)

That is part of my point, a direct TCP connection WILL be 8 bit, but the
majority of packets travelling through the Internet are for 7 bit
protocols, a lot of which are trying to send 8 bit data. What a waste
of bandwidth.

I gotta admit, I see this as a solved problem for me. I run the games
site for my local cable users, all that sort of information is
automatically added to my web pages by my bot. It all runs under Linux,
Apache, and PHP3 with a touch of Java. That won't help any of you guys
though. No, you can't see any of it, it's a private web site for
BigPond cable users only.

Last time I played with sprites (many many years ago) I thought they

bandwidth problems for sprites 6 & 7? Hmm, should check the hardware

Where you using TCP or UDP?, TCP gives you reliability of delivery, UDP

Ham mode could be your problem, it could be that the anim doesn't have

This is probably the TCP / UDP issue again. UDP, while not guaranteeing
delivery, will send the packet straight through, and is probably better
for real time stuff, but you should write your own packet loss protocol
on top of it. TCP has some intelligence behind it, and should guarantee
delivery, but not right now if it has to resend packets.

You really should get yourself a good book or something that explains
all this, so you can make the proper decision about how to do it.

I think the best way to do it for a real time game is to use absolute
coords and UDP. If a packet gets dropped, you don't care so much coz
the next one to get through will move you to the correct place anyway.

I disagree. I've been playing around with Anton Reinauer's UDP_Chat funcs for
Blitz2 (on Aminet) and they seem to be VERY reliable. I tried it with TCP, and
about 1/2 the packets got lost on the way from my modem to the remote computer

That is simply the difference between the design and the
implementation. TCP is DESIGNED to be more reliable than UDP, coz UDP
will only send the packet and forget about it according to the specs,
TCP is supposed to try to ensure delivery, it's an end to end stream.
UDP_Chat probably has a reliability layer on top of the UDP layer, and
it looks like it works better than whatever TCP layer you used.

I solved this problem by creating a simple IRC client to act as a 'forum' for
game users, where they can connect to each others games through it....

Eh:

I WROTE: "grab them from a four colour screen"
I DID NOT WRITE: "display them on a four colour screen"

Eh, yep, they are independant of screen depth, but that has nothing to do with
the depth of the screen from which they are /grabbed/ - only with the depth of
the screen on which they are /shown/...!

footer on AMOS-list

Mon Aug 30, 1999 9:23 pm
Rune Zedeler <rune@zedeler.dk>


ARGH!
I'm tired of base64-encoded messages not working on the AMOS-list.
The problem is that the footer:

--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------
blablablabla...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Official AMOS WWW: http://members.xoom.com/AmosFactory/front.html

is added to the bottom of all documents in raw ascii-format - even if the
document is base64-encoded. And my mailer gets confused - and displays nothing
but nonsense.

Isn't it possible to fix that damn bug...?

Hello All,
I am hoping someone can help me out with a problem I am having with a
small project I am working on. If anyone could help I would really
appreciate it.

Firstly I will explain exactly what my program does......It converts
onelist.com digest emails to amigaguide. My reason for doing this is to
submit a series of digest emails to Amiga Format for inclusion on their
cover CD
and amigaguide format is easier to handle and navigate through on any
amiga.

The problem : I can load a digest email that contains up to 19
messages and it gets processed with no problem and the resulting
amigaguide file works perfectly. It is only when I load a digest email
that contains 20 or more it all goes wrong. What I can determine is
that a negative value is returned during the processing of message link
number 3, which is incorrect and causes my program to fail and
return an error.

I have attached the ascii source code and a couple of digest emails.
One of the digest emails contains 19 messages and the other contains 25.

The following are the steps taken by my code......

The program prompts the user for a onelist.com digest email.
The number of messages in the chosen digest email is determined.
Unwanted text is removed from the digest email.
Message links are determined and added.
A header is added.
Message nodes are determined and added.
The resulting file is saved to disk.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Declan.

Not at all. I may not be in a position to use these program tips now but I

Unfortunately, it is not a bug but a feature of the list. Ads at the
bottom pay for the service so it is free. I see no way of turning it off.

Sad as it is to report, the Amos Mailing List Archive Search Site
died a tragic death of Hard Drive Failure a few weeks ago.
I would love the oppurtunity to re-work the site on another server.
I wrote it with Perl so it would most likely need a unix server, anybody
got access to one??
I kind of did it stupid style last time, a real brute force method
which I think contributed to the HD failure (it was accessing literally
10,000+ files per search, death on that old HD's motor.
I think it was a great service, used it several times myself and
would love to see it back up, but actually the delay in anyone mentioning
the fall of it makes me wonder if it was very widely used.

Just the oppurtunity to give something back years of help, hints and
fun would be worth it. :)

Ok, the problem with it is not the number of mails in the things, it's the
size of the source file: Changing the number of mails in the first file to 25+
doesn't break it, also deleting some of the mails on the other file fixes it.

It also crashes a heck of a lot. Although I couldn't find exactly what was
wrong, it's probably after a certain size source file overwrites the wrong part
of the memory, mucking the program up.

I'm afraid I can't find the prob, so I can only suggest that you should go
over the code carefully, and maybe re-design with a more stable search/replace
system...

See ya :)
