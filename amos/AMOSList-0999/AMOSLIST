Hello Andrew,
  Thanks for the response and your comments are noted.  I have to say that I
am not 100% behind you when you say that the size of the source file is the
problem, but I will investigate it further.  I have done numbers tests, one
of which led me to loading the email with 25 messages into a text editor and
without altering the email size and contents I just changed the text 'There
are 25 messages' to 'There are 19 messages'.  So although there was 25
emails, I was informing my program that there was only 19.

  So when I processed this new file, it did not report any problems and the
resulting amigaguide file was generated and worked.  Obviously only allowing
19 messages to be accessed but the size of the source file did not seem to
make any difference.  Strange?

  When you say it crashes a lot, at what points did it crash and did it
crash your Amiga, Amos or just the program itself?

  Am I wrong in assuming that if I reserve a portion of memory for use in
processing the file I should not have any problems.  Doesn't AmosPro
allocate a safe portion of memory?

  Thanks again for your help.

Declan.

   Oh, it still mucked up on mine... Hmmm.

   Ok, it didn't crash during the program, but after about 3 or 4 runs I go back to the editor and the thing crashes, so I can only presume there is a bug in there somewhere resulting in part of the memory being overwritten...

>  Am I wrong in assuming that if I reserve a portion of memory for use in

   Amos only allocates as much as you tell it, I always add a few k at the end of banks just incase, so you could try that...

Anyway, good luck :)

See ya :)

X-Status: 

From: roger buckley <rogerbu@callnetuk.com>

Hi,

My latest project is nearing completion but as the game can take a while to
play I thought a load/save option would be helpful. The data required to be
saved is only 368 bytes and I've put this data in an array but I can't seem
to save it. The load game option is on the opening screen with the save
being operative all through the game. Save and Load only seem to affect the
Banks and I'm not well up with that side of affairs. I simply need to save
the data as a file and load it again as required. Can anyone help?

Kind regards

Roger,
	A simple, if less than eloquant, approach is to dump the 
data to a text file, to this you use the Open, Input, and Print commands,
check the help files for the exact syntax but the general code should 
look something like this...

Save_Game:

Open In 1,FILE$  <- File is the name of the file you are saving to

For X=0 to Array_Length
	For Y=0 to Array_Height 
		For Z=0 to Array_Depth
		Etc. Depending on How many levels deep your array is...

	Print  1,Str$( Array(x,y,z....) )
	rem This will write array one line at a time into the text file FILE$

Next X : NExt Y : Next Z : etc....

Close 1 <- Don't forget this line (closes files, else get an unalidated
				disk error)

Load_Game:

Open In 1,FILE$  <- File is the name of the file you are saving to

For X=0 to Array_Length
	For Y=0 to Array_Height 
		For Z=0 to Array_Depth
		Etc. Depending on How many levels deep your array is...

	Junk$=Input$ 1   <- Grabs the next line of the file
	Array(x,y,z....)=Val(Junk$) 

Next X : NExt Y : Next Z : etc....

Anyway the code looks something like that, questions?  Ask Away!

	Thanks,

Both Garfield and yourself have come up with brilliant solutions. I've
converted the player's names to asci so they can be saved as well. Just got
some variables to sort out, altered due to the load/save option, but the
main headache has gone. Very many thanks to you both. You'll get a mention
if and when this goes on the AFCD:)

Software suppliers are trying to make their software packages more
'user-friendly'.... Their best approach, so far, has been to take all
the old brochures, and stamp the words, 'user-friendly' on the cover.

Subject: [amos-list] Changing the 'sensible' length of a string
Status: RO
X-Status: 

From: Declan Gorman <decg@gofree.indigo.ie>

Hello All,
  Page 14.A.05 of the AmosPro manual for the command Peek$,
string$=Peek$(address,length), states that Peek$ reads the maximum
number of characters specified in the length parameter, into a new
string.  If this is not a sensible length, the length is assumed to be
65500.

  I am loading a text file into a memory bank and trying to fill a
string with the contents of this bank.  If the length of the text file
is greater than the 'sensible' length I am in trouble.  So what I am
asking is can I change the 'sensible' length allowed or is this set at
the system level and unchangeable?

Thanks in advance.

Declan.

   As far as I know, there is no way of having a string over 64k in size. 

But, why do you need it in a string? Can't you just use peek/poke to use it from the memory bank?

See ya :)

Why don't you just fill the string in 'sensible' length blocks?

Hi Everyone,
                thanks to those who congratulated me on having my game
included on the AFCD, after sending it off I upgraded my Amiga with extra
fast RAM and found that the game run like the clappers so I assume it needs
to be run under (no fast mem). Thanks to everyone.

   I just got my copy of it this moring, well done :)

   Yep, on my 040 that's an understatement :)  You know, I've found a little way of controling the speed so it runs at the same speed on any amiga (just at a different jirkyness :)  If you like I'll dig out the example I did a while ago :) 

   Anyway, keep up the good work.


PS. Is it me, or has it been rather quiet round here lately? Has everyone finally reached AMOS nirvana?  :)

See ya :)

Hello Pietro,
  How did things go for you and AMOS at the Pianeta fair?  If there is
anything to report I am sure that everyone on the amos-list would be very
interested to hear about it, me included.

Declan.

It seems that there are a lot of troubles with AMOS viruses out there. If
anyone can help this guy, please do so.

*** Forwarded message, originally written by Alex van Niel on 21-Sep-99 ***

Hi Rune J. Keller,

I am the code of VirusCheckerII and for a while now we have been pestered
by Amos viruses that are not only annoying since they are viruses, but also
because they are so badly written it crashes the system hard. Now, I have
seen crashes cuased by viruses which were intended, these wer defintely
not. The problem however is that we have been encountering specific
problems and occurances with these viruses but couldn`t quite find out what
it was since most of the stuff is Amos language. Disassembling didn`t
really help and so the only way we could figure out Amos viruses work is by
merely testing them. 
If we however could decompile an Amos program, we could take a look inside
those viruses and write better and Amos friendly recogs. Now it happens too
ften that some recogs are either false or very weak (based on little
information or easily aletrable data)
Now here is my question: is there a decompiler for Amos programs and if so,
could you please point me in the direction of either the program or someone
who can help me on this subject. You would be preventing virus investation
in other peoples systems and therefore helping the Amiga community
immensely. If I would have to pay for this decompiler, I probably would,
but just let me know if, when, where and how I can come by this compiler.


Greetings,

    Alex van Niel

   Well, in theory a de-compiler would be possible, but in practice it would be near impossible due to the infinite combinations of different extentions / Amos versions. Also, what about shareware amos programs? With a decompiler anyone could go into it and remove the copy protection, basically pirating it with no effort at all!

   And, how would that help distinguish real amos programs with viruses? It would be impossible to tell a small amos progam from a trojan, and what if it mistook a real amos program for one? what would the author of that think?



   I think the best thing to do about amos viruses is to make the virus checker search for the ' amos' task, and if found say 'Warning! Amos program found, it /could/ be a rather badly written virus!!' and have it keep a record of all the known ones.
 

See ya :)

I'm impressed if someone really wrote a virus in amos.  Can you please send
me a copy of this ?  What sort of virus ?  A trojan most likely ?  Worm
perhaps ?   This I gotta see.

   The only type of virus I see could be written in amos is a trojan that deletes some important files etc.  Not really much of a virus

Please notice that the AMOS Virus-message was NOT written by me!

It's a letter I received from a Dutch anti-vira guy, which I agreed to forward
to the list.

If you want to know more about the thing, then please contact him personally
(his e-mail was in my first message).

If its compiled with GUI extension, the AMOS marker is deleted so infinite

   The only type of virus I see could be written in amos is a trojan that
deletes some important files etc.  Not really much of a virus

My thoughts exactly.  If someone has done something impressive though....
Highly unlikly.  Methinks it is a "media virus".

I've been away for a while because of the dreaded downfall. Yup, I got a real
job.

But, bonus fact, because of the job, I was able to put together my a1200
tower. A few more tinkering sessions and it will be a full on tower. Still
need extension cable for df0 and a front on/off switch.
 
Well met and godspeed,

I'd like to be able to use ICQ to contact fellow Amos'ers too.
I managed to get StrICQ to work alright this week apart from 
Mirabilis has altered the ICQ system so that you can't obtain
a new UIN with it, therefore I still haven't been able to use
the ICQ network yet. Any suggestions?

I always read this list although my own contributions are seldome;
experts here answer the questions admirably!

Hello Andrew

I'm still here reading the mails.

I'm feeling a lack of creative (AMOS) motivation lately. Also the afb-ot
mailing list is taking up a lot of my available Amiga time.

Glad that you are still finding time to be so creative Andrew.

The information was received from the authors of StrICQ when I found it didn't
work.
"mclaughd@kda.attmil.ne.jp", is another author contact isn't it?
Any other ways of getting onto ICQ with an Amiga?

G'day all
                 It's been a while since i have actually got
programming in amos again, and i was wondering if anybody could help
me in regards to getting amospro to work with aga or even (god forbid)
rtg.  I am starting to write a game and it would be so much better if
i could have 256 colour screens.  I have heard of a few aga extensions
for amos, but do they support bobs etc...???  Is there a simple, easy
extension that i can use to enable me to open and use 256 colour
screens??  What about amos in conjunction with cybergraphx?  Is that
possible, or is this stuff that will be included in the new version of
amos???

Any info would be most appreciated.

Regards

Rick Pezzimenti

   Well, I've got into using the Intuition Extention. It lets you open 256 aga/rtg screens. 

   It doesn't support bobs directly, but it can copy parts of amos screens and icons to the pub screen (unfortunatly only 64 colours though), and I've got it to draw a few 'bobs'.

   unfortunatly it doesn't support 24bit palette though.


> possible, or is this stuff that will be included in the new version of

   New version of amos? Yeah, we'd be lucky :)

See ya :)

Hi,

just letting you all know that Pinball CK developement continues after a little delay (I had to make a pc-cd rom for a finnish underground comic- strip mag, sigh). 

I have changed from Amos Classic to Pro  'cause of excellent AMCAF-extension:9 I just have to find compiler for it somewhere...

There's been quite quiet in this list. Have you been depressed because of that Gateway-mess (mee too:P) or what?

   Excellent :)

   Amos Pro is far better anyway :)   Anyway, if you're after the compiler then you could ask around, I would send you mine, but I can't find it's disks, and it's spralled across my AmosPro drawer (or, I think you can buy it from the Amos factory or something)

> There's been quite quiet in this list. Have you been depressed because of that Gateway-mess (mee too:P) or what?

   Nah, I rekon it's because everyone's either got board of AMOS, or we've all reached AMOS nirvana or something :)

See ya :)
