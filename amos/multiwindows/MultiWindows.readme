Custom window procedures. Let's you create and manipulate windows and 
gadgets on Amos screens.

This is a complete interface system, with windows,buttons,textboxes,
sliders,checkboxes,file selector windows,yes/no requesters etc.

Very large, a bit slow, done for the hell of it, completely free.

The catch : really inadequate documentation :)
