                        The Designer V1.50

                       (C) Ian OConnor 1994

 In this directory are a collection of files that should enable you
to develop your own producers or load Designer files into your own
programs.
 Various c files which have been tested with DICE are include.
 Note that example.c does not open any libraries but requires DICE
to do it automatically.
 You should be able to put together what you need from this stuff,
the documentation is not exhaustive but it should do the job.
