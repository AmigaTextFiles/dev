Hi!

This are the protos/includes/pragmas for MaxonC++ 3.0.
I constructed them out of the SAS/GNU/Maxon/Dice/FD includes from
then Mui 3.1 Developer distribution. (By hand: I am that stupid :-)

I changed everything but "libraries/mui.h", little changes though ...

"Professionals" don't have to read on, cause they know what to do
with them ...

But for "beginners":

    Just copy the includes to "include" (in the right subdir of
    course!!!!) and mui.lib to "lib".
    And link your programs with "mui" in the libraries field.

For "absolute beginners":

    For "DoMethod" you need "amiga" in your libs field as well.

This should work for older MaxonC++ (and "light") versions too.
(But I haven't tried ...)

Nobody's perfect so if something's worng PLEASE tell me ...
(I tried the demo-programs of the distribution, and they worked.)

Ciao,
