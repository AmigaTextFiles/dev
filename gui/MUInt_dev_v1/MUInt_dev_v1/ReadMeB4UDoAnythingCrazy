      This is the first public release of MUInt & DOSReqTools


 This is the Developer's package. Complete documentation, all the 
 executables, example scripts, and source code are included.

How To Install This Package:

      Unarc this archive and copy the directory anyplace.
      Execute the Installer.script from the shell. 

      To keep the package self-contained, tell the Installer
      to copy the executables to /MUInt_dev_v1/C.
      Then modify your startup-sequence to add /MUInt_dev_v1/C 
      to the path. This will keep your C: directory clean(er).

      Don't you just hate it when strange installers clutter up
      your C: with weird stuff?

NOTE: The Installer.script will not copy the two files in Prefs/Env-Archive.
      These files must be edited by hand and copied to SYS:Prefs/Env-Archive. 
      They are:

      XTEDIT   The path and filename of your Text Editor.
      XTVIEWER The path and filename of the picture viewer you prefer.

Example directory tree:
 

                                /MUInt_dev_v1
                  ------+----------------------+------------
                        | dirs                 | files
                        |                      | 
                    ----+------           -----+----------
                    C                     Installer.script
                    DOSReqTools           QuickLook

                                          MUInt_GUIs.info

 A quick installer is also provided. Execute QuickLook. Pray.
 It may not work on 2.x systems. 

 There are two largish AmigaGuide files that tend to explain how to 
 use this package:

      /MUInt/MUInt.guide
      /DOSReqTools/DOSrt.guide


 This package contains four MUInt programs. Blank.def, Writer.def, and
 Launcher.def and MAN.def. These are developer's tools to assist you in 
 writing MUInt programs. 
 
 If you want to see other programs download MUInt_prgs_1-4.
 
 If you download other MUInt Programs, unarc them in MUInt_GUIs/.
