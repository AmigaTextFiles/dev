                     FORMATTING THE TEXT

The text must have a newline at the end of each line. Write the text
with your text editor and format the document manually. We suggest a
maximum right margin of 70. The maximum number of lines should be 40
although Advice will accept a textfile of any length. The appearance
of the text inside the requester is controlled by the line width and
number of lines.

    Advice was developed as an adjunct to DOSReqTools and MUInt.
