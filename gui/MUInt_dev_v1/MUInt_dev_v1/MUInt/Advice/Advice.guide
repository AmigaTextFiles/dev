 DESCRIPTION
@{fg text}
 @{b}Advice@{ub} is a general purpose advisory requestor. It's function
 is to present the user with a ReqTools-like requester. This requester 
 displays text in the window and offers one Button to clear the requester.
 The text comes from a file.

 Example:

     Advice TITLE "Info for you" BODY RAM:help.txt BUTTONTEXT "_I See"

     Click @{"here" system "execute Advice.demo.scp"} to see it in action.

 Advice is very much like rtEZrequest. The main difference is that BODY
 information comes from a text file and not from the command line.

 MUInt Users:

 Calling Advice from a button is easy. If the TITLE has spaces in it
 (and it probably will) call Advice like this:

 echo >>ram:X.button "HELP;Advice *"Help Text X.help.txt*""

 Advice can be made resident. (set the P bit)

@endnode


@NODE TI
@TITLE "TITLE/A"
@{fg highlight}
     TITLE
@{fg text}

 TITLE is a Required argument and it is Positional.

 This information appears in the top bar of the window. It should 
 describe the kind of information the user is reading.
@{fg fill} 
     Advice TITLE "Installation Instructions"
@{fg text} 
 The word TITLE does not have to be used as long as the text is 
 presented as the first string following the name of the requester.
@{fg fill}
     Advice "Installation Instructions"
@{fg text}
 There is no default value for TITLE. If you choose not to present
 any information in the window you must include a null string as
 the first string after the argument.

 The text you assign as TITLE will be truncated if the window is 
 too narrow to render it. 

@ENDNODE


@NODE BO
@TITLE "BODY/A"
@{fg highlight}
     BODY
@{fg text}

 BODY is required and positional.

 This is the text that appears inside the window. Use Advice to give
 specific instructions to the user. 
@{fg fill}
  Advice "Installation Instructions" @{b}BODY RAM:help.txt@{ub}
@{fg text}
 The word BODY does not have to be used as long as the text is pres-
 ented as the next string following TITLE.

 The text must come from a textfile. If a path is necessary, include
 it like this:

     BODY DH2:extrainfo.txt

 If the filename has a space in it, enclose the entire path/filename
 in double quotes.

     BODY "DH2:Extra Info.txt"   

 FORMATTING THE TEXT

 The text must have a newline at the end of each line. Write the text
 with your text editor and format the document manually. We suggest a
 maximum right margin of 70. The maximum number of lines should be 40
 although Advice will accept a textfile of any length. The appearance 
 of the text inside the requester is controlled by the line width and
 number of lines.

 Do not embed ANSI characters in the text. They won't show.

@ENDNODE


@NODE BU
@TITLE "BUTTONTEXT"
@{fg highlight}
     BUTTONTEXT
@{fg text}
 BUTTONTEXT is optional.

 The default value is "_Continue". If you don't call a BUTTONTEXT 
 value, Advice will supply the default for you.

 You cannot assign multiple buttons. If you dan't want to use the 
 default, the syntax is this:

     BUTTONTEXT "buttontext"

 Any keypress will return a zero to $RC, and close the requester.
 Keyboard shortcuts are allowed. The UNDERSCORE character is used for
 shortcuts.

     BUTTONTEXT "_buttontext"

@ENDNODE

@NODE PU
@TITLE "PUBSCREEN/K"
@{fg highlight}
     PUBSCREEN
@{fg text}

 PUBSCREEN is optional.

 If you want a requester to appear on a Public Screen, enter the
 Public Screen name. Example:

     PUBSCREEN WorkBench

@ENDNODE



@NODE PO
@TITLE "POSITION/K"
@{fg highlight}
     POSITION or POS
@{fg text}
 You may use the name POSITION or POS interchangeably.
 With this argument, you may place the requester on several places on 
 the screen. The options are:

  CENTERSCR    Centers the requester in the screen. 
               CENTERSCR is the default if no other option is used.
  TOPLEFTSCR   Top left corner of the screen 
  CENTERWIN    Centers the requester in the active window
  TOPLEFTWIN   Top left corner of the active window
  POINTER      Places the window so the pointer is over a button


 If you don't specify POSITION, Advice will appear under the pointer.

 COPY the file Advice to anyplace in the path. SYS:c would be a good
 place to park it.

@TITLE "Those guys? Again?"

 Advice was written to compliment MUI Interface, a package that generates
 and controls a MUI GUI from a DOS script. If you use DOSReqTools, you
 will see that Advice is very much like rtEZrequest.

 Email messages will be answered immediately. Snail Mail letters will 
 take longer since we never learned to read.
