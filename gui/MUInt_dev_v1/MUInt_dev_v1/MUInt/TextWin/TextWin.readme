                 A new tool for DOS script writers 


Requirements: MagicUserInterface (MUI)
              WB 2.x and up
              (not tested on 3.1)
              For AmigaDOS script use only

Description:  When called from a script, TextWin will open a scrolling,
              sizeable window on the screen. The window displays text
              from a text file on the disk.

Usages:       TextWin is a quick, convenient way for script writers to 
              display help text on the screen, while their script is
              running. It can also be used as a general purpose file
              reader. The window iconifies to the WB screen for instant
              recall.

Distribution: Freeware, copyright 1994 by BOTH Software.


     AmigaGuide documentation, demonstration scripts, and the source
     files are included.  TextWin was written as an adjunct to MUInt, 
     a program that defines, displays and controls a MUI GUI from a
     DOS Script.
