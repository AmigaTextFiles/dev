 Usage : TextWin 

 TITLE/A,BODYTEXT=BODY/A

 DESCRIPTION
@{fg text}
 @{b}TextWin@{ub} is a general purpose advisory requestor. It's function
 is to present the user with a scrollable MUI window that displays text. 
 It offers one Button to clear the requester.The text comes from a file
 or the command line.

 It is possible, if you are so inclined, to use TextWin as a filereader.
 
 Example:
@{fg fill}
     STACK 8000
     IF EXISTS MUI:
       TextWin TITLE "Info for you" BODY RAM:help.txt
     ENDIF
@{fg text}
     Click @{"Signs" system "execute demo.example1.scp"} to see it in action.

 TextWin is meant to be called from a DOS script. If you do not know if MUI is
 present, it is recommended you test for it's existance. See the example above
 for the syntax. 
@{b}
                Be sure to set a stack of 8000
                at the beginning of the script.
@{ub}

@NODE TI
@TITLE "TITLE/A"
@{fg highlight}
     TITLE
@{fg text}

 TITLE is a Required argument and it is Positional.

 This information appears in the top bar of the window. It should 
 describe the kind of information the user is expected to provide.
@{fg fill} 
     TextWin TITLE "Installation Instructions" BODY dh3:instructions
@{fg text} 
 The word TITLE does not have to be used as long as the text is 
 presented as the first string following the name of the requester.
@{fg fill}
     "Installation Instructions" BODY dh3:instructions
@{fg text}
 There is no default value for TITLE. If you choose not to  present
 any information in the title bar, you must include a null string as
 the first string after the argument.
@{fg fill}
     TextWin "" BODY dh3:instructions
@{fg text}




@ENDNODE


@NODE BO
@TITLE "BODY/A"
@{fg highlight}
     BODY
@{fg text}

 BODY is required and positional.

 This is the text that appears inside the window. Use TextWin to give
 specific instructions to the user. 
@{fg fill}
  TextWin "Installation Instructions" @{b}BODY RAM:help.txt@{ub}
@{fg text}
 The word BODY does not have to be used as long as the text is pres-
 ented as the next string following TITLE.

 The text usually comes from a textfile. If a path is necessary, include
 it like this:
@{fg fill}
     BODY DH2:extrainfo.txt
@{fg text}
 If the filename has a space in it, enclose the entire path/filename
 in double quotes.
@{fg fill}
     BODY "DH2:Extra Info.txt"   
@{fg text}

 The text can also come from the command line.
@{fg fill}
     BODY "This text comes from the command line"
@{fg text}

 This is an inefficient way to display text. If you only need to display
 a small amount of text we recommend you use @{b}rtEZrequest@{ub}, found on
 Aminet as util/cli/DOSReqTools.lha.
