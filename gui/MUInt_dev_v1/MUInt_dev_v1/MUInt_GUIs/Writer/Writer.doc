WRITER by BOTH Software

This small package of files is meant to be a MUInt authoring tool. 
WRITER is a MUInt program that is used when writing or debugging  
your MUInt programs and scripts.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Copy all of the files in the WRITER directory into the directory that 
holds the MUInt files you are writing.

Execute Writer.def.

The local directory will be presented in the LV. Now you can perform 
the following actions on files in the directory:

     EDIT a file
     EDIT A NEW FILE (start one from scratch)
     DELETE A FILE
     VIEW A FILE WITH AMIGAGUIDE
     SET THE S PROTECTION BIT on a file
     EXECUTE A SCRIPT

These functions will allow you to generate, modify, or debug your 
scripts. You can run your XXX.def script to test it.

When you have finished writing and debugging your scripts, Delete the 
Writer files.

Writer is an open-ended concept. If you add features to it, please 
pass it along to the other beta testers.

WARNING:

You MUST change the name of the text editor in the files WRIeditLV.scp
and WRIeditnew.scp. (unless you use Annotate). Check it anyway :)
