Some information about the MAN files in this directory:

MAN.def is a DOS script

man.bas is an ACE Basic source file that performs the function of MAN.
You must compile it with the ACE compiler. The Source file is included
here so you can see how a simple MUInt gui can be generated from ACE.

MAN.com is a COMAL95 source file. It is included so you can see how
COMAL can be used to control a simple MUInt gui.

MAN is the compiled COMAL program. It can be called from the shell. I 
recommend you place MAN in the path and use it instead of the script 
version. This program was written in 15 minutes and has not been 
fieldtested :)

Read the MAN.com file and notice that MUInt and rtEZrequest are both 
used. 

Whichever MAN program you use, you MUST run the Installer.script 
first.
