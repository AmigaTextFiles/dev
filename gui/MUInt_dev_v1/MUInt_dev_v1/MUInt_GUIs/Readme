If you download any of the MUInt_prgs_x archives, unarc
them and place them inside this directory. The program called 
Launcher works best when all the MUInt programs are stored in
this manner.

PS: Writer.def is a pretty useless thingie. I used it for a while 
when I first started writing these programs, but soon abandoned it.
