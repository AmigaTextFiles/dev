LAUNCHER will assemble a list of MUInt definition files,
then allow you to launch any of these programs.

LAUNCHER makes one assumption: The directory that contains 
this program is at the same level as your other MUInt dir-
ectories.  When run, LAUNCHER CD's to the directory above 
and then scans all directories at this level, looking for 
MUInt programs. It assembles a list of these files and pre-
sents them in the listview. 

This list of files is written to the LAUNCHER directory. If
you add or subtract MUInt programs from your drive, you can
update the list by clicking the "UPDATE" button.
