@rem   ARGUMENTS SECTION
@rem ==================================================================






@NODE TI
@TITLE "TITLE/A"
@{fg highlight}
     TITLE
@{fg text}
This section applies to the following requesters:

      rtGetLong          
      rtEZRequest        
      rtGetString        
      rtFileRequest      
      rtFontRequest      
      rtPaletteRequest   

 TITLE is a Required argument and it is Positional.

 This information appears in the top bar of the window. It should 
 describe the kind of information the user is expected to provide.
@{fg fill} 
     rtEZRequest TITLE "Installation Instructions"
@{fg text} 
 The word TITLE does not have to be used as long as the text is 
 presented as the first string following the name of the requester.
@{fg fill}
     rtEZRequest "Installation Instructions"
@{fg text}
     @{"TITLE" SYSTEM "execute demo.titletext"}

 There is no default value for TITLE. If you choose not to  present
 any information in the window you must include a null string  as
 the first string after the argument.
@{fg fill}
 rtEZRequest "" "No Title Text Appears"
@{fg text}
     @{"NOTITLE" SYSTEM "execute demo.titletext.1"}

 The text you assign as TITLE will be truncated if the window is 
 too narrow to render it. 

@ENDNODE


@NODE BO
@TITLE "BODY/A"
@{fg highlight}
     BODY
@{fg text}

This section applies to the following requesters:

      rtGetLong          
      rtEZRequest        
      rtGetString        

 BODY 

 This is the text that appears inside the window. Use it to give 
 specific instructions to the user. 
@{fg fill}
  rtEZRequest "Installation Instructions" @{b}BODY "Install for real?"@{ub}
@{fg text}
 The word BODY does not have to be used as long as the text is 
 presented as the next string following TITLE.
@{fg fill}
 rtEZRequest "Installation Instructions" "@{b}Install for real?@{ub}"
@{fg text}
     @{"BODY" SYSTEM "execute demo.bodytext"}
@{fg highlight}
DISPLAYING MORE THAN ONE LINE OF BODYTEXT
@{fg text}
 The inclusion of a \n (backslash and the letter n) will force the 
 text that follows to print on a new line. Here is an example:
@{fg fill} 
     BODY "Support Shareware@{b}\n@{ub}Register today"
@{fg text}
 Notice there are no spaces before or after the \n. If you intend to 
 use many lines of BODY, each line should be set as an ENVironment 
 variable to save space on the command line. Here's an example:
@{fg fill}
     SET title "Voter Instructions"
     SET line1 "Support Smith for County Registrar\n"
     SET line2 "Give til it hurts\n"
     SET line3 "Vote early and vote often"
     
     rtEZRequest "$title" "$line1 $line2 $line3" "_Continue"
@{fg text}
     @{"MULTILINE" SYSTEM "execute demo.bodytext.1"}

 There is no default value for BODY. If you choose not to 
 present any information, you must include a null string 
 as the second string after the argument.
@{fg fill}
      rtEZRequest "Working...." "" "Continue|Help|Cancel"
@{fg text}
     @{"NOBODYTEXT" SYSTEM "execute demo.bodytext.2"}

@ENDNODE


@NODE BU
@TITLE "BUTTONTEXT"
@{fg highlight}
     BUTTONTEXT
@{fg text}
 This section applies to the following requesters:

      rtGetLong          
      rtEZRequest        
      rtGetString        

 BUTTONTEXT is optional.

 YOU may select how many buttons to show in the window. You may also 
 define the text of each button. The method of defining buttons is the 
 same as ASK. The BUTTONTEXT argument is is not required because there 
 is a default value built in to ReqTools. If you choose to use 
 BUTTONTEXT, the string must appear as the third string following 
 the argument. The use of the keyword BUTTONTEXT is optional.
@{fg fill}
rtEZRequest "$title" "body" BUTTONTEXT "Copy|Delete|Cancel"
@{fg text} 
is the same as:
@{fg fill}
rtEZRequest "$title" "body" "Copy|Delete|Cancel"
@{fg text}


 The default value is "Ok|Cancel". If you don't call a BUTTONTEXT 
 value, ReqTools will supply the default for you.

     @{"BUTTONTEXT_DEFAULT" SYSTEM "execute demo.button.1"}

 You determine which button was pressed by setting a variable to the 
 value of $RC - the system's Return Code. An example:
@{fg fill}
 rtEZrequest "Which Button was pressed" "Press a button" "1|2|3|0"
 SET Result $RC
 rtEZrequest "Button Tester" "You Pressed button $Result ." "I Get It"
@{fg text}

     @{"BUTTON_TESTER" SYSTEM "execute demo.button.2"}

 Notice that $RC returns a number, not the button's text. Always 
 place the variable assignment on the very next line following the 
 call to a requester. $RC changes each time DOS does something 
 significant.

 Regardless of the text you assign to the buttons, the rightmost button 
 always returns a zero. The leftmost button returns a one.

 In the example above, four buttons were defined. The leftmost button
 returns a one (1), and the buttons to the right of it return one
 number more until the rightmost button is reached.

 As a practical matter, you should not assign more that 19 buttons to 
 any requester. If you do, the results could interfere with the ERROR 
 VALUE returned by ReqTools.

@{fg highlight}
KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
@{fg text}
 Instead of making the user click on a button with the mouse, you can 
 assign a keyboard shortcut to any button. Just prefix the button text 
 with an underscore. Example:

     "_Ok|_Help|_Cancel" OR "Quie_t|Q_uilt|_Quit"

 The underscore lets the user press the letter following it. Here are
 two interactive examples showing the difference between the two methods:

     @{"With Shortcuts" SYSTEM "execute demo.shortcut"}
     @{"Without Shortcuts" SYSTEM "execute demo.shortcut.1"}

@{fg highlight}
Calling a Help File from a button
@{fg text}

 You can define a button to call an Amigaguide file to present 
 detailed Help. The script should call the AmigaGuide file with it's 
 full path. You can also include a "document" within the file to 
 present. Note: when calling Multiview, a "document" cannot be 
 specified. Example:

     IF $Result EQ 2
      SYS:Utilities/AmigaGuide SYS:S/MyDocFile.guide DOCUMENT help
     ENDIF

 Where "help" is the NODE Help within the database MyDocFile.

@ENDNODE

@NODE IN
@TITLE "INVISIBLE/S"
@{fg highlight}
     INVISIBLE
@{fg text}
 This section applies to the following requesters:

      rtGetLong          
      rtGetString        

 This argument will suppress the ECHOing of keystrokes to the screen. 
 Use this argument to take in Passwords.


@ENDNODE

@NODE DE
@TITLE "DEFAULT/K"
@{fg highlight}
     DEFAULT
@{fg text}
 This section applies to the following requesters:

      rtGetLong          
      rtEZRequest        
      rtGetString        

 The DEFAULT argument sends a string or number to be placed in the 
 requester as a default value. If the user wants to use the default
 value, they just press return and the value is returned to the script.

 @{B}rtGetLong@{UB} deals with numbers, so the default must be a whole number
 with a value between -2,000,000 and +2,000,000. Don't include the 
 commas. Example:

     DEFAULT 125

 @{B}rtGetString@{UB} returns a string, so the default must be a string.
 Example:

     DEFAULT "Green"

 @{B}rtEZRequest@{UB} does not return anything but a button number. You can 
 specify which button will be returned when the return key is pressed.
 Also see NORETURNKEY. Example:

     "Ok|Help|Cancel"
     DEFAULT 2

 If the user does not use the mouse to click a button, but elects to 
 press the return key, the button number 2 will be returned. This 
 corresponds to the Help key in the example. (1|2|0)

 In all instances, the DEFAULT argument needs to be called with it's 
 name and a value after it. It is a  Keyword.


@ENDNODE


@NODE AL
@TITLE "ALLOWEMPTY/S "
@{fg highlight}
     ALLOWEMPTY
@{fg text}
 This section applies to the following requesters:

      rtGetLong          
      rtGetString        
      rtFileRequest      

 If the user does not select a value, and presses the return key
 this argument will force the value in $RC to be true (1). This is 
 the same as clicking the leftmost button. You may use this value
 to make tests in your script. 


@ENDNODE


@NODE CE
@TITLE "CENTERTEXT/S"
@{fg highlight}
     CENTERTEXT
@{fg text}
 This section applies to the following requesters:

      rtGetLong          
      rtEZRequest        
      rtGetString        

 The text you include with the BODY argument can be center-
 justified with this argument. Here are two examples showing the 
 difference:

     @{"Center Text" SYSTEM "execute demo.centertext"}
     @{"Left Justified Text" SYSTEM "execute demo.centertext.1"}

@{fg highlight}
     NORETURNKEY
@{fg text}
 This section applies to the following requester:

      rtEZRequest 

 This turns off the Return key as a positive response. The user
 must click a button with the mouse or use a keyboard shortcut
 to respond to the requester.

@ENDNODE


@NODE CL
@TITLE "COLOR/K/N"
@{fg highlight}
     COLOR <num>
@{fg text}
 This section applies to the following requester:

      rtPaletteRequest 


 COLOR presets a color in the requester. Allowable values for COLOR
 are zero through the 15 on a 16 color workbench.

   
@ENDNODE

@NODE PO
@TITLE "POSITION/K"
@{fg highlight}
     POSITION or POS
@{fg text}
 This section applies to the following requesters:

      rtGetLong          
      rtEZRequest        
      rtGetString        
      rtFileRequest
      rtFontRequest      
      rtPaletteRequest   

 You may use the keywords POSITION or POS interchangeably.
 With this argument, you may place the requester on several places on 
 the screen. The options are:

  CENTERSCR    Centers the requester in the screen. (default)
               CENTERSCR is the default if no other option is used.
  TOPLEFTSCR   Top left corner of the screen
  CENTERWIN    Centers the requester in the active window
  TOPLEFTWIN   Top left corner of the active window
  POINTER      Places the window so the pointer is over a button

 Here's an interactive example showing all five positioning statements:

     @{"POSITION.DEMO" SYSTEM "execute demo.position"}

 The POSITION argument must be included:

 rtEZRequest "title" "bodytext" POSITION POINTER

 The POSITION argument may be modified by two other arguments:

@{"TOPOFFSET" link tp}
@{"LEFTOFFSET" link le}

 For more information, see those sections.

@ENDNODE


@NODE TP
@TITLE "TOPOFFSET/N/K"
@{fg highlight}
     TOPOFFSET or TOP
     LEFTOFFSET or LEFT
@{fg text}
This section applies to the following requesters:

      rtGetLong          
      rtEZRequest        
      rtGetString        
      rtFileRequest      
      rtFontRequest      
      rtPaletteRequest   

 TOPOFFSET modifies the POSITION of the window placement. Example:

 TOPOFFSET 100

 This moves the window down 100 pixels from the place POSITION put it.
 Use this Argument in conjunction with the POSITION argument.
 Example:

 rtPaletteRequest POSITION TOPLEFTSCR TOPOFFSET 50

 LEFTOFFSET can also be used on the same line to move the requester 
 away from the place POSITION put it. Example:

 rtPaletteRequest POSITION CENTERSCR TOP 50 LEFT 150

 The numeric values following TOP and LEFT refer to an offset of the 
 WINDOW, not the from the edge of the screen. Both positive and negative 
 numbers are valid. As an example, place the requester in the center of
 the screen with POSITION CENTERSCR. If you modify the position with
 TOP 100, the requester will be moved DOWN 100 pixels. TOP -100 would
 move it up 100 pixels.

 Using the same example, LEFT 100 will move the requester 100 pixels
 to the right. LEFT -100 will move the requester 100 pixels to the left.
 
 LEFT and TOP will not work with POINTER.


@ENDNODE


@NODE LE
@TITLE "LEFTOFFSET/N/K"
@{fg highlight}
     LEFTOFFSET or LEFT

     TO
@{fg text}
 This section applies to the following requesters:

      rtGetLong          
      rtGetString        
      rtFileRequest   

 These requesters gather information for you. To use this information 
 within your script, use the TO Keyword. You must use this Keyword 
 with these requesters or you won't be able to retrieve the 
 information the user provided.

 TO must be followed by ENV:<filename>

 The information taken in by the requester is written to the file 
 ENV:<filename>

 If you do not need the information to be used in the script, TO can send 
 the data to a file anywhere you specify.

 This is how you would use the TO Keyword:
@{fg fill}
 rtGetString "Psych Test" "Your favorite Color?" "_Continue" TO ENV:color
@{fg text}

 The user types in a color and that string is stored in ENV:color

     @{"Color Test" SYSTEM "execute demo.color"}

 To retrieve the variable from within your script, just reference the
 filename with a $ in front of it. In this case $color.

@{fg fill}
 SET response "We think you are nuts because your favorite color is"
 rtEZrequest "Psych Evaluation" "$Response $Color" 
@{fg text}

 TO can also be used to send the output to a file or the ClipBoard.

@{fg highlight}
DESCRIPTION
@{fg text}
 @{b}rtFileRequest@{ub} allows the user to select a file(s) or directory
 to be passed back to your script. This is an ideal solution to writing
 installer scripts.

@{fg highlight}
ABOUT FILENAMES
@{fg text} 

 When the user selects a filename, that name might have SPACE 
 CHARACTERS embedded in it. If so, the filename will be enclosed in 
 "double quotes". If no SPACEs are detected, quotes will not be used.

 It is assumed you will want to set an ENVironment variable to use
 the filename/directory selected. 

 We recommend you use the TO keyword in all cases. If the user 
 declines to select a file or directory, IconX might pop up a small 
 shell window to report something you don't want to the user to see.

 If the user has clicked on a file or directory and then cancels the 
 requester with the Close gadget or the Cancel button, the file "selected"
 will be ECHOed to the IconX window. By sending the selection TO ENV,
 the window will be suppressed. 

 Sometimes a failed DOS command in your script will be reported in a 
 shell window. Typical of these incidents are NO FILE TO DELETE, and 
 FILES COPIED. You can suppress many of these outputs by using the 
 QUIET keyword.

 This requester follows the button value convention used elsewhere in
 DOSReqTools. The OK button returns a 1. The Cancel button returns a 0.
@{fg highlight}
Using MagicFileRequest (MFR) 
@{fg text}

 If you have installed Steven Stuntz's MFR, many of the Keywords will be
 ignored. Since MFR presents all ASSIGNS, DEVICES, etc. automatically,
 it is useless to specify Keywords like VOLUMEREQUEST. rtFileRequest will
 pass TITLE and other information into the MFR requester.

@{b}A CAUTION

 This file requester was not intended to return a value of one for the 
 OK button and a value of 0 for the Cancel button. We had to rework 
 the requester to accomplish this.
 
 If you specify SELECTDIRS to get a directory, the user can use the 
 parent button to go up in the directory tree, then hit the Cancel 
 button. If this sequence of events occurs, The Directory name sent to 
 ENV with the TO Keyword will not reflect the change of directories by 
 the user. BEWARE

@{fg highlight}
DESCRIPTION
@{fg text}
 @{b}rtFontRequest@{ub} allows the user to view and select a font. 
 This requester does not change the fonts selected by FontPrefs.

 The only use we've found for this requester is to pass SETFONT the
 parameters it needs to set the font of a shell window. Here's how it 
 works:

 rtFontRequest will send the following to the envariable selected
 with the TO keyword:

     FONTNAME/A,SIZE/A,ITALIC/S,BOLD/S,UNDERLINE/S

 The Script writer will take the output of rtFontRequest and issue the
 DOS Command like this:
@{fg fill}
     rtFontRequest "Pick one" TO ENV:FONTDEF

     SETFONT $FONTDEF
@{fg text}
SETFONT can also take two other keywords:

     PROP  (Proportional)
     SCALE (scale the font to a non-standard size)

 If SCALE or PROP is required, they may be tacked on like this:
@{fg fill}
     SETFONT $FONTDEF SCALE PROP
@{fg text}

 To see the results of this requester, try the example script "demo.setfont".
 Execute it from the shell.

DESCRIPTION
@{fg text}
 @{b}rtEZRequest@{ub} is a general purpose advisory requestor. It's function
 is to give the user of a choice of responses by clicking on buttons.
 The identity of the button clicked is available to your script through
 the system variable $RC.

 @{b}Advice@{ub} is another general purpose advisory requestor, identical in
 all respects to rtEZrequest with one exception. Advice gets its BODY 
 text from a text file, not from the command line.

Example of use:
@{fg fill}
     Advice TITLE "Instructions" BODY helpfile.txt
@{fg text}

 The textfile would be prepared with a text editor that outputs ASCII 
 with a Newline at the end of each line. ANSI characters will not be 
 displayed.

 Advice was written to put up a larger body of text than rtEZrequest 
 can handle. There is no limit on the size of the textfile, but you
 should limit the number of lines to about 30 or the requester will 
 cover the entire screen.

 Advice is located in MUInt/Advice.

DESCRIPTION
@{fg text}
     Use rtGetLong to get a number from the user. Only numbers in the
     range of -2,000,000 to +2,000,000 will be accepted. 

     Only whole numbers are accepted. You may specify an allowable
     range with the MIN and MAX arguments. These arguments, when
     called will be shown in the window. If the user tries to enter
     a number greater than the MAX or smaller than the MIN the screen
     will flash, warning of an improper entry. You may use either MIN
     or MAX or both.  
@{fg highlight}
STORING AND USING THE OUTPUT
@{fg text}
     To get the number back into your script as a variable, you must
     first specify where the number is to be stored, and it's name.
     Use the TO argument to send the number to an ENV file.
     Example:
@{fg fill}
          TO ENV:age
@{fg text}
     Assuming the number is to be used as an age, this argument will
     store the number in the RAM:ENV directory with the filename age.
     The number will now be available to your script as the variable
     named $age. 
@{fg highlight}
INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE OF RTGETLONG
@{fg text}
     Here is an example of using rtGetLong:
@{fg fill}
 rtGetLong "Information" "What is your age?" "OK" MIN 15 MAX 70 TO ENV:age
 rtEZRequest "Sensus Data" "Are you are $age years old?" "_Yes|_No"
QUIT
@{fg text}
     We will take in a number between 15 and 70, store the number in
     ENV:age, and then use the number in the next requester as $age.

 Now click @{"rtGetLong" system "execute demo.rtGetLong.1"} to see it work.

@title "Installing MUInt_dev_x"

 Installation is very simple. We recommend you make a root directory
 on your hard drive and copy the directories and files in this package
 into that root directory.

 Execute the Installer.script. This script will copy to a place of your
 choosing the executables necessary to use MUInt and DOSReqTools .

 We suggest you copy these files to a directory that is in the path.

     The name of this directory should NOT have spaces in it.

 The installer will allow you to create a new directory to hold these 
 files. If you choose to do this, you must alter your startup-sequence
 to add this directory to the path.

 The installer will create the files DOSRTPATH and MUINTPATH in Env-Archive
 so the rtMan program can find out where you put these AmigaGuide files.

 It will also create an uninstall file so that you may uninstall the 
 executables at a later date. That file will end up in ram:. If you 
 want to save it, copy it to your hard drive.

DOSReqTools by BOTH Software
@{fg text}
 Until now, only programmers who have mastered C or other high level
 programming languages could use the power of Nico Francois' ReqTools.
 His requesters have become the defacto standard in the Amiga community.
 Now his requesters may be used by anyone who writes AmigaDOS scripts.
 
 DOSReqTools allows you to write complete installer scripts, including 
 on-line Help. 

 Other uses for DOSReqTools include automating your backup scripts and 
 system boot-up scripts.
 
 You can now include decision making abilities within an AmigaGuide 
 database. This database is an example. Your programs could actually 
 be installed from within the Guide Doc. Throughout this Manual, 
 you will see interactive examples of this facility. The syntax for
 calling your script from a label is:
@{fg fill}
       *{"label" SYSTEM "EXECUTE demo.overview"}
@{fg text}
                             @{"label" SYSTEM "EXECUTE demo.overview"}

 The requester will pop to the front screen, right on top of the
 AmigaGuide (or MultiView) screen. Can you see some possibilities here?
@{fg highlight}
          About using the demos from this manual:

      As long as the demos and this AmigaGuide database 
      are in the same  directory, the demos will pop up
      on the screen.
@{fg text}
 This manual is designed to help you learn how to use the various 
 requesters, not how to use AmigaDOS. It is assumed you have some 
 knowledge of DOS. There are plenty of interactive examples to help 
 you learn the syntax of the requesters.

 Each type of requester may be called with a variety of "arguments",
 like TITLE or BODY. These arguments are presented in each section
 of this manual that describes a requester. The sections begin with
 a complete list of the arguments that the requester can use. These 
 are @{"labels" link fake} that will direct you to an explaination of that argument.

 The Command Template for that requester is presented in each section.  

 We hope you find DOSReqTools useful. If Nico Francois updates 
 ReqTools, we will port the changes into DOSReqTools. 

 You will need a passing knowledge of templates to use the requesters.
 There are more that 40 demo scripts included. You can learn quickly 
 by studying them.

@TITLE "Why did you write DOSReqTools? I hate DOS!!!"


 DOSReqTools is the first of a two part package. We want to give some
 programming power to DOS script writers. As implimented under 2.1 and
 3.0, DOS is not a functional programming language. It lacks most of the
 basic looping structures and just about anything else that would
 define it as a language. What DOS has going for it is that every Amiga
 has it built in, and it can be useful for limited functions.

 DOS is never going to be a real programming language. What we hope to do 
 is allow people who have not learned C to write functional, powerful
 scripts in a way that was not possible before.


 1 DOSReqTools adds several new extensions to DOS to allow manipulation
   of strings and filenames. It also adds the requesters to the DOS
   script writer's toolbox.

 2 The next part, MUInt, gives a script writer access to a definable
   MUI GUI. The GUI can have up to three PopASL filerequesters, a
   ListView, a scrolling textwindow, Radio buttons, Checkmark boxes,
   and any number of programmable buttons. The buttons, when pressed
   can execute any DOS command or DOS script.

   @{b}The GUI does not leave the screen until the QUIT button is pressed.@{ub}

   From the user's point of view, the GUI looks like any other GUI
   generated by MUIBuilder and driven by a C program.

   This system allows a programmer to quickly write a professional
   looking GUI for his application. Another use for MUInt is to
   write front ends for existing CLI-ONLY programs, thus allowing
   WorkBench users easy access to these executables.

   We rely heavily on user feedback for the development of these
   programs. If you have questions or would like to advance some 
   ideas, contact us.

   We are currently working a a new language for the Amiga called 
   COMAL. If this project interests you, please send Email to us.

   The DOSReqTools/MUInt package was written in the first part of 1995.
   Development stopped in March and the project was shelved for a bit. 
   It is now as good as it's gonna get, so I am releasing it. @{b}I would 
   like to caution you about some things you will find here.@{ub} 
 
 Some of the executables have Enforcer hits. Do not let this prevent 
 you from using the programs. The hits are not caused by illegal memory 
 access, but rather a deficiency in the Enforcer itself. Do not send me
 Email reporting Enforcer hits. I've already gone ten rounds with the
 beta testers over this. :)
 
 If you use the Installer.script, the Uninstall file will be placed in 
 RAM. Copy it to a place of safekeeping.
 
 I have tried my best to remove all references to "beta testers" from 
 these docs. If I missed something, please ignore it.
 
 I know that not all of the scripts in MUInt_prg_x are completely 
 functional. The scripts were written (and distributed) so you could 
 see how MUInt and DOSReqTools can be used in a wide variety of 
 applications. Some of these scripts use a configuration script to 
 customize the program to your system. The variables are written to 
 Env-Archive, so if you see some strange looking files in ENV:, you 
 know where they came from.
 
 I've spent a couple of days trying out the scripts in this package. I 
 think they all work as advertised. If not, just FLAME me. 

 You will need a good understanding of DOS to get the most from all 
 these programs. Try writing some simple scripts at first. If you have 
 some fun with all this and plan on using it in the future, I recommend 
 you make rtEZrequest and Advice resident. This will speed up many of your 
 scripts.

 I use a 40mzh, 030 A1200 with a 640X495 screen. I know that I have 
 formatted some of the docs to this screen size. If this causes you 
 some problems, please excuse me.

 As I mentioned before, Will and I are writing COMAL for the Amiga. 
 We wrote MUInt and DOSReqTools so that COMAL would have access to 
 GUIs and the ReqTools requesters immediately. This has worked out very 
 well. We currently have compiled COMAL programs interacting with the
 requesters and MUInt perfectly. I even wrote some ACE Basic programs 
 that work with them as well.

 The executables contained in these archives are not memory hungry. 
 They have been run on A500s with minimum RAM.
 
 I *do* answer my Email, so don't hesitate to send me questions.

@NODE RULE
@TITLE "General Rules and Command Templates"

 ReqTools is a library of seven requesters. Each requester pops up a 
 unique window to gather information from the user. When you call a 
 requester from your script you must follow the rules that ReqTools 
 expects. The most important rule is to pass the proper arguments, 
 spelled correctly, and in the proper order.

 You can get this information by reading this manual or from the shell.
 We suggest you read the individual sections that outline the usage
 of each requester.

 The Command Template of each requester is available from the shell 
 by typing the requester's name followed by a question mark. This will 
 show you the command template for that requester. Example:
@{fg fill}
     rtEZrequest ?
@{fg text}
 You can get a verbose listing of the template and the kind of 
 information required for each argument by entering the name of the 
 requester and HELP. Example:
@{fg fill}
     rtEZRequest help
@{fg text}
 The command template for each requester is in the section that
 describes that requester. Templates are useful to figure out
 what each requester needs. When you first look at a command
 template, it may appear to be alphabet soup. Arguments, keywords
 and qualifiers are presented in a very cryptic manner. This is an 
 AmigaDOS requirement.
@{fg highlight}
 What you need to know:
@{fg text}
 Qualifiers are letters preceeded by a / (slash).

 Required Arguments are terms that are followed by a /A.
 They must appear in the same order that they are presented
 in the command template. 

 Optional Arguments are terms followed by a /N, /K, /S, /F.
 Optional Arguments without qualifiers are considered 
 POSITIONAL and REQUIRED. There are three arguments that meet
 this requirement: BODY, FILE, DRAWER. Positional arguments must 
 appear in the order they appear in the template.
@{fg highlight}
               When in doubt, use the Keyword
@{fg text}
@{fg highlight}
 Examples using DOSReqTools requesters:
@{fg text}
 TITLE/A     - This argument is required. All requesters need TITLE.
               Required arguments are presented first in the command
               template and you must call them in the order that
               they are presented. Since they are POSITIONAL, you do
               not have to enter the argument's name, just the string
               that represents the argument.


 DEFAULT/N/K - This argument is optional. If you use it, you must 
               enter the name (DEFAULT) followed by a number. The
               /N tells you the argument will only accept a number.
               If /N is not specified, the argument requires a string.
               The /K means the argument is a Keyword. It is optional
               and if used, the name must be used. 


 HIGHLIGHT/S - This argument is optional, and needs no extra 
               information following it. Just entering the name of 
               the argument turns on that function. The /S means
               this is a Switch.


 CENTERTEXT=CENTER/S - If an argument has two names separated by an
                       equal sign, that argument may be called by
                       either name. These are usually used to shorten
                       a long argument name.


 For a more complete explaination of Arguments and Keywords, see the
 @{u}AmigaDOS Reference Guide@{uu}, Fourth Edition, by Sheldon Leemon.
 This reference was published by Compute Books.
@{fg highlight}
COMMAND TEMPLATE RECAP
@{fg text}
 To see the command template for a requester, enter the requester's 
 name in the shell, followed by help and press enter. Example:
@{fg fill}
     rtGetString help
@{fg text}
 The arguments with /A qualifiers are POSITIONAL. They must be used, 
 and they must be in order. Using the actual name of the argument is 
 optional. Example:
@{fg fill}
 rtEZRequest TITLE "System Advice" BODY "ReqTools Lib not present"
@{fg text} 
     is the same as
@{fg fill}
 rtEZRequest "System Advice" "ReqTools Lib not present"
@{fg text}

 rtEZrequest expects the first string to be TITLE and the next string
 to be BODY. Therefore, you do not have to enter the keywords.

@{fg highlight}
GETTING INFORMATION BACK TO YOUR SCRIPT
@{fg text}
 The requesters gather data from the user. That information, either 
 numbers or strings, must be available to your script as a variable.

 Numbers and strings are stored as an ENVirionment variable by using 
 the TO argument. This is exactly the same as redirecting the output 
 to a file in RAM:ENV. You cannot redirect the output of DOSReqTools, 
 so you MUST use the TO argument to store data. @{u}You@{uu} define the filename
 and @{u}you@{uu} decide how it is to be used in your script. Example:
@{fg fill}
 rtGetString "Data" "What is your Phone Number?" TO ENV:phone
@{fg text}
 The phone number entered by the user is now available to you as $phone.

 In addition to the data gathered, you may need to know which button 
 the user pressed. @{u}You@{uu} define the number of buttons and the text of 
 each button. DOSReqTools returns the number of the button pressed in 
 the system variable $RC (return code). Example:
@{fg fill}
     SET Result $RC
@{fg text}
 The value of the button pressed is now available as $Result. 
 For more information see @{"BUTTONTEXT" link bu}.

@{fg highlight}
ABOUT THIS MANUAL
@{fg text}
 We feel that the likeliest users of DOSReqTools will be those people 
 who do not write in C, ACE, Pascal or any other high level language. 
 For that reason, we have tried to include simple to understand 
 programming examples throughout each section. Many of the concepts
 and details are presented twice.

 The unique nature of DOSReqTools allows us to present an actual script,
 and then let you click a button to see the script in action. None of 
 the demo scripts will do anything to your system, so feel free to 
 click any button that is presented.

 Important subheadings are presented in @{fg highlight}HIGHLIGHT@{fg text} (white for most). 
 Scripts are presented in @{fg fill}FILL@{fg text} (blue for most).
 This applies only to users of AmigaGuide v37 (OS3.0).  

 We have tried to use the same calling syntax to ReqTools that a 
 C programmer would use. The obvious difference would be the TO 
 argument. This argument had to be added so that data could be 
 made available to the calling script.
@{fg highlight}
rtMan -"MAN PAGES" for DOSReqTools
@{fg text}
 This is a big complicated package to memorize. If you are like me, 
 you might use DOSReqTools occasionally to jazz up a script. It's hard 
 to remember the calling syntax for every requester, so a small scale
 Man page script is included to help you. 

 rtMan is the script that lives in C. Just type in @{b}rtman@{ub} from the shell
 and an EZrequester will ask you which part of DOSReqTools you want 
 information about. 

 This command  will call this AmigaGuide database and display the document
 (node) that describes that requester. Don't change the call to  Multiview!
 It can't display a database. rtMan will not function unless you use the
 Installer.script. See @{"Install DOSReqTools" link inst}

 If you have MUI installed, you may call Man.def to perform the same 
 function. Man.def is a MUInt program.

@TITLE "Distribution and Copyright Notice"

 DOSReqTools is copyright 1994, 1995 by BOTH Software. It is @{b}GIFTWARE@{ub}.
 That means if you like it and use it, you must send us a Gift. 
 A birthday card or email would be nice. We would really like
 to hear about how you've used the requesters. 

 If you feel a requester could be made more useful, please contact 
 BOTH Software. 

 DOSReqTools is free to use and copy as you see fit. The Authors retain
 all rights to the programs. The Authors are not responsible for any
 damage the programs may cause. If you distribute the archive, you
 MUST distribute the entire package. The exception to this requirement
 would be if you wrote a script that used some of the requesters or
 extensions, you could distribute just those programs. We ask that you
 DO NOT RENAME the DOS extension's filenames. This could cause confusion.

 DOSReqTools may be included in any archive collection. 

 Tested on a 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000, 600, 500 and a 1200 without problems.

@TITLE "Extensions to DOS included in this package" 
@{fg highlight}
 EXTRA PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE
@{fg text}

 Since DOSReqTools is intended for use by script writers, we chose to 
 release some DOS Extensions with this package.

 These programs are intended to be used in a DOS Script. All of these
 programs, with the exception of INSTRING can be used inside `backticks`
 or have the output redirected from stdout to another location or file.

 More DOS Extension are included with MUInt. 

@{fg highlight}
     GetString
@{fg text}
 Usage is simple. It will take in a string from the user, from the shell,
 and send the response to an ENVironment Variable.
@{fg fill}
     GetString >ENV:name "What is your name:"
@{fg text}
 The string "What is your name?" is a prompt that will appear on the 
 command line, prompting the user to type in his name. The response is
 available as $name.

 @{b}Do not use this command in `backticks`.@{ub}

@{fg highlight}
     InString
@{fg text}
 This will compare two strings to see if one string appears in the 
 other string. If the test is true, InString returns WARN and the
 starting and ending position. If the test fails, InString returns
 a zero in $RC and a starting/ending position of 0:0

 InString is presumed to be case insensitive. If you want the test to be
 case sensitive, include the flag CASE. 

 Usage:

@{fg fill}
     SET $filenamme "picture.iff" 
     InString ".iff" $filenamme
     IF WARN
       ECHO $filenamme is an IFF file"
     ELSE
       ECHO $filenamme is not an IFF file"
     ENDIF
@{fg text}

 If .iff is found within $filenamme, InString will return a 5, or WARN.
 InString is not positional. If the substring is found anywhere in 
 the string, the result will be TRUE (WARN)

 To get the actual placement of the substring you are testing for,
 redirect the output to a variable.
@{fg fill}
     InString >env:place "BC" "aBCdef" CASE
     IF WARN
       ECHO $place
     ELSE
       ECHO "Not Found"
     ENDIF
@{fg text}
 Since the test is true, $place will hold "2:3".

 InString may be used in backticks like this:
@{fg fill}
     IF `InString ".iff" $filename`
@{fg text}

 If the condition is TRUE, WARN is returned
 If the condition is FALSE, a zero is returned

@{fg highlight}
     SubString
@{fg text}

 This command will allow you to pull a substring from a string. The 
 substring is defined by a starting position and an ending position.
 Start_pos should be 1 or greater.

Usage:
@{fg fill}
     SET temp `SubString <string> <start_pos>:<end_pos>`
     SubString >variable <start_pos>:<end_pos>
@{fg text}          
An example:
@{fg fill}
     SET test "1234567890"
     SET result `SubString $test 3:6`
     ECHO $result
     3456
@{fg text}
 Using the example above, let's look at how the command handles
 errors and out of range problems:
 
     0:5  returns 12345
     1:5  returns 12345
     5:15 returns 567890
     6:6  returns 6
     6:7  returns 78
    11:8  returns nothing or the previous value of $result
     6:5  returns nothing or the previous value of $result
     2:   returns 234567890
      :3  returns 123
      5   returns 567890

 The returned value will not have a trailing carraige return. If you
 desire a carraige return, use ECHO like this:
@{fg fill}
     ECHO  `SubString <string> <start_pos>:<end_pos>`
@{fg text}

@{fg highlight}
     EqualsNull
@{fg text}
 This will test a string (or ENV variable) to see if contains
 data or is a null string. 

 Usage:

     EqualsNull <string>         (test a string)
     EqualsNull <a_file          (input from a file)
     EqualsNull $a_variable      (test a variable)

 Examples:
@{fg fill}
     EqualsNull ""
     IF WARN
       ECHO "The string is empty"
     ENDIF


     EqualsNull <a_file_somewhere
     IF WARN
       ECHO "The string is empty"
     ENDIF


     EqualsNull $any_variable
     IF WARN
       ECHO "The string is empty"
     ENDIF
@{fg text}

 If the string is empty (null) a 5 is returned in $RC.
 If the string is not empty, a 0 is returned in $RC.

@{fg highlight}
     ChangeExt
@{fg text}

  This will change the filename extension of a filename that is stored
  in a variable. It won't change a filename on a disk. If you need to
  do that, use NewExt, by Lee Kindness. It's available on AmiNet in
  util/batch.

  Example:
@{fg fill}
  SET sourcename "picture.jpg"
  ChangeExt >env:temp $sourcename ".gif"
  ECHO $temp
  picture.gif
@{fg text}
  If no extension is specified (with a null string), the existing extension
  will be removed.
@{fg fill}
  SET source "DH5:graphics/picture.jpg"
  ChangeExt >env:temp $source ""
  SET source $temp
  ECHO $source
  DH5:graphics/picture

@{fg highlight}
     Len   (Length)
@{fg text}
 Len will return the length in bytes of the tested string.
Examples:
@{fg fill}
     Len >env:LONG "both"
     ECHO $LONG
     4

     SETENV LONG `LEN $TEMP`
     ECHO "$TEMP is $LONG characters in length"
@{fg text}
 Use VAL to convert the output of Len to a numeric value. Here are 
 some examples:
@{fg fill}
     IF VAL $LONG GT 2
     IF VAL $LONG EQ 14
     IF VAL $LONG GE 155
     IF VAL $LONG NOT GT 2
     IF VAL $LONG NOT EQ 14
     IF VAL $LONG NOT GE 155

@{fg text}

    The following three Extensions work together to allow you to separate
    the filename from it's path, and then reassemble them together. They
    were written so that a selection from rtFileRequest could be broken up,
    then reassembled with a new path or filename.

    Also see the description of rtFileRequest/BASENAME.

@{fg highlight}
     PathPart
@{fg text}

 PathPart will extract the path from a path/filename.

Example:
@{fg fill}
  SET EXAMPLE "Work:Fonts/topaz"
  PathPart >temp $EXAMPLE
  ECHO $temp
  Work:Fonts/
@{fg highlight}
     FilePart
@{fg text}
 FilePart will extract the filename from a path/filename.

Example:
@{fg fill}
  SET EXAMPLE "Work:Fonts/topaz"
  FilePart >temp $EXAMPLE
  ECHO $temp
  topaz
@{fg highlight}
     AddPart
@{fg text}
 AddPart will tack on a filename to a path. Syntax is checked and 
 corrected if necessary. The path can end with a slash or not.
Example:
@{fg fill}
  SET Example_path "Work:Fonts"
  SET Example_file "topaz"
  AddPart >temp $Example_path $Example_file
  ECHO $temp
  Work:Fonts/topaz
@{fg text}
