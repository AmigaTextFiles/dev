  @{u}Introduction@{uu}

The Environment Adaptive Graphic User Interface (EAGUI) is a system which
allows you to build interfaces that, as the name suggests, adapt to the
environment they're run in.

It uses normal GadTools and BOOPSI gadgets, and does not modify them in any
way. This allows programmers to implement EAGUI in existing applications
easily.

It also means that the library itself is very small, since it doesn't have to
re-implement all gadgets that are already there.

  @{u}Requirements@{uu}

EAGUI needs at least Release 2, because it makes use of a lot of its features.
It is Release 3 aware.

  @{u}Copyright@{uu}

EAGUI is Copyright © 1993, 1994 by Marcel Offermans and Frank Groen, and may
not be disassembled or reverse-engineered in any way. You may use this
software at your own risk. We cannot be held responsible for any damage it
might do. You may copy the original archive, but you're not allowed to rename
it or change its contents (to avoid confusion). Also, you may not charge
anything for it, other than the costs of the media it is on.

To install EAGUI, simply run the Install script. Click @{"here" system "Run <>NIL: Installer Install EAGUI"} if you want to run
the script now.

@node "Support" "Support for developers"

  @{u}Support for developers@{uu}

We support everybody that uses EAGUI as well as we can. We'll be happy to
answer any questions you might have. Currently, we're considering adding some
development tools to the system, but a lot will depend on the feedback we get.
After all, if nobody uses EAGUI, there's no point in supporting it.

At the moment, we've only used EAGUI to develop applications in C, but there
is no reason why it shouldn't work with any other language. If you use it in
any other language, and you've written header files for that language, we'd
like you to send them to us, so we can distribute them to other developers.

A Modula 2 interface for EAGUI has been written by Stefan Schulz. This
interface is now included in this archive. You can contact Stefan by e-mail at
the following address: schulz@rhrk.uni-kl.de

@node "Using" "Using EAGUI in your own software"

  @{u}Using EAGUI in your own software@{uu}

If you're a programmer, and you want to use EAGUI, please keep the following
in mind. Depending on the type of software you write, the conditions under
which you may use EAGUI differ. Basically, if you don't make any money out of
your program, we don't expect you to pay us in any way.

If you use it in any Public Domain or FreeWare software, you may use EAGUI for
free. The only thing we want you to do, is keep us informed of the fact that
you've used EAGUI.

If you use it in any ShareWare software, you must first contact us, to obtain
some kind of licence. Usually we'll settle for a free registration, or
something like that.

If you use it in any Commercial software, you must first contact us. We will
then work out a deal.

@node "future" "The future"

  @{u}The future@{uu}

Like most developers, we hope that these kinds of tools will some day be
integrated into the operating system. When designing EAGUI, we've tried to
anticipate what Commodore will do in future releases of the AmigaOS. As soon
as the new owners of the Amiga release a similar system, we encourage you to
use that instead, and will try to make a release of EAGUI that simple
interfaces to this system.
@endnode

@node "authors" "The authors"

  @{u}The authors@{uu}

We've tried to provide clear, readable documentation. Although it is not our
native language, we've chosen to write everything in english, because that
seems to be the de facto standard for most development documentation. If you
find parts of these documents difficult to understand, or if you discover any
type of mistakes, please report them to us. Also, we're always willing to
answer any questions you might have. If you've found a bug, please state as
clearly as possible how we can reproduce it, or under what circumstances the
bug surfaced, and what your system looks like (computer model, Kickstart
version, Workbench version, any programs running in the background). The more
detailed your bug report is, the better the chance we can fix it quickly.
We're also always looking for ways to enhance the system, so if you have any
suggestions, please mail them to us. Finally, if you don't like EAGUI, please
tell us what you think is wrong with it: we always listen to constructive
criticism.

  @{u}Development environment@{uu}

EAGUI is developed and tested under Release 3 only, simply because we don't
have any Amiga that uses Release 2 anymore. This does not mean that you need
Release 3 however. It does mean that there just might be bugs that surface
only under Release 2.

EAGUI is compiled using the excellent SAS/C® 6.51 compiler.

@node "Release" "Release history"

  @{u}Release history@{uu}

Releases are always made available on TADD, from where the archive can be
freq'ed. You can use the magic filename EAGUI, which will always get you the
latest release. TADD (2:281/614) can be reached at +31-15-157954 or
+31-15-144825. Releases will also appear on AmiNet sites (in the dev/gui
directory) from where you can FTP them. They will also be announced on
comp.sys.amiga.announce shortly afther they appear on AmiNet.

@{b}1.0 @{ub}- First release.

@{b}1.1 @{ub}- Corrected a lot of small mistakes in the documentation and sources, and
added a full example source (and executable), together with an IFF picture
file, which explains the relation between object border dimensions, offsets
and sizes. Also fixed a bug in ea_LayoutObjects(): Under certain
circumstances, object sizes weren't calculated correctly, and another bug
which caused a lot of Enforcer BYTE read hits. Furthermore, the
"EAGUI_protos.h" file was added. You need it to compile.

@{b}2.0 @{ub}- There were a few spelling errors in the documentation. They're corrected
now. Furthermore, the rendering method is now fully supported, which allows
you to design and use custom imagery (such as labels).

@{b}2.1 @{ub}- Bugfix. The GadTools button minsize method was broken. This release
fixes that.

@{b}2.2 @{ub}- Bugfix. There was a small mistake in the minsize method of Cycle
gadgets. Furthermore, for some GadTools gadgets, EAGUI got the default
position for the label wrong, which caused some strange results. Another
important modification is the roundoff error correction. Most of you won't
notice the difference, but some people complained about the method that was
used. It is now perfectly legal to use groups of objects where no object has a
weight. Furthermore, fixed size objects will never grow larger, not even a
pixel! :-)

@{b}2.3 @{ub}- Bugfix. I've corrected a mistake in the FD file. SAS/C's fd2pragmas
program ignored it, but perhaps other compilers don't. Reported by Norbert
Pueschel. Furthermore, checking the version of the library finally works
completely. For other library writers that use the SAS/C startup code and
SLink to link their libraries please note that the LIBID keyword must be
specified, and that it must at least contain "<name> <version>.<revision>" to
work. Installer for example checks only this version indication.
@{i}  This version was never released except for the library itself, which was @{ui}
@{i}  part of the Mandy distribution. @{ui}

@{b}3.0 @{ub}- Updated the distribution and modernized the documentation and
installation process. Furthermore, the concept of default values for classes
has been added to the library. To show the flexibility of EAGUI, we've also
added another example, which shows how to create the concept of pages.
