@NODE MAIN "Visual builder v1.0 alpha"

        Welcome to Visual builder v1.0
        
        WARNING!!!
        At this moment the builder and its documentation are still in
        an early alpha stage.
        This means that it still contains bugs and unimplemented features.
        I decided to release the whole project to the Amiga community
        because I couldn't find the time anymore to finish this program
        by myself.
        
        @{"Visual Builder" link WI_WHAT} is written and conceived by @{"Jan Klok" link WI_WHO} and
        is freeware. I can not be held responsible for any possible
        damage that results from the use or misuse of this software.
        blablabla...
        
        You may use this program for generating your own programs.
        If you do however, give the author credit where is due by
        mentioning that your program was generated by Visual Builder.
        It's doesn't even generate any code yet , so that should be
        no problem.

@NODE WI_WHAT "What is it?"

        This program is yet another gui builder for MUI.
        I started designing it at the time MUIBuilder seemed to have
        stopped developing.

        My main goal was to create a drag & drop driven, wysiwyg gui
        builder that does more than just creating the code for the gui,
        but could contain the complete application code.

        Unfortunatly I didn't even finish the first part due to lack
        of time. Since I have a son there's unfortunatly not much time
        left to spend behind my Amiga.

        I have written some basic documentation so that people who are
        interested in taking over this project can find out which goals
        I wished to reach. I still believe there are som cool idea's
        in there.

        As of now this program and it's source code is freeware.
        Do whatever you want with it.

        Feel free to contact @{"me" link WI_WHO} with any comments or questions.

@NODE WI_MAINWIN "Main window"

        This is the main window of Visual Builder.
        It consists of two major parts:

@ENDNODE

@NODE TOOLBAR "The toolbar"

        The toolbar gives you quick access to some of the most commonly
        used functions of the menu.
        
        At the moment only the 'Quit' and 'Help' button are implemented,
        but there is plenty of room for some more.
        
@ENDNODE

@NODE WI_TOOLBOX "The toolbox"

        Creating objects.
        
        The toolbox is where the creation of your gui objects starts.
        Simply drag one of the toolbarbuttons into one of your
        application windows. A new object of that type will be created
        on the fly.
        If you drop the new object on a group object you will have to
        choose between adding the new object in front of the group or
        append it as the last member to that group.
        
        Moving objects.
        
        All objects you have created in your application windows can
        also be moved by simply dragging them to another location in
        your application.
        If you drop the object to be moved on a group object you will
        have to choose between moving the object in front of the group
        or append it as the last member to that group.
          
        Removing objects.
        
        Every object in the gui can by removed by simply dragging it
        out of your application.
        If you wish you can also remove an object by selecting it and
        choosing the menuitem Edit - Delete.
        
@ENDNODE

@NODE WI_OBJECTS "The objects window"

        On the objects window you can examine and change the properties
        and the code attached to each of your gui elements.
        
        The objects window consists of two pages:
	@{"The properties page" link PROPERTIES } and @{"the code page"
        link CODE }.
  
@ENDNODE

@NODE PROPERTIES "The properties page"

        The properties page shows all the properties of the currently
        selected object. You can change any of the properties and push
        the 'Apply changes' button to immediatly see the changes.
        
@ENDNODE

@NODE CODE "The code page"

        The code page shows all the events that can be triggered for this
        object. For each event you can write a seperate piece of code.
