Short: Visual Builder v1.0 alpha
Type: dev/gui
Uploader: jklok@hotmail.com

This program is yet another gui builder for MUI.
I started designing it at the time MUIBuilder seemed to have stopped
developing.

My main goal was to create a gui builder that does more than just
creating the code for the gui, but could contain the complete application
code.

Unfortunatly I didn't even finish the first part due to lack of time.

I have written some basic documentation so that people who are interested
in taking over this project can find out which goals I wished to reach.

As of now this program and it's source code is freeware.
Do whatever you want with it.

Feel free to contact me with any comments or questions.
