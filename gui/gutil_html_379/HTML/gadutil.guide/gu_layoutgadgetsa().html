<B>   NAME</B>
	GU_LayoutGadgetsA -- Formats an array of GadTools gadgets.

<B>   SYNOPSIS</B>
	gad_info = GU_LayoutGadgetsA(gad_list, gadgets, screen, taglist)
	D0,A0                        A0        A1       A2      A3

	APTR GU_LayoutGadgetsA(struct <A HREF="text_include:intuition/intuition.h/main215.html">Gadget</A> **, struct LayoutGadget *,
		struct <A HREF="text_include:intuition/screens.h/main97.html">Screen</A> *, struct <A HREF="text_include:utility/tagitem.h/main31.html">TagItem</A> *);

<B>   FUNCTION</B>
	Creates a laid-out gadget list from a LayoutGadget array, which
	describes each gadget you want to create. Gadgets you create can
	be any of the gadget kinds supported by GadTools, as well as any
	of the extended gadget kinds provided by GadUtil.
	The gadgets created by this routine, can easily be defined so that
	they adjust their sizes and positions to accomodate fonts of any
	size, and also adapt to different locale strings.
	
<B>   INPUTS</B>
	gad_list - a pointer to the gadget list pointer. This will be
		   ready to pass to <A HREF="intuition/openwindowtaglist().html">OpenWindowTagList()</A> or <A HREF="intuition/addglist().html">AddGList()</A>.

	gadgets - an array of LayoutGadget structures. Each element in
		  the array describes one of the gadgets that you will
		  be creating. Each LayoutGadget structure in the array
		  should be initialized as follows:

		  lg_GadgetID - the ID for this gadget. An ID of -1
				terminates the array. Don't use gadget ID's
				in the range 65000(-536) to 65535 (-1). These
				may be used internally in later versions of
				GadUtil.

		  lg_LayoutTags - tags that describes each gadget to
				  create. These tags is used to calculate
				  positions, sizes and other attributes
				  of the created gadgets.

		  lg_GadToolsTags - additional tags for GadTools gadgets.
				    This would be the same set of tags that
				    you might pass to <A HREF="gadtools/creategadgeta().html">CreateGadgetA()</A> if
				    you were using GadTools directly.

		  lg_Gadget - the pointer to the <A HREF="text_include:intuition/intuition.h/main215.html">Gadget</A> structure created
			      for this gadget will be placed here. You
			      should initialize this field to NULL. The
			      gadget structure created should be considered
			      READ ONLY! This field will contain a pointer
			      to a struct BBoxData, if the created gadget
			      kind is a BEVELBOX_KIND or a LABEL_KIND.
			      PROGRESS_KIND gadgets will store a pointer to
			      a ProgressGad structure here.

		  Assembly language programmers can use the macro GADGET:

			GADGET GadgetID, Gad_LayoutTags, Gad_GadToolsTags

	screen - a pointer to the screen that the gadgets will be created
		 for. This is required, so that the layuot routines can
		 get display info about the screen where the rendering
		 will be done. Use <A HREF="intuition/lockpubscreen().html">LockPubScreen()</A> to use a public screen,
		 or <A HREF="intuition/openscreentaglist().html">OpenScreenTagList()</A>, if you want to use your own screen.

	taglist - pointer to an array of tags providing optional extra
		  parameters, or NULL.

                  These tags can be used here:

                    GU_RightExtreme (ULONG *)
                      A pointer to a longword that is used to store the
                      rightmost point that a gadget will exist in.

                    GU_LowerExtreme (ULONG *)
                      A pointer to a longword that is used to store the
                      lowermost point that a gadget woll exist in.

                    GU_Catalog (struct Catalog *)
                      A pointer to the programs translation catalog. NULL
                      indicates that the program should use the internal
                      strings. You must open the catalog by yourself (use
                      <A HREF="gu_opencatalog().html">GU_OpenCatalog()</A> or locale/OpenCatalog). The
                      GU_AppStrings tag MUST be used together with this tag.

                    GU_DefTextAttr (struct <A HREF="text_include:graphics/text.h/main66.html">TextAttr</A> *)
                      Specifies the default font to use with all gadgets. Can
                      be overridden with GU_TextAttr tag for each gadget.

                    GU_AppStrings (struct AppString *)
                      A pointer to an array of AppString structures. These
                      strutures contains the programs internal strings. This
                      tag must be used together with the GU_Catalog tag.

                    GU_BorderLeft (ULONG)

                    GU_NoCreate (BOOL)
                      Don't create any gadgets. Useful to determine if the
                      window will fit on the screen etc.

                    GU_MinimumIDCMP (ULONG *)
                      A pointer to a longword that is used to store the
                      minimum required IDCMP flags, so that all gadgets will
                      work. The longword can already be initialized, and any
                      new needed IDCMP flags will be appended to that
                      longword.

                    GU_DefWTitle (UBYTE *)
                      The text to show in the window title when the mouse pointer
                      is outside all objects (gadgets, strings, bevelboxes etc.)
                      that have a help string.

                    GU_DefLocWTitle (ULONG stringid)
                      Localized version of GU_DefWTitle. The ti_Data is a string ID

                    GU_DefLocSTitle (ULONG stringid)
                      Localized version of GU_DefSTitle. The ti_Data is a string ID
                      to be read from the locale catalog.

                    GU_DefHelpText (UBYTE *)
                      The text to show in the rest of the help display objects when
                      the mouse pointer is outside all objects that have a help

<B>   TAGS</B>

<B>   Tags for the gadgets lg_LayoutTags taglist. The other tags can be found in</B>
<B>   the autodoc to gadtools.library/CreateGadgetA().</B>

<B>   GU_GadgetKind (ULONG)</B>
      Can be any of the standard GadTools gadget kinds, or one of the
      extensions provided by GadUtil. Currently extended types are:

         IMAGE_KIND
           A gadget that uses an Intuition <A HREF="text_include:intuition/intuition.h/main621.html">Image</A> structure for its
           contents. Selected and unselected states can use different
           images. The images are centered automatically.

           The value in the LayoutGadget's lg_Gadget field is a pointer to
           a <A HREF="text_include:intuition/intuition.h/main215.html">Gadget</A> structure.

<A NAME="image_kind"></A>
           Extra tags for IMAGE_KIND:

              GUIM_Image (struct <A HREF="text_include:intuition/intuition.h/main621.html">Image</A> *)
                 <A HREF="text_include:intuition/intuition.h/main621.html">Image</A> for the gadget in its unselected state. This is
                 the only required (extra) tag for IMAGE_KIND gadgets.

              GUIM_SelectImg (struct <A HREF="text_include:intuition/intuition.h/main621.html">Image</A> *)
                 <A HREF="text_include:intuition/intuition.h/main621.html">Image</A> for the gadget in its selected state. If this tag
                 is omitted, the selected image will be the same as the
                 unselected, and only the border and the background color
                 will change (depending on the GUIM_BOOPSILook tag).

              GUIM_ReadOnly (BOOL)
                 TRUE to create a read-only image gadget.

              GUIM_BOOPSILook (BOOL)
                 This tag will allow the programmer to select how the
                 secondary image should be shown, if only one image is
                 used for the gadget. Defaults to TRUE, which means that
                 the background color will change when the user selects
                 the gadget.

<A NAME="drawer_kind"></A>
         DRAWER_KIND
           A "select drawer" image button. This can be used to select
           a path, but is often used to select files.

           The value in the LayoutGadget's lg_Gadget field is a pointer to
           a <A HREF="text_include:intuition/intuition.h/main215.html">Gadget</A> structure.

<A NAME="file_kind"></A>
         FILE_KIND
           A "select file" image button. This can be used to allow the
           user to select a file. Most programs uses the DRAWER_KIND
           for both file and path selection.

           The value in the LayoutGadget's lg_Gadget field is a pointer to
           a <A HREF="text_include:intuition/intuition.h/main215.html">Gadget</A> structure.

<A NAME="bevelbox_kind"></A>
         BEVELBOX_KIND
           A GadTools bevelbox. Use this to avoid the use of absolute
           sizing of bevelboxes. All bevel box kinds from OS3.0 is
           supported, even if the computer only has OS2.0.

           The function <A HREF="gu_refreshboxes().html">GU_RefreshBoxes()</A> can be used to redraw all
           bevelboxes.

           The value in the LayoutGadget's lg_Gadget field is a pointer to
           a BBoxData structure.

           Extra tags for BEVELBOX_KIND:

              GUBB_Recessed (BOOL)
                 Create a recessed ("pushed in") bevel box. Differs from
                 the GadTools tag GTBB_Recessed, in that it works with
                 both TRUE and FALSE as parameter. GadTools creates a
                 recessed box independent from the given value.

                 Defaults to FALSE.

              GUBB_FrameType (ULONG)
                 Determines what kind of box this function renders. The
                 current available alternatives are:

                                 a GadTools BUTTON_KIND gadget.

                    BFT_RIDGE - Generates a box like what is used around
                                a GadTools STRING_KIND gadget.

                    BFT_DROPBOX - Generates a box suitable for a standard
                                  icon drop box imagery.

                    BFT_HORIZBAR - Generates a horizontal shadowed line.
                                   Can also be used to draw a normal line,
                                   using 1 for the line's height.

                    BFT_VERTBAR - Generates a vertical shadowed line. Can
                                  also be used to draw a normal line, using
                                  1 for the line's width.

                 Defaults to BFT_BUTTON.

              GUBB_TextColor (ULONG)
                 Selects which color to print the title text in. Only useful
                 for a bevelbox with a title. Defaults to the color of the
                 TEXTPEN.

              GUBB_TextPen (ULONG)
                 Selects which pen to print the title text in. Only
                 useful for a bevelbox with a title. Defaults to TEXTPEN.

                 The initial current value of the progress requester. The
                 gadget's current value may be changed later by directly
                 modifying the pg_Current field of the ProgressGad structure.
                 Use GU_UpdateProgress to redraw the progress requester with
                 the new value. The pg_Current field must not be larger than
                 4.294.967.295 / the width of the progress gadget. A "normal"
                 width of 410 pixels allows a current value of 10.737.418.
		 Defaults to 0.

              GUPR_Total (ULONG)
                 The initial total value of the progress requester. The
                 gadget's total value may be changed later by directly
                 modifying the pg_Total field of the ProgressGad structure.
                 Use <A HREF="gu_updateprogress().html">GU_UpdateProgress()</A> to redraw the progress requester with
                 the new value. The total value can be as large as a longword
                 allows (4.294.967.295), but you can't display a current value
                 larger than 4.294.967.295 / the width of the progress gadget.
		 Defaults to 100.

<A NAME="label_kind"></A>
         LABEL_KIND
           A text label. Use this to avoid the use of absolute placement
           of text that you print into the window. Supports the most of
           the text placement and shadow flags for the BEVELBOX_KIND.

           The function <A HREF="gu_refreshboxes().html">GU_RefreshBoxes()</A> can be used to redraw all
           text created by LABEL_KIND gadgets.

           The value in the LayoutGadget's lg_Gadget field is a pointer to

         Changed tags, and additions to GadTools:

<A NAME="listview_kind"></A>
         LISTVIEW_KIND

           GTLV_ShowSelected (UWORD id)

              This tag was changed, so that you don't have to create the
              string gadget before all other gadgets. The difference from
              this tag in GadTools, is that we now have to give the ID of
              the string gadget to use to show the selected item.

              An example of a valid (and probably most useful) gadget to
              use for GTLV_ShowSelected:

              ShowSelGad:
                  dc.l    GU_GadgetKind,  STRING_KIND,    GU_AutoHeight,  4
                  dc.l    GU_DupeWidth,   GAD_LISTVIEW,   GU_GadgetText,  NULL
                  dc.l    TAG_DONE

              This gadget MUST be before the LISTVIEW gadget in the LayoutGadget
              array.

              Special:

              ti_Data = -1    Creates a read-only gadget below the listview,
                              same as for GTLV_ShowSelected, 0  for GadTools.

              ti_Data =  x    <A HREF="text_include:intuition/intuition.h/main215.html">Gadget</A> ID for the gadget that the selected item
                              should be displayed in. Same as GadTools reaction
                              on a gadget pointer in ti_Data.

              This gadget's ti_Data field will be changed during the creation
              of the gadget, but will be changed back before GU_LayoutGadgets
              returns.

<A NAME="mx_kind"></A>
         MX_KIND
          The gng_GadgetText field in the <A HREF="text_include:libraries/gadtools.h/main93.html">NewGadget</A> structure can be used
          even with MX_KIND gadgets. This should have been included in
          GadTools. The gadget text will always be placed ABOVE the gadget,
          on the same side as the other texts for the gadget. Positions are
          checked against WBPattern &amp; SerialPrefs to get them "right". The
          GU_GadgetText and GU_LocaleText tags are used to access this field.

      GU_HelpGadget (ULONG)
         GadgetID of the TEXT_KIND or the STRING_KIND to show the gadget's
         help text in. There exists two "special" GadgetID's that can be
	 used with this tag:

	 WINTITLE_HELP - shows the help text in the windows's titlebar.

	 SCRTITLE_HELP - shows the help text in the screen's titlebar.

	 These tags won't work if your window doesn't use the WFLG_REPORTMOUSE
	 (or the tag WA_ReportMouse, TRUE). The IDCMP is handled automatically
	 if you use the layout tag GU_MinimumIDCMP, otherwise you'll have to
	 use IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE in your IDCMP mask.

	 Beginning with v37.9 of GadUtil, it is possible to set default strings
	 for the help display objects. See the explanation of the tags passed to
	 this function (the taglist parameter) for more info about the default
	 strings.

      GU_HelpText (UBYTE *)

         PLACETEXT_BELOW - Place the gadget label centered below the gadget.

         PLACETEXT_IN - Place the gadget label centered inside the gadget.

         NG_HIGHLABEL - Highlight the label (render it using SHINEPEN).

      *** GU_UserData (APTR) *** REMOVED in v37.7 ***

      GU_LocaleText (ULONG stringid)
         Get gadget label from a catalog. This allows easy localization of
         all new programs.


<B>   RESULT</B>
	gad_info - a pointer to a private structure. You must keep this
		   value and pass it to <A HREF="gu_freelayoutgadgets().html">GU_FreeLayoutGadgets()</A> later on
		   in order to free up all resources used by your gadgets.
		   This pointer is also used in a lot of other functions
		   in this library.

	The UserData pointer of all created gadgets will contain a pointer
	to a GU_Public structure. You can use this structure to obtain some
	info about the gadget, such as current, max and minimum values.
	The gu_MaxVal, gu_MinVal, and gu_Active fields are kind specific:

	MX_KIND:	gu_Active = the selected entry (GTMX_Active)
			gu_MaxVal = number of choices - 1
			gu_MinVal = 0

	SLIDER_KIND:	gu_Active = the selected value (GTSL_Level)
			gu_MaxVal = maximum allowed value (GTSL_Max)
			gu_MinVal = minimum allowed value (GTSL_Min)

	CYCLE_KIND:	gu_Active = the selected entry (GTCY_Active)
			gu_MaxVal = number of choices - 1
			gu_MinVal = 0
	
	SCROLLER_KIND:	gu_Active = the top value (GTSC_Top)
			gu_MaxVal = the total value (GTSC_Total)
			gu_MinVal = number visible in scroller (GTSC_Visible)

	LISTVIEW_KIND:	gu_Active = the selected entry (GTLV_Selected)
			gu_MaxVal = number of nodes in list - 1
			gu_MinVal = number of visible entries

	PALETTE_KIND:	gu_Active = the selected color (GTPA_Color)
			gu_MaxVal = the maximum color number that can be
			            selected (GTPA_NumColors, GTPA_Depth^2-1)
			gu_MinVal = 0

	STRING_KIND:	gu_Active = pointer to the string buffer

	TEXT_KIND:	gu_Active = pointer to the displayed string

	INTEGER_KIND:	gu_Active = the current displayed/editable number. This
			            value is _not_ updated if the gadget is
			            deactivated by clicking outside it.

	NUMBER_KIND:	gu_Active = the current displayed number

	These values are initialized upon creation of the gadget, and updated
	automatically when using GU_GetIMsg and	GU_SetGadgetAttrsA.

<B>   NOTES</B>
	You must be careful with the taglist in the lg_LayoutTags field.
	Tags are processed sequentally in the order you give them in, and
	if a tag references another gadget (eg. the GU_TopRel tag), then
	processing of the current gadget halts while the referenced gadget
	is processed (if it has not already been processed). Problems can
	occur if this gadget refers back to the original gadget that
	referenced if, if it is referring to a field that has not yet been
	processed in that gadget.

        Also note that you do not have to specify any tags that do not
        change from gadget to gadget. Just be sure that you know in which
	order the gadgets are processed (eg. relatives etc).

	Another thing to note, is that we have tried to make the processing
	of position and width / height tags as usable as possible, what I
	mean with this, is that if you eg first define the left edge and
	then define the right edge, the width will change. BUT, there are
	special cases when this isn't true. This is because we have tried
	out this and decided that this was the best way to do it.

	Here comes some examples of the special cases;

	dc.l	GU_AlignLeft, GAD_1	; Left edge aligned with GAD_1's left.
	dc.l	GU_AlignRight, GAD_2	; This stretches the gadget, so that
					; both the left and right edges are
					; positioned as defined.
	; Then, if we want to move the right edge 2 pixels right, and the left
	; edge two pixels right, we might try this:

	dc.l	GU_AddLeft, -2		; This works as we want, it moves the
					; left edge to the right place, but it
					; also moves the whole gadget two
					; pixels left..

	dc.l	GU_AddRight, 2		; &lt;- This is a common mistake. This
					; moves the whole gadget to the right.
					; Ie. it is moved back to the old
					; position, not as we wanted...

	; But if we replace the previous line with the following;

	dc.l	GU_AddWith,4		; This works just as we wanted it to.
					; Now the gadget should be 4 pixels
					; wider, two to the left and two to
					; the right.

	The same goes for GU_AddHeight and GU_AddBottom etc.

	This is actually a feature. Sometimes you might want to move the whole
	button, so we made it work this way.
