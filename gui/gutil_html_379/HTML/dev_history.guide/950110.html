	* Changed BEVELBOX_KIND to work better with different fonts.

	* Now diskfont.library is also opened by gadutil.library. If it's not
	  found DiskFontBase is set to NULL, but everything still will work as
	  before.

	* Changed text_width to use OpenDiskFont to make sure that the font is
	  loaded into memory. The font is closed right after it's opened.
	  IntuiTextLength requires that the specified font is in the memory.
	  This sometimes created weird gadgets when changing the font.

	* Created new border types for BEVELBOX_KIND gadgets:

		- BFT_HORIZBAR - A horizontal line with a shadow. The minimum
				required height to make the line look "right"
				is 2 pixels, but a smaller height can be used
				to draw a unshadowed line.

				Can have a text, which is automatically placed
				on the middle of the line's length and starts
				at the line's Y-position + 1, or if the height
				is more than 2 pixels, at the line's Y-pos.

		- BFT_VERTBAR  - A vertical line with a shadow. The minimum
				required width to make the line look "right"
				is 4 pixels, but a smaller value can be used
				to create some weird effects.

		Both of these types can be inverted with GUBB_Recessed, TRUE.
