<PRE>

        Depending on which archive you downloaded, you will either have one or three
        ways to install the complete package, or parts of it on your system.

        User archive installation:
          Double click on the Install_User icon. This will install gadutil, using the
          standard installation program by Commodore / Escom. If you don't select
          "Novice User", you can select which parts to install. You'll only have 4
          options here:

          The library file    - the only file that is necessary to install
          The debug version   - useful to trace problems in programs that uses GU
          User documentation  - this guide file
          Aminet .readme file - the readme files for both user and developer archive

        Developer archive installation:
          Double click on the Install icon. This will install gadutil, using the
          standard installation program by Commodore / Escom. If you don't select
          "Novice User", you can select which parts to install. Select which "kind"
          of user/programmer you are, and the installation script will fill in some
          defaults to which parts to install. The next (up to) 10 pages will let you
          change the default selected parts for the user selection you did earlier.

        Include file installation/removal:
          A little shell script is included for fast installation/removal of includes.
          This script will also allow you to edit the include files (don't spread
          edited includes around you, send them to us if you find any bug).

          The script makes use of AskEnv to make it look like a "real" program. You
          will probably have to change the editor path/command in the end of the
          InstallInc.gad file before running the script. Double click the InstallInc
          gadget to start the program.

          Type in the path for your 'C' and/or assembly language include files (if you
          use the selector gadget at the left of the string, you may have to edit it
          by hand afterwards).

          To install includes: select your 'C' compiler or Asm package, and press the
          "Install..." gadget.

          To remove the includes, you don't have to select the compiler or assembler
          type, just press "Remove...".

          To edit the includes just press one of the "Edit ... files" gadgets at the
          bottom of the window.
