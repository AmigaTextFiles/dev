CLI2WB_RealPlayerInfo.txt

CLI2WB_RealPlayerInfo is configured with use of RealPlayerInfo, a
program that shows the taginfo of Realmedia files. It's also
programmed by me, amigaharry.
Note that the tooltype Rf_pattern=#?.(ra|ram|rm|rmj) is set, which
causes that the {Rf} load requester only shows the Realmedia files.
The Realmedia files always ended with .ra .ram .rm .rmj
The tooltype TakeCareSpaces=No because RealPlayerInfo reads names
with spaces properly. Don't change it to TakeCareSpaces=YES then
RealPlayerInfo don't work correctly.
