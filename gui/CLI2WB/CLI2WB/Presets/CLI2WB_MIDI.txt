CLI2WB_MIDI.txt

Here you see that CLI2WB is configured with use of GMPlay, a
good MIDI music files player. You can find it at Aminet.
The tooltype in the CLI2WB icon Rf_MULTISELECT=Yes is set, that
means that you can choose multiple MIDI files in the {Rf} load
requester that appears when you start CLI2WB_MIDI. In the load
requester press the left shift button and click with the mouse
on the desired MIDI music files to play, or click with the left
mousebutton and move over the files, which becomes highlighted.
Note, that also the tooltype Priority=21 is set.
Pressing the button named PlayMIDI in the requester causes that
all choosed MIDI files are played. The left button name can be 
found in the tooltype Rf_button=PlayMIDI For ease, the tooltype
CloseOnExit=YES is set, which removes the window after played
all MIDIs. Changes the tooltypes for your needs, Amigaharry
