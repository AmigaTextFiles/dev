CLI2WB_ZIPextract.txt

CLI2WB_ZIPextract is configured with use of C:unzip, a dearchiver
of zip compressed files. Unzip can be found at Aminet.
AmigaDOS=C:unzip {Rf} -d {Rd} is the tooltype to launch Unzip from
the Workbench. First, the {Rf} load requester appears, you can
select a zip file here. Then the {Rd} drawers only requester
appears, you can only select one directory here, it is the
destination directory where the zipfile is unpacked. The tooltype
TakeCareSpaces=YES is set, it is needed, because Unzip can't handle
Ram Disk ,a name with contains spaces. Unzip is unable to close
the window that's defined in the tooltype:
WINDOW=CON:10/20/450/100/ZIP extract output/AUTO/CLOSE ,so we set
also the tooltype CloseOnExit=YES !
