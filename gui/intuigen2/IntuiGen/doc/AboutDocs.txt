About IntuiGen docs:

There are two sets of documents included with IntuiGen.  They are textually
identical, however the ones ending with ".guide" are designed to be used
with the AmigaGuide hypertext utility or Release 3's MultiView program.

The one's ending in .txt are flat text files, and can be viewed with the
viewer of your choice.

It is recommended that you delete the set of files which you do not use
off your hard disk to save space.
