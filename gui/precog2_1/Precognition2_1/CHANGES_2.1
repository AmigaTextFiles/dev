First a notice from Edward D. Berger:

*************************  IMPORTANT NOTICE  *****************************
ALL FILES have been changed, since the previous releases of Precognition.
Anything previously created with Precognition is practically guaranteed
to not function with this update.  All further updates by Edward D. Berger
will most likely NOT be compatible with this release.  You have been
warned!  I reserve the right to not develop Precognition any further, as
I have a lot of design decisions that need to be made before using this
seriously, but it is a good 'educational tool' for now.

I'm not particually happy releasing Precognition in this current state
but feel forced to due to circumstances.
**************************************************************************

Bug fixes and changes for Precognition 2.1

BUGS FIXED:
 1.) Missing GadgetUp events in toolwindow loses drop object command
 2.) Changed OutlineBox and ScrollerList to use Topaz80 font as default
      like all other text labels.
 3.) Created new function for getting correct pens on 1 bitplane screens
     (2D style full borders) StandardScreenPens( *whichscreen );
 4.) Rapid Window (Rapid Sizing Changes) Refresh causes intuition lock-ups
      removed RefreshWindowFrame(); function from pcgWindow.c Refresh function
     This must now be called explicitly from resized windows after they
     RectFill themselves to restore the border.
 5.) Missed GadgetUp events in builderwindow loses drop object command
 6.) Could move or resize objects beyond current window view, losing parts or
      all of them (with no way to bring them back). Now all drag/move/size
      changes are limited to the viewable area inside the window borders.
 7.) FileRequester showed files named ".info" when it should have filtered
      them out added test for filename = 5 chars as well as > 5 chars.
 8.) FileRequester got confused when ParentDir or directory,directory is
      chosen (wouldn't allow selection)


MISC. CHANGES:
 added various casts and includes to reduce compiler warning messages
 Added MultiWindowWriter to src/builder smakefile
      created new linker with file for MultiWindowWriter (writer.lnk)
      added patchobjects() to mwcw.c file so it could read projects
 Added routines to check for AmigaDOS 2.1, 3.0, and 3.1 to intuition_utils.c
      (not yet tested)
 Added Default Font attribute SetDefaultFont method to GraphicObjectClass
      (still need to propogate changes to all other classes)
 Changed pcg_FileRequester to use SIZEBBOTTOM to look more like ASL
 Changed default BuilderWindow SIZING FLAG to SIZEBBOTTOM for symmetry
 Changed layout of Builder/MultiWindowWriter Source tree
 Bumped up Version number to 2.1 for Builder's main.c & do_AboutWindow.c
 Added to and revised copyright notice in do_AboutWindow.c
 Minor SMakefile changes
 Put AmigaDOS version strings into MultiWindowWriter and precognition.lib
 Changed Builder name to Precognition to match AboutWindow and version string
 Changed default tool for MakeIcon to "Precog:Precognition"
 Renamed linker library source directory to Library, and Builder's to
    Precognition
 Added AmigaDOS script to src directory for building whole package with SAS/C
 Added  New Style Menu support for Amiga OS 3.0 with new function
   SmartOpenWindow() in intuition_utils.c & runtime changes in pcg_Menus.c
   with is_Workbench_3();
 Misc reformatting of source code in places so I found it more readable.
 Added doubleclick selection method to file requester.
 Added doubleclick on object to pop up edit object properties window.
   Changed Menu short cut to Amiga-I (Object Props/Info),
   as Amiga-P should be reserved for Print according to the style guide
 Changed intuition_utils's SetWaitPointer() to use system standard wait
   pointer under Amiga OS 3, instead of the custom one to follow prefs.
 Changed intuition_utils's SmartOpenScreen() to use SA_LikeWorkbench tag
   under 3.0 should add changes for 2.0 AmigaDOS to do similarly.
 Added Makefiles for DICE 3.0  & GCC 2.6.1 + minor changes to sources for
   compatibility with those two compilers
   Still some problems:
       GCC doesn't do __chip for images used by icons/pointers.
       DICE compiled builder program crashes upon window closings.
