The Precognition "Builder" program generates code for a single window'ed
application.  I've had a number of requests to do multiple windows.
The "right" way to do this would be from within the Builder program, but
that would require re-writing massive amounts of the Builder, and I'm not
sufficiently motivated to do that.

So instead I've written "MultiWindowWriter", which will generate the source
code for a multi-window application.

How It Works:

1) Using the Builder program, design each window individually (Make sure 
   you give each window a different variable name!), and save each
   one to a file.  Do not generate code.

2) Run MultiWindowWriter in the directory where you want the code generated.
   Add the filenames of all the Precognition window files into the scrolling
   list.  (Either type them, or use the "File Requestor..." button.)

   Click "Write the code...".

   MultiWindowWriter will generate a "main.c" file, and one ".c" and
   one ".h" file for each window in the application.
   
NOTES:

   By default, closing any of the application's windows quits the program.
   To get rid of this behavior, you need to remove the line
   
      Done = TRUE;
   
   In the window's "<WindowName>_Respond()" function.
