         SUMMARY OF CHANGES

=== Version 1.07 - Feb 1994 ================================

Builder source code added to distribution.

Renamed typedef 'Class' to 'PClass', because Amiga OS rev 2 has
a 'Class' typedef in it.

Precognition.lib removed from distribution, and makefiles to
generate it substituted.  (Previous experience has shown that
only people using the same rev. of SAS C as myself can use the
precognition.lib.  Better to let them recreate it.


=== Version 1.06 - December 1993 ================================

Cut/Copy/Paste added (finally!)

Generates more code for ScrollingLists.
By far, the most common question I get in email is "How do I find out
which item is selected in a scrollinglist?"  So now the Builder
automatically generates the code to do this.

Added feature to return dragged object to its source if the area where
it's dropped can't accept it.  (Drag a button onto the background
screen and see what happens)

Fixed bug which caused an enforcer hit on the the "About..." window.
(Amazing what the lack of one prototype can cause.)

=== Version 1.05 - March 1993 ===================================

Fixed bug where WindowFlags (CLOSEWINDOW, etc.) were not correctly
saved and retrieved from files.

Fixed bug which caused a cyclegadget with no label to omit printing
its choice string.

Fixed bug which caused crash/enforcer hit when saving a slider/scroller
with no label.

No more overwriting existing source files. When generating .c files, if
a previous version of "file.c" exists, then the previous version is
renamed "file.c,1" (or "file.c,2", or ",3" or whatever necessary to
come up with a new name).  This way if you made modifications to the
source (/* YOUR CODE HERE */), you don't lose the old source.  (You
still have to cut&paste though.)

(Cosmetic) Replaced "~~~~~~" menu dividers with 'real' dividers.

=== Version 1.04 - January 1993 ===================================

Fixed an enforcer hits for BoolGadet reading.

Fixed bug which caused system to lock-up after displaying an error
message.

Fixed bug in IFF reader which didn't report failure when it couldn't
understand a file.

Now saves icons.

=== Version 1.03 - January 1993 ===================================

Fixed enforcer hits in StringGadget I/O and code generation.

Fixed bug in CycleGadget editor where choices would keep accumulating.

Fixed bug which displayed on error message on Reading when in fact
the file was read correctly.

=== Version 1.02 - January 1993 ===================================

Added capability to save a window to a file and reload it.

Optimized 'drag' routines so that objects don't fall behind the mouse on
68000-based Amigas.

=== Version 1.01 - December 1992 ==================================

Plugged memory leaks in library and builder.

Eliminated all known enforcer hits.

Fixed bug in builder where changing the size of a VSlider or VScroller
caused text to be mis-aligned.

Renamed typedef 'Object' to 'PObject', because Amiga OS rev 2 has
an 'Object' in it.

Renamed function Enable() to EnableIactor() because AmigaDOS has an
Enable() function already.

Changed code generator to make a 'main' function.

Changed code generator to break the 'do_window()' function up
into separate _Init(), _CleanUp(), _Respond(), and _EventLoop()
functions.

Created 'Precognition.lib' to replace 'Precognition.o'.

Changed source to avoid all uses of 'malloc' and 'free', which
should (I hope) make it possible for non-SAS C users to link
to the library.

Changed distribution layout to have 'include', 'lib' subdirectories.

Included source to library in 'source' subdirectory.


=== Version 1.00 - December 1991 ===================================

Original release.
