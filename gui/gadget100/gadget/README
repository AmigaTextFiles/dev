   To install gadget.library you have to execute the following:

      copy gadget.library libs:

   Now, programs which use the library will find it in the libs: directory.
   You can now execute the examples in the demo directory.

   If you want to write programs which use the gadget.library you have to
   execute the following:

      copy gadget.h        your_include_directory/libraries/
      copy gadget_lib.h    your_include_directory/pragma/
      copy gadget.lib      your_lib_dir/

   Note that this only work for Aztec-C users correctly. If you have annother
