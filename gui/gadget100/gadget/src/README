In this directory you find the soucre code of gadget.library.
To compile the stuff you must have the following programs:

   make
   protos         (included in the distribution)
   sed

Warning! This Makefile is very complex. If you want to know what make does
use the -n option of make.

To compile gadget.library type:   make protos
This will generate a .pro file for each .c file.

Now type:   make library
This will compile all files and build gadget.library and gadget.lib.
Remember to use the large data model so register a4 is never used and
you don't need geta4 calls in your own programs.
The linker needs a library called amigal.lib. In this library there are
only OS 2.0 specific vararg stub functions. You should have this library.
If not use amigal.lib in this directory.

Then the following actions take place:
   copy gadget.lib   Prog:Aztec/lib/
   copy gadget.library  libs:
   copy gadget.h     Prog:Aztec/include/Libraries
   copy gadget_lib.h Prog:Aztec/include/pragma/
   avail flush

Perhaps the new gadget.library is not already available because the old one
is still in memory. Use xoper or artm to look if gadget.library is in
memory. If so, quit all programs which use gadget.library then type
"avail flush" to remove gadget.library. If this does not work reboot.

Debugging gadget.library is not easy. Type "make debug" to get
a test program which can be debugged with the Manx sdb. The test
program does not use calls to gadget.library, instead the code
of gadget.library is in the test program itself. Edit test.c to
make your own test program.

You are allowed to modify the source code. If you have any ideas, new
gadgets (e.g. an Editor Gadget), etc. just implement it and send me
the new source code so I can put it into the distribution.
