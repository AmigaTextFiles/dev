    This  directory  contains  the  M2Amiga support files for Triton, done by
Stefan  Schulz  (schulz@rhrk.uni-kl.de).   These  files are not subject to my
copyright  on  the  Triton  package.   See the individual files for copyright
notices.

    - TritonD.def : Data definitions for triton.library
    - TritonL.def : Interface to triton.library
    - Demo.Mod    : Nonfunctional user interface for demonstration
    - Demo2.Mod   : Nonfunctional user interface for demonstration

    Note that there is no way to support the macros defined in the C includes
for  easier  interface  creation, as text macros are not supported by M2Amiga
(yet?).
