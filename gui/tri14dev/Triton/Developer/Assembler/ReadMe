    This  directory  contains  the assembly language support code for Triton,
done  by  Oskar  Liljeblad  (ol@melange.ct.se).   The  assembler  support  is
currently at the level of Triton release 1.1.  Changes to the C includes made
in  release  1.2  have not yet been included (*).  The assembler support code
for  Triton  has  been  testet with the SAS assembler but it should work with
other assemblers, too.

    - triton_lib.i      : Offsets for the triton.library functions (*)
    - triton.i          : Translation of libraries/triton.h
    - trLogo.asm        : Translation of trLogo.c
    - triton_lib_v2.i   : Offsets for the triton.library v2 functions (*)

    (*)  triton_lib.i  is  basically the same as triton_lib_v2.i.  It was not
created  by  Oskar  Liljeblad,  but is instead maintained automatically using
fd2AsmInc  by  Hanns  Holger  Rutz.   Thus  it  will always be up to date.  I
renamed Oskar's triton_lib.i to triton_lib_v2.i
