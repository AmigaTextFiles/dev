    This  directory  contains the AmigaE support files for Triton, which were
created  by  Frank  Verheyen  (hi910097@beta.ufsia.ac.be).   Except  for  the
modules in the 'Modules' directory, these files are currently at the level of
Triton release 1.1.  New features of Triton 1.2 have not been ported yet.

    The  directory 'Modules' contains up-to-date modules for AmigaE which are
maintained   automatically   using   FDtom  by  Detlef  Riekenberg  (FidoNet:
2:241/1025.9).

    Finally some comments from Frank's original ReadMe:

    To  use  Triton,  you need macros.  And when you say macros in AmigaE you
say  Mac2E.   For  convenience  I  made a new compilation script for CygnusEd
which  invokes  Mac2E transparantly through the program Mac2EFront.  You just
have to put Mac2E and Mac2EFront into 'E:bin/'.

    The  demo  for AmigaE does NOT treat all kinds of gadgets that Triton can
make,  because  Stefan's  demo already shows everything Triton can do.  In my
demo,  you  can  find  the  basics of gadget-handling through Triton, and all
other  gadget  types  are  just  about  the  same.   I demonstrate the use of
buttons,  string  gadgets, progress requesters, cycle gadgets, requesters and
listview gadgets using AmigaE.

    The  demo  does  not just put some gadgets on your screen and quit if you
touch some button (which is what most demos actually do, so that figuring out
how  to handle the messages and stuff stays undemonstrated...  :) It tries to
demonstrate some reasonable gadget-handling, performing a progress demo and a
complete listview handler.

    I hope it gives you a good idea of handling Triton gadgets.
