This is the third public release of my GadLayout.  I got encouraging
feedback from the first release, unfortunatly, it seems that the DICE
object file didn't really want to link with anything else.  So to make for 
the least hassle, I decided I might as well release the source.  BEFORE
YOU USE THE SOURCE, PLEASE READ THE CONDITIONS FOR USING IT!!!  THIS IS
IMPORTANT!!!  The source has NOT been released so that you can go off and
do anything you like with it!

The source currently only compiles with DICE and will probably need some
modifications to other compilers.  When you do this, please bracket
compiler dependent code with proper #ifdefs, as I'd like to have a
multi-compiler source file.  If you want to port this to other languages
such as assembler or Modula-2, that's fine, just remember to send me the
source.

Of note, programmes using GadLayout seem to require a stack of around
8000 bytes, so if you find it crashing on you, raise your stack a little.

I'm thinking of doing a major overhaul of GadLayout, including the addtion
of event handling, new gadget kinds, etc.  I'd like to get some feedback
on how useful this would be to people, and also from those who would like
to help (eg. by writing BOOPSI classes that could be included).

That's about all I want to say for now, hope you find GadLayout useful, I
most certainly have!
