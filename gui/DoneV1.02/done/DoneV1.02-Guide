@node about "About Done"

 Done is by Stuart Kelly Copyright 1996 ©

 I wrote Done because I needed a way of showing the progress of my
 programs.  Later I decided to give Done away so they can use it in there
 programs.  It has an Abort button so you can detect if a user wants to
 abort during a task.

 Done is not that hard to use, and looks ok.

 Done V 1.02 is not that use.  It has an Abort button so you can detect
 if somebody wants to abort and supports the following @{fg shine}IDCMP@{fg text} flags:-
 
 @{fg shine}IDCMP_GADGETUP@{fg text} -------- For detecting When prople press Abort.
 @{fg shine}IDCMP_INTUITICKS@{fg text} ------ For doing something.
 @{fg shine}IDCMP_INACTIVEWINDOW@{fg text} -- For telling if the window is inactive.  This is
                         needed because @{fg shine}IDCMP_INTUITICKS@{fg text} doesn't work when
                         a window is incative.

 If you would like Done to support other IDCMP flags in the future then
 write_to/e-mail me at these @{" addresses " link address}.

@node use4 "Example Code"
@toc use

 There are two examples that come with Done V 1.02, test1.c and test2.c.

 View @{" test.c  " link "test.c/MAIN"}
 View @{" test2.c " link "test2.c/MAIN"}

 To compile test.c using Dice just execute the @{" compile.test " link "compile.test/MAIN"} script.
 To compile test2.c using Dice just execute the @{" compile.test2 " link "compile.test2/MAIN"} script.

 To use DoneV1.02 you must include the @{" done.h " link "done.h/MAIN"} with your program.
 And @{fg shine}done.o@{fg text} be linked with your program.

 Example using Dice By Matthew Dillion:-

 @{fg shine}dcc:bin/dcc my_prog.c done/done.o -o my_prog.exe@{fg text}

 This would link @{fg shine}done.o@{fg text} with @{fg shine}my_prog.exe@{fg text}.
