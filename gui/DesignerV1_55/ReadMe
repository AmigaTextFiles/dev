                              The Designer V1.55
                              
18 May 2002

I havent looked at this code in almost 8 years, but I have just received 
a letter asking if it was still available to purchase - quite surprising!                              

Anyway, I am now releasing V1.55 of the Designer, the last version by me,
with all the protection disabled. Not that the protection proved to be 
much good anyway, I actually had people write to me telling me how they 
got around it...

I am also distributing the source, so if anyone can understand it (I 
can't anymore), and has HSPascal, please help yourself.

I am not offering any support for two simple reasons, I just dont have 
the time, and I can hardly remember enough to build this release, so 
please dont contact me with any questions.

If anyone really does want to contact me then you can use

                              The Designer V1.54

                             (C) Ian OConnor 1994

  This program is copyright (C) Ian OConnor 1994. You may distribute the
 demo version as freely as you like as long as you do not charge more than
 a reasonable fee to do so. You may not, however, change any of the files
 supplied , other than to compress them, and any distribution must include
 them all in full.
  You may not distribute the full registered version of the Designer at
 all. The demo version has 'Demonstration Version' written in the about
 window. This software is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind,
 either expressed or implied. The author is not responsible for any damage
 or loss of data due to use of this program, these are solely the users
 concern.
  Registered users can upgrade their programs using the demo version by
 clicking on an extra button in the main window which does not appear on
 registered versions. See Designer.Guide, upgrading, for more info.
  Here is a list of all the files in the distribution, use the Install
 utility to copy the ones you wish to your Designer drawer. You only need
 the Producer you require and the Designer itself so floppy use is
 possible.
  To install on floppy use the install utility to copy The Designer, the
 Guide and one Producer of your choice.

                 Install           : Installer utility, run to install.
                 Readme            : This file.
                 Designer          : The program, you probably want this.
                 Designer.Guide    : Help file, not necessary but helpful.
                 AsmProducer       : Program required to produce Asm
                                     source.
                 CProducer         : Program required to produce C source.
                 PasProducer       : Program required to produce Pascal
                                     source.
                 producer.library  : Common Producer functions, required
                 Developer         : A few files to help you on your way.
  Demos :        AllKindsDemo      : All gadgets supported demonstrated.
                 ToggleDemo        : Toggle buttons.
                 KeyDemo           : Demo of keyboard shortcuts.
                 MultipleDemo      : Demo using multiple copies of windows.
                 LocaleDemo        : Demo using several languages.
                 ShowIconDemo      : AppWindow demonstration.
                 ScreenDemo        : Demo of Designer screen creation.
                 PubScreenDemo     : Demo of Public screen use.
                 SuperBitMapDemo   : SuperBitMap window you can draw on.
                 BOOPSIDemo        : BOOPSI object demo.

  All the files must be in the same drawer as the Designer, except the
 demos and the library.
  A preferences file will be stored on your boot disk if you Save
 preferences, when run from this boot disk in future these preferences
 will be loaded. You will probably want to do this to get rid of the
 About Window on running.
  The demo version is virtually identical to the registered version but
 the Save option on the Designer itself is partially disabled. To obtain
 the full version send 25 pounds sterling to this address :

        Ian OConnor
        Removed as out of date
      
  I will then send you a full version of the designer as soon as possible.
 This will be approximately the same as the demo version with the save
 fully enabled.
  The money must be in a cheque or money order in sterling and drawable on
 a UK bank, please allow some time for delivery. The cost includes postage
 and packing, airmail if outside UK. Please state your address clearly.
  Their is no time limit on the demo, you may use it as much as you like,
 but you may not edit any of the files or re-distribute them in any form
 other than the origonal distribution. EuroCheques in sterling are fine.
  To produce the full demos source you cannot use the Generate option in
 the Demo Designer because this saves the current data and will not save
 it all .You must use the producers from the Shell or Workbench with the
 filenames as parameters or selected respectively.
  If you find any bugs or have any comments to make then send them to me
 at the above address or email ijo1000@cus.cam.ac.uk , this is only
 valid until summer 1995. I will not be available over christmas or easter
 holidays.
  I hope you enjoy using this program and think it worthwhile
