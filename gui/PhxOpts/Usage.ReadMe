Run PhxOpts to set options for compiling and use the script Phx to do the compiling.
Script Phx adds the options set by PhxOpts to the end of the command line you give
it on the cli. Normal setup would be to place PhxOpts in C: and Phx in S:

PhxOpts is freeware and provided for you by G-Men Projects on November 1998.
