@Node Introduction "Introduction"
Introduction

The  GUIFront preferences editor is a utility which allows you to customize
the  visual appearance of GUIFront applications.  For example, you can tell
an  application  use  a  particular  font,  or  change  the  color of frame
headlines for another application.  Or a combination of those, of course.

See the section on @{"usage" LINK Usage} for a complete description of all features.

@Node Installation "Installation"
Installation

The  GUIFront  preferences editor installs very easily.  Simply copy it and
its  icon  into the directory or drawer where you want it.  If you want the
editor  to run localized, you must also copy the necessary catalog files to
your LOCALE:  directory.

Two  versions  of  the  editor have been provided.  One runs on all Amigas,
while  the  other  requires  an  Amiga with at least a 68020 processor.  To
maximise  efficiency  you  should  install  the  version which most closely
matches the CPU in your machine.

I  shouldn't  have  to say this, but just in case anyone's wondering - yes,
you do need the guifront.library to use the preferences editor :)

Like  the  GUIFront  library  itself, the GUIFront editor requires at least
AmigaDOS 2.04.

In  case you are still confused, simply let one of the installation scripts
do the work for you.

@Node Usage "Usage"
Usage

The GUIFront preferences editor allows you to change almost all GUI related
aspects of a GUIFront application. It also allows you to define a "default"
setting,  which  new applications automatically inherit when they are first
run.

To  use the editor, either double-click on it's icon, or activate it from a
shell. You should see the main editing window pop up.

The  listview  gadget  contains a list of active applications.  To edit the
preferences  of  any  particular  application, first select the application
from  this  list.   To edit the default preferences (which are inherited by
new  applications  when  they  are first launched), select the entry marked
with " Default ").

Pressing  the  @{"Gadgets" LINK GGadgets}  button  brings  up a new window which allows you to
change various settings pertaining to gadgets (font, style, etc).

The  @{"Frames" LINK GFrames}  button  opens  a  window  which  allows you to modify settings
pertaining to frames and frame headlines.

The  @{"Backfill" LINK GBackfill}  button opens a window which allows you to control whether or
not an application is allowed to use backfilling, and if so, what color the
backfill should have.

The @{"Screens" LINK GScreens} button opens up a window which allows you to configure which
existing public screen an application should open GUI's on, or if neccesary
the attributes of a new public screen for use with this particular
application.

The  @{"Misc" LINK GMisc}  button  opens up a window with miscellaneous other settings.  At
present  the  only  setting  you  can  control  from  here  is what type of
refreshing an application should use, but more controls are planned.

The  @{"Info" LINK GInfo}  button  brings  up  some  information  on the currently selected
application.  Note not every application supply information about themself,
and so some of the fields in the Information window may be empty.

Note  that all the above windows are asynchronous.  This means you can open
and use as many of them as you like at any one time.

The  @{b}Delete@{ub}  button  allows  you  to  delete  all  settings  related to the
currently   selected  application.   You  will  be  asked  to  confirm  the
operation,  and then the application is deleted.  Note you cannot undo this
by pressing the Cancel button!

The  @{b}Test@{ub}  button allows you to temporarily test the effects of the changes
made  to  the preferences. Of course, this requires that the application(s)
are also running at the time.

Technical  note:  GUI  tests  are  passive  on  the  part  of  GUIFront. An
application  has  to  explicitly  listen for messages from GUIFront telling
them  their  preferences have been changed, or the Test gadget will have no
effect  on  them.  If nothing seems to happen when you press Test, the most
likely explanations are that the application was written before preferences
notification  was  implemented  in the library, or is not currently able to
change its visuals for some other reason (like, it is busy loading data).

To  permanently  save  the  preferences as they are just now (regardless of
which windows may be open), press @{b}Save@{ub}. To use the current settings, press
@{b}Use@{ub}. To cancel changes you've made to the preferences, press @{b}Cancel@{ub}.

Note  that  to guifront.library, changes happen only when you press @{b}Save@{ub} or
@{b}Use@{ub}.   If  you  launch an application while the preferences window is open,
this  new  application will use the preferences which were in effect before
the preferences editor was launched.

The  GUIFront preferences editor also has some menus.  See the @{"menu section" LINK Menus}
for a more detailed description of these.

Also  note  that  the  preferences  editor  listens for new applications to
start.  As  soon  as  this  happens, a new entry appears in the application
listview, regardless of what you are doing with the editor at that time.

Closing  the  window  is logically equivalent to pressing @{b}Use@{ub}, so you won't
loose any changes if you do this.

@Node GGadgets "Gadget Preferences"
Gadget Preferences

This  window allows you to control which font an application should use for
gadgets, plus what style you prefer for various gadget types.

Select  @{b}Screen  Font@{ub} to have the application use whatever happens to be the
current screen font at the time when the application is launched.

Deselect  @{b}Screen  Font@{ub}  to have the application use a particular font.  Use
the @{b}GetFont@{ub} gadget to select the font the application should use.

The listview below the font settings contain a list of gadgets which can be
rendered  in one of two styles:  @{b}Xen@{ub} or @{b}Normal@{ub}.  @{b}Xen@{ub} differs from @{b}Normal@{ub} in
that  an  extra  black  frame  is rendered around the gadget hitbox itself.
With  the  right  font  and  a  high  graphics  resolution,  this  can look
remarkably good, especially for Buttons and Checkboxes.

Note  that  Checkboxes  currently cannot be rendered in Xen mode under V36.
You'll need at least V39 to enjoy this.

The  @{b}Xen Frame Color@{ub} palette gadget allows you to select which color should
be  used  for  rendering  Xen frames.  Xen frames are the thin frames which
GUIFront  draws around the hitboxes of those gadgets which supports the xen
mode. You probably want it to be as dark as possible (like black).
@EndNode

@Node GFrames "Frame Preferences"
Frame Preferences

This  window allows you to control how frame headlines are rendered for the
selected application.

Select  @{b}Screen  Font@{ub} to have the application use whatever happens to be the
current screen font at the time the application is launched.

Deselect  @{b}Screen  Font@{ub}  to have the application use a particular font.  Use
the @{b}GetFont@{ub} gadget to select the font the application should use.

The @{b}Color@{ub} gadget allows you to select the color of frame headlines.

The  @{b}Alignment@{ub}  gadgets  allow  you to control if frame headlines should be
vertically  centered  on (@{b}Center@{ub} gadget), or rendered above the frame it is
written on (@{b}Above@{ub} gadget).

The  @{b}Attributes@{ub}  gadgets  allow  you  to  change  the  attributes  of frame
headlines.   Select @{b}Bold@{ub} to render headlines in boldface, @{b}Italics@{ub} to render
headlines  in  Italics, and @{b}3D@{b} to give headlines a black shadow.  Note that
the  @{b}Color@{ub}  gadget  controls  the  color  of  the headline, not the shadow.
Selecting black color and 3D is therefore not a very good idea.

The  @{b}Centering@{ub}  gadgets  allow  you  to control the horizontal alignment of
frame  headlines.  Select @{b}Right@{ub} to have headlines rendered rightmost on the
frame,  @{b}Centered@{ub}  to have it centered and @{b}Left@{ub} to have it rendered leftmost
on the frame.
@EndNode

@Node GBackfill "Backfill Preferences"
Backfill Preferences

This window allows you to control application backfilling.

Select  @{b}Enable  backfilling@{ub}  to allow the currently selected application to
use backfilling if it wants to.

If  you enable backfilling, you can also select the two color components of
the backfilling pattern itself, using the @{b}Color 1@{ub} and @{b}Color 2@{ub} gadgets.
@EndNode

@Node GScreens "Public Screen Preferences"
Public Screen Preferences

This window allows you to control public screen settings. The listview
allows you to select which screen the currently selected application should
open on.

Initially the listview contains three default entries:

    @{b} Default@{ub}

      Specifies that application GUIs should open on the user's current
      default public screen.

    @{b} Workbench@{ub}

      Specifies that application GUIs should open on the Workbench screen.

    @{b} Frontmost@{ub}

      Specifies that application GUIs should open on the frontmost public
      screen.

To create new public screens, press @{b}New@{ub}. A new GUI will appear, allowing
you to specify the various attributes of the new screen. Use the string
gadget below the listview to enter the name of the new public screen. Note
that this is not the title of the screen, rather the symbolic name by which
it will be known internally by the rest of the system and by other
applications.

If you wish to edit existing screen definitions, press the @{b}Edit...@{ub} gadget.
To delete screen definitions, press @{b}Delete...@{ub} (you will be asked to confirm
the operation).

The screen definition GUI contains a heap of gadgets which each control one
attribute of the new screen. Most of it should be self explanatory, but
I'll give a quick run-down of the gadgets anyway. First, however, please
note that this GUI is sensitive to which OS version you are using, so that
if for example you are using kickstart 2.04 (V37), not all gadgets will be
visible because those features weren't yet available in that OS. Also, the
Screen Mode selection (see below) will appear differently under V37, V38
and V39+.

The @{b}Screen Mode@{ub} selector allows you to pick one of the existing Amiga
@{i}screen modes@{ui}. This in turn controls the size and depth (number of colors)
that the new screen will have, and under V38+ also if it should be
autoscrolling. (In pre-V38 (2.1) systems, the AutoScroll feature will be
seperately controllable in the Properties section).

The @{b}Screen Font@{ub} selector allows you to pick the default screen font for the
new screen. Applications which do not require any particular font will use
this one, as will the system's window- and screentitles, plus menu strips.
Select @{b}Default@{ub} if you wish to use the screen font of the user's default
public screen (determined at runtime, of course).

Moving down to the @{i}Properties@{ui} section, the @{b}Screen Title@{ub} gadget allows you
to enter the title of the new screen. This title will appear visually in
the screen's drag bar.

@{b}Show Title@{ub} does not (however suggestive it sounds) indicate if the screen
title is to be displayed or not, rather it tells the system if the title
is to be rendered on top of or below backdrop windows. Since GUIFront does
not currently support backdrop windows the usefulness of this gadget is
debatable, but it is included for completion and in preparation for future
upgrades.

The @{b}Interleaved@{ub} gadget controls whether or not the screen should be
interleaved. Interleaved screens generally show less flickering when
scrolling CLI windows etc, because bitplanes are stored in a special
format internally. I recommend always enabling Interleave, since the system
can override it in case the resolution and/or depth you've selected somehow
prohibits it (i.e. the screen won't refuse to open, it'll just not be
interleaved).

The @{b}Open Behind@{ub} gadget allows you to specify that the screen should open
behind all existing screens.

The @{b}Leave Open@{ub} gadget tells GUIFront to leave the screen open after the
application quits. The default action is to try to close the screen again
when the application exits.

The @{b}Quiet@{ub} gadget tells the system not to render the default system screen
gadgets (tofront/toback) on this screen.

The @{b}Draggable@{ub} gadget is used to define if the screen should be draggable by
mouse or not.

The @{b}Share Pens@{ub} gadget controls how drawing pens should be handled by
applications. It's a long story, but to make it very short you generally
want this to be ON.

The @{b}Exclusive@{ub} gadget is used to specify that the screen should always
appear in whole, i.e. never be obscured by another screen (not even by
dragging).

@Node GMisc "Miscellaneous Preferences"
Miscellaneous Preferences

This  window  allows  you  to  control  miscellaneous  GUI settings for the
currently selected application.

The  Refreshing gadgets allow you to control what type of window refreshing
the  application  should  be  using.  Select Smart to use Intuition's smart
refreshing scheme, and Simple to use manual refreshing.

The  difference  between  the  two  methods  is the old memory-versus-speed
compromise  over  again.   Smart  refreshing  looks  great, it is quick and
results  in  a  minimum of visual flickering when windows are moved around.
The drawback is that this type of refreshing is quite expensive in terms of
memory  usage.   Worst  case it uses twice the amount of memory it normally
would.

Simple  refresh is very cheap in terms of memory usage, but takes longer to
execute.  On  slower  machines,  the  flickering  of the refresh cycle will
probably be a bit too obvious.

A  general rule of thumb for configuring refresh is to use smart refreshing
when  memory  permits and simple refreshing when CPU power permits. I own a
68040  @  28 mhz myself, and for me simple refreshing works like a charm. I
expect the same to be true for 030 and even some 020 based machines.

@Node GInfo "Application Information"
Application Information

This   window   simply   shows  you  some  information  about  the  current
application.   Note  that  not  all  applications  supply information about
themselves.   For  such  applications  the  information  fields will remain
empty.
@EndNode

@Node Menus "Menus"
Menus

The GUIFront preferences editor currently has the following menu items:

Project/

    Open...

        This  menu  item  allows  you to load a complete set of preferences
        into  the  editor.  Note  that  the  current  preferences (plus any
        changes you've made) will be lost in the process.

    Save As...

        This  menu  item  allows  you  to save the current preferences to a
        file.  Note that doing this has the side effect of making the saved
        preferences  the  actual, current preferences, just like if you had
        pressed Use.

    About...

        This menu item shows you some incredibly important information.

    Quit
        Select  this menu item to quit the GUIFront preferences editor. The
        current settings will be lost in the process.

Edit/

    Reset to Defaults/

        This entry

            This  menu  item  will  reset  the  current application to some
            internal,   standard   values.  Note  that  this  takes  effect
            immediately (it may be cancelled, however)

        All entries

            Select  this  menu item to reset all application preferences to
            internal  default  values.  Again  note  that this takes effect
            immediately (it may be cancelled, however).

    Last Saved

            This menu item resets the current settings to whatever you last
            saved using the Save gadget.

    Restore

            Select  this  menu  item to undo all changes you've made to the
            current preferences.

Options/

    Create Icons?

        Check  this  menu  item if you want project icons to be saved along
        with  the  preferences,  every  time you select Save As... from the
        menu.

        GUIFront  uses the image of the first of the following icons it can
        locate, for the icon to be saved:

        ENV:Sys/def_guifront
        ENVARC:Sys/def_guifront
        ENV:Sys/def_project
        ENVARC:Sys/def_project

        If  you design your own icon and store it under one of these names,
        GUIFront automatically uses this icon.
