GUFront Developer Information
-----------------------------

This directory contains the developer documentation for GUIFront. If you
want to create your own GUIFront applications you'll need these files. If
not, you can safely forget all about them.

Since compiler systems and the way they install vary so much, I have not
provided installation scripts of any kind, so you will need to copy the
material manually onto your HD to use it.

E Developer Files
-----------------

The files in the E directory contains the necessary developer files
required to use GUIFront with Amiga E. All files courtesy of George Beasley
(beanman@mv.MV.COM) (thanks, George! :-)

Note: The current E developer material has regrettably not been updated
since release 1.1, since George is apparently without e-mail access at the
moment. I am trying to find someone else to take over from George, but have
thus far not been able to. I apologize about this and hope to get the E
developer files up to speed again as soon as somebody volunteers to do help
me out.

GNU Developer Files
-------------------

As of release 1.2 GUIFront includes support for the GNU C compiler. The
developer files were very kindly supplied by Gunther Nikl
(gnikl@informatik.uni-rostock.de) and may be found in the GNU directory.

Oberon Developer Files
----------------------

As of release 1.2 GUIFront includes Oberon support. The developer files
