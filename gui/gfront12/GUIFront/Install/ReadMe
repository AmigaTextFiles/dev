Installation notes for GUIFront
-------------------------------

Some of the installation scripts provided here require Commodore's
Installer utility.  Since this utility is copyright by Commodore, it is not
included in this distribution.

If you are using Workbench 2.1 or later, you will find the Installer on
your Workbench installation disk. Simply copy the program to your C:
directory, or anywhere in your shell command path.

If you for some reason do not own or have access to the Installer, I have
also provided a script for use with the IconX utility. This small utility
allows execution of shell scripts from Workbench, and is widely available
(every Fred Fish library disk has it).  If you don't have it handy, you can
also simply execute the installation script with C:Execute from a shell or
CLI window.

If you prefer to install GUIFront manually, copy the library file to your
LIBS: directory and the preferences editor to SYS:Prefs, or whereever you
prefer. If you want the preferences editor to be localized, you must also
copy the necessary catalog files to your LOCALE:Catalogs directory.

Two CPU versions of the software has been provided. One runs on all Amigas,
the other requires at least a 68020. To maximize efficiency you should
install the CPU versions which most closely match your hardware.
