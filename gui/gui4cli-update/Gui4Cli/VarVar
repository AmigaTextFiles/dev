 Compound Variables
 ===========================================================

 The names of variables can be made up of other variables.
 Variables of this type we'll call "compound"

 > $aaa$var

 When Gui4Cli finds a "$" character, it starts reading in a var
 name. If the name contains other "$" characters it will resolve
 each part, appending it to the previous part, until all parts 
 have been translated and the variable's name is complete.

 > aaabbbccc = 'This is a variable'
 > var1 = bbb
 > var2 = ccc
 > Say "aaabbbccc contains: $aaa$var1$var2"

 You can also have the 1st part (ie the "aaa" part above) declared
 as a variable. To do this you use the "$\\" ("$" + one backslash).

 > var = aaa
 > Say "aaabbbccc contains: $\\var$var1$var2"

 Compound variables can also be combined with the [][] brackets:

 > $aaa$var[$var][$var]

 Full variable paths can be used, so the following is possible:
 (although it should be avoided sinse its confusing)

 > $\\mygui.gc/var$othergui/var$*globalvar[$gui.gc/var][$*global]

 Behaviour:
 ---------------
 If any of the parts of the variable is not found, they will be
 set to "" (nothing) and there will be *NO* error report, unless
 you are in DEBUG mode.

 This enables you to set a default value for all the variable
 parts, like initialising it:

 > var = empty
 > Say '$var$xxx'

 Here, the "xxx" part will not be found and the variable will
 be evaluated as plain "$var" which will give you "empty"


 What to do with compound variables:
 ------------------------------------
 Compound variables are *very* usefull in many situations, since
 they provide "arrays" and indirection. You will need them as you
 get more experienced and your programs more complex.

 Simple example:
 In GUI "One.gc"

 > client.name   = Dimitris
 > client.funds  = $5.000.000.000
 > client.status = Excellent
 > gosub Two.gc Report "status"

 Now in GUI "Two.gc" we have a routine named "Report"
 As you read in @{" passing arguments " LINK "Passing_Args"}, when this routine is called,
 the variable "item" will be initialised to contain "status"
 
 > xROUTINE Report item
	   Say "Client $item = $client.$item"

 > (output would be) "Client status = Excellent"


 Or say you assign the values of the first five lines of a 
 listview  to variables named "line.1" to "line.5":

 > lvuse #this 1
   lvgo first
   c = 1
   while $c < 6
      line.$c = $$lv.rec
      ++c
      lvgo next
   endwhile

 You can now print out the contents of the lines as follows:

 > c = 1
   while $c < 6
      Say "$line.$c \\n"
      ++c
   endwhile
