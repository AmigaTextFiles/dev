Description of files:
---------------------

class.c

 The main class source. The dispatcher routine is responsible
for controling all the features of the BOOPSI class.
 For debugging output, see class_lib.c section below.

class.fd

 The library descriptor. You won't need to modify this.

class.h

 This is the place to put all private datastructures and info
about your BOOPSI class.
 You can make an additional headerfile for distribution. This
should contain only the definitions needed to use the class,
such as classname and attributes.

class_lib.c

 This is library housekeeping routines. You shouldn't need to
modify these. You might want to modify the OpenLibrary calls in
openlibs() to suit your needs, this is also the place to open
other external BOOBSI classes that you might need.
 Remember to modify closelibs() according to your modifications
of openlibs().
 Routines to activate simple debug output from the class is also
in here. To use them you must #define DEBUG globally. This is
done by editing the projects compiler settings.
 The debugging output works via the included debug.lib linked
library, which I have developed myself. You can optionally replace
your compilers debug.lib with this one. Read the file debug.doc
for more info on how to use debug.lib.
