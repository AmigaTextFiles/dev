 ClassFree - Source release

--------------------------------------

Legal mumbo:
------------

 ClassFree is FREEWARE and so are the sourcecodes included
 in this release.

 This release may only be distributed in it's original form
that is in the ClassFree directory, with all subdirectories
and files, and only packet with lha or lzx.
 Preferably the archive should never be redistributed once
unpacked. If you want to redistribute this release get the
original lha-packet archive from Aminet.

 You may not modify these sourcecodes and release them as
your own. The purpose of the source code release is to
teach people interested in BOOPSI programming more about
how the BOOPSI system and intuition works.

 Nomatter what you do with this software the rules stated
in the accompanying file 'Warranty issues' always applies.


Description:
------------

 For an explanation of what ClassFree is about, get the
prerelease 0c ('ClassFree.lha') from aminet and read
the encloased documentation. This is a final source
release of ClassFree without documentation (besides
the comments in the source files). The ClassFree project
has been terminated as of June 1999 for two reasons.
The first reason is that I have (probably) permantly
stopped programming seriously for Amiga (classic). The
second and even more important reason is that the release
of AmigaOS3.5 obsoletes ClassFree, since it contains a
full range of advanced BOOPSI gadget classes.
