 Description:

 This is a (very :) small linked library in the object format
for use when debugging exec shared libraries, devices or anything
where you can't use normal stdio functions.
 The library is intended for C programmers.
 With the library you can open one or more simple console windows
and print formated text strings with some stdio-like functions.
 So what good is this you ask?
 It is very hard to debug libraries because it is illegal to call
dos.library functions from within a library and you can't use your
compilers source-level debugger either. Therefore you can't know
why your library fails if it has an error.
 This linked library uses exec's RawDoFmt() and graphic.library's
Text() to output to a normal intuition window. This is a fairly
safe way to output simple variable values and other text.


 Installation:

 Put the linked library "debug.lib" either where your source files
are or alternatively in the directory where your compiler keeps
it's linked libraries. There is already another library with the
same name there, but the reason you are using this (my) debug.lib,
is because you won't be using the other one.. :)
 Put the header file "debug_protos.h" where your source files are.


 Usage:

 Include the headerfile at the start of your source. Link your code
with the debug.lib.


 Functions:

 NAME
      DLopencon - Open debug console.

 SYNOPSIS
      console = DLopencon()

      APTR DLopencon(void);

 FUNCTION
      This opens a console window and returns an abstact pointer
      to it. This pointer must be suplied as the first argument
      to other debug.lib functions.

 INPUTS
      None

 RESULTS
      A pointer to the debug.lib console.

 BUGS
      None (they are all features, as they say.. ;)

 SEE ALSO

      DLclosecon()

-

 NAME
      DLprintf() - Print formated output to debug.lib console.

 SYNOPSIS
      DLprintf( console, fmt, ...)

      void DLprintf( APTR, STRPTR, ...);

 FUNCTION
      Formats non-float arguments and prints them to the
      debug.lib console window.

 INPUTS
      console   - The abstract pointer returned by previous
                  call to DLopencon().
      fmt       - exec RawDoFmt()-like formatstring.

 RESULTS
      String is printed.

 BUGS
      Newline and carriage return is not supported,
      each call to DBprintf will scroll the text in
      the console and print the new output below.

 SEE ALSO
      RawDoFmt(), A book on C stdio.


-

 NAME
      DLclosecon - Close a debug.lib console.

 SYNOPSIS
      DLclosecon( console)

      void DLclosecon( APTR);

 FUNCTION
      When you are done using the console you must
      use this function to close it.

 INPUTS
      console  - Abtract debug.lib console pointer
                 returned by call to DLopencon.

 RESULTS
      The debug.lib console is closed.

 BUGS
      None (How hard can closing a window be.. :)

 SEE ALSO
      DLopencon()
