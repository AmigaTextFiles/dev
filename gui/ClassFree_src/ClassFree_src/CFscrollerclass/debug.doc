 NAME
      DLprintf() - Print formated output to debug.lib console.

 SYNOPSIS
      DLprintf( console, fmt, ...)

      void DLprintf( APTR, STRPTR, ...);

 FUNCTION
      Formats non-float arguments and prints them to the
      debug.lib console window.

 INPUTS
      console   - The abstract pointer returned by previous
                  call to DLopencon().
      fmt       - exec RawDoFmt()-like formatstring.

 RESULTS
      String is printed.

 NOTES
      This call is executed syncronously and therefore adds
      a certain amount of overhead to the function in which
      it is used. For input handlers such as a the gadget
      class handleinput method usage should be kept to an
      minimum. It is possible that the handler will fail to
      process some events, and this could have unexpected
      results, i.e. guru..

      use this function to close it.

 INPUTS

                 returned by call to DLopencon.
