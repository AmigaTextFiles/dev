 sampleclass V0.10

 A BOOPSI class programming example.

--------------------------------------


Description:
------------

 This is an example BOOPSI class project for StormC. Of course it works on other
compilers too, but it will require some tweaking.
 I have used this as a basis for the classes in the ClassFree archive.

 This document contains some notes and hints that might be usefull when
programming new BOOPSI classes.

 Descriptions of the individual files are in the document files.doc.


Programming notes:
------------------

 First of all. Some of the classes in the OS should be considered in BETA state,
because they seem to be missing some features that are documentet. Some classes
are not documentet very good and you have to do some experimenting to find out
some of their quirks.

 The build-in button class (and frbuttonclass).

 The class leaves some to be desired. You have to do a lot of things yourself,
for instance if you want to do a standard text gadget then you have to supply an
image object as well as the text (frameiclass) because it is the image that
handles the mousehit routines.
 On the Amiga Developer CD there is a replacement buttonclass that corrects most
of the problems that occure when using the build in class. But this one has
problems too. It doesn't support (AFAICS) ICA_TARGET and ICA_MAP (which, by the
way, for some reason is defined in capitalized letters and and not as it is
written in all documentation ICA_Target and ICA_Map) which are essential if you
want to use it as a basis for group gadgets.

 The groupgclass.

 Very poorly documentet if you ask me. I didn't even want to try to mess with
LAYOUT stuff, I don't think it works, althought it might..
 The main thing that fooled me a lot about this class is that when you hand the
GA_Left, and GA_Top attributes to it, then all gadgets you add as members must be
placed relative to this position, so if you want a button to appear right where
you positioned the groupgadget then the botton must have the GA_Left and GA_Top
set to 0.
 When you change a gadgets attributes after it has been added to the membership
the you should use either use SetGadgetAttrs() or supply the GadgetInfo to
DoMethod in some way. Else the gadget rendering will fail (possibly intuition
will hang but I'm not quite sure). I had a lot of problems with this myself.
 If you are making a sub class of groupgclass:
 If you have several gadgets communicating with ICA_TARGET, then be sure that
you DON'T call the SuperClass (ie. groupgclass) before you are about to process
the incoming data. You can target your own groupgclass object with ICA_TARGET
for example with buttons. This way you will get the OM_UPDATE method issued and
the GA_ID of the gadget that was hit will be in the in the attributes list.
 Now. If you call DoSupermethod the groupgclass will go and send a
IDCMP_GADGETUP message with your gadgets GA_ID to the applictation that is using
your subclass object. Since the application is likely to have its own gadget
with the GA_ID that you are using it will think that the user has hit one of the
aplications gadgets and unwanted effects will occure.


General hints:
--------------

 Sometimes the Superclass must be overriden entirely. In the above example with
OM_UPDATE in groupgclass you should not call the SuperMethod at all, because it
will cause unwanted results. 

 Be very carefull to jump out of the dispatcher switch with break or return. You
will be punished for running out of bounds..


History:
--------

 V0.01

   First test release.

 V0.10

   Put all OpenLibrary and CloseLibrary calls in
    seperate routines.
   Added debugging routines.

 V0.12

   I should have known better than to use
    dos.library functions from within a library..
    -replaced the debugging routines :)

 V0.13

   Removed some useless code left over from the class that
   this sampleclass was based on.
