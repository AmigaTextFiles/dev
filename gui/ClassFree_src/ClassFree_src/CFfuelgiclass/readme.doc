 sampleclass V0.14

 A BOOPSI class programming example.

--------------------------------------


Description:
------------

 This is an example BOOPSI class project for StormC. Of course it
works on other compilers too, but it will require some tweaking.
 I have used this as a basis for the classes in the ClassFree
archive. It requires v37 of AmigaOS initially, but if you make a
class that uses v39 calls you should edit the OpenLibrary calls
in class_lib.c to demand higher library versions.

 Descriptions of the individual files are in the document files.doc.


Requirements:
-------------

 - AmigaOS 2.04


History:
--------

 V0.01

   First test release.

 V0.10

   Put all OpenLibrary and CloseLibrary calls in
    seperate routines.
   Added debugging routines.

 V0.12

    Replaced the debugging routines with debug.lib.

 V0.13

   Removed some useless code left over from the class that
   this sampleclass was based on.

 V0.14

   Converted library calls to inline code.

 V0.15

   Relaxed OS demands to v37
