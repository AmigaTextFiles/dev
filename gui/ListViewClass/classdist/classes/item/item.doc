Class:  itemclass
SuperClass:  rootclass
Include File:  <itemclass.h>

Base class for objects which do their own drawing and layout.

Changed Methods:

OM_DISPOSE - This will dispose of the objects subitem.

New Methods:

IM_DIMENSIONS - This is used to find out how much space the object would take
up when IM_DRAW is called.  Note that the internal drawinfo will overide the
one passed in the parameters.

IM_DRAW - This will cause the object to draw its contents in the specified
area.  Again the internal drawinfo has precedent over the one in the
parameters.

IM_ERASE - Tell the object to erase itself with EraseRect().

IM_(Node Function) - Exec style functions for manipulating the internal node
of the item.

Suggested Methods:

IM_HITTEST - This isn't implemented but was planned.  It would be used to
check if a pointer click at certain coordinates would be valid and return TRUE
or FALSE.  For example, if the textitemclass was sent an IM_HITTEST it would
return true if the coords were inside of the block of text somewhere but FALSE
if it weren't.  And another example would be the separatoritemclass which
would return FALSE all the time since it is more of a visual element.

Attributes:

IA_SubItem - set the subitem of the current item object.  Note it doesn't
actually have to be another item object.  For example, a hierarchial menu
could have the subitem point to another listview gadget.

IA_ID - set the items ID.

IA_UserData - set the items UserData field.

IA_DrawInfo - set the items internal drawinfo.  Please be aware that a
item drawinfo has more pens than a regular drawinfo.  Check the header
to find out more.

IA_JURight - Causes the object to right justify its contents on a IM_DRAW

IA_JUCenter - Causes the object to center its contents in the box of an
IM_DRAW.

IA_JULeft - Left justify

IA_JUTop - Vertical justification, top

IA_JUVCenter - Center vertically

IA_JUBottom - Vertically justify on the bottom

IA_Selected - set the items IAF_Selected Flag

IA_Name - Sets the internal struct Node's ln_Name field

IA_Pri - Sets the internal struct Node's ln_Pri field

IA_NoBack - Tells the object to not clear the box before it draws its
contents.  (Default FALSE).
