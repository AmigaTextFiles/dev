Class:  itemlistgadget
SuperClass:  gadgetclass
Include File:  <itemlistclass.h>

A bare BOOPSI list view gadget that uses subclasses of the itemclass to do
all of its drawing.  Please note that the demo, usemyic, doesn't have a
drawinfo with the highlightbackpen so it is prolly black and looks butt
ugly.

New Methods:

IM_ADDMEMBERADJUST - Add an itemclass object to the internal list and
automatically adjust the height and width to accomodate the new object.  For
example, you could create the gadget and add all of the items to it then
use the width and height produce a sensitive width and height.  Also
adjust ItemHeight in case the object's dimensions is bigger.

IM_REMMEMBERADJUST - Remove the object from the list view and adjust the
width and height of the gadget taking into account the removal of the object.

Changed Methods:

OM_ADDMEMBER - Add an itemclass object to the list, no adjustment is made.
The object is added to the end of the list.  Also adjust ItemHeight in case
the object's dimensions is bigger.

OM_REMMEMBER - Remove an itemclass object from the list, no adjustment is made.

OM_DISPOSE - This will dispose of all the object currently in its internal
list.


Attributes:

ILGA_Top (ISGNU) - Set the number of the top item.

ILGA_ItemHeight (ISGU) - Manually set the height used to draw items.

ILGA_Visible (N) - The number of items currently visible

ILGA_Total (SUG) - The total number of item in the list.  If used in set or
update it will send out a notify.

ILGA_Selected (SGNU) - Number of the currently selected item

ILGA_SelectedItem (G) - Pointer to the currently selected item

ILGA_NumSelectable (I) - Set the number of items that can be selected.  Either
NS_NONE, NS_ONE, or NS_ALL.  Currently you can't set this while the gadget
is running but you can reprogram it real quick.

ILGA_Drag (IS) ) - Sets whether the user can drag the selected item after
clicking.  (Defaults to TRUE).

ILGA_FirstItem (G) - Pointer to the first item in the list.

ILGA_NoCareShift (IS) - Put the listview into toggle mode.  Whenever the user
clicks and drags the cursor the items underneath will toggle the selected
state.  If not set the behavior will be setup so if the user click on the
gadget it will clear the old selected items, unless the shift key is pressed
in which case it will put either turn off items if the first item clicked on
was selected or vice versa.

ILGA_DontHold (IS) - Keep the selected item drawn after the user lets go.
Meant to be used for a menu class where the user would click on the item and
then when they let go, it would redraw as normal.  Currently doesn't work if
drag is turned off.

ILGA_Lock (IS) - Lock the listview so the program can manipulate it.  The
listview doesn't change on screen and the user can't manipulate it.  Once the
listview is locked the program can change the internal list as it pleases.
Note:  Currently you must WAIT for the gadget to notify you it has been locked.
It will send out a OM_NOTIFY on ILGA_Lock when it has actually been locked.
This is so that if the gadget is the active gadget the user can finish using it
before the program changes it.

ILGA_ItemDrawInfo - Not Implemented yet.  But is meant to be used when
doing IM_DIMENSION and IM_DRAW calls.
