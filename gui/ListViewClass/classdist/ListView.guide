Hi!


This archive is a collection of BOOPSI classes used to implement a list view
gadget much like the one you find in gadtools, except better of course.
Although these aren't really ready for release yet, someone asked me if I
could put it up on Aminet.  After some thought I finally decided to put it
up since some others might want it to figure out how to write BOOPSI
classes or for using as a regular list view.  Anyways I've decided to
change the way it works and won't be continuing on this path of design
anymore, but I will still support it of course and release bug fixes and
any mods that others do.  Well enough rambling heres a feature list.


 - Read only, single select, and Multi-select


 - Very flexible and able to support a wide range of behaviors


 - Use of subclasses of the itemclass allows an infinite number of
drawing possibilities.


 - Relatively small and fast.  Well it's not slow on my 3000

The ListView Gadget


The listview gadget itself is very simplistic and doesn't provide any
extra features such as automatic framing and scroll bars.  This RISC
approach is always my way of doing things since it allows the most
flexibility for the programmer.  Although the itemlist.class in its
current implementation doesn't support all the fancy schmancy features of
other listviews around it doesn't cost you anything and some poorly
commented source is provided for you to play with and tailor to your
needs (btw a small thanks in your project's docs wouldn't kill you :).
Really though the only features missing are smooth scrolling and
horizontal scrolling.  But because of the use of the itemclass you can do
things with this listview you can't with all the others.


The ItemClasses


This listview gadget was designed to be completely flexible and able to
be able to be used to implement all sorts of other gadgets such as
radio, popup, cycle, checkboxes, and menus.  To accomplish this a second
class was designed that is much like the image class.  This new class
was designated the itemclass and internally has a node which is used as
its link into the list.  The rootclass's node wasn't used since it doesn't
support any node functions besides AddTail so list manipulation would
be severely limited.  However, the itemclass provides methods for node
manipulation.

Here's a quick example of using items to make a radio button gadget:

@tab 3

			/* create the list gadget */

			radiolist = NewObject( NULL, "itemlistgadget",

												GA_Left, gadleft + ALXGUTTER,

												GA_Top, gadtop,

												GA_Height, 0,

												GA_Width, 0,

												ILGA_Drag, FALSE,

												GA_Previous, args,

												GA_RelVerify, TRUE,

												GA_ID, LIST_TYPE,

												TAG_DONE );

			/* create an item */

			wbitem = NewObject( NULL, "imagetextitemclass",

												IA_Name, "WB",

												ITIA_Image, radioim, /* a radio button image */

												IA_ID, AID_WB,

												IA_JULeft, TRUE,

												IA_JUVCenter, TRUE,

												IA_DrawInfo, &itdri,

												TAG_DONE );

			/* create another item */

			clitem = NewObject( NULL, "imagetextitemclass",

												IA_Name, "Cli",

												ITIA_Image, radioim,

												IA_ID, AID_CLI,

												IA_JULeft, TRUE,

												IA_JUVCenter, TRUE,

												IA_DrawInfo, &itdri,

												TAG_DONE );

			/* add them to the list view */

			DoMethod( (Object *)radiolist, IM_ADDMEMBERADJUST, clitem );

			DoMethod( (Object *)radiolist, IM_ADDMEMBERADJUST, wbitem );


  @{" Here's what it looks like running... " link "pics/makealias.iff/main"}


  @{" And here's some checkboxes... " link "pics/makepub.iff/main"}


  @{" Or a hierarchial pop window... " link "pics/popwin.iff/main"}


See, easy as pie.  And since the IM_ADDMEMBERADJUST method will adjust the
width and height of the itemlistgadget automatically you can use these
numbers to help you compute the height and width of your window.

Of course you can create your own itemclass subclasses and have them
perform all sorts of feats.  All of the included classes include source
so you can use them as a skeleton.

This software is freeware.  Use it as you like but if you include it in
another program please at least give a small credit and send me some
mail saying what you use it for.  Thanks.

Enjoy!

@node "The Source" "ListView.guide/The Source Code"

The source is provided for your convenience.  If you make any mods
please send them to me so I can put them in the distribution.  Also,
if you discover any bugs tell me about it and I'll try to hunt it down,
unless you've already fixed it, in which case send the fix to me.


Also if you make some more itemclasses send them to me and I'll also
include them in the distribution.
