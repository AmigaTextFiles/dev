  ADD   I'm still thinking on a resonable implementation but a routine to
        add user-specific config files to an  existing GUI file  might be
        useful for custom source generators.

  ADD   Add some custom gadgets.    There are some gadgets missing in the
        original gadtools kinds:

            PROGRESS_KIND   -   A gadget which  graphically  displays the
                                progress as a sortof gauge.

            GETFILE_KIND    -   A gadget to  obtain a  filename  from the
                                user. With or without a String gadget.

            TOGGLE_KIND     -   A gadget like the CheckBox  only  it must
                                be a button that toggles on and off.

            VECTOR_KIND     -   A Button  which  should  contain a vector
                                image designed by the user.
