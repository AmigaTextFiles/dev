  gadtoolsbox.library version 39.

  I have to make  very  big  appology to  all  GTB 2.0  users  that  are
  running on a 68000 based machine.   After hearing some very disturbing
  messages about GTB crashing I (finaly) found out that loading a GUI on
  68000 based machines in some cases  caused a  GURU #80000003  (address
  error). This ws the reason:

  GadToolsBox writes strings the following way in the file:

        len     (16bits)
        chars   (len of characters)

  Now the code reads a complete chunk into memory from which the strings
  where read as follows:

        UBYTE   *data;      <-- pointer to chunk data
        UWORD    len;

        len = *(( UWORD * )data );
        data += 2;

  Since the strings are  located  after  eachother  this could  cause an
  address error (reading a WORD from an un-aligned address).   Now I use
  the following code which  eliminates  the problem:

        UBYTE   *data;
        UWORD    len;

        len  = (( *data++ ) << 8 );
        len |= *data++;

  Now I can tell you all sorts of excuses  for not  testing  on a  68000
  based machine but I wont. I screwed up and I am sorry for that.

  P.S. The version bump to 39 is because the V38 version of the  library
       is hereby declared obsolete. (Rev. 1)

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  gadtoolsbox.library version 38.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  16-Jan-1993   NF      Added the possibility  to  cancel a  "NewButton"
                        hotkey  selection   by   pressing  SHIFT  before
                        releasing the hotkey.   This  is the same way as
                        the ReqTools buttons are cancelled. (Rev. 40)

  17-Jan-1993   MIN     Fixed a small bug concerning the loading  of the
                        config chunks.  The GTConfig fields of  the GenC
                        and GenAsm structures did not  get  updated with
                        the correct GadToolsConfig data. (Rev. 41)

  23-Jan-1993   MAJ     Fixed a major bug in the  TextClass  dispatcher.
                        The  IA_Left,   IA_Top,  IA_Width   &  IA_Height
                        attributes   where  not  updated  by  a call  to
                        SetAttrs(). (Rev. 42)

  15-Feb-1993   MIN     Removed a potential bug. (Rev. 43)

  17-Feb-1993   CH      Changed the bevel-box creation routine a little.
                        No big thing. (Rev. 44)

  18-Feb-1993   MAJ     Fixed a major bug in the "gui.i" header.  I used
                        UBYTE label,6  instead  of  STRUCT label,6.  Bug
                        found by Wouter van Oortmerssen.

  10-Mar-1993   MAJ     GTX_LoadGUIA() forgot  to  correctly  initialize
                        some privatly used data when loading menus.  Bug
                        found by Kai Bolay. (Rev. 45)

  21-Mar-1993   MAJ     GTX_LoadGUIA() was loading all window texts into
                        the first window.  Bug found  by Garry  Cattley.
                        (Rev. 46)

  21-Mar-1993   MAJ     GTX_LoadGUIA() forgot to  initialize  some other
                        privatly used  data.  Bug found by Mick Hohmann.
                        (Rev. 47)
