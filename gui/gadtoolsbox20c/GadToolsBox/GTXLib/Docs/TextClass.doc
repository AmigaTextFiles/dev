Class:          textclass
Superclass:     imageclass
Include File:   <gadtoolsbox/textclass.h>

This class is an extension to the existing imageclass. It is ment to be used
to provide the creators of new boopsi/gadtools gadgets a simple but effective
way to support gadget texts including 2.0 style border rendering.

New Methods:

None.

Changed Methods:

None.

Supported Methods:

OM_NEW, IM_ERASE, IM_DRAW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE. All other methods are directly
passed onto the superclass dispatcher.

Attributes:

IA_Left, IA_Top, IA_Width, IA_Height (I) - These attributes should be used to
define the position and dimensions of the box. The text is always rendered
relative to the box position and dimensions.

TX_TextAttr (ISU) - This attribute contains a pointer to a TextAttr structure
(defined in <graphixs/text.h>) describing which font to use for rendering the
text. When this is NULL the default font is used to render the text. The font
will be opened using OpenFont() so it must be resident in memory.

TX_Style (ISU) - This attribute contains font style flags (defined in
<graphics/text.h>). The style flags described here will over-ride the style flags
that are set in the TextAttr structure.

TX_ForceTextPen (ISU) - This attribute contains a pen number which is used to
render the text. Normally the TEXTPEN, FILLTEXTPEN or HIGHLIGHTTEXTPEN is used to
render the text. When setting this attribute to something else than ~0 will force
the dispatcher to render the text using the described pen.

TX_Underscore (ISU) - This attribute contains the character code which is used
to mark the character that needs to be underscored. The underscored character is
normally used to indicate a keyboard shortcut for a gadget.

TX_Flags (ISU) -  This attribute contains the place where the text must be rendered
and wether or not the text must be rendered using the highligh text pen. The places
are always relative to the box position and dimensions passed to the class dispatcher
at creation time. Currently the places PLACETEXT_IN, PLACETEXT_LEFT, PLACETEXT_RIGHT,
PLACETEXT_ABOVE and PLACETEXT_BELOW (defined in <libraries/gadtools.h>) are supported.
Also the NG_HIGHLABEL flags is supported but the TX_ForceTextPen will override this
flag.

TX_Text (ISU) - This attribute contains the null terminated string which must be
rendered.

SPTX_NoBox (ISU) - This attribute is a boolean which must read TRUE if you do not
want a bevelled box drawn at the box position and dimensions.
