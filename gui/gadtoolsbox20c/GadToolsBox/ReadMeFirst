  I have to make  very  big  appology to  all  GTB 2.0  users  that  are
  running on a 68000 based machine.   After hearing some very disturbing
  messages about GTB crashing I (finaly) found out that loading a GUI on
  68000 based machines in some cases  caused a  GURU #80000003  (address
  error). This was the reason:

  GadToolsBox writes strings the following way in the file:

        len     (16bits)
        chars   (len of characters)

  Now the code reads a complete chunk into memory from which the strings
  where read as follows:

        UBYTE   *data;      <-- pointer to chunk data
        UWORD    len;

        len = *(( UWORD * )data );
        data += 2;

  Since the strings are  located  after  eachother  this could  cause an
  address error (reading a WORD from an un-aligned address).   Now I use
  the following code which  eliminates  the problem:

        UBYTE   *data;
        UWORD    len;

        len  = (( *data++ ) << 8 );
        len |= *data++;

  Now I can tell you all sorts of excuses  for not  testing  on a  68000
  based machine but I wont. I screwed up *BIG* and I am sorry for that.

  P.S. The version bump to 39 is because the V38 version of the  library
       is hereby declared obsolete. (Rev. 1)
