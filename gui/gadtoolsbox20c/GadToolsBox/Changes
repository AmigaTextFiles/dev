   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   08-Apr-1993  CH      Added my  UUCP  address to  the About  requester.
                        (37.294)

   08-Apr-1993  MIN     Clicking on  Cancel  in  the  FileRequester  when
                        opening a new file resulted  in a "Unable to open
                        xxxxxx" requester. Oops. (37.295)

   09-Apr-1993  MIN     Fixed a  couple  of  small  bugs.   Bugs found by
                        Marcel Offermans. (37.296)

   09-Apr-1993  NF-SA   Added a CloseScreen() test.  This will allow (but
                        not encourage!) the use of tools like MKS_Lens on
                        the GTB screen. Suggested by Ola Olsson. (37.297)

   13-Apr-1993  MAJ     GadToolsBox still did not work correctly somtimes
                        when opening  a  screen.   This should NOT happen
                        anymore. Bug found by Kai Bolay. (37.298)

   14-Apr-1993 MAJ      Fixed enforcer hits when clicking OK in  the Grid
                        and  Offsets  windows.   Bug  found by Ola Olsson
                        and Kai Bolay. (37.299)

   14-Apr-1993 MAJ      The  bug  with  the  un-terminated  DriPen  array

                        people. (37.300)

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   GadToolsBox V2.0b (Bug-fix release) (released 07-Apr-93) (37.293)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   05-Apr-1993  MIN     Fixed a small problem  when using  GadToolsBox in
                        combination with QMouse. GadToolsBox would (after
                        the window was opened) keep the busy  pointer.  I
                        simply   added  a   ClearPointer()   after    the
                        rtUnlockWindow() call.  I don't know who's  fault
                        it is  (GadToolsBox,  QMouse  or  ReqTools).  Bug
                        found by Arnout Grootveld. (37.292)

   07-Apr-1993  MAJ     GadToolsBox GURU'd when a window refresh happened
                        and the "Gadgets" item was checked.  Bug found by
                        Dave Lowrey. (37.293)

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   21-Mar-1993  MAJ     Changed the "bsr" branches in the assembly source
                        generator to "jsr".  When generating large  files
                        the   "bsr"   branches   could   not   reach  the
                        destination addresses. Bug found by Mick Hohmann.
                        (37.274)

   21-Mar-1993  MAJ     Fixed a bug in the assembly source  generator. It
                        did a CloseFont with _DiskfontBase  in a6 instead
                        of _GfxBase. (37.275)

   21-Mar-1993  MAJ     The font adaptable source of the  assembly source
                        generator screwed-up totally.   Bug found by Mick
                        Hohmann. (37.276)

   21-Mar-1993  MIN     The gadget  creation  routine  that  the assembly
                        source  generator  generates  returned  the wrong
                        error code uppon failure. (37.277)

   21-Mar-1993  MAJ     Fixed   another  assembly  source  generator bug.
                        Replaced all "add.b sc_WBorxxx(a0),d0" calls with
                        "move.b sc_WBorxxx(a0),d1  ext.w d1  add.w d1,d0"
                        This works, the other solution did not. (37.278)

   22-Mar-1993  CH      Recompiled under DICE v2.07.54R.  Finally got rid
                        of those unused  local variables  the  easy  way!
                        Also edited the about  requester to  reflect  the
                        new DICE copyright notices. (37.279)

   22-Mar-1993  MIN     Fixed a small bug.   In  some  cases the selected
                        gadgets   where  not  deselected  when  an  other
                        gadget  was  selected without the shift key down.
                        Bug found by Kai Bolay. (37.280)

   22-Mar-1993  NF-SA   Added Drag-Selection of  gadgets.   Suggested  by

   24-Mar-1993  MIN     Once a GETFILE gadget was disabled  it could  not
                        be enabled again.   Bug found by Garry  Glendown.
                        (37.282)

   25-Mar-1993  MIN     Position adjustment on  backdrop  windows after a
                        edit screen  re-open  screwed up.  Switching font
                        caused the same problem.  Bug  found by Christoph
                        Burgdorf. (37.283)

   27-Mar-1993  MAJ     As it seems  GadToolsBox  screwed-up  majorly  in
                        it's startup. Bug found by Reza Elghazi. (37.284)

   27-Mar-1993  MIN     The ShowSelected gadget  in the  ListView  editor
                        did not work correctly. Bug found by Reza Elghazi
                        (37.285)

   29-Mar-1993  MAJ     Now needs the  gadtoolsbox.library  version  39++
                        for reasons explained in the "ReadMeFirst"  file.
                        (37.286)

   30-Mar-1993  MAJ     Fixed  bug in the  Oberon  source  generator.  It
                        popped  the  gadget,  menus, texts  and  boxes to
                        early. (37.288)

   01-Apr-1993  NF-SA   Now selecting open will allow you to load a .G or
                        .GUI file. GTB automatically determines what file
                        it  is.    For   compatibility  F7  still  works.
                        Suggested by Kai Bolay. (37.189)

   01-Apr-1993  MIN     Fixed a small bug in the .G file reader. (37.290)

   GadToolsBox V2.0 - 37.273 (released 13-March-1993)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   23-Sep-1992  SA      Changed the "Gadgets" menu. I admit that it was a
                        little messy but  now it's  cleaned up a  little.
                        Suggested by Reza Elghazi. (37.183)

   24-Sep-1992  NF      Added the Undercore  tag in  the ListView editor.
                        Why did nobody notice that it wasn't there?  Also
                        changed the minimum  MaxChars in  the  STRING and
                        INTEGER gadgets from 2 to 1. (37.184)

   24-Sep-1992  NF-SA   Totally redone the menu  editors. Now all actions
                        are done  in  one  window and  more accoording to
                        the Style Guide.  Also the screen now only allows
                        GUI modes which  means that modes with a standard
                        horizontal  resolution  that  is  less  that  640
                        pixels are not  supported  anymore. (37.185)

   28-Sep-1992  NF      Now GadToolsBox uses the new  gadtoolsbox.library
                        which is still in a early stage  but progressing.
                        This  will be  a  library  containing  some  very
                        usefull routines when  working with  gadtools and
                        it will  help  people  to write  external  source
                        generators for GadToolsBox (37.186)

   28-Sep-1992  MIN     Now GadToolsBox does not see a slider or scroller
                        that broadcasts a up & down  message as a double-
                        click. Bug found by Marcel Offermans. (37.187)

   01-Oct-1992  MIN     GadToolsBox did not  work with  PopUpMenu. Now it
                        does.  Bug found  by  Kai Bolay/Micheal  Hohmann.
                        (37.188)

   03-Oct-1992  NF      Started  to  use  the  "gadtoolsbox.library" it's
                        extremely easy and efficient hotkey handling. Now
                        only the menu editor uses it but  soon all gadget
                        hotkeys will be handled by the library. (37.189)

   05-Oct-1992  NF-SA   Now the right mouse button can be used  to cancel
                        operations. Suggested by several people. (37.190)

   06-Oct-1992  SA      Moved the version string closer to the  beginning
                        of  the  executable.  Suggested  by   Roy van der
                        Woning (37.191).

   18-Oct-1992  MAJ     Still working  on  the  re-designed GUI.  Found a
                        wierd join/split bug.  GadToolsBox  would totally
                        screw up the joining and splitting of  string and
                        listview gadgets. (37.192)

   22-Oct-1992  MAJ     When deleting the  contents  of a  string  gadget
                        and then  editing  that same  gadget  could/would
                        cause  a  big  ugly  GURU.   Bug  found  by Garry
                        Glendown. (37.193)

   24-Oct-1992  MIN     Fixed the  routine that  checks for  double  used
                        gadget source labels. (37.194)

   26-Oct-1992  NF      Added a great new feature. I have changed the old
                        style move/size to the same method used  by Tool-
                        maker and Precognition which  is really 1.000.000
                        times better that the old way. (37.195)

   27-Oct-1992  MIN     The GA_Disabled tag of the  Cycle gadget  was not
                        processed  correctly.      Bug  found  by  Marcel
                        Offermans. (37.196)

   28-Oct-1992  MIN     Fixed a wierd bug.  GTB uses  the  nofrag.library
                        for its memory allocations. The nofrag.library is
                        a library which takes big blocks from  the system
                        free memory pool in which small memory chunks are
                        allocated. The  nofrag.library  automatically de-
                        allocates unused  memory  blocks.   Because  of a
                        de-allocation error withing GTB a small amount of
                        bytes where  left  in  each  memory  block  which
                        caused the nofrag.library to think that the block
                        was still in use and  therefore it  did  not  de-
                        allocate it.   This  would   leave   the   memory
                        allocated while GTB was running. (37.197)

   28-Oct-1992  MIN     Added   window  switching  using  the   keyboard.
                        Suggested by someone.... ( I forgot  who  it was,
                        SHAME ON ME!) (37.198)

   28-Oct-1992  MIN     Fixed  a   bug  with  the  information  printing.
                        Sometimes GadToolsBox  printed that  there was no
                        information on a window while in fact  there  was
                        information on the window.  Bug  found by several
                        people. (37.199)

   02-Nov-1992  NF-SA   Now you can use F9 to switch the screen title-bar
                        on and off. Note that this only works with  BACK
                        DROP windows. Suggested   by   Klaus  Nachtigall.
                        (37.200)

   07-Nov-1992  CH      The "Add" item under the "Gadgets" menu  has been
                        renamed to "Edit".  When it  is  checked  you can
                        edit the gadgets as  normal  and  when it  is not
                        checked the gadgets are  added  to the  window as
                        normal gadgets and you cannot add  or edit  them.
                        (37.204)

   07-Nov-1992  MIN     Fixed a small bug in  the menu  editor concerning
                        the CommKey's. (37.205)

   09-Nov-1992  MIN     The drag-menu-selection screwed  up  sometimes by
                        not interpreting menu events because the  handler
                        was not always  correctly  notified  about  drag-
                        selection breaks. (37.206)

   12-Nov-1992  NF      GadToolsBox now  uses a  new  set of  preferences
                        files. Also the changing  of the  preferences now
                        occurs in different requesters. (37.207)

   14-Nov-1992  NF-SA   Added the posibility to transform MX gadgets into
                        CYCLE gadgets  and vice versa.  Suggested by Reza
                        Elghazi. (37.208)

   14-Nov-1992  MAJ     Fixed an enforcer hit in the new menu editor. The
                        copying of the work menu list did not  work 100%.
                        (37.209)

   16-Nov-1992  NF      Added the possibility to seperatly  Save and Load
                        all gadgets or the selected gadget from  a window
                        using an IFF file structure. (37.210)

   18-Nov-1992  NF_SA   Added the possibility to  determine the  order of
                        TAB and SHIFT-TAB cycling for STRING  and INTEGER
                        gadgets.  Suggested  by  Garry Glendown  and Gael
                        Marziou. (37.211)

   21-Nov-1992  CH      Almost did not survive a mega HD crash (forgot to
                        backup my harddrive... AGAIN #$@$##@$!).  Changed
                        the main program menus. (37.212)

   22-Nov-1992  MAJ     Fixed a few bugs in the  source  generators.  The
                        IntuiText counters with multiple window  projects
                        was   screwed  up  in   the  C  and  Asm   source
                        generators.  The <xxx>Left  and <xxx>Top  globals
                        where incorrect  in  the  Asm and  Oberon  source
                        generators. Bugs found by Lars Hecking.  (37.213)

   22-Nov-1992  MAJ     The assembly source generator  really  screwed up
                        when more than one  GETFILE gadget was located in
                        a window. (37.214)

   27-Nov-1992  NF      Added the possibility to seperatly  Save and Load
