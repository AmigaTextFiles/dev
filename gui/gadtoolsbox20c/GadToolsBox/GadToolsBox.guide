 in the distribution without any modifications.   You may *NOT* charge more
 than Fred Fish does for a single library disk.

 This program may *not* be uploaded on BBS's that  claim copyrights  on the

 When you use this program to design  GUI(s) for  either a commercial  or a
 shareware  program  I would  appreciate a  little note about  this in  the
 program it's documentation.

 Commercial distribution of GadToolsBox and/or it's relative files is *NOT*
 allowed without written permission from the author.   This  also means the
 distribution on cover disks, disk magazines etc.

 I do not know how this is in other countries but  here in  holland and  in
 germany some PD distributors think  that  they can  charge  extra  if they
 translate  the  manual  in  their  language  and  distribute that with the
 program.

 THIS IS NOT ALLOWED! You are welcome to add a  translation to  this manual
 in the archive but you may NOT CHARGE EXTRA FOR THIS!

 The source and binary output of  GadToolsBox do not fall  under the  above
 mentioned rules. They fall under the rules that the person(s)  who created

## Introduction
##
@node introduction Introduction

 GadToolsBox  is a program that will save you a gigantic amount of time and
 anguish in  creating  a  GadTools  user interface  for your programs. This
 program is a follow-up of my other  source  generator  "PowerSource". It's
 main purpose is to let you create  your user interface without  having  to
 type  in  the  necessary  code  and structures  yourself.  This version of
 GadToolsBox has the following features:

## Requirements
##
@node requirements Requirements

 GadToolsBox was programmed with DICE C v2.07.54R (Thanks Matt) on a  A2500
 Kickstart  V37.175  Workbench  V37.67  with 7 MB  memory  +  ECS  +  A2630
 accelerator card (50MHz!!) + 52 MB harddisk. It should however run happily
 on  a 1 MB machine  without a  harddisk  and  special  chips but  at least
 1.5 MB and a harddisk is suggested.

 You need at least Kickstart V37++ and Workbench V37++ to run  GadToolsBox.
 A  C  Compiler  ( try registering DICE ) and/or an assembler  with the 2.0
 headers can  also come  in  handy  when you  try  to  compile/assemble the
 generated source. Note however that  the program  can  generate  assembler
 source which does not require the headers to assemble.

 The program needs the following libraries:

 reqtools.library           version 38 or better (required)
 icon.library               version 36 or better (required)
 nofrag.library             version 2  or better (required)
 diskfont.library           version 36 or better (required)
 iffparse.library           version 37 or better (required)
 gadtoolsbox.library        version 38 or better (required)
 powerpacker.library        version 35 or better (optional)

 If you have the nofrag.library v2.2 please use it instead of v2.1. Version
 2.2 is identical in function except that it has some bugs removed.  If you
 also  install  the  powerpacker.library v35++  you are able to load and/or
 save crunched binary files.

## *Read This *
##
@node readthis "*Read This*"

 There are older versions of the powerpacker.library V35 that cause  a GURU
 when decrunching data.   This GURU occures when you have both enforcer and
 mungwall running at the time the library is decrunching data.

## Starting GadToolsBox
##
@node starting "Starting GadToolsBox"

 You can run GadToolsBox from either the Shell or the  Workbench.  To start
 GadToolsBox from the Shell you must type the following:

    GadToolsBox [name]

 Where "name" is an optional name of a previously   created file  which you
 want to edit. To start GadToolsBox  from the  Workbench you should  either
 double-click it's icon or double-click  the icon  of a previously  created
 file.

 After  a  successfull  start  you  are presented  with a screen on which a
 little  window  is displayed.  This window is the "drawing board" on which
 you design your GUI.

 When you started GadToolsBox with an argument  the  contents of the window
 edited last will be displayed.

## Making a Gadget
##
@node making "Making a Gadget"

 Making a gadget is very simple. First of all you have to select the  kind
 of gadget you wish to make.  To do this you should  hold down  the  right
 mouse button and go to the Kind item under the Gadgets menu.

 Now you see a list of possible gadget kinds you can choose from.   Select
 the kind you want and release the right mouse button.

 Now mouse the mouse pointer to  where you  want the  top-left  corner  of
 the gadget to be.

 Click on the left-mouse button and  move  the  mouse  while  holding down
 the left mouse button.  You see a box which is following your  movements.
 Now move the box to the  exact  size  you want  it to be and  release the
 left mouse button.

 Now a requester pops  up in  which  you can  edit  the  gadget  kind  it's
 attributes.    Please  refer to the  @{ " Gadget Requesters " link requesters } chapter  for more
 information on this subject.  For now just  click on the OK gadget and you
 are done. You have created your first gadget with GadToolsBox.

 Note  that  the @{ " GETFILE " link getfile }, @{ " CHECKBOX " link checkbox }  and @{ " MX " link mx } gadgets have a fixed  size
 which means that you cannot make them any size you wish.
@endnode

##
## Gadget Selection
##
@node selection "Gadget Selection"

 To select a gadget you only have to click on it with the left mouse button.

 To select multiple gadgets a method simular to the Workbench icon selection
 is used. While you click on the gadgets you  want to  select you  must hold
 down a SHIFT key.

 It is also possible to select multiple  gadget  by  dragging a  box  around
 them.  This method is simular  to  multi-selecting icons  on the  Workbench
 except that you have to press SHIFT to get into DragSelection mode.

 This is how it works:

    a) Press and hold down a SHIFT key.
    b) Click on the left mouse button anywhere in the window where  there is
       no gadget located. You can release the SHIFT key now.
    c) Drag the box so that the gadgets that you want to  select are  partly
       or completely covered by the box.
    d) Release the left mouse button and you are done.

 You can see when a gadget is selected when it has 8 little  dots surrouding
 it.  Please refer to the @{ " Moving and Sizing " link movesize } chapter for information on the
 usage of these dots.
@endnode

##
## Moving and Sizing Gadgets
##
@node movesize "Moving and Sizing Gadgets"

 Moving and sizing gadgets is really simple. You can choose to move or size
 a single gadget or multiple gadgets at the same time.

 To move one gadget you must click on  the  gadget  using  the  left  mouse
 button. Now while  hoding down the left  mouse button you should  move the
 box to it's new location. Now release the mouse button and you are done.

 To size a single gadget you click  on  the  gadget  using the  left  mouse
 button. ..... It's OK, you can release the mouse button now.  Now  you see
 eight small dots surrounding the gadget ( somewhat simular to what you see
 here: )

  1       2       3
   \      |      /
    o-----o-----o
    |           |
    |           |
 4--o           o--5    <--- My pathetic attempt to a visual representation
    |           |            of what you actually see....
    |           |
    o-----o-----o
   /      |      \
  6       7       8

 These dots are the points which are used to size  the gadget.  This is how
 they operate:

    1)  Size the gadget in the north-west direction.
    2)  Size the gadget in the north direction.
    3)  Size the gadget in the north-east direction.
    4)  Size the gadget in the west direction.
    5)  Size the gadget in the east direction.
    6)  Size the gadget in the south-west direction.
    7)  Size the gadget in the south direction.
    8)  Size the gadget in the south-east direction.

 For example if you wish to size a gadget in the  east direction you select
 the gadget.  Click on dot number 5 and  move the mouse right while holding
 down the mouse button.   When you sized it  enough you  release the  mouse
 button again.

 Moving and sizing multiple gadget works  simular  to  moving and sizing  a
 single gadget.

                        option is on the program will prompt you  to enter
                        a password before it saves the file. You will need
                        this password when you try to load the file again.
                        NOTE:   This option  only  is  available  when the
                                Crunch option is on.

    Buffer              This gadget controls the buffer size which is used
                        to crunch the data.  You can  choose  from  Small,
                        Medium and Large.   The biggest buffer will crunch
                        fast but it takes up a lot of memory.
                        NOTE:   This option  only  is  available  when the
                                Crunch option is on.

    Type                This controls the crunch type used. You can choose
                        from Fast,  Mediocre,  Good,  Very Good  and Best.
                        Using Fast will cruch very  fast but the resulting
                        file will not be crunched as far as it  could  be.
                        Using Best will  crunch  somewhat  slower  but the
                        resulting file will be crunched the best way.
                        NOTE:   This option  only  is  available  when the
                                Crunch option is on.

    Coordinates         This allows you to turn the coordinates on or off.
                        The   coordinates  constantly  display  the  mouse
                        position relative to the upper left hand corner of
                        the window.

    Write Icon          Usually GadToolsBox writes an  icon  to  accompany
                        the saved GUI so that  you  can  use  it  from the
                        Workbench.  If you are a shell freak or you simply
                        do not want these icons you  can  tell GadToolsBox
                        not to save an icon by turning this gadget off.

    GZZ Adjust          GadToolsBox allows  you to  edit  your  GUI  on  a
                        GIMMEZEROZERO window.   Normally  when you  switch
                        from editing on a normal window to a GIMMEZEROZERO
                        window  or  vice versa  all  gadgets,  texts   and
                        borders will move.   This  is  because  on  normal
                        windows the coordinates  are  relative to the top-
                        left of the window and  on  GIMMEZEROZERO  windows
                        they are relative to the  top-left  of  the window
                        *inside* the window border area.  When this option
                        is turned on GadToolsBox will automatically adjust
                        the gadget, text and  border  coordinates  so that
                        they appear to be on the same location.

    Overwrite           When you try to save a  file  and  the  file  does
                        already exist you  will  be  notified  about  this
                        with a requester  allowing you  to  overwrite  the
                        file or to cancel the operation.  When this option
                        is turned  on  GadToolsBox  will  not  put up  the
                        requester.    Instead it will  overwrite  the file
                        immediatly. USE WITH CARE.

    ASL FileRequester   Some people  do not  seem  to  like  the  ReqTools
                        filerequester. I cannot imagine why but turning on
                        this option will tell  GadToolsBox to use  the ASL
                        filerequester instead of the ReqTools one.

    Font Adaptive       This option affects both the main program  and all
                        source generators.  When this option  is turned on
                        it tells the source generators to  generate source
                        that will automatically  adapt to  the used  font.
                        Please refer to  @{ " The Generate Source " link source } chapter and
                        the @{ " Font Adaptivity " link adaptivity } chapter for more info.  When
                        this option is  turned  on  GadToolsBox  will only
                        allow you to use the topaz 8 font for editing your
                        GUI for reasons explained  in  the  above mentined
                        chapters.

    Close Workbench     When this option  is  turned  on  GadToolsBox will
                        attempt to close the Workbench at startup.

    Use PubScreen       When this option is on and you are  editing  a GUI
                        for the workbench or the default public screen the
                        edit windows will appear on that screen.  In other
                        words -: GadToolsBox will not use  it's own screen
                                 in this case.

    Save                This will save your  settings to  the  GadToolsBox
                        preferences directory.

    Use                 This will activate the preferences in the program.

## Project/Preferences/C Source...
##
@node cprefs "Project/Preferences/C Source..."

 This  option  allows  you  to  control  certan  aspects  of the  C source
 generator. You will see the following gadgets in the requester:

    Static              Normally all data  generated  by  GadToolsBox will
                        be exported so that it can be accessed  from other
                        modules. When this option is on the data generated
                        by GadToolsBox will not be exported.

    Generate OpenFont   When this option is on and you are  generating the
                        source for a GUI which  uses  a  disk  based  font
                        GadToolsBox will also include the  code  that will
                        open and close the used font.
                        NOTE:   This  option  is not  available  when  the
                                @{ " Font Adaptive " link mainprefs } option is on.

    Use System Font     When this option is on the  generated  source will
                        adapt to the system default font. When this option
                        is off the  generated  source  will use the screen
                        font to adapt to.
                        NOTE:   This  option  is only available  when  the
                                @{ " Font Adaptive " link mainprefs } option is on.

    Include Pragmas     Some  C  compilers,  SAS & Manx,  use  pragmas  to
                        create inline calls to the system libraries.  When
                        this  option  is  on  the  generated  source  will
                        include the necesarry pragma headers.

    Aztec C             The Manx compiler  needs  a  special  type-cast to
                        correctly   initialize  the  TagItem  arrays  that
                        GadToolsBox generates.  When this option is turned
                        on GadToolsBox will use that type-cast so that the
                        source will also compile using the Manx compiler.

    Generate IDCMP      This option allows you to tell GadToolsBox to also
    Handler             generate  an  IDCMP  handler.    Please  refer  to
                        @{ " The IDCMP Handler " link handler } chapter for more info.

    Generate Templates  This option,  when switched on,  tells GadToolsBox
                        to generate a templates file which  contains a set
                        of empty routines that the IDCMP Handler can call.
                        You should use this file as a reference or to fill
                        in with  your  own  code.   This  option  is  only
                        available when the "Generate IDCMP Handler" option
                        is turned on.

    Save                This will save your  settings to  the  GadToolsBox
                        preferences directory.

    Use                 This will activate the preferences in the program.

    Cancel              This aborts the operation.

## Project/Preferences/Asm Source...
##
@node asmprefs "Project/Preferences/Asm Source..."

 This  option  allows  you  to  control  certan  aspects  of the  assembly
 source generator. You will see the following gadgets in the requester:

    Static              Normally all data  generated  by  GadToolsBox will
                        be exported so that it can be accessed  from other
                        modules. When this option is on the data generated
                        by GadToolsBox will not be exported.

    Raw Source          Normally the generated source will need the OS 2.0
                        headers to assemble.    With this option turned on
                        you  are  able  to  assemble  to  generated source
                        without using the headers.

    Generate OpenFont   When this option is on and you are  generating the
                        source for a GUI which  uses  a  disk  based  font
                        GadToolsBox will also include the  code  that will
                        open and close the used font.
                        NOTE:   This  option  is not  available  when  the
                                @{ " Font Adaptive " link mainprefs } option is on.

    Use System Font     When this option is on the  generated  source will
                        adapt to the system default font. When this option
                        is off the  generated  source  will use the screen
                        font to adapt to.
                        NOTE:   This  option  is only available  when  the
                                @{ " Font Adaptive " link mainprefs } option is on.

    Use amiga.lib       When this option is on all  system  calls  will be
                        externally referenced from the amiga.lib using the
                        _LVOxxxx references.   When this is off the source
                        will contain equates  that  define the  offsets of
                        the system calls.

    Save                This will save your  settings to  the  GadToolsBox

 *************************************************************************

 The source output of GadToolsBox is divided into two  separate files. The
 first file is a header (.h|.i)  containing  EXTERNS or XREF'S to the data
 in the  generated main source and  CONSTANTS  for  the  gadget  ID's  and
 the positions of the gadgets in the  Gadget  Array.

 The  second  file  (.c|.s) (from  here  on  referred   to as "main file")
 contains all data and routines to set-up things.

 From here on when I refer to <Project_Name>  I mean the name  entered  in
 the @{ " Edit Data " link datawindow }  requester  from  the  Window  menu  and  when I refer to
 <Gadget_Label> I mean the  name  you  have  typed  in the "Label"  gadget
 of one  of the  @{ " gadget kind requesters " link requesters }.   When I refer to  <Menu_Label>
 I mean the label you have typed in the Label  gadget of the @{ " Menu Editor " link menueditor }

 In  the  main  file  the following routines are generated:

   »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
   » long SetupScreen( void );                                         »
   »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
    This routine will open or lock the screen and get it's visual info.
    When requested this routine will also  open the font.  Also it will
    setup the boopsi image for the @{ " GETFILE " link getfile } gadget when  such a gadget
    is used.  This  routine  can  return  one of the following errors:

        0 = No error.
        1 = Could not open or lock the screen.
        2 = Could not get the screen it's visual info.
        3 = Could not set-up the GETFILE boopsi class.
        4 = Could not get a GETFILE boopsi object.
        5 = Could not open the font.

   »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
    This routine will free the resources taken by "SetupScreen()".  You
    must still call this routine when  "SetupScreen()"  failed to close
    and free the resources that didn't fail to open!!!

    There are as much of these routines as there are Project Windows in
    the file you have generated. These routines will set-up the gadgets
    and menus and open the window. These routines can return one of the
    following errors:

        0 = No error.
        1 = Could not create a gadget context.
        2 = Error during the gadget creation.
        3 = Could not create the menus.
        4 = Could not open the window.

    Each Project Window which has texts and/or BevelBoxes  attached  to
    it will have a routine which renders these texts and/or  BevelBoxes
    in the window. This routine must also be called by the user program
    upon  receiving  a IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW message at the  window port.
    When such a message  is received  this  routine   must  be   called
    between   the   GT_BeginRefresh()  and GT_EndRefresh() calls.  Here
    is a  small example of what I mean:

        while( 1 ) {
            WaitPort( <Project_Name>Wnd->UserPort );
            while( imsg = GT_GetIMsg( <Project_Name>Wnd->UserPort )) {

                Class = imsg->Class;
                GT_ReplyIMsg( imsg );

                switch ( Class ) {

                    case    IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW:
                        GT_BeginRefresh( Project_Name>Wnd );

                        /* re-draw texts and boxes */
                        <Project_Name>Render();

                        GT_EndRefresh( <Project_Name>Wnd, TRUE );
                        break;

                    .....
                }
            }
        }

    Note  that the  above  is automatically done by the generated IDCMP
    event-handler.

 The main file also has the following globals defined  which are shared by
 all project windows:

    struct Screen *Scr;          A pointer to the opened/locked screen
    APTR           VisualInfo;   A pointer to the visual info

 The following globals are only  generated when the file contains  gadgets
 or menus and when the OpenFont routine is generated and  when  the window
 must have a zoom gadget:

    struct Gadget   *<Project_Name>GList;   The created gadgets
    struct Menu     *<Project_Name>Menus;   The created menus
    WORD             <Project_Name>Zoom[4]; The window alternate positions
    struct TextFont *Font;                  The opened font

 Also  generated  are  pointers for each project window that is in memory.
 Also the window title is generated as a global  pointer.   These pointers
 are generated as follows:

    struct Window   *<Project_Name>Wnd;    A pointer to the window
    UBYTE           *<Project_Name>Wdt;    A pointer to the window title

 When you have generated source for the Workbench or Default Public screen
 a global is generated which is a pointer to the name of the public screen
 to open on. It is generated as follows:

    When generated for the Workbench screen:

    UBYTE          *PubScreenName = "Workbench";

    When generated for the Default Public screen:

    UBYTE          *PubScreenName = NULL;

 This  will  allow you  to change the name of the public screen to open on
 with out having to hack in the generated source.

 Four words are generated for each window. These words contain the  window
 it's left  and top-edge  and the window  it's width  and height.    These
 globals are build as follows:

    UWORD       <Project_Name>Left;     Window left-edge
    UWORD       <Project_Name>Top;      Window top-edge
    UWORD       <Project_Name>Width;    Window width
    UWORD       <Project_Name>Height;   Window height

 These  words   should  be changed by  the  application if  the  user  has
 re-sized or re-positioned the window. This way when the window  is closed
 and  then re-opened again it will be opened the size and  position it had
 the last time it was open. Note: When the user has changed the window you
 _must_ substract the window top-border size from the window height before
 setting in the "<Project_Name>Height" global.  Here is  a  little example
 of what I mean:

    int <Project_Name>ChangeWindow( void )
    {
        <Project_Name>Left   = <Project_Name>Wnd->LeftEdge;
        <Project_Name>Top    = <Project_Name>Wnd->TopEdge;
        <Project_Name>Width  = <Project_Name>Wnd->Width;
        <Project_Name>Height = <Project_Name>Wnd->Height - Wnd->BorderTop;
        return( 1 );
    }

 Or when the IDCMP handler isn't generated:

    while( 1 ) {
        WaitPort( <Project_Name>Wnd->UserPort );
        while( imsg = GT_GetIMsg( <Project_Name>Wnd->UserPort )) {

            Class = imsg->Class;
            GT_ReplyIMsg( imsg );

            switch ( Class ) {

                case    IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW:
                    <Project_Name>Left   = <Project_Name>Wnd->LeftEdge;
                    <Project_Name>Top    = <Project_Name>Wnd->TopEdge;
                    <Project_Name>Width  = <Project_Name>Wnd->Width;
                    <Project_Name>Height = <Project_Name>Wnd->Height -
                                           <Project_Name>Wnd->BorderTop;
                    break;

                    .....
                }
            }
        }

 Also the main  file contains  the Gadget  Array's for each project window
 which are define as follows:

 struct Gadget *<Project_Name>Gadgets[];

 To access the pointers in this array the  program  generates  DEFINES  or
 EQU'S in the header file which specify the position of  a certain  gadget
 in  the array. These defines are build as follows:

 #define GDX_<Gadget_Label>

 Be  sure  that  the   "gadtools.library",  "intuition.library","graphics.
 library" and "utility.library" are all open BEFORE any of the   generated
 routines is called.     When  you  use  a  diskfont  and  the   "Generate
 OpenFont" switch is on in the Asm or C Preferences window the  "diskfont.
 library" must also be opened.

 For  the assembler  source   the  valid pointers to  these libraries must
 be  stored globally with  the  names  "_GadToolsBase",  "_IntuitionBase",
 "_GfxBase", "_UtilityBase" and "_DiskfontBase" otherwise you get problems
 linking.

 NOTE: When you use font adaptable  source which adapts to the system font
       you  also  need  to open  the  "diskfont.library"   and   store the
       pointer in a global called "_DiskfontBase" for the assembly source.

 *************************************************************************

 In version 37.157++ of GadToolsBox the C source  generator will  generate
 an IDCMP handler when wanted. This IDCMP  handler  is a  bit experimental
 and it will be changed. The generated IDCMP handler  will work  for  most
 people but some may not like  the way  it has  been  done.

 As of version 37.157 GadToolsBox generates an IDCMP handler  routine  for
 each IDCMP flag.  This  handler  will process all incoming IDCMP messages
 from the window and it will also process   all  gadget  and  menu events.
 GadToolsBox generates the following routine(s) for the event-handling:

   »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
   » int Handle<Project_Name>IDCMP( void );                            »
   »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
   This is the main IDCMP event-handler.  There will be as many of these
   routines in the file as there are windows in the file you  generated.
   You must call this routine when you have received a signal that there
   is a message pending at the window port. This routine will return the
   value that the IDCMP specific routine returns.   This return code can
   be used to quit the program etc.

   »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
   » int Handle<Project_Name>Verify( void );                           »
   »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
   All windows in the generated file which has one or more of the VERIFY
   flags turned on will have this routine.  The handling  of the  VERIFY
   events differs from the normal event  in  that the routine  is called
   _BEFORE_ the message is replyed.  This means that  the  routines  for
   these verify messages should _NOT_ take to long to return.

 The  routine  labels  called  for  by  the  various  IDCMP  messages  are
 constructed the following way:

    Flag                            Routine Name
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS              <Project_Name>MouseButtons();
    IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE                 <Project_Name>MouseMove();
    IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW               <Project_Name>CloseWindow();
    IDCMP_MENUVERIFY                <Project_Name>MenuVerify();
    IDCMP_MENUHELP                  <Project_Name>MenuHelp();
    IDCMP_REQSET                    <Project_Name>ReqSet();
    IDCMP_REQCLEAR                  <Project_Name>ReqClear();
    IDCMP_REQVERIFY                 <Project_Name>ReqVerify();
    IDCMP_NEWSIZE                   <Project_Name>NewSize();
    IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY                <Project_Name>SizeVerify();
    IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW              <Project_Name>ActiveWindow();
    IDCMP_INACTIVEWINDOW            <Project_Name>InActiveWindow();
    IDCMP_VANILLAKEY                <Project_Name>VanillaKey();
    IDCMP_RAWKEY                    <Project_Name>RawKey();
    IDCMP_NEWPREFS                  <Project_Name>NewPrefs();
    IDCMP_DISKINSERTED              <Project_Name>DiskInserted();
    IDCMP_DISKREMOVED               <Project_Name>DiskRemoved();
    IDCMP_INTUITICKS                <Project_Name>IntuiTicks();
    IDCMP_IDCMPUPDATE               <Project_Name>IDCMPUpdate();
    IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW              <Project_Name>ChangeWindow();

 This means that when you receive an IDCMP_MENUHELP message at your window
 the IDCMP event-handler will automatically call <Project_Name>MenuHelp().

 The Menu and Gadget events are processed a little differently.   For each
 gadget and menu a reference to a routine is generated. The gadget routine
 labels are constructed as follows:

    <Gadget_Label>Clicked();

 And the menu routine labels are constructed as:

    <Project_Name><Menu_Label>();

 None of the routines  called for by  the  generated event-handler will be
 passed any arguments. You can get the IDCMP event specific  data  from  a
 global copy of the arrived message.   Each  window  in the generated file
 will have a copy of the IntuiMessage that arrived at the window port. The
 source generator will generate a struct  IntuiMessage for each window and
 the label for those IntuiMessage is constructed as follows:

    struct IntuiMessage <Project_Name>Msg;

 The contents of the message that  arrives at  the  window  port  will  be
 copied into this   IntuiMessage  before  the  IDCMP  specific  routine is
 called.  This way you can get the data you need from the IntuiMessage.

 When  you  have  the  "Templates" option switched on the source generator
 will also generate a file with  template routines  for each  routine  the
 IDCMP event-handlers will call.   The  name  of the  generated sources is
 constructed as follows:

 When you generate your source as "Source.c" the files  generated  will be
 called:

    Source.c       -   The main source file
    Source.h       -   The source header file
    Source_temp.c  -   The template source file

 The way the gadget  and/or menu  routines are called  is done by  setting
 the address of the routine in question  in  the  UserData  field  of  the
 gadget/menu. Then when the IDCMP   event-handler  receives  a gadget/menu
 message the routine address is picked out of  the  gadget/menu  structure
 and then called.

 This is a  whole  lot  smaller and faster than to setup a big switch/case
 table.

 To keep things clean the source generator will not generate  routines for
 Menus, Items with subitems, BARLABEL (sub)items, TEXT gadgets and  NUMBER
 gadgets. These menus and gadgets never generate an  IDCMP event  so  it's
 not necessary to generate routines for them.

 The generated menu-event  handler  supports  drag-selection  which is the
 only official way to handle menu messages.

## Font Adaptivity
##
@node adaptivity "Font Adaptivity"

 When you are editing a  font  adaptive  GUI  the  source  generators will
 create source  that  will automatically adapt the gadget,  bevel-box  and
 window sizes and positions to the  active font. The resulting source also
 checks to see wether or not the window will fit on  the  screen.    If it
 doesn't  fit anymore the topaz 8 font will be used.

 GadToolsBox will allow  you  to  use  any  font  when  designing  a  font
 adaptible GUI.  Please be  extra  carefull  when you design using a large
 font because if you would (for example)  create a SCROLLER  of  10 pixels
 high and  at run  time  a  smaller  font  is  active  the  routine   that
 re- calculates the gadget could make the SCROLLER to small.

 In the generated source a routine called  "ComputeFont()"  is  generated.
 This routine calculates the font  size  and it will  check if the  window
 still fit's on the screen using the font.   If  the  window  does not fit
 anymore this routine will automatically switch to the topaz 8 font.  This
 routine is always static and you should never need to call this yourself.

 Two kinds  of  adaptable  source  can be generated.   The first kind uses
 the font of the screen on which the window opens and the second  will use
 the system default font (GfxBase->DefaultFont).

 Also two routines called  "ComputeX()"  and  "ComputeY()"  are  generated
 which  re-calculate  the  horizontal  (X) and vertical (Y) values for the
 gadgets, bevel-boxes, windows and texts.

 NOTE: You should take special care when you place fixed-size gadgets like
 the CheckBox, GetFile and MX gadgets. Because they  have a fixed size the
 gadgets are not "size-adapted" with different fonts.

 At this time there really isn't much to say about the program.    It is a
 tool that will ( or at least should ) save you a lot of time  in creating
 a GadTools user interface for your programs.

 When a big font is used in the program it can happen that some requesters
 won't fit on the screen anymore. Intuition will automatically re-size the
 requester so that it will fit on the screen but some gadgets might not be
 reachable anymore.

 When  you  want  to save and load crunched GUI(s) you  must copy the V35+
 version of the powerpacker.library  in your libs: directory  and you must
 set-up T: as a logical device.    To do this you must have something like
 this in your startup-sequence:

        MakeDir RAM:T
        Assign  T:  RAM:T

 If   someone   wants  to  translate this  manual  into  her/his  language
 permission is hereby granted.  The only thing I ask is that you send me a
 copy of  the translation  so that  I can  distribute  it with  the   next
 release of  the program.

 Although  this program  itself  does  not  follow all the rules described
 in  the  "User Interface Style Guide" I still strongly suggest you try to
 follow  the  rules  described in  that  guide.

 From  v1.3  on  GadToolsBox  has an  embedded version string in the "User
 Interface Style Guide" format. When  submitting a bug-report  please tell
 me the version of the GadToolsBox  program you are using.   This  can  be
 established by  typing  "Version GadToolsBox" in  the shell.  Also before
 you start sending me bug-reports and suggestions please  read  the "TODO"
 file first.

 This is a program for programmers.   A lot of things in the manual  might
 not be clear to other Amiga users.  If you plan to program the Amiga  you
 should at least get the RKM  manuals:  Libraries,  Devices,  Includes and
 AutoDocs, User Interface Style Guide.     Also  one  or  two  good  books
 concerning the language you wish to learn are essential.  I'm  not saying
 this  because I like to see you throwing your money  away but it's almost
 impossible  to program the Amiga without good documentation.

 Never make changes to the source that GadToolsBox generates.   You should
 not do this because each time you re-generate the source you have to make
 these changes again.   You  should  always  code  your  program  specific
 routines and stuff in one or more seperate modules.   This  way  you  can
 always  add  things  to  your  GUI  using  GadToolsBox without having the
 trouble of  adding other things to the GadToolsBox generated  source over
 and over again.

 Although GadToolsBox generates very compact source  there might  be  some
 things that you think are strange.   For example when you generate source
 for a window with ten GETFILE  gadgets  and you  look at the  source  the
 Gadget Kind array will show GENERIC_KIND 10 times and  the gadget TagItem
 array will show TAG_DONE 10 times.    This  is  the way the source works.
 Do not try to enhance  it to  save a  couple  of bytes  in the  resulting
 executable. Please remember that it's machine generated source.    Coding
 this  stuff by  hand might save you a few bytes on the executable size of
 the resulting program but using GadToolsBox will save you hours and hours
 of boring GUI coding.

 Some people have asked me how they could determine the size of the window
 they had created. This is really simple.  Move the mouse pointer past the
 right and bottom edge of the window and the coordinates will tell you the
 size the window has.
