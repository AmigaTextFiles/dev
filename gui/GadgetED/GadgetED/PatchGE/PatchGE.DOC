 This program  is provided  to upgrade  GadgetED version  2.0 binary files to
 load in GadgetED version 2.1 and up.  When you start PatchGE from the CLI or
 Workbench  a window  appears with  some empty  information  lines and  three
 gadgets in it. When you select the "Load GE file"  gadget the file requester
 appears in which you can type or select the name of the GadgetED version 2.0
 binary file you want patched. Once the file has loaded the information lines
 are filled with the data of the file. Now you can select the "Save GE Patch"
 gadget to save the patched file to disk. Selecting "Quit" will terminate the
 program.

 Have fun with the new version of GadgetED !
