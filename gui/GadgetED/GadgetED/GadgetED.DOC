                                I. OVERVIEW
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 GadgetED is designed to save the Amiga programmer a  lot of time in creating
 intuition gadgets. This version of GadgetED has the following features:

    o - editing gadgets for a workbench or a custom screen.
    o - editing gadgets for a window or a requester.
    o - full control over the window flags.
    o - adding, modifying, moving and deleting texts for gadgets and window.
    o - adding, editing, moving, re-sizing, deleting and copying of gadgets.
    o - editing gadgets with the "WB 2.0" look.
    o - loading IFF-ILBM brushes as gadget rendering.
    o - loading IFF-ILBM colormaps for custom screens.
    o - a palette editor to create your own custom colours.
    o - title line gadget information.
    o - fully mouse and keyboard controlled.
    o - generation of source code in C or Assembler.
    o - generation of Assembler source which does not need the intuition
        headers to assemble.
    o - generation of static data & structures in C.
    o - binary saving for later loading and editing.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           II. REQUIREMENTS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 GadgetED was  programmed in  Aztec C V5.0a  on an  Amiga 500  Kick 1.3  with
 2 Meg memory  and a  20Meg HardDisk but it  should run  on a  standard 512 K
 machine. What you do need to work with  GadgetED is a C  Compiler  and/or an
 Assembler with all the standard include files. GadgetED also requires a copy
 of  the "tool.library",  which is also on this disk,  to be  copied into the
 LIBS: directory of the GadgetED  boot disk.  This program is tested with the
 NTSC-PAL program by Nico François (FISH 387) in NTSC mode and it ran fine so
 it should not  give any problems on  NTSC machines  unless you try to load a
 GE file that contains a window out of NTSC limits.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         III. STARTING GADGETED
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 GadgetED can be run from the CLI or the workbench.  If you run GadgetED from
 the workbench all you have to do is double-click the "GadgetED"  icon or one
 of  the "GE" icons.   If you want  to run  GadgetED from  the CLI  just type
 "GadgetED [filename]" where "filename" is an  optional name of the "GE" file
 you want to edit. When you have started GadgetED without a filename a little
 window opens in the middle of the screen with the following gadgets:

    WINDOW      - selecting this gadget tells GadgetED that you want to
                  edit gadgets for a window.
    REQUESTER   - selecting this gadget tells GadgetED that you want to
                  edit gadgets for a requester.
    1           - custom screen, depth = 1, 2  colors.
    2           - custom screen, depth = 2, 4  colors.
    3           - custom screen, depth = 3, 8  colors.
    4           - custom screen, depth = 4, 16 colors. (SLOWS UP THE 68000)
    5           - custom screen, depth = 5, 32 colors.
    WORKBENCH   - if you select this gadget GadgetED still opens it's own
                  screen but the colors are the same as your workbench and
                  the generated structures will be for the workbench screen.

 When you are done click "OK"  and a screen opens with a little window on it.
 If you click on "CANCEL" you leave the program again.

 NOTE:  If you have  selected to edit gadgets for a  requester you will see a
        window with a colored rectangle in it.  This rectangle represents the
        requester you are working on.  You can size and  position the  window
        in order to get the requester how and where you want it.

 Now let's create our first gadget.  Move the mouse pointer to where you want
 the top-left corner of  the gadget  to be and  click the left  mouse button.
 If you look at the screen title now you will see some information displayed.
 This information means, from left to right:

    o - the mouse pointer X coordinate.
    o - the mouse pointer Y coordinate.
    o - the gadget left edge.
    o - the gadget top edge.
    o - the gadget width.
    o - the gadget height.

 NOTE: The values are relative to the top-left corner of the window/requester
       This  information  is important to place  and size your gadget exactly
       the way it should be.

 If you move the mouse pointer the values in  the info-line will change and a
 box will follow the mouse pointer  relative to the top-left corner. This box
 represents the gadget. When the box is the way you want the gadget to be you
 must click the left mouse button  again and the  gadget will be added to the
 window or requester. Now you have created your first gadget with GadgetED so
 let's take a look at the menus to see what else you can do.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         IV. THE PROJECT MENU
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This menu consists of the following items:

 About:    <right Amiga ?>

 Function: display  information about  the copyright,  the author  etc.  Just
           click on the CONTINUE gadget to get rid of it.

 New:      <right Amiga N>

 Function: erases all gadgets and changes made  sofar and resets  the display
           to the default.  If the changes  made where  not saved a requester
           opens  telling you  this and asking  you if you really  want to do
           this. Click on the NO gadget if you made a mistake by calling this
           function otherwise click on the YES gadget.
           NOTE: If you proceed  with this function and the changes where not
                 saved there is no way to get back the information.

 Load:     <right Amiga L>

 Function: This opens the file requester. In this file requester you can type
           or select the name of the 'GE' file you want to load.
           NOTE: The program only loads 'GE' files. If you try to load a file
                 that is not a 'GE' file a requester appears telling you that
                 the file you have selected was of an Unknown type.
           When the file you have selected is successfully loaded. The screen
           displays now displays the gadgets e.c.t. found in the file.

 Save:     <right Amiga S>

 Function: This opens the file  requester in  which you can  type or select a
           name under which the  current display  is saved. You should always
           save  the display  before you exit  the program.  This ensures the
           file is  always up to date.  If you do not save the display before
           quitting  the program  any changes  made since  the last  time you
           saved will be lost.

 Generate Source:
 C:        <right Amiga C>

 Function: This generates the source code in C of the  display  edited sofar.
           In the file requester you can type or select the name  under which
           the generated source code is saved.

 Assembler:  <right Amiga A>

 Function: As with C only the generated source code is in MC68000 Assembler.


 Preferences: <right Amiga P>

 Function: This is used to (un)set certain preferred  program flags. It opens
           a window with the following gadgets:

  Skip zero bit-planes     : This tells GadgetED to  skip any image bitplanes
                             that only contains zero's.  This will reduce the
                             size of the image data source GadgetED generates.
  Auto Gadget -> Image size: This  tells GadgetED to automatically adjust the
                             dimensions of the  gadget to the  dimensions  of
                             the loaded image.
  Image Copy               : This tells GadgetED to also copy any images that
                             might be attached to a gadget.
  Text Copy                : This tells GadgetED to also copy any  texts that
                             might be attached to a gadget.
  Static Structures        : This tells GadgetED  to  generate  "static" data
                             and structures if C source is generated.
  RAW Assembler Source     : This tells GadgetED to generate numbers  instead
                             of standard intuition  names for the flags, etc.
                             when assembler source is generated.  This  makes
                             it  possible  to  assemble the  generated source
                             without having to include the intuition headers.
  WINDOW or REQUESTER      : Switch  from editing  gadgets  for  a window  to
                             editing gadgets for a requester or viceversa.
  Save                     : Save the preferences to a file called
                             'DEVS:GadgetED.PREFS'.
  Use                      : Set the preferences in the program.
  Save & Use               : Both save and set these preferences.


 Close WorkBench or
 Open  WorkBench:

 Function: This enables you to close/open the workbench screen. You can close
           the  workbench screen  if your  (!!computer!!) memory is running a
           little low.
           NOTE: It's only possible  to close the  workbench screen  if there
                 are no programs running that use the workbench screen.  This
                 means that if you  started GadgetED  from the  CLI it is not
                 possible to close the workbench  screen because the CLI is a
                 program that makes use of the workbench screen.

 Quit:     <right Amiga Q>

 Function: Quits GadgetED if  you select YES  in the requester that opened to
           ask you to if you really want to do this.


 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         V. THE GADGETS MENU
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In this menu  a lot of functions are defined which asks you to pick a gadget

 Under GADGET TYPE:

  BOOL         - make this gadget a boolean gadget.
  PROPORTIONAL - make this gadget a prop gadget.
  STRING       - make this gadget a string gadget.
  BORDERONLY   - this is  a special  flag not  defined by intuition but it is
                 used to tell  GadgetED only to generate the border structure
                 of this gadget in the source code. This flag can only be set
                 on a BOOL gadget that has no texts or images attached to it.
  GZZGADGET    - this flag should be  set with gadgets that are in the border
                 of a GIMMEZEROZERO window.
  NOBORDER     - this is a special flag not  defined by  intuition  but it is
                 used to tell GadgetED  not to generate  source of the border
                 of this gadget.  The border  will  still  be present  during
                 editing but will not show in the generated source. This flag
                 can only  be set  on BOOL and  STRING gadgets with no images
                 attached to it.
  OS2BORDER    - this is a special flag not  defined by  intuition  but it is
                 used  to tell  GadgetED to  put a "WB 2.0" border around the
                 gadget. This gives the impression, if the WB 2.0  colors are
                 set, that the gadgets lie on top of the window.

 Selecting OK will set the  flags edited  to the gadget  and selecting CANCEL
 will resume to editing without setting the edited flags.

           custom screen.  In the  file requester  you can type or select the
           name of the IFF ILBM file  which contains  the colors you want set
           in your edit screen.  If the  loading was successful the colors in
           the file are now set in the edit screen.

 Edit ColorMap:        <F10>

 Function: This function is only available when you are editing gadgets for a
           custom screen. In the  palette  editor  you can edit each color of
           the edit screen.  With the R, G and B prop gadgets you can set the
           RED, GREEN and BLUE values of the selected color.  With the 2,4,8,
           16 or 32 (depending on the screen depth) colored gadgets below you
           can select the color to edit.  Selecting  OK will  set the  edited
           colors in the edit screen and resume to editing.  RESET will reset
           the  colors as  they where before  you have  entered  the  palette
           editor.  CANCEL will resume  to editing without setting the edited
           colors.

 Refresh all gadgets:  <HELP>

 Function: If  for some  reason the  display is  distorted you  can call this
           function to redraw the entire display.

 OS-2 Border colors:   -----

 Function: This item enables you to set the  "LightSide"  and the  "DarkSide"
           color of the OS-2 borders.  The color  currently  selected  in the
           "FPen" menu represents the "LightSide" of the gadget and the color
           selected in the "BPen" menu represents the "DarkSide".

 Depending on whether you are editing gadgets for a window or a requester the
 next item will read:

 Window or Requester:

 The items  'Add a text', 'Modify a text',  'Delete a text' and 'Move a text'
 perform the same action as the functions in 'Gadget text' with the exception
 that the  texts are  assigned to  the window or  requester rather  than to a
 gadget.

 When you are editing gadgets for a window two items are displayed:

 Edit Flags:     <right Amiga F>

 Function: This will  bring up  a window  in which  all  the intuition window
           Flags are displayed:

  WINDOWSIZING    - the window sizing gadget is included.
  WINDOWDRAG      - the window can be dragged around with the title bar.
  WINDOWDEPTH     - the window can be put on top or below another window.
  WINDOWCLOSE     - the close window gadget is included.
  SIZEBRIGHT      - the sizing gadget is placed in the right window border.
  SIZEBBOTTOM     - the sizing gadget is placed in the bottom window border.
  NOCAREREFRESH   - intuition  does not  send a  message to  the window  if a
                    refresh is necessary.
  SIMPLE_REFRESH  - intuition  does no  refreshing  at all.  the program must
                    refresh the window itself when necessary.
  SMART_REFRESH   - any overlapped part of  the window  will be  buffered and
                    restored when possible.
  SUPER_BITMAP    - the window can handle a  graphics display  that is larger
                    than the window itself.
  BACKDROP        - the window is always behind all other windows.
  GIMMEZERZERO    - the window border is handled extra.  You  should  NOT put
                    gadgets in the  window border  of a GIMMEZEROZERO  window
                    without  setting the  GZZGADGET  flag in the  gadget  its
                    activation  field.  Also  you should  not  put  texts  or
                    BORDERONLY gadgets in the window border because when  the
                    generated  source is  assembled/compiled  these won't  or
                    only partly show.
  BORDERLESS      - the window border is not displayed.
  ACTIVATE        - the window is activated as soon as it opens.
  REPORTMOUSE     - the mouse pointer position is always reported.
  RMBTRAP         - the  possibility  to get  a message  if the  right  mouse
                    button is pressed.  This can only be used if there are no
                    menus attached to the window.

 NOTE: Only WINDOWSIZING,  WINDOWDRAG,  WINDOWDEPTH,  WINDOWCLOSE, SIZEBRIGHT
       and  SIZEBBOTTOM  are actually set  when GadgetEd is running.  All the
       other flags are only generated in the source code.


 Edit IDCMP:       <right Amiga I>

 Function: This  opens a window  in which you  can set the IDCMP flags of the
           window. The following gadgets are displayed in the window:

  SIZEVERIFY       - signal if the user is trying to re-size the window.
  NEWSIZE          - signal if the user has resized the window.
  REFRESHWINDOW    - signal if the window must be refreshed.
  ACTIVEWINDOW     - signal if the window is activated.
  INACTIVEWINDOW   - signal if the window is deactivated.
  GADGETDOWN       - signal if a gadget is pressed.
  GADGETUP         - signal if a gadget is released.
  CLOSEWINDOW      - signal if the closewindow gadget is selected.
  REQSET           - signal if a requester opened on the window.
  REQCLEAR         - signal if the last requester is closed.
  REQVERIFY        - signal if a requester try's to open in the window.
  MENUPICK         - signal if a menu was picked.
  MENUVERIFY       - signal if the user try's to pick a menu.
  MOUSEBUTTONS     - signal if a mouse button is pressed or released.
  MOUSEMOVE        - signal if the mouse was moved.
                     NOTE: The REPORTMOUSE flag should be  set in the  window
                           or the FOLLOWMOUSE in a gadget.
  DELTAMOVE        - signal if the mouse had moved. The  position is relative
                     to the previous position.
  INTUITICKS       - signal every  1/50 or  1/60  second. The message must be
                     replied before another INTUITICKS message is signalled.
  NEWPREFS         - signal if the preferences were changed.
  DISKINSERTED     - signal if a disk was inserted into one of the drives.
  DISKREMOVED      - signal if a disk was removed from one of the drives.
  RAWKEY           - signal if a key  was pressed. the  code is the 'RAW' key
                     code.
  VANILLAKEY       - signal if a  key was pressed.  the code is the 'treated'
                     ASCII value of the key.
  WBENCHMESSAGE    - signal a workbench message
  LONELYMESSAGE    - signal a non IDCMP message

  NOTE: None of  the above flags  are actually  set in  GadgetED but they are
        generated in the source code.

  Title       - Type the Window Title in here.
  Label       - Type the source label name in here.

  Detail      - The window DetailPen.
  Block       - The window BlockPen

  MinX        - The minimum width of the window.
  MinY        - The minimum height of the window.

  MaxX        - The maximum width of the window.
  MaxY        - The maximum height of the window.

  Selecting CANCEL will prevent the changes to be set. OK sets the changes in
  the flags e.c.t. and will resume editing.

 Set BackFill:     <right Amiga B>

 Function: This  enables you to set  the backfill color of the window. I have
           made this  function available  since I  use windows  with  another
           backfill color than  color 0 a lot.  Maybe you do to (?).  You can
           use a routine simular to the following to use this window backfill
           color in your program:

 void WindowBackFill(struct Window *window)
 {
    SetAPen(window->RPort,WDBACKFILL);
    RectFill(window->RPort,window->LeftEdge+window->BorderLeft,
                           window->TopEdge+window->BorderTop,
                           window->Width-window->BorderLeft,
                           window->Height-3);
    RefreshGList(window->FirstGadget,window,NULL,-1L);
 }
           The color used is set by the BPen menu (see THE FPEN & BPEN MENUS)

 When you are editing gadgets for a requester:

 Set BackFill:     <right Amiga B>

 Function: This enables you to set the backfill color of the requester.
           The color used is set by the BPen menu (see THE FPEN & BPEN MENUS)


 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       VI. THE FPEN AND BPEN MENUS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When one of these two  menus are selected  you will see a row of 2,4,8,16 or
 32 (depending on the screen depth) colored items.  These items represent the
 colors of the edit screen. With the items in the  FPen menu you  can set the
 active FrontPen color. All gadgets added  will have a  border in this  color
 and all texts  added will  have this  color as  the FrontPen color. With the
 items in the BPen menu you can set the active BackPen color. All texts added
 will have this color as the BackPen color.  The active BackPen color is also
 used to set the BackFill color of  the requester.  The colors  selected  are
 also used to set the OS 2 Border colors. (see "OS-2 Border colors")

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     VII. THE GENERATED SOURCE CODE
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following definitions are made at the end of the generated source:

 NEWWINDOW or REQUESTER - a pointer to the NewWindow or Requester structure.

 If you have edited some gadgets:

 FIRSTGADGET            - a pointer to the first gadget in the list.

 If there where texts added to the window or requester:

 FIRSTTEXT              - a pointer to the first text in the list.

 If there where 'BORDERONLY' gadgets defined:

 FIRSTBORDER            - a pointer to the first border in the list.

 If you have edited gadgets for on a custom screen:

 NEWSCREEN              - a pointer to the NewScreen structure.
 COLORCOUNT             - the number of colors in the screen.

 If you have edited gadgets for a window:

 WDBACKFILL             - the window backfill color used while editing.

 An array named  'Colors' of  USHORT values containing the colors which where
 on the edit screen. These colors can be set by a simple LoadRGB4() call.

 If you  have edited gadgets for a  window and you have attached texts and/or
 'BORDERONLY' gadgets to the window  a special gadget is placed at the end of
 the gadgetlist. This gadget is only there  to draw the borders and the texts
 when the window is opened or when the gadgets are refreshed.

 The GadgetID's are defined as following: Label_ID
 This means that if you, for example, added a gadget with the label "UP" than
 "UP_ID" will represents this gadget it's ID.

 The best way to see what the source looks like is to create some gadgets and
 let GadgetED generate the source and then look at it. Basically all you need
 to remember are the labels you give your gadgets to be able to access all of
 the structures etc. that are linked to these gadgets. I don't really know if
 the generated C source compiles under lattice , I don't have lattice, but it
 should give no problems whatsoever.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            VIII. COMPILING
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If you have the make utility type:

  make pre ged

 Otherwise compile the "defs.h" file with  the "-ho defs.pre"  option and all
 other files with the "-so -hi defs.pre" options and then link them together.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               IX. HISTORY
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 VERSION    1.0     -> Let's not talk about this!

 VERSION    2.0     -> First release, let's see how it goes.

 VERSION    2.2a    -> The  generated window  source  now reads  NULL at  the
                       place of the window title if the title was empty.

                       The gadgets  on the  window  won't  interfere with the
                       placing  of  texts  and   gadgets  in  the  window  or
                       requester  anymore.

                       Binary file  structure  expanded.  Version 2.0  binary
                       files must first be patched  before GadgetED  2.2a and
                       up can read  them.

                       Added "Static Structures"  switch  in  the preferences
                       window to enable to  generate  static C  source  code.

                       Added  the  NOBORDER  switch to disable the generating
                       of gadget border source.

                       Added  the  "Text Copy"  switch to  enable to copy any
                       text attached to a gadget also.

                       Resolved a bug in "tsel.c" which gurud if more than 10
                       texts  where in  the "text selector"  and the prop was
                       used.  It worked  fine  when I  first  programmed this
                       function with the Aztec C version 3.6a compiler ?

                       Added the possibility to set  your own window backfill
                       color.

                       Added  the "RAW Assembler Source" switch to be able to
                       assemble the generated assembler source without having
                       to include the intuition headers.

                       Added  OS-2.0  colored borders.  This was suggested by
                       Jan Geißler. Thanks Jan!

                       Workbench  usage only  worked  when  both the  GE file
                       and  the   GadgetED  executable   where  in  the  same
                       directory, this is now fixed.

                       GadgetED locked  up the  system if the  "tool.library"
                       wasn't found. This is now fixed. (I forgot a simple if
                       statement!)

 VERSION 2.3        -> Fixed  a bug  that  caused  generating faulty C source
                       with gadgets that have multiple texts.

                       Fixed a bug in the  palette requester which  gurud  on
                       LoRes screens.

                       Fixed the source generator to generate correct  source
                       of GIMMEZEROZERO windows and GZZGADGETS (I hope...)

                       Added  the  posibility  to  set  the  colors of OS 2.0
                       colored borders.

                       GadgetED now defaults to Workbench screen editing if a
                       file could not be loaded uppon startup.

                       Source  generator  now generates  "V_HIRES" instead of
                       "HIRES" when assembler source for hires custom screens
                       is generated.
