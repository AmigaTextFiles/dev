    This  is a typing aid for programming with MUI. It is set up to work
    with  CED  and  TTX,  but  can be easily configured to work with any
    editor with arexx capabilities.

    From  the main window you can build complex MUI variables by using a
    series  of  Listviews.  When complete, click OK or SEND and the word
    will be returned to your editor and inserted at the cursor position.
    There  are  various  other  methods  for returning a word, see later
    text.

    In  order  to make the program pop-up on your current editors screen
    it needs to have a public screen and the Screen Prefs need to to set
    to «Frontmost» using the MUI Preferences program.

    (CED  needs  to  be  set  to  use  a  public  screen by changing the
    "Environment/Rendering Choices" settings)

@{b}                                 @{u}CED usage@{ub}@{uu}

    Assign a key to the arexx program: getstring-ced.rexx.
    MetaMac  can  be  used to do this quickly, or use (Left Amiga)-M and
    choose  a  key  to  bind the Arexx Macro to. When editing, press the
    macro-key  and  up will pop the MUI-Lists window. Build the word you
    want by choosing the various parts from the listviews. The word that
    will be used is shown underneath the listviews.

    IMPORTANT:
    The  arexx script  "getstring-XXX.rexx"  needs  customising to  your
    environment by changing the muifile statement.

@Node MUI-Lists-Window " MUI-Lists The GUI Interface "

@{b}                                  @{u}The GUI@{ub}@{uu}

    The user interface is made up of:

    - Heading
       This is just to let everyone know who wrote the program :)

    - Four Listviews
       From  these you can build up the text that you'd rather not type.
    As  all  MUI  text  is made up of upto four parts, only the relevant
    listviews  will  be  available  for  choosing  from.  Each  part  is
    activated by a single click and opens as many listviews as needed.

    - Text Line

       This  shows  the  text  being  built  up.

    - Buttons OK, Send, Quit & Cancel

      OK     - Clicking OK will cause the built up word to be  sent back
               to  arexx,  and then  from  there it  can be  sent to the
               editor via the getstring-XXX.rexx program.

      SEND   - This is similar to OK but leaves the  window open  on the
               screen so  that more  words can be sent without having to
               re-open the window.

      Quit   - Quit  is  the  same  as  Cancel, but it  also removes the
               MUILISTS port from memory.

      Cancel - Cancel returns nothing, but leaves the port in memory.

    The  word  can  also  be  returned  by  double-clicking  within  the
    list-views.   This   is   the  same  as  using  the  'Send'  button.
    Double-clicking returns the word currently in the text gadget.

    A cycle chain also exists, so that options can be chosen by <tab>ing
    between the listviews and button gadgets, and using the cursor keys
    to choose the elements of the returned string.

    When  the  string  is  returned  via one of the various methods, the
    arexx  script  parses  the  returned string and forwards it onto the
    specified  editor through the arexx port. The script then decides if
    you wanted to keep the window open or not.

@{b}                                @{u}Arexx Commands@{ub}@{uu}

    Apart  from  the usual commands available to all MUI Apps, MUI-Lists
    knows one more command:
                                    "getstring"

    This  opens  the  MUI-Lists window and returns the string chosen via
    Arexx.

@Node MUI-Lists-Shell " MUI-Lists CLI/Shell Usage "

@{b}                      @{u}Running from the CLI or WorkBench@{ub}@{uu}

    As  MUI-Lists  is  useless  without  an  Arexx port, running it from
    either  of  these  options will simply open a port called "MUILISTS"
    which  will  wait for input from arexx. You can start it from either
    WBStartup,  or  enter a line in your user-startup however neither of
    these is really neccessary as the arexx script will run the file and
    wait for the port to appear anyway.

    To  quit  the  program,  and  release it from memory, either run the
    arexx program quit.rexx or type the following in a shell:
                        rx "address 'LISTS'; 'quit'"

    I can be contacted at anytime by e-mail as:
                        mfishera@cix.compulink.co.uk

    This  is  my first MUI project, and as I really find it easy to use,
    I'll try and write many more (work, Debbie & CIX permitting :)
    This  program  is  released  as  FreeWare, you don't have to send me
    anything to use it, but abuse & suggestions are welcome :)

    Thanks to the following people for suggestions and help,

    1. Me :)                            2. Richard "Debugger" Waspe

    5. Ian Moran                        6. Eric Totel

    Thanks  also  to  Mike  for the TTX script, Richard for the Enforcer
    hits  and  help in curing them, and Eric for various suggestions and
    MUIBuilder.
