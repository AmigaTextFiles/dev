 ~~~~~~~
	* GU_AddTail now returns the pointer to the node, instead of just
	  a TRUE/FALSE value. If there was not enough memory for the node,
	  NULL will be returned. Also, a little bug in GU_AddTail was fixed
	  at this time. The allocated buffer for the string was one byte
	  smaller that it should be.

	* GU_FindNode - New routine that located the node structure for a
	  given node number. This function can be used to read the node's
	  string (LN_NAME) from a list item that was selected by the user.
	  The routine can be used on any list, but if it is used on a list
	  that you do not own (a system list, for example), you must use
	  Forbid() and Permit() while you search and access the node's
	  data.

	* GU_NodeUp - New routine that moves a node one step closer to the
	  beginning of a list. All nodes, except the first node on the
	  list can be moved upwards, and if you try to move first node in
	  the list upwards, nothing will happen.

	* GU_NodeDown - New routine that moves a node one step closer to
	  the end of the list. All nodes, except the one at the end of the
	  list can be moved downwards, and if you try to move the last
	  node in the list downwards, nothing will happen. This routine 
	  actually moves the node below the selected one one step upwards.

	* GU_GetBevelBox - New routine that locates the bevel box's
	  internal structure. The structure can be found in the include
	  file, and should be considered read-only. The structure can be 
	  used to get the box's position and size (useful when you need to
	  center a text for example).

	* Removed the GU_GetBevelBox function and changed the library so
	  that the bevel box's address is saved at the same place as the
	  normal gadget's gadget structures. It is now possible to obtain
	  the bevel box data structure by using the same method as for any
	  other gadget (directly from the LayoutGadget array, or by using
	  GU_GetGadgetPtr), but the bevelbox structure is not linked with
	  any other gadget.
