  Distribution:

     1) Distribution of this library is allowed in two ways:
          ¹) Only the .library file(s)
          ²) The complete distribution (user or developer archive)

     2) Programmers of totally free software can use and distribute this
        library for free.

     3) Programmers of Shareware, Licensware, commercial products and other
        programs that the programmer get any kind of profit from shall send
        a fully working (and registered) copy of the program and its docs to
        us. All larger updates of the program should also be sent to us.
          
     4) Programmers of non-free software not covered by 1) and 2) (my Diskware
        concept belongs to this group) shall be treated as in 3) (a fully
        working and registered copy...).

     5) All programs (except commercial products in some cases) must state
        that gadutil.library is used. This may be done in either the About
        requester or in the documentation, but best of all in both places.

        Demonstration programs for gadutil.library (that includes the full
        source) may be distributed without this note.

        Example for inclusion in About requester:

             "This program uses gadutil.library, which
              is Copyright © 1994-1997 by P-O Yliniemi
              and Staffan Hämälä."

     6) All localized programs that uses this library should include the
        .ct file(s) to allow anyone to translate that program into their
        own language.
