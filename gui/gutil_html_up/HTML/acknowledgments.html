<PRE>

Special thanx must go to:

  Amiga Inc. / Commodore / Escom / Amiga Technologies / Viscorp
   - For making everything possible

  Rune Gram-Madsen
   - For the best integrated assembly language development package

  Price (TFA)
   - For the continued development of Asm-One (since 1991). The complete
     distribution of Asm-One 1.29 is available from both mine and Staffan's
     home page, see <A HREF="authors.html">Authors</A> for addresses.

  Timothy J. Aston
   - For the inspiration, GadLayout 1.5 (a link library for 'C' programmers)

  Bengt Giger, Jochen Wiedmann, Pete Goodeve
   - AskEnv, FD2Pragma &amp; FlexCat, XIcon

  Nico Max
   - For "forcing" us to release gadutil a bit sooner than it was meant to.

  Lukasz Szelag
   - For the first, and the three following bug reports
   - For ideas about some new constants for the include files

  Morten Amundsen
   - For the suggestion of two new tags (so far)

  Michael Ranner
   - AmigaGuide2HTML (although I had to do some manual editing afterwards)

  James McOrmond
   - For some suggestions and reporting that the examples didn't compile
     using the OS 2.x system includes :)

  Terje Pedersen
   - For the E include files.

  Mika Lundell
   - For the suggestion about making GU_NoCreate work for individual gadgets,
     and for the idea to the new tags that can save all calculated values in
     external variables.
