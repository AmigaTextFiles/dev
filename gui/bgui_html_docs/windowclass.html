NAME

   Class:      windowclass
   Superclass: ROOTCLASS
   Include File: <libraries/bgui.h>

FUNCTION

   To provide an easy to use BGUI interface to intuition windows. The
   window class provides just about everything you need to create windows
   with a fully font-sensitive and size-adjustable GUI.

   Objects of this class send out the following attributes:

   WINDOW_IsOpen - TRUE is window open, FALSE is closed.

NAME

  WM_CLOSE -- Close the window.

SYNOPSIS

  succ = DoMethod( obj, WM_CLOSE )

  ULONG succ;

FUNCTION

  This method will close the window. It is safe to call this method even
  when the window is not open.

INPUTS

RESULT

  succ - TRUE upon success and FALSE upon failure.

NAME

  WM_GADGETKEY -- Add a gadget hotkey.

SYNOPSIS

  succ = DoMethod( obj, WM_GADGETKEY, req, target, key )

  ULONG succ;
  struct Requester *req;
  Object *target;
  STRPTR key;

FUNCTION

  With this method you can assign a key to trigger a gadget object in
  the window. The object which is connected to the key will then be
  controllable by the specified key.

INPUTS

  req - This version of the library does not support BGUI gadget
    objects in requesters so this field must be set to NULL.

  target - This must be a pointer to the object which the key will
    control.

  key - This must point to a string in which a single character
    is located. The character is the key which controls the object
    when it is pressed.

RESULT

  succ - TRUE upon success and FALSE upon failure.

NAME

  WM_HANDLEIDCMP -- Handle window events.

SYNOPSIS

  id = DoMethod( obj, WM_HANDLEIDCMP )

  ULONG id;

FUNCTION

  This method must be used to call the windowclass event handler. The
  event handler will act upon the messages present at the window's
  message port and return you ID's on which to act.

INPUTS

RESULT

  id  - This can be any of the following:

    WMHI_CLOSEWINDOW -- The window's close gadget was selected.
    WMHI_NOMORE -- No more messages waiting.
    WMHI_INACTIVE -- The window was de-activated.
    WMHI_ACTIVE -- The window was activated.
    WMHI_IGNORE -- Ignore this result.

    Any return code which differs from the ones above is the ID
    of a selected object (gadget or menu).

    Please look at the demo programs for more information.

NAME

  WM_OPEN -- Open the window.

SYNOPSIS

  win = DoMethod( obj, WM_OPEN )

  struct Window *win;

FUNCTION

  This method will open up the window. If successful a pointer to the
  window structure is returned. It is safe to call this method when the
  window is already open.

INPUTS

RESULT

NAME

  WM_SLEEP -- Put the window to sleep.

SYNOPSIS

  succ = DoMethod( obj, WM_SLEEP )

  ULONG succ;

FUNCTION

  With this method you can put your window to sleep when it is open.
  This is done by setting up a small invisible requester which will
  block the window input possibilities. Also a standard Workbench busy
  pointer is set in the window.

  This call is nested. This means the window has to be released with
  WM_WAKEUP as much times as you have locked it with WM_SLEEP.

INPUTS

RESULT

  succ  - TRUE upon success and FALSE upon failure.

SYNOPSIS

  succ = DoMethod( obj, WM_WAKEUP )

  ULONG succ;

FUNCTION

  This method must be used to wake up the window again after being
  put to sleep with the WM_SLEEP method. Please note that you must wake
  up the window as many times as you have put it to sleep before you can
  actually use it again.

INPUTS

RESULT

  succ  - TRUE upon success and FALSE upon failure.
