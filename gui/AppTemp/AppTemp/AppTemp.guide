@node "whatis" "What is AppTemp?"
>>>>>>>>>> What is AppTemp?

   AppTemp is an application template generator.  Fill in the fields in
   the main window.  Then fill in the fields for the window from the
   Objects/Windows window.  Now use the menus to Make Source or Save the
   project.

   ***** NOTE: This program generates source code in the "OLD" MUI
               format.  See "psi.c" source included in MUI 3 for more
               information on the preferred object-oriented programming
               methodology.  AppTemp will be dramatically updated in
               the future.  Project file compatability is not a
               guarantee.  However, this program may still be useful
               for some people.
@endnode

@node "useful" "How's this useful?"
>>>>>>>>>> How's this useful?

   It makes easy and quick setup of the base of an application.
   The AppTemp.Dat file is editable so you can customize the source code
   to your particular needs.

@node "install" "How do I install this utility?"
>>>>>>>>>> How do I install this utility?

   To install, just drop the program drawer onto any disk.
@endnode

@node "thegui" "How do I use the GUI?"
>>>>>>>>>> How do I use the GUI?

   There are four sections to the GUI split into two windows.

   The Main Window
      Asks for basic application information, library requirements and
   a list of menuitems to include in your program.

      When entering the application information, some of the field names
   are highlighted in @{b}BOLD@{ub} characters.  Hit RETURN after entering
   data in these fields.  Other fields will setup their default values as
   these @{b}BOLD@{ub} fields are entered.  The cursor will advance from
   one field to the next automatically.

      The library requirements section is straightforward.  Just click the
   checkbox for any library your application will require, then fill in the
   minimum version level in the integer gadget to the right.  Some libraries
   do not have checkboxes since they are always opened.

      By default, every menu item is included in the source code.  Selected
   items are highlighted in @{b}BOLD@{ub}.  To select or de-select an item,
   multi-select any items you wish to change then click the Toggle Status
   button.

   The Windows Window
      Asks for basic information on each window in your program.  Type the
   information requested for each window then hit OK when done.


   When you're done, you may save the project information using the
   Project/Save menuitem or generate source code using the Make Source
   menu item.  Making source code reads a template from the AppTemp.Dat
   file.  This file can be customized to output source in just about any
   format you wish, in any language you wish.  The keywords used in the
   template file are explained in the @{" customize " link "customize"} section.
@endnode

@node "functions" "What functions are included in the standard template?"
>>>>>>>>>> What functions are included in the standard template?

   Several functions are included in a file called "JMH.J".  These are
commonly-used utility functions that you may find useful.  If not, or
if you want to add your own, see the @{" customize " link "customize"} section.

void    JMH_About        ( void );
   Pops up an "About" window using the application variables you set.

LONG    JMH_Error        ( char *, APTR, BOOL, char *, char *, LONG );
   Pops up a MUI_Request with an error message and provides context-specific
   help for the user.

BOOL    JMH_FileReq      ( APTR, UBYTE *, BOOL, BOOL, UBYTE *, UWORD );
   Standard file requester.

void    JMH_InitVars     ( void );
   Initializes several variables used throughout the standard template.

ULONG   JMH_LaunchProgram( BOOL, UBYTE *, BOOL );
   Asynchronously launches a program.  Useful to pop up standard system prefs
   tools like Printer Prefs or maybe the system calculator in a financial
   application, etc.

void    JMH_Quit         ( char * );
   Displays an optional message using JMH_Error() then de-allocates any
   resources and ends the program.

void    JMH_Startup      ( int, char *[] );
   Used to setup the application, open libraries, initialize variables,
   read arguments from CLI/Shell, etc.

void    JMH_WindowTitle  ( APTR );
   Set the window title to "ApplicationName: ProjectName" for the specified
   window.  For example, "Lightwave: work:video/rush_is_right/anim001.iff".

APTR    JMH_ShowWaitBox  ( APTR, UBYTE *, UBYTE * );
   Pops up a message box with floating text object.  Use JMH_HideWaitBox()
   to make this window disappear.

BOOL    JMH_HideWaitBox  ( APTR, APTR );
   Closes the wait box opened with JMH_ShowWaitBox().

USHORT  JMH_Strip        ( UBYTE *, UBYTE * );
   Strips all characters specified in second parameter from the string
   specified in the first paramter.
   For example,
      JMH_Strip( "JOHN X HAUBRICH", "XH" ) = "JON  AUBRIC"

USHORT  JMH_CStrip       ( UBYTE *, UBYTE * );
   Strips all characters *NOT* specified in second parameter from the
   string specified in the first paramter.
   For example,
      JMH_CStrip( "JOHN X HAUBRICH", "HJNX " ) = "JHN X HH"

UBYTE  *JMH_PadStr       ( UBYTE *, UBYTE, BYTE, USHORT );
   Pads a string from left or right with given character.
      UCHAR *szPad   - String to be padded
      UCHAR  chPad   - character to pad string with
      BYTE   bPadDir - Specifies where to pad string
                       Valid values are:
                          -1: left side
                          +1: right side
      USHORT usSize  - maximum size of the padded string

double  JMH_Round        ( double, BYTE );
   Round a double to a given number of decimals.
      double dblValue  - Value to be rounded
      BYTE   bDecimals - Number of decimal places to round

BOOL    JMH_IsNumberValid( UBYTE *, BYTE );
   JMH_IsNumberValid(): does string contain only numeric chars?
      UBYTE *pszNum    - Numeric string to be verified
      BYTE   bType:  1 = Positive-Only Integer
                     2 = Positive-Only Float
                    -1 = Positive or Negative Integer
                    -2 = Positive or Negative Float
                     0 = Positive or Negative Float (default)

@node "customize" "How do I customize the output?"
>>>>>>>>>> How do I customize the output?

   Edit the AppTemp.Dat file in a text editor.  The fields contained in
   '+' and ';' are replaced by the variables you enter via the GUI.

** FILE CONTROL
**    A few keywords to denote file names.  The default outputs files with
**    a ".j" extension.  This way, accidentally running APPTEMP will not
**    overwrite ".C" files that already exist.
   Keyword     Description
   ----------  -----------------------------------------------------------
   {FILE:name} Opens a file called "name" for output.
   {ENDFILE}   Closes the current output file.

** APPLICATION
**    Generic keywords about the application.
   Keyword     Description
   ----------  -----------------------------------------------------------
   {APPOWNER}  The owner of the program (for use in copyright in sourcecode)
   {COMPILER}  The compiler we're using
   {VERSNUM}   Version number only (string, i.e. "1.0")
   {YEAR}      The year!
   {REXX}      TRUE if ARexx interface is included, else FALSE

   {APPNAME}   Application name  **REQUIRED**
   {APPBASE}   Application Base name
   {APPTITLE}  Application Title

                  def "$VER: {APPNAME} {VERSNUM} (DAY.MONTH.YEAR)"
   {APPCOPYR}  Application copyright, def "(C) {YEAR}  {APPAUTH}"
   {APPAUTH}   Application author
   {APPDESC}   Application description
   {HELPFILE}  Help file for this application, def "PROGDIR:{APPNAME}"

** WINDOWS
**    These keywords are replaced by data for each window in turn.  See
**    the FOREACH:WINDOW and ENDEACH keywords for more information on
**    generating source for multiple windows.
**
**    NOTE: If these keywords are found OUTSIDE of a FOREACH:WINDOW
**          loop, the first window (which will be the MAIN window)
**          is used in the expression.
   Keyword     Description
   ----------  -----------------------------------------------------------
   {WSN}       Window struct Name   \ i.e. struct MainWindow MAIN;
   {WSI}       Window struct ID     /                WSN     WSI

   {WID}       32-bit window ID (MAKE_ID)
   {WTITLE}    Window Title, default to {WSN}
   {MENUPTR}   Identifier of menu for this window, defaults to Menu_{WSI}Menu,
   {APPWDW}    AppWindow (T | F), defaults to T

                  else ID_BUT_{WSI}_CANCEL

** LIBRARIES
**    For example, {ASL_INCL} and {ASL_VERSION} = 38 will open
**    asl.library version 38 or higher.  See the IF: keyword in the
**    conditionals section below for more information.
   Name              Version              Include?          DefVersion
   ----------------- -------------------- ----------------- --------------

   UtilityBase       {UTILITY_VERSION}       N/A               37
   WorkbenchBase     {WORKBENCH_VERSION}  {WORKBENCH_INCL}     37

** LOOP CONTROL
**    The following keywords handle multiple-pass output.  For example,
**    to output source for each of our windows, we start the repeating
**    sections with FOREACH.  The section is ended with the ENDEACH
**    keyword.  When ENDEACH is encountered, the output routine moves
**    backwards in the template to the corresponding FOREACH.
**
**    CAUTION: FOREACH and ENDEACH may *NOT* be nested!!!
   Keyword         Description
   --------------  -------------------------------------------------------
   FOREACH:WINDOW  Starting point for each window.  Subsequent statements
                   will be iterated for each window in your window list.
   ENDEACH         Ends the FOREACH loop.

** CONDITIONALS
**    Use these keywords to include sections of code that meet certain
**    conditions.
   IF:REXX         Only include following lines if REXX checkbox was
                   selected.
   ENDIF           Ending indicator for all IF statements.
   MENUIF:##       Includes subsequent lines if menu item number ## was
                   selected for inclusion.
   MENULINE:##     Includes subsequent line if menu item number ## was
                   selected for inclusion.  This statement sends only
                   the data on the remainder of this line to the output
                   file.
   IF:library-incl Use in conjunction with library _INCL keywords to
                   include subsequent statements only if library-incl
                   checkbox was checked.  For example, if you clicked
                   the AslBase checkbox, the IF:ASL_INCL statement
                   would evaluate to TRUE and would include all further
                   statements in the output file until an ENDIF is
                   encountered.

** MISC
**    Miscellaneous.
   GADGETID:###    From a base of 10000, add 1000 per window then add
                   the three digit value specified here.  This is used
                   in the menu section for numbering of MENU return IDs.
                   The first window's menus start at 10000, the second
                   window's menus start at 11000, the third at 12000,
                   etc.
