	New for AskEnv V2.5
	-------------------

Changed
-------

- Output of all variables into a global file has been ommited. The keyword
  VAR in the header must now refer to a variable in ENV:
  Therefore the option NOVARS is useless.
  The variable VAR contains in immediate and select mode the number of the
  button pressed. If no variable in VAR has been specified, 
  "ENV:AskEnv_Button" will be used in both cases.


Bugfixes
--------

- HI- and LOBOX corrected

- linked to use a minimum stack size of 6000


New Features
------------

- File requesters also centered on visual area of screen, remember their size

- Command line option SBMODE added for programs which don't like their window
  structure to be observed

- Gadgets on/off switching speed up drastically

- SCREEN option: requesters appear on a public screen

- File requester also as dir only requester (option DIR in FREQ command line
  and BUTTON keyword)

- Setting of errorlimits for synchron launched programs with WARN, like 
  FAILAT (i.e. for help features and sub requesters)

- Gadget values are written before a external program will be started, so it
  can use the actual contents of the gadgets

- SYNCRUN and ASYNCRUN commands may contain variables, so contents of string
  gadgets can be used immediately
