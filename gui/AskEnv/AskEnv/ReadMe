	AskEnv - Requesters for Everbody!
	---------------------------------


With AskEnv, you can build requesters, call them out of almost every
program, and read the results out of environment variables. Needs at
least OS 2.04.

The test script demonstrates most of the possibilities of predefined
and free configurable requesters. The directories HIRES and LACE
contain the same requester files designed for two different font sizes.


Arexx must be installed for the following examples:

Plotter is a preferences program for the PLT device. PLT: prints HPGL
data using the prefs printer drivers in best quality. The variable
"pltinfo" selects between preview and print action. To be found on
Fish 572 with the MultiPlot package.

a input requester appears (Dearc.req).

PrefMan.rexx is a example how to start programs.
