These Postscript files are covers for MUI autodocs, version 3.1.
They have been created with Professional Page. I made them
because I think the cover page supplied with the DVI file
is rather ugly.

I have included IFF previews of the files, so you don't
have to print them in order to see if you like them or not.
The conversion PS->IFF is not very good so just use these pics
to evaluate the content of the files. The final result is much
nicer :)

By the way the SASG logo has been ripped from the SASG registration
program (with Quickgrab) so it is not really good. I would be
interested in a nice SASG logo, or even better a great MUI logo in
order to increase these files quality.

I know that MUI is a copyrighted product. My only purpose is to
offer a nice looking cover page for the autodocs. But if SASG or
Stefan Stuntz don't want me to diffuse these files I will agree.
By the way I don't allow France Festival Distribution to diffuse these
Postscript files.
