   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   GadToolsBox V1.4
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   20-Apr-1992  CH      Now GadToolsBox is compiled with the "-ms" switch
                        of dice to put the static strings into  the  code
                        hunk. This will give me some data space so that I
                        don't have to compile large data yet. (37.112)

   20-Apr-1992  SA-NF   The C source generator now generates source which
                        results in  a  smaller  executable.   All  gadget
                        creations are  now  done  in  a  loop.  Added the
                        "Aztec C" preferences switch.  This switch _must_
                        be on if you work with the  aztec  compiler.  The
                        generated gadget tags use a special kind of  type
                        casting which seems to be the only way to get the
                        aztec compiler to create the correct data for the
                        tags without generating a  bunch  of  errors  and
                        warnings. Suggested by Garry Glendown. (37.113)

   23-Apr-1992  MAJ     As it seems the assembler source generator wasn't
                        upto  date  at  all  in  release  1.3.    It even
                        generated bad code sometimes......(Sorry boys and
                        girl's...). Now the Assembler source generator is
                        totally updated to  generate  the  same  kind  of
                        source as the C generator. (37.114)

   24-Apr-1992  NF-SA   Added he  possibility  to  block  to  X  and/or Y
                        movements   when  creating,  sizing,  moving  and
                        copying a gadget.  Suggested  by  Yves Perrenoud.
                        (37.115)

   27-Apr-1992  NF      Added the  ExitHelp  and  TabCycle  tags  to  the
                        string and  integer  gadgets.   I  seem  to  have
                        overlooked these two tags. (37.116)

   02-May-1992  NF      Now the window texts are also generated  with the
                        font adaptable source. (37.117)

   03-May-1992  MIN     GadToolsBox didn't generate correct gadget, bevel
                        box   and  text  offset's  when  the  window  was
                        BORDERLESS and/or BACKDROP.   Bug found by Jochen
                        Kreimer.

   10-May-1992  NF-SA   GadToolsBox now  support grouping  of gadgets  to
                        perform moves, copies, deletes and edits on  more
                        gadgets at the same time. I have implemented this
                        the   same   way  as  with  the  align  routines.
                        Suggested  by  just   about  everyone  that  uses
                        GadToolsBox seriously. (37.119)

   11-May-1992  NF      Extended the multi selection a bit.  When you are
                        prompted to click on the  gadgets to  move, copy,
                        delete or edit you can press 'A' to  select   all
                        gadgets and 'SHIFT+A' to  de-select all  gadgets.
                        (37.120)

   13-May-1992  MIN     Fixed a few minor things.  Cleaned up some  shit.
                        (37.121)

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   GadToolsBox V1.3 (37.111)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   06-Jan-1992  NF      GadToolsBox now supports screens larger than  the
                        visible size on the monitor.  You can auto-scroll
                        through these  screens.  All  program  requesters
                        will appear in the center of the visible  part of
                        the screen. (37.44)

   10-Jan-1992  MIN     The  BevelBoxes did  not  re-position  when   the
                        WFLG_GIMMEZEROZERO flag was turned  on/off.  This
                        has been fixed. (37.45)

   10-Jan-1992  MIN     The print routine had a little trouble when  only
                        one window was in memory.    This has been fixed.
                        (37.46)

   18-Jan-1992  NF-SA   Added gadget alignment  routines which enable the
                        user   to   easely   get   the   gadgets the same
                        size and position.     NOTE: Keyboard   shortcuts
                        are not defined for the menus....I simply ran out
                        of shortcut characters. Suggested by Nico Fraçois
                        (37.47)

   18-Jan-1992  SA      The IDCMP_MENUPICK flag is now automatically  set
                        when a menu is added  to a  window.  Suggested by
                        Sebastiano Vigna. (37.48)

   18-Jan-1992  SA      The C source generator now generates NULL instead
                        of 0l. The 0l seems to  upset lint.  Suggested by
                        Sebastiano Vigna. (37.49)

   18-Jan-1992  SA      Added a "Default Zoom" gadget to let  GadToolsBox
                        calculate the  Zoom  width  and  Zoom  height  as
                        follows: ZoomWidth is the length  of  the  window
                        window title + 80. ZoomHeight is the size  of the
                        window title bar.  Suggested by Sebastiano Vigna.
                        (37.50)

   18-Jan-1992  SA      Now GadToolsBox generates the gadget IDCMP  flags
                        according to the  definitions  in gadtools.h(.i).
                        This will ensure future compatibility.  Suggested
                        by Sebastiano Vigna. (37.51)

   19-Jan-1992  CH      The C source generator  now  generates  calls  to
                        "OpenXXXTags()"   instead  of  "OpenXXXTagList()"
                        to open the screen and window.  This because some
                        compilers under which my Aztec 5.0a compiler have
                        trouble with converting pointers  to  integers in
                        TagItem structures. Now the source  will  compile
                        with both DICE and Aztec.  Please  report trouble
                        with other compilers to me. (37.52)

   21-Jan-1992  SA      The getfile gadget  now  uses  a  "Boopsi"  image
                        which causes the image to be  drawn in  the  same
                        colors  as  all  other  GadTools  gadgets.   Also
                        the Source + object code of the Boopsi routine is
                        included.  All  programs  that  use  the  getfile
                        gadget generated  with  gadtoolsbox  _MUST_  link
                        with this object code. Suggested by Nico François
                        (37.53)

   25-Jan-1992  NF      The C source generator now generates  four  words
                        describing the window left, top, width and height
                        This will allow your application to remeber size/
                        position changes the user makes with the  window.
                        (37.54)

   25-Jan-1992  NF-SA   The filerequester now automatically uses the file
                        name to build the output  source name.  This  way
                        you are not presented with  unnamed.c  each  time
                        you  generate   the  source.   Originaly  it  was
                        suggested  that  the  binary should  contain  the
                        source name but I think this  is  a  better  way.
                        Suggested by Andreas Jung. (37.55)

   25-Jan-1992  NF      Added a "Close WBench" switch in the  preferences
                        window to  let  the  program  try  to  close  the
                        workbench  screen  uppon  startup.   Suggested by
                        the "User Interface Style Guide". (37.56)

   25-Jan-1992  NF      Added a  "Progress Indicator Requester"  for  the
                        Crunch progress. Suggested by the "User Interface
                        Style Guide" (37.57)

   25-Jan-1992  CH      Enhanced some things  like  some  requesters  and
                        menus accoording to the  guidelines  expressed in
                        the "User Interface Style Guide". (37.58)

   01-Feb-1992  NF-SA   The C source generator is  now  able to  generate
                        source which will automatically  adapt  itself to
                        any font.    Note however  that  when  using this
                        feature window texts are _NOT_  generated  in the
                        source. Maybee in a next release.... Please refer
                        to the "Adapt Font"  chapter in the docs for more
                        info. Suggested by Sebastiano Vigna. (37.59)

   02-Feb-1992  MIN     Fixed some minor bugs in  the C source generator.
                        (37.60)

   02-Feb-1992  NF-SA   Changed the working of the default  zoom  gadget.
                        Now when this gadget is selected the  alternative
                        zoom   positions  are   calculated  at run  time.
                        Suggested by Sebastiano Vigna. (37.61)

   03-Feb-1992  CH      When the "Font Adapt"  option  is on  GadToolsBox
                        forces the user to design the user interface with
                        the topaz 8 font. (37.62)

   03-Feb-1992  CH      Optimized the  C source  Generator  a bit  saving
                        612 bytes on  the executable.  Also  it's  a  bit
                        faster. (37.63)

   05-Feb-1992  CH-SA   The  generated  C source  now  always  checks the
                        screen font so that the gadgets, bevel  boxes and
                        texts are always placed correctly in  the  window
                        Suggested by Sebastiano Vigna. (37.64)

   06-Feb-1992  CH      From now on the  Zoom options  are only available
                        when the sizing gadget of the window  is switched
                        off. (37.65)

   08-Feb-1992  CH-SA   The generated assembler source now always  checks
                        the screen font so that the gadgets, bevel  boxes
                        and  texts are  always  placed  correctly  in the
                        window. Suggested by Sebastiano Vigna. (37.66)

   08-Feb-1992  NF-SA   The Assembler source generator is  now also  able
                        to   generate  source  which  will  automatically
                        adapt  itself to any font.   Please  refer to the
                        "Adapt Font"  chapter in  the docs for more info.
                        Suggested by Sebastiano Vigna. (37.67)

   09-Feb-1992  NF-SA   GadToolsBox  now  defaults  to  the TEXT overscan
                        resolution. Suggested by Kai Bolay. (37.68)

   09-Feb-1992  NF_SA   GadToolsBox now  defaults  to  using  the  system
                        default font uppon startup.   Also the main menus
                        use the screen font when possible.   Suggested by
                        Kai Bolay. (37.69)

   09-Feb-1992  MIN     Fixed a bug in the preferences.  The  preferences
                        would  re-open  the  editscreen   when  Save  was
                        selected and the  preferences  window  was  still
                        open causing two open screens. (37.70)

   09-Feb-1992  CH      Changed the Alert to warn the user if one  of the
                        disk based libraries could  not be  opened into a
                        "Retry"  "Cancel"  requester.   Suggested  by Kai
                        Bolay. (37.71)

   09-Feb-1992  MIN     Fixed   a  bug  in  the  Screen  Tags  requester.
                        The title gadget  had  the same  ID as  the  type
                        gadget causing  the screen  type to  change  when
                        the screen title was changed. (37.72)

   10-Feb-1992  NF-SA   Added   a   preferences   switch which  tells the
                        Assembler source generator to create XREFs to the
                        amiga.lib _LVO table instead of  using constants.
                        Added  QED ARexx script  which  converts old  GTB
                        assembler files to using _LVO calls. ARexx script
                        and suggestion by Ken Simpson. (37.73)

   11-Feb-1992  CH      The C source  generator  now  generates a  global
                        ( or static )   pointer(s) to  the  window  title
                        enabling the user to  change  these at  run-time.
                        This can be  handy  for  programs that  setup the
                        title at run-time. (37.74)

   12-Feb-1992  NF      Added the "Toggle" switch in the button requester
                        to enable you to create toggle select  gadgets. I
                        think that this should have been  possible with a
                        simple tag. (37.75)

   13-Feb-1992  CH-MIN  Enhanced some things. And fixed the bug (I think)
                        that GadToolsBox  sometimes  didn't generate  the
                        correct IDCMP Flags. (37.76)

   14-Feb-1992  CH      Now it's possible to break  of a  gadget/bevelbox
                        operation when the rubber-band  box is  displayed
                        using the ESC key. (37.77)

   14-Feb-1992  CH      The source generators now use the full  YSize  of
                        the run-time  system  font  to  re-calculate  the
                        gadget, bevel-boxes and window sizes. (37.78)

   18-Feb-1992  MAJ     The menu routines could screw up by thinking that
                        some items had sub-items while this  wasn't true.
                        This could (would) result in  corrupt  menus when
                        the file was saved  and later  reloaded.   To fix
                        this   I've  added  the  possibility to  erase  a
                        complete sub-item bar with the  touch  of a  key.
                        Please read the "__IMPORTANT__" chapter  from the
                        doc file for an  explanation of  how  to  restore
                        these corrupt files.   Bug found by Andreas Jung.
                        (37.79)

   19-Feb-1992  CH      GadToolsBox now defaults to using  the same  font
                        as the font of  the default  public screen.  Also
                        the "New"  routine  will now  reset to  that same
                        font. Suggested by Kai Bolay. (37.80)

   24-Feb-1992  MIN     GadToolsBox used to leave some outstanding  locks
                        locked when started from   the  workbench.   This
                        resulted in the icon of the disk it was on not to
                        disappear when ejected and a little  memory loss.
                        This has been fixed. (37.81)

   25-Feb-1992  MIN     There was  still some  problems with  GadToolsBox
                        generating the correct IDCMP flags.   Now this is
                        (hopefully) fixed. (37.82)

                        the binary file. This has been  fixed.  The  file
                        structure of 1.1 cannot  be read  by 1.0 but  the
                        1.0 file structure can be read by 1.1 (37.5)

   08-Nov-1991  NF-SA   Source  generator  now  generates  two files. One
                        file that contains the data and  routines and one
                        file  containing  the  constants   and  XREFs  or
                        EXTERNs. Originally suggested  by Wolfgang Küting
                        for PowerSource. (37.6)

   19-Nov-1991  MAJ     Assembler source generator really screwed up with
                        the generation  of  newmenus.  Thats what you get
                        when I have to do all testing myself..... (37.7)

   19-Nov-1991  NF      Added an option to also generate a routine  which
                        will open the used font when it's a disk-font and
                        the new "Gen. OpenFont" preferences switch is on.

                        Ten Hz and A2024 Fifteen Hz  screen modes.  NOTE:
                        Since I still work  with a normal  1084s  monitor
                        I  did  not  get a  chance  to  test the  program
                        with these  screen  modes.  If something  doesn't
                        look like it's supposed to please  let  me  know.
                        DO NOT USE THE  PRODUCTIVITY  AND/OR  A2024 MODES
                        ON A STANDARD RGB MONITOR OR  SERIOUS  DAMAGE MAY

                        color-indicator  on  the   top  to  small.   This
                        resulted in a  color  gadget  that  could  not be
                        selected anymore. (37.10)

   22-Nov-1991  NF      Added the  workbench  busy   pointer to  indicate

   23-Nov-1991  NF      Iv'e added a preferences switch which will,  when
                        switched   on,   automatically  re-position   the
                        gadgets and/or window texts so that  they  appear
                        on the same place when you switch from editing on
                        a GZZ window to a normal window  or  vice  versa.

                        contain 0. This has been fixed. (37.14)

   25-Nov-1991  MIN     The   menus   contained   some   double  shortcut
                        keys. This has been removed. (37.15)

   26-Nov-1991  NF      Just not to let the above (25-Nov-1991) happen to
                        you I've build in a routine which detects it when
                        you  want  to use  a shortcut  character  in your
                        menus that you  have  already  used in  the menu.
                        (37.16)

   26-Nov-1991  NF      The palette requester now has a Load  and a  Save
                        gadget enabling you to save the colors to an  IFF
                        ILBM  file or to load them from an IFF-ILBM file.
                        (37.17)

   29-Nov-1991  CH      Changed  the file  structure a  bit again.  Older
                        files can always  be  read  by newer  GadToolsBox
                        versions. (37.18)

   29-Nov-1991  NF-SA   Added  great  new  feature.  Gadget  positioning/
                        sizing  in  a  user-definable  grid.   Just  like
                        DPaint!  Suggested originally for  PowerSource by
                        Kasper Peeters. (37.19)

   30-Nov-1991  NF      Gadget creation, movements  and  sizings are  now
                        restricted to the area within the window borders.
                        This means that it's impossible to move a  gadget
                        partly outside the window area. (37.20)

   30-Nov-1991  NF      The  program now allows you to adjust the minimum
                        distance  that  the  gadgets must  have from  the
                        window borders. (37.21)

   02-Dec-1991  NF      Added  the  possibility to draw bevelboxes and to
                        generate the necessary source for it. (37.22)

   03-Dec-1991  NF      GadToolsBox now generates three routines. One for
                        opening  the  window/screen  and  allocating  the
                        gadgets. One for  closing  and  deallocating  the
                        window/screen and  gadgets again.  And  one  that
                        renders the text's and  BevelBoxes in the  window
                        it's RastPort. This "Render" routine, if present,
                        should be  called  between the  GT_BeginRefresh()
                        and     GT_EndRefresh()    call's     when     an
                        IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW  message  has  arived at  the
                        window UserPort. (37.22)

   06-Dec-1991  NF      When the program  has to  switch  to the  default
                        ID because you load  a file  using a  display  ID
                        that isn't available the original  display  ID is
                        saved  and  when  you  write  the file  again the
                        original display ID is used again. (37.23)

                        the correct source for joined string and listview
                        gadgets. The source to fill the Gadget array  did
                        not get generated at all. (37.24)

   11-Dec-1991  NF      GadToolsBox  now also  supports  Text and  Number
