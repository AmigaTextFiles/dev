ClassAct is a set of over 30 BOOPSI classes co-authored by Christopher
Aldi, Timothy Aston, Osma Ahvenlampi, and Petter Nilsen.  Its now being
published by Finale Development, Inc.

ClassAct provides object-oriented building blocks for your application in
the form of Intuition BOOPSI classes available as either shared run-time or
link-time libraries.  As they are standard classes, they may be used with
any application environment supporting BOOPSI.  ClassAct is a complete GUI
system in its own right, supporting everything from simple buttons to an
advanced list management class, and includes a complete window GUI layout
system classes that lets you create font-sensitive and resizable interfaces
quickly and easily, including any preferenced window backfill pattern
loadable via the system DataTypes.

Programs that use ClassAct can be made freely distributable, shareware,
commercial, etc.  and there is NO FEE for users.  When you purchase
ClassAct, users of your software get to use all the preferences functions
of our system.  ClassAct a powerful and time-saving choice for software
developers, and an affordable and convenient one as well.

Since ClassAct classes are BOOPSI, they automatically support all kinds of
great features such as window relatively (resizability), 3.x help,
notification, and interconnections with other BOOPSI classes (which do not
necessarily have to be ClassAct classes).  ClassAct classes are "standard"
AmigaOS BOOPSI class libraries, much like the colorwheel and gradient
sliders that come with release 3.x of the Amiga's operating system.
ClassAct classes are built for speed, power, efficiency and stability.

ClassAct is compatible with 2.04 (V37) thru 3.1 (V40) releases of the Amiga
operating system and take advantage of performance increases available in
release 3.x (V39+).  ClassAct has been tested with ECS, AGA, CyberGraphics,
Retina, Picasso II and EGS Spectrum.

ClassAct is an expanding project, providing you with the graphical user
interface tools you need to write your application.  ClassAct is currently
over 30 different classes, and the list is growing all the time!

Should You Use ClassAct?:
-------------------------
Have you written or are you currently in the process of developing Amiga
applications?  If so, the answer is a very definite YES, you should be
using ClassAct.

The graphic user interfaces of many Amiga applications fit atleast one or
more of the following descriptions:

 - Non-existant (i.e. command line only)
 - Not font sensitive
 - Not Locale sensitive
 - Slow
 - Memory Intensive
 - Unattractive
 - Lacking in intuitiveness and originality
 - Non-standard
 - Poor or limited keyboard control

The reasons for this are simple.  Many of the existing systems for creating
a GUI are either limited in features, slow, hard to use, and/or violate
system standards.  ClassAct makes every attempt to combine compability,
flexiblity, usablility and some originality while following Amiga style
guide.

This is why you should use ClassAct.  The Amiga is a graphic system and
applications should have a attractive and responsive graphic user
interface.  The ClassAct toolkit allows you to easily create an attractive
GUI that doesn't suffer from the deficiencies listed above.

If you want your application to be easy to use, fast and professional
looking then you should consider ClassAct.
