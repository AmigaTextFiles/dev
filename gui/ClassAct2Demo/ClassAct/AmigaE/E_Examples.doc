Notes for the Amiga E API for ClassAct
--------------------------------------

 o Remember that in E, an external function name must have the first letter
   in uppercase, and the second one in lowercase.  For this reason, some
   function call have slightly different names than the ones used in
   the Autodocs:

    LAYOUT_GetClass()    is Layout_GetClass()
    CLICKTAB_GetClass()  is ClickTab_GetClass()
    etc...

   Check the modules when uncertain about the name to use.


 o Don't forget to put OPT PREPROCESS at the top of your source to be able
   to use the macros.



Other/Classact_lib.m
----------------------
This module holds a few goodies for ClassAct, ported from the linked
library.  Note that some functions in it are still untested.
