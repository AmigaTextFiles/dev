LED Image Class - (c) Copyright 1994 Commodore-Amiga, Inc. All Rights Reserved

This is the source for an "LED" image class BOOPSI object with a SAS 6
lmkfile (makefile).  Please note that the lmkfile may contain some references
to various directories you don't have, but they do not affect compilation.
The include directory contains a few updated beta V42 intuition include files
which are required to compile this example.  The lmkfile is set up to look
first in this local include directory, and then in INCLUDE:, so the updated
beta V42 intuition includes will be used when compiling.  Copy the final
compiled and stripped object "led.ld.strip" to SYS:Classes/images/led.image
to test with the test program "test".
