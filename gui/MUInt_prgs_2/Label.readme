This is a version of the Label program I distributed earlier. This 
version will not only print labels, but print UPS COD tags. It uses 
the new STRING gadgets. 

You can add a label to the list by entering the data on the screen.

I actually use this program daily. I am releasing it to you so you 
can use it as example code for the String Gagdets.

I use the file NewDate to plug in the date automatically. NewDate is 
available on AmiNet. It's very well done.
