NAME
       unshar - unpack a shar file

SYNOPSIS
       unshar  [  -d  directory  ] [ -c ] [ -e | -E exit_line ] [
       file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Unshar scans mail messages looking  for  the  start  of  a
       shell  archive.  It then passes the archive through a copy
       of the shell to unpack it. It will accept multiple  files.
       If  no files are given, standard input is used.  This man-
       ual page reflects unshar version 4.0.

OPTIONS
       Options have a one letter version starting  with  -  or  a
       long version starting with --. The exception is --help and
       --version which does not have a short version.

       --version
              Print the version number of the program on standard
              output, then immediately exits.

       --help Print a help summary on standard output, then imme-
              diately exits.

       -d DIRECTORY  --directory=DIRECTORY
              Change directory to DIRECTORY before unpacking  any
              files.

       -c  --overwrite
              Passed  as  an option to the shar file.  Many shell
              archive scripts (including those produced by `shar'
              3.40  and  newer) accepts a -c argument to indicate
              that existing files should be overwritten.

       -e  --exit-0
              This option exists mainly for  people  who  collect
              many  shell  archives  into  a  single mail folder.
              With this option, `unshar' isolates each  different
              shell  archive  from the others which have been put
              in the same file, unpacking each in in  turn,  from
              the  beginning  of  the  file towards its end.  Its
              proper operation relies on the fact that many  shar
              files are terminated by a `exit 0' at the beginning
              of a line.

              Option -e is internally equivalent to -E "exit  0".

       -E STRING  --split-at=STRING
              This  option  works  like  -e, but it allows you to
              specify the string that separates archives if `exit
              0' isn't appropriate.

UNSHAR(1)                                               UNSHAR(1)


              For  example, noticing that most `.signatures' have
              a `--' on a line right before them, one  can  some-
              times   use  `--split-at=--'  for  splitting  shell
              archives which lack the `exit 0' line at end.   The
              signature  will then be skipped altogether with the
              headers of the following message.
