COMPRESS makes a .Z file
UUENCODE makes a .uu file
UNARC needs the proper file in the path.
LhaARC needs Lha in the path
LISTARC will create a file in ram that
contains the listing of an archive. If
a file in ram has the same root name as
the archive, but ends in .readme, the
listing will be appended to the readme.

This is a quick way to get a packing list 
into your readme.

The files shar and unshar are UNIX tools 
ported to the Amiga by Will Bow. 
They require the ixemul.library.
Shar and unshar are not implemented. The 
man pages are in the DOCS directory.
