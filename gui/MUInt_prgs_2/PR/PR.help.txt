This program is a bit rough. I've included it in this distribution in 
hopes that someone might be interested in making it work perfectly. 

REQUIRES: ixemul.library v40.4 or higher.

Read the PR.1 man page for details. I have NOT included all of the 
options that PR can use. Some of them are quite silly.

I intend to have the PrintController programs launched from buttons 
on this GUI.
