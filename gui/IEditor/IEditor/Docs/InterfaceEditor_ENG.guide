is FREEWARE.

This  program  may  be  freely  distributed  provided  that  all files are
included  in  the  distribution  without any modifications.  You may *NOT*
charge more than Fred Fish does for a single library disk.

This  program  may *not* be uploaded on BBS's that claim copyrights on the
uploaded material.

When  you  use  this program to design GUI(s) for either a commercial or a
shareware  program  I  would  appreciate  a  little note about this in the
documentation  of  the program. I would appreciate also to @{"receive" link author} a copy
of that program, or, at least, a demo!  :-)

Commercial  distribution  of Interface Editor and/or its relative files is
*NOT* allowed without written permission from the author.  This also means
the distribution on cover disks, disk magazines etc.

I'll  be  glad  to  give  the  permission  to  insert this program on disk
magazines or cover disks if I receive a copy of it.  Write @{"me" link author} for details.

Only the output of IEditor is not subjected to these rules.
@ENDNODE

@NODE register "How to register"

IEditor is now freeware. Anyway, if you think that it or its sources helped
you, you can always send @{"me" link author} a contribution. It's up to you.

@ENDNODE

@NODE updates "Updates"

Once  registered,  you'll receive a special keyfile which will let you use
any  copy  of  IE  without  limitations.   So,  you  can get updates of IE
directly from the PD distribution networks.

You can always find the latest  version  of  IEditor  on  Aminet,  in  the
'dev/gui' directory.

Every registered user who has got an E-Mail address will receive a message
when a new version of IE is released.


IEditor is also present on the World Wide Web. Its URL is the following:

@NODE introduction "Introduction"

Interface  Editor  lets  you  save  a huge amount of time when you have to
design  a  GadTools  User Interface for your programs.  This program's the
successor  of  Interface Editor v1.0, which was a little program with very
little control on the aspect of the interface.  Starting with version 2.0,
I've  tried  to  make  IEditor  a  good  user-friendly  program; I've also
improved the output that, in v1.0, was very bad!

These are the main features of IEditor v2:

               A complete intuition/gadtools user interface

               Editing on many different screen resolutions

        Editing/Generating source on/for big autoscrolling screens

                   All GadTools gadget kinds supported

               Full control over the window flags and tags

                   Fully mouse and keyboard controlled

                             Multiple windows

                  User selectable font for every gadget

        The possibility to change screen resolution while editing

                  Easy gadget alignment and dimensioning

            Multiple gadget moves, deletes, edits and copies.

                  Boolean gadgets, Bevel Boxes, MENU_IMAGEs

                                ARexx Port

                          ARexx Interface Editor

                    Expandible using external modules

                                   ...
@ENDNODE

@NODE requirements "Minimal configuration required"

InterfaceEditor requires Kickstart 2.04+ and 512kb RAM at least.

It's advisable to use at least a 8 kbytes stack for IE.

These libraries are used by IEditor:

 reqtools.library  v37+
 icon.library      v37+
 locale.library    v38+ (optional)
 asl.library       v37+
 gadtools.library  v37+
 intuition.library v37+
 dos.library       v37+
 graphics.library  v37+
 diskfont.library  v37+
 iffparse.library  v37+
 rexxsyslib.library     (optional)

To compile the output of IEditor you need a C compiler (like DICE)  or  an
assembler with 2.0 includes or the Amiga E compiler (EC) v2.1b or better.

If you  generate  the  Assembly  sources  with the RawCode @{"parameter" link asmprefs}, the
include files won't be needed.

InterfaceEditor has been tested on these machines:

· Amiga  1200  68EC020  28MHz 
  2Mb CHIP   4Mb FAST Ram    ( Blizzard 1220/4 )
  HD IDE Conner 1.2 Gb
  Squirrel Classic
  CD-ROM SCSI Pioneer DR-U124X
  2 Floppy  Drives
  Kick v39.106 - WB v39.29   ( Release 3.0 )

· Amiga 4000/40  68040  25MHz
  2Mb CHIP  16Mb FAST Ram
  HD IDE Conner 210 Mb
  HD IDE Seagate ST144At  124 Mb
  Kick v39.106 - WB v40.42   ( Release 3.0 )

· Amiga 2000B    68000  7MHz 
  1Mb CHIP   2Mb FAST Ram 
  HD SCSI 850 Mb
  Kick v40.63 - WB v40.42    ( Release 3.1 )
@ENDNODE

@NODE starting "Starting with Interface Editor"

You can run Interface Editor from either the Shell or the Workbench.  From
Shell,  it  accepts as a argument the name of a previously saved GUI file.
From WB, it accept as WB argument the icon of a previously saved GUI... ;)

When  it's  loaded,  you  will  see  a  screen  with a little window:  the
@{"ToolBar" link toolbar}.  Then you can load an old interface or start creating a new one.

To load a GUI you can select the item @{"Open..." link "open"} in the first  menu  or  you
can  click on the 10th gadget of the @{"ToolBar" link toolbar} and then select the file you
want to load.

To  start  creating a new interface, you must click on the first gadget of
the @{"ToolWindow" link toolbar} or select the item @{"New..." link "new"} in the "Windows" menu.
@ENDNODE

@NODE making "Making a Gadget"

Making  a gadget is very simple.  First of all you have to select the item
"Add..."  in the "Gadgets" menu or click on the 5th gadget of the @{"ToolBar" link toolbar}.
Then  you  must  choose  the kind of the gadget in the listview which will
appear.

Now  move  the  mouse pointer to where you want the top-left corner of the
gadget  to  be  (you'll  see the coordinates on the ScreenBar).  Click LMB
(left  mouse  button)  and  move  the  mouse while olding down the button.
You'll  see  a  box which represents your gadget, whose dimensionsions are
showed in the ScreenBar.

Once you've decided the size of the gadget, release the mouse button.

A  requester will pop up:  here you can edit the gadget title.  After that
another request will pop up letting you modify the gadget tags.

Then, the gadget will be created.  If the creation operation fails, you'll
see a black rectangle intead of the gadget.

Here's a list of the gadget supported by IE2:

        @{" BUTTON        " link "button"}
        @{" CHECKBOX      " link "checkbox"}
        @{" INTEGER       " link "integer"}
        @{" LISTVIEW      " link "listview"}
        @{" MX            " link "mx"}
        @{" NUMBER        " link "number"}
        @{" CYCLE         " link "cycle"}
        @{" PALETTE       " link "palette"}
        @{" SCROLLER      " link "scroller"}
        @{" SLIDER        " link "slider"}
        @{" STRING        " link "string"}
        @{" TEXT          " link "text"}
        @{" BOOLEAN       " link "boolean"}


Note that the @{"CHECKBOX" link checkbox} and @{"MX" link mx} gadgets have a fixed size which means that
you  cannot  make them any size you wish (unless you set the scaled tag of
the  gadget).   Moreover,  with  placing  these gadgets, there can be some
problems  if  you  use a font bigger than Topaz 8 and don't set the scaled
tag.

NOTE:  the @{"BOOLEAN" link boolean} gadget type isn't handled by gadtools.library, but it's
       a simple intuition gadget.
@ENDNODE

@NODE selection "Gadget Selection"

If the gadgets aren't disabled or detached, to select one of them you have
to  press  LMB  where  there  are no gadgets, then (holding down the mouse
button)  draw  a  rectangle  so that the gadget(s) that you want to select
is/are partly or completely covered by the box.

If the gadgets are disabled or detached you can simply click on the gadget
you  like  to  select.   You  can  always  drag a box around more than one
gadget, to do a multiple selection.

Moreover,  if  you  hold  down the SHIFT @{"key" link keyboard}, the gadgets currently active
won't be deactivated, but will remain active.

When  a gadget is activated, it will have a box around it with four dot in
the corners.
@ENDNODE

@NODE move "Moving & Sizing Gadgets"

It  is  possible  to  move or @{"resize" link size} one or more gadgets at the same time,
depending on how many gadgets are @{"selected" link "selection"}.

To  move  a gadget, simply click on it and move the mouse holding down the
mouse  button.   (If you want to move more than a gadget at the same time,
you'll have to keep a Shift @{"key" link keyboard} pressed)

You'll  see  boxes representing your gadgets, when they're where you want,
just release the mouse button.  It wasn't so hard, was it?

To @{"size" link size}  a  gadget  you'll have to click in one of its four corners; then
move the mouse while holding down the button.  Release the mouse button to
perform the changes.
@ENDNODE

@NODE size "Gadgets/Size..."

You can choose to size a gadget (or more than one) by specifying its width
and height or by sizing them with your @{"mouse" link move}.

In  the  first  case, select the item "Gadgets/Size...":  a requester will
pop  up,  enter  here the values you want (also X and Y coordinates can be
entered here).
@ENDNODE

@NODE copy "Gadgets/Copy"

This  will  create  a  copy of the @{"selected" link "selection"} gadgets:  after selecting this
item,  you  will  see  boxes  representing  the selected gadgets that will
follow  the  mouse pointer.  When they're where you want them to be, press
LMB.

The  new  gadgets  will  be  created  in  that place and will have ALL the
attributes equal to the original gadgets, labels included.

@NODE new "Project/New"

This  will  remove  from  memory  the  current  GUI, so that you can start
creating a new one from scratch.

If  the  GUI hasn't be saved, you will be asked if you want to continue or
to abort the operation.
@ENDNODE

@NODE open "Project/Open..."

This  will  present  you with a filerequester in which you must select the
GUI  that  you  wish  to  load.   When you have made changes to the GUI in
memory that have not been saved yet you will be asked if you want:

    A)  Yes    -   Delete the GUI in memory.
    B)  No     -   Abort the operation.

When the loading operation is finished you will be able to select a window to
open with the menu @{"Windows/Open..." link "openwindow"}
@ENDNODE

@NODE save "Project/Save"

This  will save the GUI currently in memory to the name under which it was
saved  last  time.   If  it's the first time you save it, a file requester
will pop up asking for a file name.
@ENDNODE

@NODE saveas "Project/Save As..."

This has the same function of "Project/Save...", but always opens the file
requester.
@ENDNODE

@NODE gensrc "Project/Generate Source..."

This will present you with a filerequester in which you  must  select  the
name which will be used to save the generated source.

If you haven't chose a generator yet, its @{"configuration" link genprefs}  window  will pop
up. Otherwise, IE will use the generator you've chosen before.

Please refer to @{" The Generated Source " link "source"} chapter for more information.
@ENDNODE

@NODE closewb "Preferences/Workbench"

This  will  try  to close the Workbench (or open it if it was closed).  If
you  close  the  WB  and  then  exit  from  IEditor, the Workbench will be
automatically opened again.
@ENDNODE

@NODE about "Project/About..."

I think you know what it does, don't you?  Well, it opens that window with
copyright  infos  and  my  address that you should see every time you load
Interface Editor  (unless you are a registered user ;).
@ENDNODE

@NODE quit "Project/Exit"

Selecting  this  item,  you will leave IEditor.  If the current GUI is not
saved,  IE  will  ask you if you want to "Save", save it in binary format,
"Exit", quit immediatly or "Cancel", don't quit.
@ENDNODE

@NODE delete "Gadgets/Remove"

Selecting this item, a requester will ask you if you really want to delete the
@{"selected" link "selection"} gadget.  Answering yes to it, will cause IEditor to delete them, for
ever.

You can delete the gadgets also by pressing the 'DEL' @{"key" link keyboard}.

REMEMBER: Once a gadget is deleted, you cannot bring it back!
@ENDNODE

@NODE tags "Gadgets/Tags..."

This will open a requester to edit the tags of the gadget(s) @{"selected" link "selection"}.

For every gadtools gadget, you'll find these gadgets:

  Title:           Insert here the gadget text.

  Label:           This will identify the gadget in the source. Note that
                   if you don't specify it, it will be created when the
                   source is generated.

  Title Position:  This lets you select where the gadget text should be
                   placed.

  Underscore:      Check it if you want an underlined letter in the gadget
                   text.  The letter to underline must be preceded by "_".

  Highlight Title: Check it if you want the title to be written with the
                   Highlight Pen of the screen. With some gadgets kind, it
                   has no effect.


Other gadgets are present according to the kind of the gadget.


Select the kind you want to know more about:

     @{" BUTTON        " link "button"}
     @{" CHECKBOX      " link "checkbox"}
     @{" INTEGER       " link "integer"}
     @{" LISTVIEW      " link "listview"}
     @{" MX            " link "mx"}
     @{" NUMBER        " link "number"}
     @{" CYCLE         " link "cycle"}
     @{" PALETTE       " link "palette"}
     @{" SCROLLER      " link "scroller"}
     @{" SLIDER        " link "slider"}
     @{" STRING        " link "string"}
     @{" TEXT          " link "text"}

This gadget type is not handled by gadtools.library, so it hasn't got  any
tag, but maybe you want to know which parameters you can modify... ;)

     @{" BOOLEAN       " link "boolean"}
@ENDNODE

@NODE left "Gadgets/Align/Left"

This asks you to click on the gadget  that has the left-edge  that you want

                        one.
                        This works only with kick v39+.

    MinimizeISG         It tells Intuition to use the smallest Inter  Screen
                        Gap possible for your screen.

                        one generated by IE. In that way, you  can  insert
                        into the catalog more strings than the  ones  used
                        by your GUI.

                        file that will be created for that language.
                        Note that the ".ct" suffix is automatically added
                        by IEditor.

    Delete              This will remove the selected  language  and  ALL
                        the translation strings related to it.



    Strings             Here you can  handle  all  the  strings  of  your
                        application.   So   you   can  handle  the  whole
                        localization process from inside IEditor.
                        Double-clicking on a string brings up the  string

@NODE text "TEXT"
 This are the tags you can specify with IE:

    CopyText            When checked GadTools will  copy  the text  to  an
                        internal buffer so that the  program  can  use  it
                        again.

    Border              When  checked  the  created  gadget  will  have  a

                        will be created in the source.
                        E.g. If you have a window whose label  is  "Win",
                        you will find this in the source:
                        WinMsg     ds.b  im_SIZEOF

    Clicked Ptr         If checked, each gadget that generates  an  IDCMP

                        <gadget label>Clicked in its UserData field.
                        So,  when  you  receive  an  IDCMP  msg from your

                        gg_UserData. Of course, in  your  source  you

                        <Gadget Label>Clicked( void).

    IDCMP Handler       This will active  the generation of the IDCMP

                        (CatComp should be in the path).
                        Otherwise, the generator  will  create  those
                        files by itself.
                        NOTE: in the  strings  file  created  by  the

@NODE fontadaptive "Font Adaptivity"

IEditor  is  able to create GUIs which will automatically adapt their size
to  the font used in the screen they'll use:  that means that the position
and  the  size  of  all  the gadgets, bevel-boxes, images, etc...  will be
fitted according to the font size.

The  source  will  also  adapt the size and position of windows.  Moreover
it'll check if the window will fit in the screen:  if it doesn't, the font
"topaz 8" will be used.

IE allows you to use any font when designing a font-adaptive GUI, but I'll
recommend  you  not to use a font too large, otherwise there could be some
problems adapting the gadgets.

NOTE WELL: be careful when using fixed size gadgets such as @{"MX" link mx}, @{"CHECKBOX" link checkbox},
@{"BOOLEAN" link boolean}  and  @{"images" link imgbank}:   their  size  won't  be  modified in order to be
adapted to the font!
@ENDNODE

@NODE handler "The IDCMP Handler"

The IDCMP Handler is a little routine which /handles/ all the message that
arrive  at  your window user port:  it creates a copy of the IntuiMessage,
then it calls the appropriate routine.  The name of the routine called are
composed in this way:

             <Window Label><Idcmp kind>

Example:   If  an  IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW message arrive at your "Main" window, the
IDCMP handler will call the routine MainCloseWindow.

There  are  two  exceptions:   IDCMP_GADGETUP/DOWN and IDCMP_MENUPICK:  in
these  cases  the  IDCMP  Handler  will  call  the  routine pointed by the
UserData field of the gadget/menu.

Moreover  IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW  messages  are  completely  handled  by  the
handler.

In  the assembly language, the routines called will found a pointer to the
copy of the IntuiMessage in A5.

See the "GMExample" source code for a real-life example.
@ENDNODE

@NODE keyhandler "The Gadget Activation Key Handler"

The  Activation  Key  Handler  is a little routine which handles the IDCMP
VanillaKey messages that refer to a gadget activation key...

So  you  can  set your underscores without being bothered of how to handle
them!

The routine behaves like that:

 - with @{"INTEGER" link integer} and @{"STRING" link string} kinds, it performs an ActivateGadget()
 - with  other  gadget  kinds,  it  invokes the <Gadget Label>KeyPressed()
   routine.

NOTE:   if  you set the IDCMP_VANILLAKEY flag for your window, and you use
the  @{"IDCMP  Handler" link handler},  if  the key handler doesn't recognize the activation
key,  the  routine  <Window  Label>VanillaKey  will be invoked, so you can
process other keys than the gadgets's ones.
@ENDNODE

@NODE source "The Generated Source"

For  the Asm and C languages, IEditor creates two source files.  The first
(.c|.s)  will  contain all the routines and data needed to set up the GUI.
The second (.h|.i) will contain the Externs or XREFs and the constants for
the gadgets ID.


NOTE:   if  you generate the Amiga E source, remember that all your labels
will have the first letter converted in lowercase!


In  the  main  file  the following routines are generated:

==========================================================================
   int SetupScreen( void );
==========================================================================

    This routine will open or lock the screen and get its visual info.
    This  routine  can  return  one of the following errors:

        0 = No error.
        1 = Could not open or lock the screen.
        2 = Could not get the screen visual info.

==========================================================================
   void CloseDownScreen( void );
==========================================================================

    This routine will free the resources taken by "SetupScreen()".  You
    must still call this routine when  "SetupScreen()"  failed to close
    and free the resources that didn't fail to open!!!

==========================================================================
   int Open<Window_Label>Window( void );
==========================================================================

    There  are  as  much of these routines as there are Windows in your
    GUI. These routines will set-up the gadgets and open the window.
    These routines can return one of the following errors:

        0 = No error.
        1 = Could not create a gadget context.
        2 = Error during the gadgets creation.
        3 = Could not create menus.
        4 = Could not open the window.

==========================================================================
   void Close<Window_Label>Window( void );
==========================================================================

    There are as much of these routines as there are  Windows  in  your
    GUI.    These   routines   will  free  all   resources   that   the
    "Open<Window_Label>Window()" routine has taken.   You   must  still
    call this routine if "Open<Window_Label>Window()" has failed!


The  main  file also has the following globals defined which are shared by
all project windows:

    struct Screen *Scr;          A pointer to the opened/locked screen
    APTR           VisualInfo;   A pointer to the visual info

The following globals are only generated when the file contains gadgets or
when the window must have a zoom gadget or when you've selected a font for
a gadget:

   struct Gadget   *<Gadget_Label>GList;   The created gadgets
   WORD             <Window_Label>Zoom[4]; The window alternate positions
   struct TextFont *<font_name><font_height>_<font_style><font_flags>;

Are also generated pointers for each project window that is in memory:

    struct Window   *<Window_Label>Wnd;

Moreover, when the screen is generated and the tag Error Code is set, this
ULONG will be included in the source:

    ULONG           ErrorCode = NULL;

Here you will find an error code which will tell  you  what's  gone  wrong
while opening the screen.

Last but not least, in the  source  a  variable  called  YOffset  will  be
generated: its value it's equal to Scr->WBorTop + Scr->Font->YSize. If you
modify the screen font, you * MUST * update this variable!
In the same way, you've got to keep up-to-date the XOffset variable, equal
to Scr->WBorLeft.


If some images are present in your GUI, IE will create these structures:

   struct Image <Image Label>Img = ...

and  if  you  put some images in the windows, structures like this will be
created:

   struct Image <Window Label>_<Img number>Image = ...


When  you've  not set the item "Generate" in the screen menu, this pointer
is generated:

    UBYTE          *PubScreenName = NULL;

This  will  allow  you  to change the name of the public screen to open on
with out having to hack in the generated source.

Also  the  main  file  contains the Gadget Array's for each project window
which are define as follows:

 struct Gadget *<Window_Label>Gadgets[];

To  access  the  pointers  in  this array the program generates DEFINES or
EQU'S in the header file which specify the position of a certain gadget in
the array.  These defines are build as follows:

 #define GD_<Gadget_Label>


If @{"requested" link srcparams}, IE will generate the following routines:

==========================================================================
   BOOL  OpenDiskFonts( void );
==========================================================================

Opens all the diskfonts used in the GUI.

Returns FALSE (in asm, d0 = 0) if it couldn't open a font.

Anyway, you *MUST* always call CloseDiskFont before your program exits!

The pointers to the TextFont structures will be called:

<Font Label>Font

where <Font Label> is composed of:

<Font Name><Size>_<Flags><Style>

==========================================================================
   void CloseDiskFonts( void );
==========================================================================

Closes all the diskfonts opened by OpenDiskFonts.

When   you   call   these    routines,    the    "graphics.library"    and
"diskfont.library" libraries must already be open!



See also:

     @{" MultiSelect Lists " link multiselectsrc}

     @{" Gauge.iex         " link gaugeiex}



Be sure that the  "gadtools.library",  "intuition.library"  are  all  open
BEFORE  any  of  the generated routines is called. When you use a diskfont
you should open it  via  "OpenDiskFont()"  before  calling  the  generated
routines, unless you've setted OpenDiskFonts in the source @{"parameters" link srcparams}.
@ENDNODE

@NODE arexxroutines "ARexx Routines"

When you enter some @{"ARexx" link arexxed} commands, IE will put also these  variables  in
the source:

UWORD RX_Unconfirmed         number of ARexx msg not replied yet.
                             This is *READ ONLY*!!!

struct MsgPort *RexxPort     this is your ARexx port.

UBYTE RexxPortName[]         final name of your ARexx port.
                             (basename.1, basename.2, etc...)



These are the ARexx Interface management routines:

===========================================================================
   BOOL SetupRexxPort( void )
===========================================================================

Returns TRUE if succesful, FALSE otherwise.

If it fails as well as you couldn't open  rexxsyslib.library,  you  should
*NOT* call any other ARexx related function generated by IE.


===========================================================================
   void DeleteRexxPort( void )
===========================================================================

Remove the port created by SetupRexxPort(). This function will  wait  until
all messages are replied. You could want to force it to return  immediately
by setting RX_Unconfirmed to zero before  calling  it,  but  this  is *NOT*
recommendable at all. The only reason you could have to do  this,  is  that
the system is going to blow up...


===========================================================================
   void HandleRexxMsg( void )
===========================================================================

This function will parse all ARexx messages received at your port and call
the related functions.

This function will call these routines:

ULONG <Command Label>Rexxed( ULONG *ArgArray, struct RexxMsg *Msg );

The result of these routines is put on rm_Result1.


ArgArray is an array of values filled by the ReadArgs() dos function.  See
its autodoc for more details.

Msg is a pointer to the RexxMsg that invoked your function. You can use it
if you want your command to return an argstring. E.g.:

ULONG TestRexxed( ULONG *ArgArray, struct RexxMsg *Msg )

===========================================================================

You can use this function  to  launch  external  ARexx  script  from  your
application, e.g. to assign ARexx script to function keys.

This function returns TRUE if successful.

char *Host     host name; it should be "REXX" to execute scripts,  or  the
               name of another host if you want to send ARexx commands  to
               another program.

char *Ext      if you want  to  execute  a  script,  this  should  be  the
               extension of that script.  E.g. if you want to execute  the
               script 'script1.myprg' you could use:

               SendRexxMsg( "REXX", NULL, "script1.myprg", NULL, NULL);

               or

               SendRexxMsg( "REXX", "myprg", "script1", NULL, NULL);


char *Command  command to execute.

APTR Msg       always pass NULL.

@NODE mainsrc "Main Routines"

In the <Project Name>Main.[c|s]  file  there  are  several  routines  that
performs these actions:

  - The libraries selected in the @{"main()" link mained} requester are opened.

  - The OpenDiskFonts() routine is invoked. (if needed)

  - The SetupScreen() routine is called.

  - The SetupRexxPort() routine is called. (if needed)

  - The windows you selected in the @{"main()" link mained} editor are opened.

  - If you entered an @{"Extra Proc" link mained}, then it is called.

  - Your program will start a Wait() loop until Ok_to_Run becomes FALSE.

  - Everything is closed and the program exits.


If something goes wrong, the Error() routine will be called.


From your program you can call the End() routine to quit.

NOTE WELL: when you call End(), you must have already closed  the  windows
that you have opened after the initialisation.


Moreover, you can use these variables:

BOOL  Ok_to_Run         if you set this to FALSE, the program will quit.

ULONG mask              this  is   the  bit  mask  passed  to  the  Wait()
                        function.
                        You should modify this according to  your  program
                        actions, e.g. if you  close  a  window,  you  must
                        remove its bit.

If you've set Workbench in the  @{"main()" link mained}  editor,  you'll  find  also  this
variable:

struct WBStartup *WBMsg;

This variable can be used for two purposes:
1. it can be used as a boolean to know if you've started from WB
   (WBMsg != NULL) or from CLI (WBMsg == NULL)
2. if the program started from WB, it can be used to retrieve the
   WB arguments.


If you select @{"Extra Signals" link mained}, a routine called  HandleOtherSignals()  will
be called when Wait() returns an unknown bit pattern.  You  must  set  the
extra signals you want to handle with an @{"ExtraProc" link mained} routine.
E.g.

void MySetup( void )
{
    mask = (1 << MickeyPort.mp_SigBit) | MouseTaskSig;
}



The main file uses an include file called IE_Errors.[h|i] in  which  there
are  the  error  strings  passed to Error. You can modify this file as you
wish.
@ENDNODE

@NODE gbanksrc "Gadget banks handling"

All the data related to the gadget banks are stored in structure equal  to
the  ones  used  by  IE  for  gadtools  gadgets. Thus you can use the same
routine to create the gadgets.

To create and  attach  a  bank  to  a  window,  you  should  perform  this
operations:

    struct Gadget *glist;

    if( MakeGadgets( &glist, <Label>Gadgets, <Label>NGad,
                     <Label>GTypes, <Label>GTags, <Label>_CNT ) > 0 )

        AddGadgetBank( <window label>Wnd, &<window label>WBanks, glist );

    else

        /*  The gadget couldn't be created  */


To remove the bank:

    RemGadgetBank( <window label>Wnd, &<window label>WBanks, glist );

And don't forget to free the gadgets with:

    FreeGadgets( glist );


NOTE: RemGadgetBank() does NOT clear the window! In fact, you  might  want
to  remove  a bank, recreate it and then reattach it to the window without
the user noticing any strange flicker in the window. Therefore if you want
the  bank  to  disappear,  you have to manually do an EraseRect() over the
bank area.


NOTE 2: The <window label>WBanks structures have to be considered PRIVATE!
So keep your hands off. ;-)
@ENDNODE

@NODE multiselectsrc "MultiSelect Listviews handling"

When you  generate  the  code  for  a  multiselect  listview,  the  symbol
ML_SELECTED will be defined in the <Prjoect>.h file.

ML_SELECTED is a flag that you should set in the ln_Pri field of the nodes
that should appear as selected in the listview.

Moreover, you must also keep that flag up-to-date. Here's  an  example  of
the minimal routine you should link to a multiselect click event:


    BOOL ListClicked( void )
    {
        static ULONG ListTag[] = { GTLV_Labels, 0, TAG_END };

        /* Detache the list from the gadget */

        ListTag[1] = (ULONG)~0;

        GT_SetGadgetAttrsA( MainGadgets[ GD_List ], MainWnd, NULL,
                            ( struct TagItem * )ListTag );

        /* Update its flags */

        ListNodes[ MainMsg.Code ].ln_Pri ^= ML_SELECTED;

        /* Reattach the list */

        ListTag[1] = (ULONG)&ListList;

        GT_SetGadgetAttrsA( MainGadgets[ GD_List ], MainWnd, NULL,
                            ( struct TagItem * )ListTag );

        return( TRUE );
    }


To find the items that  are  selected,  you  should  just  walk  the  list
checking the ML_SELCTED flag.
@ENDNODE

@NODE gaugeiex "Gauge.iex"

Using this expander you can easily generate and handle fuel gauges.

The expander will generate, for each gauge, a structure like this:

        struct FuelGauge {
            WORD    Left, Top;
            UWORD   Width, Height;
            ULONG   Tot, Part;
            UBYTE   Freedom;
        };


The first four and the last field are handled by IEditor and normally  you
shouldn't touch them.

Instead you have to modify the Tot and Part fields, according to your  own
need.  First of all, before opening the window where the guages are, you'd
better set the Part field to 0, so that the fuel gauge will be rendered as
"empty".  Moreover  Tot is to be set to the maximum value that you need to
represent.

Each time you want to show a change, you have to increase the  Part  value
and then call the function:

        SetFuel( <Window Label>Wnd, &<FuelGauge Label>Gauge );


For example, if you want to show to the user the progress of the  scanning
of 500 text lines, you can write:

        TestGauge.Tot  = 500;
        TestGauge.Part = 0;

        if(!( OpenFGTestWindow() )) {

            for( i = 0; i < 500; i++ ) {

                /*  ...some stuff you have to do...  */

                TestGauge.Part += 1;

                SetFuel( FGTestWnd, &TestGauge );
            }
        }

        CloseFGTestWindow();

@NODE credits "Credits"

It's useless to say that if I've managed to make IE so good,  it's  thanks
to such /creatures/ called "beta-testers" *;D who helped me *very* much to
improve the program... :)


So I'd like to thank:

 - Gian  Maria   Calzolari  and  Mario  Branchi  for  helping  me  in  the
   development  of  this  program,  its beta-testing and for moral support
   :-)

 - Frank Wille for having created PhxAss, a  wonderful  assembler! ;)  and
   for his bug-reports.

 - Alessio Cappelli for his support and his bug reports.

 - Pietro Altomani for helping me with the E.generator.

I'd like also the SysOps of the BBSs that @{"suppport" link updates} IEditor.

...someone would like to write another catalog? ;)
@ENDNODE

@NODE notes "Notes"

If someone wants to translate this manual into her/his language permission
is hereby granted.  The only thing I ask is that you send me a copy of the
translation  so  that  I  can  distribute  it with the next release of the
program.

Also,  write  me  if  you would like to create a new catalog for IE:  I'll
send  you  the  needed  files (if those in the distribution archive aren't
updated).


NOTE FOR NON ENGLISH USERS: if  you  want  to  see  IEditor  localised  in
English,  put  the  English  catalog in the _English_ subdirectory of your
LOCALE: assign (or leave it where the Installer script has put  it).  Then
open  the  Locale  preferences  editor  and  add  English  to  the list of
preferred languages. I tell you that, because I've heard of  people  doing
strange  things  to  get it to work, like changing the "English" string in
the catalog file into the name of the only language selected in the locale
editor... ;-)


When  submitting  a bug-report or suggestions, please tell me what version
of  IEditor  you  are  using.   This can be established by typing "Version
IEditor" in the shell.

>This is a program for programmers.   A lot of things in the manual  might

>this  because I like to see you throwing your money  away but it's almost
>impossible  to program the Amiga without good documentation.

Never  make  changes to the source that IEditor generates.  You should not
do  this  because  each  time  you re-generate the source you have to make
these  changes  again.   You  should  always  code  your  program specific
routines  and  stuff  in  one  or more seperate modules.  This way you can
always  add things to your GUI using IEditor without having the trouble of
adding other things to the IEditor generated source over and over again.


To install a new external module, you'll need just to copy it in the right
dir (Loaders, Generators or Expanders). IE will use it automagically.

@NODE boolean "Boolean Gadgets"

Boolean gadgets are the most common pre-kick 2.0 gadgets.  They're handled
by  intuition.library,  not  by  GadTools.library, so they haven't got any
tags  and  you can't use the GT_SetGadgetAttrsA() function with them.  You
could want to use them if you want a button gadget with some features that
the gadtools Button Kind doesn't have, e.g. @{"images" link "imgbank"}, toggle-select mode...

NOTE WELL:  in your sources, make sure you don't use the xxxGadget symbols
            as a  pointer  to  a  boolean  gadget,  beacuse  it  represent
            the Gadget structure!

Example: this piece of code would be wrong:

     [...]
     move.l  BooleanGadget,a0
     jsr     _LVOOnGadget(a6)
     [...]

You should write:

     [...]
     lea     BooleanGadget,a0
     jsr     _LVOOnGadget(a6)
     [...]

or in C:

     OnGadget( &BooleanGadget, .... );

Moreover,   there   aren't  pointers  to  gadgets  of  this  kind  in  the
<wnd>Gadgets array.


These are the gadgets you'll find in the Boolean Gadgets requester:

    - Label             the gadget label

    - Text              the text of the gadget. It will be used only if
                        the checkbox is checked.

    - X, Y              the coordinates of the text,  relative  to  the
                        upper-left corner of the gadget.

    - INVERSVID         if checked,  the text will be printed inversed.

    - Draw Mode         JAM1        the text will be printed  with  the

@NODE makegbank "Windows/Gadget bank/Create..."

This function lets you group all  the @{"selected" link selection}  gadgets  into  a  "gadget
bank".

See the @{"Parameters" link editgbank} section for a description of the requester  that  will
pop up after creating a bank.

With "gadget bank" I mean a group of gadget which can be  easily  attached
or detached from the window in which they are placed.

The main purpose for which I have inserted this feature in IEditor, is  to
create  requesters like the preferences one of GoldEd or to the multi-page
notebook requesters tipical of Word or Excel (aargh! ;-).
@ENDNODE

@NODE delgbank "Windows/Gadget bank/Delete..."

Selecting this item, a requester with the list of the gadget banks present
in  the  window  you're editing will pop up. Then, choose a gadget bank to
delete it: note that also all the gadgets that formed  the  bank  will  be
discarded.

The "(---)" label means  "No  bank":  you  can  choose  it  to  abort  the
operation.
@ENDNODE

It can be very useful to "clear" the window in order to be able to  design
easily another gadget bank in the same place.

The "(---)" label means  "No  bank":  you  can  choose  it  to  abort  the
operation.
@ENDNODE

@NODE editgbank "Windows/Gadget bank/Parameters..."

Selecting this item, a requester with the list of the gadget banks present

@NODE menued "Menu Editor"

The Menu Editor is... err... an editor for menus! ;-)

It  lets  you build a menu with a couple of mouse click...  In its window,
there are these gadgets:

    Title           This lists shows the Menu Titles present in you menu.

    Item            This shows the Menus Items...

    Sub             ...do you want me to say it? ;)

Below these gadgets, there are these buttons:

    /\              ehm.. more or less... This moves up the selected node.

    \/              This moves down the selected node.

    New             Adds a new node.

    Delete          Delete the selected node.

    Mutual Exclude  This lets you specify the items/subs that must be
                    excluded when the selected one is activated.

Finally, there are this two gadgets:

    Test            Create the menu as you've built it and attach it to
                    the Menu Editor window, so you can check how it look
                    like...

    Ok              Closes the Menu Editor; it has the same function as
                    the window close gadget.


To  edit  an item, you must double click on it.  Then the requester you've
see when you've created that item will pop up.

In this requester there are these gadgets:

    Text            The text of the menu title/item/sub...

    Image           This will open a list of the available @{"images" link imgbank}: select
                    one of them if you want to create a MENU_IMAGE item
                    or sub. (---) means no image.

    BarLabel        Set this if you want a barlabel... ;)

    Disabled        If set, the menu will appear disabled.

    CheckIt         Set if you want this item to be checkable.

    Checked         If set and CheckIt is set, the item will appear checked.

    MenuToggle      The menu will be toggle between checked/not checked when
                    selected.


In the Mutual Exclude requester there are these gadgets:

    Ignore          The items of this list won't be changed.

    Exclude         The items of this list will be excluded by the one you
                    selected before.

    « and »         These two gadgets move all the item of a list to
                    the other one.

    < and >         These two gadgets move the selected item from a list to
                    the other one.

@NODE arexxed "ARexx Interface Editor"

The ARexx Interface Editor  lets  you  add  an  ARexx  Interface  to  your
programs in a very easy way.

Once selected this item, IE will open the Editor: in  that  window  you'll
see a listview, two buttons and two string gadgets:

  - Commands                   This is a list of the ARexx commands you've
                               entered.  A  double  click  on  a  selected
                               command will open a small window  in  which
                               you  can  change  the  command  label,  the
                               command name and its template.
                               As to the style, I advise you to write both
                               the command and the template in uppercase.

  - New                        Adds a command.

  - Delete                     Remove a command.

  - ARexx Port                 Basename of your project's  port.  IE  will
                               add '.1' to it.

  - Ext.                       Default  extension   for   your   project's
                               scripts.
                               This is used when parsing  a  script:  when
                               IE receive a  msg  from  RexxMast  with  an
                               unknown command, it'll try to execute it as
                               a script. Let's look at this example:

                               address 'MYPROJECT.0'

                               'CMD1'  /*  this command is known and
                                           executed */

                               script2
                               /* this is an unknown command: so IE will
                                  send a msg to RexxMast telling it that
                                  IE doesn't know it. RexxMast looks  if
                                  it's  an   internal    Rexx   command,
                                  otherwise   will  look  for  a  script
                                  called  'script2'   or  'scritp2.ext',
                                  where  ext  is  the  extension  you've
                                  entered  in  the  string  gadget.  The
                                  default extension is 'rexx'. */

                               See  your    ARexx    manual    for    more
                               informations.

@NODE mained "Misc/main()..."

This will open the main editor.

In the upper part of this editor, you'll find two listview: the one in the
left  shows the libraries that the main() procedure will open for you; the
one in the right shows a list of libraries: if you double click on one  of
them,  it  will  be  copied  in the other list. If you want to modify some
parameters of a library in the left list, you can double click on it: then
you  can  change  the library name, its base name, its versione number and
you can decide if your program should fail or not if it  couldn't  open  a
library.

If you want to open a library that isn't present  in  the  list,  you  can
click on the "Add" button.


In this requester there's another listview, called  "OpenxxxWindow()":  it
shows  the  window(s)  you  wanted  the  main  proc to open for you. These
windows will be also closed by the main module when the programs quit.


Finally, there are also these gadgets:

   - CTRL C             if checked, your program will quit when it
                        receives a CTRL C signal.

   - Extra Signals      if  checked,   when   the  main  procedure
                        receives a signal it  doesn't  know,  will
                        call   an    external    function   called
                        HandleOtherSignal.

   - Workbench          if checked, you will be able to start your
                        program from Workbench.

   - ExtraProc          insert here the name  of  a  procedure  to
                        call before starting the Wait() loop.

@NODE taborder "Gadgets/TabCycle order..."

This  function  is  very  useful  to  set  the right order of the TabCycle
feature:  that's  to  say,  it  lets you decide in which order @{"string" link string} and
@{"integer" link integer} gadgets  should  be  activated  when  the  user  presses  TAB  or
SHIFT-TAB.

Selecting  this menu item, IE will open a window which contains a listview
and  four  gadgets:  in  the  listview  you'll see the @{"string" link string} and @{"integer" link integer}
gadgets  of  the  window you're editing; the four gadgets let you move the
gadgets up or down the list.
@ENDNODE

@NODE srcparams "Project/Parameters..."

This will open a requester in which you can set some parameters related to
the creation of the source.

These params are:

    - Generate Scr           if checked, IE will generate the code for the
                             screen too.

    - Font Adaptive          if checked, the code generated will  be  font
                             @{"adaptive" link fontadaptive}.

    - OpenDiskFonts          if checked IE will generate the OpenDiskFonts
                             and CloseDiskFonts @{"routines" link source}.

    - main()                 if checked IE will  generate  a  file  called
                             <Project Name>Main.[c|s]   with    a  @{"main()" link mained}
                             routine.

    - Shared IDCMP Port      if  checked,    IE    will    generate   the
                             HandleIDCMPPort()  procedure,    needed   to
                             handle    the    windows    that    have   a
                             @{"shared IDCMP port" link sharedport}.
                             Moreover, if the string gadget next to  this
                             checkbox is left  blank,  the  SetupScreen()
                             procedure will create a message port  called
                             IDCMPPort. Otherwise the GUI  will  use  the
                             port which you inserted there.
@ENDNODE

@NODE sharedport "Shared IDCMP Port"

IE can generate a source code in which more than one window use  the  same
IDCMP port.

That can be useful for several reasong, among which  these  are  the  most
important:

- all the windows can be used at  the  same  time (like  the  DriPens  and
  Screen Tags requesters in IEditor)

- your GUI will require less memory

- you save some signals bit (a task can't have more than  16  signals:  in
  fact IEditor uses a shared port in  the  editing  windows  and  in  some
  requesters; therefore you can open as many windows as you like)


In order to handle the shared port, the C.generator uses this method:

- the HandleIDCMPPort() function is similar to the  Handle<Wnd>IDCMP()
  ones: it just handles more than one window.

- when a message arrives at the IDCMP port, HandleIDCMPPort() copy its
  content in the IDCMPMsg structure and  then  it  calls  the  routine
  which is pointed by the ExtData field of the windows from where  the
  message came.


Here's an example to explain better how to use it:


BOOL  running = TRUE;

void main( void )
{
    /*  insert here the initialization stuff... ;-)  */

    OpenMainWindow();   /* since this is just an example I don't do */
    OpenToolsWindow();  /* any check on return codes.  Instead, you */
                        /* MUST always check the return codes!      */

    MainWnd->ExtData = HandleMain;
    MainWnd->ExtData = HandleToolsIDCMP;

    /*  Main Loop  */

    while( running ) {

        WaitPort( IDCMPPort );

        HandleIDCMPPort();
    }

    CloseToolsWindow();
    CloseMainWindow();
}

void HandleMain( void )
{
    if(!( HandleMainIDCMP() ))
        running = FALSE;
}


...wasn't it too much hard, is it? ;-)
