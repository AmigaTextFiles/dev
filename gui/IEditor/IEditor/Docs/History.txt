                 order  to make them utilizable with variable font height
                 (a little step toward font sensitive coding ;).
                 Added a requester in the Windows/Discard routine.
                
   2.04 12/6/95  Removed some Enforcer hits.
                 Fixed a bug in the Save GUI routine.

                 Added an IDCMP Handler in the Asm code generator.
                 Opening  some  requester  (e.g.   the req for the Window
                 Title)  and  then closing it, the window below it wasn't
                 refreshed.  Fixed.
                 It  crashed  on  68000's when the screen was updated and
                 there were no windows opened.  Fixed.
                 The  guide  was  quite  unreadable under AmigaGuide v40.
                 Fixed.
                 I've  started  to  redraw  all  the  GUI  of IE, with IE
                 itself.
                 Bumped the version of IE data files.

                 Corrected the Default Tool of the Italian guide.
                 Gadgets copy function added.
                
   2.01  2/6/95  It  crashed  when  pressing  the  return  key  on string
                 gadgets and integer gadgets. Fixed.
                 The Amiga E Source Generator didn't create windows label.
                 Fixed.
                 Minor bugs fixed.

   2.00 31/5/95  Second release, half an year later.
                 Totally rewritten from scratch in Asm.  Much more useful
                 but there were still many bugs.

   1.00 27/12/94 First  release.  It  was  coded in Amiga E and it wasn't
                 very good at all... :(
