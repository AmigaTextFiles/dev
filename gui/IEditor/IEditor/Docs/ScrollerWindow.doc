==========================================================================


Installation
------------

Just copy the files "ScrollerWindow.iex" and "ScrollerWindow.desc" in  the
"Expanders" subdirectory of InterfaceEditor program's dir.

You could need to change a couple of lines in "ScrollerWindow.desc" if you
don't use the DICE compiler.


Purpose
-------

ScrollerWindow.iex lets you make a powerful  and  very  adaptive  scroller
window:  i.e.  a window in which you should show and scroll a bitmap, like
Multiview does when viewing a picture on the Workbench.


How to use
----------

Open IEditor and create a new window.  Then  select  "Gadgets/Add..."  and
choose "SCROLLER WINDOW": you'll see that the window will change its look,
becoming a little ugly... Well, just close the window and reopen it,  then
it  will  look better... ;-) It's not my fault, but border gadgets need to
be attached to the window before opening it...  Anyway, it's just a matter
of look.

This IEX will automagically set some window flags and IDCMP that  it  need
to work properly.

Up to now, it supports only window with  menus:  you  can't  add  gadgets,
images, bevel box... etc...

...actually, you could modify a bit the expander to implement some missing
parts... ;-)


In your application, you can open a scroller window just like every  other
window, but *before* opening it, you MUST perform some actions:

1. You must put a valid bitmap pointer in the <Window Label>BitMap
   variable. This will be the bitmap to show in the window.

2. You must set the variables called <Window Label>HTotal, <>VTotal
   with the size of the bitmap.

3. You must set the variables called <Window Label>VVisible, <>HVisible
   with the right values.

See the source "ScrollerWindow.c" for a real-life example.


The scrolling of the bitmap it's  completely  done  by  the  code  of  the
expander.
