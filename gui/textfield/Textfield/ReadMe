Well, 3.1 was supposed to be out much faster than it actually has
now arrived.  I certainly expected to have 4.0 out by now.  The
reason for the delay is that there have been major changes taking
place in my life.  I should be back on track now.

There maybe a possibility that 4.0 won't be free.  In fact, 4.0
may not even be 4.0.  It may be a complete new product.  Be
prepared.

Please remember to send me any comments or bug reports.
