     This is a new port of Figlet to the Amiga. 
     This version allows redirection. To show off
     what this means, use this MUInt program to 
     write examples of Figlet texts using any of
     the included Figlet Fonts. You can send the
     text to your text editor and from there save
     the file to disk. 

     Figlet expects to find the Figlet Fonts in
     LIBS:filgletfonts. Move the directory yourself
     or have the program do it for you. Be sure to
     COPY Figlet into the path.

     Usage: figlet [-flags] [font] >outfile 
     Or:    figlet [-flags] [font] >outfile <infile

     The following is from Ian Chai, administrator 
     the Figlet program:

The "official" ftp site for Figlet is:
     ftp.nicoh.com:pub/figlet

The Figlet WWW page
        http://math.uiuc.edu:80/~chappell/figlet/
lists some other sites.

There is also FIGLET-L, a mailing list for both updates
and discussions about figlet. If you want to be notified
of updates to the Figlet software, email
     LISTSERV@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu
with the body of the email saying
     subscribe figlet-l your full name
     set figlet-l topics=SOFTWARE
where "your full name" should be your full name.

If you want to know about new fonts, then it should say
     subscribe figlet-l your full name
     set figlet-l topics=SOFTWARE,FONTS

If you want to be in on everything, including discussions,
     subscribe figlet-l your full name
will do the trick.

Remember not to post any discussions under SOFTWARE or FONTS.
In fact,you should never post under SOFTWARE -- it is for 
"official" releases. You can post any new nifty software you 
write for figlet on the normal discussion, and if I decide 
to put it in the "official" distribution, I'll post a notice
to SOFTWARE and make it available for ftp.

Ian Chai
