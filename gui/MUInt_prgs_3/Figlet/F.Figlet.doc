About Figlet:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a new port of Figlet for the Amiga. The original source
code was not modified in any way. The source was simply re-compiled
to give the ability to redirect the output from stdout to a file.

The default font directory is libs:figletfonts. Establish this 
directory and copy your fonts into it.

Place figlet in the path. 

About the GUI:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MUI is required, as well as several executables located in the 
directory. Keep all of these files together. To start the GUI, 
enter EXECUTE Figlet.def.

This will define the GUI and call MUInt to display it.

You will be asked what your text editor is. The path/name will
be recorded in sys:prefs/env-archive. You will only have to 
enter you editor's name once.

If you have not placed your fonts in libs:figletfonts, you will
be asked if you want this done for you. If you don't, the program
will look for the fonts in /fonts.

Enter the text you want displayed in Figlet format in the string 
gadget. To see the text, press the DISPLAY button. To send the 
text to your editor, press the SEND TO EDITOR button.

FIGLET(6)                                               FIGLET(6)


NAME
       figlet  -  print  in  large characters made up of ordinary
       screen characters


SYNOPSIS
       figlet [ -clnprtvxDELNRX ] [ -d fontdirectory ]
              [ -f fontfile ] [ -m smushmode ] [ -w outputwidth ]
              [ -C controlfile ] [ -I infocode ]


DESCRIPTION
       figlet  prints its input using large characters made up of
       ordinary screen characters.  figlet  output  is  generally
       reminiscent of the sort of ``signatures'' many people like
       to put at the end of e-mail and UseNet  messages.   It  is
       also  reminiscent  of  the output of some banner programs,
       although it is oriented normally, not sideways.

       figlet can print in a variety of fonts, both left-to-right
       and  right-to-left,  with  adjacent  characters kerned and
       ``smushed'' together in various ways.   figlet  fonts  are
       stored  in  separate files, which can be identified by the
       suffix ``.flf''.  Most figlet font files will be stored in
       figlet's default font directory.

       figlet  can  also  use ``control files'', which tell it to
       map certain input characters to certain other  characters,
       similar  to  the  Unix  tr  command.  Control files can be
       identified by the suffix ``.flc''.   Most  figlet  control
       files will be stored in figlet's default font directory.


OTHER FONTS & MAILING LIST
       As of this writing you can get many fonts which are not in
       the  basic  figlet   package   by   anonymous   FTP   from
       ftp.isu.edu:pub/figlet/fonts.       ftp.isu.edu:pub/figlet
       should also contain the latest version of figlet and other
       utilities related to figlet.  Of special interest are non-
       Roman fonts.  As of this writing,  there  are  Hebrew  and
       Cyrillic (Russian) fonts; more are expected.

       We  run  an  e-mail  list dedicated to figlet software and
       font announcements, as well as  general  discussion  about
       figlet.  If you would like to be on this list, send e-mail
       to listserv@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu with the message body

              subscribe figlet-l YOUR NAME

       where YOUR NAME should be replaced with  your  name.   For
       those  who don't want to be bothered with the discussions,
       the list can be configured so that you only  see  software
       update notices, or only software and font announcements.

USAGE
       Just start up figlet (type ``figlet'') and then type what-
       ever you want.  Alternatively, pipe a file or  the  output
       of another command through figlet.  See EXAMPLES for other
       things to do.


OPTIONS
       figlet reads command line options from left to right,  and
       only  the  last  option  that  affects a parameter has any
       effect.  Every option has an inverse, so that,  for  exam-
       ple, if figlet is customized with a C-shell alias, all the
       options are still available.

       Commonly-used options are -f, -c, -m0, -t, -p and -v.


       -f fontfile
              Select the font.  The .flf suffix may be  left  off
              of  fontfile,  in  which  case figlet automatically
              appends it.  figlet looks for the file first in the
              default  font  directory  and  then  in the current
              directory, or, if fontfile  was  given  as  a  full
              pathname, in the given directory.  If the -f option
              is not specified, figlet uses  the  font  that  was
              specified  when it was compiled.  To find out which
              font this is, use the -I3 option.


       -d fontdirectory
              Change the default font  directory.   figlet  looks
              for  fonts  first in the default directory and then
              in the current directory.  If the -d option is  not
              specified, figlet uses the directory that was spec-
              ified when it was  compiled.   To  find  out  which
              directory this is, use the -I2 option.


       -c
       -l
       -r
       -x     These  options  handle  the justification of figlet
              output.  -c centers the  output  horizontally.   -l
              makes  the  output  flush-left.  -r makes it flush-
              right.  -x (default) sets the justification accord-
              ing  to whether left-to-right or right-to-left text
              is selected.  Left-to-right  text  will  be  flush-
              left, while right-to-left text will be flush-right.
              (Left-to-right versus right-to-left  text  is  con-
              trolled by -L, -R and -X.)


       -t
       -w outputwidth
              These  options  control  the  outputwidth,  or  the
              screen width figlet  assumes  when  formatting  its
              output.   figlet  uses the outputwidth to determine
              when to break lines and how to center  the  output.
              Normally,  figlet assumes 80 columns so that people
              with wide terminals won't annoy the people they  e-
              mail  figlet output to.  -t sets the outputwidth to
              the terminal width.  If the terminal  width  cannot
              be   determined,   the   previous   outputwidth  is
              retained.  -w sets the  outputwidth  to  the  given
              integer.   An  outputwidth  of 1 is a special value
              that tells figlet to print each  non-space  charac-
              ter, in its entirety, on a separate line, no matter
              how wide it is.


       -p
       -n     These options control how figlet handles  newlines.
              -p puts figlet into ``paragraph mode'', which elim-
              inates some unnecessary line breaks when  piping  a
              multi-line file through figlet.  In paragraph mode,
              figlet treats line breaks within a paragraph as  if
              they  were  merely blanks between words.  (Specifi-
              cally, -p causes  figlet  to  convert  any  newline
              which is not preceded by a newline and not followed
              by a space character into a blank.)  -n puts figlet
              back  to  normal  (default), in which every newline
              figlet reads causes it to produce a line break.


       -D
       -E     -D switches to the German (Deutsch) character  set.
              Turns  `[',  `\'  and `]' into umlauted A, O and U,
              respectively.  `{',  `|'  and  `}'  turn  into  the
              respective lower case versions of these.  `~' turns
              into s-z.  (Of course, all this  assumes  the  font
              author  has placed German characters in these posi-
              tions in the font file.  Many font authors do not.)
              -E  switches  back  to English (default), i.e., the
              standard ASCII character set.


       -C controlfile
       -N     These options deal  with  figlet  controlfiles.   A
              controlfile is a file containing a list of commands
              that figlet executes each time it reads  a  charac-
              ter.   These commands can map certain input charac-
              ters to other characters, similar to  the  Unix  tr
              command  or the figlet -D option.  figlet maintains
              a list of controlfiles, which is empty when  figlet
              starts  up.   -C  adds the given controlfile to the
              list.  -N clears the controlfile  list,  cancelling
              the effect of any previous -C.  figlet executes the
              commands in all controlfiles in the list.  See CON-
              TROLFILE  FORMAT for details on how to write a con-
              trolfile.


       -m smushmode
              Specifies how figlet should ``smush'' and kern con-
              secutive characters together.  On the command line,
              -m0 can be useful, as it tells figlet to kern char-
              acters  without smushing them together.  Otherwise,
              this option is rarely needed, as a figlet font file
              specifies  the best smushmode to use with the font.
              -m is, therefore, most  useful  to  font  designers
              testing  the  various  smushmodes  with their font.
              smushmode can be -2 through 63.

              -2 Get mode from font file (default).
                     Every figlet font file  specifies  the  best
                     smushmode  to  use with the font.  This will
                     be one of the  smushmodes  (-1  through  63)
                     described in the following paragraphs.

              -1 No smushing or kerning.
                     Characters are simply concatenated together.

              0 Kern only.
                     Characters are pushed  together  until  they
                     touch.

                     In  any  non-negative smushmode figlet kerns
                     adjacent font characters,  i.e.,  it  pushes
                     adjacent   font  characters  together  until
                     their non-blank  portions  touch.   At  that
                     point,  it  may or may not push the two font
                     characters  1   screen   character   closer,
                     depending  on  the  smushmode.  Pushing font
                     characters one step closer requires ``smush-
                     ing'' two non-blank screen characters into a
                     single screen character.  figlet has 6  ways
                     of doing this, represented by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
                     and 32.  The various non-negative smushmodes
                     (0-63) are obtained by adding up the numbers
                     corresponding to the sort of smushing figlet
                     should  do.  In particular smushmode 0 kerns
                     characters without smushing them  into  each
                     other.

              1 Smush equal characters.
                     Two  screen  characters  are  smushed into a
                     single character if they are the same.   The
                     resulting  character  is the same as both of
                     the original characters.  This mode does not
                     smush  the  character  known as a hardblank,
                     which is a character that prints as a blank,
                     but is not smushed (except in mode 32).  See
                     FONT FILE FORMAT  for  more  information  on
                     hardblanks.

              2 Smush underscores.
                     An  underscore  will  be  smushed  into (and
                     replaced by) any of ``|/\[]{}()<>''.

              4 Hierarchy smushing.
                     Smushes certain characters together  accord-
                     ing  to  a  hierarchy  containing 6 classes:
                     ``|'',  ``/\'',  ``[]'',   ``{}'',   ``()'',
                     ``<>''.   A  member  of  any  class  can  be
                     smushed into and replaced by a member of any
                     later class.

              8 Opposite pair smushing, type I.
                     Smushes  opposing  brackets (``[]''), braces
                     (``{}'') and parentheses (``()'')  together,
                     replacing them with a vertical bar (`|').

              16 Opposite pair smushing, type II.
                     Smushes   opposing   slashes   (``/\'')  and
                     greater-than/less-than  (``><'')   together,
                     replacing   them  with  an  upper-case  `X'.
                     ``><'' are only smushed together  when  they
                     are  in that order, i.e., ``<>'' will not be
                     smushed.

              32 Hardblank smushing.
                     Smushes two hardblanks  together,  replacing
                     them with a single hardblank.  See FONT FILE
                     FORMAT for more information on hardblanks.


       -v
       -I infocode
              These  options  print  various  information   about
              figlet, then exit.  If several of these options are
              given on the command line, only the  last  is  exe-
              cuted,   and  only  after  all  other  command-line
              options have been dealt with.

              -v prints version  and  copyright  information,  as
              well  as  a  ``Usage:  ...''   line.  -I prints the
              information corresponding to the given infocode  in
              a  consistent, reliable (i.e., guaranteed to be the
              same in future releases) format.  -I  is  primarily
              intended  to  be  used by programs that use figlet.
              infocode can be any of the following.

              -1 Normal operation (default).
                     This infocode indicates that  figlet  should
                     operate    normally,    not    giving    any
                     informational printout, printing  its  input
                     in the selected font.

              0 Version and copyright.
                     This is identical to -v.

              1 Version (integer).
                     This  will print the version of your copy of
                     figlet as a decimal integer.  The main  ver-
                     sion number is multiplied by 10000, the sub-
                     version number is multiplied by 100, and the
                     sub-sub-version  number  is multiplied by 1.
                     These are added together, and the result  is
                     printed  out.   For example, figlet 2.1 will
                     print ``20100''.  If there is ever a version
                     2.1.1,  it will print ``20101''.  Similarly,
                     version 3.7.2 would print ``30702''.   These
                     numbers are guaranteed to be ascending, with
                     later versions having higher numbers.   Note
                     that the first major release of figlet, ver-
                     sion 2.0, did not have the -I option.

              2 Default font directory.
                     This will print the default font  directory.
                     It is affected by the -d option.

              3 Font.
                     This  will print the name of the font figlet
                     would use.  It is affected by the -f option.
                     This  is not a filename; the ``.flf'' suffix
                     is not printed.

              4 Output width.
                     This will print the value figlet  would  use
                     for  outputwidth, the number of columns wide
                     figlet  assumes  the  screen  is.    It   is
                     affected by the -w and -t options.

              If  infocode  is  any  other positive value, figlet
              will simply exit without printing anything.


       -L
       -R
       -X     These options control whether figlet  prints  left-
              to-right  or  right-to-left.   -L  selects left-to-
              right printing.  -R selects right-to-left printing.
              -X  (default)  makes figlet use whichever is speci-
              fied in the font file.


EXAMPLES
       To use figlet with its default settings, simply type

              example% figlet

       and then type whatever you like.

       To change the font, use the -f option, for example,

              example% figlet -f script


       Use the -c option if you would prefer centered output:

              example% figlet -c


       We have found that the most common use of figlet is making
       up  large  text to be placed in e-mail messages.  For this
       reason, figlet defaults to 80 column output.  If  you  are
       using  a  wider terminal, and would like figlet to use the
       full width of your terminal, use the -t option:

              example% figlet -t


       If you don't want figlet to  smush  font  characters  into
       each other, use the -m0 option:

              example% figlet -m0


       If  figlet  gets its input from a file, it is often a good
       idea to use -p:

              example% figlet -p < myfile


       Of course, the above can be combined:

              example% figlet -ptm0 -f shadow < anotherfile
              example% figlet -cf slant



   Other Things to Try
       On many systems nice effects can be obtained from the lean
       font  by piping it through tr.  Some you might want to try
       are the following:

              example% figlet -f lean | tr ' _/' ' ()'
              example% figlet -f lean | tr ' _/' './\\'
              example% figlet -f lean | tr ' _/' ' //'
              example% figlet -f lean | tr ' _/' '/  '

       Similar things can be done with the block font and many of
       the other figlet fonts.


FONT FILE FORMAT
       If  you  would like to design a figlet font, it is usually
       best to begin with an already-existing font.   Except  for
       the  first  line  of  a font file, most of the file format
       should be obvious.  If you design a font,  please  let  us
       know about it!  (See AUTHORS for e-mail addresses.)

       A figlet font filename must have the suffix ``.flf''.

       A  figlet font file begins with a header.  The header con-
       sists of one line giving information about the font,  fol-
       lowed by zero or more comment lines, which figlet ignores.
       Following the header is the font data.


   The Header
       The first line of a figlet font file is of  the  following
       form:

              flf2ahardblank height up_ht maxlen smushmode cmt_count rtol

       where  hardblank  is a character, and the remaining values
       are integers, for example:

              flf2a$ 6 5 20 15 3 0

       The last value, rtol, may be omitted, in which case it  is
       assumed to be 0.

              flf2a$ 6 5 20 15 3


       For  those  desiring  a  quick explanation, the above line
       indicates that this font has characters which are 6  lines
       tall,  5  of  which are above the baseline, no line in the
       font data is more than 20  characters  long,  the  default
       smushmode  is  15  (kern and smush in various ways), there
       are 3 comment lines, and this font is to be printed  left-
       to-right.  More in-depth explanations follow.

       The  first  five  characters  of  a  font  file  should be
       ``flf2a''.  ``flf2'' is the magic number  of  a  figlet  2
       font file.  The next character (`a') is currently ignored.
       It may mean something in future versions of figlet.  If it
       does,  you  can be sure your fonts will still work if this
       character is `a'.

       Immediately following this is the  hardblank  (character).
       Note  that  there  are no blanks between ``flf2a'' and the
       hardblank.  figlet can smush together consecutive  charac-
       ters  in  various  ways.   Normally,  any character can be
       smushed into a blank.  A hardblank prints as a blank,  but
       cannot  be smushed into any character except a blank, and,
       if smushmode  32  is  enabled,  another  hardblank.   (For
       example,  the  `r' in script.flf contains a hardblank, `$'
       in that font.  To see why this is necessary, create a copy
       of script.flf with this hardblank replaced by a blank.  In
       this new font, the ``tr'' combination looks awful.)

       By convention, the hardblank is a `$', but it can  be  any
       character  besides  blank,  newline and null.  If you want
       the entire printing ASCII set available to use,  make  the
       hardblank a <delete> character.

       Then  comes  the  height (integer).  This is the number of
       screen lines high that each character in the font is.

       up_ht (integer) is the number of lines from  the  baseline
       of  a  character  to the top of the character, i.e., it is
       the height of a character, ignoring any descenders.   This
       number is currently ignored by figlet, but future versions
       may use it.

       maxlen (integer) is the maximum length of a  line  in  the
       font  file  (excluding  the  first  line  and the comments
       lines, which can be as long as you want).  You may want to
       make this a little too large as a safety measure.

       smushmode (integer) determines how much figlet smushes the
       font.  Possible smushmodes are -1 through 63.   Typically,
       you'll  want to use 0 (kern font characters without smush-
       ing them together), -1 (no  kerning  or  smushing)  or  15
       (smush  various  pairs  of characters together into single
       characters).  To try out different  smushmodes  with  your
       font,  use  the -m command-line option.  See OPTIONS for a
       more detailed explanation of these smushmodes.  (Note that
       a  smushmode  of  -2 can be given on the command line, but
       not in a font file.)

       Between the first line and the actual  characters  of  the
       font  are the comment lines.  Cmt_count specifies how many
       lines there are.  These lines are optional, may be as long
       as you want, and are ignored by figlet.

       rtol  (integer)  tells  which  direction the font is to be
       printed.  0 means left-to-right,  and  1  means  right-to-
       left.    Left-to-right   text  is  printed  flush-left  by
       default, while right-to-left text is  printed  flush-right
       by  default.   rtol may be omitted, in which case 0 (left-
       to-right) is assumed.  Earlier versions of  figlet  (i.e.,
       version 2.0) ignore rtol.

       Thus,  a  complete figlet font file header will look some-
       thing like the following:

              flf2a$ 6 5 20 15 3
              Example by Glenn Chappell <ggc@uiuc.edu> 8/94
              Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
              modifier's name is placed on a comment line.


   The Font Data
       The font data begins on the next line after  the  comments
       and continues to the end of the file.  The characters from
       ` ' to `~' are given in standard ASCII order, followed  by
       the  extra German characters: umlauted `A', `O', `U', `a',
       `o' and `u' and s-z.  Following  these  are  the  optional
       code-tagged characters.  Each character uses height lines,
       where height was given on the first line of the font file.
       Each  code-tagged  character is preceeded by an extra line
       with the character's code (a number) on it.   The  charac-
       ters  in  the  file  are  given  exactly as they should be
       printed out, with two exceptions: (1) hardblanks should be
       the  hardblank  character, not a blank, and (2) every line
       has an endmark character.

       In most figlet fonts, the endmark is either  `@'  or  '#'.
       figlet  eliminates  the  last  block  of consecutive equal
       characters from each line (other than  the  header  lines)
       when the file is read in.  By convention, the last line of
       a font character has 2 endmarks, while all the  rest  have
       one.  This makes it easy to see where characters begin and
       end.  No line should have more than 2 endmarks.

       The code-tagged characters are optional, and  are  ignored
       by  earier  versions  of  figlet (i.e., version 2.0).  The
       code-tagged characters begin just after the German charac-
       ters.   There  can  be  as  many or as few of these as you
       like.  The first line of a  code-tagged  character  has  a
       single  number  on  it, the character's code, which is the
       number by which figlet will refer to it.  This number  can
       be  in  decimal,  octal or hexadecimal, using the standard
       scanf conventions for such numbers.  On the next line  the
       character  itself  begins,  in  the same format as the un-
       tagged characters.

       If two or more font characters have the same tag, the last
       one  in  the  font is the one used.  For this purpose, the
       normal ASCII characters are considered to have tags  equal
       to  their  ASCII  value,  while  the German characters are
       given tags -255 through -249.

       There is no required encoding for the code-tagged  charac-
       ters.   figlet  simply prints the character with the given
       code when it is told to.  However, in most of  the  fonts,
       we have used ISO Latin-1 for characters 160-255, following
       a suggestion of Zhahai  Stewart.   Stewart  has  suggested
       using Unicode for other characters.

       The zero tag is treated specially.  It is figlet's ``miss-
       ing character''.  Whenever figlet is told to print a char-
       acter  which  doesn't  exist  in the current font, it will
       print character zero.  If character  zero  doesn't  exist,
       nothing will be printed.


   Notes
       It  is  very  important that every character in a font has
       the same height, and, once the endmarks are removed,  that
       all  the  lines  constituting a single font character have
       the same length.  Be careful also that  no  lines  in  the
       font  file have trailing blanks, as figlet will take these
       to be the endmarks.  Many problems like these can be found
       easily using chkfont, part of the standard figlet package,
       and also available, as of this writing, by  anonymous  FTP
       from ftp.isu.edu:pub/figlet/util.

       If  you  don't want to define all the characters, make the
       undefined characters empty, i.e., each line of the charac-
       ter should consist only of one or two endmarks.

       The  blank  character  should  usually be made entirely of
       hardblanks.  (Most  slanted  fonts  are  an  exception  to
       this.)

       If  you  design a font, it is helpful if you put your name
       and an e-mail address on a  comment  line.   If  you  will
       allow  others  to modify your font, you may want to say so
       on a comment line.

       If a font contains a non-Roman alphabet  stored  in  loca-
       tions normally taken by ASCII, we have found it helpful to
       include a ``translation'' table as one of  the  characters
       of  the  font.   Typically, the ``~'' character contains a
       list of all the special characters in the font, along with
       the  ASCII  characters  they  correspond to.  It is a good
       idea to keep this table no  more  than  79  columns  wide.
       (Thanks to Gedaliah Friedenberg for this idea.)

       Again, if you design a font, please let us know!


CONTROLFILE FORMAT
       (Note: This section isn't terribly well-written.  I really
       don't have time right now to do much with it.  If you want
       to  write  a  controlfile, just look at the existing files
       and ignore the f command, and you'll  probably  do  pretty
       well.    Anyone   needing  extra  help  can  write  us  at
       <figlet@uiuc.edu>.  Also, anyone willing  to  revise  this
       section  or  the FONT FILE FORMAT section is welcome to do
       so.  Please let us know about your efforts if you give  it
       a try.  -GGC-)


       Controlfiles  are  files containing lists of commands that
       figlet  executes  each  time  it  reads  a  character.   A
       controlfile  is  specified  to figlet using the -C command
       line option (see OPTIONS).  In the file itself  the  first
       line  identifies the file as a figlet controlfile, and the
       remaining lines are the  commands,  one  per  line.   Cur-
       rently, the only recognized commands tell figlet to trans-
       late one character to another (similar to the Unix tr com-
       mand).  In future versions of figlet, more commands may be
       added.  As with font files, when writing a controlfile, it
       is usually best to begin with an existing file.

       The  filename of a figlet controlfile must have the suffix
       ``.flc''.

       The first five  characters  of  a  controlfile  should  be
       ``flc2a''.   ``flc2'' is the magic number of a figlet con-
       trolfile.  The next character (`a') is currently  ignored.
       It may mean something in future versions of figlet.  If it
       does, you can be sure your files will still work  if  this
       character is `a'.

       Each of the following lines of the file consists of a one-
       character command followed by whatever parameters the com-
       mand  requires,  excepting blank lines, which are ignored.
       There are currently three recognized commands: #, t and f.


       # comment
              Any line beginning with # is ignored.


       t translate
              This is similar to the Unix tr command.  It directs
              figlet to ``translate'' one character  to  another.
              ``t''  is followed by one or more blanks, then by a
              character (or range of characters,  e.g.,  ``A-Z'')
              then one or more blanks, then another character (or
              range).

              For example,

                     t # $

              will convert `#' to `$', while

                     t A-Z a-z

              will convert upper-case ASCII to lower-case  ASCII.
              A  range should always be followed by another range
              of the same size.

              A number of backslash (`\') options  are  available
              for  specifying  characters.   Any  of the standard
              ``C'' language backslash-character conventions  are
              legal,   e.g.,  ``\n''  for  newline,  etc.   Also,
              backslash-blank can be  used  to  specify  a  blank
              character.   Backslash  followed by a number in any
              of the standard scanf formats  (decimal,  octal  or
              hexadecimal) specifies the character with the given
              code.  For example,

                     t \n-\  \65-W

              will convert all characters from newline  to  blank
              into  the  corresponding characters from `A' to `W'
              (`A' has code 65).

              If a number of consecutive t  commands  are  given,
              then  for  each  character  input,  only  the first
              applicable command, if any, will be executed.  As a
              result,

                     t A B
                     t B A

              will  swap  the  characters `A' and `B'.  If figlet
              reads an `A' the first command will change  `A'  to
              `B', in which case the second will not be executed.
              In the following list,

                     t A B
                     t A C

              the second command is never executed.  In short,  a
              sequence of t commands ``does what it ought to''.


       f freeze
              More  complex files, in which a single character is
              acted upon by several t commands,  can  be  set  up
              using  the  f  command.   f ``freezes'' the current
              character, executing the remaining commands in  the
              controlfile  as  if  they  were in a separate file.
              The f command has no parameters, and anything  fol-
              lowing  it  on the same line is ignored.  (Note: If
              you, along with so many others, cannot  figure  out
              what  the  f  command does, or why anyone would use
              it, feel free to ignore it.)  After figlet executes
              a  t command, it skips to the end of the file or to
              the next f command.  If any t commands follow,  the
              first  applicable one will be executed.  The result
              is that f  acts  as  a  ``freeze'',  executing  the
              remaining  commands  as  if they were in a separate
              file.
       file.flf            figlet font file


DIAGNOSTICS
       figlet's diagnostics are intended to be  self-explanatory.
       Possible messages are

              Usage: ...
              Out of memory
              Unable to open font file
              Not a figlet 2 font file
              Unable to open control file
              Not a figlet 2 control file
              "-t" is disabled, since ioctl is not fully implemented.

       This  last message is printed when the -t option is given,
       but the operating system in use does not include the  sys-
       tem call figlet uses to determine the terminal width.

       figlet also prints an explanatory message if the -F option
       is given on the command  line.   The  earlier  version  of
       figlet,  version  2.0, listed the available fonts when the
       -F option was given.  This option has  been  removed  from
       figlet  2.1.   It has been replaced by the figlist script,
       which is part of the standard figlet package.


ORIGIN
       ``figlet'' stands for ``Frank, Ian and Glenn's  LETters''.
       Inspired  by  Frank's  .sig, Glenn wrote (most of) it, and
       Ian helped.

       Most of the standard figlet fonts were inspired by  signa-
       tures  on  various  UseNet articles.  Since typically hun-
       dreds of people use the same style  of  letters  in  their
       signatures,  it  was  often  not  deemed necessary to give
       credit to any one font designer.


BUGS
       Very little error checking is done  on  font  and  control
       files.   While figlet tries to be forgiving of errors, and
       should (hopefully) never actually crash, using an  improp-
       erly-formatted file with figlet will produce unpredictable
       output.

       figlet does not handle formatting  characters  in  a  very
       intelligent way.  A tab character is converted to a blank,
       and vertical-tab, form-feed and carriage-return  are  each
       converted to a newline.  On many systems, tabs can be han-
       dled better by piping files through expand  before  piping
       through figlet.

       figlet  output  is  quite  ugly  if  it  is displayed in a
       proportionally-spaced font.   I  suppose  this  is  to  be
       expected.
