                         a file splitting program


Yek is a program to split large files into smaller ones. Unlike the
standard UNIX Split, Yek is not limited to textfiles. With Yek you can
split any file into files of arbitrary size.



General usage

When you start Yek without arguments, just by typing

Yek <return>

it will respond with an overview of the arguments and switches it supports,
like this.

Usage: Yek [-v(erbose)] [-f <output filename>] [-b <buffersize>]
         [-l <output file length>] <file>

The <file> argument is the only argument you HAVE to specify to get Yek
working, the others are optional and have (in my humble opinion) sensible
default values. Now for a description of these arguments.


   -v    This is the verbose option. Specifying this option will
      cause Yek to print information about the amount of bytes
      it has read while it's working.

   -f After this option you should give the output filename.
      The files Yek produces will have the names <file>.000,
      <file>.001, etc. The default for this option is 'YekOut'.

   -b Specifying a larger buffersize will greatly increase
      operating speed on some computers (like the Amiga), on
      smaller systems it might be necessary to set it somewhat
      lower than the default 100,000.

   -l This is self explanatory. The output file length is the
      exact length the files produced by Yek will have (OK,
      I'll admit, the last file will be shorter in most cases).
      Default is 730,000 to make the files fit on a standard
      double density MSDOS floppy.


That's all there is to using Yek. Now to get the original file back you can
use the AmigaDos Join command, or, when on a UNIX system, cat. Undoubtedly
there's an MSDOS equivalent of these commands, too.



Example usage of Yek.

Suppose you happen to have a nice, long sample called Amazing.iff, which
you want to transfer to another computer using MSDOS floppies. 

 ------rw-d     Today   23:23  1691 1730375 Amazing.iff

Now type

Yek -v -f Amaze -b 500000 Amazing.iff <return>

and Yek is on it's way! It will inform you of the progress of the splitting
process by printing the number of bytes it just read.

500000 bytes read
500000 bytes read
500000 bytes read
230375 bytes read
Operation complete.

 ------rw-d     Today   23:26   714  730000 Amaze.000
 ------rw-d     Today   23:26   714  730000 Amaze.001
 ------rw-d     Today   23:26   266  270375 Amaze.002
 ------rw-d     Today   23:23  1691 1730375 Amazing.iff

Now you can get the old file back by typing

Join Amaze.000 Amaze.001 Amaze.002 to Amazing.iff    (on the Amiga)

or

cat Amaze.000 Amaze.001 Amaze.002 > Amazing.iff      (on UNIX systems)
