        YEK.DEF - A MUINT IMPLIMENTATION OF YEK

This program is a MUInt GUI for the popular filesplitter, Yek.
The original documentation for Yek can be read by clicking the
HELP button. Yek takes the file you select in the SOURCE file-
requester and splits it up into several smaller files in the
DESTINATION directory. You may select how large the split
files will be (in bytes), and how much RAM memory to allot for
the conversion process.

A Preferences program can be used to preset the directories and
the "Standard" outfile size you prefer.

Yek.def adds the ability to Join split files. Click the Join 
button and select the directory where the split files reside.
The split files will be reassembled back into that directory.

       Yek.def requires MUI and WB 2.04 and up.  

 THIS IS A BUGGY PROGRAM. JOIN DOESN'T WORK WELL. FIX ME?
