                    INDEXER

I wrote this to quickly scan the AmiNet INDEX for
CLI and DOS Script tools. The files displayed in
the ListView were generated by WANT.

You may find this list useful when looking for more
tools to write scripts with. Some of the CLI only
programs could be used as a basis for a MUInt GUI.

You may select some files you might want to download
and PRINT them for a ready reference.

(This program is a programming example and not meant
to be very useful by itself)
