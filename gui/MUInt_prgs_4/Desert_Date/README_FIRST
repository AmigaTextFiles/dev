 Desert_Date V1.1 is a GUI for the 'Date' program for setting the date of
 Amiga's that do not have a battery backed up clock. This program may be run
 from within a Startup-Sequence or Shell to set the system date and time. 
 The advantage of using Desert_Date is that it saves the date when set to a
 variable in ENVARC:. Desert_Date looks for this variable when called and if
 not found in your ENV: directory, it creates it. Simple really, But a must
 for owners of any Amiga that does not have a Battery backed up Clock.
 
 I could have made it more intelligent and done some additional time
 checking, But as for it's primary purpose, I didn't consider it necessary.
 
 Tested on a 500 and 1000
