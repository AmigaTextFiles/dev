Second (and hopefully final) release of a datatype for using .info files as
images.

Basically I fixed a couple of things. It no longer uses the palette.prefs
files for colours (at the time it made sense. Using the Workbench screen
makes more sense to me now).

Full history and other stuff in archive...
