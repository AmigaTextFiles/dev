               ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION FOR XTOILBM
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Short:    2416b picture converter. Any->IFF. Uses Datatypes
Author:   Christopher Naas (christon@powertech.no)
Type:     gfx/conv


XtoILBM  is  a 2416b picture converter, that uses datatypes to convert
ANY  pictureformat  you've  got a datatype for to IFF.  XtoILBM has no
fancy functions.  It's a CLI command, that takes two arguments, source
and dest.  E.g.

      XtoILBM Gif:Apollo.gif IFF:Apollo.256

XtoILBM will load the source image, and save the ILBM as the specified
destinationfile.

XtoILBM  is  especially  usefull  for  people who haven't got too much
spare  memory,  or  just  to  make  speedy conversions.  You could for
instance  make  a script that converts all the images in one directory
to IFF/ILBM, and use in a button in DOpus..

.key NAME,DESTPATH
.bra {
.ket }
XtoILBM {name} {destpath}{name}.IFF


XtoILBM  was  programmed in SAS/C 6.51, and tested on an A4000/040/14.
It should work on any Amiga with the datatypes.library installed.


If you like this program, please let me know.

             DOCUMENTATION FOR XTOILBM WITH MUInt
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  XtoILBM.def is a DOS script that defines and then displays a MUI 
  interface for Christopher Naas's program.

STARTING THE PROGRAM

 You can double click the icon or from the shell EXECUTE XtoILBM.def

REQUIREMENTS

     XtoILBM...................... (included)
     WB 3.0 and up................ (you should have this already :)
     MagicUserInterface (MUI)..... (not included)
     MUInt_dev_v1.lha............. (not included. Get it from AmiNet)

INTERFACE DESCRIPTION

  MUInt provides an interface that has these features:

     Three File Requesters
     One scrolling ListView 
     Fourteen Buttons

OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

 The File Requesters and ListView are loaded with directories that hold
 your picture files. The File Requesters are labeled LEFT, CENTER, and 
 RIGHT. The ListView is referred to as LV.

 You select a file to be converted to ILBM format. Files may be in 
 any of the four source directories, or you can change the directories
 of the File Requesters. The contents of the ListView can only be 
 changed with the Preferences program.

 After the file is converted, (in RAM:) it is displayed with the picture
 viewer of your choice.

 Once a file has been converted, you may select any of these actions 
 to be performed on the converted file:

     1. View it
     2. Delete it
     3. Move it to disk and delete the copy in RAM:

 If the file is deleted or moved, you may not view it again with the 
 VIEW LAST button.

 You may view the picture(s) selected in the LV or File Requesters.

 On-Line Help is available

 Multi selection is NOT supported with the scripts supplied.

CONFIGURING THE SYSTEM

 You do not have to edit a DOS script to configure the program to your 
 system. A complete Preferences program can be called to setup the 
 Source directories, the picture viewer, and the place on your drive 
 you want the converted files written to.

 The Preferences program can be called at any time to change your 
 preferences. The Prefs are saved to Env-Archive, thus making them 
 "permanent".

 When you call the Preferences program, be prepared to supply the four
 directories, the name of your viewer, and the directory where saved
 ILBM files go.

 The first time you call XtoILBM.def, no preferences have been set. You
 will be presented with the Preferences program. At this point, you
 can set your Preferences or cancel the requester. Built in preferences
 will be used until you set your own. 

BUTTONS

 The top row of buttons allow you to simply view the files selected.

  VIEW LEFT       VIEW CENTER     VIEW RIGHT       VIEW LV


 The second row of buttons perform the conversion to ILBM format.

  CONVERT LEFT   CONVERT CENTER   CONVERT RIGHT   CONVERT LV


 The third row of buttons perform a variety of functions.

  DELETE FROM RAM...... Deletes from RAM: the last file you converted.

  MOVE TO DISK......... Copies the last file converted to your drive
                        and deletes the file in RAM:.

  VIEW LAST............ Views the last file converted.

  PREFS................ Calls the Preferences program.

  HELP................. Displays this file on the screen for reference.

  QUIT................. Exits the program.
