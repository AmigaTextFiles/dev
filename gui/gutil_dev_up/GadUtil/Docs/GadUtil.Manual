GadUtil is another gui library which main goal was to make it easy to create
font sensitive user interfaces.  The library has grown away from this main
goal, and become another useful-routine-library.

@NODE "Introduction" "Why another GUI creation library ?"

A little of the history behind this program:

Everybody who have tried to do a program with a nice GUI have almost certainly
come across the problem; how to adjust the program based on the font that user
has selected.  It began as a little test program that should be able to adjust
itself, but I soon realized that it wasn't that easy (as I had thought).

I  was  almost  finished with a working version of the program when I got some
other programs/libraries that did something similar.

The first program I got was MUI (Magical User Interface).  It wasn't that bad,
but it was big (170k) and it was slow.

Another  program  was gadoutline.library, it wasn't exactly like I would want,
and it was quite big (60k).

Then,  I  came  across  the  program that I liked the most:  GadLayout 1.5.  I
changed  one  of  my  programs,  so that it would use GadLayout, but it didn't
work.   I  think  that  the problem was that my assembler didn't work with the
object file for GadLayout (I had never tried that before).

When  GadLayout  didn't  work  for  me  I continued with my own project, but I
changed  it  a bit, because I liked the way GadLayout used tags.  So I changed
my  program , so that it used tags instead of my own gadget structure.  I also
tried  to make the tags work in a similar way as GadLayout's tags, I also used
similar names for the tags (mainly so that I didn't need to change the program
I had adjusted to GadLayout so much.

After  that the first beta version of the program was ready, a friend of mine,
P-O, also started working on the project.  We decided to make the program into
a  shared library, so that all programs could use it without having to include
it in the executable file.  The library was named GadUtil.

After  that  moment  the  library  has  grown  quite a lot, with new tags, new
functions, a lot of enhancements and bugfixes.  Now the library contains about
47  functions, and has quite a lot of tags.  Another feature of the library is
that  it  has some new gadget kinds, like a progress indicator, image gadgets,
drawer  gadgets  etc.  It is also very easy to add hotkeys and localization to
your programs when using gadutil.library.

@NODE "Requirements" "System requirements for this library"

        - Should run on all Amigas with at least KS 37.175 / OS 2.04
        - To take advantage of the locale support OS 2.1 is needed
        - diskfont.library makes the font adaptive stuff a bit more reliable

        The library is tested on the following systems:
                A500 KS 3.0 / WB 3.1 / 030-33
                A3000 KS 3.1 / WB 3.0 / 030-25

@NODE "Distribution" "For those who will copy this around"

  Distribution:

     1) Distribution of this library is allowed in two ways:
          ¹) Only the .library file(s)
          ²) The complete distribution (user or developer archive)

     2) Programmers of totally free software can use and distribute this
        library for free.

     3) Programmers of Shareware, Licensware, commercial products and other
        programs that the programmer get any kind of profit from shall send
        a fully working (and registered) copy of the program and its docs to
        us. All larger updates of the program should also be sent to us.
          
     4) Programmers of non-free software not covered by 1) and 2) (my Diskware
        concept belongs to this group) shall be treated as in 3) (a fully
        working and registered copy...).

     5) All programs (except commercial products in some cases) must state
        that gadutil.library is used. This may be done in either the About
        requester or in the documentation, but best of all in both places.

        Demonstration programs for gadutil.library (that includes the full
        source) may be distributed without this note.

        Example for inclusion in About requester:

             "This program uses gadutil.library, which
              is Copyright © 1994-1997 by P-O Yliniemi
              and Staffan Hämälä."

     6) All localized programs that uses this library should include the
        .ct file(s) to allow anyone to translate that program into their
        own language.

@NODE "Installation" "How to install this package"

        Depending on which archive you downloaded, you will either have one or three
        ways to install the complete package, or parts of it on your system.

        User archive installation:
          Double click on the Install_User icon. This will install gadutil, using the
          standard installation program by Commodore / Escom. If you don't select
          "Novice User", you can select which parts to install. You'll only have 4
          options here:

          The library file    - the only file that is necessary to install
          The debug version   - useful to trace problems in programs that uses GU
          User documentation  - this guide file
          Aminet .readme file - the readme files for both user and developer archive

        Developer archive installation:
          Double click on the Install icon. This will install gadutil, using the
          standard installation program by Commodore / Escom. If you don't select
          "Novice User", you can select which parts to install. Select which "kind"
          of user/programmer you are, and the installation script will fill in some
          defaults to which parts to install. The next (up to) 10 pages will let you
          change the default selected parts for the user selection you did earlier.

          The installation of the AmigaE related stuff (modules and example programs)
          is documented in the file "AmigaE/Docs/gadutil_amigae.guide".

        Include file installation/removal:
          A little shell script is included for fast installation/removal of includes.
          This script will also allow you to edit the include files (don't spread
          edited includes around you, send them to us if you find any bug).

          The script makes use of AskEnv to make it look like a "real" program. You
          will probably have to change the editor path/command in the end of the
          InstallInc.gad file before running the script. Double click the InstallInc
          gadget to start the program.

          Type in the path for your 'C' and/or assembly language include files (if you
          use the selector gadget at the left of the string, you may have to edit it
          by hand afterwards).

          To install includes: select your 'C' compiler or Asm package, and press the
          "Install..." gadget.

          To remove the includes, you don't have to select the compiler or assembler
          type, just press "Remove...".

          To edit the includes just press one of the "Edit ... files" gadgets at the
          bottom of the window.

@NODE "Features" "A brief list the library's features"

Below is a list of some of the main functions covered by this library.

 * FAST (NO OR VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE AGAINST GADTOOLS) AND SMALL (LESS THAN 13k).
   WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE. NO F*CKING 'C' or any other slow language!

 * Font adaptive. Use any of the system fonts and most other fonts for
   gadgets, texts and menus. All gadgets are placed relative to each
   other, but can be placed at absolute positions (needed for the first
   gadget).

 * No need to use GIMMEZEROZERO windows, as this is automatically handled
   by the library. If you specify a gadget position of 10,10 the gadget
   will be placed at 10,10 within the window's border.

 * Localized. It is really easy to localize all your (new) programs by
   using this library. Functions and macros for creating localized menus
   are supplied.

 * Both assembly and 'C' language support. This is one of the things that is
   missing in most of the other gui libraries. Some extra macros are defined
   for assembly language users, and will make the gadget and menu creating
   process even more easy.

 * All GadTools gadgets are supported. Some extra functions are provided
   for ListViews. BUTTON_KIND (and IMAGE_KIND) gadgets have some extra tags,
   including a toggle-select option.

   6 extended gadget types are handled by the library:
    
     · FILE_KIND     - gadget for selecting a file.

     · DRAWER_KIND   - gadget for selecting a drawer. Most programs also
                       use this gadget for file selection.

     · IMAGE_KIND    - uses an intuition image for the gadget. Can use
                       different images for selected and non-selected state.

     · BEVELBOX_KIND - gadtools bevelboxes, with some extensions. All
                       gadtools bevelboxes are supported (even with v37).
                       Extensions allows text to be placed above, in or below
                       the upper line of the box. All kinds can be inverted.

                       New for v36.52: Bevelbox text placement extended.
                       3 new placements available together with the old
                       ones: centered, left adjusted & right adjusted.

                       BFT_BUTTON   - GT v37 BUTTON_KIND border
                       BFT_RIDGE    - GT v37 STRING_KIND border
                       BFT_DROPBOX  - GT v39 BBFT_ICONDROPBOX border
                       BFT_HORIZBAR - A horizontal shadowed line
                       BFT_VERTBAR  - A vertical shadowed line

                       This makes it a total of 100 bevel box types. The bevel
                       boxes are treated as gadgets by the library, and you
                       can obtain the structure for the bevelbox in the same
                       way as you get the gadget pointer.

                       New for v36.53: Added optional shadow on bevel box text.
                       The shadow has a selectable color/pen and the "sun" can
                       be placed in four different positions.

     · PROGRESS_KIND - progress indicator gadget. Background and fill color
                       can be selected. Supports values up to 4.294.967.295,
                       but maximum value should not exceed 4.294.967.295/width.
                       v36.55.

     · LABEL_KIND    - a text label that can be placed relative to other texts,
                       gadgets, bevelboxes and progress indicators.

 * Can create the minimum required IDCMP mask so that all gadgets works.

 * A new OpenFont (graphics.library and diskfont.library replacement) is supplied.
   This function will open any font (from RAM, ROM or load it from disk).

 * Functions for listviews include adding nodes (memory for the string is
   allocated by the function), counting nodes, getting node pointers, clearing
   a listview, attach and detach lists, moving nodes up and down. A function
   that allows you to sort one or two lists is included from v36.59.

 * No need to open gadtools.library anymore, since all gadtools functions are
   provided through this library. Some (the most useable) functions from locale
   library are also provided by gadutil.

 * Many libraries are opened through gadutil.library, and these library bases
   are available for your own use (you don't have to open or close some libs).

 * All gadgets are created using tag lists. Every next gadget will use the
   previous gadgets values as defaults. Only one call to the gadget making
   routine is needed for every gadget list.

 * All gadgets can have their own hotkey. No extra work is needed by the
   programmer (only one extra tag).

 * All gadgets (and bevelboxes, texts and progress displays) can have a help
   string attached to it. If the pointer is moved above that object, a
   selectable string or text gadget will be used to display the help string.
   The text can alternatively be shown in the window's or screen's title. The
   help string can be localized.

 * Distributed with lots of examples, mostly in assembly language, but also
   in 'C'.

 * Other functions include:

     · Status change for toggle select buttons.

     · String change for STRING and TEXT_KIND gadgets.

     · Disable functions for all gadget kinds (new for 36.56).

     · Routines to set up a busy-pointer (available for both v37 and v39). These
       routines also blocks the input to the main window of the program.

     · Routine to check if the mouse pointer is within a gadgets box. Useful
       for mouse-position sensitive appwindows.

     · Bevelbox and window refreshing functions.

     · Functions to clear and size/move windows

     · Easy access to the most important values of the gadgets.

 * FAST (NO OR VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE AGAINST GADTOOLS) AND SMALL (LESS THAN 13k).
   WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE. NO F*CKING 'C' or any other slow language!

@NODE "Limitations" "Limitiations (in this version) of GadUtil"

        The following limitations exist in the current version of GadUtil:

        - Gadgets will not be recalculated when resizing a window

        - Some GadgetID's are reserved by GadUtil. This should not be a problem,
          since at least 65000 GadgetID's will still be usable by the programmer.
          Currently there are only 3 reserved ID's (65533 to 65535, or -1 to -3).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "History"

@{U}Changes overview:@{UU}

* 37.10 (28-Sep-97)
        GU_NoCreate now works on individual gadgets. Useful to create invisible
        gadgets that helps you place the other objects in the window.

        6 new tags added that will allow you to save the object's calculated left,
        top, right and bottom edge, as well as the gadget's width and height.

        E includes added to the distribution.

* 37.9  (22-Dec-96)
        6 new tags added for the help functions. It is now possible to set a default
        help text that will be shown if no gadget is under the pointer.

        GU_DefWTitle            - default window title
        GU_DefLocWTitle         - localized window title
        GU_DefSTitle            - default screen title
        GU_DefLocSTitle         - localized screen title
        GU_DefHelpText          - default help text
        GU_DefLocHelpText       - localized help text

        A little bug removed from the help routines. Versions beore 37.9 could
        display two different help text at the same time (in different gadgets or
        the screen or window title).

        A new include file is included in the distribution now. Now it should be
        possible to compile the examples with older versions of the system include
        files (OS 2.0x includes are supported now)

        A third archive with the HTML version of the GadUtil documentation is
        included in the distribution now. Also included with this archive is some
        pictures of applications using GadUtil.

        The distribution has changed a bit, resulting in that the archive with all
        files became smaller (developer archive only).


* 37.8  (15-Jul-96)
        Some bug fixes in the new help functions. If 0 was used as data on a GU_HelpText
        tag with a gadget that shows the help text in the window's or screen's title,
        there were some enforcer hits

        Deleted the separate autodoc files. Appended some information on the contents of
        the GU_Public structure to the autodocs. More info about SCRTITLE_HELP and
        WINTITLE_HELP was also appended.

        Changed the help function so that all gadgets and title bars that are used to
        display help strings is cleared if the mouse pointer is outside all gadgets that
        have help texts.

* 37.7  (12-Jul-96)
        Bug fix in the prototype for GU_ChangeStr (two parameters was mixed up).

        GU_ChangeStr now works for both STRING_KIND and TEXT_KIND gadgets. If the
        gadget isn't a STRING or TEXT gadget nothing is done.

        Bug fix in GU_CoordsInGadBox function. The register D3 was trashed in all
        earlier versions of GU.

        Three new tags allows any STRING or TEXT_KIND gadget to show a (localized)
        help text for each gadget in the window. These tags also works with the
        special gadgets (BEVELBOX, LABEL, PROGRESS). The gadgets attached to the
        window is scanned in sequential order. If a BEVELBOX_KIND gadget matches
        the pointer position, this gadget's help string will have the lowest
        priority. If another BEVELBOX is found inside this, the help string for
        that one will be used if there is no gadget inside that box. The help
        text can also be displayed in the window/screen title.

        The TEXT_KIND, STRING_KIND, NUMBER_KIND and INTEGER_KIND gadget's current
        value can now be read from the gu_Active field in the structure that
        gg_UserData points to.

* 37.6  (15-Jun-96)
        gu_Active in the structure that gg_UserData points to was not updated
        when using any routine that used GU_SetGadgetAttrsA(). Now it checks
        the gu_Active value to see if it is out of the gadget's limits.

        gng_Flags and gng_GadgetText is now cleared before creation of every
        new gadget.

        The LAYOUTA_Spacing tag for LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets is now used to
        determine the height of the gadget. If the height of a gadget should
        be about 4 lines (GU_HeightFactor, 4), the height of the gadget is
        calculated to 4*(font height+value of LAYOUTA_Spacing tag). The same
        method is used for the GU_AddHeiLines tag.

        Hotkeys for LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets works as they should again. In v37.5
        of GadUtil (and probably some earlier ones), the listview didn't scroll
        down when you selected the next entry.

        Inserted pragmas and prototypes for tagcalls (pragmas only for SAS/C).
        It is possible to create stub routines for the tagcalls for other
        compilers by using fd2pragma 2.0.

        Inserted links to the include files in the index file for GadUtil.guide.

* 37.5  (29-May-96)
        Bug in PROGRESS_KIND gadget removed. If the gadget was set to
        show x/0 (also 0/0), a division by zero was done.

        Two new constants added to the include files: GADUTIL_VER and
        GADUTIL_REV.
        
        Bug fixes in test (demo) programs. The FPF_DISKFONT flag in the
        TextAttr structure was unset in all demo programs. Replaced the
        manual version check in the demo programs with the GadUtil function
        GU_CheckVersion. Removed unnecessary IDCMP flags from the demo
        programs and replaced GadTools IDCMP with the GU_MinimumIDCMP tag.

* 37.4  (14-May-96)
        Created a new gadget kind: LABEL_KIND. This gadget kind is used
        to place text relative to other gadgets, bevel boxes, and other
        texts. Can use the same type of shadows that the text for the
        bevel box.

        Implemented a new function in the library: GU_CloseFont. Works
        like graphics CloseFont, but takes the parameter in A0 instead
        of A1.

        Replaced the list sort routine with a new one that sorts better.

        Wrote a new document, "GadUtil.index", that have a list over all
        gadutil functions, sorted by what they do. There are also some
        shortcuts to all tags for gadutil's own gadget kinds.

        Created two new flags for BEVELBOX_KIND and LABEL_KIND:
        BB_3DTEXT - can be used as a replacement for GUBB_3DText, TRUE
        LB_3DTEXT - can be used as a replacement for GULB_3DText, TRUE
        
* 37.3  (10-May-96)
        Enforcer hits fixed in the code that handles the GU_AdjustLeft
        and GU_AdjustRight tags.

        A new function to clear the inner part of a window was added.

        A new function to size (and move, if necessary) a window was
        added.

        Bug fix in assembly language include file.

* 37.2  (02-May-96)
        Started programming in StormC and did some tests with the library,
        noticed that there was a couple of errors in some include files.

        GU_UpdateProgress was wrongly specified in the FD/clib files.
        The output of GU_GetGadgetPtr was specified as (struct Gadget *),
        this is now corrected.

        Included an example in C that uses the PROGRESS_KIND gadget.

* 37.1  (01-May-96)
        IMAGE_KIND gadget bug fix. The color of the unselected image of
        the gadget was wrong, if the image used more than 4 colors.

* 37.0  (29-Apr-96)
        A new function that checks the library's revision added.
        Two new tags added: GU_FractWidth and GU_FractHeight. Suggested
        by Morten Amundsen.

        Some small bug fixes in 'C' include files (unterminated comments).
        Cleaned up BetterTest.c a bit (removed some {}). Bug fix on the
        last line of the example (GT_ReplyIMsg -> GU_ReplyIMsg).

        Added support for StormC in both installer script and include-
        file installer. Created dictionary for StormC, so that all words
        that belongs to GadUtil (functions, tags and constants) is shown
        in another color.

* 36.60 (24-Feb-96)
        Uses the screen's font as the gadget font if no GU_DefTextAttr or
        GU_TextAttr tag is used. Bug fix from v36.59. Changed some docs,
        assembled all examples, changed installation scripts.

* 36.59 (06-Jan-96)
        More docs completed (all docs, finally). Bug fix in the GU_AutoWidth,
        GU_AdjustLeft and GU_AdjustRight tags. The underscore character was
        counted as a normal one. This made gadgets without hotkeys one char
        smaller than other gadgets. A new function that sorts one or two
        lists was added. Some new constants added in include files.
        Changed GU_MinimumIDCMP to support hotkeys. Changed PROGRESS_KIND
        to use GU_GadgetText and GU_LocaleText. Uses the screen's font as
        the gadget font if no GU_DefTextAttr or GU_TextAttr tag is used.

* 36.58 (01-Jan-96)
        SLIDER_KIND and SCROLLER_KIND gadgets returned wrong result in
        im->Code if the gadget was changes using the hotkey. Bug reported
        by Lukasz Szelag.

* 36.57 (10-Dec-95)
        Some more docs finished. A memory loss bug was fixed.

* 36.56 (10-Oct-95)
        Changed some routines, so that hotkeys can't be used on disabled
        gadgets. Made it possible to disable IMAGE_KIND, FILE_KIND and
        DRAWER_KIND gadgets.

* 36.55 (30-Sep-95)
        Bug fix in the hotkey part of the library. Wrong code were sent back
        when using GU_LabelHotkey with a LISTVIEW_KIND gadget. A new gadget
        kind was created, PROGRESS_KIND.

* 36.54 (06-Jul-95)
        Added support for GU_AutoWidth to CYCLE_KIND gadgets.

* 36.53 (05-Jul-95) 
        3 new tags and 4 new flags was added for the BEVELBOX_KIND gadget.
        BEVELBOX_KIND gadgets can now have a shadow added to the text in the
        border. The "sun" can be placed in 4 different places. GU_MinimumIDCMP
        tag was added.

* 36.52 (25-Jun-95)
        First public release. Some new flags for the BEVELBOX_KIND gadget was
        added. Supports a total of 100 bevelbox kinds.
