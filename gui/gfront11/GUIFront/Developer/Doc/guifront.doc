    GADGETSPEC

        This is probably the most important structure of GUIFront. It is
        parsed by GF_CreateGUIA() and subsequently used to create the
        final gadget which will appear in your GUI.

        GadgetSpec structures may be reused in calls to GF_CreateGUIA(),
        since GUIFront does not alter any user-settable fields in the
        structure. Some fields will however be overwritten, as explained
        below.

        Explanation of data fields (see libraries/guifront.h as well):

        GadgetSpec.gs_Kind (int)

            The gadget "kind". All normal GadTools kinds are supported,
            as well as one extra kind which is used frequently in many
            applications:

            GETALT_KIND ("Get Alternative" or just "get-something")

            This new kind supports the following tags:

            GA_Disabled (BOOL)

                Works just like normal GadTools gadgets.

            ALT_Image (int)

                The GETALT_KIND actually breaks down into a number of
                different sub-kinds, as dictated by this tag:

                ALTI_GetDir

                    This will give you a gadget with a "folder" image rendered
                    inside. Typically used for directory selections.

                ALTI_GetFile

                    This gives you a gadget with a "paper-with-bent-corner"
                    image inside. Typically used for file selections.

                ALTI_GetMisc (default)

                    This gives you a gadget with an "arrow-down" image
                    inside. You can use this for selections which aren't for
                    files or directories (names from a list, for example).

                ALTI_GetFont

                    This subkind gives you a gadget with an "A" inside,
					suitable for Font selections.

                ALTI_GetScreenMode

                    This subkind gives you a gadget with a "monitor" image
                    usable for screen mode selections. (37.3)
                    Note: Worked like ALTI_GetMisc under pre-37.3 versions.

            ALT_AslRequester (BOOL)

                If you supply a non-null value for this tag, GUIFront
                actually takes care of all the underlying ASL magic
                required in order to make the subkind work. For example,
                if the subkind is ALTI_GetFont, GUIFront automatically
                pops up an ASL font requester whenever the user clicks on
                this gadget. If the user cancels the ASL requester, your
                application won't even hear about it.

                On the other hand, if the user does select a font, you will
                hear an IDCMP_GADGETUP for the GETALT_KIND gadget, after
                which you should interrogate the ASL font requester about
                which font the user selected. To accomplish this you must
                use the ALT_AslRequester tag in a call to GF_GetGadgetAttrsA(),
                which in turn gives you a pointer to the actual ASL requester
                structure allocated by GUIFront. The selected font is then
                available in fo->fo_Attr.ta_Name (i.e. as normal).

                Note that automatic ASL requesters will lock all windows
                of your GUIFrontApp for the duration of the requester.

                Automatic requesters are supported for ALTI_GetFile,
                ALTI_GetFont, ALTI_GetDir and ALTI_GetScreenMode.

        GadgetSpec.gs_MinWidth (UWORD)

            If non-zero, GUIFront will set the width of the gadget hitbox to
            the width of this number of characters of the actual font being
            used. This is useful when you want to specify how many characters
            you want to be visible in (for example) string gadgets.

        GadgetSpec.gs_MinHeight (UWORD)

            If non-zero, GUIFront will set the height of the gadget hitbox to
            the height of this number of character lines of the actual font
            being used. This is particulary useful for specifying the minimum
            number of lines visible in a listview gadget, but may also be used
            for other resizable kinds.

        GadgetSpec.gs_ng (struct NewGadget)

            This is a fully embedded NewGadget structure. Set all
            fields just like you would in a normal call to GadTools'
            CreateGadget() funcion. Exceptions include:

            ng_LeftEdge
            ng_TopEdge
            ng_Width
            ng_Height

                Data in these fields will be overwritten by the position
                and size information of the final GadTools gadget. Do not
                use for private data.

                Note that you can examine these fields to learn the exact
                pixel position of the hitbox of your gadget, in case you want
                to do some special rendering on top of it.

            ng_GadgetText

                If the GS_Localized gs_Flags is set (see later), you would
                probably use this field to store the catalog string number
                (just a suggestion).

            ng_TextAttr
            ng_VisualInfo

                    Data in these field will be overwritten. Do not use.

        GadgetSpec.gs_Tags (struct TagItem *)

            This field must contain the tag list to use when calling GadTools'
            CreateGadget function. Currently, GUIFront imposes a few
            restrictions on tags for certain kinds:

                SLIDER_KIND:

                    All forms of level indications are not yet supported by
                    the layout engine.  This includes GTSL_MaxLevelLen,
                    GTSL_LevelFormat, GTSL_LevelPlace and GTSL_MaxPixelLen.
                    Using any of these tags may lead to strange looking GUIs.

                    As a temporary workaround, simply put an invisible dummy
                    TEXT_KIND gadget next to the slider, so GadTools will
                    render the level indication on top of it.

                MX_KIND:

                    GTMX_TitlePlace supported (even under V37), but only for
                    PLACETEXT_ABOVE and PLACETEXT_BELOW. All other title
                    locations are illegal. Using no title at all is of course
                    still perfectly alright.

            GUIFront also changes the way certain tags are interpreted:

                SCROLLER_KIND:

                    If you are using GS_DefaultTags, specify {GTSC_Arrows, 0}
                    to _disable_ scroller arrows. Otherwise, GUIFront will
                    append some appropriately sized arrows to your scroller
                    gadget.

                LISTVIEW_KIND:

                    For GTLV_ShowSelected, do *NOT* supply a pointer to a
                    pre-created gadtools STRING_KIND. In stead, supply either
                    NULL or a pointer to a STRING_KIND GadgetSpec, initialized
                    as normal. GUIFront will do the rest.

                    GTLV_MakeVisible is supported under V37.

        GadgetSpec.gs_Flags (UWORD)

            These flags control various aspects in relation to this
            particular gadget. Defined bits are:

            GS_NoWidthExtend
            GS_NoHeightExtend

                During layout it may be necessary for the layout engine to
                "stretch" members of a group. For all GadgetSpec members, this
                means enlarging the actual hitbox of these gadgets (buttons
                with PLACETEXT_IN, for example). However, this is not always
                desirable. For example, if you want a string gadget to show
                exactly 20 characters, you can do this by setting ng_MinWidth
                to 20 and setting GS_NoWidthExtend in gs_Flags.

                Note that CHECKBOX_KINDs automatically get both
                GS_NoWidthExtend and GS_NoHeightExtend set.

                Also note that GETALT_KINDs extend only vertically.

                GS_Localized

                    If this flag is set, the ng_GadgetText field is ignored
                    and the localizer function will be called to supply the
                    gadget label.

                        Note that GF_CreateGUIA() will fail if any of the
                        GadgetSpecs in the layout tag list has this flag set,
                        and you do not also supply a localizer function in your
                        call to GF_CreateGUIA().
                        See GF_CreateGUIA()/GUI_LocaleFunc for more info.

                GS_BoldLabel

                    Specify this flag to have the label text of this gadget
                    rendered in bold-face (e.g. to indicate a default
                    response).

                GS_DefaultTags

                    Specify this flag to allow GUIFront to supply some
                    reasonable default tags to your gadget. Currently,
                    default tags include the following:

                    All kinds:

                        GT_Underscore, '_'

                    CHECKBOX_KIND:

                        GTCB_Scaled, TRUE

                            The size of the checkbox is automatically
                            calculated by GUIFront.

                    MX_KIND:

                        GTMX_Scaled, TRUE

                            The size of the radio buttons is automatically
                            calculated by GUIFront.

                        GTMX_Spacing

                            GUIFront will supply a suitable value for the
                            distance between individual radio buttons.
                            This currently means 4 pixels in high resolution
                            modes and 2 otherwise.

                    SCROLLER_KIND:

                        GTSC_Arrows

                            GUIFront automatically calculates how wide the
                            scroller arrows should be based on the font being
                            used. Note that to have SCROLLER_KINDs without
                            arrows, either do not use GS_DefaultTags or suppy
                            {GTSC_Arrows, 0} as a special indication telling
                            GUIFront that you don't want the arrows.

                    PALETTE_KIND:

                        GTPA_IndicatorWidth,
                        GTPA_IndicatorHeight,

                            GUIFront calculates an appropriately sized
                            indicator box (V37.2) and places it to the
                            left of the palette. Under V39+ indication
                            works by framing the selected color, and so
                            effectively ignores these tags. Note that
                            GS_DefaultTags always supply these tags, even
                            if you don't want an indicator. To create a
                            PALETTE_KIND without an indicator, simply do
                            not use GS_DefaultTags.

                        GTPA_Depth

                            Your palette kind will be set to the depth of
                            the current default public screen.

        GadgetSpec.gs_Gadget (struct Gadget *) (read-only)

            This field will be set to the value returned by GadTools'
            CreateGadget() function. You can use this in subsequent
            calls GF_Set/GetGadgetAttrsA(), and for other non-GUIFront
            functions which require the gadget pointer.

			Note: GUIFront stores a pointer to the GadgetSpec used to
			create a gadget in the UserData field of the gadget, so do
			not use this field (gadget->UserData) for private data.
guifront.library/GF_CreateGUIAppA           guifront.library/GF_CreateGUIAppA

    NAME
        GF_CreateGUIAppA - Create GUIFront application anchor structure (V37.2)
        GF_CreateGUIApp  - Varargs stub for GF_CreateGUIAppA() (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        guifrontapp = GF_CreateGUIAppA(appid, tags)
                                       A0     A1

        GUIFrontApp *GF_CreateGUIAppA(char *, struct Tagitem *);

        guifrontapp = GF_CreateGUIApp(appid, ...)

        GUIFrontApp *GF_CreateGUIApp(char *);

    FUNCTION
        This function is used to allocate a GUIFront "anchor" structure for
        use in subsequent calls to functions such as GF_CreateGUIA(), and
        in order to give your application a symbolic name for use in the
        GUIFront preferences program.

    INPUTS
        appid - The symbolic name of your application. Must be less than
                50 characters. Must not be an empty string (""), and NULL
                is NOT allowed here either.

        tags  - Optional tags containing descriptive information about
                your application. Supported tags include:

                (The GFA prefix is short for "GUIFront Application tag")
                                              ¯  ¯     ¯
                GFA_Author (char *) Author name (max 70 characters)
                    The author of this application (probably yourself)

                GFA_Date (char *) Release date (max 14 characters)
                    The date of release. The format itself is free, but
                    it is suggested you use standard $VER: compatible
                    date strings.

                GFA_LongDesc (char *) Long desciption (max 70 characters)
                    A longer description of this application. One line only,
                    please.

                GFA_Version (char *) Version information (max 20 characters)
                    Version information pertaining to this release. The format
                    is free. Note that GUIFront does not distinguish between
                    two applications with the same id if they have different
                    version numbers.

                Note: The above four tags are initialized by the first
                GUIFront application to run with this AppID, and is then
                effectively ignored.

                GFA_VisualUpdateSigBit (ULONG) Prefs change signal bit
                    If you want to receive notification when the preferences
                    pertaining to your application change, specify any
                    value other than -1 here. When the preferences change,
                    your task (or the one you specify with the
                    GFA_VisualUpdateSigTask tag) will be signalled with the
                    signal bit you specify here. Default is -1, no
                    signalling. (V37.3)

                GFA_VisualUpdateSigTask (struct Task *) Task to update
                    Task to signal when preferences change. This tag is
                    valid only in connection with GFA_VisualUpdateSigBit.
                    Default is FindTask(0). (V37.3)

    BUGS
        None known.

    NAME
        GF_DestroyGUIApp - Free GUIFront anchor structure (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        GF_DestroyGUIApp(guifrontapp)
                         A0

        void GF_DestroyGUI(GUIFrontApp *);

    FUNCTION
        This function is used to free all resources currently in use by
        your application. This means closing and destroying all GUIs and
        deallocating the GUIFrontApp anchor structure itself. After this
        function returns none of your GUIs should be referenced in any way,
        nor should the anchor structure (it will point to garbage).

    INPUTS
        guifrontapp - As returned by GF_CreateGUIAppA() (NULL is allowed)

    BUGS
        None known.

                                struct TagItem *);

        gui = GF_CreateGUI(guifrontapp, layout_taglist, gadgetlist, ...)

        GUIFront *GF_CreateGUI(struct TagItem *, GadgetSpec **, ...);

    FUNCTION
        This is the main layout function of GUIFront.  It accepts an array
        of layout tags from which it calculates not only usable gadget
        coordinates, but also a complete gadget context list for use directly
        with the WA_Gadgets tag in OpenWindowTagList().  This allows you to
        create fully font sensitive GUIs with a minimum of efford.

        This function is extremely versatile. Not only will it layout the GUI,
        it will also supply new-style gadget label underscoring (as seen in
        utilities such as Spot (Nico François), GadToolsBox (Jan van den Baard)
        and PowerCache (by yours truly ;-), do automatic backfilling and
        group framing, as well as process shift-cancellable hotkeys through
        a few simple GadTools replacement functions (see GF_GetIMsg() and
        GF_ReplyIMsg())

    INPUTS
        guifrontapp - GUIFrontApp anchor structure to attach this GUI
                      to (see GF_CreateGUIAppA())

        gadgetlist - Pointer to NULL terminated array of pointers to
                     all GadgetSpecs referenced in layout_list.
                     References to GadgetSpecs not present in this
                     list will make GF_CreateGUIA() fail.

        layout_taglist - Layout tag list

            Pointer to array of Tag Items, which fully describes
            the entire gadget layout.

            Layout tags include:

            (The GUIL prefix is short for "GUI Layout list")
                                           ¯¯¯ ¯
            GUIL_VertGroup, (ULONG spacing) - begin a vertical group

                Initiates a new vertical group. The various elements in this
                group (GadgetSpecs or other groups) will be seperated by
                'spacing' quantum units of space.  Note: Make sure each
                GUIL_VertGroup has a matching TAG_END!

            GUIL_HorizGroup, (ULONG spacing) - begin a horizontal group

                Initiates a new horizontal group. The various elements in
                this group (GadgetSpecs or other groups) will be seperated
                by 'spacing' quantum units of space.  Note:  Make sure
                each GUIL_HorizGroup has a matching TAG_END!

            GUIL_GadgetSpecID, (ULONG id) - add gadget to current group

                Add a gadget to the current group.  'id' must match the
                GadgetID field of one of the GadgetSpecs supplied in
                'gadgetlist'.  Each GadgetSpec may be used only once in
                the layout tag list.

            GUIL_Flags, (ULONG) - miscellaneous layout control bits

                This flag controls various aspects of the current group.
                Currently, the following bits are supported:

                Group extension bits (all mutually exclusive):
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                These flags control how members in a group extend as the
                group itself expands, to match ajacent groups in length or
                height:

                GUILF_PropShare

                    Members in groups which have this extension attribute
                    maintain their relative size as the group expands:

                       33%          66%
                    [ Short ] [ Very, very long ]
                    <------- Group width ------->

                         33%                66%
                    [   Short   ] [    Very very long   ]
                    <------------ Group width ---------->

                    Turn the monitor 90° and you'll have the same
                    illustration for vertical groups.

                GUILF_EqualShare

                    With this extension attribute, members are given exactly
                    the same share of the group:

                       40%         60%
                    [ Short ] [ Much longer ]
                    <----- Group width ----->

                            50%                    50%
                    [      Short      ] [   Much longer   ]
                    <------------- Group width ----------->

                    Turn the monitor 90° and you'll have the same
                    illustration for vertical groups.

                GUILF_EqualSize

                    This extension attribute makes each member equally big,
                    and then simply increases the space between members to
                    match the size of the group:

                     50 pix        98 pix
                    [ Short ] [ Much longer ]
                    <----- Group width ----->

                        98 pix                   98 pix
                    [    Short    ]        [ Much longer ]
                    <------------- Group width ---------->

                    Turn the monitor 90° and you'll have the same
                    illustration for vertical groups.

                Other flags (all combinations are valid):
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                GUILF_EqualWidth or GUILF_EqualHeight

                    This forces all members of a group to be stretched to
                    equal size in the secondary dimension, as illustrated
                    in this vertical group:

                    +----+              +--------+
                    | Ab |              |   Ab   |
                    +----+       ===\   +--------+
                    +--------+   ===/   +--------+
                    | Abcdef |          | Abcdef |
                    +--------+          +--------+
                                   With GUILF_EqualWidth

                    Turn the monitor 90° and you'll have the same
                    illustration for horizontal groups.

                GUILF_LabelAlign

                    This is a special alignment tag, which is only allowed
                    in vertical groups. It causes gadgets to be vertically
                    aligned by their hitboxes in stead of their labels:

                    Text: [········]                 Text: [········]
                    Long text: [···]            Long text: [···]

                         Normal                 With GUILF_LabelAlign

                    Combining GUILF_LabelAlign and GUILF_EqualWidth gives
                    the following rather pleasing result:

                         Text: [········]
                    Long text: [········]

                The default for GUIL_Flags is (GUILF_PropShare |
                GUILF_EqualHeight).

                Note:  If you specify GUIL_Flags without specifying a group
                extension   mode   (GUIL_PropShare  or  GUIL_EqualShare  or
                GUIL_EqualSize), it will default to GUIL_PropShare. (V37.3)

            GUIL_FrameType (ULONG frametype)

                GUIFront allows you to frame any group.  To enable
                framing, specify any of the following frame types for the
                current group:

                    GUILFT_Normal - A raised bevelbox (*)
                    GUILFT_Recess - A recessed bevelbox (*)
                    GUILFT_Ridge  - Ridge frame

                    (*) - If you are using backfilling for this GUI
                          (see GUI_Backfill below), the interor of
                          these frame kinds will be cleared to allow
                          display on top of a background pattern.

            GUIL_FrameHeadline (char *)

                This tag allows you to put a "title" on a frame.  It is
                used mostly with GUILFT_Ridge, but is also valid for other
                frame kinds.  Note:  If the current group turns out to be
                too short to display the entire frame headline, it will
                not be shown at all (truncation is ugly :-)

        controltags - Miscellaneous control tags

            Currently supported tags include:

            GUI_InitialOrientation (ULONG) - Initial group layout orientation

                This tag defines the initial layout group orientation.
                It must be either GUIL_VertGroup or GUIL_HorizGroup (default).

                Example:

                ULONG tags[] =
                {
                    GUIL_GadgetSpecID, GID_OK,
                    GUIL_GadgetSpecID, GID_CANCEL,
                    GUIL_HorizGroup, 1,
                        ...
                    TAG_DONE
                };

                With GUI_InitialOrientation set to GUIL_VertGroup:

                [ ok ]
                [ cancel ]
                (horizgroup here)

                With GUI_InitialOrientation set to GUIL_HorizGroup:

                [ ok ] [ cancel ] (horizgroup here)

                See also GUI_InitialSpacing below.

            GUI_InitialSpacing (ULONG) - Initial inter-group spacing
                Defines the initial group spacing of the layout tag list.
                The value itself is in terms of "spacing quantum units",
                which is something GUIFront figures out by itself.
                Default is 1.

            GUI_Backfill (BOOL) - Enable backfilling
                If you supply a non-null value for this tag, your window
                will be backfilled with the current preference backfilling
                pattern, as defined by the user.  Backfilling typically
                requires that the outermost group is [recess] framed, so
                that gadgets and their labels are not rendered directly on
                top of the backfilling (which looks pretty strange :-).

            GUI_NewMenu (struct NewMenu *) - Attach menu
                Attaches a menu strip to this GUI.

            GUI_NewMenuLoc (struct NewMenu *) - Attach localized menu
                Like GUI_NewMenu, this tag is used to attach a menu strip to
                the GUI. However, this tag also calls your localizer function
                once for each item in the NewMenu array, allowing you to
                supply a localized menu item or title string.
                See GUI_LocaleFunc for information on the localizer hook,
                and how it is called for NewMenus.

            GUI_UserData (ULONG) - User data area
                This tag allows you to attach a custom value to each GUI.

                To make message handling for multi-window applications
                easier, you can use this area to store a pointer to a
                function dispatcher to call for messages pertaining to this
                GUI.  In your main message event handling loop, you can then
                use the following technique to conveniently dispatch incoming
                IntuiMessages:

                -------------------------------------------------------------
                GUIFront *a = GF_CreateGUI(....);
                GUIFront *b = GF_CreateGUI(....);

                GF_SetGUIAttrs(a, GUI_UserData, myfirstdispatchfunc,...);
                GF_SetGUIAttrs(b, GUI_UserData, myseconddispatchfunc,...);

                while (imsg = GF_GetIMsg(myguifrontapp))
                {
                   void (*thisdispatcher)(struct IntuiMessage *);
                   GUIFront *thisgui;

                   /* Pay attention here! GUIFront always stores a pointer to
                    * the GUIFront being used for a window in the UserData
                    * field of that window. Here's how to retrieve it:
                    */

                   thisgui = imsg->IDCMPWindow->UserData;

                   /* The only alternative method of determining which of
                    * your GUI's `thisgui' is, is to compare it with each
                    * of your (global) gui pointers until you get a match.
                    * But this way is MUCH easier :-)
                    */

                   GF_GetGUIAttrs(thisgui, GUI_UserData, &thisdispatcher, ..);

                   (*thisgui)(imsg);

                   GF_ReplyIMsg(imsg);
                }
                -------------------------------------------------------------

                Note however that GUIFront does not require or expect you to
                use GUI_UserData in this particular way, so you are of course
                free to store any value you want in this field.

            GUI_OpenGUI (BOOL)

                Supply a non-null value to have GUIFront attempt to open the
                GUI (in a window, obviously).  GUIFront works out the
                necessary IDCMP- and window flags.  See GUI_ExtraIDCMP.

            GUI_WindowTitle, (char *)

                The desired title of the window for this GUI.

            GUI_ScreenTitle (char *) (V37.3)

                The desired title of the screen when this GUI is active.

            GUI_LeftEdge (short) (V37.3)

                The desired left edge of the GUI (once it opens). This
                tag is mainly used to be able to recreate and open a GUI
                at the same position it was at when it was closed.
                Default is -1, which means "center under the mouse".

            GUI_TopEdge (short) (V37.3)

                The desired top edge of the GUI (once it opens). This
                tag is mainly used to be able to recreate and open a GUI
                at the same position it was at when it was closed.
                Default is -1, which means "center under the mouse".

            GUI_ExtraIDCMP, (ULONG)

                GUIFront normally calculates suitable IDCMP flags for your
                window, but there are cases where these flags are
                insufficient for your application.  For example, if you want
                notification on disk insertions, you would supply
                IDCMP_DISKINSERTED in GUI_ExtraIDCMP.

            GUI_ExtendedError (ExtErrorData *) - Extended error reporting

                If for some reason GF_CreateGUIA() fails, it simply returns a
                plain NULL.  This makes tracking down layout errors rather
                difficult, so this tag has been provided to give you a better
                clue as to why the layout fails.  Currently, the following
                error codes are returned in ExtErrorData.ee_ErrorCode:

                (The GFERR prefix is short for "GUIFront Error")
                                                ¯  ¯     ¯¯¯
                GFERR_UNKNOWN

                    Some unknown error occurred.

                GFERR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY

                    The layout engine ran out of memory.

                GFERR_MISSING_LOCALIZER

                    A localized GadgetSpec was found (flags & GS_Localized),
                    but no localizer hook was provided (see GUI_LocaleFunc).

                    ExtErrorData.ee_ErrorData will contain a pointer to the
                    offending GadgetSpec.

                GFERR_GUI_TOO_WIDE

                    The resulting layout was too wide to open, even when
                    falling back to topaz/8. The width, as computed by
                    GUIFront, will be stored in ExtErrorData.ee_ErrorData
                    for further scrutiny.

                GFERR_GUI_TOO_TALL

                    The resulting layout was too tall to open, even when
                    falling back to topaz/8. The height, as computed by
                    GUIFront, will be stored in ExtErrorData.ee_ErrorData
                    for further scrutiny.

                GFERR_CANT_FIND_SCREEN

                    The layout engine could not locate the default public
                    screen (which probably means your system is in big
                    trouble at the moment)

                GFERR_CANT_FIND_GADGETSPECID

                    A GadgetSpec with some GadgetID was referenced in the
                    layout tag list, but not found in the supplied gadgetlist
                    (see description of input parameter `gadgetlist'). The
                    offending GadgetID will be stored in
                    ExtErrorData.ee_ErrorData.

                GFERR_UNKNOWN_LAYOUT_TAG

                    The layout tag list is incorrectly formatted, or contains
                    garbage. Most likely you're missing a TAG_DONE somewhere.
                    The offending tag value will be stored in

                GFERR_CANT_OPEN_WINDOW

                    This error is returned if {GUI_OpenGUI,TRUE} was specified,
                    but the window could not be opened. The most likely cause of
                    failure is low memory.

                GFERR_CANT_CREATE_MENUS

                    GUIFront was unable to Create and Layout the NewMenu
                    supplied by you with GUI_NewMenu.

            GUI_LocaleFunc ( struct Hook * )

                If any of the GadgetSpec structures in the layout control
                taglist has its GS_Localized flag set (see --structures--),
                you are _required_ to supply a corresponding localizer
                function, or GF_CreateGUIA() will fail.

                The hook will be called with the following message:

                LocaleHookMsg (defined in include/guifront.h)
                {
                    UWORD lhm_Kind :

                        This field indicates what kind of data GUIFront wants
                        you to localize. More precisely, it indicates which
                        field in the embedded union is valid:

                        LHMK_StringID means lhmd_StringID is valid
                        LHMK_GadgetSpec means lhmd_GadgetSpec is valid
                        LHMK_NewMenu means lhmd_NewMenu is valid

                    union (lhm_Data)
                    {
                        ULONG lhmd_StringID :

                            Return the catalog string with this id.

                        GadgetSpec *lhmd_GadgetSpec :

                            Return a localized string for the label of this
                            GadgetSpec. Note: If this GadgetSpec is a
                            CYCLE_KIND or MX_KIND, your localizer may be
                            called several times in order to localize the
                            individual cycle or mx items. GUIFront does this
                            by calling your localizer once for each item to
                            localize, with lhm_Kind == LHMK_StringID and
                            values from the initial string array in
                            lhmd_StringID. For example, consider the following
                            CYCLE_KIND gadget:

                            -------------------------------------------------

                                TAG_DONE
                            };

                            GadgetSpec myccyle =
                            {
                                CYCLE_KIND, {0,0,0,0, CATID_MyMode, NULL,
                                             GID_MYCYCLE, PLACETEXT_LEFT},
                                mycycletags,

                            During the call to GF_CreateGUIA(), your localizer
                            will be called four times for this gadget:

                            lhm_Kind          lhm_Data
                            -----------------------------------------------------

                        struct NewMenu *lhmd_NewMenu :

                            Return a localized string for this
                            NewMenu. You are expected to return
                            a string with the following format:

                            "\0Label":
                                Menu label is "Label", no shortcut
                            "LLabel":
                                Menu label is "Label", shortcut is '<amiga>L'
                            "~f1\0Label"
                                Menu label is "Label", shortcut is 'f1'.
                                Note that extended shortcuts are only
                                available under V39+
                    } lhm_Data

                GUIFront will supply a pointer to the current GUIFront in the
                object field when calls your hook (In other words, GUIFront
                does a CallHookPkt(yourHook, &thisGUIFront, &localehookmsg);)

    RESULT

        Returns pointer to a GUIFront anchor structure for this GUI if
        everything was successfully created, or NULL on error (typically
        not enough memory). Use GUI_ExtendedError to obtain a more
        precise specification of the nature of the error which occurred.

    NOTES

        If the resulting GUI is too large to fit on the screen the routine
        will try topaz/8 before failing entirely.

        Note that this function is relatively slow. If your application is
        one which opens and closes its GUI several times during its lifetime,
        call this function only once, and then use GF_SetGUIAttrA() to
        open and close the GUI (see GUI_OpenGUI).

    EXAMPLE

        The following is an bare-bone example illustrating what a layout
        tag list looks like. Note the terminating TAG_DONE!

        ULONG GF_GetGUIAttr(GUIFront *, ...);

    FUNCTION
        Generic Get... function used to obtain information about a GUI.
        This is the only supported way of reading data from the GUIFront
        structure. Do not poke directly into the GUIFront stucture, or
        your application may break under a future version of the library.

        See TAGS for a list of supported tags.

    INPUTS
        guifront - As returned by CreateGUIA()
        taglist   - pointer to a tag list which controls this function

    TAGS
        GUI_UserData - (ULONG *) User data
            Returns whatever value you poked into the UserData field in the
            GUIFront structure (see GF_SetGUIAttrA()).
        GUI_Window - (struct Window *) Pointer to GUI window
            Returns the current Intuition Window pointer for this GUI. If the
            GUI window is not currently open, NULL is returned.
        GUI_ActualFont - (struct TextAttr *) Copy of current TextAttr
            Returns a copy of the TextAttr which was actually used for
            the gadgets of the GUI. Useful if you need to manually Text()
            in some characters in the same font as the GUI is actually
            using. (V37.3)
        GUI_MenuStrip - (struct Menu *) Pointer to menu strip
            Returns the menu strip associated with this GUI (or NULL if no
            menu strip is currently attached). You can use this tag to
            temporarily remove the menu of GUI (ClearMenuStrip()).
        GUI_OpenGUI (BOOL) - Window open flag
            Returns TRUE if your GUI window is currently open, and FALSE
            otherwise.
        GUI_LeftEdge (short *) - Left edge of GUI window
            Returns the current left edge of the GUI window. You could
            obtain the same info by peeking in the Window structure (see
            GUI_Window), but this way is easier in some cases.
            Note that if the GUI is not currently open, this tag is
            ignored. (V37.3)
        GUI_TopEdge (short *) - Top edge of GUI window
            Returns the current top edge of the GUI window. You could
            obtain the same info by peeking in the Window structure (see
            GUI_Window), but this way is easier in many cases.
            Note that if the GUI is not currently open, this tag is
            ignored. (V37.3)

    RESULT
        Returns number of tag items which were actually filled.

    INPUTS
        guifront - As returned by CreateGUIA()
        taglist   - pointer to a tag list which controls this function

    TAGS
        GUI_UserData (ULONG) - User data
            You may store any value here.
        GUI_ExtraIDCMP (ULONG) - Extra IDCMP flags
            This tag can be used to temporarily change the IDCMP intuition
            flags for your GUI. This is useful if your application suddenly
            needs to listen to events such as IDCMP_DISKINSERTED. To unlisten
            for IDCMP_DISKINSERTED evens again, call this function with
            {GUI_ExtraIDCMP, 0}.
        GUI_OpenGUI (BOOL) - Open and close the GUI window
            This tag controls the state of your GUI. Specifying a nonzero
            value will open your GUI (if it isn't already open), and
            specifying a value of zero closes the GUI (if it isn't already
            closed). As of V37.3 a GUI will reopen at the position it was
            at when it was last closed (as opposed to always opening under
            the mouse pointer).
        GUI_LeftEdge (short) - left edge of GUI (V37.3)
            The desired left edge of the GUI. In this context this tag is
            used in connection with GUI_OpenGUI to explicitly position a GUI
            under the mouse pointer in stead of at the position at which it
            was last open. Specify a value of -1 to (horisontally) place the
            GUI under the mouse pointer.
            Note: This tag has no effect if the GUI is already open (not until
            your GUI is re-opened, anyway).
        GUI_TopEdge (short) - top edge of GUI (V37.3)
            The desired top edge of the GUI. In this context this tag is
            used in connection with GUI_OpenGUI to explicitly position a GUI
            under the mouse pointer in stead of at the position at which it
            was last open. Specify a value of -1 to (vertically) place the
            GUI under the mouse pointer.
            Note: This tag has no effect if the GUI is already open (not until
            your GUI is re-opened, anyway).

    RESULT
        Returns number of tags which were actually set.

        the appropriate gadget activation routine. It also completely handles
        shift-cancellable button gadgets.

    INPUTS
        guifrontapp - The GUIFront application anchor structure, as obtained
                      with GF_CreateGUIAppA(). Note that you will be getting
                      messages from every open GUI currently connected to this
                      application. To find out which GUI a certain message
                      belongs to, examine imsg->IDCMPWindow->UserData to obtain
                      a pointer to the corresponding GUIFront structure.

    RESULT
        Returns pointer to intution message, or NULL if no more messages
        are available.

    NOTES
        This is a replacement call for GadTools' GT_GetIMsg(). If you want
        automatic hotkey processing, you must use this replacement call.
        On second thought, forget about using GT_GetIMsg() altogether. If you
        do, and if the user has selected to use simple window refreshing for
        your application, your windows won't be properly refreshed.

    BUGS
        None known.

    NAME
        GF_Wait - Replacement call for exec's Wait() (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        signals = GF_Wait(guifrontapp, othersignals);
                          A0           D0

        ULONG GF_Wait(GUIFrontApp *, ULONG);

    FUNCTION
        This function waits for a message to arrive at the window port of
        your application, or for one of the supplied signals to become set.

    INPUTS
        guifrontapp  - The GUIFront application anchor structure, as obtained
                       with GF_CreateGUIAppA(). Note that you will be getting
                       signals for events from every open GUI currently
                       connected to this application.

        othersignals - Alternative signals to cause GF_Wait() to return

    RESULT
        Returns signals which became set (several may be set when this
        function returns)

    NOTES
        This function will block your application until one of the signals
        occur. If for some reason this never happens, your application will
        remain forever blocked.

    SYNOPSIS
        GF_ReplyIMsg(intuimsg)
                     A0

        void GF_ReplyIMsg(struct IntuiMessage *);

    FUNCTION
        Reply a modified IntuiMessage obtained with GF_GetIMsg(). If you use
        GF_GetIMsg(), use this function where you would normally have used
        exec.library/ReplyMsg().

    INPUTS
        intuimsg  - As returned by GF_GetIMsg()

    NOTES
        This is a replacement call for GadTools' GT_ReplyIMsg(). If you want
        automatic hotkey processing, you must use this replacement call.

        Only use GF_ReplyIMsg on messages returned by GF_GetIMsg().

    NAME
        GF_SetAliasKey - Define hotkey alias (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        success = GF_SetAliasKey(gui, rawkey, gadgetid)
                                 A0   D0      D1

        BOOL GF_SetAliasKey(GUIFront *, UBYTE, UWORD);

    FUNCTION
        This function can be used to map rawkeys to function as
        keyboard shortcuts for selected gadgets. Typically, you would
        use this function to map RETURN/ENTER to the gadget representing
        the "default choice" (a "Cancel" button, for example).  When the
        user presses the alias key, your application will receive a GADGETUP
        message corresponding to the gadget for which the key is an alias.
        Alias keys for BUTTON_KINDs are also shift-cancellable, just like
        normal gadtools shortcut keys.

    INPUTS
        gui      - As returned from GF_CreateGUIA()
        rawkey   - Rawkey number of key to define as alias
        gadgetid - ID of gadget you want 'rawkey' to activate

    RESULTS
        TRUE if setting up alias key was successful, FALSE otherwise.

    NOTES
        Alias keys can be mapped to gadget which already have gadtools
        keyboard shortcuts (e.g. "_Use").

    BUGS
        None known.

    EXAMPLE
        The following makes the RETURN key map a gadget with id "GID_USE":

            GF_SetAliasKey(myGui, 0x44, GID_USE);

    NAME
        GF_BeginRefresh - Begin refreshing friendly to GUIFront (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        GF_BeginRefresh(gui)
                        A0

        void GF_BeginRefresh(GUIFront *);

    FUNCTION
        Invokes the intuition.library/BeginRefresh() function in a manner
        friendly to both GadTools and to GUIFront.  This function allows you
        to refresh a GUI from a generic refresh callback hook, such as the one
        used in connection with ASL_IntuiMsgFunc. It is not intended for use
        anywhere else. Call GF_EndRefresh() function when done.

    INPUTS
        gui - As returned by GF_CreateGUIA()

    NOTES
        Again, you only need this function if you are using requesters other
        than those supported by GUIFront (GF_AslRequest() and
        GF_EasyRequestArgs()), which supports callback hooks. GUIFront takes
        care of all normal window refreshing, including its own ASL
        requesters.
        Your hook should look something like this:

        struct Hook refreshhook =
        {
            {NULL, NULL},
            (ULONG (*)())refreshfunc,
            NULL, NULL
        };

        __saveds __asm void refreshfunc(register __a0 const struct Hook *hook,
                                        register __a2 APTR req,
                                        register __a1 struct IntuiMessage *imsg)
        {
            if (imsg->Class == IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW)
            {
                GUIFront *gui = (GUIFront *)(imsg->IDCMPWindow->UserData);

                GF_BeginRefresh(gui);
                GF_EndRefresh(gui,TRUE);

    FUNCTION
        Invokes the intuition.library/EndRefresh() function in a manner
        friendly to both GadTools and to GUIFront. Call this function to
        end the refreshing process when you have used GF_BeginRefresh().

    INPUTS
        gui - As returned by GF_CreateGUIA()
        all - TRUE when done with refreshing

    NOTES
        See GF_BeginRefresh() for an example of how to write a refresh

    FUNCTION
        Change the attributes of the specified gadget, according to the
        attributes chosen in the tag list. If an attribute is not provided
        in the tag list, its value remains unchanged.

    INPUTS
        gui   - As returned by GF_CreateGUIA()
        gad   - Gadget to modify
        tags  - GadTools-compatible modification tags (note: GETALT_KIND
                currently does not support any modifiable tags)

        tags_gotten = GF_GetGadgetAttrs(gui, gadget, ...)

        ULONG GF_GetGadgetAttrs(GUIFront *, struct Gadget *, ...);

    FUNCTION
        Retrieve the attributes of the specified gadget, according to the
        attributes chosen in the tag list.  For each entry in the tag list,
        ti_Tag identifies the attribute, and ti_Data is a pointer to
        the long variable where you wish the result to be stored.

    INPUTS
        gui    - As returned by GF_CreateGUIA()
        gadget - Gadget to obtain information about
        tags   - GadTools compatible list of tag values to obtain. In
                 addition to these you may also obtain information on
                 GETALT_KINDs:

                 ALT_AslRequester (void *)

                     The variable pointed to by ti_Data will be set to point
                     to the ASL requester structure allocated by GUIFront
                     during the call to GF_CreateGUIA(). The actual type of
                     this pointer depends on the GETALT subkind. An
                     ALTI_GetFile or ALTI_GetDir subkind will return a pointer
                     to a FileRequester, an ALTI_GetFont subkind will return
                     a pointer to a FontRequester and an ALTI_GetScreenMode
                     subkind will return a pointer to a ScreenModeRequester.

    RESULTS
        tags_gotten - The number of tags actually filled out by GUIFront.
                      Make sure you check that this value matches what you
                      are expecting, since unfilled tag values usually point
                      to old data, or even to garbage.

    NOTES
        GadTools' GT_GetGadgetAttrsA() only works from V39, but the function
        provided here works even under V37.

        void GF_LockGUI(GUIFront *);

    FUNCTION
        Lock the window of a GUI so it no longer accepts user input. The only
        functions left to the user are depth arrangement, window dragging and
        zipping. All gadgets will be un-selectable. It will also get the
        standard wait pointer set. The pointer at the time of locking will be
        restored when the window is unlocked (this will *not* happen on
        Kickstart V39 or higher!).
        Attempting to lock a GUI which is already locked will still succeed.
        A nesting count is maintained and incremented for each call to the
        function, and only when the count reaches 0 is the GUI actually

    SYNOPSIS
        GF_LockPrefsList()

        void GF_LockPrefsList(void);

    FUNCTION
        This function can be used to obtain an exclusive lock on GUIFront's
        internal application preferences list. The list should be locked prior
        to traversing it with GF_FirstPrefsNode() and GF_NextPrefsNode(), to
        prevent the list from changing midway through it.

    NOTES
        Your task will be put to sleep until the lock can be obtained. If this
        will never be possible, your task will never wake up.
        This function is not normally used by GUIFront programmers.

    NOTES
        Calling this function without having obtained the lock in the first

    FUNCTION
        This function returns a generic handle for the first application on
        the preferences list. The handle itself is private, but you can use
        GF_CopyAppID() to obtain the name of the application using the
        preferences associated with the handle. This name can then be used to
        obtain information about the actual preferences settings for this
        application (via GF_GetPrefsAttrA()), or it can be used to modify them
        using GF_SetPrefsAttrA().

    RESULTS
        handle  - A generic preferences handle.

    NOTES
        You should make sure the preferences list is properly locked before
        attempting to call this function.

    NAME
        GF_NextPrefsNode - Find next preferences node (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        new_handle = GF_NextPrefsNode(prev_handle)
                                      A0

        PrefsHandle *GF_NextPrefsNode(PrefsHandle *);

    FUNCTION
        Given one preferences handle, this function returns a handle on the
        next preferences application node in memory. It should be clear to
        everyone that for this to work properly, the preferences list must
        first be locked with GF_LockPrefsList().

    INPUTS
        prev_handle - As returned by a previous call to GF_FirstPrefsNode()
                      or GF_NextPrefsNode()

    RESULTS
        new_handle  - A generic preferences handle (the next one in the chain)

    BUGS
        None known.

    NOTES
        This function is not normally used by GUIFront programmers.

    EXAMPLE
        See GF_FirstPrefsNode() for an example of how to do a complete
        scan of the preferences list.

    NAME
        GF_CopyAppID - Copy application ID of preferences node (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        GF_CopyAppID(prefshandle, buffer)
                     A0                  A1

        void GF_CopyAppID(PrefsHandle *, char *);

    FUNCTION
        Given a private preferences handle (as returned by GF_FirstPrefsNode()
        or GF_NextPrefsNode()), this function copies the name of the
        application using those preferences to a buffer supplied by you.
        This is the only link between a `PrefsHandle' and GF_GetPrefsAttrA()
        and SetPrefsAttrA().

    INPUTS
        prefshandle - As returned by a previous call to GF_FirstPrefsNode()
                      or GF_NextPrefsNode()

        buffer      - string buffer (50 chars max) to store the Application
                      ID associated with this prefshandle (an empty string is
                      returned for the default prefs ("", not NULL))

    BUGS
        None known.

    NOTES
        This function is not normally used by GUIFront programmers.

    NAME
        GF_GetPrefsAttrA - Obtain preferences attributes (V37.2)
        GF_GetPrefsAttr  - Varargs stub for GF_GetPrefsAttrA() (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        tags_gotten = GF_GetPrefsAttrA(appid, tags)
                                       A0     A1

        int GF_GetPrefsAttrA(char *, struct TagItem *);

        tags_gotten = GF_GetPrefsAttr(appid, ...)

        int GF_GetPrefsAttr(char *, ...);

    FUNCTION
        This function is used to obtain information about individual
        preferences attributes for any particular application. For each item
        in the tag list, ti_Tag indicates the id of the attribute you wish
        to inquire about, and ti_Data designates a place to store the result.

    INPUTS
        appid   - Application ID of prefs to ontain information about (as
                  returned by GF_CopyAppID()). (An empty string ("") indicates
                  the current default preferences)

        tags    - A tag list of preferences attributes to obtain. Supported
                  tags include the following:

                  PRF_GadgetScreenFont (BOOL *)

                      Your supplied BOOL will be set to TRUE if the application
                      uses the current screen font for gadgets, and FALSE if
                      it uses a custom font (see PRF_GadgetFontName and
                      PRF_GadgetFontYSize)

                  PRF_GadgetFontYSize (UWORD *)

                      The UWORD pointed to by ti_Data will be set to the size
                      of the custom gadget font. It is safe to ask about this
                      tag if the application does not use a custom font.

                  PRF_GadgetFontName (char *)

                      The string of max 50 chars pointed to by ti_Data will be
                      set to the name of the custom font used for gadget labels.
                      If the application does not use a custom font, your
                      string will be set to "\0" (i.e. an empty string).

                  PRF_FrameScreenFont (BOOL *)

                      The BOOL pointed to by ti_Data will be set to TRUE if
                      the application uses the current screen font for its
                      frame headlines, and FALSE if it uses a custom font
                      (see PRF_FrameFontName and PRF_FrameFontYSize)

                  PRF_FrameFontName (char *)

                      The string of max 50 chars pointed to by ti_Data will be
                      set to the name of the custom font used for frame
                      headlines.  If this application does not use a custom
                      font, your string will be set to "\0" (i.e. an empty
                      string).

                  PRF_FrameFontYSize (UWORD *)

                      The UWORD pointed to by ti_Data will be set to the size of
                      the custom frame headline font.  It is safe to ask about
                      this tag if the application does not use a custom font.

                  PRF_FrameFontBold (BOOL *)

                      The BOOL pointed to by ti_Data will be set to TRUE if
                      frame headlines are rendered in boldface, and FALSE
                      otherwise.

                  PRF_FrameFontItalics (BOOL *)

                      The BOOL pointed to by ti_Data will be set to TRUE if
                      frame headlines are rendered in italics, and FALSE
                      otherwise.

                  PRF_FrameFont3D (BOOL *)

                      The BOOL pointed to by ti_Data will be set to TRUE if
                      frame headlines are rendered in "3d", and FALSE otherwise.

                  PRF_FrameFontFGPen (UWORD *)

                      The UWORD pointed to by ti_Data will be set to the color
                      to use for frame headlines.  Note that this is the actual
                      palette index number, not, as the name might suggest, an
                      "intuition pen number".

                  PRF_FrameFontCenter (BOOL *)

                      The BOOL pointed to by ti_Data will be set to TRUE if
                      frame headlines are being vertically centered on the
                      frame, and FALSE if they are rendered above the frame.

                  PRF_FrameFontCentering (UWORD *)

                      The UWORD pointed to by ti_Data will be set to
                      PRFFC_Left if the application is using left justified
                      frame headlines, PRFFC_Center if it is using centered
                      headlines and PRFFC_Right if it is using right justified
                      headlines.

                  PRF_AllowBackfill (BOOL *)

                      The BOOL pointed to by ti_Data will be set to TRUE if
                      backfilling is allowed for this application, and FALSE
                      otherwise.

                  PRF_BackfillFGPen (UWORD *)

                      The UWORD pointed to by ti_Data will be set to the first
                      color to use for window backfilling.  Note that this is
                      the actual palette index number, not, as the name might
                      suggest, an "intuition pen number".

                  PRF_BackfillBGPen (UWORD *)

                      The UWORD pointed to by ti_Data will be set to the second
                      color to use for window backfilling.  Note that this is
                      the actual palette index number, not, as the name might
                      suggest, an "intuition pen number".

                  PRF_FrameStyleQuery (FrameStyleQuery *)

                      The FrameStyleQuery structure pointed to by ti_Data will
                      be filled out according to the current rendering mode for
                      a particular gadget.

                      A FrameStyleQuery looks like this:

                      typedef struct
                      {
                            int fsq_GadgetKind;
                            BOOL fsq_Xen;
                      } FrameStyleQuery;

                      Prior to calling GF_GetPrefsAttrA(), fill out the
                      fsq_GadgetKind field with the gadget kind you wish to
                      acquire information about (BUTTON_KIND, for example).  The
                      fsq_Xen field will then be set to TRUE if this gadget kind
                      is being rendered in "xen mode", and FALSE if it is being
                      rendered in normal (GadTools) mode.

                  PRF_XenFrameColor (UWORD *)

                      The UWORD pointed to by ti_Data will be set to the xen
                      framing color using by this application.

                  PRF_SimpleRefresh (BOOL *)

                      The BOOL pointed to by ti_Data will be set to TRUE if this
                      application uses simple refresh windows, and FALSE if it
                      uses smart refreshing.

                  PRF_Author (char *)

                      The string of max 70 characters pointed to by ti_Data will
                      be set to the author of this application, or "" (an empty
                      string) if this information does not exist.

                  PRF_Date (char *)

                      The string of max 70 characters pointed to by ti_Data will
                      be set to the date of release of this application, or ""
                      (an empty string) if this information does not exist.

                  PRF_LongDesc (char *)

                      The string of max 70 characters pointed to by ti_Data will
                      be set to a long description of this application, or ""
                      (an empty string) if this information does not exist.

                  PRF_Version (char *)

                      The string of max 70 characters pointed to by ti_Data will
                      be set to the version of this application, or "" (an empty
                      string) if this information does not exist.

    RESULTS
        tags_gotten - The number of tags actually filled out by GUIFront.
                      Make sure you check that this value matches what
                      you are expecting, since unfilled tag values usually
                      point to old data, or even garbage.

    NOTES
        This function is not normally used by GUIFront programmers.

    BUGS

        tags_set = GF_SetPrefsAttr(appid, ...)

        int GF_SetPrefsAttr(char *, ...);

    FUNCTION
        This function is used to set individual preferences attributes for
        any particular application. For each item in the tag list, ti_Tag
        indicates the id of the attribute you wish to set, and ti_Data
        the new value for the attribute. Unspecified attributes remain
        unchanged.

    INPUTS
        appid   - Application ID of prefs to change (as returned by
                  GF_CopyAppID())

        tags    - A tag list of preferences attributes to change. Supported
                  tags include the following:

                  PRF_GadgetFontYSize (UWORD)

                      ti_Data specifies the height of the custom font to use for
                      Gadget labels.  It is safe to supply this tag if the
                      application does not use a custom font for gadget labels.

                  PRF_GadgetFontName (char *)

                      ti_Data points to a string of max 50 characters,
                      specifying the name of the font to use for gadget labels
                      (complete with .font extension).  It is safe to use this
                      tag if the application does not use a custom font for
                      gadget labels.

                  PRF_GadgetScreenFont (BOOL)

                      If ti_Data is TRUE, the application will now use the
                      current screen font for gadget labels.  Otherwise, it will
                      use a custom font (as previously set by PRF_GadgetFontName
                      and PRF_GadgetFontYSize). Important note: If you set this
                      tag to TRUE, you should also specify PRF_GadgetFontYSize
                      and PRF_GadgetFontName, and these two tags should come
                      PRIOR to this tag in the tag list you supply.

                  PRF_FrameFontName (char *)

                      ti_Data points to a string of max 50 characters,
                      specifying the name of the font to use for frame headlines
                      (complete with .font extension).  It is safe to use this
                      tag if the application does not use a custom font for
                      frame headlines.

                  PRF_FrameFontYSize (UWORD)

                      ti_Data specifies the height of the custom font to use for
                      frame headlines.  It is safe to supply this tag if the
                      application does not use a custom font for frame
                      headlines.

                  PRF_FrameScreenFont (BOOL)

                      Set this tag to TRUE to make the application use the
                      current screen font for frame headlines, and FALSE to use
                      a custom font (as previously set by PRF_FrameFontName and
                      PRF_FrameFontYSize).  Important note:  If you set this tag
                      to TRUE, you should also specify PRF_FrameFontYSize and
                      PRF_FrameFontName, and these two tags should come PRIOR to
                      this tag in the tag list you supply.

                  PRF_FrameFontBold (BOOL)

                      Set this tag to TRUE to have frame headlines rendered in
                      boldface.

                  PRF_FrameFontItalics (BOOL)

                      Set this tag to TRUE to have frame headlines rendered in
                      italics.

                  PRF_FrameFont3D (BOOL)

                      Set this tag to TRUE to have frame headlines rendered in
                      pseudo-3d (with a black shadow).

                  PRF_FrameFontFGPen (UWORD)

                      This tag is used to specify the color in which frame
                      headlines will be rendered.  Note that this is the actual
                      palette index number, not, as the name might suggest, an
                      "intuition pen number".

                  PRF_FrameFontCenter (BOOL)

                      Set this tag to TRUE to have frame headlines vertically
                      centered on the frame, and FALSE to have them rendered
                      above the frame.

                  PRF_FrameFontCentering (UWORD *)

                      Set this tag to PRFFC_Left to have frame headlines left
                      justified on the frame, PRFFC_Center to have it centered
                      and PRFFC_Right to have it right justified.

                  PRF_AllowBackfill (BOOL)

                      Set this tag to TRUE to allow this application to backfill
                      its windows.

                  PRF_BackfillFGPen (UWORD)

                      This tag is used to specify the first color to use for
                      window backfilling for this application.  Note that this
                      is the actual palette index number, not, as the name might
                      suggest, an "intuition pen number".

                  PRF_BackfillBGPen (UWORD)

                      This tag is used to specify the second color to use for
                      window backfilling for this application.  Note that this
                      is the actual palette index number, not, as the name might
                      suggest, an "intuition pen number".

                  PRF_FrameStyleQuery (FrameStyleQuery *)

                      This tag is used to control frame rendering for individual
                      gadgets.

                      A FrameStyleQuery looks like this:

                      typedef struct
                      {
                          int fsq_GadgetKind;
                          BOOL fsq_Xen;
                      } FrameStyleQuery;

                      Prior to calling GF_SetPrefsAttrA(), fill out the
                      fsq_GadgetKind field with the gadget kind for which you
                      wish to set the frame rendering style (BUTTON_KIND, for
                      example).  Set the fsq_Xen field to TRUE if you wish this
                      gadget kind to be rendered in "xen mode", and FALSE if you
                      want it to be rendered in normal GadTools mode.

                  PRF_XenFrameColor (UWORD)

                      This tag is used to specify the color of the xen frame
                      box which GUIFront draws around xen-gadgets.

                  PRF_SimpleRefresh (BOOL)

                      Set this tag to TRUE if you want this application to
                      employ simple window refreshing (which is cheap in terms
                      of memory usage, but tend to refresh with a bit of
                      flicker).  Set it to FALSE to use Intuition's smart
                      refreshing scheme, which is expensive but doesn't flicker
                      at all.

    NOTES
        This function is not normally used by GUIFront programmers.

    RESULTS
        tags_set - The number of attributes actually set.

        None known.

    NAME
        GF_DeletePrefs - Delete a preferences node (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        success = GF_DeletePrefs(appid)
                                 A0

        BOOL GF_DeletePrefs(char *);

    FUNCTION
        This function deletes all preferences information about any particular
        application. When the application next starts up, it will be assigned
        all the default preferences.

    INPUTS
        appid - Application ID of prefs to delete (as returned by
                GF_CopyAppID())

    RESULTS
        TRUE if preferences were deleted, FALSE otherwise.

    NOTES
        The preferences list need not be locked prior to calling this function.
        This function is not normally used by GUIFront programmers.

    BUGS
        None known.

    NAME
        GF_NotifyPrefsChange - Set up notification on prefs changes (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        success = GF_NotifyPrefsChange(task, signals)
                                       A0    D0

        BOOL GF_NotifyPrefsChange(struct Task *, ULONG);

    FUNCTION
        This function asks GUIFront to signal a task when the preferences
        list changes. More specifically, the task will be signalled for
        each new application as it starts up. This allows a preferences
        program to keep its visual list of applications updated at all times.

    INPUTS
        task     - Task you want GUIFront to signal
        signals  - Signals you want GUIFront to send

    RESULTS
        TRUE if notification setup was successful, FALSE otherwise.

    NOTES
        You will not be notified when applications are removed from the
        preferences list by GF_DeletePrefs().

        This function is not normally used by GUIFront programmers.

    BUGS
        None known.

    EXAMPLE

        /* This example tells GUIFront to notify the current task
         * with a ^F each time the preferences list changes
         */

        GF_NotifyPrefsChange(FindTask(0), SIGBREAKF_CTRL_F);

        GF_EndNotifyPrefsChange - End preferences change notification (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        GF_EndNotifyPrefsChange(task);
                                A0

        void GF_EndNotifyPrefsChange(struct Task *);

    FUNCTION
        This function terminates preferences change notification.

    INPUTS
        task  - Task to end preferences change notification for, as
                previously set up with GF_NotifyPrefsChange()

    NOTES
        It is safe to call this function even though setting up notification
        with GF_NotifyPrefsChange() failed.

        It is imperative that the task for signalling remains running for as
        long as notification is active. Signalling a random memory location
        is not such a good idea.

        This function is not normally used by GUIFront programmers.

        GF_AslRequest - Display ASL requester friendly to GUIFront (V37.2)
        GF_AslRequestTags - Varargs stub for GF_AslRequest() (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        GF_AslRequest(requester, tags);
                      A0         A1

        BOOL GF_AslRequest(APTR, struct TagItem *);

        GF_AslRequestTags(requester, ...)

        BOOL GF_AslRequestTags(APTR, ...);

    FUNCTION
        This function puts up an ASL requester in a way which is friendly
        to GUIFront. This means GUIFront supplies all the proper refresh
        callback hooks to make the requester work with simple refreshing
        applications.

    INPUTS
        requester - As obtained with asl.library/AllocAslRequest()
        tags      - As expected by asl.library/AslRequest()

    NOTES
        In order for refreshing to work, you MUST supply a pointer to one
        of your GUI windows, using the ASL_Window tag. Any GUI window will
        do, because they all share the same message port.

        None known.

        long GF_EasyRequest(GUIFrontApp *,struct Window *,
                            struct EasyStruct *,ULONG *, ...);

    FUNCTION
        This function puts up an Intuition EasyRequest in a way which is
        friendly to GUIFront. This means GUIFront supplies all the proper
        refresh callback hooks to make the requester work with simple
        refreshing applications.

    INPUTS
        guifrontapp - As obtained with GF_CreateGUIAppA()
        win         - Reference window pointer, determines the screen and
                      title of the requester window. See notes.
        idcmpptr    - Pointer to IDCMP flags that you want to terminate the
                      requester.  This pointer may be NULL.
        arglist     - Arguments for format commands

    RESULT
        Returns 0, 1, ..., N for successive GadgetID values, for the gadgets
        you specify for the requester.  NOTE: The numbering from left to right
        is actually: 1, 2, ..., N, 0. This is for compatibility with
        AutoRequest(), which has FALSE for the rightmost gadget.
        The IDCMPFlag value is in the longword pointed to by IDCMP_ptr.
        -1 means that one of the caller-supplied IDCMPFlags occurred.

    BUGS
        None known.

    NOTE
        In order for refreshing to work, you MUST supply a pointer to one
        of your GUI windows in 'win'. Any GUI window will do, because they
        all share the same message port.

        This function will lock all GUIs of your application for the
        duration of the requester.

        Final note: If you have reqtools.library (© Nico François) installed
        on your system, this function will use it in stead of intuition.

    NAME
        GF_ProcessListView - Handle listview hotkeys (V37.2)

    SYNOPSIS
        GF_ProcessListView(guifront, gadgetspec, imsg, ordinal);
                           A0        A1          A2    A3

        BOOL GF_ProcessListView(GUIFront * const, GadgetSpec * const,
                                struct IntuiMessage * const,
                                UWORD * const);

    FUNCTION
        This function can be used to process cursor keys as listview
        hotkeys. When the user presses cursor-up, the item preceeding the
        currently selected listview item is selected. When the user presses
        cursor-down, the item proceeding the currently selected listview
        item is selected. If the SHIFT key is held down, the currently
        selected item will be advanced by the number of visible listview
        lines, until the beginning of, or end of the listview. If the CTRL
        key is held down the currently selected item will be set to either
        the first or the last entry in the list connected to the listview.
        The listview will be visually correctly updated with either
        GTLV_MakeVisible or GTLV_Top, depending on which GadTools version
        the user has.

    INPUTS
        guifront     - As obtained with GF_CreateGUIA()
        gadgetspec   - Your listview GadgetSpec (NOT the gadget itself!)
        imsg         - A message obtained with GF_GetIMsg()
        ordinal      - The ordinal number of the new, selected item.

    RESULT
        TRUE if the user pressed a valid hotkey making the currently
        selected item change.
        FALSE if the event in 'imsg' is not a RAWKEY, or if it isn't
        a cursor key (in this case, ignore the result you get back in
        'ordinal')

    BUGS
        None known.

    EXAMPLE

        if (imsg = GF_GetIMsg(myguifrontapp))
        {
            switch (imsg->Class)
            {
                case IDCMP_RAWKEY:
                {
                    UWORD ordinal;

                    if (GF_ProcessListView(mygui, &mylistv, imsg, &ordinal))
                    {

        GF_SignalPrefsVChange - Signal prefs visual change (V37.3)

    SYNOPSIS
        GF_SignalPrefsVChange(app)
                              A0

        void GF_SignalPrefsVChange(char *);

    FUNCTION
        This function dispatches a signal to an application (or several, if
        they use the same appid), indicating its preferences have been edited
        (changed). This allows the application to recreate its GUIs using the
        new preferences and so always stay "in sync" with the user's current
        preferences.

    INPUTS
        appid    - ID of application to signal

    NOTES
        This function is not normally used by GUIFront programmers. It is
        intended for use mainly in preference editors to send out signals
        to all applications when the user has changed some settings and
        presses the "test" button.

    BUGS
        None known.
