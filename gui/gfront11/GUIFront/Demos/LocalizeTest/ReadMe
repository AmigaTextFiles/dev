LocalizeTest
------------

This directory contains a fully functional localization demo. It displays
the same GUI as the 'FramePrefs' GUI in the directory above, but this time
all GUI related strings have been localized with the aid of GUIFront's
localizer callback hook.

I've included a danish catalog for you to try out, but you can make your
own very easily using the CatComp program (not included).

It should go without saying that to use and test this program, you must be
using at least Workbench 2.1 (kickstart V38 or above), and you must copy
the catalog files of the languages you want to use from the included
catalog directory to your own LOCALE:Catalogs/ directory.
