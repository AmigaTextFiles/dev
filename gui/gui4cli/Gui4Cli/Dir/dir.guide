Dir.gc is a nice little file manager made with the Gui4Cli language. 
It's fast, it's small, it's easy and it features pop up windows for 
executing it's commands, so that the mouse travelling distance is as 
short as possible.

@node DirButtons


------------ The buttons :

P = Parent dir
R = Root dir
D = Device list
A = Select All
N = Select None
F = Show the favourites list (see below)

> = Open the other half of the window and display the other LV also.
x = Switch left <-> right listviews.
= = Set the other LV to the same dir as the source LV.

+ = Add current dir to Favourites (see below)
R = Reload current directory
< = Shift right
> = Shift left

Note that there is no set "source" or "destination". The Source is
allways the ListView which was most recently clicked upon. This may
be confusing at first but I'm trying to be intuitive here, so give
me a break..

The pop-up gui which opens when you click the right mouse button
will show you which LV is source and which destination.

Favourites :
------------
The favourites listing which you get when you click on the F
button, can be extended with the '+' button.

When this button is clicked, the current dir that the LV is at
will be added to the Fav listing, if it does not already exist.

The Fav listing is kept in file - guis:tools/fav/DirDef

The entry will be appended to this file like so:

DirName	[tabs>>>]			FullPath

When the entry is clicked on, the last part of the line will
be cut off (i.e. the FullPath part) and the LV will change
to this directory.

If instead of the FullPath the word "TITLE" is found, then 
nothing will be done - this is so that you can have titles.

The guis:tools/fav/DirDef file can be edited and changed
to get the look you like, and add titles etc.

@node Guis

----------- The Guis :

This is just to explain some of the peculiarities of the guis that
pop-up.

             @{" Calculator " link Calculator}
             @{" Avail      " link Avail}
             @{" Lock       " link Lock}
             @{" PPShow     " link PPShow}
             @{" GfxCon     " link GfxCon}
             @{" XPK        " link XPK}


@endnode
-------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Calculator

Calculator : (File guis:tools/calc.gc)
--------------------------------------

This is a full calculator with a ticker tape etc, which uses ARexx
to calculate the result. Click on the RMB and the window will open
up and provide you with a ticker tape display. Click on any line
in the listview, and the main calc window will be updated with the
value on that line.

This GUI is actually an independent gui and can be operated by itself 
if needed, or attached to any other guis you make.

@endnode
-------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Avail

Avail : (File dir/dir.avail)
----------------------------

This is a confusing GUI. It is meant to show you how much memory
is used up by various programs you run. However, it saves the
memory display into a little file in ram, so it does not allways
show it correctly (The difference is about 8 bytes). 

If you want a true memory count, click on "flush" and then on the 
"avail" and "reset" buttons repeatedly, until you get a 0 in both
the displays. Then run the program you want to check and then
click on "avail". The memory used should be displayed correctly.

It helps a lot if you know what you're doing..

@endnode
-------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Lock

Lock : (File dir/dir.lock)
--------------------------

This is a lock. When clicked upon, a full screen borderless window
will appear, with a text-in gadget in it.

Input the pass code you want and press enter.
The text-in gadget will go blank and the window will stay there
and not go away unless and until you re-enter the pass code you
entered the first time.

@endnode
-------------------------------------------------------------------
@node PPShow

PPShow : (file dir/dir.ppshow)
------------------------------

Hit the PPShow button and you'll get a gui which will play 
all selected picture/anim files in order, with the settings
you have given in the gui.

You MUST have the PPShow program (by Nico Francois) in your c: dir.

Although this gui is only for the PPShow viewer, with a little
tampering of the script file you can change it for any other player
you prefer. The options (Speed, resolution etc) will be similar,
so the changes will be few. 

@endnode
-------------------------------------------------------------------
@node GfxCon

GfxCon : (File dir/dir.gfxcon)
------------------------------

To run this gui you need the GfxCon picture converter from Aminet.
Once you get it, configure dir.gc again, assigning the DEF.GFXCON
variable to the name&path of the program and you're off..

@endnode
-------------------------------------------------------------------
@node XPK

XPK packer/unpacker
-------------------

This gui was sent to me by Brian Jones of Canada and here's what he
has to say about it :

Dir.xpack needs xPack (from the XPK distribution in the c drawer)
in C: to function. 
It also assumes you have done a normal XPK installation with
xpkmaster.library in LIBS: and all the sub-libraries in
LIBS:Compressors.

Choose the files to be packed or unpacked in either ot the Dir.gc 
listviews and click the XPK Pack button. Choose a packer (RAKE is 
default) and packing efficiency, check your list of files to be 
packed and press GO.

To get a new selection of files, choose them in Dir.gc then hit the 
Reload button.

If you choose Unpack with the Pack/Unpack cycler button the list
of packers disappears because XPK chooses the correct depacker
automatically.

Passwords are supported but not well trapped, if something won't
unpack it probably needs a password (but it won't tell you).
Also, not all xpk sub-libraries support password encoding so
if you are trying to apply a password and it won't work, the 
sub-library probably can't use one.

xPack will allow you to keep the original file and add a new extension
to the packed file. I didn't support that because I see no reason to
keep the large original when I'm packing to save space. If you want
the original back it up first. Someone could add it though.

xPack by default will not pack an already packed file. I like this,
I don't have to keep track of what's packed or not in a drawer. I just
do a pack on everything and let xPack sort it out. Also by default
it puts FORCE (force packing on a packed file) on if you are using a 
Password (ie. you're trying to encode packed files) so I saw no need to 
support the force option. Again, that's something that could be added if 
someone has a hankering to do a Delta run before a Huffman run (or 
whatever).

In the script is a reference to IP, a transparent XPK handler. A very
good program. If you use it, uncomment those two lines and edit them to 
point to your IP executable or else IP will interfere with unpacking. 
IP unpacks XPK'd files and hands them to any program whether that program 
reads XPK or not. Allows you to pack nearly everything, mods, pictures, 
anims, guides and docs... I think it's only available at the authors web 
site, URL http://kalahari.ton.tut.fi/~k-p (he does HippoPlayer).

@node config

Click on the right mouse button, then on "More..". 

Then click on "Config" and you'll get a gui where the default players
for each type of file will be shown. Most of their uses are pretty 
obvious, but listed hereunder for purely historical reasons..

DEF.EDITOR    = full path of your favourite editor
DEF.MULTIVIEW = full path of your Multiview prog.
DEF.GUIDE     = The full path of your amigaguide program
DEF.HEX       = a binary file viewer such as "FileX" from Aminet.
DEF.ILBM      = a normal amiga IFF picture viewer
DEF.ANIM      = an ANIM player (note - all these could be the same)
DEF.GIF       = a GIF player
DEF.PNG       = Like GIF but better
DEF.JPG       = a viewer specifically for JPGs, such as FastJpg

DEF.GFXED     - Your favorite image processor                 
DEF.PAINT     - Your favorite paint prog (I'll bet it's DPaintV)
DEF.GFXCON    = the full path & name of "GfxCon V1.8"
                (a program for converting pictures - available on aminet)
DEF.8SVX      = a 8SVX sound player such as "playsound"
DEF.SAMP      = a Sample player - maybe the same as DEF.8SVX
DEF.MOD       = a Module Player such as "Proplay2.exe" or hippoplayer
DEF.PP        = for power-packed files
DEF.HTML      - AWeb, or other web browser.

DEF.AVI       - the more modern PC movie format
DEF.MPG       - MPEG movies
DEF.QT        - QuickTime movies, the predominant format on the Mac.
DEF.MPGA      - MPEG audio, there are a number of players available now

@node tips

These are some things that you should know..


------------ Changing the Screen :

Use CONTROL-J to switch to the next available public screen. The Gui
together with all the acompanying pop-up guis will go to that screen.

------------ Using it with icons :

The window of the file manager is an AppWindow. Drag icons into it
and it will change to the directory of the icon dragged. This is also
true for the AppIcon that appears when the gui closes.

------------ Changing the font :

The font the LV's use is topaz 8, but you can change it to any font 
you like. Only it should be a monospaced font, otherwise the alignment
will not look correct. To change the font, edit the Dir.gc
file and change the GadFont command of the 2 ListViews. Go on..
I know you can do it..

------------ Setting the window size you want :

The file manager window is resizable. You can resize it to the size
you want and then set this size as the default size the manager will
allways open with, by pressing CONTROL-W and clicking on the "BIG" 
button. The LVs may not look very good at some sizes. This is because
GadTools automatically sizes the LV to show the max No of lines
it's able to.

------------ DoubleClicking on a file :

In this case, a small gui will open allowing you to decide what to do
with the file chosen. The top choice is "Auto". This calls a routine
which resides in file guis:tools/ViewFile.g. 
This routine will check the file type and run it accordingly, using 
the default player programs you have defined in 'Config'

You can change this file in anyway you like, but be sure you understand
how it works..

@node made


You know how many programs have file requesters ?...

Well, you can think of this as a requester which has many programs.

It is a very good idea to look at the scripts. You will not 
understand most of it, but you will get a general feeling of what's
going on.

HOW TO EXPAND IT :
------------------

When you click the right mouse button, then "More..", you will see
a button called "User..". Hitting this button will load and display
an empty pop-up button window, like the normal ones.

You can assign any other GUIs you want to these buttons.

The file of this GUI is dir/dir.user

Load it and take a look..

It's best not to use/alter the other buttons, as I'm going to be
expanding the file manager, and next versions may overwrite your
changes.
