@NODE AddFrames

ADDFRAMES    Alias [NumberOfFrames]

   This command will add frames to an anim *OR* a picture.
   If it's a picture, it will become an anim.

   If you do not give the number of frames to add, then 1
   frame will be added. Otherwise, as many as you state, or
   as many as memory will allow.

   NOTE: Anim must be in @{" LoadAll " LINK "LoadAll"} mode.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Anload

ANLOAD   FileName Alias Start Length Direction

   This command will load an animation in @{" LoadAll " LINK "LoadAll"} mode.
   This mode has the advantage that the animation can be played 
   forward, backward or ping-pong and that it can be edited, i.e.
   cropped, flipped, resized, rotated, etc as well as saved.

   Start  - is the number of the frame to start at

   Length - is the number of frames to load. You can give -1
	    if you want ALL the frames (or as many as possible)
	    to be loaded.

   Direction can be: FORWARD, BACKWARD or PINGPONG

   ex (Gui4Cli):
   > Call gcview ANLOAD DH0:MyFile MyAnim 0 -1 PINGPONG

   In LoadAll mode, animations can also be played faster.

   Note that you can also load the animation normally and then
   load all frames on the fly, by hitting F6 (see shortcuts)

@ENDNODE
@NODE CLI_opts

   ToolTypes and Options
--------------------------------------------------------------
   GCView is a programmable viewer, so most preferences can
   be sent to it as commands. It can also recognise several
   ToolTypes and CLI options, however these are limited at
   the moment. 

   The ToolTypes are stored in GCView's icon and are the same
   as the CLI options :

   - FILE,DELAY/N,HIRES/S,LORES/S,LACE/S,MONITOR,VCENTER/S,
     SCROLL/S,POINTER/S

   where :

   FILE    Is the name of the file (no wildcards etc - maybe later..)

   DELAY   How long to show each picture for (default is forever -
           or till the user clicks the right mouse button)

   HIRES
   LORES
   LACE    Are keywords you can give to force the respective modes

   MONITOR With this option you can manually enter the MonitorID you
           want used (see @{" modes " LINK "modes"}). By default, GCView will try to get
           the monitor id that the Workbench is using or use the 
           DEFAULT_MONITOR_ID. This works, so you best leave it alone.

   VCENTER Center pictures vertically. Pictures will always be centered
           horizontally.

   SCROLL  This is not working very well yet. It will scroll larger
           screen pictures whenever you move the mouse. Pictures are
           always scrolled if your pointer reaches the end of the
           screen - this is just more .. whatever..


... more options may be added later..


@ENDNODE
@NODE Close

CLOSE	 Alias

   Close the screen & window. Does *not* free the picture - i.e
   the picture (bitmap etc) will remain in memory, ready to be 
   used elsewhere.



@ENDNODE
@NODE Copy

 COPY    Alias ToAlias

   Copy a picture or part of it onto a new picture.

   If you have drawn an Edit Box, then the part you have 
   marked will become a new picture named "ToAlias"

   If no editbox, then the full picture will be cloned.

   IMPORTANT :
   If "ToAlias" already exists, it will be unloaded and this 
   new one will take its place, and no warning will be given.


@ENDNODE
@NODE Create

CREATE   Alias Width Height Depth [ViewMode]

   Will create a new empty picture (bitmap), with the size and
   depth you give. The bitmap will be clear. The palette will
   be set to a grey scale (you can @{" set a palette " LINK "Set"} afterwards)

   If you give a @{" ViewMode " LINK "modes"}, it will be used.

   You may give 0 for Width or Height - this will mean that the
   picture is only a PALETTE - i.e. it will have no bitmap. The
   number of colors depend on the Depth..


@ENDNODE
@NODE Crop

CROP     Alias

   Crop a picture or animation to the size that you marked with
   the edit box. If you haven't marked anything, gcview will flash
   the screen in righteous indignation..

   (also done with the 'C' key)

   Note: Anims must be in @{" LoadAll " LINK "LoadAll"} mode

@ENDNODE
@NODE DelFrames

DELFRAMES    Alias Frame [NumberOfFrames]

   This will delete the specific frames of an animation.
   If you give a [NumberOfFrames] then this number of frames
   will be deleted, starting at "Frame".

   If you delete *all* frames (eg: DelFrames pic 0 1000)
   Then the anim will be converted to a picture. You can never
   delete *all* frames. At least the 1st frame will remain..

   NOTE: Anim must be in @{" LoadAll " LINK "LoadAll"} mode.



@ENDNODE
@NODE DelNotify

DELNOTIFY     Event

   This will remove a @{" Notify " LINK "Notify"} event, if found.
   Nothing will be done if the event is not found.

   ex:  DELNOTIFY RMB

   If more than one of the same type of event is installed, 
   only the last one given will be deleted.


@ENDNODE
@NODE DTNote

   NOTE on datatype pictures:
   ----------------------------

   - Datatypes usually return non-displayable bitmaps (it's all
   to do with memory alignment requirements and other magic stuff).

   That's usually alright, since GCView will allocate another 
   (displayable) bitmap and blit the one onto the other and display
   it. That's how you're supposed to use datatypes.

   However, if the picture is very large there may not be enough chip
   memory to allocate another bitmap..

   In this case GCView will throw caution to the wind and go ahead
   and display this "non-displayable" bitmap, in LoRes-Lace mode,
   since that is the highest mode that it can be displayed at (at
   least on my A1200-030). 

   Higher modes (Hires etc) will cause the picture to disapear (the
   system is not fast enough to fetch the data in time or something).
   GCView, however, will act as if everything was ok - i.e. it will
   pretend it's displaying the picture when, in reality, it showing
   nothing - thereby confusing the hell out of everyone..

   Solution :

   - Get the latest akJFIF, akPNG and akTIFF datatypes from Andreas
     R. Kleinert, which have addressed this problem.

     You must run the prefs and choose accordingly -or- just make a
     file called ENV:datatypes/akJFIF.prefs, containing the words:

     -> "DISPLAYABLE_BM8=ON"



@ENDNODE
@NODE Execute

EXECUTE CommandFile

  This is a powerful command that will take the file given,
  and execute the commands it finds therein, one after the 
  other.

  The file must start with "GCVU". This must be the 1st thing 
  in the file, so that GCView can recognise it.

  After that, you can have a list of commands to be executed.
  You can leave blank lines in between command lines.
  If a line starts with a ";" character it will be ignored.

  example file :

  ------start
  GCVU

  ; Note: My kick-ass picture loading routine

  load ram:somepic MyPic
  open MyPic
  rexx Gui4Cli 'update MyGui 1 "Showing picture"'

  ------end of file
  



@ENDNODE
@NODE Flip

FLIP     Alias HORIZONTAL/VERTICAL

   Flip a picture or animation horizontally or vertically. 
   (also done with the '7' & '8' keys, respectively)

   Vertical flipping is optimized for speed. You got to see
   it to believe how fast it is! 

   Note: Anims must be in @{" LoadAll " LINK "LoadAll"} mode

@ENDNODE
@NODE G4C_coms

   Gui4Cli Commands :
-----------------------------------------------------------------
   The following commands are only available in Gui4Cli:

   GIVE	 GCView_Alias  G4C_Alias

      Will give the picture to Gui4Cli, by attaching it to Gui4Cli's
      image list. The picture will no longer be available to GCView.
      It will now belong to Gui4Cli and must be unloaded with the
      FreeImage command. It can be used as any other picture. The 
      "G4C_Alias" is the alias the picture will have in Gui4Cli.

      ex: (from Gui4Cli) - CALL gcview GIVE MyPic MyGCPic


@ENDNODE
@NODE GetColor

   GETCOLOR   Alias R G B

   With this command you can ask gcview to tell you the color
   number of the color that matches closest the values you give.

   R, G and B are Red, Green and Blue values, from 0 - 255.

   The result will be available as with the @{" INFO " LINK "Info"} command
   and will be :

      ColorValue R G B

   ex: Call gcview GetColor MyPic 200 200 200

   Now the $$call.ret (Gui4Cli) or RESULT (arexx) variables will
   contain something like

      122 210 220 190

   ..meaning that GCview thinks that the closest match for the
   color values you asked, using MyPic's palette is color No 122,
   whose actual RGB values are 210 220 190



@ENDNODE
@NODE Info

   Info
------------------------------------------------------------

INFO	 Item  Alias/ObjectName

   Get some info about the given picture. The information will
   be returned to you:
   - in Gui4Cli  in the $$call.ret internal variable
   - in ARexx    in the RESULT variable

   These are the things you can get info on:

   ---------------------------------------------------------
   Using the <Alias> of a picture: (eg: "Info Width mypic")
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   WIDTH    - the picture's width
   HEIGHT   - it's height
   DEPTH    - it's depth - i.e. number of bitplanes
   COLORS   - number of colors the picture has
   SIZE     - Width Height and Depth (eg "320 250 8")

   ANIM     - Frames StartFrame FramesLoaded FramesPerSec CurrentFrameNumber
              (if not in LoadAll mode, FramesLoaded=0)

   ---------------------------------------------------------
   Other things you can info:
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   BOXSIZE  [no arguments] 
     - Return: LeftEdge TopEdge Width Height
     of the Edit Box i.e. the area you have marked in a picture.
     eg: Info BoxSize =will get you=> 10 10 300 100
     If no area has been marked you'll get "" (empty string)

   PUBSCREEN ScreenName
     - Return: LeftEdge TopEdge Width Height Depth MenuBarHeight
     of the named public screen (ScreenName is case sensitive)

   TEXT "Some text"
     - Return: Length Height Width Baseline TxSpacing FontName
     of the text you give. Length is the length, in pixels, that the
     given text would take up. The others are the font size information.
     TxSpacing is normally 0, unless you change it with the SET command.


@ENDNODE
@NODE Installation

   Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------

   It's really easy :

   - Basically copy GCView anywhere in your path. 
     (If you have Gui4Cli then guis:c would be a good place)

     If you want to run the gui, you *must* have Gui4Cli v3.7+
     GCView itself can be in your path somewhere, or in the same
     dir as the GCView.gc gui.

   - Copy the guide anywhere.

   - Copy the IFF.library to libs:

   -------------------------------------------------------------

   You don't need Gui4Cli (version 3.7+) to run GCView (only it's
   gui which is independent and optional), but it's such a nice 
   program, it'd be a crying shame not to get it.. :)

   You can find it at:
   - AMINET under dev/gui/Gui4Cli.lha
   - http://users.hol.gr/~dck/gcmain.htm




@ENDNODE
@NODE Intro

   Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------

   GCView uses Datatypes and/or the IFF.library (by Christian A. 
   Weber) to display and manipulate all types of pictures as well
   as ANIM5 type animations.

   It can be used as a normal picture viewer but more importantly
   it can understand a rich command set sent via Gui4Cli or ARexx,
   and can be programmed to do a lot of things, as well as react
   to user defined actions.

   It has a lot of features like :

   - mark and crop pictures or anims
   - resize, flip, remap and rotate pictures or anims
   - tile or mirror-tile pictures or anims
   - show anims backward or ping-pong
   - add text, brushes and graphics to the picture
   - change resolution on the fly (even with anims)
   - change palette brightness & contrast
   - Pan pictures seamlessly
   - Save pictures in iff format and anims in anim5 format

   - React to user actions (mouse clicks, key strokes..)
   - Execute batch files with commands

     and more...




@ENDNODE
@NODE Line

LINE	 Alias StartX StartY EndX EndY 

   Will draw a line from StartX, StartY to EndX, EndY, 
   using the current FgPen.


@ENDNODE
@NODE Load

LOAD     FileName Alias [Palette]

   Load a file (IFF, @{" DataType " LINK "DTNote"} or ANIM) and call it "Alias". 
   An Alias is a given name which you can thereafter use when
   talking to GCView. It can be the file name or anything.

   If you give the [Palette] keyword, then only the file's
   palette will be loaded. This palette can then be given to
   other pictures via the "Set" command.

   Animation will be loaded for playing. If you want them to
   be loaded for *editing* you must load them in LoadAll mode
   with the @{" AnLoad " LINK "Anload"} command.

   Note:

   GCView keeps an internal list of loaded pictures, anims, 
   palettes etc.

   When you load something, the file is opened and read in, the 
   bitmap(s) allocated etc. and it's ready to be displayed as fast
   as you can say "Open". Since all these bitmaps are in chip memory
   however, expect to run out pretty fast..


@ENDNODE
@NODE LoadAll

   Animations LoadAll mode
------------------------------------------------------------

   Animations are usually decoded from the file they are in
   or from a place in ram where their compressed data is kept,
   *while* they are being played. This way you can play anims
   of almost any size.

   That way however you can't do much with them since the
   frame bitmaps are continuously being reconstructed.

   GCView can also load animations in "LoadAll" mode, which
   means that it will load all frames (or as many as you tell
   it, or as many as it can before running out of memory)
   and keep them in memory as different bitmaps.

   GCView can also store the bitmaps in FAST memory, so your
   precious CHIP memory will not be used up. You can load
   an animation as large as your FULL memory capacity.

   This way you can do a lot of neat things with an animation,
   like play it backwards or ping-pong, or crop, resize, flip, 
   rotate, tile it etc as well as save it..

@ENDNODE
@NODE Move

MOVE     PUBSCREEN/SCREEN  Alias/ScreenName Left Top

   Move a PUBSCREEN or a gcview picture (SCREEN) to Left Top.
   ex:  move pubscreen Workbench 0 150
   Note that pubscreen names are case-sensitive.


@ENDNODE
@NODE Next

NEXT

   Will display the next picture in gcview's internal list - or 
   start from the beginning again if this is the last one.



@ENDNODE
@NODE Notify

   Notification
-------------------------------------------------------------
   This is important - It allows gcview to work interactively 
   with Gui4Cli or ARexx.

NOTIFY	    Event PortName Command 

   With this command you can instruct GCView to notify you when 
   something that you want to be notified about (eg. a mouseclick)
   happens. The things you can ask to be notified about are:

   LMB	    Left mouse button clicks
   RMB	    Right mouse button clicks
   R##	    Pressing of a RAW key (arrows, Fkeys etc)
   V##	    Pressing of a VANILLA key (all letters, numbers etc)

      - For the keypresses you must give the Code number of the
	key you want (in decimal) - ex: V32 (the space key)
      - For VANILLA keys this is the ASCII code of the letter.
      - For RAW keys :
	 - F1=80 -> F10=89, Help=95
	 - Arrows: up=76, dn=77, left=79, right=78, 

      * Gui4Cli, when in debug mode, will tell you the key code.
   
   Example (Gui4Cli) :
   > Call gcview NOTIFY RMB 'gosub  mygui.gc  myRMBroutine'
   - will gosub the given routine in the given gui, every time you 
     press the RMB while viewing a picture with GCView.

   With ARexx AFAIK you must create a port and WaitPacket() etc..
   Note: PortName (and ScreenNames) are case sensitive!

   IMPORTANT :

   If you give a same notify event more than once - say, if you
   called NOTIFY RMB.. 2 or more times - then both will be stored,
   but only the last one given will be executed.

   If this is removed (with the @{" DELNOTIFY " LINK "DelNotify"} command), then
   the previous one will become valid again.. and so on..

   I.e these notify events are stacked, so you can install a 
   request, and then remove it and the previous one (if any)
   will be undisturbed.




@ENDNODE
@NODE Open

OPEN	 Alias [Behind]

   Open the screen and input window and render the picture.

   If the [Behind] keyword is given, then the screen will
   remain behind all others (hiden) until you bring it to
   the front by calling OPEN again without [Behind].
   
   Note that the picture must be loaded first..


@ENDNODE
@NODE Pan

PAN  Alias [MIRROR] [VERTICAL]

  This is a weird command, only for pictures.

  It will alocate an extra wide or high screen, tile or (mirror-
  tile if the MIRROR keyword is given) the "Alias" picture onto 
  it and then move the screen left or right, (or up/down if VERTICAL 
  keyword is given) making it seem like it's a camera panning.

  By default the tiling is simple, but to get a smooth, seamless
  panning effect it's best to use MIRROR tiling.

  The scrolling can be controlled in 2 ways :

  Up Arrow   - increase speed
  Down Arrow - decrease speed
               (note: these 2 are global and will be remembered)

  F1 to F9   - set the number of pixels that the screen position
               is advanced each time. The default is 1 (or F1).
               F9 will, for example, set the jump to 9 pixels,
               thereby greatly increasing the speed.

  Left Arrow  - pan towards the left
  Right Arrow - pan to the right

  This command will construct the screen on the fly and free
  it once you click the RMB or press escape. Lots and lots of
  chip memory is needed, so try not to have other pictures
  loaded if you want to pan large 256 color pictures.


@ENDNODE
@NODE Paste

PASTE    Alias ToAlias Left/-1 Top/-1 [FillType]

   Paste a picture (no anims) onto another picture *or* anim,
   at Left Top.

   If either Left or Top are -1, they will be taken from
   the EditBox you've drawn, if any, or else 0s will be used.

   You can give one of 4 FillTypes :

   - BRUSH   This is the default.
             Alias will just be pasted whole at Left, Top.

             IMPORTANT - BRUSH paste will be masked - i.e. the
             background of the brush will be transparent. The
             others, below, will not be masked.

   - STRECH  Will strech Alias to the size of the EditBox and
             paste it.

   - TILE    Will simple-tile Alias into the EditBox.

   - MIRROR  Will simple-tile Alias into the EditBox.


@ENDNODE
@NODE Quit

   Quit
   ------------------------------------------------------
   GCView keeps an internal counter of "users". 

   When you first run the program, you are user No 1. Thereafter
   other programs who need gcview can "Register" themselves,
   increasing the "user" counter.

   Then, when you issue a quit command, GCView will check first
   and if the user counter is not 0, it will *not* quit (unless
   Forced to do so)

QUIT	 [Late]	  [Force]

   Quit GCView, unloading all currently loaded pictures, palettes
   etc. If you give the [Late] keyword, then GCView will quit
   only when all pictures have first been unloaded by the user
   and it finds itself with nothing else to do.

   As explained above, GCView will not quit if there are still users
   who have REGISTERed themselves with it. You can use use the [Force]
   keyword to force it to quit immediately. You can also use the
   [Force] to move objects and defeat darth vader and stuff..

REGISTER

   This command will add a user - i.e. increase the internal gcview 
   "user counter".


@ENDNODE
@NODE Rect

RECT	 Alias LeftEdge TopEdge RightEdge BottomEdge

   Will draw a filled rectangle using the current FgPen color
   that you have set with the SET PENS command.

   Also, if you SET PENS with an OUTLINE mode, the rectangle
   will have an outline colored with the BgPen.


@ENDNODE
@NODE Remap

REMAP    Alias ToAlias

   Remap a picture to an other picture's palette.
   If "ToAlias" is not the same resolution as "Alias" then "Alias"
   will be transferred to a new bitmap of the same depth.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Rename

RENAME   Alias OtherName

   Rename a picture (change the alias name, not the actual file's
   name. You'll need this command, believe me.


@ENDNODE
@NODE Resize

RESIZE   Alias NewWidth NewHeight

   Resizes picture or animation to the new sizes you give.

   Note: Anims must be in @{" LoadAll " LINK "LoadAll"} mode

@ENDNODE
@NODE Rexx


REXX PortName Command

  With this command you can send an ARexx message to a Rexx
  port of another program (such as Gui4Cli for example).

  It is very useful in @{" batch files " LINK "Execute"}, so that you can notify
  Gui4Cli (or some other program) that you have finished
  processing some file, or that something else happened..

  The command is sent asynchronously.



@ENDNODE
@NODE Rotate

ROTATE   Alias RIGHT/LEFT

   Rotate a picture or animation clockwise (RIGHT) or anti-
   clockwise (LEFT)
   (also done with the 'R' & 'r' keys, respectively)

   Note: Anims must be in @{" LoadAll " LINK "LoadAll"} mode

@ENDNODE
@NODE Save

SAVE     Alias Filename

   Will save the given picture as a standard IFF file (regardless
   of whether it was a JPEG or anything else), or, if it's an
   animation, in ANIM5 format (that's what dpaint uses)

   The file will be saved at the current viewmode. If the bitmap is 
   deeper than the number of planes that your system can display 
   (usually 8) only the displayable planes will be saved (since they 
   are the only ones being shown).

   Note that to save an animation it must (currently) be in LoadAll 
   mode - i.e. all the frames already loaded.

   You can also save the currently displayed picture or anim by hitting
   <S> or <CONTROL-S> for more options. See @{" shortcuts " LINK "Shortcuts"}.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Scala_coms

  SCALA commands

  This command is for use with Scala.

  SCPALETTE Alias ScalaPalette

     Will read in a Scala PALETTE command (as these appear in Scala
     scripts) and set Alias's palette accordingly.



@ENDNODE
@NODE Set

   SET
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   With SET, you can set various parameters.
   Note that all the commands start with SET - i.e :
      G4C   > Call gcview SET Font Courier 13
      ARexx > Address "gcview"; SET FONT Courier 13

   PALETTE  Alias PaletteAlias

      Will overlay "PaletteAlias"'s palette over "Alias"'s.
      If PaletteAlias has less colors than Alias, the rest of
      Alias's colors will remain unchanged.

   FONT	    FontName Height Mask

      Declare the font you want to use for rendering text.
      Default is Topaz 8..

      ex> Set FONT Courier.font 13 000

      The Mask argument is a series of 3 numbers each of which
      can be either 1 or 0 -> 1 = ON, 0 = OFF. Their meanings:
      - Underline, Bold and Italic
      => so "011" is bold and italic, not underlined

   PENS	    FgPen BgPen JAM1/JAM2/COMP/INVERSE/OUTLINE

      Set the color number to be used as the Foreground pen (FgPen)
      and the BackGround pen (BgPen). These pens will be used to
      draw text, boxes, lines..

      The drawing mode can be:
      JAM1    - use only the FgPen and leave the background untouched
      JAM2    - use both FgPen and BgPen
      COMP    - Complement each pixel color
      INVERSE - Invert the bg/fg fields
      OUTLINE - Outline the font with the bg color.

   TXSPACING  Pixels

      Set the amount of pixels to leave between each letter when
      rendering text. Default is 0. If you declare an OUTLINE mode
      (with SET PENS) you may want to increase this to account for
      the outline.

   BRIGHTNESS  Alias +-Shift

      Make a palette lighter or darker by "Shift" which is the 
      number to add to the RGB of each color. This can be -256 to 
      256. Negative means darker, positive, lighter.
      (also done with the '+' or '-' keys - '*' will reset it) 

      Example : Brightness MyPic 256  -> make everything white..

   CONTRAST  Alias +-Shift

      Same as brightness, but lighten or darken as a percentage of
      the RGB intensity of each color, so as to make it more or less 
      sharp - at least that's what I think it's doing.. :)
      (also done with the SHIFT '+' or '-' keys - '*' will reset it) 

   VCENTER  ON/OFF

      Set this to ON, to have pictures which are shorter than the
      height of the screen, centered vertically. Default is OFF.

   MODE    Alias Mode

      Set the display mode for given picture.
      The display mode is a number (usually in hex) which describes
      the viewmode & monitor you want to display the picture at.

      All the numbers you can give are @{" listed here " LINK "modes"}.
      (Copied from the C includes)

      Example:  Set Mode MyPic 0x00008004
      - Show MyPic at HiRes-Lace resolution

   POINTER  ON/OFF

      Show/Hide pointer - default = hiden. You can also hit 'P'

   COLOR    Alias ColorNumber R G B	** not working yet **

      Will change the color number of the screen that "Alias" is 
      open on to the given RGB (0-255) value.

      As an added bonus, you can give #ScreenName to change the
      colors of a given screen :
      -ex: call gcview set #Workbench 0 155 20 250

   DELAY    Alias Seconds

      Set the time that the picture should be displayed for, in
      seconds.

   LOOPS    Alias NumberOfLoops (-1 means forever)

      Set the number of loops an animations should play for. If you
      give -1, the anim will play forever.

   SPEED    Alias [+-]AnimSpeed (in Fames/Sec)

      Set the play speed of the anim (1 - 50). If you give 0 then 
      the anim will play at maximum speed.

      You can also give a + or - in front of the AnimSpeed. This 
      will INCREASE or DECREASE the speed: 
        > Set Speed MyPic +2
      will increase the current speed by 2 fps.

   FRAME    Alias [+-]FrameNumber

      Will set the current frame of an animation. As with the speed,
      you can also give a + or - in front, meaning that the frame
      should be advanced or taken back by so-and-so frames.

   JUSTIFY  CENTER/LEFT/RIGHT

      Will set the mode in which which all text will be drawn.
      The limits used are taken from the EditBox, or if not
      available, the full picture size.

   GRID     X  Y (ratio - give 0's to turn off) 

      Whenever you press the Right Mouse Button (RMB) while you
      are drawing an edit box, the box size will, by default, be 
      forced to a ratio of X=5 to Y=4. This is the ratio for PAL
      screens (640x512 or 320x256). You can change these X,Y values
      with this setting - ex: SET GRID 800 600



@ENDNODE
@NODE Shortcuts

   Shortcuts
----------------------------------------------------------------
   These are the keyboard shortcuts you can use while gcview is
   displaying a picture/anim. Note that you may declare other
   actions for these keys with the @{" Notify " LINK "Notify"} command.

-  The following actions will be taken by default:

   Mous Buttons - (Pictures or Anims) :
   ------------------------------------

   LMB  - Mark an area for cropping - called an "EditBox". 
          Click and hold the left mouse button, dragging it around 
          to mark an area in the picture or anim. If an animation 
          is being played it will be paused.

   RMB  - If pressed while you also have the LMB pressed - i.e. while
          you are drawing an EditBox, then the size of the EditBox
          will be forced to conform to a 5 x 4 ratio (this can be
          changed with the <SET GRID X Y> command).
          - Otherwise, the pic/anim will be closed.

   Pictures *OR* Animations:
   -------------------------

   1	 - show in LORES (change resolution on the fly)
   2	 - show in HIRES, LACED
   3	 - show in SUPERHIRES, LACED
   .	 - (full stop) Toggle INTERLACE
         Be sure to read this note on @{" datatypes " LINK "DTNote"}.

   +	 - Lighten palette
   -	 - Darken palette
   *     - Reset palette brightness to original

   SHIFT + More contrast
   SHIFT - Less contrast
   SHIFT * Reset contrast to original

   P     - Show/Hide pointer


   Pictures *OR* Animations in @{" LoadAll " LINK "LoadAll"} mode:
   ----------------------------------------

   X     - Flip picture Horizontally (also '7')
   Y     - Flip picture Vertically (also '8')

   C     - You must first select an area by click-dragging the mouse.
           Then hit 'C' - the picture/anim will be croped (or cliped) 
           to the marked area.

   t     - Tile a picture or anim - You must mark an area which will
           then be tiled to the full picture. (also '4')

   T     - (capital T) - Mirror Tile a picture or anim (again.. mark an 
           area first) - (also done by hitting '5')

   R     - Rotate 90 deg. clockwise
   r     - Rotate 90 deg. anticlockwise

   Z     - (z or Z) - Zoom selected area to full screen view. If you
           have not selected an area, the whole picture will be zoomed.

   S     - Save picture as "T:GCPic.xxx" in IFF format.
   CTR-S - (Control S) - Save picture over the original one, or with an
           "iff" extension - a system requester will appear asking you 
           to confirm your actions.

   Animations :
   ------------

   ARROW - LEFT   - decrease anim speed
         - RIGHT  - increase speed
         - UP     - full speed
         - DOWN   - default speed (in DPAN chunk)

   ()    - increase/decrease playback by tiny amounts

   F6    - Start @{" LOADALL " LINK "LoadAll"} mode - will stop and load all anim frames (or
           as many as chip memory allows) so that you can play the anim
           backwards and ping-pong.
   F8    - Play anim forward (default)
   F9    - Play anim backwards (only in LOADALL mode)
   F10   - Play anim ping-pong (only in LOADALL mode)

   W     - Toggle WaitTOF() - This is a dangerous option. Before each
           frame is displayed GCView will call the WaitTOF() function
           which waits for the top of the next frame before proceeding.
           In turbo mode WaitTOF() is not used, resulting in faster
           or at least different playback, but may trash some graphics..


@ENDNODE
@NODE Text

TEXT	 Alias Left Top Text

   Will render text onto the picture or anim.

   The "Text" will be renreder at "Left", "Top" using the current 
   Font, FgPen, BgPen and drawing mode (see the @{" SET " LINK "Set"} command)

   The Text will be automatically word-wrapped at the border.

   If you have drawn an edit box, the text will be word-wraped to
   fit into the edit-boxes dimensions.

   If you give -1 for Left or Top, then the Edit box's Left and
   Top values will be used. So you can have a routine where you just
   draw an edit box, and say TEXT MYPIC -1 -1 "Some text" and the
   text you give get's placed and word-wrapped into the box.

   If you set the OUTLINE mode, an outline will be drawn by striking
   the letters in the BgPen shifted by 1 pixel in each direction
   and then striking the body in the center with the FgPen.



@ENDNODE
@NODE Tile

TILE     Alias [ToAlias] [MIRROR]

   Tile a picture or an animation. If the MIRROR keyword is given,
   the tiling will be mirrored and look great. Takes longer though..

   [ToAlias] is optional and only valid for pictures. If given, 
   then Alias will be tiled onto ToAlias.

   Otherwise, you must have selected an area in the picture. The
   contents of this area will then be tiled to the full picture.
   (also done by pressing 'T' for mirror, or 't' for normal).

   Note: Anims must be in @{" LoadAll " LINK "LoadAll"} mode

@ENDNODE
@NODE Tranzit

      TRANZIT   FromAlias ToAlias Effect Speed

   This will allow you to make a nicer tranzition from one
   picture to another. 

   "FromAlias" MUST already be open. "ToAlias" must be already
   be loaded and may also be open. If it's not open it will be.
   Speed is a number from 1 - 10.

   The following effects are currently possible:

      FADE

   Will FADE FromAlias to all black, then fade ToAlias from black 
   to normal color.

   ex: > Tranzit Pic1 Pic2 FADE 5




@ENDNODE
@NODE Unload

UNLOAD	 Alias/#ANIM/#PIC/#PAL/#ALL [Late]

   Unload a loaded file.

   If, instead of the alias (the given name) of a file you give any
   of the keywords shown above, then the following will happen:
   #ANIM    - All animations will be unloaded
   #PIC     - All pictures will be unloaded
   #PAL     - All palettes will be unloaded
   #ALL     - All files (all types) will be unloaded

   If [Late] is given, then the file will be unloaded when the
   user has finished playing with it (i.e. when he clicks RMB)
   Otherwise it will be closed & unloaded immediately.

@ENDNODE
@NODE View

VIEW	 FileName Alias

   Will LOAD and OPEN a picture/anim and when the user finishes
   playing with it will automatically CLOSE and UNLOAD it.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Zoom

ZOOM     Alias X Y Width Height

   Zoom is an easy way to resize pics or LoadAll anims.
   You give the part of the Alias bitmap that you want zoomed
   and GCView will automatically fit this part into the screen
   at Alias's current resolution.
   (also done with the 'Z' key)

   Note: Anims must be in @{" LoadAll " LINK "LoadAll"} mode
