	Gui4Cli extension examples
	=======================================

 Note that some of these program appear in 2 versions - a normal 
 one and  another with an _NS added at the end. This means that 
 it is writen in a way that you can use the SAS compiler's 
 NOSTARTUP option, which will result in a smaller executable. 
 To compile the NS sources, rename the SCOPTIONS_NS file to plain
 SCOPTIONS and do : sc ProgramName Link

 Included in this dir are the following programs :

 - GCTalk (and GCTalk_NS)

   This is an example of how to communicate with Gui4Cli directly.
   The program sends a GM_LOCK type message and "locks" Gui4Cli,
   manipulates some of it's internal structures and then "unlocks"
   it and lets it continue with whatever it was doing.
   
   It then also sends a simple command to Gui4Cli for execution.

 - GCHost (and GCHost_NS)

   This is an example of a "command host" for Gui4Cli. It starts
   up and creates a public message port (called MyPort) and waits
   around for commands to be sent to it from Gui4Cli. If and when
   a command is sent, it is executed (using any of Gui4Cli internal
   structures, if needed) and there may also be a result returned.

   This type of program is very usefull for adding new commands
   to Gui4Cli.

 - LVIndent

   Will lock Gui4Cli, find the "current" listview and indent it by 
   adding 3 spaces in front of each line.
