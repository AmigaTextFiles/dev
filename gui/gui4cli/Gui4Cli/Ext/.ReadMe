	EXT directory
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  This directory contains includes, example sources and
  executables for interfacing with Gui4Cli in C, using 
  Gui4Cli's own message structure.

  To understand how it works, read the Gui4Cli.h include 
  file (which you should copy to your "include:" dir)
