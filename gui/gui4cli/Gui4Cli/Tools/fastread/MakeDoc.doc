                             ------------

     A guide assembler for use with the FastRead Help System.

Introduction
------------
MakeDoc will join all specified files together into one file in the
order specified, also adding the '@database' header and inserting the
'@node' and '@endnode' lines where appropriate, making the document
readable by AmigaGuide. This makes it easy to update any individual 
node, and re compiling a new guide with MakeDoc.

The name of the specified target file will by default be used as the
database title, and each inividual file name which is selected for
joining will be used for its corresponding node title.

Requirements
------------
MakeDoc needs the Type command in C: and Gui4Cli version 3.0 minimum.

Usage and the User Interface
----------------------------
Apart from the buttons, the MakeDoc gui is composed mainly of two
listviews. The left hand lister reads in the contents of the directory
containing the files to be joined. The right hand lister holds the
names of the files which have been selected in the left hand one.
These are the files which will be operated on, and the right hand
lister is the one which does the work.

At the top of the gui is the 'Outfile' button, with a string gadget
next to it. These are for specifying the path and name of the target
file. The target file can be specified by typing directly into the
string gadget, and if a filename is typed in without a path, the
target file will be created in the same directory as the source files.
The Outfile button produces a file requester, and automatically
inserts the full path and name of the target file. The joining
operation cannot be started until a target file is specified by either
of these two methods.

Over the top of the listers are all the buttons for file manipulation.
Files from the left hand lister are transferred over to the right
lister by first selecting them and then clicking on the 'Xfer' button.
Single files can be transferred one at a time by double clicking on
them in the left lister. 

Once in the right lister, the files can be arranged in any order by
clicking on the filename in the lister and using the 'Up' and 'Down'
buttons, or pressing the U and D keys. Individual files can be erased
from the lister with the 'Remove' button, or the lister cleared at any
time with the 'Clear' button.

When all the files are in the correct order for joining, and a target
file has been specified, the 'Start' button will become active, and
the operation may be started. Until a target file has been specified
in the string gadget or by the 'Outfile' button, the Start button is
ghosted. It will ghost again when the joining operation finishes, and
the right lister and string gadget will clear.
