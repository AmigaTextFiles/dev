            @{FG fill}T h e  A m i g a G u i d e  E d i t o r.@{FG text}
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   The idea behind the Amiga Guide editor is the following:
   
   You create a directory into which you keep the Nodes of
   the guide, each in a separate file, named as the node 
   will be named inside the guide.
   
           @{FG shine}Creating a new guide :@{FG text}
   
   The first icon, the white page with the AG at the corner,
   will ask you for the name of a directory to create. If you
   give one, a dir will be created, and :
   - a gui will pop up to allow you to add @AUTHOR etc header 
     information and when you're done with that,
   - an other gui will open to allow you to edit node MAIN
     which is the one node which *must* exist in your guide.
   
           @{FG shine}Creating a node :@{FG text}
   
   You can create a node by just creating a new file in this
   directory, or by choosing the 2nd icon (the page with the
   N at the corner). This will allow you to enter various
   parameters.

           @{FG shine}Adding effects :@{FG text}
   
   Again, you select some text and hit the "fx" icon. A gui
   will allow you to add the desired effect to the text chosen.

           @{FG shine}Making buttons :@{FG text}
   
   To create buttons you can select the text that you want to
   appear as the button's title and click on the "Links" icon.
   A Gui will appear with the available choices. You can link
   to other nodes (normal) or other files, rexx programs etc.
   
   Don't make buttons that span lines!..
   
           @{FG shine}Cleaning up text :@{FG text}
   
   You can remove all Amiga Guide formating from a block of
   text by selecting it and hitting the "!@" icon.
   
           @{FG shine}Viewing the node :@{FG text}
   
   You can have a preview of the current file (node) by hitting
   the icon with the eye. A Multiview window will open on the
   CEd screen with the node properly rendered. 
   
   However, the links to other nodes will NOT work. You must load
   a complete file for that.
   
           @{FG shine}Spliting an existing guide :@{FG text}

   You can split a guide to its nodes by pressing the one before
   last, the spilt AG, and you'll be prompted to supply the name 
   of a guide and a directory. The directory will created and 
   the guide will be split into it's nodes and placed in this
   dir as small files named as the nodes in the guide were
   named.

   The header information, if any, will be placed in a file 
   called ".CBAG_Header"


           @{FG shine}Constructing the guide :@{FG text}

   When you are ready you can construct the guide by hitting
   the last button (AG with lightning). You'll be asked for
   the name and then all the nodes in the directory will be
   joined  together  properly and saved out as an Amiga Guide.
   A full INDEX of the nodes will also be constructed.

   The only requirement is that there be a node named MAIN.
   This the the first page the guide will open on. Thereafter
   all the other pages will be linked together. Note that
   if a node doesn't have a link to it, it will not be seen. 
   (except in the index..)

   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   
   - Quit (The Q)  - quit CedBar, but not CEd itself
   - Right arrow   - minimize the buttonbar
   - New           - open new blank document
   - Open          - load a document - @{U}SEE BELOW REGARDING REQUESTER@{UU}
   - Enlarge view  - (the narrow button) Maximize current doc
   - Save As..     - save as..
   - Save          - (the one that looks like a disk - almost)
   - Close doc     - (the chequered flag) close current doc. If changed,
                     you'll be asked (twice) if you want to save it
   - Cut           - cut selected text into current clipboard unit
   - Copy          - copy selected text
   - Paste         - is anyone reading this ?..
   - Clip Number   - the current clipboard unit - all cut/paste operations
                     are done to this unit. @{U}CLICK FOR CLIPBOARD GUI!!@{UU}
   - Up/Dn arrows  - change clipboard unit

                     in the next window. If there is no other ced running,
                     a new ced will be spawned.

   - Next CED      - Jump to the next ced window. All actions will now
                     be done to the next ced..

   @{FG shine}The file requester :@{FG text}
   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   For loading files I use a special Gui4Cli gui and not the normal
   ASL requester. I find this very helpfull since it has many things
   that the ASL requester doesn't have, such as Favourites dirs,
   copy/makedir/rename capabilities, easy multiselection, longer
   file listview showing more files etc.
   
   However, some people don't like it..
   
   If you are one of them and want to remove it, just delete or rename
   the file FILEREQ.GC and cedbar will use the ASL requester.

@NODE Functions
   @{FG shine}-----------------------------------------------------------@{FG text}
	@{FG fill}T h e  f u n c t i o n s :@{FG text}
   -----------------------------------------------------------

   One of the binaries accompanying CedBar.gc is called LVFormat
   This is a Gui4Cli command host, written specially to communicate
   with Gui4Cli and apply various formating to the "current"
   listview, like indentation, word wrap etc..
   
   When you select some text and hit a button, the selection is
   CUT and placed into a Gui4Cli listview (via the clipboard).
   Then this program is called which formats the listview in
   the required way and then the text is PASTEd back into CEd.
   
   It all happens very fast and works great.
   The source is included and well documented, so if you know 
   anything about C you can alter it and add to it.
   
   @{U}The functions currently, are :@{UU}
   
    - @{B}Indent @{UB}(the right arrow with lines)

      Will pop up a gui asking you what want to indent the text
      by. You can enter tabs (\t) or spaces or anything..
   
    - @{B}Unindent @{UB}(the left arrow with lines)

      Will remove all leading spaces from the selected lines,
      keeping the formating - try it and see..
   
    - @{B}WordWrap @{UB}(the W with the lines)

      Will pop up a gui requesting the line length to wrap to
      and will wrap the text to this size *intelligently*, i.e.
      if there are any leading spaces they will be left untouched.

      There are also various options you can add :

      JUST   - meaning justify the text by adding extra 
               spaces to make up the line length.
      UNJUST - remove all these extra spaces.
      CENTER - center the text (automatically unjust)
      RESET  - remove all extra spacing & indentations.

      You can also provide "Starting Characters" :

      This is a string of characters that wrap should
      consider as part of the line header. This is usefull
      for wrapping email messages etc, by giving ">/" or
      whatever your mailer uses. You don't have to give
      spaces - they're always considered as header.

      The wraping is always best on text on which a para-
      graph is denoted with 2 newline characters.

   There are currently 3 independent guis provided.

   - Dir.gc
   Will load guis:dir/dir.gc, if you have it..

   - Calculator :
   Uses Gui4Cli's mathematical abilities to provide you with
   a super-duper, do-it-all-and-then-some calulator..

   - FSearch gui :
   This is a front end of the FSearch CLI command (included)
   which will help you locate anything and load it into CEd.

@NODE Installation

   @{FG shine}INSTALLATION :@{FG text}
   ----------------------

   There is an installation script - click on it.   

   If you want to do it manually then copy the CEDBAR directory
   anywhere. It contains all the guis, binaries icons etc for the 
   button bar.

   Inside this dir there are 2 programs : "Gui" and "GuiCli"
   If you are already a user of Gui4Cli you know what to do..
   Otherwise you must COPY THESE 2 FILES TO YOUR C: directory

   Click on the CedBar.gc icon to start it.
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   @{B}If you are already a user of Gui4Cli :@{UB}

   1. This is version 3.8 of Gui4Cli. You must use this or newer
      versions for the gui to work..

   2. You probably already have an old version of CedBar. Throw
      it away. This is better. There are also extra copies of the
      FSearch.gc and Calc.gc guis included in this new CedBar.
      You may want to consolidate..

   CedBar is a button bar for the CygnusEd Editor, providing easy
   access to most of the CEd's menu functions. 
   
   It also features aditional guis and binaries (to which you can
   add), providing things like :
   
   - Text formating functions such as Indent, Unindent, Re-Wrap,
     Justify, Center etc..
   - an Amiga Guide editor, consiting of a suite of guis and
     binaries which work together to help you edit AGs with CEd
   - a calculator
   - an extensive search gui (with binary)
   - a clipboard viewer capable of handling all 256 clips
   
   It made life very easy for me and I wouldn't dream of using
   CEd without it anymore, but then I'm kind of biased :)..

	@{FG shine}The Icons :@{FG text}

   The buttons are actually icons which are stored in the
   icons directory - You can change them to your liking.
   
   The button bar has 2 types of icons:
   
   - The normal ones, on the left side, which are the most
     common functions and so are available all the time.
   
   - The last 8 icons which change everytime you click on 
     the double arrow button in the middle, rotating through
     3 sets of buttons :

     o More CEd functions such as goto, match brackets etc
     o The Amiga Guide Editor
     o Special functions (Indent etc..) and other Guis
   
   The icons are pretty self explanatory..
