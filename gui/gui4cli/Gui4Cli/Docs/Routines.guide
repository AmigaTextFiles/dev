                    * Gui4Cli Helper Guis *

  This is a description of some of the more intersting helper guis
  contained in the Gui4Cli archive, which you can use to enhance
  your own guis.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Cli.gc

  
  CLI.gc CommandLine Mode

  PURPOSE : Open a gui like the WB "Execute Command.." gui, but more.

  PATH    : @{" guis:tools/cli.gc " LINK "GUIs:Tools/Cli.gc/MAIN"}

  USE     : GuiLoad guis:tools/cli.gc CommandLine Mode

  where :

  CommandLine   is the command line you want (can be "")
  Mode          (Optional) is one of RUN, CLI, AREXX, EXEC


  Use GUILOAD to open the gui even if it's already loaded.

  The gui will open with "CommandLine" in the textin gadget, and the
  cycler set to "Mode". Thereafter the user can use it as needed.





@ENDNODE
@NODE FilePop


   FilePop  FileName

   PURPOSE: A small pop-up gui to deal with a file.
   PATH   : @{" Guis:tools/rtn/FilePop " LINK "GUIs:Tools/Rtn/FilePop/MAIN"}

   USE    : GUILOAD  Guis:tools/FilePop  FileName
            or..
            GUIOPEN  FilePop  FileName

   This gui is used in FSearch.gc and others.
   You just give it a file name and let it do it's stuff..

   It will pop-up a small window with 5-6 buttons to let the
   user decide what action to take with a file.

   The 1st button is "AUTO" which checks the file type and runs
   it accordingly, using the $DEF.PLAYERS defined.
   (see the guis:tools/config.gc gui)

   The 2nd button is "MORE..." which opens an other gui FILEPOP2
   which has more choices. These can be changed/extended as
   needed.

   After use the gui will remain in memory for faster loading if
   you want to use it some more. You have to specifically 
   GuiQuit FILEPOP to unload it.




@ENDNODE
@NODE FileReq.gc


  FileReq.gc  GuiName Routine Path FavFile

  PURPOSE : A multiselect File Requester with Favourites etc.
            Used as a replacement for the ASL requester

  PATH    : @{" guis:tools/filereq.gc " LINK "GUIs:Tools/FileReq.gc/MAIN"}

  USE     : GuiLoad guis:tools/filereq.gc  GuiName Routine Path FavFile
            or..
            GuiOpen filereq.gc  GuiName Routine Path FavFile

  where..
  GuiName  - is the name of your gui
  Routine  - is the name of a routine in your gui that will be
             called repeatedly (with gosub) for every file chosen in
             the requester. (see below)
  Path       (optional) the path you want the file requester to
             open at - if you want..
  FavFile    (optional) the full path&name of the Favourites file
             you want to use - default is guis:tools/fav/default

             NOTE: if you want to give a FavFile but not a Path, you must 
             still state the Path argument (using "")


  The file requester will let you choose files (multiselect or double click)
  and will send the files chosen back to a specified "Routine" which exists
  in file "GuiName".

  The "Routine" will be called as follows:
  --> GoSub $GuiName $Routine FileName
  i.e. you'll get the file name as the 1st argument.

  If the user selected many files, then this routine will be called 
  repeatedly for every file.

  It's very easy to use and has many goodies, such as definable Favourites
  file, delete/copy capabilities etc.

  Look at guis:g4c/ced/cedbar.gc for a working example.





@ENDNODE
@NODE FindFile

  FINDFILE  FileName
             
  Forget this one - see the EXTRACT FULLPATH command.




@ENDNODE
@NODE GetFileType


  GetFileType FileName


  PURPOSE: This routine tries to recognise the type of a given file.
  PATH   : @{" guis:tools/rtn/GetFileType " LINK "GUIs:Tools/Rtn/GetFileType/MAIN"}

  USE:
  GUILOAD guis:tools/rtn/GetFileType FileName      - or
  GUIOPEN GetFileType FileName

  This routine tries to determine the file type of "FileName"

  It will first look at the file header, then at the extension, until 
  it determines the type.

  When it returns, $$RET.0 will contain :
  - The type of file that "FileName" was, or 
  - "NONE" if there was no file, or 
  - "UNKNOWN" if the file was not one of the various filetypes defined
    in the routine (to which you can easily add..)

  The type of file is returned as a word (such as ILBM or GIF or 8SVX etc)
  See the file itself to see the exact words.

  This function is used in conjunction with guis:tools/rtn/viewfile
  to run any file according to it's type.


@ENDNODE
@NODE GetString

  @{" GetString " LINK "GUIs:Tools/Rtn/GetString/MAIN"} Title String Gui Routine Multi

  Get a string from user & pass it to $Gui $Routine given

  Use :

  GUILOAD GUIS:TOOLS/RTN/GETSTRING Title String Gui Routine Multi

  where :

  Title      is the window title you want
  String     is the starting string you want in the xTEXTIN gadget
  Gui        is the name of the gui calling the routine
  Routine    is the routine to call
  Multi      (optional) is a flag which if = "Multi" then gui will not quit
             This is used for multiple use

  This gui is used in the dir.gc file manager for the Rename, Makedir
  and Assign functions - you can see it in guis:dir/dir.g

  It opens a window with "title" and a textin gadget containing "String".
  The user will change the "String" shown in the textin gadget and when
  he presses <enter> it will call the given routine, passing the changed
  string as the 1st argument :
    GoSub $Gui $Routine $NewString

  The $Routine called must be prepared to deal with the string.

  If the "Multi" argument is declared, the gui will stay open and can
  be called repeatedly (with GuiLoad). Otherwise it will quit.




@ENDNODE
@NODE Palette.gc


   Palette.gc

   PURPOSE : This is a palette gui, for setting/saving/loading palettes.
   PATH    : @{" guis:tools/palette.gc " LINK "GUIs:Tools/Palette.gc/MAIN"}

   USE     : GuiLoad Palette.gc (it will open on it's own)


   You can use this as a palette gui anywhere.

   - The Palettes are *not* saved as normal IFF palette definitions, 
     but as GUIs.

   - They are kept in drawer guis:tools/palette

   - You can load them as follows :

         GUILOAD guis:tools/PaletteName GuiName

     where 

     PaletteName  is the name of a previously saved palette
     GuiName      is the name of your gui (i.e. the gui whose screen
                  colors will be changed).



@ENDNODE
@NODE Read.gc


  Read.gc  FileName

  PURPOSE : A text file Reader.
  PATH    : @{" guis:tools/read.gc " LINK "GUIs:Tools/Read.gc/MAIN"}

  USE:
  - GUILOAD guis:tools/read.gc FileName

  This is a window with a listview, to be used for reading text (or other)
  file. It has file search and edit capabilities.

  All you do to use it is pass it the filename you want displayed.
  If no filename is given a requester will open.



@ENDNODE
@NODE ViewFile


  ViewFile FileName FileType Mode


  PURPOSE: This routine will run "FileName" according to what 
           "FileType" it is.

  PATH   : @{" guis:tools/rtn/ViewFile " LINK "GUIs:Tools/Rtn/ViewFile/MAIN"}

  USE    : GuiLoad guis:tools/rtn/viewfile FileName FileType Mode
           or..
           GuiOpen ViewFile FileName FileType Mode

  where:

  FileName  is the name of the file you want to run
  FileType  is a word as returned from routine Guis:tools/rtn/GetFileType
  Mode      (optional) can be RUN or CLI (RUN is default)

  What you do to use it, is the following:

  Say you have a file called MyFile and you want to view it.

  1. You must run it through the GetFileType routine to get the file type 
     it is. GetFileType will return something like "ILBM" (if the file is 
     an iff picture, for example)

  2. You then call this routine.

  The name of the players used to play/run/execute etc each type of file are 
  defined as Global variables (ex: *DEF.GIF etc).

  These Global Variables are gotten through the guis:tools/CONFIG.GC gui.
