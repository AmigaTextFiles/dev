                Guide for the commands in GUIs:C
              ====================================

 These commands are used in various guis contained in the Gui4Cli
 archive. They are all pure and can be made resident. They are
 CLI commands - do not run them from the Workbench. Although they
 were writen for use with Gui4Cli, they can be used anywhere else
 too (like DirOpus, DM etc).

 CLI Commands :
 ===============

 @{" FSearch    " link "guis:g4c/fsearch/fsearch.readme/main"  } Lots of options - read them..
 @{" Rep        " link Rep      } FromFile/A,String/A,ToString/A,ToFile,I=Insensitive/S
 @{" Wrap       " link Wrap     } FILE/A,NEWFILE,L=LENGTH/K/N,TAB/K/N,P=PARA/K/N,STRIPCR/S,ADDCR/S

@ENDNODE
@NODE Add8SVX


   ADD8SVX  File1/A, File2/A

  Will APPEND (join) 2 8SVX sound samples.

  The 1st file given will be OVERWRITEN and will include both
  samples - i.e. File2 will be APPENDED to File1

  So make sure you have a backup copy of File1..



@ENDNODE
@NODE Comline


    ComLine  <command line> 

This may well be the most useless command in existence..
All it does is repeat the command line you throw at it.

It's reason for existing is for testing command lines.
(look at guis:tools/rtn/FindFile)


@ENDNODE
@NODE grx

  GRX  PORT/A, COMMAND/F/A

The purpose of this command is to send ARexx commands to the 
given PORT.

Example :  GRX Gui4Cli GuiLoad Guis:Demo.gc

I wrote this for Gui4Cli but you may use it for any program which has
an ARexx port. Just state the PORT and the COMMAND you want to send.

RexxMast need not be running.


@ENDNODE
@NODE Guide


    SplitGuide  GUIDE/A,DIR
    JoinGuide   SOURCE/A,GUIDE/A

These 2 commands were used in making the Gui4Cli guide.

Splitguide   - will split an AmigaGuide document into files, each node
               becoming a file with the same name as the node.
	GUIDE  - is the guide name
	DIR    - (optional) is the dir to place the resulting files.
		 if DIR is not declared, they will be placed in ram:

JoinGuide    - will join all the files in a directory into a complete
	       AmigaGuide document, also making an INDEX of the nodes.
	SOURCE - is the name of the DIR where the files (nodes) are
	GUIDE  - is the name of the resulting guide.

I made these because I find it a lot easier to work with small files
than with a huge 200k bugger..


@ENDNODE
@NODE ILBMSize


   ILBMSize  ILBM_FILE

  A simple command which will print out the size & depth of an
  IFF-ILBM picture.

  The output will be something like :

  > 400 200 5

  meaning : width=400 pixels, height=200 pixels, depth=5 bitplanes

  You can get the number of colours by calculating 2 to the power
  of the number of bitplanes, i.e. in the above example, the
  picture has 2 to the 5th => (2*2*2*2*2) = 32 colours 

  May come useful in scripts..



@ENDNODE
@NODE NoCR

    NoCR <FileName>

Remove all carriage returns which PC texts have.


@ENDNODE
@NODE Nodes


 GetNodes and WriteNode commands
---------------------------------------

These programs are meant to be used with the Gui4Cli help system.
They will act on AmigaGuide files.

GetNodes :
-------------
GetNodes will extract all the nodes an AmigaGuide document has and
save them in a list with the OffSet into the file and the Length
of each node.

Template :

GetNodes GUIDE/A,FILE/A

GUIDE   the name of the guide
FILE    the name of the file to save the nodes list in.


WriteNode :
-------------
WriteNode will extract the text of the given node and save it in a
file RAM:GUIDE.txt. From there, it can be read into a G4C lister.
START and LENGTH are the values saved out by GetNodes.

Template :

WriteNode GUIDE/A,START/N/A,LENGTH/N/A

GUIDE   the name of the guide
START   where the node starts
LENGTH  length of node text

The text will be formated in a non-AmigaGuide format.


@ENDNODE
@NODE ProgTime



  ProgTime <command line>

  - measures how fast a CLI command executes


  Use     : ProgTime <command line>

  ex      : Progtime Fsearch MyFile SomeString
  Result  : PROGRAM TIME : 0 minutes, 4 seconds, 15 ticks


@ENDNODE
@NODE Rep


REP is a small, fast CLI command for replacing strings in files.
It is pure and can be made resident.

This version adds the ability to define HEX and non-printable
characters in the string (read on..)

  Usage :   
-------------
> Rep FromFile/A, String/A, ToString/A, ToFile, I=Insensitive/S

  Where :
-------------
FromFile    - is the file you want to convert.
String      - The string you want to replace
ToString    - What you want to replace it with 
ToFile      - (Optional) the name of the output file. If this is 
              not given, then the INPUT FILE WILL BE OVERWRITEN!
Insensitive - (Optional) Make the search case-insensitive

  Example :
--------------
rep df0:MyFile ThisString ThatString Insensitive
- will replace all occurences of "ThisString" (or THISstring, or 
  ThIsStRiNg etc) with "ThatString" and save it over the original
  file.

"String" and "ToString" are parsed and may contain HEX, DECIMAL 
and other non-printable characters. The way to do this is:

The "\" character starts a character specification :

   \n     - is the Newline character (decimal 10)
   \r     - is the carriage return
   \t     - is the TAB character
   \\     - is the \ character itself
   \"     - is the " character
   \'     - is the ' character

   \x     - starts a HEX character string, defined by pairs
            of HEX digits (0-9,A-F) until another \ character
            or the end of the string are encountered. 
            ex: MyString\x000003F3\continues

   \#     - starts a DECIMAL character, defined by a number 
            from 0-255. Again, the number ends with another
            \ character or the end of the string.
            ex: "\#155\32mWhite text"

   Any other character will be considered literally, i.e.
   \c     - is the "c" character.

Note that some of this parsing may conflict with Gui4Cli
parsing - you may have to consider the fact that Gui4Cli will
translate the line first, *before* rep gets a chance to
parse it as above..



@ENDNODE
@NODE Small


    ComLine  <command line> 

This may well be the most useless command in existence..
All it does is repeat the command line you throw at it.

It's reason for existing is for testing command lines.
(look at guis:tools/rtn/FindFile)

    NoCR <FileName>

Remove all carriage returns which PC texts have.


@ENDNODE
@NODE Wrap


Wrap FILE/A,NEWFILE,L=LENGTH/K/N,TAB/K/N,P=PARA/K/N,STRIPCR/S,ADDCR/S

- ReWraps a text file - many options
 

FILE     = Must be given. It's the file which you want to rewrap and
           it must be a text file!

           *WARNING* - if you re-wrap a binary or a PowerPacked
           or XPK etc file, the file will become trash! 

NEWFILE  = This is the name of the output file. If it is not given,
           then the input FILE will be overwriten!

LENGTH   = The new line length you want. If this is not given, the 
           default is 1000 characters, which results in leaving
           the line length same (unless you have lines over 1000
           characters long). If the Length given is too small to 
           fit a single word, then the word will be split.
           Max length is 1000 characters.

TAB      = If this option is given, then any tabs found will be 
           dealt with in accordance with the number of spaces 
           specified, and be converted to spaces. Maximum tab size
           is 80 characters.

           *Warning* If TAB size is not declared, all tabs will be
           deleted. This is not as bad as you may imagine, since Re-
           wrapping files with a lot of tabs looks ugly anyway..

PARA     = This option is weird but usefull. It lets you define the
           number of NEWLINE characters that Wrap will read before 
           puting 1 NEWLINE character. Most text documents have a 
           NEWLINE character at the end of every line, and 2 NEWLINES 
           to denote a paragraph. 

           So if you put PARA=2 you will get much better formated text 
           because the single NEWLINE characters will be ignored.
           This option also allows you to re-wrap files to a longer
           line length than the original file.

           The default is PARA=1, i.e. leave them un-altered.
           Maximum is 30 newline characters.

STRIPCR  = Strips those PC Carriage Return charaters.

ADDCR    = Adds Carriage returns after every NEWLINE character, so
           you can tell PC users what you really think..

           By declaring both STRIPCR *and* ADDCR you could ReWrap a
           PC file and keep it in PC format.

Example : 
Wrap MyFile MyOutputFile LENGTH=60 TAB=5 PARA=2 STRIPCR
