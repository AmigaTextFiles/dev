@NODE Intro "Introduction"


@{SHINE} Please support the further development of this software and mail @{"me" link Autor} @{ENDSHINE}
@{SHINE} your opinion, problems und criticism, because the programming costs a lot @{ENDSHINE}
@{SHINE} of time (but it was a pleasure!). @{ENDSHINE}


Thank you for decrunching and the will to test the program-packet.
This program is for "revolutioning" the software-development on Amiga.

Object-oriented programminglanguage (OOP) is maybe a bit too high for that
program, because there are "real" C/C++-sourcecodes generated and
an external C/C++-Compiler must translate it into machine-code. In the Amiga-sphere
there are only less applications like CanDo, Storm-Wizard and so on, but one day
I have seen the program "Delphi" on the PC :( ! This OOP is exclusive controlable
in Pascal (that sets me up) and it has millions of configuration-possibilities.
I didn't knew such things on Amiga, and so I made it by myself.

I wanted to make parameting of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and its macro-elements
as easy as possible.
Following standard-GUI-elements are implemented:
 * Screens
 * Windows
 * OS2.0 gadgets (GadTools)
 * OS3.5 gadgets (Reaction)
 * Menus
 * Requests
 * ASL-requests
 * Locale-catalogs
Following NON-GUI-elements are implemented:
 * Functionmacros, which makes programming under OS3.5+ more easily
 * Includes
 * Libraries
 * declare variables
 * InterConnection maps between gadgets
 * create list-arrays for gadgets

With Emperor you are generating a complete C/C++-sourcecode, which only must be
compiled by an external compiler (e.g. StormC from the developer CD2.1).
There are many different files, which are including following data:

PROJECTNAME.c           Programsourcecode (compileable)
PROJECTNAME.cd          Catalog-rawdata
PROJECTNAME.h           own sourcecode
PROJECTNAME.project     projectfile for Emperor
PROJECTNAME.¶           Storm-projectfile
PROJECTNAME_SPRACHE.ct  translated catalog in rawdatas


Aim of this program is to assure software developer to create their programs (its sourcecode)
by Emperor, because the making of software (opening of windows, file- and fontrequests,
menus etc.) is often equal and must not longer copied by programmers from other sourcecodes.
Emperor decrees about one or more macros for every GUI-element. Like the menus:
here you must, for creating the complete Project-menu (open, close, save, print etc.) and its
translation, (in Locale-".catalog"-file) only select the corresponding entry in the list.
This is also possible with requests e.g. by making a QuitRequest. These are called in
the own sourcecode as function "REQUESTNAME();".

But the program should also be for amigans, who never programmed before,
and bade an easy way in the programming of AmigaOS-GUIs.

What is Giftware ?

Giftware you can copy and spread freely, as long as there is made no benefit with the program.
If you like Emperor and if you are using it you can send @{"me" link Autor} a little present.  - I'll be very
happy about everything. In return I'll offering the programpacket itself and you can have the
latest running betaversion of Emperor, long before it will be released to Aminet. I'll send
it via eMail or on a disk to you.

But the program-packet must be complete, which means there must be:

  - the program             "Emperor"
  - the startuppicture      "Emperor.pic"
  - the prefs-file          "Emperor.prefs"
  - the install-script      "Emperor.install"
  - this guide              "Emperor.guide" (english and german)
  - the template-project    "template.project"
  - the german catalog-file "Catalogs/deutsch/Emperor.catalog"
  - the french catalog-file "Catalogs/français/Emperor.catalog"
  - the raw catalog-file    "Catalogs/Emperor.cd"
  - the project-directory   "Projects/" with some prepared projects
  - the scripts-directory   "Scripts/" for interactive StormC-connection via ARexx

@NODE Install "Installation"


Please use enclosed install-skript.


If you want to install by hand, then copy the catalog ("Emperor.catalog") in the
directory "SYS:Locale/Catalogs/deutsch" or "SYS:Locale/Catalogs/français";

* create a directory called "Emperor"
* copy programfile "Emperor" into created directory
* copy startuppic "Emperor.pic" into created directory
* copy prefsfile "Emperor.prefs" into created directory
* copy guidefile "Emperor_english.guide" into created directory
* rename "Emperor_english.guide" into "Emperor.guide"
* copy scripts-dir "Scripts" into created directory (including file stormc.rexx)
* copy project-dir "Projects" into created directory (including all files)
* optionally you can copy the french or german catalog to "SYS:Locale/Catalogs/<LANGUAGE>"

Now you can use the program without an restriction.

"PROGRAMPATH:" should be the path, where you've copied "Emperor".

@ENDNODE
@NODE Start "Getting started"


The program can be started by CLI (Shell) without following arguments.

But you can also doubleclick on the icon of the program.


    There are a few things, you must pay attention on:

       * AmigaOS 3.5 installed ?
       * 4 MBytes of systemmemory must be free on startup
       * assign on <PATH>:Emperor
       * RexxMast already started ?
       * stack at >50000 bytes ?
         - under CLI:  type 'stack 50000'
         - under WB:   in iconinformations choose a stack of >50000 bytes
         - under DOpus:in menu 'Settings-Environment' choose point 'CLI-Launching' and
                       change stack !

In general the window is equal for all filing-cards.

On the left side you'll have an empty list, which should be fill by modified objects;

right from this there are some buttons:
with "Add" you can add a modified element to the own list;
with "Up"/"Down" you can move the current active entry in the own list up/down;
with "Delete" deletes the current active entry from the own list;
with "Reset list" deletes the current project;
with "Edit" opens/closes attributewindow;
with "Preview" can Emperor show, how your work looks (without compiling);

On the right side there is a list with templates for every component.

@NODE Mainwinscreens "Mainwindow - Screens - page"


This page is new since version 4.2. Here you can create screens to use in source.

Please pay attention: the prepared item "Workbench Screen" means, that the Intuition-function
"LockPubScreen(NULL)" will be called. So, just use this type single in your projects.
One screen is implemented as template: a "Workbench Screen". Surely, you can replace it by
using a "Custom Screen", whichis opening a new display (screen).
Also mixing of these two kinds is permissible.

In the attributewindow on page "Sizes" under point "Screentype" you can choose the kind
of screen, you'll generate. Possible values are following driversystems: CGX, Picasso and
original Amiga. This is available since 4.3. Please pay attention, that you have to choose
additionally the corresponding library and includes for the driversystem you choose:

@{b}CyberGraphX@{ub}
you'll need following includes:
cybergraphx/cybergraphics.h
proto/cybergraphics.h

and the "cybergraphics.library"
(choose version 40, BaseName to "CyberGfxBase", Reaction to FALSE)


@{b}Picasso 96@{ub}
you'll need following includes:
clib/picasso96_protos.h

and the "Picasso96API.library"
(choose version 2, BaseName to "P96Base", Reaction to FALSE)

@NODE Mainwinwindows "Mainwindow - Windows - Page"


On this page, you are able to configure your whole windows, which do you wish to implement
into your program.

Here you must pay attention, that the current window is marked by "Active". Which means, that
the lists of gadgets depends on your current window.
I.e., ONLY the content (gadgets) of an "Active" window could be changed anyway.

@{b} !!IMPORTANT!! @{ub}

In the attributewindow you can set, whether a window should appear in AmigaOS 2.0 or
AmigaOS 3.5 - look. If you choose the OS 2.0 - look, you aren't allowed to allocate
Reaction-gadgets to it ! Also a normal window couldn't contain any GadTools-gadgets.

@{b} !!IMPORTANT!! @{ub}

@ENDNODE
@NODE Mainwingadgets "Mainwindow - Reaction - page"


On the gadgets-page there are 3 groups of gadgets:


     *  On the left side there is an empty list, which later could be filled with the own
        hierarchical list of gadget-objects.
        The entries are at a time the names of the gadgets.
        An added gadget is putted into the next-higher "generation", and it's so
        an diverted gadget of the previous.

     *  In the middle are some buttons.

     *  On the right side there is a list with gadget-templates.
        If you are choosing an entry, the "Attribute-window for gadgets" is renewed, in which
        attributes can be set.


Aim of this "new" kind, to create surfaces is it to took more and more work from the
programmer. The positions und sizes are automatically rendered by the system,
in relation to the windowsize.
You can influence the arrangement of the gadgets, when you create vertical and horizontal
groups (Layouts). Gadgets, which belongs to a layout, must be diverted from the Layout-gadget,
which means that they appear in the list more right and form a new subclass.
But horizontal und vertical Layout-Groups can split into new horizontal
and vertical Layout-Groups.

Horizontal group means, that all gadgets are horizontally arranged.
Vertical group means, that all gadgets are vertically arranged.

        |                               there are two gadget-groups (1. String-gadget / 2. two Buttons),
        |                               which are layouted vertically.
        |

So play around with the horizontally and vertically groups, so that you are getting a feeling
for that. If you have worked with the Gadtools-Library so far, and if you have used absolute
values for sizes and positions, then the swifting around from that isn't soooo easy ! But, ...

the more you'll exercise the better you are !

@{b}ad 2 (using images):@{ub}

Images are special gadgets, which contains e.g. picture informations or system glyphs.
If you want to integrate such an image, you have to pay attention that the image is
derived from the corresponding gadget or you have to assign the image via connecting
within the attributes-window. But be careful ! You only have got possibilities to
derive an image from a button, a layout or a slider gadget !!!

An example may looks like that:

@NODE Mainwingadtools "Mainwindow - GadTools - Page"


Because GadTools only decrees about gadgets, which demands absolute positions, the
handling is a bit more complicated (or more logical ? :))).

For creation of an window with GadTools-gadgets (OS 2.0 - look), the window itself must be an
OS 2.0 - window. This could be attributed on the @{"Windows-page" link Mainwinwindows}.

Now it is important, that the window, in which the gadget will be positionized, is open.
Now you can choose on the GadTools-page the gadget that you want. And in the second step
you have to define position and size by mouseclick (and mousemove) into the window.
Subsequent changings are possible by clicking the marked areas in the edges of a gadget.
Do you want to move or resize a gadget, you can activate it by a simple click.

It is possible to generate a program based on OS 2.0 as well as based on OS 3.5,
by supportting of OS 2.0 - windows and gadgets.

@NODE Mainwinicmap "Mainwindow - Interconnection Map - Page"


Interconnection maps connect gadgets to each other. This connection makes it possible, that different
tags and its values between gadgets are exchanged.

I.e. a fuelgauge-gadget is connected with a palette-gadget; there must be clear, which tags are used.
So you can connect tag "FUELGAUGE_Level" with "PALETTE_Colour". Everytime the palette is clicked, it
will be send its new value directly to fuelgauge.

There are unidirectional and bidirectional maps;
unidirectional maps only send informations from primary to secondary gadget,
bidirectional maps will send informations from primary to secondary and from secondary to
primary gadget.

To let gadgets exchanging datas, an ICMap must be added to the own list. - without writing a single line

@NODE Mainwinpopup "Das Hauptfenster - die PopUp-Menü - Seite"


This page is an own creation of a fictitious GUI-object. That means, this object
doesn't exists in Reaction, but you can create such Popup-menus with Emperor.

It is necessary by all means, that you are choosing attributes "RMB_Trap" and "ReportMouse"
for the corresponding window !

If you add a Popup-menu, a function will be created is your own source. This function is named
"Window1_MouseButton_Right_Down_Event". The label "Window1" depends on the window, that you have
choosen. The function contains a Popup-menu-call (e.g. "PopupMenu1();"), which returns the
number of the selected item.

A Popup-menu needs following attributes:
@{b}Misc-page@{ub}
PopupMenu Name                  - name of the Popup-menu, which is use in source  (NECESSARY !)
PopupMenu Items                 - corresponding array, that contains the Popup-menu-items  (NECESSARY !)
Window                          - corresponding windowname  (NECESSARY !)
Screen                          - corresponding screenname  (NECESSARY !)
Alignment                       - alignment of the items (left, center, right)
PopupMenu Width                 - real width of the Popup-menu in pixels  (NECESSARY !)
Pulldown-menu support           - if the window supports also a normal GadTools-menu
                                  (for professionals: the "RMB_Trap"-flag for the corresponding window
                                  is automatically set on or off at "MouseMove"-event)

@{b}Style-page@{ub}
Outer bevel - Bevel State       - if the outer border appears recessed or raised
Outer bevel - Bevel Style       - style of the outer border
Outer bevel - Space             - space between an item and the outer border
Outer bevel - FillPen           - pen to use for the background of the Popup-menu

Inner bevel - Bevel State       - if the border of an item appears recessed or raised
Inner bevel - Bevel Style       - style of the inner border when an item will be selected
Inner bevel - Space             - space between an item and the inner border

A specific feature is avialable since version 4.1:
You are able to create Emperor-requester, that are based on Reaction-gadgets.
If you are looking on page "Reaction" in attributewindow, you can activate that feature by
activating "ReactionRequest". These are available for programs with generated code for OS3.5+.
Following parameters are configurable:
CloseGadget    - the request has got a closesymbol
SetBusyPointer - the mousepointer is going into "busy"-mode, if the request is inactive
Dragging       - this option makes it possible, that the request can be moved by clicking on
                 any place within it
HorizontalBar  - a horizontal line will be drawn between requestbodytext and buttons

The ckeckbox "Reaction Library" is necessary because of conception of the generated code.
It is possible to create programs based on OS2.0, OS3.5+ and programs with mixed code. If a library

@NODE Faq "FAQ"


@{b}Question:@{ub}   When I change the size of a GadTools-gadget, the border, which marks the activation,
            isn't (or just a bit) visible.

@{b}Answer:@{ub}     Probably you are using a program like VisualPrefs, which patches the visualization
            of GadTools-gadgets. If you deactivate it, it should work.
            Or you may change your border-sizes of a "String"- and "Integer"-gadgets down to
            normalsize, which does have the same effect.


@{b}Question:@{ub}   Emperor doesn't run on my system !

@{b}Answer:@{ub}     There are a few things, you must pay attention on:
            * AmigaOS 3.5 installed ?
            * 4 MBytes of systemmemory must be free on startup
            * assign on <PATH>:Emperor
            * RexxMast already started ?
            * stack at >50000 bytes ?
              - under CLI:  type 'stack 50000'
              - under WB:   in iconinformations choose a stack of >50000 bytes
              - under DOpus:in menu 'Settings-Environment' choose point 'CLI-Launching' and
                            change stack !
            To every occured error at startup should appear a request...


@{b}Question:@{ub}   In the preview-window labels and bitmaps were not shown.

@{b}Answer:@{ub}     That's an very old bug in Emperor and I'm still working on that problem ! 

@ENDNODE
@NODE Bugs "known bugs & future plans"


@{b}known bugs of the program:@{ub}

       1. The attributewindow "Datebrowser" is much too wide (when choosing a nonproportional
          screenfont) ! (but why .... ?)

       2. Labels and bitmaps aren't shown in the preview-window

       3. CHILD_xx-tags are often at a wrong place, when generating source


@{b}future plans:@{ub}

       1. Undo/Redo action for lists

       2. Checking items of the lists

       3. Saving clips has no function. (deactivated)

       4. Text- or lineformatting is not implemented yet. (deactivated)

       5. Drag'n'Drop objects

       6. Multimenu-projects (chooseable, every window gets an own menu)

       7. CGX- and Picasso96-support

       8. Support external editors

I want to thank very, very much Janne Peräaho for his nice startup-picture he made.
Also for his bugreports, to correct existing errors in Emperor.
- Thanks Janne !

Olivier Martin for his bugreports and his highend-example project "Tiger". You can
find this example in the directory "Projects" of Emperor. It is a very nice tool to show
the developing of "virtual life" on Amiga - check this out !
- Thanks Olivier !

Also I want to thank Gerd Frank very much, who helped me with his ideas and at finding bugs
in Emperor. Many of the features of version 4.2 - that's his doing.
- Thanks Gerd !


I want to say thanks very much to all the bugreporters for the thorough use of Emperor !!
