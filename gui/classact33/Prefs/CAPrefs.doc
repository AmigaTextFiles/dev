    FUNCTION

        Set up ClassAct preferences. Run this program before any
        applications that utilize ClassAct classes. A good place is
        early in the user-startup. A graphic preferences editor will
        be provided in the near future.

  AmiTrix Note: The graphic prefs editor is now present in your prefs drawer
  ============  if you allowed it to be installed.  It can be used to change
                the CA settings which will affect the look of the AWeb GUI.
                There are several new options available via these CA prefs
                that are not shown below.  See also the additional note
                below about the label pen setting.

    ARGUMENTS

        BEVELS
            GT - GadTools-like 2:1 aspect bevels. The default.
            THIN - 1:1 aspect thin bevels.

        SPACE
            Spacing between gadgets. Corresponds to pixels in
            THIN bevel mode, scaled to bevel width. Default 4.

        GADGETS
            NORMAL - standard V37 window border gadgets. The default.
            3D - with SysIHack 3DLOOK, a 3D iconify gadget.

        LABELPLACE
            LEFT - left justified group labels.
            RIGHT - right justified group labels.
            CENTER - centered group labels. The default.

        LABELPEN
            Pen number to use for labels. Default is TEXTPEN.

        LABELFONT
            Font name and size to use for group labels. Default
            is the screen/window font.

        REFRESH
            Window refresh type. Simple refresh windows take less
            memory but update slower when uncovered from behind other
            windows. Smart refresh is quicker but more memory hungry.
            Default is smart.

        PATTERN
            On OS 3.0, ClassAct window.class can automatically install
            a backfill pattern to windows, using any image understood
            by the datatypes. This option is the name of that image.

        FALLBACKFONT
            Window fallback font in case the default font is too large
            to fit the window on the screen.

    EXAMPLE

        CAPrefs BEVELS=THIN SPACE=3 LABELPEN=2 LABELFONT Times/12

  AmiTrix Note: The graphic preferences editor currently contains no pen entry
  ============  in the Group Labels window list for the LABELPEN.  This pen is
                used for the title which appears above a boxed set of gadgets
                within a ClassAct window, such as the first Window prefs area
                in the graphic preferences.  The color pen for these titles is
                selected by highlighting one of the pens in the Group Labels
                list and saving the prefs.
