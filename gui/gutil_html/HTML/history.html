<U>Changes overview:</U>

* 37.10 (28-Sep-97)
        GU_NoCreate now works on individual gadgets. Useful to create invisible
        gadgets that helps you place the other objects in the window.

        6 new tags added that will allow you to save the object's calculated left,
        top, right and bottom edge, as well as the gadget's width and height.

        E includes added to the distribution.

* 37.9  (22-Dec-96)
        6 new tags added for the help functions. It is now possible to set a default
        help text that will be shown if no gadget is under the pointer.

        GU_DefWTitle            - default window title
        GU_DefLocWTitle         - localized window title
        GU_DefSTitle            - default screen title
        GU_DefLocSTitle         - localized screen title
        GU_DefHelpText          - default help text
        GU_DefLocHelpText       - localized help text

        A little bug removed from the help routines. Versions beore 37.9 could
        display two different help text at the same time (in different gadgets or
        the screen or window title).

        A new include file is included in the distribution now. Now it should be
        possible to compile the examples with older versions of the system include
        files (OS 2.0x includes are supported now)

        A third archive with the HTML version of the GadUtil documentation is
        included in the distribution now. Also included with this archive is some
        pictures of applications using GadUtil.

        The distribution has changed a bit, resulting in that the archive with all
        files became smaller (developer archive only).

* 37.8  (15-Jul-96)
        Some bug fixes in the new help functions. If 0 was used as data on a GU_HelpText
        tag with a gadget that shows the help text in the window's or screen's title,
        there were some enforcer hits

        Deleted the separate autodoc files. Appended some information on the contents of
        the GU_Public structure to the autodocs. More info about SCRTITLE_HELP and
        WINTITLE_HELP was also appended.

        Changed the help function so that all gadgets and title bars that are used to
        display help strings is cleared if the mouse pointer is outside all gadgets that
        have help texts.

* 37.7  (12-Jul-96)
        Bug fix in the prototype for GU_ChangeStr (two parameters was mixed up).

        GU_ChangeStr now works for both STRING_KIND and TEXT_KIND gadgets. If the
        gadget isn't a STRING or TEXT gadget nothing is done.

        Bug fix in GU_CoordsInGadBox function. The register D3 was trashed in all
        earlier versions of GU.

        Three new tags allows any STRING or TEXT_KIND gadget to show a (localized)
        help text for each gadget in the window. These tags also works with the
        special gadgets (BEVELBOX, LABEL, PROGRESS). The gadgets attached to the
        window is scanned in sequential order. If a BEVELBOX_KIND gadget matches
        the pointer position, this gadget's help string will have the lowest
        priority. If another BEVELBOX is found inside this, the help string for
        that one will be used if there is no gadget inside that box. The help
        text can also be displayed in the window/screen title.

        The TEXT_KIND, STRING_KIND, NUMBER_KIND and INTEGER_KIND gadget's current
        value can now be read from the gu_Active field in the structure that
        gg_UserData points to.

* 37.6  (15-Jun-96)
        gu_Active in the structure that gg_UserData points to was not updated
        when using any routine that used GU_SetGadgetAttrsA(). Now it checks
        the gu_Active value to see if it is out of the gadget's limits.

        gng_Flags and gng_GadgetText is now cleared before creation of every
        new gadget.

        The LAYOUTA_Spacing tag for LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets is now used to
        determine the height of the gadget. If the height of a gadget should
        be about 4 lines (GU_HeightFactor, 4), the height of the gadget is
        calculated to 4*(font height+value of LAYOUTA_Spacing tag). The same
        method is used for the GU_AddHeiLines tag.

        Hotkeys for LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets works as they should again. In v37.5
        of GadUtil (and probably some earlier ones), the listview didn't scroll
        down when you selected the next entry.

        Inserted pragmas and prototypes for tagcalls (pragmas only for SAS/C).
        It is possible to create stub routines for the tagcalls for other
        compilers by using fd2pragma 2.0.

        Inserted links to the include files in the index file for GadUtil.guide.

* 37.5  (29-May-96)
        Bug in PROGRESS_KIND gadget removed. If the gadget was set to
        show x/0 (also 0/0), a division by zero was done.

        Two new constants added to the include files: GADUTIL_VER and
        GADUTIL_REV.
        
        Bug fixes in test (demo) programs. The FPF_DISKFONT flag in the
        TextAttr structure was unset in all demo programs. Replaced the
        manual version check in the demo programs with the GadUtil function
        GU_CheckVersion. Removed unnecessary IDCMP flags from the demo
        programs and replaced GadTools IDCMP with the GU_MinimumIDCMP tag.

* 37.4  (14-May-96)
        Created a new gadget kind: LABEL_KIND. This gadget kind is used
        to place text relative to other gadgets, bevel boxes, and other
        texts. Can use the same type of shadows that the text for the
        bevel box.

        Implemented a new function in the library: GU_CloseFont. Works
        like graphics CloseFont, but takes the parameter in A0 instead
        of A1.

        Replaced the list sort routine with a new one that sorts better.

        Wrote a new document, "GadUtil.index", that have a list over all
        gadutil functions, sorted by what they do. There are also some
        shortcuts to all tags for gadutil's own gadget kinds.

        Created two new flags for BEVELBOX_KIND and LABEL_KIND:
        BB_3DTEXT - can be used as a replacement for GUBB_3DText, TRUE
        LB_3DTEXT - can be used as a replacement for GULB_3DText, TRUE
        
* 37.3  (10-May-96)
        Enforcer hits fixed in the code that handles the GU_AdjustLeft
        and GU_AdjustRight tags.

        A new function to clear the inner part of a window was added.

        A new function to size (and move, if necessary) a window was
        added.

        Bug fix in assembly language include file.

* 37.2  (02-May-96)
        Started programming in StormC and did some tests with the library,
        noticed that there was a couple of errors in some include files.

        GU_UpdateProgress was wrongly specified in the FD/clib files.
        The output of GU_GetGadgetPtr was specified as (struct Gadget *),
        this is now corrected.

        Included an example in C that uses the PROGRESS_KIND gadget.

* 37.1  (01-May-96)
        IMAGE_KIND gadget bug fix. The color of the unselected image of
        the gadget was wrong, if the image used more than 4 colors.

* 37.0  (29-Apr-96)
        A new function that checks the library's revision added.
        Two new tags added: GU_FractWidth and GU_FractHeight. Suggested
        by Morten Amundsen.

        Some small bug fixes in 'C' include files (unterminated comments).
        Cleaned up BetterTest.c a bit (removed some {}). Bug fix on the
        last line of the example (GT_ReplyIMsg -&gt; GU_ReplyIMsg).

        Added support for StormC in both installer script and include-
        file installer. Created dictionary for StormC, so that all words
        that belongs to GadUtil (functions, tags and constants) is shown
        in another color.

* 36.60 (24-Feb-96)
        Uses the screen's font as the gadget font if no GU_DefTextAttr or
        GU_TextAttr tag is used. Bug fix from v36.59. Changed some docs,
        assembled all examples, changed installation scripts.

* 36.59 (06-Jan-96)
        More docs completed (all docs, finally). Bug fix in the GU_AutoWidth,
        GU_AdjustLeft and GU_AdjustRight tags. The underscore character was
        counted as a normal one. This made gadgets without hotkeys one char
        smaller than other gadgets. A new function that sorts one or two
        lists was added. Some new constants added in include files.
        Changed GU_MinimumIDCMP to support hotkeys. Changed PROGRESS_KIND
        to use GU_GadgetText and GU_LocaleText. Uses the screen's font as
        the gadget font if no GU_DefTextAttr or GU_TextAttr tag is used.

* 36.58 (01-Jan-96)
        SLIDER_KIND and SCROLLER_KIND gadgets returned wrong result in
        im-&gt;Code if the gadget was changes using the hotkey. Bug reported
        by Lukasz Szelag.

* 36.57 (10-Dec-95)
        Some more docs finished. A memory loss bug was fixed.

* 36.56 (10-Oct-95)
        Changed some routines, so that hotkeys can't be used on disabled
        gadgets. Made it possible to disable IMAGE_KIND, FILE_KIND and
        DRAWER_KIND gadgets.

* 36.55 (30-Sep-95)
        Bug fix in the hotkey part of the library. Wrong code were sent back
        when using GU_LabelHotkey with a LISTVIEW_KIND gadget. A new gadget
        kind was created, PROGRESS_KIND.

* 36.54 (06-Jul-95)
        Added support for GU_AutoWidth to CYCLE_KIND gadgets.

* 36.53 (05-Jul-95) 
        3 new tags and 4 new flags was added for the BEVELBOX_KIND gadget.
        BEVELBOX_KIND gadgets can now have a shadow added to the text in the
        border. The "sun" can be placed in 4 different places. GU_MinimumIDCMP
        tag was added.

* 36.52 (25-Jun-95)
        First public release. Some new flags for the BEVELBOX_KIND gadget was
        added. Supports a total of 100 bevelbox kinds.
