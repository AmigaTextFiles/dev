<P>
This program is a small and quite powerful timing application. It allows
you, by using TRAP instructions to measure the time of about anything.
The precision of the program is +- 0.02 seconds, and all the 16 trap
instructions can be used to start/stop the timer. The result of each pair
of start/stop is sent to the list for that trap number. The list is
changed on the "stop" event, so the user can see the result immediately.</P>
<P>
This program isn't released yet.
