<P>
ModuleInfo is a small program that will help you to change the songname,
and instrument names of a ST/NT/PT-Module. The program also has support
for unpack.library by SHI, so you can load a lot of kinds of packed
modules without having to decrunch them by hand. In the current version
of ModuleInfo you can even play the modules!! It uses ptreplay.library
to play them.
