<P>
MagicMail is a new e-mail-program that I am currently developing.

Some of the features that the program will have:

<UL><img alt=" * " src="../pics/bullet.gif" width=11 height=11>
Groups. All mails can be divided into separate groups. </UL>

<UL><img alt=" * " src="../pics/bullet.gif" width=11 height=11>
Filters. All incoming (and outgoing) mails can be automatically
divided into separate groups. You just make a filter that the
mails should match, eg if the From: - field contains a specified
address, the mail will be moved to a specified group.</UL>

<UL><img alt=" * " src="../pics/bullet.gif" width=11 height=11>
MIME support. MagicMail will have full MIME support. In the
current ßeta version only the most common MIME commands are
supported. </UL>

<UL><img alt=" * " src="../pics/bullet.gif" width=11 height=11>
MIME multipart support. MagicMail splits up multipart mails so
that uuencoded parts are not viewed as text, etc.</UL>

<UL><img alt=" * " src="../pics/bullet.gif" width=11 height=11>
Queue for all mails. You don't have to be online when you write
the mails. You can send all queued mails and get all new mails
at once when you are online.</UL>

<UL><img alt=" * " src="../pics/bullet.gif" width=11 height=11>
Sort-function. Sort by subject / sender / date&time.</UL>

<UL><img alt=" * " src="../pics/bullet.gif" width=11 height=11>
Export mails / separate parts.</UL>

<UL><img alt=" * " src="../pics/bullet.gif" width=11 height=11>
Uses one (or one per group) file for all mails. This is much
faster and much more space efficiant than having separate
files for all mails.</UL>

<UL><img alt=" * " src="../pics/bullet.gif" width=11 height=11>
Online help. Uses gadutil.library to show help for all gadgets
when moving over them.</UL>

<UL><img alt=" * " src="../pics/bullet.gif" width=11 height=11>
Does NOT use MUI!!!</UL>
</P>

<P>
Many of these features are already in the program, but as
I haven't had the time, I haven't finished it yet.
</P>

<P>
The main window of MagicMail contains the group and message lists. The
other gadgets in the window is used to switch to read mode, move, delete,
send, get and send&get messages.
