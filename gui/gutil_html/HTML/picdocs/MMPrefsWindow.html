<P>
The preferences system consists of several child processes to the main
prefs window of MagicMail. This allows you to edit the group list while
having the filter window opened at the same time. MagicMail will have
unlimited number of groups and filters. The "Account" preference window
allows you to set up multiple e-mail (POP) accounts, and check all
accounts at the same time when looking for new mail.
