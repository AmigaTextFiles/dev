 ~~~~~~~
	* Wrote an installation program for the include files (uses AskEnv).
	  The program can install and uninstall all include files that belongs
	  to GadUtil (two different assemblers, 4 C-compilers).

	* Fixed some small bugs in clib/gadutil_protos.h (I forgot to insert
	  GU_ before some of the routine names).

	* Started to rewrite the big test program (BetterTest.s) to C. All
	  data structures was finished. A lot of fuss with (ULONG):s and "&amp;"
	  and Tags[5985.74] and other things that belong to C.
