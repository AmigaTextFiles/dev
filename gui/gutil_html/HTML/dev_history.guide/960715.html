 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.8

	* Some bug fixes in the new help functions. If 0 was used as data on a GU_HelpText
	  tag with a gadget that shows the help text in the window's or screen's title,
	  there were some enforcer hits

	* Deleted the separate autodoc files. Appended some information on the contents of
	  the GU_Public structure to the autodocs. More info about SCRTITLE_HELP and
	  WINTITLE_HELP was also appended.

	* Changed the help function so that all gadgets and title bars that are used to
	  display help strings is cleared if the mouse pointer is outside all gadgets that
	  have help texts.
