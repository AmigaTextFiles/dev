 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.6

	* gu_Active in the structure that gg_UserData points to was not updated
	  when using any routine that used GU_SetGadgetAttrsA(). Now it checks
	  the gu_Active value to see if it is out of the gadget's limits. This
	  check is done a bit different depending on the gadget type:

	  CYCLE_KIND, LISTVIEW_KIND:
		The selected value is set to max if it is greater than the
		maximum allowed value. LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets can have an empty
		list attached, and the selected value will then be set to -1 (no
		selected entry).

	  SCROLLER_KIND:
		The selected value is set to Total-Visible if it is greater than
		the maximum allowed value.

	  SLIDER_KIND:
		The selected value is set to max if it is greater than the
		maximum allowed value. If it is less than the minimum allowed
		value, it will be set to the min value.

	* gng_Flags and gng_GadgetText is now cleared before creation of every
	  new gadget.

	* The LAYOUTA_Spacing tag for LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets is now used to
	  determine the height of the gadget. If the height of a gadget should
	  be about 4 lines (GU_HeightFactor, 4), the height of the gadget is
	  calculated to 4*(font height+value of LAYOUTA_Spacing tag). The same
	  method is used for the GU_AddHeiLines tag.

	* Hotkeys for LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets works as they should again. In v37.5
	  of GadUtil (and probably some earlier ones), the listview didn't scroll
	  down when you selected the next entry.

	* Inserted pragmas and prototypes for tagcalls (pragmas only for SAS/C).
	  It is possible to create stub routines for the tagcalls for other
	  compilers by using fd2pragma 2.0.

	* Inserted links to the include files in the index file for GadUtil.guide.
