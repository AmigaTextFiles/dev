 ~~~~~~~
	* Some of the routines sent back the results in the "wrong" registers.
	  This doesn't matter for assemnly language programmers, but all other
	  programming languages requires that the results is returned in D0.

	  Some of the routines now sends results in more than one register
	  (often A0 and D0).

	* Changed GU_GadgetArrayIndex to use A0 as a pointer to the
	  LayoutGadget array (A1 is used internally)

	* Wrote the FD file and converted it to Lattice/SAS C, Aztec, DICE
	  and Maxon C (pragma files = as LVO in assembly language)
