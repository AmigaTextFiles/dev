 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.7

	* Bug fix in the prototype for GU_ChangeStr (two parameters was mixed up).

	* GU_ChangeStr now works for both STRING_KIND and TEXT_KIND gadgets. If the
	  gadget isn't a STRING or TEXT gadget this function does nothing.

	* Bug fix in GU_CoordsInGadBox function. The register D3 was trashed in all
	  earlier versions of GU.

	* gu_Active in the extra data structure now contains a pointer to the current
	  string in a STRING_KIND or TEXT_KIND gadget. gu_Active is also used by the
	  INTEGER_KIND and the NUMBER_KIND gadgets to store the current value.

	* Three new tags allows any STRING or TEXT_KIND gadget to show a (localized)
	  help text for each gadget in the window. These tags also works with the
	  special gadgets (BEVELBOX, LABEL, PROGRESS). The gadgets attached to the
	  window is scanned in sequential order. If a BEVELBOX_KIND gadget matches
	  the pointer position, this gadget's help string will have the lowest
	  priority. If another BEVELBOX is found inside this, the help string for
	  that one will be used if there is no gadget inside that box. The help text
	  can alternatively be shown in the window's or screen's title.
