 941209:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Added debug functions for OpenLib (initRoutine). Now we don't have
	  to open a lot of libraries in the beginning of the internal test
	  program...

	* Added debug functions for Close and Expunge routines. Same reason as
	  above. Expunge does not do a Remove() and FreeMem() on the library
	  when the internal test program is used.

	* Settings GU_DEBUG = 0 and GU_LIBRARY = 0 didn't work. The program was
	  using dosbase (for Delay) and this variable was not in the debug sect.

	* Wrote a routine that opens libraries in initRoutine. Can skip to check
	  if a library was opened or not and tries to open the next one if one
	  failed.

	* A small bug fix in GU_SetGUGadAttrsA:
	    move.l gg_MutualExclude,d3  -&gt;  move.l gg_MutualExclude(a0),d3

	* Changed so that the HotKey part uses MutualExclude instead of
	  UserData. The flags in MutualExclude is moved into a longword in the
	  HotKey data structure.

	  All gadgets that uses the hotkey part, and all IMAGE_KIND gadgets
	  will now allocate about 40 bytes extra memory for each gadget.
