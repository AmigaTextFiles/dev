 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.9

	* 6 new tags added for the help functions. It is now possible to set a default
	  help text that will be shown if no gadget is under the pointer.

	  GU_DefWTitle		- default window title
	  GU_DefLocWTitle	- localized window title
	  GU_DefSTitle		- default screen title
	  GU_DefLocSTitle	- localized screen title
	  GU_DefHelpText	- default help text
	  GU_DefLocHelpText	- localized help text

	* A little bug removed from the help routines. Versions beore 37.9 could
          display two different help text at the same time (in different gadgets or
	  the screen or window title).

	* A new include file is included in the distribution now. Now it should be
	  possible to compile the examples with older versions of the system include
	  files (OS 2.0x includes are supported now)

	* A third archive with the HTML version of the GadUtil documentation is
	  included in the distribution now. Also included with this archive is some
	  pictures of applications using GadUtil.

	* The distribution has changed a bit, resulting in that the archive with all
	  files became smaller (developer archive only).
