<PRE>

        The following limitations exist in the current version of GadUtil:

        - Gadgets will not be recalculated when resizing a window

        - Some GadgetID's are reserved by GadUtil. This should not be a problem,
          since at least 65000 GadgetID's will still be usable by the programmer.
          Currently there are only 3 reserved ID's (65533 to 65535, or -1 to -3).
