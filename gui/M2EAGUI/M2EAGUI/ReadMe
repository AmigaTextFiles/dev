Modula Interface done by Stefan "Steffel" Schulz (freeware)
First Version 03.06.1994

This  archive  contains  the  files  you need to use the EAGUI-Library with
M2Amiga.  It is designed for Version 4.2 of the M2Amiga-Environment-System.

  You  have to compile the interface on yourself, as you have the choice of
making  it  able  to  use  Strings  or  only Addresses (which is useful for
localization).
  Therefore  a script is added, this will compile the interface-modules and
place the obj/sym file to m2:modules/sym and /obj.
