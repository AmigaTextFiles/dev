@NODE GCHAP-Introduction "Introduction"

GUIEnvironment is a package which simplifies the creating and interacting
with GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces). It consists of two parts:

1) The code generator which creates ready to run application modules out
   of GadToolsBox (© Jaba Development) files. So simply design your GUI
   with this great "interface builder" and then run GUIEnvironment on this
   and you don't have to worry anymore about the GUI !

2) The guienv.library and the geclass.library. The first library helps
   creating and handling GUIs and the second one is for sharing private
   BOOPSI classes.

Using GUIEnvironment will save you a lot of time when writing applications
which take use of the Amiga GUI, although the guienv.library is very small.
Your ready to run application will of course later only need the library !

Here are some examples of what the guienv.library does for you:

The developer must implement only the importan parts of an applications.
He must not care about the GUI and its handling, as the guienv.library
does a lot of work by itself. The interacting with the input events is
nearly complete managed by GUIEnvironment.
The guienv.library combines the gadtools.library features, the BOOPSI
gadgets and some own GUI stuff.
The library interfaces are very simple but powerfull. It was an important
aim when designing the guienv.library to have short and simple to use
interfaces to the GUI combined with the possibility of interaction when-
ever desired or needed.
This was achieved by using the OS2.04+ facilities, like amiga callback
hooks and tag lists.

So there's no difference in handling gadtools gadgets and BOOPSI gadgets
anymore.

But the most important fact of GUIEnv is - in my opinion - that you
don't have to learn "a new programming method". There exist a lot of
GUI libraries, but all of them offer a new method of describing the GUI
with childs and parents and so on.
If you only want some support for your GUI and you don't need resizing,
it is very frustrating to use those libaries.
GUIEnvironment offers the "old fashioned method" of defining GUIs together
with the new one in a compatible way !
You only have to replace the names of the functions and structures from
intuition and gadtools to those of GUIEnvironment. (OK, you will have to
do just a little bit more, but not very much ...)

GUIEnvironment includes very powerful functions for fonts, screens,
windows, gadgets, menus and GUI message handling.

All gadget kinds of the gadtools.library (OS2.04) are supported along
with all BOOPSI gadgets and some own GUIEnvironment gadgets.
Due to this, it is now possible to resize and reposition all gadgets,
even gadtools gadgets !
But this resizing is of course only possible if you tell GUIEnvironment
how to resize ! So you have to descripe the GUI - just for this purpose-
in an "object orientated way": You say, e.g. this gadget is so and so
many points away from that gadget and the distance between the border and
the gadget is so and so.

The GUI can also be adapted to every font automatically. So it is easy
do design GUIs for the workbench which fit to the user's preferences
without any extra work !

All the GUI's message handling is done by GUIEnvironment, this means:
E.g. gadgets like cycle kind, mx kind or string kind are handled automa-
tically by GUIEnv. The application only has to care for "action" gadgets
like button gadgets or menus.
This was achieved by "binding" a variable to a gadget. Each time the
gadget status changes, the variable is updated by GUIEnvironment. So
if you need the current state of the gadget, you simply check the
variable ! There is no boring message handling any more for such gadgets !

For example, you are writting a configuration editor with a lot of
cycle, mx, string and checkbox gadgets. There will also be two button
gadgets for saving or cancelling !
If you don't use GUIEnvironment, you have to check every message
and then remember the status of the gadget. Even worse, if you need
string gadgets, then you have to update all these string gadgets before
saving, because the user could have left the string gadget without
pressing return. (In this case you don't get any message !)
But WITH GUIEnvironment, you tell, when creating the gadgets, which
variable belongs to which gadget. (For example a string gadget gets
an array of chars, a cycle gadget an integer and so on.)
And now GUIEnv updates these variables for you each time a message
for such a gadget arrives. Your application only needs to check the
two button gadgets !

Key equivalents for gadgets are detected and handled automatically. The
application sees no difference if the gadget was activated by a key or
by the mouse pointer.

Callback hooks can be set for each gadget and menu item, so these
functions are then called if the gadget resp menu item was activated.
This method could be called "object orientated programming", because
the whole application is controlled by sending messages to different
objects, there is no (visible) main message loop.

GUIEnvironment offers an easy to use help function for gadgets and
menus using the AmigaGuide without bothering the application !

All gadgets and menu items can be automatically localized without any
further functions !

Also included are very easy to use requester functions which are even
able to use ReqTools (© Nico François).

Because GUIEnv was designed as a real shared amiga library you can use
it within (nearly) every programming language.

@ENDNODE

@NODE GCHAP-Overview "A brief overview"

Here a some "headlines" which illustrate the possibilities and features
of GUIEnv. This list is NOT complete, but it gives a brief overview !

Features of GUIEnvironment

  - GadToolsBox (© Jaba Development) Code Generator (M2Amiga and OberonA)

  - Supports all gadgets kinds of gadtools.library
  - Access of BOOPSI gadgets
  - Simplified handling of fonts, screens, windows, gadgets and menus
  - Indipendent handling of IDCMP messages, e.g.

     - do refreshing automatically
     - notify changes of gadgets

  - Supports automatically key equivalents
  - Font adaptable GUIs
  - Access to all important structures dealing with GUIs
  - Own gadget kinds like a progress indicator or bevel boxes
  - Resizable gadgets
  - Object orientated description of the GUI together with the usual
    way of describing GUIs
  - Requester and AmigaGuide support

  - ReqTools (© Nico François) requester support

Sorry, but as I was not able to reach Nico François (it seems that his
EMail address is not valid anymore...) I didn't want to include the
reqtools.library without asking him. If you haven't got it yet, you can
get it also from the AMINET !

@ENDNODE

@NODE GCHAP-Sourcecode "The sourcecode"

GUIEnvironment was developed using the commercial M2Amiga-Modula2-Compiler
Version 4.3 by the A+L AG.

GUIEnv actually was a Modula2 library module which was converted into
a amiga shared library using m2lmc (© C. Ziegeler) !

As I will stopp developing on the Amiga, I offer the possibility to buy
all the source of the whole GUIEnvironment for someone who is interested
in expanding GUIEnvironment. If you are interested, please contact me !

@ENDNODE

@NODE GCHAP-History "History / Changes"

This is a short extract of the developing history of GUIEnvironment.
Every version explains the main differences to the preciding version.

GUIEnv now checks for the locale.library (Thanks to F.J. Copeland and
all the others from the Oberon-A mailing list !)
Removed the old hooks
Changed gadget handling
Font adaptive GUIs
ATTENTION: Because of the huge changes in this release, the guienv.library
is not upward compatible ! But don't worry, as GUIEnv is public domain
this will be no problem. And I swear from now on the library will be
upward compatible !

@ENDNODE

@NODE GCHAP-Install "Installation"

GUIEnv requires at least OS2.04. It was designed as a real amiga shared
library, so you can use it with nearly every compiler / language which
is able to use the standard libaries.

The first step of installation is to copy the libraries to your
libs: directory. (Use the @{" GUIEnv-Install script " LINK Install.script/MAIN})

Copy the code generator GEGen to a drawer of your choice. If you want
the online documentation for GEGen available, copy the GEGen.guide (found
in the docs drawer) to the same drawer or to the HELP: directory (if you
have assigned it)!

If you have a localized workbench you have to copy the appropriate
catalog files by hand ! (Sorry, but I didn't have the time to write a
good Installer script...) The catalogs for the guienv.library and GEGen
are both in the libs/catalogs drawer !

This package includes the interface modules (header files) for the
M2Amiga-Modula2-Compiler (version 4.3 or above), SASC-Compiler
(version 6.51 or higher) and the OberonA-Compiler (release 1.5).


  Choose the chapter for your compiler / language :

@ENDNODE


@NODE GCHAP-Modula "GUIEnvironment with M2Amiga"

Using GUIEnvironment with M2Amiga is very simple because it was
developed using this compiler version 4.3 !
Please read the @{" M2Amiga document " LINK M2Amiga/M2Amiga.guide/M2-Install} for more information !

@ENDNODE

@NODE GCHAP-Oberon "GUIEnvironment with OberonA - Oberon in general"

Using GUIEnvironment with OberonA is very simple because it was tested
under OberonA release 1.5 very carefully !
For different Oberon compilers there should be no real problems to
convert the interface modules and there will soon be some interface
modules for AmigaOberon !

Please read the @{" OberonA document " LINK OberonA/OberonA.guide/OA-Install} for more information !

@ENDNODE

@NODE GCHAP-C "GUIEnvironment with SAS/C - C in general"

Using GUIEnvironment with the SAS/C is very simple, because the header
files were tested and created using SAS/C version 6.51 !

Usually these header files should work with other C compilers as well,
perhaps apart from the function declarations.

Please read the @{" SAS/C document " LINK SASC/SASC.guide/SC-Install} for more information !

@ENDNODE

@NODE GCHAP-OtherComps "Other compilers / programming languages"

For different progamming languages or compilers you need the library files
guienv.library and geclass.library in the libs: drawer and appropriate
interface modules , which are unfortunately not (yet) part of this package.

You can find in the libs drawer of this package FD files for the libraries,
which could be important for some compilers to create interface modules.
(Or perhaps you could use GUIEnv with BASIC ! - No, just a joke !)

Please read one of the documentation for the supported compilers for
more information !

@ENDNODE

@NODE GCHAP-Future "Past - Present - Future"

Well, at this time I am really not sure if it is worth to continue this
project, because - as you all know - the future of Commodore is very
doubtful !
I don't believe that there will be any new Amigas out until the end
of next year (1995) ! In all probability that's the end of the Amiga
as a different operating system....and I don't believe any of the big
rumours about new Amigas. (Sorry, but someday you have to face the truth !)

As GUIEnvironment is now - in my opinion - complete, there is no reason
for new versions, unless some of YOU have some ideas/suggestions about
what is missing in the library or unless there are still some more bugs
or problems...

Still missing IS, of course, the code generator for SAS/C but I have
absolutely NO time to do this, so if someone of YOU is interested in
doing such a great work, please let me know..

I have many new ideas to implement in the GUIEnvironment, but at this
time I see really no sense in it. But if the Amiga rises again to the
top of the computer world, I will be there (and a new and better
GUIEnvironment, of course, too !)

But beginning with 1995 I moved move my developing to NeXtStep, so I
am not able to continue any of my amiga projects from now one !
So, if someone of YOU is interested in buying all the source of the
whole GUIEnvironment project for M2Amiga to keep on my work, please
contact me !

If you have any interface modules for different languages as currently
supported or if you have written some nice examples, please make them
public (AMINET...) to help other programmers ! Thanks !

(See @{" Author " LINK GCHAP-Author} for the address.)

@ENDNODE

@NODE GCHAP-Final "What you should know..."

Before you are delivered from this boring documentation, I have to do
some apologies:
The whole documentation is not entitled to be complete, without any
mistakes or at least understandable, although I worked really very
hard on it.
If you don't know how to program an Amiga, you can throw away the docu-
mentation (but PLEASE NOT GUIEnvironment !). In many cases I left some
explanations you can find in the RKRMs. If you are familar with them,
you will probably have no problems...

To reach a "wider audience" I tried to translate the definitions and
the documentation into the english language. I hope you can understand
it and that there will be noone who died by laughing at these texts !

I am NOT a C programmer. In fact: I don't like this very confusing and
often very strange language. I even HATE it, because if you are
familiar with C you write programs noone else can understand because
of the "encryption" ! So my advice: If you have any problems with C,
take a look at Modula2 or Oberon2. Actually, there is a great Oberon-2
compiler in the public domain. Look for the OberonA compiler © by
Frank J. Copeland !
Sorry, but I don't do advertising for commercial products. (But there
exists a very good Modula2 developement software...)

But the thing I wanted to say was: As I'm not a C programmer at all,
the C programs and also the documentation are not the best way of
using C. I translated it only, because a lot of people think that
C is the only way of programming the Amiga - BUT THEY ARE WRONG !
