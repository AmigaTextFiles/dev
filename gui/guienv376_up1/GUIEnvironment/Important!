Yes, please read this carefully, because it concerns YOU !

As you all know, the future of Commodore and the Amiga is not very clear
by now.
Among some other very important economical reasons this was the fact
which made me to leave the Amiga scene !!!
But as GUIEnvironment is a public domain developing systems which stands
and falls with the developing of itself, I am currently searching for
anybody who wants to continue my work !
This means, if YOU are interested, I can "sell" you the whole source
of the GUIEnvironment for M2Amiga and from then on you are responsible
for the further developing of the GUIEnvironment.
If you are interested, please contact me. (See the GUIEnvironment.guide
for the address) I don't want to spread the source to everybody who wants
it, because then in my opinion this would be the end of GUIEnvironment.
It is important that only one person is responsible for it.
It took me some days of thinking to make up my mind about this, but I
thought that this is the best solution for you. From 1995 on I really
have no time to do any work with my Amiga and that would be the end if
noone of you shows interest !

There were several extensions I wanted to have in GUIEnvironment which
I can't do anymore:

1.) The gemisc.library containing several useful functions for developing,
    which are missing in the OS, like double linked lists, search
    functions etc.
2.) The geapplication.library containing support for environment variables,
    preferences files and ARexx.
3.) The geobjects.library which should combine all other libraries in
    an really object orientated way:
    You have some classes: Application, GUI, Gadget, Menu Item, Function
    and each object gets a specific name. Using this it should be very
    simple to "link" objects of any type and to perform a good notifi-
    cation by just saying if that event occurs inform the object with
    that name. And the message handler is now responsible for checking
    the object class and building the message structure.
    This technic would support linking objects at run time with resource
    files, so you can change objects and their attributes language
    independent and without recompiling your source !

So, if you are a good M2Amiga programmer and you want to keep on the
GUIEnvironment system developing, please contact me !

As my old Amiga has given up his life I am currently not able to do any
work for the Amgia from now on ! And this means, there won't be any
further upgrades/updates or even bug fixes, as I don't want to buy a new
Amiga at this point of time ! Sorry...

Carsten Ziegeler !
