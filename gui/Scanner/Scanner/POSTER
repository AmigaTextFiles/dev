Scanner makes commented C code of all intuition structures in memory.
The structures will receive correct pointers towards each other.
Scanner starts looking at IntuitionBase, and follows all pointers,
storing them in memory. When finished, scanner writes it all to
stdout.  Since a structure may be referenced from more than one spot,
I made sure it would never look at it more than once.
