Scanner is in the public domain. Do whatever you like with it.
I assume no responsiblity for its use.

This is a little program I wrote when I wanted to find out
how requesters worked. I started Deluxe Paint II, activated
the interesting requester, and let scanner make a copy of it all.

Scanner makes commented C code of all intuition structures in memory.
The structures will receive correct pointers towards each other.
Scanner starts looking at IntuitionBase, and follows all pointers,
storing them in memory. When finished, scanner writes it all to stdout.
Since a structure may be referenced from more than one spot, I made
sure it would never look at it more than once.

It is quite useful if you want to are a beginner, and want to make
things work right away.

I never finished scanner, because it had all I needed at the time.
It should be quite easy to complete the job.
