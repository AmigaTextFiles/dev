GUFront Developer documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This directory contains the developer documentation for GUIFront. If you
want to create your own GUIFront applications you'll need these files. If
not, you can safely forget all about them.

Since compiler systems and the way they install vary so much, I have not
provided an installation script of any kind, so you're going to have to
copy it manually onto your HD to use it. Shouldn't be too much trouble,
though.
