@Node Introduction "Introduction"
Introduction

The  GUIFront preferences editor is a utility which allows you to customize
the  visual appearance of GUIFront applications.  For example, you can tell
an  application  use  a  particular  font,  or  change  the  color of frame
headlines for another application.  Or a combination of those, of course.

See the section on @{"usage" LINK Usage} for a complete description of all features.

@Node Installation "Installation"
Installation

The  GUIFront  preferences editor installs very easily.  Simply copy it and
its  icon  into the directory or drawer where you want it.  If you want the
editor  to run localized, you must also copy the necessary catalog files to
your LOCALE:  directory.

Two  versions  of  the  editor have been provided.  One runs on all Amigas,
while  the  other  requires  an  Amiga with at least a 68020 processor.  To
maximise  efficiency  you  should  install  the  version which most closely
matches the CPU in your machine.

I  shouldn't  have  to say this, but just in case anyone's wondering - yes,
you do need the guifront.library to use the preferences editor :)

Like  the  GUIFront  library  itself, the GUIFront editor requires at least
AmigaDOS 2.04.

In  case you are still confused, simply let one of the installation scripts
do the work for you.

@Node Usage "Usage"
Usage

The GUIFront preferences editor allows you to change almost all GUI related
aspects  of  a  GUIFront  application.   It  also  allows  you  to define a
"default"  setting,  which new applications automatically inherit when they
are first run.

To  use the editor, either double-click on it's icon, or activate it from a
shell.  You should see the main editing window pop up.

The  listview  gadget  contains a list of active applications.  To edit the
preferences  of  any  particular  application, first select the application
from  this  list.   To edit the default preferences (which are inherited by
new  applications  when  they  are first launched), select the entry marked
with "« Default »").

Pressing  the  @{"Gadgets" LINK GGadgets}  button  brings  up a new window which allows you to
change various settings pertaining to gadgets (font, style, etc).

The  @{"Frames" LINK GFrames}  button  opens  a  window  which  allows you to modify settings
pertaining to frames and frame headlines.

The  @{"Backfill" LINK GBackfill}  button opens a window which allows you to control whether or
not an application is allowed to use backfilling, and if so, what color the
backfill should have.

The  @{"Misc" LINK GMisc}  button  opens up a window with miscellaneous other settings.  At
present  the  only  setting  you  can  control  from  here  is what type of
refreshing an application should use, but more controls are planned.

The  @{"Info" LINK GInfo}  button  brings  up  some  information  on the currently selected
application.  Note not every application supply information about themself,
and so some of the fields in the Information window may be empty.

Note  that all the above windows are asynchronous.  This means you can open
and use as many of them as you like at any one time.

The  @{b}Delete@{ub}  button  allows  you  to  delete  all  settings  related to the
currently   selected  application.   You  will  be  asked  to  confirm  the
operation,  and then the application is deleted.  Note you cannot undo this
by pressing the Cancel button!

To  permanently  save  the  preferences as they are just now (regardless of
which windows may be open), press @{b}Save@{ub}. To use the current settings, press
@{b}Use@{ub}. To cancel changes you've made to the preferences, press @{b}Cancel@{ub}.

Note  that  to guifront.library, changes happen only when you press @{b}Save@{ub} or
@{b}Use@{ub}.   If  you  launch an application while the preferences window is open,
this  new  application will use the preferences which were in effect before
the preferences editor was launched.

The  GUIFront preferences editor also has some menus.  See the @{"menu section" LINK Menus}
for a more detailed description of these.

Also  note  that  the  preferences  editor  listens for new applications to
start.   As  soon  as  this happens, a new entry pops up in the application
listview, regardless of what you are doing with the editor at that time.

Closing  the  window  is logically equivalent to pressing @{b}Use@{ub}, so you won't
loose any changes if you do this.

@Node GGadgets "Gadget Preferences"
Gadget Preferences

This  window allows you to control which font an application should use for
gadgets, plus what style you prefer for various gadget types.

Select  @{b}Screen  Font@{ub} to have the application use whatever happens to be the
current screen font at the time when the application is launched.

Deselect  @{b}Screen  Font@{ub}  to have the application use a particular font.  Use
the @{b}GetFont@{ub} gadget to select the font the application should use.

The listview below the font settings contain a list of gadgets which can be
rendered  in one of two styles:  @{b}Xen@{ub} or @{b}Normal@{ub}.  @{b}Xen@{ub} differs from @{b}Normal@{ub} in
that  an  extra  black  frame  is rendered around the gadget hitbox itself.
With  the  right  font  and  a  high  graphics  resolution,  this  can look
remarkably good, especially for Buttons and Checkboxes.

Note  that  Checkboxes  currently cannot be rendered in Xen mode under V36.
You'll need at least V39 to enjoy this.

The  @{b}Xen Frame Color@{ub} palette gadget allows you to select which color should
be  used  for  rendering  Xen frames.  Xen frames are the thin frames which
GUIFront  draws around the hitboxes of those gadgets which supports the xen
mode.
@EndNode

@Node GFrames "Frame Preferences"
Frame Preferences

This  window allows you to control how frame headlines are rendered for the
selected application.

Select  @{b}Screen  Font@{ub} to have the application use whatever happens to be the
current screen font at the time when the application is launched.

Deselect  @{b}Screen  Font@{ub}  to have the application use a particular font.  Use
the @{b}GetFont@{ub} gadget to select the font the application should use.

The @{b}Color@{ub} gadget allows you to select the color of frame headlines.

The  @{b}Alignment@{ub}  gadgets  allow  you to control if frame headlines should be
vertically  centered  on (@{b}Center@{ub} gadget), or rendered above the frame it is
written on (@{b}Above@{ub} gadget).

The  @{b}Attributes@{ub}  gadgets  allow  you  to  change  the  attributes  of frame
headlines.   Select @{b}Bold@{ub} to render headlines in boldface, @{b}Italics@{ub} to render
headlines  in  Italics, and @{b}3D@{b} to give headlines a black shadow.  Note that
the  @{b}Color@{ub}  gadget  controls  the  color  of  the headline, not the shadow.
Selecting black color and 3D is therefore not a very good idea.

The  @{b}Centering@{ub}  gadgets  allow  you  to control the horizontal alignment of
frame  headlines.  Select @{b}Right@{ub} to have headlines rendered rightmost on the
frame,  @{b}Centered@{ub}  to have it centered and @{b}Left@{ub} to have it rendered leftmost
on the frame.
@EndNode

@Node GBackfill "Backfill Preferences"
Backfill Preferences

This window allows you to control application backfilling.

Select  @{b}Enable  backfilling@{ub}  to allow the currently selected application to
use backfilling if it wants to.

If  you enable backfilling, you can also select the two color components of
the backfilling pattern itself, using the @{b}Color 1@{ub} and @{b}Color 2@{ub} gadgets.
@EndNode

@Node GMisc "Miscellaneous Preferences"
Miscellaneous Preferences

This  window  allows  you  to  control  miscellaneous  GUI settings for the
currently selected application.

The  Refreshing gadgets allow you to control what type of window refreshing
the  application  should  be  using.  Select Smart to use Intuition's smart
refreshing scheme, and Simple to use manual refreshing.

The  difference  between  the  two  methods  is the old memory-versus-speed
compromise  over  again.   Smart  refreshing  looks  great, it is quick and
results  in  a  minimum of visual flickering when windows are moved around.
The drawback is that this type of refreshing is quite expensive in terms of
memory  usage.   Worst  case it uses twice the amount of memory that simple
refreshing would.

Simple  refresh  is very cheap, memory-wise, but uses more CPU power and is
probably also a bit slower than using smart refreshing.

If you've got the memory, use smart refreshing.  If you have the CPU power,
use simple refreshing.
@EndNode

@Node GInfo "Application Information"
Application Information

This   window   simply   shows  you  some  information  about  the  current
application.   Note  that  not  all  applications  supply information about
themselves.   For  such  applications  the  information  fields will remain
empty.
@EndNode

@Node Menus "Menus"
Menus

The GUIFront preferences editor currently has the following menu items:

Project/

	Open...

		This menu item allows you to load a complete set of
		preferences into the editor. Note that the current
		preferences (plus any changes you've made) will be
		lost in the process.

	Save As...

		This menu item allows you to save the current preferences
		to a file. Note that doing this has the side effect of
		making the saved preferences the actual, current
		preferences, just like if you had presset Use.

	About...

		This menu item shows you some incredibly important
		information.

	Quit
		Select this menu item to quit the GUIFront preferences
		editor. The current settings will be lost in the process.

Edit/

	Reset to Defaults/

		This entry

			This menu item will reset the current application
			to some internal, standard values. Note that this
			takes effect immediately, and can't be cancelled
			by pressing Cancel.

		All entries

			Select this menu item to reset all application
			preferences to internal, standard values. Again
			note that this takes effect immediately and can't
			be cancelled by pressing Cancel.

	Last Saved

		This menu item resets the current settings to whatever you
		last saved using the Save gadget.

	Restore

		Select this menu item to undo all changes you've made to
		the current preferences.

Options/

	Create Icons?

		Check this menu item if you want project icons to be saved
		along with the preferences, every time you select Save As...
		from the menu.

		GUIFront uses the image of the first of the following
		icons it can locate, for the icon to be saved:

		ENV:Sys/def_guifront
		ENV:Sys/def_project
		ENVARC:Sys/def_guifront
		ENVARC:Sys/def_project

		If you design your own icon and store it under one of these
		names, GUIFront automatically uses this icon.
