1. Introduction
---------------

This library provides a means of creating fully font sensitive graphic user
interfaces (GUIs) with a minimum of programming efford.  It also provides a
couple of visual enhancements over GadTools, and a more convenient method
of handling gadget hotkey shortcuts.

The most important features of GUIFront is:

* GadTools foundation, very easy to come to grips with
* Generates fully font sensitive interfaces
* Automatic hotkey handling, including shift-cancellable buttons
* Hotkey aliasing - use F10 or ENTER as gadget hotkeys
* Easy backfilling of windows
* Automatic group framing
* Frame headlines
* Offers attractive new XEN look
* Easy to program, tags with suitable default values used most everywhere
* Executables are generally small, most code embedded in the library itself
* Fully supports localizing, including gadget labels and menus
* Preferences editor (localized) allowing customization of applications
* Simple installation (only one library and the preferences editor)

The preferences editor allows you to customize...

* Gadget fonts
* Frame headline fonts
* Frame headline style (text style, color, left/center/right leading etc)
* Gadget rendering style for each gadget kind (XEN or normal)
* Refreshing (simple or smart)
* Backfill patterns

Every setting is controllable on a per-application basis, allowing the user
full control over visual appearance for each application.

2. Installation
---------------

To install GUIFront, copy the library to your LIBS: directory and the
preferences editor to your SYS:Prefs directory. If you want the preferences
editor localized you must also copy the appropriate .catalog files to your
LOCALE: directory.

To simplify installation even further, I have provided a number of
installation scripts for use with both IconX and Commodore's Installer
utility. Simply double click the one which is appropriate for your machine
and watch the fireworks.

3. Requirements
---------------

The GUIFront library and its editor both require at least AmigaDOS 2.04.
Any attempted use under kickstart 1.2 or 1.3 will fail.

The developer includefiles were written speciffically for the SAS/C
compiler.  They probably work under most other compilers as well, but may
need some tweaking.

4. Usage
--------

To maximise code reusability, GUIFront has been implemented as a shared
library.  To use any of the library functions, you must first successfully
open the library, as illustrated below:

    #include <proto/guifront.h>
    #include <libraries/guifront.h>

    struct Library *GUIFrontBase;

    main()
    {
        if (GUIFrontBase = OpenLibrary(GUIFRONTNAME, GUIFRONTVERSION))
        {
            /* GUIFront functions may now be called */
            ...;
            CloseLibrary(GUIFrontBase);
        }
    }

For examples on how to use GUIFront, please refer to the included example
programs. You will find a more detailed description of the individual
GUIFront library functions in the Doc directory (guifront.doc).
