Example programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This directory contains a number of demonstration GUIs. It is my hope that
these will help you get a grip on the basic concepts of GUIFront, and
perhaps even provide a basis for creating your own GUIs.

Examples include the GUIs from several well-known programs, so you can
compare GUIFront with the real thing. Often you will find two different
versions of a GUI, the first being a semi-accurate replicate of the
original GUI, and the second being my attempt at beautifying it a bit.

The simplest example is 'ThreeBut', a program which sets up three button
gadgets below eachother. Even though the GUI is simple, it is still fully
font sensitive and can be controlled with the preferences editor. The size
of the 'ThreeBut' executable is a mere 1200 bytes, which tells something
about the simplicity of creating GUIs with GUIFront.

Source
~~~~~~
The source for all the examples can be found in the "Source" directory. An
SCOPTIONS and smakefile for use with SAS/C is included, but I'll do a quick
layout of the way the examples compile anyway.

Every example is composed of some startup code, 'mystartup.c', a general
routine to set up and delete the GUI ('generic.c'), plus the data for the
GUI itself. To compile an example (without using smake), compile
'Generic.c', 'mystartup.c' and the example file you're interested in, and
then link them all together.  Since we're using our own startup code,
remember to disable SAS/C's own startup code (in the LINK options).

Note some of the sources will give you a few harmless typecast warnings.
Sorry, I was too lazy to fix this :-)

Distribution etc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The examples here are a part of the GUIFront distribution, and as described
in the general Distribution document a couple of directory levels up, must
be included (unmodified) when distributing GUIFront.

However, I am not copyrighting any of the code or the design itself, so if
you can use any of it in your own programs, by all means, be my guest.

If you cook up some interesting GUI examples yourself, send them to me and
I'll include them here.
