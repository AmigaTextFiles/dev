Distribution
------------

The GUIFront library, the preferences editor and all related files are
freely distributable, as long as all files are distributed together. The
GUIFront preferences editor and the guifront.library itself may be
independantly bundled and distributed.

If you use the library in one of your own shareware programs, a donation of
$20-$50 (depending on weighed use of the library), plus a working copy of
your product would be greatly appreciated.

Programmers of non-crippled, freely distributable software (what I would
call freeware) may use the library in their programs without donating
money, but I would still very much like a copy of your product.

If you are developing a commercial product, and you would like to use and
distribute this library with it, write for a licence agreement.

Whether freely distributable or commercial, your program's documentation
must include a note saying that you are using the guifront.library, which
is copyright by Michael Berg. Have the curtesy to include my e-mail
address as well, so people will know whom to contact for more information
regarding the library.

If you have any further questions relating to the distribution of the
library, feel free to write me at any one of the addresses mentioned in the
ReadMe file.
