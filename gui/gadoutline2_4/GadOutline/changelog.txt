BUGS:

- Resizing a window, and then immediately resizing it again before the
  library has a chance to rebuild the gadgets, will cause it to trash
  the window's border.
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:

- Add a GO_* tag for specifying a user IDCMP port by passing the
  address of another GadOutline structure.
- Add a "late link" which sends a message to a command to link one of
  its tags to another command's object after the first has been created.
  This will allow full support of interconnections between BOOPSI gadgets.
- Much better support of finding the dimensions of another box using the
  TypedSize tags.
- Underscoring of text in drawings.
- The ability to "include" an outline - a pointer from one static ULONG
  outline definition to another one which is to be treated as if it were
  actually in the first.
- Examples of LoadSeg()ing a static outline definition...  if it works. :)

IDEAS:

- Command tags to supply which object tags should be translated in
  addition to the standard ones.
- New tag - GO_AllocUserData would tell size of memory to allocate and
  attach to the GadOutline's go_UserData field.  This memory would be
  managed by the library and automatically deallocated when the outline
  is free'd.
- Perhaps add LockGadOutline() and UnLockGadOutline(), which would
  lock the current window using a requester and set the pointer to
  a busy pointer, then restore everything when unlocking.  This might
  also want to do outline-specific things...?
- Have a translation message from the requester to translate user
  formatting codes?
  
LONG TERM:

- It would be relatively easy to 'attach' two outlines together, so that
  a group in one contains another complete GadOutline.  This would then
  allow interesting things like a file requester that takes a pointer to
  a GadOutline, which would allow the caller to add their own gadgets.

Version 2.4 (August 18, 1993 at 2:08AM) :

    The state of SLIDER_KIND gadgets was incorrectly tracked when
    the gadget's arrow buttons were used.  It seems that the arrows never
    send an IDCMP_GADGETUP event so, until a work-around can be found,
    go_ActCmdInfo will be left pointing to the slider gadget until another
    gadget event occurs.  Hopefully, this will not cause any problems.

Version 2.3 (August 08, 1993 at 2:49AM) :

    Corrected bug in the default dimensions of CYCLE_KIND gadgets which
    by default did not provide enough horizontal width.
    
Version 2.2 (August 07, 1993 at 3:41AM) :

    The builtin GadTools hook will now try to move a listview's top so that
    the currently selected node is visible whenever the tag GTLV_Top, ~0 is
    included in the update list and there is a GTLV_Selected tag in either
    the update list or the command's object list.
    
Version 2.1 (July 30, 1993 at 5:29PM) :

    GODT_ResetBounds was parsing its arguments in the wrong order;
    instead of (x1,y1,x2,y2) it was doing (y2,x2,y1,x1).

    TXTMD_RELCENTER now rounds up so that fonts with an even point size
    are correctly centered.

Version 2.0 (July 28, 1993 at 8:37PM) :

    First public release.
