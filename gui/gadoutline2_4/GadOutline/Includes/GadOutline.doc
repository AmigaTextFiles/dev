  NAME
        AllocGadOutlineA -- Create a new GadOutline.


  SYNOPSIS
        GadOutline = AllocGadOutlineA(Outline, TagList)
                                      A0       A1       

        struct GadOutline *AllocGadOutlineA(ULONG *, struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        Allocates and initializes a new GadOutline based on the given
        Outline array. This array is formatted as sequence of ULONG
        command codes, each of which can have 0 to 7 ULONG parameters and
        0 to 3 tag lists immediately following it.  The entire ULONG
        command code is divided into a number of fields, including the
        number of parameters and tag lists which follow it, the command
        class, code, and subcode. See <libraries/gadoutline.h> for the
        definitions of these fields and macros which supply an abstraction
        from the actual creation of the command data.  The Outline array
        is terminated by the special command code GO_ENDOUTLINE().

        The library first allocates and initializes a GadOutline structure
        and then calls UpdateGadOutlineA() with the given tag list.  Then,
        for each command code in the outline, the library will allocate a
        CmdInfo structure, fill in the parameters supplied in the outline
        and create copies of all of the supplied tag lists and attach them
        to the CmdInfo.  All unspecified parameters will be set to 0, and
        all unspecified tag lists will be initialized to a tag list
        containing a single TAG_END.

        The library will then look for a GOCT_SetUserHook tag in the
        command's first ("command") tag list and, if it exists, send a
        CHM_TRANSCMDHOOK to the GadOutline's Translation Hook, attach it to
        the command as the highest level hook, initialize ci_UserHookData to
        either the value in GOCT_SetUserHookData or 0, and set
        ci_UserHookState to 0. The library will then send to the
        highest-level hook attached to the command the messages
        CHM_INITIALIZE, CHM_INITCMDATTR, CHM_INITOBJATTR, in that order. 
        This is the only time the library will ever send these messages, and
        the hook is expected to perform any initialization/allocation of
        resources and an initial parsing of its tag lists when it recieves
        the respective messages.

        There are a couple of commands which get special treatment.  When
        the command GO_OUTLINETAGS() is encountered in the outline, its
        second ("object") tag list is passed to UpdateGadOutlineA() before
        any of its hooks are called.  The command GO_COMMANDTAGS() will
        cause evey command following it to have the tags in its object tag
        list to be added to their command tag list if they are not already
        in it.  If this command is specified multiple times, it overrides
        the previous occurance.

        Finally, DimenGadOutline is called with the completed GadOutline.

  INPUTS
        Outline - (ULONG *) List of commands to create outline.
        TagList - (struct TagItem *) Global (GOA_*) outline tags.

  RESULT
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) The freshly created GadOutline.

  TAGS
        Command tags -
            GOCT_SetUserHook - Provide custom hook for command.
            GOCT_SetUserHookData - Initialize ci_UserHookData field.
            GOCT_SetHotKey - Attach a hotkey to the command.
            GOCT_SetHotKeyCmd - Provide StdID of command which will receive
                                hotkey events attached to this command.

  EXAMPLE

        See example3.c

  NOTES
        A user command hook must always pass through the messages
        CHM_INITIALIZE, CHM_INITCMDATTR, CHM_INITOBJATTR and CHM_TERMINATE
        to the library's internal hooks using GO_ContCmdHookA().

        While currently the tag list supplied in the CHM_INITCMDATTR and
        CHM_INITOBJATTR messages are simply the identical tag lists within
        the CmdInfo structure (ci_CmdTags and ci_ObjectTags), this may
        change in the future.

        The order that the global tags are parsed is: first the list passed
        directly to AllocGadOutlineA(), then any from the GO_OUTLINETTAGS()
        commands, in the order that they appear in the outline.  When
        DimenGadOutlineA() is called with the completed GadOutline, it is
        passed an empty tag list.

        If an error occurs during DimenGadOutlineA(), the outline will be
        free'd and a NULL will be returned.  This is important if you are
        specifying a displaymode, screen or window within the initial tag
        list -- if the layout will not fit, DimenGadOutlineA() will fail and
        you will simply receive a NULL.  To avoid this, don't specify these
        in AllocGadOutlineA() and instead call DimenGadOutlineA() afterwards
        with these tags.

        Normally, errors in layout, allocating memory, etc. will result in
        the library displaying a requester through GO_ShowError.  You can
        turn off all errors by passing the tag { GOCT_ErrorReportLevel,0 }
        to AllocGadOutlineA().  Putting this tag in an initial
        GO_OUTLINETAGS() command within the outline will not work, as the
        library has aleady allocated a large part of its resources by the
        time this command is parsed.

        If you use GOA_BaseName to put the name of your program in the
        library's error requesters, this name will not appear if the library
        is unable to allocate the initial GadOutline structure.

  NAME
        command_hooks -- Information on GadOutline command hooks.


  SYNOPSIS
        Result = command_hooks(Hook, Command, Message)
                               A0    A2       A1       

        static ULONG command_hooks(struct Hook *, struct CmdInfo *, 
                                   struct CmdHookMsg *)

  FUNCTION
        The command hook provides an abstract interface between the library
        and the actual creation and manipulation of the display's gadgets
        and associated objects.  It is based on the standard utility.library
        hook structure and the CmdHookMsg structure as defined in
        gadoutline.h.
        
        The following messages must be sent to the standard hook with
        GO_ContCmdHookA() before being processed:
        
        CHM_INITIALIZE - sent to the hook during the initial allocation and
        initialization of all commands.  When sent, the library has already
        allocated a CmdInfo structure, and BoxAttr if needed, and the hook
        is expected to do any initialization it may need.  This may involve
        such things as initializing its command's state tags or allocating a
        block of memory and attaching it to ci_UserData.
        
        CHM_INITCMDATTR - provides the hook with a look at the initial
        command tag list supplied in the outline.  Don't expect ci_CmdTags
        to be valid until after this messages has been processed with
        GO_ContCmdHookA().

        CHM_INITOBJATTR - provides the hook with a look at the initial
        object tag list supplied in the outline.  Don't expect the secondary
        tag list  to be valid until after this messages has been processed
        with GO_ContCmdHookA().

        The following message must be sent to the standard hooks with
        GO_ContCmdHookA() after being processed:
        
        CHM_TERMINATE - sent while a GadOutline is being deallocated.  The
        hook should free any resources allocated in CHM_INITIALIZE.
        [Although any memory allocated with GO_AllocMem() will automatically
        be free'd by the library.]
        
        The following messages will almost always need to be processed by
        the library with GO_ContCmdHookA() so that the command's tag lists
        will remain updated:
        
        CHM_SETCMDATTR - update from the command tags supplied in the tag
        list pointed to by the first argument.  After being processed by the
        library, ci_CmdTags will have been updated to reflect the new
        values and you may check for any user tags you have defined.
        
        CHM_SETOBJATTR - update from the object tags supplied in the tag
        list pointed to by the first argument.  After being processed by the
        library, the secondary tag list will have been updated to reflect
        the new values.  The user hook's processing of this tag will
        typically involve something like calling SetAttrsA() with the tag
        list sent by the message.  Note that when updating a gadget's tags,
        you should use go_HookedWin and NOT go_Window to find the window
        that the gadget is attached to, so that you will correctly handle
        things like the gadget being temporarily detached from the
        GadOutline's window.  Be ready for this message to be sent when the
        gadget is attached to the window, when the gadget is created but not
        attached, and when the gadget isn't created at all.
        
        CHM_GETCMDATTR - fill in the tags supplied in the tag list pointed
        to by the first argument with the current state of the command
        tags.  After being processed by the library, the tags in ci_CmdTags
        will have been copied to the tag list.
        
        CHM_GETOBJATTR - fill in the tags supplied in the tag list pointed
        to by the first argument with the current state of the secondary
        tags.  After being processed by the library, the tags in the
        secondary tag list will have been copied to the message's tag list
        and you may update them from there.  This will normally involve
        calling something like GetAttr() for each tag in the list.
        
        The following are messages commonly processed completely by the user
        hook:
        
        CHM_GETMINDIMENS - used by the library to query for the gadget's
        standard dimensions during a layout.  This message is sent only to
        group and box commands; you are expected to fill in the GODimensInfo
        structure pointed to by the first argument with your desired
        dimensions.  Note that these dimensions may be modified using
        command tags in the outline.
        
        CHM_CREATEOBJ - ask hook to create its object.  The first argument
        points to a NewGadget structure from which the hook may get its
        dimension information, although looking at its BoxAttr is also
        permissible.  What actually happens here is entirely up to the hook;
        the only thing the library cares about is the value in ci_Object; a
        non-NULL value indicates something was created, NULL means nothing
        was created.  NULL is not a failure however; the hook is expected to
        report its own failures and should set go_LastReqReturn to
        GORET_FAIL if it really wants to stop everything with an error.  A
        special ci_Object value of ~0 indicates that the hook didn't really
        create an object, but it would like to be informed of CHM_DRAWSELF
        and other events.  Note that you must _always_ give a gadget you
        create the ng_GadgetID and ng_UserData values found in the NewGadget
        structure; these are used internally by the library.  To add a
        gadget to the window, it must be linked to one of the GadOutline's
        gadget lists.  GadTools gadgets should always be attached to the
        last GadTools gadget pointed to by go_LastGTools, and then set
        go_LastGTools to now point to the new gadget; this list will be
        automatically free'd by the library.  All other gadgets should
        attach after the gadget pointed to by go_LastBoopsi and then set
        themselves as the new last gadget.

        CHM_DESTROYOBJ - deallocate an object created with CHM_CREATEOBJ.
        When receiving this message, you should deallocate anything created
        during CHM_CREATEOBJ and save any final state information from the
        object that you need to keep for a subsequent CHM_CREATEOBJ.  You
        should always set ci_Object to NULL when receiving this command.  Be
        prepared to receive this message even if your object is not created.
        Any GadTools gadget added to the go_GToolsList will be automatically
        free'd by the library after this message is sent and should not be
        deallocated by the user hook - the hook should just set its
        ci_Object to NULL.
        
        CHM_RESIZEOBJ and CHM_PRERESIZE - support for resizing objects which
        do not have to be fully destroyed/created.  These are currently not
        fully implemented and should always perform the identical operation
        as CHM_CREATEOBJ and CHM_DESTROYOBJ, respectively.
        
        CHM_HOOKOBJ and CHM_UNHOOKOBJ - sent to inform hook of the attaching
        a removal of the gadget lists from the window.
        
        CHM_MADELINK - sent to a hook after another object has been created
        which has a TagLink to this one.  Typically used to reset any of the
        object's state which may have been affected by the link.
        
        CHM_UPDATESTATE - sent to a hook when its gadget has been pressed or
        released, or an event has occured between the gadget down and up
        events.  The GOIMsg that occured is in the first argument; you may
        modify this any way you please.  This message is typically used to
        track the state of a gadget so that it is correctly reflected in the
        command's object tag list.
        
        CHM_HOTKEY - perform hotkey operation for the command.  Sent when an
        IDCMP_RAWKEY or IDCMP_VANILLAKEY event has occured which is attached
        to the hook's command.  The hook should perform whatever action the
        gadget should take for hotkeys and update the GOIMsg pointed to by
        the first argument, which contains the event which triggered the
        hotkey, to reflect the event that the gadget performed, ie a gadget
        up event.
        
        CHM_DRAWSELF - sent when the hook needs to redraw its imagery.  This
        message will only be sent when the command's ci_Object is non-NULL.
        
  INPUTS
        Hook    - (struct Hook *) Your hook.
        Command - (struct CmdInfo *) The command being sent the message.
        Message - (struct CmdHookMsg *) The operation to perform.

  RESULT
        Result - (static ULONG) Message-dependant return value.

  NAME
        DestroyGadOutlineA -- Destroy all created objects.


  SYNOPSIS
        DestroyGadOutlineA(GadOutline, TagList)
                           A0          A1       

        void DestroyGadOutlineA(struct GadOutline *, struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        Calls UpdateGadOutlineA() with the given tag list, unhooks the
        gadgets using UnhookGadOutlineA() and then sends CHM_DESTROYOBJ to
        all commands in the GadOutline.  This leaves the GadOutline in a
        state where it is completely detached from its window, but note
        that this does not in any way mean that you a free to do anything
        with the window.  The only legal way to detach a window or screen
        is to set { GOA_WindowAddr, NULL } or { GOA_ScreenAddr, NULL } or to
        call GO_CloseWindowA() or GO_CloseScreenA().

        The window's original font will be restored if it had been changed
        by RebuildGadOutlineA().

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Previously allocated GadOutline.
        TagList - (struct TagItem *) Global (GOA_*) outline tags, parsed
                  before the actual unhook/destroy is performed.

  RESULT
        Nothing returned from the function.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if an error occured.
        (If an empty tag list is passed, an error should never be returned.)

  NOTES
        You should never need to call this function.

  NAME
        DimenGadOutlineA -- Perform a full layout of a GadOutline.


  SYNOPSIS
        DimenGadOutlineA(GadOutline, TagList)
                         A0          A1       

        void DimenGadOutlineA(struct GadOutline *, struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        This is the primary part of the layout engine.  This routine will
        try to find a layout of the gadgets that will fit within the
        current bounds.  The only outline commands that are involved in
        this layout are the groups and boxes that occur between the first
        group command within the outline (GO_VERTGRP(), GO_HORIZGRP()) and
        its associated GO_ENDGRP().  Each of these will be sent the
        message CHM_GETMINDIMENS, with this data being used to find the
        minimum size that the layout can be.  If a box or group has its
        GOCT_IGNOREMINDIMENS tag set, it will still be layed out, but its
        resulting dimensions will be ignored when computing its parent
        group's dimensions - the group or box that follows it will
        essentially be treated as if it had a width and height of zero.

        The total dimensions of a box or group is divided into 10
        different areas, 5 each in both the horizontal vertical
        directions. These are called:  SpaceLeft, TextLeft, BodyWidth,
        TextRight and SpaceRight, and SpaceAbove, TextAbove, BodyHeight,
        TextBelow and SpaceBelow.  The space areas are the spacing to put
        between congruent boxes and groups, the text areas are the spacing
        needed by anything outside the actual body [ie, GadTools labels],
        and the body is the actual size of the gadget.

        These areas are further divided into three components each, called
        Standard, Padding, and Variable (STD, PAD, VAR).  The standard
        component is the amount of space that area must contain, the
        padding component is any extra space it would like to have but
        can be removed if needed to make the layout fit, and the variable
        area is where extra space needed to expand the box is put. 
        DimenGadOutline takes care of the STD and PAD components, but
        ignores the VAR component, which is handled by
        RebuildGadOutlineA().

        Before laying out the gadgets, UpdateGadOutlineA() is called with
        the given tag list and DestroyGadOutline() is called to unhook and
        deallocate any previously created gadgets.  In addition, all
        GOCT_CopyFromTSize ... GOCT_CopyTSizeToTag command pairs are
        executed to initialize the command's object tag list.

        To perform a layout, the list of boxes and groups within a group
        is walked, and the minimum dimensions for each is computed.  The
        minimum dimensions of a box are found by sending the box a
        CHM_GETMINDIMENS and then parsing the TypedSize tags within the
        box's command taglist to allow the outline to modify these
        defaults.

        The minimum dimensions for the group is now based on the total of
        the dimensions of each of the boxes and groups within a group and
        the layout modes of the group.  There are two basic modes in the
        group's static dimension [ie, the vertical dimension of a
        horizontal group], body and strict, and two modes in the running
        dimension - even distribution on and off.

        In body mode, the space used by all of the areas of the child
        boxes and groups is assigned to the parent group's body size - ie,
        the BodyHeight of a horizontal group is the maximum of the total
        height of each box within it, and you are only guaranteed that all
        of the boxes will be the same height; there is no guarantee that
        their bodies will line up in any way.  In strict mode, the maximum
        of each individual area is taken, so that all boxes and groups
        have the same SpaceAbove, TextAbove, BodyHeight, TextBelow and
        SpaceBelow.

        When even distribution is off, the width of a horizontal group
        will simply be the sum of the minimum size of each of the boxes
        and groups within it.  When even distribution is on, all of the
        boxes and groups are forced to be the same size as the largest
        within the group.

        The static dimension mode is controlled with three command tags. 
        These tags are mutually exclusive; setting one TRUE makes the
        others FALSE.
        GOCT_FitToGroup - If true, turn on strict mode.
        GOCT_AutoDistExtra - If true, turn on strict mode, but don't
            expand boxes to group size until RebuildGadOutlineA().
        GOCT_FrameGroup - If true, turn on body mode and reserve the
            space area around the group to itself.  [By default this
            area will be set to zero; this is normally used to reserve
            area around it to draw a border.]

        There is one tag that controls the running dimension mode -
        GOCT_EvenDistGroup.  Set to TRUE to turn on even distribution.

        After the group's initial minimum size is found, the TypedSize
        tags within the command tag list are parsed to allow them to be
        modified. These are usually used to specify the size of the frame
        needed around a GOCT_FrameGroup using the GOCT_SizeSpace* tags.

        Once the layout's minimum dimensions have been found, they are
        compared with the current layout bounds [ie, the size of the
        screen or window.] If the layout is too big, the library will try
        various things to make it fit, first attempting to use a smaller
        font size, then trying to remove padding from the boxes and
        groups, and finally falling back to the screen default font, the
        system default font, and lastly topaz 8.  If none of these work,
        an error will be reported; you can find out about this by checking
        for a non-zero value in go_LastReqReturn, as usual.

        If the layout is successful and a window or screen is attached to
        the GadOutline, RebuildGadOutlineA() is called with an empty tag
        list.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Previously allocated GadOutline.
        TagList - (struct TagItem *) Global (GOA_*) outline tags, parsed
                  before the actual layout is performed.

  RESULT
        Nothing returned from the function.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if an error occured.

  TAGS
        Command tags -
            GOCT_IgnoreMinDimens - ignore box's size when computing
                parent's minimum size.
            GOCT_FrameGroup - reserve group's space area to itself
            GOCT_FitToGroup - make every area of children boxes match
            GOCT_AutoDistExtra - same as GOCT_FitToGroup, but extra space
                not distributed until RebuildGadOutlineA().
            GOCT_EvenDistGroup - make all boxes same size in running
                dimension.
                            
  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        If the library needs to remove padding from the layout, the PAD
        component of the GOCT_SizeUser1 and GOCT_SizeUser2 variables will
        be scaled by the same amount as the amount of scaling in the
        box's width and height, respectively.

        receive messages, it should set ci_Object to ~0 when it receives
        a CHM_CREATEOBJ/CHM_RESIZEOBJ and to NULL when it gets a
        CHM_DESTROYOBJ/CHM_PRERESIZE.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Previously allocated GadOutline.
        TagList - (struct TagItem *) Global (GOA_*) outline tags, parsed
                  before the actual drawing is performed.

  RESULT
        Nothing returned from the function.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if an error occured.

  NAME
        FreeGadOutline -- Deallocate an entire GadOutline.


  SYNOPSIS
        FreeGadOutline(GadOutline)
                       A0        

        void FreeGadOutline(struct GadOutline *)

  FUNCTION
        Closes window, port and screen, and frees everything associated
        with a GadOutline.  All memory attached to this GadOutline through
        GO_AllocMem() will be free'd.  If a window has been opened with
        GO_OpenWindowA(), it will be closed.  Depending on the current
        state of the outline, the messages CHM_UNHOOKOBJ and CHM_DESTROYBJ
        will be sent to the command hooks.  CHM_TERMINATE will always be
        sent to the hooks.  This routine should be safe to call, and properly
        cleanup resources, no matter what state the GadOutline is in.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) A previously allocated GadOutline.

  RESULT
        nothing.

  NAME
        GO_AllocMem -- Allocate memory and attach it to a GadOutline.


  SYNOPSIS
        Address = GO_AllocMem(GadOutline, ErrReport, Size, Flags)
                              A0          D0         D1    D2     

        void *GO_AllocMem(struct GadOutline *, GOERR, ULONG, ULONG)

  FUNCTION
        Allocates a block of memory of the given size and attaches it to
        the given GadOutline to be tracked and automatically deallocated
        when the GadOutline is free'd in FreeGadOutline().  If NULL is
        supplied for the GadOutline, it will not be tracked.

        ErrReport specifies what to do if the memory can not be allocated.
        If it is 0, the library will simply return NULL.  Otherwise, it
        is interpreted as a standard error code and the library will call
        GO_SetError() with the given error if unable to allocate the
        memory.  If the selected error has a RETRY choice, the library
        will attempt to allocate the memory again if it is selected; if
        it is then able to get it, the caller will never know there was
        a problem.

        A shortcut is provided in specifying the error.  If the error
        type field is zero, the library will interpret the code field
        as the type and automatically use the memory code - ie,
        GO_MAKEERR(GETERRCODE(ErrReport),GOCODE_MEMORY).

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline or NULL.
        ErrReport  - (GOERR) Error to report if the allocation fails.
        Size       - (ULONG) Number of bytes to allocate.
        Flags      - (ULONG) Standard Exec memory flags.

  RESULT
        Address - (void *) Start address of the memory block or NULL.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if an error occured.

  NAME
        GO_AttachHotKey -- Connects a hot key to a specific command.


  SYNOPSIS
        GO_AttachHotKey(GadOutline, KeyCode, CmdID)
                        A0          D0       D1     

        void GO_AttachHotKey(struct GadOutline *, ULONG, CMDID)

  FUNCTION
        Attaches the given CmdID to the requested hotkey, so that CHM_HOTKEY
        messages will automatically be sent to the command whenever the
        corresponding IDCMP_VANILLAKEY or IDCMP_RAWKEY event occurs.
        
        The key that this command will be attached to is not directly
        specified by 'KeyCode.'  Rather, this ULONG code is sent to the
        global translation hook using CHM_TRANSHOTKEY, and the resulting
        ASCII code is the actual key which is used.  This message is sent
        multiple times so that the code may be translated into more than one
        actual hotkey; this allows you to, for example, attach the command
        to both the shifted and unshifted ASCII code.
        
        The standard translation hook interprets the lower byte of the code
        as the desired ASCII character and the upper bits are used as flags
        to control the translation.  See GOCT_SetHotKey in
        <libraries/gadoutline.h> for more details.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline.
        KeyCode    - (ULONG) Code to be translated with CHM_TRANSHOTKEY.
        CmdID      - (CMDID) Command to attach to hotkey.

  RESULT
        Nothing returned.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if there was an error.

  TAGS
        

  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        To clear all hotkeys, do GO_AttachHotKey(GadOutline,0,0).

        This routine will report a level-2 notice if there is already a
        command attached to the given hotkey.  To keep this from happening,
        you must first clear the hotkey by setting it to a CmdID of 0 before
        setting it to the actual key you want.
        
        Attaching multiple commands to one hotkey using a GrpID is not
        currently supported.

        ULONG GO_CallCmdHookA(struct CmdInfo *, struct CmdHookMsg *)

  FUNCTION
        Send a message to the hook(s) attached to the given command.  Command
        is a standard CmdInfo structure retrieved using GO_GetCmdInfo().
        If the command has a user hook attached to it, it will be sent there;
        otherwise, it will be sent to the command's default hook.

        Currently defined messages:
        CHM_INITIALIZE - initialize command.  Sent during AllocGadOutlineA().
        CHM_INITCMDATTR - set initial command tag values.
        CHM_INITOBJATTR - set initial object tag values.
        CHM_INITIALIZE - quit/free resources.  Sent during FreeGadOutline().
        CHM_GETMINDIMENS - query for object's minimum dimensions.
        CHM_CREATEOBJ - create command's object - set ci_Object.
        CHM_MADELINK - inform command that another command has linked to it.
        CHM_DESTROYOBJ - deallocate current object.
        CHM_HOOKOBJ - connect object to window.
        CHM_UNHOOKOBJ - detach object from window.
        CHM_PRERESIZE - get ready to resize current object.
        CHM_RESIZEOBJ - resize object.
        CHM_DRAWSELF - draw all visuals not connected to a gadget.
        CHM_UPDATESTATE - update internal tags/state from the given GOIMsg.
        CHM_SETCMDATTR - change command tags / refresh imagery if needed.
        CHM_GETCMDATTR - copy current state of command tags into tag list.
        CHM_SETOBJATTR - change object tags / refresh imagery if needed.
        CHM_GETOBJATTR - copy current state of object tags into tag list.
        CHM_HOTKEY - perform action for hotkey event.

        See <libraries/gadoutline.h> and supplemental command documentation
        under command_hooks() for more specific information on these
        messages.

  INPUTS
        Command - (struct CmdInfo *) Command to send message to.
        Message - (struct CmdHookMsg *) Message to send.

  RESULT
        Result - (ULONG) Hook's return code.  Meaning is message dependant.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if an error occured.

        /* Send our own CmdHookMsg to simulate a hot key event */
        
        ULONG do_hotkey(struct GadOutline *go,struct CmdInfo *cmd)
        {
            ULONG ret = 0;
            struct CmdHookMsg msg;
            struct GOIMsg *event;

            if( (event = GO_DupGOIMsg(go,NULL)) != NULL ) {

                /* The standard hook will take anything that is
                   IDCMP_VANILLAKEY, so we can just set the Class field. */
                event->StdIMsg.Class = IDCMP_VANILLAKEY;

                /* Initialize the message. */
                msg->chm_Message = CHM_HOTKEY;
                msg->chm_NumArgs = 0;           /* Always set to zero */
                msg->chm_KeyGOIMsg = event;

            }

            return ret;
        }

  NOTES
        The given message structure MUST be able to be modified.  This is
        no problem if you call the varargs version as it will automatically
        be created on the stack, but if you are passing a pointer to your
        own CmdHookMsg, it is a good idea to create it on the stack and fill
        it in.  If you absolutely must use a global structure, make sure you
        initialize _every_ field in it EACH TIME before using it.

        The default command hook will send any messages that it doesn't
        understand to the GadOutline's global translation hook by calling
        GO_CallTransHook(ci->ci_GadOutline,msg).
        
        This routine will repeatedly clear the GadOutline's error state and
        send the message until the hook returns without a go_LastReqReturn
        value of GORET_RETRY.

  NAME
        GO_CallTransHookA -- Send message to global translation hook.


  SYNOPSIS
        Result = GO_CallTransHookA(GadOutline, Message)
                                   A0          A1       

        ULONG GO_CallTransHookA(struct GadOutline *, struct CmdHookMsg *)

  FUNCTION
        Sends a translation message to the global translation hook(s)
        attached to the given GadOutline.  This is very similar to
        GO_CallCmdHookA() - see the notes there about restrictions on how
        the given message may be passed.

        This hook is primarily used by the library to translate the text
        strings and other pointers within an outline while first allocating
        a GadOutline, although it is also used to translate hotkey codes.
        CHM_TRANSHOTKEY is the only translation message that will be sent
        by the library after the initial allocation of the GadOutline, but
        you are free to send other messages to do your own translations.

        Currently defined translation messages:
        CHM_TRANSCMDHOOK - return pointer to hook to attach to a CmdInfo
        CHM_TRANSEDITHOOK - return pointer to an intuition-style edit hook.
        CHM_TRANSTEXTPTR - return pointer to a null-terminated string.
        CHM_TRANSTEXTARRAY - return pointer to a null-terminated array
            of strings.
        CHM_TRANSTEXTFMT - return pointer to a null-terminated formatting
            string (ie, a standard C-style format specification).
        CHM_TRANSPUBCLASS - return a pointer to a string containing the
            name of a public BOOPSI class.
        CHM_TRANSPRIVCLASS - return a pointer to an actual instance of a
            BOOPSI private class.
        CHM_TRANSHOTKEY - return an ASCII character to use as a hotkey.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Previously allocated GadOutline.
        Message    - (struct CmdHookMsg *) The message to send.

  RESULT
        Result - (ULONG) The result of the translation; message dependant.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if an error occured.

  TAGS
        

  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        See GO_CallCmdHookA() for message restrictions.

        Most of the translation messages that library sends are first sent
        to a command using GO_CallCmdHookA() and ultimately reach the global
        translation hook when they enter the root hook, which sends all
        messages it doesn't understand to the translation hook using
        GO_CallTransHookA().  This means that the translation hook will
        receive much more than just translation commands, and is allowed to
        do something with them, if it is able to without having the
        information about the CmdInfo they are intended for.

        This routine will repeatedly clear the GadOutline's error state and
        send the message until the hook returns without a go_LastReqReturn
        value of GORET_RETRY.

                                       struct CmdInfo *, struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        Finds the commands whose boxes cover the given point within the
        message's MouseX and MouseY fields.  The operation is similar to
        GO_GetCmdInfo(), except that the x and y coordinates are used to
        filter the messages rather than a CmdID search pattern.  NULL is
        returned after all of the commands have been searched.
        
        The only fields which are looked at in the message are MouseX and
        MouseY, so you can do a search without already having a message by
        allocating a new message with GO_DupGOIMsg(GadOutline,NULL) and
        filling in those two fields with the point you wish to search for.
        
  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline.
        Message    - (struct GOIMsg *) Message to take coordinates from.
        PrevCmd    - (struct CmdInfo *) Previously returned command.
        TagList    - (struct TagItem *) Control tags.  No tags defined.

  NOTES
        All commands which have a BoxAttr will be returned; this currently
        includes boxes, groups and images.  You will need to do more
        filtering yourself if you only want to look at specific kinds.

  NAME
        GO_ContCmdHookA -- Continue a message within a hook.


  SYNOPSIS
         Result = GO_ContCmdHookA(Command, Message)
                                  A0       A1       

        ULONG GO_ContCmdHookA(struct CmdInfo *, struct CmdHookMsg *)

  FUNCTION
        Passes the processing of a message to the command's hook below
        the caller.  You will normally want to allow the standard message
        processing to occur by calling this function.

  INPUTS
        Command - (struct CmdInfo *) Command to send message to.
        Message - (struct CmdHookMsg *) Message to send.

  RESULT
        Result - (ULONG) Hook's return code.  Meaning is message dependant.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if an error occured.

  TAGS
        

  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        This function should only be called within a user hook.
        Never modify any of the fields within the message; you must pass
        the exact message that your hook received.

        messages that you do not understand or for which you are happy
        with the standard handling of the message.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) A previously allocated GadOutline.
        Message - (struct CmdHookMsg *) Message to send.

  RESULT
        Result - (ULONG) Hook's return code.  Meaning is message dependant.

  NAME
        GO_DupGOIMsg -- Duplicate a GOIMsg or IntuiMessage.


  SYNOPSIS
        NewMessage = GO_DupGOIMsg(GadOutline, Message)
                                  A0          A1       

        struct GOIMsg *GO_DupGOIMsg(struct GadOutline *, struct GOIMsg *)

  FUNCTION
        Allocates a new GOIMsg and copies the given message into it.  There
        are three distinct operations that can be performed:
        
        If 'Message' is a GOIMsg, a direct copy will be performed.
        
        If 'Message' is an IntuiMessage, all of the IntuiMessage fields will
        be copied into the corresponding fields in the GOIMsg.

        If 'Message' is NULL, a brand new GOIMsg will be allocated and
        initialized.  You currently should not count on any of the fields of
        the new GOIMsg being set to sane values.
        
  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) An allocated GadOutline.
        Message    - (struct GOIMsg *) Message to duplicate.

  RESULT
        NewMessage - (struct GOIMsg *) The newly allocated message or NULL
                                       if unable to allocate any memory.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if there was an error.

  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        The ExecMessage within the IntuiMessage part of the GOIMsg is
        reserved for private use by the library and should not touched or
        looked at in any way.
        
        This message is attached to the supplied GadOutline and will be
        free'd at the time that the GadOutline is free'd.
        
        Supplying a NULL GadOutline will result in first trying to use any
        GadOutline attached to the given message (ie, calling
        GO_GetGOFromGOIMsg) and, if that fails, not attaching it to any
        GadOutline.
        
        ReplyMsg() should never be called with a duplicated message.

  NAME
        GO_FilterGOIMsg -- Send message to library for special processing.


  SYNOPSIS
        NewMsg = GO_FilterGOIMsg(GadOutline, Message)
                                 A0          A1       

        struct GOIMsg *GO_FilterGOIMsg(struct GadOutline *, 
                                       struct IntuiMessage *)

  FUNCTION
        Performs library-specific filtering and massaging of a raw
        IntuiMessage before being ready for the application to look at.
        This includes executing hot keys, tracking the gadgets' states,
        and watching for window resizing and resize verify events.
        
        Extended message information is supplied in the GOIMsg structure, in
        addition to that already provided by Intuition and GadTools.  If the
        message is a IDCMP_RAWKEY or IDCMP_VANILLAKEY event, the KeyPress
        field will contain the translated key event.  For IDCMP_VANILLAKEY
        this is just a string with a single character corresponding to the
        message's code.  IDCMP_RAWKEY events will be translated using
        MapRawKey(), with the resulting string stored in KeyPress.  The high
        bit of the raw key codes is cleared before mapping so that both key
        down and up events will have a KeyPress.
                
        The UserData field of the message is free to be used by the user's
        custom hook or whatever else.
        
        The returned message may be NULL if the library ate it, in which
        case you will still need to call GO_PostFilterGOIMsg() to retrieve
        the original message.  After you have called GO_PostFilterGOIMsg(),
        you should call GO_FilterGOIMsg() with a NULL message to retrieve
        any additional messages that have been generated, and then release
        them with GO_PostFilterGOIMsg().
        
        This is similar to GadTools' GT_FilterIMsg().

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) .
        Message    - (struct IntuiMessage *) .

  RESULT
        NewMsg - (struct GOIMsg *) The message you should use.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if there was an error.

  NOTES
        This function does not call GT_FilterIMsg().  You will need to do
        that before calling it.

  FUNCTION
        Fills in the given tag list with the current command tag state of the
        command which has the given ID.  This essentially involves finding
        the command using GO_GetCmdInfo() and sending it a CHM_GETCMDATTR
        message with the given tag list.
        
        While the actual action performed is command-dependant, the standard
        hook will fill in the given tag list from its local command tags and
        then fill in any tags it understands with its current state
        information.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline.
        StdID      - (CMDID) The ID of a single command to get tags from.
        Flags      - (ULONG) Reserved.  Always set to zero.
        TagList    - (struct TagItem *) Tags to retrieve.

  RESULT
        No return value.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if there was an error.

  TAGS
        

  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        None of the standard hooks currently copy their state into the
        supplied tags, so the only values you will get are what is in the
        command's tag list.  This means that you must supply all tags whose
        state you want to track when you allocate the GadOutline.

  NAME
        GO_GetCmdInfo -- Find the CmdInfo structure with the given CmdID.


  SYNOPSIS
        Command = GO_GetCmdInfo(GadOutline, SearchID, PrevCmd)
                                A0          D0        A1       

        struct CmdInfo *GO_GetCmdInfo(struct GadOutline *, CMDID, 
                                      struct CmdInfo *)

  FUNCTION
        This is the only defined way to extract a CmdInfo from a GadOutline.
        It can be used to find either a single command, or a group of
        commands with simlar IDs.

        A CmdID is a long-word quantity divided into 2 fields.  The lower
        12 bits are the StdID, an ID number unique to this single command.
        The upper 20 bits are the GrpID, which is used to describe groupings
        between similar commands and is itself divided into 2 parts, an 8
        bit CODE field and a 12 bit MASK.

        All commands must have a unique StdID, except for the special value
        of 0, which means "don't care."  The StdID is the primary method
        used to refer to commands, so any commands with an ID of 0 will be
        unable to be the object of TagLinks, hot keys, etc.

        The exact meaning placed on the GrpID is program-dependant.
        Typically, it will be used to do things like assign a MASK bit to
        commands that need to be disabled at the same time, so that this
        can be accomplished with a single call to GO_SetObjGrpAttrsA().

        When extracting a single CmdInfo from a GadOutline, this function
        is called with the ID value in SearchID and a NULL PrevCmd.  The
        StdID and MASK and CODE GrpIDs within the SearchID are each treated
        as independant search components; a zero in any of them is given the
        special meaning "match anything" and will be ignored during the
        search.  For a complete match to occur, ALL non-zero fields must
        identically match the command's assigned CmdID.  [Note that in this
        case each bit of the GrpID MASK is treated as a separate field.]

        So, to find a command assigned to a StdID, the SearchID will simply
        be the StdID; the GrpID portion of the search will be 0 to ignore
        whatever the command's GrpID may be.

        When searching for multiple commands, this function is first called
        with PrevCmd NULL, and then repetatively called with PrevCmd set
        to the value the previous call returned.  A NULL will be returned
        when all of the matching commands have been found.  In this case,
        you will likely want to set the StdID to 0; otherwise, you will
        only be returned the single StdID that matches the given SearchID.

        When searching for multiple commands using the GrpIDs, the CODE
        field behaves identically to a StdID, except that multiple commands
        may have the same CODE and all of those that match will be returned.
        The MASK field is a little bit different; each bit in the SearchID
        can be set or cleared to identify which bits you want to look for
        This, a SearchID with GO_GRPID_A will match commands with GrpIDs of
        GO_GRPID_A, GO_GRPID_A | GO_GRPID_B, etc.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline.
        SearchID   - (CMDID) ID code(s) to search for.
        PrevCmd    - (struct CmdInfo *) Previous command that was found.

  RESULT
        Command - (struct CmdInfo *) The command that was found.

  TAGS
        

  EXAMPLE
        Assuming you have three commands in your GadOutline assigned:
        Cmd1: GO_CMDID( 0, 1 )
        Cmd2: GO_CMDID( GO_GRPID_A, 2 )
        Cmd3: GO_CMDID( GO_GRPID_A | GO_GRPID_B, 3 )
        Cmd4: GO_CMDID( GO_GRPID_A | 100, 4 )
        Cmd5: GO_CMDID( GO_GRPID_B | 100, 5 )
        Cmd6: GO_CMDID( GO_GRPID_A | GO_GRPID_B | 100, 6 )
        Cmd7: GO_CMDID( 0, 0 )

        A SearchID of 1 will return only Cmd1, of 2 only Cmd2, etc.

        A SearchID of GO_CMDID(GO_GRPID_B,0) will return Cmd3, Cmd5, Cmd6.

        GO_CMDID(GO_GRPID_A|GO_GRPID_A,0) will return Cmd3 and Cmd6.

        GO_CMDID(GO_GRPID_A|100,0) will return Cmd4 and Cmd6.

        GO_CMDID(0,0) will return all commands, including Cmd7.


        /* Tell every command to draw itself. */

        void draw_all(struct GadOutline *go)
        {
            struct CmdInfo *ci;

            ci = NULL;
            while( (ci = GO_GetCmdInfo(go,0,ci)) != NULL ) {
                GO_CallCmdHook(ci,CHM_DRAWSELF,0);
            }
        }

  NOTES
        If multiple commands within the GadOutline have the same StdID,
        this function's behaviour is undefined and will likely change.

        The order that multiple commands are returned to you is currently
        not defined; do not depend on getting them in any particular order.

        Never change the SearchID you are using in the middle of finding
        a group of commands.

        When a CmdInfo is returned, it will be set as the current command
        for GO_InterpretTypedSize() and GO_ParseTypedSizeListA().

  FUNCTION
        Returns the GadOutline that owns this message, ie the one that
        allocated it using GO_DupGOIMsg().  Note that this may not be the
        GadOutline that the original IntuiMessage is associated with,

        create a message like this without being explicately told to.
        
        Passing this function an IntuiMessage rather than an actual GOIMsg
        is allowed and will result in it falling back to GO_GetGOFromImsg().

  INPUTS

  FUNCTION
        Retrieves the GadOutline that owns the window from which this
        IntuiMessage came.  The library uses the window's UserData
        field as a back-pointer to the GadOutline that is attached to the
        window, but you should call this function rather than directly
        accessing the field yourself.

  INPUTS
        Message - (struct IntuiMessage *) An IntuiMessage from Intuition.

  RESULT
        MsgGO - (struct GadOutline *) This message's window's GadOutline.

  FUNCTION
        Fills in the given tag list with the current object tag state of the
        command which has the given ID.  This essentially involves finding
        the command using GO_GetCmdInfo() and sending it a CHM_GETOBJATTR
        message with the given tag list.
        
        While the actual action performed is command-dependant, the standard
        hook will fill in the given tag list from its local objects tags.
        Higher-level hooks may fill in the tags with more information; for
        example, a BOOPSI hook may call GetAttrs() for each tag in the list.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline.
        StdID      - (CMDID) The ID of a single command to get tags from.
        Flags      - (ULONG) Reserved.  Always set to zero.

  NAME
        GO_InterpretTypedSize -- Return the value of a single TypedSize.


  SYNOPSIS
        Value = GO_InterpretTypedSize(GadOutline, CurrentValue, TypedSize)
                                      A0          D0            D1         

        LONG GO_InterpretTypedSize(struct GadOutline *, LONG, TYPEDSIZE)

  FUNCTION
        Computes the actual value for a typed size.  A typed size is a
        single ULONG quantity composed of three fields - the mode, type
        and quantity. The type is one of the GOT_* values and describes
        how to interpret the number in quantity.  For example,
        GOT_PercCharW is a type which says that the quantity is units of
        percentages of a character width. These two fields combined
        produce an absolute number, and the mode field then describes an
        operation to perform between this computed number and the previous
        one passed in CurrentValue.

        The various types available can be broken down into three major
        groups. The first are miscellaneous units based on global layout
        information - character width and height, layout minimum and
        maximum dimensions. The type GOT_Pixels uses the value as an
        absolute number and GOT_PercScale is used to scale the given
        CurrentValue by a percentage in the value field.

        The next group operates on text strings.  Types are provided to
        find the width and height of a text string, and the minimum,
        maximum and addition of these dimensions for multiple strings.  In
        addition, the strings can also be viewed in terms of characters
        and lines.

        Finally, the largest group is based on the dimensions of a
        command. The more important types are GOT_PercBoxW and
        GOT_PercBoxH, which provide the current complete size of the box;
        GOT_PercUnusedW and GOT_PercUnusedH are the amount of extra
        spacing assigned to a box which it has not used yet.  See the
        header file for a complete description of these types.
        
        A special type is GOT_BoxSize.  Its value field is not intepreted as
        a number, but rather the lower 12 bits are interpreted as the StdID
        of a BoxAttr's command and the upper 4 bits are used to identify a
        particular dimension of the box to extract.

        There are currently six modes available.  GOM_Set simply returns
        the computed type and value, and ignores CurrentValue.  GOM_Max
        returns the larger of the computed and given values while GOM_Min
        returns the smaller.  GOM_Add adds the two values together,
        GOM_Mul multiplies them, and GOM_Div divides the given
        CurrentValue by the newly computed value.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline   - (struct GadOutline *) Previously allocated GadOutline.
        CurrentValue - (LONG) The value to start out with.
        TypedSize    - (TYPEDSIZE) The typed size to interpret.

  RESULT
        Value - (LONG) The final computed result.

  EXAMPLE
        Assuming the current font is Topaz 8:

        GO_InterpretTypedSize(go, 20, GO_TSIZE(GOM_Set,100,GOT_Pixels))
            ==> 100
        GO_InterpretTypedSize(go, 20, GO_TSIZE(GOM_Set,100,GOT_PercCharH))
            ==> 8
        GO_InterpretTypedSize(go, 20, GO_TSIZE(GOM_Add,100,GOT_PercCharH))
            ==> 28
        GO_InterpretTypedSize(go, 20, GO_TSIZE(GOM_Add,-100,GOT_PercCharH))
            ==> 12
        GO_InterpretTypedSize(go, 20, GO_TSIZE(GOM_Max,100,GOT_Pixels))
            ==> 100
        GO_InterpretTypedSize(go, 20, GO_TSIZE(GOM_Min,100,GOT_Pixels))
            ==> 20

  NOTES
        To do a subtraction, use GOM_Add and a negative value field.

        The upper bits of the mode field, which flag the particular SPC, PAD
        and VAR components to modify, are ignored by this function except
        when using complex units, which can have different values for each
        of the components.

        Many of the types depend on previously set state information.  In
        particular, all of the ones that refer to various dimensions of a
        command's BoxAttr need to know which command to look at.  If you
        are calling this function within a user hook, this value will
        always have been set to point to your command.  Otherwise, you can
        explicately set the current command by calling GO_GetCmdInfo()
        with the ID of the command you want to look at.

        The text size types - GOT_PercText* - need to have one or more
        text strings to refer to.  These can be set by calling
        GO_ParseTypedSizeListA() with the appropriate tags; they will
        remain in context for subsequent calls to GO_InterpretTypedSize().

  NAME
        GO_OpenLibrary -- Open a standard system library.


  SYNOPSIS
        LibBase = GO_OpenLibrary(GadOutline, ErrReport, Name, Version)
                          A0          D0         A1    D1       

        struct Library *GO_OpenLibrary(struct GadOutline *, GOERR, UBYTE *, 
                                       ULONG)

  FUNCTION
        Opens the specified library and returns its base address.  This
        library is NOT currently tracked by the system; you will have to
        free it yourself.

        ErrReport specifies what to do if the library can not be opened.
        If it is 0, the library will simply return NULL.  Otherwise, it
        is interpreted as a standard error code and the library will call
        GO_SetError() with the given error if unable to open the library.
        If the selected error has a RETRY choice, the library will attempt
        to open it if this is selected; if it is then able to get it, the
        caller will never know there was a problem.

        A shortcut is provided in specifying the error.  If the error
        type field is zero, the library will interpret the code field
        as the type and automatically use the library code - ie,
        GO_MAKEERR(GETERRCODE(ErrReport),GOCODE_OPENLIB).

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocate GadOutline or NULL.
        ErrReport  - (GOERR) Error to report if the allocation fails.
        Name       - (UBYTE *) Name of the library to open.
        Version    - (ULONG) Minimum version of the library.

  RESULT
        LibBase - (struct Library *) The base address of the library or NULL.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if an error occured.

        FreeGadOutline() is called, this may be added in the future, so
        always be sure to call GO_CloseLibrary() before freeing a
        GadOutline used with GO_OpenLibrary().

  NAME
        GO_OpenScreenA -- GadOutline open screen interface.


  SYNOPSIS
        Screen = GO_OpenScreenA(GadOutline, TagList)
                                A0          A1       

        struct Screen *GO_OpenScreenA(struct GadOutline *, struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        Not currently implemented.

        The general algorithm for doing a font-sensitive OpenScreen() is:

        - AllocGadOutline()
        - DimenGadOutline() with the DisplayID and overscan mode you will be
          using, and any other information you care about such as font
          preferece.
        - OpenScreen() with the resulting font in go_TextAttr (NOTE: You
          must make a copy of this to use, as there is no guarantee that it
          will not change.)
        - GO_OpenWindow() on the new screen.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocate GadOutline.
        TagList    - (struct TagItem *) Standard screen tags (SA_*).

  RESULT
        Screen - (struct Screen *) A newly opened screen or NULL.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if there was an error.

  NAME
        GO_OpenWindowA -- GadOutline open window interface.


  SYNOPSIS
        Window = GO_OpenWindowA(GadOutline, TagList)
                                A0          A1       

        struct Window *GO_OpenWindowA(struct GadOutline *, struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        Opens a window and attaches it to the given GadOutline.  The tags
        passed to OpenWindow() are the combination of the tag list passed to
        the function and the object tags of a GO_WINDOWTAGS() command within
        the outline, if it is supplied.  If a tag appears in both the
        GO_OpenWindowA() list and GO_WINDOWTAGS() list, the former will
        override the later.
        
        The screen to open the window on is derived in the following way:
        
        WA_PubScreen will be sent to DimenGadOutlineA() as GOA_ScreenAddr;
        the resulting screen in go_Screen will be used in the WA_PubScreen
        tag.

        WA_CustomScreen will be sent to DimenGadOutlineA() as GOA_ScreenAddr;
        the resulting screen in go_Screen will be used in the
        WA_CustomScreen tag.
        
        WA_PubScreenName and WA_PubScreenFallBack will be sent to
        DimenGadOutlineA() as GOA_ScreenName and GOA_ScreenFallBack.  If
        WA_PubScreen is not supplied, GOA_ScreenFallBack will be FALSE.  The
        resulting screen will then be used in a WA_PubScreen tag and the
        original WA_PubScreenName is removed from the tag list.

        If none of these tags are present, the window will be opened on the
        current screen attached to the GadOutline.  If no screen is attached,
        DimenGadOutlineA() with { GOA_ScreenAddr, NULL } will be called to
        attempt to lock the default public screen.  In either case, the
        screen address will be passed using WA_PublicScreen if it is a
        public screen the library has a lock on, or WA_CustomScreen if it
        was attached to the GadOutline using a non-NULL GOA_ScreenAddr.

        If any error has occured at this point, any screen will be detached
        from the GadOutline and a NULL will be returned.
        
        The window's default dimensions are determined by the
        GOA_WindowRelative flag; if non-NULL the default width and height
        will be the current minimum inner width of the layout (or full width
        if WA_AutoAdjust is FALSE) and the left and top edges will be set
        such that the window is positioned within the screen's current
        viewable area and not obscuring its title bar.  Otherwise, they will
        all be initialized to zero.
        
        These default dimensions are then modified by the following tags:
        
        WA_InnerWidth will be added to the window's default width.  If not
        specified and GOA_SaveWinDimens is TRUE, the previous width of the
        window will be used.
        
        WA_InnerHeight will be added to the window's default height.  If not
        specified and GOA_SaveWinDimens is TRUE, the previous height of the
        window will be used.
        
        WA_Width and WA_Height will completely override the default width
        and height.
        
        WA_Left will be added to the window's default left edge.  If not
        specified and GOA_SaveWinDimens is TRUE, the previous left edge of
        the window will be used.
        
        WA_Top will be added to the window's default top edge.  If not
        specified and GOA_SaveWinDimens is TRUE, the previous top edge of
        the window will be used.
        
        The rest of the tags are passed as-is to OpenWindow(), except for
        the following modifications:
        
        WA_AutoAdjust will be TRUE by default.  You must explicately set it
        to FALSE if this is not what you want.
        
        WA_MinWidth and WA_MinHeight will, if not specified, be set to the
        minimum dimensions of the layout.
        
        WA_MaxWidth and WA_MaxHeight will, if not specified, be set to ~0.
        
        WA_IDCMP may will have additional flags added to it if
        GOA_AddOutlineIDCMP or GOA_AddObjectIDCMP are TRUE.  If a custom IDCMP
        has been requested with GOA_UserIDCMP, the window will be opened with
        this tag set to zero, then port attached to it, and ModifyIDCMP()
        then called to set the correct value.
        
        The window will then be opened and attached to the GadOutline using
        DimenGadOutlineA() and GOA_WindowAddr.  If either the window can not
        be opened or there is an error when attaching it, it will be closed
        and a NULL returned.
        
        If the window is opened successfully, any menu strip will be layed
        out and attached to it and the address of the window will be
        returned.  Note that you should normally only use this return value
        as a TRUE/FALSE indicator of whether the function call was
        successfull, and use the address in go_Window to reference the
        actual window.
        
  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline.
        TagList    - (struct TagItem *) Window's tags (WA_*).

  RESULT
        Window - (struct Window *) The resulting window or NULL.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if there was an error.

  NAME
        GO_ParseTypedSizeListA -- Compute a complete TypedSize tag list.


  SYNOPSIS
        Value = GO_ParseTypedSizeListA(GadOutline, CurrentValue,
                                       A0          D0
                                       TypedSizeTags)
                                       A1

        LONG GO_ParseTypedSizeListA(struct GadOutline *, LONG,
                                    struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        Interprets all of a complete list of TypedSize tags.  CurrentValue
        provides the initial value for the list; it is then successively
        modified by the TypedSize tags in the list.

        This routine is essentially like successively calling
        GO_InterpretTypedSize() and providing the result of one call to the
        CurrentValue parameter of the next.  However, it also allows text
        strings to be examined using the GOCT_Text* and GOCT_MoreText*
        tags.  Each TypedSize is provided in the ti_Data field of a
        GOCT_SizeParse tag.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline    - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline.
        CurrentValue  - (LONG) The initial value for the parse.
        TypedSizeTags - (struct TagItem *) TypedSize and control tag list.

  RESULT
        Value - (LONG) The final size computed.

  TAGS
        

  EXAMPLE
        Assuming Topaz 8:

        GO_ParseTypedSize(go,0,
                GOCT_TextPtr,   "1234567890",
                GOCT_SizeParse, GO_TSIZE(GOM_Set,1000,GOT_PercTextMaxW),
                GOCT_SizeParse, GO_TSIZE(GOM_Add,100,GOT_PercTextMaxH),
                TAG_END);
        ==> 808

  NOTES
        See the notes for GO_InterpretTypedSize().
        
        All standard tags - TAG_MORE, TAG_SKIP, etc. - can be used.

        struct IntuiMessage *GO_PostFilterGOIMsg(struct GOIMsg *)

  FUNCTION
        Releases the GOIMsg back to the library and returns the original
        IntuiMessage to be sent to GadTools and reply'd.  Additional message
        processing is performed at this time, primarily dealing with
        tracking IDCMP_NEWSIZE and IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY messages.
        
        A NULL OldMsg will be returned if the given GOIMsg was generated
        solely by the library.

        This is similar to GadTools' GT_FilterIMsg().

  INPUTS
        Message - (struct GOIMsg *) Message returned from GO_FilterGOIMsg().

  RESULT
        OldMsg - (struct IntuiMessage *) Original GadTools/Intuition message.

        void GO_SetCmdAttrsA(struct GadOutline *, CMDID, ULONG, 
                             struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        Changes the command tag list (ie, the first tag list) of the
        command(s) with the given CmdID.  This is identical to
        GO_SetCmdGrpAttrsA(), except that a CmdID of 0 will result in no
        commands being changed rather than all of them, providing some
        protection against accidentally using a StdID of 0.
        
        While this function can be used with a non-zero group ID and
        multiple commands, GO_SetCmdGrpAttrsA() is the recomended interface
        for these types of operations.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline.
        CmdID      - (CMDID) ID pattern of command(s) to change.
        Flags      - (ULONG) Reserved.  Always set to zero.
        TagList    - (struct TagItem *) Tags to change.

  RESULT
        No return value.

  NAME
        GO_SetCmdGrpAttrsA -- Modify one or more commands' command tag list.


  SYNOPSIS
        GO_SetCmdGrpAttrsA(GadOutline, CmdID, Flags, TagList)
                           A0          D0     D1     A1       

        void GO_SetCmdGrpAttrsA(struct GadOutline *, CMDID, ULONG, 
                                struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        Changes the command tag list (ie, the first tag list) of the
        command(s) with the given CmdID.  This essentially involves sending
        a CHM_SETCMDATTR message to every CmdInfo returned by calling
        GO_GetCmdInfo() with the given CmdID.
        
        The exact interpretation of this operation is command-dependant;
        however, the standard hook will copy all of the supplied tags into
        its local tag list and update its internal flags to reflect these
        new values.

        If you are specifically changing only one command,
        GO_SetCmdAttrsA() is the recomended function to use.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline.
        CmdID      - (CMDID) ID pattern of command(s) to change.
        Flags      - (ULONG) Reserved.  Always set to zero.

  NAME
        GO_SetErrorA -- Set a GadOutline's error code.


  SYNOPSIS
        Return = GO_SetErrorA(GadOutline, ErrorCode, ErrorObject, Params)
                              A0          D0         A1           A2      

        ULONG GO_SetErrorA(struct GadOutline *, GOERR, void *, UBYTE **)

  FUNCTION
        Sets the current error code and error object of the given outline
        to ErrorCode and ErrorObject; writes variables pointed to by
        GOA_ErrorCode and GOA_ErrorText tags, if they are non-NULL, to these
        new values.  If the bit corresponding to this error type in the
        GOA_ErrorReportLevel tag is set, the error will then be displayed
        by calling GO_ShowErrorA(GadOutline,NULL,NULL,Params).  The value
        returned will be put in go_LastReqReturn and returned to the caller.

        If the error report bit for this error type is cleared, this same
        bit will then be checked in the tag GOA_ErrorFailLevel.  If it is
        1, the function will return GORET_FAIL, otherwise GORET_CONT will
        be returned.  In either case, no error will be reported to the
        user.

        An error code of 0 will clear any errors and set go_LastReqReturn
        to GORET_CONT.

        If GadOutline is NULL, this function will just call GO_ShowErrorA()
        with the given parameters.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline  - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline or NULL.
        ErrorCode   - (GOERR) Error code and type to set.
        ErrorObject - (void *) Error code dependant object.
        Params      - (UBYTE **) Optional additional text to display.

  RESULT
        Return - (ULONG) One of GORET_CONT, GORET_RETRY or GORET_FAIL.

  TAGS
        

  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        'Params' will only be used if an error is displayed automatically by
        this function.  If you have an error type turned off and, after it
        occurs, show it yourself by calling GO_ShowErrorA(go,NULL,NULL,NULL),
        any additional text that was attached to it will not be displayed.

        The library at some points needs to turn off errors while executing
        internally.  You should never notice this within your main program,
        but it may be in this state when calling a user hook, especially
        when sending CHM_UNHOOKOBJ and CHM_DESTROYOBJ messages.  You should
        never create errors from these messages (or any other message that
        frees resources), so this shouldn't be a problem.

        Be careful about how you mark error type failures for any you turn
        off.  In general, you should never mark a type as a failure if it
        does not a have a fail button, or mark types without a continue
        button as non-failures.  This means that types GOTYPE_FAIL and
        GOTYPE_ALERT should always be failures, GOTYPE_WARN and GOTYPE_NOTE
        can be either, and GOTYPE_FINE should never be a failure.

        Library errors are generally divided into the primary type (ie,
        GOTYPE_WARN) being a system error, the second type (ie,
        GOTYPE_WARN2) being programmer debugging errors (such as having
        a non-unique StdID in an outline), and the third type (ie,
        GOTYPE_WARN3) being library debugging errors.  You will usually
        want to have all primary and secondary errors reported during
        program development so that you can catch errors in your outline
        definition and other problems.  It is perfectly fine to always leave
        these on, although there may be times that you need to turn them
        off in a release version if you need to keep the library from
        complaining about something like assigning a hotkey that is already
        attached to another command.

  NAME
        GO_SetObjAttrsA -- Modify a command's object tag list.


  SYNOPSIS
        GO_SetObjAttrsA(GadOutline, CmdID, Flags, TagList)
                        A0          D0     D1     A1       

        void GO_SetObjAttrsA(struct GadOutline *, CMDID, ULONG, 
                             struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        Changes the object tag list (ie, the second tag list) of the
        command(s) with the given CmdID.  This is identical to
        GO_SetObjGrpAttrsA(), except that a CmdID of 0 will result in no
        commands being changed rather than all of them, providing some
        protection against accidentally using a StdID of 0.
        
        While this function can be used with a non-zero group ID and
        multiple commands, GO_SetObjGrpAttrsA() is the recomended interface
        for these types of operations.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline.
        CmdID      - (CMDID) ID pattern of command(s) to change.
        Flags      - (ULONG) Reserved.  Always set to zero.
        TagList    - (struct TagItem *) Tags to change.

  RESULT
        No return value.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if there was an error.

  TAGS
        

  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        This command is not fully supported while in an unhooked state.

  NAME
        GO_SetObjGrpAttrsA -- Modify one or more commands' object tag list.


  SYNOPSIS
        GO_SetObjGrpAttrsA(GadOutline, CmdID, Flags, TagList)
                           A0          D0     D1     A1       

        void GO_SetObjGrpAttrsA(struct GadOutline *, CMDID, ULONG, 
                                struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        Changes the object tag list (ie, the first tag list) of the
        command(s) with the given CmdID.  This essentially involves sending
        a CHM_SETOBJATTR message to every CmdInfo returned by calling
        GO_GetCmdInfo() with the given CmdID.
        
        The exact interpretation of this operation is command-dependant;
        however, the standard hook will copy all of the supplied tags into
        its local tag list and update its object to update these new flags.
        For example, the standard GadTools hook calls GT_SetGadAttrs() with
        the given tag list.  Depending on the command and tags specified,
        this may cause the object to update its current imagery.

        If you are specifically changing only one command,
        GO_SetObjAttrsA() is the recomended function to use.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Allocated GadOutline.
        CmdID      - (CMDID) ID pattern of command(s) to change.
        Flags      - (ULONG) Reserved.  Always set to zero.
        TagList    - (struct TagItem *) Tags to change.

  RESULT
        No return value.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if there was an error.

  NAME
        GO_ShowErrorA -- Display a standard GadOutline error requester.


  SYNOPSIS
        Return = GO_ShowErrorA(GadOutline, ErrorCode, ErrorObject, Params)
                               A0          D0         A1           A2      

        ULONG GO_ShowErrorA(struct GadOutline *, GOERR, void *, UBYTE **)

  FUNCTION
        Displays an error requester explaining the current error and waits
        for user input.  The exact error to display is determined by
        ErrorCode; if its type is non-zero (ie, not GOTYPE_NONE), the
        requester displays the error code and type given.  Otherwise, it
        displays the GadOutline's current error, as given by
        GO_GetErrorCode().
        
        ErrorObject provides more detailed information about the error, and
        its exact meaning is error-code dependant; see GO_GetErrorObject()
        for information about what object each code expects.
        
        The standard error requester's title is either the text supplied in
        GOA_BaseName or, if that has not been set, defaults to "GadOutline
        Requester".  The body displayed is in the form:
        
        +-------------------------+
        | (<T>) <Type text> #<C>: |
        | <Code text>.            |
        |                         |
        | <Additional information>|
        | <Extra parameters>      |
        +-------------------------+
        
        Where <T> is the error type number, <Type text> is the textual
        interpretation of that type (ie, type #8 is "Warning"), <C> is the
        code number, and <Code text> is the description of the error code.
        Errors which have an object will then fill in more detailed
        information in the <Additional information> field; what exactly is
        displayed here and the number of lines is code dependant.  Finally,
        any user-supplied parameter(s) are appended to the bottom.
        
        The user supplied parameters are passed in 'Params.'  This is a
        pointer to a string pointer, followed by its arguments, as per
        Intuition's EasyRequestA() function.  This provides the standard
        C-style formatting arguments identical to EasyRequestA().
        
        The library also provides three additional formatting escape
        characters: ^ provides global GadOutline information, ~ provides
        object-dependant information, and ` is reserved for future use.
        This sequences are in the form of the escape character followed by a
        two-character code, ie "^lb" will be translated into the maximum
        outline size, as given by GOA_OutlineSize.  A special sequence of the
        escape character followed by itself will be reduced to a single
        escape, ie if the GOA_OutlineSize is 10, "^lb^^^lb" will display the
        text "10^10".
        
        The object formatting character ~ determines how the object will be
        interpreted; the library has no way of determining what the object
        actually is except by the formatting sequences used, so you should
        be careful about what you are actually giving it.
        
        The available buttons at the bottom of the requester are determined
        by the error type.  They are:
        GOTYPE_NONE  - "CONTINUE"
        GOTYPE_NOTE  - "CONTINUE" / "ABORT"
        GOTYPE_WARN  - "CONTINUE" / "RETRY" / "ABORT"
        GOTYPE_ALERT - "RETRY" / "ABORT"
        GOTYPE_FAIL  - "ABORT"
        
        The value returned by the function will be one of GORET_CONT,
        GORET_RETRY or GORET_FAIL, depending on whether the user selected
        "CONTINUE", "RETRY" or "ABORT", respectively.
        
        A special display mode is provided when the error code (the lower 16
        bits of the error) is GOCODE_NONE.  In this case, none of the
        standard information (error type, code, addition information) is
        displayed, and instead only the user parameters are used.  Which
        buttons are displayed, however, is still determined by the error
        type.  This us useful it you want to display your own custom
        requester.
        
        The formatting codes currently recognized are:

  NOTES
        All error codes which expect a pointer to something for their object
        will interpret NULL as "none available".  You should always supply a
        NULL object for any codes which currently have no defined object;
        this is the only object value which will always be safe to use.

        This function does not set go_LastReqReturn.

  BUGS
        If one of the standard errors prints a string (ie, from an actual
        string object or the label of a command) which contains a "%", this
        will be blindly passed on to EasyRequest, which will interpret it as
        a C-style formatter.

        struct GOIMsg *GO_UndupGOIMsg(struct GOIMsg *)

  FUNCTION
        Frees a message that was allocated with GO_DupGOIMsg().  Exactly
        what is returned depends what the given message is:

        If it is a GOIMsg returned by calling GO_DupGOIMsg() with a GOIMsg
        or IntuiMessage, the message upon which it was based will be
        returned.
        
        If it is a GOIMsg returned by calling GO_DupGOIMsg() with a NULL
        message, a NULL will be returned.
        
        If it is an actual IntuiMessage, this same IntuiMessage will simply
        be returned.
        
  INPUTS
        Message - (struct GOIMsg *) A previously dupped message.

  RESULT
        OldMessage - (struct GOIMsg *) What this message was based on.

  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        This routine does not actually free the memory used by the message,
        but rather puts it back on a 'free message list' of the GadOutline
        which allocated it, to be reused by GO_DupGOIMsg().

  NAME
        RebuildGadOutlineA -- Perform a final layout on a GadOutline.


  SYNOPSIS
        RebuildGadOutlineA(GadOutline, TagList)
                           A0          A1       

        void RebuildGadOutlineA(struct GadOutline *, struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        This function performs the second part of a complete layout.  It
        first calles UpdateGadOutlineA() with the given tags and then uses
        the box and groups' minimum dimension information and the required
        minimum size of the layout to find the final size that everything
        needs to be.  It then positions the boxes and groups, processes the
        final box dimension tags [ie, GOCT_SetBoxLeft] for all boxes, groups
        and images, fills in the global information tags [ie,
        GOCT_CopyScreen], and finally creates the gadgets by sending
        CHM_CREATEOBJ messages to every command after resolving all of its
        tag links.

        This phase is concerned with what to do with any extra space
        within within the layout.  This extra space may come from two
        distinct places - the difference between the entire layout's base
        dimension, as computed by DimenGadOutlineA(), and the minimum size
        allowed, and the difference between a group's minimum size and the
        size of the individual boxes within it.  However, these two are,
        for the most part, treated as a single quantity by the library.

        The layout starts at the root group; the amount of space needed to
        make it fit the GadOutline's minimum dimensions is distributed to
        each of its children in its running dimension according to their
        relative weights, and in the static dimension it is summed with
        the difference between the group's minimum size and each child's. 
        Each child group will then distribute the space it received in a
        similar fashion.

        When a box receives its extra space, it distributes it among its
        various areas.  By default, the box will simply put all of it in
        its body area, but this behavior can be changed by providing a
        custom weight distribution and using TypedSize commands changing
        the VAR component.

        Two tags are available to control the way the library performs the
        layout.  The tag GOCT_AutoDistExtra will cause a box or group to
        try to distribute the extra space within itself so that it matches
        its parent's final dimensions, and GOCT_IgnoreFinDimens will make
        the library ignore a box or group's dimensions, essentially
        putting the group or box that follows on top of it.

        Once the final dimensions have been determined, another run
        through the layout will be performed to compute the final
        positions of the groups and boxes.  Finally, a last run through the
        entire outline will be performed to execute the GOCT_Set* command
        tags for all boxes, groups and images, after which any attached
        BoxPosInfo will be filled in and the GOCT_Copy* global information
        tags will be executed along with GOCT_CopyUser1ToTag and
        GOCT_CopyUser2ToTag.

        After the layout is finished, the library will run through the
        entire command list and send each a CHM_CREATEOBJ.  At this time,
        all TagLinks are resolved by reordering the gadget creation.  If
        the library is unable to find an order to that will resolve the
        links [ie, you have two commands pointing to each other], it will
        not create either command.  If any hook returns a non-zero
        go_LastReqReturn, the entire creation will be aborted.  However, a
        command not creating an object [not setting its ci_Object field to
        a non-NULL value] is NOT considered an error.  If the command has
        GOCT_IgnoreCreation set to TRUE, or if this is a box or group and
        any of its parent groups has GOCT_IgnoreCreation set to true, it is
        completely ignored and no CHM_CREATEOBJ is sent to it, even if
        there is a TagLink connected to it.

        If GOA_SetWindowFont is TRUE, the window's font will be set before
        creating the gadgets.

        If there are no errors while creating the gadgets, the library
        calls HookGadOutlineA() with an empty tag list.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Previously allocated GadOutline.
        TagList - (struct TagItem *) Global (GOA_*) outline tags, parsed
                  before the actual layout is performed.

  RESULT
        Nothing returned from the function.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if an error occured.

  TAGS
        Command tags -
            GOCT_AutoDistExtra - distribute dimensions to match parent.
            GOCT_IgnoreFinDimens - ignore box/group during layout.

  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        This function may fall back to DimenGadOutlineA() if you have
        changed the screen, window, etc of the GadOutline.

        If there is no window attached to the GadOutline, no layout and
        gadget creation will be performed.

        Groups currently ignore any TypedSize VAR commands; never use them,
        as a meaning may be attached to them in the future.

        The order that commands are sent CHM_CREATEOBJ messages is not
        defined and may change.  If you want to ensure a particular order,
        supply TagLinks pointing to a dummy tag in the command that you
        would like created before the current one.  This will force the
        library to create the object being pointed to before it creates
        the current one.

        This function depends on the minimum dimensioning information
        computed by DimenGadOutlineA() to be correct and up-to-date.  If
        you have made any changes to the outline that has made it need
        more room and don't call DimenGadOutlineA(), this function will
        probably create a layout that is larger than the current maximum
        dimensions.

  BUGS
        The algorithm for creating objects in the correct order is not
        very efficient, and may slow down severly if you have many
        commands linked to others that occur before them in the outline.

  NAME
        ResizeGadOutlineA -- Perform only a resize of a GadOutline.


  SYNOPSIS
        ResizeGadOutlineA(GadOutline, TagList)
                          A0          A1       

        void ResizeGadOutlineA(struct GadOutline *, struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        This routine performs a simple resize of a layout which has ONLY
        changed in size.  This is intended to support BOOPSI gadgets that
        are able to resize themselves without being completely destroyed
        and recreated, but currently always does a full
        RebuildGadOutlineA(). You should only call this function to update
        the layout after a window resize; use RebuildGadOutlineA() to
        update after changing any object attributes (such as the depth of
        a palette gadget) or command tags such as GOCT_IgnoreCreation and
        GOCT_IgnoreFinDimens.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Previously allocated GadOutline.
        TagList - (struct TagItem *) Global (GOA_*) outline tags, parsed
                  before the actual resize is performed.

  RESULT
        Nothing returned from the function.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if an error occured.

  TAGS
        

  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        You should never need to call this unless you turn off automatic
        resizing using { GOA_AutoResize, FALSE }.

  BUGS
        Currently always calls RebuildGadOutlineA().

  FUNCTION
        .

        These are the operations implemented by the library's built-in hook:

        CHM_TRANSCMDHOOK:
        CHM_TRANSEDITHOOK:
        CHM_TRANSTEXTPTR:
        CHM_TRANSTEXTARRAY:
        CHM_TRANSTEXTFMT:
        CHM_TRANSPUBCLASS:
        CHM_TRANSPRIVCLASS:
            Just returns the given code.
        CHM_TRANSTEXTARRAY:
            Allocates memory to hold an array of the same size as
            the one pointed to by the given code, and sends CHM_TRANSTEXTPTR
            for each entry in the array.
        CHM_TRANSHOTKEY:
            Returns the hotkey code, parsing HOTKEY_NOTRANS, HOTKEY_UPONLY
            and HOTKEY_LOWONLY flags.

        All others return the given code.

  INPUTS
        Hook    - (struct Hook *) Your hook.
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) GadOutline asking for translation.
        Message - (struct CmdHookMsg *) The translation to perform.

  RESULT
        Return - (static ULONG) The translated code.

  NAME
        UnhookGadOutlineA -- Detach gadgets from a window.


  SYNOPSIS
        UnhookGadOutlineA(GadOutline, TagList)
                          A0          A1       

        void UnhookGadOutlineA(struct GadOutline *, struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        Calls UpdateGadOutlineA() with the given tag list and then
        detaches the go_GToolsList and go_BoopsiList gadgets from the
        window. If the commands were previously sent CHM_HOOKOBJ by
        HookGadOutlineA(), they will ALL be sent a CHM_UNHOOKOBJ, even if
        an error had occured before being sent the hook message.  (In
        other words, a user hook must be able to handle receiving
        CHM_UNHOOKOBJ messages without an associated CHM_HOOKOBJ.)

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Previously allocated GadOutline.
        TagList - (struct TagItem *) Global (GOA_*) outline tags, parsed
                  before the gadgets are actually detached.

  RESULT
        Nothing returned from the function.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if an error occured.
        (If an empty tag list is passed, an error should never be returned.)

  TAGS
        

  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        The operational order is: Send CHM_UNHOOKOBJ messages, remove
        GadTools and BOOPSI lists.

  BUGS
        Sending CHM_SETOBJATTR messages, either directly through
        GO_SetObjAttrsA(), or indirectly by sending CHM_HOTKEY, etc.
        messages which cause a change in state, while a GadOutline is in
        an unhooked state, but with its objects still created, is not really
        supported and may cause a crash.

  NAME
        UpdateGadOutlineA -- Modify GadOutline from supplied tag list.


  SYNOPSIS
        UpdateGadOutlineA(GadOutline, TagList)
                          A0          A1       

        void UpdateGadOutlineA(struct GadOutline *, struct TagItem *)

  FUNCTION
        This is the interface for changing a GadOutline's global state
        using the GOA_* tag commands.  It is called by AllocGadOutlineA(),
        DimenGadOutlineA(), RebuildGadOutlineA(), ResizeGadOutlineA(),
        HookGadOutlineA(), DrawGadOutlineA(), UnhookGadOutlineA() and
        DestroyGadOutlineA() to process the tag list passed to them.  This
        routine provides a way for you to change the outline's global
        state without directly performing any other action.  However, note
        that many of the global tags will cause either an immediate action,
        or delayed action that will occur the next time one of the above
        functions is called.

        See <libraries/gadoutline.h> for more detailed information on the
        global tags.

  INPUTS
        GadOutline - (struct GadOutline *) Previously allocated GadOutline.
        TagList - (struct TagItem *) Global (GOA_*) outline tags to parse.

  RESULT
        Nothing returned from the function.
        go_LastReqReturn is non-zero if an error occured.

  TAGS
        GOA_BaseName - assign a program basename to the outline.  This string
            is currently only used as the title in the error requester.
        GOA_ErrorCode - provide location of a ULONG to put error codes in.
        GOA_ErrorText - provide location of a UBYTE * to put error text in.
        GOA_SetUserData - put value in ti_Data into go_UserData.
        GOA_SetUserHandler - put value in ti_Data into go_UserHandler.
        GOA_SetTransHook - ti_Data points to a standard Hook structure which
            will be called to perform code translations.
        GOA_SetTransHookData - put value in ti_Data into go_TransHookData.

        These tags will cause the next call to RebuildGadOutlineA() or
        ResizeGadOutlineA() to fall back to DimenGadOutlineA().  If
        a window a screen is currently attached to the GadOutline, they
        will immediately be closed if these tags specify a different
        screen/window.
        GOA_DisplayID and GOA_Overscan - provide a display mode and the
            desired overscan size to fit the layout in.
        GOA_ScreenAddr - specify the address of a screen to attach to the
            GadOutline and fit the layout to.  This screen must remain valid
            while it is attached to the GadOutline.
        GOA_ScreenName - specify the name of a public screen to attach to the
            GadOutline and fit the layout to.  This screen will automatically
            be locked by the library while it is attached to the GadOutline.
        GOA_ScreenFallBack - if TRUE, try opening the public screen if the
            given screen name does not exist.
        GOA_WindowAddr - specify the address of a window to attach to the
            GadOutline.  While a window is attached, DimenGadOutlineA(),
            RebuildGadOutline() and ResizeGadOutline() will result in the
            full creation of the gadgets and attach them to the window.
        GOA_MinWidth, GOA_MinHeight, GOA_MaxWidth, GOA_MaxHeight - override
            the default layout dimensions.  The dimensions are always reset
            reset to the current screen/window if these tags are not
            supplied, regardless of whether or not they were previously set.

        Font tags.  These will not take affect until DimenGadOutlineA() is
        called.  Zero or NULL for any of these tags means "don't care."
        GOA_TextAttr - completely specify desired font.
        GOA_FontName - specify name of font.  The ".font" suffix is optional.
        GOA_FontSize - specify size of font.
        GOA_FontStyle - specify style of font, ie FSF_Bold.

        Font fitting control.  Don't take affect until DimenGadOutlineA().
        GOA_FontMinSize - set the minimum point size the library will try
            to scale the requested font down to before falling back to
            the system fonts.
        GOA_FontSystemOnly - if true, the library will never try smaller font
            point sizes before using the system fonts.
        GOA_FontROMFont - set FPF_ROMFONT flag when opening fonts.
        GOA_FontDiskFont - set FPF_ROMFONT flag when opening fonts and use
            OpenDiskFont() instead of OpenFont().
        GOA_FontDesigned - set FPF_DESIGNED flag when opening fonts.

        GO_OpenWindow() tags - window menu strip and size control.  These only
        affect the operation of GO_OpenWindow().
        GOA_AllocMenus - supply a GadTools NewMenu array to allocate and
            attach to the window.
        GOA_GToolsMenus - supply a menu strip that was previously allocated
            by GadTools; it will be automatically layed out.
        GOA_StandardMenus - supply a standard Intuition menu strip to be
            attached to the window.  It will not be touched in any way.
        GOA_SaveWinDimens - if TRUE, the window's dimensions will be
            remembered between closing and reopening it.
        GOA_WindowRelative - if TRUE, the position and size information given
            in the window tags is interpreted relative to the screen and
            layout position and size.

        IDCMP control.
        GOA_UserIDCMP - set a custom MsgPort.  If NULL, the window's UserPort
            will be used; if ~0, the library will immediately allocate its
            own message port.  NEVER specify this flag while a window is
            attached to the outline.
        GOA_AutoSizeVerify - if TRUE, automatically call UnhookGadOutlineA()
            when an IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY message is received.
        GOA_AutoNewSize - if TRUE, automatically call ResizeGadOutlineA()
            when the window's size changes.
        GOA_AddOutlineIDCMP - if TRUE, the window will be set to report all
            IDCMP events needed by the library.
        GOA_AddObjectIDCMP - if TRUE, the window will be set to report all
            IDCMP events needed by the objects within the GadOutline.
        GOA_AutoHotKeys - if TRUE, IDCMP_RAWKEY and IDCMP_VANILLAKEY will
            be redirected to any command attached to them.

        GOA_RedrawWinFrame - if TRUE, the library will automatically refresh
            the window's frame after it has been resized.
        GOA_SetWindowFont - if TRUE, the window's RastPort font will be set
            to the font being used in the layout.
        GOA_ClearFullWin - if TRUE, the entire area inside of the window's
            borders will be cleared during a resize.
        GOA_DoHookCallback - if TRUE, CHM_HOOKOBJ and CHM_UNHOOKOBJ messages
            will be sent when the gadgets are hooked and unhooked from the
            window.
        GOA_WindowResize - allow library to resize window to make layout
            fit.  NOT IMPLEMENTED.

        GOA_ErrorReportLevel - specify which error types will be reported.
        GOA_ErrorFailLevel - specify which unreported types will be failures.
        GOA_OutlineSize - provide the size of the static outline array, for
            bounds checking.  This tag is only useful when directly passed
            to AllocGadOutlineA().

  EXAMPLE
        

  NOTES
        .

  BUGS
        GOA_WindowResize is not implemented.
        Using GOA_UserIDCMP while a window is attached can crash.
