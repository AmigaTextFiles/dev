    NAME
        Class:          ScreenModeClass
        Superclass:
        Include File    "ScreenModeClass.h"

    FUNCTION

        To provide you with a very easy  way  to  implement  some  ScreenMode
        requester  in  your programs.
        The advantage of this  class  it  that  the  objects  remember  their
        complete setting as long as the object remains valid.

        This class provide too, some new feature to the screenmode requester like:

            - Can layout position of the info-window.
              For haven't it over the screen mode requester :-(.

            - Repair asl-bug (ASLSM_MinWidth & ASLSM_MinHeight) with the new-tag
              SMC_ControlMinSize.

            - New tag SMC_GUI_MODES who display screenmode who support GUI (no LORES..).

            - Easy installation ( great when we believe how work asl-screenmode requester ).


        Also you program must open the following libraries:

        asl.library         - V37 or better.
        intuition.library   - V37 or better.
        utility.library     - V37 or better.

        The source of this class is based on some  sources  of  Jan  Van  Den
        Baard, the creator of the famous library: the bgui.library !!!!!

    NAME
        SMC_InitialInfoPos -- (ULONG)

    FUNCTION
        Open the info window on the left or on the right of the  screen  mode
        requester. ( SMC_INFOPOS_TopLeft, SMC_INFOPOS_TopRight ).

    FUNCTION

        Allow  to  open  the  info  window  always  around  the  screen  mode

        ( Only for  the  first  request  or  after  each  request,  save  the
        screen-mode-requester  positition,  dispose  and  redo  a  newobject.
        Because I use ASL-TAG who work only at initialisation ).

    NAME
        SMC_ReqTopEdge      --  (ULONG)

    FUNCTION
        For get the top edge position of the requester.
