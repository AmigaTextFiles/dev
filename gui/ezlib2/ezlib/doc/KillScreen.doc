FUNCTION  KillScreen()  -  (safely) Close a previously opened screen

   KillScreen(screen)
     struct Screen *screen;

    This function will close the screen you pass it.  If the screen has a
depth of greater than 2 (depth > 2) the bitmap data will be freed also.  If
you have changed the screen->ExtData field from what it originally was
just after you called makescreen(), you should put it back to the
original value BEFORE you make this call.  (The ExtData field points to
the BitMap structure that was allocated when creating the screen - and
note: this is not the same BitMap structure that is in your Screen struct).

    If there are any windows left on the screen, this function will wait
for them to go away before closing.  Note that KillScreen() will keep
waiting forever until the windows are gone, so make sure that any windows
without close gadgets/menus on them are closed before you call this.  Else
you will be in an infinite loop.  The point here is that if you have a
borderless backdrop window on a screen, and you call KillScreen() - you are
screwed, glued, and tatooed unless someone else closes that window for you.
