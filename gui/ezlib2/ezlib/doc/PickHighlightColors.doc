FUNCTION    PickHighlightColors()  -- pick correct colors for 3D look

		 void PickHighlightColors(screen)
			 struct Screen *screen;

    You should call this function if you open a custom screen and intend to
use EzLib to make string or boolean gadgets on that screen.  This function
sets some internal variables so that buttons have a proper 3D look to them
and look raised from the screen while string gadgets look sunk into the
screen.  Obviously you should call this after you've set your colors for a
custom screen.	If you only open windows on WorkBench, you need not concern
yourself with this function (it's taken care of for you).

    You are not required to call this function, but if you open a custom
screen and set up colors with a different scheme than WorkBench (i.e.
light and dark colors in weird spots) your gadgets may or may not have a
proper 3D relief look.	If possible, it is good to stay with the same color
scheme as the version of WB you are using.  This doesn't mean the same
colors, but that under WB 1.3, the colors are (in order) :

		Blue  White Black Orange

While under 2.0 it is :

		Grey  Black White LightBlue

So if you are under 1.3, you should try to keep colors 1 and 2 as light and
dark respectively.  Under 2.0 it should be reversed, color 1 being dark and
color 2 being light.  EzLib attempts adapt as good as possible (by
calculating color distances from the origin using Red, Green, and Blue as
x,y, and z vectors), but there are still color combos which can look
atrocious regardless of what is done (this is when too many of the colors
are close together).  It is possible to create color schemes which do not
have a 3D appearance, or that normally do, but when a gadget is clicked on,
they do not appear sunk in to the screen.  Keep in mind that the colors are
complemented to achieve the sunk in look.  That means that you should set
up your colors (if possible) so that the complement of a light color will
be dark, and vice-versa.
