MACROS	     this file describes several macros that have been defined
	     in ezlib.h

    The file ezlib.h contains a few macros to 1) in general make life a
little easier, and 2) to facilitate working with ez.lib.

    As mentioned in OpenLibs.doc, there are several numbers defined to
specify which libraries to open in a call to openlibs().  They are:

		    #define GFX 	0x0001
		    #define INTUI	0x0002
		    #define INTUITION	0x0002
		    #define ARP 	0x0004
		    #define DFONT	0x0008
		    #define DISKFONT	0x0008
		    #define TRANSLATOR	0x0010
		    #define ICONBASE	0x0080
		    #define REXX	0x0100

		    #define ALL_LIBS	0xffff

    As you can see, they are readily or'ed together to open several
libraries at once.  Or you can use the define ALL_LIBS to open all the
libraries (probably overkill).  ALL_LIBS is more useful for a cleanup
procedure so that it doesn't have to know about which libraries are opened,
it can just do CloseLibs(ALL_LIBS) and everything that was actually
opened is closed. Not much else to say here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Next there is the MSG() macro taken and modified from an old
Transactor.  This is a simple macro to put out a string onto whatever
output stream may be attatched to your program (i.e. whether from WorkBench
or the CLI).  Use as follows :

	   MSG("Something happened.\n");

    Again, it will simply dump out a string onto your output stream.  Note
that it is NOT the same as a printf() call and does NOT take formatting
arguments as does printf().

----------------------------------------------------------------------


    Following are macros to set the colors on a custom screen.	Several
"colors" have also been defined.  The macro is SetColor() and is called
like this :

	  SetColor(screen, num, color)

Screen is the pointer to your custom screen which you opened earlier with
CreateScreen() or similar.

Num is the number of the color register you wish to set.  The highest color
register which you can set is dependent on the depth of the depth (in
bitplanes) of your screen.  In any case, it will never be more than 32.

Color is the actual color you wish to set.  It is a number between 0 and
4,095.	Essentially, only the first twelve (12) bits matter.  The color
defined by your number is as follows:  The first 4 bits (0-3) are BLUE.
The next 4 bits (4-7) are GREEN, and the next 4 bits (8-11) are RED.  To
define a pure blue color, you would specify (in hex) 0x00f.  A nice purple
would be (again in hex) 0xf0f.  To save you the hassle of figuring out what
color is what, the following colors are defined in ezlib.h :

    BLACK    WHITE    RED    GREEN    BLUE    YELLOW
    PINK     PURPLE   GREY0  GREY1    GREY2   GREY3
    ORANGE   INDIGO   CYAN   GOLD

    For example to set the background color of your screen to GREEN, all
you need do (after having opened a screen) is the following:

			SetColor(screen, 0, GREEN);

 For the curious, SetColor() calls SetRGB4().

----------------------------------------------------------------------


    The are 3 more #defines.  They are :

	Print(rp, string)  -  Call this with a RastPort pointer and a
			      a string.  That string will be printed
			      starting at the current pen location in
			      that RastPort.

     Circle(rp, x, y, rad) -  Draw a circle at x,y with radius rad in the
			      rastport pointed to by rp.

  Line(rp, x1, y1, x2, y2) -  Draw a line from x1,y1 to x2,y2.  Believe it or
			      not, there is no function like this in Gfxlib.
			      You are supposed to Move() then Draw().  This
			      macro takes care of that for you.

    Remember, these are really just #defines, so there is no additional
overhead in calling them (besides what it inherent in the underlying
calls).

----------------------------------------------------------------------


    That about covers the ezlib.h file.  Of course all the EzLib function
prototypes are in ezlib.h.

TODO - can't think of anything

BUGS - in a #define ? (you bet!)  ;-)
