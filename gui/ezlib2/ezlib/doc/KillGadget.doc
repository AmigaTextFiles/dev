FUNCTION  KillGadget()  -  Remove and de-allocate a gadget

       KillGadget(win, gadg)
	 struct Window	*win;
	 struct Gadget	*gadg;

    This function will remove a gadget from your window and de-allocate all
of its resources.  After this call, gadg will be invalid and will no
longer appear in your window.  This call will delete all three types of
gadgets, it figures out what to do based on the type.

    Unfortunately this call is not completely orthogonal to the rest of the
killXXX() functions, as it needs to know the window from whence it came (to
be able to make the gadget go away).

    After this call, the specified gadget should no longer appear in your
window.

TODO : maybe not require the window pointer.  could stuff the value in the
       user data field, but then the user can't use that field.

BUGS : shouldn't be
