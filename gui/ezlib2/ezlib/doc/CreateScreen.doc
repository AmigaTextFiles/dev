FUNCTION  CreateScreen()  -  Easily create a custom screen

  struct Screen *CreateScreen(modes, depth)
		   int modes;
		   int depth;

    This function will create a custom screen of the specified modes and
depth for you.	CreateScreen() will return NULL if something couldn't be
allocated or created.  Check the return value to make sure you have a
valid screen pointer.  Valid modes are defined in graphics/view.h.  The
more common ones are :

	HIRES		-  open a hires (640 pixels across) screen
	LACE		-  make the screen interlace (400 vertical lines)
	EXTRA_HALFBRITE -  specify extra half bright mode (64 colors)
	HAM		-  make a HAM (hold and modify) 4096 color screen.

    If you specify NULL for modes, you will get a standard 320x200 screen.

    Some checking is done to make sure that you don't screw yourself.
If graphics.library and intuition.library aren't opened before you call
this function, they WILL be opened for you.

    If you specify a depth of greater than 2 (depth > 2), the bitmap data
you need will be allocated.  However, the ExtData field of the screen
structure will be used to hold some information needed for later when you
call killscreen().  This is a warning that you should not use the
screen->ExtData field, or if you do, you should save its value and put it
back BEFORE you call killscreen().

    Also be advised that some programs illegally modify the
screen->UserData field of your PRIVATE custom screen.  QMouse was caught
blatantly doing this horrendous crime (at least as far as I could tell).
This is definitely a bug in QMouse, but since I really like QMouse, I
changed Ez.lib to use the screen->ExtData field.  BTW, you wanna talk about
a hard to find bug, try tracking that one down!

    To open a HIRES 3 bitplane screen you would do the following :

      struct Screen *screen;

      screen = CreateScreen(HIRES, 3);
      if (screen == NULL)
	no_screen();

    To open a LORES (320x200) 5 bitplane screen, do this :

      struct Screen *screen;

      screen = CreateScreen(NULL, 5);
      if (screen == NULL)
	no_screen();

    To open a HIRES interlaced screen of 2 bitplanes, do this :

      struct Screen *screen;

      screen = CreateScreen(HIRES | LACE, 2);
      if (screen == NULL)
	no_screen();


TODO  : Maybe more error checking on the modes field.  Everything should be
	covered however.

BUGS  : None
