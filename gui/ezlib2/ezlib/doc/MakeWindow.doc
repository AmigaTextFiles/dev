FUNCTION  MakeWindow()  -  Easily create an Intution window

 struct Window *MakeWindow(screen, leftedge, topedge, width, height)
		  struct Screen *screen;
		  int leftedge, topedge;
		  int width, height;


    This function will open a standard Intuition window for you.  You
specify a screen pointer if you would like this window to appear on a
custom screen or NULL if you would like it to appear on the workbench.	The
leftedge, topedge, width, and height variables specify the new window's
dimensions. They are error checked for sanity.

    The window that is opened has a Close Gadget, TitleBar, Depth Gadget,
and a Sizing Gadget.  The window is also SMART_REFRESH, therefore you
don't have to worry about refreshing your display.  This is a very high
level routine, that doesn't give you much flexibility over the appearance
of the window, but quickly and painlessly gets you a window.

    Since there is a Close Gadget on this window, you will receive
Intuition messages (which you can safely ignore if you want).  However it
is better if you do check to see if the user has clicked the Close Gadget
in that window.  NOTE: the flags which this window is opened with will only
send you a CLOSEWINDOW Intuition Message.  If you wish to receive other
window messages (like DISKINSERTED or something), you should use
ModifyIDCMP() to tell Intuition you want those messages.


    A final note: If graphics.library and intuition.library haven't been
opened yet, this routine will open them for you.


    This example opens a 200x100 window at 0, 0 on the workbench screen:

       struct Window *window;

       window = MakeWindow(NULL, 0,0, 200, 100);
       if (window == NULL)
	 no_window()



TODO : Need more medium level routines for more control over how the window
       looks.  This routine should then call those lower level routines to
       do the real work

BUGS : none that I know of.
