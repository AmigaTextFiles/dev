FUNCTION    RealtimeProp()  -- Let user work with a prop gadget in realtime

	      RealtimeProp(win, gadg, func, data)
		  struct Window *win;
		  struct Gadget *gadd;
		  void (*func)();
		  void *data;


    This function lets a user interactively play with a prop gadget as it
modifies some value in your program.  For example with a color requestor
that lets the user modify the colors, the RGB prop gadgets should modify
the components of the color in real time.  With this function that is
trivial to do.

    The window and gadget arguments simply specify which window and which
prop gadget you would like to monitor.	The func and data arguments are the
name of a function you would like called each time the prop gadget changes
value and data is a pointer to any data you want passed to the function
func. Func is what is known as a callback routine.

    To use RealtimeProp(), all your program must do is wait for a
GADGETDOWN message, determine that it is for a prop gadget you want to
monitor in real time, and then call RealtimeProp().  As soon as you call
RealtimeProp(), event loop control for your window is handled for you.
Whenever the prop gadget changes value, your function, func(), is called
with three arguments.  The three arguments to your function are : the
window pointer, the data pointer you called RealtimeProp() with, and a 32
bit integer which has the new value of the gadget (which is within the
limits set by SetPropGadg()).

    For example to modify the red value of a color, you would have a prop
gadget with a range of 0 to 15 (max = 16).  When you received a GADGETDOWN
message for this gadget, you would call RealtimeProp() like this :

	    RealtimeProp(win, red_prop_gadg, modify_red, colors_ptr);

    Where win is the window all this action takes place in.  Red_prop_gadg
is a pointer to the gadget the user is playing with (assumed to be the red
one here), modify_red is the name of a function you have which modifies the
red content of a particular color and might be defined like this :

	    void modify_red(win, struct color_ptr, new_val)
		    struct Window *win;
		    struct colors *color_ptr;
		    int new_val;

	     {
		 /* your code to do whatever with new_val */
	     }

    Finally colors_ptr is an application specific data structure that
modify_red() will manipulate (most likely by placing the new value it gets
into the structure).  You can pass any type of pointer as a data pointer.

    The only drawback to using RealtimeProp() is that all message handling
is out of your control while the user manipulates the prop gadget.  For the
most part this is not a problem as you won't receive VANILLAKEY, MENUPICK,
RAWKEY or most other types of messages while the user modifies a prop
gadget.  However if you selected to receive DISKINSERTED/REMOVED, NEWPREFS
or INTUITICKS messages, these will arrive and simply be ReplyMsg()'ed to.
This means that should a deft user click and drag on a prop gadget while
simultaneously removing or inserting disks, you won't hear about it.
NEWPREFS are virtually impossible to receive while a user is playing
interactively with a scroll bar, so I imagine this is of little concern.
INTUITICKS messages still arrive, but since the user is already modifiying
a value in realtime this should not pose too great of a problem as your
program receives (although is not guaranteed to) control quite often
whenever the user changes the value of the prop gadget. If this does cause
you problems, you would not be able to use RealtimeProp().


TODO : could be nice to provide callbacks for INTUITICKS and DISKINSERTED
       messages, but that would also greatly complicate matters.

BUGS : nada one, mista.
