FUNCTION    MakeImgToggle()   -  create a toggle gadget w/custom imagery

     struct Gadget *MakeImgToggle(win, l_edge, t_edge, img, hi_img, id)
		      struct Window *win;
		      SHORT l_edge, t_edge;
		      struct Image *img, *hi_img;
		      USHORT id;

    This function is exactly the same as MakeImgGadget() except that the
gadget is a toggle instead of boolean. A toggle gadget means one that when
it is clicked once, it depresses and stays depressed until clicked
again.	This is useful for a play function on a music program (similar to
the play button on a tape player) or anything where you wish to set options
and keep them set until clicked off again.

    For this function, img and hi_img must both point to valid Image
structures.  When the gadget is clicked hi_img is displayed until the
gadget is clicked again.  The gadget's top left corner will be at l_edge,
t_edge.  The return value is a pointer to the created gadget. You should
keep this pointer so that you can later remove the gadget with a call to
KillGadget().

    The created gadget will have the id you specify so that you will be
able to determine from your Intuition messages which gadget was pressed.
You should take care to make sure that you will receive the GADGETUP
messages in your window.  Windows created with MakeWindow() do not receive
these types of messages, however, you can use the Intuition function
ModifyIDCMP() to change this behavior.

    To create a Toggle gadget with an image foo_img (defined elsewhere) and
alternate image bar_img (also defined elsewhere), you would do the
following :

	struct Window *win;		    /* opened beforehand */
	struct Gadget *blah_gadg;
	struct Image  *foo_img, *bar_img;   /* defined elsewhere */


	blah_gadg = MakeImgToggle(win, 100, 25, foo_img, bar_img, 43);

	/* do whatever we want (i.e. main loop, etc...)  */

	/* free up gadget resources (i.e. memory) */
	KillGadget(win, blah_gadg);

    The previous code will create and cause to be displayed a boolean
gadget with custom imagery at 100, 25 which has the image foo_img,
alternate image of bar_img, and a gadget ID of 43.  MakeImgToggle() takes
care of displaying the gadget in your window, so you need not do anything
extra. You should however keep track of created gadgets so that you can
properly free their allocated memory.

    For the curious, this function calls the lower level function
CreateImgGadget() with appropriate values.  It then calls AddGList() and
RefreshGList() to cause the gadget to display.  The only difference between
this and MakeImgGadget() is that this function adds a TOGGLESELECT bit to
the activation argument of CreateImgGadget().


TODO :

BUGS : "Seymour, Seymour, there's a bug in the code!"
       "Don't worry honey, I've got it."
