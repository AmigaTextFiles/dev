FUNCTION   GetBitMap()  -  allocate and initialize an arbitrary bitmap

	 struct BitMap *GetBitMap(depth, width, height)
	    int depth, width, height;

    This function will return a pointer to a bitmap of your specified
depth, width, and height.   It will return NULL if any of the memory
allocations fail (of course taking care to free any memory it has already
allocated).

    Note that the depth variable has a maximum value of 8.  If you ask for
more, the call will fail immediately.  Width and height are limited to
32,768.

    In this example, we will allocate a 3 bitplane bitmap of 100x75 pixels.
This could be very useful for calls to BltBitMap() :

      struct BitMap *bm;

      bm = GetBitMap(3, 100, 75);
      if (bm == NULL)
	no_bitmap();

      /* continue doing stuff ... */

      /* free up all that allocated memory */
      FreeBitMap(bm, 100, 75);

    This call is basically useful for allocating backup storage for making
calls to BltBitMap() (or its cousins).  Just remember to check the error
return, and other than that you get a fully initialized and allocated
bitmap structure to your specs! ;^)

TODO : can't think of much else....

BUGS : what's up doc?

ELMER FUDD : come here you wascally wabbit!
