FUNCTION    MakeBoolGadget()   -  create an autosizing boolean gadget

     struct Gadget *MakeBoolGadget(win, l_edge, t_edge, text, id)
		      struct Window *win;
		      SHORT l_edge, t_edge;
		      UBYTE *text;
		      USHORT id;

    This function will create a boolean gadget in your window.	The gadget
will have your specified text, and id.	The size is calculated
automatically to nicely fit the given text (although there is a minimum
size of 30 pixels).  The return value is a pointer to the created gadget.
You should keep this pointer so that you can later remove the gadget with a
call to KillGadget().

    The gadget returned is dynamically allocated, so take care to call
KillGadget() when you are done with the gadget.  Note that you should call
KillGadget() before you call KillWindow().

    The created gadget will have the id you specify so that you will be
able to determine from your Intuition messages which gadget was pressed.
You should take care to make sure that you will receive the GADGETUP
messages in your window.  Windows created with MakeWindow() do not receive
these types of messages, however, you can use the Intuition function
ModifyIDCMP() to change this behavior.

    The gadgets created by this call are simple box affairs with the
highlight mode set to COMPLEMENT.  The text is centered and should be
offset nicely.	The gadgets are not crowded or otherwise unsightly, and
have a nice raised button appearance.

    To create a boolean gadget with the text "Click Me", you would do the
following (assuming an already opened window) :

	struct Window *win;		/* opened beforehand */
	struct Gadget *click_me;

	click_me = MakeBoolGadget(win, 100, 25, "Click Me", 43);

	/* do whatever we want (i.e. main loop, etc...)  */

	/* free up gadget resources (i.e. memory) */
	KillGadget(win, click_me);

    The previous code will create and cause to be displayed an autosized
boolean gadget at 100, 25 which contains the text "Click Me", and has a
gadget ID of 43.  MakeBoolGadget()  WILL  take care of making sure the
gadget is displayed, so you need not do anything after the return from the
function.  You should however keep track of the allocated gadgets so that
you can properly free their allocated memory.

    For the curious, this function calls the lower level function
CreateBoolGadget() with appropriate values.  It then calls AddGList() and
RefreshGList() to cause the gadget to display.

BUGS : could be, but none that I've seen (fingers crossed)
