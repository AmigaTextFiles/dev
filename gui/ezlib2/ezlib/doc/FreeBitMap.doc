FUNCTION  FreeBitMap()  -  Free up a previously allocated bitmap struct

       FreeBitMap(bm, width, height)
	  struct BitMap *bm;
	  int width, height;

    This function will simply free up all the resources taken by the given
bitmap.  The BitMap structure itself is freed, and should no longer be used
after this function.

   Just make sure to call this function on a previously allocated bitmap,
and not something like your custom screen bitmap.  Preferably you would
have used something like GetBitMap() to allocate the bitmap you wish to
free.

TODO : maybe get rid of the width,height arguments?  could calculate it
       internally, but I might be off

BUGS : roaches, ants, gnats, etc...
