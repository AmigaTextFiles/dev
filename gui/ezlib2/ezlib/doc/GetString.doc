FUNCTION  GetString()  -  Get a string from the user, using a window

  char *GetString(window, title, def_string)
	  struct Window *window;
	  char *title;
	  char *def_string;

    This function will pop open a window to prompt the user for a string.
The window has o.k. and cancel gadgets, and in addition, a Close gadget.
The string you wish to get should be less than 256 characters (the default
buffer size).

    The window argument is a pointer to a window which tells GetString
which screen to open its window on.  If the Window argument is NULL,
the GetString window will appear on the Workbench screen.  The title
argument will be the title of the new window.  The def_string argument is a
pointer to the default string that will appear in the string gadget.

    This function will return NULL if the user clicks the Close Gadget or
cancel gadget.	If they click the "OK" gadget or press return in the string
gadget, you will get a pointer to a string back.  The string is dynamically
allocated and you must free it when you are done with it by a call to
FreeMem() (see below).

     You should be aware that if the users presses return inside an empty
string gadget, you will get a string of length 0 back (i.e. just a pointer
to a NULL byte).

     Here is an example that gets back the users name and prints it in the
     CLI window.  In this example, the window will appear on workbench,
     have a window title "Please enter your name", and there will be no
     default string.

     char *string;

     string = GetString(NULL, "Please enter your name", NULL);

     if (string == NULL)
       printf("User does not have a name.\n");
     else {
       printf("Your name is %s.\n", string);

       /* for this example we are done with the string, so we will free
	* it now.
	*		!!!!!! **  NOTICE  ** !!!!!!
	*   You should be very careful to make sure that you free the
	* proper amount of memory using the following style call.
	* The size you MUST free is the length of the string + 1.
	* This is VERY IMPORTANT as otherwise you mess up memory.
	*/
       FreeMem(string, strlen(string)+1);
     }				    ^^^^ The +1 is _very_ important!


    Again, if you want this window to appear on a custom screen (opened by
a call to CreateScreen() or similar) you should pass it the screen pointer
instead of NULL as the first argument.

    You should also check to make sure you didn't get back an empty string.

BUGS : No sir, there are none to the best of my knowledge.
