FUNCTION    MakeIntGadget()   -  create a numeric string gadget and
				 display it

     struct Gadget *MakeIntGadget(win, l_edge, t_edge, len, def_str, id)
			struct Window *win;
			SHORT  l_edge, t_edge;
			USHORT len;
			UBYTE *def_str;
			USHORT id;

    This function will create a numeric string gadget in your window.  The
string gadget will be exactly len pixels long.	The height is font
dependent. If you specify a non-NULL def_str, it is placed in the string
gadget as a default number.  The return value is a pointer to the created
gadget. You should keep this pointer so that you can later remove the
gadget with a call to KillGadget().

    This function is almost exactly the same as MakeStringGadget() except
that the gadget only accepts numeric input.

    The gadget returned is dynamically allocated, so take care to call
KillGadget() when you are done with the gadget.  Note that you should call
KillGadget() before you call KillWindow().

    The created gadget will have the id you specify so that you will be
able to determine from your Intuition messages which gadget was pressed.
You should take care to make sure that you will receive GADGETUP messages
in your window.  Windows created with MakeWindow() do not receive these
types of messages as a default, however, you can use the Intuition function
ModifyIDCMP() to change this behavior.

    If you would like the user to be able to immediately type into the
numeric string gadget when the window is ready, you must make sure you
receive ACTIVEWINDOW messages in your window (you can use ModifyIDCMP() if
you have to).  When you receive an ACTIVEWINDOW message, call
ActivateGadget() with a pointer to this gadget.  That is the correct method
of making sure a string gadget is ready to accept input.

    The gadgets created by this call look sunk into the screen.  The
outline is calculated to fit nicely around the text area.

    To create a numeric string gadget with default number "666", you would
do the following (assuming an already opened window) :

	struct Window *win;		/* opened beforehand */
	struct Gadget *num_gadg

	num_gadg = MakeIntGadget(win, 100, 25, 150, "666", 43);

	/* do whatever we want (i.e. main loop, etc...)  */

	/* free up gadget resources (i.e. memory) */
	KillGadget(win, num_gadg);

    The previous code will create and cause to be displayed a numeric
gadget at 100, 25 with a length of 150 pixels, with the default numeric
string "666", and a gadget ID of 43. MakeIntGadget() takes care of making
sure the gadget is displayed in your window, so you need not do anything
after the return from the function. You should however keep track of the
allocated gadgets so that you can properly free their allocated memory.

    For the curious, this function calls the lower level function
CreateStringGadget() with appropriate values.  It then calls AddGList() and
RefreshGList() to cause the gadget to display.
