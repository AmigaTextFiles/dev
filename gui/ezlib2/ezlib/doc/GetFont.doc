FUNCTION   GetFont()   - open a disk font for use.

   struct TextFont *GetFont(name size)
		      char *name;
		      int size;

    GetFont() gives you easy access to the disk based fonts of the Amiga.
All you have to do is pass the name (a character string) of the font and
the size you would like.  If opening the font succeeds, you will be able to
immediately SetFont(rp, text_font) in your current window and use it from
then on (with the Text() function).  This function returns NULL if anything
fails.

    The name you pass to GetFont() can have a ".font" extension or not.  If
it doesn't, then it will be appended.  Also be aware that if you specify a
full pathname for name, that font need NOT be in the current FONTS:
directory.  This is a little known but true fact.

    Size should simply be the point size of the font you want.	For example
if you want Times 17, you would use size == 17.

    To open a font called "helvetica" in a 23 point size you would do this:

	struct Window *wind;	/* assume we opened it earlier */
	struct TextFont *tf;

	/* open the font and error check the result */
	tf = GetFont("helvetica", 23);
	if (tf == NULL)
	  no_font();

	SetFont(wind->RPort, tf);    /* from now on we can use the font */

	  .....      /* do other stuff */

	CloseFont(tf);           /* do this BEFORE calling killwindow() */


NOTE : You should always call CloseFont().  This will prevent fonts from
       being kept in memory unnecessarily.  It is best if you can call
       CloseFont() as soon as you are done with the font. This prevents
       wasting memory.


    Essentially, there are 3 steps to using a disk font.  Open the font
with GetFont().  Then call SetFont() for the window/screen you wish to use
the font on.  Then use the graphics library text routines for whatever you
want.  Finally call CloseFont() when you are done.  Nice and easy.



TODO : should probably be some sort of resource tracking so that you don't
       have to call CloseFont().

       would be nice if there was a single call you could make to open and
       set the font for a window (and then not have to worry about after
       that because of the item above), but that would get complicated if
       you wanted to use multiple fonts.
