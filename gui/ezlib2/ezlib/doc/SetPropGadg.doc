FUNCTION     SetPropGadg()   -- Set user specified limits on a proportional
				gadget

		 void SetPropGadg(win, gadg, top, displayed, max)
			 struct Window *win;
			 struct Gadget *gadg;
			 int top, displayed, max;


    This function allows you to specify what a prop gadget represents.

    Before we go any further, here are some definitions so that we
are all talking about the same things.

     Knob - The rectangle area of a prop gadget that you click on with
	    your mouse and move around.  The larger the value of Displayed,
	    the larger (visually) the Knob is.

     Top - This value represents where the top edge of the Knob is located.
	   For example 0 represents the knob at the top of the prop gadget
	   container. Top should always be less than or equal to (Max -
	   Displayed).

     Displayed - This represents the size of the Knob relative to the total
		 value the prop gadget represents.  For instance, a
		 Displayed value of 5 and a Max value of 15 means that the
		 Knob fills 1/3 of the entire prop gadget.

      Max - This value represents the range of the entire prop gadget.
	    That is, Max is the maximum value a prop gadget can have. If you
	    have a max value of 100, you will get numbers in the range
	    0 to 99.


    For instance, if you have a text editor with a 100 line file, 17 lines
per window-ful and the current line at the top of the window is 63, you
would call SetPropGadg() as follows :

	     SetPropGadg(win, gadg, 63, 17, 100);

And the gadget would adjust as appropriate.

    The max argument specifies how much the whole gadget represents.  If
you have 32 items to scroll through, max equals 32.  If you have 5,000
items, then max equals 5,000.  The displayed argument represents how much
is displayed at a time.  For a text editor with a window which holds 25
lines of text, displayed would be 25.  For a RGB or volume slider where you
move one value at a time, displayed would be 1.  The top argument specifies
where you would like to place the knob of the prop gadget (the knob being
the rectangle that you drag around in the gadget) relative to the max
argument. If you have a max argument of 500, and give a top argument of
250, the knob will begin in the middle of the prop gadget.  If you have a
max argument of 16 and give a top argument of 0, the knob will be at the
top of the prop gadget.

    You can call SetPropGadg() with new values as often as needed.  Each
time you call it, the gadget is updated and visually reflects the
changes you requested.

    The max argument that you specify will limit the largest number you
will get back from GetPropValue().  If you specify a max of 20, you will
get numbers in the range 0 to 19.  Similarly if you specify a max of 64,
you get numbers of 0 to 63.


TODO : provide support for overlap?  but overlap can add confusion when not
       needed.

BUGS : with a violent SWAT he ended the life of the poor fly which bothered
       him incessantly for the two hours he had sat at his computer.
