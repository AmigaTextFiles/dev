FUNCTION  KillWindow()  -  (safely) Close a previoulsy opened window

    KillWindow(window)
      struct Window *window;

    This function will close the window you pass it.  If you have menus
attatched to the window, they will be cleared before the window closes.
However if you have already cleared the menus yourself (with
ClearMenuStrip() ), then you must NULL out the window->MenuStrip field
before you call KillWindow().

    There are no return values from this function.

    It is safe to pass a NULL pointer to this function (it checks for
that).	This function will also reply to any existing messages that are at
your window->UserPort (making it safe to call anytime).

TODO : Not really much else I can do.  Might possibly want to do some sort
       of resource tracking using the UserData field (for gadgets etc).

BUGS : you kidding? ;-)
