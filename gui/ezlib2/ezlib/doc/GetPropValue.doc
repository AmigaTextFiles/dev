FUNCTION   GetPropValue()   -- Get the value of a Proportional gadget

	      int GetPropValue(gadg)
		     struct Gadget *gadg;

    This function returns the integer value that your prop gadget currently
represents.

    Before we go any further, here are some definitions so that we
are all talking about the same things.

     Knob - The rectangle area of a prop gadget that you click on with
	    your mouse and move around.  The larger the value of Displayed,
	    the larger (visually) the Knob is.

     Top - This is the value you get back from this function.  It
	   represents where the top edge of the Knob is located. For
	   example 0 represents the knob at the top of the prop gadget
	   container. Top should always be less than or equal to (Max -
	   Displayed).

     Displayed - This represents the size of the Knob relative to the total
		 value the prop gadget represents.  For instance, a
		 Displayed value of 5 and a Max value of 15 means that the
		 Knob fills 1/3 of the entire prop gadget.

      Max - This value represents the range of the entire prop gadget.
	    That is, Max is the maximum value a prop gadget can have. If
	    you have a Max value of 100, you will get numbers in the range
	    0 to 99.


    It is worthwhile to note that if the size of `knob' of the prop gadget
represents more than 1 (done by setting Displayed in SetPropGadg()), then
the value this function returns will be Max - Displayed - 1. So if you call
SetPropGadg() with values of Displayed and Max of 15 and 60 respectively,
GetPropValue() will always return numbers in the range 0 to (60 - 15 - 1),
or 44.	This is becase the value returned represents the top of the knob in
the prop gadget.

    This function is immensely useful when tracking realtime changes to a
prop gadget, and in general for retrieving the new value a prop gadget
represents after a user plays with it.	Here is an example where the prop
gadget has an ID of 20 :

	      struct Window *win;
	      struct Gadget *prop1;    /* assume both opened earlier */
	      struct Gadget *gadg;
	      int val;

	      SetPropGadg(win, prop1, 8, 1, 16);


		 /* intervening code to handle window main loop */

		 /* on receiving a GADGETUP message here's what you do */

		 case GADGETUP : gadg = (struct Gadget *)msg->IAddress;
				 if (gadg->ID == 20)
				  {
				     /* it's the prop gadget */
				     val = GetPropValue(prop1);

				     /* use val as you need to */
				  }
				 break;

    In this case, the prop gadget starts out with a value of 8, and
GetPropValue() will return numbers in the 0 to 15 range (because
Displayed has a value of 1).
