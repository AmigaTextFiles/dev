FUNCTION  CloseLibs()  -  close any previously opened libraries

		 void CloseLibs(int which_ones)

    This function will close a group of libraries previously opened with
OpenLibs(). If you can open it with OpenLibs(), you can close it with this.
The parameters specify which libraries to close down.  There is a special
#define, ALL_LIBS, which will close any and all libraries previously
opened.  The other libraries you can specifically close are :

	      GFX		      : graphics.library
	      INTUI or INTUITION      : intuition.library
	      DFONT or DISKFONT       : diskfont.library
	      ARP		      : arp.library
	      TRANSLATOR	      : translator.library
	      ICONBASE		      : icon.library
	      REXX		      : rexxsyslib.library
	      ALL_LIBS		      : all of the above libraries

    This function, after calling CloseLibrary() for each specified library,
sets the Library base pointer to NULL.

It is worthwhile to note that because EzLib declares the Library bases for
you (such as GfxBase or IntuitionBase), you do not need to declare them at
all in your program.  If you need to reference them, simply declare them as
extern.


TODO : Need to make sure that OpenLibs() doesn't get out of sync
       with CloseLibs().


BUGS : Potentially. If you open libraries by hand which EzLib can open
       with OpenLibs(), then call CloseLibs(), the library you opened by
       hand will be closed (and its pointer set to NULL).  This won't
       happen easily though, as if you declare a library base that EzLib
       already has defined, you will get a Multiply Defined Symbol error at
       link time.
