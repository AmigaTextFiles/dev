FUNCTION  OpenLibs()  -  Easily open any of several system libraries

	  OpenLibs( which_ones )
	    int which_ones;

    This function takes an integer argument which specifies which libraries
you would like to have opened for your program.  The libraries you can open
are:

	      GFX		      : graphics.library
	      INTUI or INTUITION      : intuition.library
	      DFONT or DISKFONT       : diskfont.library
	      ARP		      : arp.library
	      TRANSLATOR	      : translator.library
	      ICONBASE		      : icon.library
	      REXX		      : rexxsyslib.library


These values are simply numeric #define's, which can be or'ed together.


To open the graphics.library, you would simply do the following:

		 success = OpenLibs(GFX);
		 if (success == NULL)
		   deal_with_failure();


You can open multiple libraries with a single call by doing the following:

		success = OpenLibs(GFX | ARP | INTUITION | DISKFONT);
		if (success == NULL)
		  deal_with_failure();

    The above opens the graphics.library, arp.library, intuition.library,
and diskfont.library all in a single call.

    If any of the libraries fail to open, OpenLibs() will print an error
message to your output stream saying which library didn't open and it
will return NULL.

    OpenLibs() will close any libraries it opened if a succesive
OpenLibrary() call fails.  Therefore, you don't have to worry about opened
libraries sitting around and never being closed.  This is to say that if
you ask for GFX | INTUI | ARP, and graphics.library and intuition.library
open, but arp.library doesn't, graphics and intuition will be closed down
for you and NULL returned.

It is worthwhile to note that because EzLib declares the Library bases for
you (such as GfxBase or IntuitionBase), you do not need to declare them at
all in your program.  If you need to reference them, simply declare them as
extern, and reference them as normal.


TODO : Shouldn't be much else.  Maybe a way to add more libraries that
       can be opened without having to recompile.  Possibly a name/variable
       combo....

BUGS :	can only support 32 different libraries to be opened.  That's not
	too much of a restriction, but it still is one.
