FUNCTION    MakeImgGadget()   -  create a boolean gadget w/ Imagery

     struct Gadget *MakeImgGadget(win, l_edge, t_edge, img, hi_img, id)
		      struct Window *win;
		      SHORT l_edge, t_edge;
		      struct Image *img, *hi_img;
		      USHORT id;

    This function will create a boolean gadget that utilizes the custom
imagery you specify, in your window. The gadget will have your specified
text, and id.  The return value is a pointer to the created gadget. You
should keep this pointer so that you can later remove the gadget with a
call to KillGadget().

    The gadget returned is dynamically allocated, so take care to call
KillGadget() when you are done with the gadget.  Note that you should call
KillGadget() before you call KillWindow().

    The created gadget will have the id you specify so that you will be
able to determine from your Intuition messages which gadget was pressed.
You should take care to make sure that you will receive the GADGETUP
messages in your window.  Windows created with MakeWindow() do not receive
these types of messages, however, you can use the Intuition function
ModifyIDCMP() to change this behavior.

    The imagery you specify will begin at l_edge, t_edge. If you specify
hi_img, when the user clicks the gadget, hi_img will display.  If hi_img is
NULL, highlighting will simply be complementing img.

    To create a boolean gadget with the image arrow and the highlight
image press_in_arrow, you would do the following (assuming that arrow
and press_in_arrow are defined elsewhere) :

	struct Window *win;		/* opened beforehand */
	struct Gadget *click_me;
	struct Image  *arrow,	    /* defined elsewhere */
		      *press_in_arrow;

	click_me = MakeImgGadget(win, 100, 25, arrow, press_in_arrow, 43);

	/* do whatever we want (i.e. main loop, etc...)  */

	/* free up gadget resources (i.e. memory) */
	KillGadget(win, click_me);

    The previous code will create and cause to be displayed a boolean
gadget at 100, 25 which has the image arrow, highlight image of
press_in_arrow, and a gadget ID of 43.	MakeImgGadget()  WILL  take care of
making sure the gadget is displayed, so you need not do anything after the
return from the function.  You should however keep track of the allocated
gadgets so that you can properly free their allocated memory.

    For the curious, this function calls the lower level function
CreateImgGadget() with appropriate values.  It then calls AddGList() and
RefreshGList() to cause the gadget to display.
