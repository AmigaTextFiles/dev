FUNCTION    CreatePropGadget()  -  create a Proportional Gadget

struct Gadget *CreatePropGadget(l_edge, t_edge, width, height,
				flags, activation, kind, id)

		  SHORT l_edge, t_edge;
		  SHORT width,	height;
		  USHORT flags, activation, kind;
		  USHORT id


    This function dynamically creates a Proportional Gadget of your said
dimensions, activation, and flags.  The kind variable specifies whether you
would like a FREEVERT (vertically moving) or FREEHORIZ (horizontally
moving) prop gadget.  You cannot specify both (which Intuition allows)
because the rest of the EzLib functions can't deal with two dimensional
prop gadgets. The ID you specify should be unique for your window to avoid
problems with other gadgets (you won't be able to tell which gadget an
IntuiMessage is for!). The flags and activation arguments correspond
exactly to the Flags and Activation fields of a Gadget structure (see the
RKM's for more info on what values they can hold).

    When you wish to remove the gadget from your window, call
KillGadget(win, gadget), which will remove it from your window and
deallocate all the resources.

    There really isn't much to this function.  It allocates and fills in
all the necessary structures, and prepares them for being added to a window
(which the `Make' level of calls do for you).  If you wish to use or
retrieve values from a prop gadget (your numbers, not Intuition's), use the
functions SetPropGadg() and GetPropValue().  SetPropGadg() and
GetPropValue() work with number ranges you specify, so your application can
use the numbers it already is working with.

    Here is an example of creating a vertical prop gadget and adding it to
a window.  The gadget will start at 50,50 and be 20 pixels wide by 100
pixels tall.  The GADGHNONE argument informs Intuition to do its default
highlighting (complement).  The activation flags inform Intuition to make
sure the mouse button is let go over the gadget (RELVERIFY), to let our
program know with a GADGETDOWN message as soon as the user clicks the
gadget (GADGIMMEDIATE), and to send us mouse reports with the FOLLOWMOUSE
flag. The last two flags effectively give us the ability to do realtime
prop gadgets (those that change some value interactively as we move the
gadget). If you don't want realtime prop gadgets, nothing is harmed (you
won't receive MOUSEMOVE messages for a window unless you request them).


     struct Window *win;      /* assume it was opened earlier */
     struct Gadget *gadg;
     USHORT activation = RELVERIFY | GADGIMMEDIATE | FOLLOWMOUSE;

     gadg = CreatePropGadget(50,50, 20,100, GADGHNONE,
			     activation, FREEVERT, 10);
     if (gadg == NULL)
       ackk_no_gadget();

     AddGadget(gadg, win, NULL)
     RefreshGList(gadg, win, NULL, 1);

     /* down here you should probably set some limits with SetPropGadg() */

BUGS : Oh that's just a devil bug, it won't hurt you.  It's a bug, get it
       out of my code.	Oh it's just a devil bug, it won't hurt you. It's a
       bug, and it's crashing my machine, GET IT OUT!  (the above is
       funnier if you say the devil bug lines with an unconcerned southern
       drawl and the other lines with an uptight eastern voice. Anyone
       remember the comedian that did the original version of that?)
