FUNCTION   GetYN()  -  get a yes or no answer using a requestor

      GetYN(window, string)
	struct Window *window;
	char *string;

    This function will get a simple yes or no answer from a user.  You pass
GetYN() a string which is put into an AutoRequest().  If the user clicks
o.k., TRUE is returned, otherwise FALSE.  This function is useful in many
situations to just let the user know what is going on, and of course for
yes/no questions.

    If you pass GetYN() a NULL window pointer, it will return NULL to you.
If for any reason the AutoRequest() can not be made, this function will
also return NULL.  Therefore you should keep this in mind when you use
GetYN().  Also note that if there isn't enough memory for a full
AutoRequest() (similar to the Insert Volume xxx requestors), the GetYN()
function will degenerate into a display alert (a recoverable guru box!).
This can be scary for novice users, but only happens in *very* low memory
conditions.

    The string you pass GetYN() should fit horizontally on one line across
the display.  If not, the AutoRequest() will not open and you will get
NULL back.

    Here is an example of using GetYN() to find out if the user is really a
weenie:

       struct Window *wind;    /* assume it was opened earlier */
       int value;

       value = GetYN(wind, " Are you a weenie? ");
       if (value == TRUE)
	 user_is_a_weenie();
       else
	 user_is_cool();


    Likewise, if you would just like to inform the user that something has
happened or is about to happen, you can do the following:

    struct Window *wind;     /* again, assume it was opened earlier */

    /* doing some processing and something occurs */

    GetYN(wind, " Did you know that XXX just happened? ");

    /* keep going .... */



TODO : would be nice if you could do multi-line requestors using some
       sort of embedded character to signify a line break.

BUGS : None at time of publication.
