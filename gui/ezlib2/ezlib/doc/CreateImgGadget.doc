FUNCTION   CreateImgGadget()  -  create a fully spec'ed Boolean gadget

struct Gadget *CreateImgGadget(l_edge, t_edge, flags, activation,
			       img, hi_img, id)
		 SHORT l_edge, t_edge;
		 USHORT flags, activation;
		 struct Image *img, *hi_img;
		 USHORT id;

    This function gives you total control for creating boolean gadgets with
hand drawn Images.  All you need is at least one Image structure (in CHIP
memory) and a boolean gadget will be created for you that utilizes your
imagery.  You specify exactly the flags and activation types of the gadget
and where the top corner should be, and the rest is taken care of. The
flags and activation arguments correspond to the Flags and Activation
fields of a struct Gadget.  The image you specify has its top left
corner at the point l_edge, t_edge.  The gadget has the ID you give.

    Boolean gadgets created with CreateImgGadget() use the img argument as
the standard imagery.  If you specify hi_img, that image will be used for
highlighting (when the user clicks on the gadget).  If you specify a NULL
hi_img, the gadget will use GADGHCOMP (complementing) as the method of
highlighting.

    You can specify any types of flags you would like, however not much
error checking is done on these values.  Be careful for silly combinations.
Finally, you should make sure that your window is listening for Gadget
messages (either gadget UP or gadget DOWN).

    This function will NOT add the gadget to your window.  This is
something you must do afterwards (with AddGadget()) else you will never see
your gadget.  The only thing this function does is to allocate space and
return a pointer to the properly filled out structure.

    The following example will create an image based boolean gadget at
100,25.  Assume the image structure is already defined elsewhere. The
gadget will have an id of 42.

       struct Window *win;	    /* assume opened earlier */
       struct Gadget *gadg;
       struct Image  *img_data;     /* defined elsewhere     */


       gadg = CreateImgGadget(100,25, GADGHCOMP, RELVERIFY,
			       img_data, NULL, 42);
       if (gadg == NULL)
	 error_no_gadg();

       /* add it to the window and make it appear */
       AddGadget(gadg, win, NULL);
       RefreshGList(gadg, win, NULL, 1);
