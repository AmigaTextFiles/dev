FUNCTION   CreateBoolGadget()  -  create a fully spec'ed Boolean gadget

struct Gadget *CreateBoolGadget(l_edge, t_edge, flags, activation, text, id)
		 SHORT l_edge, t_edge;
		 USHORT flags, activation;
		 UBYTE *text;
		 USHORT id;

    This function gives you total control for easily creating 3D boxed
boolean gadgets of all types.  You specify exactly the flags and activation
types of the gadget and where the top corner should be, and the rest is
taken care of.	The flags and activation arguments correspond to the Flags
and Activation fields of a struct Gadget.  The text you specify is centered
in the gadget and the gadget has the ID you give.

    Boolean gadgets created with CreateBoolGadget() have a nice 3D raised
button appearance.  If you use a highlighting method of GADHCOMP, they will
appear to press in on the screen when clicked on.

    You can specify any types of flags you would like, however not much
error checking is done on these values.  Be careful for silly combinations.
You should also remember that you MUST specify either GADGHBOX or GADGHCOMP
for the flags argument.  It is also useful to at minimum specify RELVERIFY
for the Activation argument.  Finally, you should make sure that your
window is listening for Gadget messages (either gadget UP or gadget DOWN).

    This function will NOT add the gadget to your window.  This is
something you must do afterwards (with AddGadget()) else you will never see
your gadget.  The only thing this function does is to allocate space and
return a pointer to the properly filled out structure.

    The following example will create a boxed boolean gadget at 100,25
which is highlighted by a box.	The text inside the gadget will be
"Don't have a cow dude." and the gadget will have an id of 42.

       struct Window *win;	    /* assume opened earlier */
       struct Gadget *gadg;
       char *string = "Don't have a cow dude."

       gadg = CreateBoolGadget(100,25, GADGHBOX, RELVERIFY, string, 42);
       if (gadg == NULL)
	 error_no_gadg();

       /* add it to the window and make it appear */
       AddGadget(gadg, win, NULL);
       RefreshGList(gadg, win, NULL, 1);


TODO : should provide a way for specifying custom imagery.  Most likely
       that will have to be a seperate call.

BUGS : maybe, maybe not (preferably the latter).
