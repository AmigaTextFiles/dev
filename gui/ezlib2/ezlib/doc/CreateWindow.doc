FUNCTION  CreateWindow()  -  create a fully spec'ed Intuition window

	   struct Window *CreateWindow(screen, leftedge, topedge,
				       width, height,
				       flags, idcmp)
			   struct Screen *screen;
			   int leftedge, topedge, width, height;
			   ULONG flags, idcmp;

    This function allows you the most flexibility over specifying a window.
Essentially, you can create any type of window you would like with this
call.  Flags and idcmp are exactly as you would specify in a NewWindow
structure, and are passed directly through.  If you specify screen as
non-NULL, the window will open on that screen.

    Some error checking of your position variables is done, however it is
still possible to screw yourself if you get too outlandish (like negative
leftedge, etc).  Keep this in mind if passing negative numbers could be a
problem.

    A pointer to the freshly created window will be returned, or NULL if
the window could not be opened.  You should definitely error check the
return from this function (although EzLib functions are smart about NULLs
being passed where pointers should be, the OS is not).

    To open a simple window with only a title bar, disk inserted messages
from Intuition, at 100,50 and 200 pixels wide by 75 pixels high, you would
do the following :

      struct Window *win;

      win = CreateWindow(NULL, 100,50, 200, 75, WINDOWDRAG, DISKINSERTED)
      if (win == NULL)
	no_window();

   The function call above simply asks for a window with a title bar, and
an Intuition port to which DISKINSERTED messages will arrive.  The window
would have a top corner at 100,50, and would be 200 pixels wide and 75
pixels high.

   Of course you can specify any combination of flags and idcmp messages.
You must make sure they make sense to your application however.  For
example it would not make much sense to ask for CLOSEWINDOW Intuition
messages if you have not asked for a Close Gadget in the flags variable.


TODO : probably should error check the flags/idcmp arguments and modify the
       flags argument to agree with the idcmp arg.  This would be to take
       care of problems such as in the last paragraph.
