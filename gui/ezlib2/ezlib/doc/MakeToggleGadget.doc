FUNCTION    MakeToggleGadget()   -  create an autosizing toggle gadget

     struct Gadget *MakeToggleGadget(win, l_edge, t_edge, text, id)
		      struct Window *win;
		      SHORT l_edge, t_edge;
		      UBYTE *text;
		      USHORT id;

    This function is exactly the same as MakeBoolGadget() except that the
gadget is a toggle instead of boolean. A toggle gadget means one that when
it is clicked once, it depresses and stays depressed in until clicked
again (so do let it stay depressed too long as you should keep your
gadgets happy :). This is useful for a play function on a music program
(similar to the play button on a tape player) or anything where you wish
to set options and keep them set until clicked off again.

    The gadget will have your specified text, and id. The size is
calculated automatically to nicely fit the given text (although there is a
minimum size of 30 pixels). The return value is a pointer to the created
gadget. You should keep this pointer so that you can later remove the
gadget with a call to KillGadget().

    The gadget returned is dynamically allocated, so take care to call
KillGadget() when you are done with the gadget.  Note that you should call
KillGadget() before you call KillWindow().

    The created gadget will have the id you specify so that you will be
able to determine from your Intuition messages which gadget was pressed.
You should take care to make sure that you will receive the GADGETUP
messages in your window.  Windows created with MakeWindow() do not receive
these types of messages, however, you can use the Intuition function
ModifyIDCMP() to change this behavior.

    To create a Toggle gadget with the text "Play Music", you would do the
following (assuming an already opened window) :

	struct Window *win;		/* opened beforehand */
	struct Gadget *play_gadg;

	play_gadg = MakeToggleGadget(win, 100, 25, "Play Music", 43);

	/* do whatever we want (i.e. main loop, etc...)  */

	/* free up gadget resources (i.e. memory) */
	KillGadget(win, play_gadg);

    The previous code will create and cause to be displayed an autosized
boolean gadget at 100, 25 which contains the text "Play Music", and has a
gadget ID of 43.  MakeToggleGadget() takes care of displaying the gadget
in your window, so you need not do anything extra. You should however keep
track of created gadgets so that you can properly free their allocated
memory.

    For the curious, this function calls the lower level function
CreateBoolGadget() with appropriate values.  It then calls AddGList() and
RefreshGList() to cause the gadget to display.  The only difference between
this and MakeBoolGadget() is that this function adds a TOGGLESELECT bit to
the activation argument of CreateBoolGadget().


TODO :	possibly add text to display when in a highlighted (selected)
	state. this would require a rewrite of CreateBoolGadget() or a
	duplicate function with an extra arg.  oh oh, flexibility and
	additional arguments or reduced flexibility and simplicity?
	simplicity! (for the time being).

BUGS : phooey! no bugs here young daniel-san.  me expert ninja programmer,
       no get bugs in code.
