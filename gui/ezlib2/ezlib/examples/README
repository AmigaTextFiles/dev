The examples in this directory will compile with either Aztec or SAS C. To
get them to compile, you will have to copy the Ezlib.h file in directory
above this one to your standard included directory.  Read the
Install.readme file to find out more (it's in the parent of this
directory).

A quick note about the examples.  They aren't particularly useful in and of
themselves, but are good examples of how to get going with EzLib (which is
pretty easy anyway).  You can make free use of the code here, but if you do
re-use it, give credit where credit is due (i.e. don't claim you wrote it
and please keep my name with the code).  The colors directory has a simple
color chooser done with EzLib.	It's fairly simple and isn't particularly
intelligent about screen layout (it does some stuff but if you have a
really big default font it will probably barf on some stuff).
