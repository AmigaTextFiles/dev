MenuC NOW HAS GADGET SUPPORT.
 
MenuC is a Menu/Gadget Compiler. It will take a VERY SIMPLE ascii file 
and creates those very finger intensive MENU, ITEM (SUBITEM), GADGET,
BORDER, PROPINFO, STRINGINFO, and IntuiText structures needed to create
a complete working menu or gadget. MenuC creates 'C' and 'ASM' source
files.
 
Gadgets created by MenuC will have the WB2.0 raised look.
 
Version 0.8:
	o Gadget support.
	o ALL ENFORCER hits have been FIXED.
        o many bugs fixed.
        o works under WB2.0.
