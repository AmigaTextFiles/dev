Version 37.1
------------
- Now using amiga callback hooks:
  New tags for each hook, declared the old tags as obsolete !
  The hook structures are allocated and the tags get only the function
  as data and not a hook structure !
  GUI_HookInterface tag for compilers which don't support register
  parameters.
- GEG_Status tag to replace the GA_Disabled tag
- GUI_MsgPort tag to change the message port
- Fixed some problems with disabling/enabling gadgets

Version 37.2
------------
- Removed all the code for the old hooks. Now only works with the amiga
  callback hooks ! (Due to this, old programms have to be changed to
  work with GUIEnv from this version on !
- GER_LocaleID tag for localization of requesters
- Requesters can be opened WITHOUT a GUIInfo structure to show any
  error when opening the GUI
  Due to this GUIEnvSupport has no requester support anymore !
- Menu font can be changed (GUI_MenuFont tag)
- Renamed the GUI_GadgetFont tag to GUI_TextFont
  This font is used for every gadget (and will be later used for all
  other visible text objects in newer versions)
- The gadget creation method has changed:
  The gadget gets always the font specified with GUI_TextFont, the flags
  are set to 0 and the user data to NULL ! If you want other values you
  have to specify them for EACH gadget.
  Due to this it is very important to change all programs to follow this
  new handling ! Otherwise some strange results will occur !
- Font adapive GUIs with the GUI_TextFont and the GUI_CreationFont tags.
  (Not tested yet !)

Version 37.3
------------
- The font adaptive code changed the window and gadget sizes totally wrong.
  Instead of making the window bigger it made it smaller !
  This bug is fixed now.
- Font adaptiv code now checks screen size and repositions the window if
  necessary or even uses a different font to fit onto the screen.
- RequesterExample for SAS/C and OberonA

Version 37.4
------------
- New font adaptiv code for proportional fonts.
- Changed all version numbers to the release version (37.4)
- ReqTools (© Nico François) support
- GEGen, the GadToolsBox (© Jaba Development) Code Generator for
  M2Amiga and OberonA. (The GetFileImage BOOPSI class is still missing)
- New tag GUI_DoBeep to perform a screen display beep
- New GUI action tags GUI_Lock and GUI_Unlock to lock the GUI and display
  a wait requester. This works only if the reqtools.library is available!
- The activation of an button gadget using the key shortcut is now
  displayed on screen !

Version 37.5
------------
- Added code to avoid problems with locking/unlocking the GUI. Now the GUI
  will be unlocked (if before locked) when freeing the GUI and it is not
  possible to lock a locked GUI.
- guienv.catalog for requesters. Now all buildin requester kinds (ok,
  doIt and yesNoCancel) are localized.
- ShowGuideNode now returns GE_GuideErr if it was not possible to display
  the node. But remember there could be a lot of reasons ! (No AmigaGuide,
  no guide file, no node etc...)
- Problems with GetGUIMsg/WaitGUIMsg fixed. Now getmsg checks for the
  length of the incomming message before copying it, as there were some
  problems with CycleToMenu which seems to set the length entry of the
  message incorrect ! (CycleToMenu is © Federico Giannici)
  Thanks to Matthias (starfox) Bock for reporting this problem.
- The geclass.library for making private BOOPSI classes public.
- The Get File Image BOOPSI Class
- Many bugs in GEGen fixed after several test runs:
  Fixed problems with open system font
  Bevelboxes are now created correctly
  Problems with AllocGUI/FreeGUI fixed
  The GetFileImage Class
  Resizable GUIs possible
- Localized GEGen
- 68020 version of both libraries

Version 37.6
------------
- If a button gadget was activated using a key shortcut, it was displayed
  as activated, although even if it was disabled. Now only enabled gadgets
  are displayed as activated.
- WaitGUIMsg/GetGUIMsg are now more carefully in handling messages and
  there is no busy waiting and message polling anymore.
- GEGen: corrected output for bevelboxes and listview gadgets. Thanks to
  Alfred Fent for reporting.
- Notify Option for GEGen: Now GEGen creates notification variables for
  each gadget. Thanks to Alfred Fent for this suggestion.
- Moved GEGen changes information from the GEGen.guide into this file
- Added some missing information in the GUI.guide and the Functions.guide.
- GEClass now supports the TextField gadget class © Mark Thomas.
- There were some problems under OS3.0 with the guienv.library. On some
  machines the system crashed when the guienv.library was opened and
  the amigaguide wasn't used till then. So when guienv tried to open it,
  the OS hang itself. I don't know why, but after moving the opening
  of the amigaguide from the initialisation to the ShowGuide function
  everything went fine ! Thanks to Marius Schwarz and Alfred Fent for
  reporting and helping !
- The GE_GadKeyTwiceErr had the wrong error code (102) which is the
  same as the GE_GadTooManyErr. Now it has the correct code 103.
- Thanks to Marius Schwarz for reporting all the mistakes in the
  documentation and in the examples.
