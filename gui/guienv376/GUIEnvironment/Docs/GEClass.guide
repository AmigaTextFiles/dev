@NODE GEC-Intro "Introduction to the GUIEnvironment Class Library"

The geclass.library simplifies accessing private BOOPSI classes. As it
is currently not possible to get a public BOOPSI class name by Commodore
to release BOOPSI classes for easy use for everybody, all these classes
must be declared as private.
But this solution requires in each application using this class, a
variable containing the class and the two calls to init and free the class.

Using the geclass.library there is practically no difference in private
and public classes ! If GUIEnvironment knows a class, you can create
instances of this class, simply by using the GetObject function (which
has the same parameters as NewObject) and passing it, as the private
class pointer, a pointer to the name of the class !
Now this pointer is compared with the supported classes and GUIEnvironment
gets and sets the class pointer for you ! So you don't have to care
anymore, if the class is available or not. And you don't need any
variables containing references to the class !

@NODE FCT-GetObject "geclass.library/GetObject"

NAME
    GetObjectA -- Create a new object of a class.
    GetObject -- Varargs stub for GetObject.

SYNOPSIS
    object = GetObjectA( class, classID, tagList )
    D0                   A0     A1       A2

    APTR GetObjectA( APTR, APTR, struct TagItem * );

    object = GetObject( class, classID, Tag1, ... )

    APTR GetObject( APTR, APTR, ULONG, ... );

FUNCTION
    This function does the same as Intuitions NewObject, but it is capable
    of sharing private BOOPSI classes ! If GEClass knows how to deal with
    a private BOOPSI class, you can get an instance of this class by
    passing a pointer to the class string in class !

INPUTS
    class = pointer to a private class or to a name of a public private
            class
    classID = pointer to name of a public BOOPSI class
    tagList = pointer to array of TagItems

RESULT
    If everything went fine, you will get a pointer to the new object.

NOTES
    These objects must all removed with FreeObject !

@NODE FCT-FreeObject "geclass.library/FreeObject"

NAME
    FreeObject -- Free an object created with GetObject

SYNOPSIS

    FreeObject( object )
                  A0

    VOID FreeObject( APTR );

FUNCTION
    This function frees an object, previously created with GetObject.

INPUTS
    object = pointer to an BOOPSI object.

@NODE GEC-Classes "Supported classes"

Currently, the geclass.library only supports the integrated GetFileIClass
and the textfield gadget class © Mark Thomas.
The idea of geclass.library was to support all known good public domain
BOOPSI classes, but currently I had no time to check out for other
good classes...


The Get File Image Class
------------------------

This class is a subclass of the FrameImageClass. It supports all methods
and attributes as the FrameImageClass, even resizing.

If you don't pass a width or height, GFI_Width resp GFI_Height are used.

For more information, refer to the RKRM and to the generated code for
GetFile gadgets by GEGen.

The TextField Gadget Class
--------------------------

This class is a very excellent public domain class written by Mark Thomas.
It is NOT part of GUIEnvironment, as you can get it also from the public
domain, e.g. AMINET dev/gui drawer.
GUIEnvironment supports the (current) version 2.0. The interface module
for GEClass contains all declarations to use this class.
Take a look at the TextFieldExample source to see how easy it is to use
this class with GEClass !
For more information refer to the TextField documentation provided with
the BOOPSI class.
Make sure that you have installed the class in the gadgets drawer of
your libs: directory.
