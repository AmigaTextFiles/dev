@{u}I. Preliminaries@{uu}

@{u}1.1 Preface@{uu}

What? Another GUI creator?

One should think there are enough programs around for designing GUIs.  Yet  none  of
the  existing  programs  could  satisfy  me completely. Some were too playful (which
impairs performance), others aren't supported any more and  cannot  use  the  system
calls  new  with  OS  3.0. 
But the main reason for developing this program was that almost  every one of  these
GUI creators requires an external library for which you may even have to register. 

@ENDNODE

@NODE  Reasons  "1.2  Why  should I use this program?"
@{u}1.2 Why should I use this program?@{uu}

So what does this program have to offer in comparison to other GUI creators?

For one, GUI-Creator uses the functions in GadTools.library  v39  exclusively.  Thus
there is no external library that has to provide any functions.

Furthermore,  GUI-Creator  generates easily readable and modifiable code without any
GLOBAL variables.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Requirements "1.3 System requirements"
@{u}1.3 System requirements@{uu}

The pogram requires at least OS 3.0. (Further versions may support OS 2.04 as  well.
If  you  don't  use sizing gadgets and short cuts for windows or gadgets and rewrite
the SleepWindow() and WakeWindow() functions, the generated code  (not  neccessarily
the whole program) should work with OS 2.04 already.)

A fast CPU is recommended, 2 MB of free RAM should be available, otherwise you might
run out on larger projects.

A hard disk is not required, but recommended. (Anyone who develops  programs  should
have one anyway.)

Finally  I'd like to mention that a screen size of at least 640x400 is required. For
productive work 800x600 (-> graphics card)  is  recommended  (there  are  a  lot  of
windows).

I'll also mention that you need a compiler to translate the generated source code.

The following compilers are supported directly at the moment:

- Maxon C/C++
- SAS/C
- GNU C
- DICE

Generators for the following languages are in preparation:

- Oberon
- Modula-2

@ENDNODE

@NODE Installation "1.4 Installation"
@{u}1.4 Installation @{uu}

The installation is done by the Commodore Installer program.

When  the  installation process is finished please start the @{"Preferences Program" LINK PREFERENCES}
to configure GUI-Creator for your system.

@ENDNODE

@NODE REGISTERING "2.3 Registering"
@{u}2.3 Registering@{uu}

The fee for registering is DM 30 or $30 US.

---->  print  order  form  ---> (@{"German" SYSTEM "Copy DOC/Bestellformular PRT:"}) (@{"English" SYSTEM "Copy DOC/Orderform PRT:"})

If you're interested in receiving new versions by mail, each update costs  DM  7.50.
(This  fee  should  be  transferred  to  my  account  upon receiving the update, see
@{"Author" LINK AUTHOR}.) If you're  interested in  receiving new  versions by  e-mail, each  update
costs DM 4. (This fee should be transferred to my account upon receiving the update,
see @{"Author" LINK AUTHOR}.)

Anyone who uses GUI-Creator for longer than about  2  weeks  (for  testing)  without
registering  violates the  conditions  for  using this  program and  infringes on my
copyright. The unregistered version is not limited in functionality,  but from  time
to time requesters will pop up reminding you of registering. Testing GUI-Creator one
can find out whether the program runs satisfactorily on one's system. If this  isn't
the  case, simply  delete  GUI-Creator and  forget  about it  (of  course  including
registration),  else  write  to  the   author  of  the  program   (only  by  e-mail:
m_hillen@informatik.uni-kl.de) and ask for help.

Please  keep in mind that many months of labor have gone into GUI-Creator, for which
the registration fee is not too much in my opinion, considering p&p are included  in
the  price.  In  addition, feedback from the users in the form of registrations will
decide over possible further development and bug fixes for GUI-Creator.

On registering you will receive a personal "keyfile" that licenses you for  the  use
of GUI-Creator and two possible major updates. Of course I cannot guarantee if there
will be  further  updates, or how  many of them.  After  installing the  keyfile the
"about" and other requesters will of course disappear. Further major updates  (after
the second one) will be offered to registered users for a fair price.

There are two ways to register:

a) E-Mail:

   You  transfer  the  registration fee to my  account (see  @{"Author" LINK AUTHOR}) and  send me a
   message telling me that you want to register GUI-Creator and when  you  sent  the
   money.  After I have received the money I will send the keyfile to you by e-mail.
   Since it is known that messages can get lost, don't hesitate tp contact me  again
   if  my  reply  takes  longer  than  three weeks. I will then send it iff again of
   course. If this won't work at all send me a regular letter and I will send you  a
   disk  containing  the  keyfile. To prevent problems it is important that you give
   your e-mail address and possibly also your normal address on the  money  transfer
   slip - this should rule out any mixups.

b) Mail

   You transfer  the  registration  fee to my  account (see  @{"Author" LINK AUTHOR}) and  send me a
   letter telling me that you want to register GUI-Creator and  when  you  sent  the
   money.  Instead  of  the  transfer you can also simply include the money with the
   letter, either cash or as euro cheque. No matter how - as soon as I  receive  the
   money I will mail the disk containing the keyfile to you.

If you want to register now, fill in the included  order form  (@{"German" SYSTEM  "ED DOC/Bestellformular"} or  @{"English" SYSTEM "ED DOC/Orderform"})
where the important points are spelled out again...

Many thanks for supporting the shareware concept!

@ENDNODE

@NODE Concept "Concept"
@{u}II. Program description@{uu}

@{u}2.1 The concept of the program@{uu}

... is fairly new. The program implements a raster, ie. gadgets and windows  in  the
project  are  not calculated by pixels, but according to the font size of the system
default font. This means a window can have eg. a @{"raster" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/Multiview DOC/Window1.bsh" } like this.

Thus  all  settings  you  can  adjust  in  the  program are not absolute values, but
multiples of the system default font.
Example: You specify a gadget  width of 20 units, and the system  default  font is 8
         pixels wide, then the gadget will be 160 pixels wide.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Rights "2.2 Legal issues"
@{u}2.2 Legal issues@{uu}

GUICreator ) 1995 @{"Markus Hillenbrand" LINK Author}.


GUI-Creator  is  shareware.  The  author  retains the copyright for the program. Who
wants to use GUI-Creator "seriously" resp. for  a  longer  period  of  time  has  to
register. Distributing the unregistered version is still allowed as long as there is
no commercial gain. A disk containing GUI-Creator must not  cost  more  than  DM  5.
Including GUI-Creator in a PD series is explicitly allowed under these restrictions,
as is the distribution via networks. Regardless of the mode of distribution all data 
contained in the original  GUI-Creator archive have to be  transferred  together and
unchanged.
The author offers no guarantee for the correctness or fitness for use of GUI-Creator
and  takes  no  liability  for  any  negative  consequences  caused  by  the  use of
GUI-Creator. Updates and bug fixes are not guaranteed. GUI-Creator was created using
Maxon C/C++ V3.0 by Maxon Computer, Eschborn. The GUI was  created with  GUI-Creator
itself, so you can get a first impression of the generated code.

MagicWB and thus some of the icons  delivered  with  GUI-Creator  are  copyright  by
Martin Huttenloher.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Preferences "2.4 Preferences Program"
@{u}2.4 Preferences Program@{uu}

To  adjust  parameters  there is an  external  @{"preferences  program" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/Multiview DOC/Prefs1.bsh"}. It  offers the
following options:

- Screen mode preferences

  Here  you  select  the  screen mode that you like best working with. To get an ASL
  screen mode requester simply click on the "+" gadget. Then you can select mode and
  size  of  the  screen.  Keep  in  mind  that  a minmum size of 640 x 400 pixels is
  required. Working  ist  most  pleasurable  with  800  x  600  and  above  (with  a
  corresponding system default font).

- Code generator options

  Here you set some default values for the program:

  a) Code generator: The shell command used for generating the code. These  commands
     are located in the "C" directory of the main program.

  b) Create main  part:  Whether a main program is to be generated in the code, that
     opens all required libraries and displays the first window.

  c) Create all function templates: Here you select whether so-called templates  are
     created, ie function stubs you only have to fill in later.

  d) Create a Makefile: Here you select whether a Makefile (not a real one) is to be
     created. This Makefile is a shell script that you have to execute  to  generate
     the code.

  e) Create Foldmarks: Here you select whether  fold marks  should be  generated for
     the functions. At this time only '///' is supported (-> GoldED).

- Save and Cancel

  cause the selected parameters to be saved or leave the preferences program. If you
  leave  the  program, no modifications will be saved. Also, new values don't change
  the behavior of the running program; to activate them  you  have  to  restart  the
  program.

@ENDNODE

@NODE WINDOWPREFS "2.5 Main program"
@{"Window Prefs" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/Multiview DOC/WindowPrefs.bsh"}:

- Width : The width of the window as a multiple of the width of the default font.
- Height: The height of the window as a multiple of the height of the default font.
- Name  : The  name of the window, that prefixes the  functions  in the  source code
          (so you can differentiate between the windows)
- Title : The window title
- Close : If you enter CLOSEWINDOW here, the window is simply  closed, if you  enter
          anything else, a BOOL function is called that you have to supply yourself.
          If this function returns TRUE, the  window is closed, if it returns FALSE,
          it remains open.
- SizeXX: Should the window have a size gadget (bottom or right hand side or both)?
- Setup : This function is called after the window has been opened  and all  gadgets
          have been drawn.
- Refr. : A function that is called when the window's size gadget has been activated
          (and you may have to redraw something).

@ENDNODE

@NODE MAINPROGRAM "2.5 Main program"
@{u}2.5 Main program@{uu}

After starting the program you see two @{"gadgets" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/Multiview DOC/Start.bsh"}, that let you either load an existing
file or  create a new one.  Since @{"loading" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/Multiview DOC/Load.bsh"}  should be  self-explanatory,  we will now
discuss @{"creating" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/Multiview DOC/Edit1.bsh"} a new GUI:

- Name of GUI: The Name of the GUI, that is prefixed when creating source  code,  so
               that  different  projects do not overwrite each other.
- Path of GUI: The path  where the  source code  is to be  generated later.  You can
               either enter a path by hand here or click on the  adjacent  symbol to
               get an ASL requester.
- Picture    : The name of the picture that is displayed when the user of your later
               program selects  "about"  from the  menu.  This path  must  either be
               absolute or relative to the  path of  your later  program.  (Best use
               PROGDIR:About.IFF or PROGDIR:pictures/about.IFF or something similar).
- About Text : If you click on "Edit" here, you get a number of string gadgets  that
               accept an "about"  text, ie a  text to  accompany the above  picture. 
               This  can for  @{"example" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/Multiview DOC/AboutExample.bsh"}  be a  reference about  the
               program, the author and the copyright.

If you click on "Continue" now, or if you've loaded a GUI, the @{"layout window" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/Multiview DOC/LayoutWindow.bsh"} appears
where you can start the following actions:

- @{"Application" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/Multiview DOC/Layout2Gui.bsh"}:

  A now familiar window appears.

- @{"Window " SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/Multiview DOC/Layout2Win.bsh"}:

  Click here to add, select, delete @{"windows" LINK WindowPrefs} or to  change  their order  (since  the
  first window is opened first when creating a Makefile).

- @{"Menus  " SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/Multiview DOC/Layout2Menu.bsh"}:

  Click here to define menu entries for the active window. There  is  a  comfortable
  requester  for  entering  menus whose usage is intuitive. Notice the arrows in the
  upper part of the window: they tell you which is the  current  mode  of  operation
  (menu,  item  or  subitem).  If  you  enter  'About' as the function, the standard
  function About() will be called which was by default associated with any window in
  versions 1.0 to 1.3.
  Thus, you can now decide yourself where this window is opened. If you  don't  want
  to  use  the  About  window,  enter an empty string to Aboutpic in the application
  preferences.  HTis  way  the  function  won't   be   generated   (well,   a   good
  compiler/linker should discard unused functions anyway).

  Notice: mutually exclusive menus are not yet supported.

  Here you can change the parameters (see @{"preferences program" LINK Preferences}) and  have the source
  code generated. The application sleeps until code generation has  finished.  There
  is no check (yet) if code generation was successful.

@ENDNODE

@NODE PROGRAMMERTIPS "2.6 Programming hints"
@{u}2.6 Programming hints@{uu}

- The "about" picture must be 200 x 100 pixels in size and should not use more than
  8 colors (it is  probably best to use the 4  workbench colors). If you  open your
  own screen for the windows, the picture should use that screen's palette.

- The  parameters  "APTR userdata" are intended for your use. They are simply passed
  on.

- The parameters of the function Handle<WindowName>() are  a  screen  on  which  the
  windows are to be opened, coordinates for the upper left corner of the windows (-1
  for arrange) and userdata (see above).

- If a window should be able to be closed you can also do it like this:
  void CancelClicked( ... )
  {
     Signal(FindTask(NULL),SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C);
  }

- The  generated  Makefile of  GUI-Creator_C has a "cc" in the  beginning. By making
  this an alias you can easily compile programs. For the Maxon  C/C++  compiler this
  could look like this:

  Alias cc MCPP:Bin/MCPPC3 -w1500 -pc -i MCPP:Include|T: []

- The stack of the program should be set to 50 000 bytes to avoid stack overflow.

I'm looking for:

- suggestions for improving code generation and the handling of the main program.

- bug reports for the program or the documentation.

- programmers  who  are  interested in  writing code  generators for other languages
  (Oberon, E, Modula, Lisp :-). If you are  interested and  have an e-mail  address,
  you can get a keyfile for  GUI-Creator free.  Write to  me and  I'll send  you the
  source for my C generator as a guideline. And for starters here is the EBNF of the
  meta language for GUI projects: @{"->" LINK EBNF}

- writing  addicts  who  want  to translate the  documentation into English, French,
  Italian,  Chinese :-). Send me your translation  and you  receive a free  keyfile.

- screen support
- notifications
- online helpusing the help key and AmigaGuide or MultiView
- generating OS 2.04 code
- integrated locale  support
- free  choice  of fonts
- built in support of exec lists for listviews and similar

All these things should be realized some time. The order in which  they  are  listed
doesn't  reflect priority. When registering, state which is most important. Based on
this information I will (if there  are  sufficient  registrations)  implement  these
things.
