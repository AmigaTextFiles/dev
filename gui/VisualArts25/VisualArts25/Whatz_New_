--------------------------------

* Visual Arts Preference setup

        -The 'Use' option is now added.
        -History check box is now fixed.

* Window Setup

        -Added Zoom gadget fields for window.
        -Added the SuperBitMap check box. It you want the window to be a
         scrollable super bitmap you'll need to check the 'SuperBitMap'
         checkbox.  The default for window with scrollable arrows is no
         super bitmap. (only for window types (13-16)

     Future Enhacement
        
         -Since the Zoom option is added to the window attribute, every
          window now has zoom gadget no matter if you want one or not.
          Future will allow you to select Zoom on or off.

         -When adding a border to an object using the keyboard short cut,
          (alt-1, alt-2, atl-3) before it creates the border but the object
          ID doesn't change for the next border.

* Hilight/Custom Button

         -When creating a hilight button before it didn't read the widht
          and height correctly thus creating a one by one pixel object,
          although it works for the custom button.

* Context Sensitive Layout

         -Before when adding/editing a script the codes for CSL was not
          added.  This only works if you are editing the object for the
          first time, if you are editing an existing script the codes will
          not be generated thus the context sensitive layout will NOT work!
           
     Future Enhacements
     
         -Remember listview selected item.
         -Support primitive objects and custom buttons and images.
