This is a somewhat complete program which I distribute as a demo of BGUI.
It  is	a  CD-ROM  Audio  Disk	player program which should work  on most
SCSI-2 CD-ROM devices. If it doesn't on your setup, source is included.

 It has been reported to work on:

 o CHINON CDS-525.
 o Toshiba 4101.

 And not to work on:

 o Mitsumi & TandemCD.device.

The  GUI  of  the  player  is so simple that I am not going to explain it
here. It should be quite obvious as to what all controls are used for.

This  file is by no means ment as a documentation but it does explain the
somewhat  less	obvious things.   Namely  the configuration  file of BGP.
The configuration file "bgp.prefs" can hold the following commands:

DEVICE NAME/K,BOARD/K/N,LUN/K/N,ADDRESS/K/N

	NAME
		The  name  of  the SCSI device which you use to interface
		with your CD-ROM player.  The  supplied  config  file has
		"a4000_atapi.device" which is the driver I'm using.

	BOARD
		Controller board number.

	LUN
		Logical Unit Number.

	ADDRESS
		The target ID.

POPKEY KEY/A/F

	KEY
		The input description string of the key which you want to
		use for opening the player window.

PUBSCREEN SCREEN/K,DEFAULT/S

	SCREEN
		The name of the public screen of which the  player window
		should open.

	DEFAULT
		When specified the window will open on the default public
		screen.

POPUP YES/S,NO/S

	YES
		Will open the window uppon startup.

	NO
		Will not open the window uppon startup.

DISKPATH PATH/F

	PATH
		The  complete  path  name in which the player is going to
		look for and write the disk catalog files. The disk files
		in the distribution is a small selection of my CDs.

When entering the  disk  title,  artist,  track  titles etc.  the CD must
remain in the drive.

The only thing that is left for me to say is that the player is based  on
the SCSI code from the MultiCDPlayer by Boris Jakubaschk and the SCSIUtil
tool by Gary Duncan and Heiko Rath all of which I wish to thank for their
permission to include their code in BGP.

Enjoy,
