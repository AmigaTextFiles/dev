    NAME
        Class:          groupclass
        Superclass:     baseclass
        Include File:   <libraries/bgui.h>

    FUNCTION
        To layout it's members in a specific area.   A groupclass  object may
        have any number of members which are layouted accoording  to a set of
        layout attributes.

        The number of members a group can have is only limited by  the amount
        of available memory. This will allow for simple and extremely complex
        layout's.

    NEW METHODS
        GRM_ADDMEMBER -- This  method  can  be  used  to  add  a member to an
                existing group. This method uses the following custom message
                structure:

                struct grmAddMember {
                        ULONG           MethodID;    /* GRM_ADDMEMBER */
                        Object         *grma_Member; /* Object to add. */
                        ULONG           grma_Attr;
                };

                grma_Attr -- This is an array of attributes which control the
                        way the object is layouted.  The following attributes
                        are possible:

                        LGO_FixWidth -- ti_Data contains the  width at  which
                                the object is fixed.

                        LGO_FixHeight -- ti_Data contains the height at which
                                the object is fixed.

                        LGO_Weight -- Scaling objects  is weight  controlled.
                                the default weight  an  object  get's  is 50.
                                This attribute  can  be  used to  change that
                                setting.

                        LGO_FixMinWidth -- The  object   is  fixed   at  it's
                                minimum width.

                        LGO_FixMinHeight -- The  object  is  fixed   at  it's
                                minimum height.

                        LGO_Align -- Normally  only  objects  in  a  vertical
                                group are aligned when they  have a  label on
                                the left side  of  their  hitbox.  When  this
                                attribute is TRUE the object will get aligned
                                wherever the label is placed.

                        LGO_NoAlign ** V38 ** -- Normally  all  objects  in a
                                vertical group with a label  on  the  left of
                                the hitbox are all aligned. This tag prevents
                                this.

                Example:
                        Object          *group, *cycle;

                        DoMethod( group, GRM_ADDMEMBER, cycle,
                                  LGO_FixMinHeight, TRUE,
                                  LGO_Weight,       DEFAULT_WEIGHT,
                                  TAG_END );

                This adds a cycle object to a group fixing the height to it's
                minimum size and the weight to 50.

                Please note that the weight of an object  affects to  with of
                the object in a horizontal group and the height of the object
                in a vertical group.

                This method may only be used when the  group  is _not_ active
                (I.E. displayed in a window).

                Returns TRUE uppon success, FALSE uppon failure.

                If this method was successfull you do not need to dispose  of
                the added member anymore. This will be disposed of as soon as
                the group to which the member was added is disposed of.

        GRM_REMMEMBER -- With  this method you  can remove  an object  from a
                group again. This method  uses the  following  custom message
                structure:

                struct grmRemMeber {
                        ULONG           MethodID;    /* GRM_REMMEMBER */
                        Object         *grmr_Member; /* Object to remove. */
                };

                This method may only be used when the  group  is _not_ active
                (I.E. displayed in a window).

                Return code not defined.

                You are responsible for disposing of the removed object.

        GRM_DIMENSIONS -- This method is sent to all members to inquire about
                their minimum sizes. Please refer to the  "methods.doc"  file
                for more information on this method.

        GRM_ADDSPACEMEMBER -- This method can be used to  add a  special kind
                of  object  to  the  group.   The  member  will  be  a weight
                controlled  spacing  in  the  group.   This  method  uses the
                following custom message structure:

                struct grmAddSpaceMember {
                        ULONG           MethodID;   /* GRM_ADDSPACEMEMBER */
                        ULONG           grms_Weight;
                };

                grms_Weight -- This  field  must  contain  the  weight of the
                        spacing object.   Please refer  to the  GRM_ADDMEMBER
                        section for more information about weights.

                This method may only be used when the  group  is _not_ active
                (I.E. displayed in a window).

                Returns TRUE uppon success, FALSE uppon failure.

        GRM_INSERTMEMBER --  This   method   is   basically   the   same   as
                GRM_ADDMEMBER with the exception that you can determine where
                the object is added.  This  method  uses the following custom
                message structure:

                struct grmInsertMember {
                        ULONG           MethodID;    /* GRM_INSERTMEMBER */
                        Object         *grmi_Member; /* Object to add. */
                        Object         *grmi_Pred;
                        ULONG           grmi_Attr;
                };

                grmi_Pred -- This must point to  the object  after  which the
                        new member is inserted.  You may set this to  NULL in
                        which case the new member is inserted at the start of
                        the list.

                grmi_Attr -- This is an array of attributes which control the
                        way the object is layouted.   The  attributes allowed
                        here are exactly the same as the  attributes  you can
                        use with the GRM_ADDMEMBER method.

                Example:
                        Object          *group, *cycle, *button;

                        DoMethod( group, GRM_INSERTMEMBER, cycle, button,
                                  LGO_FixMinHeight, TRUE,
                                  LGO_Weight,       DEFAULT_WEIGHT,
                                  TAG_END );

                This adds a cycle object to a group fixing the height to it's
                minimum  size  and  the weight to 50.  The  cycle  object  is
                inserted after the button object.

                Please note that the weight of an object  affects to  with of
                the object in a horizontal group and the height of the object
                in a vertical group.

                This method may only be used when the  group  is _not_ active
                (I.E. displayed in a window).

                Returns TRUE uppon success, FALSE uppon failure.

                If this method was successfull you do not need to dispose  of
                the added member anymore. This will be disposed of as soon as
                the group to which the member was added is disposed of.

    CHANGED METHODS
        OM_DISPOSE -- When this  method is called it will  also dispose of all
                objects that are added to the group.

    NAME
        GROUP_Style -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        Set  the  style  of  the  group  to  create.  The following styles are
        possible:

        GRSTYLE_HORIZONTAL -- A horizontal group is created.

        GRSTYLE_VERTICAL -- A vertical group is created.

        Default is GRSTYLE_HORIZONTAL. Applicability is (I).

    NAME
        GROUP_Spacing -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        Set  the  number of pixels the group uses as a space between the group
        members.

        Default is 0. Applicability is (I).

    NAME
        GROUP_HorizOffset,         GROUP_VertOffset,         GROUP_LeftOffset,
        GROUP_RightOffset, GROUP_TopOffset, GROUP_BottomOffset -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        Set the offset in pixels from the group borders at which the layouting
        is started. Please note that frames are not taken into consideration.

        Default is 0. Applicability is (I).

    NAME
        GROUP_Member -- ( Object * )

    FUNCTION
        To add a member to a group at initialization time.  This tag is read a
        little different than the other tags.  Following  the object a  set of
        layout attributes can be passed. Example:

        UBYTE           *labels[] = { "LAB1", "LAB2", NULL };
        Object          *group, *cycle;

        /* With macros */
        group = HGroupObject,
                StartMember,
                        cycle = Cycle( "Cycle", labels, 0, 0 ),
                        FixMinHeight, Weight( DEFAULT_WEIGHT ),
                EndMember,
        EndObject;

        /* Without macros */
        group = BGUI_NewObject( BGUI_GROUP_GADGET,
                GROUP_Member,
                        cycle = BGUI_NewObject( BGUI_CYCLE_GADGET,
                                LAB_Label,      "Cycle",
                                CYC_Labels,     labels,
                                CYC_Active,     0,
                                GA_ID,          0,
                                TAG_END ), LGO_FixMinHeight, TRUE,
                                           LGO_Weight, DEFAULT_WEIGHT,
                                           TAG_END, 0,
                TAG_END );

        As you can see the layout attributes follow the object  pointer in the
        ti_Data field directly. Therefore it is also important that the layout
        attributes are terminated  with a  TAG_END, 0  rather  then  a  single
        TAG_END. The macros will automatically do this for you.

        If by any chance the object you add is NULL. The creation of the group
        will fail. All objects that where successfully added to the  group are
        disposed of in this case.

        Default is NULL. Applicability is (I).

        documented   for   the   FRM_BackFill   attribute  of  the  frameclass
        documentation. Please note that this tag  is overided  when  the group
        has a frame attached to it.

        Default is 0. Applicability is (I).
