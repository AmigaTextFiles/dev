    NAME
        Class:          progressclass
        Superclass:     baseclass
        Include File:   <libraries/bgui.h>

    FUNCTION
        To  provide  a  progression  indicator  in  the  form of a fuel guage.
        Objects from this class will send out the following attribute pairs in
        notification events:

        GA_ID           - Gadget object ID.
        PROGRESS_Done   - Current level of progression.

    NAME
        PROGRESS_Min, PROGRESS_Max - ( LONG )

    FUNCTION
        Set the minimum and maximum possible progression.

        Defaults are 0 minimum and 100 maximum. Applicability is (IS).

    SEE ALSO
        PROGRESS_Done

    NAME
        PROGRESS_Done -- ( LONG )

    FUNCTION
        Set or update the current level of progression.

        Default is 0. Applicability is (ISGNU).

    SEE ALSO
        PROGRESS_Min, PROGRESS_Max

    NAME
        PROGRESS_Vertical -- ( BOOL )

    FUNCTION
        To  make  the  indication vertical. By default the guage is horizontal
        which  is  filled  from left to right. A vertical guage is filled from
        bottom to top.

        Default is FALSE. Applicability is (I).

    NAME
        PROGRESS_Divisor -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        Set  a divisor which is used to devide the level of progression before
        it  is  rendered.  This  is necessary when the progression minimum and
        maximum levels are very far appart (I.E. 0 to 0xFFFFFFFF).  This way a
        fairly accurate progression is displayed.
