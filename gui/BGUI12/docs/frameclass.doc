    NAME
        FRM_Type - ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        Set  or  get  the  type of the used framing. You can select any of the
        following types:

        FRTYPE_CUSTOM --  This is a custom framing type which is automatically
                set when you supply a framing hook.

        FRTYPE_BUTTON -- Standard button gadget frame.

        FRTYPE_RIDGE -- Standard string gadget frame.

        FRTYPE_DROPBOX -- Standard icon-dropbox frame.

        FRTYPE_NEXT -- Standard  NeXT  frame  which  basically  is an inverted
                (recessed) string gadget frame.

        FRTYPE_RADIOBUTTON -- Standard MX gadget frame.

        FRTYPE_XEN_BUTTON -- XEN style button frame.

        Default is FRTYPE_BUTTON. Applicability is (ISG).

        FRM_CustomHook

    NAME
        FRM_CustomHook, FRM_BackFillHook -- ( struct Hook * )

    FUNCTION
        Set or get custom framing and/or backfilling hooks.  These  hooks  are
        called as follows:

        rc = hookFunc( hook, object, message );
        D0             A0    A2      A1

        The  message  packet  can  be  a  pointer  to  any  of  the  following
        structures:

        struct FrameDrawMsg {
                ULONG             fdm_MethodID; /* FRM_RENDER */
                struct RastPort  *fdm_RPort;
                struct DrawInfo  *fdm_DrawInfo;
                struct Rectangle *fdm_Bounds;
                UWORD             fdm_State;
        };

        fdm_RPort -- This points to the RastPort in which the frame/background
                must be rendered.

        fdm_DrawInfo --  This  points  to  a  DrawInfo structure as defined in
                <intuition/screens.h>

        fdm_Bounds -- This points to a Rectangle structure in which the bounds
                of the frame/background are stored.

        fdm_State -- This holds the state in which you should render the frame
                or background.  Please  refer  to <intuition/imageclass.h> for
                more information about rendering styles.

        The  FrameDrawMsg  is  sent to both the custom and backfill hooks when
        they must render.

        struct ThicknessMsg {
                ULONG             tm_MethodID; /* FRM_THICKNESS */
                struct {
                        UBYTE    *Horizontal;
                        UBYTE    *Vertical;
                }                 tm_Thickness;
                BOOL              tm_Thin;
        };

        tm_Thickness -- In  this  field  you  must store the thickness  of the
                frame lines. The thickness requested is the width in pixels of
                the left OR right border (Horizontal) and the height in pixels
                of the top OR bottom border (Vertical).

        tm_Thin -- This field is added in V38 of the library.  Do  not attempt
                to read it with lower versions of the  library!  When  set  to
                TRUE you must give the thickness of  the frame  when it  is in
                thin (FRM_ThinFrame) mode.

        The ThicknessMsg is only sent to the custom frame hook.

        The hook routines must return any of the following return codes:

        FRC_OK -- OK. Message understood and executed.

        FRC_UNKNOWN -- Message not understood. The class will default in  this
                case.

        Defaults are NULL. Applicability is (ISG)

    NAME
        FRM_Title -- ( STRPTR )

    FUNCTION
        Set  or  get  the  frame  title.  Each  frame can have a title in it's
        top-border. With this attribute you set that title.

        Default is NULL. Applicability is (ISG).

    SEE ALSO
        FRM_TextAttr

    NAME
        FRM_TextAttr -- ( struct TextAttr * )

    FUNCTION
        Set  or  get  the  font that is used to render the frame title. Please
        note  that  this font is opened width OpenFont() and must be available
        in memory.

    SEE ALSO
        FRM_Title

    NAME
        FRM_Flags -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        To initialize any of the following flags:

        FRF_EDGES_ONLY -- When  this  flag  is  set  only the frame border are
                rendered. The background isn't touched.

        FRF_RECESSED -- Normally the frame is raised.  With  this flag set the
                frame is recessed by default.

        FRF_CENTER_TITLE -- Normally the frame title is rendered with the text
                baseline on the top border of the frame. When this flag is set
                the title is cenetered on the top border of the frame.

        FRF_HIGHLIGHT_TITLE -- Normally the frame title is  rendered  with the
                TEXTPEN. When this flag is set the title is rendered using the
                HIGHLIGHTTEXTPEN.

        FRF_THIN_FRAME -- This  flag, when set,  will  halve  the  size of the
                vertical borders of the frame.  This  looks  a  lot  better on
                screens width a 1:1 aspect ratio.

        Default is 0. Applicability is (ISG).

    NAME
        FRM_BackFill -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        Set or get the built-in background type to use.  You can select any of

                frame type.

        SHINE_RASTER -- A raster with the SHINEPEN and BACKGROUNDPEN.

        SHADOW_RASTER -- A raster with the SHADOWPEN and BACKGROUNDPEN.

        SHADOWBLOCK -- A SHADOWPEN fill.

        Please  note  that  setting any of the above backfill types except for

   FUNCTION
        To specify the background colors of a frame.  The FRM_xxPen attributes
        must  be  used  to  specify  the  pen  number  of the used color.  The
        FRM_xxxDriPen  attributes  must  be  used  to specify the DrawInfo pen
        number to use. You can specify two colors. The background color of the
        frame in a normal unselected  state  and  the  background color of the
        frame in selected state.

        Specifying ~0 (-1) for the pens will deactivate the backfill color and
        the class will fall back to the default coloring sceme.

        Defaults are ~0. Applicability is (ISG).
