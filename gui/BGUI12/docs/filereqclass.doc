    NAME
        Class:          filereqclass
        Superclass:     ROOTCLASS
        Include File:   <libraries/bgui.h>

    FUNCTION
        To  provide  a  BOOPSI  interface  class to the ASL FileRequester. The
        advantage  of  this  class is that the objects remember their complete
        settings  like  requester  size,  path,  directory,  file  and pattern
        strings as long as the object remains valid.

    NEW METHODS
        FRM_DOREQUEST -- Sending  this  method  to  the  object  will open the
                requester.

                FRQ_OK            -- Ok. No problems.
                FRQ_CANCEL        -- The requester was cancelled by the user.
                FRQ_ERROR_NO_MEM  -- Out of memory.
                FRQ_ERROR_NO_FREQ -- Could  not   allocate   a   FileRequester
                        structure.

    CHANGED METHODS
        OM_SET -- This method returns 0 when everything went OK. Uppon failure
                it will return FRQ_ERROR_NO_MEM.
