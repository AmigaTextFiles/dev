    NAME
        Class:          labelclass
        Superclass:     IMAGECLASS
        Include File:   <libraries/bgui.h>

    FUNCTION
        To  provide  a  general  labeling  image. It supports underscoring and
        placement  of  the label simular to the gadtools gadget labels. It has
        been  constructed  in  a way to make multi-line labels possible in the
        future in a compatible way

labelclass/Methods                                          labelclass/Methods

    NEW METHODS
        IM_EXTENT -- This  method  will ask a labelclass object for the amount
                of pixels the label extends the image bounding box.   Normally
                this method is only used by the baseclass which handles labels
                but in some cases you might need this method for yourself. The
                method uses the following custom message structure:

                struct impExtent {
                        ULONG            MethodID;      /* IM_EXTENT */
                        struct RastPort *impe_RPort;
                        struct IBox     *impe_Extent;
                        struct {
                                UWORD   *Width;
                                UWORD   *Height;
                        }                impe_LabelSize;
                        UWORD            impe_Flags;
                };

                impe_RPort -- This  must  point  to  the RastPort in which the
                        label is to be rendered.  It  is copied to an internal
                        buffer and on that  copy font changes and calculations
                        will  be  made  so the  RastPort you pass here remains
                        unchanged. This must be valid.

                impe_Extent -- This   field   is   used  to  store  the  label
                        extentions. The label extentions are simply the number
                        of pixels  which  the label extends the image bounding
                        box in either direction.  The Left and Top fields will
                        always be smaller than or equal to zero. The Width and
                        Height  fields  will always be equal to or bigger than
                        zero. This must be valid.

                impe_LabelSize -- In  this  field  the  total  pixel width and
                        height of the label is stored. This must be valid.

                impe_Flags -- This  field  may  contain  any of  the following
                        flags:

                        EXTF_MAXIMUM -- Normally  when  this  method is called
                                the returned values are the extentions as they
                                are at the moment you call this method.   When
                                this flag is set the returned  values  are the
                                maximum  possible  extentions  the  label  can
                                have.

    CHANGED METHODS
        None.

labelclass/Attributes                                    labelclass/Attributes

    NAME
        LAB_TextAttr -- ( struct TextAttr * )

    FUNCTION
        Set  or  get  the  font that is to be used to render the label. Please
        note  that the font you pass here is opened with OpenFont() so it must
        be in memory already.

        Default is NULL. Applicability is (ISG).

    NAME
        LAB_Style -- ( UWORD )

    FUNCTION
        Set or get  the style as defined in <graphics/text.h> which is used to
        render the font. Note that this style overrides the style of  the font
        passed by the LAB_TextAttr attribute.

        Default is FS_NORMAL. Applicability is (ISG).

    SEE ALSO
        LAB_TextAttr, <graphics/text.h>

    NAME
        LAB_Underscore -- ( UBYTE )

    FUNCTION
        Set or get  the  character that marks the character to be underscored.
        Normally the underscored character is used to mark a key  which can be
        used to control the gadget. Example:

                LAB_Underscore, '@'

                Will underscore the 'O' character in the following label:

                "@Open"

        Default is 0. Applicability is (ISG).

    NAME
        LAB_Place -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        Set or get the place relative to the  image  bounding box at which the
        label is rendered. The following places are possible:

                PLACE_IN -- The label is cenetered inside the image bounds.

                PLACE_LEFT -- The label is placed left of the image bounds and
                        cenetered vertically.

                PLACE_RIGHT -- The label is placed  right of the  image bounds
                        and cenetered vertically.

                PLACE_ABOVE -- The label is placed above the image  bounds and
                        centered horizontally.

                PLACE_BELOW -- The label is placed below the image  bounds and
                        centered horizontally.

        Default is PLACE_IN. Applicability is (ISG).

    NAME
        LAB_Label -- ( STRPTR )

    FUNCTION
        Set or get the actual text for the label.

        Default is NULL. Applicabillity is (ISG).

    NAME
        LAB_Flags -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        Set or get  the flag settings of the label.   The  following flags are
        possible:

                LABF_HIGHLIGHT --  Normally  the  label  is  rendered  in  the
                        TEXTPEN or FILLTEXTPEN color.  When this  flag  is set
                        the label is rendered in the HIGHLIGHTTEXTPEN color.

                LABF_HIGH_USCORE -- This is the  same  as  LABF_HIGHLIGHT only
                        now the color of the underscoring is affected.

        Default is 0. Applicability is (ISG).

    SEE ALSO
        LAB_Highlight, LAB_HighUScore, <intuition/screens.h>

    NAME
        LAB_Highlight -- ( BOOL )

    FUNCTION
        Set or clear the LABF_HIGHLIGHT flag.

        Default is FALSE. Applicability is (ISG).

    SEE ALSO
        LAB_Flags

    NAME
        LAB_HighUScore -- ( BOOL )

    FUNCTION
        Set or clear the LABF_HIGH_USCORE flags.

        Default is FALSE. Applicability is (ISG).

    SEE ALSO
        LAB_Flags

   NAME
        LAB_Pen, LAB_DriPen, LAB_SelectedPen, LAB_SelectedDriPen -- ( UWORD )
        ** V39 **

   FUNCTION
        To specify the colors of a label.  The  LAB_xxPen  attributes must  be
        used  to  specify  the pen number of the used color. The LAB_xxxDriPen
        attributes  must  be  used  to specify the DrawInfo pen number to use.
        You can specify two colors. The  text  color  of the label in a normal
        unselected  state  and  the text color of the label in selected state.

        Specifying ~0 (-1) for the pens will deactivate  the  text  color  and
        the class will fall back to the default coloring sceme.

        Defaults are ~0. Applicability is (ISG).
