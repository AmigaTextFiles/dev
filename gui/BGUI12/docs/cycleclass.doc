    NAME
        CYC_Labels -- ( STRPTR * )

    FUNCTION
        Set an array of string pointers which will be the cycle gadget labels.
        The  array  must  point to a valid NULL-terminated array or the object
        will fail to create.

        Default is NULL. Applicability is (I).

    NAME
        CYC_Active -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        Set  or  get  the  number of the currently active label where 0 is the
        first label in the array.

        Default is 0. Applicability is (ISGNU).

    NAME
        CYC_Popup -- ( BOOL )

    FUNCTION
        To make  the  cycle object into a popup menu. When this is set to TRUE
        and you click inside the label area of the cycle gadget a menu appears
        in which all choises are visible. Selecting the wanted item is simular
        to normal  menu-selection. Pressing the right mouse-button will cancel
        the selection.

        When this  option  is  on  and you press inside the cycle-image of the
        object the old selection method is used.

        Please note  that  when  the  popup  option is turned on and the cycle
        object has  more  entries  than  can be made visible on the screen the
        list will be truncated.

        On OS  3.0  systems  or  better  (V39++)  the menu will always use the
        NewLook-menu coloring.  On  systems running less than OS 3.0 the menus
        will appear in the BlockPen and DetailPen.

        Default is FALSE. Applicability is (I).
