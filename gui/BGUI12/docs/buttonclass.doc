    NOTE: The  VIT_VectorArray, VIT_BuiltIn, VIT_Pen and VIT_DriPen attributes
	  are also settable with OM_SET or  OM_UPDATE  when  the button object
	  has a vector image attached to it.

    NAME
	GA_Selected - ( BOOL )

    FUNCTION
	This  attributes  has  an  extended  applicability.  It  has been made
	get-able  to  make  it	easy to inquire about the selected state of an
	object.

	Default is FALSE. Applicability is (ISGNU).

    NAME
	BUTTON_Image, BUTTON_SelectedImage -- ( struct Image * )

    FUNCTION
	To provide a button object width a standard Intuition or BOOPSI image.
	The images will be centered  inside the object	it's hitbox.  You  can
	supply a selected image which is  shown when  the gadget  is selected.
	If no selected imagery is  specified  the normal  image is  also shown
	when the gadget is selected.

	This attribute overides the creation of a VectorClass image.

	NOTE: Since V39 of the library the images can be  changed with	OM_SET
	      and OM_UPDATE. You are responsible to make the images you change
	      will still fit in the object.

	Defaults are NULL. Applicability is (ISU).

    NAME
	BUTTON_EncloseImage -- ( BOOL ) ** V39 **

    FUNCTION
	By default the buttonclass keeps a gap between the  actual  image  and
	a frame which may be attached to the object. When you specify this tag
	as  TRUE  this	gap  will  not be there and the frame will enclose the
	image.

	Default is FALSE. Applicability is (I).
