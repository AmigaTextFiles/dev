    NAME
        Class:          pageclass
        Superclass:     baseclass
        Include File:   <libraries/bgui.h>

    FUNCTION
        To  provide   a gadget which can keep track of "pages" of gadgets from
        which one is displayed at the time. The pages can contain a groupclass
        object which has a set of members or it can contain a single gadget.

        Object  from  this  class  sends  out the following attribute pairs in
        their notification events:

        PAGE_Active     - Currently active page number.

pageclass/Methods                                            pageclass/Methods

    NEW METHODS
        None.

    CHANGED METHODS
        OM_DISPOSE -- When this method is called it will also  dispose  of all
                pages of objects attached to this object.

pageclass/Attributes                                      pageclass/Attributes

    NAME
        PAGE_Member -- ( Object * )

    FUNCTION
        To add a page of gadgets. The object may be a groupclass object having
        any number of members or it may be a single gadget object.

        Default is NULL. Applicability is (I).

    NAME
        PAGE_Active -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        Set the page number  currently  active (I.E. displayed on the window).
        The active page is the only page that can receive input.

        Default 0. Applicability is (ISGNU).

    NAME
        PAGE_NoBufferRP -- ( BOOL )

    FUNCTION
        When this  attribute is  set  to  TRUE the  pageclass  will  tell  the
        layout engine not to  setup a  buffer  RastPort  which  means that all
        rendering occures  on-screen.   This may be handy when you use objects
        which  take  some  time  to  render  like the colorwheel.gadget on 256
        colour screens.

        Default is FALSE. Applicability is (I).

    NAME
        PAGE_Inverted -- ( BOOL )

    FUNCTION
        To force the members added at create time  to be  AddHead()'ed  to the
        member  list  instead  of  AddTail()'ed.   This  is  necessary for the
        assembly macros of the BGUI package.

        Default is FALSE. Applicability is (I).
