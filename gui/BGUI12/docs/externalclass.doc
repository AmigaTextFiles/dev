    NAME
        Class:          externalclass
        Superclass:     baseclass
        Include File:   <libraries/bgui.h>

    FUNCTION
        To provide an interface class which can be used to include third-party
        gadget  classes  like  the colorwheel.gadget in a BGUI user interface.
        Notification  is  currently only possible via the WM_ADDUPDATE method.
        See  the  windowclass  documentation  for  more  information  on  this
        subject.

    NAME
        EXT_Class -- ( Class * ), EXT_ClassID -- ( STRPTR )

    FUNCTION
        Set  the  class  from  which this class needs to create an object. The
        EXT_Class attribute expects a pointer to an already initialized class.
        The EXT_ClassID expects the name of the public class like for instance
        "colorwheel.gadget".  Please  note  that  _you_  are  responsible  for
        opening and closing the class library yourself.

        Default NULL. Applicability is (I).

    NAME
        EXT_MinWidth, EXT_MinHeight -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        As  external  classes  normally  do  not  understand the layout engine
        methods  used  by  BGUI  it  has  to  be  helped  a little. With these
        attributes  you  set  the  minimum  width  and  height of the external
        object.  It is very important to set reasonable values here because no
        checks are made.

        Default is 0 (stupid size). Applicabilty is (I).

    NAME
        EXT_TrackAttr -- ( Tag )

    FUNCTION
        To  tell which attributes from the external object need to be tracked.
        Because some external classes, like the colorwheel, cannot change size
        once  created  it  is necessary that the externalclass  re-creates the
        object  at  each  size  change. As this usually means that the current
        external  object  settings are lost you can tell which attributes need
        to be tracked.

        The  tracked  attributes are obtained by sending the external object a
        OM_GET  method  for  each  of the attributes. This means that the only
        attributes  that  can be tracked are the ones that are gettable on the
        external object. There is no limit as to the number of attributes that
        are trackable.

        You  can also pass attributes that are ment for the external object at
        initialization time. These attributes are remembered by this class and
        re-used at each re-creation of the external object.

        Example:

        Object          *wheel;
        struct Screen   *screen;

        /*
        **      Create a "colorwheel.gadget" external object.
        **/
        wheel = ExternalObject,
                EXT_MinWidth,                   30,
                EXT_MinHeight,                  30,
                EXT_ClassID,                    "colorwheel.gadget",
                WHEEL_Saturation,               0,
                WHEEL_Screen,                   screen,
                EXT_TrackAttr,                  WHEEL_Saturation,
                EXT_TrackAttr,                  WHEEL_Hue,
        EndObject;

        All   tags   defined  above  are  saved  (including  the  tags  passed
        automatically by the ExternalObject macro). Now a seperate copy of the
        attributes to track is created.

        Once  the object needs to be re-created the  first  thing what is done
        is getting the tracked attributes values from the old object.

        Now  the  old  object  is  disposed  of  and a new one is created with
        exactly the same attributes that where passed at initialization time.

        Once  this  is  accomplished the tracked attributes are set to the new
        object.

        Please note that tracking attributes  is only  necessary with  classes
        that require a rebuild of the object when it is resized.

        Applicability is (I).

    BUGS
        The  EXT_xxx  attributes from the initialization tags are not filtered
        out of the saved tag list.

    NAME
        EXT_Object -- ( Object * )

    FUNCTION
        Get  a  pointer  to  the "real" external object. Please note that this
        pointer changes at every size change.

        Applicability is (G).

    NAME
        EXT_NoRebuild -- ( BOOL )

    FUNCTION
        To tell the external class that the external object  does not  have to
        be rebuild after a re-size. Most classes are smart enough to  handle a
        re-size  of the  object  themselves  but  there are  classes  like the
        colorwheel.gadget that requires a rebuild uppon a size change.

        When this   attribute   is   set  to  TRUE the class will not re-build
        the external  object  and  you  do  not  need to use the EXT_TrackAttr
        attributes to handle the object settings.

        Default is FALSE. Applicability is (I).
