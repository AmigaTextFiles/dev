    NAME
	BGUI_GetClassPtr -- Obtain a pointer to a BGUI class.

    SYNOPSIS
	class = BGUI_GetClassPtr( classID )
	D0			  D0

	Class *BGUI_GetClassPtr( ULONG );

    FUNCTION
	This function is ment to provide class writers an  easy way  to obtain a
	pointer to one of the bgui.library classes. The pointer returned by this
	routine may _only_ be used to subclass or to obtain objects from. Either
	reading from or writing to the class structure is not allowed.

    INPUTS
	classID         - The numeric ID of the class you need.

    RESULT
	A pointer to the requested class or NULL if the call was  unsuccessfull.

    BUGS
	None known.

    NAME
	BGUI_NewObjectA -- Get an object from a class.
	BGUI_NewObject -- Varargs version.

    SYNOPSIS
	object = BGUI_NewObjectA( classID, tags )
	D0			  D0	   A0

	Object *BGUI_NewObjectA( ULONG, struct TagItem * )

	object = BGUI_NewObject( classID, tag1, ... )

	Object *BGUI_NewObject( ULONG, Tag, ... )

    FUNCTION
	This routine is a replacement routine for intuition's NewObjectA() call.
	It is an easy way to obtain an object from any of the  BGUI classes. You
	pass it a classID and some create time attributes  and the  routine will
	return you a pointer to the created object.

    INPUTS
	classID - The numeric ID of the class.

	tags	- A set of create-time attributes  which will be passed onto the
		  class of which the object is created.

    RESULT
	A pointer to the created object or NULL if an error occured.

    BUGS
	None known.

bgui.library/BGUI_RequestA			      bgui.library/BGUI_RequestA

    NAME
	BGUI_RequestA -- Put up a requester.
	BGUI_Request -- Varargs version.

    SYNOPSIS
	gadid = BGUI_RequestA( win, req, args )
	D0		       A0   A1	 A2

	ULONG BGUI_RequestA( struct Window *, struct bguiRequest *, ULONG * )

	gadid = BGUI_Request( win, req, arg1, ... )

	ULONG BGUI_Request( struct Window *, struct bguiRequest *, ULONG, ... )

    FUNCTION
	To  put  up  a	requester.   It  is typically the  same  as  intuition's
	EasyRequestArgs() only this routine allows you to put in InfoClass style
	command sequences in the body text.

    INPUTS
	win	- A pointer to the window on which the requester will open. This
		  may be NULL.

	req	- A pointer to	an  initialized  bguiRequest  structure.    This
		  structure is	simular  to  intuition's  EasyStruct  structure.
		  It is used to control the  general  look of the requester. The
		  structure is	initialized  with the following data:

		  br_Flags	  - This  field can contain any of the following
				    flags:

				    BREQF_CENTERWINDOW
					This  will center the requester over the
					window 'win' if a  valid  pointer  to  a
					window is passed.

				    BREQF_LOCKWINDOW
					This will  disable  the window	on which
					the requester appears from receiving any
					IDCMP messages.   Also a busy pointer is
					set on that window.   NOTE: ' win'  must
					point to a window for this to work.

				    BREQF_NO_PATTERN
					This will suppress the backfill pattern.

				    BREQF_XEN_BUTTONS
					When set this flag will make the buttons
					framing appear as XEN style framing.

				    BREQF_AUTO_ASPECT
					When set all  the  requester  will  make
					some aspect  ratio dependant  changes to
					the GUI like thin/thick frames etc.

				    BREQF_FAST_KEYS
					This flag tells BGUI to  use  the Return
					and Esc key as default positive/negative
					responce to the  requester.  Please note
					that  no  visual  confirmation	is given
					at this time when the key is pressed.

		  br_Title	  - A pointer to the title of the requester.  If
				    this is NULL the title of the window is used
				    if one is present.	In the	last  case "BGUI
				    Request"  or  it's  localized  equivalent is
				    used.


		  br_GadgetFormat - A  pointer to the gadget label string.   The
				    gadget  labels   are   truncated  by  a  '|'
				    character. I.E "OK|Cancel" will give  you  a
				    "OK" and a "Cancel" gadget.

				    When you precede the gadget label with a '*'
				    sign the label  of	the  gadget  in question
				    is printed in bold.  Also  this  gadget will
				    automatically be the default responce of the
				    Return key when the BREQF_FAST_KEYS  flag is
				    set (see above).

		  br_TextFormat   - A printf-style formatting  string which  may
				    also   contain   InfoClass	 style	 command
				    sequences.

		  br_ReqPos	  - The  position  at which   the requester will
				    be opened.	 There are three possibilities:

				    POS_CENTERSCREEN
				    POS_CENTERMOUSE
				    POS_TOPLEFT

				    It should be obvious what  they mean.  NOTE:
				    The  BREQF_CENTERWINDOW  flag  will override
				    this setting.

		  br_Underscore   - With this field you  can  set the  character
				    which preceedes the character  to underline.
				    The  underlined  character	will  be the key
				    which activates the gadget.

		  br_Reserved0	  - These fields  are  for  future expansion and
				    _must_ be zero'd.

		  br_Screen	  - Here you can optionally  specify the  Screen
				    on	which  the  requester  must  appear.  By
				    default  the Window it's Screen is used if a
				    valid Window pointer is given.  If no Window
				    is given then this Screen is used.	If  this
				    field is NULL the  default Public  Screen is
				    used.

		  br_Reserved1	  - These fields  are  for  future expansion and
				    _must_ be zero'd.

	args	- A pointer to an array of arguments for the  C-style formatting
		  codes.

    RESULT
	1, 2, 3, 4 ....., 0 You will be returned a value ranging  from	0 to the
	amount of gadgets minus one.	 NOTE: The right most gadget will always
	return 0.

    BUGS
	This routine  really  should support underscored characters and keyboard
	short cuts.

    FUNCTION
	To disable a window from receiving IDCMP messages on  it's message port.
	This is done by putting  up an	invisible  requester and a  busy pointer

			   A0

	VOID BGUI_UnlockWindow( APTR )

    FUNCTION
	To enable a window to receive IDCMP messages on  it's message port. This
	routine must be used to 'unlock' windows locked with BGUI_LockWindow().

    INPUTS
	lock	- A pointer to the data returned by BGUI_LockWindow().	This may
		  be NULL.

    RESULT
	The window will be unlocked.

    **************************************************************************
    This routine is the same as intuition's DoGadgetMethod() routine  with the
    exception  that  this call is _simulated_ on systems running lower than OS
    3.0.   I  have  not  yet  experienced problems with this routine  on these
    systems but please keep in mind that it is basically a hack under 2.04.
    **************************************************************************

    BUGS
	This call is simulated on systems running lower than OS 3.0.  There is
	no way to avoid this...
