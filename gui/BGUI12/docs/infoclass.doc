    NAME
        Class:          infoclass
        Superclass:     baseclass
        Include File:   <libraries/bgui.h>

    FUNCTION
        To  provide  a  general  multi-line  text gadget which can be used for
        on-line  help  or  general information purposes. It has the ability to
        handle  different  text  style,  colors  and text justifications. Also
        C-style formatting codes are allowed.

        A  good  example  of  the  usage  of this class is the BGUI_RequestA()
        routine.  This  routine  uses  an infoclass object to display the body
        text.

        This gadget does not send out notification events.

    NAME
        INFO_TextFormat -- ( STRPTR )

    FUNCTION
        Set  the  textual  contents  of the gadget object. You can use C-style
        formatting  codes in the text and in addition to that you may also use
        any of the following command sequences:

        \33b    - Bold text.
        \33i    - Italics text.
        \33u    - Underlined text.
        \33n    - Normal text.
        \33c    - Center this and the following lines.
        \33l    - Left-justify this and the following lines.
        \33r    - Right-justify this and the following lines.
        \33d<n> - Set drawinfo pen <n>.
        \33p<n> - Set pen <n>.
        \n      - Start a new line of text.

        Please note the the \33c, \33l and \33r command sequences  can only be
        used at the beginning of a new line.

              FormatString()  formatting  codes.  Locale  specific  formatting
              codes will only work when the locale.library is available.
