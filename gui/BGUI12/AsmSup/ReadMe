 The  assmebly  support macros for the bgui.library  operate  simular to  the C
versions of the macros. There are a couple of exceptions though:

 o The macro require V38.3 of the library!   This is due to  the usage  of the
   GROUP_Inverted  and  PAGE_Inverted  tags.   The  stuff  will  work on lower
   versions only the GUI is inverted (I.E.  The last object will be first and
   the first object last).

 o The layout macros:

        FixMinWidth
        FixMinHeight
        Weight
        FixWidth
        FixHeight
        Align
        FixMinSize
        FixSize
        NoAlign

   In  the  C  and  E  macro  support  these can be specified directly after a
   EndObject macro. In the assembly macros these can only  be  specified after
   the EndMember macro. This must be done on the same line e.g.:

   C version:

        StartMember,
                Button( "Hello", 0 ), FixMinHeight,
        EndMember

   Asm version:

        StartMember
                Button hello,0
        Endmember FixMinHeight

        hello: dc.b 'Hello',0

   Also when you specify more than one layout macro you must seperate them  by
   a comma:

   C version:

        StartMember,
                Button( "Hello", 0 ), FixMinHeight, Weight( 100 ),
        EndMember

   Asm version:

        Startmember
                Button hello,0
        EndMember FixMinHeight,,Weight,100

        hello: dc.b 'Hello',0

   Please note the double comma between FixMinHeight and Weight. The EndMember
   macro is interpreted like this:

        EndMember [macro1,argmacro1,macro2,argmacro2,...]

   So  if  the  layout  macro specified does not require an argument you still
   need to pass an empty argument. Upto seven macro/arg pairs can be passed.

 o The HGroupObject and VGroupObject automatically  pass a GROUP_Inverted tag.
   The  PageObject  macro  automatically  passes a  PAGE_Inverted tag.  Do not
   change this or your GUI will be created with the first object at the end of
   the window. If you create custom group or page macros please make sure that
   you add these tags.

 o The following macros are to be found in the assembly macros which  you will
   not find in the C and E macros:

        DOMETHOD object,methodID[,arg1,args2,...]

        This  macro  will  invoke  method  'methodID' on object 'object'. Upto
        eight  extra  arguments  can  be passed  to this macro. This should be
        enough for most methods.

        DOGADGETMETHOD object,win,req,methodID[,arg1,arg2,...]

        The same as the DOMETHOD macro only this will call BGUI_DoGadgetMethod
        and add a GadgetInfo structure to the method  so  that the  object can
        do visual updates. This macro can take upto six extra arguments.

        PUTC value1[,value2,...]

        This macro pushes upto 15 immediate  or  absolute values on the stack.
        The value you pass will get a  '#'  prepended  to it so only immediate
        and absolute values are allowed.  All object creation  macros use this
        macro.

        PUTV value1[,value2,...]

        The same as PUTC only the values will  not  get a '#' prepended so you
        can add all sorts of data to the stack.

 For the rest the assembly macros should be  pretty  straight forward.  Please
look at the supplied demo program "Demo.s"

Enjoy,
