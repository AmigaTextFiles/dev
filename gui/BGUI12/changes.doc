`BGUI' release 1.2 - Development history.
*****************************************

V37.11
******

   * Started written history...

   * Added the PROGRESS_Divisor tag for those extremely large values.

   * BUG FIX: The progress class object could fill the gauge 1 pixel to far in
     some cases. Added some extra code to prevent this from happening.

   * Added the external class. This class makes it easy to include third party
     classes like the colorwheel.gadget in a BGUI user interface. Still have
     major problems handling notification though...

   * Added the WM_ADDUPDATE method to the window class. This method makes it
     possible to connect an external class object to another object to perform
     simple icclass style notification.

V37.12
******

   * BUG FIX:	The layout engine sometimes layouted an object one or two
     pixels to small. Added some extra code to prevent this from happening.

   * Added the LGO_Align attribute to enhance the layout procedure.

   * BUG FIX: The stringclass screwed up in computing it's minimum size when
     it did not have a frame attached to it.

   * BUG FIX: The layout engine sometimes GURU'd. Ooops. Should be fixed now.

   * BUG FIX: The LISTV_RenderHook did not setup the entry correctly in the
     lvRender structure.

   * Added the LVM_REMENTRY method which can be used to remove single entries
     from a listview.

   * Added the LVM_REFRESH method to refresh the listview object after
     adding/removing some entries.

   * BUG FIX: The infoclass computed the maximum width of the formatted text
     one pixel to small.

V37.13
******

   * BUG FIX: The window class did not succeed in opening a screen size window
     when the screen was smaller than it's default size.

   * BUG FIX: The listview class did not refresh the list correctly when a
     single entry was added.

   * BUG FIX: Fixed the AddEntryVisible macro in bgui_macros.h.

   * BUG FIX: Fixed a couple of bugs in the string class. Bugs found by Paul
     weterings.

   * BUG FIX: The Toggle() and KeyToggle() macros from bgui_macros.h did not
     make it possible to set a toggle button selected by default. Note that
     these macros require an additional parameter now. Bug found by Paul
     Weterings.

V37.14
******

   * BUG FIX: The online-help system of the gadget objects did not work at all.

   * BUG FIX: The drop-box frame used incorrect spacing when the
     FRF_THIN_FRAME flag was set.  The radio-button frame totally ignored the
     FRF_THIN_FRAME flag. Bugs found by Paul Weterings.

   * Added the LISTV_TitleHook attribute to the listview class. This hook
     makes it possible to render a title entry in the listview object. Can
     come in handy with multi-column listviews.

   * Re-arranged and adjusted the source for DICE V3.0 commercial. Boy oh boy
     it really is picky about correct prototyping now...

   * The list class now uses the memory pool routines from the 3.1 amiga.lib.
     This means working memory pools even on 2.04.

   * BUG FIX: The group class did not always yield the correct results when
     requesting the minimum size of another group. This resulted in a
     wrong-sized mx object when it had a label attached to it.

V37.15
******

   * Added task-relative information tracking. This means that from now on the
     library is a `SINGLE-TASK-LIBRARY'. If your code spawns a sub-task that
     requires the use of `BGUI' then this sub-task must open the library
     itself. It may not share the base pointer with the main-task.

   * Added the WINDOW_UniqueID attribute to give a window a unique ID of your
     choise. This ID is used by the task-relative information tracking to
     store the window size/position even when you dispose of the object and
     re-generate it.

   * Added the LVM_SORT method for re-sorting the entries in a listview
     object. Also added the SortList() macro in bgui_macros.h for this purpose.

   * Made the flag bits of the frameclass and labelclass also available as
     boolean tags. This allows for easier switching of single flags.

   * BUG FIX: The lvma_Entry field of the lvmAddSingle structure was defined
     as (APTR *) while it should be (APTR).

V37.16
******

   * You can now reset the knob of a sliderclass or propclass object to it's
     initial setting by pressing the right mouse button before releasing the
     left-button.

   * Added the WINDOW_Window attribute to enable you to obtain a pointer to
     the window structure of a windowclass object.

   * Started keeping up with the source code revisions using the Revision
     Control System (RCS) supplied with DICE 3.0.

V37.17
******

   * BUG FIX: The buttonclass now takes the design size of a vectorclass image
     into consideration when computing it's minimum size. Bug found by Wouter
     van Oortmersen.

   * BUG FIX: Fixed the rendering bug of objects on invisible pages. Bug found
     by Paul Weterings.

   * BUG_FIX: Fixed the enforcer hits of Infoclass objects in a Pageclass
     object. Bug found by Paul Weterings.

   * Added a XEN style button frame to the frame class. Also added some new
     macros to the bgui_macros header specially for this purpose.

   * Added XEN macros in the bgui_macros.h file for the checkbox and cycle
     objects.

   * Added the GROUP_BackFill attribute to supply a group backfill possibility
     without a group frame.

   * Added the BREQF_XEN_BUTTONS flag to supply the requester buttons with a
     XEN style frame.

V37.18
******

   * BUG FIX: The infoclass sometimes screwed up with text-styles. I'm not
     sure if this was a bug in the infoclass itself but I have coded a
     work-around to the problem.

   * Optimized setting pens and drawmode in a rastport. Now the code checks
     the pens and drawmode to see if it needs to change. Should speed up the
     rendering somewhat.

   * BUG FIX: When flushing the library from memory while one or more of the
     classes failed to free could result in a GURU. This should not happen
     anymore.

   * Added the seperator class which adds the possibility to seperate groups
     with a single 3D line with or without a title. Also added a couple of
     macros to bgui_macros.h for this purpose.

V37.19
******

   * BUG FIX: The stringclass by default used the wrong pens to render it's
     contents. Now the correct pens are used by default keeping track of user
     set pens.

   * Added some simple macros for NewMenu definitions in the bgui_macros.h
     header.

   * BUG FIX: Drag-selecting menus would result in replying a non-existant
     IntuiMsg (enforcer hits...  GURUs... `ouch!')

   * BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused rendering object labels in the wrong
     color when the object was selected and the label was located outside the
     object hit area.

   * BUG FIX: The HorizSlider() macro was broken.

   * BUG_FIX: Some classes screwed up computing their minimum size when the
     label was located above or below the object. This should not happen
     anymore.

   * Extended the Listview class rendering hook result code. When the hook
     returns non-NULL the class will see this as a string and render it. A
     result code of NULL is ignored. Please read the LISTV_DisplayHook section
     of the listviewclass.doc file for more information on this subject.

   * Added hook-notification to the baseclass. Please refer to the
     baseclass.doc file for more information on this subject.

   * BUG FIX: Fixed a small bug in the tab-cycling code of the string class.
     The bug caused non-tabcycling gadgets to notify the event-handler when it
     was de-activated.

   * BUG FIX: The AddEntrySelect() macro was broken.

   * Added the LVM_LOCKLIST and LVM_UNLOCKLIST methods to the listview class.
     These methods should have been in there from the beginning to prevent
     strange results when somebody is fiddling with the listview while you are
     changing one of it's entries.

   * BUG FIX: While converting a text-editor I'm writing to `BGUI' I came
     accross a buch of small bugs bugs in `BGUI'. These (I shall not list
     them) should be fixed now.

   * BUG FIX: When using a shared window port for the `BGUI' windows it would
     happen that the event handler did not get the initial IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW
     message because the port is added to the window after it is opened. Now
     the code will manually activate the window when the WA_Active tag is TRUE
     after the port has been added.

V37.20
******

   * Changed the behaviour of the WINDOW_UniqueID tag when the
     WINDOW_PosRelBox tag is also used.  Please refer to the WINDOW_UniqueID
     section of the windowclass.doc file for more information.

   * Added some extra code to ensure that the window sizing-gadget size is
     computed correctly. This will ensure the correct operation with patches
     like SysIHack. One note about SysIHack... When using the PGA_NewLook
     feature SysIHack renderes the proportional gadget left&and up from the
     intended location and to big and it ignores the PGA_Borderless tag. I
     would report this to the author of SysIHack if only I knew who Mr. BOOPSI
     was :)

   * BUG FIX: The progress class now checks frame thickness before filling the
     indicator.

   * BUG FIX: Fixed the PACKPENS() macro in bgui_macros.h. Docs clearly state
     "packed as two WORDs into a longword" but as it seems it should be two
     bytes in a word? Am I wrong???

   * BUG FIX: After testing BGUI on another public screen with a BACKGROUNDPEN
     different from 0 it came to my attention that BGUI had some problems with
     this. Now all rendering should occure OK with a different BACKGROUNDPEN
     than 0. I have fixed the labelclass and vectorclass and added a
     backfill-hook (WA_BackFill) to the windowclass to fix these problems.

   * Added a pop-up menu option to the cycle class. Also added a couple of new
     macros to bgui_macros.h to support this new option. Suggested by Jim
     Cooper.

   * The infoclass does not clip the text anymore when it won't fit. Now it
     simply renders as much text as will fit in the area.

   * Removed the text class completely. It was not a necessary class since the
     infoclass can do the most important things that the text class could do.
     The info class even does a better job at it. This also means that I
     finally got rid of all rastport-clipping.

   * The complete GUI is rendered in a buffer bitmap so that it can be made
     visible in a single blit. This looks much smoother than rendering visible
     on-screen. If a buffer cannot be allocated the rendering occures
     on-screen.

   * BUG FIX: It was possible to size an empty group to 0x0 which lead to
     potentially dangerous situations. I have made all RectFill() that are
     performed safe which means that the rectangle specified is checked for
     wierd values.

V37.21
******

   * Changed the imagery of the cycle gadget when it is in Popup mode. It is
     not the best of imagery but it works. If anybody has a better idea let me
     know.

   * BUG FIX: A window with an ID and positioned relative to a rectangle would
     be placed wrong if the window was to big for the used font. This does not
     happen anymore but windows which grow to big for the used font and have
     to use the fall-back font will not remember it's size.

   * BUG FIX: Fixed a big-fat-stupid-lame-bug in the external class. I failed
     to aply rule number one when writing a BOOPSI dispatcher by not using the
     __geta4 (__saveds) qualifier.  Bug found by Paul Weterings.

   * BUG FIX: Using a frame and/or a label on the master-group caused the
     rendering of this frame and/or label to be overwritten. Bug found by Paul
     Weterings.

   * Changed Xen frame rendering so that you get "rounded" corners. Looks much
     better.

   * Made the LISTV_Top attribute gettable as it should have been al along.

   * BUG FIX: Some IDCMP bits where not accessable with an IDCMP hook. Should
     be fixed now.

   * Added the EXT_NoRebuild attribute to handle external gadgetclasses which
     are smart enough to handle a resize themselves. Suggested by Paul
     Weterings.

   * BUG FIX: The stringclass rendered through the active page when it's
     contents was changed.  This also happened when the gadget was not located
     on the active page. Bug found by Paul Weterings.

   * Added a method to the groupclass to insert members at any place into an
     already existing group. Suggested by Paul Weterings.

   * The cycleclass notification (in popup mode) is now delayed until the menu
     window is closed. Suggested by Paul Weterings.

   * The pageclass now also renders the current page in a buffer before it is
     shown. Note that this is only true when the page to show is a group.
     Suggested by Paul Weterings.

V37.22
******

   * BUG FIX: LISTV_MakeVisible and LISTV_Select did not make the item
     visible. Bug found by Paul Weterings.

   * Added a couple of macros to create non-fixed size checkbox objects.
     Suggested by Paul Weterings.

   * Made the WINDOW_Screen and WINDOW_PubScreenName settable when the window
     is closed. Suggested by Paul Weterings.

   * BUG FIX: The Popup menu of a Popup-Cycle object would not open on the
     correct screen when the window in which it resided was not located on the
     default public screen. Bug found by Paul Weterings.

   * BUG FIX: Erasing the title area of a seperatorclass object did not yield
     the desired result when the area-pattern of the rastport was not cleared.

   * BUG FIX: After running tests with memoration it came to my attention that
     the re-size oprations where not working properly if the buffer rastport
     could not be allocated.

V37.23
******

   * Enhanced listview class scrolling a bit. The old routines had a lot of
     overhead because they simple re-rendered the complete list even if the
     top only changed one or two places.

   * Switching pages in a pageclass object looks smoother now.

   * Most small allocations are now made in memory pools instead of allocating
     them directly from the system memory pool.

   * Changed the operation of the WINDOW_SigMask, WINDOW_AppMask and
     COMM_SigMask attributes. Instead of OR'ing the mask value to the storage
     field the mask value is set now.

   * Added the WINDOW_Bounds attribute which can be used to open a window at
     the place and width the size that you want. Suggested by Paul Weterings.

   * Initial Public Beta Release... (30.09.94)

V37.24
******

   * Added the BT_HelpText and WINDOW_HelpText attributes to pop a requester
     with a help text instead of having to use AmigaGuide. for small help.
     This also results in a new BGUI catalog (version 2).

   * BUG FIX: BGUI did not recognize language changes. Now each time BGUI
     needs to access localized strings the catalog is refreshed before
     actually accessing the strings. This results in the strings always being
     in the preferred language.

   * Added the GROUP_EqualWidth and GROUP_EqualHeight attributes to make the
     members of a group all have the same minimum width and or height.

   * Made the WINDOW_Bounds attribute settable with OM_SET. You can set it
     when the window is closed or opened. Suggested by Paul Weterings.

   * Initial Public Release (09.10.94)

V37.25
******

   * BUG FIX: Most of the macros in the Amiga E support that called uppon
     BGUI_DoGadgetMethodA() were broken. Major screwup from my side. Sorry...

   * Made the GA_Disabled tag settable with OM_SET/OM_UPDATE on groupclass
     objects. When set on a groupclass object all members in the group will be
     disabled/enabled. Suggested by Paul Weterings.

   * BUG FIX: The mxclass can now be controlled by the keyboard. Keyboard
     control of this class is style guide compliant.

   * BUG FIX: Sometimes the key message handler of the windowclass could leave
     a message pending which could result in repeated keys not functioning
     anymore. Should be fixed now.

   * BUG FIX: Manually setting LISTV_Top with OM_SET or OM_UPDATE did not move
     the scroller along with the list.

   * Increased the minimum height of a listview class object.

   * The initial public release lacked the presence of the clib/bgui_protos.h
     file. Sorry about that.

   * BUG FIX: The MsgInfo in bgui_macros.[p]ma of the Amiga E support was
     broken.

   * BUG FIX: For some strange reason the OS 2.04 propgclass seems to fiddle
     with the font in the RastPort. This caused the adding of entries in a
     listview object to give strange results when the system font and screen
     font differed. Should be fixed now. Bug found by Michael Barsoom.

   * Added the PAGE_NoBufferRP and WINDOW_NoBufferRP attributes. This will
     alow you to have rendering happen on-screen.

   * Release 1.0a. Public bug-fix update #1.

V38.1
*****

   * Enhanced adding a single entry visibly to a listview object. This used to
     cause a complete list refresh with every added item. Now only the added
     entry and the prop are refreshed.

   * Seperators are rendered slightly different now. Suggested by Magnus
     Holmgren.

   * Added the LISTV_LastClickedNum attribute which can be used to query the
     ordinal number of the last selected entry of a listview object.

   * Added the WM_REPORT_ID method to the windowclass. This method can be used
     to set return codes from a IDCMP-hook or Verify-hook. The ID's are
     stacked internally and the next time the windowclass IDCMP handler is
     called returned to the application one by one.

   * Made the VIT_VectorArray and VIT_BuiltIn attributes settable on a
     buttonclass object. Suggested by Paul Weterings.

   * BUG FIX: Setting both the GA_Disabled and CYC_Active tag on a cycle class
     object would not change the label visibly.

   * Added the LGO_NoAlign layout attribute to the groupclass which forces the
     layout engine not to align the object it's hitbox with the others.
     Suggested by Florian Vorberger.

   * Now NULL may be passed with the STRINGA_TextVal attribute to the
     stringclass. Normally the system stringclass does not allow this.

   * Added the some magic numbers to the LISTV_Select attribute. Suggested by
     Michael Barsoom.

   * The alignment of the hitboxes in a vertical group sometimes made the
     total width of the group to large. Should not happen anymore. Bug found
     by Florian Vorberger.

   * Added the LVM_MOVE method and LISTV_NewPosition attribute for moving
     entries in a listview object.

   * Added the LISTV_NumEntries attribute for getting the number of entries in
     a listview object.

   * Added the LISTV_Select_Page_Up and LISTV_Select_Page_Down magic numbers.

   * Enhanced the indicatorclass minimum size calculations. The old routine
     was 100% precise but took ages to complete with a large difference
     between min & max. It now "guesses" the correct minimum size but is
     `much' faster. Reported by several people.

   * Added keyboard shortcuts for BGUI_RequestA().

   * Added the BUTTON_Image and BUTTON_Selected image tags to the buttonclass
     which may be used to add Intuition or BOOPSI imagery to a button object.

   * Optimized some stuff internally which saved a couple of bytes of the
     library. Still under the 100000 bytes ;)

   * Added the WINDOW_AutoAspect attribute and BREQF_AUTO_ASPECT flag to let
     the windowclass decide wether the objects use thick or thin framing.
     Suggested by Paul Weterings. Passed the 100000 bytes :(

   * From now on infoclass command sequences are valid for listviewclass text
     entries. Also returned strings from a LISTV_DisplayHook may contain
     infoclass command sequences.

   * The format string specified with the INFO_TextFormat and
     INDIC_FormatString attributes may now contain locale.library
     FormatString() formatting (%) codes. Please note that locale specific
     formatting codes will only work when the locale.library is available.

   * Added a screen field to the bguiRequest structure.

   * Added a Tabber mode for the mxclass. This mode will give you a Tabs-like
     object which can be used to select pages from a pageclass object.

   * Release 1.1. Second Public Release.

V38.2
*****

   * Shifted numerical gadget keys did not work. Should be fixed now. Bug
     found by Florian Vorberger.

   * Added the LISTV_MinEntriesShown attribute which can be used to determine
     the number of entries that should be visible at all times. Suggested by
     Stan Burton.

   * BUG FIX: Setting the CYC_Active attribute on a cycleclass object when it
     was not in a window would erase the old label but not set the new one.
     Bug found by Florian Vorberger.

   * BUG FIX: AmigaGuide help did not open on the correct screen if the window
     was not located on the default public screen. Bug found by Zachary A.
     Forsyth.

   * BUG FIX: Controlling a Mx object in tabs mode would not cycle through
     when it reached the end or the beginning like it was supposed to. Also
     key-activation of an mx object did not generate an event.  Bugs found by
     Johan Eliasson.

   * BUG FIX: Fixed a rendering bug in the stringclass and one in the cycle
     class.

   * BUG FIX: Sometimes a string object could be resized to small. Bug found
     by Stan Burton.

   * BUG FIX: Changing the text or arguments of a frameless infoclass object
     would result in overwriting the old text instead of replacing it. Bug
     found by several people.

   * BUG FIX: Again some macros from the E support where broker. Jeezz, maybe
     I should have tested them all.

   * Released as bug-fix patch on the mailinglist.

V38.3
*****

   * Changed the Amiga E support to require at least version 3.1a of the Amiga
     E compiler.

   * BUG FIX: Tab-cycling should work	through pages now. Simply add all string
     objects with WM_TABCYCLE_ODER and you're done. Reported by Patrick
     (poseidon@newswire.gun.d).

   * BUG FIX: The groupclass could compute the minimum size incorrect. Should
     be fixed now.  Reported by Florian Vorberger.

   * BUG FIX: The internal memory allocator screwed up by releasing 4 bytes
     short of the original allocator. Also the initializing the localization
     gave mungwall hits. Bugs found by Magne Oestlyngen.

   * BUG FIX: The listview class became as slow as a C= 64 diskdrive when
     scrolling it at the end of a large amount of entries. This should not
     happen anymore. Bug found by Johan Eliasson.

   * Enhanced adding single entries to a listview. Adding with LVAP_TAIL or
     LVAP_HEAD should be considerably faster now.

   * BUG FIX: The last enhancement could cause problems when adding the first
     item. Fixed.

   * BUG FIX: The layout engine did not read all tags when there where tags
     specified after adding the members.

   * Added the PAGE_Inverted and GROUP_Inverted tags. These tags are
     implemented to serve the assembly macro package.

   * Totally re-written the assembly header bgui_macros.i. Now it works. Added
     a small demonstration in the Demo drawer which shows the usage of the
     bgui.library in assembler. Paul Hamer put me up to this.

   * BUG FIX: Disabling and enabling a checkbox object ar any object with a
     EdgesOnly frame should not be a problem anymore. Bug found by several
     people.

   * BUG FIX: Again AmigaGuide help did not pop up on the right screen. I
     fixed for the help attached to the gadget objects but help attached to a
     window still had this problem. Bug found by Zachary A.  Forsyth.

   * BUG FIX: Opening the library twice in the same task and closing it once
     would result in a crash when using BGUI after the single close. Bug found
     by Janna Jalkanen.

   * BUG FIX: A PROGRESS_Max equal to PROGRESS_Min would result in a crash.
     Bug found by Florian Vorberger.

   * BUG FIX: Newlines in the arguments of a BGUI_RequestA() requester
     resulted in an incorrectly sized requester. Bug found by Janne Jalkanen.

   * Public bug-fix update #2.

V38.4
*****

   * BUG FIX: The way the localization was handler could dereference invalid
     memory pointers.

   * BUG FIX: Renamed the "Label" macro from the assembly support to "xLabel"
     to avoid clashes with the exec/types.i "LABEL" macro. Also the
     "WindowOpen" macro has been renamed to "xWindowOpen".

   * Released as 1.1b.

V38.5
*****

   * Quirk Fix: Uppercase GadgetKeys() now are converted to lowercase for them
     to work correctly.  Found by Michael Barsoom.

   * BUG FIX: Fixed a mean bug in the library task code which could cause
     serious problems when the same task opens the library twice. Bug found by
     Janne Jalkanen.

   * Work arround: BGUI should not have any problems with hacks like MagicMenu
     and CycleToMenu anymore. Included some additional code from Osma
     Ahvenlampi's "NewObtainGIRPort" patch to the library.

   * BUG FIX: Replace a couple of NULLs by NIL in the E macros.

   * BUG FIX: Fixed some font related problems with the cycle gadget.
     Sometimes the font height was computed wrong.

   * BUG FIX: In some rare occasions the keyboard handling of objects could
     get caught in a loop.  Should not happen anymore.

   * BUG FIX: The windowclass did not fall back to topaz 8 or the specified
     font anymore! Fixing this bug also shed light on another bug in the
     layout engine. Both bugs fixed. Bug found by Nick Christie.

   * Quirk fix. It was not possible to add tab-cycle string objects to a
     window object in stages.  Now it is. Found by Paul Weterings.

   * BUG FIX: Adding the first item to a listview did not show on the screen.
     Bug found by Emmanuel Doguet.

   * The rastport pointer passed to the Listview custom rendering hook is
     cached now.

   * BUG FIX: Removed a rendering bug in the MX class which screwed up visuals
     a bit when the object was switched from disabled to enabled state. This
     was true for the normal MX objects and mx objects in tabs mode. Bug found
     by Janne Jalkanen.

   * Added some defines to fix a spelling error in the BGUI headers in which
     "Separator" was misspelled as "Seperator". Reported by Nick Christie.

   * BUG FIX: The minimum height of string object with a label was bigger than
     string objects without a label. Bug found by Emmanuel Doguet.

   * Released as bug-fix patch on the mailing list.

V38.6
*****

   * The window class now makes a private copy of the NewMenu array passed via
     the WINDOW_MenuStrip attribute. Suggested by Janne Jalkanen.

   * BUG FIX: String class objects, when located in a tab-cycle order, sent
     two or even three messages to the windowclass event handler. Bug found by
     several people.

   * BUG FIX: Yet another dangerous bug found in the library task-tracking
     code. Sometimes the semaphore did not get released. Bug found by Zachary
     A. Forsyth.

V38.7
*****

   * BUG FIX: Setting an attribute to a cycleclass object on an invisible page
     would screw up the display. Should be fixed now. Bug found by Stan Burton.

   * BUG FIX?: Fixed a bug in the keyboard handling which might be the cause
     of the fact that sometimes qualifier keys randomly selected objects in a
     window. Reported by several people.

   * The stringclass now supplies all buffers for you.

V39.1
*****

   * Added the STRINGA_MinCharsVisible tag which allows you to determine how
     many characters must always remain visible in a string/integer object.
     Suggested by Emmanuel Doguet.

   * Made the BT_Inhibit attribute publically available. It can be used to
     determine wether or not an object is located on an invisible page.
     Suggested by Kai Szymanski.

   * BUG FIX: The WINDOW_Screen attribute opened the windows as visitors on
     the specified screen.  Bug found by Emmanuel Doguet.

   * Added the WINDOW_PubScreen attribute as an alternative way to open
     windows on a public screen.

   * Added the WINDOW_CloseOnEsc attribute which allows the application to
     receive a WMHI_CLOSEWINDOW when the ESC key is pressed. Suggested by
     Emmanuel Doguet.

   * Made the VIT_Pen and VIT_DriPen attributes settable on button objects
     with a vector image.  Suggested by Nick Christie.

   * Added the LVM_REPLACE method.

   * Added the LISTV_SelectMulti attribute to multi-select listview entries.
     Suggested by Johan Eliasson.

   * Added the LISTV_SelectNotVisible and LISTV_SelectMultiNotVisible
     attributes to (multi) select entries without them being moved into the
     view area. Suggested by Johan Eliasson.

   * Added the LISTV_MultiSelectNoShift attribute to enable
     multi-(de)selections without having to use the SHIFT key. Suggested by
     Johan Eliasson.

   * Made the LISTV_MultiSelect attribute settable with OM_SET and OM_UPDATE.
     Suggested by Kai Szymanski.

   * Added the ReplaceEntry() macro to the bgui_macros.[h|e|i] files.

V39.2
*****

   * It is now possible to double-click items in a multi-selection listview
     without de-selecting the entry.

   * BUG FIX: The LVM_REPLACE method did not free up the entry to replace.
     Ooops.

   * Added the LISTV_Select_All magic number for the LISTV_SelectMulti and the
     LISTV_SelectMultiNotVisible attributes. This will enable you to select
     all entries.

   * Added the LISTV_DeSelect attribute to deselect listview entries. A value
     of ~0 (-1) will deselect all entries in the list.

   * BUG FIX: The BREQF_NO_PATTERN flag did not work.

   * Added the WINDOW_Borderless, WINDOW_Backdrop and WINDOW_ShowTitle
     attributes. Suggested by several people.

   * Added the following tags: FRM_BackPen, FRM_BackDriPen,
     FRM_SelectedBackPen, FRM_SelectedBackDriPen, LAB_Pen, LAB_DriPen,
     LAB_SelectedPen, LAB_SelectedDriPen. These tags are used to set the
     (dri)pens of the color of background of frames and of labels. These tags
     have been made settable with the baseclass so it is possible to change
     colors on the fly. Can't remember who suggested this.

V39.3
*****

   * BUG FIX: A small optimization in the labelclass caused problems with the
     cycleclass. Whe another label was selected all labels in the cycle object
     became invisible.

   * Added the SEP_Recessed attribute to invert the colors of a separator to
     make it appear recessed.  Suggested by Stan Burton.

   * BUG FIX: The string object does not send double events to your
     application anymore. Also the notification your app got when the object
     was deactivated is removed. Bugs found by Kai Szymanski.

   * BUG FIX: The hits gotten when resizing a window with a listview while
     you're adding entries are gone now. Bug found by Greg Patterson.

   * OPT: Optimized the following classes: labelclass, frameclass,
     vectorclass, groupclass, sliderclass, propclass, windowclass. These
     optimizations should make BGUI visibly faster. More optimizations will
     follow.

V39.4
*****

   * BUG FIX: The stringclass object could be made active when disabled by
     ActivateGadget(). Should not happen anymore. Bug found by Florian
     Vorberger.

   * BUG FIX: The previous propclass optimizations introduced a bug which
     caused clicking in the prop but not on the knob not to notify a change.

   * BUG FIX: Added a work-arround for the listview->italics problem. Bug
     found by Nick Christie.

V39.5
*****

   * Tweaked the minimum size of the string object. Suggested by Kay Szymanski.

   * Made the SLIDER_Min and SLIDER_Max attributes settable. Suggested by Nick
     Christie.

   * Added the STRINGA_IntegerMin and STRINGA_IntegerMax attributes. Also
     added the SM_FORMAT_STRING method. Suggested by Michael Barsoom.

   * Made the BUTTON_Image and BUTTON_SelectedImage settable. Suggested by
     Nick Christie.

   * BUG FIX: Frames do work with indicatorclass objects now. Bug found by
     Nick Christie.

   * BUG FIX: Finally all problem with the string/integer objects and
     tab-cycling should be fixed now. Bug found by just about everybody.

V39.6
*****

   * BUG FIX: The WM_MENUDISABLED method from the windowclass did not work on
     items and subitems.  Now it does. Bug found by Emmanuel Doguet.

   * Added the BUTTON_EncloseImage attribute. Suggested by Emmanuel Doguet.

   * Added the WM_GET_SIGNAL_WINDOW method to determine the window from which
     the signal originated.

   * Added a NULL LISTV_Entry notification when the LVM_CLEAR method is
     invoked. Suggested by Michael Barsoom.

   * Optimized the baseclass a bit resulting in a slight general speedup.

   * The STRINGA_TextVal/LongVal did not get notified to any target objects.
     Bug found by Janne Jalkanen.

   * Made the BT_TextAttr attribute gettable with OM_GET.

   * Added the WINDOW_ActNext and WINDOW_ActPrev attributes. These are only
     useful and of interest to custom BGUI class writers.

   * The infoclass now makes a private copy of the format string. Suggested by
     Greg Patterson.

   * BUG FIX: Fixed a small baseclass bug which caused mis-layouting when the
     font changed. Bug found by Nick Christie.

   * BUG FIX: The infoclass did not cut of the lines properly when they went
     out of the bounds. Bug found by Daniel van Gerpen.

   * BUG FIX: The Left-Amiga+V/Left-Amiga+B shortcuts in BGUI_Request() where
     mixed up. Bug found by Emmanuel Doguet.

   * BT_TextAttr can now be set at create time which makes it possible to have
     a multifont display.

   * Finally got rid of the anoying mouse-blocking which occured on window
     sizing and opening. Still have to get rid of it when switching pages
     though.

V39.7
*****

   * BUG FIX: An empty string in a listview object did not show as selected
     when clicked.

   * BUG FIX: When resizing the GUI whilst doing some keyboard activation of
     an object could result in a crash. Yuck!

   * QUIRK FIX: Switched to system memory allocation in the info class to
     avoid problems when another task changes the text of an info-class
     object. Reported by Kai Szymanski.

   * Removed the internal task-based memory pool scheme. This presented to
     much problems when programming BGUI in a multi-task application. It was a
     bad idea to begin with.

   * Made setting WINDOW_Bounds, NULL legal. It simply fall's back to the
     default in that case.  Suggested by Emmanuel Doguet.

   * Added the BREQF_FAST_KEYS flag to default the Return/Esc keys as gadget
     keys. Suggested by several people.

   * BUG FIX: The sliderclass did not align the knob when it was released at
     the maximum position.

   * QUIRK FIX: Removed the problem of BGUI windows crashing the system when
     the size was changed via ZipWindow()/ChangeWindowBox() etc. It should
     work with tools like Yak now to. Result of this fix is that the mouse
     will block again when the window is resized using these routines.

   * Added the WINDOW_NoVerify tag to avoid problems with using DOS and not
     being able to respond to window signals quickly.

V39.8
*****

   * BUG FIX: LVM_CLEAR did not clear the LISTV_LastClicked(num) attributes.
     Bug found by Emmanuel Doguet.

   * BUG FIX: Fixed a problem with hotkeys not being disabled on page members
     which are located on a page which in turn is located on another page. Bug
     found by Joerg.

   * BUG FIX: The cycleclass still screwed up the display when the active
     antry was changed while the object was located on an invisible page. Bug
     found by Joerg.
