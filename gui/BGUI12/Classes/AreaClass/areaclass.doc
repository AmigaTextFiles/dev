    NAME
        Class:          areaclass
        Superclass:     baseclass
        Include File:   "AreaClass.h"

    FUNCTION
        To  provide  you  with an  area in a BGUI window to do your own custom
        rendering.  All  rendering  you do inside the area is done on your own
        task so lengthy drawing operations are now problem whatsoever.

        Objects  from  this  class  send  out the following attribute pairs in
        their notification messages:

        GA_ID                   - Gadget object ID.

    NOTE
        This class is provided as source code.  To  make use of this class you
        must compile it into an object module  and link it  in with  your main
        program.

        Also your program must open the following libraries:

        intuition.library       - V37 or better.
        utility.library         - V37 or better.
        bgui.library            - V37 or better.

        Ofcourse these libraries must remain open until you are done using the
        class.

areaclass/Attributes                                      areaclass/Attributes

    NOTE:
        All baseclass attributes are also valid for this class.

    NAME
        AREA_MinWidth, AREA_MinHeight -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        Since the class has no idea of the smallest area you  require  you are
        obligated to supply this information.  The values you pass here should
        be  the  absolute  minimum  width  and height of the area you require.
        These values are required to be larger than 0  or  the object creation
        will fail.

        Default 0 (failure). Applicability is (I).

    NAME
        AREA_AreaBox -- ( struct IBox * )

    FUNCTION
        To  supply  you  with  the  current  bounds  of the area to render in.
        When your event handler receives the ID of the  object you  must abort
        the current rendering action in the area and get this attribute. After
        you  done  this  you  may restart  rendering in the area using the new
        bounds.

        Applicability is (G).

    NAME
        ICA_TARGET -- ( Object * )

    FUNCTION
        You  must  set  this  attribute to ICTARGET_IDCMP otherwise your event
        handler will never get signalled when the area bounds change.

        Default is NULL. Applicability is (IS).

    NAME
        GA_ID -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        To set the ID of the area object. The ID you supply here is the ID you
        receive  in  your  event  handler  when you must restart rendering the
        area.  When  you receive the ID in your event handler it usually means
        that the area size has changed or a refresh is required.

        Default is 0. Applicability is (IS).
