    NAME
        Class:          FontReqClass
        Superclass:
        Include File    "FontReqClass.h"

    FUNCTION

        To provide you with a very easy way to implement some font  requester
        in  your  programs.

        The advantage of this  class  it  that  the  objects  remember  their
        complete setting as long as the object remains valid.

        
        Also you program must open the following libraries:

        asl.library         - V37 or better.
        intuition.library   - V37 or better.
        utility.library     - V37 or better.

        The source of this class is based on some  sources  of  Jan  Van  Den
        Baard, the creator of the famous library: the bgui.library !!!!!
