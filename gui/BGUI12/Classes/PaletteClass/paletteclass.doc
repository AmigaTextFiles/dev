    NAME
        Class:          paletteclass
        Superclass:     baseclass
        Include File:   "PaletteClass.h"

    FUNCTION
        To  provide you with a palette selector gadget simular to the gadtools
        palette gadget. It allows you to select a pen from  a range  of screen
        colors or a range of pens selected by you.

        Objects  from  this  class  send  out  the  following  attribute pairs
        in their notification messages:

        GA_ID                   - Gadget object ID.
        PALETTE_CurrentColor    - The currently selected pen.

    NOTE
        This class is provided as source code.   To make use of this class you
        must compile it into an object module and  link it in  with  your main
        program.

        Also your program must open the following libraries:

        intuition.library       - V37 or better.
        graphics.library        - V37 or better.
        utility.library         - V37 or better.
        bgui.library            - V39 or better.

        Ofcourse these libraries must remain open until you are done using the
        class.

paletteclass/Attributes                                paletteclass/Attributes

    NOTE
        All baseclass attributes are also valid for this class.

    NAME
        PALETTE_Depth -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        To determine the depth of the palette object.   Currently this is  the
        only way to determine the amount of colors in the palette object. This
        will always be a  power  of  2 (I.E. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 or 256).
        Allowable values here are 1 for two colors through 8 for 256 colors.

        Default is 1 (two colors). Applicability is (I).

    NAME
        PALETTE_ColorOffset -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        To specify the first color which is used in  the palette.  Please note
        that you must specify an ordinal number here, not a pen number.   This
        value  must  range  between  0  and  256  minus  the  amount of colors
        displayed in the palette object.

        Default is 0. Applicability is (I).

    NAME
        PALETTE_PenTable -- ( UWORD * )

    FUNCTION
        To optionally specify an array with pen numbers so that you  can build
        a palette object with the colors you want. Please note that  the array
        must contain at least PALETTE_ColorOffset + ( 1 << PALETTE_Depth ) pen
        entries. This is because the PALETTE_ColorOffset attribute  determines
        at which offset in the array the class will get it's pens.

        Default is NULL. Applicability is (I).

    SEE ALSO
        PALETTE_ColorOffset

    NAME
        PALETTE_CurrentColor -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
        To determine the currently selected pen in the palette object.  Please
        note that this number is a  pen  number,  not  an ordinal color number
        within the palette object itself.

        Default  is  the  first  color in the palette object. Applicability is
        (ISGNU).
