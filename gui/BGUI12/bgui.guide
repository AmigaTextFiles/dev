   @{b}BGUI@{ub},  (C) Copyright 1993-1995 Jaba Development. All rights reserved. This
program is GiftWare. This means that if you want to use the programs you are
morally obligated to reward the author with a gift that, you think, matches
his efforts. If you cannot think of a gift (come on! be creative ;), a small
financial donation will always be gladly accepted.

   I have thought about how to release this package for quite some time. My
initial thought went out to shareware but I soon forgot about this. Since most
of the libraries of this kind seem to be shareware I do not think that many
people like this simply because it's anoying to have to pay for a library if
you had to pay for the application as wel.

   To avoid these problems I have decided to release this package as giftware
for people writing freely distributable software. With "freely distributable
software" I mean non-crippeled, free of charge software. Authors who wish to
use @{b}BGUI@{ub} in shareware and/or commercial programs must pay for the usage of
@{b}BGUI@{ub} before actually using it.

   ShareWare and/or commercial usage is @{b}not@{ub} allowed without:

      1) Prior written permission from the author.
      2) A small finacial donation of US$ 20,-, DM 30,- or HFL 30,-.
      3) A free and registered copy of the product including free updates that
         still make use of the library.

   The idea behind this distribution policy is simple. You make money with the
aid of @{b}BGUI@{ub}? I want to get my (very humble) share.

   This software is not crippeled so when you register it you will not recieve
a key-file or an updated version. Registering simply buys you the right to use
this software in shareware and/or commercial applications.

   Resonable, eh?

Introduction
************

   @{b}BGUI@{ub} is a BOOPSI based shared library contaning a number of BOOPSI classes.
It allows for easy creation and managing of font sensitive and size adjustable
GUI's on the Amiga. Hmm, where have I read something like this before..., I
hear you say.

   YES! This is yet another GUI library. I know there has been a lot of
discussions about the usabillity and neccesity of GUI libraries on the nets
lately. Still, being the ignorant bugger that I am, at some point I felt it
was necessary to write yet another one.

   Believe me when I say that @{b}BGUI@{ub} was not intended to become a releasable
project. I started coding @{b}BGUI@{ub} simply because I was amazed what MUI did using
BOOPSI. Therefore I started coding some BOOPSI classes as a learning
experience.

   Hmmm... This is beginning to sound like an excuse... As if I did something
terrible ;)

   The point is that, while working on BGUI, I saw many GUI libraries being
released and not one of them really seemed to take off. This made me think
that all this talk about "For every app I run I need to install a different
GUI library" really is bull. Please correct me if I'm wrong but I have yet to
see a program requiring a GUI library (with the exception of MUI ofcourse).

   Sure there are a lot available but MUI is the only one which actually seems
to be used by the programmers.

   This is the reason for @{b}BGUI@{ub}. I have tryed to create a library which does
it's thing simular to MUI eliminating the biggest problems that programmers
seem to have with MUI. Meaning no fancy
background-pen-frame-text-image-whatever settings editor, not a zillion extra
images, no external class libraries etc.

   @{b}BGUI@{ub} is a single library which can be removed as easely as it can be
installed. It provides an easy way to create and control GUI's without becoming
excessive in what it does.

   I guess time will tell if @{b}BGUI@{ub} is going to be accepted or not...

Requirements
************

   @{b}BGUI@{ub} requires at least version 2.04 of the operating system. It does @{b}not@{ub}
run on 1.3 systems. Are there still people running 1.3?

   @{b}BGUI@{ub} also requires the following disk-based libraries to operate:

   @{b}*@{ub} gadtools.library		(V37)	(menus)

   @{b}*@{ub} asl.library		(V37)	(filereq class)

   @{b}*@{ub} commodities.library	(V37)	(commodities class)

   The following libraries are not required but they will impose on the
functionality of the library when not available:

   @{b}*@{ub} locale.library		(V38)	(localized library strings)

   @{b}*@{ub} amigaguide.library	(V37)	(On-line help)

   @{b}*@{ub} workbench.library         (V37)	(App-window support)

   It should not be a problem to use BGUI on a system with 512KByte but a
minimum of 1 Megabyte is suggested as a minimum.

Installation
************

   The installation of BGUI is very simple. You can either use the Installer
utility by C= which will install the library for you or you can copy the
@{b}bgui.library@{ub} to your LIBS: directory or into a directory you might have setup
for non-system libraries.

   Where you put the headers/modules for the language you use is up to you.
Since the different compilers and users use different directory structures I
did not supply a script for you to install these. You'll have to do this by
hand.

Read Me
*******

   @{b}*@{ub} The bgui.library is a special library in the sence that it is a single
     task library.  This means that @{b}every@{ub} task using the library must open the
     library for itself.  The library base pointer may @{b}not@{ub} be shared between
     different tasks.

     The reason for this is that the library tracks information like window
     bounds etc.  This tracking is done for each individual task.

     So if your code spawns a sub-task which needs the library, the sub-task
     code must open the library for itself. It may not share it with the main
     task.

   @{b}*@{ub} The object ID's (gadgets and menus) are restricted to the range 1..65535.
     ID's smaller or larger than this are not allowed. This should not be a
     problem :)

   @{b}*@{ub} When designing custom classes to work with BGUI please try to keep your
     tag values and method ID's well out of the range of the BGUI tag values
     and method ID's. Using values that conflict with the BGUI values may have
     unexpected results.

   @{b}*@{ub} Do not be alarmed when you notice disk-activity when a BGUI requester
     pops up. This is due to the fact that the bgui.library catalog file is
     re-loaded each time BGUI needs it. This makes sure that the language is
     correct if it changed.

   @{b}*@{ub} When scrolling a large listview the mouse pointer may move in steps
     rather than smoothly. This is not abnormal behaviour with BOOPSI objects
     because all rendering occures on the input device it's task. Just scroll
     a MultiView window with the scroller and you'll see the same effect.

   @{b}*@{ub} The BGUI windowclass depends on the IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY flag. This means
     that the responce to the signals you get have to be as quick as possible.
     If you need to use DOS routines or are unable to call uppon the
     windowclass event handler for a while you need to switch of the
     IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY dependance before you do and back on after you're done.
     There is a tag called WINDOW_NoVerify for this.

Keyboard & Mouse
****************

   Most of the BGUI gadget objects can be controlled by the keyboard. Usually
the key that is used to control an object is shown by an underlined character
in the object it's label. The objects can be controlled as follows:

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}Button@{ub} - Pressing the key will make the object appear pressed. If you
     release the key the object appears normal again and the application is
     signalled that the object was selected. When you accidentally activated
     the button you can press SHIFT or ESC before releasing the key to cancel
     the selection.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}Toggle Button@{ub} - Pressing the key will toggle the selected state of
     the toggle button.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}CheckBox@{ub} - Pressing the key will toggle the selected state of the
     checkbox object.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}Prop (Scroller)@{ub} - Pressing the key will advance the knob position by
     one page. When you press the key together with SHIFT the knob will backup
     one page. You can reset the knob position when you are dragging the knob
     with the mouse by clicking on the right mouse button.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}Listview@{ub} - Pressing the key will select the next entry in the list
     scrolling the entries when necessary. Pressing the key together with
     SHIFT will select the previous entry. Read only listview objects will
     simply scroll the list forward and backward.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}Cycle@{ub} - Pressing the key will cycle one choise forward. Pressing the
     key together with SHIFT will cycle one choise backward. Selecting the
     gadget with the mouse while holding down the SHIFT key will also make the
     gadget cycle backward. When the cycle gadget was setup to be a popup
     gadget by the application programmer you can click inside the label area
     to pop-up a menu from which you can select the desired item. You can
     recognize a popup gadget by the imagery left of the label area. Normal
     cycle gadgets have a circular arrow here and popup gadgets have a small
     menu here.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}Slider@{ub} - Pressing the key will advance the knob position by one.
     Pressing the key together with shift will decrease the knob position by
     one. You can reset the knob position when you are dragging the knob with
     the mouse by clicking to on the right mouse button.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}String,Integer@{ub} - Pressing the key will simply activate the gadget.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}Mx@{ub} - Pressing the key will select the next button skipping any
     disabled buttons. Pressing the key together with shift will select the
     previous button skipping any disabled buttons. If the Mx object is in
     tabs mode the choises will not stop at the last or first selection but
     instead it will cycle back to the start or the end.

   As you can see this behaviour is mostly style guide compliant with some
additional possibilities.

Future
******

   This is a list of known bugs and quirks. Please read this before you start
sending me bug reports and suggestions.

     @{b}BUG@{ub}  = A bug that is still present.
     @{b}SUG@{ub}  = A suggestion which might be implemented in the future.
     @{b}REV@{ub}  = Revision and/or fine-tuning that still needs to be done.
     @{b}MAY@{ub}  = Maybe...

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}BUG@{ub} - The layout engine locks up when, due to a bug or hacking, you
     re-size a window smaller than it's minimum as decided by BGUI. Reported
     by Florian Vorberger.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}BUG@{ub} - The infoclass screws up computing it's minimum dimensions when
     the last thing in the text is a command sequence. Should not be a real
     problem since it is bullshit to end a string with a command sequence.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}BUG@{ub} - There seem to be problems when using the textfield.gadget in a
     BGUI context.  The problem is that if you select an object while the
     textfield object is active you get a double message from the clicked
     object. I do not know why this is happening.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}REV@{ub} - @{b}BGUI@{ub} gadgets on intuition requesters is @{b}NOT@{ub} supported yet.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}REV@{ub} - The commodity class could use some cleaning up. I'm not really
     satisfied with it as it is.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}REV@{ub} - The format of the library and class documentation files suck. I
     should convert them to "real" autodoc format or amigaguide files.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}REV@{ub} - Error reporting. It's OK that a window failed to open or an
     object failed to create but it would be nice to know why. Both numeric
     and textual error descriptions should be made available.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}REV@{ub} - Adding method, conditional and hook notification to the window
     class to. This will allow notification to happen on the application task
     instead of the input.device task.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}REV@{ub} - Work on the menus. For now it is not possible to dynamically
     add items, add notification or help files to the menus. This really sucks.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}REV@{ub} - Try to cut down on the code size. Although, all things
     considering, BGUI is not excessive in size I'de like to see it smaller.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}MAY@{ub} - Letting the window backfill hook optionally make use of the
     preferred workbench window backfill pattern or picture.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}MAY@{ub} - Fonts and images in the info class.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}MAY@{ub} - Add a posibility to "snapshot" window sizes to disk. Should
     this be up to the application programmer? Suggested by Paul Weterings.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}MAY@{ub} - Take the layout engine of BGUI and make a seperate shared/link
     library out of it. This would result in a +/- 10 KByte shared/link
     library with the same functionality as the BGUI layout engine. Maybe this
     will satisfy those people who are always bitching and complaining about
     GUI engine libraries.
