Because of    the    simplicity   of  the  catalog  description  file  of  the
bgui.library I  have  translated  it  to all languages myself by exploring the
system catalog files.

Because I have no idea wether or not the translations are correct please check
and,  if you find an error ;),  fix it.  I would ofcource appreciate it if you
would send me the fixed version. Thanks in advance.
