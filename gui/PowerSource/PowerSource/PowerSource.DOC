                                I. OVERVIEW
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PowerSource  is  designed  to  save  the  Amiga  programmer a lot of time in
 creating intuition gadgets and menus.  This version  of  PowerSource has the
 following features:

    o - a complete intuition user interface.
    o - editing gadgets for a workbench or a custom screen.
    o - editing gadgets for a window or a requester.
    o - editing intuition menus.
    o - full control over the window flags.
    o - adding, modifying, moving and deleting texts for gadgets and window.
    o - adding, editing, moving, re-sizing, deleting and copying of gadgets.
    o - editing gadgets with the "WB 2.0" look.
    o - loading IFF-ILBM brushes as gadget rendering.
    o - a special "Image Bank" which holds all imaginary.
    o - loading IFF-ILBM colormaps for custom screens.
    o - a palette editor to create your own custom colours.
    o - title line gadget information.
    o - fully mouse and keyboard controlled.
    o - generation of source code in C or Assembler.
    o - generation of Assembler source which does not need the intuition
        headers to assemble.
    o - generation of static data & structures in C.
    o - binary saving for later loading and editing.
    o - Images are shared and can be used by multiple gadgets while only once
        in memory and in the generated source.
    o - borders are shared  and can  be used by  multiple gadgets  while only
        once in memory and in the generated source.
    o - full control over the generated source labels.
    o - etc. etc. etc. etc............

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           II. REQUIREMENTS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PowerSource was programmed in Aztec C V5.0a on an  Amiga 2000 Kick 1.3  with
 5 Meg memory and a  52Meg HardDisk +  A2630 Accelerator card  (I've upgraded
 a little....). Since the program has grown  into 138 KByte  and I don't have
 access to a 512 KByte machine I could not test it on a mere 512k machine but
 I don't think it should give to much problems. What you do need to work with
 PowerSource is a C  Compiler (try registering DICE...)  and/or  an Assembler
 with all the standard include files. PowerSource  also  requires  a  copy of
 the "tool.library",  which is also on this disk, to be copied into the LIBS:
 directory of the PowerSource  boot disk.  This  program is  tested  with the
 NTSC-PAL program by Nico François (FISH 387) in NTSC mode and it ran fine so
 it should not  give any problems on  NTSC machines  unless you try to load a
 PS file that contains a window out of  NTSC limits.  Also  some testing  has
 been done with Kickstart 2.0 and it ran fine.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         III. STARTING POWERSOURCE
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PowerSource can be run from the CLI or the workbench. If you run PowerSource
 from the workbench all you have to do is double-click the "PowerSource" icon
 or one of the "PS" icons.  If you want to run PowerSource from the CLI  just
 type "PowerSource [filename]" where "filename" is an  optional  name of  the
 "PS" file you want to edit. When you have started PowerSource without a file
 name a little window opens in the  middle of the  screen with  the following
 gadgets:

    WINDOW      - selecting this gadget tells PowerSource that you want to
                  edit gadgets for a window.
    REQUESTER   - selecting this gadget tells PowerSource that you want to
                  edit gadgets for a requester.
    1           - custom screen, depth = 1, 2  colors.
    2           - custom screen, depth = 2, 4  colors.
    3           - custom screen, depth = 3, 8  colors.
    4           - custom screen, depth = 4, 16 colors. (SLOWS UP THE 68000)
    5           - custom screen, depth = 5, 32 colors.
    WORKBENCH   - if you select this gadget PowerSource still opens it's own
                  screen  but the colors are the same as your workbench and
                  the generated structures will be for the workbench screen.

 When you are done click "OK"  and a screen opens with a little window on it.
 If you click on "CANCEL" you leave the program again.

 NOTE:  If you have  selected to edit gadgets for a  requester you will see a
        window with a colored rectangle in it.  This rectangle represents the
        requester you are working on.  You can size and  position the  window
        in order to get the requester how and where you want it.

 Now let's create our first gadget.  Move the mouse pointer to where you want
 the top-left corner of  the gadget  to be and  click the left  mouse button.
 If you look at the screen title now you will see some information displayed.
 This information means, from left to right:

    o - the mouse pointer X coordinate.
    o - the mouse pointer Y coordinate.
    o - the gadget left edge.
    o - the gadget top edge.
    o - the gadget width.
    o - the gadget height.

 NOTE: The values are relative to the top-left corner of the window/requester
       This  information  is important to place  and size your gadget exactly
       the way it should be.

 If you move the mouse pointer the values in  the info-line will change and a
 box will follow the mouse pointer  relative to the top-left corner. This box
 represents the gadget. When the box is the way you want the gadget to be you
 must click the left mouse button  again and the  gadget will be added to the
 window or requester. Now you have created your first gadget with PowerSource
 so let's take a look at the menus to see what else you can do.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           IV. THE PROJECT MENU
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This menu consists of the following items:

 About:    <right Amiga ?>

 Function: display  information about  the  copyright,  the  author  and  the
           memory available.  Just click on the CONTINUE gadget to get rid of
           it.

 New:      <right Amiga N>

 Function: erases all gadgets and changes made  sofar and resets  the display
           to the default.  If the changes  made where  not saved a requester
           opens  telling you  this and asking  you if you really  want to do
           this. Click on the NO gadget if you made a mistake by calling this
           function otherwise click on the YES gadget. Also you will be asked
           If you want the images,  if there are any,  to be erased  from the
           Image Bank. Also  it is possible  to change the  edit screen depth
           with  the  "Please select"  window you have seen  when PowerSource
           started.
           NOTE: If you proceed  with this function and the changes where not
                 saved there is no way to get back the information.

 Load:     <right Amiga L>

 Function: This opens the file requester. In this file requester you can type
           or select the name of the 'PS' file you want to load.
           NOTE: The program only loads 'PS' files. If you try to load a file
                 that is not a 'PS' file a requester appears telling you that
                 the file you have selected  was of an  Unknown type.

           When the file you have selected is successfully loaded. The screen
           displays now displays the gadgets e.c.t. found in the file.

 Save:     <right Amiga S>

 Function: This opens the file  requester in  which you can  type or select a
           name under which the  current display  is saved. You should always
           save  the display  before you exit  the program.  This ensures the
           file is  always up to date.  If you do not save the display before
           quitting  the program  any changes  made since  the last  time you
           saved will be lost.

 Generate Source:
 C:        <right Amiga C>

 Function: This generates the source code in C of the  display  edited sofar.
           A requester pops up showing the following gadgets:

                WINDOW          - Select this one if you  want the  window or
                                  requester  to  be included  in  the  source
                                  generation.
                SCREEN          - Select this one if you  want the  screen to
                                  be included in the source generation.
                COLORS          - Select  this  one  if you  want the  screen
                                  colors  to  be   included  in  the   source
                                  generation. ( This  has  only  effect  when
                                  generating source of custom screens! )
                RENDER TEXTS    - Select this one if  you want the  window or
                                  requester  texts  to  be  included  in  the
                                  source generation.
                BORDER ONLY     - Select this one if you want the border only
                                  gadgets  to  be  included  in  the   source
                                  generation.
                SPECIAL GADGET  - Select this  one if  you want  the  special
                                  gadget  (See THE GENERATED SOURCE.)  to  be
                                  included in the source generation.
                SPECIAL INFO    - Select this one if you want the information
                                  (See THE GENERATED SOURCE.) to  be included
                                  in the source generation.
                GADGETS         - Select this one if you want the  gadgets to
                                  be included in the source generation.
                MENUS           - Select this on if you want the  menus to be
                                  included in the source generation.

           By default  all  gadgets  are  switched on  so just  click on  the
           gadgets you do not want generated and click OK. Clicking  CANCEL
           will abort the operation.

           In the file requester you can type or select the name  under which
           the generated source code is saved.

 Assembler:  <right Amiga A>

 Function: As with C only the generated source code is in MC68000 Assembler.


 Preferences: <right Amiga P>

 Function: This is used to (un)set certain preferred  program flags. It opens
           a window with the following gadgets:

  Skip zero bit-planes     : This  tells   PowerSource  to  skip  any   image
                             bitplanes that only  contains zero's.  This will
                             reduce  the  size  of  the   image  data  source
                             PowerSource generates.
  Auto Gadget -> Image size: This  tells PowerSource to  automatically adjust
                             the dimensions of the  gadget to the  dimensions
                             of the loaded image.
  Image Copy               : This tells PowerSource  to  also copy any images
                             that might be attached to a gadget.
  Text Copy                : This tells PowerSource  to  also copy any  texts
                             that might be attached to a gadget.
  Static Structures        : This tells PowerSource to generate "static" data
                             and structures if C source is generated.
  RAW Assembler Source     : This  tells  PowerSource  to   generate  numbers
                             instead  of  standard  intuition  names for  the
                             flags, etc. when assembler source is  generated.
                             This makes it possible to assemble the generated
                             source without having  to  include the intuition
                             headers.
  OS 2.0 HighBorder        : This tells PowerSource to also create a selected
                             Border for OS 2.0 bordered  gadgets.  This  will
                             give the gadgets a "recessed" look when they are
                             selected.  This   one  was   suggested  by  Yves
                             Perrenoud.
  Coordinates              : The sets up  PowerSource  to display  the mouse
                             coordinates in the screen title bar.  NOTE : The
                             coordinates displayed are relative to the window
                             it's  top-left  corner!  Also when  editing on a
                             lo-res screen the  coordinates can  screw up the
                             menus! Again suggested  by Yves Perrenoud
  WINDOW or REQUESTER      : Switch  from editing  gadgets  for  a window  to
                             editing gadgets for a requester or viceversa.
  Save                     : Save the preferences to a file called
                             'DEVS:PowerSource.PREFS'.
  Use                      : Set the preferences in the program.
  Save & Use               : Both save and set these preferences.


 Close WorkBench or
 Open  WorkBench:   <right Amiga W>

 Function: This enables you to close/open the workbench screen. You can close
           the  workbench screen  if your  (!!computer!!) memory is running a
           little low.
           NOTE: It's only possible  to close the  workbench screen  if there
                 are no programs running that use the workbench screen.  This
                 means that if you  started PowerSource from  the  CLI  it is
                 not possible to close  the workbench  screen because the CLI
                 is a program that makes use of the workbench screen.

 Quit:     <right Amiga Q>

 Function: Quits  PowerSource  if you select YES in the requester that opened
           to ask you to if you really want to do this.


 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           V. THE GADGETS MENU
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In this menu  a lot of functions are defined which asks you to pick a gadget
 to perform a  certain action.  If you  accidentally  activated one  of these
 functions you can press the 'ESC' key  instead of selecting a gadget to exit
 that function.

 The following items are defined in this menu:

 Move a gadget:   <F1>

 Function: When 'Move a gadget' is selected the message 'PICK GADGET TO MOVE'
           is displayed in the screen title bar.  Now click on the gadget you
           want to move  and the title  will display  the information  of the
           selected gadget. Now move the box which represents the gadget with
           the mouse to it's  new location and click on the left mouse button
           and the gadget is moved to the new location.

 Size a gadget:   <F2>

 Function: When the  message 'PICK GADGET TO RE-SIZE'  is displayed  you  can
           click  on the  gadget  you  want  to  re-size.  Again  the  gadget
           information is displayed in the screen title.  Now move  the mouse
           pointer to size the box until it has the size you want  the gadget
           to be. Just click the left mouse button and the gadget is resized.
           NOTE: When the gadget  has a shared  border all gadgets  which use
                 the same border are equally resized!

 Copy a gadget:   <F3>

 Function: This function enables  you to make  a copy of  a gadget.  Once the
           message 'PICK GADGET TO COPY'  is  displayed  you can click on the
           gadget you want to copy.  If  the gadget  has Images  and/or texts
           attached to it and 'Image Copy' and/or 'Text Copy' was switched on
           in the preferences window these  images and/or texts will  also be
           copied. Otherwise the copied gadget  will have a  border as gadget
           render  and no  texts.  Move the  box representing the copy to the
           location you want it and  click the left  mouse button.  Copying a
           gadget which has a  border attached  to it will share  it's border
           with the created copy of the gadget. NOTE: BORDERONLY  gadgets and
           NOBORDER gadgets do NOT share the borders! Also the borders cannot
           be shared between BOOLEAN and STRING gadgets. So a  BOOLEAN gadget
           only shares it's border with another BOOLEAN  gadget and  a STRING
           gadget only shares it's border with another STRING gadget.

 Delete a gadget: <F4>

 Function: When the  message  'PICK GADGET TO DELETE'  is  displayed  you can
           click on the gadget you want to delete and it's gone.
           NOTE: Once the gadget is deleted there is no turning back.

 Edit a gadget:   <F5>

 Function: This function enables you to edit the complete set of gadget flags
           intuition  has to offer  and some  other  special things. When the
           message 'PICK GADGET TO EDIT' is displayed in the screen title you
           can click on  the gadget  to edit. Now a window is opened with the
           following gadgets in it:

   Under FLAGS:

    GADGHNONE    - nothing happens with the gadget when it is selected.
    GADGHCOMP    - the  gadget  hitbox  is displayed  complemented  when  the
                   gadget is selected.
    GADGHBOX     - a box is drawed around the gadget when it is selected.
    GRELBOTTOM   - the  gadget  top edge  is relative  to  the  bottom of the
                   window.
    GRELRIGHT    - the  gadget left edge  is relative  to  the  right  of the
                   window.
    GRELWIDTH    - the gadget width is relative to the window width.
    GRELHEIGHT   - the gadget height is relative to the window height.
    SELECTED     - the gadget is displayed in selected mode.
    GADGDISABLED - the gadget cannot be selected.  This flag will only be set
                   in the source code.

   Under ACTIVATION:

    TOGGLESELECT  - the gadget can switched  to selected  mode by clicking on
                    it and to unselected mode by clicking on it again.
    RELVERIFY     - intuition  waits to  send a  message until the left mouse

                 no images attached to it.
  OS2BORDER    - this is a special flag not  defined by  intuition  but it is
                 used  to tell  PowerSource to  put  a "WB 2.0" border around
                 the gadget. This gives the impression, if the WB 2.0  colors
                 are set, that the gadget is recessed.

 When you are editing gadgets for a window two items are displayed:

 Edit Flags:     <right Amiga F>

 Function: This will  bring up  a window  in which  all  the intuition window
           Flags are displayed:

  WINDOWSIZING    - the window sizing gadget is included.
  WINDOWDRAG      - the window can be dragged around with the title bar.
  WINDOWDEPTH     - the window can be put on top or below another window.
  WINDOWCLOSE     - the close window gadget is included.
  SIZEBRIGHT      - the sizing gadget is placed in the right window border.
  SIZEBBOTTOM     - the sizing gadget is placed in the bottom window border.
  NOCAREREFRESH   - intuition  does not  send a  message to  the window  if a
                    refresh is necessary.
  SIMPLE_REFRESH  - intuition  does no  refreshing  at all.  the program must
                    refresh the window itself when necessary.

                    than the window itself.
  BACKDROP        - the window is always behind all other windows.
  GIMMEZERZERO    - the window border is handled extra.  You  should  NOT put
                    gadgets in the  window border  of a GIMMEZEROZERO  window
                    without  setting the  GZZGADGET  flag in the  gadget  its
                    activation  field.  Also  you should  not  put  texts  or
                    BORDERONLY gadgets in the window border because when  the
                    generated  source is  assembled/compiled  these won't  or
                    only partly show.
  BORDERLESS      - the window border is not displayed.

  Selecting CANCEL will prevent the changes to be set. OK sets the changes in
  the flags e.c.t. and will resume editing.

 Set BackFill:     <right Amiga B>

 Function: This  enables you to set  the backfill color of the window. I have
           made this  function available  since I  use windows  with  another
           backfill color than  color 0 a lot.  Maybe you do to (?).  You can
           use a routine similar to the following to use this window backfill
           color in your program:

 void WindowBackFill(struct Window *window)
 {
    SetAPen(window->RPort,WDBACKFILL);
    RectFill(window->RPort,window->LeftEdge+window->BorderLeft,
                           window->TopEdge+window->BorderTop,
                           window->Width-window->BorderLeft,
                           window->Height-3);
    RefreshGList(window->FirstGadget,window,NULL,-1L);
 }
           The color used is set by the BPen menu (see THE FPEN & BPEN MENUS)

 When you are editing gadgets for a requester:

 Set BackFill:     <right Amiga B>

           a list. Selecting the menu you want to edit  items for  will setup
           a new menustrip which will be explained below.

 Test Menus:    <right Amiga T>

 Function: This will test the menus you have  edited sofar.  After  selecting
           this you can browse through the menus using the right mouse button
           Pressing ESC will terminate the test.

 Gadgets Menu:  <right Amiga G>

 Function: This simply returns you to gadget editing.

 THE ITEMS MENU

 Add item:      <right Amiga A>

 Function: This opens the Edit Item window in which the following gadgets can
           be found:

                HIGHCOMP    - This  tells  intuition  to  complement the item
                              when the pointer is on it.
                HIGHBOX     - This tells intuition to draw a box  around the
                              item when the pointer is on it.
                HIGHNONE    - This tells  intuition not  to change  the  item
                              when the pointer is on it.
                COMMSEQ     - This enables  the user  to use a  shortcut  key
                              instead of selecting this item.
                CHECKED     - This tells intuition  to draw a  little hook in
                              the item when it is selected.
                CHECKIT     - This tells intuition to  draw a little  hook in
                              in the item.
                MENUTOGGLE  - This toggles the little hook each time the item
                              has been selected.
                ITEMENABLED - This enables the item (makes it selectable).
                COMMAND KEY - The shortcut key (See COMMSEQ).  This pops up a
                              requester  when you  enter a command  key which
                              is already used on another item.
                ITEM TEXT   - The name of the item.
                AUTO FORMAT - See "Add a menu"
                JAM1        - the drawmode of the item text. Switches between
                              JAM1, JAM2, COMPLEMENT and INVERVID.
                LEFT        - See "Add a menu"

                HEIGHT      - See "Add a menu"
                OK          - This will append the edited item to the list.
                CANCEL      - This will cancel the operation.

 Edit item:

 Function: Attached to this menu  you  see all items you have edited sofar in
           a list. Selecting the item  you want will  bring up the  Item Edit
           window in which you can edit the item.  This item  will be  off if
           no items are defined.

 Delete item:

 Function: Attached to this menu  you  see all items you have edited sofar in
           a  list.  Selecting  the  item  you  want to  delete  brings  up a
           requester in which you will  be asked if  you are sure.  Selecting
           YES will delete the item and NO will cancel the delete.  This item
           will be off if no items are defined.

 Insert item before:

 Function: Attached to this menu  you  see all items you have edited sofar in
           a list. Selecting the item you  want to  insert a new  item BEFORE
           will bring up the Item Edit window in which you can edit the item.
           This item will be off if no items are defined.

 Edit subitems for:

 Function: Attached to this menu  you  see all items you have edited sofar in
           a list. Selecting the item  you  want  to  edit  subitems for will
           setup a new menustrip which will be explained below.

 Main Menu:     <right Amiga M>

 Function: This brings you back to the menu editing menu.

 Set MutualExclude: <right Amiga E>

 Function: To setup an item to exclude other items. Selecting  this menu will
           ask you to pick the item that should do  the excluding.  Now press
           the right mouse button and select the item that you want.  Now you
           will  be  asked to  drag-select  the items  you want  excluded. By
           drag-selecting is ment that you should keep the right mouse button
           down while you press the left mouse button  on each item  you want
           to exclude. Release the right mouse button once the last  item has
           been selected.

 THE SUBITEMS MENU

 The first four and the last two items in this menu do the same as  with  the
 items  in  the  "Items" menu  but  instead  of editing  items you  will edit
 subitems.

 The only item that different is the following:

 Item Menu:     <right Amiga I>

 Function: This will put you back to the Items menu.


 Now there is also a command not specified in the menus. Pressing the '*' key
 on the numeric keypad will dump the window you are working on to the printer
 It uses the printer.device so make sure that  you have set it up  correctly.
 When you press the '\' key (just left of the backspace key) PowerSource will
 print all ID's of the gadgets created sofar.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       VI. THE FPEN AND BPEN MENUS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When one of these two  menus are selected  you will see a row of 2,4,8,16 or
 32 (depending on the screen depth) colored items.  These items represent the
 colors of the edit screen. With the items in the  FPen menu you  can set the
 active FrontPen color. All gadgets added  will have a  border in this  color
 and all texts  added will  have this  color as  the FrontPen color. With the
 items in the BPen menu you can set the active BackPen color. All texts added
 will have this color as the BackPen color.  The active BackPen color is also
 used to set the BackFill color of  the requester.  The colors  selected  are
 also used to set the OS 2 Border colors. (see "OS-2 Border colors")

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     VII. THE GENERATED SOURCE CODE
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following definitions are made at the end of the generated source:

 NEWWINDOW or REQUESTER - a pointer to the NewWindow or Requester structure.

 If you have edited some gadgets:

 FIRSTGADGET            - a pointer to the first gadget in the list.

 If there where texts added to the window or requester:

 FIRSTTEXT              - a pointer to the first text in the list.

 If there where 'BORDERONLY' gadgets defined:

 FIRSTBORDER            - a pointer to the first border in the list.

 If you have edited gadgets for on a custom screen:

 NEWSCREEN              - a pointer to the NewScreen structure.
 COLORCOUNT             - the number of colors in the screen.
 An array of USHORT values containing  the colors  which  where  on  the edit
 screen. These colors can be set by a simple LoadRGB4() call.

 If you have edited gadgets for a window:

 WDBACKFILL             - the window backfill color used while editing.

 If you have edited menus:

 FIRSTMENU              - the first menu in the strip.

 If you  have edited gadgets for a  window and you have attached texts and/or
 'BORDERONLY' gadgets to the window  a special gadget is placed at the end of
 the gadgetlist. This gadget is only there  to draw the borders and the texts
 when the window is opened or when the gadgets are refreshed.

 The GadgetID's are defined as following: Label_ID
 This means that if you, for example, added a gadget with the label "UP" than
 "UP_ID" will represents this gadget it's ID.

 The best way to see what the source looks like is to create some gadgets and
 let PowerSource generate the source and then look at it. Basically  all  you
 need to remember are the labels you give  your gadgets  to be able to access
 all of the structures etc. that are linked to these gadgets.  I don't really
 know if the generated C source compiles under lattice , I don't have lattice
 , but it should give no problems whatsoever.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          VIII. THE IMAGE BANK
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The Image Bank is designed to use a single  Image on several  gadgets at the
 same time. This has two very big advantages.  One, There  will  be  only one
 copy of the Image in memory, and Two, The generated source will only contain
 the Image once. You can see this saves a lot of memory (and disk space).

 The Image Bank window contains 6 or 7 depending on how  you called it.  When
 you called it using the <TAB> key  or the  "Image Bank"  Item the  following
 gadgets are in the window:

        Load       -) This will put  up the  FileRequester  in which  you can
                      select the name of an IFF ILBM file you  want to  load.
                      If the loading  went  OK the  window now  displays  the
                      Image or, when it's to big, part of it. The  colors  of
                      the image are set on the screen. Everytime  you load an
                      Image  it  will be  appended  to the  already  existing
                      images.

        Remove     -) This will remove the Image currently in  the Image Bank
                      window from the Image Bank  deallocating  the memory it
                      takes up. If the Image still  has gadgets  which use it
                      a message will be displayed  telling  you this  and the
                      image will not be removed.

        NEXT       -) This will display the next image and it's colors. If no
                      next image  exists in  the Image Bank  the screen  will
                      flash.

        PREV       -) This will display the previous image  and it's  colors.
                      If no previous image exits in the Image Bank the screen
                      will flash.

        CONTINUE   -) This will continue the editing.

 When you called the Image Bank by pressing <F7> or <F8> or by  selecting the
 "Get Gadget Image" or "Get Select Image" items the  first four  gadgets will
 be the same as above. Then two new gadgets are displayed:

        OK         -) This will select the image currently on the  Image Bank
                      window. Then a requester pops up asking you if you want
                      to use the colors of the Image.  Select  "YES"  if  you
                      want this and "NO" if not.

        CANCEL     -) This will cancel the operation and resume to editing.

 The Image Bank uses a simple checksum routine which should detect  it if you
 try to load the same image twice. The checksum routine is very simple and it
 could be that two images have the same checksum.  Therefore a requester pops
 up telling you that the image you  tryed to load is already in the  bank and
 then asking you if you want to keep it. When you want to keep the image just
 click on YES otherwise click on NO.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               IX. COMPILING
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If you have the make utility type:

  make pre ged

 Otherwise compile the "defs.h" file with  the "-ho defs.pre"  option and all
 other files with the "-so -hi defs.pre" options and then link them together.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                X. HISTORY
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 VERSION    1.0     -> Let's not talk about this!

 VERSION    2.0     -> First release, let's see how it goes.

 VERSION    2.2a    -> The  generated window  source  now reads  NULL at  the
                       place of the window title if the title was empty.

                       The gadgets  on the  window  won't  interfere with the
                       placing  of  texts  and   gadgets  in  the  window  or
                       requester  anymore.

                       Binary file  structure  expanded.  Version 2.0  binary
                       files must first be patched  before GadgetED  2.2a and
                       up can read  them.

                       Added "Static Structures"  switch  in  the preferences
                       window to enable to  generate  static C  source  code.

                       Added  the  NOBORDER  switch to disable the generating
                       of gadget border source.

                       Added  the  "Text Copy"  switch to  enable to copy any
                       text attached to a gadget also.

                       Resolved a bug in "tsel.c" which gurud if more than 10
                       texts  where in  the "text selector"  and the prop was
                       used.  It worked  fine  when I  first  programmed this
                       function with the Aztec C version 3.6a compiler ?

                       Added the possibility to set  your own window backfill
                       color.

                       Added  the "RAW Assembler Source" switch to be able to
                       assemble the generated assembler source without having
                       to include the intuition headers.

                       Added  OS-2.0  colored borders.  This was suggested by
                       Jan Geißler. Thanks Jan!

                       Workbench  usage only  worked  when  both the  GE file
                       and  the   GadgetED  executable   where  in  the  same
                       directory, this is now fixed.

                       GadgetED locked  up the  system if the  "tool.library"
                       wasn't found. This is now fixed. (I forgot a simple if
                       statement!)

 VERSION 2.3        -> Fixed  a bug  that  caused  generating faulty C source
                       with gadgets that have multiple texts.

                       Fixed a bug in the  palette requester which  gurud  on
                       LoRes screens.

                       Fixed the source generator to generate correct  source
                       of GIMMEZEROZERO windows and GZZGADGETS (I hope...)

                       Added  the  posibility  to  set  the  colors of OS 2.0
                       colored borders.

                       GadgetED now defaults to Workbench screen editing if a
                       file could not be loaded upon startup.

                       Source  generator  now generates  "V_HIRES" instead of
                       "HIRES" when assembler source for hires custom screens
                       is generated.

 VERSION 2.4        -> 2.3 could edit or  load colors  on a workbench  screen
                       using keyboard shortcuts. This has been removed.

                       GadgetED  still  crashed if  the correct  tool.library
                       was not found. This is now FIXED.

                       Fixed a very minor bug in the Gadget numbering. Thanks
                       Yves.

                       Fixed a  bug in the  Edit Gadget  screen which  caused
                       some gadgets to switch off  never  to be  switched  on
                       again. Thanks Yves.

                       Automatic sizing of  OS 2  bordered grel  gadgets  was
                       really screwed up. This is now fixed.

                       Added "OS 2.0 HighBorder"  switch in  the  preferences
                       window. Suggested by Yves Perrenoud.

                       Re-Sizing a gadget with an Image attached to it gurud.
                       This has been fixed.

 VERSION 2.5        -> Added  "Image Bank"  to  save  memory  and to generate
                       smaller  image  source.  This  also  caused  a radical
                       change in the binary file structure.  You  must  patch
                       pre-2.5 binary file with PatchGE version 2.0 first!

                       Added  "Free CHIP:" and  "Free FAST:"  in the  "About"
                       window.

                       Added the "Image Bank" menu item.

                       Added  coordinates when  placing texts.  Suggested  by
                       Yves Perrenoud.

                       Added automatic centering of Gadget Text's.  Suggested
                       by Yves Perrenoud.

                       Removed a bug in the  OS 2.0 HighBorder  routine which
                       could crash the machine.

                       Added the possibility  to dump the  current window  to
                       the printer.

 VERSION 3.0        -> CHANGED THE  NAME TO  PowerSource  BECAUSE  SINCE  THE
                       PROGRAM IS ABLE TO EDIT MENUS  THE NAME  GadgetEd  DID
                       NOT SEEM TO BE RIGHT!!!

                       Added a big new feature.... Menu Editing!

                       Added the possibility to change the screen  resolution
                       when new is called.

                       Added the possibility to determine what source will be
                       generated and what source will not.

                       Added  hotkeys  to  almost  every  menu  for  all  you
                       keyboard freaks out there. (Now why  would a  keyboard
                       freak want to use this program.......?????)

                       GadgetED 2.5 crashed when the OS 2.0 HighBorder option
                       was on and a BORDERONLY gadget was created.  This  has
                       been fixed.

                       Changed  the  refresh  routine which  could crash  the
                       Amiga when the window is resized during a refresh.

                       A little bug from the  2.5 beta  version which  caused
                       the gadgets not to be putten back on the window  after
                       deleting a text has been fixed.

                       The text selector won't  pop up  anymore if  only  one
                       text is available.

                       The IntuiText editor would not cancel the operation if
                       OK was selected without having typed in the text which
                       resulted in a guru. This has been fixed.

                       The 2.5 beta  version of GadgetED  would  not  free  a
                       considerable amount  of memory  upon exit.  This  has
                       been fixed.

                       Added the possibility to dump the  edit window  to the
                       printer. (bullshit...???)

                       The maxchars of string gadgets would stick on the last
                       one entered in the Edit Gadget screen. This  has  been
                       fixed.

                       The binary files now have a  new icon which  (I think)
                       looks much better on WB 2.0

                       The Window  backfill routine  now looks  a lot  better
                       running under OS 2.0.

                       The  "DriPens"  which  give  the  OS 2.0  windows that
                       special look are now set when running under OS 2.0.

                       Copying a gadget gave a false  width indicator  on the
                       title bar information.

                       Added a simple checksum in the image bank which should
                       detect it when the user  try's to load the  same image
                       twice.

                       Changed the source code generator so it won't generate
                       C source that gives warnings with DICE.

                       Added optional coordinates. Idea by Yves Perrenoud.

                       Added a source label  requester for labels  which used
                       to be set by the program.

                       PowerSource now knows when one try's to  load a binary
                       which it cannot read.

                       PowerSource now uses  border  sharing.  Idea  by  Yves
                       Perrenoud.

                       Added the possibility to print the ID's of all gadgets
                       created.

                       Added text centering in the window/requester.

                       Removed a bug wich caused a crash when  selecting New.
                       The FirstGadget  pointer  of the  NewWindow  structure
                       pointed to non-existing data.

                       Changed back the Edit Gadget screen from two colors to
                       four colors by  special request of  Yves perrenoud. It
                       looks better  but takes up  slightly more memory  when
                       open.

                                XI. FUTURE
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Here are some things which I plan for future versions of PowerSource:

    o   When OS 2.0 is burned into ROM PowerSource should be able to generate
        and edit gadtools menus and gadgets.

    o   Also when OS 2.0 is burned into ROM a separate source generator is to
        be made which generates  source according  to the new  intuition flag
        names.

    o   If requested enough by the  users of this program  PowerSource should
        enable image rendering for the menus. How many programs use this.....

    o   Please give me some ideas.....

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You'll have to excuse me for the way the source looks but I merly do this as
 hobby so I'm  not really very  effective in the way  I handle things  in the
 program. Since a lot  of new features are included in this version there are
 bound to be new bugs also so if you find bugs, I bet you will, or  you  have
 ideas to make the program more user-friendly, please   report to  me  at the
 following address (I  will  try to  implement all reasonable suggestions you
 give me):
