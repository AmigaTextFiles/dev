    Some of you might know this program as GadgetED but since Iv'e added
    menu editing the name just didn't seem right anymore so  it has been
    changed to PowerSource. Or should it perhaps be  MEGASource  (as  in
    MEnu-GAdget )?????  Also  the GadgetED  binaries  cannot be  read by
    PowerSource  (no  new  PatchGE).  I  probably  could  write  a patch
    program  to  do  this  but  the patched  file  would  not take  full
    advantage of the new "rendering sharing" of PowerSource.

    The tool.library supplied  with this version  of PowerSource  has an
    ugly bug fixed (the filerequester crashed under OS 2.0)  and  it has
    the possibility to  double-click  filenames  to select them.  If you
    want the source  just  send me  a disk  and  return  postage  (don't
    forget!!!) and I will mail it to you.

    As of this writing I still don't have write access  to Fidonet so if
    you send me a bug report or suggestion via Fidonet  you'll  probably
    get an anwser through regular mail.
