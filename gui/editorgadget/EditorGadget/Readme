Readme for EditorClass
**********************

May 17, 1994

I should tell you where some things are.  First, the docs for the
gadget are in the Docs drawer.  There is both an autodoc file and
an amigaguide file (converted with a cool adtoht tool).  The source
to the TestEditor program is in the Source drawer, along with all
the files necessary to compile it with SAS/C 6.50 or greater.  The
Gadgets drawer contains the actual "editor.gadget" file.  And, the
Include drawer can be copied to include: to put all the necessary
header files in their places (gadgets/editor.h, proto/editor.h,
and pragmas/editor_pragmas.h).

The EditorAuto.c file mentioned in the autodocs is found in the
Source drawer.  And the license contains fairly relevant information
on how I want this archive and the gadget distributed.

And last, I need to explain that this gadget was mentioned a long
time ago on Usenet, but the wait to releae it was mainly in waiting
for CATS getting back to me with a public class name.  Well they
never did, so after some discussion on Usenet someone (what's your
name?) made the GetClass() suggestion for obtaining a pointer to
the class.  Although it's not as simple as just using a public name,
it does have the advantage of being a bit faster in the case that
you might create instances fairly often.  And at the same time, I
wrote the autoinit/term functions to make the library open/closing
hidden which makes everything about the same anyway.

Oh, and some of the waiting was due to school.

Please remember to send me any comments or bug reports.
