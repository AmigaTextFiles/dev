   NAME
      textlabel.image -- text labels with underscore support

   SUPERCLASS
      imageclass

   DESCRIPTION
      The textlabel.image class is used to create gadget labels.
      For denoting the keyboard shortcut, a single charakter may be
      underlined.  Further a textlabel image may render itself
      relativly to a gadget or image.

   METHODS
      OM_NEW  -- Create the text label.  Passed to superclass, then OM_SET.

      OM_SET  -- Set object attributes.  Passed to superclass first.

      OM_GET  -- Get object attributes.  Passed to superclass first.

      IM_DRAW -- Draw the text label. Overrides the superclass.

      IM_FRAMEBOX -- Ask dimensions for framing a certain area. (V2)
                     Overrides the superclass.

      IM_DRAWFRAME -- Draw text label within a frame.  Overrides the
                      superclass.

      IM_HITTEST
      IM_HITFRAME -- Test whether point is within the image's
                     bounds.

      All other methods are passed to the superclass, including
      OM_DISPOSE.

   ATTRIBUTES
      TLA_Left  ( SHORT, ISG )
      TLA_Top   ( SHORT, ISG )
          These attributes correspond to similarly named fields in
          the Intuition Image structure.  Spezifying TLA_GADGET or
          TLA_IMAGE overwrites this attributes.

      TLA_Width   ( SHORT, G )
      TLA_Height  ( SHORT, G )
          These attributes correspond to similarly named fields in
          the Intuition Image structure.  This fields are filled
          with the dimensions determined from TLA_TEXT and
          TLA_GADGET (or TLA_IMAGE respectivly) if given.

      TLA_Text  ( STRPTR, IS )
          Label text.  The image's width and height were set to the
          extentsion of this text when rendered in the spezified
          font.

      TLA_Gadget  ( struct Gadget *, IS, V2 )
          Be a label for this gadget.  Specifying this attribute
          will change the behaviour of IM_DRAW to work like a
          sequence of of IM_FRAMEBOX and IM_DRAWFRAME.  See IM_DRAW
          and IM_SET for further information.

      TLA_Image  ( struct IMAGE *, IS, V2 )
          Be a label for this image.  Same as TLA_GADGET but for
          Images.

      TLA_Underscore  ( CHAR, IS )
          Charakter to be used to determine the underscore position
          within the string.  The charakter following the first
          occurance of this one will become the shortcut.
          Default: "_" (underscore).

      TLA_Key  ( CHAR, G )
          The shortcut key of this label.

      TLA_Adjustment  ( BYTEBITS, IS )
          Defines the adjustment for IM_DRAWFRAME.  See there for
          further information.  This effects only IM_DRAWFRAME.
          Default: center both vertical and horizontal.

      TLA_Font  ( struct TextFont *, ISG )
          Font to be used for rendering.

      TLA_DrawInfo  ( struct DrawInfo *, IS )
          When not using TLA_FONT, pass here the DrawInfo of the
          target screen. This ensures correct calculation of the
          label's dimensions.

      TLA_Mode   ( UBYTE, IS )
          Drawing mode to be used when rendering the text.

      TLA_FGPen  ( UBYTE, IS )
      TLA_BGPen  ( UBYTE, IS )
          Pen numbers to be used as foreground and background pens.
          Defaults to BLOCKPEN and BACKGROUNDPEN.

   NOTE
      As documented in V1 some attributes are just aliases for
      Intuition image attributes. To avoid confusion, the original
      names have been removed from the list above.

   BUGS
      Kerning arround the underscore may not work propperly.

      In V1 TLA_Text was documented as "getable", but never was.

textlabel.image/IM_DRAW                               textlabel.image/IM_DRAW

   NAME
      IM_DRAW -- Draw text label.

   FUNCTION
      This method tells the textlabel object to draw the text using
      the position of it's embedded Image struct.

      If TLA_GADGET or TLA_IMAGES was specified, this works like a
      sequence of IM_FRAMEBOX and IM_DRAWFRAME, where the contents
      box for IM_FRAMEBOX is just the gadget's/image's dimensions
      and position.  The message's offset is interpreted as the
      gadget's/image's offset.
      NOTE: This does not work for gagdets using one of the
            GA_Rel...-Attributes.

      For now only all rendering is done using state IDS_NORMAL.
      It's save to pass other states which may or may not be
      supported in future.

   RESULT
      This method returns 1.

textlabel.image/IM_DRAWFRAME                     textlabel.image/IM_DRAWFRAME

   NAME
      IM_DRAWFRAME -- Draw text label within a given frame.

   FUNCTION
      This method tells the textlabel object to draw it's text
      within the bounds of a given frame.  The position within the
      frame depents on TLA_ADJUST.  Default is centered both
      horizontal and vertical within the bounds.

      TLADJUST_HLEFT
      TLADJUST_HRIGHT
         Adjust the text at the left (right) edge of the frame.
         Default: center text between left and right edge.

      TLADJUST_HTOP
      TLADJUST_HBOTTOM
         Adjust the text to the top (bottom) edge of the frame.
         Default: center text between top and bottom of frame.

      Out of each group (horizontal and vertical adjustment) you may
      specify not more than one flag.

   NOTE
      Specifying more than one flag out of each adjustment group
      may lead to unexcected results.  Never rely on this result
      since this may or may not change in furture.

   BUGS
      If the bounds are not large enough to hold the images, it
      simply renders over the bounds.

   RESULT
      This method returns 1.

textlabel.image/IM_FRAMEBOX                       textlabel.image/IM_FRAMEBOX

   NAME
      IM_FRAMEBOX -- Ask dimensions for framing a certain area. (V2)

   FUNCTION
      This method asks the textlabel object what it's dimensions
      would be if it has to frame a specific rectangular area.  The
      label position beside this area depents on TLA_ADJUST.  Default
      is centered both horizontal and vertical within the area.  See
      the imageclass description for IM_FRAMEBOX for more
      information.

      This are the values for TLA_ADJUST:

      TLADJUST_HLEFT
      TLADJUST_HRIGHT
         Place the text left (right) of the area.
         Default: center text horizontal.

      TLADJUST_HTOP
      TLADJUST_HBOTTOM
         Place the text above (below) the area.
         Default: center text vertical.

      Out of each group (horizontal and vertical adjustment) you may
      specify not more than one flag.

   NOTE
      Specifying more than one flag out of each adjustment group
      may lead to unexcected results.  Never rely on this result
      since this may or may not change in furture.

   RESULT
      This method returns 1.

textlabel.image/IM_SET                                 textlabel.image/IM_SET

   NAME
      OM_SET  -- Set object attributes.

   FUNCTION
      This method sets the textlabel object's attributes,
      (re)calculates the dimensions and determines the shortcut key.

      If TLA_GADGET or TLA_IMAGE have been set, this method also
      recalculates the labels position.

   RESULT
      This method returns 1.
