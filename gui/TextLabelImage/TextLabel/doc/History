                =======================

V 2.2: - underscore is now always 2 pixels below baseline
       - underscore renders exactly under the charakter as the font
         says (using TextExtent).
       - implemented IM_HITTEST and IM_HITFRAME, since superclass
         didn't handle this as needed. For now both return 1.

V 2.1: - TLA_Font is getable now
       - polished up autodocs

V 2.0: (not released)
       - new attributes TLA_GADGET and TLA_IMAGE for even easier
         gadget or image labeling. See autodocs for more information.
       - supports IM_FRAMEBOX.
       - underline was one pixel to low.
       - header files missed some aliases

V 1.2: (not released)
       - should now handle all fonts correctly.

V 1.1: - first release.
