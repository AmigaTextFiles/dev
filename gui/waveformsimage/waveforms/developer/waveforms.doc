*    NAME
*       waveforms.image--Audio Waveforms type display images.                 (V0)
*
*    SUPERCLASS
*       imageclass
*
*    DESCRIPTION
*       The waveforms.image class provides a selectable waveform image display.
*
*    METHODS
*       OM_NEW--Create the waveforms.  Passed to superclass, then OM_SET.
*
*       OM_SET--Set object attributes.  Passed to superclass first.
*
*       OM_GET--Get object attributes.  Passed to superclass first.
*
*       OM_UPDATE--Set object notification attributes.  Passed to superclass
*           first.
*
*       IM_DRAW--Renders the images.  Overrides the superclass.
*
*       All other methods are passed to the superclass, including OM_DISPOSE.
*
*    ATTRIBUTES
*
*       SYSIA_DrawInfo (struct DrawInfo *) -- Contains important pen                 IS
*           information.  This is required if IA_BGPen and IA_FGPen are
*           not specified.
*
*       IA_Pens -- pointer to UWORD pens[]                                           IS
*
*       IA_FGPen (LONG) -- Pen to use to draw the hilite box outline or BLOCKPEN.    IS
*
*       IA_BGPen (LONG) -- Pen to use to draw the shadow box outline or DETAILPEN.   IS
*
*       IA_Width (WORD) -- Width of the image - def 64 pixels.                       IS
*
*       IA_Height (WORD) -- Height of the image - def 64 pixels.                     IS
*
*
*    Private Tags:
*
*       WFI_WaveType (LONG) -- Which of the 5 types of waveforms is used.            ISG
*
*              WF_SINE_WAVE         0
*              WF_TRIANGULAR_WAVE   1
*              WF_RAMPUP_WAVE       2
*              WF_RAMPDOWN_WAVE     3
*              WF_SQUARE_WAVE       4
*
*       WFI_WaveShape (LONG) -- Pulse width for square wave only. Values can be      ISG
*                                             from -98 to +98.
*
*       WFI_Outline (LONG) -- Draw the wave either as WF_SOLID_DISPLAY               ISG
*                                                  or as WF_DOTTED_DISPLAY
*
*       WFI_BoxFrame (LONG) -- Draw a box frame around the graphic or none           IS
*                                   the graphic will be adjusted to fit inside
*
*       WFI_OsciPen (WORD) -- Pen to use to draw the 'oscilloscope screen'           ISG
*                                   background.  If -1 is specified then
*                                   BARBLOCKPEN is used.
*
*       WFI_WavePen (WORD) -- Pen to use to draw the wave.  If -1 is                 IS
*                                   specified then BARDETAILPEN is used.
*
*       WFI_ZeroPen (WORD) -- Draw the zero line using this colour.  The             ISG
*                                   zero line is only drawn when the option
*                                   WF_DOTTED_DISPLAY is selected.  Defaults
*                                   to WF_OsciPen for 'invisible' line or to
*                                   BARTRIMPEN if -1 is specified.
