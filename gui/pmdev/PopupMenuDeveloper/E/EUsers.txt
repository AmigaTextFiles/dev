  Hello users 8-)

    My name is Daniel Kasmeroglu and I've ported the example programs
    for the "popupmenu.library" from C to E, so you will have some
    example sources, too. Although I've included the emodules since
    I've haven't found modules for version 8 of the "popupmenu.library".

    All sources I've translated, are starting with the command "setstack()".
    I've added the neccessary module which is placed in the drawer
    "emodules:kasimir". This command is only used to set up propper
    stack values, so you can remove these lines without changing the
    functionality. A command "ShowStackSize" is also included to find
    out the stacksize, an E program is using.

    Have fun ;-)

  P.S.: You can contact me if you have problems or you simply want to.
