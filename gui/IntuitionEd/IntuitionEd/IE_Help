   1  -                  What's Intuition Ed ?
                      ---------------------------
 Intuition Ed is a source-code utility that transfers user inputs to source
 code in C.  The main job of the program is to check, to arrange, to write
 and to link created structures.
 It can also write the required functions to open and close them.
 To check your edited structures, Intuition Ed can write a main program
 that opens all elements and closes them after 20 seconds.
 The resulting C program can be compiled with Manx and Lattice compilers.

 Another feature is the possibility to open the same structure twice
 by simply giving two structures the same name when you edit them.
 (For example you can use the same borders for different gadgets.)

   2  -                  Program description
                      ---------------------------

 At first the program looks at your screen size. If it's 200 or 400
 pixels high it opens an interlace screen.
 In the first program window of Intuition Ed you just have to enter the 
 file name of your C program and choose include files that will appear in
 the source code. In the two spare gadgets you can add your own include files.

 You can enter comments, defines and macros in the gadgets on the right
 side. There is room for 25 lines which will appear unchanged in the
 source code. They can be scrolled with the arrow gadgets.

 You can also leave the program immediately by pressing the 'Exit' gadget,
 or you can save the inputs with the 'End' gadget.

 By pressing the 'Screen' or 'Window' gadget you can edit structures.
 Their order is important : 

 Structures containing others must be edited first. 


             TEXT / BORDER        TEXT / BORDER
                  ^                    ^
 SCREEN   -»    WINDOW      -»       GADGET


 If you edit a window before you do the screen, the C program opens the
 window on the Workbench and afterwards opens the screen.

 A structure is saved after you pressed the 'OK' gadget. It then can
 only be changed in the source code later.
 So its useful to know what you want to create and to have it on 
 a piece of paper.
 
 Before the structure is saved, it's checked. If it's senseless, a requester
 appears and you can change it (Stop) or you can save it nevertheless
 (continue).

 To avoid errors the structures should not have the same name as functions
 and shouldn't begin with a number.

 To write identical structures only once in the source code you 
 merely give them the same name. 
 That doesn't work with gadgets.

 It's important to know that only the last structure with the same name
 is saved ( independent of the others ).

 EXAMPLE:

 You can edit two identical windows containing different gadgets.
 In the first window menue you enter the name of both structures
 in 'Window Name' and press 'OK'. Then you can create the gadgets 
 for this window. You return to the window menue and enter the
 same window name again. Then you edit the windows, press
 'OK' again and edit it's gadgets.


 Two journal-files, which simulate user inputs show an example
 of how to use Intuition Ed.
 They ONLY work on the non-interlaced Intuition Ed screen!
 Some of the few comments are in German.
 Both create a file called 'Demo.c' in device 'RAM:'

 Intuition Ed must already run and it's screen must be behind the Workbench
 when you start a demo.

 Demo1:
 ------
 run IntuitionEd
 IntuitionEd/playback IntuitionEd/Demo1

 The demo creates a screen containing two windows with either a text
 or a border on them.

 Demo2:
 ------
 run IntuitionEd
 IntuitionEd/playback IntuitionEd/Demo2

 This demo shows how to write structures which are opend several times.
 It creates two identical screens containing two identical windows
 with different textes on them.

   3  -                      Structures
                     -----------------------------


   Screens
-------------

 To edit a screen structure, you just enter the structure-values in the 
 gadgets.

 You can chose a default font for your screen with the gadgets 
 'Topaz 60' and 'Topaz 80'.


   Windows
-------------
 
 The gadgets to edit gadgets, borders and text are aktiv after you
 created a window on which they can be displayed.


   Gadgets
-------------

 Since you haven't yet the complete version of Intuition Ed, a description
 does not make much sense.


    Text
------------

 Beside the IntuiText structure you can create a TextAttr structure in the
 text menu. You MUST activate the 'ON' gadget to save a TextAttr
 structure !!!

 You can create a DiskFont in the TextAttr structure with Intuition Ed
 but it's not automatically opend by the compiled C program.

 There is a program in the Intuition Ed directory (DiskFont.c) which shows
 how to handle DiskFonts.

 As in the IntuiText structure, the LeftEdge and TopEdge values are relative
 to the gadget position if it's a gadgettext.


   Borders
-------------

 When you enter the edges of a border you have to put a value for every
 edge you want to have.

 If you edit a gadgetborder (with the entire version)
 the edges contain default values to surround the gadget.

 The LeftEdge and TopEdge values are relative to the gadget position.

   4  -                    Quit Intuition Ed
                      ---------------------------

 You get to the Save menu by pressing the 'End' Gadget in any other menu.
 By pressing the 'Cancel' gadget you can return to this menu again.
 You can also quit the program without saving anything ('Exit').

 When the 'Open_All() & Close_All()' gadget is activated Intuition Ed
 writes functions which open and close all intuition elements.
 It can also write a main function which calls them with 20 seconds delay.
 Intuition Ed can also write comments on all structures and headlines to
 seperate and describe functions in the source code.

 Please feel free to copy and spread this version of Intuition Ed and the
 files which go with it. It's public domain !
 The public domain version of Intuition Ed is not complete!   

 To get the entire program (which can also save gadgets) and
 to support further developments please send me 20$ or something equal
 in any currency and you get the latest copy of Intuition Ed and
 similar PD tools and program examples which are on the same disk.


 This program is originally German (thats why I got to take the interlace
 mode to fit on your screen) but you can also get the German version with
 a much more detailed description of the intuition structures !

 That's it.
 If you have any questions, comments, bug reports, money sent it to
