drag.gadget release 1.0b2
-------------------------

This is a new beta version of my drag&drop gadget BOOPSI class.
I have tested it (not very much) on an A3000 with kickstart v40.
Look at the two example programs (dragtest.c and droptest.c).

Note that this is a beta version of drag.gadget and its example
programs. They are not tested very much, so you use them at your own
risk!

Notes:

- The driver software of some graphics cards seems to introduce a bug
  with the GELS animation system, causing the system to crash if
  animated bobs are used. If this is the case for your system, it can be
  resolved with the patchgels program (see patchgels drawer).


You may use and distribute *this version (drag.gadget 40.21)* freely
with your application, if you send me bug reports. This includes
reporting system configurations running this class without problems.
