patchgels 0.1
-------------

The driver software of some graphics cards seems to introduce a bug with the
GELS animation system, causing the system to crash if animated bobs are used. If
this is the case for your system, it can be resolved with the patchgels program.

INSTALLATION:
Simply put it into your WBStartup drawer and start it.
If it is started a second time it tries to remove itself from memory.

OPERATION:
The graphics.library/DrawGList() function is patched. Normally, if the BOBSAWAY
flag is set in the Flags field of a bob, DrawGList() should remove it from the
screen, from any double buffering memory and from the gels list. Afterwards, the
BOBNIX flag should be set. This works if no graphics cards are installed.

At least one of the "RTG" graphics systems seems to introduce a bug in the GELS
system (at least with AmigaOS 40.70, A3000), because setting the BOBSAWAY flag
results only in removing the bob from the screen, not from the gels list.
However, the RemIBob() function works normally.

The changed DrawGList() function first calls the original function, then scanns
the gels list for bobs, which are removed from the screen but not from the gels
list. If one is found, the error is corrected. Normally this does not happen, so
if no "RTG" system is installed, this patch should do nothing.
