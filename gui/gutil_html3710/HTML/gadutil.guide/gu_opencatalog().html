<B>   NAME</B>
	GU_OpenCatalog -- Open a message catalog.

<B>   SYNOPSIS</B>
	catalog = GU_OpenCatalog(name, version)
	D0                       A0    D0

	struct Catalog *GU_OpenCatalog(STRPTR, ULONG);

<B>   FUNCTION</B>
	This function opens a message catalog. Catalogs contain all the
	text strings that an application uses. These strings can easily
	be replaced by strings in a different language, which causes the
	application to magically start operation in that new language.

	Catalogs originally come from disk files. This function searches
	for them in the following places:

		PROGDIR:Catalogs/languageName/name
		LOCALE:Catalogs/languageName/name

	where languageName is the name of the language associated with the
	locale parameter.

<B>   INPUTS</B>
	catalogname - the NULL terminated name of the catalog to open (just
		      the name, not the complete path to it).

	version - required version of the catalog to open. Passign 0 as version
		  number means that the program will accept any found version of
		  the catalog. Other values than 0 means exactly that version.

<B>   RESULT</B>
	catalog - A message catalog to use with GU_GetLocaleStr or any of the
		  Locale library functions or NULL. NULL is returned on error
		  or if the application can use its built-in strings instead
		  of loading a catalog from disk.

<B>   EXAMPLE</B>
	GU_OpenCatalog("myprogram.catalog",0);

	will open any version of the catalog file "myprogram.catalog" found
	in either PROGDIR:Catalogs/languageName/ (where the program was started
	from), or LOCALE:Catalogs/languageName/.

	GU_OpenCatalog("myprogram.catalog",5);

	will open version 5 of the catalog file. If v5 is not available, the
	program will use its internal strings.

<B>   NOTES</B>
	If you want to specify other tags than the version tag, you must
	use the Locale library OpenCatalog(). This function is generally a
	shortcut to that function. By using this routine, you may not need
	to open Locale library at all.

	This routine assumes that the built-in language of the program is
	english. If you write your programs in another language, you must
	open the catalog by yourself.
