<P>
Tests all free memory in your computer. The user can change all test
values, and select how many times to use the same value (the value is
shifted one bit) before using the next one. This program is localized
and uses the new help functions in GadUtil ("hothelp" or what it
should be called).</P>
<P>
There is also a CLI version of the program available in the same
archive. The output is sent to a CON window (ANSI codes are used)
while testing. Use this version if the other one eats too much memory
to find any errors.
