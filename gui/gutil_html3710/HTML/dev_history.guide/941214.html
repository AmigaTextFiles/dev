 ~~~~~~~
	* Made the part that created the gadget's label of create_layout_gadget
	  into a subroutine. This routine will be used for MX-gadgets.

	* Added support for the GU_GadgetText to MX gadgets. The text will
	  always be placed above the gadget, at the same side as the gadget's
	  choices. Checked with WBPattern &amp; Serial prefs to place the texts
	  at the "right" places.

	* Fixed an Enforcer-hit in the GU_GetIMsg routine. All SLIDER_KIND
	  gadgets (LISTVIEW, SLIDER, SCROLLER) requires that you wait for
	  IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE messages. A MOUSEMOVE message's IAddress is a pointer
	  to a gadget if the mouse pointer was above a gadget that requires
	  IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE messages and the left mouse button was pressed down
	  when then message arrived. Otherwise, the IAddress for a MOUSEMOVE
	  message is NOT NULL (?). I found out that the IAddress field was
	  the same as im_IDCMPWindow if isn't a gadget pointer.
