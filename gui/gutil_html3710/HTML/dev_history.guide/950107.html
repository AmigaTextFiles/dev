	* Made GTLV_ShowSelected work with gadgets created by
	  GU_LayoutGadgetsA. Normally you would have to create the string
	  gadget manually before the other gadgets. Now the ti_Data field
	  of the GTLV_ShowSelected tag is used for the gadget ID that
	  should show the selected entry. GadTools requires that the string
	  gadget is exactly as wide as the listview gadget that it should
	  be connected to. Here is an example of a usable gadget definition:


	ShowSelGad:
		dc.l	GU_GadgetKind,	STRING_KIND,	GU_AutoHeight,	4
		dc.l	GU_DupeWidth,	GAD_LISTVIEW,	GU_GadgetText,	NULL
		dc.l	TAG_DONE

	  It is possible to use the GU_GadgetText tag, but I have never seen
	  it in any program. The GU_GadgetKind tag MUST be used and the
	  GU_DupeWidth tag is the best way to ensure that the gadget gets
	  the right width. GU_AutoHeight or another tag that controls the
	  height of the gadget should be used (not really required, but
	  otherwise the string gadget's height depends on the height of the
	  gadget that was created before). Left and top position of the
	  gadget is ignored by GadTools.

	  GTLV_ShowSelected differs in these ways if used by GU_LayoutGadgets:

	  ti_Data = -1	Creates a read-only gadget below the listview. Same
			as if 0 is passed in ti_Data for GadTools.

	  ti_Data =  x	GadgetID for the gadget that should show the selected
			entry. Same as if a gadget pointer is passed in ti_Data
			for GadTools.

	  This tag's ti_Data field will be changed during the creation of the
	  gadget, but is changed back before the GU_LayoutGadgets returns.
