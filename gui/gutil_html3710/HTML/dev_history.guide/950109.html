	* Started to create a BORDER_KIND gadget, but a little misundrestanding
	  of this gadget kind caused this gadget kind to become BEVELBOX_KIND.
	  BORDER_KIND will have to wait some time...

	  BEVELBOX_KIND is used to create bevelboxes (what else ??). This kind
	  is really not a gadget, but I created it to make it possible to place
	  bevelboxes relative to gadgets and other bevel boxes. All tags that
	  is used for placement and size works with this "gadget" kind.

	  BEVELBOX_KIND supports all "FrameTypes" that is described for the
	  GadTools function DrawBevelBoxA (v39). It is really only three kinds
	  of boxes, but with some combinations there will be 12 different boxes
	  available (6 of them is supported by GadTools v39).

	  Different bevelbox border kinds:
		- BFT_BUTTON (GT v39)  - standard BUTTON_KIND border
		- BFT_RIDGE (GT v39)   - STRING_KIND gadget border
		- BFT_DROPBOX (GT v39) - "icon drop box" border

		All of these can be inverted with the tag GUBB_Recessed, TRUE.
		All these kinds can be created and inverted in GadTools v39,
		but GadTools contains a little bug - if you use the tag
		GTBB_Recessed, the bevelbox will alway be inverted.

		All different types (3 ordinary, 3 inverted) can have a gadget
		text, but this text is always placed in the middle of the upper
		line of the bevel box.

	The color of the text can be changed with two tags:
		- GUBB_TextPen	 - selects which "pen" that should be used to
				   write the text with.

		- GUBB_TextColor - selects which color register that should be
				   used to write the text with.

	Totally you will have 12 different boxes to choose from:
		- 3 normal		 BFT_BUTTON, BFT_RIDGE, BFT_DROPBOX
		- 3 inverted		 GUBB_Recessed, TRUE
		- 3 normal + text	 GU_GadgetText, GU_LocaleText
		- 3 inverted + text 	 GUBB_Recessed, TRUE, GU_GadgetText

	* Two new routines was created for BEVELBOX_KIND:
		- GU_RefreshBoxes  - redraws all bevel boxes
		- GU_RefreshWindow - redraws the contents of the window and is
		  		     a replacement for GT_RefreshWindow.
