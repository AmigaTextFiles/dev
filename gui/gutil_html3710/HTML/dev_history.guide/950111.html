	* Added a RememberKey field in the extra data structure created
	  for the gadgets that are GadUtil gadgets and gadgets using
	  hotkeys. Can be used to allocate some extra data related to that
	  gadget.
 
	* All LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets will now allocate the extra data
	  structure (the RememberKey is needed for the list's nodes).

	* Three flags added for the placement of the text in a bevel box
	  gadget.

		- BB_TEXT_ABOVE - The default text placement. Using this
				flag, the text will be placed at the top
				line of the bevel box. ___Text___

		- BB_TEXT_IN	- The text will be placed so the half of
				the text will be below the top line of the
				bevel box. ---Text---

		- BB_TEXT_BELOW	- The text will be placed below ___    ___
				the top line of the bevel box.     Text

	* A new function created - GU_OpenFont. This routine will open a
	  font using the diskfont.library's OpenDiskFont if diskfont.library
	  was opened when gadutil was loaded into memory. Otherwise graphics
	  library will be used to open the font. Graphics.library can only
	  open fonts that are already loaded into memory and ROM fonts.


	* GU_OpenFont is used internally by text_width, GU_RefreshBoxes
	  and create_layout_gad (.printtext).
