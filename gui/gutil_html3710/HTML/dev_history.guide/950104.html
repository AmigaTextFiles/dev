 ~~~~~~~
	* Wrote the beginning of the autodocs for all routines in the library
	  Only the parameters and a short explanation of the routine is in
	  these files. I created one file for every function in the library.
	  These files will be joined to a larger document or a guide at a
	  later time. The file "99.GU_NewFunction" is used as a beginning to
	  autodocs for all new functions.
