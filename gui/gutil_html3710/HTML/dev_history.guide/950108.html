	* Tried to find a bug in GadUtil.library. After some testing I
	  found out that this is a bug in GadTools.library. In the built-in
	  test program, the bug is clearly visible if a string gadget is
	  used to display the selected entry in a listview gadget. The included
	  example is an early version of ListUtil3. More information is
	  available in that example.

	  When a LISTVIEW_KIND gadget is created, the maximum allowed height
	  is given in gng_Height. GadTools adjusts this value to the height of
	  the text font and the spacing between the entries (LAYOUTA_Spacing).
	  The gadget should NEVER be taller than the given value, but can be
	  smaller than the desired height.

	  In the example, the listview gets taller than the given height value,
	  but if you use the built-in TEXT_KIND gadget to show the selected
	  entry (GTLV_ShowSelected, NULL or GTLV_ShowSelected, -1 for GUtil),
	  the listview's height will be correct.
