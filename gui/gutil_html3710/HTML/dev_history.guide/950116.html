 ~~~~~~~
	* Wrote a new routine for debugging that prints out the whole
	  contents of the NewGadget structure that is used to create the
	  gadget.

	* Inserted a line that shows the address of the created gadget. It
	  should now be a lot easier to find the gadget that couldn't be
	  created.

	* New tags:
		GU_AddWidChar	- increase the gadget width by ti_Data
				characters

		GU_AddHeiLines	- increase the gadget height with ti_Data
				lines

	* Changed GU_AddTopLines and GU_AddHeiLines so that they use the
	  half of the calculated value ( (fontheight * ti_Data)/2 ). This
	  was done to make it possible to add half the height of the font
	  to something.
