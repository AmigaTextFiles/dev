 ~~~~~~~
	* Removed all menus and localization of some test programs. Older
	  (new) examples was created by just copying the "BetterTest"
	  program and removing the gadget datas. Everything that was in
	  the BetterTest program was then also in the new program, making
	  it larger than necessary.

	* Made a script (XIcon) to create the archives that we are copying
	  while developing the library.
