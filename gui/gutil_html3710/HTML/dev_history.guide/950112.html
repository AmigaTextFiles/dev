	* Made it possible to edit the include files from the include file
	  installation program. The files to be edited can be selected and
	  either the function files or the constant files can be edited.
	  All files can be opened at the same time.

	* GU_NewList - a new routine that initializes a List structure.

	* GU_ClearList - a new routine that clear a ListView gadget and
	  deallocates all the nodes that belongs to that gadget. All nodes
	  must be allocated with GU_AddTail, or connected to the gadget's
	  gu_RememberKey in any other way (AllocRemember with that key is
	  one way to do it).

	* GU_DetachList - detaches the list from a listview, without
	  deallocating the nodes or clear the gadget. Should be used if
	  you want to change the contents of a ListView gadget, or add a
	  new node to the list.

	* GU_AttachList - reattach the list, or attach a new list to a
	  ListView gadget. This function will also refresh the contents of
	  the gadget.

	* GU_AddTail - Adds a node at the end of a list. This routine will
	  allocate the memory needed for the node structure and the text
	  that will be shown in the ListView (the node's name string). The
	  allocation is done with the gadget's own RememberKey.

	* GU_ChangeStr - Changes the contents of a STRING_KIND gadget.
