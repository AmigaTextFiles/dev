Below is a list of some of the main functions covered by this library.

 * FAST (NO OR VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE AGAINST GADTOOLS) AND SMALL (LESS THAN 13k).
   WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE. NO F*CKING 'C' or any other slow language!

 * Font adaptive. Use any of the system fonts and most other fonts for
   gadgets, texts and menus. All gadgets are placed relative to each
   other, but can be placed at absolute positions (needed for the first
   gadget).

 * No need to use GIMMEZEROZERO windows, as this is automatically handled
   by the library. If you specify a gadget position of 10,10 the gadget
   will be placed at 10,10 within the window's border.

 * Localized. It is really easy to localize all your (new) programs by
   using this library. Functions and macros for creating localized menus
   are supplied.

 * Both assembly and 'C' language support. This is one of the things that is
   missing in most of the other gui libraries. Some extra macros are defined
   for assembly language users, and will make the gadget and menu creating
   process even more easy.

 * All GadTools gadgets are supported. Some extra functions are provided
   for ListViews. BUTTON_KIND (and IMAGE_KIND) gadgets have some extra tags,
   including a toggle-select option.

   6 extended gadget types are handled by the library:
    
      FILE_KIND     - gadget for selecting a file.

      DRAWER_KIND   - gadget for selecting a drawer. Most programs also
                       use this gadget for file selection.

      IMAGE_KIND    - uses an intuition image for the gadget. Can use
                       different images for selected and non-selected state.

      BEVELBOX_KIND - gadtools bevelboxes, with some extensions. All
                       gadtools bevelboxes are supported (even with v37).
                       Extensions allows text to be placed above, in or below
                       the upper line of the box. All kinds can be inverted.

                       New for v36.52: Bevelbox text placement extended.
                       3 new placements available together with the old
                       ones: centered, left adjusted &amp; right adjusted.

                       BFT_BUTTON   - GT v37 BUTTON_KIND border
                       BFT_RIDGE    - GT v37 STRING_KIND border
                       BFT_DROPBOX  - GT v39 BBFT_ICONDROPBOX border
                       BFT_HORIZBAR - A horizontal shadowed line
                       BFT_VERTBAR  - A vertical shadowed line

                       This makes it a total of 100 bevel box types. The bevel
                       boxes are treated as gadgets by the library, and you
                       can obtain the structure for the bevelbox in the same
                       way as you get the gadget pointer.

                       New for v36.53: Added optional shadow on bevel box text.
                       The shadow has a selectable color/pen and the "sun" can
                       be placed in four different positions.

      PROGRESS_KIND - progress indicator gadget. Background and fill color
                       can be selected. Supports values up to 4.294.967.295,
                       but maximum value should not exceed 4.294.967.295/width.
                       v36.55.

      LABEL_KIND    - a text label that can be placed relative to other texts,
                       gadgets, bevelboxes and progress indicators.

 * Can create the minimum required IDCMP mask so that all gadgets works.

 * A new OpenFont (graphics.library and diskfont.library replacement) is supplied.
   This function will open any font (from RAM, ROM or load it from disk).

 * Functions for listviews include adding nodes (memory for the string is
   allocated by the function), counting nodes, getting node pointers, clearing
   a listview, attach and detach lists, moving nodes up and down. A function
   that allows you to sort one or two lists is included from v36.59.

 * No need to open gadtools.library anymore, since all gadtools functions are
   provided through this library. Some (the most useable) functions from locale
   library are also provided by gadutil.

 * Many libraries are opened through gadutil.library, and these library bases
   are available for your own use (you don't have to open or close some libs).

 * All gadgets are created using tag lists. Every next gadget will use the
   previous gadgets values as defaults. Only one call to the gadget making
   routine is needed for every gadget list.

 * All gadgets can have their own hotkey. No extra work is needed by the
   programmer (only one extra tag).

 * All gadgets (and bevelboxes, texts and progress displays) can have a help
   string attached to it. If the pointer is moved above that object, a
   selectable string or text gadget will be used to display the help string.
   The text can alternatively be shown in the window's or screen's title. The
   help string can be localized.

 * Distributed with lots of examples, mostly in assembly language, but also
   in 'C'.

 * Other functions include:

      Status change for toggle select buttons.

      String change for STRING and TEXT_KIND gadgets.

      Disable functions for all gadget kinds (new for 36.56).

      Routines to set up a busy-pointer (available for both v37 and v39). These
       routines also blocks the input to the main window of the program.

      Routine to check if the mouse pointer is within a gadgets box. Useful
       for mouse-position sensitive appwindows.

      Bevelbox and window refreshing functions.

      Functions to clear and size/move windows

      Easy access to the most important values of the gadgets.

 * FAST (NO OR VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE AGAINST GADTOOLS) AND SMALL (LESS THAN 13k).
   WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE. NO F*CKING 'C' or any other slow language!
