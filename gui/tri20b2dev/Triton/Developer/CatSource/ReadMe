    This directory contains the sources for the language catalogs for Triton.
They can be compiled with CatComp v39+.

    In  addition  to the built-in english strings, the following translations
are  included  in this release, both as compiled catalogs and CatComp catalog
sources:

    - Deutsch (translated by Stefan Zeiger)
    - Français (translated by Philipp Lonke)
    - Nederlands (translated by Frank Verheyen)
    - Svenska (translated by Magnus Holmgren)

    Until now no translations are available for the following languages:

    - Dansk
    - Español
    - Italiano
    - Norsk
    - Português

    If  you  find and correct any bugs or make a new translation, please send
it to me for inclusion in the next Triton release.

    *Note:*  Unfortunately the swedish and dutch translations for release 1.2
didn't arrive here  in time for Triton release 1.2,  so some strings in these
catalogs stay untranslated (=English). I'm sorry for this inconvenience.
