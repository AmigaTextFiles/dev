Here you can find the tex- and dvi-files for the MUI3.1 Autodocs.

The Utilities I used:
i)   "Autotex" by Richard Koerber (perhaps good for Commodore Autodocs, but not so
     good for MUI Autodocs)
ii)  "Adoc" by Tobias Ferber (Autotex liked it a little bit more).
iii) "GoldED" by Dietmar Eilert (!!!THE EDITOR!!!, make dreams come true)
