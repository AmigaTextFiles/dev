DESCRIPTION

    GadUtil is another gui library which main goal was to make it
    easy to create font sensitive user interfaces. The library has
    grown away from this main goal, and become another useful-
    routine-library.

FEATURES

    * FAST (NO OR VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE AGAINST GADTOOLS) AND SMALL
      (LESS THAN 13k).

    * Font adaptive and localized.

    * Supports all GadTools gadgets + some extensions to them.
      6 extended gadget types are available:

      - FILE_KIND     -- gadget for selecting a file.

      - DRAWER_KIND   -- gadget for selecting a drawer.

      - IMAGE_KIND    -- custom gadget that uses one or two images

      - BEVELBOX_KIND -- gadtools bevelboxes + 2 new types and text

      - PROGRESS_KIND -- progress indicator gadget.

      - LABEL_KIND    --  a text label that can be placed relative to
                          other texts gadgets, bevelboxes and progress
                          indicators.

    * Automatic creation of minimum required IDCMP mask.

    * Replacement for graphics/font OpenFont and graphics CloseFont.

    * Functions to add, count, move and sort nodes in a list.

    * All gadgets are created using tag lists. Every next gadget
      will use the previous gadgets values as defaults. Only one
      call to the gadget making routine is needed for every gadget
      list.

    * All gadgets can have their own hotkey. No extra work is needed
      by the programmer (only one extra tag).

    * All gadgets, texts and boxes can have their own (localized) help
      string, to be shown in a selectable gadget or in the window/screen
      title whenever the mouse is placed above that gadget.

    * Distributed with lots of examples, mostly in assembly language,
      but also in 'C'.

    * Other functions include:

        - Status change for toggle select buttons.

        - String change for STRING and TEXT_KIND gadgets.

        - Disable functions for all gadget kinds (new for 36.56).

        - Routines to set up a busy-pointer (available for both v37
          and v39). These routines also blocks the input to the main
          window of the program.

        - Routine to check if the mouse pointer is within a gadgets
          box. Useful for mouse-position sensitive appwindows.

        - Bevelbox, text and window refreshing functions.

        - Functions to clear and size/move windows

    * FAST (NO OR VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE AGAINST GADTOOLS) AND SMALL
      (LESS THAN 13k).
