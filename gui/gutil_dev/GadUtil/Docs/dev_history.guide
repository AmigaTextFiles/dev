@ENDNODE

@NODE "EveryDay" "Changes and tests done almost every day"
 Almost every day:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* Small changes/comments/bug fixes/additions in the test program.

	* Reassembled with all possible settings on GU_DEBUG and GU_LIBRARY

	* Testing of all external programs that uses gadutil.library.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941208" "Changes 08-Dec-1994"
 941208:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Uses AllocMem instead of AllocRemember while making the HotKey
	  structure.

	* GU_FreeGadgets - New routine that replaces the GadTools FreeGadgets
	  if the layout part of the library isn't used (this routine will be
	  called by GU_FreeLayoutGadgets otherwise).

	* IMAGE_KIND now supports hotkeys. All tags that doesn't belong to
	  GadTools should now be written in the LayoutTags list.

	* GENERIC (IMAGE_KIND) TOGGLESELECT now changes status when you press
	  the hotkey for that gadget (only a IDCMP_GADGETUP was sent before).

	* GU_CoordsInGadBox - New routine that checks whether or not a coor-
	  dinate pair are within a gadgets area.

	* GU_SetGadgetAttrsA - Replacement for GadTools GT_SetGadgetAttrsA.

	* GU_SetGUGadAttrsA - Changes an IMAGE_KIND gadget's image(s).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941209" "Changes 09-Dec-1994"
 941209:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Added debug functions for OpenLib (initRoutine). Now we don't have
	  to open a lot of libraries in the beginning of the internal test
	  program...

	* Added debug functions for Close and Expunge routines. Same reason as
	  above. Expunge does not do a Remove() and FreeMem() on the library
	  when the internal test program is used.

	* Settings GU_DEBUG = 0 and GU_LIBRARY = 0 didn't work. The program was
	  using dosbase (for Delay) and this variable was not in the debug sect.

	* Wrote a routine that opens libraries in initRoutine. Can skip to check
	  if a library was opened or not and tries to open the next one if one
	  failed.

	* A small bug fix in GU_SetGUGadAttrsA:
	    move.l gg_MutualExclude,d3  ->  move.l gg_MutualExclude(a0),d3

	* Changed so that the HotKey part uses MutualExclude instead of
	  UserData. The flags in MutualExclude is moved into a longword in the
	  HotKey data structure.

	  All gadgets that uses the hotkey part, and all IMAGE_KIND gadgets
	  will now allocate about 40 bytes extra memory for each gadget.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941210" "Changes 10-Dec-1994"
 941210:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Uses AllocVec() instead of a new SECTION for the datas in
	  GU_LayoutGadgetsA. By changing this, the library now consist
	  of two fewer SECTIONS.

	* Removed all flags for the extra structure from the include file.
	  None of these flags is needed outside the library.

	* GU_GetGadgetPtr - New routine that returns the gadget structure
	  for any given gadget ID.

	* GU_GadgetArrayIndex - Returns -1 if an error occurs.

	* .CalculateGadget - Returns -1 and Z=1 if an error occurs.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941211" "Changes 11-Dec-1994"
 941211:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Made text_width into a library routine (GU_TextWidth).

	* Made get_locale_string into a library routine (GU_GetLocaleStr).

	* Removed the routine FindTag. It was the same as GU_FindTag.

	* GU_CreateLocMenuA - New routine that creates localized menus in
	  that way that Commodore's Locale tutorial describes.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941212" "Changes 12-Dec-1994"
 941212:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Tested and bugg fixed GU_CreateLocMenuA. Wrote a new external
	  test program.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941213" "Changes 13-Dec-1994"
 941213:
 ~~~~~~~
	* GU_OpenCatalog - New routine that opens a locale catalog. Uses
  /---    only two parameters - version and catalog name.
  |
  >------> Only written so we don't have to open locale.library!
  |
  \---	* GU_CloseCatalog - New routine to close a locale catalog. The only
	  difference from the locale.library routine is that this one checks
	  if locale is opened.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941214" "Changes 14-Dec-1994"
 941214:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Made the part that created the gadget's label of create_layout_gadget
	  into a subroutine. This routine will be used for MX-gadgets.

	* Added support for the GU_GadgetText to MX gadgets. The text will
	  always be placed above the gadget, at the same side as the gadget's
	  choices. Checked with WBPattern & Serial prefs to place the texts
	  at the "right" places.

	* Fixed an Enforcer-hit in the GU_GetIMsg routine. All SLIDER_KIND
	  gadgets (LISTVIEW, SLIDER, SCROLLER) requires that you wait for
	  IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE messages. A MOUSEMOVE message's IAddress is a pointer
	  to a gadget if the mouse pointer was above a gadget that requires
	  IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE messages and the left mouse button was pressed down
	  when then message arrived. Otherwise, the IAddress for a MOUSEMOVE
	  message is NOT NULL (?). I found out that the IAddress field was
	  the same as im_IDCMPWindow if isn't a gadget pointer.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941215" "Changes 15-Dec-1994"
 941215:
 ~~~~~~~
	* New tags:
		GU_AdjustBottom - subtract the height of the text font from y-pos
		GU_AdjustRight  - subtract the length of the text from x-pos

	* Changed the Hotkey part of the library to use gg_UserData instead of
	  gg_MutualExclude. MutualExclude is not used anywhere (the RKM says so),
	  but strange things started to happen with the PALETTE_KIND gadget if
	  running under OS3.0.

	* Changed the inparameters to GU_CreateLocMenuA. Now two tag lists is
	  passed to the function instead of one. The first is used for
	  CreateMenusA, and the other one is used for LayoutMenusA.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941216" "Changes 16-Dec-1994"
 941216:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Re-inserted the GADUSERMAGIC check for the UserData field. A part
	  of the Hotkey structure and some other flags is now in gadutil.i

	* All tags now uses the last given value.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941217" "Changes 17-Dec-1994"
 941217:
 ~~~~~~~
	* New tags:
		GU_AddLeftChar - add length of ti_Data chars to x-pos of gad
		GU_AddTopLines - att height of ti_Data lines to y-pos of gad

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941218" "Changes 18-Dec-1994"
 941218:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Wrote some new code to the start routine in the internal test program.
	  Now, a complete library base for GadUtil is created, and the CallLib
	  macro can now be used to call and debug GadUtil routines.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941219" "Changes 19-Dec-1994"
 941219:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Made it easy to remove the test program from the library and change
	  it to an external test program.

	  To change the internal test program to an external one:
	  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	  1. Load ExternTestInit.s to a free F-key (?)
	  2. Search for TestProgram: in the library, set block start.
	  3. Search for TestPgmEnd: in the library, copy the block.
	  4. Press the right F-key to find ExternTestInit.s
	  5. Insert the copied block at the end of the source.
	  6. Insert the missing include files.

	* Made it easier to replace the internal test program to an external
	  one that uses ExternTestInit.s as start code.

	  To change an external test program to an internal one:
	  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	  1. Load the external test program to a free F-key (?)
	  2. Search for TestProgram: in the library, set block start.
	  3. Search for TestPgmEnd: in the library, delete the block.
	  4. Press the right F-key to find the test program.
	  5. Search for TestProgram:, set block start.
	  6. Move to the end of the test program and copy the block.
	  7. Go back to the library source code and insert the copied block.
	  8. Insert the missing include files.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941220" "Changes 20-Dec-1994"
 941220:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Optimized the code that checks all Layout tags.

	* Joined some routines that checks for different tags:

	   - GU_MinWidth,	GU_MaxWidth,	GU_MinHeight,	GU_MaxHeight

	   - GU_AddHeight,	GU_AddWidth,	GU_AddLeft,	GU_AddTop,
						GU_AddRight,	GU_AddBottom
	   - GU_AdjustTop,	GU_AdjustBottom

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941221" "Changes 21-Dec-1994"
 941221:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Optimized some more parts of the routine that checks Layout tags.

	* Joined more routines:

	   - GU_Width,		GU_Height

	   - GU_Columns,	GU_AddLeftChar

	   - GU_HeightFactor,	GU_AddTopLines

	   - GU_DupeWidth,	GU_DupeHeight

	   - GU_AdjustLeft,	GU_AdjustRight

	* Changed the internal test program. The old test program is saved
	  as "OldInternal.s"

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941222" "Changes 22-Dec-1994"
 941222:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Wrote the include file for Lattice/SAS C (and other C-compilers).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941223" "Changes 23-Dec-1994"
 941223:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Some of the routines sent back the results in the "wrong" registers.
	  This doesn't matter for assemnly language programmers, but all other
	  programming languages requires that the results is returned in D0.

	  Some of the routines now sends results in more than one register
	  (often A0 and D0).

	* Changed GU_GadgetArrayIndex to use A0 as a pointer to the
	  LayoutGadget array (A1 is used internally)

	* Wrote the FD file and converted it to Lattice/SAS C, Aztec, DICE
	  and Maxon C (pragma files = as LVO in assembly language)

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941224" "Changes 24-Dec-1994"
@TOC "MAIN"
 941224:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Wrote an installation program for the include files (uses AskEnv).
	  The program can install and uninstall all include files that belongs
	  to GadUtil (two different assemblers, 4 C-compilers).

	* Fixed some small bugs in clib/gadutil_protos.h (I forgot to insert
	  GU_ before some of the routine names).

	* Started to rewrite the big test program (BetterTest.s) to C. All
	  data structures was finished. A lot of fuss with (ULONG):s and "&"
	  and Tags[5985.74] and other things that belong to C.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "941225" "Changes 25-Dec-1994"
 941225:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Finished the C version of the test program. Started to fix all
	  bugs in it (more than in the first version of the assembly language
	  test program).

	* Spent the rest of this day to find a weird bug that made the
	  hotkeys stop repeating after that they had repeated 4 times.

	  Found the bug when I started MemSnapII and saw that the program
	  allocated around 1k memory every second. The ListView gadget sets
	  the IDCMP_INTUITICKS flag (it's in LISTVIEWIDCMP) and the program
	  got a message every 1/50s. I did use the wrong ROM routine to
	  reply the message: ReplyMsg instead of GU/GT_ReplyIMsg.

	  Weird that I didn't notice this 7 hours earlier... (the error was
	  on the last line in the C source code except for all lines with a
	  lot of ([}{]) chars that is used in C).

	* Wrote two small assembly language routines to change the LED (sound
	  filter) directly from a function call in C.

	* It seems that C-compilers can't read a longword from two words right
	  after each other in a structure. It could be done in a complicated
	  way that should work with all C-compilers.

	  long coords;
	  coords = (LONG)imsg->MouseX << 16 | imsg->MouseY;

	  corresponds to this code in assembler (if imsg is in A0 and the
	  coords should be saved in D0):

	  moveq.l #0,d0			; coords = 0
	  move.w  im_MouseX(a0),d0	; coords = MouseX
	  lsl.l	  #16,d0		; << 16
	  or.w	  im_MouseY(a0),d0	; | MouseY

	  or a bit optimized:

	  move.w  im_MouseX(a0),d0	; coords = MouseX
	  swap	  d0			; x coord in the high word
	  move.w  im_MouseY(a0),d0	; y coord in the low word

	  or fully optimized:

	  move.l  im_MouseX(a0),d0	; X coord in high, Y coord in the low

@NODE "950104" "Changes 04-Jan-1995"
@TOC "MAIN"
 950104:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Wrote the beginning of the autodocs for all routines in the library
	  Only the parameters and a short explanation of the routine is in
	  these files. I created one file for every function in the library.
	  These files will be joined to a larger document or a guide at a
	  later time. The file "99.GU_NewFunction" is used as a beginning to
	  autodocs for all new functions.
	  
@ENDNODE

@NODE "950105" "Changes 05-Jan-1995"
@TOC "MAIN"
 950105:
 ~~~~~~~
	* GU_DisableGadget - New routine that changes the GA_Disabled flag
	  of a gadget. This routine is a shortcut for the ordinary GadTools
	  function GT_SetGadgetAttrsA.

	* GU_SetToggle - New routine that makes it possible to change the
	  status of a toggle-select gadget. Works with GadUtils own toggle-
	  select gadgets and on CheckBox gadgets.

	* Changed some routines to return result in the Z flag in the status
	  register (SR). This is probably only useful for assembly language
	  programmers.

	  Changed routines:

	  - GU_GetIMsg
		Z = 1 if there is no message to get.

	  - GU_GadgetArrayIndex
		Z = 1 if there were no gadget with the requested ID.

	  - GU_CoordsInGadBox
		Z = 1 if the coordinates way outside the gadget's border.

	  - GU_GetGadgetPtr
		Z = 1 if the gadget could not be found or the pointer was 0.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "950107" "Changes 07-Jan-1995"
@TOC "MAIN"
 950107:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Made GTLV_ShowSelected work with gadgets created by
	  GU_LayoutGadgetsA. Normally you would have to create the string
	  gadget manually before the other gadgets. Now the ti_Data field
	  of the GTLV_ShowSelected tag is used for the gadget ID that
	  should show the selected entry. GadTools requires that the string
	  gadget is exactly as wide as the listview gadget that it should
	  be connected to. Here is an example of a usable gadget definition:


	ShowSelGad:
		dc.l	GU_GadgetKind,	STRING_KIND,	GU_AutoHeight,	4
		dc.l	GU_DupeWidth,	GAD_LISTVIEW,	GU_GadgetText,	NULL
		dc.l	TAG_DONE

	  It is possible to use the GU_GadgetText tag, but I have never seen
	  it in any program. The GU_GadgetKind tag MUST be used and the
	  GU_DupeWidth tag is the best way to ensure that the gadget gets
	  the right width. GU_AutoHeight or another tag that controls the
	  height of the gadget should be used (not really required, but
	  otherwise the string gadget's height depends on the height of the
	  gadget that was created before). Left and top position of the
	  gadget is ignored by GadTools.

	  GTLV_ShowSelected differs in these ways if used by GU_LayoutGadgets:

	  ti_Data = -1	Creates a read-only gadget below the listview. Same
			as if 0 is passed in ti_Data for GadTools.

	  ti_Data =  x	GadgetID for the gadget that should show the selected
			entry. Same as if a gadget pointer is passed in ti_Data
			for GadTools.

	  This tag's ti_Data field will be changed during the creation of the
	  gadget, but is changed back before the GU_LayoutGadgets returns.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "950108" "Changes 08-Jan-1995"
@TOC "MAIN"
 950108:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Tried to find a bug in GadUtil.library. After some testing I
	  found out that this is a bug in GadTools.library. In the built-in
	  test program, the bug is clearly visible if a string gadget is
	  used to display the selected entry in a listview gadget. The included
	  example is an early version of ListUtil3. More information is
	  available in that example.

	  When a LISTVIEW_KIND gadget is created, the maximum allowed height
	  is given in gng_Height. GadTools adjusts this value to the height of
	  the text font and the spacing between the entries (LAYOUTA_Spacing).
	  The gadget should NEVER be taller than the given value, but can be
	  smaller than the desired height.

	  In the example, the listview gets taller than the given height value,
	  but if you use the built-in TEXT_KIND gadget to show the selected
	  entry (GTLV_ShowSelected, NULL or GTLV_ShowSelected, -1 for GUtil),
	  the listview's height will be correct.

@NODE "950109" "Changes 09-Jan-1995"
@TOC "MAIN"
 950109:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Started to create a BORDER_KIND gadget, but a little misundrestanding
	  of this gadget kind caused this gadget kind to become BEVELBOX_KIND.
	  BORDER_KIND will have to wait some time...

	  BEVELBOX_KIND is used to create bevelboxes (what else ??). This kind
	  is really not a gadget, but I created it to make it possible to place
	  bevelboxes relative to gadgets and other bevel boxes. All tags that
	  is used for placement and size works with this "gadget" kind.

	  BEVELBOX_KIND supports all "FrameTypes" that is described for the
	  GadTools function DrawBevelBoxA (v39). It is really only three kinds
	  of boxes, but with some combinations there will be 12 different boxes
	  available (6 of them is supported by GadTools v39).

	  Different bevelbox border kinds:
		- BFT_BUTTON (GT v39)  - standard BUTTON_KIND border
		- BFT_RIDGE (GT v39)   - STRING_KIND gadget border
		- BFT_DROPBOX (GT v39) - "icon drop box" border

		All of these can be inverted with the tag GUBB_Recessed, TRUE.
		All these kinds can be created and inverted in GadTools v39,
		but GadTools contains a little bug - if you use the tag
		GTBB_Recessed, the bevelbox will alway be inverted.

		All different types (3 ordinary, 3 inverted) can have a gadget
		text, but this text is always placed in the middle of the upper
		line of the bevel box.

	The color of the text can be changed with two tags:
		- GUBB_TextPen	 - selects which "pen" that should be used to
				   write the text with.

		- GUBB_TextColor - selects which color register that should be
				   used to write the text with.

	Totally you will have 12 different boxes to choose from:
		- 3 normal		 BFT_BUTTON, BFT_RIDGE, BFT_DROPBOX
		- 3 inverted		 GUBB_Recessed, TRUE
		- 3 normal + text	 GU_GadgetText, GU_LocaleText
		- 3 inverted + text 	 GUBB_Recessed, TRUE, GU_GadgetText

	* Two new routines was created for BEVELBOX_KIND:
		- GU_RefreshBoxes  - redraws all bevel boxes
		- GU_RefreshWindow - redraws the contents of the window and is
		  		     a replacement for GT_RefreshWindow.

	* Changed BEVELBOX_KIND to work better with different fonts.

	* Now diskfont.library is also opened by gadutil.library. If it's not
	  found DiskFontBase is set to NULL, but everything still will work as
	  before.

	* Changed text_width to use OpenDiskFont to make sure that the font is
	  loaded into memory. The font is closed right after it's opened.
	  IntuiTextLength requires that the specified font is in the memory.
	  This sometimes created weird gadgets when changing the font.

	* Created new border types for BEVELBOX_KIND gadgets:

		- BFT_HORIZBAR - A horizontal line with a shadow. The minimum
				required height to make the line look "right"
				is 2 pixels, but a smaller height can be used
				to draw a unshadowed line.

				Can have a text, which is automatically placed
				on the middle of the line's length and starts
				at the line's Y-position + 1, or if the height
				is more than 2 pixels, at the line's Y-pos.

		- BFT_VERTBAR  - A vertical line with a shadow. The minimum
				required width to make the line look "right"
				is 4 pixels, but a smaller value can be used
				to create some weird effects.

		Both of these types can be inverted with GUBB_Recessed, TRUE.

	* Added a RememberKey field in the extra data structure created
	  for the gadgets that are GadUtil gadgets and gadgets using
	  hotkeys. Can be used to allocate some extra data related to that
	  gadget.
 
	* All LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets will now allocate the extra data
	  structure (the RememberKey is needed for the list's nodes).

	* Three flags added for the placement of the text in a bevel box
	  gadget.

		- BB_TEXT_ABOVE - The default text placement. Using this
				flag, the text will be placed at the top
				line of the bevel box. ___Text___

		- BB_TEXT_IN	- The text will be placed so the half of
				the text will be below the top line of the
				bevel box. ---Text---

		- BB_TEXT_BELOW	- The text will be placed below ___    ___
				the top line of the bevel box.     Text

	* A new function created - GU_OpenFont. This routine will open a
	  font using the diskfont.library's OpenDiskFont if diskfont.library
	  was opened when gadutil was loaded into memory. Otherwise graphics
	  library will be used to open the font. Graphics.library can only
	  open fonts that are already loaded into memory and ROM fonts.


	* GU_OpenFont is used internally by text_width, GU_RefreshBoxes
	  and create_layout_gad (.printtext).

	  All files can be opened at the same time.

	* GU_NewList - a new routine that initializes a List structure.

	* GU_ClearList - a new routine that clear a ListView gadget and
	  deallocates all the nodes that belongs to that gadget. All nodes
	  must be allocated with GU_AddTail, or connected to the gadget's
	  gu_RememberKey in any other way (AllocRemember with that key is
	  one way to do it).

	* GU_DetachList - detaches the list from a listview, without
	  deallocating the nodes or clear the gadget. Should be used if
	  you want to change the contents of a ListView gadget, or add a
	  new node to the list.

	* GU_AttachList - reattach the list, or attach a new list to a
	  ListView gadget. This function will also refresh the contents of
	  the gadget.

	* GU_AddTail - Adds a node at the end of a list. This routine will
	  allocate the memory needed for the node structure and the text
	  that will be shown in the ListView (the node's name string). The
	  allocation is done with the gadget's own RememberKey.

	* New tags:
		GU_AddWidChar	- increase the gadget width by ti_Data

		GU_AddHeiLines	- increase the gadget height with ti_Data
				lines

	* Changed GU_AddTopLines and GU_AddHeiLines so that they use the

	* GU_AddTail now returns the pointer to the node, instead of just
	  a TRUE/FALSE value. If there was not enough memory for the node,
	  NULL will be returned. Also, a little bug in GU_AddTail was fixed
	  at this time. The allocated buffer for the string was one byte
	  smaller that it should be.

	* GU_FindNode - New routine that located the node structure for a
	  given node number. This function can be used to read the node's
	  string (LN_NAME) from a list item that was selected by the user.
	  The routine can be used on any list, but if it is used on a list
	  that you do not own (a system list, for example), you must use
	  Forbid() and Permit() while you search and access the node's
	  data.

	* GU_NodeUp - New routine that moves a node one step closer to the
	  beginning of a list. All nodes, except the first node on the
	  list can be moved upwards, and if you try to move first node in
	  the list upwards, nothing will happen.

	* GU_NodeDown - New routine that moves a node one step closer to
	  the end of the list. All nodes, except the one at the end of the
	  list can be moved downwards, and if you try to move the last
	  node in the list downwards, nothing will happen. This routine 
	  actually moves the node below the selected one one step upwards.

	* GU_GetBevelBox - New routine that locates the bevel box's
	  internal structure. The structure can be found in the include
	  file, and should be considered read-only. The structure can be 
	  used to get the box's position and size (useful when you need to
	  center a text for example).

	* Removed the GU_GetBevelBox function and changed the library so
	  that the bevel box's address is saved at the same place as the
	  normal gadget's gadget structures. It is now possible to obtain
	  the bevel box data structure by using the same method as for any
	  other gadget (directly from the LayoutGadget array, or by using
	  GU_GetGadgetPtr), but the bevelbox structure is not linked with
	  any other gadget.

	* Ny version - 36.5

        * Bigfix:

           Om man använde en DRAWER_KIND gadget, och hade gng_Flags satt
           till PLACETEXT_IN eller 0, så gick inte gadgeten att trycka
           på.

           Det verkar som att det var gadgeten som visar texten som inte
           fungerade som den skulle.

           Den gadgeten jag upptäckte buggen med hade ingen text, så därför
           hade jag inte använt GU_Flags. Det fungerade först, men sen när
           jag ändrade ordningen på gadgetarna, så kom en BUTTON_KIND
           före (tidigate var det en TEXT_KIND med PLACETEXT_LEFT).
           Då fungerade det inte alls att trycka på gadgeten.

           Jag antar att det fungerar lika dåligt med IMAGE_KIND och
           FILE_KIND, men jag har inte haft tid att testa.

       * Åtgärd:

           Jag har nu gjort så här med alla specialgadgetar -
           (IMAGE_KIND, DRAWER_KIND och FILE_KIND):

           Ifall att gadgeten inte har någon PLACETEXT(LEFT, RIGHT, ABOVE,
           BELOW), så kommer den att få PLACETEXT_LEFT som default.

           Även om den skulle ha PLACETEXT_IN, så kommer den att bytas
           ut mot PLACETEXT_LEFT.

 950705:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Ny version - 36.53

	* Satte in 3 nya tags och 4 nya flaggor för BEVELBOX_KIND gadgetar.

	  	En av dessa tags måste användas för att aktivera 3D texten:

		- GUBB_3DText		Gör texten som hör till bevelboxen
					3 dimensionell. Lägger till en skugga
					på texten. Skuggan placeras till höger,
					nedanför texten (1 pixel). TRUE/FALSE.

		- GUBB_ShadowColor	Anger vilket färgnummer som ska användas
					för färgen på skuggan.

		- GUBB_ShadowPen	Anger med vilken "penna" skuggan ska
					skrivas med.

		Nya flaggor:

		- BB_SHADOW_DR		Placerar skuggan 1 pixel nedanför texten
					och 1 pixel till höger om den.

		- BB_SHADOW_UR		Placerar skuggan 1 pixel ovanför texten
					och 1 pixel till höger om den.

		- BB_SHADOW_DL		Placerar skuggan 1 pixel nedanför texten
					och 1 pixel till vänster om den.

		- BB_SHADOW_UL		Placerar skuggan 1 pixel ovanför texten
					och 1 pixel till vänster om den.
	  
	* Satte in 13 nya alternativ till flaggor och kombinationer av flaggor:

		- BB_TEXT_ABOVE_CENTER	Placerar texten centrerad ovanför den
					översta kanten av bevel boxen.

		- BB_TEXT_ABOVE_LEFT	Placerar texten vänsterjusterad ovanför
					den översta kanten av bevel boxen.

		- BB_TEXT_ABOVE_RIGHT	Placerar texten högerjusterad ovanför
					den översta kanten av bevel boxen.

		- BB_TEXT_IN_CENTER	Placerar texten centrerad i den
					översta kanten av bevel boxen.

		- BB_TEXT_IN_LEFT	Placerar texten vänsterjusterad i
					den översta kanten av bevel boxen.

		- BB_TEXT_IN_RIGHT	Placerar texten högerjusterad i den
					översta kanten av bevel boxen.

		- BB_TEXT_BELOW_CENTER	Placerar texten centrerad nedanför
					den översta kanten av bevel boxen.

		- BB_TEXT_BELOW_LEFT	Placerar texten vänsterjusterad nedanför
					den översta kanten av bevel boxen.

		- BB_TEXT_BELOW_RIGHT	Placerar texten högerjusterad nedanför
					den översta kanten av bevel boxen.

		- BB_SUNAT_UL		Samma som BB_SHADOW_DR

		- BB_SUNAT_DL		Samma som BB_SHADOW_UR

		- BB_SUNAT_UR		Samma som BB_SHADOW_DL

		- BB_SUNAT_DR		Samma som BB_SHADOW_UL

	  Totalt ger de nya taggarna (för skuggtyp) 460 olika typer av bevel
	  boxar:

		10 utan text (5 grundtyper, invertering)
		90 med text, utan skugga
		90 med text, skugga nedanför till höger
		90 med text, skugga nedanför till vänster
		90 med text, skugga ovanför till höger
		90 med text, skugga ovanför till vänster

	* En ny tag kan skickas till GU_LayoutGadgetsA. Den här taggen
	  fungerar på samma sätt som GU_RightExtreme/GU_LowerExtreme, men
	  är för IDCMP flaggor istället. Resultatet är alla IDCMP flaggor
	  som minst måste användas för att alla gadgets ska fungera. Det
	  går bra att skicka in en pekare till de IDCMP flaggor som redan
	  är inställda (IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW och andra).
	  
	* Några andra interna ändringar:

		- Gjorde en subrutin av lite kod (som används 4 gånger)

		- Gjorde en subrutin av den del av den del av den rutinen
		  som skriver ut bevelboxens titel. Används för att kunna
		  skriva ut titelns skugga.

	* Ny version - 36.55

	* Gjorde en ny gadget typ: PROGRESS_KIND. Alla PROGRESS_KIND
	  gadgetar allokeras i en rememberkey. Begränsningarna på den
	  här gadgeten är beroende av hur bred gadgeten är. Gadgetens
	  aktiva värde (pg_Current) får inte vara större än 4.294.967.295/
	  bredden på gadgeten. Det högsta tillåtna (pg_Current) värdet för
	  en 410 pixel bred progress gadget är 10.737.418. Om man försöker
	  sätta pg_Current till ett värde som är större än pg_Total, ställs
	  gadgeten så att den visar 100% (pg_Total).

	  Tags:
		GUPR_FillPen   - Anger vilken "penna" som ska användas för
				 att fylla upp till pg_Current/pg_Total
				 sätts till FILLPEN om taggen inte används.

		GUPR_FillColor - Anger vilket färgnummer som ska användas
				 för att fylla upp till pg_Current/pg_Total
				 Förvalt värde är färgen på FILLPEN.
				 Ignoreras om GUPR_FillPen används.

		GUPR_BackPen   - Anger vilken "penna" som ska användas för
				 att fylla bakgrunden av gadgeten. Sätts
				 till BACKGROUNDPEN om taggen inte används.

		GUPR_BackColor - Anget vilket färgnummer som ska användas
				 för att fylla bakgrunden av gadgeten.
				 Förvalt värde är färgen på BACKGROUNDPEN.
				 Ignoreras om GUPR_BackPen används.

		GUPR_Current   - Det värde gadgeten ska få då den tillverkas.
				 Uppdateras automatiskt genom användandet av
				 GU_RefreshWindow. Förvalt värde är 0.

		GUPR_Total     - Det värde som motsvarar 100% av gadgetens
				 längd. Förvalt värde är 100.

	* GU_UpdateProgress - Ny rutin för att rita om en PROGRESS_KIND
	  gadget av någon anledning (nytt Total el. Current värde).
	  Behövs ej användas om man använder någon av rutinerna
	  GU_RefreshWindow (vid öppning av fönster) eller GU_RefreshBoxes

	  det viktigaste är med iallafall. En del av förklaringarna på
	  funktionerna kan eventuellt förbättras..

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960106" "Changes 06-Jan-96"
 960106:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Ny version - 36.59

	* Fixade en liten bugg som gjorde att GU_AutoWidth, GU_AdjustLeft och
	  GU_AdjustRight räknade lite fel (underscore tecknet räknades in i
	  bredden på texten).

	* Satte in en ny funktion som sorterar en eller två listor.

	* Satte in fyra nya nya konstanter i include filerna för minimal
	  storlek på FILE_KIND och DRAWER_KIND gadgets.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960107" "Changes 07-Jan-96"
 960107:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Gjorde så att GU_MinimumIDCMP får med IDCMP_VANILLAKEY eller
	  IDCMP_RAWKEY beroende på den hotkey man valt för gadgeten.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960120" "Ändringar 20-Jan-96"
 960120:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Ändrade PROGRESS_KIND så att den kan använda GU_GadgetText och
	  GU_LocaleText.

	* Använder skärmens font för all gadget text om inget annat anges
	  med GU_DefTextAttr eller GU_TextAttr.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960224" "Ändringar 24-Feb-96"
 960224:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Ny version - 36.60

	* Använder skärmens font för all gadget text om inget annat anges
	  med GU_DefTextAttr eller GU_TextAttr. Buggfix från v36.59.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960429" "Changes 29-Apr-96"
 960429:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Ny version - 37.0

	* Satte in en ny funktion som kollar version.revision i ett library
	  eller en device.

	* Satte in två nya tags: GU_FractWidth och GU_FractHeight.
	  Används för att t.ex tillverka två gadgets som är lika breda
	  nedanför en annan. Negativt ti_Data multiplicerar gadgetens
	  bredd med ti_Data, positivt värde dividerar bredden med ti_Data.

	* Fixade lite buggar i include filerna för 'C' (oavslutade
	  kommentarer). Fixade en bugg som lyckats komma tillbaka i
	  BetterTest.c. Sista instruktionen i programmet ska vara
	  GU_ReplyIMsg(imsg), inte GT_ReplyIMsg(imsg).

	* Satte in stöd för StormC i installations scriptet och include-
	  installeraren. Gjorde ordlista för editorn i StormC, så att
	  de ord (funktioner, tags, konstanter) som hör till GadUtil
	  visas i andra färger.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960501" "Changes 01-May-96"
 960501:
 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.1

	* Fixed the bug in the IMAGE_KIND gadgets. The normal image was not
          displayed right if you used multiple colors.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960502" "Changes 02-May-96"
 960502:
 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.2

	* Started programming in StormC. Found a couple of bugs in the
          include files. Fixed.

        * Included an example in C. It uses PROGRESS_KIND gadget and
          8-color gadgets.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960510" "Changes 10-May-96"
 960510:
 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.3

	* Some enforcer hits fixed in the part that checks GU_AdjustLeft
	  and GU_AdjustRight tags.

	* GU_ClearWindow - New function that clears/fills the inner part of
	  a window with a given color.

	* GU_SizeWindow - New function that is a replacement for the intuition
	  functions SizeWindow, MoveWindow and ChangeWindowBox. If the window
	  will fit on the screen, this function works as SizeWindow, otherwise
	  it will try to move the window to make it possible to resize it.

	* Bug fix in assembly includes "Malformatted line..."

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960513" "Changes 13-May-96"
 960513:
 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.4

	* Created a new gadget kind: LABEL_KIND. This gadget kind is used
	  to place text relative to other gadgets, bevel boxes, and other
	  texts. Can use the same type of shadows that the text for the
	  bevel box.

	* Implemented a new function in the library: GU_CloseFont. Works
	  like graphics CloseFont, but takes the parameter in A0 instead
	  of A1.

	* Wrote a new document, "GadUtil.index", that have a list over all
	  gadutil functions, sorted by what they do. There are also some
	  shortcuts to all tags for gadutil's own gadget kinds.

	* Created two new flags for BEVELBOX_KIND and LABEL_KIND:
	  BB_3DTEXT - can be used as a replacement for GUBB_3DText, TRUE
	  LB_3DTEXT - can be used as a replacement for GULB_3DText, TRUE

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960514" "Changes 14-May-96"
 960514:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Replaced the list sort routine with a new one that sorts better.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960515" "Changes 15-May-96"
 960515:
 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.5

	* A little bug in the PROGRESS_KIND gadget was fixed. A division by zero was done
	  if the progress gadget was set to show x/0 (also 0/0).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960529" "Changes 29-May-96"
 960529:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Two new constants created for the include files: GADUTIL_VER and GADUTIL_REV.
	  Can be useful together with the function GU_CheckVersion to check the version
	  of GadUtil.

	* Changes in almost all test (demo) programs. The FPF_DISKFONT flag in the TextAttr
	  structure was unset for all demo programs. Replaced the manual version check, in
	  the programs that checked the version, to GadUtil's own function GU_CheckVersion.

	* Removed unnecessary IDCMP flags from the demo programs, and replaced all GadTools
	  IDCMP flags with the tag GU_MinimumIDCMP.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960612" "Changes 12-Jun-96"
 960612:
 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.6

	* gu_Active in the structure that gg_UserData points to was not updated
	  when using any routine that used GU_SetGadgetAttrsA(). Now it checks
	  the gu_Active value to see if it is out of the gadget's limits. This
	  check is done a bit different depending on the gadget type:

	  CYCLE_KIND, LISTVIEW_KIND:
		The selected value is set to max if it is greater than the
		maximum allowed value. LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets can have an empty
		list attached, and the selected value will then be set to -1 (no
		selected entry).

	  SCROLLER_KIND:
		The selected value is set to Total-Visible if it is greater than
		the maximum allowed value.

	  SLIDER_KIND:
		The selected value is set to max if it is greater than the
		maximum allowed value. If it is less than the minimum allowed
		value, it will be set to the min value.

	* gng_Flags and gng_GadgetText is now cleared before creation of every
	  new gadget.

	* The LAYOUTA_Spacing tag for LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets is now used to
	  determine the height of the gadget. If the height of a gadget should
	  be about 4 lines (GU_HeightFactor, 4), the height of the gadget is
	  calculated to 4*(font height+value of LAYOUTA_Spacing tag). The same
	  method is used for the GU_AddHeiLines tag.

	* Hotkeys for LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets works as they should again. In v37.5
	  of GadUtil (and probably some earlier ones), the listview didn't scroll
	  down when you selected the next entry.

	* Inserted pragmas and prototypes for tagcalls (pragmas only for SAS/C).
	  It is possible to create stub routines for the tagcalls for other
	  compilers by using fd2pragma 2.0.

	* Inserted links to the include files in the index file for GadUtil.guide.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960712" "Changes 12-Jul-96"
 960712:
 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.7

	* Bug fix in the prototype for GU_ChangeStr (two parameters was mixed up).

	* GU_ChangeStr now works for both STRING_KIND and TEXT_KIND gadgets. If the
	  gadget isn't a STRING or TEXT gadget this function does nothing.

	* Bug fix in GU_CoordsInGadBox function. The register D3 was trashed in all
	  earlier versions of GU.

	* gu_Active in the extra data structure now contains a pointer to the current
	  string in a STRING_KIND or TEXT_KIND gadget. gu_Active is also used by the
	  INTEGER_KIND and the NUMBER_KIND gadgets to store the current value.

	* Three new tags allows any STRING or TEXT_KIND gadget to show a (localized)
	  help text for each gadget in the window. These tags also works with the
	  special gadgets (BEVELBOX, LABEL, PROGRESS). The gadgets attached to the
	  window is scanned in sequential order. If a BEVELBOX_KIND gadget matches
	  the pointer position, this gadget's help string will have the lowest
	  priority. If another BEVELBOX is found inside this, the help string for
	  that one will be used if there is no gadget inside that box. The help text
	  can alternatively be shown in the window's or screen's title.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "960715" "Changes 15-Jul-96"
 960715:
 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.8

	* Some bug fixes in the new help functions. If 0 was used as data on a GU_HelpText
	  tag with a gadget that shows the help text in the window's or screen's title,
	  there were some enforcer hits

	* Deleted the separate autodoc files. Appended some information on the contents of
	  the GU_Public structure to the autodocs. More info about SCRTITLE_HELP and
	  WINTITLE_HELP was also appended.

	* Changed the help function so that all gadgets and title bars that are used to
	  display help strings is cleared if the mouse pointer is outside all gadgets that
	  have help texts.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "961222" "Changes 22-Dec-96"
 961222:
 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.9

	* 6 new tags added for the help functions. It is now possible to set a default
	  help text that will be shown if no gadget is under the pointer.

	  GU_DefWTitle		- default window title
	  GU_DefLocWTitle	- localized window title
	  GU_DefSTitle		- default screen title
	  GU_DefLocSTitle	- localized screen title
	  GU_DefHelpText	- default help text
	  GU_DefLocHelpText	- localized help text

	* A little bug removed from the help routines. Versions beore 37.9 could
          display two different help text at the same time (in different gadgets or
	  the screen or window title).

	* A new include file is included in the distribution now. Now it should be
	  possible to compile the examples with older versions of the system include
	  files (OS 2.0x includes are supported now)

	* A third archive with the HTML version of the GadUtil documentation is
	  included in the distribution now. Also included with this archive is some
	  pictures of applications using GadUtil.

	* The distribution has changed a bit, resulting in that the archive with all
	  files became smaller (developer archive only).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "970810" "Changes 10-Aug-97"
 970810:
 ~~~~~~~
	* Internal version 37.9a

	* Changed the GU_NoCreate tag, so that it works with single gadgets too.

	* Internal version 37.9b

	* 6 new tags to store position, size and the bottom corner of a gadget in
	  an external variable.

		GU_StoreLeft,	GU_StoreTop,	GU_StoreWidth,	GU_StoreHeight
		GU_StoreRight,	GU_StoreBottom

	  takes a pointer to a word as a parameter

@ENDNODE

@NODE "970928" "Changes 28-Sep-97"
 970928:
 ~~~~~~~
	* New version - 37.10

	* Just felt it was time to bump the revision and make a release again... :)

	* New for the distribution is include files for E

@NODE "Later" "A list of possible future enhancements"
@TOC "MAIN"
 Later:
 ~~~~~~
		 Ideas for later versions of GadUtil.library
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

		**************************************************
		*  THIS LIST IS UNSORTED. EVERYTHING WRITTEN     *
		*  HERE CAN/WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE ORDER ANY *
		*  OF US DECIDES TO IMPLEMENT IT IN.             *
		*  ALL NEW IDEAS IS IN FIRST IN THE LIST.        *
		**************************************************

	* Make GU_CreateBevelBoxA possible to handle more kinds of
	  bevel boxes.

	* Create a GU_GetGadgetAttrsA that works on v37.

	* Write include files and test programs for other programming
	  languages. The possible additions are:
		- Oberon  ( Oberon 1.4ß is almost PD (GNU) )
		- Modula2 ( Amiga Turbo Modula-2 v1.0d (demoversion 2k) )
		- Pascal  ( HiSoft Pascal)
		- E       ( v3.0e demoversion, 32k exe)

	* Make it possible to let GadUtil open asl-requesters by itself
	  by using some new tags for the FILE_KIND and DRAWER_KIND gadgets.
		- Possibly new tag for FILE_KIND: GUFI_AslTags 
		- Possibly new tag for DRAWER_KIND: GUDR_AslTags

	* Create a new built-in IMAGE_KIND gadget. This gadget will open the
	  font requester, screenmode requester, or just send a IDCMP_GADGETUP.
	  The name of if will probably be "SELECT_KIND".
		- Tag to send font requester tags:    GUSE_FontTags
		- Tag to send scrmode requester tags: GUSE_ScrModeTags

	* Create something that allows easy creation of a lot of gadgets at
	  the same time (e.g. 5 rows with 4 gadgets in each row, or 50 gadgets
	  on 6 rows). When using this function, the passed in GadgetID will be
	  used for the first gadget. For all later created gadgets this ID will
	  be incremented by one.

	* Make GU_AdjustLeft, GU_AdjustRight and GU_AdjustBottom work with
	  MX-kind gadgets.

	* Implement BOOPSI look for IMAGE_KIND gadgets with two images.

	* Fix that little annoying memory leak when changing the image of a
	  IMAGE_KIND gadget.
	  
	* Make it possible to change the "selected" image in a IMAGE_KIND
	  gadget with two images.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "NewRoutines" "Something to remember when any of us are writing something new"
@TOC "MAIN"

    * Allocate memory for all tag lists and variables. I have used the
      stack for small tag lists (less than 4 tags). An example of using
      stack as a tag list is in GU_RefreshBoxes.

    * Change version in all include files when the revision is bumped.

    * Change all include files when a new tag or function is created.
      The files that needs to be changed is:

	  New functions:
		- clib/gadutil_protos.h		(insert at the end of the file)
		- FD/gadutil_lib.fd	    	(insert at the end of the file)
		- libraries/gadutil_lib.i	(insert at the end of the file)

	  New tags and constants:
		- libraries/gadutil.h		(insert in the right group of values)
		- libraries/gadutil.i		(insert in the right group of values)

	  No changes needed:
		- proto/gadutil.h

    * Write in the most (or all ?) changes in the library in this file.
      Very small changes isn't so important, but things like new tags,
      new functions, bug fixes may be documented here.

    * Write new ideas and maybe short descriptions of how they can be
      implemented in the <A HREF="later.html"> Later </A> node.

    * This file will not be included with the distribution, so it can
      be used to write anything (which has something to do with the
      library) in.

      Some parts of this file will maybe be in the final distribution
      since it documents a lot of tags, functions and bug fixes.

      Well... it seems like it needs to be included anyway... :)

    * Fill in new things to remember when creating new functions and tags
      in this node.
