                Quick usage instructuins for FlexCat v1.4
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Included source description files:
        Asm-One_Data.sd - for Asm-One and other assemblers
        Lattice_Data.sd - for SAS/C and with some or no modifications
                           for other C compilers

    Usage examples:
        "anyprogram.cd"   is the Catalog Description file for the program
        "ram:mytest.s"    is the created source file

        All files is on ram: and new files are stored here.

    Create source file (for built-in language strings) asm:
        FlexCat ram:anyprogram.cd ram:mytest.s=ASM-One_Data.sd

    Create source file (for built-in language strings) C:
        FlexCat ram:anyprogram.cd ram:mytest.c=Lattice_Data.sd

    Create an empty .ct file:
        FlexCat ram:anyprogram.cd NEWCTFILE ram:anyprogram.ct

        Don't forget to translate the program. You must also fill in the
        version of the catalog and the name of the language you are creating
        a translation for (these fields are in the beginning of the .ct file).

    Create a new .ct file (to continue with an old translation):
	FlexCat ram:anyprogram.cd ram:anyprogram.ct NEWCTFILE ram:anyprogram_new.ct

    Create the .catalog file:
        flexcat ram:anyprogram.cd ram:anyprogram.ct CATALOG ram:anyprogram.catalog

    Place the .catalog file in Locale:Catalogs/<language>/ directory and change
    the locale prefs to the language you just created. The Catalogs directory
    can also be placed in the programs home director.

    Read the full documentation to this program if you want to know more about
    .ct, .cd, .sd and .catalog files.
