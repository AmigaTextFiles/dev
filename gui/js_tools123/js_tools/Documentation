                      the js_tools.library 1.23

                      for amiga os 2.0 or better

                       free to copy and to use


Overview

  The  js_tools.library  has some nice features that make live easier.
In  this  current release this is a very good and fast listview gadget
and some things around it.


Features

  listview:

   - most important was the same behavior and looking like the OS3.0
     original - and it does!

   for programmer:

   - to program like the gadtools listview 
   - easy for programmers to realize a (own) keyboard interface
     with special functions (like showing the selected line with only
     1 call and minimized scrolling)
   - special function for listview keyboard interface (simply give
     it the key, the gadget and the IntuiMessage)
   - looks like the OS3.0 listview
   - mark lines (only by the program or by the user with SHIFT key
     or always)
   - Super Listview allows horizontal scrolling to show long lines
   - easy column managment done be the library
   - callback hook to manipulate the output (in style, colour,
     graphic and ore)
   - automatic text fit for information texts
   - lvExtraWindow generates a listview in an own window that is
     controlled by the library (resize, update, refresh, etc)
   - special "AskTags" that allow to get information more special
     than the GetAttributes way
   - a GetGadgetAttrsA() of OS3.0 to get information

   - and all of the gadtools listview features 

   for users:  
   
   - easy multiselect with SHIFT + LEFT_MOUSE or simply with
     MIDDLE_MOUSE
   - faaast scroll mode if user moves the mouse above or below
     listview box and moves it slowly left or right (same in
     super listview)
   - standard keyboard interface behavior  
   - gadtools listview 3.0 looking
   - clear looking listviews (with more than 1 column)
   - help texts in a extra window (lvExtraWindow) because they are
     easy to make by the programmer

   - QuickSort for Lists (usefull in listview)


Licenses

  The  js_tools.library is copyright (c) 1995 by J.Schmitz. It is free
to  copy  and  to use. You MUST NOT change anything in the distributed
archive.   It  is  allowed  to  copy  the  (unpacked)  archive  to  PD
collections (disks or CD).

  Feel  free  to use it and make nice programs with it. This is why it
was  made.  If  your program need it put it into your distribution but
tell  your  users  that you use it (e.g. in your doc file, info box or
copy  this  documentation).  And  don't  forget  to  tell them the new
features (look in features/for users list).

  It  it no replacement for other gadget systems (exept their listview
of  course).  If  you  like send my some (nice) results or presents or
money - or simply a mail... :-)


Install

  Click  the "INSTALL" script. If will run the commodore Installer and
make everything for you.


Use

  To  use  the library you can find the C includes (for SAS/C) and the
unit  source  for  Kick-Pascal.  Copy  the  C includes to your include
directory.  The  KP  unit source has to be compiled first and you have
to  copy  "lvHookCode.o"  to  your UNITs directory. Then it may simply
used  by  "uses  js_tools"  putting  into  your  programs. It has some
additional things - I hope you know how to use them....

  The  version  for  exec/OpenLibrary()  is 37 - like all others OS2.0
libraries.  Some  features  are  currently PRIVATE. So don't use them
until they are official released.

  If  you  want to see this library in action look out for BARNEY, the
famous Fido filelist viewer.


Future plans

  better lvExtraWindow
  graphical readonly listview
  lvExtraWindow with button gadgets like easy requesters
  special help window with posibility to print the text out (?)
  memory handing system to
    allow memory pools in OS2.0 and 3.0 by one function
    free all memory of a program by remembering all allocated memory
  requester tools (filerequester, fontrequester & co would be nice
    with this listview)

                    LV_KeyHandler() had wrong pragma in includes!
                    some other bug fixes in C includes :-(
                    LV_KeyHandler() didn't call LV_GetListViewAttrsA()
                     so tags were not changed :-(

                    added assembler includes


The  library  revision  of  each version could be equal or higher than
shown here because of some later small changes or bug fixes.
