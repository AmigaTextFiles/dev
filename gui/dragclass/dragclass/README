This is the first beta-version of my drag&drop gadget BOOPSI class. It is not as
functional as I would like to have it, but I have not enough time to complete it
in the next weeks. For now it is only possible to define single gadgets and get
the target coordinates of drop actions.

This software is a beta-version, so you use it at your own risk! The author can
not be made responsible for any damage which is caused by using it.

I have tested it (not very much) on an A3000 with kickstart v40 and v37. There
is still no documentation, so look at draggadget.h and dragtest.c (gcc-source) to
see how to use it. If you create a gadget of this class, you have to specify
DGA_Window OR DGA_Screen, whether you want the resulting bob to be moveable only
within a window or the full screen. The field gadget->SpecialInfo points to a
DragInfo structure (see draggadget.h). There you find the target coordinates
after receiving IDCMP_GADGETUP.

Limitations:
- For now the images specified by GA_Image and GA_SelectRender have to be
  "conventional" (not BOOPSI) images (ImageData must be an array of Depth
  bitplanes).

known bugs:
- the display is locked by LockLayers() while a bob is displayed. That means
  i.e. if your are dragging a gadget on a public screen and Intuition tries to
  open a window, a deadlock occurs.
- the background color of bobs is transparent.

TODO:
- DragGroups to simplify shift-select
- definition of target gadgets and windows
- possibility to have different images for gadget and bob.

This version of drag.gadget is "e-mail ware"; if you write a program which uses
it, i'd like to know that. My address is:
