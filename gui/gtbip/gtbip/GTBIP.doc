1. INTRODUCTION

  If  like  me  you use GadToolsBox (GTB) to design Graphic User
Interfaces  (GUI's) for your application programs then you might
find this program of some use.

  The one thing I really HATE about GTB is the big icons that it
saves  when  I  save  my GUI's.  I thought it would be nice if I
could  use  my  own  "default  gui icon" instead of the horrible
aforementioned one.  The problem is this though..

  The icon file is built into the GTB executable.  This makes it
impossible to change without a lot of mucking about.

  So, I decided to DisAssemble GTB and have a looksee if I could
do  something  about  it.   thus was born GadToolsBox Icon Patch
(GTBIP) (yeah, I know, I'm a sucker for acronyms).

  Please  note  that  this  program  is  FreeWare so there is no
guarantee  that  it  won't  cook yer hd, blah blah, etc, and all
that jumbo :)


	********************************************************


2. REQUIREMENTS

In order to run the GTBIP program you will need the following...

- KickStart V39+

- ReqTools library V38+

- opal/9 font

	********************************************************

3. USING THE PROGRAM

  For  this  patch  program  to work you will need to check that
your  GTB  executable is the correct version and size.  The only
accepted version and size is..

$VER:	GadToolsBox 37.312 ( 7/06/93)
SIZE:	359592 bytes

  Use the CLI commands "C:Version" and "C:List" to get the above
information.   If you did not know this then you should probably
not be attempting to patch your GTB executable.

  If  by some chance your version of GTB does not meet the above
requirements  don't worry, You can EMail me and I am sure we can
sort  something out so you too can have your own beautiful icons
for your GUI files.

  NOTE!  DO NOT ATTACH YOUR GTB EXECUTABLE IN EMAIL TO ME UNLESS
PREVIOUSLY  ARRANGED!!  I WILL GET UPSET IF I START GETTING TENS
OR HUNDREDS OF 200KB+ EMAILS CONTAINING THE SAME VERSION!!

  If  you  got this far then you can run the patch program.  The
GUI   contains   several  buttons  and  string  gadgets.   their
functions are..


"Executable" string gadget

  Type the full path and filename of your GTB executable file
  here  (the  one that will get patched)..  Use the "get" button
  on the right to select the path/name with a nice requester.


"Backup To" string gadget

  Type  the  full  path  and  filename of your backup file.  The
  backup  file  will  be  saved  unmodified  in case you want to
  revert  to  your  old  version  of  GTB  or  if something goes
  horribly wrong.  If you leave this gadget empty then NO BACKUP
  WILL  BE  SAVED!!  Use the "get" button on the right to select
  the path/name with a nice requester.


"Def Icon" string gadget

  Type  the full path and filename of the icon that you want GTB
  to use from now on.  The best place to have the icon is in the
  "ENV:GadToolsBox/"  directory,  but  you  can  select  any old
  place.   Use  the  "get"  button  on  the  right to select the
  path/name with a nice requester.


"Patch" button gadget

  Click here to start the patching :)


"About" button gadget

  Click here for propoganda :)


"Quit" button gadget

  Click  here  when  your'e  done (or you could opt to click the
  closewindow gadget).

5. HISTORY

v1.0 (2.9.1998)

- First public release.

- Fixed  small  problem that caused  the program to hog more CPU
  time than it should.  It was really a bug in GTASMGen that was
  generating the offending code.
