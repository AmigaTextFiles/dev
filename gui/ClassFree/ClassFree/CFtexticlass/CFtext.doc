Author:              Anders E. Andersen <andersa@fys.ku.dk>
Superclass:          imageclass
Desciption:          A simple text outputting image.
Include File:        CFtexti.h


New methods:
------------

 None


Changed Methods:
----------------

OM_NEW
OM_SET - Passes all attributes to respective superclasses.
Important is that they set an internal layout flags so the image
is re-layouted next time IM_DRAW is called.

IM_HITTEST - If the coordinates recieved in the message is outside
the imame dimensions as defined by the fields of the image structure,
then this method returns FALSE, else it returns TRUE.
 This is a slight change from imageclass, which doesn't include the
edges of the image when it determines wether the point is within the
image. This doesn't really make sence for text, which hasn't got
edges.


IM_DRAW - Uses graphics.library's Text() to print the string
pointed to by the IA_Data attribute in the RastPort passed
in the message, at the x and y offset and in the state provided in
the message.


Attributes:
-----------

IA_Left, IA_Top

Decides where the text is displayed, together with
the offsets provided in the message.

IA_Height

Set to the rastports TxHeight by CFtexticlass, at every IM_DRAW
method issued. IM_HITTEST needs it to determine if the
image was hit.
This means that this attribute is controlled by the class and it
is meaningless to set it.


IA_Width

Determines the boundery in pixels the text output must be
contained widthin. An area this wide and with the provided
rastports TxHeight attributes height is cleared with
BltPattern(), before the text is displayed. So if you change
the string to a shorter one, the old text is erased when the
new text is written.


IA_Data

Must point to a standard NULL terminated C string.


IA_FGPen, IA_BGPen

Controls the rendering pens. Text is rendered in IA_FGPen and
background fill is rendered in IA_BGPen.
They are switched when the drawing state is IDS_SELECTED.
These attribute can be overrided by supplying IA_Pens or
setting imp_DrInfo in the IM_DRAW message.


IA_Pens

Takes a pointer to a ~0 terminated array of pen
specifications. Supplying this will change the rendering
scheme somewhat. When the state is IDS_NORMAL, text is
rendered with TEXTPEN and the background is filled with
BACKGROUNDPEN. With state IDS_SELECTED, the text is rendered
using FILLTEXTPEN and background using FILLPEN.
This attribute can be overrided by setting imp_DrInfo in the
IM_DRAW message.


IA_Outline

Boolean. Adds an extra pixel to the top of the text. This
makes the text look more like the menu item text fields.
Defaults to TRUE.

CFTI_PosFlags

Takes one of three flags as ti_Data value. It controls
the text alignment inside the IA_Width restraint.

TIPOS_CENTER  - Centers the text.
TIPOS_LEFT    - Aligns the text to the left.
TIPOS_RIGHT   - Aligns to the right.
