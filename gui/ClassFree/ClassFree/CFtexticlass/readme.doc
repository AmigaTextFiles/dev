 CFtext.image

 A BOOBSI image class subclass

----------------------------------


Description:
------------

 This is very simple image class that outputs text with certain
attributes. It is used in various ClassFree BOOPSI gadgets.
 It works as the line entries in a listview, filling or clearing
the entire line every time it is drawn.

Usage:
------

 Just pass a standard null terminated C string in the IA_Data
and specify the width and position and you can render the
text with DrawImage() or DrawImageState(). Or if you are doing
a BOOPSI class, use IM_DRAW.
 You can also justify the text inside the image box with the
CFTI_TextPos attribute.
