 CFbutton.gadget

 A usefull button gadget.

--------------------------------------


Description:
------------

 The button gadgets already in intuition leaves a
lot to be desired. Thus this small button gadget
attempts to correct that by offering automatic
filling, 3D-edges and a fairly complex layout engine.

Usage:
------

 You can easily get simple buttons just by providing
a text argument to GA_Text and setting the positioning
attributes GA_Left, GA_Top, GA_Width and GA_Height.
 However this gadget contains a special layout engine
that makes it possible to display images along with the
text to make f.x. browser navigation buttons quite
easily.


Requirements:
-------------

 - AmigaOS 2.04

 - CFtext.image must be installed.
