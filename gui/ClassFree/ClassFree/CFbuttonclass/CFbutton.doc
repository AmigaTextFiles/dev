Changed Methods:
----------------

GM_HITTEST - Allways returns GMR_GADGETHIT

GM_GOACTIVE - Sets gadget flag GFLG_SELECTED, renders
gadget and returns GMR_MEACTIVE.

GM_HANDLEINPUT - Handles gadget rendering according to
mouse movements, checks for gadget abort in two ways,
MENUDOWN and SELECTUP with mousepointer outside gadget.
Also checks for GACT_RELVERIFY to see if IDCMP_GADGETUP
should be sent. It clears GFLG_SELECTED when mouse is
outside the select box and sets it again if the mouse
reenters the select box.
As long as GFLG_SELECTED is set the object sends itself
OM_NOTIFY messages for every IECLASS_TIMER event that
GM_HANDLEINPUT gets. For all these messages the
OPUF_INTERIM flag is set in opu_Flags and the GA_ID
attribute is in opu_AttrList.


GM_GOINACTIVE - If GFLG_SELECTED is set, it clears it,
renders the gadget and sends itself an OM_NOTIFY message
with OPUF_INTERIM cleared and the GA_ID attribute in
opu_AttrList.


Attributes:
-----------

 All attributes are passed directly to gadgetclass. The
following attributes are used by CFbuttonclass:

GA_Left, GA_Top, GA_Width, GA_Height

 Positions and sizes the button.


GA_Text

 NULL terminated C string. See CFBU_Layout for display control.


GA_Image

 Excepts a plain Intuition or custom (BOOPSI) image object as
data value. It is sent to the superclass, which means the value
is stored in Gadget.GadgetRender.
 Positioning depends on the CFBU_Layout attribute.


GA_RelVerify

 Determines if IDCMP_GADGETUP messages should be sent.


GA_Border

 Boolean. If TRUE, 3D button edges are drawn. If FALSE,
the drawing pass is skipped entirely (no fill!).
 GA_Image and GA_Text still works though.
 Defaults to TRUE. Overrides the gadgetclass definition.


GA_Highlight

 Boolean. If TRUE, the gadget internals are complemented
when selected. Actually it is filled with FILLPEN. If FALSE,
the gadget is just drawn as being down.
 If GA_Border is set to false, this attribute is ignored.
 Defaults to TRUE. Overrides the gadgetclass definition.


CFBU_Layout

 Takes various flags as the data argument. With this attribute
it is possible to have easy control over image and text
positioning in the button.

 The flags are:

 LAYOUT_AUTO     - No flags set. Text is centered and image
                   is positioned via its own LeftEdge and
                   TopEdge attributes (IA_Left and IA_Top).

 LAYOUT_TXTLEFT  -
 LAYOUT_TXTRIGHT - Left/right justifies the button text.

 LAYOUT_IMGABOVE - This will change the images LeftEdge and
                   TopEdge values (IA_Left and IA_Top) to
                   position the image in the top-center of the
                   button.
                   If a text label is given, it is automatically
                   positioned at the bottom of the button.

 LAYOUT_IMGBELOW - This flag works just opposide of
                   LAYOUT_IMGABOVE and is overrided if that
                   flag is set.

 LAYOUT_IMGLEFT  -
 LAYOUT_IMGRIGHT - Together with LAYOUT_IMGABOVE or
                   LAYOUT_IMGBELOW these flags move the image
                   to the far left or right instead of centering
                   them. The image is still positioned in the top
                   or buttom of the gadget.
                   If LAYOUT_IMGABOVE or LAYOUT_IMGBELOW is not
                   set the the image is left or right justified
                   but centered in the button. This will also
                   position the text in the empty space to the
                   right of the image if LAYOUT_IMGLEFT is set
                   and to the left of the image if
                   LAYOUT_IMGRIGHT is set. The text can still be
                   left or right justified or it can remain
                   centered in this space. An example of how this
                   works can be seen in the CFpumbutton.gadget.
                   The triangle image is given via GA_Image, and
                   CFBU_Layout has LAYOUT_IMGLEFT|LAYOUT_TXTLEFT
                   set.

 LAYOUT_IMGREL   - Setting this flag will position the image
                   relative to the buttons GA_Left and GA_Top
                   attributes, instead of the top/left of the
                   rastport. Not usefull together with the other
                   image layout flags, as they control the image
                   position with absolute values.
