 CFpumbutton.gadget

 A popup/pulldown menu button

--------------------------------------


Description:
------------

 This gadget is meant to replace the cycle gadget of gadtools.
With expirience many users and programmers have found that the
cycle gadget of gadtools is rather annoying to use. It can take
a while to cycle through the selections and if you miss the one
you want, you have to find the shift key on the keyboard to get
back again.. :)
 Thus this device (BOOPSI gadget :) seeks to correct this problem
by offering a simple pull down menu where all the possibilities
are easily visible.


Usage:
------

 A couple of special notes for this gadget. This gadget allways
returns an IDCMP_GADGETUP message when a new selection is made.
It ignores GFLG_RELVERIFY and no other kinds of massages are
sent. This behavior may change though.


Requirements:
-------------

  - AmigaOS 2.04

  - CFtext.image and CFglyph.image must be installed.
