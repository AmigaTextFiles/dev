New Methods:
------------

None


Changed Methods:
----------------

OM_NEW - Overrides GA_Height, GA_Image, GA_Text and
CFBU_Layout (from CFbutton.gadget) attributes.

GM_GOACTIVE - Activates the button gadget by calling the
supermethod, and opens a window in which it draws the
possible selections (using CFtexticlass).

GM_HANDLEINPUT - Checks if the pointer is over one of
the images by cycling through them, calling IM_HITTEST
for each image. It remembers which string is currently
selected so it doesn't have to redraw all of them when
the selection changes. Completely overrides the
supermethod.


GM_GOINACTIVE - Frees text images and closes the menu
window, it then calls the supermethod.
