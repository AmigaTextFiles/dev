 CFscroller.gadget

 A GadTools SCROLLER_KIND replacement.

--------------------------------------


Description:
------------

 This gadgetclass is meant to offer the same features
as the GadTools SCROLLER_KIND gadget but in a properly
intuition integrated way.


Usage:
------

 The scroller is positioned with the GA_Left and GA_Top
attributes.
 The sizing is done in a special way.
 When you ask for a FREEVERT scroller you have to pass
the height in GA_Height. GA_Width will be ignored. The
width is instead determined by the CFSC_Size attribute.
 For FREEHORIZ scrollers it is the other way around.
 The IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE of the GadTools scroller gadget is
not supported, instead you can get IDCMP_IDCMPUPDATE
messages with the ICA_TARGET attribute.


Requirements:
-------------

  - AmigaOS 2.04


Notes:
------

 It was originally my first BOOPSI gadget and so it was
rather lamely coded. With V0.60 a complete rewrite was done
to make it more system friendly.
 I tried to make the class as modular as possible. The
skeleton of this class could after this rewrite be modified
slightly to make a groupgadget class which would superseed
the build-in intuition groupgadget class in functionality.
 This could result in a third rewrite of this class,
again going back to the groupgadget principle, but with my
own groupgadget this time...
