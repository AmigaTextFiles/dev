Description:
------------

 I started this when I had programmed GadTools GUIs a couple
of times and was dissatisfied with it. I went to look for a more
straightforward way of making gadgets and (re)discovered BOOPSI.
 I had skipped past all BOOPSI stuff when I first started programming
in C because I thought Object Oriented programming was way too much
for me to handle. As it turned out I found that BOOPSI was VERY easy
to use. There was only one problem. There was no really usable BOOPSI
gadgetsclasses available. I was certainly not going to spend money on
something I was maybe not going to use very much (ClassAct), so it
became my pet project to start doing BOOPSI gadgetclasses with the
immidiate goal to replace GadTools.


Contents in this release:
-------------------------

 CFbuttonclass - A simple boolean button.

 CFpumbuttonclass - A popup menu button.

 CFsampleclass - StormC sample BOOPSI class project.

 CFscrollerclass - Gadtools SCROLLER_KIND replacement.

 CFtexticlass - A text drawing imageclass.

 CFglyphiclass - Needed by CFpumbuttonclass.

 CFlistclass - The basic list functionality in CFlistviewclass.

 CFlistviewclass - GadTools listview replacement.


Requirements:
-------------

  - AmigaOS 2.04


Installation:
-------------

 Look in the individual directories for instructions on
how to install the BOOPSI classes.


Please Note:
------------

 The classes are currently in alpha state. The general
functioning of the classes is implemented, but some
features are missing. For instance not all classes support
OM_SET on the class specific attributes.
 Also some minor changes to the gadgets may result in the
need to make smaller changes to your source code.
