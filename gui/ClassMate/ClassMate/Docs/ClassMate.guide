@NODE INTRO "Introduction"

ClassMate is an advanced and complex and yet easy to use Graphical User
Interface builder for ClassAct.  ClassMate is an visual interface builder
that supports all ClassAct objects.

Unlike conventional GUI builders, ClassMate constructs your GUI in real
time giving you exactly what the GUI will look like when you produce
the source code.  Source code can be compiled with out and errors and will
run as a stand alone application.

@NODE WINDOWS "Class Mate enviornment"
Class Mate enviornment consists of two main windows.

@{"1. Data Window    " system "multiview datawindow.pic"}
@{"2. Preview Window " system "multiview preview.pic"}
@{"3. GUI Example    " system "multiview gui.pic"}

Data Window
-----------

The Data Window is where you create ClassAct objects such as Buttons,
CheckBoxes etc..

Everything you do in the Data Window will reflect in the Preview Window.
Eg: if you add an new object it will be automatically showing in the Preview
Window, this is true for changing the Object's attributes.

Preview Window
--------------

The Preivew Window shows the current GUI in progress.  All the objects
in the Preview Window is active, meaning you can select them to see
their behaviors.

@ENDNODE

@NODE ADDOBJS "Add Objects to Data Window"
To add a new ClassAct object do the following:

1. Highlight an object in the DataWindow where you want the new object
to be inserted.  The new object will be inserted after the highlighted
object.

User objects can only be inserted after the first Layout Object and can
not inserted in System Objects.

2. Click on the 'Add' command button in the DataWindow.
This will open the @{"Object List Window " system "multiview objectlist.pic"}

3. Select an object you want to add in the Object List window.

4. The Attribute Window will be opened for the object.  Make any changes
to the object's attribute and then select OK.
@ENDNODE

@NODE LISTS "List Manager"

@{"List Manager Window" system "multiview lists.pic"}

When creating a Chooser, ListBrowser, RadioButton or ClickTab object
you will need to attach a list to it.  This is were the List Manager
comes in.

You create lists and then add items to the list.  Objects that uses
lists can be shared.  eg: You can create a listbrowser list that the
chooser object can share.

After you have created your lists you can modify them.  eg: renaming it,
delete it and select if list is to be shared between other objects.

Important Note
--------------

The lists you create is no use unless you create an object and then
assign a list to it.  When you create a listbrowser for example you
need to select the 'Pick a List' button to select a list name.

Lists that are created but not assigned to any objects when not be
generated in the source.

@ENDNODE

@NODE LAYOUTS "ClassAct layouts"
Layouts are the most important aspect of ClassAct.  You create a layout
and then add childrens to the layout.  This is the same method used
in ClassMate.

ClassMate starts with a default Horizontal Layout, you can change this
to Vertical if you like by double clicking the item.

If you add multiple layouts and the GUI doesn't look right its because
the layout is not properly positioned or aligned in the listview.

Here is an example:

Suppose we want to create an GUI that looks something like this:


-------------------------  -------
|                       |  | But |
|    ListView           |  -------
|                       |  -------
|                       |  | But |
-------------------------  -------
-------  -------  ------- --------
| But |  | But |  | But | |  But |
-------  -------  ------- --------

The Data Window should be:

  Objects                        Generation
----------------------------------------------
Application Begin                       1
      Screen                            2
        Window                          3
        Menu                            3
        REXX                            3
        Layout - Vert                   4   <--- User Objects starts here
          Layout - Horiz                5   <--- Note A:
            ListBrowser Object          6
            Layout - Vert               6
              Button Object             7
              Button Object             7
          Layout - Horiz                5   <--- Note B:
            Buton Object                6
            Buton Object                6
            Buton Object                6
            Buton Object                6
Application End                         1

The important point to note is generation 5.  If you shift the Layout one to
left or right the GUI will look totally different.

When you add the first 'Layout - Horiz' object, it is the children of the
first 'Layout - Vert' Look at Note A: above

When you add the second 'Layout - Horiz' object it is the children of the
first 'Layout - Vert' Look at Note B: above.  If you shift it one to the
right then its the children of the first 'Layout - Horiz' because its
the parent.

All you would need to know is who is the parent of the object.

@ENDNODE
