What is DMon
************

   DMon is a multi-purpouse utility written for my personal usage only.
It is a Monitor, Dissassembler, Debuger and development system for my
own programs. You may find similarities to Amiga Monitor by Timo Rossi.
But DMon is different, it can dissassemble and debug 68xxx software in
User and Supervisor Mode. If you do not know what that mean, than do
not use DMon! 68000 users should know that DMon may run on these
machines, but no waranty is made that every function should work as on
other systems.  Kick V1.3 users may find that since version 1.70 DMon
needs Kick V2.0 to work.  There is no need to support Kick V1.3 Amigas
either.

   DMon has a simple arexx port with which one can run arexx scripts
and call direct arexx functions. To launch a Arexx program or statement
simply enter "Say Here am I", "rx script" or simple "script". Both '
