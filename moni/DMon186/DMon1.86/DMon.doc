What is DMon
************

   DMon is a multi-purpouse utility written for my personal usage only.
It is a Monitor, Dissassembler, Debuger and development system for my
own programs. You may find similarities to Amiga Monitor by Timo Rossi.
But DMon is different, it can dissassemble and debug 68xxx software in
User and Supervisor Mode. If you do not know what that mean, than do
not use DMon! 68000 users should know that DMon may run on these
machines, but no waranty is made that every function should work as on
other systems.  Kick V1.3 users may find that since version 1.70 DMon
needs Kick V2.0 to work.  There is no need to support Kick V1.3 Amigas
either.

Commands in DMon
****************

   Everything in [..] is optional.  All memory locations, addresses and
other input should be inputed in HEX if not otherwise stated.

Disassemble Memory
==================

   	COMMAND 	FLAGS

   	D		[MemAddr] [EndAddr]

   Disassemble memory at MemAddr. If no EndAddr is specified 16 lines
will be written to standard output.

Show Memory HEX/ASCII
=====================

   	COMMAND 	FLAGS

   	M		[MemAddr] [EndAddr]

   Display memory as HEX/ASCII at MemAddr. If no EndAddr is specified
16 lines will be written to standard output.

Show Memory Visual
==================

   	COMMAND 	FLAGS

   	SHOW		[MemAddr]

   Display memory as a picture at the memory location specified by
MemAddr.  For memory hunting. MemAddr will be set by other commands.
You can use arrow keys or Mouse to scroll through bitmap Keypad +
advance modulo, Keypad - disadvance modulo Del to reset modulos,
Enter/Return switch between High and Low resolution display, Space to
exit Show Memory.

should apear where the file can be selected.

Partial Loading from Files
==========================

   	COMMAND 	FLAGS

   	[ #		MemLoc Offset Size [File]

requester should apear where the file can be selected.

Writing Memory to Files
=======================

   	COMMAND 	FLAGS

   	]		MemAddr Size File

write to the file. If no filename is specified a file requester should
apear where the file can be selected.

Transfer Memory

   	COMMAND 	FLAGS

   	T		Start End Destination

   Transfer Memory to a memory location specified by Destination.

Read from Device
================

   	COMMAND 	FLAGS

   	<		MemAddr Unit Block Num

   Read a DOS block from disk or other device. Example: < 60000 0 0 2
This will read the Boot Block from disk in drive 0 (DF0:).  The device
can be set with the 'DEV' command.

Write to Device
===============

   	COMMAND 	FLAGS

   	>		MemAddr Unit Block Num

   Write a DOS block to disk or other device. Example: > 60000 0 0 2
This will write the Boot Block to disk in drive 0 (DF0:).  The device
can be set with the 'DEV' command.

Show Registers
==============

   	COMMAND 	FLAGS

   	R

   This will show all CPU, FPU and MMU registers and condition codes,
not only for debuging.

Change Directory
================

   	COMMAND 	FLAGS

   To change to a new directory the 'CD' command must be used.

Jump into Memory
================

   	COMMAND 	FLAGS

be shown with the 'R' command.

Jump into Subroutine
====================

   	COMMAND 	FLAGS

   	Format		[-qv] Device [Unit]

   Like standard DOS format command, but better. Deep format will show
any error occured and tries four times to format a track if format
failed for any reason. Sometimes a dammaged disk can be repaired this
way.  Modes are : -q for Quick format, -v for Deep format. To break
format hit CTRL-C inside Output Window. Example: "Format df0:" This
will format a FFS disk in drive df0:

Menus in DMon
*************

Open
====

   This will open an output channel.

Close
=====

   This will Close an output channel.

Save
====

   This will close an output channel.

Exchange
========

   This will exchange between two output channels.

Help

   This will give quick description on commands available.

About
=====

   This will display author info and online time.

Quit
====

   This will terminate DMon.

Instruction Bytes
=================

   This will turn on or off instrcution bytes for the dissassembler.

DC.W Statements
===============

   This will turn on or off DC.W Statements for the dissassembler.

South of Heaven
===============

   With this the 'install' command can be forced to use standard OS2.0
boot code rather than Sout of Heaven boot code. That is: turn all
caches and burst mode on, switch from PAL to NTCS and vice versa with
left or right mouse button, remove unwanted resident utilities, boot
with a different color on diffrent machines for quick identification
and turn off CLI window for OS2.0.

Arexx support
*************

   DMon has a simple arexx port with which one can run arexx scripts
and call direct arexx functions. To launch a Arexx program or statement
simply enter "Say Here am I", "rx script" or simple "script". Both '
and " should work.  the terminating ' or " is not needed but only
conventional. Arexx scripts are not included for DMon.

Command Line
************

   DMon has a simple Command Line Interface. That is: one can enter any
command and if DMon do not understand this command it will call
dos.library to execute it. Results will be written to default output
channel, normaly console window. Note that DMon will try to execute all
commands in Supervisor Mode if posible.

Other Functions
***************

   DMon will always open its window in the left lower part of the
display.  DMon will report on Guru Meditations if any occured. It will
show full description with code, task address, task name and registers
if available.
