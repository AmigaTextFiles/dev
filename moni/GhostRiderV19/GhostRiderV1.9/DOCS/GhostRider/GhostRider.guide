Welcome to a new introduction! If you have been with me (or rather
GhostRider) from the start, you will know that the introduction has not been
changed for a good while (from V0.22 to this present V1.9). That is not a
mistake! I really don't have much to say about the GhostRider development...
Until now. I feel I should make some things clear. First of all, GhostRider
does _not_ rely on GhostBoard in _any_ way. This is mostly because of the
fact that I have not had a GhostBoard myself for quite some time now, and in
this period I have continued to develop GR so it now is capable of running
without additional hardware of any kind; in the beginning (V0.2) GR could
only run with a GhostBoard (or an equivalent board) simply because it was
run in $F00000 RAM. Later on (pretty soon, actually) I changed it to be a
"normal" Amiga executable so that I could get some ideas/response from my
new roommate. However, GhostRider still needed a NMI button to be invoked
and this turned out to be a problem when I sold my A2000 and bought an A4000
- why in hell did Commodore remove both IPL and LVL7 lines in the ZorroIII
bus standard? Yeah, I know; It is more "system" friendly with only two
interrupt levels but they did themselves advocate the NMI (and the $F00000
RAM area) for debugging purposes in the start. Anyway, bottom line is; no
NMI guarenteed on C= machines. Back to the drawing board! In fact this
problem simply provoked a faster development of the GR system interface
which was planned from the start. The last step in this process will be the
option of running GhostRider _with_ the system (as opposed to "on" the
system). Simply put, it will be possible to run GhostRider as a task, on
it's own screen with full system access to RAM disk and harddrives. This,
however, kind of brings me to the second thing I would like to elaborate on,
namely the reason for changing the release form of GhostRider to shareware:
$ MONEY $

From the first public release (in 1993) to this very date (08.09.94) I have
been paid a grand total of.... $20US - for just about two years worth of
hard (? Who am I kidding ? :) work. Now, I don't want to seem greedy
(anyway, I don't FEEL greedy), and I kind of promissed myself (before
starting this new introduction) that I would not write a "send me some
money" pep talk, but I could truely need some "inspiration". The reason is,
that I feel there is so many things I would like to see in GhostRider, but
on the other hand, I also feel a bit like a fool working on a "dead" project
- I hardly ever get any feedback on my work (sigh! :). So, in a way I am
glad that I had the moral to finish version 1.0 (keywords being full
disksystem and disassemble editor). If I don't get any new moral support I
now want to devote some more time on other projects (for my collection of
unfinished projects - it has been neglected for too long :), but HEY! You
can change this ("I have a dream!" ;^). You can see for yourself how much
work I do for a lousy $20US - even though I have decided to adjust my fee a
bit :) Call it a change in business politics if you want ;)

At last I would like to (properly) thank Peter Folke Pedersen for his great
picture of the GhostRider... For some reason you did not get the appropriate
credits in previous releases - sorry! Also special thanks to John Girvin for
registering GhostRider - at least I now have been paid 0.06 cents per
program line... I would love to see it rise to the rate of the NASA shuttle
programs - ~$1000US/line :) - In my dreams *<:^>

The text below is a bit old (GR V0.22), but hey! So am I :^)

Welcome  to  the GhostRider documentation. Since this is an introduction I'd
like  to  start with a little story about me and my background (feel free to
skip it :)

I  have always wanted to make my own cartridge. It started back in time when
I had  a  C64  and  an Eprom-burner(?). The cartridges, at the time, didn't
please  me,  so  I tried to make one myself - no success! I was too lazy and
didn't  have  enough  knowledge  to  do  it, so I dropped the idea and later
bought  an  Amiga.  After  buying  the  Amiga I spent a year doing NOTHING,
because  the  task  of  learning  M68000 assembler caused me trouble (lousy
books!).  When  I  finally  learned assembler I made some demos, but since I
have  a  problem with demoideas, I started to make some utilities. They have
not  been  very successful,  but I learned about the system, and that is, I
dare  say, hard  earned knowledge! Anyway, programming the system (2.04+ is
GREAT) didn't give the kick I needed, so in the summer 1990 (I think) I dug
the old  ideas  of  a  cartridge  up.  In  that period I coded a ram-tester
(IntelTest)  for a hardwarecompany called 3H Design, and I persuaded them to
develop  a Action Replay-like cartridge, but with RAM like the Expert on the
C64. Unfortunately the company died, and I lost contact. First in the end of
1991  I  found  what  I needed, the BeerMon hardware. I tried talking my kid
brother (hardware freak) into making a card, but he never did. Later in 1992
I got  interested  in  the  design of hardware myself, and developed a card
(inspired  by  the  BeerMon hardware,  but  with custom circuits (PEELs) to
cost-reduce  it)  named GhostBoard.  I  also tried to make an Always-freeze
(well  almost) button  like  the  one  in  Action Replay, but unfortunately
without success.  (Still  got some ideas, though. I think I need to do some
DMA - frightening thought. Maybe I will design GhostBoard MK II WITH freeze,
when  I  am  through  my  education.... Time will tell) Where was I? Ah, the
GhostBoard  worked  fine on the A500, but I wanted it to run in a A2000 too.
No  problem, people think... The A2000 has a 86 pin connector like the A500.
Yeah,  but  that  slot IS already occupied by an '030-card, and I am not the
only  one  in  this situation (hi Jesper, Jes & Anders), so I had to make it
fit  in the Zorro slot. Some problems, but we did it. So now GhostBoard runs
in  A500  (A500+)  and Zorro II slots, and therefore (theoretically anyway)
also in Zorro III slots (A3000/A4000). Well, this leads me to the main point
of this introduction - the monitor. (lotsa introduction to the introduction,
eh?)

Last  year  (December  1992)  I  brought  a  preview of the GhostRider and a
functional  beta-revision  of  the  GhostBoard to The Party II - just to get
some  response  to  what  I had spent my precious time on. Even though it is
difficult  to  draw  attention on such a big party, a few people came by and
gave  me  some  moral  support. One even bought the GhostBoard (Hi Pontus!),
which,  I  dare  say, is support worth a billion dollars (or an arm :-). So,
with  a  strengthen  moral  and fresh energy I went home and programmed some
more...  Well,  a lot. Unfortunally I had some trouble, like the university,
missing documentation  on  the  M68K  processor  family  and  the Amiga DOS
formats.  Also  my  accelerator  blew  skyhigh on the first day of my summer
vacation  (no programming for two months... Blast!) What I am getting at is,
moral  needs  a  push  again. For this reason I have decided that it is time
that the GR meets the public... And here you are :)

If you like what you see here, I ask you to register GhostRider.

You  might  want  to  get  your  hands on a GhostBoard, but the GB is in the
process  of  being  updated to revision 2, which support ghosting of the RAM
where  GhostRider is located. Also, CPU writes to the hardware registers are
grabbed. But, since it is not finished yet (well, the logic is working. Only
have  to  do  the  DRAM-controller.) you will have to be patient (or send me
$1000... then I'll have it finished in a jiffy :)

Well, I guess that this is enough bullshit for the time being. Have a happy
New Year! (Remember: Don't drink and drive! :-)

                            The GhostRider Editor

The editor in GhostRider is very fast because it does not use any bitmap-
scrolling. But speed is not enough to make a good editor, you also need some
keyboard-shortcuts to make life easier. I have tried to include many
different tools in the editor, but I am still looking for new ideas.
Implemented now is:

Point and press left mouse to re-place cursor.

With left Amiga and the mouse you may also snap and paste text. Mark text
with left mousebutton pressed. A double click will mark the word under the
pointer, and a triple click will mark the line. Paste the text with the
right mousebutton or lAmiga+PasteKey. The snapper does not support
multi-line snap, and I have no immediate plans of implementing it.

Plans of future implementation/work are:

    - Delete previous/next word.
    - Configurable size of history buffer. (Now 16 lines)
    - List history.
    - Name-completion when working with symbols/diskfiles.
    - Pointer to exact problem in faulty line (HELP + Shift).
    - Whatever-YOU-might-come-up-with!

History:

 ------ * GhostRider V0.42 changes.
 280194 - Added PasteKey.
 310194 - The keymap was screwed up. Fixed.
        - Now a configurable keymap may be read with the DeckRunner.

 ------ * GhostRider V1.0 changes.
 200794 - You may now use the mouse to re-position the cursor.
        - The tabulater key now inserts four spaces.

@node "Input" "GhostRider/Input"
                              GhostRider Input

The default numeric base used in GhostRider is hexadecimal, with some few
exceptions; the processor registers have a higher parse-priority, so 'A0'
will be parsed as the addressregister A0. There is two ways to circumvent
this problem. 1st) Prefix the value with the hexadecimal identifier $ (i.e.
$A0). 2nd) simply prefix a zero (i.e. 0A0). The table below shows how the
different data types are recognized:

  Name          Identifier    "Legal" characters
 +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Binary      | %xxxx       | 0/1                                    |
 | Octal       | @xxxx       | 0-7                                    | 
 | Decimal     | #xxxx       | 0-9                                    |
 | Hexadecimal | ($)xxxx     | 0-9/a-f/A-F                            |
 | ASCII       | 'xxxx'      | ' '-'z'                                |
 | ASCII       | "xxxx"      | " "-"z"                                |

The entries marked with (*) will be implemented with the dis/assembler
support of the bigger CPUs. Erm.. Yeah, right... not exactly... But they
will surely be supported... some day. Probably when somebody (you?) complain
about them not being there.

The calculator in GhostRider is able to "nest" operators, allowing the
operators to have different priority. Use of parentheses is also supported.
Below is a list of the recognized operators sorted in order of priority:

  Operator      Function
 +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | (), []      | Nest previous operator, and calculate contents       |
 |             | before proceeding.                                   |
 |-------------+------------------------------------------------------|
 | -, ~        | Monadic minus, logical not.                          |
 |-------------+------------------------------------------------------|
 | <<, >>, ^   | Left/right shift, power (power not implemented yet.) |
 |-------------+------------------------------------------------------|
 | &, !, ~     | Logical AND, OR, EOR.                                |
 |-------------+------------------------------------------------------|
 | +, -        | Add, subtract.                                       |
 |-------------+------------------------------------------------------|
 | >, =>/>=, = | Compare.                                             |
 | <=/=<, <,<> |                                                      |
 +--------------------------------------------------------------------+


The use of these operators is not limited to the calculator-function, but
can be used in any input. Some examples below:

        moveq   #10,d0
        moveq   #d0+1,d0                        ;(d0++ :-)
        moveq   #%11101/#2+'0'+('A'!$20),d1
        clr.w   .Lives(pc)

        M.Lives         ;(hex-dump from address in .Lives)
        D.Depacker      ;(disassemble "Depacker")


History:

 ------ * GhostRider V0.22 changes.
 160194 - (x+y) resulted in "unbalanced parantheses"-error.
        - * used in place of a number/symbol will hold the value of the
          current memory position.

 ------ * GhostRider V1.0 changes.
 280794 - Reference to SP (stack pointer) did not give the correct value.
          Fixed.

                which are not graphically represented in the GhostRider
                font. I see three solutions to the problem:
                1) Expand the font.
                2) Print the codes 160-255 with inverted 32-127 chars.
                3) Replace the codes with a predefined char, representing
                   all non-ASCII codes.
                At present is the 3rd solution used. I don't like (1-2)
                because there is no graphic designs for the codes 0-31
(pure
                control codes), but I may include (2) later. Response is
                welcome.
                Use \\ to get infinite dump. Dump area by setting both
start
                and end.

History         261292 - Working fine.

Notes           It may seem that this routine is a bit, er... slow! Yes, it
                is slow due to the fact that GR have very limited
                memory resources to spend on the disk routines. Therefore
                all disk related search in this command is based on
                pointers.

                            need only specify it once if you are doing some
                            heavy formatting :) (remember the '=' char!)
 
                example: format df2:FreeDisk fc=pc+42

                Cryptic, eh? 8-) This will format the disk in drive df2:
                with FFS and dir cache. Empty tracks will be filled with
the
                value of the program counter plus hex 42.

                You may break the formatting with ESC. This will not
prevent
                the writing of BOOT, ROOT etc. though.

                the active copperlists. To speed things up a bit, only the
                first entry does a full search. At following entries, the
                immediate area around the previous copperlist will be
                scanned. If this search fails the full search is made
again.
                This command is used to specify how big the searchoffset
                should be. If the copperlist is not changed during
                programexecution, you may want to reduce this offset to 2

                Monitors which reset the display at exit are marked with
                "R".

                The default chosen screen mode is PAL non-lace.
                In the preference editor you may control _both_ default
                chosen screen mode _and_ the definition of the five modes.
                The default definitions (I believe) would suite most of the
                users. You might want to change the number of
                text lines, though.

@node "CMDCustom" "GhostRider/Display/change exit-CustomRegister-data"
Name            Display/change exit-CustomRegister-program pointer.

Syntax          cus <program ptr>/<0>

Function        Display/change pointer to "copper-list"-like program to be
                executed at exit. Use "0" to disable the program execution.
                The program "language" is defined by elements of an offset
                word and a data word:
                [custom register offset].w, [data].w
                You end the list with a offset value of $ffff (-1).
                At this time also odd offset values will end execution, but
                this may change in later versions (i.e. for loop
                control/blitter wait etc.)
                With this different approach to the CR programming problem
                (previously done with a table) it is now possible to
                program the special double-store registers in the AGA
                chipset. Also it is more convenient this way; you may keep
                a "default" table on disk and load it to a free memory
                location when starting a GR session. This way you don't
                have to re-build the table each time you start a new GR.
                This command gives you the possibility of fixing CRs
                trashed by the GhostRider.

                Because the PP'ed data does not contain length-information
                (and depacks backwards), you will have to know the
                endaddress of the packed data. This is an awkward way of

                vectors. This makes the GR resident.
                The monitor is called with the ColdCapture. At this time
                very few things have happend, which improves your chances
of
                finding the memory untouched. You will find that the system
                is not up'n'running -> don't mess around with the stack.
                The NMI and resident setup are carried out with a call from
                the CoolCapture. At present you can not prevent the NMI
                setup, but this may be a preference setting later on.
                At reset the screen will (should :) flash one of three

@node "ErrorMessages" "GhostRider/Error Messages"
ErrorMessages sorted by age (implementation):

Syntax error!
 The syntax of the input line is wrong. It may also be wrong syntax in a
 math expression.

Undefined symbol!
 Reference to an undefined sybol. ("ls" will list defined symbols)

Illegal addressing mode!
 Assembler: Used addressing mode is not valid for the given mnemonic.

Illegal size!
 Assembler: Specified size is not valid for the given mnemonic/addressing
 mode.

Unknown mnemonic!
 Assembler: Not a M68k family mnemonic.

Unexpected end of line!
 The routine parsing the input expected more data.

Unknown command!
 Not a command. Not one GR knows about anyway...

No disk in selected drive!
 Obvious.

Not all sectors found!
 When reading from disk, the decoding routine keeps track of which sectors
 have been decoded. You will get this error if the loaded track did not
 contain 11/22 sectors.

Invalid Sector ID!
 An Amiga DOS disk is identified with a $FF in the sectorheader. If this is
 not the case, GR can't read the disk.

Track contains illegal sector number!
 You will see this message if the track contain illegal sectornumbers (i.e.
 not 0-10/0-21).

Data CheckSum error!
 The checksum of one of the blocks is wrong. This is an error on DOS level,
 not on trackdisk level.

Illegal block number!
 You have specified an illegal block number. Only use 0-1759/0-3519.

Symboltable is full!
 You ran out of symbol space... Tough luck. If you really need more space,
 let me know.

Illegal symbolname!
 Use only alpha-numeric letters for symbolnames (0-9, a-z, A-Z)

Illegal separator!
 You may separate (most) arguments with space or comma.

Illegal track number!
 Only tracks 0-159 are allowed.

Illegal length!
 Obviously a negative or zero length is no good.

Illegal area!
 If start of area is a higher compared with end of area.

No hunt data!
 If no hunt data is specified.

Not found!
 Hunt data was not found.

Jump table full!
 Editors nest jumps so that you may return to a previous address. Use
 Amiga+z to zap (empty) the jump table.

Jump table empty!
 You tried to get an address from the empty jump table.

No command to resume!
 Either you have not broken a resumable command, or the resume-data have
 been deleted.

Unbalanced parantheses!
 The math expression have unbalanced parantheses.

No value!
 The argument parser expected a value but did not find one.

Unknown datatype!
 GR know quite a few datatypes, but apparently you have not had the chance
 to look at them... Until now : @{"Data Types. c/o Input" link "Input" 0}

Illegal register number!
 Assembler: Say Doc, I thought you knew your M68k registers. I know it
would
 be nice with, say, 32 of each register type, but please stick to D0-7 and
 A0-7 :)

Illegal Index Register!
 Assembler: For all I know you can use D0-A7.

Invalid index scale!
 Assembler: Only use scales 1,2,4,8.

Data too large!
 Assembler: The size of the immidiate data you tried to use exceeds your
 specified operand size.

Only one base displacement allowed!
 Assembler: Obvious.

Only one outer displacement allowed!
 Assembler: Obvious.

Only one index register allowed!
 Assembler: Obvious.

Illegal bitfield!
 Assembler: Consult your Motorola manual on this, somewhat, wild subject. I
 think I got it right ;^)

Illegal condition code!
 Assembler: Yes, I know it would be nice with a BOJITUHRTP branch
 (OnlyJumpIfTheUserHasRegisteredTheProgram), but this here assembler only
 knows what he's been told, ya know!

Address must match that of first half!
 LineAssembler: When assembling long commands the address of both lines
must
 be equal (this _is_ a spooky subject... I'm not even sure this works as
 supposed :)

Could not find other half!
 LineAssembler: Apparently you forgot to enter the first half of whatever
 command you wanted to assemble.

Select area first!
 Editors: Select area _before_ you try to use any of the functions that
 require a marked area (or you'll get this message).

Disk is writeprotected!
 Disk: Obvious.

No fill data!
 Hey! GR may be a very userfriendly program but there is _no_ way it can
 figure out what data-string you want to use! (It may become a feature in
 later versions of GhostRider, though. Depends on my ability to figure out
 how the BLAZEMONGER INC. guyz do it... I've been told they have such a
 routine... I'm just not in the mood for a chat with their "CS" that's
all!)

Areas overlap!
 But they do! Have a look for yourself! :)

Unknown drivetype!
 Disk: The identification-code shows the drive is a unknown type (to me
that
 is. You would probably know what stuff you have hooked up :)

That drive is not in your system!
 Disk: When trying to access a drive GR kinda expects the drive to be
 there... But since I programmed the GR, and I _know_ that types like _you_
 (yes, YOU) might, just might, mess around with GR, I included this
 checker...

ExecBase Corrupt. Command not allowed!
 Trying to do system-stuff on a dead system ain't too bright...
 Unfortunately the only way I could figure out how the system is doing is
by
 checking the exec base..... And that, I might add, isn't too bright (two
 things of a kind :).

Not a valid interrupt vector ($00-$bc)!
 GhostRider only give control of 48 interrupt vectors.

Not a valid address! Must be in chip!
 Work: Apparently some things need to be in Chip, and you just tried to
move
 them to Fast memory.

Location conflicts with VBR!
 Work: Workarea conflicts with VBR memory. Use another area.

Location conflicts with GR!
 Work: Workarea conflicts with GR memory. Use another area.

Missing compression ID!
 Depackers: Depackers need ID-words in the data to run.

All BreakPoints used!
 BP: No more space. Try deleting some of the other breakpoints or send me a
 request for a bigger BP-buffer (make sure to use the magic word... :)

No BreakPoints set!
 BP: No sense in zapping non-existing entries.

Address already have BreakPoint!
 BP: Double breakpoints are not allowed (no sense in having it really).

No BreakPoint at this address!
 BP: Specific BPzapping on a non-existing entry.

Not a valid TRAP number (0-15)!
 BP: BreakPoints are made with the TRAP #n command - n must be 0-15.

Illegal drive. Must be 0-3!
 Disk: The Amiga only support 4 drives.

Illegal Copper. Must be 0/1!
 The Amiga only has two copper registers (0 and 1).

Illegal search-offset (0<x<MaxChip,even)!
 Copper search-offset must be an even number, not bigger than the size of
 MaxChip.

Illegal custom-offset (0<x<$200,even)!
 Do you have an AAA machine? No? Then rest assured. You only need control
of
 $dff000-$dff1fe (Only complaints from Dave Haynie accepted :)

Corrupt DirCache block!
 Disk: Directory routine found a corrupted DirCache block.

You must specify a filename!
 Disk: Filename must be specified in ""/'' markers.

Filename is corrupt!
 Disk: Filename is too long/missing end marker.

File not found, error!
 Disk: Could not find specified file on this disk. You may also see this
 message if a specified directory does not exist.

Width must be $02-$50!
 Peeker: Displaywidth must be $02-$50.

No sector header present!
 Disk: The track does not contain the specified sync-mark.

Could not set breakpoint!
 BP: The breakpoint was not succesfully set (i.e. if set in ROM space).

Not a directory!
 Disk: You tried to access a file like a directory (used in a path/CD
 whatever)

No parent directory!
 Disk: Current directory have no parent.

Not a file!
 Disk: You tried to access a directory like a file.

Not enough disk space!
 Disk: There is not enough free space on the disk to hold the file. Please
 remember that a file also need blocks to keep track of the data blocks.

Track not found!
 Disk: The sector header also contain a tracknumber. If this tracknumber
 does not match the position of the head, you will see this error (a
 possible seek error).

Not a DOS disk!
 Disk: The boot block does not hold a correct DOS identifier.

Incorrect header checksum!
 Disk: The header checksum of a sector was wrong.

Incorrect sector checksum!
 Disk: The data checksum of a sector was wrong.

Still many things to be done! See the command-documents for expansion ideas
for the individual command.

Here are my current plans: 
 - Entry with hot-keys from WB/CLI. Allowed harddisk access in this entry
   mode.
 - Place cursor at problematic argument at SYNTAX ERROR.
 - Proper control of the backup-memory. Access to workmemory should be
   redirected to the buffer.
 - MMU programming. Setup memory protection, relocate memory etc.
 - Screen dump to printer.
 - Only NMI-entry if in pre-specified area, user/super-mode etc.

GhostRider is as of the release of version 1.0 placed in the Public Domain.
There is no missing commands or crippled operation. However, if you use it I
would appreciate it if you would register and pay for some of the many hours
I have been working on GhostRider. Of course you will also support further
development by doing so. I guess this is generally known as the Shareware
concept - but don't let that frighten you ;)


The GhostRider registration fee is:

 Danish currency   :       100Dkr
 German currency   :        30DM

                             Oo. GhostBoard .oO

Not available. Still have to do the DRAM-interface and print layout. Logic
is working, though.

Yeah, right.... I never seem to get around to this... I have found a new
problem: No A1200 market :( - most (serious) users have used the trap-slot
for some expansion device, so I won't spend money on developing an A1200
version.

Also, the ZorroIII does not support NMI - Damn! I could start supporting
BERR, but this baby makes a terrible stack mess on the 'o2o+, and it is not
always possible to continue program flow...

Well, since I have not spend too much (active) time on these two problems,
GhostRider have grown and now pretty much circumvent the problems in
different ways: Resident entry and use of the ghostrider.library - you still
get more control if you have a NMI button, though.

                        Features of GhostRider V1.9:
                        ----------------------------

 290894 - Added a generic entry type. You may now activate GR with a
          exception call to GR-offset 2 (GR load address +2). Example: In
          your program change e.g. a-trap handler to GR-offset 2. You can
          now start GhostRider anywhere in your program with a Line-A
          exception (dc.w $Axxx). Below is a table of GR entry points:

          GR-offset 0 - CLI entry - do not use.
          GR-offset 2 - Generic entry (exceptions only).
          GR-offset 4 - System entry (jsr/bsr from user-mode is OK).
          ("NMI!")    - NMI entry - much like generic, but checks multiple
                        entry attempts (i.e. faulty signals from a NMI
                        button).
          ("RST!")    - Reset entry - do not use.

          Find offset of the ("?") marked entries by searching for the "?"
          longword. Call the address following the ID longword.

 310894 - Fixed bug that caused ECS machines to freeze if the multisync
          screen mode was activated. GR would also freeze if called from a
          multisync screen mode (from the system).

 060994 - Added disk verify. Consult the @{"verify" link "ToggleVerify" 0} command for further
          information.


                        Features of GhostRider V1.0:
                        ----------------------------

* GhostRider is now shareware. See the ordering section for instructions on
  how to register.

 290494 - Did you ever try starting a "system-hostile" program with a
          hot-key? The anoying result is often that the system don't see
          the release of the hot-key(s). Since GR now can be started by
          hot-key and by nature is a SOB when it comes to being friendly
          with the system, I have added a (highly illegal ;-) hack which
          will clear the matrix of the keyboard.device. From what I can
          see, this works with Kickstarts 37.xx-40.xx. Nevertheless you may
          disable this function from the preference editor.
          Oops. 290794; I just found a puzzle. This fix does not work 100%.
          If any diskroutines have been used _and_ the disk have not been
          removed prior to leaving GhostRider this fix fails... You go
          figure... And so will I. Hope to solve it soon. Until then, just
          make sure to pop the disk if you have used it.
 010494 - Finished ghostrider.library version 37.1. This library will do
          the interfacing between GR and the system/you. Please consult the
          autodocs for documentation.
 030794 - If GR is entered by the system the graphics function LoadView
          will be used to restore display at exit.
        - GR's memory usage have been reduced by placing the (lovely :)
          picture in the screen buffer (it used to have separate mem).
        - The 'o4o was reported to be a 'o7o in the info text. - Not that I
          think anybody have ever noticed, coz' GR crash on the 'o4o. Why?
          Your guess is as good as mine (no selfmodifying code). I did find
          that the CPU identification routine I use crash if the data cache
          on the 'o4o is enabled. Figure I have some coding to do - except
          it's damn hard to do without an 'o4o based machine. Most likely
          it will work when you read this, coz' GR V1.0 will not be
          released until the bug is fixed.
        - You may now control if the screen should be cleared at entry or
          not by preferences.
 190794 - The CACR register was not restored at exit. Fixed.
 200794 - Removed the Nice Scroll preference flag. Now all copper updates
          are made in the VBlank area.
        - Bus Error now have a separate handler. At this time functions
          which generate a bus error is simply aborted. I will implement
          some Gary control later on (inspired by BeerMon).
 210794 - Added very strict (and correct :) disk timings (like side select
          delay.)
 230794 - The keyboard handshake and delay/repeat timing is now done with
          the CIA timer. The "resolution" of the delay/repeat timing is
          doubled so you may want to adjust the settings.
 240794 - Disk related errors now include the trackdisk error number
          (TDERR) so you may find a description of the problem in whatever
          litterature you own.
        - Added control of sector header checksum in the disk decoder.
        - The native disk routines have been improved a bit to give better
          operation.
 260794 - Added track display in header when disk is accessed. The display
          needs a little explanation; First you will se a single letter
          which identify the current operation R(ead)/W(rite)/S(eek). Then
          follow cylinder and side information. Also when a track is read,
          you will see a line of '-' chars being replaced with '+' chars in
          the order the sectors are found on the disk. This last display is
          only some "eye cream" I added for... er, well, it looks nice :)
          But because the sectors are loaded faster than the sector display
          can be updated, it will be "old" information and may appear while
          the drive is seeking or writing... As I said - pure eye cream :)
        - GhostRider now have all planed disk commands and support DOS0-5.
 280794 - If the cop0 list was not found at entry, it will not be set at
          exit.
        - The hunt/hunt_not/fill now accept a single data nibble, which is
          made into a byte (high nibble always NULL).
        - ExecBase now need to be on an even address to be valid.
        - When the reset entry of GR is available ($f00000/cold), GR will
          always be invoked if the system had a GURU. I'd like to add text
          explanations to the horrible numbers, but not until someone
          (registered :) ask me to - there is so many error IDs!
 290794 - The DTACK time out mechanism of the A3000/A4000 Gary chip is now
          changed at entry, so that access to non mapped memory will merely
          result in garbage data (that is, no Bus Error). This is the
          normal behavior of the other Amiga machines.  Code for this hack
          found in Carnivore's BeerMon (it's not more than a move command,
          but I would not have thought it to be possible if I had not seen
          it in the BeerMon docs.)
 040894 - When the copper waits for a line >256 it now use one of two
          horizontal beam positions, at line 255. The HiRes bit of bplcon0
          is used to determine which of the two values ($71 and $E1) should
          be used. If you use a screen mode which does not have a standard
          horizontal position you may get in trouble here. Let me know, and
          I will include a ">256 lines Horizontal waiting position" in the
          screen mode definitions.
 100894 - The colors of multisync ("super H-Res") resolutions on ECS
          machines are now encoded correct. The header colors will be the
          same as the screen colors, though.
 140894 - GhostRider is now split into two hunks - CODE and CHIP. This
          makes it possible to get better control of the workspace and
          backup area.  Later on (when I get around to do it that is) the
          bit of non-zero data in the CHIP hunk will be compressed and the
          hunk type will be changed to BSS - this will cut ~60KB of the
          executable.


                       Features of GhostRider V0.42:
                       -----------------------------
 060294 - Trackloader would hang if the track did not contain the specified
          syncmark. Now it will timeout after 400 ms and flash the screen
          (red).
        - Sync and tracklength was reset at each entry. Now it is only
          set at startup.
 050394 - The CPU cache settings was trashed at exit. Fixed.
 230394 - Fixed bug in internal exception handling.
          Added GRBase and PC offset from GRB in the exception-text.
 240394 - Added some extra internal debugging facilities.
 030494 - Internal BusError handling improved. Because the AGA-generation
          Amigas have (better) BusError checking logic, access to
          non-mapped memory cause a BusError. This problem can only be
          solved in one way; by letting the CPU continue without the
          requested data.  Therefore 'o1o+ CPUs will call a BE handler that
          will ask the CPU to continue (I have only tested it on the 'o3o)
          after flashing the screen (green). Still, this takes some (quite
          a lot, actually) time so don't do too much ASCII dumping from
          unmapped memory (this will not trash the machine, but it will
          probably hang long enough for you to learn Danish from scratch
          (hint: that's a lot more than 42 seconds :))
 050494 - The command history is no longer cleared at entry.
        - The BreakPoint handling was cleaned up a bit and prepared for
          system usage (ghostrider.library).


                       Features of GhostRider V0.32:
                       -----------------------------
 210194 - Reset-entry would crash stack at exit. Fixed.
 240194 - Only the area 0-$40000 was scanned for copperlists. Fixed.
 270194 - The fill-function in the editors now do .w/.l fill operations.
        - Editors HELP text now shared -> saved 1.5k.
 280194 - Added register dump on CTRL+HELP. This will show register
          contents on the two first lines of the screen. When releasing the
          keys, the original text will be reprinted.
 310194 - Reset-entry stackpointer wrong on 'o1o+ machines. Fixed.
 010294 - GR now runs on AGA machines (using 15kHz screens anyway). NTSC is
          also supported better now. You will have to be carefull when
          using NTSC though; if the screen is higher than the display you
          may very well crash GR. See the PAL/NTSC commands for further
          information on this subject.


                       Features of GhostRider V0.22:
                       -----------------------------
 040194 - Header-update flag was never cleared. Fixed. Now flags are only
          updated if needed.
 160194 - Editors would not accept space before address. Fixed.
 170194 - Cleaned help-screens up a bit.
 180194 - GhostRider V0.2 did not run on 'ooo/'o1o machines due to a
          word-write to an odd address... Bummer, sorry about that.

See
                the Fill-command for parsing examples.

                You can use this as a simple mungwall/enforcer system if
you
                have trouble with "random" access to memoryareas not
                allocated: Fill the memoryarea with a specific value, run
                the program (until it crashes), then HuntNOT the area for
                "illegal" values. Now you have a specific address which
                should make it easier to pinpoint the bugged routine. Later
                versions of GR will be able to monitor such addresses while
                stepping the program -> Lean back and enjoy the show :)

                area.  The address, chip, must be located in chip memory,
                giving enough space above for the workspace. The address,
                backup, may be located in any memory type or even be set to
                NULL.  In the latter case there will not be made backup of
                the workspace. If you wish to use the debugger you will
                have to disable the backup.  The command checks for
                overlapping areas (not allowed), VBR and GR conflict.  Some
                day this function may become obsolete, given that I get
                around to do the WorkSpace-controller; access to the
                chipmem where the workspace is located will be redirected
                to the bufferarea.

History         181093 - Added to monitor.

                ------ * GhostRider V1.0 changes.
                180494 - It is now possible to control both workspace and
                         backup location.

Preferences     The default workspace location may be set in the
                preferences.

Ideas           WorkSpace-controller, see function description.

@node "XconValue" "Exit Beamcon0 value"
Name            Exit beamcon0 value

Syntax          xcon <p>/<n>/<0>

Function        With this function it is possible to specify a beamcon0
                exit value which is not a part of the custom register exit
                program. This value is poked to the beamcon0 register
                before the CR "program" is "executed" (see the @{"cus" link "CMDCustom" 0} 
                command).  The options "p" and "n" will set the value to
                either $0020 or $0000. If you specify "0" nothing will be
                poked.

History         ------ * GhostRider V1.9 changes.
                070994 - The commands pal and ntsc is "merged" to this
                         command.

Preferences     None.

Ideas/Bugs      None.
