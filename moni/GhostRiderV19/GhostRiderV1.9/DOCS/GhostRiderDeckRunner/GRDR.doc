A short instruction in using the GhostRider DeckRunner:

Usage: GRDR FILENAME <CODE HEXADDRESS> <CHIP HEXADDRESS> 
                     <STATIC> <COLD> <FORCE> <SETNMI> <QUIET>

FILENAME:       Path and name of GR file to be loaded.
CODE Addr:      Load GR code to address.
CHIP Addr:      Address of work area in CHIP memory.
STATIC:         Don't backup area used in CHIP memory.
COLD:           Should GR patch the coldcapture.
FORCE:          Ignore AllocMem-fail.
SETNMI:         Set the NMI vector to GR-entry.
QUIET:          Don't start GR (use with SETNMI/COLD).

Use this loader to start GR if you plan on re-entering GR after the first
exit. If using direct DOS-load, memory may have been trashed when trying to
re-enter.

The keyboard and preference files will be loaded from S:

Use the STATIC option if you plan to use GR's debugger. With this specifier
the work area in CHIP memory will be allocated with a AllocMem call. Use the
CHIP option to specify an address for a AllocAbs call.

If the load address is set to $F00000, the needed reset handling code will
automatically be added. The FORCE option will be used.

This command uses the ReadArgs of DOS 2.04+. Maybe I should do a 1.3
version? Let me know... Too lazy to do it if nobody wants it anyway.

Examples:

grdr c:gr code 7f00000 chip 1f0000 static cold quiet

grdr c:gr code f00000 setnmi

grdr c:gr code f00000 setnmi chip 4 force

(The last one needs the "FORCE" option since the system will not be too
happy about giving up the area specified for work - the ExecBase and the
MC68k default vector base... Erm, I just tried it out - surprisingly it
works ;) - but make sure to have a VBR equipped CPU and do not (I tell you!)
set the STATIC option :)

History:

...
210194      - Added $f00000 handling.
310194      - Now GR checks for correct revision number of settings.
              Loading is aborted if revision numbers differ.
            - Added KeyMap loading.
            - Config and keymap are read from
              "ENVARC:GhostRider.Prefs/KeyMap". The Config-option has been
              removed - only the specified filenames are accepted.
010294.6    - Added COLD-argument.
            - Modified output at wrong syntax (now usage is printed).
060294.7    - Fixed a cache problem in the reloc routine.
170494.8    - Above removed. There was not a problem.
            - When GhostRider has been loaded, there will be added a MsgPort
              to the system which will identify the location of GR. This
              makes it possible to use the ghostrider.library available with
              the GhostRider V1.0 release.
140894.9    - Added support for loading two hunks (GR is now split in CODE
              and CHIP hunk).
            - Added CHIP and STATIC options. (CHIP is needed since the work
              address you put in the pref file is not known at MemAlloc
              time :)
290894.10   - The last 6 bytes of the preference file was not loaded.
              Fixed.
080994.11   - Preference files now read from S:
