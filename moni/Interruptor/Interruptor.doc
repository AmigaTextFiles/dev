INTERRUPTOR V2.0  HELP-FILE.
****************************

Let's start with the command overview:

              D[address] -> Disassembler {With build in text searcher!}
              C          -> Change disassembler mode [DATA/TEXT/MNEM]
              M[address] -> Memory dump
              A[address] -> ASCII memory dump
              I[address] [text] -> Insert text in memory.
              E[address] [data] -> Edit memory.
              J[address]        -> Jump to address.
              F                 -> Activate disk-speeder.
              R                 -> Read bootblock in memory.
              T                 -> Show bootblock in memory.
              W                 -> Write STANDARD bootblock (install).

              L                 -> Turn led/filter on/of.
              S                 -> Show some addresses.
              X                 -> Show contact-addresses etc.
              Q                 -> Kill Interruptor.


Extended command overview.
--------------------------

> The Disassembler <

You can change the text in the top-right corner of Interruptor's
screen (Disassember mode:). In the mode: "MNEM" it's a 'normal'
disassembler, it gives a very extended 'source'. BUT! in the mode "TEXT"
it searches for text IN a source.. so when it finds a text string with
more than 3 characters, is doesn't show the disassembly, but it shows
you the text in the form of: DC.B  "Text String". 
Then the final mode: "DATA", this mode works exactly the same as the
"TEXT" mode, but instead of text, it shows you the hex.data in the form:
DC.W   $xxxx.


> The Disk-Speeder <

After a RESET, you can activate the disk-speeder of Interruptor, this
will speed up your drive in saving and loading (and booting)  (!!).

> Virus Protector <

After a RESET interruptor always checks if there's a disk in drive DF0:
if there's a disk in DF0: Interruptor will check the bootblock.. and
check it: when it's a normal bootblock it'll give the message: STANDARD
When the bootblock IS NOT standard (this CAN be a VIRUS!). Interruptor
gives you a warning. Now you can look at the bootblock with the option 'T'
(this gives the ASCII AND the disassembly of the bootblock!). If you
see a text like "BYTE WARRIOR" or "NUMBER OF COPYS" you've got a VIRUS
on your disk.. now you can (MUST!) use the option 'W' (first get the 
write-protect tab off your disk).. after this operation the virus is gone.
** PS: Interruptor DOES NOT use the DOIO offset -456(A6) , some virusses
change this offset so you can't get rid of the virus.. so I use the ROM 
'direct' (sorry).. this will kill ALL bootblock-virusses!!

> Error handler <

When you're amiga get's a software failure (for example: zero divide,
privilege violation or illegal instruction) it'll jump into Interruptor.
Now Interruptor gives you the correct error (in words), and you can use
Interruptor normal. When you exit interruptor over now, the 'normal' GURU
is displayd on you screen.

> The Interruptor <

This probably is the first program which has this function;
when you've loaded a PUBLIC DOMAIN utility/game etc. and you press the
'zerro' key on your KeyPad OR: both mouse buttons, while the DRIVE IS
ACTIVE, you'll jump into Interruptor.. (!!) now you can look at the program
stucture (with 'D'), or edit text/data, switch your LED (and filter)..
and so on....  PS: When text IS PRINTING ON YOUR SCREEN you also can 
jump into interruptor.

End of help file.


BUGS INFO:
----------
As fare as I know, there isn't any bug in Interruptor V2.0.
I've tested it with many PD-software titles, with Kickstart V1.2.
(and that's the kickstart, most amiga-users have). But Interruptor can't
handle (most) bootloading programs.
