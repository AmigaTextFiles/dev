instruction card for AMON version 1.00
(c) by I.N.C. 2nd november 2005

1. invoke AMON

this requires one, two or three paramters

obligatory: paramter 1: filename

2nd paramter: A (single char) do not create a copy fo the file.
display the file immediately. use only for aligned files.

2nd parameter: path in this form DIRECTORY\ or FULL PATH\.
this creates an aligned copy of the file into the specified
directory, and displays this file.

3rd parameter: A (single char) access this file, do not create it.
this does not display the source file, but the file in the buffer directory.

no 2nd paramter: create the buffer file into the same directory.
change the extension to .AMN

2. operate the controls

AMON is operated by ESC, cursor UP/DOWN, page UP/DOWN.

it displays the current address (start of display window)
in this format: "high 16bit:low 16 bit"

3. limitations

AMON was tested with a 2.6 megabyte hudge file. it scrolls through
into 23 (hex) 64kbyte pages. each page scroll increases by 4kbyte.

this gets: 28(hex) 40(dec) * 10(hex) 16(dec) = 280(hex)= 640 scrolls.
640*4k(4096 bytes)=2.6 megabyte. required time = 23 seconds.

as stated in the readme file, it is thought, edit functions are
not required. a data file can be generated from its source, or by
writing a dedicated program to do so.

4. future plans

a similiar sprite monitor. a file can have a set of images.
however, this time a c&p function makes sense.
however, this can be realized by placing the source data into directories.

5. distribution form of AMON

a single archive file, which contains these subdirectories:
AMON and LIBRARY. the root contains this file and the amon.readme
