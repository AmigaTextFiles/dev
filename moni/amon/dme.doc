AMON 1.00 - HEXADECIMAL FILE MONITOR
OPEN SOURCE WARE

preface 1: 
the TOS/TOC of aminet have more priority than the TOS/TOC of
I.N.C., which are listed up below. however, similiar to software tasks,
this does not inhibit their existence. some terms of I.N.C. have general
nature,like a supervisor interrupt.

preface 2:
the program is tested for compilation with pascal55 (borland) under msdos.
however, it should be possible to compile it within the various amiga
implementations, i.e. modula2. it does not contain hardware specific code.
its original purpose is to support the creation of sega mega drive software.
this is a 68000 machine. AMON is part of a developement package, which
represents a compact, open source assembler for the 68000 processor.
the yet existing files (opcode table generator) are included into the package.

description:
monitor program to perform control read tasks. the software does not contain any edit functions.
 it is thought, this is not necessary. instead, the following steps can be taken:
1. write a data table
2. read the source file into buffer slices, replace sections by applying the data table.
3. write the buffer slices to a secondary file.

distribution:
unless you created derived work (i.e. port to amiga os), please only pass
the complete archive in unmodified form. because of its tiny size, this
is possible easily.
-source code, pascal55 (borland)
-limited public domain. this means the following:

if you understand GPL, you do not compulsory have to read this.
 however, I.N.C. is not strictly a recursive acronym.
 there is no claim that I.N.C. would be a recursive acronoym.

-terms and conditions of the hardware/software manufacturers apply.
 this affects the hardware/software environment the program is stored, displayed and executed on.
 in addition, the terms and conditions of the hardware/software manufacturers,
 for whose products the program was designed for, do apply automatically.
-the purpose of action is prescribed as  supportive towards society/internet community, and to
generate/increase wealth within a social and money based economy. if these ideas are not understood,
it is doubtful if it is possible to understand programming/the purpose of programming as such.

-continiuated commercial distribution, corporate/company usage requires a licence agreement.
-there is no compulsory right, that the  program can permanently perform industrial/supportive tasks.
-the programmer/programmers do not take  responsibility for action performed at will, utilizing this software.
-in addition, following rights are declared: the right to download this program. the right to read this program.
the right to store this program on various media. the right to execute this program. 
the right to distribute and communicate this program at appreciate places 
(i.e. similar to the one where it was published by the author).

-as long as this not affects derived work, which represents at least a physical volume
 which is increased by three times (3x), extension/modification does not change authorship/ownership.
 the author has unlimited rights to the program. the user/distributor has limited rights to the program,
 including the obligation to agree to common T.O.S./T.A.C. (terms of service/terms and conditions), 
i.e. yahoo! inc. usage of this program requires understanding netiquette (internet etiquette), 
because it is distributed in that way. if this does not apply to you, than this program was not written for you.
 notice most materials nowadays contain the following: "who should read this book".

words not understood can be found in a dictionary.

bugs and program features:
-the monitor operates buffer slices. thee default is 2048 word (4kbyte). file must be aligned to this size.
 by modifying the source code, this can be changed, i.e. to 512 bytes.
-the monitor offers options: to extend tthe file. to operate a secondary, extended file.
 to go a way with the file. if not aligned, this generates run time error on file<buffer size.
-the flicker at the bottom of the statuss line is random "static noise".

planned extensions:
 none. however the datatype allows a similiar sprite monitor. there are options:
-to allow edit/modify of single sprites  within a chunk, which contains multiple sprites.
-to apply the same strategy: source spriites are edited as single files.
 they are stored into a directory structure (offered by the operating system). 
this is the purpose of an operating system. a compilation tool combines multiple sprites into one file
 (to save disk space, due to sector size of i.e. 4kbyte/16kbyte). 
otherwise, this would not be necessary, because the operating system offers exactly this by directory trees.
