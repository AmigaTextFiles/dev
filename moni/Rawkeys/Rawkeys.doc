			     RAWKEYS V2.0

			       FREEWARE

    RAWKEYS is a small tool for programmers who want to interpret
    IntuiMessages of the types RAWKEY and MOUSEBUTTONS in their programs.
    RAWKEYS shows code and qualifier values in the IntuiMessage structure
    after a key or a mouse button has been pressed.
    Further on the results of conversion by RawkeyConvert() are presented.
    RAWKEYS needs OS 2.0 (V36) or higher.

    START

    From Workbench or Shell, no options.


    QUIT

    By closegadget or RAmiga-Q.


    DISPLAY

    Following information is displayed from left to right in a line:

    (1) the char returned by RawkeyConvert() if printable
    (2) the hexadecimal value of the char or string
    (3) the decimal value of the sign
    (4) the value of the code field within IntuiMessage (hex)
    (5) the value of the qualifier within IntuiMessage (hex)

    If a key has been pressed which doesn't produce a printable char (Tab,
    Return, Esc etc.) or which are string keys, dead keys or qualifiers
    the display mode is modified appropriately. In case of qualifiers and
    mouse buttons their names will be presented, non printable chars are
    indicated by '›32m*›0m'. In case of dead keys or unknown key types a
    simple line will appear.


    MODES OF DISPLAY

    Each keypress produces 2 IntuiMessages: The first one comes when pushing
    a key down, the second one when releasing the key. Exception: CapsLock

    By default RAWKEYS shows the result of both events. By pushing the
    button in the window bottom border you may switch the display of release
    events off or on.


    SOME EXAMPLES

       ›33mLAmiga›0m	CODE $0066 QUAL $8040  ;left Amiga key pressed
       ›33mrelease›0m	CODE $00E6 QUAL $8000  ;released (bit 7 of CODE set)

       ›33mRShift›0m	CODE $0061 QUAL $8002  ;right Shift key
     A ›33m$41›0m 065	CODE $0020 QUAL $8002  ;+ key "A"
       ›33mrelease›0m	CODE $00A0 QUAL $8002  ;"A" released
       ›33mrelease›0m	CODE $00E1 QUAL $8000  ;RShift released

     ›32m*›0m ›33m$0D›0m 013  CODE $0044 QUAL $8000  ;return (nonprintable)
       ›33mrelease›0m	CODE $00C4 QUAL $8000  ;released

     ›32m*›0m ›33m$9B307E›0m  CODE $0044 QUAL $8000  ;string key F1
       ›33mrelease›0m	CODE $00C4 QUAL $8000  ;released

       ›33mLButton›0m	CODE $0068 QUAL $C000  ;left mouse button

       ›33mWheelFor›0m	CODE $007A QUAL $8000  ;mouse wheel forth
       ›33mWheelBac›0m	CODE $007B QUAL $8000  ;mouse wheel back


    Interesting results are obtained e.g. with Alt- and Ctrl-combinations
    and with keys which are "repeatable" and pushed for some time.
