ROMCrack V1.1 (17-Sep-96)
-------------------------

The  program  is  fairly  self-explaining (press the HELP key for a command
overview).   It's  started  via  Debug()  or  a Reset/Guru.  By entering an
address without command, you set the start address for the following M or N
operations.  The disassembler does only recognize MC68000 commands.

That's it, I couldn't find an original documentation, so find out yourself!
