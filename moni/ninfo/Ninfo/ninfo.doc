  General:

  This utility grew out of an attempt to understand the format of an
  executable.  It is loosely based on the example given by the Lattice
  compiler utility OMD.  Since OMD will only do object files, I create
  this utility.

  NINFO should do objects, executables, and library files.  The library
  index hunks are treated as raw data hunks.  The disassemble for the
  code has a few small problems(see the known bugs section) but is mostly
  complete for all 680x0 processors.  It will also do memory and virus
  files(described later).

  Invoke NINFO as follows:

  NINFO [options]  file1 file2....filen

 Options:
   -m<address> : Decode a block of memory aprox. 40 bytes in size.
   -v          : Decode boot block dump (check virus code)
   -s          : symbols supressed
   -d          : data words supressed
   -c          : code words supressed

 Default is to not suppress anything and the "-v" and "-m" are off(a regular
 executable or object file not a bootblock).

 Realize that most files have alot of executable code.  A file that
 is 4K in size might output over 1000 lines of code alone!  I usually
 run a program thru NINFO with "-s -d -c" just to see the basic size
 and structure of a program.

 The boot block code dump was written to decode virus code captured
 using a utility such as DiskX.  It knows the structure of a system
 boot block and will expect a 1024 word block of raw boot block to
 work with.

 The Memory dump was written to allow you to examine code already loaded
 into memory(like the trackdisk.device, or the graphics library).  The
 option includes an address.  Note: the option "-m" must be followed by
 an address without intervening spaces.  The default address is zero.

 Comercial time:
 I only ask for a small registration fee if you would like updates
 to this program.  I plan on fixing all reported bugs.  If you would
 like an update send a Self-Addressed, Stamped mailer($0.65 postage)
 and a disk(with your registration fee of $5.00 the first time) to:

     Custom Services
     P. O. Box 254
     Moorestown, NJ 08057

 If you include some of your PD/Shareware I will return the disk with
 several programs I have done.


 Revision History:

  Version 0.6  - Initial build, never released Lattice Compiler 3.02
  Version 0.7  -                  "      "       "        "     3.10
  Version 0.8  -                  "      "       "        "     4.00
  Version 0.9  - First Shareware Release: Lattice Compiler  5.02
                 added the MULU/MULS/DIVU/DIVS instructions.
  Version 1.0  - Updated to fix several small bugs in instruction decoding
                 Lattice 5.05.  Fixed the Hunks that have special loading
                 flags in the high order bytes.
  Version 2.0  - Updated to fix any instructions not decoding properly.
                 Added the -v and -m options for bootblock and memory
                 examine.  Recompiled with SAS/C 5.10a.
                 removed the highlighting and italics in the banner.
 Known Bugs:


   Certain 68030/040 opcodes do not decode properly.

   If you find a problem with this program, please drop me a note
   (a disk with the file having the problem would be nice!).
