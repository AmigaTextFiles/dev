Only  a  few  lines  this  time,  'HunkFunk"  is  the  default  public
domain/free  ware  thingy.  This program was written as an exercise to
learn a few things about AmigaDOS hunk structures.  So far, this cutie
comes  with  its source code and will 'disassemble' any given AmigaDOS
hunk  file (this includes executables, linker libraries, linker object
files, overlayed files).
   The  information  contained  in  debug  and  symbol hunks is dumped
(great  for spying in stone-age programs which still have a debug hunk
attached).

   Hope you like it!
