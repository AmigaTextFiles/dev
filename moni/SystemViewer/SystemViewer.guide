@{FG SHINE}Introduction@{FG TEXT}

   @{B}SystemViewer@{UB} was written to replace the ARTM V2.04 program 

   by Franz-Josef Mertens, due to those annoying requesters for shareware

   fees.  ARTM (Amiga Real-Time Monitor) is a great program & I recommend 
   
   that you obtain a copy for your system (until I finish SystemViewer).

   There are still a lot of buttons that aren't completely functional

   in this version of SystemViewer (mostly the Priority-changing buttons).

   I mostly use SystemViewer to close windows & screens that a crashed
   
   program has left open.  It can also be used to examine & change logical
   
   Assignments.  @{FG SHINE All other usage is dangerous, so use caution!

   @{B}SystemViewer@{UB} is freeware & includes the source-code in the hopes that

   someone can tell me of better methods of accessing the operating system

   components.  If you make any changes/improvements to the source code,

   please let @{" me " LINK "Author"} know what they are in order to improve & finish this 

   program!  I retain the copyright for the program as-is.

   for any damage done to your data or software.

  @{B}SystemViewer@{UB} was written using @{B}SAS-C V6.58@{UB}.

  The GUI was put together with GadToolsBox V37.300 (14.3.93) (C)

  1991-1993 by Jaba Development.  I wish that there was an easy way to pay

  for this godsend of a program (Thanx guys!).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "use" "How to use SystemViewer:"

   Double-Click on the icon or type @{B}SystemViewer@{UB} into a CLI/Shell.  The
   
   first window that opens has buttons that examine various parts of the
   
   Amiga operating system, when they are clicked (& released) on.
   
   Most windows that open only allow you to view information on the portion
   
   of the current environment, some allow you to change things.
   
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ToolTypes" "SystemViewer ToolTypes:"

   @{B}SystemViewer@{UB} knows which buttons to activate because the ToolTypes in
   the program's icon inform it which modules are present.  These modules
   (separate programs actually) should be placed in the same directory as
   SystemViewer (although you can locate them anywhere as long as the 
   ToolTypes tell @{B}SystemViewer@{UB} where they are).  The ToolTypes are:
   
   AssignCmd    = SysAssigns
   LockCmd      = NOT_DONE            Future: SysLocks
   MountCmd     = NOT_DONE            Future: SysMounts
   MemoryCmd    = SysMemory
   ScreenCmd    = SysScreens
   TaskCmd      = SysTasks
   VectorCmd    = SysVectors
   DeviceCmd    = SysDevices
   FontCmd      = NOT_DONE            Future: SysFonts
   HardwareCmd  = SysHardware
   InterruptCmd = SysInterrupts
   PortCmd      = SysPorts
   ResidentCmd  = SysResidents
   SemaphoreCmd = SysSemaphores

   If a module doesn't work on your system (See @{" bugs " LINK "bugs"}), then change its
   ToolType to @{B}NOT_DONE@{UB} & the module button will be ghosted (so you can't
   accidentally use it again!).

@NODE "Require" "Requirements"

   @{FG SHINE}Minimal Requirements: @{FG TEXT}
    
   Amiga computer with 68020+ and AmigaDos 3.0+

@ENDNODE

@NODE "bugs" "Known Bugs:"

   * The usage of the Resident button will freeze your system after the 

     list of residents is examined (at least, it does that to mine).
   

   * The cache information in the Hardware window is not completely 
   
     correct (I need help with this).
      

   * Closing a window that's still operating correctly will freeze the

     system (what did you expect if you just start performing brain surgery
  
     without any anesthesia?).


   * The Fonts, Mounts & Locks buttons are ghosted because the programs to

     examine them have not been written yet.

  
   * More documentation needs to be written in this guide file.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Compilation" "Compilation of SystemViewer"
    
   @{B}SystemViewer@{UB} was compiled with the SAS-C Compiler V6.58

   Either move the GlobalObjects stuff to CPGM:GlobalObjects/ or

   change the source files to include CommonFuncs.h to the place where

   you've moved it to.

   (Just change #include "CPGM:GlobalObjects/CommonFuncs.h" in each .c 

   file & edit the makefile to reflect the location of CommonFuncs.o).
