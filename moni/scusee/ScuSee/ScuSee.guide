This is version 1.2 of ScuSee which adds a data dumping facility
and the option to turn exec-debug routine output off...
Check the guide for more info...

The data dumping was requested by Martin Kresse on 26-03-1997.
I've added it to ScuSee the same night :)

@TITLE "ScuSee - Introduction"

   ScuSee
   ~~~~~~
   ScuSee is yet another system monitor but this time ONLY for scsi.device
   related devices. This utility shows all commands send to a device and
   after the command returns it shows the returning values. I know that you
   can monitor devices with Snoopy and so but Snoopy can't show any of the
   return values nor the scsi-commands embedded in the special scsi-command
   structure. I wrote this little util because I'm currently trying to write
   a scsi.class. But because scsi-documentation is very limited and some vendors
   have special commands which only some programmers know which are then very hard
   to get, I'm now able to rip them myself and examine them by easily turning on
   ScuSee and watching what is happening. You can even use it to see commands coming
   from Mac programs emulated by Shapeshifter and using a scsi-device. Some cd-writers
   use special commands, issued by special software, not available for Amiga mostly.
   You could use a ShapeShifted Amiga to rip these of the Mac software by using this
   scsi command viewer. ANY program issueing scsi commands using devices can be caught
   usign this program. Also special commands for the Iomega Zip/Jaz can be found by this
   utility, and thus you can easily create all the software you need. From 1.2 and up you
   can dump the output to a file, including the data field.

@TITLE "ScuSee - System Requirements"

   System Requirements
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   First of all you need an Amiga equipped with OS2+ (v37+) this is solely
   to force anyone with an kick1.3 Amiga to upgrade (1.3 is obsolete anyway).
   For the rest you'll only need either a place where scusee can write a
   dumpfile or either a terminal hooked up on your internal serial-port or
   have sushi running.


@ENDNODE

@NODE "INTRO_USE" "ScuSee.guide/INTRO_USE"
@TITLE "ScuSee - Using"

   Using
   ~~~~~
   All options are parsed with ReadArgs() with the following template:

   "D=Device,U=Unit/N,NoExec/S,F=DumpFile/K,MDL=MaxDataLength/N/K,IC=IgnoreC/S,C=Commands,I=Ignore/S,T=Tasks/M"

   where

   Device        = (scsi)device name to see.¹
   Unit          = Unit to open.
   NoExec        = Disables output to exec debugging functions.
   DumpFile      = Filename where output should be written to includes data fields.
   MaxDataLength = Maximum length of a data field to dump. When the data field
                   is bigger, the data will be truncated.
   IgnoreC       = Ignore Commands given, show others.
                   Else show Commands given, ignore others.
   Commands      = !Quoted! list containing multiple command numbers to ignore.
                   NOTE: Leave two (2) empty spaces at the end.
   Ignore        = Ignore Tasks given, show others.
                   Else show Tasks given, ignore others.
   Tasks         = Task-names to ignore/show, quote them if required.

   ¹ = Also (fake) scsi.device for internal a6oo/a12oo IDE-controller.
       Non-scsi command recognising drivers will be ignored.

   While running you can press CTRL-C to quit the monitoring.
                               CTRL-D to disable info-output.
                               CTRL-E to enable info-output.

   The Commands option has something special to it, this because the AmigaOS ReadArgs()
   function allows only one switch with multiple arguments. This cannot be done otherwise
   so it's not a bug or misfeature of the function. Anyway to allow multiple arguments for
   Commands too you'll have to put the numbers between quotes and add two more spaces at
   the end of the line. The program then sends it again as a seperate part to ReadArgs()
   which parses this and viola two multiple arguments at work. Numbers should be entered
   in hexadecimal form eg 10 (ten) = A.

   Examples:

   o Monitor Device "scsi.device" Unit 0 (happens to be my IDE-Syquest 105)
     and _ignore_ the tasks called "ScsiMounter" and "SRC":
     ScuSee D=squirrelscsi.device U=3 I Tasks="ScsiMounter" T=SRC

   o Monitor Device "squirrelscsi.device" Unit 5 (happens to be my Iomega Jaz)
     and show only the task called "ScsiMounter":
     ScuSee D=squirrelscsi.device U=5 Tasks="ScsiMounter"

   o Monitor Device "squirrelscsi.device" Unit 5 (happens to be my Iomega Jaz)
     and dump all output to ram:dump, also dump data fields upto 1000 bytes and
     don't output anything to the exec-debugging ports:
     ScuSee D=squirrelscsi.device U=5 NoExec F=ram:dump MDL=1000

   o Monitor Device "squirrelscsi.device" Unit 3 (happens to be my Sony CDU-76S)
     and _Show_ only the task called "ACDPlay", all other tasks are ignored.
     Also _ignore_ the scsi-commands 0x42, 0x1 and 0x12. Notice the quotes (")
     around the numbers and the trailing double-space.:
     ScuSee D=squirrelscsi.device U=3 Tasks="CD0" T=ScsiMounter IC C="42 0 12  "

     Use the above command to skip ReadSubChannel, TestUnitReady and Inquiry, great for
     checking what scsi-cd-player programs like ACDPlay are doing with your cd-player!

   o Monitor Device from CDROM_DEVICE Unit from CDROM_UNIT and show all.
     SetEnv CDROM_DEVICE squirrelscsi.device
     SetEnv CDROM_UNIT   3
     ScuSee

   The command line options override the ENV settings for CDROM_DEVICE and CDROM_UNIT.

   ~~~~~~~
   Whenever a new release of ScuSee gets released, I will post some
   information in the appropriate newsgroups of some electronic networks.
   The new archive will soon be available on many bulletin boards and on
   all `Aminet' FTP servers. You will be able to find ScuSee on the Aminet

                   - Fixed problems when there where no tasks given.
                   - io_Length is also checked now before presuming io_Data to be SCSICmd.
                   - Added some extra infos from ScsiCmd.
   36.3 20.05.1996 - Fixed parm passing in Outy() macro which f*ck*d up all arguments.

   36.7 26.03.1997 - Added data-dumping (Requested by Martin Kresse)
                   - Added MaxDataLength for dumping.
                   - Moved Tasks/M and Ignore to the end of the readargs list.
                   - Added NoExec option which ommits the exec-debug routine output.
                   - 1.2 Aminet Release in dev/moni.

   Future
   ~~~~~~
   The following things are lined up for the next releases.
   ScuSee 2.0 _will_ support:
   - SCSI-Command database mad up out of a pure ascii config file.
     Totally configurable, holding all scsi-commands.
   Other things in my mind:
   - GUI that looks like the one from Snoopdos but build with Relative.
   - Support for other types of devices, which will make it a
     device snooper.
   - pOS versions.
