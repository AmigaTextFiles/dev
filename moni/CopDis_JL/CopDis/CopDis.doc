              A Copper Disassembler for Workbench Copperlists

How to run:

Type CopDis from the CLI/Shell. CopDis does not work from an Icon.

You may specify an optional output device/file by the standard
redirection syntax, 'copdis >prt:' for example.


What does it do?

Have you ever needed to look at how a workbench copperlist is built up?

Well, I was intrigued at how the copperlists for 'odd' screenmodes
(Super72, A2024, etc) were built up, so I decided to write a copperlist
disassembler.

It scans the GfxBase->CopInit, and then follows this through to the main
copperlist disassembling as it goes. Currently it does not support copper
branching, except for the branch at the end of the CopInit structure.

It supports all standard Amiga registers, the ECS registers and the new
AGA chipset registers, so now you can see how all those weird DblPal
modes really work.


Warning!
--------

Do not make any assumptions in your code about the information
returned by this program. Copperlists vary widely from machine to
machine, and poking them *will* fail on other Amiga versions. Also
beware, AGA registers *WILL* change on future Amigas. Do not use
AGA registers unless you are 100% sure you are running on an Amiga
1200 or 4000.
