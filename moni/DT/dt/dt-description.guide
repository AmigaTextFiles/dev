@NODE "Read first"

READ FIRST!

FOR DEVPAC USER:

Don't assemble with DebugLine-Information, crashs will be the affect.
Deplode the DT file and rename it to MonAm. (Use Imploder or Powerpacker)

GENERAL USE:

Use @{"STEP" LINK "STEP"} and @{"NEXT" LINK "NEXT"} to debug, because
@{"TRACE" LINK "TRACE"} is a stackoperation command. Use it only in ROM.
If a program goes to wait state, it could be possible that the program
wants a input at the std-input window. Some programs use the ReadArg
function of dos. (Like list)
So type in a argumentstring or just enter.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Tooltypes"

TOOLTYPES:

You can set following tooltypes with the workbench:

PUBSCREEN=xxxx      This open the windows on the @{"PublicScreen" LINK "PublicScreen"} xxx
PREFS=xxxxx         Use special prefsfile normaly set to "ENVARC:DT/DT.Prefs"
		    please remeber when you save the prefs!
LIBFILE=xxxx        Liboffset filename. Standard = "ENVARC:DT/DT.LibFile",
		    Look at @{"LIBFILE" LINK "LIBFILE"}.
STARTUPPREFS=xxxx   Prefsfile for starting setups.
WORKBENCH           Use workbench for windows
COLOR               Make a colorflash at start.(Only for visual testing)
ICONIFY		    Iconify the DT at start

If a keyword is wrong the screen will be flashing at start-> Please
check the info of the icon !

@ENDNODE

@NODE "LIBFILE"

LIBFILE DESCRIPTION:

The libfile for the automatic offsetname creation is normaly placed in
"ENV:DT/DT.LibFile". You can set the filename with a @{"tooltype" LINK "TOOLTYPES"}
File format:

The first two numbers are the filelength in kbyte.
 |
 V
16*test.library  A star is the sign for a new Libraryname 
FirstFunction    Begin with offset -30,-36,-42,...(FirstFunction=-30)
---NextFunction  - jumps over one function (if not implemented or
		 private)
LastFunction     LastFuntion=-60
** ; Ende        If the first character of the libraryname is a * then is
		 the end of the file reached.
                 Everything afer this two stars is not important

@NODE "Floitingpoint"

FLOITINGPOINT WINDOW:

This window show you the values of the FP-Registers. Only available on
FPU-Machines.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Startup"

STARTUP-PREFS:

The window allows you to set following parameters:

With the cycle-gadget you can choose the start emulation from workbench
or CLI.

Current-Dir     Actual directory for the debugfile
Std-Output      Output specification
Arguments       Cli arguments to set for the executeable file
		(only for CLI)
Start exec.	This command line will be executed at start of the program.
		If the string starts with (the command will not be executed)

The LISTVIEW is for the workbench tooltypes simulation.
If you start a program from Devpac, then you will need a standard tool
icon in the ENVARC:Sys drawer called "def_tool.info".
Please use the full path in the load requester if you simulate a
workbench start!

@ENDNODE

@NODE "StartAdress"

STARTADRESS:

Key: A
Ask you for a @{"Expression" LINK "Expression"} and the display will be
refreshed. This function does'nt reset the @{"Lock" LINK "Lock"}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Load"

LOAD:

Key: L
Load an file and search for symboltable. Unload the last loaded file if
exists. Type full path and name if you simulate a workbench start.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "RUN"

RUN:

Key: R
Run the program started with the current @{"PrgCounter" LINK "PrgCounter"}.
Exceptions like ADRESS or ILLEGAL-Errors will be hunted and displayed
(the prg will be stoped).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "NEXT"

NEXT:

Sets breakpoint over next instruction and run the program. Current @{"Breakpoint" LINK "Breakpoint"}
will be cleared.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "STEP"

STEP:

Key: Z
Trace is a single step with the TraceMode of the 680xx. You can trace in
the ROM too. Be careful and use @{"Breakpoints" LINK "Breakpoints"}, @{"NEXT" LINK "NEXT"}
or TRACE to debug.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "TRACE"

TRACE:

Key: T
Normaly goes over the next instruction, not into subroutines. Warning:
This is a stack operating instruction. If the @{"PC" LINK "PC"} is
pointing to a MOVEM xx,-(sp) or LINK, then this function will stop at the
equivalent MOVEM (sp)+,xx , UNLINK.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "BACK"

BACK:

Key: S

Goes one stackdepth back. Use it to go out from a subrountine.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "UNTIL"

UNTIL:

Key: U

Run until a memoryadress is changing or reached a constant.

Syntax examples:
 m$46.l           Stops if the longword of the address $46 is changing
 mDataBase+4*10   Stops if the word of DataBase+4*10 is changing
 sCount.b         You will be ask for the stop value. For example 46
                  If the byte on the address Count is 46, the program will
		  be halted.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "UNTIL Register"

UNTIL REGISTER:

Key: D

Runs until a register has an adress reached or has been modified.

Syntay examples:
 md0                Stops if the lower word of d0 has changed
 sa3.l              You will be ask for a stop value, for example $78ac30
                    The program will be halted if the Adressregister 3 has
		    the value $78ac30

Praxis example:
 You want to know were the program open the dos.library.
 Search for the string 'dos.library' in the memory-window. The OpenLibrary
 function needs in a1 the pointer to the name of the library, so
 Run @{"UNTIL Register" LINK "UNTIL Register} d1 has the adress of the
 dosstring reached. The program will stop after the instruction
 LEA $xxxxx,a1 or MOVE.L #$xxxx,a1,...

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Level6"

LEVEL6 INTERRUPT:

Why not the Level7 ?
Simple reason: The A300,A4000,A1200 has no level7 interrupt.

Hardware:

You can stop the running program at any point exept in the ROM or when
the Task is in the waiting state. Maybe use ARTM-Tool to set to
RUNNING-State!

Hardware A500,A2000,A3000,A4000:
 Install a button between Pin22 and Ground (Pin1-4) on the expansion
 port.

Hardware A1200:
 Connect 138 (EINT) with 139(GND).
 (Not tested)

If you press and the screen turns red-> The task is in the WAITING-Sate
If the screen will be green-> Task runs in the rom.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Lock"

LOCK:

Key: L

Locks the windowrefresh after @{"TRACE" LINK "TRACE"} @{"STEP" LINK "STEP"} @{"BACK" LINK "BACK"}
@{"RUN" LINK "RUN"} @{"NEXT" LINK "NEXT"} to the lockexpression. To clear the lock
type in a empty string. The lock can be any @{"Expression" LINK "Expression"}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "PC"

PC:

Program counter is displayed in the @{"RegisterWindow" LINK "RegisterWindow"} and points
to the next instruction that will be executed.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Expression"

EXPRESSION:

An expression can be a complex calculationstring.You can use brackets
to discribe a order. @{"Labels" LINK "Labels"} are strings starting with a
ALPHA char. Use '$' for hexadezimal and '%' for binary strings. You don't
have to kill the expresion. With {}.x you can read the adress.
(For pointer operations!) (x for size)

Examples:
{4}.x+29   : Show you the ExecBase+297. (Processorinfos)
	     .x statds for the size (w=word, l=long, u=unsigned word)    

You typed in $c56a67. Now you want to set to the label Start
Add this   : Start$c56a67
OK. Simple : If the place were the next mathematik operand should be, a
	     Char or '$','%',';' or ',' is, will the calcstring be cuted.
Think about... Its easy and useful.

If you click into a disasseble or memory window wihle the expression window
is opened then the line- or value-adress of the memory will be replaced
with the current editstring if the cursor is in the first charactar, else
the value will be added at the cursor.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Labels"

LABELS:

Reserved:
a0-a7, d0-d7, fpiar (FPU only), PC (current @{"PrgCounter" LINK "PC"})
seg0,seg1,...  is used for the segment startadresses. Useful for save and
search operations.

The debuger get the labels from the filesymboltable or directly from
DEVPAC. This DT is special used for DEVPAC. You can replace the MONAM with
this DT. Just rename the original and replace it with DT and rename it
to "MonAm".

Show at @{"Read first" LINK "Read first"}

@ENDNODE

@NODE "REXX"

REXX commands:

The rexxport is called "DT.x". (X is the number of the DT-Task.)

  1 = Wrong bracket
  2 = Bracket missing
  3 = " missing
