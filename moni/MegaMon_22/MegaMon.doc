 all other commands will be described in the MegaMon V1.82 docs
 the V1.82 version was fully written by Ghost of MASQUERADE (ex Endless Piracy)
 the V2.2 version was ONLY AN UPDATE by C-Reator of Possessed from this
 MEGAGREAT Monitor only the commands described in this docs were installed
 into the version V1.82 from Ghost, also the mostly of THIS MegaMon
 version was coded by HIM remember it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 the mostly new thing by this version is the installed EDITOR it is
 possible to move the cursor in all 4 directions coz of the installed
 screenbuffer its now possible to correct/change a wrong written command by
 going into the last line!, showing the text on the address ($40000)
 going up changing the text and changing the a command with the e command
 and pressing return until all lines of the displayed memory will be left
 this also works by the asm command in connection with the dissasm command
 also by displaying the directory go into the correct line with the correct
 file and insert the l L or other command!!!!
 and all other you will change!

 the CTRL key will break now some commands (not all coz its inpossible)
 some bugs are removed

 write to Ghost if you are possible to tell him new ideas for new Versions
 also you can contact me I will tell him this ideas
