What is so special about PrintDoc?
    PrintDoc prints documents (you guessed that, right?) using "PAR:".
    "Why PAR:?" you might think. Well, if I use PRT: umlauts will be
    printed by printing a vocal, moving the printerhead backwards and
    adding two dots. This takes some time (so few it's not really worth
    mentioning) and it looks disgusting, nasty, ugly. Hmmm, just copy
    the file to PAR: and that's it you think. Unfortunately, that's not
    what the printer thinks. If you give him, for example, an "ä" it
    prints some strange italic character, bearing not the slightest
    resemblance with an "ä". To make it print an "ä" you need to edit
    the textfile and replace it with a "{". Very strange. This you need
    to do for every umlaut. The only problem is, that you cannot use
    the "{" and other characters any more since they will output an
    umlaut. So you have to add printer-commands for changing the printer-
    keymap to your textfile. LOTS of work. Nothing for people as lazy
    as me. So I took TurboDEX from FF #625 and wrote PrintDoc. It does
    the whole job automatically. No editing , no swearing any more when
    you realize that you missed one character in an important business
    letter. Another fine reason for using PrintDoc is its size. It is
    a mere 1.4KB long!

How do I use PrintDoc?
    Well, that's the most simple thing on the world. Just enter the
    CLI/Shell and type "PrintDoc mytext" to print a textfile called
    "mytext" If the name of the textfile contains blanks you don't
    need to enclose it in double-quotes. PrintDoc takes any character
    beyond the first blank as the name of the textfile.

Does PrintDoc run with my printer, too?
    I wrote PrintDoc for the Star LC-10. I don't know what is different
    about other printers in this respect, so just try it. If you
    encounter any problems, send me a disk with a file containing the
    description of your problem, the translation-chart for country-
    specific characters and the code for invoking usa-keymap and your
    keymap and I will see what I can do for you (If you want me to write
    back, you better send my a self-addressed and stamped envelope).
    Ooh, if you own TurboDEX yourself you can of course alter the code
    on your own account.

PrintDoc trashed my computer, formatted my harddisk and hid my backup!
    I think you better buy a new one... Anyway, it's YOUR very problem
    what YOU do with my very program. I cannot be taken responsible for

    psychical! By the way: It's highly impossible that PrintDoc will
