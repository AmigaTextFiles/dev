SGMLS is THE SGML Parser!
.description
Sgmls parses and validates the SGML document entity in a file and prints
on the standard output a simple ASCII representation of its Element
Structure Information Set. (This is the information set which a structure-
controlled conforming SGML application should act upon.)
Note that the document entity may be spread amongst several files; for
example, the SGML declaration, document type declaration and document
instance set could each be in a separate file.

Before you ask:
SGML means Standard Generalized Markup Language :)
