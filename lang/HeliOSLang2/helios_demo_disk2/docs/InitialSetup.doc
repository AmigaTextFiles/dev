Welcome to HeliOS!

We hope that you will enjoy using this software, and to help you get
the most out of it we would first like to tell you a little about the
HeliOS support service.

HeliOS is a "living" language which is under constant development
and which literally grows with every passing week.  We make any new
developments immediately available to all HeliOS users, and we are
happy to provide a low cost update service so that everyone can get
new material as soon as it is available.

Because HeliOS is a new and rapidly expanding language it is in
everyone's interest to register and participate in the HeliOS user
group and the update service.  A community of programmer's can help
each other with shared code and ideas, and Helios Software are always
pleased to help this process by acting as a central "library" for
material submitted by HeliOS programmers.

Above all, we want to sustain the creative Amiga programming community
by providing software tools which enhance this excellent computer, and
to do this we need YOUR feedback.  So remember that HeliOS is here for
your benefit, and we are happy to consider adding new features which YOU
suggest and to pass on interesting new ideas between HeliOS users.

Enjoy using HeliOS and help us to make this a really creative programming
tool by sharing your ideas and suggestions with us and other programmers.

****************************
Installation and first steps
****************************

You may wish to use the HDInstall program provided to install HeliOS
onto your system, but we will give here a descriptive overview of the
installation for those who wish to do it themselves manually.  It is
always useful, especially to a programmer, to know exactly how your
software is installed.

If you use the HDInstall software it will create a directory called
"HeliOS" in your designated path and then make an assign "HeliOS:"
to this directory.  You may wish to do the same, because HeliOS will
always automatically look in the assigned "HeliOS:" path first when
looking for its startup configuration files. (See below)

The main program is just a single file and does not absolutely require
ANY special installation, assigns, libraries, or path setting: if you
are really impatient you can just execute the "HeliOS_int" program.

For a really simple installation you only need copy the executable to
your chosen path and run it, but we recommend that you perform the full
installation to get the best results from using the software.

There are various configuration, macro, and help files which can be
created and used with HeliOS, and although these are not essential for
the initial loading of the program it really is best to install them.

There are also precompiled include files which you will probably need,
sooner or later, as well as the various source code and document files.

As an initial installation we recommend that you create a HeliOS directory
(and the HeliOS: assign) then copy all the HeliOS files into it, with
subdirectories for "Docs", "Source" etc.

The configuration files described below should be placed into the root
"HeliOS:" directory, or into your "S:" directory, as an initial setup. As
you will see, you can always move them later if required.

********************************************
Configuration files and the "HeliOS:" assign
********************************************

At startup time HeliOS looks for various configuration files, to set things
like your preferred user environment and colours etc.  It is important that
you understand that these files are not necessary for the general operation
of HeliOS, but are there to allow you to specify customised settings of
various program parameters.

HeliOS looks for these configuration files when it starts up, to check if
you require any custom settings when the software is first loaded.

Because you may wish to keep different configuration setting for different
contexts, and because most people like to be in control of where programs
store information, HeliOS allows great flexibility in where you keep your
configuration files.

As mentioned above, if you want to keep all your HeliOS files together it
is probably best to create an "Assign" called "HeliOS:" and put all your
HeliOS system and configuration files into this directory.  This "HeliOS:"
directory will, if present, be used at startup time as the PRIMARY default
initial configuration file path.

However, HeliOS does also allow you to set up from within the software
separate load paths for most of its configuration files, so once you are
familiar with HeliOS you can change things to suit your own preferences.

*****************************
The "HeliOS Environment" file
*****************************

The first thing which HeliOS does when it loads is to attempt to find and
load the "HeliOS_Environment" file.  This file contains all the information
necessary for the user-configuration of the software, and also all the path
information for any configuration files stored in user-defined directories.

The "HeliOS Environment" file is the most important configuration file
because it actually stores all the initial load path information for all
the other configuration files.  Obviously this "master" configuration file
cannot define its own load path, so HeliOS must look in certain places to
try to find "HeliOS_Environment" before loading anything else.

HeliOS will first look for the "HeliOS Environment" file in the assigned
"HeliOS:" directory, and if this fails it will next look in "S:".

If both these attempts fail, no "HeliOS_Environment" file will be loaded,
and consequently the HeliOS software will start up with default settings.

******************
Initial load paths
******************

The default settings will cause HeliOS to look for the rest of its initial
configuration files first in the "HeliOS:" and then in the "S:" directory.

If you want to store your various configuration files (other than the main
"HeliOS_Environment" file) in directories other than "HeliOS:" or "S:" you
are at liberty to do so.  If you use the options within the software to set
up and save your own default paths for the configuration and include files,
HeliOS will attempt to load the files at startup from your designated paths.

If HeliOS fails to load the configuration files from their designated paths
it will always revert to its default action and look first in the assigned
"HeliOS:" directory and then in the "S:" directory for the files.

You can have some files in designated directories, some in the "HeliOS:"
directory and some in the "S:" directory if you wish.  In any case where
there is a file with the same name in more than one directory, a file in
a designated directory will take precedence, followed by the "HeliOS:"
directory, followed by"S:".

***************************************
A discussion on the configuration files
***************************************

Here are the default file names for the configuration files which HeliOS
attempts to load at startup:

HeliOS_Environment     -> HeliOS environment configuration
HeliOS_MenuText        -> Menu text definition ASCII file
HeliOS_Imagery         -> GUI imagery IFF file

HeliOS_KeyTable        -> Command key assignment ASCII file
HeliOS_Colours         -> Colour settings
HeliOS_Macros          -> Default Macros
HeliOS_VocabularyHelp  -> Default Vocabulary Help ASCII file
HeliOS_UserInclude     -> Optional default User include file
HeliOS_AmigaInclude    -> Optional default Amiga include file

The first three files are special cases which we shall discuss in a moment,
but you have four choices with respect to installing each of the last six
listed configuration files:

1. Omit the files completely, so that HeliOS retains its default setup.

2. Store them wherever you like and give them each individual path
   assignments and file names from within the software.

3. Store them with the default name in the HeliOS: directory

4. Store them with the default name in the S: directory


********************************************
The three "special case" configuration files
********************************************

The three "special case" files are:

HeliOS_Environment     -> HeliOS environment configuration
HeliOS_MenuText        -> Menu text definition ASCII file
HeliOS_Imagery         -> GUI imagery IFF file

These files are treated as follows.

1.

The main "HeliOS_Environment" file is a special case, as we have already
explained, and must always be stored in the "HeliOS:" or "S:" directories
with a fixed filename called "HeliOS_Environment".

2.

The "HeliOS_MenuText" file is another special case because it must always
be given the specific name "HeliOS_MenuText" and HeliOS will always try
to load it from the same designated path as the "HeliOS_KeyTable" file.

This is because it is mainly used in conjunction with the "HeliOS_Keytable"
file and these two files generally are mutually dependant.

If you always put the "HeliOS_MenuText" file in the same directory as the
"HeliOS_KeyTable" file it will be loaded at startup from that directory.
However, if the file cannot be found there, HeliOS will nevertheless still
attempt to load the file on its own from the "HeliOS:" or "S:" directories.

In other words the "HeliOS_MenuText" file can only have its directory
designated together with the "HeliOS_KeyTable" file and not individually.

3.

The "HeliOS_Imagery" file is a third special case.

This file need not be present at all, and in this case HeliOS will simply
use its own internal built-in default imagery.

However, if you choose to design your own customised HeliOS GUI imagery,
you can edit the file called "HeliOS_Imagery_See_ReadMe".

The file "HeliOS_Imagery_See_ReadMe" contains all the HeliOS GUI imagery
in the form of an IFF picture.

This IFF picture may be edited in any art package (such as DPaint) and
changed as required.  Once edited, the file should be saved as an ordinary
IFF file with the same dimensions as the original.

If the filename of "HeliOS_Imagery_See_ReadMe" is changed to "HeliOS_Imagery"
and the file is placed in either the "S:" or the "HeliOS:" directory, HeliOS
will pick up its GUI imagery at startup from this "HeliOS_Imagery" IFF file.

Since the HeliOS program already contains its own imagery in its standard
form you should not (and do not need to) use the "HeliOS_Imagery" file
unless you wish to use your own different imagery.

If you do use the "HeliOS_Imagery" file it will add a short extra delay
to the startup of the HeliOS program as the new graphics are loaded.

Remember that if you do choose to edit the HeliOS GUI imagery you must
ensure that all the positions and sizes of the various images must be
retained exactly as in the original: otherwise you will observe jarring
visual misalignments in the GUI graphical imagery when using HeliOS.


***********************************************
How to set up your own configuration file paths
***********************************************

You will possibly want to set up your configuration file, user environment,
and path defaults before getting down to using the HeliOS software, so here
is a brief description of how to do this.

As we said, there are 6 configuration files which can have their automatic
startup path defaults saved as a simple operation from within HeliOS:

HeliOS_KeyTable        -> Command key assignment ASCII file
HeliOS_Colours         -> Colour settings
HeliOS_Macros          -> Default Macros
HeliOS_VocabularyHelp  -> Default Vocabulary Help ASCII file
HeliOS_UserInclude     -> Optional default User include file
HeliOS_AmigaInclude    -> Optional default Amiga include file

To set any of these file paths from within HeliOS you merely have to use
the file requester to navigate to the chosen path, then use the menu
option "Save all paths" to preserve your new settings.

To use the file requester to set specific paths, simply use either the Load
or the SaveAs options for the particular file you wish to set.  For example,
using "Load colours" or "Save colours as" will set the internal Colour file
default path.  You can then save the new path setting by using the "Save all
paths" menu function.

There are options to Load and/or SaveAs each of the above six configuration
files within the HeliOS software, and when you use the Load/SaveAs options
the file requester will always appear preset to the current internally set
default path for the particular category of file. If you then navigate using
the file requester to some other path, this will now be remembered by HeliOS
and the software will have its internal paths set to the last path set in
the requester.

You always need to use "Save all paths" if you want HeliOS to remember its
current path settings next time it loads, otherwise the current internal
settings will be lost when you close the program.

Note that you can have as many versions of the configuration files as you
wish and selectively load whichever you want to use currently.

Remember:

You MUST use "Save all paths" in order for your new path settings to be 
remembered the next time HeliOS is at started, and note that this function 
will also save all the Editor paths at the same time.

*******
Warning
*******

Note that paths can only be set or changed by using the file requester to
do a real operation.  Selecting "Forget it" in the file requester will NOT
result in the path being set.


*******************************
Saving the HeliOS "Environment"
*******************************

Several other options, such as "scroll settings", "default ruler" etc. can
be saved as defaults, and in each case their settings are saved within the
main "HeliOS_Environment" file.

Once you have the program running, you may wish to reset many user options
to your own preferences.  If you then select the "Save environment" menu
option, a new user environment file will be saved into your default
startup directory.

The next time you load HeliOS your new settings will be loaded at startup
as the defaults.

Note that all the user options are distributed within the menu system rather
than collected together in a single requester.  For example, you may set
the editor scrolling speed from within the editor, then set the interpreter
output buffer from the interpreter: both these new settings could then be
preserved together by using the "Save environment" menu option.


********************
Quick Save functions
********************

HeliOS has several "Quick Save" options whereby a default configuration
file can be saved without recourse to the file requester.  For example,
"Save Colours" will save the Colour configuration to the default path
without presenting you with the requester.

When you use the "Quick Save" functions for any of the configuration files,
they will always be saved into the current default user designated path if
that path is legal.  Otherwise the "HeliOS:" directory will be used if it
is available:, and finally they will be saved into your "S:" directory if
no other option is available.


*********************
Setting up Menu texts
*********************

There is an ASCII file by default called "HeliOS_MenuText" which, if placed
in its default startup directory, will allow you to specify your own Menu
Texts, Key Index text, and the messages associated with the file requester
title bar.

This file is easy to edit, and contains simple instructions within itself
for how to do the editing.

If this file is not present, default texts will be used.

The facility to change menu texts is really necessary only if you have
changed the command key sequences, because in this case the original menu
texts would incorrectly represent your chosen command keys.

You may also wish to change the editor "Key Index" menu to include any
information which you find particularly useful: this special menu allows
you to have available from the menu bar a full page of reference text
which can be changed using the "HeliOS_MenuText" file.

************************
Setting up shortcut keys
************************

There is an ASCII file called "HeliOS_KeyTable" which, if placed in the
default startup directory, will allow you to specify all shortcut keys.

This is a simple "tabular" file which contains its own editing instructions.

If this file is not present, default settings will be used.

Shortcut keys can also be "re-bound" from within the software, and at any
time an ASCII "KeyTable" file representing the current key bindings can be
saved either as the default or as a KeyTable file under a chosen name by
using the "Save key table" menu option (in the editor "Options" menu).

As well as being able to generate a new KeyTable file containing the current
key commands, you can also re-generate a standard default KeyTable by using
a simple "trick".  To do this simply load HeliOS with no keytable file, or
attempt to load an invalid keytable file: if you do this the default key
bindings will be restored and you can save the standard default KeyTable.

*******************************
Setting up include symbol files
*******************************

HeliOS uses precompiled include files for extremely fast access to include
symbol values.

See the "Include File" documentation for a full detailed discussion of this
powerful HeliOS feature.

There are two types of HeliOS "include" symbol files which may be loaded
automatically at startup and retained "on-line" at all times.

These files do not need to be kept in any special directory, and their load
paths can be specified from within the software.  This is useful because
you may choose to have several of these files, which can be quite large,
and it is often most appropriate to keep them in the directories where the
programs to which they relate are stored.

The "User include" file can have symbols added and removed from within the
HeliOS software, and is intended to be a flexible symbol resource which you
can update as you work on a particular software project.

The "Amiga" include is less flexible, and is intended to be a fixed large
symbol base, such as the full set of Amiga include symbols.

Both files are identical in format and it is only the "slot" into which
they are loaded which determines how they are used.

An Amiga include file containing all the Amiga symbols is provided with
HeliOS, and you will probably wish to have this file loaded automatically
at startup.

All HeliOS include files are in a special encrypted format, but they can be
easily loaded and modified within the software.  Alternatively they can be
saved into ASCII format, edited, and then recompiled into the HeliOS include
file format.

HeliOS include files can also be specified and loaded from within the code
of your own programs, making them a very flexible symbol resource.

**************************
Setting up vocabulary help
**************************

HeliOS allows you to define your own on-line vocabulary help on the word
currently under the cursor when Ctrl-Help is pressed.  This works in both
the interpreter and the editor, and is designed to be used as an on-line
dictionary and general purpose reference system.

The vocabulary help system also has the facility to auto-load a default
file called "HeliOS_VocabularyHelp" at startup time.  You can also load
a vocabulary help file at any time later from within the HeliOS program.

HeliOS comes with an example "HeliOS_VocabularyHelp" file, and this can
be edited and extended in any ASCII editor.  The file itself contains
instructions on how to add your own entries, and we suggest that you load
it into a text editor and try adding some new entries of your own to get
a feel for how the system works.

************************************************************
Setting up HeliOS paths other than the Default Startup paths
************************************************************

There are various load and save functions within HeliOS, and these can
generally have customised default path settings.  This means, for example,
that you can set up the program by default to have each editor using a
different initial path, just as you can have the colour load path set to
wherever you want to keep your colour config files.

The editor paths, like the config file paths, may be saved complete with
filenames, so you can start up HeliOS, go into one of the editors, and find
the file requester all set up with the name of your file ready to load.

To change and save any of the default paths you use the same method:

1. First use Load/SaveAs for all the functions you wish to configure, thus
   setting the current file requester paths to your chosen ones.

   For example, you should go into all the editors and load or save a file
   to set up the path, then use the colour, macro and other save functions
   to set up these paths etc.

2. Having set all the paths to your liking you can use a menu option from
   the editor or interpreter to "Save all paths".

   This will copy the current paths into the user configuration file and
   save that file as the default startup.

   All your newly set paths will from now on be loaded at startup.

Note again that:

Paths can only be set or changed by using the file requester to do a
real operation.  Selecting "Forget it" in the file requester will not
result in the path being set.

These are the initial default path and filename settings of all the
configurable paths:

Colours          'HeliOS:HeliOS_Colours'
KeyTable         'HeliOS:HeliOS_KeyTable'
Environment      'HeliOS:HeliOS_Environment'
Macros           'HeliOS:HeliOS_Macros'
Vocabulary Help  'HeliOS:HeliOS_VocabularyHelp'
User Include     'HeliOS:HeliOS_UserInclude'
Amiga Include    'HeliOS:HeliOS_AmigaInclude'
General          'Sys:'
PreLoad/PreSave  'Sys:'
Editor 1         'Sys:'
Editor 2         'Sys:'
Editor 3         'Sys:'
"OUT" Editor     'Sys:'

***************
Getting Started
***************

Once you have installed HeliOS you should run the program and go into
Editor1 by pressing the "Ed 1" button.

Once you are in Editor 1 you will see a small red and white triangular
gadget in the header bar: this is the "Quick Load" button.

Use this Quick Load button or the menu "Load file" option to load a file,
and you should find the file requester already preset to "Tutorial.Doc"
(assuming that the installation was "correct"!).

Load the "Tutorial.Doc" and proceed from there!
