Creating your own customised HeliOS GUI imagery
***********************************************

The file "HeliOS_Imagery_See_ReadMe" contains all the HeliOS GUI imagery
in the form of an IFF picture.

This IFF picture may be edited in any art package (such as DPaint) and
changed as required.  Once edited, the file should be saved as an ordinary
IFF file with the same dimensions as the original.

If the filename of "HeliOS_Imagery_See_ReadMe" is changed to "HeliOS_Imagery"
and the file is placed in either the "S:" or the "HeliOS:" directory, HeliOS
will pick up its GUI imagery at startup from this "HeliOS_Imagery" IFF file.

Since the HeliOS program already contains its own imagery in its standard
form, you do not need to (and should not) use the "HeliOS_Imagery" file
unless you wish to use your own different imagery.

If you do use the "HeliOS_Imagery" file it will add a short extra delay
to the startup of the HeliOS program as the new graphics are loaded.

Remember that if you do choose to edit the HeliOS GUI imagery you must
ensure that all the positions and sizes of the various images must be
retained exactly as in the original: otherwise you will observe visible
misalignments in the GUI graphical imagery when using HeliOS.
