               country.

            -  you could modify it and distribute this new version but with
               a new version number and the history complete. If you want,
               you have the right to send your new version to the old author!

      I use String.Lib in many progs and the functions had been tested but
   I could not certifiate that there's no bugs. In fact there is no, but...
   So I could not be responsable of any damages on your files.





      Pat Quaid said in the doc of the compiler that it does not manipulate
   strings very well and don't have the good functions of Borland's Turbo
   Pascal. So I have decided to wrote those functions.

      They are under a runtime library form who had to be link to your prog
   with BLink (LIB option). The descriptions of the functions are in the
   string.i file wich best place is, for my mind, in the include:utils
   directory.

      The lybrary's functions are preceded of 'Str_' in order to avoid
   name conflict with other functions. There is three functions comming from
   Borland's language : Copy, Delete and Insert ; two usefull fonction I
   decide to include because they are very practical (but not very hard to
   do) : Lower and Upper ; and a very very usefull function but it seems to
   be a little harder than the two lasts : Str_C_Pos.

      All the functions allocate themself the memory for the returned string
   so you don't have to think about it. But in fact there is a restriction :
   you can not make something like :

            s := Str_Copy(s,10,10);

      because in memory you always have the primal string without any pointer
   to access it! So make something like :

            a := s;
            s := Str_Copy(s,10,10);
            freestring(a);

      I hope that those little functions would help you manipulating strings.
   Don't hesitate to contact me. And I'm sorry for my poor english...
