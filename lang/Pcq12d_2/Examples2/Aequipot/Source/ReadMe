To compile the program, you have to link two other libs to your 'PCQ.lib'.
First this is the file 'lreqglue.o' in the subdirectory 'obj' of the
'req.library'-package (Fish 419).
From the 'ILBM.library'-package (Fish 463) we first must build the file
'ILBMInterface.o'. From the subdirectory 'ASM' we copy 'IFF.i' and from the
subdirectory 'C' we copy 'ILBInterface.asm' to our subdirectory, where we
run 'A68K'. Now we compile the file 'ILBMInterface.asm':

A68K ILBMInterface.asm ILBMInterface.o

We copy 'ILBMInterface.o' and 'lreqglue.o' to the subdirectory which
contains the 'PCQ.lib' (mostly it's in the PCQ-Input-Directory). Now we
put together the old 'PCQ.lib' and the new files:

RENAME PCQ.lib TO PCQ.oldlib

JOIN PCQ.oldlib ILBMInterface.o lreqglue.o TO PCQ.lib

And now we can use the new libraries (don't forget the corresponding
include-files). Sorry, but not every function you can find in the two
libraries are supported by my two include-files.
