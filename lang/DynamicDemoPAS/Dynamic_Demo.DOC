Another small HiSpeed Pascal demo...

The program creates a Dynamic DataList, and displays the list graphically...
You can Insert New datarecords: - at position
                                - at the begin
                                - at the end
You can also DELETE a datarecord (any position!).

It tries to show you (simple) how a dynamic list can work (including
pointers)...

Have fun...

p.s. this will compile and run on : Atari (HiSpeed Pascal) and
                                    MSDos (Turbo Pascal >5.5).
