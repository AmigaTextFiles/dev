About GNU Smalltalk

GNU Smalltalk attempts to be a reasonably faithful implementation of
Smalltalk-80 {tm ParcPlace Systems} as described in the "Blue Book", also known
as "Smalltalk-80: the Language and its Implementation", by Adele Goldberg and
David Robson.  The syntax that the language accepts and the byte codes that the
virtual machine interprets are exactly as they appear in the Blue Book.  Most
of the primitives are the same as well, although due to the differing nature of
the implementation some of the primitives haven't been implemented, and other
new ones have been.


The current implementation has the following features:

  * Incremental garbage collector
  * Binary image save capability
  * C-callout (allows Smalltalk to invoke user-written C code and pass
    parameters to it)
  * GNU Emacs editing mode
  * Highly portable C code implementation
  * Optional byte code compilation tracing and byte code execution tracing
  * Automatically loaded per-user initialization files



Installing GNU Smalltalk

Please see the file mst.texinfo which contains the information on how to 
install GNU Smalltalk, and general documentation about the features of
the system.
