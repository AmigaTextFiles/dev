IMPLEMENTS	Release-notes for the Gambit Scheme Interpreter (gsi)
                version 1.8 for AmigaDOS 1.3/2.04, Motorola 68000/20/30/40.
AUTHOR		This document: Ken Dickey;  The system: Marc Feeley.

WHAT IS THIS THING?

The Gambit Scheme Interpreter (gsi) implements the full IEEE Scheme
Standard language (P1178) with extensions, including the new hygenic
R^4RS macros.  The interpreter requires about 1.5 MB to run but is
fairly fast.  The interpreter is freeware.

There is a compiler and runtime system with all sources available on a
separate disk.  The compiler requires a 3MB Amiga and a hard disk to
do effective development, but generates fast native 680x0 code.  You
can link Scheme and C code, call C code from Scheme, and create
stand-alone executable programs.  The compiler is shareware $40. 



WHAT IS HERE?

SCM.lha		-- Compressed file of scheme sources, unpacks into a
		directory called "Scm" {116 KB unpacked}

Gambit.lha	-- Compressed directories {1.4 MB unpacked}
		Gambit/bin  -- gsi variants
		Gambit/docs -- Read "Contents" and "QuickTour"
		Gambit/runtime -- the runtime system for minimal size

GSI.lha		-- Compressed version of "gsi.68k.emu"



HOW DO I GET STARTED?

Hard Disk System:
  Decide where you want your directories, cd there, then unarc the files.
  >> lharc x scm.lha
  >> lharc x gambit.lha
  Read the files "Gambit/docs/Contents" and "Gambit/docs/QuickTour"
  Decide which variant of GSI you want.
  Unpack it.
  Copy it to C:gsi

 Note: the easiest way to do all but the last step (copy to C:gsi) is
 to execute the script "InstallToHardDisk".  Read the script and make
 any changes you want before running it. 
  
Floppy Disk System:
  >> lharc x gambit.lha Gambit/docs/Contents
  >> lharc x gambit.lha Gambit/docs/QuickTour
  Read the files "Gambit/docs/Contents" and "Gambit/docs/QuickTour"
  Decide which variant of GSI you want.  The easiest is to take the
  68000 version.
  >> lharc x gsi.lha gsi.68k.emu
  >> rename gsi.68k.emu gsi


; NOTES

At the present time, gsi only runs on M680x0 based computers
(including M68000 to M68040).  Gsi has been tested on SUN-3,
HP9000/3xx, NeXT, Amiga and BBN GP1000 (Butterfly) computers.  A
variant of gsi has also been ported to the Macintosh.

The compiler and all sources are ShareWare $40 (to Marc).  Get it from
Fred Fish or send $5 to Ken Dickey (below) for disk, mailer, and
postage.

If you send Marc a contribution it will keep him motivated to improve
the system.  He has put man years into it.  Don't send money to me
(Ken).  I am doing this to help pay Marc back for making the system
available.  I think it is pretty neat, and I hope you do too.

Enjoy!
