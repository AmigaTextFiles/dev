This is posting one of three of a portable FORTH interpreter, written
entirely in C.  It has been successfully ported to a VAX 11/60 running
BSD 2.9, to EUNICE version 3 (I think), and the original machine, a VAX
11/780 running BSD 4.2.  When I mentioned in net.lang.forth (and elsewhere)
that I was writing this portable FORTH, several people asked that I post
the results of my labors. Well, here they are.

            [moderator's note:  I have had no luck at all getting through
	     to this address.  There was a missing file in the original
             distribution "forth.lex.h" which I have reconstructed
             (hopefully correctly).                    - John P. Nelson]
