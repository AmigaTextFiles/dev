    How to setup fpc for Amiga.

    All you have to do is edit bin/ppc.cfg
    I have used my settings as an example
    in ppc.cfg.

    Use absolut paths and not assigns.
    Assigns will NOT WORK.

    When you have set the correct paths for
    your system, save ppc.cfg.

    What's left is to set the path for bin.

    path <yourpath>/bin add

    If you are going to use fpc a lot put that
    line in s:user-startup.

    That's all.

    Have fun!
