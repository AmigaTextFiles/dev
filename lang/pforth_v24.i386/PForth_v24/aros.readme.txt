Ported to AROS by Adam Bricker: built Mar 31 2012 17:00:19 (static).

The version compiled is the unix stdio version.  The Posix version will not
compile under AROS due to missing dependencies.  To install it, copy it to
somewhere in your path or edit  S:User-Startup  and insert the statement 
"Path Mypath ADD" without the quotes and substituting the path for "Mypath".
Type "reboot cold" for it to take effect or just type the same path command
in the shell.  Alternatively, CD into the directory where PForth is located 
and type PForth. Two good Forth books which are available for free on the
internet are:

*  "Starting Forth"	http://www.forth.com/starting-forth/index.html
*  "Thinking Forth"	http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/

Both of these talk about using blocks,  PForth does not support blocks,  use
files instead and inside PForth type: "include myfile.f" or whatever the name
of your file is.  Don't forget the path if it's not in the current directory.
These books are good for beginner and intermediate Forth programmers and even
an advanced Forth programmer might learn a few things.

PForth compiled cleanly with no warnings.  One test out of 66 in t_corex.fth
failed, however, the comment says "Expected failure" so I assume it is 
supposed to do that.  All other tests passed in all the included test programs.
A program I ported to Forth in 2005 ran properly after making a few changes 
from the GForth version.  No extensive testing has been done and I am not a 
programmer by profession,  so if it doesn't work properly or if it corrupts
your hard drive (always make regular backups), I am not responsible, use at
your own risk and if it's broken, you fix it.  The original source code is
included in this archive.  However, with that said, I haven't found any bugs
yet.
