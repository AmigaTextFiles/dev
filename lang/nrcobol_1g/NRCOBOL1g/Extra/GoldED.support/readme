'COBOL' syntax parsers for GoldEd 4.7 and GoldEd 5.0

4.7 works well enough, although i would welcome feed back, on use or
improvements. BTW the continue option is a bit ropey, but it wont break ya ;)
Supplementary dictionary file option to follow....

5.0 untested, but i have been told by GoldEd's author, a simple
recompilation with latest includes should surfice.

The tab option featured in goldEd 5.0 has not been implemented, as this goes 
against Cobol's practice of, one charecter, one space.


To use just copy relavent file to GoldEd:syntax then evoke syntax highlights
via menu/extras/Option local

Enjoy!)
