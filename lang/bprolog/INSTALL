<< FOR UNIX MACHINES >>

1. Download the file "bp_unix.tar.Z" and store it in your home directory.

2. uncompress "bp_unix.tar.Z" and extract the files by typing
          "uncompress bp_unix.tar.Z | tar xfv -"
   If you downloaded "bp_unix.tar.gz", then type
	  "gunzip bp_unix.tar.gz | tar xfv -"

3. Change directory to "BProlog/Emulator" and type "make" to make 
   the executable object file "bprolog".  

4. To start B-Prolog, execute the shell file "bp" in the directory 
   "BProlog".

If the system is installed in a directory rather than "$HOME/BProlog", then 
you have to reset the environment variable "BPDIR" in the shell file "bp" to
the directory. It would be convinient to add the following line in the file
".cshrc": 
	path = ($path $HOME/BProlog)
In this way, you can start B-Prolog from everywhere.


<< FOR MSDOS MACHINES >>

1. Download the file "bp_msdos.exe" and store it in "C:\".

2. Type "bp_msdos" to extract the files.

3. To start B-Prolog, execute "bp" in the directory "C:\BPROLOG".
