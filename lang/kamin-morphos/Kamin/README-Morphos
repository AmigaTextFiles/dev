I have adapted these programs to Morphos using the Pascal sources and fpc.

To make them run fine I make some changes :
	- I split the "main" in two procedures : init and mainloop. 
	- I next add a new "main" calling these two procs.
	- I have remplaced all the "goto 99" by "mainloop"
	- i added () to the calls of procedures and fonctions having no parameters and 
	    concerned with recursivity (needed by fpc)

All interpreters runs the tests except:
	- lisp-msgc, lisp-ssgc and lisp-refcn. They go to end of test but print 
	  "Error: expected name, instead read: ;" endlessly 
	  	
    - smalltalk run the test if the two lines 
			372 (set f2 (sqrt f1 eps)) 
			373 (print f2)
	  are commented.
