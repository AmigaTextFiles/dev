This material was submitted to me on disk by one of the authors, Jim Locker,
for inclusion in the library.  Thanks Jim!

Because of it's size, it is included in the form of an lzh archive.  The
lharc program is included in the :c directory of this disk.  To unpack
the archive, activate a CLI and use a command of the form:

	lharc -x -a -m x diglib.lzh
