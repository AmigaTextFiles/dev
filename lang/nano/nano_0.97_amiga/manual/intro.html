    					Nano is a register based virtual machine. <br>
                        The goal is to create a easy to use and powerful VM. <br><br>

    					Why yet another VM? <br><br>

                        I wanted to create something new. It was a challenge for me. <br><br>
                        
                        Why registers and not a Java like stack? <br><br>
                        
                        The nano language is assembler. It's easier to do with registers ;). <br>
                        Nano is a pure interpreter, there's no JIT. It's a fact that register interpreters <br>
                        are faster than stack based ones. This is known as the "stack overhead". <br><br>
                          
                        Performance? <br><br>

                        On some programs it performs well: only factor 12 to native code. <br>
                        If arrays are used it will be slower (bounds checking). <br><br><br>
                          

                        The main features are: <br><br>
    					- types: short int, long int, double and string. <br>
   						- arrays <br>
    					- ANSI output functions: text styles, text locating, cursor moving... <br>
    					- file I/O <br>
    					- TCP/IP sockets <br>
    					- virtual memory support for machines without MMU <br>
    					- portable (100% C) <br>
