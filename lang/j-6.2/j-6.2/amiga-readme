BEWARE: I just compiled J to find out what APL/J is like.  Nothing else.
        Noone should make me responsible for anything concerning this
        program.

This archive includes everything I found in the original J-archive
j_6.2_src_pkg.tar.Z.  Of course it also includes Amiga executables.

Both executables were compiled with SAS/C V6.51 on my A3000
with Kick/WB 3.1.

j-881 is compiled with CPU=68020 and MATH=68881, so if you
  don't have a 68020/030/040 and a math-coprocessor or 68040,
  j-881 will probably crash.

j-ieee is compiled with CPU=68000 and MATH=IEEE, so this
  executable should run fine on all amigas.

I supplied the SMakefile to recompile J.  If you have SAS/C
(any other good C compiler should work fine) and a weird
CPU/FPU-combination, just let SAS/C do its job.

Have fun!
