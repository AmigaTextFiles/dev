1.    What's J?

     J is a functional shareware programming language  
     available via anonymous ftp at watserv1.waterloo.edu.

     Features include list-at-a-time processing, arrays of arrays,
     complex numbers, special features for multiplying polynomials,
     manipulating sets and generating permutations.  Although it
     provides support for numerical modeling, it is not a numerical
     modeling package.  It is a general purpose programming language.

     J was designed and developed by Ken Iverson and Roger Hui.
     It is similar to the language APL, departing from APL in using
     using the ASCII alphabet exclusively, but employing a spelling
     scheme that retains the advantages of the special alphabet 
     required by APL. It has added features and control structures 
     that extend its power beyond standard APL.  

     Although it can be used as a conventional procedural programming 
     language, it can also be used as a pure functional programming 
     language. 

     J is similar to the programming language A used at Morgan Stanley.
     A is not commerically available.

     J is portable and runs on : Acorn Archimedes, AT&T 3B1,
     Apple Macintosh family, Atari ST, DECstation (MIPS-based),
     DEC VAX (ULTRIX & BSD), Interactive 386/ix, IBM RISC/6000,
     IBM PC family, MIPS R3000, NeXT, Philips P9070, Silicon
     Graphics SGI Irix, Sun 3, Sun 386i, Sun 4 (SPARC), and HP95.

     It is possible to call C from J and J from C .

     If you are programming in an UNIX environment, you may wish to
     run J under j-interation-mode.el in Emacs. To get this package,
     ftp to "cmns.think.com" and get it at "gnu/dist-18.55/standard".
     If you prefer the feel of vi to Emacs, you can run vip-mode as 
     a minor mode. This will allow you to use vip's command mode to
     use commands such as z z. z- f F 0 ^ G H M etc. to move around
     the buffer and edit and re-execute commands, and to use vip's 
     insertion mode to execute instructions. Not everyone programming
     on a UNIX box takes this approach as some like running J as a 
     process under X.

     If you plan on programming on a NeXT you might experiment with the
     NeXT session manager for J at 129.187.236.233 in pub/next/ProgLang/j .

     On the PC, J's session manager is a single edit window. It has a 
     standard menu and supports different fonts. You can run multiple 
     copies of J simultaneously.

     The window driver supports all standard window classes (button, edit 
     box, listbox, combobox, scrollbar, etc.).  It also supports a graphics
     class in which all GDI drawing commands are supported, a picture class 
     which can display WWF, BMP, and ICO graphic images, and an ole class 
     which can display OLE objects that are connected to servers such as 
     Msgraph and Paintbrush.  Ownerdraw buttons and listboxes are also 
     supported.  J can act as OLE clients and as DDE clients and servers. 
     J in there are no 64K limits. It also has online help.
    
2.   Where can I get it?

     For an executable version cd to "languages/apl/j/exec/*"

     To look at or compile the source cd to "languages/apl/j/source"

     Sometimes the source has a more recent version. 

     To compile set the variable SYS in js.h for your system.
     Set SYS_DOUBLE to one unless when you enter a numeric vector you
     get a core dump. If this occurs set it to zero and remake.
     A shar file which allows you examine the performance of J on
     your machine is available from rockwell@socrates.umd.edu .

     Alternatively, J, as well as a considerable amount of other J
     info is downloadable from BBS\APL, 703-528-7617, 1200-14400b,
     N-8-1, v.32bis, 24hours.  For further information contact
     Dick Holt at dick.holt@acm.org

5.   Is there an instruction set I can peruse?

     Here is a list. If you would like a pretty printed reference card
     of instructions (beautifully implemented in latex by Christopher
     Browne) ftp to "watserv1.waterloo.edu" and cd into "languages/apl/j/help
     /reference.card"
   
     For example, to create the instruction "From" enter "{", to create 
     "Head" enter "{." , and to create "Tail" enter "{:" .

6.   What packages are available?

     A graphics package is available for plotting under XWindows.
     E-mail  sam@kalessin.Jpl.Nasa.Gov for details.

     J has been successfully embedded into Gambit Scheme  by 
     Dennis Neal Holmes (now at IBM) and Dr. John Howland at
     Trinity University.  The resulting language is called
     APROL for Array Processing Lisp. This language is currently
     available on the MAC. E-mail jhowland@ariel.cs.trinity
     for details.

     A set of programs for the implementation of keyed files
     written my Mike Powell is available.  These routines
     work nicely under UNIX and are being ported to the
     PC and MAC. These routines can be found at watserv1
     in languages/apl/j/workspaces.

     Several projects are either in the wishful thinking stage
     or are currently in progress. They are :

     1. Erik Iverson is working on a debugger for J which will allow
        users to step thru their explicit definition programs, set
        statement lables for halting execution and examine variables.
        Error messages are being enhanced also.  A demo version
        is expected to be available at APL 93 and ISI is hoping to
        release a version to the public in october.

     2. An LAPACK interface, by Emmett McLean and David Gurr. 
        Real and Complex versions of the following :

        SVD factorization         (completed)
        QR  factorization         (completed)
        (P)LU factorization       (completed)
        Hessenberg factorization  (completed)
        Matrix Norms              (in progress)
        Condition numbers         (in progress)
        QL                        (not yet started)
        Schur                     (completed)

        
     3. A J-FFTPACK interface, by Emmett McLean (completed).

     4. Tree data structures, by David Steinbrook. This will be
        available at APL93.

     4. J to C translator (currently at the design stage only)
        Robert Bernecky, rbe@yrloc.ipsa.reuter.com
  
7. News

    At APL93 in Toronto, this August the following presentations will
    discuss J applications:
   ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    Identification of Parallelism in
    Neural Networks by Simulations in the Language J
    
    Alexei N. Skurihin and Alvin J. Surkan.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    JVOX
    David G. Smith and Joey Tuttle.
    
    It is easy to learn J; just talk to your computer.  Voice recognition
    technology is already on the desktop.  You can use voice input to
    bypass some common obstacles and promote gratifying and enjoyable
    experimentation with the language.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    From Trees into Boxes

    Eugene McDonnell and David Steinbrook.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    APROCL : A Hybrid Lanuage

    Dennis Holmes and John E. Howland.

    Keith Smillie
   ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    As an aside, ISI is expecting to have several booths at APL93.
   
    They will be introducing French and Japanese versions of the
    Introduction and Dictionary, and will be available to answer
    questions.
