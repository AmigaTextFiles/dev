The programming language J first appeared in 1990.
It has been designed and developed by Kenneth E
Iverson (the inventor of APL) and Roger Hui.
Some distinctive features of this language, are

        - ASCII character set
        - complex numbers
        - boxed arrays
        - function assignment
        - phrasal forms hook and fork
        - new operators.

This talk will sample some of each of these features.
One solution to an archaeologist's problem will be
given, with particular attention given to programming
in a functional style.
