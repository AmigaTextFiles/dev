The files in the directories "be.dir" and "ar.dir" were used as
"foils" in a presentation made to the Design Theory seminar 
in the Department of Mathematics of Royal Holloway, University of 
London in November, 1992.  To start the foils in the presentation,
move to this directory, and start J.  If you are already familiar
with the program "tutorial", given in the file "tutorial.js"
the program "b" follows the same conventions.  Otherwise, just
follow the instructions.  Type 
   b 0
to get started.  After passing through the "beginner" section,
you can start the foils for the "archaeologist" section by
typing
   a 0
.
Some of the files are "PC" files, in which every line
ends with a CR,LF.  However to get the program to run
on a Unix system (which uses only LF at the end of each
line), the CRs have been removed from the files "*.js".

Also included here for private study are the frames of the
"tutorial", supplied by ISI and the text of the article
"What is J? An introduction".
