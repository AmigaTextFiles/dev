Sylvester (1877)

	"It is the constant aim of the
mathematician to reduce all his expressions to their
lowest terms, to retrench every superfluous word
and phrase, and condense the Maximum of
meaning into the Minimum of language."

	Johns Hopkins University, 22 Frbruary 1877"

	Collected Mathematical Papers

Whitehead (1911)
	"By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work,
a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems,
and in effect increases the mental power of the race.
...By the aid of symbolism we can make transitions
in reasoning almost mechanically by the eye, which
would otherwise call into play the higher faculties
of the brain.  It is a profoundly erroneous truism,
repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people
when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate
the habit of thinking of what we are doing.
The precise opposite is the case.  Civilization advances
by extending the number of important
operations which we can perform without thinking about them."
