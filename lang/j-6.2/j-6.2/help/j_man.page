J \- the J programming language

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The language \fIJ\fP is an interactive, functional language that
has complex numbers, boxed arrays, rank operator, function assignment,
hooks, forks, and user defined operators.
Its nearest linguistic relative is Sharp APL for Unix (SAX),
but differs mainly from SAX in that \fIJ\fP uses the ascii character set
and implements hooks and forks.

This version represents work in progress, but is quite usable.
It is being developed by Kenneth E. Iverson, the inventor of APL,
and Roger Hui who is doing the programming.

.SH STANDARD INPUT, OUTPUT
\fIJ\fP supports standard input and output.
For example, the command line
.sp
.ti 1i
echo 'i. 3 4 5' | j > output
.sp
causes the file 'output' to be created, the line '   i. 3 4 5'
added to it, along with the lines of output generated by that command.

.SH SCRIPT INPUT, OUTPUT
\fIJ\fP also supports script input and output.
For example, the \fIJ\fP session:
.nf
.sp
.in 1i
J
.in 1.3i
scr =. 0!:2 & < 
'output' scr ''
i. 3 4 5
script ''
CTRL D
.fi
.sp
.PP
causes a similar file to be created, but with both keyboard input and 
screen output.
In a script output file, the output lines are preceded by an ascii zero.
Such lines are ignored upon re-interpretation.
For example, in the sequence
.nf
.sp
.in 1i
J
.in 1.3i
scr =. 0!:2 & < 
'f1' scr ''

i. 3 4 5
'f2' scr 'f1' 
CTRL D
.fi
.sp
.PP
the second script command
causes some of the lines of the file "f1" to be executed 
but not those which were the result of execution from the first script,
and not those containing "system commands".

.SH TUTORIALS
.fi
There are forty seven tutorial files,
named tut0 to tut46,
in the directory
.sp
.ti 1i
/software/j/doc/tutor
.sp
that provide many examples.
Each file is about 25 or so lines in length.
Even though each file is short, the information content in some is high.
These files may be viewed with your favorite text editor, or the
\fIJ\fP
functions in ``tutorial.js'' may be used to to control browsing.

This tutorial script may be run by starting
\fIJ\fP
and doing these two commands:
.sp
.nf
.in 1.3i
0!:2 & < '/software/j/doc/tutorial.js'
tutorial ''
.sp
.LP
There is also a "readme" file in the directory "/software/j/doc".

.SH STATUS
The file
.nf
.sp
.ti 1i
/software/j/doc/status
.sp
gives details about just what has been implemented and what has not.
.SH REFERENCES
.PP
Several references exist.
There is a file called languages/apl/j/references kept on the file server
watserv1.uwaterloo.ca that contains the most up to date list we have.
Short of that, four foundation papers that may be of interest are:

.SH NEWSGROUP
.PP
The UseNet newsgroup ``comp.lang.apl'' has been active lately with
questions and answers about
\fIJ\fP.
Members from ISI, (Iverson Software Inc.), sometimes read and respond
to questions in this newsgroup.
