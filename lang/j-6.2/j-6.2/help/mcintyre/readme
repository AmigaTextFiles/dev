The files in this set are those used at the J Workshop
given by Donald McIntyre in Toronto on 1992-10-28.
They are largely unedited.  Most of the files are from
a PC and have CR,LF at the end of each line.  Some of the
files, with names of the form TUTxx.IN, are from some other
sytem, with a different end of line convention.    The J
code in the file "lf.js" illustrates how to build one function
to convert all of thes files to the PC convention.  This involves
building and array with entries like TUTxx.IN and another array
with entries like TUTxx.OUT.  Four of the files, with names like
xxxxx.RPT, are from some word processor, and contain long lines.
