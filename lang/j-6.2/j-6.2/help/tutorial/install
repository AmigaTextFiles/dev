		Installation and Start-Up Procedure
		for J  on Unix (TM) systems

0.  This distribution consists of two compressed tape archive files:

     tutorials.tar.Z		Tutorials.
     j_6.2_XXX_.tar.Z		The executable.

1.  These installation steps are suggested:

     mkdir ~/j			Create a new directory called "j".
     mv *.tar.Z ~/j		Move the '.tar' files to the new directory.
     cd ~/j			Change to the new directory.
     uncompress *.tar.Z		Expand the compressed '.tar' files.
     tar xof j_*.tar		Extract the executable from the tape archive.
     tar xof tut*.tar		Extract the tutorials files.
     rm *.tar			Remove the '.tar' files.  Alternatively,
				move them to some safe place.
     mv j_* j			Rename the executable.

2.  If yours is a one user system, these steps are suggested:

     alias j "~/j/j"		Set an alias for j.  You probably want
				this line in your ".cshrc" or ".aliases" file.
     j				To start the program.  (Use CTRL D to end.)

With this setup, J will be available to you from any directory.
The J tutorial will be available to you whenever you make "~/j"
your current directory.

3.  When you start J, you should soon see the message

   J Version 6.2  Copyright (c) 1990-1992, Iverson Software Inc.

   and a 3-space prompt.  At this point, the system is ready to
   interpret J sentences.  To terminate the session, enter  ^D  (Control D) .

4.  A tutorial is available.  Within a J session, enter:

     0!:3 < 'tutorial.js'	Make the necessary definitions
     tutorial ''		Start the tutorial

5.  For shared use on a multi-user system, an appropriate installation
is needed.  The directory used for the binary file  "j"  will depend
on the conventions in use at your installation.  Some system
administrators may like  J  itself to be installed as "/bin/j".
The  J  tutorial files may be installed in a different directory,
such as  "/software/j/doc".  If this directory path is used, the
files needed by the tutorial would be named:

	/software/j/doc/tutorial.js
	/software/j/doc/tut/tut*.js	(47 of these, numbered 0 to 46)

In such a setting, for the file  "tutorial.js"  to run correctly, it must
be modified.  In this file, the line

	frames=.<&read ('tut/tut'&,)&(,&'.js')&":&.>i.47

may be replaced by

	Path =. '/software/j/doc/tut'
	frames=.<&read ((Path,'/tut')&,)&(,&'.js')&":&.>i.47

Then users may be instructed to do these steps,

	% cp /software/j/doc/tut/tutorial.js .
	% j

	      0:!3 < 'tutorial.js'
	      tutorial ''

Or users may be instructed to do these steps:

	% j

		0:!3 '/software/j/doc/tutorial.js'
		tutorial ''

6.  Some first time users have found it useful to print the 47
tutorial files (about 20 to 30 lines each) and have them at hand
while experimenting with the system.
