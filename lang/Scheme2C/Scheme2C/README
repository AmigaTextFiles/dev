This is the root directory for the Scheme-to-C compiler which was done at
Digital Equipment Corporation's Western Research Laboratory.  The compiler
distribution consists of several directories:

	doc	contains documentation:

		index.mss	a Scribe reference document for the language
				which is in the form of an annoted index to
				the Revised**3 Scheme standard.

		index.psf	Postscript for index.mss.

		intro.mss	a Scribe document introducing Scheme->C.

		intro.psf	Postscript for intro.mss.

		scc.l		UNIX man page for the Scheme->C compiler.

		sci.l		UNIX man page for the Scheme->C interpreter.

	gnuemacs	contains emacs lisp code	

	scrt	contains the runtime system.

	scsc	contains the compiler.

	test	contains compiler and runtime test programs.

	cdecl	a C declaration compiler written in Scheme.

	xlib	X11 Xlib stubs for Scheme->C.

In order to install the compiler and interpreter on a system, the following
steps must be done.

1.  Verify that this directory contains the previously mentioned directories.

2.  Edit the makefile in this directory so that the directory definitions
    at the head of the file are correct for your installation:

	SRCDIR	full name of this directory

	MIPSDIR	full name of the directory that should be used to build
		Scheme->C for a DECstation 3100.

	VAXDIR	full name of the directory that should be used to build
		Scheme->C for a VAX.

    The other definitions need not be changed.

2.  Create directories for a specific processor.  For a VAX this is done
    by:

	1 >make forVAX

    and for a DECstation 3100, this is done by:

	1 >make forMIPS

3.  Build Scheme->C for a specific processor.  For a VAX this is done
    by:

	2 >cd VAXDIR 	(defined in step 2)
	3 >make port

    and for a DECstation 3100, this is done by:

	2 >cd MIPSDIR	(defined in step 2)
	3 >make port

    N.B.  During the compilation of scrt/signal.c on DECstations, you may get
    the warning: "cpp: warning /usr/include/mips/cpu.h:504: CONS redefined".
    This warning can be ignored.

4.  Verify that the interpreter and compiler were correctly built:

	4 >cd test
	5 >../scrt/sci
	SCHEME->C -- ...
	> (load "test51.sc")
	MODULE form ignored
	TEST51
	"test51.sc"
	>  (test51 '())
	Hello world!
	#F
	> ^D
	6 >make test51
	../scsc/sccomp -schf ../scsc/sccomp.heap -C test51.sc
	test51.sc:
	../scsc/sccomp -schf ../scsc/sccomp.heap -c -g test51.c
	cc -o test51 -g test51.o ../scrt/libsc.a -lm
	7 >test51
	Hello world!

5.  Install the libraries, compiler, and interpreter in some directory
    such as ~/bin:

	8 >cd ..
	9 >make "destdir = /udir/`whoami`/bin" install-private
	10 >rehash

    Given that this directory in the current search path, the compiler can
    now be accessed by "scc" and the interpreter by "sci".  

    N.B. Users of DECstations will see two or three sequences of error messages
    ending with "*** Error code 1 (ignored)."  These errors may be ignored.

6.  At this point, the source in cdecl and xlib can now be compiled as
    desired.
