This message announces the availability of Scheme Library release slib2c5.

New in slib2c5:

The file "slib.info" is now included in the SLIB distribution.
Moreover, changes from slib2c4.info are marked with `change bars' in
the right margin.  Similarly, text changes in the online manual
(http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/slib_toc.html) versus slib2c4 are
highlighted in red.  These change markups were performed by Scheme
programs; see http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/infobar/index.html
for information and download.

	* mitscheme.init (char-code-limit): Added.  Builtin
	char-code-limit is 65536 (NOT!) in MITScheme Version 8.0.
	* batch.scm (batch:apply-chop-to-fit): fixed off-by-1 error.
	* randinex.scm: moved (schmooz) documentation here from scm.texi.
	(random:uniform1): Renamed from random:uniform.
	(random:uniform): Added (takes optional state argument).
	(random:normal): Made reentrant.
	* random.scm: moved (schmooz) documentation here from scm.texi.
	* random.scm (seed->random-state): added.
	* mitscheme.init (object->limited-string): Added.
	* random.scm (random:random): Fixed embarrassingly stupid bug.
	* alistab.scm (supported-key-type?): number now allowed.
	* schmooz.scm (schmooz): Converted from replace-suffix to
	filename:substitute??.
	* yasyn.scm: Restored to SLIB.  yasos.scm removed.
	* object.scm: Restored to SLIB
	* recobj.scm: Restored to SLIB
	* slib.texi (Copyrights): Added HTML anchor for Copying information.
	(Installation): Added HTML anchor for Installation instructions.
	* fluidlet.scm (fluid-let): Rewritten as defmacro.
	* htmlform.scm (table->html): Table conversion functions added.
	* nclients.scm (glob-pattern?): Added.
	* htmlform.scm (html:href-heading): simplified.
	* htmlform.scm (html:comment): No longer puts `>' alone on line.
	(make-plain make-atval): renamed from html:plain and html:atval;
	html: functions now all output HTML.
	* nclients.scm (user-email-address): Ported to W95 and WNT.
	(make-directory): added.
	* dbrowse.scm (browse:display-table): Column-foreigns restored.
	* htmlform.scm (html:atval html:plain): Now accept numbers.
	(html:pre): Added.
	(html:start-page html:end-page): Updated to HTML 3.2.  HTML header
	added.
	* rdms.scm (make-relational-system): column-foreign-list split
	into column-foreign-check-list and column-foreign-list.
	* lineio.scm (display-file): added.  Schmoozed docs.
	* nclients.scm: Added net-clients.
	* require.scm (vicinity:suffix?): Abstracted from
	program-vicinity.
	* comlist.scm (remove-duplicates): added.

	* printf.scm (stdio:round-string): Makes sure result has at least
	STRIP-0S characters after the implied decimal point if STRIP-0S is
	not false.  Fixes bug associated with engineering notation in SCM.
	* glob.scm (glob:make-substituter): Made to handle cases where
	PATTERN and TEMPLATE have different numbers of literal sections.
	* glob.scm (glob:pattern->tokens): (glob:make-matcher):
	(glob:make-substituter): Fixed to accept null strings as literals
	to match, for REPLACE-SUFFIX.  There is no way to write a glob
	pattern that produces such a token, should there be?
	* glob.scm (glob:substitute??) renamed from glob:transform??
	(filename:substitute??) identical to glob:substitute??
	* glob.scm (glob:pattern->tokens): Separated from
	GLOB:MAKE-MATCHER.
	(glob:make-transformer):
	(glob:transform??):
	(glob:transform-ci??): Added.
	(replace-suffix): Rewritten using GLOB:TRANSFORM??
	* fluidlet.scm (fluid-let): Changed macro definition so that it
	doesn't depend on being able to combine input from two different
	ellipsis patterns.  Now produces a nice expansion with
	macro-by-example so that one can see exactly what goes wrong.
	* schmooz.scm (schmooz-top): No longer emits @defun lines for
	definitions not separated by blank lines unless they have
	associated @body comment lines.
	* fluidlet.scm (fluid-let): Redone to restore variable values even
	if a continuation captured in the body is invoked.  Now agrees
	with MIT Scheme documentation.

SLIB is a portable scheme library meant to provide compatibiliy and
utility functions for all standard scheme implementations.

SLIB includes initialization files for Chez, ELK 2.1, GAMBIT,
MacScheme, MITScheme, scheme->C, Scheme48, SCM, scsh, T3.1, and VSCM.

Documentation includes a manifest, installation instructions, and
coding standards for the library.  Documentation of each library
package is supplied.  SLIB Documentation is online at:

	    http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB.html

SLIB is a portable Scheme library which SCM uses:
 swissnet.ai.mit.edu:pub/scm/slib2c5.tar.gz
 ftp.gnu.org:pub/gnu/jacal/slib2c5.tar.gz
 ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/scheme-repository/code/lib/slib2c5.tar.gz

SLIB-PSD is a portable debugger for Scheme (requires emacs editor):
 swissnet.ai.mit.edu:pub/scm/slib-psd1-3.tar.gz
 ftp.gnu.org:pub/gnu/jacal/slib-psd1-3.tar.gz
 ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/scheme-repository/utl/slib-psd1-3.tar.gz

SCHELOG is an embedding of Prolog in Scheme+SLIB:
 http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/schelog/

Programs for printing and viewing TexInfo documentation (which SLIB
has) come with GNU Emacs or can be obtained via ftp from:
ftp.gnu.org:pub/gnu/texinfo-3.1.tar.gz

Files in these directories are compressed with patent-free gzip (no
relation to zip).  The program to uncompress them is available from
 ftp.gnu.org:pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.tar
 ftp.gnu.org:pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.shar
 ftp.gnu.org:pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.msdos.exe

  ftp swissnet.ai.mit.edu (anonymous)
  bin
  cd pub/scm
  get slib2c5.tar.gz
or
  ftp ftp.gnu.org (anonymous)
  cd pub/gnu/jacal
  bin
  get slib2c5.tar.gz

  `slib2c5.tar.gz' is a compressed tar file of a Scheme Library.

Remember to use binary mode when transferring the *.tar.gz files.
