# DESCRIPTION:
# This file describes capabilities of various terminals, as needed by
# software such as screen editors.  It does not attempt to describe
# printing terminals very well, nor graphics terminals.  Someday.
# See termcap(5) in the Unix Programmers Manual for documentation.
#
# Conventions: First entry is two chars, first char is manufacturer,
# second char is canonical name for model or mode.
# Third entry is the one the editor will print with "set" command.
# Last entry is verbose description.
# Others are mnemonic synonyms for the terminal.
#
# Terminal naming conventions:
# Terminal names look like <manufacturer> <model> - <modes/options>
# Certain abbreviations (e.g. c100 for concept100) are also allowed
# for upward compatibility.  The part to the left of the dash, if a
# dash is present, describes the particular hardware of the terminal.
# The part to the right can be used for flags indicating special ROM's,
# extra memory, particular terminal modes, or user preferences.
# All names are always in lower case, for consistency in typing.
#
# The following are conventionally used flags:
#	rv	Terminal in reverse video mode (black on white)
#	2p	Has two pages of memory.  Likewise 4p, 8p, etc.
#	w	Wide - in 132 column mode.
#	pp	Has a printer port which is used.
#	na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#
# There are some cases where the same name is used for two different
# terminals, e.g. "teleray" or "2621" or "vt100".  In these cases,
# if a site has one of these, they should choose a local default and
# bring that terminal to the front in the reorder script.  This works
# because tgetent picks the first match in /etc/termcap.
# The list of names intentionally duplicated is:
# 2621, c108, dtc, hp2621, teleray, tvi, vt100.
#
# To easily test a new terminal description, put it in $HOME/.termcap
# and programs will look there before looking in /etc/termcap.
# You can also setenv TERMPATH to a list of full pathnames (separated
# by spaces or colons) to be searched by tgetent() in the order listed.
# The TERMCAP environment variable is usually set to the termcap
# entry itself to avoid reading files when starting up a program.
#
# If you absolutely MUST check for a specific terminal (this is discouraged)
# check for the 2nd entry (the canonical form) since all other codes are
# subject to change.  The two letter codes are there for version 6 and are
# EXTREMELY subject to change, or even to go away if version 6 becomes for
# all practical purposes obsolete.  We would much rather put in special
# capabilities to describe your terminal rather than having you key on the
# name.
#
#  Special manufacturer codes:
#	A: hardcopy daisy wheel terminals
#	M: Misc. (with only a few terminals)
#	q: Homemade
#	s: special (dialup, etc.)
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a termcap entry.  Individual entries are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
#  This file is to be installed with an editor script (reorder)
#  that moves the most common terminals to the front of the file.
#  If the source is not available, it can be constructed by sorting
#  the above entries by the 2 char initial code.
# # --------------------------------
#
# A: DAISY WHEEL PRINTERS
#
# The A manufacturer represents Diablo, DTC, Xerox, Qume, and other Daisy
# wheel terminals until such time as termcap distinguishes between them
# enough to justify separate codes.
# This is an "experimental" entry for the SRI Agiles.
# It has been tried in a minimal way -- the Agile did not blow up!
# However, it has not been exhaustively tested.
# Anyone who tries it and finds it wanting should get in touch with:
#	Ralph Keirstead (ralph@sri-unix);
#	EK352; SRI International; 333 Ravenswood Avenue; Menlo Park, CA 94025
# Amiga termcap by Kent Polk, kent@swrinde.nde.swri.edu (30 May 90)
# Added a few more entries, converted caret-type control sequence (^x) entries
# to '\0xx' entries since a couple of people mentioned loosing '^x' sequences.
#
# :as, :ae			Support for alternate character sets.
# :ve=\E[\040p:vi=\E[\060\040p	cursor visible/invisible.
# :xn:  vt100 kludginess at column 80/NEWLINE ignore after 80 cols(Concept)
#     This one appears to fix a problem I always had with a line ending
#     at 'width+1' (I think) followed by a blank line in vi. The blank
#     line tended to disappear and reappear depending on how the screen
#     was refreshed. Note that this is probably needed only if you use
#     something like a Dnet Fterm with the window sized to some peculiar
#     dimension larger than 80 columns.
# :k0=\E9~	map F10 to k0 - could have F0-9 -> k0-9, but ... F10 was 'k;'
# :F1-FA			removed F11 through F20.
