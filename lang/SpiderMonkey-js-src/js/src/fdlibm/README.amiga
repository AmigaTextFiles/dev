Hello,

My smakefile does not create a library.  Why?  Because I am dumb and enjoy
doing things the hard way.  In order to create fdlibm.lib, one must manually 
run SAS/C's object module librarian.  I have a text file named "objs" which 
makes this easier:

> delete fdlibm.lib
> oml fdlibm.lib r @objs
