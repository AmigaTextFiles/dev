The two files in this archive represent a scanner and parser for ISO Level 0
Pascal, plus some simple extensions. They are in the public domain. Anyone
can do whatever he wants to with them.

They successfully pass the 4.2 BSD Yacc and Lex. Other than that, no promises
are made, and no warranties tendered. You use this code at your own risk,
and all that other stuff.

Enjoy,
