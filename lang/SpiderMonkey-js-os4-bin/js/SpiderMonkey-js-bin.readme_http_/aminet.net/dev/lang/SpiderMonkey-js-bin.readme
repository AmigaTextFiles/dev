Short:        Mozilla JavaScript interpreter for CLI
Author:       mozilla.org (The Mozilla Foundation)
Uploader:     tim metaphorse com (Tim Johnson)
Type:         dev/lang
Version:      1.5-1
Architecture: ppc-amigaos >= 4.0.0
Distribution: Aminet


This is my port of Mozilla's open-source "SpiderMonkey" JavaScript
interpreter.  In the archive is an executable called "js" which can
be run interactively or as a command to execute JavaScript files.
Also included is the general README.html from the original SpiderMonkey
distribution.

SpiderMonkey is generally intended to be used as a shared library and
embedded in other applications, but it comes with a command-line 
interpreter for testing and learning.  That is what is included here.

Example (interactive):
    6.Fad:Dev/js/src> js
    js> myDate = new Date();
    Wed Nov 22 2006 11:55:31 GMT+0000
    js> myDate.toLocaleString();
    Wed Nov 22 11:55:31 2006
    js> quit()

Example (command):
    6.Fad:Dev/js/src> js myfile.js
	 (or, to include some startup code before running myfile:)
    6.Fad:Dev/js/src> js -f shell.js myfile.js

It would be entirely possible to create a javascript.library using the
SpiderMonkey source code, offering a JavaScript interpreter to any 
Amiga application.  I am not enough of a guru to do this yet. :)  If
a knowledgable someone would like to work on this, please contact me.
The source code should be on Aminet to accompany this binary.

"Features" of this Amiga version (17 Dec 2006):
    - currently no file support
    - currently no support for passing arguments using Workbench
          (recommended to run from CLI)
    - compiled for 68020+FPU using SAS/C 6.58
          (non-FPU binary might be possible)
    - compiled for PPC Amiga OS4 using SDK v51.22
    - requires a stack size >= 50000, but I have not inserted the code
          to enforce this and have not turned off SAS/C's stack checking
          (but have not enabled automatic stack growth, either)
    - passes all the same ECMA JavaScript tests on Amiga as it does
          on other platforms, with a few very minor exceptions
          (MAX_FLOAT is a tiny bit smaller, and a call to Date()
              might not have the same second as the next call to
              Date(), but this makes sense and is no problem)
    - tested on A4000T/060-50/64mb/OS 3.5 and A1200/030/8mb/OS 3.0
    - tested on A1XE/G4-800/512mb/OS4upd4

Notes (17 Dec 2006):
    - the 68k part did not evolve since the 22 Nov 2006.

Notes (22 Nov 2006):
    - to quit, enter "quit()" and press return
    - build instructions for my dumb build system are in the
          readme included with the source code package, in case
          you want to compile this yourself
