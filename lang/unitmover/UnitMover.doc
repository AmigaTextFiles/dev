1) Introduction

   Any one who used their product know what a pain it was to add
 something to Pascal.Lib, not to mantion of removing units. I found it
 unbeareble to use it, so it is where UnitMover comes in. This program
 was made as a repleacement of LibMaker from HiSoft. It is fully GUI
 driven program to menage Pascal.Lib and units. With this little piece
 of software you can build new library, add units to it remove them (kill),
 save them to disk. This progam also check for integrity of library.

   Unfortunatly this program is not perfect, be this I mean it can only
 work with 2.0+ system. So at least LibMaker has one advantage. If you are
 still pre 2.0 system user do not loos hope (see Future).

2) Disclaimer

   However UnitMover is (C) 1994 Jerzy Kasenberg, author take no responsi-
 bility for any domage caused by this program or using it. If You are using
 it, You are doing it on your own risk. If for some reason (which I doubt)
 this program destroy your data You are on Your own, I will no be able to
 help You.
 (I used it for while and it NEVER let me down, so let's hope it can be
 useful for You).

3) Distribution

   This program is FREEWARE, You do not have to pay for it. It can be
 placed in any PD/Shareware package without written permision from author.
 But notification about it would be appreciated. Especially this program
 may be placed in any CDRom shareware package. Also I give permision to
 HiSoft to distribute this with their HSpascal if they would like to.

4) Requirements

  As mantion above, program requires WB2.0 to run. Especially asl.library
 should be in Your LIBS: directory.
 Also You will require enough memory to hold all Pascal.lib in ram.

5) Instalation

  Just put UnitMover icon anywhere, You may chose directory which contains
 Pascal.lib or units.

6) Using

  Program is very easy to use. All menu options have shortcuts, also gadgets
 in the middle of the window can be 'pushed' with keyboard (without any
 control keys like LALT CTRL). If some letter is underlined just push cores-
 ponding letter on keyboard.

 Almost all menu functions are doubled be gadgets, so only menu will be
 described.

 "Library"

   "Clear"     - removes all units from current library in memory

   "Open"      - all You to select from disk library You want.
                 (gadget 'Load library')

   "Save      - Save library to disk (if no name was previously used
                 it uses requester to get library name)

   "save As"   - like above but always ask for library name
                 (gadget 'Save Library')

   "Test Library" - check integrity of the library. Informs you whether
                 all units in library are compatibile and whehter there
                 are missing units
                 (gadget 'Test library')

   "About"     - version and rights note

   "Quit"      - exit program, without asking for confirmation.
                 (ESC key do the same)

 "Units

   "add Unit"  - allow You to select one ar more units which You want to
                 add to library. If unit(s) already are in library they
                 can be repleaced or not, whatever you like.
                 (gadget Add unit)

   "Remove unit" - removes selected unit from library. To select unit which
                 is to be removed, simply select its name in list of units,
                 and then select Remove unit from menu.
                 (gadget Remove unit)

   "Extract unit" - selected unit can be saved as single-unit file (such
                 as createdy by compiler.
                 (gadget Extract unit)

   "Info unit" - when some unit is selected in list You can get some
                 information of its contents. This inforamtion includes:
                 All    - size of unit in bytes
                 Code   - size of code in unit
                 Data   - size of data (when You place in your program
                                        line Uses UnitName at least this
                                        date will be added to Your program
                 BSS    - size of BSS section

                 also program list units used be this unit (excluding
                 System and System2) and which units in library uses this
                 unit.
                 (gadget Info unit)


   In box at left top region of window name of library is shown (without
   path), exect (disk) size of library, and number of units in library.

   This program don't use any temporary files when library is saved, so
   be aware of posibility of losing your library when power is off during
   this operation.

7) Future

   _IF_ _SOON_ I get number of request to do this program for pre 2.0
 system I will do it. But it can happend only if interested people let
 me know about it. IF YOU people out there realy want to have 1.3 version
 working, hurry up. Since this version uses GadTools and Asl, You may sugest
 some repleacement for GadTools you want to have in new version (IntuiSuport
 or somthing). If YOU are hapy 2.0 2.1 3.? 4.? ?.? version user DO NOT
 send messages that 1.3 is obsolete, I know it, but some guys can aford, to
 upgrade.

 Any way for all who want to get better version of UnitMover send me:
 1) bug reports ( what bugs ????)
 2) improvment sugestion
 3) many if you do not know what to do with it
 4) Your programs (no viruses)
