NOTES FOR THE AMIGA RELEASE 09

This is the second Amiga public release of Berkeley Logo 4.01.  I have
fixed some bugs and added some extra primitives (as below).  There may
be a few bugs left, but I should think nothing too serious by this time.

I have compiled two versions for 68020 or higher processors, one for
systems with FPU and one for systems without it.  If you want to compile
binaries for other processors, you are certainly free to do so.

The following primitives are available on this Amiga version.  You may
find them handy, but take note that these currently exist ONLY on Amiga,
so your programs using these will not run under Berkeley Logo on other
platforms.


Amiga specific primitives...

AM.VERSION
   Outputs a list containing the version information in standard Amiga OS
   format.

AM.PREFS
   Calls up a screen mode requester.  This allows you to select the screen
   mode you want for Logo on your system, and it allows the selection of
   some special screen modes such as CyberGraphX.  Your choice is saved to
   the prefs file and loaded automatically when you start Logo in the
   future.


Pixel orientation primitives...

MM.SCREENSIZE
   Outputs a list containing the pixel width and height of the graphics
   window.

MM.PIXEL [x_turtle y_turtle]
   Accepts a list containing a pair of turtle coordinates, outputs a
   list containing a pair of pixel coordinates.

MM.TURTLE [ x_pixel y_pixel ]
   Accpets a list containing a pair of pixel coordinates, outputs a
   list containing a pair of turtle coordinates.


Simple GUI primitives...

MM.ALERT message_text exit_buttons
   Opens an alert box (or dialog box, or requester, depending on your OS
   philosphy) and allows the user to select from the exit buttons.  It
   will output the number of the button chosen.  The inputs are...

   message_text = The body of the text presented to the user.  Multiple
   lines may be presented as sub-lists.

   exit_buttons = Text of one to three exit buttons.  The multiple
   buttons are presented as sub-lists.

   Example...
      make "choice mm.alert [[This is a test][of the alert box.]] ~
      [[Okay][Cancel]]

MM.GETLIST message_text exit_buttons
(MM.GETLIST message_text exit_buttons default_text)
   Opens an alert box and requests a list from the user.  If default
   text is provided, it is visible in the string gadget when it appears.
   Output is a list...  First element, the number of the exit button the
   user chose.  Second element, a list representing the text the user
   entered.

MM.GETINT message_text exit_buttons
(MM.GETINT message_text exit_buttons default min max)
   Opens an alert box and requests an integer from the user, within the
   range from min to max.  Outputs a list: first item, number of the
   exit button the user chose; second item, the number he entered.

MM.FILEREQUEST filename
(MM.FILEREQUEST filename title)
   Presents a system filerequester to the user.  The input "filename" is
   the original filename (full path and name) visible to the user in the
   requester.  Output is a word representing the new filename entered, or
   [] if the user cancelled.

MM.WAITCLICK
   Waits for a mouse click in the graphics window and outputs a
   coordinate pair indicating the pixel position where the event
   occurred.  The output form is [x y].

MM.WAITKEY
   Waits for a keypress in the graphics window and outputs an ASCII
   value of the key entered.
