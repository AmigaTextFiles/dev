'winter' is a simple window hack that I cooked up quite a while ago.
It will automatically stop when it is done. You can do things to make
it exit quicker, but it would be cheating for me to tell you (and so
would looking in the source).

It seems pretty stable, and doesn't do anything harmfull to your running
system. The only problem is if you start a lot (say half a dozen) of
them running at once. This seems to run into an Intuition deadlock.
