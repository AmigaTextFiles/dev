'winter' is a little window hack I did way back. It seems pretty stable
and doesn't mess up your system. It can be made to go away, but it would
be cheating to look at the source to find out. The only problem I know
of with it is that if you run too many of them at once, it can lock the
system up. I suspect a deadlock problem with Intuition. It can be run
from CLI or WorkBench.
