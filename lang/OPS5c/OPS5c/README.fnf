This material was submitted to me on disk directly by one of the authors,
Bernie J. Lofaso Jr., for inclusion in the library.  Thanks Bernie!

The only change I have made is to repackage the original zoo archive
as an lharc archive, so everything would fit on this disk.  To extract
the contents of the archive, execute a command of the form:

	AmigaLibDisk358:c/lharc -x -a -m x OPS5c.lzh
