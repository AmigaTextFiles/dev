  Here's some OpalVision support for you HighSpeed Pascal users.  I whip-
 ped up a unit that can be included with your programs to interface with
 the opal.library.  Also included is a program that calls a couple of the
 functions to test it, good for example.  If you have any problems, I can
 be found on the OpalVision Support BBS as Amiga Images.  I also can be
 found on Amiga Images BBS in Seattle as the sysop.

 The unit was converted from Opal_lib.fd using the FDToPas program sup-
 plied by HiSoft, then cleaned up tacked on the constants.  Sorry, I
 haven't included a compilable version of the unit (I want all repairs
 to go through me.)
