Since I originally posted PowerLOGO 1.3 on Aminet, there have been some
further events, mostly good ones.  I /did/ succeed in contacting Gary
Teachout (Those who helped me refused any reward, bless em!  I'm still
looking for Computer Science Logo Style Vol. 3, though.).

Gary sent me PowerLOGO 1.4 and the source code for what will be PowerLOGO
1.5.  I am passing along PowerLOGO 1.4 exactly as he sent it to me.  So, you
aren't getting any of the NewIcons or some of the examples I included last
time.  These things should eventually find their way back into the package
at some later date, perhaps with 1.5.

I consider 1.4 a stopgap release.  It still has many Enforcer hits!  I am
working to kill these and make PowerLOGO as stable as possible.  After the
program is stabilized, the next priorities will be the ASL requester and
some strongly enhanced handling of different screen modes (likely including
support of the screenmode requester, and new primitives to replace the
clumsy "openscreen" and "openwindow" -- don't worry, the current primitives
will still work!  The new ones will just be better.).

After that, datatypes and CyberGraphX support are possible.  Still further
along, we may think about a GUI editor or an integrated text editor or
somesuch.  And, I would like very much to see what sort of performance
PowerLOGO could achieve on a Power Amiga!

If anyone wants to contact me about PowerLOGO for any reason, with comments
or suggestions or whatever, you can reach me by email:

You can also write to Gary Teachout, who still has overall control of the
project.
