Utilities for number crunching, including vectors and complex numbers.


!              int
         int = Integer number.
   Computes the factorial of the number.  (Non-integer inputs produce
   "strange" results.)

cabs           complex
         complex = List of two numbers (first real, second imaginary).
   Output real absolute value of a complex number.

cadd           complex complex
         complex = List of two numbers (first real, second imaginary).
   Output complex sum of two complex numbers.

cconj          complex
         complex = List of two numbers (first real, second imaginary).
   Output complex conjugate of a complex number.

cdiv           complex complex
         complex = List of two numbers (first real, second imaginary).
   Output complex quotient of two complex numbers.

cmutl          complex complex
         complex = List of two numbers (first real, second imaginary).
   Output complex product of two complex numbers.

cscale         complex real
         complex = List of two numbers (first real, second imaginary).
         real = Any number.
   Output complex product of a complex number and a real number.

csqrt          complex
         complex = List of two numbers (first real, second imaginary).
   Output complex square root of a complex number.

csub           complex complex
         complex = List of two numbers (first real, second imaginary).
   Output complex difference between two complex numbers.

gcd            int int
         int = Integer number.
   Computes the greatest common divisor of the inputs.  (Non-integer
   inputs produce "strange" results.)

lcm            int int
         int = Integer number.
   Computes the least common multiple of the inputs.  (Non-integer
   inputs produce "strange" results.)
