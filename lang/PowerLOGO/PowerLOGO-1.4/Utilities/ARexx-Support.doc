The 'ARexx-Support' file provides a message port demon that allows LOGO to
act as a command host and function host for ARexx. LOGO gets a list from
the message and 'run's it.

The 'ARexx-Support' file also provides the following procedures to
communicate with ARexx, or other programs with an ARexx compatible
message port:


command                 text ( port-name host-name file-ext )
         text =   Word or list containing instruction to be run
                  by the command destination.
         port-name = Name of destination port, default 'REXX'.
         host-name = Name of port to get commands back from ARexx,
                     default output of 'hostport'.
         file-ext =  File name extension ARexx will use to find
                     command, default 'LOGO'.
   LOGO command to send an ARexx command.

command-string          text ( port-name host-name file-ext )
   LOGO command to send an ARexx string command.

command-async           text ( port-name host-name file-ext )
   LOGO command to send an ARexx command asynchronously.

command-string-async    text ( port-name host-name file-ext )
   LOGO command to send an ARexx string command asynchronously.

command-op              text ( port-name host-name file-ext )
   LOGO operation to send an ARexx command, and output a result.

command-string-op       text ( port-name host-name file-ext )
   LOGO operation to send an ARexx string command, and output a result.

function                text args ( port-name host-name file-ext )
         text =   Word or list containing instruction to be run
                  by the command destination.
         args =   List containing function inputs.
         port-name = Name of destination port, default 'REXX'.
         host-name = Name of port to get commands back from ARexx,
                     default output of 'hostport'.
         file-ext =  File name extension ARexx will use to find
                     command, default 'LOGO'.
   LOGO command to send an ARexx function.

function-async          text args ( port-name host-name file-ext )
