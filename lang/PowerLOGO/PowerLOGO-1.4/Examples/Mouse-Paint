;     This example is a simple paint program. The first instruction opens a
;  window, the second programs the mouse button demon to draw lines
;  whenever the mouse button is pressed in this window.
;     This runs entirely in the background, another program may be running
;  at the same time 

make "m-window openwindow [ @0 131 [ Mouse Paint ] 320 ]
whenmouse [
   while [ mousep ] [ make "m-d getmouse ]      ;  Remove mouse event.
   if = :m-window first :m-d [                  ;  Correct window?
      move :m-window item 2 :m-d item 3 :m-d    ;  Move cursor.
      make "m-d mouse :m-window                 ;  Check mouse.
      while [ = 1 item 3 :m-d ] [               ;  While button is down
         draw :m-window first :m-d item 2 :m-d  ;  Draw to pointer.
         make "m-d mouse :m-window              ;  Check mouse.
