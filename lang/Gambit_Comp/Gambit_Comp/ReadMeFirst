WHAT IS HERE

This is the complete Amiga sources and binaries for the Gambit Scheme
System (GSS) by Marc Feeley.  The Scheme sources here have been
compiled with Gambit and the C sources with the Lattice (now SAS)
compiler v5.04 using the 1.3 includes.  It has been tested under 1.3
and 2.04 with an Amiga 2000 using a GVP '030 upgrade and on various
500, 2000, and 3000 systems.  GSS implements the full R64RS and IEEE
Scheme (P1178) Standards with extensions (see QuickTour). 

The compiler and sources for the compiler an interpreter are 
included.  


WHAT IS REQUIRED

The compiler requires a minimum of 3MB of RAM and a hard disk to do
effective development, but generates very fast native 680x0 code.  The
interpreter runs in about 1.5 MB.  You can link Scheme and C code,
call C code from Scheme, and create stand-alone executable programs. 


THE COMPILER *IS* SHAREWARE

This is shareware, folks (see Notes, below).  However, for a high
quality native-code compiler with source the price, $40US, is not bad.
Mark has put man years of work into this system and a check from a
serious user will help keep him motivated to keep improving the
compiler and runtime system.  {note, send checks to Marc, not to me.
I am doing this because I think that Gambit is neat and to thank Marc
for making it available --Ken}

LATE NOTE: ***

Note that I did not have enough room on the disk to include the large
version of the interpreter.  I did include the small version which
will run on a vanilla m68000, emulating the FPU and 68020 instructions.
The interpreter is named "gsi.68k.small.emu" and requires the interpreter
runtime system to be in a directory "Gambit:runtime".  If you unpacked the
compiler to DH0:Gambit, then:
>> ASSIGN Gambit: DH0:Gambit
>> RENAME Gambit:objects/interpreter Gambit:runtime
>> RENAME gsi.68k.small.emu C:gsi

This will allow you to run the interpreter and hence the compiler.
You can build the larger version (which takes up more space but loads
faster) from the sources as per docs/build.doc.

If you got the companion disk (GambitInterpreter1.8) then you have a
choice of interpreter versions and can ignore this note.


USAGE

 Copy bin/#? to your C: directory.
 Invoke from the comand line as "gsi" {see gsi.man, QuickTour, & compiler.doc}

SCHEME EXTENSIONS

The ##System function allows you to exec calls; e.g. (##system "dir").
Futures are supported.  The full numeric tower, including rationals,
bignums, and complex math is supported: (sqrt -4) -> +2i .  Tracing
and interactive debugging are also provided (see QuickTour).


; NOTES

At the present time, GSS only runs on M680x0 based computers
(including M68000 to M68040).  GSS has been tested on SUN-3,
HP9000/3xx, NeXT, Amiga and BBN GP1000 (Butterfly) computers.  A
variant of GSS has also been ported to the Macintosh.

All Gambit code Copyright (C) 1992 by Marc Feeley.  Interpreter
requires a 1.5MB and is Freeware.  The Compiler require a 3 MB
Amiga and a hard disk.
