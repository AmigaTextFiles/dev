This material was submitted to me on disk directly by the Ken Dickey, who 
has done a considerable amount of work on the Amiga end of things.  Thanks Ken!

To make harddrive installation possible from the WorkBench, I've included the 
Unpack->HD icon and script.  The original installation script referred to in 
the documentation may be used instead if desired.
