%RapiDoc% RapiDoc 1.0 Manual

111 Prolog

RapiDoc is a package of programs, that makes creation of PDF documents a lot easier.
The documents are written using the RapiDoc document description language.
A compiler transates these to a especially optimized HTML document, which is converted
into PDF format using HTMLDOC.

The compiler itself is written in REBOL, a interpreter language, that is available for more than 40 platforms.
HTMLDOC is a HTML->PDF-converter, that is also available for many platforms.
The RapiDoc compiler translates the RapiDoc dokucente into HTML code, that is optimized as input for
HTMLDOC.

Though RapiDoc is not as powerful as Tex or HTML itself, it is a tool, that allows creation of
a variety of documents rapidly and with a short learning curve. This document itself is written
in RapiDoc and conveys a good impression, what can be done with it.

RapiDoc provides:

* title
* headers, that can be nested up to 6 levels
* automatical generation of table of contents
* images (GIF,JPEG,PiNG,Windows Bitmap)
* numbered enumerations
* unnumbered enumerations
* URL links
* manual page breaks
* comments
* special layout for source code paragraphs
* platform independant



It lacks:

* tables (planned)
* floating text around images (will not come in foreseeable future)
* marks within the text paragraphs (emphasizing, cites...) (planned)


111 Installation

Needs two external program packages:

222 Rebol

Needs the Rebol/View interpreter from at least version 1.2.
As for some platforms (Windows CE, Elate) only Rebol/Core exists,
I can do a adapted version if requested.

Note for MorphOS users: the AmigaOS version should also work on MorphOS.

Download at

:// http://www.rebol.com http://www.rebol.com

222 HTMLDOC

Tested using version 1.8.19. Older versions should work though.

HTMLDOC für

* AIX
* HP-UX
* IRIX
* Linux
* MS Windows '9x/NT
* Solaris
* Tru64

can directly be downloaded at

:// http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/htmldoc.html http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/htmldoc.html


The ports for

* AmigaOS
* MorphOS

are available at

:// http://fr3dy.meanmachine.ch http://fr3dy.meanmachine.ch

The supply sources for other platforms (MacOS,BeOS,QNX...) are not known to me, sorry.

111 Usage

Call:

 rebol rapidoc.r inputfile

inputfile is the path (syntax as used on your operating system) to your RapiDoc document.

A file inputfile.htm will be generated.

You then can use htmldoc to convert it to a structured html file, a postscript or a pdf document.

111 Elements of the language

222 Title

Every document begins with a line, that identifies it as a RapiDoc document.

 %RapiDoc%

Optionally a title for the document can be given:

 %RapiDoc% RapiDoc - eine Einführung und mehr...

222 Headers

Headers are improtant as they define the logical structure of a document. There are 6 different
levels of hierarchy. They must be nested correctly.No levels of hierarchy may be left out.

To get this structure:

 chapter1
   division1.1
     subdivision1.1.1
     subdivision1.1.2
   division1.2
 chapter2
   division2.1
 chapter3

following code is necessary:

 111 chapter1

 222 division1.1

 333 subdivision1.1.1

 333 subdivision1.1.2

 222 division1.2

 111 chapter2

 222 division2.1

 111 chapter3

222 Paragraphs

Principally text is handled as floating text. Line breaks are ignored.
If you'd like to begin a new paragraph, you simply include an empty line into the text:

 This is the text of the first paragraph.

 And here the second paragraph follows.

results in:


This is the text of the first paragraph.

And here the second paragraph follows.

222 Manual page break

Principally for every chapter (level 1 header) a new page is begun.
But you also can force an additional page break when needed.

 Here is some text.

 ---

 This text is on a new page.

---

222 Enumerations

Enumerations begin and end with an empty line each. Between the single points there may be no
empty lines !

Enumerations cannot be nested.

333 without numbers

 * Point One
 * Point Two
 * Point Three

results in:

* Point One
* Point Two
* Point Three

333 with numbers

 # Point One
 # Point Two
 # Point Three

results in:

# Point One
# Point Two
# Point Three

---

222 Source code passages

This is text that is displayed in a non-proportional font.
All spaces and line breaks are put unmodified into the output.

To create such passages, simply begin the text lines with spaces.

All source code passages in this document have been create this way.

222 Comments

Comments are text lines, which are not put into the outout at all.

 Line 1

 --- This is a comment

 Line 2

results in:


Line 1

!!! This is a comment

Line 2

222 URL-Links

To define an URL link to an external source, a line must begin with :// , follwed up by
the URL of the source itself and a text for the displayed description of the link.

 :// http://www.holzammer.net My private homepage

results in:


:// http://www.holzammer.net My private homepage

---

222 Images

Images are always included as separate paragraphs. Floating text is not possible !

They can be aligned left, centered, right.

 left aligned:

 %< example.jpg

 centered:

 %| example.jpg

 right aligned:

 %> ./example.jpg

results in:


left aligned:

%< example.jpg

---

centered:

%| example.jpg

right aligned:

%> ./example.jpg


Paths for images can be provided in the form Form of URLs and as local paths (Unix syntax).
With local paths its recommened not to use absolute paths !

As graphic formats you can use:

* GIF
* JPEG
* PiNG
* Windows Bitmap
