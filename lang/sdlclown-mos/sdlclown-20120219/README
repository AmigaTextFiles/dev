 Note: SDL_Clown is a fork of the clown script interpreter by
       the same author. It is an "extension" adding various SDL-based
       capabilities, most importantly graphics. Unlike clown,
       sdl_clown has no dynamic typesystem.

SDL_Clown Script Interpreter
============================

The use of SDL_clown is exhaustively explained in the file "Manual", 
however, here is a quick overview:

SDL_clown is a script interpreter experiment by young noob programmer.
It is written in C, has somewhat C-like syntax, and can do the 
following:

 - Arithmetic
 - Assignment
 - Built-in functions (sqrt/sin/cos/tan/floor)
 - Control flow (if and while)
 - Drawing colored rectangles
 - Expressions
 - Frame rate control
 - Floating-point variables
 - Floating-point variable arrays
 - Floating-point variable input
 - Interactive mode
 - Mouse coordinates
 - On-the-fly variable creation (without declaration)
 - Output of text mixed with expression or variable values
 - Parentheses
 - Program arguments
 - Relational operators
 - Shebang

SDL_clown *cannot* do the following important things:

 - Custom functions / procedures / subroutines
 - Operator precedence (proper order of operations)
 - String variables and operations

SDL_clown was not written by a programmer with great knowledge of
proper compiler design methods: I wrote much of it in complete
ignorance of stacks, grammars, etc.

In many parts of the source, rather than using existing
efficient algorithms and approaches (which I didn't know),
I tried to "reinvent the wheel" and improvised.

SDL_clown works by compiling scripts to bytecode and by running this
bytecode in a custom-made register-based VM.
