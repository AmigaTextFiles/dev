All the files in the directory SIOD are part of the interpreter;
fundamental parts of the language are defined in these files and loaded
only if necessary. An example of startup-sequence is contained in the s
directory. Remember that the interpreter looks first in the current
directory for the file "siod.scm" and during the session loads the autoload
files  from  the  SIOD:  directory. Assign the SIOD: device to the SIOD
directory and copy the file siod.scm in your working directory. If you want
to change the path for autoload files edit the siod.scm file and change the
definition of the variable mypath in the first non comment line.

The interpreter is composed of the following files:

  Char.scm                         Cxr.scm
  Debug.scm                        Delay.scm
  Exp-Imp.scm                      siod
  Port.scm                         siod.scm
  Siod.info                        sort.scm
  Small-Siod.scm                   String.scm
  Streams.scm                      Vector.scm
  Substring.scm

I hope that you can understand my terrible english (expecially the docs).
