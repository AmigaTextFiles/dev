SPECIAL KEYS

Some of the keys have special functions as
described below.

	<Esc> -- In command mode this key works like
  <Amiga>+<S>. For example, press <esc> during the
  execution of a LIST or DIR command to stop the
  command.

	<F?> -- The function keys have numbers from 1 to
  10 (i.e, <F1>, <F2>, <F3>...). Each key has a
  predefined text attached. Press the key and this
  text will be output on the screen just as if you
  had typed each character of the text, one by
  one.

	<Del> -- Deletes the character at the cursors
  position and the rest of the line is moved one
  character to the left.

	<-  -- The back space key works like the <Del>
  but instead of deleting the character at the
  cursor position, the character immediately to
  the left is deleted. Consequently the key has
  the same effect as <Left> followed by <Del>.

	<Ins> -- Toggles the insert flag. You will move
  from insert mode to overwrite mode or back
  again. This key is on the numeric keypad. Use
  <Shift>+<0> (shifted zero on the keypad).

	<Alt>+<Del> -- Deletes the cursor line and
  scrolls the remaining lines up.

	<Alt>+<Ins> -- Inserts an empty line at the
  cursor position and scrolls the remaining lines
  down.

	<Enter> -- The Enter keys are very important in
  AmigaCOMAL. Depending upon your computer model,
  the word ENTER or RETURN or just a broken arrow
  symbol will be on the keytop. There may be two
  of the keys on the keyboard, each identical in
  function. Press one of these keys and AmigaCOMAL
  reads the contents of the line containing the
  cursor. In direct mode, if the line contains a
  command, the command will be executed. If it
  contains a program line, the line will be
  checked for correct syntax and then stored.
  During program execution, pressing this key
  signifies the end of your INPUT.

	<Cursor keys> -- Used to move the cursor. If one
  of these keys are pressed (unshifted) the cursor
  moves in the corresponding direction. If the
  cursor hits the bottom of the window and the
  bottom line (or previous line) contains a
  program line, the program will be scrolled down.
  Likewise moving up past the top.

	<Shift>+<Cursor keys> -- Moves cursor to the
  indicated edge of the window. <Shift>+<Right>
  goes to the end of the line. If you are already
  at the top of the screen, <Shift>+<Up> will page
  the program listing up (if the top line listed
  is a program line). Likewise with <Shift>+<Down>
  at the bottom of the window. <PgUp> and <PgDn>
  on the numeric keypad (used with <Shift>) work
  just like <Shift>+<Up> and <Shift>+<Down>.

	<Ctrl> + <C> -- Repeats a FIND or CHANGE command.
  See description of FIND and CHANGE in Chapter 2.

	<Amiga> + <S> -- This key combination works much
  like <Esc>. In command mode the effect is
  exactly the same: to stop the execution of a
  command. But in addition, this key combination
  also stops the execution of a program.
  <Amiga>+<S> is a short cut for the STOP menu.

	<Amiga> + <N> -- A short cut for the NEW menu.
  The effect is the same as typing the NEW
  command.

	<Amiga> + <R> -- A short cut for the RUN menu.
  The effect is the same as typing the RUN
  command.

	<Amiga> + <Q> -- A short cut for the QUIT menu.
  The effect is the same as typing the BYE
  command.

	<Amiga> + <P> -- A short cut for the PAUSE menu.
  By pressing this key combination (or by
  selecting the PAUSE menu) a running program will
  be put into the waiting state until <Amiga>+<C>
  is pressed (or the Continue menu is selected).

	<Amiga> + <C> -- A short cut for the Continue
  menu. Being in command mode the effect is the
  same as typing the CON command. If you are in
  the Pause state the program execution will be
  resumed.

PEN COLOR

Choose one of 32 colors by printing a CHR$(X)
where X is a value between 128-159 (hex $80-$9f).

Example:

  PRINT chr$($80+3)  // sets color to 3

Print a CHR$(17) before and after the color code
to shift to the next 32 colors in Extra Half
Bright mode (some early Amiga models may not have
this mode).

Example:

  PRINT chr$(17),chr$(130),chr$(17) //color to 35

BACKGROUND COLOR

Print a CHR$(16) before and after the color code
to set the background to the specified color.

Example:

 PRINT chr$(16),chr$(130),chr$(16)//background 3

BIT PLANES

You must have installed AmigaCOMAL with enough
bit planes for the screen to see all the colors.
It takes 6 bit planes to display all 64 colors in
Extra Half Bright mode.
