HOW TO ENTER PROGRAMS

Line numbers are required for YOUR benefit in
editing a program (but are irrelevant to a
RUNNING program). Thus line numbers usually are
omitted when listing a COMAL program. It is up to
YOU to provide the line numbers. Of course, COMAL
CAN DO IT FOR YOU. Follow these steps to enter a
COMAL program:

1) Enter command: NEW

2) Enter command: AUTO

	3) Type in the program.

4) When done, stop the AUTO mode:

   Press the <Esc> key

You may use both UPPER and lower case letters
while entering a program. COMAL automatically
makes keywords UPPER case and variable names
lower case.

You don't have to type leading spaces in a line.
They are listed only to emphasize structures, and
COMAL will insert them for you. You DO have to
type a space between keywords in the program.

Variable names, procedure names, and function
names can be a combination of:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'_][\
