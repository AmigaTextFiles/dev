Question: What computers can run COMAL?
Answer: Commodore 64, Commodore 128, PET, CBM 8032,
MS-DOS, IBM-PC (MS-DOS) and PS/2 (OS/2), Amiga and
CP/M computers. An implementation is under way for
Apple IIe/IIc. There are several more versions
available in Europe, including Unix, BBC, Acorn,
RC, and Compis.

Question: Do you put out a newsletter?
Answer: Our COMAL TODAY newsletter is the source of
up to date information about COMAL. Contributions
come from leading COMAL experts as well as users
world-wide. Membership is not currently available,
but a subscription to COMAL TODAY is virtually the
same thing.

Question: Are your disks copy protected?
Answer: Absolutely NOT! You may make backup copies
for your own use. In fact, C64 Power Driver may be
given away, as can the Demo disk for AmigaCOMAL and
CP/M COMAL. You are not allowed to give out copies
of the other COMAL system disks, but you can
distribute or sell your own COMAL programs.

Question: Is a COMAL compiler available?
Answer: The reason most implementations of COMAL
are so fast is that they all are semi-compiled as
you enter the program! In addition to this, most
versions of COMAL include a Run Time Compiler, with
many advantages. A true compiler is not yet
available. However, the Run Time system turns COMAL
programs into stand-alone files that can be run
without the need of COMAL. Thus you can distribute
your COMAL programs to every user, not just those
who own COMAL.

Question: Do you recommend that students start with
COMAL and progress to LOGO or BASIC?
Answer: Yes! By all means start with COMAL. But No!
LOGO and BASIC are not needed once you are using
COMAL. BASIC is a step backwards and will only give
students bad habits to UNlearn later. And COMAL
includes virtually all of BASIC, without its
hassles. LOGO is usually chosen for its Turtle
Graphics - and these are included in many COMALs.
COMAL is the natural and official first language
taught in five European countries.

Question: How about sample programs?
Answer: Over 4000 programs on are available on more
than 50 different disks for the C64. Many of these
are being converted to disks for the new COMAL
implementations.

Question: Can a BASIC or LOGO program run under
COMAL?
Answer: No. However, it can be rewritten to do so.
Likewise, BASIC and LOGO cannot run a COMAL
program.

Question: Is COMAL Commodore and IBM approved?
Answer: Yes! It was approved by Commodore England.
Commodore Canada introduced it at the World of
Commodore Show, giving away over 500 COMAL disks in
two days. The COMAL Handbook was approved by
Commodore USA. The COMAL Cartridge is manufactured
by Commodore Denmark. IBM PC COMAL was produced by
IBM Denmark.

Question: Will a Common COMAL program I write on my
Amiga run on IBM?
Answer: Yes. We use a COMAL program to process
orders here. It was written on a Commodore but is
now running on an IBM PC compatible with 20 Meg
Hard disk. We only had to change the file names and
remove one short cut in substrings that Commodore
allows but IBM does not.

Question: COMAL lacks the left$, right$, and mid$
functions. Can I do substrings?
Answer: Yes. To get a portion of a string just
include the position of the first and last
character within the string. Example:

   part$:=text$(start:ending)
