AmigaCOMAL has all the COMAL Kernal and Common
COMAL keywords and structures. In addition it has
significant extensions! It is very fast (see the
benchmark programs results in this issue). It is
totally "Amigatized".

Plus all that, it seems to be a next generation
of COMAL by expanding the language. It seems just
as powerful as the new IBM PC COMAL 3.0, yet it
is not nearly as complex! POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

Here is just a sampling of AmigaCOMAL features:

* Includes built-in flexible File Requestor!

	* Built-in Editor with FIND and CHANGE. Page up
    and down your program listing or list a
    specific routine by name.

* Fully Common COMAL compatible!

* Multi-line IF and CASE decision structures.

	* Multi-line FOR, REPEAT, WHILE and LOOP loop
    structures, including LOOP x TIMES.

	* Super flexible multi-line Error Handler
    structure, complete with RETRY option.

	* User defined procedures and functions, with
    parameter passing, recursion and LOCAL
    variables.

	* IMPORT, EXPORT and GLOBAL statement for
    complete flexibility with CLOSED procedures
    and functions.

* Test out a procedure from direct mode!

	* Procedures and functions can be external to
    your program. A running program can execute
    them directly from disk.

	* Store procedures and functions on disk. Merge
    them into future programs with the MERGE
    command.

	* Instant syntax error help! If a program line is
    not correct, an error message window pops up
    with helpful information about what is wrong,
    and the cursor is placed at the point of
    error.

	* Automatic backup of files. Original file is not
    overwritten if you store a new file with the
    same name. The original file is renamed with
    the extension .backup tacked onto its name.

	* Protected INPUT fields. Your programs will have
    the professional look.

	* PRINT AT and INPUT AT let you position the
    starting location on the screen.

	* PRINT USING gives you formatting control of
    numeric output.

		* AmigaCOMAL support section on People Link and
    soon CompuServe national networks. Includes
    Download Libraries, Q&A Message base, Official
    notices and monthly conferences.

	* TURTLE GRAPHICS ARE INCLUDED (Logo compatible).

	* Record structures! They can be nested. A new
    record structure can use an existing model.

	* System structures! All the structures necessary
    to interface directly with AmigaDOS, Exec,
    Intuition, etc. are predefined for you.

	* Pointers are available. You can construct LISTS
    and TREES using these pointers!

* ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE for data areas.

	* COMPILER IS AVAILABLE. Make any COMAL program
    a stand-alone program that can be started
    directly from AmigaDOS (by CLI or WorkBench
    Icon). The icon is created automatically for
    you. You may distribute your compiled programs
    as you wish (no royalty to pay to AmigaCOMAL
    authors).

	* Pass parameters to a compiled COMAL program or
    to AmigaCOMAL itself (tooltypes from its icon
    in WorkBench, or the tail end of the command
    line in CLI).

	* List all the packages currently in "use"... or
    list all the new commands added by any package
    via the LISTPACK command.

	* TRACE and SINGLE STEP mode is available for
    program debugging.

	* TIME$ and DATE$ are included as well as TIMER.

	* Lines are Re-Listed immediately as you enter a
    program! Omitted words are inserted, keywords
    capitalized, = converted to :=, spacing
    corrected, indented to proper level, etc.

	* Execute and Command Windows can be separate or
    combined into one Window.

	* Scroll a program listing back up the screen if
    you just miss a line.

	* Page up or down a program listing. Go to the
    first page or last page.

	* WRITE PACKAGES IN COMAL! Finally I can write
    packages myself. Packages also may be written
    in C, Modula2, or Assembler.

	* SIGNAL is used by the system to allow any
    package instant access to import events
    occurring, such as USE, DISCARD, NEW, RUN,
    END, Error Abend, etc.

	* Pass the "name" of a procedure or function as
    a parameter.

	* Assign values to a whole array with one
    statement. Example:

	READ table(,) //reads values from DATA statements

* DIM can be used with normal variables.

	* Numbers can be represented in binary or hex as
    well as decimal.

	* SELECT INPUT and SELECT OUTPUT are joined by
    SELECT INOUT.

	* READWRITE is an added mode when opening files.

	* MININDEX and MAXINDEX return the top and bottom
    index to an array.

	* Includes Function Keys, Drop Down Menus, Mouse,
    and Window/Screen control.

	* Has an INSERT MODE. It can be set for just one
    line, or continual.

* Insert a blank line anywhere on the screen.

* Remove a line from anywhere on the screen.

	* Has Amiga Key short cuts to commands (Run,
    Step, Pause, Continue, Stop,...)

	* Install program gives you flexibility.
    Interlace screen or not, hi-res or not,
    default font, etc.

	* Amount of memory to allocate to COMAL work
    space is limited only by memory available.

	* Memory Window can be constantly open, always
    showing the free memory available to COMAL. It
    is the size of a title bar, and can be set to
    look like it is part of the AmigaCOMAL window
    titlebar.

	* Directory and Subdirectory control with CHDIR
    or CD, MAKEDIR or MKDIR, DIR$, DIR, CAT, UNIT
    and UNIT$.

	* Sequential and Random Access files in either
    ASCII or binary format.

	* PASS command to open a new CLI window or to
    pass a command to AmigaDOS.

	* WAIT command to put COMAL program in a waiting
    state (for a set time or until a key or mouse
    button is pressed). This does not tie up the
    CPU and is needed for proper multi-tasking.

	* Three types of integer variables for
    compatibility with C routines.

* ROUND is built in (plus the standard INT).

	* Repeat a string "function". Example:

	PRINT 5*"a"
	aaaaa.

* Screen and color controls.

	* Messages package gives full access to this
    Amiga capability.

	* Event handling / exceptions allow you to
    monitor exceptions. This allows a type of
    interrupt routine.

	* Direct interface to Amiga libraries, such as
    Exec_library, Dos_library, Intuition_library,
    Graphics_library, Layers_library,
    Diskfont_library, Icon_library, Potgo_library.

	* Devices package with its own predefined record
    structures.

	* Windows and Screens packages allow you open and
    control your own windows or screens.

	* Gfx, RastPort and View packages with predefined
    structures for your use.

	* Three different graphics packages to choose
    from. Turtle has Logo compatible graphics.
    PCGraphics is compatible with Commodore 64 and
    IBM PC COMAL graphics. Graphics is the
    standard package.

	* Speech package that makes it easy to have your
    Amiga talk back.

ALL THIS AND MORE as they say. There is a Demo
Version of AmigaCOMAL that may be freely copied.
It is the full system except that the SAVE and
ENTER commands are disabled. It allows you to
LOAD, LIST and RUN programs. You also can EDIT
them or write new ones and LIST them to disk.
However, to retrieve them, you need the FULL
version.

COMALs time may finally have come. AmigaCOMAL has
arrived (under $100) and IBM PC COMAL 2.2 has
dropped in price from $800 to only $165
(including the compiler). Disk loaded Power
Driver for the Commodore 64 is now only $9.95 and
includes a 22 lesson interactive on disk
tutorial.
