   ComalDemo.lzh and ComalDoc.lzh together constitute a complete AmigaCOMAL
demo, missing only SAVE.   
   COMAL is an incremental p-code compiler (i.e. an interpreted language)
from Denmark whose design purpose was to combine the modern structured
approach of Pascal with the ease of use and interactivity of BASIC.  COMAL
runs on IBM, VAX, CP/M, C-64, Amiga, and various European operating
systems.  It includes a complete turtle graphics package, is perfect for
education, yet is powerful enough for applications programming: AmigaCOMAL
supports low level programming and C-like structures. 
   In ComalDemo.lzh there are numerous Packages (external programs in
Assembler, C, or COMAL itself) that COMAL can use.  In the ComalDoc.lzh
are example programs and docs--including a fascinating account of the
history of the language from Borge Christensen himself.
   To uncompress the files use:   LHARC -a -x x filename.lzh 
   AmigaCOMALdemo expects to be on a disk called ComalDemo.  You can do
that, or use an ASSIGN, or run the INSTALL program to change the defaults,
which are saved in the .preferences file.  Install.sav is a COMAL program,
as is the HELP package it uses.  It gives a good example of COMAL
programming and its use of packages.
