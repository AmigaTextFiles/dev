AmigaCOMAL was first released September 1989.
-----
Nov 15, 1989 ... AmigaCOMAL 2.0 release. PCgraphics updated.
Command Window To Front is an installable option now.
There is a gorgeous file requestor (needs 103K extra memory though).
  To see it type: LOAD
Keys in Editor are more standard.
Insert Mode can be installed to turn off at end of line,
  or stay on till toggled off.
ASCII files created are now in Amiga style (LF)
  It still can read CR/LF files as well.
PCGraphics package fixed (FILL works).
Four demo packages show how SIGNAL works:
  ListSignal: prints each signal as received.
  SaySignal:  speaks each signal when received.
  RunPage:    clears the screen at the start of each program.
  EndWait:    waits for a right mouse button click at end of each program.
Deleted most icons for COMAL programs, making room for added programs.
Overscan screens are NOT supported. Reason: not documented by Commodore and
  they were advised by Commodore Denmark that if supported they could not be
  sure it would run under future operating systems.
VERSION function added to many packages following the standard:
  VERSION'PACKAGENAME$
  To see the version message for the SYSTEM package:
    PRINT version'system$
  The first 5 characters of the version text is reserved for the number:
    PRINT val(version'system$)
  To add VERSION to any COMAL coded package:
    EXPORT version'packagename$ // put this line at start of package
    FUNC version'packagename$ CLOSED // put this function somewhere
      RETURN " 1.00 PackageName by You Name."
    ENDFUNC version'packagename$
Install program updated. It now has pop up help screens.
