Demo of Amiga COMAL. Get ComalDoc.lzh too.
   ComalDemo.lzh and ComalDoc.lzh together constitute a complete
AmigaCOMAL demo, missing only SAVE.
   COMAL is an incremental p-code compiler (i.e. an interpreted
language) from Denmark whose design purpose was to combine the
modern structured approach of Pascal with the ease of use and
interactivity of BASIC. COMAL runs on IBM, VAX, CP/M, C-64,
Amiga, and various European operating systems. It includes a
complete turtle graphics package, is perfect for education, yet
is powerful enough for applications programming: AmigaCOMAL
supports low level programming and C-like structures.
   In ComalDemo.lzh there are numerous Packages (external
programs in Assembler, C, or COMAL itself) that COMAL can use. In
the ComalDoc.lzh are example programs and docs--including a
fascinating account of the history of the language from Borge
Christensen himself.
   To uncompress the files use: LHARC -a -x x filename.lzh
   AmigaCOMALdemo expects to be on a disk called ComalDemo. You
can do that, or use an ASSIGN, or run the INSTALL program to
change the defaults, which are saved in the .preferences file.
Install.sav is a COMAL program, as is the HELP package it uses.
It gives a good example of COMAL programming and its use of
packages.
