This  document  describes  a  Prolog  interpreter  for  VAX-11  and  PDP-11
computers running under the Unix operating system.  The original version of
the manual was written by L.M.  Pereira, F.C.N.  Pereira and D.H.D.  Warren
for  DECsystem-10  Prolog.   It  has been adapted for UNSW Prolog by Claude
Sammut.   The  interpreter  was  written in C by Claude Sammut while in the
Department  of  Computer  Science,  University  of New South Wales.  He was
assisted by Shaun Arundell (UNSW) and later modifications were suggested by
Alan  Feuer,  Bell  Labs,  Murray Hill.  Wherever possible we have tried to
make  this  system  compatible  with  the  Prolog-  10,  however, there are
significant  differences  and it should not be assumed that programs can be
ported without some changes.

Some  minor  editing  of  the  help  files  was done by Peter Urbanec.  The
changes pertain mainly to the implementation of UNSW Prolog under AmigaDOS.
Also,  all  the  help  files were reformatted to be nicely displayable with
more on an 80 column screen.

Any  queries  about  the  AmigaDOS  implementation of UNSW Prolog should be
directed to:

If  you  use  this  package and you think I deserve some kind of reward for
creating  the  Amiga  version  then  send  me  something  neat.   Software,
hardware,  MONEY,  job  offers,  food, whatever.  Yes, I am a poor starving
student!
