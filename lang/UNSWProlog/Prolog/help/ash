ash

Spawn  an  asynchronous  shell  from  Prolog.  The shell will open it's own
window  and  run independently of Prolog.  If your system has more than one
shell  available,  it  is  possible to specify which shell is to be used by
assigning  the  name  of the shell to the "SHELL" environment variable.  If
the  "SHELL" environment variable does not exist Prolog will use "NewShell"
as the default shell.
