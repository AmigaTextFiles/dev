In  plain English:  If you have something valuable on your computer and you
------------------  think  that this software might hurt it, then DON'T USE
                    THIS  PACKAGE.  I have been playing with it for a while
                    and  nothing  bad happened to me, but that doesn't mean
                    that  this  software  is  clean.   I have never got any
                    Enforcer hits, so I guess that should put some minds at
                    ease.   One  thing worth mentioning is that I have only
                    tested  this  software under WB2.05 and WB2.1.  There's
                    no version 37 (Workbench 2.x) specific code anywhere so
                    it  should  run under 1.3, but why would anyone use 1.3
                    is beyond me.


On  a  different  note.   If you find this package helpfull and you think I
deserve  some  kind  of  reward for creating the Amiga version then send me
something  neat.   Software,  hardware, MONEY, food, whatever.  Yes, I am a
starving student!


Installation  is  dead  simple.  You have completed most of it by unpacking
the  lha  archive.   All files should be in place and ready to be used.


Before  you  can  run  Prolog  with any level of success you need to assign
PROLOG:   to the directory where you installed Prolog.  On my machine, this
assign resides in the S:User-Startup file and looks like this:

      Assign PROLOG: DEC:Uni/Prolog

When  Prolog  starts  it  looks  for a file called PROLOG:prolog.lib, which
contains  some  important  configuration  information.   You  can customize
Prolog by modifying this file.  Read on to find out how.


Have a look through the file PROLOG:prolog.lib, it contains some predefined
macros  to  do  important  things.  It is one of the files to modify if you
want  to  customize  the  UNSW  Prolog interpreter to your environment.  In
particular  I  would  suggest  replacing the dir command in the help clause
with  ls, if you happen to have a copy of it on your system, as it produces
neater  output  than  dir.   The  same applies to the list_lib clause which
gives you a listing of the contents of the prolog library of functions.


UNSW Prolog can be run either from the Workbench or from the Shell.  If you
double  click  on the Prolog icon, the program will open it's window on the
Workbench  screen,  display  the version information and present you with a
prompt.   The  Shell version behaves in exactly the same manner except that
it  does  not  open a window of its own, but uses the Shell window instead.
When  executed  from the Shell additional options can be specified.  The -s
option  allows  you to specify the amount of stack space that Prolog should
use.   Beware,  this stack is not equivalent to the AmigaDOS stack.  The -s
option  sets  an  internal stack used to store backtracking information and
other things.  To set the internal stack to ten thousand units for example,
you would invoke Prolog as follows:

      Prolog -s10000

Another  benefit  of  invoking  Prolog  from the Shell is the capability to
specify  files  to  be  loaded  by  the  interpreter  before  the prompt is
displayed.   The current limit to the number of files that can be specified
on the command line is 30.  If you need more than that I seriously urge you
to  reconsider your method of attack.  To load two files upon invocation of
Prolog you might issue a command line such as this:

      Prolog relations.prlg engine.prlg

Providing  there  are  no  errors you will be presented with the prompt and
both files will be in the memory.


Be  carefull  with  the  editor commands (ed and ef).  They are synchronous
commands,  meaning  that  if  your  editor  loads the file and then returns
immediately,  no  changes  will  take effect.  An example of this is ASDG's
Cygnus  Ed  Professional.   The  ed command supplied with this package will
load your file and return.  Prolog will resume it's execution as soon as ed
returns,  which  means  that  the  file  being  edited  will effectively be
written,  and  then  immediately read back.  With CEd the solution is quite
simple,  define  an  environment  variable called EDITOR which contains the
string ed -sticky.

      setenv EDITOR "ed -sticky"

This will launch ed synchronously.

If  you  find any errors or bugs (most likely in the manuals or help pages)
please  let  me  know so that I can correct this for the next distribution.

For interests sake my development system consists of WorkBench 2.1 and
SAS/C V6.1 running on A2500 with A2630 68030+68882 board populated with 4
Megs of 32-bit RAM, ICD AdSCSI2000 SCSI interface, Digital Equipment
Corporation 106Meg RZ23L SCSI drive, SyQuest SQ-555 SCSI 44 Meg removable
cartridge drive and a lousy Commodore 1084s monitor.  I need a multisync
and a flicker fixer badly, send donations or job offers to the above
address.
