   The Class @{B}Fraction@{UB} is an implementation of rational numbers (i.e.,
   ones with a numerator & denominator) for the @{B}AmigaTalk@{UB} system.
   The parent Class is @{B}Magnitude@{UB}.

   The methods defined for Class @{B}Fraction@{UB} are:
   @{FG SHINE}
   new @{FG TEXT}

    Initialize a new instance of Class @{B}Fraction@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   numerator @{FG TEXT}

    Return the @{B}Integer@{UB} that represents the numerator.
   @{FG SHINE}
   denominator @{FG TEXT}

    Return the @{B}Integer@{UB} that represents the denominator.
   @{FG SHINE}
   fraction @{FG TEXT}

    Return the @{B}Float@{UB} that represents the @{B}Fraction@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   asFloat @{FG TEXT}

    Return the @{B}Fraction@{UB} as a floating point number.  Report an
    error if the denominator is zero.
   @{FG SHINE}
   coerce: aNumber @{FG TEXT}

    Transform @{B}aNumber@{UB} to a @{B}Fraction@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   numerator: newNum @{FG TEXT}

    Change the numerator of the receiver to @{B}newNum@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   denominator: newDenom @{FG TEXT}

    Change the denominator of the receiver to @{B}newDenom@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   reciprocal @{FG TEXT}

    Invert the @{B}Fraction@{UB} & report an error if the old numerator
    was zero, resulting in an improper @{B}Fraction@{UB}.  Return the
    floating point representation of the @{B}Fraction@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   + aNumber @{FG TEXT}

    Add @{B}aNumber@{UB} to the receiver @{B}Fraction@{UB}.  If @{B}aNumber@{UB}
    is not a @{B}Fraction@{UB}, transform it into one first.
    Return the floating-point representation of the result.
   @{FG SHINE}
   - aNumber @{FG TEXT}

    Subtract @{B}aNumber@{UB} to the receiver @{B}Fraction@{UB}.  If 
    @{B}aNumber@{UB} is not a @{B}Fraction@{UB}, transform it into one first.
    Return the floating-point representation of the result.
   @{FG SHINE}
   * aNumber @{FG TEXT}

    Multiply @{B}aNumber@{UB} to the receiver @{B}Fraction@{UB}.  If 
    @{B}aNumber@{UB} is not a @{B}Fraction@{UB}, transform it into one first.
    Return the floating-point representation of the result.
   @{FG SHINE}
   / aNumber @{FG TEXT}

    Divide @{B}aNumber@{UB} to the receiver @{B}Fraction@{UB}.  If
    @{B}aNumber@{UB} is not a @{B}Fraction@{UB}, transform it into one first.
    Return the floating-point representation of the result.
   @{FG SHINE}
   printString @{FG TEXT}

    Print the receiver as a @{B}String@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   == aNumber @{FG TEXT}

    Test whether the receiver is equal to @{B}aNumber@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   ~= aNumber @{FG TEXT}

    Test whether the receiver is NOT equal to @{B}aNumber@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   <  aNumber @{FG TEXT}

    Test whether the receiver is less than @{B}aNumber@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   >  aNumber @{FG TEXT}

    Test whether the receiver is greater than @{B}aNumber@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   <= aNumber @{FG TEXT}

    Test whether the receiver is less than or equal to @{B}aNumber@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   >= aNumber @{FG TEXT}

    Test whether the receiver is greater than or equal to @{B}aNumber@{UB}.
