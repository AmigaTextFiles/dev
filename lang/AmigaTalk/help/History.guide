@NODE "Future" "AmigaTalk Future plans: "        
   In order of priority here is what's coming for AmigaTalk:
@{FG SHINE}
   FUTURE: @{FG TEXT}

   * Compile a version of the program for the newer PPC hardware (if I get
     enough money to buy one!)
     
   * Finish Testing & Debugging the DataBase.st Classes.

   * Add a Screen Mode Selection Menu Item.  This might not happen
     since a lot of the environment depends on the Screen that you
     started the program with.  I recommend that you just do the 
     following: @{FG SHINE}
     
        You can get around this absence by editing the first line
     of @{" AmigaTalk.env " LINK "AmigaTalk.guide/EnvFormat"} to read @{B}$0@{UB} & then run
     AmigaTalk, which will force the program to ask you for a
     ScreenModeID. @{FG TEXT}

   * Write more general User Class examples for using AmigaTalk.
     (Right after this, I'll get on with writing a Mideast peace plan).
        
   * Finish Documentation (yeah, right!)

   * Add System/Utility.st

   * Add System/ALib.st

   * Add System/Hooks.st   (Probably will NOT happen).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Latest" "AmigaTalk latest additions:"

   For Version 2.7, the following enhancements/bug fixes were
   made:

   * The archive now contains a reset AmigaTalk.env file.  The first
     time you run AmigaTalk it will ask you for a ScreenModeID to
     use, then save it in AmigaTalk.env when the program exits.
      
   * The Install script no longer dies due to lack of Hooks/ or
     CodeLib/.  The install script has been verified to work 
     correctly with V2.7.
     
   * Menu checking now agrees with command line paramters.
              
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Version2.6" "V2.6 (Released on 22-Dec-2003):"

   For Version 2.6, the following enhancements/bug fixes were
   made:
           
   * Fixed a bug in V2.5 internal variables handling code that was
     not apparent until a new page of variables had to be allocated
     (a page contains 61 variables).
   
   * Fixed the broken class ListViewGadget in NewGadget.st
     
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Version2.5" "V2.5 (Released on 11-Dec-2003):"

   For Version 2.5, the following enhancements/bug fixes were
   made:

   * Rewrote the Memory management code so that AmigaTalk will actually
     free the memory used during program execution.  AmigaTalk still uses 
     a reference-counting scheme to keep track of active Objects, but the 
     original Little-Smalltalk code never freed anything when the program
     was exiting (if you're lucky, it would actually free Objects during
     execution, but most of the time it would stick unused Objects onto
     free lists).  The program will check that you have enough memory
     available to run the program (against the *TableSize ToolTypes in
     the Icon).

   * Added a better way to keep track of Intuition, DosFlags, BOOPSITags
     DataTypeTags & PrinterTags.  Originally, they were subclassed as
     Dictionaries, which made them much larger than necessary.  With the
     new system, these Tags & Flags are stored in the AmigaTalk:CodeLib/
     directory as files, which are opened & read in when you instantiate the
     appropriate Class.  This saves over 20MB of memory & a lot of loading
     time at the start of the program.  The only drawback is that the files
     no longer contain comments as to what the various Flags & Tags are for
     (better buy the RKM or get help from someone that has one!).

   * Added ATalkConfig to the distribution so that you can configure
     the program to your tastes.

  *  According to page 14 of @{I}"A Little Smalltalk"@{UI} by Tim Budd: @{B}
     "Within the array list the leading pound sign on symbols and arrays
     can be eliminated."@{UB}  This behavior is no longer true for statements
     entered in the Command Line String Gadget or in Script files.  By allowing
     lowerCase variables in Arrays & ByteArrays, we can now just place
     variables in Arrays or ByteArrays & AmigaTalk will perform the 
     substitution(s) necessary to generate correct code.  The Parser can be
     made to do the same thing, but the Interpreter does not know how to
     find instance variables or context variables in order to perform the
     substitution(s).  This is not really a bug, but there is now a deviation
     between the Parser & what you can do with script files & the Command String
     Gadget!  @{B}Also, be aware that variables in ByteArrays MUST be Integers
     or Characters;@{UB} otherwise you will see an error message generated!
      
   * Added the @{" GTBTranslator " LINK "GTBTranslator.guide/Main"} program to the distribution.

   * Added two new menu items to the @{B}PROJECT@{UB} Menu to allow the addition
     & removal of User Script calls to the @{B}USER SCRIPTS@{UB} Menu.
     See @{" AddUserScript " LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/AddUserScript"}

   * Added the following Classes to the General directory:
     @{" DependencyTransformer "  LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/DependencyTransformerClass"}

     @{" Model "                  LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/ModelClass"}
       @{" ValueModel "           LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/ValueModelClass"}
         @{" ComputedValue "      LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/ComputedValueClass"}
           @{" BlockValue "       LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/BlockValueClass"}
         @{" PluggableAdaptor "   LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/PluggableAdaptorClass"}
         @{" ProtocolAdaptor "    LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/ProtocolAdaptorClass"}
           @{" AspectAdaptor "    LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/AspectAdaptorClass"}
           @{" IndexedAdaptor "   LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/IndexedAdaptorClass"}
             @{" SlotAdaptor "    LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/SlotAdaptorClass"}
         @{" ValueHolder "        LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/ValueHolderClass"}
           @{" BufferedValueHolder " LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/BufferedValueHolderClass"}
      
   * Fixed a minor bug in the @{" C/Parse " LINK "Amigatalk:Help/Amigatalk.guide/ParseHelp"} program that did not allow using @{B}|@{UB}
     inside a Block as a colon variable delimiter.  It did accept @{B}!@{UB}
     but it should have accepted both @{B}|@{UB} and @{B}!@{UB}

   * Fixed another annoying bug in the @{" C/Parse " LINK "Amigatalk:Help/Amigatalk.guide/ParseHelp"} program
     that would interpret #Symbol] as a complete @{" Symbol " LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/SymbolClass"} & not as
     #Symbol ], which is sometimes found at the end of a @" Block " LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/BlockClass"}.
     The Parser would therefore never find the end of the Block &
     call it an error.  This means that #] will NOT be interpreted
     as a Symbol (use @{B}']' asSymbol@{UB} instead).  This bug was also present
     in the interpreter & was fixed.
     
   * Added arc drawing methods to @{" Pen.st " LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/PenClass"}

   * Changed unused primitive 139 to FileClose (see @{" File.st close method " LINK "Amigatalk:Help/GeneralClasses.guide/FileClass"}).

   * Added the @{B}Load Class Source File...@{UB} menuItem.
           
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Version2.4" "V2.4 (released on 02-Sep-2003):"

   For Version 2.4, the following enhancements/bug fixes were
   made:

   * Incorporated the Browser CanDo deck into the program.  CanDo libraries
     are no longer necessary since the Browser is no longer a separate
     program.
        
   * Added the Hooks directory to the distribution.  (Not currently implemented)

   * Linked in the CDDevice Class primitives (Nobody used it, so 
     nobody noticed it was missing).
     
   * Added three new methods to the AmigaTalk Class to control 
     the tracing of bytecodes in order to fix the lack of selective
     tracing (See traceState, traceOn & traceOff methods in 
     AmigaTalk:General/AmigaTalk.st).  Furthermore, some methods in
     General Classes will turn off the Tracing paradigm so that the
     trace file you generate will not be excessively large.  The main
     culprits are @{B}new, new: basicNew & basicNew: @{UB}in Class.st
     This change also necessitated the creation of two new script files
     in the C/ directory (TracerOn, TracerOFF) -- Leave them alone,
     they are used internally!
     
   * eliminated the pseudo variables @{B}smalltalk & amigatalk@{UB}.
     a genuine variable named @{FG SHINE}amigatalk @{FG TEXT}is created in the
     AmigaTalk:C/InitializeCommands file to take their place.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Version2.3" "V2.3 (released on 30-Jan-2003):" 

   For Version 2.3 the following enhancements/bug fixes were
   made:

   * Added catalog support to the program (now, send me your
     translation files!).  See AmigaTalk:Locale/Catalogs/
     directory.
        
   * Added Layers.st to the Intuition/ directory to support 
     using layers.library (why anyone would want to put themselves
     through the torture of using layers is beyond me).

   * Fixed some bugs in GadTools.st so that the test files now run
     correctly.

   * Added ARexx.st to the System/ directory.

   * Added MsgPort.st to the System/ directory.

   * Fixed the writeable() function so that it uses AmigaDOS Examine().

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Version2.2" "V2.2 (released on 29-Oct-2002)"

   For Version 2.2 the following enhancements/bug fixes were
   made:
   
   * Fixed the install script (by deleting the History.txt copy
     action & including the Images directory in the distribution).
     
   * Added Status Window coordinate bookeeping to the @{" AmigaTalk.env " LINK "AmigaTalk.guide/EnvFormat"}
     file.
   
   * Added more error detection code to initialization of the
     AmigaTalk screen code so that the Command & Status window
     will fill whatever screen you select.  I've been able to check
     almost all screen modes that the CyberVision-64D uses (except
     for 16-bit 1024 * 768, which shows a black screen).  
     AmigaTalk will not let you use a Screen smaller than 640 * 400,
     so don't try to.  If you rename @{B}AmigaTalk.env, AmigaTalk@{UB} will
     use the coordinates from your Workbench screen (or whatever
     screen is active).

   * Added a ScreenModeID ToolType to the Icon (default: 0x40D20001).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Version2.1" "V2.1  (Released on 19-Oct-2002)"

   For Version 2.1 the following enhancements were added:

   * Added a DataBase.st file in the User directory.  It's
     NOT completely tested & debugged yet, so just use the 
     methods in the TestFiles directory as a guide as to what
     works with these new Classes.
        
   * The GUI font can now be selected via the UseFont ToolType
     (If you mis-spell the font, the ASL Font Requester will
     pop up before the GUI opens.  Any change you make will be
     placed in the UseFont ToolType also).
     
   * Changed to using RawKeys for the Command GUI Window.
     (press f1 to see if it works!)

   * The Parser will now pop up with an information requester
     if it finds an error (assuming that there is at least
     one Active Window open).

   * Fixed a Parser bug that hung up on parsing DataBase.st
     (I added it by trying to prettify the output of the Parser).
          
   * Added the Audio Class (see System/Audio.st)
   
   * Added the Key Class (See System/Keyboard.st)

   * Added the Console Class (See System/Console.st)

   * Added the following Singleton Classes to Intuition/

      BoopsiButtonTags.st
      BoopsiCheckBoxTags.st
      BoopsiChooserTags.st
      BoopsiClassNames.p

   * Removed the Editor Window from TheBrowser (it was too much of
     a headache to maintain!).
     @{FG SHINE}@{B}
   * Added the ability to process an Initialization script & an
     update script to the program (in the AmigaTalk:C/ directory).
     @{UB}@{FG TEXT}
   * Added BOOPSI, IFF, & GadTools Classes & support.
     
   * Singleton Classes are now indeed Singletons!

   * Increased the program stack size from 4000 to 50,000.

   * Added some new ToolTypes to the Icon.
      
   * Fixed a bug in the Parse program in AmigaTalk:c/ that led to
     placing a null pointer into the interpreter stack, leading
     to an internal error.  This means that any classes you've written
     that led to the Internal error requester might be fixed if you
     simply send them through the Parse program again.
     
   * Changed the input line buffer size from 8192 to 32768 for some
     large methods in system.p.
     
   * Re-wrote the library.st source for System.p.  This means that any
     classes you might have derived from the Library class are now
     broken (sorry!)

   * Re-wrote the BitMap & Border classes & sourcecode.  This means 
     that any classes you might have derived from them are now
     broken (sorry!)

   * A lot of other Intuition & System Classes were re-written.  This means 
     that any classes you might have derived from them are now broken
     (sorry!)   
     
   * Added the Classes SafeDOS, UnSafeDOS, DangerousDOS & VeryDangerousDOS
   
   * Added the PrinterDevice class.

   * First stable, working release of AmigaTalk©.  Once the original source
     code for Little Smalltalk V1.0 was cleaned up (removed all macros
     that should have been functions, placed Global variables & flags in
     one file, re-formatted all code to make it readable, & changed the
     function declarations to static wherever possible), the last few
     bugs were found in the ByteCode interpreter & the code started

     TAB key from your keyboard, no two editors or printers treat them the
     same, so they just have to be transformed to spaces anyway!)

   * All Intuition objects (except for Alerts) were given Classes.
     Gadgets & Menus will be re-done for a later revision of AmigaTalk
     to use NewGadgets & NewMenus.
     
   * Classes for the following System Devices & parts were added:
      Device.st       "Abstract Class."
      GamePort.st     "Access to the Mouse & GamePort devices."
      Library.st      "Access to shared Library information."
