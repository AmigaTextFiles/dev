@NODE main  "Graph Class implementation for AmigaTalk© 1998-2000:"

   The @{B}Graph@{UB} Class is a class that uses an Amiga @{" Window " LINK "Intuition.guide/WindowClass"} to
   display graphs of functions for the @{B}AmigaTalk@{UB} system.  
   Its parent Class is @{" Painter " LINK "Intuition.guide/PainterClass"}.

   A programmer should use the following as a guide:
      @{FG SHINE} @{B}
      g <- Graph new 

      g initialize: 'graph Screen' winTitle: 'graph Window:'

      g open: 16r40D20001 from: 0@0 to: 640@480

      ...

      g close @{FG TEXT}@{UB} (see @{B}AmigaTalk:TestFiles/TestGraphPaper@{UB})
   
   Methods available for the @{B}Graph@{UB} Class are:
   @{FG SHINE}
   initialize: scrTitle winTitle: title @{FG TEXT}

     Set up the instance variables for a new instance of @{B}Graph@{UB}. 
   @{FG SHINE}
   setSizeFrom: orPoint to: brtPoint @{FG TEXT}

     Internal method (used by @{I}open:from:to:@{UI}), so it's not really necessary
     to use this method in your programs, unless you want to change the
     size of your graph (that means YOU get to re-write this class!).
   @{FG SHINE}
   open: screenMode from: oPoint to: brPoint @{FG TEXT}
    
     Opens the @{" Screen " LINK "Intuition.guide/ScreenClass"} & @{B}Window@{UB} for your graph, using the screenMode to
     determine the type of @{B}Screen@{UB} to use.
   @{FG SHINE}
   refreshGraphPaper @{FG TEXT}
     
     Used to refresh the edges of the @{B}Window@{UB} (if you use a border, default
     is NO border).
   @{FG SHINE}
   setPen: pen @{FG TEXT}

     Change the color used to draw graphic elements.
   @{FG SHINE}
   setXAxisFrom: xmin to: xmax by: deltax @{FG TEXT}

     Set the range, x-increment size & (indirectly) the xscale.
   @{FG SHINE}
   setYAxisFrom: ymin to: ymax by: deltay @{FG TEXT}

     Set the domain, y-increment size & (indirectly) the yscale.
   @{FG SHINE}
   plotPoint: xpt y: ypt @{FG TEXT}

     Put a pixel (in the current pen color) at the coordinates specified.
   @{FG SHINE}
   drawLine: x1 y1: y1 x2: x2 y2: y2 @{FG TEXT}

     Draw a line (in the current pen color) from one set of coordinates
     to the next (x2,y2).     
   @{FG SHINE}
   drawXTick: xp y: yp @{FG TEXT}

     Internal method called by @{I}drawXAxis:numTicks:color:@{UI}
   @{FG SHINE}
   drawYTick: xp y: yp @{FG TEXT} 
   
     Internal method called by @{I}drawYAxis:numTicks:color:@{UI}
   @{FG SHINE}
   drawGrid: xticks y: yticks color: pen @{FG TEXT}

     Draw a grid of lines (in order to make point finding easier).
   @{FG SHINE}
   drawXAxis: y0 numTicks: nticks color: pen @{FG TEXT}

     Draw an X-Axis across the @{B}Graph@{UB} (one side of the @{B}Window@{UB} to the other).
   @{FG SHINE}
   drawYAxis: x0 numTicks: nticks color: pen @{FG TEXT}

     Draw an Y-Axis vertically across the @{B}Graph@{UB} (from Top of the @{B}Window@{UB} 
     to the Bottom).
   @{FG SHINE}
   drawLabel: labelstr at: aPoint @{FG TEXT}

     Draw a @{" String " LINK "GeneralClasses.guide/StringClass"} starting at the location specified.
   @{FG SHINE}
   tellScales @{FG TEXT}
     
     Print a @{B}String@{UB} in the Status @{B}Window@{UB}, indicating what the current
     values for xscale & yscale aare.
   @{FG SHINE}
   tellRange @{FG TEXT}

     Print a @{B}String@{UB} in the Status @{B}Window@{UB}, indicating what the current
     value for the range (x-values) of the @{B}Graph@{UB} is.
   @{FG SHINE}
   tellDomain @{FG TEXT}

     Print a @{B}String@{UB} in the Status @{B}Window@{UB}, indicating what the current
     value for the domain (y-values) of the @{B}Graph@{UB} is.
   @{FG SHINE}
   xScale @{FG TEXT}
    
     Return the value of xscale.
   @{FG SHINE}
   yScale @{FG TEXT}

     Return the value of yscale.
   @{FG SHINE}
   range @{FG TEXT}

     Return the current range as a @{B}String@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   domain @{FG TEXT}

     Return the current domain as a @{B}String@{UB}.
   @{FG SHINE}
   close @{FG TEXT}

     Close the @{B}Graph@{UB}'s @{B}Window@{UB} & @{B}Screen@{UB}.
