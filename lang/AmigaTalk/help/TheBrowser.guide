   @{B}TheBrowser@{UB} is now a part of the AmigaTalk program & is no longer
   a CanDo deck.

   @{B}TheBrowser@{UB} consists of several different windows that perform specific
   functions:
   
      @{" Class Browser       " LINK "TBClassBrowser"} view classes & methods.
      @{" Add Class Window    " LINK "TBAddClassWind"} add a class to system.
      @{" Delete Class Window " LINK "TBDeleteClassW"} delete a class.
      @{" ToolTypes Editor    " LINK "TBToolTypesEdi"} edit icon tooltypes.

@ENDNODE

@NODE TBClassBrowser "The Class Browser Window:"

   The @{B}Class Browser@{UB} consists of 3 ListView-type gadgets & 1 String-type
   gadget.  There is also a Menu strip attached to the window that is
   documented elsewhere.  No editing can be done on this window, that's 
   what the Method Editor is for.  When the Browser is first opened,
   a list of the classes you asked for is displayed.  Clicking on a Class in the
   List View will display the methods associated with the class in the Methods
   List View gadget.  Clicking on a method will display the source code for
   the Method(s) in the Method Source List View gadget.
   
   Checking the OPTIONS/Show ByteCodes menuItem will display a ByteCode
   translation of the Current Method in the Method Source List View.

   There is also a Command String Gadget that will send any AmigaDOS command
   to the AmigaOS for you.

@NODE TBAddClassWind "The Add a Class Window:"

   Notice that the Classes ListViewer contains all sets of classes (General,
   Intuition, System & User).

   @{B}Parent Class, Class Name & File Name@{UB} must all be non-empty before 
   you press the @{I}ADD CLASS!@{UI} button, or the Browser will
   display a User Error Notice.

   Pressing & releasing the @{I}ADD CLASS!@{UI} button will write your data to the 
   filename supplied in the File Name string gadget.
   
   The Class Methods TextEditor can be left blank (but you should enter as many
   methods as you might need later).
   
   The Class Instance Variables TextEditor can be left blank unless there 
   are instance variables associated with the new Class.

   Clicking on the Close Gadget will return you to the @{" Browser Window " LINK "TBClassBrowser"}.
