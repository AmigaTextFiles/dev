   @{BOLD Help Viewer} (1.6) is a GUI for finding & displaying text files or 

   @{AmigaGuide} files.  Change the @{" ToolTypes " LINK "ToolTypes"} & you can select which files

   to list & choose from.  You can also set the program that displays the 

   file using the @{" FileViewer " LINK "ToolTypes"} ToolType.  Some keys can be used to perform the

   same functions as certain gadgets (see @{" Alternate Keys " LINK "AltKeys"} ).

   @{BOLD Help Viewer} was written using @{FG SHINE}GadToolsBox V37.300 & SAS-C V6.58.@{FG TEXT}

   @{BOLD Help Viewer} requires a @{FG SHINE}68020@{FG TEXT} CPU or better.

@NODE "Controls" "Help Viewer Controls:"
@PREV "Main"
     @{BOLD Help Viewer} has very few controls to discuss.  The main controls the
   
   User really has to use are the @{BOLD Documents:} ListView Gadget & the @{B}@{U}V@{UU}iew File@{UB}

   button gadget.  Click on the document in the ListView gadget that you wish

   to examine with the @{" FileViewer " LINK "ToolTypes"} set in the ToolTypes of the Icon, then press

   & release the @{B}@{U}V@{UU}iew File@{UB} button gadget.

     You can change the directory to find your documents in with the 
   
   @{B}@{U}C@{UU}hange Dir@{UB} button gadget, or by directly typing in the path & filename

   you're looking for in the @{BOLD "File Name:"} string gadget.  There is also
    
   a graphic button next to the @{BOLD "File Name:"} string gadget that will bring up

   the ASL File Requester, allowing you to browse the file system & find the

   document you wish to view.  The only other control is the Close Window

   gadget located in the upper left corner of the GUI.

@NODE "AltKeys" "Help Viewer Keyboard controls:"

@NEXT "ToolTypes"
   If you enter certain keys from the keyboard the program will perform as follows:
   
   @{FG SHINE}@{B}q, Q, e, E, x, X @{UB}@{FG TEXT}will exit the program, so will clicking on the Close Window Gadget.

   @{FG SHINE}@{B}c, C @{UB}@{FG TEXT}is equivalent to clicking on the @{B}@{U}C@{UU}hange Dir@{UB} button gadget.
         
   @{FG SHINE}@{B}v, V @{UB}@{FG TEXT}is equivalent to clicking on the @{B}@{U}V@{UU}iew File@{UB} button gadget.

   @{FG SHINE}@{B}i, I @{UB}@{FG TEXT}will show an information Requester.         

@ENDNODE

@NODE "ToolTypes" "Help Viewer ToolTypes:"
@PREV "AltKeys"
@NEXT "Main"

   The following Default ToolTypes are used by this program:


      @{FG SHINE}ParentDir@{FG TEXT}     = AmigaTalk:Help/
 
      @{FG SHINE}FileViewer@{FG TEXT}    = MultiView

      @{FG SHINE}FileExtFilter@{FG TEXT} = (#?.doc@{FG SHINE}|@{FG TEXT}#?.guide)


   Change them to suit yourself, but be careful with the @{BOLD FileExtFilter}
   
   ToolType.  The ASL File Requester & AmigaDOS C functions used within
   
   the program expect the parentheses to be around the expression if you
   
   use the @{FG SHINE}@{B}|@{UB}@{FG TEXT} in making complicated expressions.  I'm sure that 
    
   there are other quirks, but until @{BOLD "Amiga Inc."} documents them, we're stymied.
