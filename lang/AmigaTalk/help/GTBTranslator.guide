@TOC "Contents"
  This manual is intended as an aid in using the @{B}GTBTranslator ©@{UB}
  system.  It is not intended to be used as a primer on the SmallTalk language
  or C or @{" GadToolsBox " LINK "gadtoolsbox"}.  @{B}GTBTranslator ©@{UB} is a program that takes the
  output files of GadToolsBox V2.0b & translates their contents into either
  a C source file or an AmigaTalk source file.

  The main reason I wrote these program(s) is because I got tired of
  editing the generated C source files from GadToolsBox.  It takes at least
  two hours per project simply to make the output from GadToolsBox readable
  & compilable.  There are also several problems that have to be corrected
  in order for the generated source to run correctly as well.  @{B}GTBTranslator@{UB}
  will also generate an SMakeFile & the Locale header file associated with
  your C-source code.
  
  Currently, GTBTranslator is intended to generate simple, one-window
  GUIs.
  
  In order to use GTBTranslator, you have to have the @{" Requirements " LINK "requirement"}.

@NODE "idTags" "Tag strings used by GTBScanner:"

  GTBScanner looks for tags in a .template file in order to determine where to
  place certain parts of generated code into either the C-source file or
  in an AmigaTalk source file.  The following tags are used in a C-template 
  file in order to figure out where to place the various parts of the GUI
  specified in the .ini file generated from the GadToolsBox .gui file:
  
  $ProjectFileName      -- The ProjectFileName from [ProjectDataTags] goes here

@NODE ToDoList "Unfinished business:"

  The following parts of the @{B}GTBTranslator ©@{UB} program still need work:

  1. Re-write the GTBScanner to account for multiple windows/projects in a
     GadToolsBox source file (*.gui).

  2. Complete program documentation (yeah, right!).
  
@ENDNODE

@NODE "TroubleShooting" "TroubleShooting GTBTranslator:"

   First of all, let me state that this section of the help
   system is far from complete.  I've added a lot of error detection
   code to GTBTranslator (this is one of the reasons it's gotten so big),
   but I cannot account for everything that a User's system has installed
   or things that might be missing.  The program has been tested on
   an A4000T with a 68060 50Mhz CPU, & a CyberVision 64D graphics card.

   The program has always been compiled with the SAS-C Compiler V6.5+).  
   I've avoided depending on 3rd-party shared libraries (such as MUI, etc), 
   but there might be some code that still uses older shared 
   Amiga-supplied libraries.  
   
   Verify that your system meets the @{" Requirements " LINK "requirement"}.
    
   Next check the GTBTranslator directory @{" Configuration " LINK "DiskConfig"}.

   Examine the @{" GTBTranslator.info " LINK "ToolTypes"} file & verify 
   the ToolTypes match your needs & file configuration.
   
   Verify that your problem is not a @{" Known Bug " LINK "Bugs"}.
    
   If you have previous version(s) of GTBTranslator, see if they work for you.

   Try running the program from a Shell/CLI & see what error messages the
   program generates.

   Make sure that you have not changed the Icon toolTypes to garbage (you did 
   keep a backup of the icon didn't you?  If not, unarchive the original icon).
      
   If you have SnoopDOS available use it to see what the program is looking
   for that you do not have installed on your system.
   
   If all this does not solve your problem, then send an email to @{" me " LINK "Author"}.   

   See Also, @{" Warranty           " LINK "warranty"} (yeah right).
             @{" Distribution       " LINK "distribution"}

@NODE Bugs "Bugs known to the Author of GTBTranslator:"

  The following bugs are known to the @{" Author: " LINK "Author"}

  1. The Scanner cannot generate multiple Window .gui files completely.

  2. GadToolsBox always adds IDCMP_INTUITICKS, IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS & 
     IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE to the *.gui file it generates, no matter if you
     clear their CheckBoxes or not, so you will have to edit these out of
     the final source file that you generate (sorry).

@NODE distribution "GTBTranslator distribution:"

   @{B}DISTRIBUTION
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~@{UB}
   This software package is @{B}ShareWare@{UB}. It may be put on any
   media which is used for the distribution of ShareWare, like Public
   Domain disk collections, CDROMs or FTP servers.

   In order to ensure the integrity of this software package, distributors
   should use the complete original distribution. The author cannot be held
   responsible if this software has become unusable due to modifications
   of the distribution contents or of the distribution files themselves.
   There is no limit on the costs of the distribution, e.g. for the media,
   like floppy disks, streamer tapes or compact disks, or the process of
   duplicating.  Such limits have been proven to be harmful to the idea of
   shareware, i.e., instead of reducing the price of the
   floppy disk below the limit, the software was simply removed from the
   master disk.

   Although the @{" Author " LINK Author} does not impose any limit on the 
   distribution of this software, he would like to express his personal 
   opinions on this matter:

   * This software package should be made available to everyone free of
     charge whenever it is possible (so they can send me money instead ;)).

   * If you have acquired this software package under normal conditions
     from a Public Domain dealer on a floppy disk at a price higher than
     US $5, then you have definitely paid too much.  Please don't
     support this improper profit making any longer and switch to a
     less expensive source as soon as possible.

@ENDNODE

@NODE startup "Running the system:"
@PREV main

  The GTBTranslator system is invoked by typing the command @{B}GTBTranslator@{UB}
  or by clicking on the GTBTranslator icon.  The main GUI should be self-
  explanatory -- simply enter the two required file names & click on the 
  task button that you wish to have the program perform.

  After you enter your .gui source filename & your .ini destination filename,
  clicking on the Generate C Source button will go through the following
  steps in order to generate your final C-source file:
  
     1. GTBScanner will read & parse the .gui file & produce the .ini file,
        after you have supplied any additional information you require into
        the second GUI Requester for Project Information.
     
     2. gtbGenC() will read the .ini file & the .template file & generate
        the final C-source file, as well as a MakeFile & LocaleFile (if
        you checked them in the GUI).
