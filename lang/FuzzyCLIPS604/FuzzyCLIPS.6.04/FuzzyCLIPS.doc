                          FuzzyCLIPS 6.04 (8.10.96)

*****************************************************************************


                                INTRODUCTION
                               --------------

    FuzzyCLIPS 6.04 is a version of well-known expert system shell CLIPS
(C Language Integrated Production System) developed by NASA.
    The FuzzyCLIPS inference engine includes truth maintenance, dynamic rule
addition, and customizable conflict resolution strategies. FuzzyCLIPS
includes an object-oriented language called COOL (CLIPS Object-Oriented
Language) which is directly integrated with the inference engine.
    FuzzyCLIPS has extensions for representing and manipulating fuzzy facts
and rules. In addition to the CLIPS functionality, FuzzyCLIPS can deal with
exact, fuzzy (or inexact), and combined reasoning, allowing fuzzy and normal
terms to be freely mixed in the rules and facts of an expert system.


                                REQUIREMENTS
                               --------------

FuzzyCLIPS requires to run:
- an Amiga computer or compatible,
- MC68020 or better processor,
- 1MB of free memory,
- 2.5MB of hard disk space,
- mathieeedoubbas.library and mathieeedoubtrans.library libraries.


                                INSTALLATION
                               --------------

    Simply extract 'FuzzyCLIPS604.lha" archive to any place on your hard
disk. FuzzyCLIPS will be placed in its own drawer.


                                    USAGE
                                   -------

    FuzzyCLIPS can be started form Workbench or from Shell and has no
tooltypes or parameters. As FuzzyCLIPS communicates with user through
console window it is advised to use some CON: raplacement which has review
buffer (like KingCON for example).
    Because Amiga version of FuzzyCLIPS does not have built-in editor,
external editor is used. To invoke it use command '(edit <filename>)'. If
you have defined EDITOR variable specified editor will be used, otherwise
FuzzyCLIPS will fall back to standard 'Ed'. To run any AmigaDOS command
from FuzzyCLIPS '(system <command>)' command can be used.
