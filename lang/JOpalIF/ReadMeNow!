                                FOR THE
                      OPALVISION SUPPORT LIBRARIES

                     Version 1.0 - 31 December 1992

                           By Marlin Schwanke

   This archive provides all the required code for the JForth Profesional
programmer to access the support libraries for the OpalVision 24 bit
video/graphics card.  You should find the following listed files included in
the archive:

   OpalLib.j           - Header file for the Opal.Library
   OpalReqLib.j        - Header file for the OpalReq.Library
   Opal_Lib.fd         - Function descriptor file for the Opal.Library
   OpalReq_Lib.fd      - Function descriptor file for the OpalReq.Library
   Opal.f              - Library calls and support words for the Opal.Library
   OpalReq.f           - Library calls and support words for the
                         OpalReq.Library
   JForthDemo.f        - Source code for the demo
   IFF24               - A very mindless demo of the interface
   ReadMeNow!          - The file you are now reading

   To install this file on your system you need to copy the two '.j' files to
a new directory JI:Opal, copy the two '.fd' files to your FD:  directory, and
then move the '.f' files to wherever you would like, perhaps JU:

  To use the code you just need to include the '.f' files.  They will
automatically include the other files as required.  Remember to load the
libraries prior to using them with 'Opal?' or 'OpalReq?'!  Also remember that
all addresses returned by the library functions will be coverted to JForth
relative addresses and all addresses you supply to the library calls should
be JForth Relative as well.  A final note, as with all other AmigaDos
strings, the filenames you provide to the library calls must be '0Strings' (0
terminated C style strings).  For example you might use '0" Filename"' to
introduce a filename into your code.

  The demo is an extremely simple example of JForth<->OpalVision code.  It
will load and display a named file.  I was very lazy and didn't include a
WorkBench interface for it.  You must therefore use it from the CLI.  It is
marginally useful, as it can be included in your AmigaDos scripts, and it
doesn't require the user to click the left mouse button for the script to
continue, as does the 'Show24' that comes with OpalVision.  The syntax is
'IFF24 Filename' to display a picture and just 'IFF24' to turn it back off.
Note that JForth is not required for the demo command to function.

  Please refer to the OpalVision Developer's Kit for additional documentation
on using these libraries.
