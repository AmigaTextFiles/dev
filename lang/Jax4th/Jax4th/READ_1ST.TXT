Files in this distribution
--------------------------
DEFIMAGE.A
C.A.P.E. source code for the default local image of JAX4TH.

DEFIMAGE.JX4
The default local image to be loaded by JAX4TH in the case of the
latter's being invoked from a command line interface without an image
file argument. In later versions, double-clicking <name>.JX4.info will
invoke JAX4TH on the given image.

DEFIMAGE.LNK
Link commands for linking DEFIMAGE.JX4.

DEFIMAGE.MAKE
Amiga script file to make DEFIMAGE.JX4.

DEFIMAGE.WITH
A "with" file for the linking process.

DISTRIB.TXT
This description of the current distribution and restrictions (if any)
on re-distribution by the user.

JAX4TH
Relocatable re-entrant dpANS-2-compliant Forth kernel suitable
for PURE bit protection under AmigaDOS.

JAX4TH.A
C.A.P.E. source code for the re-entrant kernel JAX4TH.

JAX4TH.BUGS
Some bugs from the known bug list.

JAX4TH.I
Includes, macros for JAX4TH.A and DEFIMAGE.A.

JAX4TH.DOC
An informational file which assumes 1) that the reader has
systems programmer familiarity with the Commodore Amiga 500/1000/200,
and 2) that the reader is familiar with Forth, and with the particulars
of the draft proposed ANS Forth promulgated by the ANS X3/X3J14 Technical
Committee for an American National Standard Forth.

JAX4TH.LNK
Linker command file for JAX4TH.

JAX4TH.MAKE
Amiga script file to make JAX4TH.

JAX4TH.WITH

A "with" file for the linking process.

JAX4TH.WORDS
This is a listing with stack diagrams of the words in the FORTH-WORDLIST
and a listing with stack diagrams and explanations of the words in the
IMPLEMENTOR-WORDLIST.

Quickstart Instructions
-----------------------

	1) Make a logical device (e.g., via AmigaDOS ASSIGN) name JX4:

	2) Copy JAX4TH and DEFIMAGE.JX4 to JX4:

	3) Optionally, at the AmigaDOS prompt type

		RESIDENT JX4:JAX4TH

	to make JAX4TH resident

	4) From a NEWCON: (NewShell) window, type

		JAX4TH

	to launch an instance of JAX4TH. You can launch as many
	instances from as many NewShell windows as you like. Type
	INSTANCES in JAX4TH and it will return on the stack the number
	of instances of JAX4TH currently running. DO NOT "RUN" JAX4TH.

	5) BYE exits the current instance of JAX4TH and decrements INSTANCES
	but does not clean up any resources allocated by the programmer: open
	files, allocations via the MEMORY wordlist words, resources allocated
	via direct CALLs to the Amiga operating system, etc. must be cleaned
	up by the program.
