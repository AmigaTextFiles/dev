This  directory contains  some public  include  files  to support  the
foreign language  (C) interface of  SWI-Prolog.  These  files   may be
copied to /usr/include.

The graphical package PCE searches  for these files in this directory,
so they need not be copied to /usr/include to be able to install PCE.

Files:
	SWI-Prolog.h	General include file that defines constants
			and types.  To be included in any C-file that
			contains references to SWI-Prologs foreign
			interface.

			-bI flag of AIX compilers.
