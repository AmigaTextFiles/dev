The Bywater BASIC Interpreter (bwBASIC) implements a large
superset of the ANSI Standard for Minimal BASIC (X3.60-1978) 
and a significant subset of the ANSI Standard for Full 
BASIC (X3.113-1987) in C.

BWBASIC is an original creation of Ted A. Campbell, who stopped
working on it in 1993. Since then it has received contributions 
from other programmers: Jon B. Volkoff, Paul Edwards, 
Howard S. Wulf, Ken Martin and Jon Foster.
