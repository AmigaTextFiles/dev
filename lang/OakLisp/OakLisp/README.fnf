This material was submitted to me on disk by Mike Meyer, who did the
Amiga port.  Thanks Mike!

Because of it's size, it would not fit on a single disk and still leave
room for my normal distribution files.  So I have split it between two
disks, 519 and 520.  Both disks are required.  Note that the lharc program
is provided in the :c directory of this disk for use in extracting the
files from the distributed archives.
