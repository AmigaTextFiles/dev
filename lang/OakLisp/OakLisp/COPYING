		    OAKLISP GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
			      April 1988

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license, but changing it is not allowed.  You may also use this
 wording to make the terms for other programs.

In this document, the term "Oaklisp" refers to the implementation of
Oaklisp written by Kevin Lang and Barak Pearlmutter, and also to the
documentation and language manual that accompany this program.  It
does not refer to the Oaklisp language itself, as computer languages
themselves are outside the domain of copyrights.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of Oaklisp's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each file a valid copyright notice
"Copyright (C) 1988 Barak Pearlmutter and Kevin Lang" (or with
whatever year is appropriate); keep intact the notices on all files
that refer to this License Agreement and to the absence of any
warranty; give any other recipients of the Oaklisp program a copy of
this License Agreement along with the program; and inform such
recipients that they have all the rights described herein.  You may
charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy of Oaklisp or prepare derivative works
of Oaklisp, or any portion therof, which modifications and derivative
works you will own, and you may register your copyright and cause your
own copyright notice to appear on such modifications and derivative
works, but if you copy or distribute these modifications or derivative
works, you must comply with the requirements of paragraph 1 above and
the following additional terms:

    a) cause the modified files (or any added files) to carry
    prominent notices stating that you changed (or created) the files
    and the date of any change (or of creation), along with the
    appropriate copyright notices; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,
    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of Oaklisp or
    any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties
    on terms identical to those contained in this License Agreement
    (except that you may choose to grant more extensive warranty
    protection to some or all third parties, at your option).

    c) if technically feasable, cause it when run in the simplest and
    usual way to print an announcement including a valid copyright
    notice "Copyright (C) 1988 Kevin Lang and Barak Pearlmutter" (or
    with the year that is appropriate), along with any other
    appropriate copyright notices, saying that there is no warranty
    (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
    redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the
    user how to view a copy of this License Agreement.

    d) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
    protection in exchange for a fee.

  3. You may copy and distribute Oaklisp (or a portion or derivative
of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the
terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal shipping
    charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
    source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and
    2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code
for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not
include source code for modules which are standard libraries that
accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs and
that are not themselves derived from Oaklisp.

  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer Oaklisp
except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer Oaklisp
is void and your rights to use Oaklisp under this License agreement
shall be automatically terminated.  However, parties who have received
computer software programs from you with this License Agreement will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
full compliance.

  5. If you wish to incorporate Oaklisp or portions of Oaklisp into
other programs whose distribution conditions are different, you must
contact the authors.

PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE OAKLISP PROGRAM
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL ANY PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE OAKLISP AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH PROGRAMS NOT DISTRIBUTED BY
FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC.) THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY
OTHER PARTY.
