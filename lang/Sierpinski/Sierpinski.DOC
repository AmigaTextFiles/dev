Hi Pascal Freaks !! ( and others... :)

This is a small demo how to use intuition with HighSpeed Pascal.
My Compiler version is rather strange... 1.1 with 2.0 units ??

The manual doesn't clearly explains the Amiga programming with HiSpeed
Pascal,..
All you folks out there with HSPascal sources: MAIL YOUR SOURCES !!
I'm looking for a source generator for GadsToolBox... (JaBa's)
