Short: F2C - Fortran to C Converter for Manx C 5.0

Hi folks,

I  tought  this  might  be  of interest to some of you, and this is why I'm
releasing  it  to  the net.  Look into docs/f2c.1 for a general overview of
how to use this program.

The  shell  script  FC  is  provided to automate the conversion-compilation
process  and  is  currently  just  a  quick  hack that does not pass on any
options.  To compile the FORTRAN file test.f say

	FC test

to  your  Shell  prompt.  This will call the converter, compiler and linker
and  put  the executable in a file "test" in your current directory.  Don't
ask  me  why  one has to link twice with f2c.lib:  All I know is that *not*
doing  it has the linker barf on an undefined "main" symbol.  Another thing
I've  included  is  the  small  library  bsd.lib which contains a couple of
functions  that  came  in handy compiling f2c, like a custom-made mktemp(),
getpid() & the like.  The program and the libraries were compiled using the
large  code/large  data  model  together  with  Manx  IEEE  floating  point
routines.

I  have not yet had any chance to test the program on anything more complex
than  the included test program test.f, so use of this program is of course
at your own risk.

port-specific  bugs.   The  following  is  from  the  original  archive and
