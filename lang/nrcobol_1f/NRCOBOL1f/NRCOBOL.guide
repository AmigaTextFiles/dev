 Why COBOL?
 **********


   To those of you thinking not another new language, COBOL is in fact one
   of the oldest high-level languages, its roots going back to the late
   1950's. Ofcourse there are those of you who already know this but regard
   COBOL as not so much an high-level language, as the original computer
   virus. To these people i say RESPECT the source of the mother tounge. (sic!)

   When so many languages have come and gone (what ever happended to Modulus II,
   and who outside of the Amiga community has heard of 'E;), COBOL (with the most
   source code on the planet, circa 89) has seen in the advent of STRUCTURED,and now
   OBJECT methodologies, its adapted absorbing the latest in Database Management,
   SQL etcetera, and gone on from strength to strength. Indeed as an introduction
   to records there's alot to be said in its favour. So when people say why,
   i say why not?


   This implementation of COBOL is largely ANSI 85 compatable and takes the
   form of MicroSoft(TM) COBOL, with maybe the exception of some stuff in
   ENVIRONMENT DIVISION - SPECIAL-NAMES. And some stuff left over from the days
   when memory was premium and no one had the imagination to contemplate speed.
   see @{"Implemented?" link "Implemented?" 0}

   This would have been bought to you sooner, if it weren't for the moron, in
   the bedsit downstairs, with something of an habit!! which in lean times
   even extend to a fixation with gas. 'would you adam n eve it'.

   WARNING dope really @&*$% you up! something to do with short term memory
   going to pot!


STOP THE PRESS!.

 Installation
 ************


   Nothing could be simpiler, Just copy the runtime program 'RUNCOB'
   anywhere in your path, that's ram: c: or in the same directory as the
   created .INT files.

   Files with the extension .INT are created as a result of successfully
   running NRCOBOL ..see @{"Usage" link "Usage" 0}

   There are several ToolTypes which you'll need to tailor to suite your
   system. To access these single click on the icon of NRCOBOL, then select
   information from the sysem menu to find the following:

   TEXTEDITOR=C:ed
       edit cobol source file.

   TEXTVIEWER=sys:utilities/multiview
       view list / debug files, if not set then the editor set for TEXTEDITOR
       is used.

   SOURCEDIR=
       where cobol source files are to found by NRCOBOL's requester
   RUNCOBDIR=
       where runcob prog is to be found, default ram: c: or current directory
       Note: the absence of a space after the '=' and in the case of SOURCEDIR
       and RUNCOBDIR if a directory is stated it should end with ':' or '/'

   To avoid those moments of head scratching, you are advised to use ABSOLUTE
   path names.  see.. @{" Thank You " link "Thank-you!" 0}


   If you are one the few who haven't yet discovered 'UrouHack' by @{"Tinic Urou" link "UrouAuthor" 0}
   then i urge you to get hold of a copy aminet util/wb. This prog redefines
   the system gadgets to very impressive xen like gadgets and leaves the rest
   of the system looking like MUI, and then some, without slowing the system
   down. If that's not reason enough, it also improves the appearence of this
   prog :)

 Usage
 *****


   After creating your cobol source file with your favourite text editor,
   and saving it with the .COB extention you have a choise of evoking the
   compiler from @{b}CLI/shell@{ub} or @{b}Workbench@{ub}.

   From @{b}CLI/SHELL@{ub}

     NRCOBOL <sourcefile>.(COB | CBL) [-l] [-d] [-e] [-r]

   where the optional flags:

     -l   produces a simple listing  <sourcefile>.LST
     -d   produces a debug  listing  <sourcefile>.DBG
     -e   errors terminate compilation.       [wildcard option]
     -r   Report file '.NRCOBOL.report' OFF.  [wildcard option]

   The wildcard pattern match option will now recognize #?.(cob|cbl)

   A successfull compilation produces <sourcefile>.INT
   to run type...  RUNCOB <sourcefile>.INT




   From @{b}Workbench@{ub}

     Use of the program from workbench is self explanatory, but for those
     too dim.

   The Editor option allows one to view sourcefile.COB, sourcefile.LST or
   sourcefile.DBG. The file editor defaults to 'ED' as supplied in sys:c.
   You can however, set TEXTEDITOR in NRCOBOL's icon to launch your favourite
   editor. eg  TEXTEDITOR=c:ced . Note no space between = and editor named.
   see.. @{" Installation " link "Installation" 0}


   The menu options allow:

     1, A window on a custom screen, ie high resolution non interlace or
        a window on the current public screen.
     2, The date check on debug/listing files can to be disabled, 
        ie, open the last debug/listing file related to current cobol source file,
        regardless of the date on the source file.
     3, Terminal runtime check on SIZE ERROR condition.
     4, ditto for OVERFLOW ERROR.
     5, Remembers the current directory, the next time you use NRCOBOL.
     6, switch zone check from error to non terminal warnings

   In both cases an ICON is produced named <sourcefile>.INT
   to execute just double click.


   The debug option produces a file which you may find useful in locating
   runtime errors, which sadly is normal for cobol. Usually this is to do
   with uninitialised variables, you know, finding alpha data in a numeric
   field.


   Runtime errors usually return a value in the form 0x????, where 0x???? is an
   offset into the data space allocated in the Data Division. Stradling values,
   ie value between offset values indicates a postion within a table,
   (a subsripted identifier).


   For those of you looking to automate compilation, possibly using
   Arexx, the following codes are now returned by NRCOBOL:

      8000  nrcobol ?   called
      8001  filename    error
      8002  compilation error
      8003  savefile    error (.int or T:debug_) file
      8004  identifier  limits
      8005  too many files found with wildcard.  [500 max]
      1002  memory      error

    @{b}The Syntax of the COBOL Language@{ub}


    At the momment COBOL has strict rules on where different parts of the program
    should be, a legacy of the days of coding sheets. So lets start with the ruler.

         1         2         3         4         5         6         7

    The seventh column is reserved for several
    special purposes. These are: @{b}*  /  -  D  $@{ub}


    '@{b}*@{ub}': When the 7th column contains an '*' , the entire line is taken
    to be a comment.


    '@{b}/@{ub}': A '/' in the 7th column behaves in much the same way as
    an asterisk, in that the entire line is taken to be a comment. The
    only difference is that in the compiler listing [if one is produced]
    there will be a page break before the comment is printed. This can be
    used to enhance the readability of the source listing.
    See examples.


    '@{b}-@{ub}': When the 7th column contains a '-', the line is taken to be a
    continuation of the previous line.
    See examples.


    '@{b}D@{ub}': The letter 'D' in the 7th column flags the line as a debugging line.
    The line will be conditionally compiled for debugging.  If the
    source-computer paragraph has the phrase WITH DEBUGGING MODE, the line
    will be compiled. This feaure is used by some compilers to provide a
    program trace. @{"See example" link "example" 0}.


    '@{b}$@{ub}': this is used signel the use of a limited set of compiler directives:

         $IF constant-name [NOT] DEFINED
         $IF constant-name [NOT] < > = literal

         $ELSE
         $END
         $EJECT          ...form feeds listing.

         $SET CONSTANT literal  @{"See example" link "example" 0}.
         alternately a constant can be defined as level 78 literal

    Any COBOL program is composed of exactly four divisions:
    identification, environment, data and procedure. These divisions
    appear explicitely in the COBOL source in the form:


	division name  DIVISION.


    Each division may be further subdivided into sections and paragraphs.
    For further information, select from the following list of divisions:


      @{" The IDENTIFICATION Division " link "IDENTIFICATION" 0}
      @{" The ENVIRONMENT division    " link "ENVIRONMENT" 0}
      @{" The DATA division           " link "DATA" 0}

 If you have a problem remembering the exact order in which the divisions
 must appear in the COBOL source file, try the mneumonic: "I Enjoy Data

@node IDENTIFICATION
@title "IDENTIFICATION"
 The IDENTIFICATION Division
 ***************************


    The identification division provides information about the program. Of
    this information, only the name of the program, specified in the
    PROGRAM-ID paragraph, is essential.

       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. program-name.

       [INSTALLATION. comment]
       [DATE-WRITTEN. comment]
       [DATE-COMPILED. comment]
       [SECURITY. comment]


    The program name is just a user-defined name. It doesn't seem to have
    much of a use, and therefore some authors recommend that if at all
    possible [given OS constraints], the program name should be chosen to
    equal the name of the source file.

    The compilation date paragraph contains the
    date of the most recent compilation.

    Supposedly some COBOL compilers, VAX-COBOL and IBM COBOL/2 (thanks ron) will
    automatically update the comment in this paragraph each time the
    program is re-compiled, but why?

    A user-defined name is a sequence of
    characters satisfying the following conditions:


    The length of a user-defined name cannot exceed 30 characters.

     -  A user defined name can contain letters, digits, or the hyphen.
     -  A user-defined name cannot begin with a hyphen.
     -  A user-defined name must contain at least one letter.

    developement and execution of the given program.

    Information as to the character set assumed throughout the

  @{bold "1.0f"}  March  99    -  Qualified identifiers, ie 'ident IN record OF record' is now
                        implemented. This means the really useful feature CORRESPONDING
                        for MOVE, ADD and SUBTRACT now works. Qualified identifiers
                        for 'nested files' is pending.

                        Improved memory management now means NRCOBOL release
                        memory between compilation. All the better for wildcards :)

                        Report file '.NRCOBOL.report' generated when the wildcard option
                        is used. Use -r flag to suppresse file.

                        The following have been rewritten to meet Ansi 85:
                        ADD, COMPUTE, DISPLAY, DIVIDE, EVALUATE, GO, INITIALIZE,
                        INSPECT (almost !), MOVE, MULTIPLY, PERFORM, SEARCH, SET, STRING,
                        SUBTRACT and UNSTRING.

                        Improvements have been made to complex and abreviated conditions.

                        Level 78 style constants have been expanded to simple integer
                        arithmetics, the operators are + - / * ,no presidence, no brackets.
                        integers greater than  4294967295, 2^32 -1 , are truncated, just
                        like microFocus(tm).

                        A limited subset of compiler directives have been implemented.
                        ...see  @{" Basics " link "OK" 0}

                        please note stack requirements are now a little higher this
                        largely to deal with the worst case of a rather neat O(logn),
                        but memory hungry recursive division routine.

                        for any really silly coders out there, the complex form of the
                        continuation has been implemented. This allows even keywords to be
                        interupted, provided the next line starts with an hyphen.

                        NRCOBOL will now compile source code prepared on a PC without the
                        need for conversion via crossdos etc.

                        upgraded from OS 2.4 to OS 3.0, just so i could get exec's CreatePool()
                        to compile.


                        On the GUI front, NRCOBOL will now remember where it was, when last
                        closed.

                        There is also a menu flag to remember the current dir, this info is
                        recorded in a small file 'NRCOBOL.pref' in the S directory, when
                        the program is closed.

                        You can also switch off zone check. I am told this makes the language
                        more friendly, personaly i think it allows sloppy habits. SCM  X)
                        see.. @{" Thank You " link "Thank-you!" 0}

                        The overflow error condition is now optioned.

                        Finally, for those in the know the ENTRY satatement has been implemented.
                        This microFocus(tm) feature allows library like calls to resident
                        programs.   ....see @{" ENTRY " link "ENTRY" 0}

   program. SHoWING?? Now how about some avi/mov files AF/CUCD/ANOther?


   Thanks to Markus Hillenbrand  @{"Author" LINK AUTHOR} for the excellent GUICreator,
   which was used to create (after much tweeking) the newface of NRCOBOL.
   Please note the difference in compilation speeds is due solely to the use
   of gadtools ;(


   Its amazing the people we take for granted, like that bloke @{" Tinic Urou " link "UrouAuthor" 0}
   who wrote that delicious piece of eye candy called 'UrouHack', if you havent
   installed it yet what are you waiting for.


   Thanks also to those unknown warriors who gave their all to bring us the
   freedom to program in assembler.. the authors of A68K and BLINK
   without which.....  RESPECT!

 Sorry!

   My apologies to anyone who tried and failed to make contact at my old email
   address. At around  18th september my account was suddenly and without warning
   terminated. Imagine my suprise to find i no longer exist, to find my account fini,
   to find this parrot's dead. No longer on this mortal coil, no longer
   with us, gone to software heaven, frankly needing more than a magnetic medium
   to get in touch with our dearly departed data :((  KO'ed at HQ by HO.


   This ment not only the loss of pending email, but records on all contacts made
   to date. If that wasn't bad enough, i had just, that week, been published on the
   CDROM of the CU Amiga magazine (CUCD15), which ment all those potential contacts
   are now lost.


   Anyway, due to an act of devine intervention, (new JAVA course) i am now back on
   line. Existing from day to day, suddenly aware of my own mortality, unsure of the
   integrity of the system, but gradualy rekindling my trust... bare with me.
   Willing to forgive but never forget!


   If you were one of those who tried and failed, ...do call again y'all :*)
