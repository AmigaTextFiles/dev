These files sent by Bertuccio Saul allow CED to interact with NrCobol.

It requires a bit of fine tuning in the following areas to get started:

1. open either Cobol_English.Rexx or Cobol_Italiano.Rexx
   change the paths to reflect where nrcobol and runcob, are stored. lines 39,40

2. open Editor.Txt using an editor where you'll find,

   Lavoro:WordProcessor/CygnusED/CED SETTINGS=Lavoro:Programmazione/Cobol/CedMacros PORTNAME=COBOL

   change the paths to reflect:

   a/ whereCED is stored
   b/ where Cobol_English.Rexx,Cobol_Italiano.Rexx are stored.

   IMPORTANT! the Cobol_English.Rexx,Cobol_Italiano.Rexx macros require CED to
   be launched with a port name of 'COBOL', so leave the PORTNAME=COBOL setting.

   when done save, then use the EDITOR.TXT icon (renamed if you whish) to luanch
   CED.
