GoldED support isn't here yet, although i have received emails from a few
brave souls embarking on this project. Included are list of all the keywords
KEYWORDS to date.

  keywords.all  ; contains all in order, useful for a quick binary search
  keywords.main ; contains just the key statement suported
  keywords.rest ; the rest


I am willing to help, so far as i am able, with basic lexicon analysis of cobol
source. Actual parsing would be too much like writting a compiler, and as we all
know, nobody in their right mind would write a compiler for such a verbose 
language ;)


just drop me line...
