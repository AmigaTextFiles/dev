	This is an update for FPC Pascal to version 0.995d.
	It's an complete package, all you need is in this archive.
	Well besides the docs, if you need them get fpcrefdoc.lha.


        So what's new?

        A nasty bug in the compiler, illegal read is fixed so we hope
   	no more crashes.

	There are some changes and bugfixes to the amiga units.
 	First before you compile any amigaunit make up your mind
	if you like to have overlayfunctions for Pchar<>Strings.

	The default is to have overlayfunctions but if you doesn't like
	the idea change the define in amigainc/amigaoverlays.inc.

	There are also a few utilunits and the demos are rewriten to
	use the new units. 

	You also have version 2.9.1 of as, ld and strip here plus
	ixemul.library.

	I have also included the examples from the doc of FPC, it's
	example for crt, dos, object and a few other. One warning all
	examples doesn't work with the current Amiga version.

	If the compiler complaines that it can't find the includes
	(the ones in inc/) just copy them to units and the compiler
	will be happy.

	
	
	The future:

	When we are sure that FPC 1.0 is stable and that there are
	no bugs left we will start to make an Amiga version of 1.0.
	That means an Delphi clone for Amiga.
