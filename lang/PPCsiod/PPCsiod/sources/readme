These are the sources of siod. If you compile them don't use the stack
extend option becouse isn't compatible with the garbage collection used by
Siod. Requires also the standard model of memory.
This version of siod is compiled with Sas 6.2 using the options:
                PARM=r STRMER OPT OPTTIME

If you find bugs, fix them.
