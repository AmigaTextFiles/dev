Note
----

I wrote this ages ago. The code is old an badly implemented, and there are
many things I still want add. This has been sitting and rotting on my HD
for ages, so I've basically cleaned it up and uploaded it for Aminet.

Please feel free to e-mail me about this project, but don't expect regular
updates, or any at all for that matter. I may or may not work on this
some more :)

                        
1. What is Bonk?
----------------

Bonk is a new programming language with no useful applications at all. Bonk
is for all those people who enjoy languages like "False" and "Brainf**k".

I wont explain in detail here how to program in bonk, but look at the
examples and read "bonk_spec.txt".

I originally wrote a bonk interpreter in Amiga E, but it just grew some
bizarre bugs, so I started again from scratch in assembler. The assembler
is not only more stable, but much faster..


2. How to use bonk
------------------

Once you have written your program, just type:

bonk <sourcefilename>

And away it goes. If you reckon your program will need more than 4096 bytes
of stack (hehehe yeah right), you can specify a larger one like this:

bonk bigstack.bnk STACK=16384

Remember that every push onto the stack takes 4 bytes, no matter what you
push.


3. Contact me
-------------

Send me mail! Do you hate it? Do you like it? Do you want to talk about
programming in general? Do you like The Offspring/Foo Fighters/Deftones/
Korn/Nirvana/Pulkas/Therapy? Mail me:

mrtickle@amiga4k.ndo.co.uk

I also want to hear from people interested in writing Bonk interpreters
for other platforms. I would love to see PC/Mac/Unix versions of Bonk.



4. Thanks
---------

Big thanks to Merko for his excellent morse code example! (examples/morse.bnk)

I must say thankyou to Wouter van Oortmerssen, not only for inventing Amiga
E (which Bonk was originally written in), but also for his enthusiasm for
experimenting and playing with programming languages in general which has got
me interested too.
