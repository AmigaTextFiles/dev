This is CLISP, a Common Lisp implementation.


What is LISP?
-------------

LISP is a programming language. It was invented by J. McCarthy in 1959.
There have been many dialects of it, but nowadays LISP has been standardized
and wide-spread due to the industrial standard COMMON LISP. There are
applications in the domains of symbolic knowledge processing (AI), numerical
mathematics (MACLISP yielded numerical code as good as FORTRAN), and
widely used programs like editors (EMACS) and CAD (AUTOCAD).
There is an introduction to the language:

  Sheila Hughes: Lisp. Pitman Publishing Limited, London 1986.
  107 pages.

After a while wou will need the standard text containing the language
definition:

  Guy L. Steele Jr.: Common Lisp - The Language. Digital Press.
  1. edition 1984, 465 pages.
  2. edition 1990, 1032 pages.

This book is available in HTML form via FTP from
  ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/lisp/doc/cltl/cltl_ht.tgz  and
  ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de:/pub/lisp/CLtL2/cltl_ht.tgz
and can be viewed through WWW under
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html or
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/cltl2.html .

LISP is run in an interactive environment. You input forms, and they will be
evaluated at once. Thus you can inspect variables, call functions with given
arguments or define your own functions.

      README             this text
      SUMMARY            short description of CLISP
      ANNOUNCE           announcement
      NEWS               list of modifications since the last version
      COPYRIGHT          copyright notice
      GNU-GPL            free software license
      config.lsp         site-dependent configuration
      timezone.lsp       site-dependent time zone

and - to your convenience, if you like reading source -

      *.lsp              the source of lispinit.mem
      *.fas              the same files, already compiled


Hardware requirements:
----------------------

This Amiga version of CLISP requires at least 1.5MB RAM. The version called
CLISP-LOW runs on machines with no memory outside the 24 bit addressable
range: on 68000, A2620, A2630. The version called CLISP-HIGH runs in memory
that is 27 bit addressable (address range #x00000000 to #x07FFFFFF), but
only on 68020/030/040(/60?) CPU: on A3000 and A4000 without Zorro-III memory
boards. The version called CLISP-00 runs on 68000/010 CPU only but is faster
than CLISP-LOW. The version called CLISP-WIDE uses 64 bit integers and runs
in any memory on 68020 or better CPU: on A4000 using VMM. The overhead for
64 bit integers cause CLISP-WIDE to be slower than CLISP-HIGH.


Software requirements:
----------------------

This version of CLISP requires OS 2.04 (V37) or newer.


Installation:
-------------

Edit the contents of config.lsp appropriately for your site,
especially the definitions of short-site-name and long-site-name.
You may also want to edit the time zone definition at the end of
timezone.lsp.
Then start

         lisp.run -M lispinit.mem

When the LISP prompt

      > _

appears, type

        (compile-file "config")
        (load "config")

and - in case you modified timezone.lsp -

        (compile-file "timezone")
        (load "timezone")

and then

        (saveinitmem)

to overwrite the file lispinit.mem with your configuration. Then

        (exit)

Then create a directory, and put the executable and the memory image there.



Note:
-----

You can start CLISP from Workbench(tm). The following Tooltypes are
recognized in the Tool Icon:

   WINDOW=<window or pipe specification>
   ARGS=<CLI-like arguments>

For example,

   WINDOW=CON:0/11/640/200/CLISP-Listener/CLOSE
   ARGS=-M lispinit.mem


When you encounter problems:
----------------------------

After errors, you are in the debugger:

     1. Break> _

You can evaluate forms, as usual. Furthermore:

     Help
               calles help
     Abort     or
     Unwind
               climbs up to next higher input loop
     Backtrace
               shows the contents of the stack, helpful for debugging

And you can look at the values of the variables of the functions where the
error occurred.

On bigger problems, e.g. "guru"s, please send a description of the error
and how to produce it reliably to the authors or the maintainer. Please
accompany it with the CLISP version, which you get by calling
(lisp-implementation-version).


Mailing List:
-------------

There is a mailing list for users of CLISP. It is the proper forum for
questions about CLISP, installation problems, bug reports, application
packages etc.

For information about the list and how to subscribe it, send mail to
listserv@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de, with the two lines
          help
          information clisp-list
in the message body.
