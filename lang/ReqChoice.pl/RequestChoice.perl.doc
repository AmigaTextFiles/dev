with your Amiga perl programs.  Tested on my Amithlon under Amiga OS 3.9.


ami_request_choice.pl shows you how to build and use an Amiga Request Choice
Gadget from keyboard input that can work with your Amiga perl programs.  Tested
on my Amithlon under Amiga OS 3.9.

There may be other and better ways to do this, but this is the one I was able
to get to work.

Remember - this is Amiga specific, for cross platform perl programs you will
have to figure out some other way to open a gui file requestor.
