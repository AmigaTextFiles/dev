   Welcome to Amiga-Pascal,

   after studying a while at university, I thought that I should do some
   practice work instead of all that theory there. That's why I started
   programming a Pascal-Compiler (that's what we're supposed to do here
   anyway). I know that there are already quite a few Pascal-Compiler
   available for the AMIGA, but since competition is good for the 
   consumer, I entered this competition (I hope that this will spur on
   the other programmer of Pascal-Compiler). I've written this Pascal-
   Compiler in KICK-PASCAL (seems like the old problem with the hen and
   the egg). KICK-PASCAL is a really good compiler, with a lot of 
   functions in order to make it userfriendly, but unfortunately it does
   not create optimized code. That's the actual reason for making this
   compiler. For little projects it's quite unnecessary to have a 
   startup-code with over 4 KB (opening the dos.library is all you need).
   I won't go into detail how to program PASCAL. If you'd like to know,
   which functions and procedures this Compiler understands then please
   look at the example-file. 

   Here's a list with all the keywords: PROGRAM, VAR, INTEGER, BEGIN, 
   END, WHILE, DO BEGIN, :=, +,-, *, /. Be careful with divisions, since
   there is no check if it's a division by zero (Guru's awaiting you).

   If you'd like to compile a program of your own or the example file,
   you have to do the following things. First of all, you have to 
   translate the pascal-code into assembler, then the object-code must
   be created and then it has to be linked. All necessary files are in 
   this directory.

   If you'd like to compile the example-file, you'd have to key in:

   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   + Amiga-Pascal Examples/Example1       (pascal->assembler)      +
   + A68k Examples/Example1.s             (assembler->object-code) +
   + BLINK Examples/Example1.o TO Examples/Example.exe             +
   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Please notify, if you're interested in future versions of this 
   program. Then I'll introduce a workbench interface, the complete 
   range of standard-pascal, an editor, better docs etc.

   See you,

   Danny
