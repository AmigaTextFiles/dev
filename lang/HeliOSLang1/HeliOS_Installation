The HeliOS demo archives
************************

The HeliOS demo comes as four "lha" archive files which unpack to
directories as follows:

"HeliOSLang1.lha"  unpacks to "HeliOS_Demo_Disk1"
"HeliOSLang2.lha"  unpacks to "HeliOS_Demo_Disk2"
"HeliOSLang3.lha"  unpacks to "HeliOS_Demo_Disk3"
"HeliOSLang4.lha"  unpacks to "HeliOS_Demo_Disk4"

These four directories provide the contents of the four disks which
normally constitute the full HeliOS distribution disk set.

You need all four archives for the full HeliOS system, which includes
demo source code, many fully functional program examples, several
detailed tutorials and extensive reference documentation.


******************************************************************
Installation of HeliOS onto hard disk from the demo "lha" archives
******************************************************************

Installation of HeliOS onto hard disk is highly recommended if you
wish to try all the demos and tutorials supplied, and is virtually
essential for serious use of the software.

There are two methods by which you can install HeliOS onto hard disk:

1. First transferring the contents of the archives onto floppy disks,
   and then using the hard disk installer supplied on Disk 1.

2. Manually transferring all files to hard disk and then setting up an
   assign to "HeliOS:".

Note that you CAN indeed run HeliOS from floppy disk (even on a Workbench
1.2 A500 if you wish!) but this is not very easy or practical.  Ideally
HeliOS requires access to all its support files, and comes already set up
for easy access to all components of the HeliOS system installed in one
directory with an assigned name of "HeliOS:".

Running from multiple floppies would be possible, but would require manual
modification of various paths within the HeliOS configuration files.  If
you choose to do this please refer first to the extensive documentation
on installation and setup supplied within the demo archives.


**********************************************************************
Method 1 - Installation onto hard disk using intermediate floppy disks
**********************************************************************

The HeliOS language is normally distributed on four floppy disks, with
an automated hard disk installation program on the first disk.

In fact the HeliOS main Editor/Interpreter/Compiler can be run simply
by executing a single executable file named "HeliOS_int" which is on
the first disk of the set of four.  However, running this executable
without all the support files is not recommended because all the help
and source code files and paths will not be correctly established.

You can easily perform a full installation of HeliOS from the four
archive files, listed above, which contain archived images of the four
HeliOS distribution floppy disks.

You first need to format four floppy disks, and then copy the expanded
contents of the archives onto the disks as follows:

Copy "HeliOS_Demo_Disk1" contents onto the first disk and name it "HeliOS"
Copy "HeliOS_Demo_Disk2" contents onto the second disk and name it "HeliOS2"
Copy "HeliOS_Demo_Disk3" contents onto the third disk and name it "HeliOS3"
Copy "HeliOS_Demo_Disk4" contents onto the fourth disk and name it "HeliOS4"

Note:  1. The correct naming of the disks is important if you wish to use the
          HeliOS HD Installer supplied.

       2. Copy the CONTENTS of the unarchived "Demo_Disk" directories to
          the root directory of the floppies: do NOT copy the "Demo_Disk"
          directories themselves.

Once you have rebuilt the four disks you can install HeliOS on your
hard drive using the HD Installer and instructions on the first disk.


******************************
Method 2 - Manual installation
******************************

This method is even easier than the first, and may be performed as
follows:

1. Create a directory called "HeliOS" on your hard disk.

2. Create an ASSIGN to "HeliOS:" in your "User-startup" file, using
   a line something like this:

   Assign HeliOS: MyHardDisk:HeliOS

3. Extract all files and directories from the four archives listed above,
   copying everything into the "HeliOS" directory on your hard disk and
   preserving all file names, directory names, paths etc.

Note:  1. Copy the CONTENTS of the unarchived "Demo_Disk" directories to
          the "HeliOS" directory you created on your hard disk: do NOT
          copy the "Demo_Disk" directories themselves.

4. Reboot your computer and start HeliOS by running the main executable
   "HeliOS_int" from within the "HeliOS" directory on your hard drive.
