Afilereg.pl by Bonnie Dalzell is FREEWARE

Afilereq.pl allows you to use an Amiga File Requestor with your
perl programs. It needs the binary program BatchRequester by Christoph 
Teuber to be installed. Tested on my Amithlon under Amiga OS 3.9.

There may be other and better ways to do this, but this is the one I 
was able to get to work.

Remember - this is Amiga specific, for cross platform perl programs you will have to figure
out some other way to open a gui file requestor.
