About Secal demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This package is a demo version of a new programming language and
development system called Secal. The main feature of the language is that
it integrates the assembly and the higher level (C kind) programming
elements into one environment offering a new set of tools to the
programmers. The syntax of the language is simple and programmer-friendly.
Integrated link instructions handle the object and link library files,
which might even be created in a different language. The Amiga extension
realized as a link library contains effective and system-friendly
solutions for many important basic tasks that arise during the programming
of the Amiga (double buffered screen (under OS2 too!) and sprite handling,
animation, sound and music playing, chunky graphics, etc.).


Copyright notice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Secal demonstration archive and all files it contains are copyright
(c) 1997 TDS Development. All rights reserved. These files may not be
distributed in any form other than this archive. Distribution of modified
files is prohibited, including the distribution of files that were created
using the link libraries.


The demo version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This demo can be used directly with the directory structure contained
in the archive. For perfect operation the SECAL: assignment should point to
the main directory, and the SECAL:C directory should be added to the search
path of the system. These are taken care of by the provided Prepare script.

A 68000 processor is sufficient for the operation. A minimum of 1M memory
and OS 2.04 are required, while a harddisk and more memory are strongly
recommended.

All save functions were removed from this demo version, and also the length
of the compilable sources is limited. Instead of documentation only a
brief listing of the instruction set and the extension functions were
provided.


The complete product
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The program comes on two install disks with a 120 page manual (see
picture). The system requirements are the same as for the demo version. The
product can be installed to harddisk or to floppy disks. The package also
includes all the utilities that were removed from this demo.

You can find reviews about the product in a few magazines (e.g. Amiga
Format, issue April: 90%, Amiga Gold).
