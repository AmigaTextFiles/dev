Wierd
-----
This archive includes a Mac OS X binary of the Wierd programming language.
Wierd is one of the strangest languages that have ever been constructed and
consists of only two instructions: a whitespace and a non-whitespace. There
are two sample files which work flawlessly with the Mac OS X version and two 
other documents by the creator himself.

If you search the Internet for strange programming language you'll find a
lot of them. Nobody expects you to write applications in Wierd but you may
write a program, show it to your friends and then open the source code.

Wierd is a terminal application meaning that it doesn't use the mouse etc. .
Write your Wierd program in your favorite text editor and then call Wierd:

./wierd <filename>

I would recommend using the .w extension for Wierd programs.
