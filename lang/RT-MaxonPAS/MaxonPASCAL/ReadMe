  Greetings fly to: Janosh, Nico Francois, dopW... .

  History: V0.03: - first version for FD / PD / FW
  ~~~~~~~~        - last version from Janosh (OS1.3)

           V0.04: - first version for V38.1194
                    (new the little LED on RTFileRequester if loading)
                  - MultiSelect-Filerequester
                  - some shortes routines for FileRequester...
                                       ...
           V0.05: - needn`t all units from V0.04
                  - OS2 Test is now in UNIT: Reqtools5
                    (not so much hunks in .exe)

           V0.06: - needs only Unit INTUITION...
                  - you must check for yourself if OS2 or not
                    and you must open the reqtools.library first
                    in your program.
                    (Some little and simple functions in UNIT)

                     Why: 1) If a program should use the Reqtools NOT
                             from beginning, like my ZMore.

                          2) I want not use the "Halt"-Command of
                             KP/MP3 and for that reason please use the
                             two routines on top of the RTDemoV0.06.p.


   Have Fun PackMAN.
