This directory contains scripts that can be used in an AmigaDOS based
environment to take care of initialization and environment settings
for the Gofer interpreter and compiler:

  Gofer
    starts up the command line version of Small Gofer with a
    particular prelude and initial command line argument settings.

    Template: A0,A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A9,PRELUDE/K

    Example:

        Gofer prelude=simple myprog.gs

    If no prelude is given, the standard.prelude will be used.

  RGofer
    as Gofer, but starts Regular Gofer instead.

  (As distributed, the Gofer script - but not RGofer - envokes
   the gofer interpreter with the +. option. This looks better
   if gofer is run from inside GNU emacs (see the gofer.el file)

   Small Gofer is small enough to run comfortably inside emacs
   on a machine with about 2.5-3 megabytes free before starting emacs
   and gofer.)

  GofC, RGofC
    Runs the Small Gofer and Regular Gofer compilers.

    Template: A0,A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A9,PRELUDE/K

  GofSC, RGofSC
    Compile and link the generated C source.

    Template: file/A,opt/K

    where opt turns on the SAS/C optimizer.

The c/ directory of this distribution contains a program called
gofsplit that can be used to cut a generated C source into smaller
pieces. This is useful if SAS/C cannot compile it in one piece.

The scripts will need editing to reflect your choice of setup. If
you don't change the {...}/Gofer/ directory subtree, you will only
have to change the line

    set ROOT sys:lib/gofer

to reflect where you copied the directory.
