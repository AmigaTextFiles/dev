Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~
AFORTH  is  a shareware product.  This means that you are free to
use  it for trial purposes only and you may freely pass copies on
to  your  friends  and  colleagues.   However, if you find AFORTH
useful  and  intend  to continue using it, you must register your
copy.   To do this, either print out and fill in the registration
form  provided  (Type  'TYPE  >PRT:   REGISTER.DOC'  from the CLI
prompt  or  use any other preferred method), or write the details
in  a  letter,  enclose  a  cheque  for £30.00 and post it to the
following address:

                             AFORTH
                           Stratagem4,
                      125 Broadview Avenue
                             Rainham
                           Gillingham

                             ME8 9JD

For your money, you will receive the following benefits:

1)  the   latest  registered  version  of  AFORTH,   without  the
    registration encouragement screen;
2)  access   to   bulletins   detailing   upgrades,    fixes  and
    enhancements,  which may only be available in registered user
    copies;
3)  access to support from the author;
4)  upgrades at nominal, or reduced, rates;
5)  preferential distribution of new product releases.

Please  remember  that  if  you  use  this  product then you must
register as a user.

Nominal   rates   should  be  interpreted  as  'media  cost  plus
handling'.   Reduced rates should be interpreted as a 'percentage
of the registration fee in force at the time'.  Such charges will
only  be  made  when  a  major  enhancement  or  upgrade has been
undertaken.   You  will of course receive advance notification of
such charges, and are in no way obligated to purchase.
