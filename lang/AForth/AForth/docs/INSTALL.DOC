INSTALLATION AND GETTING STARTED
--------------------------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installation  is a very straightforward process.  All you need to
do  is  copy AFORTH to any directory you deem fit for the purpose
and it is immediately available for use.

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AFORTH  may  be  run from the CLI or the Workbench.

Workbench:  double click on the AFORTH icon.

CLI:  CD to the installed directory and type AFORTH<return>.

After  both  of these operations you will be placed in the AFORTH
interactive  environment, now would be a good time to consult the
included document UsingAFORTH.doc.
