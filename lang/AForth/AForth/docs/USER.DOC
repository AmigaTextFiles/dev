AFORTH.   Thanks  are  also  due  to  Lynn  for her patience, and
Commodore Amiga for providing an excellent computer.


INTRODUCTION
============

Overview
~~~~~~~~
AFORTH is an implementation of the FORTH programming language for
the  Commodore  Amiga,  it  adheres  very closely to the FORTH-79
standard as defined by the FORTH Standards Team.


What Is Shareware?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Shareware  distribution  gives  users  a  chance  to try software
before  buying  it.   If you try a Shareware program and continue
using  it,  you  are  expected  to register.  Individual programs
differ on details, some request registration while others require
it,  some  specify a maximum trial period.  With registration you
get anything from the simple right to continue using the software
to an updated program with printed manual.

Copyright  laws  apply to both Shareware and commercial software,
and  the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
exceptions  as  stated below.  Shareware authors are accomplished
programmers,  just  like commercial authors, and the programs are
of  comparable  quality.  (In both cases, there are good programs
and   bad  ones!)  The  main  difference  is  in  the  method  of
distribution.   The  author specifically grants the right to copy
and  distribute  the  software,  either to all and sundry or to a
specific  group.   For  example,  some  authors  require  written
permission  before  a  commercial  disk  vendor  may  copy  their
Shareware.

Shareware  is a distribution method, not a type of software.  You
should find software that suits your needs and pocket, whether it
is  commercial  or Shareware.  The Shareware system makes fitting
your  needs  easier,  because  you  can  try  before you buy, and
because  the overhead is low, prices are also low.  Shareware has
the ultimate money-back guarantee - if you don't use the product,
you don't pay for it.

Disclaimer
~~~~~~~~~~
Users of AFORTH must accept this disclaimer of warranty:

"AFORTH  is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all warranties,
expressed   or   implied,   including,  without  limitation,  the
warranties  of  merchantability  and  of fitness for any purpose.
The   author   assumes   no  liability  for  damages,  direct  or
consequential, which may result from the use of AFORTH."

Terms And Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AFORTH  is  a "Shareware program" and is provided at no charge to
the  user  for  evaluation.   Feel  free  to  share  it with your
friends,  but  please  do  not give it away altered or as part of
another  system.   The essence of "user-supported" software is to
provide  personal  computer  users  with quality software without
high  prices,  and  yet  to  provide incentive for programmers to
continue  to  develop  new  products.   If  you find this program
useful  and  find  that  you are using AFORTH and continue to use
AFORTH   after  a  reasonable  trial  period,  you  must  make  a
registration   payment  of  £30.00  to  Stratagem4.   The  £30.00
registration  fee  will  license  one  copy  for  use  on any one
computer at any one time.  You must treat this software just like
a  book.   An  example  is  that this software may be used by any
number  of  people  and  may  be  freely  moved from one computer
location  to  another,  so  long as there is no possibility of it
being  used  at  one  location  while it's being used at another.
Just  as  a  book  cannot be read by two different persons at the
same time.

Commercial users of AFORTH must register and pay for their copies
of  AFORTH  within  30  days  of  first  use  or their licence is
withdrawn.   Site  Licence arrangements may be made by contacting
Stratagem4.

Anyone  distributing  AFORTH  for any kind of remuneration should
register  with  Stratagem4 at the address below.  Further details
may be found in the file VENDOR.DOC.

You are encouraged to pass a copy of AFORTH along to your friends
for  evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their copy if
they  find  that  they  can  use  it.   All registered users will
receive a copy of the latest version of AFORTH.

Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~
AFORTH  is  a shareware product.  This means that you are free to
use  it for trial purposes only and you may freely pass copies on
to  your  friends  and  colleagues.   However, if you find AFORTH
useful  and  intend  to continue using it, you must register your
copy.   To do this, either print out and fill in the registration
form  provided  (Type  'TYPE  >PRT:   REGISTER.DOC'  from the CLI
prompt  or  use any other preferred method), or write the details
in  a  letter,  enclose  a  cheque  for £30.00 and post it to the
following address:

                             AFORTH
                           Stratagem4
                      125 Broadview Avenue
                             Rainham
                           Gillingham
                              Kent
                             ME8 9JD

For your money, you will receive the following benefits:

1)  the   latest  registered  version  of  AFORTH,   without  the
    registration encouragement screen;
2)  access   to   bulletins   detailing   upgrades,   fixes   and
    enhancements,  which may only be available in registered user
    copies;
3)  access to support from the author;
4)  upgrades at nominal, or reduced, rates;
5)  preferential distribution of new product releases.

Please  remember  that  if  you  use  this  product then you must
register as a user.

Nominal   rates   should  be  interpreted  as  'media  cost  plus
handling'.   Reduced rates should be interpreted as a 'percentage
of the registration fee in force at the time'.  Such charges will
only  be  made  when  a  major  enhancement  or  upgrade has been
undertaken.   You  will of course receive advance notification of
such charges, and are in no way obligated to purchase.

Overseas Registrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For  European  users,  there  is an additional shipping charge of
£2.00 and for other overseas users, the charge is an extra £5.00.
However  for those in the USA or Canada, AFORTH can be registered
for  just  $60.00  (US dollars).  Users in Australia can register
AFORTH for $85.00 (Australian dollars).

Support
~~~~~~~
Support  is  offered  to  registered users in the following ways.
Firstly,  any  updates  of  AFORTH will be available to you for a
nominal,  or reduced, fee.  All registered users will be notified
of  any  major  updates.  Lifetime support for AFORTH is provided
and  can  be  obtained by contacting Stratagem4 in writing at the
address  listed  at the front of this manual, or by telephone, at
any  (reasonable) time, on the number listed at the front of this
manual.

The Future
~~~~~~~~~~
It  is  hard  to  predict the future of AFORTH.  What changes and
enhancements  will  be  made  depends  very  much on you and your
feedback,  which  I  can assure you will be listened to and acted
upon to make AFORTH the product you want it to be.

A  number  of  additional  programs are planned, or are currently
under  development,  these will be available, to REGISTERED USERS
only,  as FREE updates on successful completion of the coding and
testing cycle.  These include:

1)  a   complete   68000   (minimum)   assembler   (source   code
    distribution);
2)  a  stand alone compiler to generate AFORTH programs which run
    in  the  AmigaDOS/WorkBench  environment, without  the AFORTH
    interactive environment;
3)  fd file to AFORTH converter for distributed libraries;
4)  a  complete  set  of Commodore library interfaces (subject to
    licencing arrangements).



INSTALLATION AND GETTING STARTED
================================

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installation  is a very straightforward process.  All you need to
do  is  copy AFORTH to any directory you deem fit for the purpose
and it is immediately available for use.

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AFORTH  may  be  run from the CLI or the Workbench.

Workbench:  double click on the AFORTH icon.

CLI:  CD to the installed directory and type AFORTH<return>.

After  both  of these operations you will be placed in the AFORTH
interactive  environment, now would be a good time to consult the
included document UsingAFORTH.doc.

Conclusion
----------

So there you have it!  Use and enjoy as you see fit!

        //
Thanx \X/ Amiga.
