			--- THE ARCHIVES DISK ---
			
The Archives Disk contains three archives:  c_source.zoo,
lib_src&bmarks.zoo, and roff_doc.zoo.  The first contains
C source code to the byte code simulator which is known to
compile under Lattice C 4.0 with the option -dMICRO=1. 
lib_src&bmarks.zoo contains Prolog source code for the 
runtime libraries and various benchmark tests.  Finally,
roff_doc.zoo contains a version of the documentation
suitable for processing by n/troff if you have access
to these tools (see the README file on the executables
disk for more details).

The diskette also contains a copy of zoo, the archiver.

To access these archives, type
	"zoo x// archive:c_source.zoo"
	"zoo x// archive:lib_src&bmarks.zoo"
with the destination diskette as the current working directory.
Zoo will create the appropriate directories as long as you were
sure to specify the "//" option.
