   Imagine a small bug crawling around on your computer display moving one
pixel at a time. At each step it uses its internal state number and the
color of the pixel its on as indexes into a set of tables to decide what
color to change the pixel to, what direction to move, and what its new
internal state should be.

Some interesting rule tables:
   State:      Color:      Motion:
   1 2         2 2         2 1
   1 3         2 1         4 4
   1 3         2 1         3 1

   2 1 1       3 1 1       2 2 4
   1 1 1       2 1 3       1 1 1

   1 2         2 1         4 1
   1 1         2 2         2 2

   1 1 1 1     2 3 4 1     2 2 4 4

   1 1         2 1         4 2
