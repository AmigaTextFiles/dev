avcall - Foreign function interface to C.

This library allows arbitrary C functions to be called from embedded
interpreters, debuggers, RPC calls, etc, by building up a C
argument-list incrementally from explicitly typed arguments. This 
considerably reduces the amount of boilerplate glue code required
for such applications.

The interface is like stdargs/varargs in reverse and is intended to be as
portable as possible, however the details of function calling are highly
machine-dependent so your mileage may vary. At the very least there are
typically built-in limits on the size of the argument-list. The
argument-pushing macros all return 0 for success, < 0 for error (eg,
arg-list overflow).

Installation instructions:
	./configure
	make
	make check
	make install

Documentation (such as it is) is in DOC and the man page.

The list of supported machines/compilers currently supported is in PLATFORMS.
Other ports and bug fixes are welcome. 
Porting is usually a bit messy but do-able.

The current code is under the GNU licence, but the interface (macro
names, arguments & functionality but not the actual macro or function
code in avcall.[ch]) is absolutely free and any port conforming to it is
welcome.
