KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

   There is an incompatibility between descriptions or arrays in
the include files and the interface.lsp functions, for arrays of structures
or array of elements more than 4 bytes long.
Some includes have been patched by hand.

   In addition, ^C and ^D will Signal the AMXLISP Task, and these signals
will be detected at every File I/O (comes from Lattice 4.0 compilation).
Just click on the CONTINUE Gadget on appearance of the LATTICE Requester.

   Memory-acces functions (memory-word and memory-long) should verify
the alignment of the address before executing.

   For other problems, see the documentation file.
   See also monitor.lsp, rom.lsp, and demo.lsp files for examples.
