Provided is an improved, faster screen editor which uses
the keyboard cursor keys, backspace and delete keys and
function keys which allow fast moving thru the screens,
pasting from PAD and the printing of screen, triad or PAD
to the printer port prt:.  F1 is the OOPs key.  Control
Keys give fast editing.  The control keys and Function
keys can be reprogrammed by the user if desired.  Runs on
Amiga 1000 and 3000.  Probably on Amiga 500 and 2000
