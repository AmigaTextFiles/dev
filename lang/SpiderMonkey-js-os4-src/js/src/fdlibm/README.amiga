Hello,

For 68k :
    My smakefile does not create a library.  Why?  Because I am dumb and
    enjoy doing things the hard way.  In order to create fdlibm.lib, one
    must manually run SAS/C's object module librarian.  I have a text file
    named "objs" which makes this easier:

        > delete fdlibm.lib
        > oml fdlibm.lib r @objs

For Amiga OS4 :
    The makefile does generate a static library (libfdlibm.a) that is latter
    linked with the javascript core.
