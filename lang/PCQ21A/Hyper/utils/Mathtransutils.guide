    NAME
        CloseMathTrans - closes the FFP mathtrans.library

    SYNOPSIS
        PROCEDURE CloseMathTrans;

    DESCRIPTION
        This routine closes the Motorola FFP transcendental library
        opened by OpenMathTrans.  It is important that you call this
        routine because the mathtrans.library is disk-based, and it
        will not be unloaded from memory if it thinks someone is
        still using it.

    EXAMPLE

        PROGRAM CheckTrans;
        {$I "Include:Utils/MathTransUtils.i"}
        {$I "Include:Libraries/MathTrans.i"}
        BEGIN
            IF OpenMathTrans THEN BEGIN
                Writeln('Pi is about ', SPAcos(-1.0));
                CloseMathTrans;
            END ELSE
                Writeln('mathtrans.library was unavailable');
        END.

    INPUTS
        None

    RESULTS
        None

    NAME
        FlushMathTrans - close and remove the mathtrans.library

    SYNOPSIS
        PROCEDURE FlushMathTrans;

    DESCRIPTION
        FlushMathTrans is the same as CloseMathTrans library,
        but it also signals the mathtrans.library that it should
        remove itself from the system as soon as possible.
        If no other tasks have opened the mathtrans.library, it
        will normally remove itself immediately.

    EXAMPLE

        PROGRAM CheckTrans;
        {$I "Include:Utils/MathTransUtils.i"}
        {$I "Include:Libraries/MathTrans.i"}
        BEGIN
            IF OpenMathTrans THEN BEGIN
                Writeln(SPSin(4.7));
                FlushMathTrans;
            END ELSE
                Writeln('Could not open mathtrans.library');
        END.

    INPUTS
        None

    RESULTS
        None

    NAME
        OpenMathTrans - open the mathtrans.library

    SYNOPSIS
        FUNCTION OpenMathTrans : Boolean;

    DESCRIPTION
        This routine is equivalent to calling OpenLibrary on the
        Motorola FFP trancendental math library.  If the library
        can be opened, OpenMathTrans returns TRUE, and otherwise
        it returns FALSE.

        This routine initializes MathTransBase, which is defined
        in Libraries/MathTrans.i.

    EXAMPLE

        PROGRAM TryTrans;
        {$I "Include:Utils/MathTransUtils.i"}
        BEGIN
            IF OpenMathTrans THEN BEGIN
                Writeln('mathtrans.library is available');
                CloseMathTrans;
            END ELSE
                Writeln('mathtrans.library is not available');
        END.

    INPUTS
        None

    RESULTS
        TRUE if the library could be opened, or
        FALSE if something went wrong
