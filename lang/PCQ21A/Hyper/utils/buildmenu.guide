    Utils/BuildMenu

    NAME
        AttachMenu - attach a BuildMenu menu to its window

    SYNOPSIS
        PROCEDURE AttachMenu;

    DESCRIPTION
        AttachMenu makes a menu defined using the NewMenu,
        NewItem and other routines available to the user.
        You must, of course, have already called InitializeMenu
        and defined the menu using NewMenu and NewItem calls.

        You will need to set the IDCMP flag MENUPICK_f in order
        to receive messages from Intuition about this menu.  You
        can set the flag in the NewWindow structure, or through
        a call to ModifyIDCMP.

    NAME
        DetachMenu - remove a menu strip from a window

    SYNOPSIS
        PROCEDURE DetachMenu;

    DESCRIPTION
        This routine removes the menu strip from the window.
        You must call this routine before closing a window or
        messing around with the menu itself.

    Utils/BuildMenu

    NAME
        DisposeMenu - Free the memory used by a BuildMenu menu strip.

    SYNOPSIS
        PROCEDURE DisposeMenu;

    DESCRIPTION
        DisposeMenu frees the memory allocated by the NewMenu and
        NewItem routines.

        This routine is not for general use - it only works with
        the rest of the BuildMenu routines.  Also, you'll have to
        call DetachMenu before this routine to let Intuition know
        the menu is no longer available.

        Since NewItem and the related routines use PCQ memory
        allocation, the memory used by the menus will be freed auto-
        matically at the end of the program.  Thus you don't have to
        call this routine unless you want to free it beforehand.

    EXAMPLE
        see Examples/SmallCom.p

    INPUTS
        None

    RESULTS
        The memory used by the current menu is deallocated.

    NAME
        InitializeMenu - set up the BuildMenu system.

    SYNOPSIS
        PROCEDURE InitializeMenu(w : WindowPtr);

    DESCRIPTION
        InitializeMenu creates a blank menu system for a the
        BuildMenu system.

        InitializeMenu must be called before any of the other
        BuildMenu routines.

        Note that the BuildMenu routines can only define one
        menu strip at a time.

    EXAMPLE
        see Examples/SmallCom.p, Examples/DeadKeysPlus.p,
            Examples/ConsoleTest.p

    INPUTS
        w : a pointer to an open Window.

@node "newitem" "NewItem"

    Utils/BuildMenu

    NAME
        NewItem - add a menu item to the current menu

    SYNOPSIS
        PROCEDURE NewItem(Name : String; Comm : Char);

    DESCRIPTION
        NewItem adds a menu item to the current menu strip, under
        the menu defined in the most recent NewMenu call.  The
        item is placed directly below any previous item defined
        for the same menu.

        You must call NewMenu before calling this routine, and you
        must call this routine before calling NewSubItem.

        NewItem lets you set up a command key for the item by
        passing a character in the Comm parameter.  If you don't
        want a keyboard equivalent for this item (if the item has
        a SubItem, for example, it shouldn't have one), just pass
        Chr(0) for Comm.

        When defining items and sub-items, you should add spaces to
        the text of the shortest items to make all the text the same
        length.  That will make all of the selection boxes the same
        size, which looks better and is easier to use than different
        sized boxes.

    EXAMPLE
        see Examples/SmallCom.p, Examples/DeadKeysPlus.p,
            Examples/ConsoleTest.p

    INPUTS
        Name : a string defining the text to be displayed for the
               item.
        Comm : the command key to be used for this item, or Chr(0)
               if no command key should be used.

        None

    NAME
        NewMenu - attach a menu to the current menu strip

    SYNOPSIS
        PROCEDURE NewMenu(MenuText : String);

    DESCRIPTION
        NewMenu adds another menu to the current menu strip.
        The menu is placed just to the right of any previous one,
        with a width based on the window's font.

        NewMenu must be called at least once before any calls
        to NewItem.

    EXAMPLE
        See Examples/SmallCom.p, Examples/DeadKeysPlus.p,
            Examples/ConsoleTest.p

    INPUTS
        MenuText : The text you want displayed on the menu bar.

    NAME
        NewSubItem - add a sub-item to a menu item

    SYNOPSIS
        PROCEDURE NewSubItem(Name : String; Comm : Char);

    DESCRIPTION
        NewSubItem is the same as NewItem, but adds the new item
        to the most recent item, rather than the most recent menu.

        You must call NewItem before calling this routine.

        If you do not want to use a keyboard equivalent for the
        item, pass Chr(0) in the Comm parameter.

    EXAMPLE
        See Examples/SmallCom.p and Examples/DeadKeysPlus.p

    INPUTS
        Name : The text to be displayed in the sub item.
        Comm : A command key, or Chr(0) if no keyboard equivalent
               should be used.
