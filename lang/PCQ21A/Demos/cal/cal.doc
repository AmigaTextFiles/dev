         cal, Version 2.0
         Copyright © 1995 by Andreas Tetzl
         This is FREEWARE !



INTRODUCTION

    Cal is a shell command similar to the one found on UNIX systems.
    It shows a calendar of the current month or any other month.



DISTRIBUTION

    Cal is FREEWARE ! It is freely distributable
    as long as no files of the archive are changed or
    removed. Commercial use is prohibited without
    permission of the author.



REQUIREMENTS

    Cal needs at least Kickstart 2.0 v37.
    If you have Kickstart v38+ installed, it will use the
    locale.library.



NEW FOR 2.0

    - calendars from year 1 to 3000
    - highlighting of special days



INSTALLATION

    Copy cal to c: or somewhere in your path.
    Copy the file cal.dates to s: .



CLI OPTIONS

    options:
     MONTH : the month (1..12)
     YEAR  : the year  (1..3000)
              IMPORTANT: short form (95) is NOT allowed !
     Y     : turn the year-calendar on (useful for year 1..12)
     DATES : filename of config (see section configuration)


    If you give no arguments, the current month is shown.
    Use MONTH and/or YEAR to show other month.

    If you specify only a year or use the switch Y, a complete
    calendar of this year is shown.



    examples:
     cal 4            ; april of current year
     cal 2 1993       ; feb-1993
     cal 12 2000      ; dec-2000
     cal 1523         ; calendar of 1523
     cal 10 y         ; calendar of year (!) 10



CALENDAR FORMAT

    Per default sunday is shown at first position.

    To switch the calendar format (Sunday first or last) you
    have to set the environment variable SUNDAY_LAST.

    Use 'setenv SUNDAY_LAST 1', if you want sunday at last
    position, SUNDAY_LAST = 0 otherwise.

    If you want SUNDAY_LAST set up permanently you have to copy
    the variable to ENVARC.

    use:
    copy ENV:SUNDAY_LAST ENVARC:


    If you have locale.libray installed, the format of the
    calendar is taken from the locale country settings.

    Setting the env variable will override locale settings.



CONFIGURATION

    This section explains the file cal.dates.


    This file contains the information about highlighting of
    special dates. It can be located in s:, the current directory,
    where you start cal from, or you can specify the filename
    by using the cli-argument DATES (see section CLI OPTIONS).

    If this file does not exists, there won't be any error message.
    If it contains a syntax error or an invalid date, an error
    message is shown before the calendar.

    Each line consists of the date itself and one or more
    attributes. A comment is indicated by a semicolon ';'.

    format
      year-month-day    attributes

    For year and month you can also use '?', if you want every
    year/month.

    known attributes
      B     - bold
      I     - italics
      U     - underlined
      C0..9 - color 0 to 9
      R0..9 - background color 0 to 9

      note: You can only use color values higher than 3, if you
            have enough colors on your workbench screen.

    example:

    1995-11-3    B C2

    If you execute "cal 11 1995", november 1995 is shown and
    the 3rd will be bold and white.

    See cal.dates for more examples.
