SOUTHWEST: CLIMATE AND WEATHER

Summers are generally cool and damp in southwestern
Alaska. Winters are drier and relatively mild. Winds
are frequently strong, especially along the coast and
throughout the Aleutian Islands.  The Alaska Peninsula,
the Aleutian Islands, the islands of Kodiak and Afognak
(in Southcentral), and the islands of the Bering Sea
are under strong maritime influence, and rarely get
whole days of sunshine.  Instead, they are subjected to
clouds, fog, heavy precipitation, high winds, and an
annual temperature range of 30 to 55 degrees F with
high humidity. Further north, in the area bordering the
Bering Sea, there is still a maritime influence, but it
is not as severe.  As one moves inland, there is less
and less influence and, consequently, warmer and drier
weather. At Cold Bay, in the Aleutians, normal monthly
temperature in July is 50 degrees F; in January, it is
28 degrees F. At King Salmon, July's average tempera-
tures range from 46 to 63 degrees F, and January's
average temperatures range from 6 to 21 degrees F.
