DRINKING WATER AND GIARDIA --
Giardia won't kill you, but you may wish it had! Symp-
toms of this disease are painful and incapacitating,
including diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, & loss
of appetite & weight. The disease comes from drinking
water which is infested with the microorganism Giardia
lamblia. "Beaver fever" is spread when Giardia cysts
are transmitted in animal feces to water, then drunk by
humans. Unfortunately, the cysts survive best in cold
water, & can be found in any surface water, whether it
looks & tastes good or not. Water in & below beaver
dams is particularly suspect. Since symptoms appear one
to four weeks after infestation, many people become ill
only after returning home. Symptoms can last up to six
weeks. If not treated, it can disappear, only to recur
later. With proper medication, giardia can be cured.
Proper sanitation in the wilderness is very important.
To destroy the cysts in stream, lake, or snow water,
bring it to a boil.  Boiling water for 10 to 20 min-
utes is recommended to kill the cysts & other contam-
inating organisms. If boiling is not possible, treat
water with iodine (two percent tincture) or tetragly-
cine hydroperiodide tablets.
