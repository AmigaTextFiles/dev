BEAR SAFETY

Best defense is to avoid potential danger with bears:
1) Do NOT feed them! It is illegal and unwise.  2) Keep
a clean camp; store foot away from tents.  3) Do not
camp on bear trails (would you camp on a highway?).
4) Avoid bear family groups; a female with cubs is very
dangerous!  5) Stay away from bear's food cache. If you
stumble on one, leave quickly and quietly.  6) Do not
suprise a bear; and keep out of its "critical space".
When hiking in brush, make noise; tie bell or a can of
rocks on your pack (or whistle, or sing).  7) Don't
turn and run from a bear; it may invite pursuit. 8) If
for some reason you ignore or forget these tips, or
just happen to have bad luck and a bear actually gets
hold of you, LIE STILL AND DON'T MOVE. Curl up on your
stomach with your knees to your chest and clasp your
hands over the back of your neck. If you want to carry
a weapon for bear protection, take a rifle no smaller
than 30.06, with bullets of at least 220 grains, or a
12=guage shotgun loaded with 00 buckshot or rifled
slugs.  It is legal here to shoot a bear ONLY IN DE-
FENSE OF LIFE OR PROPERTY.
