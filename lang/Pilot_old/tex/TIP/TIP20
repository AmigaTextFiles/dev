DRESS TO WALK --
People who have chosen to live in Alaska have learned a
few things about "living to tell about it."  One of the
most basic is the "dress-to-walk" concept. Nobody plans
on getting stranded, but everyone can plan to be pre-
pared for getting stranded.  Even if you're only driv-
ing across town, take along the coat, hat, mittens, and
footwear you would want if you had to walk back. The
farther you go, and the greater the chance of inclement
weather, the more important this is. Getting to a serv-
ice station, telephone, or any form of civilization may
involve a hike of many miles. Most important is proper
footwear. Use your head to save your feet!  Cold and
wet quickly travel from your feet upward. Have avail-
able proper footgear and an extra pair of non-restrict-
ing socks. Protect your head, too. You lose a lot of
body heat through the top of your head. And, an ap-
propriate jacket or coat and mittens are essential.
If you think this is all quite silly, note that Alaska
old timers always show up, at even the most elegant
cultural events, wearing parka, mitts, and mukluks
over state-of-the-art formal attire. Survival is never
unstylish, so DRESS TO WALK.
