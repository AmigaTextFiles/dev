FROSTBITE --
Frostbite is damage resulting from freezing body tis-
sue. Hands, feet, face, & ears are most suscepitble.
Wind chill on exposed flesh speeds freezing, as does
direct contact of flesh with cold metals, etc. Dress
adequately, especially if wind is blowing.  At low
temperatures, with or without wind, check each other's
faces & ears frequently for white patches which indi-
cate freezing flesh. Check yourself to be sure you can
feel sensation in every part of your body. First aid
treatment for frostbite is complicated and must be done
correctly to prevent permanent damage. Extremely light
frostbite--called frost nip--should be treated immed-
iately: Cover a white patch on the face with warm hand
to return flesh to a rosy glow. Hold frost-nipped fin-
gers or toes (without boots) in warm armpit. NEVER rub
a frostbitten area with anything, especially snow!
Treat victim for hypothermia. Transport to medical help
for rewarming as soon as possible. Do not use rewarmed,
frostbitten part of the body. Walking on frozen feet is
less damaging than walking on rewarmed feet.
