NO-TRACE CAMPING --

Getting away from it all is truly a pleasure; Alaska
provides some of the nation's most beautiful and re-
mote public lands on which to do just that. In getting
away from it all, please don't bring it all with you,
and then leave it behind!  No-trace camping is a name
for back-to-basics camping which preserves the remote,
wilderness quality we each seek. No-trace camping means
you come and go without a trace. "Take only pictures;
leave only footprints." And go light on the footprints.
If there is an established trail, stay on it. Don't
widen a wet or muddy spot by going around it. In open
and untraveled areas, choose your route to minimize
damage to plants and soil. Travel in small groups. Camp
within established sites to prevent spread of bare
areas and to minimize additional disturbances. Use ex-
isting campsites and fire circles. Use only dead and
down wood or a campstove. Build your fire on mineral
soil, and make sure it's deat out when you leave. Use
the "cat method" of elimination in dealing with human
wastes. Regarding litter, if you pack it in, pack it
out. Leave your campsite cleaner than you found it.
