AVOIDING TRESPASS --
Although most of Alaska's land is in public ownership,
it's not easy to see where public land ends and private
lands begin. Some private holdings are WITHIN public
land areas. Large acreages are owned by Native corpora-
tions and individuals. These lands -- and scattered
fishing and hunting camps -- should be respected as
private property. If planning a journey in wilderness
areas, contact the Native regional corporation about
location of private land and procedures for visiting
villages. Navigable rivers -- up to mean high water
mark -- passing through private lands may be used by
the public. Be sensitive to local concerns; remember
you are a guest -- treat rural residents with courtesy
and respect. Do not take pictures of residents unless
given permission. Trapping cabins and tent camps are
essential to the livelihood of many rural residents.
Do not use them except in case of real emergency. They
may appear abandoned, especially in late summer when
brush is tall, but the owners will return and will need
everything they left for coming winter. Early trappers
and wilderness travelers established an honorable tra-
dition that continues today. Please do your part.
