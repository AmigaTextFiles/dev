FIRE --

in Alaska is both boon and bane. For centuries, nature
has used fire as one means of creating new browse hab-
itat for wildlife.  Today, wildlife managers judicious-
ly follow that lead. Thus you may see, on your travels,
areas of Alaska which have been subjected to prescribed
burning in order to benefit the widlife which use the
habitat. On the other hand, uncontrolled, non-prescrip-
tion fire is dangerous to human life and property, as
well as to wildlife and its habitat. And wildlife fires
can be economically devestating. The of fighting wild-
land fires in remote Alaska is high; not to mention the
loss of saleable timber. Fire can be sparked easily in
dense undergrowth. And, even when it appears to be out,
a fire can be smoldering in ground cover, only to erupt
in flames hours or even days later.  Please observe all
safety rules for campfires; be sure your fires & smokes
are dead out, and check with the Alaska Division of For-
estry or the USDA Forest Service before conducting any
uncontained burning during Alaska's fire season -- from
May 1 through October 1.
