WIND CHILL --

When the effects of wind and cold are combined, there
is a super cooling effect known as "wind chill". When
you are in windy situations -- and that includes riding
in open vehicles -- you should beware of the wind chill
factor. Don't be fooled by thermometer readings! An in-
crease in the wind does not cause the temperature to
fall, so a thermometer does not register the chill fac-
tor.  Air movement or wind blows warmed air away from
exposed flesh, causing rapid cooling and a decrease in
skin temperature, thus permitting frostbite. Wind chill
factor applies to unprotected or exposed human flesh,
but prolonged exposure to high winds and cold tends to
rob insufficiently insulated clothing of its effective-
ness; that results in a loss of body heat. Continued
loss of body heat produces a temperature decrease of
the inner body core as heat is lost faster than the
body can produce it. This results in hypothermia.
