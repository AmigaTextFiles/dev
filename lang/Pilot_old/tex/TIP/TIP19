TRAVELING BY BUS --

Bus routes and services are generally much more limited
in Alaska than they are in the lower 48 states. Some of
the state's larger communities have public commuter bus
services, but that is the exception. Scheduled bus ser-
vice within Alaska (and the Yukon Territory of Canada)
is available, but there is no scheduled, direct bus
service to Alaska from the Lower 48 unless one takes
an escorted motorcoach tour. If you have the time, it
is possible to get to Alaska by bus using several car-
riers. Most scheduled bus service, however, is season-
al.  Outside individual communities, scheduled bus
service is offered by these companies: Alaska Yukon
Motorcoaches (907-276-1305, Anchorage); Atlas Tours
Ltd. (403-668-3161, Whitehorse); Coachways (403-667-
2223, Whitehorse); Norline Coaches (Yukon) Ltd. (403-
668-3355, Whitehorse); Valdez-Anchorage Bus Lines
(907-561-5806, Anchorage); White Pass & Yukon Motor-
coaches (907-277-5581, Anchorage); Seward Bus Line
(907-562-0712).
