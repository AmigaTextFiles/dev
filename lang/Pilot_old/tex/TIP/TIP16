FLYING IN ALASKA --
There are more small planes per capita in Alaska than
anywhere else in the U.S. So, if you are flying with
an Alaska bush pilot, you're joining a travel tradi-
tion. If you're doing your own bush piloting, FILE A
FLIGHT PLAN! That's the basic rule in Alaska. Check
the weather, pilot reports and flight publications for
enroute information and destination. Make sure you have
protective clothing on (or aboard) in case of unsched-
uled landing. Take a survival kit. Alaska law requires
certain minimum items be carried in the aircraft for
cross-country flights during summer months; additional
items must be carried from October through April. Check
with the FAA for specfic requirements. If you have a
forced landing, think twice before leaving your air-
craft. It is best to stay with the downed craft. Wea-
ther is the single factor that causes most emergency
and survival situations. Dress for the worst weather
you could expect on your trip; have clothing to live
in, not be found dead in. Check weather before depart-
ing. Watch for changing weather conditions. If they
look doubtful, make the 180-degree decision: Turn
around and go home.
