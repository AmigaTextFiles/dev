DRIVING IN ALASKA --
Auto insurance is mandatory in all Canadian provinces
and Alaska. Use of approved infant and child seats is
required in Alaska. Speed limit on the Alaska Highway
in Canada is 50 mph/80 kmph unless otherwise posted.
Maximum speed limit in Alaska is 55 mph/88 kmph. Under
winter driving conditions, maximum prudent speed may
be only 25-30 percent of posted speed. Legal posted
speed on unpaved state highways is 50 mph/80 kmph. It
is unlawful to use only parking lights, day or night,
when car is in motion. Parking lights denote a "parked"
car. Services on Alaska highways may be far apart and
severely limited--especially during winter. Major re-
pairs and parts are usually not available; vehicles
should have a thorough check before beginning a trip
to or through Alaska. Be aware that sanitary dump sta-
tions are virtually non-existent in Alaska; campers
should plan to take advantage of the few dump stations
provided in major cities. Regular, premium and diesel
gas are readily available throughout Alaska; unleaded
gas is available except in some small communities.
