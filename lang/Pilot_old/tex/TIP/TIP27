INTERIOR: CLIMATE AND WEATHER

In Alaska's northern interior, you can expect to en-
counter warm, dry summers interspersed with rain or
drizzle. The winters are cold, dry, and severe. South
of Fairbanks, there is often rain during the summer.
At Denali National Park and Preserve, the temperature
ranges from 43 to 66 degrees F in Summer. Record temp-
eratures for the month of July are 23 and 87 degrees
F. Throughout most of the Interior, both winter and
summer temperatures are subject to extremes. In moun-
tainous areas, it may snow any time of the year. It
is also in Alaska's interior that tremendous thunder
storms take place. These storms may or may not produce
rain, but the lightning causes many wildfires. As you
travel south from the Brooks Range to the Alaska Range,
the length of summer days (& winter nights) decreases.
