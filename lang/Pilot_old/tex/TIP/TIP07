CARBON MONOXIDE --
is a silent killer too often encountered in Alaska. It
is oderless, tasteless, & invisible.  It enters red
blood cells, chokes off oxygen, and the brain begins
to die. Rarely does the victim note anything wrong as
sleep comes on. Mild doses may cause loss of coordina-
tion, dizziness, & headache, & affect vision or cause
sleepiness. Skin color turns cherry red. Greater ex-
posure causes nausea, vomiting, throbbing of the heart,
unconsciousness, & death. Carbon monoxide is the result
of incomplete combustion of carbon fuels--all petroleum
fuels, charcoal, vehicle exhausts, and gas-burning ap-
pliances.  To be safe, NEVER sleep or rest in a closed,
parked vehicle with engine running (roll windows down
one inch on each side to assure cross ventilation).
NEVER leave engine running in a closed garage; avoid
following another vehicle closely enough to draw ex-
haust into your vehicle. Do not use charcoal-burning
devices indoors or inside trailers, campers, or vans.
Make sure the flame on gas-burning appliances is blue
(yellow flame indicates burner is improperly adjusted
and giving off excess carbon monoxide). Do not burn gas
cooking or heating stoves without adequate ventilation.
