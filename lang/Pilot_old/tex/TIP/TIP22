FILE A TRIP PLAN --

If you don't return as planned from your trip, the best
insurance that a search will get underway promptly is
to file a trip plan. Before leaving, tell a responsible
person (park or Forest Service ranger, family member,
good friend, etc.) those persons who will be going on
the trip, where you are going, which route you plan to
take, what transportation you intend to use, when you
expect to arrive there, and when you expect to return.
When you do return, be sure to let that person know.
When back-country hiking through a state or national
park or forest, obtain permits (if necessary) from, and
sign out with rangers. For backcountry excursions in
Alaska, it is recommended that you not travel alone,
and that you stay with your companions. Another recom-
mendation: Turning back before you reach your objective
may take some pleasure out of your trip, but it could
save your life.  You must anticipate the strength of
your party--and the capability of your means of trans-
portaion--for the return trip. If you do get lost or
stranded, sit down and think. Use your resources and
wait for rescue.
