AUTOMOBILE EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT --

Most travelers do not plan on having an emergency. But
preparation for one--especially in Alaska--is very im-
portant. Keep survival equipment on hand, and be sure
you know how to use it. Take a look at the "car trunk"
display in the Explore Alaska exhibit for suggestions
on what to include in your emergency equipment. Abso-
lute basics include maps, spare tire, flashlight,
shovel, flares, sheath knife, auto repair tools, roll
of electrical tape, water, medical or first-aid kit,
wooden matches in watertight container, wool blankets,
nylon cord, sheet of plastic, dress-to-walk clothing
and boots, dental floss (which can be used for anything
fishing line to tent cord), jumper cables, a quart of
engine oil, pruning saw and/or small axe, tow chain or
cable, spare fan belt and rations. Before you leave,
check all tires for inflaction pressure and general
condition. Check antifreeze, water and battery. If you
think these precautions are too costly or take up too
much room, think about how much your life is worth!
