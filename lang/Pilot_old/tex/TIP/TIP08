BEHAVIOR NEAR WILDLIFE --

While watching & photographing Alaska's wildlife, pro-
tect it and yourself: 1) Minimize disturbance of wild-
life & its environment.  Watch animals from a distance
THEY consider safe; use binoculars, spotting scopes,
& telephoto lenses. If an animal acts crowded or dis-
turbed, sit quietly or move slowely away. Don't sneak
up on or surprise animals. Never chase, repeatedly
flush, or harass animals; it's illegal!  Restrain pets
around wildlife.  Do not use tape-recorded calls or
other attraction devices in populated areas; bears at-
tracted by predator calls can be extremely dangerous.
2) Respect the rights of other wildlife watchers; avoid
spoiling somewone elses picture or view. Stop along
roadsides to view wildlife only at safe pullouts. Al-
ways get permission from landowners before traveling
on private property.  3) Avoid dangerous wildlife. Make
your presence known when you hike. Learn about bear
safety.  Keep away from a cow moose with calves. Never
try to feed any wild animal; that's also illegal! Keep
your campsite & equipment clean to avoid attracting
wild animals. Never forget that wildlife is WILD.
