ALASKA MARINE HIGHWAY SYSTEM --
Alaska's unique ferries link its coastal communities
via a waterborne highway system. This is one of the
nicest ways to see the inland waterways of Alaska's
"panhandle" and of Prince William Sound. Ferries,
ranging fron the snub-nosed commuter CHILKAT to the
COLUMBIA, flagship of the line, serve the Inside Pass-
age from Seattle & Prince Rupert to Haines & Skagway,
thus linking travelers to Alaska's Interior. Other
ferries serve coastal cities of Homer, Seward, Cordova,
Kodiak, Whittier, & Valdez in Southcentral Alaska. Com-
munities on the Alaska Peninsula & the Alutian Islands
in Southwestern Alaska also receive ferry service.
Passengers -- with or without vehicles -- can stop over
in various ports of call at no additional charge. USDA
Forest Service naturalists are on board some ferries
to talk about the Chugach & Tongass national forests
through which you travel. Reservations for vehicles
and staterooms are a MUST -- sometimes months in ad-
vance. For complete information & reservations, write
Alaska Marine Highway, Pouch R, Juneau, AK 99811, or
call 1-800-551-7185 within Alaska or 1-800-544-2251
from outside.
