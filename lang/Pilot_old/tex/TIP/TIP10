AVALANCHE SAFETY --
Most avalanches which catch people are triggered by
people. Learn to evaluate avalanche hazards & choose
safe travel routes. Take an avalanche class. Avalanches
can occur anywhere, but gullies, steep snow-covered
slopes, and areas below steep ridges are particularly
susceptible. Most happen during or just after heavy,
sustained snowfalls. If traveling in backcountry, DON'T
travel alone; make sure all understand avalanche rescue
techniques; wear avalanche victim locator beacons. If
caught in an avalanche, holler so others can follow
your path. Discard cumbersome gear -- skis, ski poles,
pack. "Swim" or roll to stay on top of the snow & work
toward the edge of flow. FIGHT WITH ALL YOUR EFFORT.
Try to end up feet down. As snow slows, thrust your
hand above the surface so it can be seen. Before snow
settles, cup your arm before your face to make air
space.  If buried, relax and save oxygen. Don't yell.
No one can hear you. Wait for rescue. If somewone else
is caught in an avalanche, FIRST use your own resources
for rescue, then go for professional rescue help. Time
is of the essence, and professional help may be hours
or days away.
