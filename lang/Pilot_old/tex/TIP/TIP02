HYPOTHERMIA --
is not limited to winter! Any time the body loses heat
faster than it is produced, hypothermia has begun. If
your temperature drops low enough, your brain, lungs,
& heart stop.  You die.  The combination of wet, cold,
& wind always threatens hypothermia. Accidental dunking
makes it worse. First symptom of hypothermia is violent
shivering. Continued exposure exhausts the body's ener-
gy reserves, and cold reaches the brain, diminishing
judgment and reasoning power.  Victim may not realize
what's happening & deny it. Loss of control of hands
occurs. Mental disorientation -- fumbling, confusion,
personality change, speech impairment, and inability to
make decisions -- is typical.  To prevent hypothermia,
avoid exposure with thorough preparations for every
outing; eat a good meal to store up energy; wear ade-
quate clothing; dress in layers; wear a hat; don't keep
going when you're overly exposed. If you see symptoms
in others, get them out of wind & wet; remove their
wet clothes; get them into dry clothing or sleeping
bag. Warm drinks (no alcohol) and sweets help.
