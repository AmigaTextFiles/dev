ON WATER SAFETY / RIVER CROSSING
Much reacreation in Alaska involves water; learn to en-
joy it safely. Remember, river trails are through wild-
erness and help may be very far away.  Alaska waters
are extremely cold, and safe immersion time is short.
When boating, EVERYONE should wear a life vest at all
times. Watch for hypothermia (see other survival tips).
Honestly know your boating ability. Seasons -- and
fluctuating water depths -- can affect danger. Lakes
can be dangerous during high winds, going from calm to
rough in a short time.  Do not destroy beaver dams;
they help maintain water levels in lakes and streams.
Learn about -- and practice -- stream crossings before
walking through wilderness.  Glacier streams carry
glacier-ground, "rock flour" which can weigh down your
clothing. Also, glacial murk makes it impossible to
guage depth. Never cross a stream or river barefoot.
If you fall while crossing, immediately get out of
your pack. If you are swept downstream, float on your
back, feet first, until youy are where you can work
your way to shore. To be really safe, check with USDA
Forest Service or Alaska Division of Parks & Outdoor
Recreation for river-crossing seminars and tips.
