HISTORIC AND ARCHEOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS --

Many Alaska areas contain unique samples of the past,
including archeological and historic sites and arti-
facts. These cultural resources are non-renewable; once
destroyed, they are gone forever. The 1906 Antiquities
Act prohibits removal, excavation, or destruction of
any historic or prehistoric ruin or monument or any
object of historical value located on public land.
Violation of this act can result in penalty of fine
and/or inprisonment. Please do ot touch, move, collect,
or otherwise disturb artifacts, cultural features, or
vertebrate paleontological materials. If you locate
such a resource, record site location on a USGS map if
possible, and take compass bearings to prominent land-
marks. Estimate site's size, and please take photo-
graphs of site area and surrounding landscape. Any ad-
ditional information, such as drawings or descriptions
of the resource is appreciated. Report the information
to Alaska Office of History and Archeology, Dept. of
Natural Resources, Pouch 7-001, Anchorage, AK 99510 or
to Regional Archeologist, National Park Service, 2525
Gambell, Anchorage, AK 99503
