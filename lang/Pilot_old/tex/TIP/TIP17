ALASKA RAILROAD --
Riding the state's railroad is one of the best ways to
see Alaska and its wildlife. The 12-hour ride between
Fairbanks & Anchorage may be your best chance to see
mighty Mt. McKinley, and you can't miss Denali Nation-
al Park -- you go right through it. Plus, where else
but Alaska can you drive your vehicle on a railroad
car, then ride through two tunnels to another part of
the state where you board a state ferry for another
portion of the excursion. That treat is available be-
tween Portage (south of Anchorage on Turnagain Arm of
Cook Inlet) and Whittier (on Prince William Sound).
On the Anchorage-Fairbanks run, the Alaska Railroad
still provides "flag-stop" service to Alaskans living
in remote areas along the route, or for hunters and
anglers who need access to Alaska's backcountry. Res-
ervations are recommended, especially in summer, but
seats are usually available if you get to the depot
early. Children under five ride free; children ages
5 to 12 ride at half adult fare. For complete schedule
and information, call 265-2685 Anchorage, 456-4155
Fairbanks, (206) 624-4234 Seattle. For reservations
call (907) 265-2623.
