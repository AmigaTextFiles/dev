MOSQUITOES --
and other insects are common throughout Alaska, partic-
ularly in the Interior, where summers are warm. Coastal
areas, with wet, cool summers, have fewer mosquitoes
than do inland areas, but they may make up for it with
other biting insects. Mosquitoes are little problem in
cities. In the bush, they are often at their worst in
June, tapering off in July. Other biting insects appear
mid-summer through mid-September: no-see-ums, white
socks, black flies, and moose flies. With proper prep-
aration -- and attitude -- you can still enjoy the out-
doors. Always take with you (and use) insect repellent
lotion or spray. Choose brands with a high percentage
of DEET (diethyltolumide), the  active ingredient. Re-
member, however, that the solvent used in most insect
repellents also disolves many plastics, including eye-
glasses frames, and the imitation-leather covering on
most cameras and binoculars. Keeping clothing snugly
closed will help keep insects off, as will a head net.
Tying your cuffs closed will help keep out sand fleas.
As far as attitude goes -- just keep in mind that, if
it weren't for the mosquitoes, your favorite camping
site would probably be overrun with tourists!
