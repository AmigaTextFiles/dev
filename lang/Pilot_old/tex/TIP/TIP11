SNOWBLINDNESS --
results from the burning of the eye (conjunctiva) by
the sun's ultraviolet rays. These are the cold, invi-
sible rays that penetrate haze and light cloud cover
to burn skin and eyes, even though the body feels
cool. This burning is exaggerated when sunlight is
reflected off snow and water. Snowblindness occurs
more often on overcast days, particularly under "white-
out" conditions, than it does on clear days when the
sun is shining brightly on the snow. Symptoms of snow-
blindness are redness, burning, & watering of eyes,
scratchy eyelids -- like having sand in the eye --
headache, and extreme pain due to swelling of the con-
junctiva. It takes 2 to 12 hours for the symptoms to
appear, and there is little warning until after the
burning has happened. Snowblindness can disable a
person for as long as five dys. Prevention is the best
cure; wear protective glasses or goggles outdoors dur-
ing daylight hours. Treatment involves resting in a
darkened room with eyes bandaged to stop painful eye
movement. Use cold compresses to reduce pain. The con-
dition heals in a few days, but victims may be more
susciptible to repreated snowblindness.
