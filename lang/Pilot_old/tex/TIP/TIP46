RECREATIONAL MINING --

is allowed on some public lands and not on others. To
be safe, check land status (who owns it, and whether
it is open to recreational mining) with the U S Bureau
of Land Management and the Alaska Department of Natural
Resources.  As a recreational miner, you do not have
the right to prevent others from looking for gold on
public land. You also do not have a right to pan on
another's claim unless given permission by the claim-
ant.  Before you do any recreational mining, consider
the impacts of this activity on the land. Mining can
affect plants, animals, humans, and soil. The impact
on water is the most serious of all, as silt (washed
into streams and rivers during the process of separa-
ting soil and minerals) threatens the lives of fish.
Before using a dredge, or any other earth-moving or
earth-rearranging equipment, contact the Alaska Depart-
ment of Fish and Game's Habitat Division; a permit may
be necessary.  On all public lands, check with the
managing agency for special restrictions. Good luck!
