SOUTHCENTRAL: CLIMATE AND WEATHER

Southcentral has been called Alaska's "Banana Belt"
because its climate and weather are the most mild and
"even-tempered" of any in the state. This region, par-
ticularly the portions along the coast, enjoys the
warmer winters and cooler summers which come with a
maritime influence. However, some coastal areas (for
example, Seward, Whittier, Kodiak, and Yakutat) also
get maritime rain and overcast. As one moves inland,
the wetnes subsides, and temperatures become more ex-
treme--similar to those of Interior Alaska. In Anchor-
age, the region's and the state's largest city, the
average annual precipitation is 15 inches, with 49
days of precipitation annually. In January, the mean
low is 6 degrees F., while the mean high is 20 de-
grees F. In July, the mean low is 51 degrees F., with
a mean high of 65 degrees F. The record low in Anchor-
age is -34 degrees F (recorded in January), while the
record high is 85 degrees F (recorded in June). Long
summer days accompany short twilight nights in June
and July, and winter "days" may be as short as four
hours in December and January.
