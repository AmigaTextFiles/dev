ALASKA'S ROAD CONDITIONS --

Alaska roads vary from 4-lane, paved freeways to 1-lane
dirt and gravel tracks. Driving in Alaska is different
from that in the "lower 48" states. Weather, construc-
tion, and maintenance all help determine the quality of
a road's condition. Know your vehicle and its limit-
ations; know also the limitations of the road you plan
to travel. Some are not suitable for 40-foot motorhomes
or low-to-the-ground sports cars. Many Alaska roads are
not paved, and rocks and gravel are hard on tires; in-
vest in quality tires, and carry at least one spare.
Don't drive too fast on gravel. Watch for frost heaves;
driving too fast on these can result in broken axles
and trailer hitches. Watch for road construction, and
give trucks the right of way. Be especially careful in
wet weather on roads with clay surfaces; the mud is
very slippery. Watch for chuckholes and washouts.
DON'T use cruise control on Alaska roads. For a report
of highway conditions, call 456-7623 (456-ROAD).
