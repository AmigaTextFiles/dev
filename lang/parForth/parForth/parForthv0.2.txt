parForth v0.2 by Nathan Hesterman (2023-02-02)

parForth v0.2 (pForth for AROS) is pForth v27 by Phil Burk compiled to allow calling of AROS functions.  It builds on
v0.1 by adding Turtle Graphics and a Spirograph TM construction set.  It includes GadToolsDemo.f and TurtleDemo.f.  It
includes words for executing AROS DOS commands, accessing libraries, double-linked lists, ports, windows, menus,
gadgets, and graphics drawing and area drawing.  It defines ANS Forth Facility Extension words TIME&DATE and MS. It
defines RANDOMIZE so that 0 RANDOMIZE seeds CHOOSE with a random seed based upon clock ticks (50 per second) since the
start of day.  It provides extracts from 'JForth for the Amiga' AmigaDOS 2.0 include (.j) files and words to parse
these structures.  JForth is freeware that can be downloaded from http://www.softsynth.com/jforth.  parForth defines
all kinds of GadTools gadgets with a demonstration program.  Everything in this system uses relocatable addresses so can
be compiled or turnkeyed.

To use:
Copy the parForth directory to your harddrive.  From a shell, CD to the path parForth/fth.  You probably want to add an
assignment to S:User-Startup (Assign >Nil: parForth: PATH/parForth/fth).  Type 'pForth' to start parForth.

To run Demos:
Type 'include MyCode/GadToolsDemo.f'.  Type 'BYE' to exit.
Type 'include MyCode/TurtleDemo.f'.    Type 'BYE' to exit.

To run Turtle Graphics:
Type 'include parForthExtensions/Turtle.f' and then 'TURTLE'.  See Turtle.txt for commands.  Type 'BYE' when done.

To customize:
Edit parForthExt.f.  Use tabs of width 4 so everything lines up properly.
At the bottom in the definition of 'parForth', substitute your path to 'parForth/fth' for 'SYS:'
In the definition of 'MyCode', substitute the path to your code for 'S:'
Uncomment:
	\ : auto.init auto.init MyCode ;					\ uncomment to CD to your code path on start-up
	\ : auto.term PROTECT parForth auto.term ;			\ uncomment to CD to your parForth directory on BYE
Rebuild your sytem by typing 'pForth -i system.fth'
Now when parForth starts it will automatically CD to your code directory and when it ends it will automatically
CD to your parForth/fth directory.  You can change directories by typing 'parForth' or 'MyCode'.
