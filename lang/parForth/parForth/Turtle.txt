Turtle Graphics Words
	Basic Commands
		TURTLE							open Turtle Graphics window
											black ink
											white canvas
											canvas width 10,000 points
											canvas height proportional to window width/height
											origin, point (0,0), in center of canvas
											see SAVEPREFS
		SQUASH							close Turtle Graphics window
		BYE								close graphics window and ends program
		PENUP							moving turtle will not draw anything
		PENDOWN							moving turtle draws a line along its path
		90 LEFT							rotate the turtle left by 90 degrees
		45 RIGHT						rotate the turtle right by 45 degrees
		0 HEADING						change the turtle heading to 0 degrees (pointed to right of screen)
		500 FORWARD						move the turtle forward 500 points
		-250 500 GOTO					goto point (-250,500)
		HOME							move the turtle to point (0,0); see NEWHOME
		500 180 ARC						draw a semi-circle to the left with a radius of 500 points
		-500 90 ARC						draw a 90 degree arc to the right with a radius of 500 points
		500 CIRCLE						same as 500 360 ARC
		RED INK							change the drawing ink to red
		BLACK CANVAS					change the canvas color to black on the next CLEAR
		CLEAR							clear the window, move to ORIGIN, 0 HEADING, PENDOWN, SHOWTURTLE
		REFRESHWINDOW					after resizing window, establish a canvas encompassing new dimensions
		SAVEPREFS						save ink, window size & placement, canvas width & color, colors for next session
		TURTLEDEFAULTS					restore paramters from prefs 

	Basic Programming
		100 VALUE MyVariable			define a variable named 'MyVariable' and set it to 100
		10 TO MyVariable				change MyVariable's value to 10
		DEFINE name ... END				define 'name' which executes commands ... until END
		24 REPEAT[ ... ]				repeat commands ... 24 times

		500 VALUE Length				assign 500 to variable 'Length'
		DEFINE Square 4 REPEAT[ Length FORWARD 90 LEFT ] END
		Square							draw a square with sides of length 500

	Advanced Commands
		HIDETURTLE						suppress display of turtle (speeds drawing)
		SHOWTURTLE						display turtle if previously hidden
		0 SPEED							FASTEST drawing speed (0 millisecond delay between draws)
		RNDCOLOR INK					set ink to a random color
		0 0 0 COLOR BLACK				define the color 'black' with rgb values (0-255) of 0 0 0
		COLORS							list defined colors
		INK?							print current ink color
		CANVAS?							print current canvas color
		500 BACKWARD					same as -500 FORWARD
		250 5 POLYGON					draw a pentagram with sides of length 250
		10 1000 5 POLYGONAL				draw 10 pentagrams with sides of length 1000
		DOT								draw a dot at current point if PENDOWN
		XY								leave coordinates of turtle's location on stack
		X								leave only X coordinate
		Y								leave only Y coordinate
		LEFTMOST						leave minimum X on stack
		RIGHTMOST						leave maximum X on stack
		BOTTOMMOST						leave minimum Y on stack
		TOPMOST							leave maximum Y on stack
		NEWHOME							make the current location the new home (origin)
		500 MOVEHOME					PENUP 500 FORWARD NEWHOME PENDOWN
		ORIGIN							restore the original origin as home and go there
		20000 CANVASWIDTH				set canvas width to 20,000 (-10,000 to 10,000) and CLEAR
		BOTTOMLEFT						move to bottom left of canvas
		BOTTOMRIGHT						move to bottom right of canvas
		TOPLEFT							move to top left of canvas
		TOPRIGHT						move to top right of canvas
		FLOOD							replace color of adjacent pixels below turtle with current ink
		BEGINFILL						begin drawing outline of a shape to be filled
		ENDFILL							fill shape just drawn with current ink
		USEPREFS						save prefs to file ENV:pfTurtle.prefs but not to ENVARC:
		5 WIDTH							set pen width to 5 pixels

	Advanced Programming				all parForth words are available; ] redefined as OLD]
	
	Spiro Commands
		1 SPIROMAGNIFICATION			default overall magnification factor (-50 = .5)
		28 MAGNIFICATION				default pattern magnification factor (-25 = .25)
		145 36 18 HYPOTROCHOID			a wheel of 36 radius within a ring of 145 radius with hole distance of 18
		145 36 18 EPITROCHOID			a wheel of 36 radius around a ring of 145 radius with hole distance of 18
		1 TEETH RIGHT					1/ring radius of rotation right about home
		200 TILTFROMBELOW				set tilt origin at 200 below current home
		200 TILTFROMABOVE				set tilt origin at 200 above current home
		TILT 1 TEETH RIGHT				1/tilt radius of rotation right about tilt origin 
		NEWTILTORIGIN					set current location as new tilt origin
		SPIRODEFAULTS					StartRevolution=0, StepSize=1, Magnification=28, Heading=90, Tilt=90, ORIGIN
		257 100 90 HSV>RGB				Convert Hue (0-360), Saturation (0-100), Value (0-100) to RGB (0-255)
