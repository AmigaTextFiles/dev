INSTALL for Forth2LaTeX-----------------------(01-05-95) This document describes how to compile and run Forth2LaTeX on Unix, VAX,  MS-DOS and Macintosh computers.   FOR ALL COMPUTERS----------------- Edit the source code for Forth2LaTeX and change the line:  #define MACINTOSH  to the appropriate system as listed in the code. (It's about two screens down into the code).  If your computer is not listed try UNIX.   COMPILATION AND EXECUTION DIRECTIONS FOR SPECIFIC COMPUTERS----------------------------------------------------------- "MSDOS"      The code runs as is under Turbo-C and will likely need little or no      modification to run under other compilers.  Just make sure that the      file 'proto.c' is in the same directory as 'f2l.c'.           "UNIX"      To compile try,            cc forth2latex.c -o forth2latex -Aa            or, if that fails, try:            gcc forth2latex.c -o forth2latex -ansi                "MACINTOSH"       Forth2LaTeX works under THINK C if you use the ANSI library.            "VAX"       Compile:  cc forth2latex.c     Link   :  link forth2latex, sys$library:vaxcrtl.olb/library          Then, in your LOGIN.COM file enter the line:          $ forth2latex :== <disk>:[<directory>]forth2latex.exe          where <disk> is the name of the disk your account is located on and     <directory> is path to the directory where the file forth2latex.exe     is actually located.  Type SHOW DEF to see your disk name and current     directory. Enter @LOGIN to re-load the login file.          Alternatively, when you wish to use Forth2LaTeX first enter,          forth2latex :== $<disk>:[<directory>]forth2latex.exe          to create a symbol that will be valid until you log out. Then use      the program normally.          If the symbol is not created in either of the two ways above the program     will not function properly.  You cannot simply RUN forth2latex.exe.
