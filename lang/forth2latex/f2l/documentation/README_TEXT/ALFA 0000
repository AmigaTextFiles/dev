README for Forth2LaTeX----------------------(01-05-95) Forth2LaTeX is a program for converting Forth source code into LaTeX so  that it can be printed nicely.  It will make use of LaTeX sectioning  commands and will generate a table of contents and an index of defined  words.  It uses different fonts for code and comments and allows  embedding of LaTeX commands in the source code.  See the manual for more information.  The code will run under Unix, VMS and on MS-DOS and Macintosh  computers.  See the file INSTALL for pertinent information about  compiling and running the program.  A Modula-2 version of the program, designed to run on the Macintosh as  a simple application, is also available.  Contact me at the address  below if you want the code and/or application.   SHIPPING MANIFEST----------------- All releases of Forth2LaTeX should include the files listed below:        README           --  this file           INSTALL          --  directions for installing Forth2LaTeX            manual.tex       --  user's manual (LaTeX code)      manual.txt       --  user's manual (plain text)            Forth2LaTeX.c    --  the C source code (called F2L.C under MS-DOS)      proto.c          --  a file of function prototypes             Additionally, if this is part of the Macintosh release:        Forth2LaTeX 1.9  --  Modula-2 application      Forth2LaTeX 1.9c --  C application            Forth2LaTeX.MOD  --  Modula-2 source code            COPYRIGHT, etc.--------------- Forth2LaTeX is distributed as freeware, but I retain all rights to the  program.
