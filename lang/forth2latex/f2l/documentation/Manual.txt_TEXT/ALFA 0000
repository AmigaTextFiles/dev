It presently runs in Modula-2 and C on the Macintosh and in C on Unix, VMS, and MS-DOS.  This manual describes all versions noting differences where appropriate.Source code for both the C and Modula-2 versions is included for those interested in modifying the program to suit their own needs.  Forth2LaTeX intentionally knows little of Forth.  It knows what a \ comment is and the words : (colon), VARIABLE, CONSTANT, CREATE, FVARIABLE, and FCONSTANT.  This does not tie it to a specific Forth system making Forth2LaTeX useful to the widest possible audience.Forth2LaTeX features include:  *  Ability to bold word names when defined.    *  Creating an index of defined words and the line on which the word was      defined.    *  Printing useful program information.    *  Complete LaTeX  access from within the source code in three different ways.    *  Different type styles for code and comments.    *  Ability to create a table of contents and section the code in a way      similar to LaTeX.    *  Command files allow processing groups of files at a single time.Forth2LaTeX does impose one minor constraint on the programmer, namely, it only recognizes \ comments and therefore will treat comments inparentheses as code.  This is really a minor inconvenience as parentheses are usually reserved for stack effects comments.Getting Started - A Guide for the Impatient-------------------------------------------If your copious free time is insufficient to allow a complete reading of this little manual, this is a good place to start.  The guide is divided by computer: Macintosh or Everyone Else.** Macintosh **Double-click the Forth2LaTeX application to get it going.  All parameters can be set via the SETTINGS menu.  Just choose the setting and it toggles between on or off.  Switching between REPORT and ARTICLE for the style will use the respective LaTeX document style.  Typically, longer programs make sense as reports while shorter programs are articles.  Chapter sectioning may only be used (or rather is ignored unless) the style is set to REPORT.  Leave the COMMENTS as FORTH unless you have included LaTeX code in the comments and did not use the ` (backquote) escape character.Choose OPEN... from the FILE menu and select a Forth source code file.  If the filename ends in .4th, .fth, or .forth the extension will be stripped.  Select an output filename using either the one suggested or your own with .tex appended.  Forth2LaTeX will process the file and report how many lines were processed when finished.** Everyone Else **Enter 'Forth2LaTeX' on the command line to see a quick help screen listing the format and switches.  Most a self-explanatory in nature, the rest are described below.Controlling Forth2LaTeX-----------------------There are two ways of controlling the operation of Forth2LaTeX: via menu or command line switches, or via Forth comments within the source code.  The latter will always override the former.  Needless to say, only the Macintosh version uses menus, the rest use command line switches.** Source Code **All versions of Forth2LaTeX can be controlled by comment statements within the Forth source code.  It is important to note that spacing and capitalization _are_ important.*** Settings ***Forth2LaTeX settings and information about the program are entered in the following form:   \ Program: <program name>   -- name of the program   \ Author: <author name>     -- name of the author, appears in the title   \ Started: <date>           -- date program begun   \ Modified: <date>          -- date of last modification   \ Modify By: <name>         -- person doing the modification   \ Summary: <single line>    -- a one line summary of the program      \ Comments: FORTH           -- comments are as normal   \ Comments: LATEX           -- comments are treated as LaTeX code      \ Uppercase: ON or OFF      -- force all but strings and comments to                                  uppercase                                     \ Table of Contents: ON | OFF  -- make a table of contents, use with                                     sectioning      \ Index: ON | OFF           -- output an alphabetical index of defined words      \ Bold: ON | OFF            -- bold colon definitions      \ Style: REPORT             -- use \documentstyle{report}   \ Style: ARTICLE            -- use \documentstyle{article}Certain characters have a special meaning to LaTeX and need to be escapedby prefixing with a \ when use normally. Forth2LaTeX does this automatically for code, including the spaces to force LaTeX to preserve the indentations, but can be told to stop this for comments.  The default setting is FORTH which escapes the text in comments as elsewhere.  Changing COMMENTS to LATEX allows the programmer to include LaTeX code in the comments, but also makes the programmer responsible for using appropriate escape sequences when necessary.  Note that the settings above can appear anywhere within the source code, but must appear in the first file to be processed when using multiple files.*** Sectioning ***Forth2LaTeX recognizes the standard LaTeX sectioning commands, though it ignores chapters unless in REPORT style.  Sectioning provides a convenient way to organize the source code and to create a table of contents that outlines the program structure.  To use sectioning, include statements giving the name of the section prefixed by the type of section:   \ Chapter: <chapter-name>   -- start a chapter (LaTeX \chapter)      \ Section:                  -- sections and subsections   \ Subsection:   \ Subsubsection:*** Other Ways of Including LaTeX Code ***The Comments: setting described above is only one of three ways to include LaTeX code in the Forth source code.  The others are to use a special LaTeX escape character or to use a \ . to prefix a line that will be passed as is into the output file.  The former is most useful for inserting a small piece of code:\  `$c_{m}$` is set hereappears as: $\backslash$\ \  $c_{m}$ is set hereThe escape character is ` (backquote).  Everything between backquotes is immune to special character escaping and can include valid LaTeX statements.To include an entire line, useful for entering normal text, prefix the line with a \ . where every character after the period is sent as is into the output file without escaping or forcing into a single line:\ .This will appear in the output as if it were entered into a normal\ .LaTeX document.  This could be used to insert large blocks of text\ .describing the code, or to even include graphics.** Command Line Switches and Menu Settings **It is possible change Forth2LaTeX settings without specifically stating the settings in the source code.  The Macintosh uses a menu called (surprisingly) SETTINGS to adjust Forth2LaTeX values prior to processing a file.  Each of the menu items has a direct counter part in the source code settings given above.Other computers use command line switches to alter the functioning of Forth2LaTeX.  The general format is:   Forth2LaTeX <source-file>  <switches>where the <switches> consists of a string of characters (case is irrelevant) prefixed with a - (dash).  No switches need be specified.  The options are listed below:    u  -- uppercase code (does not alter comments)	l  -- comments LATEX (default is FORTH)	t  -- generate table of contents	i  -- index of defined words	b  -- bold colon definition names	r  -- style is REPORT (default is ARTICLE)** Multiple Files **If Forth2LaTeX is presented a file with a .f2l extension it will assume it to be a command file that contains the names of a series of files to be processed.Comments, preceeded by a # character, may be added to the file.  A sample command file could be:# The following specifies the output file name, default is 'a.tex'# Output: Alexis.tex# These are the files to be processed, in order:     Setup.4th         # mainly memory management, constants, etc.     Arith.4th         # big integer and rational arithmetic and utilities     Poly.4th          # univariate polynomial routines and utilities     Command.4th       # Yerk code and command processor     Intrinsic.4th     # Built-in commands# That's all folks!The third line above is used to specify the output file name, which defaults to a.tex.  Unless complete path names are given in the command file Forth2LaTeX assumes that the files can be found in the current directory.  Use a command file when working on a larger project with multiple files.Conclusion----------It is sincerely hoped that Forth2LaTeX will be of use to you.  It is also hopedthat users will feel free to alter the source code for any of the versions, provided that the author is sent a copy if the modified version is to be released publicly.Suggestions and bug reports (Bugs? What are those?) are to be sent to the email address given at the beginning of this document.  The author assumes no responsibility of any kind for any loss of data or time that may be caused by the use of this program.  While it is unlikely that something will happen, if it does, I'm not to blame.
