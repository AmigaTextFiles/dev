    The HeliOS editor Find/Replace system
    *************************************

    There are one or two interesting features of the HeliOS editor Find/
    Replace system which are worthy of special note.

    We include here a brief description of these features.


    **************************************
    Including spaces within search strings
    **************************************

    Whenever you enter the HeliOS editor Find or Replace string gadgets
    the HeliOS system will automatically remove any spaces from after the
    end of any strings already entered in these gadgets.

    This feature is there to help beginners, who sometimes do not realise
    when an extra space has been typed after a string, and as a result may
    fail to get correct results when operating the Find/replace functions.

    Of course there are occasions when it is desirable to be able to search
    for a string followed by spaces, and this can be done quite easily.

    If you are entering a string in the Find or Replace sting gadgets, you
    can simply add as many spaces as you like and then press the<Return>
    key.  The spaces you just added will be included in the Find/Replace
    string for that particular Find/Replace operation.

    Subsequently, the spaces will be automatically removed as usual, so
    you will need to re-add them if you need to do another Find/Replace
    with spaces.

    Remember, then :

    * Trailing spaces will be retained on exit from a string gadget, but
      will be automatically removed on re-entry to that gadget.


    ****************************************************
    Copying strings between the Find and Replace gadgets
    ****************************************************

    The <F1> key can be used to copy strings between the string requesters
    in the Find/Replace control panel: this is worth remembering because it
    can save much of the time taken to retype the word in slightly different
    form.

    Pressing F1 when using the Search string gadget will copy the current
    contents of the Search string gadget into the Replace string gadget and
    then move the cursor down into the Replace string gadget.

    If the Replace string gadget is switched off (i.e. the Replace function
    is currently disabled) using F1 in the Search string will fully activate
    the Replace system before entering the Replace string gadget.

    Pressing F1 when using the Replace string gadget will copy the current
    contents of the Replace string gadget into the Search string gadget,
    while the cursor remains in the Replace string gadget.


    ****************************************************
    Including "Return" codes within Find/replace strings
    ****************************************************

    Sometimes it may be useful to search for a string and its associated
    line position with respect to the end or start of a line.

    For example, you may have many occurrences of a word with text, but
    only one occurrence in a key position as a title string on a line
    of its own, like this:

    Preceding text......................
    Preceding text......................
    Preceding text......................
    Preceding text......................

    MyTitleString

    Following text......................
    Following text......................
    Following text......................
    Following text......................

    If you wanted to search and find ONLY the occurrence of MyTitleString
    when it appears as a title, and not when it appears in general text,
    you would not be able to do a search for "MyTitleString", which would
    find ALL occurrences of the string.

    You would, in this case, need to search for a version of the string
    with two embedded "Return" codes and four preceding spaces, like this:

    ®    MyTitleString®
    ^                 ^
    |                 |
    --------------------------------<------- "Return" codes

    In the above example we have represented the "Return" codes, which are
    normally invisible, by using "®" characters.

    In fact, this is exactly how HeliOS allows you to include "Return"
    codes within the search string gadget.

    If you want to include a "Return" code in the search string, just type
    the "®" character, which is obtained by pressing the "r" key while
    holding down the "Alt" key:

    "®" = <Alt> + <r>
