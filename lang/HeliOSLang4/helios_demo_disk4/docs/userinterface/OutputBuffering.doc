*********************
Output text buffering
*********************

HeliOS allows all text output to the main interpreter window to be sent
additionally to an editable output buffer.

The output buffer is accessed normally via the "Out" editor, which is
a fully functional HeliOS editor with all normal editing functions such
as Load, Save, Cut/Copy/Paste, Print etc..

The "Out" editor normally acts as an editable interpreter "capture" buffer.

********************************
3(+1) Source/Compilation Editors
********************************

In functional terms you actually have three "normal" separate main editors,
plus another identical editor to which interpreter output is routed.

The interpreter and editor screens have buttons labelled "Ed 1", "Ed 2",
"Ed 3" and "Out" which highlight to indicate the current editor(s) in use.

The "Out" editor can be used as a fourth "normal" editor if you like, by
switching off the "Output buffer" from the Interpreter menus.

The "Out" editor button has a small red highlight to indicate that it is
currently in "Output buffer" mode with text currently being captured.

****************
The "Out" buffer
****************

The default option is to send all interpreter and/or program output text
to the "Output" uffer as well as to screen.  This function can be disabled
and saved as a default startup user-option.

The output buffer is fully editable, as already mentioned, and has its own
editor button: you can regard interpreter output as going straight into
the buffer of "Editor 4", where you can edit it exactly like any file.

Remember that the "Out" editor is absolutely identical to the other Editors,
and if you wish, you can at any time switch off the interpreter output to
"Out" and simple use it as an extra editor for source code editing.

The output buffer can be resized and cleared as required using Interpreter
menu options.

If the buffer becomes full during program execution you are given an option
to increase the buffer size.  If you do not increase the size you will lose
the earliest information as the buffer fills, and in general the buffer will
behave as a first-in-first-out text store.  In any single program execution
if you are asked whether you wish to resize the buffer and say "no", the
buffer will be treated as first-in-first-out for the rest of that execution
session.  In other words, once you have refused to enlarge the buffer you
will not be asked again during that particular program execution.

The output buffer can be cleared or resized at any time using an option
in the Interpreter menu.

***************
Session Markers
***************

The Interpreter Output can (optionally) include "Session Markers".

These "markers" include session numbers, time log comments, actual program
execution time information, and stack content displays.

The accuracy of the elapsed time display is only within 1 second, since
the session startup and end display code introduces sufficient variable
delay to make finer timing meaningless.  If you want to do accurate time
checks on your code you will need to use several iterations of a program
within one output session to improve accuracy.

The markers basically divide up and label each interpreter operation, so
that when you are scrolling through the output buffer you can see exactly
what happened and when it happened quite easily.

There are menu options for switching these markers and all the associated
information displays on and off, although you will generally find it most
worthwhile to retain them.

The "session log" numbering can be reset at any time using an Interpreter
menu option.


*****************
Output separators
*****************

Output can optionally have separator lines between each interpreter session.

These are mainly a visual aid to help identify easily the start and end
of each session and can be switched on or off as desired.
