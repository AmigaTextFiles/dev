Here are a few miscellaneous notes on the HeliOS user interface.

****************************
Restoring the screen display
****************************

Sometimes an errant program will damage the HeliOS screen display graphics
by overwriting them in some way.

There is a simple way of repairing the damage using the "Redo" function.

At the top of the screen display you will see the "Redo" button which is
a nice fast option for mouse users.

There is also a menu option for those who prefer using menus, and for the
keyboard enthusiasts there is the command "Amiga-R" to do the same thing.

If you want to force your program to redo the screen graphics from within
its code, you can use the FSTATUS command.

FSTATUS will rebuild the display and refresh the status information, and
you can use this command if you wish by typing it in at the command lines.


*************************
Versatile program control
*************************

The HeliOS V6 software has been designed to have:

1. A fast and easy gadget interface

2. A fully featured menu system

3. A comprehensive set of keyboard commands.

4. Powerful editor macro functions

5. Good user-configurability.

Whatever your preferences you should be able to get around faster and more
easily using the HeliOS V6 software than with most other Amiga programming
language user interfaces.

However, we are interested in hearing the views of anyone who can suggest
further enhancements to the HeliOS user interface, so let us know if you
have any good ideas on this subject.


***********************
Enhanced menu operation
***********************

The HeliOS V6 menus make use of layout to group related functions, the
menu items are well spaced, and there are keyboard equivalents for
all functions.

We have deliberately avoided using sub-menus where possible, improving
accessibility and ease of operation.

Note that in contrast to standard Amiga menus, HeliOS menus have the
following extra features:

1. They can make use of ANY command keys, not just a single Amiga key.

2. Command keys are all user specifiable from within the software or via
   an ASCII config file.

3. All menu texts are user specifiable via an ASCII config file.


************************
Responding to requesters
************************

Keyboard control of PROCEED/CANCEL requesters is via the "y" and "n" keys,
for those who do not want to leave the keyboard.
