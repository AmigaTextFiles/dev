***************************
Interpreter Control Buttons
***************************

At the top of the interpret window are a number of buttons.

These look fairly self-explanatory at first sight, but there are a few
subtleties and non-obvious features which need to be explained.


*************************
The editor select buttons
*************************

The four buttons which allow entry to the editors (3 Editors + "OUT" editor)
have several modes of action:


Single left mouse click  -  Enters the editor associated with that button
                            and highlights the button.

Double left mouse click  -  When inside an editor, enters and leaves the
                            "split screen" mode which allows you to view
                            two editors on screen together.

Single left mouse click  -  Compiles that editor using current compile mode
while holding down the      whether you are in interpret or edit mode.
right mouse button, the
<Ctrl> key, or the <Shift>
key.


*******************************************************************
Square button to left of editor buttons - the "Split screen" button
*******************************************************************

When you are in the interpreter, this button will take you back into "edit"
mode into the same configuration which you last set up within "edit" mode.
It acts as an instant return to your editor setup.

This button acts as a "split screen" toggle when you are actually within
an editor.

The imagery on this button indicates whether the current mode is "split"
or "single".


*******************
The "Colour" button
*******************

This simply brings up the colour requester.


******************
The "Redo" button
******************

This rebuilds the HeliOS screen display and is only used in the interpreter.


*****************
The "Help" button
*****************

1. Pressed alone.

Switches to "Help" mode, where accessing any menu or button will bring
up a short explanatory text.

2. Pressed with the <Ctrl> key.

Tries to display help, if available, on the word under the cursor.

See notes on the user editable Vocabulary Help file.


*****************
The "DBug" button
*****************

This changes the stack display bar into a set of debugger control buttons
and simultaneously enters debug mode.  You will then be in debug mode until
you press the "DBug" button again, which reverts to normal interpretation.


Debug buttons:

*************
Screen Output
*************
               - These buttons toggle debugger output streams
*************
Buffer Output
*************

The idea here is that when in debug mode, your program's normal screen
output will be stopped, and the screen will be used by the debugger to
print debug messages.  Similarly the "Out" buffer will get debug output.

If you switch off either of the Screen/Buffer output buttons, the normal
program output will be sent to that output stream rather than the debug
output.  Thus you can choose which output you want to see, and can view
one output while sending the other to the "Out" buffer.

These buttons can be pressed as your program is executing so that you can
alternate between output modes at will during a debugging session.  This
gives great flexibility to the system.

**********************************************
The "Step" button and associated string gadget
**********************************************

The step string gadget lets you set how many times the debugger will "skip"
between calls to the debug routines.  A setting of "1" will cause the debug
code to be run for every threaded word, a setting of "4" will sample every
fourth threading etc.

Again this can be altered at will as the program executes, and can also be
changed by the debug software.  Thus you could insert debug routines which
step through certain sections of code in large jumps until a "vital" part
of the program is reached, whereupon the debugger could be made under the
control of software to "automatically" change to single stepping.

The "Step" button, if switched "On", will cause the software to pause at
each debug entry point rather than free running.  Thus you can skip parts
of a program and return to debug "paused" mode by entering a certain value
into the string gadget, setting "Step" to "On", then pressing "Run".

Again this can be done interactively while the program is executing or
from within the software under debug program control.

****************
The "Run" button
****************

This starts the program executing after you have paused within debug mode.

This function is also available from program control.

******************
The "Pause" button
******************

This stops the program executing and pauses within debug mode.

This function is also available from program control.


******************
The "Abort" button
******************

This aborts the debug session and quits the program.

This function is also available from program control.


**********************************************
The "Dump" button and associated string gadget
**********************************************

This button lets you set up an address for a memory dump which can be
carried out by pressing the "Dump" button at any time while the program
is executing.

This function is also available from program control.

*****************
Interpreter Menus
*****************

******
HeliOS
******


HELP ON USER INTERFACE - Brings up mini-help texts on all buttons and menus

HELP ON VOCABULARY     - Brings up mini-help text on word under cursor

ABOUT             -  Program information


CORE VOCABULARY   -  Lists only the CORE dictionary in a columnar layout


USER VOCABULARY   -  Lists only the USER dictionary (words you have created)

                     This lists your words in order of creation.

FULL VOCABULARY   -  Lists the CORE dictionary followed by USER words


Note: All three above functions list to screen but do not go through the
      interpreter output stream. This means that they avoid interaction
      with the DEBUG functions and do not write to the "Out" buffer.

      The traditional Forth interpreter word VLIST lists the full
      vocabulary, with CORE words followed by USER words in order of
      creation.  This is equivalent to the FULL VOCABULARY menu option
      apart from the  difference in output streaming as mentioned above.

      HeliOS has two other CORE words, CVLIST and UVLIST to list CORE and
      USER vocabularies, which are equivalent to the menu functions.

      Using the words VLIST, CVLIST and UVLIST from the interpreter will
      send output to the "Out" buffer etc, so you may find occasions where
      this method is more useful than the menu option.


LOAD ENVIRONMENT    -  Load a user-environment-config file

SAVE ENVIRONMENT    -  Saves all user configuration settings as default

SAVE ENVIRONMENT AS -  Saves all user configuration settings to a file


Note: We wanted to avoid massive configuration requesters and complex user
      editable config files if possible, since beginners find such things
      overwhelming.

      Instead we have distributed all the configuration options within
      menus etc. wherever they are most appropriate.

      There is a question of philosophy here: it is easy to allow for great
      user-configurability, but at the expense of the program becoming to
      some extent unwieldy and over-complex to set up.  Alternatively we can
      make certain decisions on behalf of the user.......which may not be to
      everyone's taste.

      There always has to be a cut-off point, and we would like opinions
      from those users who would like to see specific areas of the program
      made more configurable.
