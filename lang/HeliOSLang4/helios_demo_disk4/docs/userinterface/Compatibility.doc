Compatibility
*************

First the good news on compatibility.  Contrary to the increasing "elitist"
trend, Helios Software have no intention of abandoning 1.3 users and those
with smaller Amigas.

We do recommend that 1.3 users should try to upgrade as soon as possible,
but in the meantime you can use HeliOS with no serious disadvantage in
terms of available commands etc.

HeliOS V6.xx should run on all 1+ meg Amigas, whatever the OS version,
and on all CPU types.  If it doesn't, please let us know your problem, and
we will attempt to help you diagnose the trouble.

HeliOS has been in constant development for 5 years, and is fundamentally
a very stable program on all Amigas.  It has been used on every version
of the OS and on all memory configurations.

In general HeliOS is very fast in terms of code execution, so less powerful
Amigas will run HeliOS code better than that created by the slower "C" or
"Basic" programming languages.

The new HeliOS integrated software has been designed around the principle
of providing speed, power, and user friendliness.  In maximising these
aspects of the software we have willingly traded memory usage, so the
current version of the program is quite large and uses quite a lot of
memory.  This is not a problem on new Amigas, but 1 meg machines will
have relatively severe restrictions in terms of using HeliOS to write
large programs or when multitasking with other software.

Helios Software can provide limited solutions to this problem in the
form of stand-alone compilation and execution modules, and we are even
prepared to supply older, less memory hungry, versions of the software
to those who are really short of memory but still want to learn to program
the Amiga using HeliOS.  In these cases you must be aware that many of the
newer HeliOS features will not be available, and the older software is no
longer supported in terms of bug-fixes and general development.


*************
Look and feel
*************

We have not tried to maintain compatibility in terms of "look and feel"
with gadtools-oriented standard Amiga interface designs.

This is partly a deliberate and wilful gesture of originality - why should
all software look identical anyway?

We do indeed favour individualism, but there are other more technical
reasons for this approach too.

There is, for example, the consideration of all-machine compatibility,
which cannot be maintained so easily using the newer OS user interface
software tools.

There is also the matter of functionality. It is undeniable that many of
the OS user interface creation software tools are seriously flawed, and
tend to limit the best efforts of all who try to use them.  It is a fact
that the HeliOS V6 interface could simply not have been written efficiently,
if at all, using standard OS routines.

Finally, there is the matter of appearance and functionality.  In our
view the now common "typical" Amiga interface is not even particularly
attractive or functionally efficient.

Note that all the things you see in the HeliOS V6 user interface are
available for you to use in your own programs, even on 1.3 machines.

Of course HeliOS will allow you to write code for the more standard Amiga
gadtools-style interface if you wish.

Your comments on this matter of "look and feel" for future versions of
HeliOS are invited because we appreciate that questions of "standardised"
user interfaces are fashionable and controversial.

If you do not like the HeliOS user interface, let us know.....
