*****************
The Stack Display
*****************

In HeliOS you have a continuous on-screen display of the stack in a strip 
along the top of the Interpreter display window.

The top ten stack items are displayed, with the top-of-stack item shown in
red, and the number of items on the stack shown in yellow.

This stack display is replaced by the DEBUG control panel when you enter
"debug" mode.

The stack display always shows the current stack status, and is very useful
for beginners who are unsure of how the stack works.

In fact, this feature of HeliOS is ENTIRELY for the benefit of beginners,
because once you are experienced with stack manipulation you will rarely
need a full graphical display such as this.

In fact, the rest of this text on the stack is aimed at the beginner......

The biggest single difficulty the beginner with a stack-oriented language
faces seems always to lie in grasping how the stack works.  The first
thing any commentator or reviewer always points out about Forth is the
difficulty of using the stack and reverse Polish notation, and in general
there is a negative "fear" of this topic in most beginner's minds before
they even get started.

Perhaps you too have been assailed by doubts about these matters?

This initial confusion and "fear" can present quite unnecessary and even
insurmountable problems in some cases, which is a great pity because the
stack really is very easy to understand once you can see exactly what
is happening.  It is actually utterly trivial and simple, so forget all
jargon and complicated explanations you have read and learn by practise.

HeliOS is unashamedly dedicated to helping the beginner rather than
presenting a highly "difficult" image to impress by sheer complication as
many languages do.  Programming can be easy and pleasurable, and we hope
you will appreciate how easy the stack can be by using the excellent
stack display included just for your benefit!

Many texts on Forth, when trying to describe stack concepts and "reverse
Polish notation", struggle to explain the stack with all manner of diagrams
and analogies.  The fact is that without anything concrete to see, and
only abstract highly technical explanations to help, often the poor student
is left bemused.  Just looking at a string of confusing stack operators on
the page of a book, accompanied by an often frightening and complicated 
explanation is not at all helpful.

Many would-be Forth programmers give up at this stage, but in fact the use
of a stack to pass parameters is very simple if you approach it with an
open mind and a freedom from all the usual associated jargon.

Forget all the talk of "reverse Polish notation" which you might have read,
and simply sit at your Amiga and experiment with the stack for yourself.

Just type in a few numbers and observe the stack display.  Use a few of
the simple arithmetic operators such as "+" or "-" and watch what happens
to the numbers on the stack.

Use a few of the simple stack operators like DUP and ROT and watch how
they affect numbers on the stack.  Try to build up just a small repertoire
of commands which you understand before trying to learn too many of the
more complex operators.

Spend just a few hours "playing" wiuth the stack and once you are used to
seeing a "concrete" display of what is happening, the use of the stack will
become very clear.

HeliOS Stack Control Words
**************************

There seem to be an awful lot of these, but they are very easy to use
and learn, and are very, very important in the production of efficient
and readable HeliOS code.

Use these words to MINIMISE THE NUMBER OF STACK MANIPULATION WORDS which
you employ.

DO NOT write long strings of DUPs and SWAPs and ROTs, as this produces
grotesquely unreadable code and is horrifyingly inefficient, since these
words contribute exactly nothing to getting the logical task done, being
merely an undesirable OVERHEAD of any Forth based system.

So....always use ONE word if possible instead of several.

N.B.

ALL the HeliOS stack management words are machine coded for speed, as
distinct from most Forth systems, where words like ROLL, for example, if
they are present at all, are often coded in slower high-level Forth.

This has rightly led to their use being generally condemned as grossly
inefficient in terms of CPU time, but in HeliOS all the stack management
words are machine coded and ultra  efficient, so use the words which give
you simplest operation.

The "less stack control words used the better" is a good rule!

"Keep the stack small" is another good rule!

If your program stack gets very big you should probably be doing things
another way, such as using named variables.  It is not "macho" or clever
to "think" you can handle huge stacks with complicated stack control code.
This sort of thing is merely going to land you in trouble with buggy code
which is hard to read and change, so if you have more than three or four
items on the stack, think carefully about why!

Good HeliOS programming starts (and often stops!) here, so really get to
know as many stack control words as possible so that their use becomes
second nature.

Set yourself up a dummy stack in Interactive mode and play with the stack
control words you are not sure of until you see clearly how they work.
