********************************
The HeliOS screen uses 8 colours
********************************

This feature of HeliOS offers a more attractive program environment
than the traditional four colour screen, and gives you more scope with
graphical output to the HeliOS screen.

Since HeliOS uses interactive interpreted software output which often
writes to the HeliOS screen display, the use of 8 colours gives more
scope for creativity and experimentation.  This is a consideration quite
alien to most Amiga programming systems which are dull and functional
in terms of merely technical performance.

The use of 8 colours has brought a slight performance penalty within the
interpreter, since the Amiga console device has rather slow text handling,
but overall the benefits of having more colours outweigh the disadvantages.

Most modern Amigas have plenty of memory, so the extra graphics memory
useage is not a serious consideration.


*************
Colour choice
*************

There is a flexible colour selection and preset system within the HeliOS
software, but inevitably selecting a set of colours which work well in all
circumstances is difficult.

We have desiged the interface so that using different colours a reasonable
appearance can be fairly easily maintained with a little care.

The idea is that there are three colours (Colours 0, 3 and 4) which form
a graded intensity range within a given colour tone.  You can set these
three colours to your own choice, preferably keeping the light, medium and
dark colours as 0, 4 and 3, in that order.  Having set these colours it
is quite easy to modify the remaining ones as required to maintain a nice
harmonious appearance.

Of course you can change ALL the colours if you like.........

************************
The colour control panel
************************

The colour controls consist of a standard set of palette controls with
RGB sliders, and a set of 5 preset colour palettes each of which can be
changed and saved.

There is a save button to which saves all the current 5 palette preset
colour settings along with the currently selected preset.

All colour configuration files saved can be reloaded at any time or used
as a default startup colour configuration file.

See the "InitialSetup.doc" file for instructions on how to set up a startup
default color file.

The RESET button on the colour control panel will reset the currently
selected preset palette to its original HeliOS system default colours.

The UNDO button on the colour control panel will reset the currently
selected preset palette to the colour settings it had before entering
the colour control panel this time.
