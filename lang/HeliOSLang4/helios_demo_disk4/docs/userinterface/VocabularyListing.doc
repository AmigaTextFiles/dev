Vocabulary listing
******************

HeliOS has functions to list both CORE and USER vocabularies in a neat 
columnar format.

Note that the USER vocabulary lists all the words which you have created,
or, in other words, all words compiled on top of the CORE vocabulary.

The USER vocabulary is always listed in the order in which each word was
originally added to the dictionary.

There are two HeliOS CORE words, CVLIST and UVLIST to list CORE and USER
vocabularies specifically, and these are equivalent to the menu functions.

The traditional Forth interpreter word VLIST can be used to list the full
vocabulary, with CORE words followed by USER words in order of creation.

The menu vocabulary list options have been deliberately prevented from
writing to the output stream, so as to allow you to view the vocabulary
listing as often as you like without cluttering up the output buffer.

If you do want to send vocabulary listing to the output buffer, use the
command line words UVLIST, CVLIST and VLIST, which do send output to the
output buffer.
