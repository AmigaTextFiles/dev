******************
Keyboard shortcuts
******************

There are a lot of keyboard shortcuts, some of which are displayed as
menu command keys, and others of which are independent of the menus.

The general text control keyboard shortcuts are documented within the
program via a dummy editor menu called "Key Index".

Macros can be used to change or extend these shortcuts as required.

All shortcuts are defined in an ASCII file called "HeliOS_KeyTable.

Shortcuts can be changed by editing this ASCII file, or by using the key
rebinding functions from within the software.  New ASCII keytable files
can be created and saved at any time.

Menu texts can now be changed to correctly reflect new shortcuts: these
texts are all defined in a file called "HeliOS_MenuText".

The "KeyTable" and "MenuText" files are freely editable ASCII files, and
instructions are contained in each file for how to edit them.

See the "InitialSetup.doc" for instructions on how to set startup default
KeyTable and MenuText files.
