Configurability of the user interface in terms of screen layout.
****************************************************************

The question of whether or not the HeliOS interpreter/editor environment
should remain fixed in terms of screen layout or should be made fully
configurable is an interesting one.

In an ideal world, of course it would be nice to have an auto-configuring
user interface which adapted to user preferences for fonts and screen mode.

Unfortunately the penalties for providing this configurabilty would be
rather severe.

The HeliOS system has been designed and painstakingly evolved over many
years, and has arrived at its current design as the most ideal compromise
bearing in mind the following essential criteria:

1. Compatibility with all Amiga OS versions from 1.2 onwards.

   (Yes, we do indeed have many faithful 1.3 users still out there.....)

2. Ability to run in 1 meg memory.

   (The GUI code already forms an uncomfortably large portion of the
   HeliOS memory consumption, and a fully auto-configuring user interface
   would be far worse still in this respect.)

3. Bug free operation.

   (The present GUI is all hand coded so that any bugs can be fully
    repaired.  The use of "external" and severely bug-ridden GUI code
    such as provided by GadTools or MUI would mean that HeliOS would
    suffer to an unacceptable degree from unfixable bugs and limitations
    beyond our control.)

4. Speed and efficiency of operation even on lesser powered Amigas.

   (Compare the scrolling of Amiga Mosaic with HeliOS!  In fact compare
    ANY scaleable GUI Amiga text editor with HeliOS and you will see the
    advantage of the smooth scrolling, which is far easier to read and
    less tiring on the eyes during long editing sessions.)

5. HiResLace displays are not good for serious text editing for reasons
   of general readability and speed of operation, so the current standard
   HiRes text display is pleasing to most users for practical reasons.

6. A reasonably fast-operating, bug free, fully configurable user interface
   hand-coded in assembly language (as is the rest of HeliOS) would take
   a considerable programming effort.  We feel that development time can be
   more productively spent in advancing the many planned areas of improved
   functionality for the HeliOS language command set.
