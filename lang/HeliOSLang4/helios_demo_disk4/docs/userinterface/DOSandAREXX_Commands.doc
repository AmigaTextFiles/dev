******************
DOS/AREXX commands
******************

There are several provisions within HeliOS for executing DOS or AREXX
commands, either from the user interface or from your software.

DOS and AREXX commands can be executed in the following ways:

1. Using menu options in the editor or interpreter.

2. As a macro via a command key in the editor or interpreter.

3. From the interpreter command line using the word DOSCMD.

4. Inside a program using the word DOSCMD.

5. Inside an editor by highlighting and compiling a DOSCMD statement.

*********************
Command string length
*********************

DOS/AREXX command strings may be up to 100 characters in length.

***********************************
Automatic sensing of AREXX commands
***********************************

HeliOS supports an automatic DOS/AREXX command execution system which will
try to distinguish DOS from AREXX commands and run them appropriately.

HeliOS will treat any command as an AREXX function:

1. If the command name has a ".rexx" suffix.

2. If the command file is in the "REXX:" directory.

Otherwise the command will be treated as a normal DOS function.

*************************
Creating DOS/AREXX macros
*************************

DOS/AREXX macros can only be created and attached to command keys in the
editor environment using the "Set DOS/AREXX macro" menu option.

DOS/AREXX macros can be saved as usual along with all other macros.

************************
Running DOS/AREXX macros
************************

Although DOS/AREXX  macros may only be created in the editor, they can be
executed either from within an editor or from the interpreter environment.

**************************************************************************
Special "HeliOS command line" feature of menu and macro DOS/AREXX commands
**************************************************************************

When you execute a DOS/AREXX command from a macro or the menu option the
command line may be set up by a special code word to run as a HeliOS code
line instead of a DOS or AREXX command line.

In normal circumstances, unless the special code word is included at the
start of the command line, the operation defaults to the DOS/AREXX command
as explained above.  However, by including the special code at the start of
the line all the rest of the line will be interpreted as HeliOS code.

If you are in an editor when the DOS command is evoked, and if you specify
that this is a HeliOS command line, you will be taken out of the editor into
the interpreter before your command line is executed.

The special code must consist of either 'H>' or 'E>', and must be placed at
the very start of the command line.

There are two different codes because the execution of the HeliOS command
line can be carried out in two ways, as follows:

Using the   H>  command ->  The interpreter goes through a full "session"
                            procedure exactly as if you had typed the line
                            of commands at the interpreter command line.

Using the   E>  command ->  The interpreter runs the code line without any
                            of the auxiliary actions associated with normal
                            interpreter sessions.

The E> command is useful if you want to run a command without explicitly
performing an interpret cycle, such as when you evoke the command from an
editor and your command line is to load a file into another editor.

For example, suppose you executed these command lines from an editor macro:

H> 3 EDIT S:Startup-sequence

or

E> 3 EDIT S:Startup-sequence

Both these would end up placing you in Editor3 with the startup-sequence
file loaded ready to edit.

Using the H> version you would leave the editor you were in and go out into
the interpreter, then you would see the interpreter go through its full
session cycle, then you would then return to the editor environment with
your new file in Editor3.

Using the E> version you would move directly to the new editor without
going through the interpreter session: although the E> procedure does go
via the interpreter, no explicit interpreter session cycle is carried out.

The latter action is preferable because it is quicker and less visually
distracting.

Using this general mechanism using H> and E> it is easy to set up hot-keys
to carry out commonly required HeliOS functions.

For example, you might want to set up a special command key to perform the
"FORGET **CORE**" function, so you could simply create a DOS macro with the
following command line:

E> FORGET **CORE**

Remember that you can only create a DOS macro within an editor, but you can
USE the macro either in the editor or interpreter.
