     What changed from 2.0 to 1.3:
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      1. The Code is completly changed. First it compiles the rexx program
         in a forth-like language and then it interprets this code.
      2. You should see an large increase in the speed.
      3. It needs a little bit more memory than before.
      4. It follows most of the ANSI/REXX standards.
      5. NUMERIC DIGITS is still not supported.
      6. The code is written in a more cleaner and structured way
         allowing the user easily to write it's own routines or even
         to include rexx as a macro language inside a program.
      7. There is a new "lstring" library (Length Prefixed strings) with
         all the available functions in rexx which can be used by any kind
         of program that does strings processing.
      8. Paradox is no longer supported.
      9. Long filenames and 32-bit code for WIN-95, NT etc.
