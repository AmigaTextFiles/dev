EasyRapa v 1.1 from Sandro Barbagelata (sb5@libero.it)

For Hollywood coders only. 
This program provide an interface to handle all the main parameters 
of the the RapaGui commands (for the moment only a subset) 
in order to automatically generate HWS and XML source files customized
according your choices.
Scope of the program is to avoid most of the boring activities before 
obtaining a properly configurated Hollywood form.
The generated HWS file is only a skeleton, but fully structured and 
referring to the ID and data declared. It will be the starting point 
for your application.

Classes actually supported:
Menus 		Toolbar		Checkbox	Radio
Icons		Label		Text		Holliwood
Buttons		Textentry	Textview	Listview 
Window		Choice		Combobox	Htmlview
H/VLine		Image		Pageview 

Obviously the RapaGui functionalities implementation in programs is
reflecting my level of knoledge (improving day by day but anyhow limited)

Project page
Window definition must be always on line 1 of the project text. Its 
settings can be changed by clicking on the line and then on the param-
eters button (as per any other line)
Second line is reserved for a pageview at higher level (this can be 
ignored by clicking off the tick on Windows definition "Has_Pages")

Classes definitions
Each class, handled by the program, has a definition file (stored in the 
definition directory). New classes can be added by adding a definition 
file and will be automatically handled by the program as interface and 
data storing, proving that ll the used attributes are already used by the
program. In this case should work out of the box. For new attributes types 
program must be updated. Chritical area is the post processor to generate 
the hws and xml file may needs to be customized.

Definition files are structured as follow:
File name is the class name.txt
First 4 lines are mandatory and equal for each class including :
ID,           , 
GridR,        , 
GridC,        , 
Page,         ,

Each record has 3 fields
the entity name (that is the same of the class attribute)
a default value if any
action command if any (default would be a textbox)

Custom entity names are:
Mchoice used for a multi choices box is tipically used for notifications
tipical sysntax is: notify,0|0|0,MChoice|Active|TitlClick|AbortEditing
Note thea the default values (divided by|) must be in the same number as
the options following the MChoice entry.

Other fields can be freely added to the definition file, but in this way
previous project files will loose compatibility (they need to be correct 
manually by editing the single project lines trough the meny entry Edit). 
New fields shuold be anyway added at the bottom of the definition list
and not inserted, because some fields position can be hard coded in the 
post processor code.

Macros
With release 1.1 the macros are added. They are piece of custom code that
con be appended to the buttons, icons and menus. Library can be improved
by user adding a text file in the sub directory macro.

Note thet the name of the function must be macroname as it will be replace 
with his specific name by the program.

Using macros the test funcionality of the program may not work missing 
some data required by the macro function. This will be part of the coding.
 A macro named "__Remove macro selection.txt" nust be left as it is and 
not deleted as it is necessary to blank the macro selection in the class
parameter dialog.
