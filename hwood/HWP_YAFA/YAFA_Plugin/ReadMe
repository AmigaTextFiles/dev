========

This plugin allows you to load and play IFF YAFA anims (created by Wildfire)
with Hollywood. This makes it possible for the first time to view these cool
animations on NG Amiga, Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS systems without
the need to use an emulator!

All known IFF YAFA formats are supported including the undocumented hi-
and true colour extensions introduced in Wildfire 7. Here are some features:

* support for planar, chunky, 15bit, and 24bit YAFA anims
* support for byte, word, and longword delta compression
* HAM6 and HAM8 modes fully supported
* anims that use a dynamic palette are supported
* support for timestamped anims
* native decompressor for XPK FAST, NUKE, and RAKE packed anims;
  xpkmaster.library is not necessary!
* native decompressor for StoneCracker 4.04 packed anims


History
=======

Version 1.2:    (18-May-23)
- Change: Amiga installer will now also copy the plugins for all platforms to the
  linker plugins directory so that they can be easily linked to executables
- Change [iOS]: Added arm64 build for the iOS simulator and removed x86 build for
  the iOS simulator because the iOS simulator is no longer compatible with x86
- Change [Android]: Removed build for 32-bit softfloat ARM; nobody uses this any
  longer these days
- New [macOS]: Added build for macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon) 
- New: Added support for Hollywood 10's ability to get the anim format name; when
  querying #ATTRFORMAT for anims loaded using the plugin you'll get "YAFA" now
- New: Plugin supports Hollywood 10's user tag interface for file adapters now;
  all user tags will be forwarded to the corresponding file adapters now
- New: Hollywood 9.0's new "LoadPalette" tag is now supported

Version 1.1:    (02-Jul-15)
- New [Linux]: Added build for Linux ARM
- Fix [Linux/MacOS]: Plugin is now compiled as position-independent code (PIC)
- Fix [OS3]: FPU version will cleanly exit now in case there is no FPU
- New: Added support for adapter-specific file loading (requires Hollywood 6.0)

Version 1.0:    (21-Feb-14)
- First release
