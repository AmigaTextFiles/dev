moviesetter.hwp
===============

This plugin enables Hollywood to load and play animations in Gold Disk's Movie Setter
format. Movie Setter is renowned in the Amiga community because it is the tool which
Eric W. Schwartz used to create his legendary clips like the Aerotoons, Flip the Frog
and Clarisse Cat, Sabrina, the intro of Team17's Superfrog, the Anti Lemmin' Demo,
and of course the Juggette clips. Unfortunately, the original player written by Gold
Disk bangs the hardware quite a lot and thus doesn't run on modern systems. But with
the Movie Setter for Hollywood plugin you can now for the very first time experience
Eric W. Schwartz's great animations in all their glory on your AmigaOS 4 or MorphOS
system - fully PPC native with retargetable audio through AHI and RTG graphics as
well! 

Once moviesetter.hwp is installed, Hollywood will 'automagically' be able to open
Movie Setter animations. Since Movie Setter animations contain sound as well, you
will have to use OpenVideo() to open them and PlayVideo() to play them in Hollywood.


History
=======

Version 1.2:    (01-Jul-15)
- New [Linux]: Added build for Linux ARM
- Fix [Linux/MacOS]: Plugin is now compiled as position-independent code (PIC)
- Fix [OS3]: FPU version will cleanly exit now in case there is no FPU
- New: Added support for adapter-specific file loading (requires Hollywood 6.0)

Version 1.1:    (21-Apr-12)
- Fix: MovieSetter allowed frame timings much faster than the player could handle on an
  A500; these timings are now corrected to values that reflect actual playback speed on
  an A500; the Lemmin' Revenge anim runs correctly now with this fix!

Version 1.0:    (06-Apr-12)
- First release
