=============

This plugin enables Hollywood to load and play Ogg Theora video files. After this
plugin has been installed, Hollywood will 'automagically' be able to open and play
Ogg Theora video streams using OpenVideo() and PlayVideo().

Note that there is no Android version of this plugin because the Android version
of Hollywood can play Ogg Theora streams by default.
