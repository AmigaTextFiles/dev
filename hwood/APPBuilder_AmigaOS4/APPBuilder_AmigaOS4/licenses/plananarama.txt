Plananarama 2.0
===============

The Plananarama plugin allows Hollywood to run on planar (palette) screens. This
finally makes it possible to run Hollywood scripts on plain AGA or ECS systems
with no graphics board installed - for the first time since Hollywood 1.93
(released in March 2005)! Starting with version 2.0, Hollywood required CyberGraphX
or Picasso96 to run. Since then, many people have asked for a revival of Hollywood's
planar engine, so here it is, a real blast from the past! Thanks to Hollywood 6's
greatly extended plugin API this feature could be implemented completely in plugin
space. Once Plananarama is installed, all Hollywood scripts will 'automagically'
run on palette screens again! All resolutions are supported - from 8-bit LowRes to
1-bit productivity SuperHighRes Interlace.

Starting with Plananarama 2.0 it is also possible to get direct access to the
screen's palette pens when it is running in fullscreen mode. This allows you to draw
directly using the screen's palette without the need for any color remapping so
drawing will become much faster. Also, it's possible to create nice palette effects
by changing pens, e.g. it's possible to fade or cycle colors with almost no CPU load
because in palette mode, Plananarama can directly modify the hardware's color register
instead of having to redraw everything when colors change (as it needs to be done
for real TrueColour graphics).

Also, Plananarama 2.0 introduces support for real hardware sprites. When using hardware
sprites, the Amiga's custom chip hardware is used to draw the sprites which allows your
script to draw sprites in next to no time with almost no CPU load.

All of this makes Plananarama the ultimate plugin for targetting classic Amiga systems
that don't have a graphics board installed.
