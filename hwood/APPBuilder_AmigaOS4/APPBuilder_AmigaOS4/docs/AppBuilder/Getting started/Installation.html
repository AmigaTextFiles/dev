     <h1>Installation</h1>

    <p>APPBuilder does not need any installation procedure, you have to extract
      the zipped archive package into a folder of your choice.
      <br>Once you have extracted the contents you should find in the destination
      folder the following items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>APPBuilder</strong> (APPBuilder.exe for Windows version)
        <br>This is the main program, the one you have to execute to start the application</li>
      <li><strong>config</strong>
        <br>This file is used by APPBuilder to store its configuration, in most recent
        version this file is saved in the AppDir of your system.</li>
      <li><strong>licenses</strong>
        <br>This folder holds all plugins licenses</li>
      <li><strong>plugins</strong>
