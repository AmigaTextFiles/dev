     <h1>System requirements</h1>

    <p>Here are the requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hollywood : This is obvious if you want to build Hollywood projects, the
        latest version has been tested with Hollywood 10, it may not work correctly
        in the previous Hollywood version.</li>
      <li>Screen resolution : 800x600 or greater</li>
      <li>7zip installed on your system : This is needed if you want to pack your
        application builds in zipped archives</li>
      <li>If you are going to run the application on a real Amiga you will also
        need:
        <ul>
          <li>RTG System</li>
          <li>Some additional fast memory (&gt;8 Mb)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <br>
      <br>That's all.</p>
