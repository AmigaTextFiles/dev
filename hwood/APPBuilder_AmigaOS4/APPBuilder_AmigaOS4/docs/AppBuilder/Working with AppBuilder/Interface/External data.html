    <p>External data is used to include in the distribution package everything
      you want outside the main build folder for example a readme.txt file.</p>
    <p>All files and folders you will include in this list will be packed outside
      the application folder for easy accessibility by the final user. &nbsp;These
      resources will be seen by the user before the executable so it's a good
      idea to add data that is not needed by your application to run here, like
      instructions, readmes, licenses and so on.</p>
    <p>Like what you have seen for the resources area you have buttons to manage
      files and folders to add or remove to/from the list.</p>
