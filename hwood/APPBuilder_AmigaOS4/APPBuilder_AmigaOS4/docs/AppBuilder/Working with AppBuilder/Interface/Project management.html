     <h1>Project management</h1>

    <p>Let's see what's in the left buttons column.</p>
    <p>The top left buttons column has all you need to manage your projects:</p>
    <figure

      <p>This group, called “Project” features the following buttons:</p>
      <p>- <strong>LOAD</strong> : Click it to load a previously created project
        <br>- <strong>SAVE</strong> : Click it to save the current project using the
        same file name if it's an existing project or the program will ask you
        for a new project file name.
        <br>- <strong>SAVE AS</strong> : Click it to save the current project with another
        name
        <br>- <strong>CLEAN</strong> : Click this button to clean the interface ant
        to clear all the project's fields, switches &amp; resources.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The middle group is called “Switches” and allow you to enable/disable
        some compilation flags along with some other useful options:</p>

        </figure>
        <p>- <strong>COMPRESSION</strong> : If enabled the built executable will be
          compressed (Hollywood inbuilt feature)
          <br>- <strong>PACK</strong> : If enabled the program will produces for you a
          zip archive with the built application, one for each target platform. Note
          that this function will use the 7zip executable you have specified in the
          configuration window.
          <br>- <strong>CONSOLE MODE</strong> : If enabled Hollywood will build the executable
          as a console program, it is useful only for Windows targets and it is a
          new flag introduced with Hollywood 10.
          <br>- <strong>LOCK SETTINGS</strong> : If enabled the compiled application will
          have a lock that not allow the final user to use some flags when running
          the application from a terminal or from a shell.
