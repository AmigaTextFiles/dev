This plugin allows Hollywood to load and save images in the TIFF image format.

Usage is simple: Once this plugin has been installed, Hollywood will be able to
load *.tif images on the fly.

If you want to save images in the *.tif format, use one of the constants #IMGFMT_TIFF,
#IMGFMT_TIFFJPEG, #IMGFMT_TIFFFLATE that this plugin makes available once loaded. For
example:

    SaveBrush(1, "test.tif", 0, #IMGFMT_TIFF)

Note that #IMGFMT_TIFF and #IMGFMT_TIFFFLATE both use lossless compression. #IMGFMT_TIFFJPEG,
however, is lossy. You can use the "Quality" tag to set the compression level in
that case. Palette images can only be saved using the #IMGFMT_TIFF and #IMGFMT_TIFFFLATE
modes because JPEG doesn't support palette images.

The TIFF format	supports alpha channel graphics. If you want to load a TIFF with
alpha channel, simply set the "LoadAlpha" field to TRUE. If you want to save a brush
that has an alpha channel using #IMGFMT_TIFF, the TIFF plugin will automatically
create a TIFF image with an alpha channel for you.

By default, palette-based TIFF images will be loaded and stored as true colour images.
If you want to have the raw palette-based pixels instead, set Hollywood's "LoadPalette"
tag to TRUE in commands like LoadBrush().


History
=======

Version 1.2:    (18-May-23)
- Change: Amiga installer will now also copy the plugins for all platforms to Hollywood's linker
  plugins directory so that they can be easily linked to executables
- Change [iOS]: Added arm64 build for the iOS simulator and removed x86 build for the iOS simulator
  because the iOS simulator is no longer compatible with x86
- Change [Android]: Removed build for 32-bit softfloat ARM; nobody uses this any longer these days
- New [macOS]: Added build for macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon) 
- New: Added support for Hollywood 10's ability to get the image format name; getting #ATTRFORMAT
  for images loaded using the plugin will now return "TIFF"
- New: Plugin supports Hollywood 10's user tag interface for file adapters now; all user tags
  will be forwarded to the corresponding file adapters now
- New: Added support for adapter-specific file saving (requires Hollywood 10)
- New: Plugin can now save palette-based images now; this is only supported for #IMGFMT_TIFF
  and #IMGFMT_TIFFFLATE; #IMGFMT_TIFFJPEG doesn't support palette-based pixel data because
  JPEG doesn't support that; note that this feature requires Hollywood 9.0 or better
- New: Hollywood 9.0's new "LoadPalette" tag is now supported

Version 1.1:    (01-Jul-15)
- New [Linux]: Added build for Linux ARM
- Fix [Linux/MacOS]: Plugin is now compiled as position-independent code (PIC)
- Fix [OS3]: FPU version will cleanly exit now in case there is no FPU
- New: Added support for adapter-specific file loading (requires Hollywood 6.0)
- Fix: IsPicture() didn't return correct width, height, and alpha channel information
- New: Added support for writing JPEG and FLATE compressed images; use #IMGFMT_TIFFJPEG and
  #IMGFMT_TIFFFLATE to access these new savers; the #IMGFMT_TIFFJPEG saver supports the
  "Quality" tag and also alpha channel images (requires Hollywood 5.3)
- New: Added support for loading JPEG and FLATE compressed images (requires Hollywood 5.3)
- New: Added file types information for Hollywood 5.3
