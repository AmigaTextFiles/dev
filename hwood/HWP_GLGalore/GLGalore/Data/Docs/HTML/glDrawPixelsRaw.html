gl.DrawPixelsRaw -- write a block of pixels to the frame buffer</dd>
<dt class="autodoc"><b>Synopsis</b></dt><dd>
<pre>
gl.DrawPixelsRaw(width, height, format, type, pixels)</pre>
</dd>
<dt class="autodoc"><b>Function</b></dt><dd>
<code>gl.DrawPixelsRaw()</code> reads pixel data from memory and writes it into the frame buffer relative to the current
raster position, provided that the raster position is valid. Use <a href="glRasterPos.html">gl.RasterPos()</a> to
set the current raster position; use <a href="glGet.html">gl.Get()</a> with argument <code>#GL_CURRENT_RASTER_POSITION_VALID</code>
to determine if the specified raster position is valid, and <a href="glGet.html">gl.Get()</a> with argument <code>#GL_CURRENT_RASTER_POSITION</code>
to query the raster position.

<p>
Several parameters define the encoding of pixel data in memory and control the processing of the pixel
data before it is placed in the frame buffer. These parameters are set with four commands: <a href="glPixelStore.html">gl.PixelStore()</a>,
<a href="glPixelTransfer.html">gl.PixelTransfer()</a>, <a href="glPixelMap.html">gl.PixelMap()</a>, and <a href="glPixelZoom.html">gl.PixelZoom()</a>.
This reference page describes the effects on <code>gl.DrawPixelsRaw()</code> of many, but not all, of the parameters
specified by these four commands.

<p>
Data is read from <code>pixels</code> as a sequence of signed or unsigned bytes, signed or unsigned shorts, signed or unsigned
integers, or single-precision floating-point values, depending on <code>type</code> which can be <code>#GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</code>, <code>#GL_BYTE</code>, <code>#GL_BITMAP</code>,
<code>#GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT</code>, <code>#GL_SHORT</code>, <code>#GL_UNSIGNED_INT</code>, <code>#GL_INT</code>, or <code>#GL_FLOAT</code>. Each of these bytes, shorts, integers, or floating-point
values is interpreted as one color or depth component, or one index, depending on format. Indices are always treated
individually. Color components are treated as groups of one, two, three, or four values, again based on <code>format</code>. Both
individual indices and groups of components are referred to as pixels. If type is <code>#GL_BITMAP</code>, the data must be unsigned
bytes, and format must be either <code>#GL_COLOR_INDEX</code> or <code>#GL_STENCIL_INDEX</code>. Each unsigned byte is treated as eight 1-bit pixels,
with bit ordering determined by <code>#GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST</code> (See <a href="glPixelStore.html">gl.PixelStore</a> for details.).

<p>
<code>width</code> * <code>height</code> pixels are read from memory, starting at location <code>pixels</code>. By default, these pixels are taken from
adjacent memory locations, except that after all width pixels are read, the read pointer is advanced to the next
four-byte boundary. The four-byte row alignment is specified by <a href="glPixelStore.html">gl.PixelStore()</a> with argument
<code>#GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT</code>, and it can be set to one, two, four, or eight bytes. Other pixel store parameters specify
different read pointer advancements, both before the first pixel is read and after all width pixels are read.
See <a href="glPixelStore.html">gl.PixelStore</a> for details.

<p>
The <code>width</code> * <code>height</code> pixels that are read from memory are each operated on in the same way, based on the values
of several parameters specified by <a href="glPixelTransfer.html">gl.PixelTransfer()</a> and <a href="glPixelMap.html">gl.PixelMap()</a>.
The details of these operations, as well as the target buffer into which the pixels are drawn, are specific to the
format of the pixels, as specified by <code>format</code>. <code>format</code> can assume one of 13 symbolic values:

<p>
<dl>
<dt class="codelist"><code>#GL_COLOR_INDEX</code></dt>
<dd>
Each pixel is a single value, a color index. It is converted to fixed-point format, with an unspecified number of
bits to the right of the binary point, regardless of the memory data type. Floating-point values convert to true
fixed-point values.

<p>
Each fixed-point index is then shifted left by <code>#GL_INDEX_SHIFT</code> bits and added to <code>#GL_INDEX_OFFSET</code>. If <code>#GL_INDEX_SHIFT</code>
is negative, the shift is to the right. In either case, zero bits fill otherwise unspecified bit locations in the result.

<p>
If the GL is in RGBA mode, the resulting index is converted to an RGBA pixel with the help of the <code>#GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_R</code>,
<code>#GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_G</code>, <code>#GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_B</code>, and <code>#GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_A</code> tables. If the GL is in color index mode, and
if <code>#GL_MAP_COLOR</code> is true, the index is replaced with the value that it references in lookup table <code>#GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_I</code>.
Whether the lookup replacement of the index is done or not, the integer part of the index is then ANDed with 2^b-1,
where <code>b</code> is the number of bits in a color index buffer.

<p>
The GL then converts the resulting indices or RGBA colors to fragments by attaching the current raster position z
coordinate and texture coordinates to each pixel, then assigning x and y window coordinates to the nth fragment such that

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>xn = xr + n % width
yn = yr + n / width
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

where (xr,yr) is the current raster position. These pixel fragments are then treated just like the fragments generated
by rasterizing points, lines, or polygons. Texture mapping, fog, and all the fragment operations are applied before the
fragments are written to the frame buffer.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>#GL_STENCIL_INDEX</code></dt>
<dd>
Each pixel is a single value, a stencil index. It is converted to fixed-point format, with an unspecified number of
bits to the right of the binary point, regardless of the memory data type. Floating-point values convert to true
fixed-point values.

<p>
Each fixed-point index is then shifted left by <code>#GL_INDEX_SHIFT</code> bits, and added to <code>#GL_INDEX_OFFSET</code>. If <code>#GL_INDEX_SHIFT</code>
is negative, the shift is to the right. In either case, zero bits fill otherwise unspecified bit locations in the
result. If <code>#GL_MAP_STENCIL</code> is true, the index is replaced with the value that it references in lookup table <code>#GL_PIXEL_MAP_S_TO_S</code>.
Whether the lookup replacement of the index is done or not, the integer part of the index is then ANDed with 2^b-1,
where <code>b</code> is the number of bits in the stencil buffer. The resulting stencil indices are then written to the stencil
buffer such that the nth index is written to location

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>xn = xr + n % width
yn = yr + n / width
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

where (xr,yr) is the current raster position. Only the pixel ownership test, the scissor test, and the stencil writemask
affect these write operations.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>#GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT</code></dt>
<dd>
Each pixel is a single-depth component. Floating-point data is converted directly to an internal floating-point format
with unspecified precision. The resulting floating-point depth value is then multiplied by <code>#GL_DEPTH_SCALE</code> and added
to <code>#GL_DEPTH_BIAS</code>. The result is clamped to the range [0,1].

<p>
The GL then converts the resulting depth components to fragments by attaching the current raster position color or color
index and texture coordinates to each pixel, then assigning x and y window coordinates to the nth fragment such that

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>xn = xr + n % width
yn = yr + n / width
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

where (xr,yr) is the current raster position. These pixel fragments are then treated just like the fragments generated
by rasterizing points, lines, or polygons. Texture mapping, fog, and all the fragment operations are applied before the
fragments are written to the frame buffer.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>#GL_RGBA</code></dt>
<dd>
Each pixel is a four-component group: For <code>#GL_RGBA</code>, the red component is first, followed by green, followed by blue, followed by alpha.
Floating-point values are converted directly to an internal floating-point format with unspecified precision. The resulting
floating-point color values are then multiplied by <code>#GL_c_SCALE</code> and added to <code>#GL_c_BIAS</code>, where c is RED, GREEN, BLUE, and ALPHA
for the respective color components. The results are clamped to the range [0,1].

<p>
If <code>#GL_MAP_COLOR</code> is true, each color component is scaled by the size of lookup table <code>#GL_PIXEL_MAP_c_TO_c</code>, then replaced by
the value that it references in that table. c is R, G, B, or A respectively.

<p>
The GL then converts the resulting RGBA colors to fragments by attaching the current raster position z coordinate and texture
coordinates to each pixel, then assigning x and y window coordinates to the nth fragment such that

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>xn = xr + n % width
yn = yr + n / width
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

where (xr,yr) is the current raster position. These pixel fragments are then treated just like the fragments generated by
rasterizing points, lines, or polygons. Texture mapping, fog, and all the fragment operations are applied before the
fragments are written to the frame buffer.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>#GL_RED</code></dt>
<dd>
Each pixel is a single red component. This component is converted to the internal floating-point format in the same way
the red component of an RGBA pixel is. It is then converted to an RGBA pixel with green and blue set to 0, and alpha
set to 1. After this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read as an RGBA pixel.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>#GL_GREEN</code></dt>
<dd>
Each pixel is a single green component. This component is converted to the internal floating-point format in the same way
the green component of an RGBA pixel is. It is then converted to an RGBA pixel with red and blue set to 0, and alpha
set to 1. After this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read as an RGBA pixel.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>#GL_BLUE</code></dt>
<dd>
Each pixel is a single blue component. This component is converted to the internal floating-point format in the same way
the blue component of an RGBA pixel is. It is then converted to an RGBA pixel with red and green set to 0, and alpha
set to 1. After this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read as an RGBA pixel.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>#GL_ALPHA</code></dt>
<dd>
Each pixel is a single alpha component. This component is converted to the internal floating-point format in the same way
the alpha component of an RGBA pixel is. It is then converted to an RGBA pixel with red, green, and blue set to 0. After
this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read as an RGBA pixel.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>#GL_RGB</code></dt>
<dd>
Each pixel is a three-component group: red first, followed by green, followed by blue. Each component is converted to the
internal floating-point format in the same way the red, green, and blue components of an RGBA pixel are. The color triple
is converted to an RGBA pixel with alpha set to 1. After this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read as an RGBA pixel.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>#GL_LUMINANCE</code></dt>
<dd>
Each pixel is a single luminance component. This component is converted to the internal floating-point format in the same
way the red component of an RGBA pixel is. It is then converted to an RGBA pixel with red, green, and blue set to the converted
luminance value, and alpha set to 1. After this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read as an RGBA pixel.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>#GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA</code></dt>
<dd>
Each pixel is a two-component group: luminance first, followed by alpha. The two components are converted to the internal
floating-point format in the same way the red component of an RGBA pixel is. They are then converted to an RGBA pixel with
red, green, and blue set to the converted luminance value, and alpha set to the converted alpha value. After this conversion,
the pixel is treated as if it had been read as an RGBA pixel.

<p>
The rasterization described so far assumes pixel zoom factors of 1. If <a href="glPixelZoom.html">gl.PixelZoom()</a> is used to change
the x and y pixel zoom factors, pixels are converted to fragments as follows. If (xr,yr) is the current raster position, and
a given pixel is in the nth column and mth row of the pixel rectangle, then fragments are generated for pixels whose centers
are in the rectangle with corners at

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>(xr + zoomx_n, yr + zoomy_m)
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

and

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>(xr + zoomx_(n + 1), yr + zoomy_(m + 1))
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

where <code>zoomx</code> is the value of <code>#GL_ZOOM_X</code> and <code>zoomy</code> is the value of <code>#GL_ZOOM_Y</code>.

<p>
Please note that this command operates directly with memory pointers. There is also a version which works
with tables instead of memory pointers, but this is slower of course. See <a href="glDrawPixels.html">gl.DrawPixels</a> for details.
See <a href="UsingPointers.html">Working with pointers</a> for details on how to use memory pointers with Hollywood.
