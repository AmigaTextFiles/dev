<h2 class="heading">1.1 Introduction</h2>

<p>
GL Galore is a plugin for Hollywood that allows you to access the OpenGL&reg; 1.1 command set directly from
Hollywood. This makes it possible to write scripts that utilize the host system's 3D hardware to
create high-performance, butter-smooth 2D and 3D animation that is calculated completely in hardware
by the GPU of your graphics board. This leads to a huge performance boost over the classic Hollywood
graphics API which is mostly implemented in software. Especially systems with slower CPUs will benefit
greatly from hardware-accelerated drawing offered by OpenGL.

<p>
OpenGL is a portable software interface to graphics hardware. It is available for almost every platform
in a variety of flavours. On AmigaOS and compatibles, OpenGL is available as MiniGL on AmigaOS 4, TinyGL
on MorphOS, StormMesa on AmigaOS 3, and Mesa 3D on AROS. Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux systems are usually
shipped with an OpenGL driver already installed. More information about OpenGL can be obtained from <a href="http://www.opengl.org" target="_new">http://www.opengl.org</a>.
You can find good tutorials about learning OpenGL all over the web.

<p>
There are two ways of using GL Galore: You can either access the OpenGL 1.1 API directly or you can use
Hollywood's hardware brush functions without making any direct calls to the OpenGL API. Whenever GL Galore is
activated, Hollywood hardware brushes are mapped directly to OpenGL textures so they can be drawn and transformed
in an extremely fast way on all supported systems. This is especially useful on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux because
Hollywood doesn't support hardware double buffers and brushes on these platforms by default. With GL Galore,
however, hardware double buffers and brushes can be used on these platforms now too. So GL Galore can also act
as a helper plugin here which adds this functionality to Hollywood without having you write a single line
of OpenGL code to utilize it!

<p>
On top of that, GL Galore offers wrapper functions for most commands of the OpenGL 1.1 API. These commands
are wrapped directly with little to no changes to their original syntax. The only exception concerns OpenGL
commands that expect a pointer: In this case, GL Galore usually offers a variant of the command so that it
works with Hollywood tables. However, the original pointer variant is also available in GL Galore and can
be used for time-critical scripts. Additionally, GL Galore also offers some bridging functions that allow
you to convert Hollywood brushes into OpenGL textures and vice versa.

<p>
GL Galore can also be useful for rapidly prototyping software written in OpenGL. People who used to program
OpenGL using C will greatly appreciate Hollywood's convenient multimedia API which offers functions for almost
all common tasks. For example, by using GL Galore to write OpenGL programs you can avoid all the hassle of
managing a GL window using one of the many different toolkits out there. Also, jobs like image loading, sound
or video playback, font handling and image manipulation become ridiculously easy now thanks to Hollywood's
powerful command set which covers almost 700 functions.

<p>
GL Galore utilizes the new display adapter plugin interface introduced with Hollywood 6.0. Thus, the
plugin will not work with any older versions of Hollywood. It requires at least Hollywood 6.0. Whenever
GL Galore is activated, all graphics output will automatically be routed through OpenGL. To benefit
from hardware acceleration, however, Hollywood scripts have to follow some rules as described in this
manual.

<p>
GL Galore comes with extensive documentation in various formats like PDF, HTML, AmigaGuide, and CHM that
contains a full OpenGL reference and information about special functions in GL Galore. On top of that,
many example scripts are included in the distribution archive to get you started really quickly.

<p>
All of this makes GL Galore the ultimate OpenGL scripting experience combining the best of both
worlds into one powerful plugin: Hollywood's extensive and convenient multimedia function set and OpenGL's
raw graphics power!
