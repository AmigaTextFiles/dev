Please read the history bottom-up. Note that the history might list some
features that were implemented in beta versions and removed later but are
still mentioned here. This history is a log of the programmer so that he
can look up what has been done/tried/modified. Things that were implemented
and removed later are marked with [VOID].

Version 1.1   (19-May-17)

- Change: Updated documentation
- New: Added @2x graphics for high resolutions systems on Windows and Mac OS 
- New: Added 64-bit builds for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS
- New: Added Linux ARM build; note that the Raspberry Pi currently only comes with an experimental
  OpenGL driver which is disabled by default; to enable it, you need to open raspi-config, go
  to "Advanced Options", enable it and reboot
- New: Added the following functions for polling joystick input through GLFW: glfw.JoystickPresent(),
  glfw.GetJoystickButtons(), glfw.GetJoystickAxes(), and glfw.GetJoystickName(); these can be
  useful because there are much more flexible than Hollywood's inbuilt joystick library which is
  very Amiga-centric and was mainly designed for 1980s-style joysticks
- Fix: Cube.hws and MultiDisplays.hws didn't call CheckEvent()
- New: Added support for Hollywood 7's new FULLSCREENSCALE mode
- New: Added help strings for GL Galore's commands; if you have Hollywood 7, you will now get
  function help with Hollywood's IDE for Windows and you can also press F1 to open the GL Galore
  reference; note that you need to copy GLGalore.chm to the "Docs" directory of your Hollywood
  installation directory for this to work
- Fix: glu.Build3DMipmaps(), glu.UnProject(), and gl.GetCurrentContext() were not documented
- New: Added Unicode support if Hollywood 7 is available; you can use the new "VanillaKey" event
  handler to listen to Unicode keys
- Fix [Amiga]: GL Galore no longer crashes when started in full screen mode and the GL context
  couldn't be initialized, e.g. because of missing drivers (reported by Redlion)
- Change [Win32]: Flip() uses a different vertical synchronization mechanism now that prevents
  tearing on some systems
- Fix: Plugin initialization code didn't balance the stack after it was done

Version 1.0   (03-Jun-15)
