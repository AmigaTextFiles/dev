vectorgraphics.hwp
==================

This plugin contains a vector-drawing engine based on cairo. To make Hollywood
use this vector-drawing engine instead of its inbuilt engine, use the following
command before calling any functions of Hollywood's vectorgraphics library:

SetVectorEngine("vectorgraphics")

After this call, all vectorgraphics commands will be redirected to this plugin.

To test this plugin, run the "VectorTest" and "VectorTest2" examples that come
with the Hollywood distribution.
