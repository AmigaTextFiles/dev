@NODE Introduction "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Introduction@{ub}

    MUI Royale is a plugin for Hollywood that allows you to easily create MUI
    GUIs with Hollywood. The GUI layout can be conveniently defined using an XML
    file that is converted into a MUI GUI by MUI Royale on the fly. It just
    doesn't get any easier!

    MUI Royale supports over 40 MUI classes including popular third-party
    classes like TextEditor.mcc and TheBar.mcc. Creating and managing menustrips
    is also fully supported. The highlight of MUI Royale, however, is certainly
    its inbuilt Hollywood MUI class. This class allows dynamic embedding of
    complete Hollywood displays into MUI GUIs which can be used to combine the
    best of Hollywood and MUI into one powerful application.

    MUI Royale comes with extensive documentation in various formats like PDF,
    HTML, AmigaGuide, and CHM that describes MUI programming basics in detail
    and provides a convenient function and class reference. A step-by-step
    tutorial that guides you to your first MUI program is also included. On top
    of that, almost 20 example scripts are included in the distribution archive,
    many of which are direct ports from the MUI 3.8 SDK by Stefan Stuntz, but
    there are also original developments that show how to create video and song
    players using the combined power of Hollywood and MUI.

    All this makes MUI Royale the truly royal MUI experience, carefully crafted
    for you kings and queens of MUI!

@NODE Requirements "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Requirements@{ub}

    - Hollywood 5.2 or better
    - MUI 3.8 or better
    - 68020+ or PowerPC
    - codesets.library for UTF-8 support
    - Toolbar class requires TheBar.mcc 26.11 or better
    - Texteditor class requires TextEditor.mcc 15.47 or better
    - optional: CyberGraphX or Picasso96 for RTG screens
    - optional: guigfx.library and render.library for palette screens

@ENDNODE

@NODE PaletteScreens "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Support for palette screens@{ub}

    Starting with MUI Royale 1.4, the plugin can also be used on palette-based
    screens, i.e. on screens in depths of 8-bit and below. This feature,
    however, requires guigfx.library and render.library to be installed.
    Otherwise, MUI Royale will fail to work on palette-based screens.

    If your application doesn't only use MUI windows, but also needs to open
    normal Hollywood displays in addition to the MUI windows, you also have to
    install the Plananarama plugin which allows Hollywood to run on
    palette-based screens and you need to call \@REQUIRE on Plananarama before
    you call \@REQUIRE on MUI Royale, i.e. your script has to start like this:

        \@REQUIRE "plananarama"
        \@REQUIRE "muiroyale"

    If your script only uses MUI windows, however, you don't need Plananarama.
    guigfx.library and render.library are sufficient then. If you wish to open
    Hollywood displays on palette-based screens as well, though, make sure to
    install Plananarama first.

@NODE History "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}History@{ub}

    Please read the history bottom-up. Note that the history might list some
    features that were implemented in beta versions and removed later but are
    still mentioned here. This history is a log of the programmer so that he
    can look up what has been done/tried/modified. Things that were implemented
    and removed later are marked with [VOID].

    Version 1.7   (01-Oct-17)

    - Change: Updated documentation
    - Fix: Area.ContextMenu didn't work with Group objects (reported by Tony Canazza)
    - Fix: Slider.Stringify didn't work for Numericbutton class (reported by Petteri Valli)
    - New: Added Notify.ExportID [ISG]; this can be used to load and save the states of certain MUI
      gadgets like string, radio, cycle, listview, text, etc. (requested by Artur Ostrowski)
    - New: Added Application.Load() and Application.Save() methods to easily load and save the current
      GUI state configuration (requested by Artur Ostrowski)
    - New: Added mui.FreeImage(); this allows you to free an image in MUI Royale's internal image
      cache; you have to pass the number of the brush you want to free or -1 to free all images;
      note that you must make sure that the image you free is no longer used by any widget or MUI
      Royale might crash; note that normally it isn't necessary to call mui.FreeImage() because all
      images are freed automatically when MUI Royale quits; it's only necessary in case you want
      to reuse the same brush number with a new image or free memory used by an image (requested by
      Lazar Zoltan and Petteri Valli)
    - New: Added mui.HaveObject(); this allows you to check whether the specified MUI object exists
      (requested by Tony Canazza)
      
    Version 1.6   (08-May-17)

    - Change: Updated documentation
    - Fix: Virtual groups didn't work inside scrollgroups (reported by Kai Stegemann)

    Version 1.5   (06-May-17)
    - Change: Updated documentation
    - New: Virtgroup class can now also be used outside of groups managed by Scrollgroup
      class (requested by Tony Canazza)
    - Change: About MUI Royale logo is stored with compression now; saves about 80kb in
      the final executable size
    - New: Added support for Numericbutton MUI class; it uses exactly the same attributes
      as Slider class (requested by Petteri Valli)
    - Fix: Button.HiChar and Text.HiChar were documented and implemented as ISG but their
      real applicability is just I (reported by Petteri Valli)
    - Fix: Application.DoubleStart never triggered (reported by Petteri Valli)
    - New: Added Slider.Pressed [N]; this can be used to listen to mouse clicks on the
      slider knob (requested by Tony Canazza)
    - New: Added Area.ShowSelState; this is only interesting for people wishing to do
      advanced stuff with MUI Royale
    - Change: Moved Button.Pressed and Button.Selected attributes to Area class; this
      is necessary for you to make full use of the new Area.InputMode attribute
    - New: Added Area.InputMode [I]; use this with care as typically this is set by the
      individual MUI gadgets themselves so setting an alternate input mode is potentially
      dangerous (requested by Tony Canazza)
    - New: Added Area.BackgroundBrush [IS] (requested by Tony Canazza)
    - New: Hollywood class supports the "VanillaKey" event handler now if Hollywood 7 is
      available; this event handler allows you to listen to Unicode keys
    - New: Added Unicode support if Hollywood 7 is available; of course, AmigaOS doesn't
      support Unicode itself so you'll always be limited to the system charset but at
      least MUI Royale always uses UTF-8 internally now so as soon as AmigaOS or MUI gets
      full Unicode support MUI Royale can support it too
      
    Version 1.4   (25-Sep-16)
    - Change: Updated documentation
    - Fix: Escape sequences are now filtered from the string gadget created by Poplist class
      (reported by Richard Lake)
    - New: Added Listview.AutoLineHeight [I] and Listtree.AutoLineHeight [I]; these are more
      convenient than xxx.MinLineHeight but they require at least MUI 4.0
    - New: Added support for TextEditor.ImportHook and TextEditor.ExportHook (requested by
      Jean-Noel Roueste)
    - New: Added support for MUI's Busy class; this is useful for indicating progress when
      the total processing time is unknown
    - Fix: Memory access fault in mui.Set() under special, rare circumstances
    - New: Added support for MUI's Scrollbar.mui class; this is a subclass of Prop.mui
    - New: mui.Request() supports an additional argument now which allows you to specify an
      icon to be shown in the requester; this is currently only supported with the MUI4
      maintained by Thore Böckelmann (requested by Jean-Noel Roueste)
    - Fix: Wrong virtgroup layout e.g. in Virtual.hws
    - Fix: Crash in Register.AddPage() in case an error occurred
    - Fix: Crash in mui.CreateObject() in case an error occurred while creating the object
    - Fix: Notify on String.Contents didn't work
    - Change: Removed TextEditor.FlushColors() and TextEditor.Pen; these are superfluous now
      because colored text is no longer pen-based
    - Change: TextEditor.SetColor() and TextEditor.Color use TextEditor.mcc's inbuilt RGB text
      mode now which is a much better solution than the previous pen-based approach; as a result,
      TextEditor.mcc 15.47 is now required by MUI Royale!
    - New: Added Listtree.Quiet [S] which can be used to turn off refresh when adding lots of
      items (requested by Richard Lake)
    - New: Register.InsertPage() allows you to insert tabs into arbitrary position (requested by
      Richard Lake)
    - Fix: Listtree.Insert() and Listtree.Rename() didn't support images using the \\33A sequence
      (reported by Richard Lake)
    - New: Listtree.MinLineHeight allows you to set a minimum line height for the Listtree object
    - Fix: In some rare cases mui.Set() didn't report a correct error message
    - Fix: Menuitem.Selected, Poppen.RGB, String/Popfile/Popdrawer/Popfont.Contents, String/
      Popfile/Popdrawer/Popfont.Acknowledge notifications didn't set TriggerValue correctly
    - New: Listview.Jump() can handle the special values "Active", "Top", "Bottom", "Up", and
      "Down" now
    - Fix [AROS]: Hollywood class didn't handle satellite bitmap pixel formats correctly; this
      didn't have any practical consequences for Hollywood versions <= 6.0 because of a bug in
      these Hollywood versions; this bug was fixed in Hollywood 6.1, though, and then prevented
      embedded Hollywood displays from working correctly
    - New: Added support for palette-based screens; when calling \@REQUIRE and the front-most screen
      is palette-based, MUI Royale will automatically install a display adapter which supports
      palette-based screens; if you want to open Hollywood displays you also need the Plananarama
      plugin and you need to \@REQUIRE the Plananarama plugin *before* MUI Royale!

    Version 1.3   (27-Jun-15)
    - Change: Updated documentation
    - Change: Installer automatically integrates the MUI Royale examples into Hollywood 6.0's example
      tree now so that you can conveniently launch them from the Hollywood GUI
    - Fix: Listtree.Remove() didn't remove the nodes and items from MUI Royale's internal object
      collection which meant that you could still access them through mui.Set() and mui.Get()
    - Fix: Listtree.Insert() returns an error now if the id is already used by another object
    - Fix: Listtree.Insert() didn't make new nodes and items available to MUI Royale's internal
      object collection which meant that you couldn't access newly inserted nodes and items using
      mui.Set() and mui.Get() for example to associate user data with them (reported by Richard Lake)
    - Fix: Getting Listviewcolumn.Hidden didn't work correctly when the user manually hid a column
      using the context menu in the listview's title bar (reported by Rüdiger Solbach)
    - Fix: Getting Group.ActivePage no longer returns "First" for the very first page but numeric
      indices for all pages (reported by Lazar Zoltan)
    - Fix: Qualifiers like shift, alt, command... didn't work with Hollywood 6.0 (reported by
      Jörg Renkert)
    - Fix: Memory access fault when calling mui.Request() before mui.CreateGUI() (reported by
      Simone Monsignori)
    - Fix: Listview.GetEntry() didn't make sure that there is enough stack space for storing the
      return values (reported by Lazar Zoltan)
    - Fix: Read from recently freed memory in mui.FreeObject() and when shutting down the application
      (reported by Thore Böckelmann)
    - New: Menuitem.Title supports text formatting codes now if MUI 4.0 is available; please note
      that text formatting codes only work for context menus, not for screen bar menus (requested
      by Richard Lake)
    - New: Added several new functions to deal with string objects: String.Copy(), String.Cut(),
      String.Paste(), String.Insert(), String.Undo(), String.Redo() as well as the attributes
      String.MarkStart [ISG], String.MarkEnd [ISG] and String.CursorPos [SG]; all of these methods
      and attributes require at least MUI 4.0 (suggested by bitRocky)
    - Fix: Area.Hide didn't work correctly with text editor objects that have a slider attached
      (reported by Lazar Zoltan)
    - Fix [Doc]: PopFile.Pattern was wrongly documented as PopFile.InitialPattern (reported by
      Jörg Renkert)

      were handled (reported by Damaso Dominguez)
    - Change: Merged code of muiroyale.hwc into the main plugin; muiroyale.hwc is no longer
      necessary now
    - Fix: Setting Group.Title on a group object that hadn't been attached to a register group
      yet caused a crash
    - Fix: Register.AddPage() ran the text formatter again for the register title which led to

    Version 1.2   (02-Jul-14)
    - Change: Updated documentation
    - New: Added 4 examples that show how to use the new functions mui.CreateObject() and
      mui.FreeObject() to dynamically create MUI objects at runtime (Dynamic1.hws, Dynamic2.hws,
      Dynamic3.hws, Dynamic4.hws)
    - Change: TextEditor.hws example script now uses TextEditor.Color instead of TextEditor.Pen to
      guarantee a consistent visual experience on all systems
    - Change [OS3]: Now that MUI 3.9 is also available for OS3, MUI Royale will check on startup
      whether 3.9 is installed and will enable all 3.9 features if it is
    - New: Added TextEditor.ColorMap [G] attribute to retrieve the current color map; you need this to
      parse the text returned by TextEditor.Contents
    - New: Added TextEditor.SetColor() method which allows you to change the color of a text block
    - New: TextEditor.SetBold(), TextEditor.SetItalic(), TextEditor.SetUnderline() and TextEditor.SetAlign()
      support the special values "Min" and "Max" now to conveniently specify the minimum and maximum
      positions available
    - New: Added TextEditor.FlushColors() method which can be used to flush the internal pen mapping
      of a text editor object (in case you're running out of pens)
    - New: Added TextEditor.Color which has an applicability of SGN (requested by Marko)
    - New: Added Area.BackgroundRGB and Area.BackgroundImage (requested by Marko)
    - New: Application.ConfigChange allows you to get notified whenever the user changes the MUI
      settings for your application, e.g. moves it to another screen; this is only supported on
      MUI 4 (requested by Jörg Renkert)
    - Change: Window.PubScreen now always returns the name of the screen the window is currently on
      even if it has been set by the user using the MUI preferences (requested by Jörg Renkert)
    - New: Group.Title now has an applicability of ISG and it can also handle text formatting tags
      now, e.g. it is possible to include images in the tab titles now; both features require MUI 4;
      if MUI 4 is unavailable, Group.Title will have the old applicability of just I
    - New: Group.ChildList attribute can be used to get a list of children that are members of
      the group; Group.ChildList returns a table containing as many elements as the group has
      children; each element contains the fields "ID", "Class", and "MUIClass"
    - New: Added Application.WindowList attribute [G]; this will return a table containing a list
      of all windows currently attached to the application object
    - New: mui.IsVersion4() allows you to check whether the user is running MUI 4
    - New: Added Register.Position [I] and Register.Pages [G] attributes; these require MUI 4.0
    - New: Added Register.Closable [I] and Register.CloseRequest [N] attributes; by using these attributes
      you can add a close gadget to the tabs of your Register object and react to the user pressing
      these gadgets; these attributes require MUI 4.0
    - New: Added Register.GetPageID() method which returns the ID of the group object at the specified
      tab index; this method requires MUI 4.0
    - New: Added Register.AddPage() and Register.ClosePage() which allow you to dynamically add and
      remove tabs from a Register object; these two methods require at least MUI 4.0 (requested by
      Richard Lake)
    - New: All Menustrip methods are also available to Menu class now
    - New: Added Menustrip.AddHead() and Menustrip.AddTail() methods to add menu objects to the head
      or tail of a menu
    - New: Added Application.AddWindow() and Application.RemoveWindow() to dynamically add/remove
      windows to/from the Application object
    - New: Added Group.InitChange(), Group.ExitChange(), Group.AddHead(), Group.AddTail(),
      Group.Insert(), and Group.Remove() methods which can be used to insert dynamically created MUI
      objects into an existing group or remove MUI objects from a group and add them to the loose object
      stock; note that you must not call mui.FreeObject() on objects that have been added to a group
      because they will be freed with the group then; mui.FreeObject() must only be called with loose
      objects which have either been created by mui.CreateObject() or removed from an existing object tree;
      note that Group.ExitChange() accepts an additional argument which can be used to specify whether
      or not MUI should force a refresh
    - New: Added support for dynamic creation of MUI objects: you can create MUI objects at runtime
      now using the new mui.CreateObject() and mui.FreeObject() functions; MUI objects created at
      runtime can then be added to existing objects using new methods (see above)
    - New: Added Listview.SortFunc attribute; this allows you to specify a custom callback function
      that will be called whenever your listview requires sorting; this allows you to customize
      listview sorting, e.g. implement reverse alphabetical sorting or other customized criteria;
      your callback needs to return "-1" if entry 1 should be placed before entry 2 or "1" if it
      is to be placed after entry 2; if the two entries are the same, return "0" (requested by
      Richard Lake)
    - Fix [Doc]: ISGN applicability of Slider.Stringify() wasn't documented
    - Fix: Slider.Stringify didn't work with mui.Get()
    - New: Added Listview.Quiet attribute which allows you to temporarily disable listview refresh
      to quickly add/remove multiple items (requested by Richard Lake)

    Version 1.1   (07-May-14)
    - Change: Updated documentation
    - New: VideoPlayer example allows you to switch between antialias interpolation and simple
      scaling
    - Fix: Fixed a bug in the Slider.Stringify; it didn't block Hollywood's refresh server which
      could lead to a deadlock, for example in the VideoPlayer.hws example; this fix requires a
      Hollywood version newer than 5.3
    - New: Added Texteditor.GetText method; this allows you to get the partial contents from
      a text editor gadget (requested by Richard Lake)
    - New: Window.PubScreen allows you to open windows on all public screens; use this only if
      you have good reasons because normally this is something that the user should decide
      (requested by Richard Lake)
    - Fix: Window.Borderless didn't work because MUI Royale enforced a window title (reported by
      Jörg Renkert)
    - New: Popfile, Popdrawer, Popfont, and Poplist classes support the AdvanceOnCR attribute now
      for their string gadgets (requested by Richard Lake)
    - New: Window.ActiveObject can also be used as a notification attribute now (requested by
      Richard Lake)
    - Fix: Application.AboutMUIRoyale() didn't work when MUIRoyale.hwp was in a folder that contained
      spaces (reported by Achim Kern)
    - New: All of the Column class attributes have an applicability of ISG now which means that
      you can also change them during runtime
    - New: Added Listviewcolumn.Hidden attribute which can be used to show/hide single columns;
      this requires at least MUI 3.9 (requested by Richard Lake)
    - New: Added Listview.Rename() method that allows you to rename entries in a listview row
      (requested by Richard Lake)
    - Fix: Listview.Sort() didn't work correctly; it now accepts an additional argument which
      tells according to which column the list view should be sorted (reported by Richard Lake)
    - New: Area.ContextMenu can be used with mui.Set() now to change the context menu of a MUI
      object; to remove the context menu from an object completely, pass the special constant
      "(none)" in mui.Set() (requested by Richard Lake)
    - New [OS4/MorphOS]: Listview.TitleClick allows you to get notified about clicks on the title
      bars of a listview (requested by Richard Lake)
    - Fix [AROS]: MUI Royale uses relative search paths now when looking for TextEditor.mcc and
      TheBar.mcc custom classes (reported by Nigel Tromans)
    - Fix: Area.ContextMenuTrigger didn't set the TriggerValue correctly (reported by Richard Lake)
    - Fix: When using Listview.GetEntry together with "Active" on a Dirlist object in which no entry
      was active, MUI Royale crashed (reported by Richard Lake)
    - New [OS4]: Pixel-exact virtgroup resizing now possible because it is now supported by OS4's
      MUI now, too
    - Fix: "Selected" attribute in class <button> did not work when used with "True" or "False"
      (reported by Matthias Rustler)
    - Fix: Installer didn't work with paths that had spaces in them (reported by Richard Lake)

@NODE FAQ "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Frequently asked questions@{ub}

    This section covers some frequently asked questions. Please read them first
    before asking on the mailing list or forum because your problem might have
    been covered here.

    @{b}Q: @{ub}@{b}My @{ub}@{b}GUI @{ub}@{b}is @{ub}@{b}not @{ub}@{b}resizable. @{ub}@{b}Isn't @{ub}@{b}one @{ub}@{b}of @{ub}@{b}the @{ub}@{b}big @{ub}@{b}advantages @{ub}@{b}of @{ub}@{b}MUI @{ub}@{b}that @{ub}@{b}its@{ub}

    A: Yes, but there are some things that you need to keep in mind for the
    resize feature to work correctly. If there is a gadget in your GUI that has
    a fixed size, you need to pad it using resizable <rectangle> objects on its
    sides. Then your GUI will be resizable again. For example, imagine you have
    a 64x64 <image> object in a horizontal group in your window. MUI won't be
    able to resize this window unless you add rectangle objects to the sides of
    your image object because MUI needs to find an object that can be resized so
    you need to take care that non-resizable objects in your GUI are always
    padded with resizable ones. By the way, be careful with the <label> tag:
    Objects of label class are actually not resizable! If you want resizable
    labels, just use <text> instead.


    @{b}Q: @{ub}@{b}Why @{ub}@{b}are @{ub}@{b}labels @{ub}@{b}not @{ub}@{b}resizable @{ub}@{b}then?@{ub}

    A: Honestly, I don't know. There is a @{"Label.FreeVert" LINK LabelFreeVert} attribute but the
    corresponding Label.FreeHoriz is missing. I do not really know why Stefan
    Stuntz did it this way but I am sure there is some rationale behind it.


    @{b}Q: @{ub}@{b}Why @{ub}@{b}are @{ub}@{b}there @{ub}@{b}no @{ub}@{b}Application.Author, @{ub}@{b}Application.Copyright,@{ub}
    @{b}Application.Description, @{ub}@{b}Application.Title, @{ub}@{b}and @{ub}@{b}Application.Version@{ub}
    @{b}attributes?@{ub}

    A: These attributes have been deliberately left out to avoid redundancies
    with Hollywood. Hollywood already offers the \@APPAUTHOR, \@APPCOPYRIGHT,
    \@APPDESCRIPTION, \@APPTITLE, and \@APPVERSION preprocessor commands. The
    contents of these preprocessor commands will be automatically passed to the
    MUI application object when it is created.

@NODE ApplicationTree "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Application tree@{ub}

    A MUI application consists of a (sometimes very) big object tree. The root
    of this tree is always an instance of application class, called application
    object. This application object handles the various communication channels
    such as user input through windows, ARexx commands or commodities messages.

    An application object itself would be enough to create non-GUI programs with
    just ARexx and commodities capabilities. If you want to have windows with
    lots of nice gadgets and other user interface stuff, you will have to add
    window objects to your application. Since the application object is able to
    to handle any number of children, the number of windows is not limited.

    Window objects are instances of window class and handle all the actions
    related with opening, closing, moving, resizing and refreshing of intuition
    windows. However, a window for itself is not of much use without having any
    contents to display. That's why window objects always need a so called root
    object.

    With this root object, we finally reach the gadget related classes of the
    MUI system. These gadget related classes are all subclasses of @{"Area class" LINK Area},
    they describe a rectangle region with some class dependent contents. Many
    different classes such as strings, buttons, checkmarks or listviews are
    available, but the most important subclass of area class is probably the
    @{"Group class" LINK Group}. Instances of this class are able to handle any number of child
    objects and control the size and position of these children with various
    attributes. Of course these children can again be group objects with other
    sets of children. Since you usually want your window to contain more than
    just one object, the root object of a window must always be a group class
    object.

    In MUI Royale GUIs are defined entirely using the XML markup language. Here
    is an example what an application tree could look like in an XML
    declaration:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
        <application base="HELLOWORLD">
           <window title="Example GUI" muiid="MAIN">
              <vgroup>
                 <listview>
                    <column/>
                 </listview>
                 <string/>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button>Add</button>
                    <button>Remove</button>
                 </hgroup>
              </vgroup>
           </window>
        </application>

    Because these first paragraphs are very important for understanding how MUI
    works, here's a brief summary:

    An application consists of exactly one application object. This application
    object may have any number of children, each of them being a window object.
    Every window object contains a root object that must be of type group class.
    This group object again handles any number of child objects, either other
    group objects or some user interface elements such as strings, sliders or
    buttons.

@ENDNODE

@NODE ClassHierarchy "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Class hierarchy@{ub}

    There are two important super classes that you have to know because almost
    all other MUI classes are children of these two super classes: The first one
    is @{"Notify class" LINK Notify} which handles MUI's event notification system. Notify class
    allows your MUI objects to listen to certain events and trigger
    notifications whenever these events occur. See @{"Notify class" LINK Notify} for details.

    The second important super class is @{"Area class" LINK Area}. Area class is the the super
    class for all MUI objects that have a visual representation in form of a
    gadget in a MUI window. Thus, you can use all of Area class' attributes on
    all of your MUI gadgets. For example, you can use the @{"Area.Width" LINK AreaWidth} and
    @{"Area.Height" LINK AreaHeight} attributes to find out the dimensions of a listview, texteditor,
    or string gadget because these are all subclasses of Area class. See @{"Area" LINK Area}
    @{"class" LINK Area} for details.

@ENDNODE

@NODE LayoutEngine "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Automatic layout engine@{ub}

    One of the most important and powerful features of MUI is its dynamic layout
    engine. As opposed to other available user interface tools, the programmer
    of a MUI application doesn't have to care about gadget sizes and positions.
    MUI handles all necessary calculations automatically, making every program
    completely screen, window size and font sensitive without the need for the
    slightest programmer interaction.

    From a programmer's point of view, all you have to do is to define some
    rectangle areas that shall contain the objects you want to see in your
    window. Objects of group class are used for this purpose. These objects are
    not visible themselves, but instead tell their children whether they should
    appear horizontally or vertically.

    For automatic and dynamic layout, it's important that every single object
    knows about its minimum and maximum dimensions. Before opening a window, MUI
    asks all its gadgets about these values and uses them to calculate the
    window's extreme sizes.

    Once the window is opened, layout takes place. Starting with the current
    window size, the root object and all its children are placed depending on
    the type of their father's group and on some additional attributes. The
    algorithm ensures that objects will never become smaller as their minimum or
    larger as their maximum size.

    The important thing with this mechanism is that object placement depends on
    window size. This allows very easy implementation of a sizing gadget:
    whenever the user resizes a window, MUI simply starts a new layout process
    and recalculates object positions and sizes automatically. No programmer
    interaction is needed.

    As a consequence, you should never explicitly define fixed sizes for your
    windows and your windows' gadgets. Instead, MUI calculates these
    automatically depending on the current user preferences. Although it is
    possible to use fixed sizes for your window using @{"Window.Width" LINK WindowWidth} and
    @{"Window.Height" LINK WindowHeight} it is against MUI's philosophy to actually use these. Also,
    the gadget counterparts @{"Area.FixWidth" LINK AreaFixWidth} and @{"Area.FixHeight" LINK AreaFixHeight} should only be used
    if you have a very good reason for doing so. Normally, you should leave all
    layout calculation as well as gadget and window size determination to MUI's
    automatic layout engine which will make sure to give the user the ideal
    visual representation of your GUI layout.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Groups "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Group objects@{ub}

    As mentioned above, a programmer specifies a window's design by grouping
    objects either horizontally or vertically. As a little example, let's have a
    look at a simple file requester window:

    See image: @{"filereq.png" LINK "Guide/filereq.png/MAIN"}

    This window consists of two listview objects, two string gadgets and two
    buttons. To tell MUI how these objects shall be placed, you need to define
    groups around them. Here, the window consists of a vertical group that
    contains a horizontal group with both lists as first child, the path gadget
    as second child, the file gadget as third child and again a horizontal group
    with both buttons as fourth child.

    In an XML file, the GUI definition of this window could then look like this:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
        <application base="FILEREQ">
           <window title="File requester">
              <vgroup>
                 <hgroup>
                    <listview><column/></listview>
                    <listview><column/></listview>
                 </hgroup>
                 <string/>
                 <string/>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button>OK</button>
                    <button>Cancel</button>
                 </hgroup>
              </vgroup>
           </window>
        </application>

    This XML definition is completely enough to define the contents of our
    window, all necessary sizes and positions are automatically calculated by
    the MUI system.

    To understand how these calculations work, it's important to know that all
    basic objects (e.g. strings, buttons, lists) have a fixed minimum and a
    maximum size. Group objects calculate their minimum and maximum sizes from
    their children, depending whether they are horizontal or vertical:

    Horizontal groups:

    - The minimum width of a horizontal group is the sum of all minimum widths
      of its children.

    - The maximum width of a horizontal group is the sum of all maximum widths
      of its children.

    - The minimum height of a horizontal group is the biggest minimum height of
      its children.

    - The maximum height of a horizontal group is the smallest maximum height of
      its children.

    Vertical groups:

    - The minimum height of a vertical group is the sum of all minimum heights
      of its children.

    - The maximum height of a vertical group is the sum of all maximum heights
      of its children.

    - The minimum width of a vertical group is the biggest minimum width of its
      children.

    - The maximum width of a vertical group is the smallest maximum width of its
      children.

    Maybe this algorithm sounds a little complicated, but in fact it is really
    straight forward and ensures that objects will neither get smaller as their
    minimum nor bigger as their maximum size.

    Before a window is opened, it asks its root object (usually a group object)
    to calculate minimum and maximum sizes. These sizes are used as the window's
    bounding dimensions, the smallest possible window size will result in all
    objects being display in their minimum size.

    Once minimum and maximum sizes are calculated, layout process starts. The
    root object is told to place itself in the rectangle defined by the current
    window size. This window size is either specified by the programmer or
    results from a window resize operation by the user. When an object is told
    to layout itself, it simply sets its position and dimensions to the given
    rectangle. In case of a group object, a more or less complicated algorithm
    distributes all available space between its children and tells them to
    layout too.

    This "more or less complicated algorithm" is responsible for the object
    arrangement. Depending on some attributes of the group object (horizontal or
    vertical,...) and on some attributes of the children (minimum and maximum
    dimensions,...), space is distributed and children are placed.

    A little example makes things more clear. Let's see what happens in a window
    that contains nothing but three horizontally grouped colorfield objects:

    See image: @{"colorfields.png" LINK "Guide/colorfields.png/MAIN"}

    Colorfield objects have a minimum width and height of one pixel and no
    maximum width and height. Since we have a horizontal group, the minmax
    calculation explained above yields to a minimum width of three pixels and a
    minimum height of one pixel for the window's root object (the horizontal
    group containing the colorfields). Maximum dimensions of the group are
    unlimited. Using these results, MUI is able to calculate the windows
    bounding dimensions by adding some spacing values and window border
    thicknesses.

    Once min and max dimensions are calculated, the window can be opened with a
    programmer or user specified size. This size is the starting point for the
    following layout calculations. For our little example, let's imagine that
    the current window size is 100 pixels wide and 50 pixels high.

    MUI subtracts the window borders and some window inner spacing and tells the
    root object to layout itself into the rectangle left=5, top=20, width=90,
    height=74. Since our root object is a horizontal group in this case, it
    knows that each colorfield can get the full height of 74 pixels and that the
    available width of 90 pixels needs to be shared by all three fields. Thus,
    the resulting fields will all get a width of 90/3=30 pixels.

    That's the basic way MUI's layout system works. There are a lot more
    possibilities to influence layout, you can e.g. assign different weights to
    objects, define some inter object spacing or even make two-dimensional
    groups. These sophisticated layout issues are discussed in the documentation
    of group class.

@NODE ObjectHandling "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Object handling@{ub}

    MUI Royale uses XML files to create MUI objects. When creating objects you
    can use all attributes marked with the letter "I" in the applicability
    section of the accompanying attribute documentation. For example, to create
    a string object with a string-kind frame, a maximum length of 80 and the
    initial contents "foobar", you would have to use the following XML code:

        <string id="mystring" frame="string" contents="foobar" maxlen="80"/>

    Once your object is ready, you can start talking to it by setting or getting
    one of its attributes or by sending it methods. For that purpose it is
    important that you give your object an identifier using the "id" tag so that
    the functions @{"mui.Set()" LINK muiSet}, @{"mui.Get()" LINK muiGet} and @{"mui.DoMethod()" LINK muiDoMethod} can find your object.
    Here's an example of talking to your string gadget:

        mui.Set("mystring", "contents", "look")
        s$ = mui.Get("mystring", "contents")
        DebugPrint("Always " .. s$ .. " on the bright side of life.")

    As already mentioned above, all attributes and methods are completely
    documented in the documentation coming with this distribution.

@NODE Notifications "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Notifications@{ub}

    The central element for controlling a MUI application is the notification
    mechanism. To understand how it works, it's important to know that most
    objects feature lots of attributes that define their current state.
    Notification makes it possible to react on changes of these attributes.

    Attributes are changed either directly by the programmer (with a call to
    @{"mui.Set()" LINK muiSet}) or by the user manipulation of some gadgets. If he e.g. changes
    the active entry of a cycle gadget, the @{"Cycle.Active" LINK CycleActive} attribute will
    continously be updated and reflect the currently active entry.

    If you want to be informed whenever the value of a certain object attribute
    changes, you first have to setup a notification for this attribute in your
    object declaration. This is done directly in the XML file by using the
    "Notify" tag:

        <cycle id="mycycle" notify="active">
           <item>One</item>
           <item>Two</item>
           <item>Three</item>
        </cycle>

    If you want to listen to multiple notifications on the same MUI object, you
    have to separate them using semicolons, e.g.:

        <cycle id="mycycle" notify="active; appmessage">
        ...
        </cycle>

    Note that you can also setup or remove notifications at run-time using the
    @{"mui.Notify()" LINK muiNotify} function from your code.

    The next thing you have to do is setup an event handler for events from MUI
    Royale using the InstallEventHandler() Hollywood function. You have to pass
    a Hollywood function that shall act as an event handler to the
    InstallEventHandler() function. Here is an example:

        InstallEventHandler({MUIRoyale = p_MUIHandler})

    Whenever a MUI event occurs, MUI Royale will then call the event handler
    callback function that you passed to InstallEventHandler(). The function
    will receive a table as its parameter with the following fields initialized:

    Action:   Initialized to "MUIRoyale".

    Class:    Contains the name of the MUI class this event comes from, e.g.
              "Cycle".

    Attribute:
              Contains the name of the class attribute that has triggered the
              event, e.g. "Active".

    ID:       Contains the ID of the MUI object that triggered this event, e.g.
              "mycycle".

    TriggerValue:
              Contains the current value of the attribute that triggered this
              event. You could also find this out by doing a @{"mui.Get()" LINK muiGet} on the
              object but it is more convenient to get the current value directly
              to your event callback.

    MUIUserData:
              If the object was assigned certain userdata, it will be passed to
              the event handler callback in this tag. See @{"Notify.UserData" LINK NotifyUserData} for
              details.

    NotifyData:
              If the object was assigned certain notify data, it will be passed
              to the event handler callback in this tag. See @{"Notify.NotifyData" LINK NotifyNotifyData}
              for details.

@NODE Applicability "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Applicability@{ub}

    In the documentation of every object attribute you will find information
    about the applicability of this attribute. Attribute applicability is
    described in the form of a combination of the four letters I, S, G, and N.
    This tells you the various contexts that the attribute can be used in.

    Here is an explanation of the different applicability contexts:

    I         Attribute can be used when creating the object in the XML file.
              (initialization time)

    S         Attribute can be used with @{"mui.Set()" LINK muiSet} at runtime.

    G         Attribute can be used with @{"mui.Get()" LINK muiGet} at runtime.

    N         Notifications on this attribute are possible either by using the
              "Notify" tag in the XML declaration or by calling the @{"mui.Notify()" LINK muiNotify}
              function at runtime.

    For example, if an attribute has an applicability of just "I", then this
    attribute can only be used during object initialization time. It cannot be
    changed later using @{"mui.Set()" LINK muiSet}. If an attribute has an applicability of just
    "S" on the other hand, it is not possible to specify the attribute already
    at initialization time in the XML file. Attributes that have an
    applicability of "ISGN" can be used in all contexts.

@NODE CycleChain "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Cycle chain@{ub}

    One of the big advantages of MUI is that it also offers powerful features to
    control your GUI via keyboard. For this purpose you should setup a keyboard
    cycle chain for all your windows. Whenever the user presses the TAB key
    then, the next MUI object in the keyboard cycle chain gets activated.

    All you have to do to add a MUI object to the keyboard cycle chain is
    setting its @{"Area.CycleChain" LINK AreaCycleChain} attribute to True. For example, to add a
    listview to the keyboard cycle chain, just do the following in your XML
    declaration:

        <listview cyclechain="true">
           <column/>
        </listview>

    Objects of type @{"Button class" LINK Button} do not need to be added to the keyboard cycle
    chain explicitly. As a convenience feature, MUI Royale will add all buttons
    to the keyboard cycle chain automatically. If you do not want this, you have
    to set @{"Area.CycleChain" LINK AreaCycleChain} to False for all your buttons, although there is
    really no sound reason for doing that.

    Please make sure that you always add all your MUI objects to the keyboard
    cycle chain because this makes your GUI much more attractive for
    keyboard-only users.

@ENDNODE

@NODE TextFormat "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Text formatting codes@{ub}

    MUI's text engine is very powerful and allows you to include special
    character codes for on-the-fly text formatting. For example, it is possible
    to specify text alignment and font style (bold, italics, etc.) using
    formatting codes. With MUI 3.9 or better it is even possible to embed images
    (from a Hollywood brush source) in your text objects.

    Formatting codes always start with an escape character followed by a
    sequence of characters that describe the formatting code. In decimal
    notation the escape character equals ASCII code 27, which is 33 in octal and
    $1B in hexadecimal notation. Care has to be taken when using formatting
    codes because usage is different between XML files and Hollywood source
    files. In XML files the octal notation is used, i.e. you start an escape
    sequence using a backslash and the octal number 33 ('\\33'). In Hollywood
    source codes, however, octal numbers are not supported after a backslash.
    Hollywood always expects the ASCII code in decimal notation after a
    backslash. That is why you have to use '\\27' to initiate an escape sequence
    from Hollywood code.

    To illustrate this difference a little bit better, let us have a look at two
    examples. Here is an example for creating a bold text object in an XML file.
    Bold text is enabled by using the character 'b' after the escape character:

        <text id="mytext">\\33bBold text</text>

    You can see that the octal notation is used here because XML files expect an
    octal number after a backslash. In Hollywood, however, it is different
    because Hollywood expects a decimal character after a backslash. So here is
    how you have to specify escape codes when using them from a Hollywood source
    file:

        mui.Set("mytext", "contents", "\\27bBold text")

    You can see that the code is the same except that we use \\27b instead of
    \\33b because Hollywood always uses decimal instead of octal numbers after a
    backslash.

    The following formatting codes are currently supported:

    \\33u      Set the soft style to underline.

    \\33b      Set the soft style to bold.

    \\33i      Set the soft style to italic.

    \\33n      Set the soft style back to normal.

    \\33<n>    Use pen number n (2..9) as front pen. n must be a valid DrawInfo
              pen as specified in intuition/screens.h.

    \\33P[RRGGBB]
              Change front color to the specified RGB color. The RGB color has
              to be specified in the form of six hexadecimal digits RRGGBB. This
              is only possible on true colour screens. It also requires at least
              MUI 3.9.

    \\33P[AARRGGBB]
              Change front color to the specified RGB color and apply alpha
              blending at the specified intensity. The RGB color has to be
              specified in the form of six hexadecimal digits RRGGBB which have
              to be prefaced with two alpha channel digits AA specifying the
              blending intensity. This is only possible on true colour screens.
              It also requires at least MUI 3.9. Due to limitations in Picasso96
              this does not work with AmigaOS 4 yet (as of AmigaOS 4.1 Update
              6).

    \\33c      Center current (and following) line(s). This sequence is only
              valid at the beginning of a string or after a newline character.

    \\33r      Right justify current (and following) line(s). This sequence is
              only valid at the beginning of a string or after a newline
              character.

    \\33l      Left justify current (and following) line(s). This sequence is
              only valid at the beginning of a string or after a newline
              character.

    \\33A[s]   Include the Hollywood brush that uses the identifier <s> in the
              text object. This feature requires at least MUI 3.9.

    \\33-      Disable text engine, following chars will be printed without
              further parsing.

    \\n        Start a new line. With this character you can e.g. create multi
              line buttons.

    Please note: These formatting codes can be used in all MUI strings, not only
    in text objects. You can e.g. format the columns of a listview or include
    images in a cycle gadget's entries.

@NODE OnlineHelp "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Implementing online help@{ub}

    MUI provides several ways of implementing direct and immediate online help
    functionality in your applications. First of all, every MUI gadget can have
    a bubble help functionality that pops up after the mouse has hovered over a
    gadget for a user-specified interval. This is done via the @{"Area.ShortHelp" LINK AreaShortHelp}
    attribute. As @{"Area class" LINK Area} is the super class for all MUI gadgets, you can use
    this attribute to add a help text to all your gadgets. Here is an example:

        <vgroup>
           <listview shorthelp="List of loaded video files">
              <column/>
           </listview>
           <button shorthelp="Plays a video stream">Play</button>
           <button shorthelp="Stops a video stream">Stop</button>
           <button shorthelp="Exits the program.">Quit</button>
        </vgroup>

    Furthermore, you can specify an external AmigaGuide file for your
    application that is opened whenever the user presses the HELP key. This is
    done by setting the @{"Application.HelpFile" LINK ApplicationHelpFile} attribute. Here is an example:

        <application helpfile="PROGDIR:MyProgram.guide">
        ...
        </application>

    To make your online help functionality even more convenient for the user,
    you can fine-tune the access to the external AmigaGuide file by specifying
    which node or line of the AmigaGuide file should be displayed when the mouse
    is over a specific object. This is done by using the @{"Notify.HelpNode" LINK NotifyHelpNode} or the
    @{"Notify.HelpLine" LINK NotifyHelpLine} attributes. For example, let's assume that the node
    "VideoPlayback" should be displayed when the mouse is over the "Play" button
    and the user presses the HELP key. You can write this as the following XML
    code:

        <button helpnode="VideoPlayback">Play</button>

    Of course, your application has to define @{"Application.HelpFile" LINK ApplicationHelpFile} first if you
    want to use @{"Notify.HelpNode" LINK NotifyHelpNode}.

    If your help system is not that detailed that you have an own node for every
    gadget and you just have an own node for every window, then you can also use
    @{"Notify.HelpNode" LINK NotifyHelpNode} on window level. Like this:

        <window helpnode="VideoPlayback">
        ...
        </window>

    Whenever that window is the active one then and the user presses HELP, MUI
    will automatically open the AmigaGuide file specified in
    @{"Application.HelpFile" LINK ApplicationHelpFile} and display the node specified in @{"Notify.HelpNode" LINK NotifyHelpNode}. You
    see that MUI makes it really easy for the programmers to implement a
    convenient help system in their applications. All you have to do is use it
    for your own application and your end-users will surely be grateful for it.

@NODE ContextMenus "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Context menus@{ub}

    In MUI GUIs every gadget can have its own context menu that is automatically
    popped up whenever the mouse pointer is over the gadget and the user holds
    down the right mouse button. Context menus are assigned to the different
    gadgets by using the @{"Area.ContextMenu" LINK AreaContextMenu} attribute. As @{"Area class" LINK Area} is the
    super-class for all MUI gadgets, you can use this attribute with every MUI
    object that has a visual representation in form of a gadget.

    @{"Area.ContextMenu" LINK AreaContextMenu} expects a MUI menustrip object as its argument so you have
    to create a menustrip for your context menu in XML first. It is very
    important to note that you have to declare your menustrips in the
    <application> scope because menustrips are global objects and are only
    attached to windows or gadgets later on. That is why it is not allowed to
    declare menustrips inside a <window> XML scope.

    Here is an example in which we add a cut, copy, and paste context menu to an
    object of type @{"Texteditor class" LINK Texteditor} :

        <menustrip id="ctxtmenu">
           <menu title="Context menu">
              <item>Cut</item>
              <item>Copy</item>
              <item>Paste</item>
           </menu>
        </menustrip>

        <window>
        ...
           <texteditor contextmenu="ctxtmenu"/>
        ...
        </window>

    Please note that menustrips which are used as context menus must not contain
    more than one <menu> tree.

@ENDNODE

@NODE DragNDrop "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Drag'n'drop@{ub}

    Unfortunately, MUI Royale currently does not support all of MUI's
    drag'n'drop functionality. It is, however, possible to use drag'n'drop
    operations that come from Workbench in the form of app messages.

    If your window should be able to accept these messages, you first have to
    set the @{"Window.AppWindow" LINK WindowAppWindow} attribute to TRUE. After that you have to define
    which of your MUI gadgets should accept dropped files. This is done by
    setting up a notification on the @{"Notify.AppMessage" LINK NotifyAppMessage} attribute for the desired
    gadgets. As @{"Notify class" LINK Notify} is the super-class for all MUI gadgets, you can use
    this attribute with every MUI object that has a visual representation in
    form of a gadget. If you do not want to have specific gadgets as drop
    targets, you can also setup your whole window as a drop target by simply
    setting up a notification on the @{"Notify.AppMessage" LINK NotifyAppMessage} attribute for your whole
    window.

    Whenever the user drops an icon over your window or MUI gadget then, you
    will get a notification of type AppMessage. See @{"Notify.AppMessage" LINK NotifyAppMessage} for
    details.

    When your application is iconified and the user drops files on your app icon
    you can use the attribute @{"Application.DropObject" LINK ApplicationDropObject} to define the MUI object
    which should receive the dropped file(s).

@ENDNODE

@NODE CharacterEncoding "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Character encoding@{ub}

    MUI Royale supports two character encodings in the XML files used to
    describe the GUI layout: iso-8859-1 and utf-8. If you use utf-8 encoding,
    MUI Royale will require codesets.library to do character conversion from
    UTF-8 to the system's default charset.

    Please note that MUI itself does not support UTF-8. MUI always uses the
    system's default charset. Thus, if you use UTF-8 encoding in your XML files,
    MUI Royale will try to map these strings to the system's default charset.
    This may not always succeed. For example, if the system's default charset is
    ISO-8859-1 and the UTF-8 XML file uses some Eastern European characters not
    present in ISO-8859-1 then they will not be displayed correctly. They will
    only be displayed correctly if the system's default charset has them as
    well.

@ENDNODE

@NODE HollywoodBridge "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Hollywood bridge@{ub}

    A powerful feature of MUI Royale is that it allows you to embed complete
    Hollywood displays inside your MUI GUIs using @{"Hollywood class" LINK Hollywood}. Whenever you
    draw something to a Hollywood display that is attached to Hollywood class,
    it will automatically be drawn to your MUI GUI as well. You can even hide
    the Hollywood display so that the user does not even notice that Hollywood
    is running in the background. Furthermore, all mouse clicks and key strokes
    that happen inside Hollywood class will be forwarded to the corresponding
    Hollywood display as normal Hollywood events. Thus, Hollywood class allows
    you to use almost all of Hollywood's powerful features inside a MUI GUI as
    well.

    Let's have a look at an example. The following code uses Hollywood class to
    embed a playing animation of size 320x200 inside a MUI GUI. For this, the
    Hollywood display's size is changed to 320x200 and then it is embedded in
    the MUI GUI using a MUI object of type @{"Hollywood class" LINK Hollywood}. Here is the XML GUI
    declaration first:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
        <application base="HOLIBRIDGE">
           <window title="Hollywood bridge" muiid="MAIN" notify="closerequest">
              <vgroup>
                 <hgroup>
                    <rectangle/>
                    <hollywood display="1"/>
                    <rectangle/>
                 </hgroup>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button id="play" notify="pressed">Play</button>
                    <button id="stop" notify="pressed">Stop</button>
                 </hgroup>
              </vgroup>
           </window>
        </application>

    Note that we use MUI objects of @{"Rectangle class" LINK Rectangle} to pad the non-resizable
    Hollywood object. This is necessary for the GUI to stay resizable. Here is
    the code now that shows you to connect MUI and Hollywood:

        \@ANIM 1, "amy_walks.anim"
        \@DISPLAY {Width = 320, Height = 200, Hidden = True}

        Function p_AnimFunc()
           Local numframes = GetAttribute(#ANIM, 1, #ATTRNUMFRAMES)
           curframe = Wrap(curframe + 1, 1, numframes + 1)
           DisplayAnimFrame(1, 0, 0, curframe)
        EndFunction

        Function p_EventFunc(msg)
           Switch msg.Class
           Case "Window":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "CloseRequest":
                 End
              EndSwitch
           Case "Button":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Pressed":
                 Switch msg.ID
                 Case "play":
                    SetInterval(1, p_AnimFunc, 50)
                 Case "stop":
                    ClearInterval(1)
                 EndSwitch
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch
        EndFunction

        InstallEventHandler({MUIRoyale = p_EventFunc})
        mui.CreateGUI(FileToString("GUI.xml"))

        Repeat
           WaitEvent
        Forever

    With a little bit more work we can also make the anim movable with the
    mouse. The user can then click into the Hollywood object and drag the anim
    around using his mouse. Here is the code for that:

        \@ANIM 1, "amy_walks.anim"
        \@DISPLAY {Width = 320, Height = 200, Hidden = True}

        Function p_AnimFunc()
           Local numframes = GetAttribute(#ANIM, 1, #ATTRNUMFRAMES)
           curframe = Wrap(curframe + 1, 1, numframes + 1)
           SelectBrush(1)
           Cls
           DisplayAnimFrame(1, offx, offy, curframe)
           EndSelect
           DisplayBrush(1, 0, 0)
        EndFunction

        Function p_MouseFunc()
           If IsLeftMouse() = True
             Local mx, my = MouseX(), MouseY()
             If (grabx = -1) And (graby = -1) Then
               grabx, graby = mx - offx, my - offy
             offx = mx - grabx
             offy = my - graby
           Else
             grabx, graby = -1, -1
           EndIf
        EndFunction

        Function p_EventFunc(msg)
           Switch msg.Class
           Case "Window":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "CloseRequest":
                 End
              EndSwitch
           Case "Button":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Pressed":
                 Switch msg.ID
                 Case "play":
                    SetInterval(1, p_AnimFunc, 50)
                    SetInterval(2, p_MouseFunc, 20)
                 Case "stop":
                    ClearInterval(1)
                    ClearInterval(2)
                 EndSwitch
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch
        EndFunction

        CreateBrush(1, 320, 200)

        InstallEventHandler({MUIRoyale = p_EventFunc})
        mui.CreateGUI(FileToString("GUI8.xml"))

        Repeat
           WaitEvent
        Forever

    Finally, it is also possible to make the Hollywood object resizable by
    specifying the attributes @{"Hollywood.MinWidth" LINK HollywoodMinWidth}, @{"Hollywood.MinHeight" LINK HollywoodMinHeight},
    @{"Hollywood.MaxWidth" LINK HollywoodMaxWidth}, and @{"Hollywood.MaxHeight" LINK HollywoodMaxHeight}. Whenever the user resizes the
    MUI window, your Hollywood display will receive a SizeWindow event that you
    can listen to using the InstallEventHandler() Hollywood function. When using
    a resizable Hollywood object, we can remove the two <rectangle> objects used
    solely as padding space. The XML code looks like this then:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
        <application base="HOLIBRIDGE">
           <window title="Hollywood bridge" muiid="MAIN" notify="closerequest">
              <vgroup>
                 <hollywood display="1" minwidth="32" minheight="32"
                    maxwidth="16384" maxheight="16384"/>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button id="play" notify="pressed">Play</button>
                    <button id="stop" notify="pressed">Stop</button>
                 </hgroup>
              </vgroup>
           </window>
        </application>

    Note that we specify 16384 for both @{"Hollywood.MaxWidth" LINK HollywoodMaxWidth} and
    @{"Hollywood.MaxHeight" LINK HollywoodMaxHeight}. This is to indicate that our Hollywood object doesn't
    really have a maximum size. That is why we set these two attribute to the
    maximum allowable size of 16384 pixels. This should be sufficiently large
    enough for most purposes.

    Our code is pretty much the same as before with the exception that we now
    have to handle the SizeWindow event to take care of GUI resize events. Here
    is the adapted code from above:

        \@ANIM 1, "amy_walks.anim"
        \@DISPLAY {Width = 320, Height = 200, Hidden = True}

        Function p_AnimFunc()
           Local numframes = GetAttribute(#ANIM, 1, #ATTRNUMFRAMES)
           curframe = Wrap(curframe + 1, 1, numframes + 1)
           SelectBrush(1)
           Cls
           DisplayAnimFrame(1, offx, offy, curframe,
             {Width = swidth, Height = sheight})
           EndSelect
           DisplayBrush(1, 0, 0)
        EndFunction

        Function p_MouseFunc()
           If IsLeftMouse() = True
             Local mx, my = MouseX(), MouseY()
             If (grabx = -1) And (graby = -1) Then
               grabx, graby = mx - offx, my - offy
             offx = mx - grabx
             offy = my - graby
           Else
             grabx, graby = -1, -1
           EndIf
        EndFunction

        Function p_EventFunc(msg)
           If msg.Action = "SizeWindow"
             swidth = msg.Width
             sheight = msg.Height
             CreateBrush(1, swidth, sheight)
             Return
           EndIf

           Switch msg.Class
           Case "Window":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "CloseRequest":
                 End
              EndSwitch
           Case "Button":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Pressed":
                 Switch msg.ID
                 Case "play":
                    SetInterval(1, p_AnimFunc, 50)
                    SetInterval(2, p_MouseFunc, 20)
                 Case "stop":
                    ClearInterval(1)
                    ClearInterval(2)
                 EndSwitch
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch
        EndFunction

        swidth, sheight = 320, 200
        CreateBrush(1, swidth, sheight)

        InstallEventHandler({MUIRoyale = p_EventFunc, SizeWindow = p_EventFunc})
        mui.CreateGUI(FileToString("GUI8.xml"))

        Repeat
           WaitEvent
        Forever

    From this example you can see that @{"Hollywood class" LINK Hollywood} is really quite powerful
    and can be used to achieve lots of innovative GUI ideas only limited by your
    creativity. By the way, the example above is also included in the MUI Royale
    distribution. You can find it in the drawer Examples/Hollywood.

    Note: These topics aren't discussed here just for fun. You will annoy lots
    of users if you don't pay attention to them!

    File Requester:
              Even if MUI features a file list and a volume list object and
              makes building a private file requester very easy, you should
              always provide a possibility to pop up a standard asl requester
              for this purpose. Just add a little popup button right beneath
              your file string gadget and everything will be fine. MUI offers a
              file-popup object exactly for this purpose. Note well: Many users
              (including myself) move programs with non-standard file requesters
              into the trashcan immediately.

    Window Size:
              With MUI, it's very easy to have lots of gadgets within a single
              window. Since you as a programmer usually have a more powerful
              system with higher graphic resolutions as most of your users,
              windows tend to become too big. You should always make sure that
              everything you design fits on a standard 640x256 screen with a
              topaz/8 font. Otherwise, MUI will try to use very small fonts or
              virtual groups to make your window fit, making your application
              look and feel bad.

    Keyboard Control:
              Even if you're a "mouse-only" user, add keyboard cycle chains and
              gadget shortcuts to your application. It's very few work for you
              and helps lots of users. See @{"Cycle chain" LINK CycleChain} for details.

    Background:
              MUI allows the user to adjust lots of different backgrounds for
              objects. Even if you don't use this feature, you should always
              test your program with a fancy background pattern configuration
              and check whether all your buttons really have button backgrounds,
              all your framed texts really have text backgrounds, etc.

    Add a shortcut to MUI preferences:
              Every MUI program should include a menu item that allows the user
              to configure the appearance of the program using the MUI
              preferences program. This can be done very easily by adding a menu
              item that simply runs the method @{"Application.OpenConfigWindow" LINK ApplicationOpenConfigWindow} on
              the application object. Also, you should include "About MUI" and
              "About MUI Royale" menu items that show the "About MUI" and "About
              MUI Royale" windows which you can open using the
              @{"Application.AboutMUI" LINK ApplicationAboutMUI} and @{"Application.AboutMUIRoyale" LINK ApplicationAboutMUIRoyale} methods
              respectively.

    And last...
              Don't forget the traditional Amiga style guide!

@NODE Tutorial "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Tutorial@{ub}

    Welcome to the MUI Royale tutorial! This small step-by-step document will
    guide you through the process of creating your first GUI with MUI Royale in
    very few steps.

    See image: @{"tutorial.png" LINK "Guide/tutorial.png/MAIN"}

    Let us start with the basics: In MUI Royale GUIs are created using XML files
    that contain a description of a number of windows containing a variety of
    GUI elements. Here is a minimal GUI description for a MUI Royale GUI that
    contains a window with a listview, a string gadget, and two buttons in XML
    format:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
        <application base="HELLOWORLD">
           <window title="Example GUI" muiid="MAIN">
              <vgroup>
                 <listview>
                    <column/>
                 </listview>
                 <string/>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button>Add</button>
                    <button>Remove</button>
                 </hgroup>
              </vgroup>
           </window>
        </application>

    The application base is set to HELLOWORLD. It is very important that you
    always define the @{"Application.Base" LINK ApplicationBase} attribute because the string you specify
    in this attribute is used by MUI to store the program-specific preferences
    in an external file (usually in ENV:MUI). The <application> object is the
    MUI master object for every application and must only be used once per
    application. All other MUI objects are children of @{"Application class" LINK Application}.

    It is also important to set the attribute @{"Window.MuiID" LINK WindowMuiID} for every window
    because only windows that have a MUI id remember their position and size.
    Also, only windows that have @{"Window.MuiID" LINK WindowMuiID} can be snapshot by the user from
    the window's context menu. Thus, it is very important that you set this
    attribute for all your windows.

    To see how our XML declaration above looks as a MUI GUI, we have to save it
    to a file named GUI.xml and then use the following code to turn it into a
    full-blown MUI GUI:

        \@DISPLAY {Hidden = True}

        mui.CreateGUI(FileToString("GUI.xml"))

        Repeat
           WaitEvent
        Forever

    Please note that we use the \@DISPLAY preprocessor command to hide the
    Hollywood display that will popup by default. We do not want to have this
    display because we already have a MUI GUI that shall be the visual
    representation of our program. Keep in mind, though, that the Hollywood
    display is still there. It is just hidden. Hollywood's conception says that
    there always must be a valid display. That is why we cannot remove the
    Hollywood display completely. All we can do is to hide it. You can still
    draw to it, though.

    You should also add some information about your program using the
    \@APPAUTHOR, \@APPCOPYRIGHT, \@APPDESCRIPTION, \@APPTITLE, and \@APPVERSION
    preprocessor commands. MUI needs this information for several purposes, e.g.
    the information passed in \@APPTITLE is used by the MUI preferences window.
    Here is an example declaration of these preprocessor commands:

        \@APPTITLE "Tutorial"
        \@APPVERSION "$VER: Tutorial 1.0 (27.12.12)"
        \@APPCOPYRIGHT "Copyright ©2012, Andreas Falkenhahn"
        \@APPAUTHOR "Andreas Falkenhahn"
        \@APPDESCRIPTION "The tutorial app from the MUI Royale guide"

    When you run the code above you will notice that the window does not react
    on clicks on its close gadget. You have to use CTRL-C or Exchange to close
    the program. Of course, we want our program to be closable via the window's
    close gadget as well. In order to achieve this, we need to setup a
    notification on the @{"Window.CloseRequest" LINK WindowCloseRequest} attribute that will be set whenever
    the user hits the close gadget. We can setup this notification by modifying
    our XML code from above like this:

        <window title="Example GUI" muiid="MAIN" notify="closerequest">

    The next thing we have to do is install an event handler callback using the
    InstallEventHandler() Hollywood function because our Hollywood script needs
    to be informed every time a MUI Royale event comes in. Thus, we have to
    modify our code as follows:

        \@DISPLAY {Hidden = True}

        Function p_EventFunc(msg)

           Switch msg.Class
           Case "Window":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "CloseRequest":
                 End
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch

        EndFunction

        InstallEventHandler({MUIRoyale = p_EventFunc})
        mui.CreateGUI(FileToString("GUI.xml"))

        Repeat
           WaitEvent
        Forever

    What we have done here is installing the function p_EventFunc as an event
    handler callback that gets executed whenever a MUI Royale event comes in.
    When we get such an event, we then have to check which MUI class and
    attribute has triggered it. This is done by looking into the msg.Class and
    msg.Attribute fields of the event message that our callback receives as its
    first parameter. In order to react on the @{"Window.CloseRequest" LINK WindowCloseRequest} attribute, we
    thus have to look for an event from class Window and attribute CloseRequest.
    When we have found such an event, we simply call the End() command to
    terminate our program.

    The next thing we want to do is add the functionality that whenever the user
    presses the "Add" button the text in the string gadget should get added to
    the listview as the last entry. To do this, we first have to find a way of
    identifying our MUI gadgets from the Hollywood script. This is done by
    giving them IDs in the XML declaration. IDs are simply text strings that are
    used for talking to MUI objects from Hollywood scripts. So let's add some
    IDs now for all gadgets that we need to talk to. We have to modify our XML
    declaration like this:

        ...
                 <listview id="mylistview">
                    <column/>
                 </listview>
                 <string id="mystring"/>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button id="mybt1">Add</button>
                    <button id="mybt2">Remove</button>
                 </hgroup>
        ...

    Now we have to setup some notifications so that our event handler callback
    does not only inform us about changes in the @{"Window.CloseRequest" LINK WindowCloseRequest} attribute
    but also in the @{"Button.Pressed" LINK ButtonPressed} attribute which is the attribute that gets
    set to TRUE whenever the user hits a button. To listen to these button
    clicks we have to modify our code like this:

        ...
                    <button id="mybt1" notify="pressed">Add</button>
                    <button id="mybt2" notify="pressed">Remove</button>
        ...

    Now that we have done this we can add some code to our event handler
    callback that grabs the contents of the string gadget and adds it to the end
    of the list in our listview object. This is done by first calling @{"mui.Get()" LINK muiGet}
    on the @{"String.Contents" LINK StringContents} attribute to get the contents of the string gadget
    and then running the method @{"Listview.Insert" LINK ListviewInsert} on the listview gadget using
    @{"mui.DoMethod()" LINK muiDoMethod} to insert the entry into the listview. Here is the code that
    has to be inserted into p_EventFunc for this purpose:

           Switch msg.Class
           ...
           Case "Button":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Pressed":
                 Switch msg.ID
                 Case "mybt1":    ; "Add" button was pressed
                    Local s$ = mui.Get("mystring", "contents")
                    mui.DoMethod("mylistview", "insert", "bottom", s$)
                 EndSwitch
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch

    The next thing we want to do is implement the functionality of our "Remove"
    button. Whenever this button is pressed, we want the active entry to be
    removed from the listview. We can do this by running the @{"Listview.Remove" LINK ListviewRemove}
    method on the listview. Hence, we have to modify our code like this:

                 Switch msg.ID
                 ...
                 Case "mybt2":    ; "Remove" button was pressed
                    mui.DoMethod("mylistview", "remove", "active")
                 EndSwitch

    Now we want the active entry of the listview to be automatically displayed
    in the string gadget. For this purpose we have to setup a notification on
    the @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute which is triggered whenever the active entry
    of the listview changes. Thus, we have to modify our XML file like this:

        ...
                 <listview id="mylistview" notify="active">
                    <column/>
                 </listview>
        ...

    In our event handler callback we can implement this functionality quite
    easily by running the @{"Listview.GetEntry" LINK ListviewGetEntry} method and then setting the string
    gadgets contents using the @{"String.Contents" LINK StringContents} attribute. Here is the code for
    doing that:

           Switch msg.Class
           ...
           Case "Listview":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Active":
                 Local s$ = mui.DoMethod("mylistview", "getentry", "active")
                 mui.Set("mystring", "contents", s$)
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch

    If you try this code, you will set that the @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute is not
    only triggered when the user selects a new listview entry with his mouse,
    but also when entries are removed from the listview and thus cause a new
    entry becoming the active one.

    The next thing we want to do is disable the "Remove" button when there is no
    active entry in the listview. We can disable MUI gadgets by setting the
    @{"Area.Disabled" LINK AreaDisabled} attribute to TRUE. As there are no entries in the listview
    initially, we have to set @{"Area.Disabled" LINK AreaDisabled} to TRUE already at the start of our
    program. So you have to insert this code:

        ...
        mui.CreateGUI(FileToString("GUI.xml"))
        mui.Set("mybt2", "disabled", True)
        ...

    Now we have to make some modifications to our event handler callback.
    Whenever we get the notification on @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} we have to check if it
    is different from the special value "Off". If that is the case, we will
    enable the "Remove" gadget. The special value "Off" (-1) is returned by
    @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} whenever there is no active entry in the listview. We have
    to modify our code like this:

           Switch msg.Class
           ...
           Case "Listview":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Active":
                 Local s$ = mui.DoMethod("mylistview", "getentry", "active")
                 mui.Set("mystring", "contents", s$)
                 mui.Set("mybt2", "disabled", IIf(msg.triggervalue = -1,
                     True, False))
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch

    We use the field msg.TriggerValue here. This always contains the current
    value of the attribute that has triggered the event, i.e. in our case it
    contains the current value of the @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute. We could also
    call @{"mui.Get()" LINK muiGet} manually on @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} first, but this is not really
    required because we can simply use the msg.TriggerValue shortcut.

    The last thing we want to do is add a menu to our GUI. All MUI programs
    should have a menu item that allows the user to customize the program's
    appearance using the MUI preferences. This is done by running the
    @{"Application.OpenConfigWindow" LINK ApplicationOpenConfigWindow} method on the application object. Also, every
    MUI program should have the menu items "About MUI" and "About MUI Royale"
    that inform the user that this program was done using MUI and MUI Royale.
    You can popup the these windows by running the @{"Application.AboutMUI" LINK ApplicationAboutMUI} and
    @{"Application.AboutMUIRoyale" LINK ApplicationAboutMUIRoyale} methods on the application object respectively.
    To add these menus to our program, we use the @{"Menustrip class" LINK Menustrip}. Here is the
    XML code that you have to add before your window declaration:

        ...
        <application base="HELLOWORLD">
           <menustrip id="mymenustrip">
              <menu title="Project">
                 <item id="menabout" notify="selected">About...</item>
                 <item id="menaboutmui" notify="selected">About MUI...</item>
                 <item id="menaboutmuiroyale" notify="selected">
                    About MUI Royale...</item>
                 <item/>
                 <item id="menquit" notify="selected" shortcut="Q">Quit</item>
              </menu>
              <menu title="Settings">
                 <item id="menmuiset" notify="selected">MUI...</item>
              </menu>
           </menustrip>
           ...
        </application>

    After we have created our menustrip object using the XML code above we have
    to attach this menustrip to our window. This is done by setting the
    @{"Window.Menustrip" LINK WindowMenustrip} attribute to our menustrip object. Here is the XML code for
    this:

        <window title="Example GUI" muiid="MAIN" notify="closerequest"
            menustrip="mymenustrip">

    As you can see in the XML code above, we have already added notifications on
    the @{"Menuitem.Selected" LINK MenuitemSelected} attribute to get informed whenever the user selects a
    menu item. Now we have to add code to our event handler function that takes
    the appropriate action when a menu item is selected. Before we can do that,
    however, we need to assign an ID to our application object because we need
    to use @{"mui.DoMethod()" LINK muiDoMethod} on it. Here is how the XML code needs to be adapted:

        <application base="HELLOWORLD" id="app">

    Now we can write the code for our event handler callback function that

    Some final touches to our program could be adding online help to our gadgets
    by using the @{"Area.ShortHelp" LINK AreaShortHelp} attribute and adding all objects to the keyboard
    cycle chain so that the GUI can also be controlled via keyboard. We do not
    have to add the buttons to our keyboard cycle chain, because this is always
    done automatically. We have to add the listview and the string gadgets
    manually, though. Adding objects to the keyboard cycle chain is done by
    using the @{"Area.CycleChain" LINK AreaCycleChain} attribute. Also, it is advised that you listen to
    the ShowWindow and HideWindow events that can come from the Exchange program
    in Commodities and act accordingly. So here is how our final program looks
    like with these two last enhancements applied. First the XML file:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
        <application base="HELLOWORLD" id="app">
           <menustrip id="mymenustrip">

                 <item id="menaboutmui" notify="selected">About MUI...</item>
                 <item id="menaboutmuiroyale" notify="selected">
                    About MUI Royale...</item>
                 <item/>
                 <item id="menquit" notify="selected" shortcut="Q">Quit</item>
              </menu>
              <menu title="Settings">
                 <item id="menmuiset" notify="selected">MUI...</item>
              </menu>
           </menustrip>
           <window title="Example GUI" muiid="MAIN" notify="closerequest"
                        menustrip="mymenustrip">
              <vgroup>
                <listview id="mylistview" notify="active" shorthelp="A listview"
                    cyclechain="true">
                    <column/>
                 </listview>
                 <string id="mystring" shorthelp="Enter entry name here"
                     cyclechain="true"/>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button id="mybt1" notify="pressed"
                          shorthelp="Add new entry">Add</button>
                    <button id="mybt2" notify="pressed"
                          shorthelp="Remove entry">Remove</button>

              </vgroup>

@NODE muiCreateGUI "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        mui.CreateGUI -- create application object from an XML source

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        mui.CreateGUI(xml$)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function creates a MUI GUI from the XML description passed in the
        xml$ argument, i.e. it establishes the MUI master application object
        with all of its children. Please note that xml$ must be a string that
        contains the XML GUI declaration and not a filename. If you want to use
        an XML GUI declaration from an external file, you have to convert that
        file into a string first, e.g. using the FileToString() Hollywood
        function.

        Once this function returns, you can talk to all your MUI objects that
        you have defined in the XML GUI declaration using the @{"mui.Set()" LINK muiSet},
        @{"mui.Get()" LINK muiGet} and @{"mui.DoMethod()" LINK muiDoMethod} functions.

        Please note that there can be only one application object per task so
        this function can only be called once. If you want to call
        mui.CreateGUI() a second time, you have to free the old GUI first using
        the @{"mui.FreeGUI()" LINK muiFreeGUI} call.

        If you need to dynamically add objects like windows or buttons to your
        application object, you can use the @{"mui.CreateObject()" LINK muiCreateObject} function to do
        this.

   @{b}INPUTS@{ub}
        xml$      a string containing an XML GUI description

   @{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}
        mui.CreateGUI([[

@NODE muiCreateObject "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        mui.CreateObject -- create MUI object from an XML source (V1.2)

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        mui.CreateObject(xml$)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to dynamically create a MUI object from an XML
        source. When mui.CreateObject() returns, the newly created MUI object
        won't be attached to any parent object and will live in a state of
        isolation from your application object created by @{"mui.CreateGUI()" LINK muiCreateGUI}.
        Thus, to break this state of isolation you first have to attach the
        object to a parent object which can be either a group object, a menu
        object, or an application object. If your newly allocated MUI object is
        a window object, you will have to to attach it to the application object
        by using the @{"Application.AddWindow" LINK ApplicationAddWindow} method. To attach menu objects you
        have to use the @{"Menustrip.AddHead" LINK MenustripAddHead}, @{"Menustrip.AddTail" LINK MenustripAddTail}, @{"Menustrip.Insert" LINK MenustripInsert},
        @{"Menu.AddHead" LINK MenuAddHead}, @{"Menu.AddTail" LINK MenuAddTail}, or @{"Menu.Insert" LINK MenuInsert} methods. All other objects
        can be attached by using the group methods @{"Group.AddHead" LINK GroupAddHead}, @{"Group.AddTail" LINK GroupAddTail}
        and @{"Group.Insert" LINK GroupInsert},

        In contrast to @{"mui.CreateGUI()" LINK muiCreateGUI} you can call mui.CreateObject() as often
        as you like as it doesn't create an application object for you but just
        detached MUI objects of which you can have as many as you like.

        It is important that you specify an ID for your MUI object in the XML
        declaration because you need this ID to refer to this object when you
        want to add it to an application or group object.

        Once this function returns, you can talk to the newly created MUI object
        (and to all of its children) using the @{"mui.Set()" LINK muiSet}, @{"mui.Get()" LINK muiGet} and
        @{"mui.DoMethod()" LINK muiDoMethod} functions.

        Detached MUI objects can be freed using the @{"mui.FreeObject()" LINK muiFreeObject} function
        but you only have to call this in specific cases, e.g. if you are
        dealing with lots of dynamically allocated MUI objects and you want to
        do some housekeeping to save on memory and resources.

   @{b}INPUTS@{ub}
        xml$      a string containing an XML MUI object description

   @{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}
        mui.CreateObject([[
        <window id="newwindow" title="A new window" notify="closerequest">
          <vgroup>
              <button>Hello World!</button>
           </vgroup>
        </window>
        ]])
        
        mui.DoMethod("app", "addwindow", "newwindow")
        mui.Set("newwindow", "open", True)

        The code above creates a new window, adds it to the existing application
        object and opens it.

        ---

        mui.CreateObject([[
        <button id="newbutton">Dynamically created button!</button>
        ]])
        
        mui.DoMethod("mygroup", "initchange")
        mui.DoMethod("mygroup", "addtail", "newbutton")
        mui.DoMethod("mygroup", "exitchange", false)

        The code above dynamically creates a new button object and adds it as
        the last child to the group that has the ID "mygroup".

@NODE muiDoMethod "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        mui.DoMethod -- run method on MUI object

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        r = mui.DoMethod(id$, method$, ...)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to run a method on the specified MUI object.
        You have to pass the identifier of the MUI object in the first argument
        and the name of the method in the second argument. Method and object IDs
        are case insensitive, i.e. it does not matter if you use upper or lower
        case characters.

        The methods that you can use with this function depend on the class of
        the specified MUI object. Have a look at the class reference to see what
        methods are supported by the different MUI classes.

        Also, the arguments that you have to pass to this function after the
        method name depend on the method. They are different for every method.
        The same is true for return values. Some methods return values, some do
        not. Please refer to the class reference to see which arguments your
        method requires and whether there are return values for your method.

   @{b}INPUTS@{ub}
        id$       identifier of MUI object to run method on
        method$   method name as a string
        ...       additional arguments depend on the method (see class reference
                  for details)

   @{b}RESULTS@{ub}
        r         return value depends on method type

   @{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}
        mui.DoMethod("my_listview", "insert", "bottom", "Last entry")

        The code above adds a new entry named "Last entry" to the bottom of the
        listview using the identifier "my_listview". This is done by running the
        @{"Listview.Insert()" LINK ListviewInsert} method on the listview object.

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Use this call to delete the entire GUI object created using the last
        call to @{"mui.CreateGUI()" LINK muiCreateGUI}. mui.FreeGUI() will delete the whole MUI master
        application object. All windows will be closed and their children will
        be deleted. After this call returns, you could create a new GUI using
        the @{"mui.CreateGUI()" LINK muiCreateGUI} function if you want.

@NODE muiFreeImage "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        mui.FreeImage -- free brush in image cache (V1.7)

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        mui.FreeImage(id)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to free a brush in MUI Royale's internal image
        cache. You have to pass the identifier of the brush that should be
        freed. Alternatively, you can also pass -1 to this function to free all
        brushes in MUI Royale's internal image cache.

        You must make sure that the specified brush is no longer used by any
        widgets in your GUI before you call this function. Note that under
        normal conditions it is not necessary to call this function because
        normally all brushes are freed automatically by MUI Royale. Under
        certain conditions, however, it can be useful to call this function.

        MUI Royale caches all Hollywood brushes that you use as images in your
        GUI. That is why when you try to use a Hollywood brush in your GUI a
        second time, it will just be loaded from MUI Royale's internal image
        cache for performance reasons, regardless of the brush's current
        contents inside Hollywood. This can lead to unwanted behaviour in case
        you have updated your brush's graphics in the meantime and you want MUI
        Royale to use the updated graphics. In that case, you first have to free
        the brush in MUI Royale's internal image cache by using this function.
        When you pass the brush to MUI Royale again then, it will be re-created
        from the brush's current state and it will be cached anew.

   @{b}INPUTS@{ub}
        id        identifier of brush to free or -1 to free all brushes

@NODE muiFreeObject "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        mui.FreeObject -- delete a detached MUI object (V1.2)

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        mui.FreeObject(id$)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to delete a detached MUI object that has been
        created either by @{"mui.CreateObject()" LINK muiCreateObject} or @{"mui.CreateGUI()" LINK muiCreateGUI}. The MUI object
        that you specify here must not be attached to an application, group, or
        menu object any longer because attached MUI objects are freed with their
        parent so make sure you only use this function with MUI objects that
        have been detached from their parent and are no longer bound to any
        parent object.

        To detach MUI objects from their respective parents, you have to use one
        of the following methods: @{"Application.RemoveWindow" LINK ApplicationRemoveWindow}, @{"Menustrip.Remove" LINK MenustripRemove},
        @{"Menu.Remove" LINK MenuRemove} or @{"Group.Remove" LINK GroupRemove}.

        When MUI Royale exits, it will automatically free all detached MUI
        objects so unless your program constantly adds and removes MUI objects
        at runtime, you will normally not have to call this function at all.

        mui.Get -- get value of a MUI object attribute

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        r = mui.Get(id$, attr$)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to retrieve the current value of the attribute
        attr$ in the MUI object specified in id$. Attribute names and object IDs
        are case insensitive, i.e. it does not matter if you use upper or lower
        case characters for them.

        The attributes that you can use with this function depend on the class
        of the specified MUI object. Have a look at the class reference to see
        what attributes are supported by the different MUI classes. In order to
        use an attribute with this function, it needs to have an applicability
        of "G". Attributes of @{"Area class" LINK Area} and @{"Notify class" LINK Notify} can be used on almost
        all other classes because the Area and Notify classes act as
        superclasses for most of the other classes.

   @{b}INPUTS@{ub}
        id$       identifier of MUI object to query
        attr$     attribute whose value should be retrieved

   @{b}RESULTS@{ub}

   @{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}
        DebugPrint(mui.Get("my_listview", "active"))

        The code above returns the index of the currently active entry in the
        listview that has the identifier "my_listview" by querying the
        @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute.

@NODE muiNotify "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        mui.Notify -- add/remove notification on a MUI object attribute

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        mui.Notify(id$, attr$, enable)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to add or remove a notification on the
        attribute attr$ in the MUI object specified in id$. You have to pass the
        attribute name and a boolean flag that indicates whether you want to
        enable or disable notifications on that attribute. Attribute names and
        object IDs are case insensitive, i.e. it does not matter if you use
        upper or lower case characters for them.

        The attributes that you can use with this function depend on the class
        of the specified MUI object. Have a look at the class reference to see
        what attributes are supported by the different MUI classes. In order to
        use an attribute with this function, it needs to have an applicability
        of "N". Attributes of @{"Area class" LINK Area} and @{"Notify class" LINK Notify} can be used on almost
        all other classes because the Area and Notify classes act as
        superclasses for most of the other classes.

        Once you have setup a notification on a certain object attribute, you
        can listen to these events by installing a MUI Royale event handler
        callback using the InstallEventHandler() Hollywood function. See
        @{"Notifications" LINK Notifications} for details.

        Please note that notifications can also be setup in the XML GUI
        declaration by using the Notify tag. See @{"Notifications" LINK Notifications} for details.

   @{b}INPUTS@{ub}
        id$       identifier of MUI object to use
        attr$     attribute to listen to

                  from this object

   @{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}
        mui.Notify("my_listview", "active", True)

        The code above installs a notification that triggers whenever the
        @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute changes in the listview that has the
        identifier "my_listview".

@NODE muiRequest "MUI Royale Guide"

        mui.Request -- popup a MUI system requester

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        r = mui.Request(title$, body$, gadgets$[, icon$])

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function pops up a standard MUI requester that displays a message
        (body$) and also allows the user to make a selection using one of the
        gadgets specified by gadgets$. Using a MUI requester instead of a
        standard system requester offers you the possibility to include text
        containing all the text engine format codes.

        Separate the gadgets specified in gadgets$ by a "|". The return value
        tells you which gadget the user pressed. Please note that the right most
        gadget always has the value of FALSE (0) because it is typically used as
        the "Cancel" gadget. If you have for example three gadget choices
        "One|Two|Three", the gadget "Three" has return value 0, "Two" returns 2,
        and "One" returns 1.

        If you precede an entry with a '*' in gadgets$, this answer will become
        the active object. Pressing <Return> will terminate the requester with
        this response. A '_' character indicates the keyboard shortcut for this
        response.

        The strings you specify in body$ and gadgets$ can use text formatting
        codes. See @{"Text formatting codes" LINK TextFormat} for details.

        Starting with MUI Royale 1.4 this function accepts an optional argument
        named icon$. This allows you to specify the icon to show in the
        requester window. Note that this is currently only supported by MUI 4
        and up on AmigaOS 3 and AmigaOS 4. The MorphOS MUI doesn't support this
        feature yet. The following predefined values are accepted for icon$:

        "None":   no icon

        "Information":
                  an information sign

        "Error":  an error sign

        "Warning":
                  a warning sign

        "Question":
                  a question mark

   @{b}INPUTS@{ub}
        title$    title for the requester; pass an empty string ("") to use the
                  default title
        body$     text to appear in the body of the requester
        gadgets$  one or more gadgets that the user can press
        icon$     optional: icon to show in the requester (defaults to
                  "Information") (V1.4)

        mui.Set -- set value of a MUI object attribute

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        mui.Set(id$, attr1$, val1$, ...)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to set the current value of one or more
        attributes in the MUI object specified in id$. You have to pass the
        attribute name and desired new value for every attribute you want to
        modify. You can repeat these attribute/value pairs as often as you like
        to modify multiple attributes with just a single call to mui.Set().
        Attribute names and object IDs are case insensitive, i.e. it does not
        matter if you use upper or lower case characters for them.

        The attributes that you can use with this function depend on the class
        of the specified MUI object. Have a look at the class reference to see
        what attributes are supported by the different MUI classes. In order to
        use an attribute with this function, it needs to have an applicability
        of "S". Attributes of @{"Area class" LINK Area} and @{"Notify class" LINK Notify} can be used on almost
        all other classes because the Area and Notify classes act as
        superclasses for most of the other classes.

        If you have setup a notification on the attribute that you want to
        modify using this function, the notification will be triggered once you
        call mui.Set() on that attribute. If you do not want this behaviour, you
        can use the @{"Notify.NoNotify" LINK NotifyNoNotify} attribute to prevent a notification from
        being issued.

   @{b}INPUTS@{ub}
        id$       identifier of MUI object to modify
        attr1$    attribute whose value should be modified
        val1$     new value for the attribute
        ...       you can repeat attribute/value pairs as often as you like

   @{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}
        mui.Set("my_listview", "active", 15)

        The code above sets entry number 15 as currently active entry in the
        listview that has the identifier "my_listview" by setting the
        @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute.

        ---

        mui.Set("my_listview", "nonotify", True, "active", 15)

        This code does the same as the code above but prevents notifications
        from being issued by setting the @{"Notify.NoNotify" LINK NotifyNoNotify} attribute to TRUE. This
        is useful if you need to distinguish between user selections in the
        listview and selections made programmatically using mui.Set().

    Application class is the master class for all MUI applications. It serves as
    a kind of anchor for all input, either coming from the user or somewhere
    from the system, e.g. commodities or ARexx messages.

    An application can have any number of sub windows, these windows are the
    children of the application. Every GUI definition has to start with the
    application class.

        When the HELP button is pressed and the application defines a
        Application.HelpFile, MUI tries to obtain @{"Notify.HelpNode" LINK NotifyHelpNode} from the
        current object (the one under the mouse pointer). If @{"Notify.HelpNode" LINK NotifyHelpNode} is
        not defined, MUI continues asking the parent object for this attribute
        (usually a group, but remember: the parent of a windows root object is
        the window itself, the parent of a window is the application).

        When an @{"Notify.HelpNode" LINK NotifyHelpNode} is found, the same procedure is applied to
        @{"Notify.HelpLine" LINK NotifyHelpLine}. Then MUI puts the application to sleep and displays
        the file at the position specified with @{"Notify.HelpNode" LINK NotifyHelpNode} and/or
        @{"Notify.HelpLine" LINK NotifyHelpLine}.

        This behaviour allows you to define one Application.HelpFile for your

@NODE Area "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Area class is a super class for every other MUI class except windows and
    applications. It holds information about an object's current position, size
    and weight and manages frames, fonts and backgrounds.

    Because Area class is the super class for every MUI gadget, you can use all
    of its attributes with all other MUI classes that create gadgets. For
    example, you can use @{"Area.ShortHelp" LINK AreaShortHelp} to add bubble help to a button, or you
    could use @{"Area.ContextMenu" LINK AreaContextMenu} to add a context menu to a listview, etc.

@NODE AreaBackground "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        Area.Background -- adjust background of an object

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Adjust the background for an object.

        Every MUI object has its own background setting. The background is
        displayed "behind" the actual object contents, e.g. behind a the text of
        a text object or behind the image of an image object.

        An object without a specific background setting will inherit the pattern
        from its parent group. The default background for a window and many
        other background patterns are adjustable with the preferences program.

        The following background settings are possible:

        - WindowBack
        - RequesterBack
        - ButtonBack
        - ListBack
        - TextBack

        - pre_MarkShine
        - pre_MarkHalfshine
        - pre_MarkBackground

        All backgrounds with "pre" are MUI's predefined patterns. These are not
        configurable by the user and will always look the same.

        Note: It is *important* that you test your programs with a fancy pattern
        configuration. With the default setting you won't notice any errors in
        your backgrounds.

        other background patterns are adjustable with the preferences program.

        Please note that it is generally not a good idea to change the
        background to a hard-coded image because this can easily clash with the
        user's current skin settings. Remember that everything in MUI is

        defining your own color schemes.

        From the Hollywood script the color is specified as a simple numerical
        value containing 8 bits for each component. When you specify the color
        in the XML file, it has to be passed as a 6 character string prefixed by

        Whenever the user hits the RMB and the mouse is above the parent object,
        MUI will present the popup menu instead of the windows menu.

        Please note that menustrips which are used as context menus must not

        In MUI Royale 1.0 this attribute could only be used at initialization
        stage. Starting with MUI Royale 1.1 it has an applicability of "IS"

        Define a frame for the current object. Since area class is a superclass

        wish.

        You don't adjust the style of your frame directly, instead you only
        specify a type:

        None      For no frame.

        Button    For standard buttons with text in it.

        ImageButton
                  For small buttons with images, e.g. the arrows of a scrollbar.

        Text      For a text field, e.g. a status line display.

        String    For a string gadget.

        ReadList  For a read only list.

        InputList For a list that handles input (has a cursor).

        Prop      For proportional gadgets.

        Gauge     For gauge gadgets.

        Group     For groups.

        PopUp     For popup gadgets.

        Virtual   For virtual groups.

        Slider    For slider gadgets.

        How the frame is going to look is adjustable via the preferences
        program.

        Four spacing values belong to each frame that tell MUI how many pixels
        should be left free between the frame and its contents. These spacing
        values are also user adjustable as long as you don't override them with
        one of @{"Area.InnerLeft" LINK AreaInnerLeft}, @{"Area.InnerRight" LINK AreaInnerRight}, @{"Area.InnerTop" LINK AreaInnerTop}, or
        @{"Area.InnerBottom" LINK AreaInnerBottom}.

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Setting this to TRUE causes the specified frame to be a horizontal
        phantom frame. The frame will not appear but its vertical components
        (frame height, inner top and inner bottom spacing) will be used to
        calculate positions and dimensions (horizontal components are treated as
        0).

        This is extremely useful for a correct labeling of objects. You would

        This tag is a shorthand for @{"Area.HorizWeight" LINK AreaHorizWeight} and @{"Area.VertWeight" LINK AreaVertWeight}, it
        sets both weights at once.

        The weight of an object determines how much room it will get during the
        layout process. Imagine you have a 100 pixel wide horizontal group with
        two string gadgets. Usually, each gadget will get half of the room and
        be 50 pixels wide. If you feel the left gadget is more important and
        should be bigger, you can give it a weight of 200 (and 100 for the right
        gadget). Because the left gadget is twice as "heavy" as the right
        gadget, it will become twice as big (about 66 pixel) as the right one
        (34 pixel).

        Of course giving weights only makes sense if the object is resizable. A
        @{"Area.VertWeight" LINK AreaVertWeight} for a (always fixed height) string gadget is useless.

        An object with a weight of 0 will always stay at its minimum size.

        By default, all objects have a weight of 100.

@NODE Cycle "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Cycle class generates the well known cycle gadgets. However, MUI cycle
    gadgets feature a (configurable) popup menu to avoid clicking through many
    entries.

    When you declare a cycle gadget, you have to use the <item> tag to fill the
    cycle gadget with items. Every cycle gadget needs to have at least one item.

    Here is an example XML excerpt for creating a cycle gadget:

        <cycle id="printer">
            <item>HP Deskjet</item>
            <item>NEC P6</item>
            <item>Okimate 20</item>
        </cycle>

    The cycle entries that you specify using the <item> tag can use text
    formatting codes. See @{"Text formatting codes" LINK TextFormat} for details.

    @{"Cycle.Active                      " LINK CycleActive} Set/get active cycle item

@NODE CycleActive "MUI Royale Guide"

        This attributes defines the number of the active entry in the cycle
        gadgets. Valid range is from 0 for the first entry to NumEntries-1 for
        the last.

        Setting Cycle.Active causes the gadget to be updated. On the other hand,
        when the user plays around with the gadget, Cycle.Active will always
        reflects the current state.

        Passing the special values Next or Prev during set causes the gadget to
        cycle through its entries in the given direction.

@NODE Dirlist "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Dirlist class provides a quick and easy way of showing entries in a
    directory. It features lots of control attributes, many of them known from
    the popular asl file requester.

    This class is *not* intended to replace asl.library! Nobody wants to see
    every MUI application coming with another selfmade file requester. Please
    continue using ASL for real file requesting purposes!

    However, sometimes it may be useful to have a little directory list placed
    somewhere in your user interface. Imagine an answering machine tool that
    stores incoming calls in a preconfigured directory. Using a dirlist object,
    you can include the GUI for selecting a call in your window with lots of
    other gadgets like "Play", "Delete", etc.

    Dirlist class creates a listview with six columns representing all files
    attributes: Name, size, date, time, flags and comment. If you do not want to
    have all of these attributes displayed, you can use @{"Listviewcolumn class" LINK Listviewcolumn} to
    make adjustments.

    Dirlist class is a subclass of listview class. Thus, you can use most
    attributes and methods of listview class on it too. For example, if you want
    to read the entries of your directory, just send the dirlist object a
    @{"Listview.GetEntry" LINK ListviewGetEntry} method, or if you want to listen to changes in the active
    list entry, set up a notification on @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive}.

    If you use @{"Listview.GetEntry" LINK ListviewGetEntry} on this class, you will get six return values
    representing the six different columns of the dirlist listview. Note that
    you will always get six return values even if you made adjustments to the
    column display using @{"Listviewcolumn class" LINK Listviewcolumn}. The protection flags are
    returned as a single number containing a bitfield combination of the
    #FILEATTR_XXX constants from Hollywood.

    When creating a dirlist object in XML code, you always have to add at least
    one column to it. This is done by using the @{"Listviewcolumn class" LINK Listviewcolumn}. Here is
    an example of a minimal dirlist declaration with just a single column (the
    name column, that is):

        <dirlist>
           <column/>  <!-- Name -->
        </dirlist>

    Here is a declaration that includes all six columns:

        <dirlist>
           <column/>  <!-- Name -->
           <column/>  <!-- Size -->
           <column/>  <!-- Date -->
           <column/>  <!-- Time -->
           <column/>  <!-- Flags -->
           <column/>  <!-- Comment -->
        </dirlist>

    If you only want to have the name column and the comment column displayed,
    you can use the @{"Listviewcolumn.Col" LINK ListviewcolumnCol} attribute to achieve this:

        <dirlist>
           <column/>          <!-- Name -->
           <column col="5"/>  <!-- Comment -->
        </dirlist>

    To reverse the order of columns use:

        <dirlist>
           <column col="5"/>  <!-- Comment -->
           <column col="4"/>  <!-- Flags -->
           <column col="3"/>  <!-- Time -->
           <column col="2"/>  <!-- Date -->
           <column col="1"/>  <!-- Size -->
           <column col="0"/>  <!-- Name -->
        </dirlist>

    may contain any number of child objects, maybe buttons, cycle gadgets or
    even other groups.

    Some attributes of group class define how the children of a group are
    layouted. You can e.g. tell your group to place its children horizontally
    (in a row) or vertically (in a column). Since every MUI object knows about
    its minimum and maximum dimensions, group class has everything it needs to
    do that job.

    More sophisticated layout is possible by assigning different weights to
    objects in a group or by making a group two-dimensional.

    Beneath the layout issues, a group object passes attributes and methods
    through to all of its children. Thus, you can talk and listen to any child
    of a group by talking and listening to the group itself.

    The following different group types are supported by MUI Royale:

    <hgroup>  Group children will be laid out in a row (vertical).

    <vgroup>  Group children will be laid out in a column (horizontal).

    <colgroup>
              Group children will be laid out in columns.

    <virtgroup>
              A virtual group. Normally used inside a scrollgroup. See @{"Virtgroup" LINK Virtgroup}
              @{"class" LINK Virtgroup} for details.

    <scrollgroup>
              A group with scrollbars. Virtual groups are usually embedded
              inside a scrollgroup. See @{"Scrollgroup class" LINK Scrollgroup} for details.

    Column groups are useful if you need to have identical gadget sizes for all
    your children in a group for a more pleasant visual appearance. For example,
    imagine a form made up of string gadgets and text objects. It is recommended
    to use a <colgroup> here because it leads to a clear and ordered visual
    appearance. Here's an example:

        <colgroup columns="2">
           <text>Name</text>
           <string/>
           <text>Street</text>
           <string/>
           <text>City</text>
           <string/>
           <text>Zip code</text>
           <string/>
           <text>Country</text>
           <string/>
           <text>Telephone</text>
           <string/>
           <text>Email</text>
           <string/>
        </colgroup>

    If we used a <vgroup> with one <hgroup> per row the appearance would be
    pretty bad because the string gadget's width would be different for each
    line which looks pretty non-professional.

@NODE GroupColumns "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Indicate number of columns in a two dimensional group. If you use this
        tag, the total number of children must be dividable by the number of
        columns.

        The children will be positioned in a two dimensional array, e.g.
        allowing easy creation of button fields (maybe for calculator).

        The children of your group are always read line by line.

        When MUI layouts two-dimensional groups, it does actually two layout
        calculations, one for the rows and one the columns. Parameters like
        weights and dimensions are handled this way:

        - the minimum width of a column/row is the maximum minimum width of all
          objects in this column/row.

        - the maximum width of a column/row is the minimum maximum width of all
          objects in this column/row.

        - the weight of a column/row is the sum of all objects in this
          column/row.

        This method terminates the state established by @{"Group.InitChange" LINK GroupInitChange}. If

        setting the "force" argument to TRUE. In that case MUI will always
        refresh the whole group no matter if objects have been added or removed.
        Forcing a refresh is useful if there's an object inside your group that
        you want to force a refresh on.

        Prepares a group for dynamic adding/removing of objects. Since version 3
        MUI offers the possibility to dynamically add/remove children from
        groups, even when the window that contains these objects is currently
        open. To be able to do this, you must first put the group into a special
        "exchange" state by using this method. Then, you can add/remove children
        at will. If you're done, use @{"Group.ExitChange" LINK GroupExitChange} to make MUI recalculate

        This method can be used to insert the detached object specified by "obj"
        to the group object specified by "id". The detached object will be added
        after the child specified by "pred". After this method returns the
        specified object will change its state from detached to attached. That
        is why you must no longer use functions that expect a detached object
        with this object now.

        Before you can call this method, you have to put the group into a

@NODE GroupPageMode "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        Group.PageMode -- put group in page mode

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Settings this attribute to TRUE makes the current group a page group.
        Page groups always display only one of their children. Which one can be
        adjusted with the @{"Group.ActivePage" LINK GroupActivePage} attribute.

        Imagine you have a preferences window with several different pages, e.g.
        the MUI preferences with object, frame, image, font, screen, keyboard
        and system prefs. Instead of one separate window for each group, you
        could put all pages into a page group and have a cycle gadget for page
        switching. This will make your program easier to use since the user
        won't have to handle a lot of windows. However, he will not be able to
        work with more than one page at the same time.

        Sizes are calculated as follows:

        The minimum width/height of a page group is the maximum minimum
        width/height of all its children.

        The maximum width/height of a page group is the minimum maximum
        width/height of all its children.

        When the maximum width/height of a child in a page group is smaller than
        the minimum width/height of the page group (since it contains another
        child with big minimum width/height), the child be centered.

        Page groups are not limited in depth, children of a page group may of
        course be other page groups.

        If you want to have a gadget only visible under certain conditions, you
        could make a page group containing this gadget and an empty rectangle
        object.

        If you want TAB cycling for the objects in a page group, simply include
        all objects in the cycle chain (as if they all were visible at the same
        time).

        A special type of page group is created by Register class which
        generates a series of register tabs for all of its children. See
        @{"Register class" LINK Register} for details.

        Before you can call this method, you have to put the group into a

    Hollywood class is a powerful MUI class that allows you to embed a complete
    Hollywood display inside your MUI GUI. Whenever you draw something to a
    Hollywood display that is attached to Hollywood class, it will automatically
    be drawn to your MUI GUI as well. You can even hide the Hollywood display
    and it will still work. Furthermore, all mouse clicks and key strokes that
    happen inside Hollywood class will be forwarded to the corresponding
    Hollywood display as normal Hollywood events. Thus, Hollywood class allows
    you to use almost all of Hollywood's powerful features inside a MUI GUI as
    well.

    Here is an example of how to embed Hollywood display 1 inside your GUI:

@NODE Label "MUI Royale Guide"

    Label class is a superclass of text class and allows you to easily create

    Here is an example of how to use the <label> command:

        <label>Hello World</label>

    The string you specify here can use text formatting codes. See @{"Text" LINK TextFormat}
    @{"formatting codes" LINK TextFormat} for details.

    Please note that labels are not resizable horizontally. That is why they can
    easily block resizing of your whole GUI. To circumvent this problem, you can
    simply put the label in a <hgroup> together with an empty <rectangle>
    object. See @{"Rectangle class" LINK Rectangle} for details.

@NODE Listtree "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Listtree class handles tree nodes which can be defined as node or as leaf.
    Only nodes can contain a list where other tree nodes can be inserted.

    You can create a very complex tree. Two different lists of tree nodes exist:
    First the one which contains all the tree nodes you have inserted. All
    modifications are made to this list. The second list is the display list. As
    you can open or close a node, not all of the existing tree nodes are
    displayed.

    The tree nodes can be inserted and removed, sorted, moved, exchanged or
    renamed. To sort you can also drag and drop them. Modifications can be made
    in relation to the whole tree, to one level, to a sub-tree or to only one
    tree node, the visibility is checked or not.

    The user can control the listtree by the MUI keys, this means a node is
    opened with "Right" and closed with "Left". Check your MUI preferences for
    the specified keys.

    Only one entry can be selected yet, so you cannot use the listtree for multi
    selecting.

    If you do not set @{"Listtree.DragDropSort" LINK ListtreeDragDropSort} to FALSE, the list tree will become
    active for Drag&Drop. This means you can drag one entry and drop it on the
    same listtree again. While dragging an indicator shows where to drop. You
    cannot drop an entry on itself, nor you can drop an opened node on any of
    its members.

    When creating a listtree in XML code, you can use @{"Listtreenode class" LINK Listtreenode} to fill
    it with nodes and items. Here is an example declaration:

        <listtree>
           <node name="CPU">
              <item>Model: Motorola MPC 7447/7457 Apollo V1.1</item>
              <item>CPU speed: 999 Mhz</item>
              <item>FSB speed: 133 Mhz</item>
              <item>Extensions: performancemonitor altivec</item>
           </node>
           <node name="Machine">
              <item>Machine name: Pegasos II</item>
              <item>Memory: 524288 KB</item>
              <item>Extensions: bus.pci bus.agp</item>
           </node>
           <node name="Expansion buses">
              <node name="PCI/AGP">
                 <item>Vendor 0x11AB Device 0x6460</item>
              </node>
           </node>
           <node name="Libraries">
              <item>0x6c7d4a58: exec.library V53.34</item>
           </node>
           <node name="Devices">
              <item>0x6ff8fba4: ramdrive.device V52.6</item>
           </node>
           <node name="Tasks">
              <node name="input.device">
                 <item>Stack: 0x6ff4b000 - 0x6ff5b000</item>

              </node>
           </node>
        </listtree>

    In this example we have made use of the @{"Listtreenode.Name" LINK ListtreenodeName} attribute to add a
    name to each of our nodes. There are some more attributes that you can use
    to customize the appearance of your nodes. See @{"Listtreenode class" LINK Listtreenode} for
    details.

    The strings you specify using the <item> tag and using the @{"Listtreenode.Name" LINK ListtreenodeName}
    attribute can use text formatting codes. See @{"Text formatting codes" LINK TextFormat} for
    details.

@NODE ListtreeGetEntry "MUI Royale Guide"

        Listtree.GetEntry -- get tree entry

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        found, table = mui.DoMethod(id, "GetEntry", node, position, flags$)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Get another node in relation to the specified list or node. This method
        allows you to traverse the entire list tree. See below for an example.

        "Node" specifies the node which is used to find another one. This can
        also be a list node, if the position a related to a list. In contrast to
        all other methods or attributes of Listtree class, "node" must NOT be a
        string identifier but a special value returned by this method or by
        @{"Listtree.FindName" LINK ListtreeFindName} in the MuiID field of the return table (see below).
        Alternatively, it can be one of the following special values:

        Root      The root list is used.

        Active    The list with the active entry is used.

        Position specifies the number of nodes of the list specified in "node"
        or one of the following special values:

        Head      The head of the list in "node" is returned.

        Tail      The tail of the list is returned.

        Active    The active node is returned.

        Next      The next node after the tree node "node" is returned.

        Previous  The node before the tree node "node".

        Parent    The list node of the "node", it's the parent one.

        Flags$ can be a combination of the following options:

        SameLevel Only nodes on the same level are affected.

        Visible   The position is counted on visible entries only.

        If you specify multiple of the flags above, you have to separate them
        using a semicolon, e.g. "SameLevel; Visible".

        This method returns two values: The first return value is a boolean flag
        which indicates whether or not a node was found. If the first return
        value is TRUE, the second return value is a table with the following
        fields initialized:

        Name      Name of the tree node.

        Node      TRUE if the found entry is a node, FALSE if it is a leaf.

        ID        String object identifier of this tree node.

        MuiID     Internal MUI ID of this tree node. This is the only id you are
                  allowed to pass in the 'node' argument of this method. Passing
                  standard string object identifiers is not allowed by this
                  method. You can use this value for subsequent calls to
                  Listtree.GetEntry in the "node" argument See above for more

        of the following special values:

        Head      It will be inserted at the head of the list.

        Tail      It will be inserted at the tail of the list.

        Active    It will be inserted after the active node.

        Sorted    The node is inserted using the sort hook.

        Flags$ can be a combination of the following options:

        List      The node contains a list where other nodes can be inserted.

        Open      The list node is open, sub nodes are displayed.

        Frozen    The node doesn't react on doubleclick or open/close by user.

@NODE Listview "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    This class creates a listview. MUI's listview class is very powerful. It
    handles various types of entries and multi column lists are also supported,
    the format for a column is adjustable.

    Listviews support any kind of sorting, multi selection and an active entry
    that can be controlled with the mouse or the cursor keys.

    When creating a listview in XML code, you always have to add at least one
    column to it. This is done by using the @{"Listviewcolumn class" LINK Listviewcolumn}. Here is an
    example of a minimal listview declaration with just a single column:

        <listview>
           <column/>
        </listview>

    It is also possible to add some entries to the listview right at declaration
    time. This can be done by using the <item> tag:

        <listview>
           <column>
              <item>Entry 1</item>
              <item>Entry 2</item>
              <item>Entry 3</item>
           </column>
        </listview>

    The strings you specify using the <item> tag can use text formatting codes.
    See @{"Text formatting codes" LINK TextFormat} for details.

    If you want to have a multi-column list, you need to use the <column> tag
    several times. Here is an example:

        <listview>
           <column title="Column 1">
              <item>Entry 1</item>
              <item>Entry 2</item>
              <item>Entry 3</item>
           </column>
           <column title="Column 2">
              <item>Entry 1</item>
              <item>Entry 2</item>
              <item>Entry 3</item>
           </column>
           <column title="Column 3">
              <item>Entry 1</item>
              <item>Entry 2</item>
              <item>Entry 3</item>
           </column>
        </listview>

    In this example we have also made use of the @{"Listviewcolumn.Title" LINK ListviewcolumnTitle} attribute
    to add a title bar to each of our columns. There are some more attributes
    that you can use to customize the appearance of your columns. See
    @{"Listviewcolumn class" LINK Listviewcolumn} for details.

        This behaviour will result in not returning the active entry when you
        have some other selected entries somewhere in your list. Since the

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Insert one new entry into a list. If the listview has multiple columns,
        you need to pass as many arguments as there are columns in the listview.

        The insert position is specified in the "pos" argument. The new entry
        will be added in front of the entry specified by "pos". This can be an
        absolute index position starting at 0 for the first entry or one of the
        following special values:

        Top       Insert as first entry.

        Active    Insert in front of the active entry.

        Sorted    Insert sorted.

        Bottom    Insert as last entry.

        If "pos" is bigger or equal to the number of entries in the list, it's

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Renames the listview entry at the specified position. If the listview
        has multiple columns, you need to pass as many arguments as there are
        columns in the listview. It is not possible to rename only a single
        column entry - this method always affects the complete row so you need
        to pass as many strings as there are columns in your listview.

        The entry position is specified in the "pos" argument. This can be an
        absolute index position starting at 0 for the first entry or one of the
        following special values:

        Active    Rename the active entry.

@NODE ListviewScrollerPos "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Specifies the position of a listviews scrollbar. Don't use this tag
        unless it's absolutely required!

        If you specify None here, your listview won't get a scroller at all and
        look much like a list object alone. However, listviews without scroller
        are still more powerful than list objects as they feature e.g. drag&drop
        possibilities.

        Creating listviews without a scrollbar makes sense if you want to have
        the scrollbar somewhere else, e.g. outside of a horizontal virtual group
        where the listview resides. This technique allows the creation of
        horizontally scrollable listviews.

        The following options are possible:

        Default   Position scrollbar according to user preferences.

        Left      Position scrollbar to the left of the listview.

        Right     Position scrollbar to the right of the listview.

        Sort the list. MUI uses an iterative quicksort algorithm, no stack
        problems will occur. You have to pass the index of the column by which
        the list should be sorted in the third argument. Columns are counted

@NODE ListviewSortFunc "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        Listview.SortFunc -- determine how entries should be sorted (V1.2)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This attribute can be used to set up a callback function that will be
        called whenever MUI Royale needs to sort the list entries. The callback
        function will receive two entries as arguments and it has to determine
        which entry should be put first.

        The callback function you specify here will be called like a standard
        MUI Royale event callback, but with the following extra arguments:

        Entry1:   This is a table containing all elements of a single listview
                  row. As listviews can have more than one column, this table
                  contains as many string elements as there are columns in your
                  listview.

        Entry2:   This is a table containing all elements of a single listview
                  row. As listviews can have more than one column, this table
                  contains as many string elements as there are columns in your
                  listview.

        SortColumn:
                  This contains the column index by which the list should be
                  sorted. Columns are counted from 0 to the number of columns
                  minus 1. See @{"Listview.Sort" LINK ListviewSort} for details.

        Your callback function then has to return a value that indicates how the
        two entries should be aligned in the listview. If entry 1 should be
        placed before 2, your callback has to return -1. If entry 1 should be
        placed after entry 2, your callback has to return 1. If the two entries
        are the same, return 0.

        Note that you always have to pass a string specifying the name of a
        Hollywood function to this attribute. Never pass the function directly
        but always pass the name of the function as a string!

        Also note that you must also set up a notification on this attribute.
        Otherwise the callback function will never get called.

    Menuitem class describes a single menu item. You can use all of the gadtools

    Since Menuitem class is a subclass of Family class, you can add other menu
    items as children of a menu item to indicate sub menus. MUI does not limit
    the level of sub menus, but the operating system currently allows a maximum
    nesting level of one. Because of this, children of menu items should not
    contain other menu items for now, the results are unpredictable.

    Menuitems must always be embedded inside a <menu> tag which in turn have to
    be embedded inside a <menustrip> tag. See @{"Menustrip class" LINK Menustrip} for details.

    Please note that the XML tag for menuitem class is just <item> and not

@NODE Menustrip "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Menustrip class is the base class for MUI's object oriented menus. Its
    children are objects of @{"Menu class" LINK Menu}, each of them describes exactly one
    menu.

    A Menustrip object doesn't feature many options itself, but as a subclass of
    Family class, it simply acts as father for multiple Menu objects.

    The Menustrip object is usually specified as a child of either Application
    class or window class with the attributes @{"Application.Menustrip" LINK ApplicationMenustrip} or
    @{"Window.Menustrip" LINK WindowMenustrip}. Additionally, it can also be used as a context menu for
    other MUI objects using the @{"Area.ContextMenu" LINK AreaContextMenu} attribute.

    In an XML file a menu tree is defined using the <menustrip>, <menu> and
    <item> tags. Here is an example definition of a simple menustrip:

        <menustrip id="mymenustrip">
            <menu title="Project">
                <item>New...</item>
                <item>Open...</item>
                <item/>
                <item>Save</item>
                <item>Save as...</item>
                <item/>
                <item>Quit</item>
            </menu>
            <menu title="Edit">
                <item shortcut="X">Cut</item>
                <item shortcut="C">Copy</item>
                <item shortcut="V">Paste</item>
            </menu>
            <menu title="?">
                <item>Settings...</item>
                <item>MUI settings...</item>
                <item/>
                <item>About...</item>
                <item>About MUI...</item>
            </menu>
        </menustrip>

    Note the empty <item/> declarations: These will insert a separator bar to
    the menu tree. Using separator bars makes your menu more readable to the
    end-user. After you have written the XML declaration above you can add the
    menustrip to one of your windows by using the @{"Window.Menustrip" LINK WindowMenustrip} attribute as
    follows:

        <window menustrip="mymenustrip">
        ...
        </window>

    It is also possible to add a menustrip as a context menu to one of your
    window's gadgets using the @{"Area.ContextMenu" LINK AreaContextMenu} attribute. The context menu will
    then appear whenever the user presses the right mouse button over the gadget
    that has a context menu. Here is an example of how to add a menustrip as a
    context menu to a listview:

        <listview contextmenu="mymenustrip">
        ...
        </listview>

    Please note that menustrips which are used as context menus must not contain
    more than one <menu> tree.

    It is very important to note that you have to declare your menustrips in the
    <application> scope because menustrips are global objects and are only
    attached to windows or gadgets later on. That is why it is not allowed to
    declare menustrips inside a <window> XML scope.

@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Notify class is superclass of all other MUI classes. Its main purpose is to
    handle MUI's notification mechanism, but it also contains some other methods
    and attributes useful for every object.

    Because Notify class is the super class for all other MUI classes, you can
    use all of its attributes with all other MUI classes. For example, you can
    use @{"Notify.HelpNode" LINK NotifyHelpNode} to add online help reference to MUI gadgets or you could
    use @{"Notify.AppMessage" LINK NotifyAppMessage} to add MUI objects to the app message handler.

    @{"Notify.AppMessage                 " LINK NotifyAppMessage} Get app message
    @{"Notify.Class                      " LINK NotifyClass} Get class name of object

@NODE NotifyAppMessage "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        Notify.AppMessage -- get app message

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        When your window is an AppWindow, i.e. you have set the @{"Window.AppWindow" LINK WindowAppWindow}
        attribute to TRUE, you will be able to get AppMessages by listening to
        Notify.AppMessage. Whenever an AppMessage arrives, this attribute will
        trigger a notification.

        For AppMessage notifications, the standard MUI Royale event handler
        callback will get two additional entries in the table that is passed as
        the parameter to your event handling function:

        NumDropFiles:
                  The number of files the user dropped over your object. This is
                  usually 1.
        DropFiles:
                  A table containing the list of files that were dropped over
                  the object. This table will have exactly 'NumDropFiles'
                  entries.

        See @{"Notifications" LINK Notifications} for details.

        Notify.AppMessage is object specific. You can e.g. set up different
        notifications for different objects in your window, they will only get
        executed when icons are dropped over the specific object.

        If you wait on Notify.AppMessage with a window object, your notify will
        always get executed when icons are dropped on the window.

        Note that AppWindows are only possible on the Workbench screen.

        notification that is specified in the string is triggered, the event
        handler callback will receive the user data specified in
        Notify.NotifyData in the NotifyData field of the event message.

        The string that you need to pass to this attribute must be formatted as
        follows: Name of the notification attribute, followed by a colon,
        followed by a user data string, followed by a semi-colon. The sequence
        may then be repeated as many times as it is requred.

        For example: "Active: foo; DoubleClick: bar;". When the "Active"
        notification is triggered, "foo" will be send to the event handler
        callback. When the "DoubleClick" attribute triggers, "bar" will be sent.

    Poplist class simplifies creation of popups that contain just a simple list

    containing a list of predefined entries will be opened so that the user can
    choose one from the list.

    When creating a poplist object, you have to use the <item> tag to fill it
    with entries. Here is an example:

        <poplist>
           <item>The</item>
           <item>quick</item>

           <item>lazy</item>
           <item>dog</item>

@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Poppen class adds input capabilities to its super class Pendisplay. It
    should be used if your application allows users to configure some custom
    pens for rendering.

    A Poppen object will appear as kind of a button which displays the currently
    selected color. When the user hits the button, a Popup window containing a
    Penadjust object opens up and lets the user choose change the color.

    You can control the window title of the popup window using the @{"Poppen.Title" LINK PoppenTitle}
    attribute on the Poppen object. It will remember its value and use it when
    creating the popup window.

    As most MUI popups, the Penadjust popup window runs asynchronously and stays
    there until the user terminates it with "OK" or "Cancel". Furthermore, if
    the popup window is automatically cancelled if the pop button's root window
    gets closed.

    You can get/set the current color from a Poppen object by using the
    @{"Poppen.RGB" LINK PoppenRGB} attribute.

    You can find some example code on using this class in the Class2 demo of the
    MUI distribution.

        If you set this attribute some very special magic will take place with
        this proportional gadget. In fact, it will not eat any display space at
        all or render anything, it stays invisible in your windows GUI. Instead,
        the gadgets control and display will be linked to one of the scrollbars
        in the window border.

        There is no difference in talking to the object, you can use all prop
        gadget attributes regardless whether its a real prop gadget or just a
        window border link. Of course, gadgets in window borders will use the
        intuition look regardless what the user has configured.

        You *must* enable border scrollers for the parent window with the
        corresponding attributes before using Prop.UseWinBorder.

        Obviously, you can only link exactly one prop gadget to one window
        scroller. Linking more than one gadget to the same window scroller will
        result in big confusion.

        The following values are recognized by this attribute:

        Left      Use left window border.

@NODE Radio "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Radio class generates radio button gadgets. They do the same job as cycle
    gadgets and eat up more window space, maybe that's the reason why so few of
    them can be found in existing applications.

    When you declare a radio gadget, you have to use the <item> tag to fill the
    radio gadget with items. Every radio gadget needs to have at least one item.

    Here is an example XML excerpt for creating a radio gadget:

        <radio id="printer">
            <item>HP Deskjet</item>
            <item>NEC P6</item>
            <item>Okimate 20</item>
        </radio>

    The radio entries that you specify using the <item> tag can use text
    formatting codes. See @{"Text formatting codes" LINK TextFormat} for details.

@NODE Rectangle "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Rectangle class seems kind of useless since it does not define many
    attributes or methods itself. However, objects of this type are frequently
    used in every application. They allow insertion of space to control MUI's
    layout process.

    You can use the attributes of the super class to control the size and other
    attributes of the rectangle. E.g. you can use @{"Area.FixWidth" LINK AreaFixWidth} and
    @{"Area.FixHeight" LINK AreaFixHeight} to create rectangles of a fixed size.

    Rectangle objects are also often necessary as padding space next to objects
    which are not resizable themselves. The <label> object is e.g. not
    resizable. To prevent these static label objects from blocking the resizing
    feature of your whole GUI, you can simply pad them with a <rectangle>
    object. Here is an example of a label next to a checkmark object, padded
    using an invisible rectangle:

        <hgroup>
           <label>Enable hardware acceleration</label>
           <checkmark/>
           <rectangle/>

@NODE Register "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Register class is a special class for handling multi page groups. Using this
    class, you only have to supply an array of groups, describing the register's
    children. How these children are visualized, either with a cycle gadget of
    with a register-like group, is the choice of the user. You need to use the
    @{"Group.Title" LINK GroupTitle} attribute to give your register tabs titles.

    Here is an example of a three page register group:

        <register>
           <vgroup title="Page 1">
               <listview>

        expect a detached object with this object now.

        Detached MUI objects can be created either by calling the
        @{"mui.CreateObject()" LINK muiCreateObject} function or by explicitly detaching them from their

@NODE Scrollgroup "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Scrollgroup objects can be used to supply virtual groups with scrollbars.
    These scrollbars automatically adjust according to the virtual and display
    sizes of the underlying virtual group. When scrolling is unnecessary (i.e.
    the virtual group is completely visible), the scrollers might get disabled
    or even disappear completely, depending on the users preferences settings.

    It is important to note that scrollgroup objects do not work with normal
    groups. Instead, you need to give them a virtual group as a child, i.e. you
    need to use the <virtgroup> tag to create a MUI object of type @{"Virtgroup" LINK Virtgroup}
    @{"class" LINK Virtgroup}. See @{"Virtgroup class" LINK Virtgroup} for details.

    Here is an XML example:

        <scrollgroup>
           <virtgroup>
              <radio>
                 <item>Amiga 500</item>
                 <item>Amiga 1200</item>
                 <item>Amiga 4000</item>

              </listview>
           </virtgroup>
        </scrollgroup>

    The XML code above embeds a radio and a listview object inside a virtual

@{b}Overview@{ub}

    The slider class generates a GUI element that allows a user to adjust a
    numeric value. The programmer doesn't have very much influence on the
    slider's outfit, there are only very few tags available. Future versions of
    MUI will probably include some preferences options to allow the user (*not*
    the programmer) to configure this outfit.

    Note that since slider is a subclass of group class, you can get horizontal
    or vertical sliders by simply using the @{"Slider.Horiz" LINK SliderHoriz} attribute. Default is a
    horizontal slider.

    Here is an XML example of a slider that allows the user to configure a
    number ranging from 0 to 100:

        <slider min="0" max="100"/>

    @{"Slider.Format                     " LINK SliderFormat} Customize slider text
    @{"Slider.Horiz                      " LINK SliderHoriz} Set/get alignment of slider

@NODE SliderFormat "MUI Royale Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        Slider.Format -- customize slider text

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        A template string to describe the format of the slider display. Whenever
        Slider.mui thinks it's time to render a new value, it doesn't simply
        write it to a string but uses the format mask specified in this
        attribute to compose the new string that is then rendered to the slider
        display. Any "%ld" in the format string is replaced by the current
        slider level.

        Note well: The maximum length of the result string for Slider.Format is
        limited to 32 characters. If you need more, you must use
        @{"Slider.Stringify" LINK SliderStringify}.

        Slider.Format defaults to "%ld".

        The string you specify here can use text formatting codes. See @{"Text" LINK TextFormat}

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This attribute can be used to set up a callback function that transforms
        a slider level into a custom slider text. The callback function you
        specify here will be called like a standard MUI Royale event callback,
        but with the following extra argument:

        Value:    Contains the current slider level.

        Your callback function then has to return a string that should be
        displayed in the slider gadget. You might e.g. want to display a nice
        formatted time string (hh:mm:ss) in a slider which adjusts a number of
        seconds. Or you need to adjust a baudrate from a hand of predefined
        values. Just use Slider.Stringify and you have the choice how the slider
        value translates into a string.

        Note that you always have to pass a string specifying the name of a
        Hollywood function to this attribute. Never pass the function directly
        but always pass the name of the function as a string!

        Also note that you must also set up a notification on this attribute.
        Otherwise the callback function will never get called.

        See @{"Notifications" LINK Notifications} for details.

          If msg.value = 64 Then Return("Full")
          Return(msg.value)
        EndFunction

        The code above creates a slider for controlling sound volume. If the
        slider is all the way to the left, "Mute" will be displayed. If it is
        all the way to the right, "Full" will be displayed. Note that we use the
        "Format" tag in the XML file to specify an initial width for the slider
        knob so that it is large enough for all strings that are going to be
        returned by our callback.

    String class generates standard string gadgets with all editing facilities
    (clear, undo, etc.) enabled. By default, string gadgets do not have any

    Text class allows generating objects that contain some kind of text. You can
    control the outfit of your text with some special control characters,
    including italics, bold, underline and color codes. Format codes align text
    either left, centered or right, linefeeds allow multiline text fields.

    Please note that text class does not offer automatic word wrapping. If you
    want to have on-the-fly word wrapping, you have to use floattext class
    instead. See @{"Floattext" LINK Floattext} for details.

    Here is an example of how to use the <text> command:

        <text>Hello World</text>

    Here is the same example in bold:

        <text>\\33bHello World</text>

    TextEditor.mcc is a multiline string gadget which holds most of the
    functions of a normal text editor including some special functionality for
    importing/exporting text from/to special formats.

    The gadget was originally written in 1997 by Allan Odgaard. As of version
    15.10, released in April 2005, the gadget is maintained by the
    TextEditor.mcc Open Source team.

    It is released and distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
    Public License (LGPL) and available free of charge.

    Please visit http://www.sf.net/projects/texteditor-mcc/ for the very latest
    version and information regarding TextEditor.mcc.

        the user performs a mouse action (click/select) in the texteditor. As a
        consequence, the texteditor will then get the full keyboard focus and
        will eventually signal its active status by highlighting a marked area
        with the active color rather than using the inactive marked color in
        inactive state.

        Please note that depending on the @{"Texteditor.ReadOnly" LINK TexteditorReadOnly} setting, this
        attribute has different default values. In case the texteditor is set to
        @{"Texteditor.ReadOnly" LINK TexteditorReadOnly} while initialized this attribute will be set to
        FALSE as a default. In contrast, when the object is in full write mode
        it will be set to TRUE instead. However, during operation this behaviour
        can be overridden by setting this attribute to another value.

        Depending on the inputs a different export hook will be fired as soon as

        the currently shown data as is. That means, that all text, including the
        escape sequences for showing soft styles will be exported.

        You can change this behaviour by setting this attribute. The following
        export hooks are recognized:

        Plain     Export all text as displayed, including escape sequences
                  ('\\33'). This is the default mode.

        EMail     Export all text, but convert the soft-style escape sequences
                  into the pseudo-standard text sequences like:

                      *bold*      : for bold text
                      /italic/    : for italic text

                      <sb>        : for a thin separator bar

        NoStyle   Export all text like the "Plain" variant, but strip off all
                  style relevant escape sequences. Also converts the escape
                  sequences for the thick and thin separator bar into <tsb> and
                  <sb> like the "EMail" hook.

                  means normal. The color is reset for each new line.

        \\33P[RRGGBB]
                  Change front color to the specified RGB color. The RGB color
                  has to be specified in the form of six hexadecimal digits
                  RRGGBB. This is only possible on true colour screens. The
                  color is reset for each new line.

        \\33P[AARRGGBB]
                  Change front color to the specified RGB color and apply alpha
                  blending at the specified intensity. The RGB color has to be
                  specified in the form of six hexadecimal digits RRGGBB which
                  have to be prefaced with two alpha channel digits AA
                  specifying the blending intensity. This is only possible on
                  true colour screens. The color is reset for each new line.

        The following sequences are only valid at the beginning of a line. If
        they are placed elsewhere, the result is undefined (they might be

        \\33l      Left justify current and following lines.

        \\33r      Right justify current and following lines.

        \\33c      Center current and following lines.

        \\33[s:x]  Create a separator. "x" is a bit combination of flags:

                  Bit 0 set Top placement of separator.

                  Bit 1 set Middle placement of separator.

                  Bit 2 set Bottom placement of separator.

                  Bit 3 set Draw separator on top of text (strike through).

                  Bit 4 set Make separator extra thick.

        The following values may be passed to this attribute:

        Plain     Use default import mode (see above).

        MIME      This built-in hook will convert quoted-printables (e.g. "=E5")
                  to the ASCII representation, merge lines ending with a "=",
                  wordwrap the text (using the value set with
                  @{"TextEditor.ImportWrap" LINK TextEditorImportWrap}), highlight all lines that start with
                  ">", make real *bold*, /italic/, _underline_ and #colored#
                  text, and replace <sb> or <tsb> with a real separator bar. It
                  will stop parsing upon reaching a NULL byte.

                  The color used for #colored# text is colormap entry 6, which
                  defaults to "MPEN_FILL". To override it, just supply a
                  colormap with entry 6 set to whatever color you would like.

        MIMEQuoted
                  Like the MIME import hook, but each line gets quoted and
                  highlighted.

        EMail     Like the MIME import hook, but it doesn't convert quoted
                  printables.

        Note, that the last three hooks also evaluate the escape sequences
        described for the "Plain" import hook type. While it never was
        documented there are some programs insisting on this side effect of an
        old implementation. Hence starting with version 51.13 this behaviour had
        to be official supported.

        This attribute allows to define the number of characters in texteditor

        However, the way wrapping is done depends on the actual wrap mode that

        Per default the WrapBorder is set to 0 which in fact disables the

        completely ignored or wrapping will be done at the window limits, which

        With this attribute, the way text wrapping is performed can be directly

        ways of how wrapping can be performed. 'soft wrapping' and 'hard
        wrapping'. Whereas soft wrapping refers to the process where lines will
        just be graphically wrapped to the next line, but are still be
        considered a single line. Hard wrapping in turn immediately inserts a
        newline character as soon as the cursor passed the specified amount of
        characters in one line and therefore separate them in a 'hard' direct
        way.

        The following modes are supported:

        NoWrap    Wrapping is completely disabled, setting WrapBorder > 0 will
                  have no effect. That means, the window will have to be resizes
                  by the user to e.g. see or edit all text.

        SoftWrap  Enables soft wrapping of lines if WrapBorder > 0. That means,
                  lines are being wrapped at the specified border in a way that
                  they are still logically one line. This allows to e.g.
                  dynamically reconcatenate lines. This should be considered the
                  new preferred setting for new/revised applications. If
                  WrapBorder == 0, soft wrapping will be performed at the
                  current window limits.

        HardWrap  Enables hard wrapping of lines if WrapBorder > 0. That means,
                  lines are being wrapped at the specified border by directly
                  inserting newline characters as soon as the cursor passes the
                  specified border. While this mode is the default, due to
                  historical reasons, it doesn't allow to directly reconcatenate
                  lines if the user e.g. removes characters. If WrapBorder == 0,
                  soft wrapping will be performed at the current window limits.
                  This is the default

        Due to historical reasons the default is to hard wrap a line if the
        WrapBorder attribute is set > 0 and WrapMode is kept untouched. However,
        for new applications, soft wrapping should be considered the preferred
        setting as this mode is more intuitive and allows users of texteditor to
        directly concatenate lines if they e.g. remove characters while they are
        writing.

@NODE Toolbar "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Toolbar class allows you to create toolbar gadgets for your windows.
    Toolbars can be displayed either as images, images and text, or text only.
    This class requires the MUI custom class TheBar.mcc.

    TheBar.mcc is Copyright (C) 2003-2005 Alfonso Ranieri and Copyright (C)
    2005-2009 TheBar Open Source Team

    It is released and distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
    Public License (LGPL) and available free of charge.

    Please visit http://www.sf.net/projects/thebar/ for the very latest version
    and information regarding TheBar.mcc

    When declaring a toolbar gadget in XML code, you always need to add at least
    one toolbar button to it. This is done using @{"Toolbarbutton class" LINK Toolbarbutton}. Here is
    an example XML declaration of a toolbar with three buttons:

        <toolbar horiz="true">
           <button image="1">Cut</button>
           <button image="2">Copy</button>
           <button image="3">Paste</button>
        </toolbar>

    In the XML declaration above, toolbar button 1 will use Hollywood brush 1 as
    its image, button 2 will use brush 2, and so on. Toolbar buttons can use
    many more options like special images for selected and disabled states, help
    bubbles, and more. See @{"Toolbarbutton class" LINK Toolbarbutton} for details.

    Toolbar button class creates a single button for its super toolbar class.
    Please note that the XML tag for this class is just <button>, not
    <toolbarbutton>. See @{"Toolbar class" LINK Toolbar} for details.

    Virtgroup class generates special kinds of group objects whose children can
    be a lot larger than the actual group. The group acts as a (small) window
    through which a rectangle area of its contents is visible.

    During layout, MUI tries to place the children of a virtual group in the
    visible part. If this is impossible, space is extended as long as all
    children fit.

    Virtual groups themselves don't offer any scrollbars to allow user
    interaction. These things are handled by scrollgroup class. Usually, you
    don't want to use a virtual group without a scrollgroup. See @{"Scrollgroup" LINK Scrollgroup}

@NODE Volumelist "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Volumelist generates a list of all available volumes. Since you shouldn't
    use your own file requester in every application, this class is probably not
    of much use.

    Volumelist class creates a listview with the following five columns: Icon,
    name, fill state in percent, free space and used space. If you do not want
    to have all of these attributes displayed, you can use @{"Listviewcolumn class" LINK Listviewcolumn}
    to make adjustments.

    Volumelist class is a subclass of listview class. Thus, you can use most
    attributes and methods of listview class on it too. For example, if you want
    to read the entries of your volumelist, just send the volumelist object a
    @{"Listview.GetEntry" LINK ListviewGetEntry} method, or if you want to listen to changes in the active
    list entry, set up a notification on @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive}.

    When creating a volumelist object in XML code, you always have to add at
    least one column to it. This is done by using the @{"Listviewcolumn class" LINK Listviewcolumn}.
    Here is an example of a minimal volumelist declaration with just a single
    column (the icon column, that is):

        <volumelist>
           <column/>  <!-- Icon -->
        </volumelist>

    Here is a declaration that includes all five columns:

        <volumelist>
           <column/>  <!-- Icon -->
           <column/>  <!-- Name -->
           <column/>  <!-- Percent -->
           <column/>  <!-- Free -->
           <column/>  <!-- Used -->
        </volumelist>

    If you only want to have the name column and the percent column displayed,
    you can use the @{"Listviewcolumn.Col" LINK ListviewcolumnCol} attribute to achieve this:

        <volumelist>
           <column col="1"/>  <!-- Name -->
           <column col="2"/>  <!-- Percent -->
        </volumelist>

    See @{"Listview class" LINK Listview} for details.

@NODE Window "MUI Royale Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Objects of window class are used to generate windows and supply a place
    where MUI gadgets feel well. It handles the complicated task of window
    resizing fully automatic, you don't need to worry about that.

    Windows are children of an application, you cannot use a window object
    without having a parent application object. On the other side, the gadgets
    in a window are children of the window, you cannot use MUI gadgets without
    having a parent MUI window.

    Creating a window object does not mean to open it instantly. This is done
    later by setting the window's @{"Window.Open" LINK WindowOpen} attribute. If your application has
    several windows, the usual way is to create them all at once at startup time
    and open/close it later just by setting @{"Window.Open" LINK WindowOpen}.

    There is no difference in talking to gadgets whether their parent window is
    open or not. If you e.g. set the contents of a string gadget in an open
    window, the gadget will refresh immediately. If the window is closed, the
    gadget just remembers its new setting and displays it later.

        MinMax:<0..100>
                  Somewhere between the minimum height (0) and the maximum
                  height (100) of your window.

        Visible:<1..100>
                  Percentage of the screens visible height.

        Screen:<1..100>
                  Percentage of the screens total height.

        Scaled    Height will be adjusted so that width : height == minimum
                  width : minimum height. Note that a windows width and height
                  may not both be scaled.

        Default for this tag is Default.

        As long as your window has a MUI window id @{"Window.MuiID" LINK WindowMuiID} (), choosing a
        size is not that important. MUI will always remember a windows last

        This little attribute can be used to open and close a window. When
        opening a window, MUI does lots of stuff to calculate sizes and
        positions of all gadgets. Minimum and maximum window sizes will be
        adjusted automatically.

        When the minimum size of a window is too big to fit on the screen, MUI
        tries to reduce font sizes and does a new calculation. You should always
        design your windows to fit on a 640*200 screen with all fonts set to
        topaz/8.

        When a window is closed (and you specified a @{"Window.MuiID" LINK WindowMuiID}, MUI
        remembers its position and size and uses these values during the next
        opening.

        After setting Window.Open to TRUE, you should test if MUI was able to
        open the window by getting the attribute again. If you don't and if this
        was the only window of your application, the user won't be able to do
        any input and your application will seem to hang.

    GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1, February 1999

    Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place,
    Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and
    distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
    allowed.

    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the
    successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version
    number 2.1.]

    Preamble

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users.

    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
    designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
    Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but
    we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the
    ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any
    particular case, based on the explanations below.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not
    price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
    the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
    service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want
    it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free
    programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
    you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for
    a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You
    must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you
    link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to
    the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making
    changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these
    terms so they know their rights.

    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
    and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the library.

    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
    warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone
    else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not
    the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be
    affected by problems that might be introduced by others.

    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any
    free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively
    restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from
    a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a
    version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use
    specified in this license.

    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
    General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
    applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
    ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries
    in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a
    shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined
    work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public
    License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits
    its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax
    criteria for linking other code with the library.

    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does
    Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.
    It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over
    competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the
    ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser
    license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
    widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
    standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
    library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as
    widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
    limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser
    General Public License.

    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
    enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
    example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables
    many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its
    variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
    freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
    Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a
    modified version of the Library.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
    follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
    library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code
    derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the
    library in order to run.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
    which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
    party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
    Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
    "you".

    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so
    as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of
    those functions and data) to form executables.

    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
    been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means
    either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
    say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or
    with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
    language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
    term "modification".)

    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the
    source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
    installation of the library.

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
    by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program
    using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is
    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
    (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether
    that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
    the Library does.

    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
    that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and
    distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
    may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
    thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
    modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
    also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of
    data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
    than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make
    a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not
    supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
    that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
    Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used
    by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,
    the square root function must still compute square roots.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
    reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
    this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
    distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
    as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of
    the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
    licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
    regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
    the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
    based on the Library.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
    the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
    or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
    License.

    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
    instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
    alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
    ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.
    (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
    wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,
    so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies
    and derivative works made from that copy.

    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
    into a program that is not a library.

    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
    it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
    corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distribute
