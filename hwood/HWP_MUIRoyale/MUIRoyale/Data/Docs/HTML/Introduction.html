<p>
MUI Royale is a plugin for Hollywood that allows you to easily create MUI GUIs
with Hollywood. The GUI layout can be conveniently defined using an XML file
that is converted into a MUI GUI by MUI Royale on the fly. It just doesn't get
any easier!

<p>
MUI Royale supports over 40 MUI classes including popular third-party classes
like TextEditor.mcc and TheBar.mcc. Creating and managing menustrips is also
fully supported. The highlight of MUI Royale, however, is certainly its inbuilt
Hollywood MUI class. This class allows dynamic embedding of complete Hollywood
displays into MUI GUIs which can be used to combine the best of Hollywood and
MUI into one powerful application.

<p>
MUI Royale comes with extensive documentation in various formats like PDF, HTML,
AmigaGuide, and CHM that describes MUI programming basics in detail and provides
a convenient function and class reference. A step-by-step tutorial that guides you
to your first MUI program is also included. On top of that, almost 20 example
scripts are included in the distribution archive, many of which are direct ports
from the MUI 3.8 SDK by Stefan Stuntz, but there are also original developments
that show how to create video and song players using the combined power of Hollywood
and MUI.

<p>
All this makes MUI Royale the truly royal MUI experience, carefully crafted
for you kings and queens of MUI!
