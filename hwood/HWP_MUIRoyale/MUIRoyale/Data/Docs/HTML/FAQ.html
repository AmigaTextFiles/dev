<h2 class="heading">2.3 Frequently asked questions</h2>

<p>
This section covers some frequently asked questions. Please read them first
before asking on the mailing list or forum because your problem might have
been covered here.

<p>
<b>Q: My GUI is not resizable. Isn't one of the big advantages of MUI that its GUIs
are always resizable and MUI takes care of this automatically?</b>

<p>
A: Yes, but there are some things that you need to keep in mind for the resize feature
to work correctly. If there is a gadget in your GUI that has a fixed size, you need to
pad it using resizable <code>&lt;rectangle&gt;</code> objects on its sides. Then your GUI will
be resizable again. For example, imagine you have a 64x64 <code>&lt;image&gt;</code> object in a
horizontal group in your window. MUI won't be able to resize this window unless you add
rectangle objects to the sides of your image object because MUI needs to find an object
that can be resized so you need to take care that non-resizable objects in your GUI
are always padded with resizable ones. By the way, be careful with the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>
tag: Objects of label class are actually not resizable! If you want resizable labels,
just use <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> instead.

<b>Q: Why are labels not resizable then?</b>

<p>
A: Honestly, I don't know. There is a <a href="LabelFreeVert.html">Label.FreeVert</a> attribute but the
corresponding <code>Label.FreeHoriz</code> is missing. I do not really know why Stefan
Stuntz did it this way but I am sure there is some rationale behind it.

<b>Q: Why are there no Application.Author, Application.Copyright, Application.Description,
Application.Title, and Application.Version attributes?</b>

<p>
A: These attributes have been deliberately left out to avoid redundancies with Hollywood.
Hollywood already offers the <code>@APPAUTHOR</code>, <code>@APPCOPYRIGHT</code>, <code>@APPDESCRIPTION</code>,
<code>@APPTITLE</code>, and <code>@APPVERSION</code> preprocessor commands. The contents of these
preprocessor commands will be automatically passed to the MUI application object when it is created.
