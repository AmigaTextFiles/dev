<p>
Note: These topics aren't discussed here just for fun. You will
annoy lots of users if you don't pay attention to them!

<p>
<dl>
<dt>File Requester:</dt>
<dd>
Even if MUI features a file list and a volume list object and
makes building a private file requester very easy, you should
always provide a possibility to pop up a standard asl requester
for this purpose. Just add a little popup button right beneath
your file string gadget and everything will be fine. MUI offers a
file-popup object exactly for this purpose.  Note well: Many users
(including myself) move programs with non-standard file requesters
into the trashcan immediately.

<p>
</dd>
<dt>Window Size:</dt>
<dd>
With MUI, it's very easy to have lots of gadgets within a single
window. Since you as a programmer usually have a more powerful
system with higher graphic resolutions as most of your users,
windows tend to become too big. You should always make sure that
everything you design fits on a standard 640x256 screen with a
topaz/8 font. Otherwise, MUI will try to use very small fonts or
virtual groups to make your window fit, making your application
look and feel bad.

<p>
</dd>
<dt>Keyboard Control:</dt>
<dd>
Even if you're a &quot;mouse-only&quot; user, add keyboard cycle chains and
gadget shortcuts to your application. It's very few work for you
and helps lots of users. See <a href="CycleChain.html">Cycle chain</a> for details.

<p>
</dd>
<dt>Background:</dt>
<dd>
MUI allows the user to adjust lots of different backgrounds for
objects.  Even if you don't use this feature, you should always
test your program with a fancy background pattern configuration
and check whether all your buttons really have button backgrounds,
all your framed texts really have text backgrounds, etc.

<p>
</dd>
<dt>Add a shortcut to MUI preferences:</dt>
<dd>
Every MUI program should include a menu item that allows the
user to configure the appearance of the program using the MUI
preferences program. This can be done very easily by adding
a menu item that simply runs the method <a href="ApplicationOpenConfigWindow.html">Application.OpenConfigWindow</a>
on the application object. Also, you should include &quot;About MUI&quot; and
&quot;About MUI Royale&quot; menu items that show the &quot;About MUI&quot; and &quot;About MUI Royale&quot;
windows which you can open using the <a href="ApplicationAboutMUI.html">Application.AboutMUI</a> and
<a href="ApplicationAboutMUIRoyale.html">Application.AboutMUIRoyale</a> methods respectively.
