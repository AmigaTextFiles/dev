<h2 class="heading">3.1 Application tree</h2>

<p>
A MUI application consists of a (sometimes very) big object tree.
The root of this tree is always an instance of application class,
called application object. This application object handles the
various communication channels such as user input through windows,
ARexx commands or commodities messages.

<p>
An application object itself would be enough to create non-GUI
programs with just ARexx and commodities capabilities. If you want to
have windows with lots of nice gadgets and other user interface stuff,
you will have to add window objects to your application. Since the
application object is able to to handle any number of children, the
number of windows is not limited.

<p>
Window objects are instances of window class and handle all the
actions related with opening, closing, moving, resizing and refreshing
of intuition windows. However, a window for itself is not of much use
without having any contents to display. That's why window objects
always need a so called root object.

<p>
With this root object, we finally reach the gadget related classes
of the MUI system. These gadget related classes are all subclasses of
<a href="Area.html">Area class</a>, they describe a rectangle region with some class dependent
contents. Many different classes such as strings, buttons, checkmarks
or listviews are available, but the most important subclass of area
class is probably the <a href="Group.html">Group class</a>. Instances of this class are able to
handle any number of child objects and control the size and position of
these children with various attributes. Of course these children can
again be group objects with other sets of children. Since you usually
want your window to contain more than just one object, the root object
of a window must always be a group class object.

<p>
In MUI Royale GUIs are defined entirely using the XML markup language.
Here is an example what an application tree could look like in an XML
declaration:

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
&lt;application base=&quot;HELLOWORLD&quot;&gt;
   &lt;window title=&quot;Example GUI&quot; muiid=&quot;MAIN&quot;&gt;
      &lt;vgroup&gt;
         &lt;listview&gt;
            &lt;column/&gt;
         &lt;/listview&gt;
         &lt;string/&gt;
         &lt;hgroup&gt;
            &lt;button&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;button&gt;Remove&lt;/button&gt;
         &lt;/hgroup&gt;
      &lt;/vgroup&gt;
   &lt;/window&gt;
&lt;/application&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

Because these first paragraphs are very important for understanding how
MUI works, here's a brief summary:

<p>
An application consists of exactly one application object. This
application object may have any number of children, each of them being
a window object. Every window object contains a root object that must be
of type group class. This group object again handles any number of child
objects, either other group objects or some user interface elements
such as strings, sliders or buttons.
