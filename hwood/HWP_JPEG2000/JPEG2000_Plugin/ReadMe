jpeg2000.hwp
============

This plugin allows Hollywood to load and save images in the JP2 and J2K image
formats. On top of that, when jpeg2000.hwp is installed, Hollywood will also be
able to compile 512x512 sized icons into macOS application bundles since these
icons need to be in the JPEG2000 format.

Usage is simple: Once this plugin has been installed, Hollywood will be able to
load *.jp2 and *.j2k images on the fly.

If you want to save images in the *.jp2 format, use the constant #IMGFMT_JP2 that
this plugin makes available once loaded. For example:

    SaveBrush(1, "test.jp2", 0, #IMGFMT_JP2, {Quality = 100})

If you want to save images in the *.j2k format, use the constant #IMGFMT_J2K that
this plugin makes available once loaded.

For example:

    SaveBrush(1, "test.j2k", 0, #IMGFMT_J2K, {Quality = 100})

Note that JPEG2000 differs from the original JPEG in lots of ways. Two important
differences are:

* JPEG2000 supports lossless compression: To use lossless compression, pass 100
  in the "Quality" tag.

* JPEG2000 supports alpha channel graphics: If you save a brush that has an alpha
  channel using #IMGFMT_JP2 or #IMGFMT_J2K, the JPEG2000 plugin will automatically
  create a JP2 image with an alpha channel for you.

- Change: Amiga installer will now also copy the plugins for all platforms to Hollywood's

  these days
- New [macOS]: Added build for macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon)
