<p>
The Plananarama plugin allows Hollywood to run on planar (palette-based) screens. This finally
makes it possible to run Hollywood scripts on plain AGA or ECS systems with no graphics board
installed - for the first time since Hollywood 1.93 (released in March 2005)! Starting with
version 2.0, Hollywood required CyberGraphX or Picasso96 to run. Since then, many people have
asked for a revival of Hollywood's planar engine, so here it is, a real blast from the past!
Thanks to Hollywood 6's greatly extended plugin API this feature could be implemented
completely in plugin space. Once Plananarama is installed, all Hollywood scripts will 'automagically'
run on palette screens again! All resolutions are supported - from 8-bit LowRes to 1-bit
productivity SuperHighRes Interlace.

<p>
Starting with Plananarama 2.0 it is also possible to get direct access to the screen's palette
pens when it is running in fullscreen mode. This allows you to draw directly using the screen's
palette without the need for any color remapping so drawing will become much faster. Also, it's
possible to create nice palette effects by changing pens, e.g. it's possible to fade or cycle colors
with almost no CPU load because in palette mode, Plananarama can directly modify the hardware's
color register instead of having to redraw everything when colors change (as it needs to be done
for real TrueColour graphics).

<p>
Also, Plananarama 2.0 introduces support for real hardware sprites. When using hardware sprites,
the Amiga's custom chip hardware is used to draw the sprites which allows your script to draw
sprites in next to no time with almost no CPU load.

<p>
All of this makes Plananarama the ultimate plugin for targetting classic Amiga systems that
don't have a graphics board installed.
