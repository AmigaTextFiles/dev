    Please read the history bottom-up. Note that the history might list some
    features that were implemented in beta versions and removed later but are
    still mentioned here. This history is a log of the programmer so that he
    can look up what has been done/tried/modified. Things that were implemented
    and removed later are marked with [VOID].

    Version 2.2   (09-Dec-23)

    - Fix: Modal dialogs managed by RapaGUI didn't work correctly with Plananarama (reported by Christos
      Tsaldaris and Dimitris Panokostas)

    Version 2.1   (18-Nov-23)

    - Change: When requiring Plananarama and the front screen is not planar, the plugin will not install
      itself any more; this makes it possible to write scripts that work on both planar and RGB screens
      without the need to distribute separate builds for planar screens; if you want to force Plananarama
      to install itself even on RGB screens, you can set the new &quot;PlanarOnly&quot; tag in @REQUIRE to FALSE;
      this can be useful in case your script wants to open a custom planar screen with Plananarama; in
      that case, the front screen's color depth is irrelevant because your script opens its own planar
      screen but you have to set &quot;PlanarOnly&quot; to FALSE now in that case because otherwise Plananarama
      wouldn't install itself in case the front screen is RGB (requested by Dimitris Panokostas)

    Version 2.0   (13-Feb-22)

    - New: Added a set of three example scripts that show how to use Plananarama in the new palette
      mode; the &quot;EasterIntro&quot; and &quot;Sprites&quot; examples also demonstrate the use of real Amiga hardware
      sprites
    - New: Added a fully featured manual in various formats instead of just a readme file
    - Change: Amiga installer will now also copy the plugin to Hollywood's linker plugins directory
      so that it can be easily linked to executables
    - New: Added planar.GetSpriteType() which returns the type of the hardware sprite class registered
      by Plananarama for use with GetAttribute() and other object library functions; Plananarama's
      hardware sprite class supports the following attributes: #ATTRWIDTH, #ATTRHEIGHT, #ATTRDEPTH,
      #ATTRXPOS, #ATTRYPOS, #ATTRSTATE
    - New: Added planar.VWait(); this will wait for the monitor's vertical blank interrupt; useful
      in connection with hardware sprites
    - New: Added &quot;SpriteResolution&quot; tag; this can be used to set the sprite resolution; set it to 1
      for lores or 2 for hires; the default is 0 which will use the default sprite resolution (this
      is typically the pointer resolution because AmigaOS implements the mouse pointer using sprites);
      note that this tag is only really necessary on AGA because on ECS sprites are always lores
    - New: Added support for real hardware sprites; unfortunately, sprites were never the Amiga's
      strong point so they won't give you too much power; the Amiga hardware can only handle eight
      hardware sprites; if you want them to use 16 colors instead of 4 colors, then this goes down
      even further to just 4 hardware sprites; on ECS the width is limited to 16 pixels, on AGA it
      is limited to 64 pixels; there's no restriction on the height, though; you can create hardware
      sprites from palette brushes with the following new Plananarama functions: planar.CreateSprite(),
      planar.FreeSprite(), planar.MapSprite(), planar.UnmapSprite(), planar.MoveSprite(); sprites
      can be dynamically mapped and unmapped to/from the DMA sprite channels on the hardware to give
      you some flexibility when it comes to animations (requested by Niels Schapke)
    - New: Added planar.HaveAGA() function for detecting whether or not the AGA chipset is available
      on the host machine (requested by Niels Schapke)
    - New: Added support for Hollywood 9's new palette mode; you can enable this mode by setting the
      new &quot;PaletteMode&quot; tag to TRUE when @REQUIREing Plananarama; activating palette mode will make
      Plananarama open in fullscreen mode and set up the current BGPic's palette as the screen's
      palette; this has the great advantage that no remapping needs to take place in case all your
      images use the same palette so it should be quite fast; also, it's possible to do nice palette
      effects by changing pens, e.g. it's possible to fade or cycle colors with almost no CPU load
      because in palette mode, Plananarama can directly modify the hardware's color register instead
      of having to redraw everything when colors change (as it needs to be done for real TrueColour
      graphics); another advantage is that the new palette mode doesn't require lots of chip memory
      because graphics can be drawn from fast memory so it's not necessary to install FBlit; also,
      guigfx.library and render.library are not necessary when using the new palette mode and memory
      consumption is also much lower than when using the default TrueColour mode; in the new palette
      mode all drawing is done using the WriteChunkyPixels() command from graphics.library which is
      very slow on OS3.1-3.9 so you might want to use BlazeWCP from Aminet to speed up things; also
      rumour has it that the implementation of WriteChunkyPixels() in 3.1.4 has seen optimizations
      so BlazeWCP might not be necessary on 3.1.4 but I haven't done any benchmarks
    - New: Added support for drawing Hollywood 9's new CLUT images
    - New: Added support for Hollywood's &quot;OnDropFile&quot; event handler; this feature requires at least
      Hollywood 7 (requested by Petteri Valli)
    - New: Added menu support; all Hollywood menu functions are now also available from Plananarama;
      this feature required at least Hollywood 9.0 (requested by J&ouml;rg Rupp and Petteri Valli)
    - New: Plananarama supports the &quot;VanillaKey&quot; and &quot;OnRawKey&quot; event handlers now if Hollywood 7 is
      available (7.1 for the raw key handlers); these event handlers allow you to listen to Unicode
      and raw key events
    - New: Added Unicode support; this feature requires at least Hollywood 7.0  
    - New: Added &quot;NoBlackBackground&quot; tag; if this is set to TRUE, Plananarama won't set color 0 to
      black when opening in fullscreen mode; this fixes the problem that Plananarama wasn't able to
      draw in grey when opening a 4 color screen (reported by Piotr Chmielewski)
    - Fix: Plananarama didn't allow display mode to be switched between windowed mode and fullscreen
      mode (reported by Piotr Chmielewski)
    - Fix: Y mouse position offset returned to Hollywood scripts was often shifted down by the window's
      top border height (reported by Piotr Chmielewski)
     
    Version 1.0   (10-Jan-16)
    - First Release
