<h2 class="heading">3.5 Hardware sprites</h2>

<p>
Starting with Plananarama 2.0 the plugin also supports Amiga hardware sprites. Since these are
managed by the Amiga's custom chipset hardware, they can be drawn extremely efficiently without any
performance penalties. However, sprites have always been the Amiga's Achilles heel since they are
quite limited in comparison to other systems (especially in comparison to gaming consoles).

<p>
Specifically, there are the following limitations when it comes to hardware sprites on the
Amiga:

<p>
<ul class="toc">
<li>&ndash;&nbsp;there are only 8 sprite DMA channels so you can only have a maximum of 8 sprites
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;each sprite DMA channel can only handle 4 color graphics
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;luckily, two sprite DMA channels can be combined to create a 16 color sprite but
this means that if you use 16 color sprites, you can only have 4 of them because each
16 color sprite will occupy two sprite DMA channels
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;on OCS/ECS the maximum sprite width is 16 pixels
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;on AGA the maximum sprite width is 64 pixels
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;there is no maximum sprite height
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;the individual sprite DMA channels are tied to certain color registers and one
color is always reserved for transparency. See <a href="planarCreateSprite.html">planar.CreateSprite</a> for details.
</li></ul>

<p>
Due to all these limitations you won't be able to move mountains with Amiga hardware sprites
but if you only need to have a few sprites, they can still be quite useful because they
can be drawn so quickly since they are completely handled on the hardware level.

<p>
Note that when using hardware sprites you should use Plananarama in palette mode because
in remapping mode you won't have control over the screen's palette pens so there is no
way to set the sprite colors. See <a href="PaletteMode.html">Palette mode</a> for details.

<p>
Also note that you might want to set the <code>SpriteResolution</code> tag when using hardware
sprites. Otherwise your sprites will use the system's sprite resolution which might
not be what you want. E.g. if the system's sprite resolution is hires, your sprites
will appear in hires as well which might not be what you want. The system's sprite
resolution is typically identical with the mouse pointer resolution set in the system's
&quot;Pointer&quot; preferences because AmigaOS implements the mouse pointer using a hardware
sprite. So if the user has configured a hires pointer here, then all your sprites will
use hires by default as well. If you don't want that, set the <code>SpriteResolution</code>
tag to 1 to force lores sprites. See <a href="Configuration.html">Configuring Plananarama</a> for details.
Note that the <code>SpriteResolution</code> tag is only really needed on AGA systems because on
ECS systems sprites are always lores.
