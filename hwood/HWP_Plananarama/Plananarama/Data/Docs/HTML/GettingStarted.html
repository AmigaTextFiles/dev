<p>
After you have installed Plananarama, Hollywood will automatically use it if CyberGraphX or
Picasso96 are unavailable because your system doesn't have a graphics board. Thus, as soon
as Plananarama is installed, all your Hollywood scripts will &quot;automagically&quot; run on palette
screens because Hollywood will route them through Plananarama. If you leave everything to
Hollywood, your scripts will run in remapping mode. This mode guarantees maximum compatibility
but also needs lots of memory and can be slow, depending on what the script does.

<p>
It's also possible to write scripts that are specifically designed for Plananarama. This typically
allows you to achieve a better performance because you're working within the restrictions of
palette-based screens. Scripts specifically designed for Plananarama should request palette
mode from Plananarama by setting the <code>PaletteMode</code> tag when <code>@REQUIRE-ing</code> the plugin, e.g.

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>@REQUIRE &quot;plananarama&quot;, {PaletteMode = True}
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

The line above will tell Plananarama to run in palette mode. The difference between palette
and remapping mode is that in palette mode your script has direct access to the screen's
palette pens. For example, when calling Hollywood's <code>SetPen()</code> function in palette mode,
you can directly change the color of a screen pen and using Hollywood's <code>SetPalette()</code> command you
can set a whole new palette. This can be used for several effects like color cycling or
fading and since changing screen palette pens is managed by the Amiga's custom chip hardware,
the result will be visible instantly with almost no delay.

<p>
Furthermore, since you have full control over the screen's palette in palette mode, you can also
store all your graphics in a way so that the palette of your images matches the palette of the
screen. If that is the case, graphics can be drawn really quickly because no color remapping needs
to be done and drawing graphics is just a matter of copying raw pixels. Thus, to get the best
performance with Plananarama you should put the plugin in palette mode and then design your script
in a way that avoids color remapping as much as possible, e.g. by making all images use the
same, global palette. This also means that you shouldn't pass RGB colors when drawing primitives
like rectangles, lines, circles etc. but that you should draw using palette pens instead. This
is possible by setting the palette mode to <code>#PALETTE_PEN</code>, like so:

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>SetPaletteMode(#PALETTEMODE_PEN)
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

Palette mode will also allow you to use hardware sprites which can speed up things further
because these sprites can be drawn in next to no time since they're completely handled by
the Amiga's custom chip hardware. See <a href="HardwareSprites.html">Hardware sprites</a> for details. Another advantage of
using palette mode is that your script won't require guigfx.library and render.library. To
speed up drawing in palette mode, it's advised to install BlazeWCP though. See <a href="Requirements.html">Requirements</a> for details.

<p>
Note that in palette mode, Plananarama will always open its own screen (even if the Hollywood script
explicitly requests window mode). The reason for this is that full control over the screen palette
is only possible in case Plananarama runs on its own screen. When running on Workbench or other screens
shared with other applications, palette pens need to be shared as well which makes things more complicated.
See <a href="PaletteMode.html">Palette mode</a> for details.

<p>
In remapping mode, which is Plananarama's default mode, Plananarama can run on its own screen or on
other screens like Workbench. In case remapping mode is active, Plananarama won't give you access to
the screen's palette pens but it will remap the colors of all graphics it draws to match the screen's palette.
This is of course much slower than drawing graphics whose colors match the screen's palette in
palette mode (see above) but it is very flexible and allows you to make any Hollywood script
run on a palette screen as long as you have enough free memory. See <a href="RemappingMode.html">Remapping mode</a> for details.

<p>
Note that palette mode requires Hollywood 9 or better. Remapping mode needs at least Hollywood 6.
