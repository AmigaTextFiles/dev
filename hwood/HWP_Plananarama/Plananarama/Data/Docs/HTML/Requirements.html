<h2 class="heading">1.3 Requirements</h2>

<p>
This plugin requires at least Hollywood 6.0 since it uses the display and bitmap adapter APIs
introduced with Hollywood 6.0. Some features, however, require newer Hollywood versions.
Here's an overview of the features only available with newer Hollywood versions:

<p>
<ul class="toc">
<li>&ndash;&nbsp;Unicode support: requires Hollywood 7
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Support for <code>VanillaKey</code> and <code>OnDropFile</code> event handler: requires Hollywood 7
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Support for <code>OnRawKey</code> event handler: requires Hollywood 7.1
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Support for menus: requires Hollywood 9
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Support for Plananarama's special palette mode: requires Hollywood 9
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Hardware sprite support: requires Hollywood 9
</li></ul>

<p>
The following optional components might be required as well:

<p>
<ul class="toc">
<li>&ndash;&nbsp;guigfx.library and render.library: These two libraries are required when the <code>PaletteMode</code>
tag in the <code>@REQUIRE</code> call has been set to <code>False</code> (which is also the default). In that case,
Plananarama will remap all graphics to the current screen's palette. This is done using guigfx.library
and render.library. If you set <code>PaletteMode</code> to <code>True</code>, however, Plananarama won't require
guigfx.library and render.library because graphics won't be remapped to the screen palette
but all graphics will be drawn using the screen's pens.

<p>
Note that render.library is available in two flavours: There is a v40 and a v30 branch. It is
recommended to use the latest version of the v30 branch because all the v40 versions are C ports of
the v30 branch versions which are all written in 68k assembler. The assembler version (= v30 branch)
of render.library is much faster than the C version which is why you might want to use the
assembler version instead. The latest assembler version of render.library is v32.0. So if you
care about performance you should use this one. Also, the v40 branch of render.library requires
an FPU which is another reason to use the latest version from the v32 branch instead.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;FBlit: When the <code>PaletteMode</code> tag in the <code>@REQUIRE</code> call has been set to <code>False</code> (which is
also the default), it is highly recommended to use FBlit because otherwise your chip memory
will be gone in no time and Hollywood will run out of memory. So make sure you install FBlit
first and you add Hollywood to its &quot;Include&quot; list in the &quot;FAllocBitMap&quot; tab. If Hollywood is
included in this list, it will be able to place graphics in fast memory which is absolutely
needed since 2 MB of chip memory certainly won't be enough for Hollywood. Using FBlit also has
the advantage that Hollywood can use the CPU for blitting which is much faster than the blitter
on higher 68k CPUs or WinUAE anyway. If <code>PaletteMode</code> is set to <code>True</code>, FBlit isn't necessary
because Hollywood can store its graphics data in fast memory. In that case, however, you might
want to use BlazeWCP (see below).

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;BlazeWCP: When the <code>PaletteMode</code> tag in the <code>@REQUIRE</code> call has been set to <code>True</code>, Hollywood
will store all graphics in fast memory and draw them using the <code>WriteChunkyPixels()</code> command from
graphics.library. <code>WriteChunkyPixels()</code>, however, is very slow on OS3.1-3.9 so you might want to use
BlazeWCP from Aminet to speed up things. Rumour has it that the implementation of <code>WriteChunkyPixels()</code>
in the new classic AmigaOS releases by Hyperion (3.1.4 and up) has seen some optimizations so BlazeWCP
might not be necessary on 3.1.4 and up any longer but I haven't done any benchmarks so I can't tell
whether BlazeWCP is still necessary with the classic AmigaOS releases by Hyperion. It's definitely
recommended with classic AmigaOS 3.1, 3.5 and 3.9.
