<h2 class="heading">2.2 Frequently asked questions</h2>

<p>
This section covers some frequently asked questions. Please read them first
before asking on the forum because your problem might have been covered here.

<p>
<b>Q: Plananarama says &quot;Cannot open guigfx.library!&quot; but I have guigfx.library installed.</b>

<p>
A: guigfx.library requires render.library and will fail to open in case render.library isn't
present so make sure you have render.library as well. If you do, make sure you have the
right version of render.library. Some require an FPU and will fail to open if no FPU is
present. See <a href="Requirements.html">Requirements</a> for details.

<b>Q: My system crashes with a 8000000B software failure.</b>

<p>
A: You are using a version of render.library or guigfx.library that needs an FPU on a system
without an FPU. Make sure to use the appropriate version for your system because some versions
of render.library and guigfx.library don't check if an FPU is present, they will just crash if
there is none. See <a href="Requirements.html">Requirements</a> for details.

<b>Q: I'm getting an &quot;Out of memory!&quot; error but I have lots of fast memory.</b>

<p>
A: First make sure you have installed FBlit. Then make sure that you've configured FBlit correctly.
You have to add Hollywood to FBlit's &quot;Include&quot; list in the &quot;FAllocBitMap&quot; tab. If Hollywood is
included in this list, it will be able to place graphics in fast memory which is absolutely
needed since 2 MB of chip memory certainly won't be enough for Hollywood. So make sure you
configure FBlit correctly.

<b>Q: Plananarama is very slow.</b>

<p>
A: This can have many reasons. If you've set the <code>PaletteMode</code> tag to <code>True</code> in <code>@REQUIRE</code>, make
sure to install the BlazeWCP patch from Aminet to speed up drawing. In palette mode, you can
also speed up drawing significantly if you only use palette graphics, i.e. don't use brushes,
BGPics, anims etc. that are stored as hi/true colour RGB images but use palette images only.
Ideally, they should use the same palette as the screen you want to draw them to so that
Plananarama doesn't have to do any remapping but can just draw them.

<p>
Another reason might be that your script is drawing many images with alpha channel graphics,
e.g. anti-aliased text/shapes or images with variable levels of transparency. These things do
not make much sense on palette-based screens and they are very, very expensive on the CPU because
Plananarama needs to remap these images from true colour chunky pixels to planar graphics all the time.

<p>
Thus, if you care about performance you should not use any alpha channel images and transparency
should be limited to monochrome transparency (i.e. visible and invisible pixels). The best idea
is to use a fixed set of prerendered graphics. When just drawing prerendered graphics with no
changes concerning the colors, Plananarama should perform quite well on planar screens and
scripts should also be usable on slower systems, though you still need a fast CPU and some fast
memory of course.

<b>Q: Is there a Hollywood forum where I can get in touch with other users?</b>

<p>
A: Yes, please check out the &quot;Community&quot; section of the official Hollywood
Portal online at <a href="http://www.hollywood-mal.com" target="_blank">http://www.hollywood-mal.com</a>.

<b>Q: Where can I ask for help?</b>

welcome to join it and ask your question there.
