Version 2.1   (27-Sep-24)
- Fix: SVG images can now also be loaded without @REQUIREing the plugin first (reported by Ralf
  Gruner)

Version 2.0   (17-Jul-24)
- Change: Updated documentation
- New: Added new example that demonstrates SVG image loading
- New: Added support for the SVG image format; Pangomonium can now also act as a loader for the
  SVG image format; the functionality is exactly the same as with the separate SVG plugin that
  has been available for Hollywood for over a decade now; the difference is that Pangomonium's
  SVG loader is more compatible and also has full support for Unicode text inside SVG images
- Change [Windows]: Reduced minimum required Windows version from Windows 7 to Windows Vista
- Change [Windows]: Reduced binary size by several megabyte because we link against hand-tailored
  versions of the dependency libraries now instead of the ones from the official distributions
- Fix [OS3]: Memory access fault when using pcontext:SetLanguage()
- Fix [Amiga]: Memory access fault when using Cairo's PDF surface
- Fix [OS4]: Rendering text with Cairo to PDF surfaces didn't always work

Version 1.0a  (06-Jul-24)
- Note: This release only contains updated builds for macOS; the builds for all the other
  platforms are identical with the v1.0 release
- Change [macOS/x64+arm64]: MacPorts is no longer required by Pangomonium; the plugin is
  completely stand-alone now
- Fix [macOS/PPC]: The plugin didn't work correctly on PowerPC macOS (reported by Ruben Hart)

Version 1.0   (17-Mar-24)
- First Release
