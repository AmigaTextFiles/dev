<p>
Pangomonium is a plugin for Hollywood that features advanced rendering engines both for text and
graphics. Pangomonium's text rendering engine features state-of-the-art layouting and makes
it possible to draw text in almost every language of the world. It supports complex layouts like the
right-to-left or bidirectional ones found in the Arabic and Hebrew languages or vertical layouts
in columns like in Japanese. Pangomonium can also handle complex-text languages like Hindi and
fonts that contain colored glyphs (emojis) are supported as well. By giving you full access to
the Pango API the plugin also enables you to customize all stages of the text rendering process.

<p>
Furthermore, Pangomonium also comes with a loader for the popular SVG vector image format. As
soon as Pangomonium is installed, Hollywood will &quot;automagically&quot; be able to load and draw SVG
images. SVG images will be loaded as true vector images by Pangomonium which means that you can
scale and transform them as you wish without any losses in quality. They will be perfectly
crisp in any resolution.

<p>
On top of that, Pangomonium also provides Hollywood wrappers for almost all functions of the popular
Cairo graphics engine, allowing you to access advanced vector graphics drawing features directly
from Hollywood scripts. Using the Cairo API via Pangomonium has the advantage that you have
fine-tuned control over everything when drawing vector graphics.

<p>
There are two ways of using Pangomonium: There is a high-level interface that can directly hook itself
into Hollywood's text and vector graphics library, enhancing it with features provided by Pangomonium,
e.g. drawing colored emojis or text with complex layouts such as Arabic or Japanese. This is the most
convenient way of using Pangomonium because you don't have to use the Pango and Cairo functions directly
here but you can just use established Hollywood functions.

<p>
Another way of using Pangomonium is the low-level interface: This interface allows you to access the
Pango and Cairo APIs directly from Hollywood scripts. This is extremely powerful because it allows you
to access hundreds of different text and graphics rendering features, making it possible to fine-tune
Pangomonium to your specific needs. Pangomonium contains over 500 commands to make all your text and
vector graphics rendering dreams come true!

<p>
Finally, Pangomonium comes with extensive documentation in various formats like PDF, HTML, AmigaGuide,
and CHM that contains detailed descriptions of all functions and methods offered by the plugin.

<p>
All of this makes Pangomonium the ultimate text and graphics rendering engine for Hollywood that contains
everything you need to draw text in any language spoken on the planet.
