    Please read the history bottom-up. Note that the history might list some
    features that were implemented in beta versions and removed later but are
    still mentioned here. This history is a log of the programmer so that he
    can look up what has been done/tried/modified. Things that were implemented
    and removed later are marked with [VOID].
     
    Version 1.1   (27-Sep-20)

    - Change: Updated documentation
    - New [OS4]: Added support for AmigaOS 4; this requires SDL 2.0.12 (July 2020) or better; 
      since SDL2 on OS4 supports both MiniGL and OpenGL ES 2.0 you can now get full hardware
      accelerated drawing and scaling even on OS4 systems that don't support MiniGL anymore but
      only OpenGL ES 2.0; using hardware accelerated drawing and scaling will dramatically
      improve RebelSDL's performance and can also be used to speed up normal Hollywood scripts
      (thanks to Juha Niemim&auml;ki)
    - New [MorphOS]: Added build for PowerSDL; since SDL2 on MorphOS currently doesn't support
      hardware acceleration it's probably better to use PowerSDL, i.e. SDL1, instead because
      SDL2 without hardware acceleration doesn't make much sense; PowerSDL offers hardware
      acceleration but doesn't support all of RebelSDL's features (e.g. multi-window support)
    - New: Added support for Hollywood's palette image interface
    - New: Added mouse wheel support; this requires Hollywood 8.0 or better (requested by Niels
      Schapke)
    - New: RebelSDL now supports direct draw transformation and alpha blending via DisplayBrush();
      if you draw a hardware brush with DisplayBrush() and set one of the transformation tags
      (e.g. &quot;ScaleX&quot;, &quot;ScaleY&quot;, &quot;Rotate&quot;, etc.) or the &quot;Transparency&quot; tag, the specified
      parameters are applied directly on drawing; this should give a good speed boost over the
      old implementation but it requires Hollywood 8.0 or better 
    - New: RebelSDL recognizes the &quot;SmoothScale&quot; tag in LoadBrush(), @BRUSH, CreateBrush() and
      CopyBrush() now if Hollywood 8.0 or better is in use; this makes sdl.SetScaleQuality()
      somewhat obsolete for people using Hollywood 8.0 or better
    - Fix: Hardware brush rotation was always done in the wrong direction
    - New [Linux/ARM]: RebelSDL only worked on Raspberry Pi systems but not on other ARM Linux
      distributions; two additional builds have been added now: a pure OpenGL build that doesn't
      access the RPi's special hardware and can thus be used on any ARM Linux that supports the
      OpenGL standard; additionally, an OpenGLES build has been added; this can be used on all
      ARM Linux systems that use OpenGLES (e.g. ODROID) (requested by Fabio Falcucci and Samuel
      Crow)
    - Change [Windows]: RebelSDL no longer requires the Visual C++ Redistributable DLLs; it is
      completely stand-alone now! (but about 200kb bigger because it is now statically linked
      against MSVCRT)
    - New: Added sdl.SetScaleQuality() which can be used to specify how a texture/hardware brush
      should be scaled; you can pass &quot;nearest&quot; for no interpolation or &quot;linear&quot; for linear
      filtering; Direct3D also supports &quot;best&quot; for anisotropic filtering; the scale mode is set
      when a hardware brush/texture is created so you need to call sdl.SetScaleQuality() before
      creating a hardware brush/texture; this also means that you cannot use it for brushes
      loaded in the preprocessor commands because those will always be loaded before the script
      execution starts (requested by Fabio Falcucci)

    Version 1.0   (09-Sep-17)
    - First Release
