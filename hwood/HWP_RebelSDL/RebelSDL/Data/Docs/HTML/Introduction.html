<p>
RebelSDL is a plugin for Hollywood that allows you to use SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) from Hollywood. This makes
it possible to write scripts that utilize the host system's graphics hardware to create high-performance, butter-smooth
2D animation that is produced completely in hardware by the GPU of your graphics board. This leads to a huge
performance boost over the classic Hollywood graphics API which is mostly implemented in software for maximum
portability and compatibility. Especially systems with slower CPUs (like the Raspberry Pi) will benefit greatly from
hardware-accelerated drawing, scaling, and transformation offered by SDL.

<p>
SDL is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick,
and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games.
More information about SDL can be obtained from <a href="http://www.libsdl.org" target="_new">http://www.libsdl.org</a>. You can find good tutorials about learning
SDL all over the web.

<p>
RebelSDL transparently replaces Hollywood's inbuilt display handler with its own display handler managed by SDL.
Whenever RebelSDL is activated, Hollywood displays are automatically mapped to SDL windows and hardware brushes are
mapped directly to SDL textures so that they can be drawn, scaled, and transformed in an extremely quick way on all supported
systems. This is especially useful on Windows, macOS, and Linux because Hollywood doesn't support hardware double buffers
and hardware brushes on these platforms by default. With RebelSDL, however, hardware double buffers and hardware brushes
can be used on these platforms now too. So RebelSDL can also act as a helper plugin here which adds this functionality
to Hollywood without having you write a single line of SDL code to utilize it!

<p>
On top of that, RebelSDL offers wrapper functions for some useful commands of the SDL API, for example RebelSDL
allows you to call SDL's joystick and game controller functions which are much more flexible than Hollywood's
inbuilt joystick library. RebelSDL also allows you to access Hollywood hardware brushes as SDL textures and
modify their properties via some dedicated SDL calls exposed by RebelSDL.

<p>
Finally, RebelSDL also replaces Hollywood's inbuilt audio driver with the audio driver offered by SDL. In contrast
to the graphics driver SDL's audio driver probably doesn't have any advantage over Hollywood's inbuilt audio
driver but by using it RebelSDL will make your program into a complete SDL application which doesn't only
use SDL for graphics output but also for audio output.

<p>
RebelSDL utilizes the new display adapter plugin interface introduced with Hollywood 6.0. Thus, the
plugin will not work with any older versions of Hollywood. It requires at least Hollywood 6.0. Whenever
RebelSDL is activated, all graphics and audio output will automatically be routed through SDL. To benefit
from hardware-accelered drawing, however, Hollywood scripts have to follow some rules as described in this
manual.

<p>
RebelSDL comes with extensive documentation in various formats like PDF, HTML, AmigaGuide, and CHM that
contains information about how to use this plugin. On top of that, many example scripts are included in the
distribution archive to get you started really quickly.

<p>
All of this makes RebelSDL the ultimate scripting experience for all you SDL rebels by combining the best of
both worlds into one powerful plugin: Hollywood's extensive and convenient multimedia function set and SDL's raw
graphics power!
