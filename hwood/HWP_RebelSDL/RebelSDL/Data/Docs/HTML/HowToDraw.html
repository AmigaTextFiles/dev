<h2 class="heading">3.3 Drawing graphics</h2>

<p>
For an optimal performance you need to be very careful concerning the way you draw your
graphics. Most of Hollywood's drawing commands are implemented in software only, i.e. they
draw using the CPU instead of the GPU. This can become quite a bottleneck especially on
slower CPUs. Thus, you should know which drawing functions are hardware-accelerated and
which aren't and then write your scripts accordingly.

<p>
The following Hollywood commands are hardware-accelerated when RebelSDL is active and
they are used within a hardware double buffer:

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>Box()
Cls()
Line()
Plot()
DisplayBrush()
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

<code>DisplayBrush()</code> will only use hardware acceleration when called with a hardware brush.
See <a href="HardwareBrushes.html">Using hardware brushes</a> for details. When used with a software brush, i.e. a brush
that doesn't reside in video memory, <code>DisplayBrush()</code> will draw the brush using the CPU
which is much slower.

<p>
<code>Box()</code>, <code>Line()</code>, and <code>WritePixel()</code> will only use hardware acceleration in case the fill style is
either <code>#FILLNONE</code> or <code>#FILLCOLOR</code> and no other form styles like <code>#EDGE</code> or <code>#SHADOW</code> are active. As soon
as you want to draw with other fill or form styles, these commands will fall back to their software
counterparts and thus will be very slow. You can work around this problem by simply drawing the
graphics into a hardware brush first and then just drawing this hardware brush. This is a good
strategy because then Hollywood's software renderer will be used only once, i.e. when drawing
the graphics into a hardware brush, and after that you'll profit from hardware acceleration
all the time because hardware brushes can be drawn really quickly.

<p>
Finally, don't forget that you should do all your drawing inside a hardware double buffer
loop. See <a href="HardwareDB.html">Using a hardware double buffer</a> for details.
