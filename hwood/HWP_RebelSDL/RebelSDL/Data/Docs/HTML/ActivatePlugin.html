<h2 class="heading">3.1 Activating RebelSDL</h2>

<p>
All you have to do to make your script use SDL instead of Hollywood's inbuilt graphics driver
is adding the following line to the top of your script:

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>@REQUIRE &quot;rebelsdl&quot;
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

Alternatively, if you are using Hollywood from a console, you can also start your script like
this:

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>Hollywood test.hws -requireplugins rebelsdl
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

Once the RebelSDL plugin has been activated for your script, it will reroute all of Hollywood's
graphics output through SDL. Note that this will usually be slower than Hollywood's inbuilt
graphics driver for scripts that aren't optimized for RebelSDL. To get an optimal performance with
SDL, your script needs to use a hardware-accelerated double buffer. See <a href="HardwareDB.html">Using a hardware double buffer</a> for details.

<p>
RebelSDL accepts the following arguments in its <code>@REQUIRE</code> call:

<p>
<dl>
<dt class="codelist"><code>EnableVSync:</code></dt>
<dd>
By default, RebelSDL's hardware double buffer is sync'ed with the monitor's vertical refresh.
This means that <code>Flip()</code> will always block until the next vertical refresh and then flip
the buffers. This will generate perfectly smooth graphics but of course it also means
that you can't draw faster than the monitor's vertical refresh, typically around 60 times
per second. If you want to ignore the monitor's vertical refresh, set this tag to <code>False</code>
and RebelSDL won't throttle double buffer flipping. It will then flip buffers as fast as
the hardware allows. Defaults to <code>True</code>.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>ForceFullRefresh:</code></dt>
<dd>
If this tag is set to <code>False</code>, RebelSDL will only refresh the parts of the display that have
actually changed. This is quicker but it can lead to some refresh problems depending on the
way your script draws its graphics. That is why this tag defaults to <code>True</code>, which means that
RebelSDL will always refresh the full display whenever something is drawn. This is slower
but guarantees that there will be no visual artefacts because front and back buffers will
always be completely in sync.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>RenderDriver:</code></dt>
<dd>
This tag allows you to select a different render driver than the default one. This is
mostly useful for testing purposes. For example, it is possible to force RebelSDL to
use OpenGL on Windows instead of the default Direct3D driver with this tag. Possible
values for this tag are <code>direct3d</code>, <code>opengl</code>, <code>opengles</code>, <code>opengles2</code>, <code>rpi</code>, and <code>software</code>.
See <a href="RaspberryPi.html">Raspberry Pi peculiarities</a> for more information on the rpi driver.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>UseAudioAdapter:</code></dt>
<dd>
By default, RebelSDL will replace Hollywood's inbuilt audio driver with a custom audio driver
that uses SDL to play audio. If you don't want that, set this tag to <code>False</code>. Then Hollywood's
inbuilt audio driver will be used even when RebelSDL is active. Normally, however, it's not necessary
to set this tag unless you experience problems with RebelSDL's audio driver. Defaults to <code>True</code>.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>UseBitmapAdapter:</code></dt>
<dd>
If this is set to <code>True</code>, RebelSDL will override Hollywood's inbuilt handler for software
bitmaps. This doesn't have any practical advantages and was only implemented to test the
corresponding Hollywood SDK functionality. Defaults to <code>False</code>.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>UseDesktopFullScreen:</code></dt>
<dd>
SDL offers a special display mode that automatically scales windows opened by SDL to the
dimensions of the desktop. The window will then occupy all screen space without changing
the monitor's resolution. You can activate this mode by setting this tag to <code>True</code>. Setting
this tag to <code>True</code> will also automatically activate autoscaling for your display. Note that
a similar effect can be achieved by using Hollywood's <code>FullScreenScale</code> display mode but
it's preferrable to use <code>UseDesktopFullScreen</code> because it is directly tied to SDL.
Defaults to <code>False</code>.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>UseDoubleBufferAdapter:</code></dt>
<dd>
If this is set to <code>False</code>, RebelSDL won't support hardware double buffers. Since hardware
double buffers are one of the most important features of RebelSDL, there's probably no
case where you'd want to disable this feature. It's mostly here for debugging purposes.
Defaults to <code>True</code>.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>UseSoftwareRenderer:</code></dt>
<dd>
By default, SDL will try to use the GPU to draw graphics whenever and wherever possible.
If you don't want this, you can set this tag to <code>True</code> to put SDL into pure software
drawing mode. This is probably only of use for testing and debugging purposes because
normally you'd want to use the hardware renderer for the best performance. Defaults to
<code>False</code>.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>UseVideoBitmapAdapter:</code></dt>
<dd>
If this is set to <code>False</code>, RebelSDL won't support hardware brushes. Since hardware brushes
are one of the most important features of RebelSDL, there's probably no case where you'd
want to disable this feature. It's mostly here for debugging purposes. Defaults to
<code>True</code>.
</dd></dl>

<p>
Here is an example of how to pass arguments to the <code>@REQUIRE</code> preprocessor command:

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>@REQUIRE &quot;rebelsdl&quot;, {UseDesktopFullScreen = True}
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

Alternatively, you can also use the <code>-requiretags</code> console argument to pass these
arguments. See the Hollywood manual for more information.
