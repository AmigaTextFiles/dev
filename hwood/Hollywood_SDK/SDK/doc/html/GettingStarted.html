<p>
The best way to learn to write Hollywood plugins is a learning-by-doing based
approach. Just take a look at the source code of one of the example plugins that
come with this SDK and use this documentation to try to understand what is
going on there. After you have understood the structure and operation modes of
some basic plugins, you can start to extend them by adding your own code, using
this documentation as a reference manual.

<p>
This SDK expects that you are familiar with the C language and know how to
use a C compiler to create libraries. If you aren't an experienced Amiga
programmer, it is advised that you start out on Windows or Linux first,
because it's much easier to write Hollywood plugins on these systems than
on AmigaOS-based systems. Once you have developed a stable plugin on Windows
or Linux and you are confident with Hollywood's plugin API, you may tackle
an AmigaOS build as well, although there are several pitfalls that you have
to avoid. See <a href="AmigaOSGlueCode.html">AmigaOS peculiarities</a> for details.

<p>
If you need help, don't hesitate to ask on the official Hollywood forums
which are online at <a href="http://forums.hollywood-mal.com/" target="_new">http://forums.hollywood-mal.com/</a> There you will
find a friendly community from all around the world which can surely help
you to solve your programming problems.
