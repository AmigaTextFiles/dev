<p>
The Hollywood SDK comes with several example plugins and makefiles for lots of different
platforms. You can study the source code of these examples to learn more about the
practical aspects of writing a Hollywood plugin. The following example plugins are
currently included with the SDK:

<p>
<dl>
<dt class="codelist"><code>AIFF:</code></dt>
<dd>
This is a plugin of type <code>HWPLUG_CAPS_SOUND</code> which adds a loader for the AIFF audio
file format popular on the macOS platforms to Hollywood. The AIFF file format's
layout is very easy to understand so this plugin is a good starting point for
learners who want to write a sound plugin. See <a href="SoundOverview.html">Sound plugins</a> for details.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>DisplayAdapter:</code></dt>
<dd>
This is a plugin of type <code>HWPLUG_CAPS_DISPLAYADAPTER</code>. It is just a very basic example
that shows how to replace Hollywood's inbuilt display adapter with a minimal custom
display adapter (here based on SDL). It is not optimized in any way and only the most
basic functionality has been implemented. Its aim is to get you started with writing
custom display adapters, that's why this plugin has deliberately been kept as simple
as possible to make it easier to understand the code. Once you have understood this plugin,
here are some ideas how you can optimize it:

<p>
<ol>
<li>Add support for hardware double buffers
</li><li>Add support for video bitmaps that can be drawn to hardware double buffers
</li><li>Add support for scaling and transforming video bitmaps using the GPU
</li><li>Add support for offscreen drawing to video bitmaps
</li><li>Add audio support through SDL
</li></ol>

<p>
RebelSDL can do all that and in fact this plugin is nothing else than a cut-down
version of RebelSDL so as a little exercise you can try to implement all RebelSDL
features that have been cut from this plugin.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>Library:</code></dt>
<dd>
This is a plugin of type <code>HWPLUG_CAPS_LIBRARY</code>. It adds some primitive functions
and constants to Hollywood and is a good starting point if you want to extend
Hollywood's command set using your own functions. It can also be used to learn
about the way the Lua VM works. See <a href="LibraryOverview.html">Library plugins</a> for details.

<p>
</dd>
<dt class="codelist"><code>PCX:</code></dt>
<dd>
This is a plugin of type <code>HWPLUG_CAPS_IMAGE</code> which adds a loader for the PCX image
file format to Hollywood. Have a look at this source code if you intend to write
an image loader plugin for Hollywood. See <a href="ImageOverview.html">Image plugins</a> for details.
</dd></dl>

<p>
As an exercise, you might want to use the AIFF or PCX plugin source codes as a
starting point and extend them to include a saver for these formats as well.
See <a href="ImageSaverOverview.html">Image saver plugins</a> for details.
See <a href="SampleSaverOverview.html">Sample saver plugins</a> for details.

<p>
More plugin source codes are available at the official Hollywood portal at <a href="http://www.hollywood-mal.com" target="_new">http://www.hollywood-mal.com</a>.
You can find them in the download section next to the binary distributions of the
plugins.
