<p>
<code>LuaBase</code> contains functions to deal with the Lua VM that is at the heart of Hollywood.
You will have to use these functions when writing plugins that add new commands and
constants to Hollywood's script language. These plugins need to have the <code>HWPLUG_CAPS_LIBRARY</code>
capability flag set. See <a href="LibraryOverview.html">Library plugins</a> for details.

<p>
Hollywood is based on Lua 5.0.2, although it isn't compatible with the Lua language.
See <a href="LuaVSHollywood.html">Differences between Hollywood and Lua</a> for details.

<p>
Most functions that are offered by <code>LuaBase</code> are identical to their Lua counterparts.
These ones aren't documented here. Please consult the Lua 5.0.2 manual for information
on these functions. The following documentation only covers the functions that behave
differently than their Lua counterparts or are Hollywood-specific additions.

<p>
Please note that many Lua functions jump directly into Hollywood's error handler
in case something goes wrong. For example, functions like <code>luaL_checklstring()</code>,
<code>luaL_checktable()</code>, or <code>luaL_checknumber()</code> will never return control to you if
something goes wrong. They will always jump into Hollywood's error handler
directly using the <code>longjmp()</code> API. Thus, you need take some care when it comes
to managing resources that have been allocated by your function because you often
do not get the chance to free them if an error occurs because the Lua functions
jump directly into Hollywood's error handler. You need to find another way of
making sure that resources get freed in case of an error as well so that you
don't leak any memory.

<p>
<code>LuaBase</code> is available since Hollywood 5.0.

<p>
Note that <code>LuaBase</code> is not available in Hollywood Designer.
