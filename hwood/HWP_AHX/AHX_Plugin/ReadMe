ahx.hwp
=======

This plugin allows Hollywood to load and play AHX and HivelyTracker modules.
It is based on HVL2WAV 1.2 by Xeron/IRIS. See http://www.hivelytracker.co.uk/
for more information.

Once this plugin is installed, OpenMusic() will "automagically" be able to open
AHX and HivelyTracker modules. You can also query the number of subsongs in
a module by using GetAttribute() with #MUSIC and #ATTRNUMSUBSONGS. Individual
subsongs can be played using PlaySubsong().

This plugin also exports one command, namely: ahx.SetPlayingTime(). This
function can be used to set the duration of the music in milliseconds. By
default this is set to 60*1000*10, i.e. 10 minutes. This function is necessary
because the plugin currently doesn't offer any end-of-song detection.

A demo applet is also included. You can run this applet using the freely
available Hollywood Player.
