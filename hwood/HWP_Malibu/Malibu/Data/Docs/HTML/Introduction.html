<h2 class="heading">1.1 Introduction</h2>

<p>
Malibu is a plugin for Hollywood which contains an import filter for
Scala presentations made with the classic Scala software for Amiga
computers. As soon as Malibu is installed, Hollywood will
suddenly be able to show those Scala presentations or compile them.

<p>
With Malibu it is now possible to run those Scala presentations without
the actual classic Amiga hardware. Because the whole emulation runs on
top of Hollywood's multimedia application layer you can run Scala
presentations on every platform supported by Hollywood. In many cases the
quality of the pictures that Malibu displays is much better than the original
Scala quality because Scala often had to remap many pictures with very
different colors to a 8-bit display which resulted in a massive loss of color
information. With Malibu, however, all graphics are shown in true colour.

<p>
Malibu emulates nearly the whole Scala command set and supports all
Scala versions from 1.0 up to Scala InfoChannel 500 which was the last Amiga
version of Scala. Emulation is done by the El Capitan microkernel which
tries to achieve the best performance possible on the system used. For
example, the next page is already calculated while the current page is on
the display. Complex transition effects can also be pre-calculated and then
displayed smoothly.

<p>
Scala is a program which helped the Amiga to become a real Multimedia
wonder. There were no products for a long long time that could beat an Amiga
with Scala. Therefore Scala was widely used in all different production fields,
from movies and television to big shows. Everyone who has worked with Scala
knows what powers it has. But this power is only possible because Scala is
very hard-coded to the Amiga's custom chips which leads to the problem that
it does not run on modern Amiga systems or other platforms. For many years all
sorts of users complained that there was no Scala that runs RTG compatible. This
time is over now. Malibu revives Scala in a completely system-friendly way.

<p>
Here is a quick overview of the features of Malibu:
