<h2 class="heading">2.4 Emulation settings</h2>

<p>
On AmigaOS and compatibles, Malibu comes with a settings program that allows
you to fine-tune the Scala emulation. You can start the settings program from
the Plugins menu in the Hollywood GUI or from Workbench. The settings program
will write your settings to the file <code>malibu.ini</code>. On AmigaOS and compatibles
this file is stored in the same directory as the main <code>malibu.hwp</code> executable.
On the other platforms, the <code>malibu.ini</code> is stored in the following locations:

<p>
<ul class="toc">
<li>&ndash;&nbsp;Windows: Malibu will look for <code>malibu.ini</code> in the directory
%APPDATA%/AirsoftSoftwair/Hollywood/Preferences, e.g. C:/Users/andreas/AppData/Roaming/AirsoftSoftwair/Hollywood/Preferences.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;macOS: Malibu will look for <code>malibu.ini</code> in the directory
~/Library/Application Support/AirsoftSoftwair/Hollywood/Preferences.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Linux: Malibu will look for <code>malibu.ini</code> in the directory
~/.hollywood-mal/preferences
</li></ul>

<p>
Since Malibu comes with a dedicated settings program only on AmigaOS, you have
to edit <code>malibu.ini</code> directly if you want to configure emulation options
on non-Amiga platforms. To do that, just create a file named <code>malibu.ini</code>
in the correct location (see above) and add the desired options to it. Below, all
options that can be configured in the settings program on AmigaOS and compatibles
are described. At the end of the description of each option, you will find the key
to set in the <code>malibu.ini</code> settings file so that you can enable or disable
certain options by manually editing <code>malibu.ini</code>. For example, to enable
script looping you would add the following line to <code>malibu.ini</code>:

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>Loop script=True
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

The following things can be configured:

<p>
<h3>Emulation options:</h3>

<p>
<ul class="toc">
<li>&ndash;&nbsp;Loop script: If you check this box, every Scala script you start
will be looped when it reaches the end. The key for this setting is
<b>Loop script</b>. Defaults to <code>True</code>.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Emulate pause commands at page end: Most Scala scripts have pause
commands at the end of each page. If you check this box, they will
be emulated. Unless you have a very fast Amiga, you do not need
to check this box because Malibu will start preparing the next
page automatically when it reaches the end of a page. And this takes
mostly longer than the original pause command. So you should only
check this box if you have a very fast Amiga and scripts run too
fast. The key for this option is <b>Emulate pause end</b>. Defaults to <code>True</code>.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Emulate pause commands during page: If you check this box, pause
commands that occur during a page is displayed, will be emulated.
It is recommended that you check this box. The key for this option is
<b>Emulate pause page</b>. Defaults to <code>True</code>.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Emulate pause accurately: If this option is activated, Malibu
will try to emulate Scala's pause commands as accurately as possible.
Enabling this option can lead to timing problems because Hollywood's
transition effects aren't exactly as long as Scala's wipes. That's
why it is turned off by default. The key for this option is <b>Accurate pause</b>.
Defaults to <code>False</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>
<h3>Animation options:</h3>

<p>
<ul class="toc">
<li>&ndash;&nbsp;Play animations: If you check this box, animations will be played.
Please note that you should also select &quot;Play animations from disk&quot;
because animations require a lot of memory especially because
they all have to be converted to 24-bit, e.g. a 640x480 animation
in 16 colors with 100 frames would take up around 90 megabyte if
loaded into memory (!!). Therefore you should really also select
&quot;Play animations from disk&quot;. The key for this option is <b>Play anims</b>.
Defaults to <code>True</code>.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Play animations from disk: If you check this box, Malibu will play
all animations directly from disk. This is a bit slower but saves
a lot of memory. Recommended. The key for this option is <b>Play anims from disk</b>.
Defaults to <code>True</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>
<h3>Transition effect options:</h3>

<p>
<ul class="toc">
<li>&ndash;&nbsp;Picture transition speed: This combo box allows you to specify
a speed setting that will be used for all picture transitions. The
key for this option is <b>BGPic FX speed</b>. A value of 0 means slow,
1 means normal, and 2 means fast. Defaults to 1.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Default picture transition: Hollywood does not support all Scala
transition effects. The transition you choose here will be
displayed when Malibu cannot find an equal Hollywood transition
for the required Scala transition. The default setting for this
is 'random transition'. The key for this option is <b>Default BGPic FX</b>.
It must be set to the integer value of a Hollywood transition effect
increased by one. To use a random effect, set it to 0 which is also
the default.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Object transition speed: This combo box allows you to specify
a speed setting that will be used for all object transitions. The
key for this option is <b>Object FX speed</b>. A value of 0 means slow,
1 means normal, and 2 means fast. Defaults to 1.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Default object transition: This is the same as 'default picture
transition' except that the transition effect you specify here
will be used for object transitions. The key for this option is <b>Default object FX</b>.
It must be set to the integer value of a Hollywood transition effect
increased by one. To use a random effect, set it to 0 which is also
the default.
</li></ul>

<p>
<h3>Export options:</h3>

<p>
<ul class="toc">
<li>&ndash;&nbsp;Save script to: If you enter the name of a filename here, Malibu
will automatically save a copy of the Scala script that has been converted
to a Hollywood script here. This allows you to make some manual modifications
in the script. The key for this option is <b>Save script</b>. Defaults to
the empty string which means that Malibu shouldn't save the Hollywood
script it generated from the input Scala script.
</li></ul>

<p>
<h3>Miscellaneous options:</h3>

<p>
<ul class="toc">
<li>&ndash;&nbsp;Enable quit with ESC: If you check this box, you will be able
to quit any time by pressing the escape key (useful in full
screen mode when the window has no close gadget). The key for
this option is <b>Enable escape quit</b>. Defaults to <code>True</code>.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Show busy pointer when working: If you check this box, Malibu
will indicate its busy state by showing the busy pointer. On slower
systems it can be useful to check this box. The key for this option
is <b>Show busy pointer</b>. Defaults to <code>False</code>.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Hide pointer all the time: Check this box if you do not want
the pointer visible at all. Useful for presentations. The key
for this option is <b>Hide pointer</b>. Defaults to <code>False</code>.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Allow relative paths: Scala always uses absolute path definitions
for external data. This has the drawback, that scripts do not
run on other systems without modifications because every file
name is addressed absolutely, e.g. <code>dh0:Apps/Scala/Scripts/Demo.iff</code>.
If you check this box, Malibu will first look if the file is
present in the current directory and load it from there. Otherwise
it will try the full path. The key for this option is <b>Try relative path</b>.
Defaults to <code>True</code>.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Substitute Intellifonts: If this option is selected, Malibu
will replace all Intellifonts with a default font. This can be
useful if you're running Malibu on a system which doesn't support
Compugraphic Intellifonts (such as Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux).
The key for this option is <b>Replace intelli fonts</b>. It defaults
to <code>True</code> on non-Amiga systems and to <code>False</code> on Amiga systems.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Never fail because of missing fonts: If you select this
option, Malibu will automatically substitute missing fonts.
It's not recommended to set this option because if you do you
won't be notified about missing fonts and so you don't have a
chance to find and install those fonts. So this option is
really only useful for temporary testing purposes. The key for this
option is <b>Never fail on fonts</b>. Defaults to <code>False</code>.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Emulate font antialiasing: Select this option to enable
font antialiasing. Note that this isn't a true vector-based
antialiasing but just an approximation based on blurring so
it doesn't look too good. That's why it is disabled by default.
The key for this option is <b>Emulate antialias</b>. Defaults to
<code>False</code>.
</li></ul>
