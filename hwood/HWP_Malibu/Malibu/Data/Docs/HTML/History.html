    Please read the history bottom-up. Note that the history might list some
    features that were implemented in beta versions and removed later but are
    still mentioned here. This history is a log of the programmer so that he
    can look up what has been done/tried/modified. Things that were implemented
    and removed later are marked with [VOID].

    Version 1.5:   (08-Oct-24)

    - Change: Updated documentation and preferences program
    - Change: Malibu requires at least Hollywood 8.0 now
    - New [macOS]: Added support for the macOS arm64 platform (&quot;Apple Silicon&quot;)
    - Change [Non-Amiga]: The configuration file &quot;malibu.ini&quot; must no longer be stored in the same
      directory as the malibu.hwp binary; instead, it must be stored in Hollywood's preferences directory
      (see the manual for more information on the location); this allows Malibu to permanently store
      Amiga assigns in its *.ini file; previously, saving assigns was often not possible because Malibu
      couldn't write to its *.ini file because it was stored in a protected system directory; by storing
      malibu.ini in the central prefs directory this isn't a problem anymore
    - Fix [Windows]: Scala scripts can also be started from the Windows IDE now (reported by Thomas
      Windsor)
    - Fix: IF commands after BUTTON weren't handled correctly; now grindercowboy's Adventure 2 remake
      works correctly with Malibu as well
    - Fix: Syntax error in script when using the default font topaz
    - Fix [Windows]: Malibu couldn't open scripts in paths that used non-ASCII characters

    Version 1.4:   (04-Nov-17)

    - Change: Updated documentation and preferences program
    - Change: Migrated the documentation to the new MetaDoc format; this allows me to easily export 
      the documentation as PDF, HTML, and CHM
    - Change: Removed personalization code because Malibu is going to be released as Freeware now  
    - New: Ported Malibu to the 64-bit architecture for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X
    - New: Added support for Linux and Mac OS X
    - New [Prefs]: Added &quot;Never fail because of missing fonts&quot; option; if this activated, Malibu
      will always substitute missing fonts; it's not recommended to use this option because you
      won't be notified about any possible font substitutions so the script will look wrong and
      you won't know which fonts are actually missing
    - New [Prefs]: #FADETOBLACK can be selected now; since this is not a real transition effect,
      it uses the special value of 141 and is then mapped to #FADE with #BLACK as the optional
      argument (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Prefs]: Some transition effects still used Hollywood 1.x style IDs
    - Change [Prefs]: Transition effects are alphabetically sorted now (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - Change: Improved emulation of Scala's nuclear wipe (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix: Malibu played sounds after showing the slide's transition effect while Scala plays sounds
      before starting a slide's transition effect (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - New: Scaling bitmap fonts is now supported too 
    - Change: Removed FPS limit and frameskip options as they are no longer supported by Hollywood
    - Change: Text antialias emulation is now disabled by default because it doesn't look very good
    - Change: Speed emulation for fade and push effect is more accurate now (reported by Michael Rupp)  
    - New: Added &quot;Save script&quot; option; if this is set, Malibu will save a copy of the Hollywood
      script to this location so that you can manually apply some tweaks or study it; note
      that Malibu still generates Hollywood 1.x-style code (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix: Shadow and edge effect didn't work for brushes (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix: Text was sometimes cut off on the left side (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix: Font size wasn't correctly handled for antialiasing mode 5 (reported by Michael Rupp)

    Version 1.3:   (23-Feb-12)

    - New: Antialiased text now supported; actually, this is just a fake antialiasing using
      a Gaussian blur algorithm on raster graphics; you can turn it off using the
      &quot;Emulate antialias&quot; prefs tag
    - Fix: Error when text object used many tabs
    - Fix: [ and ] are now escaped correctly
    - Change: Scala's SET and IF commands no longer require ARexx; this is important for
      Windows and MorphOS users because those systems do not have ARexx
    - New: Added &quot;Font search path &lt;n&gt;&quot; option; this allows you to extend the search
      paths for fonts; this must be used in case the fonts required by a Scala script
      aren't in the same drawer as the script itself; on Amiga systems, you can simply
      extend the FONTS: assign instead but on all other platforms you must use this new
      option instead (or copy the fonts manually to the script's drawer)
    - New: The Win32 version of Malibu will automatically substitute intelli fonts because
      Hollywood can't load them on this platform; to change this behaviour, set the option
      &quot;Replace intelli fonts&quot; to 0
    - New: Added Win32 build of Malibu; as Scala scripts use absolute path specifications
      (e.g. dh0:Pics/pic.iff) the Windows version of Malibu will prompt you to select
      PC equivalents to the path specifications that are used in the Scala script; these
      mappings of Amiga to PC paths can also be saved permanently so that you do not have
      to choose them every time you want to run a Scala script
    - New: Added AROS version
    - Change: Preferences file uses a new format now and is stored in LIBS:Hollywood too
    - Change: Adapted Malibu to work with the new Hollywood 5 plugin interface; Malibu
      must now be installed into LIBS:Hollywood; the old plugin directory Hollywood:Plugins
      is no longer used

    Version 1.2:   (29-Mar-08)

    - Change: Updated documentation and preferences program
    - Change: MorphOS version does not use animation.datatype any longer for IFF ANIMs
    - Fix: Running Scala scripts from a Scala script did not work because the command
      line specification changed with Hollywood 3.0
    - Fix: OpenFile() explicitly uses #MODE_WRITE and #MODE_READ now (required since
      Hollywood 2.5)
    - Change: Minor code optimization and reorganization; migrating everything from
      Hollywood 1.x code to 2.0 style code still remains to be done and is quite a lot
      of work as far as I can see
    - Change: FPS limit is disabled by default
    - Fix: Using TextWidth() for calculating the width of a string was not enough; now
      TextExtent() is used (table return value MaxX specifies the maximum extent); this
      bug was visible mostly with italic text only
    - Fix: Wrong fps limit was installed after PlayAnimDisk(); this bug was not noticed
      because Hollywood 2.0 did not feature fps limits any more but in 3.0 this feature
      is back which caused some trouble
    - Fix: Animation palette was still accessed after its memory had been freed
    - Fix: &quot;:&quot; is no longer used to separate between multiple commands on a single line
      (conflicts with the new method based OO capabilities of Hollywood 3.1)

    Version 1.11:  (11-Mar-05)

    - Change: Updated documentation and preferences program
    - New: Added PPC native version for AmigaOS4

    Version 1.1:   (27-Jun-04)

    - Change: Updated preferences program and documentation
    - Change: Added some more compatibility patches for older Scala versions
    - New: Speed specifications for effects are interpreted now
    - Fix: Floating point pause times are interpreted correctly now
    - Fix: Two memory leaks
    - Fix: The EXECUTE command was not emulated at all
    - Fix: Various issues with Scala buttons &amp; navigation
    - Fix: Text wipe &quot;cut&quot; (meaning no wipe!) was interpreted as a random wipe
    - Fix: Pause commands after gfx commands were not always handled correctly
    - Change: General code optimization and Hollywood 1.9 adaption; Malibu
    - is faster now
    - Change: Text outline (&quot;edge&quot;) looks better now with big outlines
    - Fix: Tabulator settings did not always work correctly (especially when
      the text had a shadow)
    - Fix: When margins were off, right and centered alignments did not work
    - New: Many Scala effects are displayed correctly now because Hollywood 1.9
      has a lot of new effects and most of them are also present in Scala
    - New: Curved fly-ons are now supported!
    - Change: Removed support for precalculation as it is no longer supported
      in Hollywood 1.9

    Version 1.0   (20-Jun-03)
    - First Release
