zip.hwp 2.0
===========

This plugin allows Hollywood scripts to read and write zip archives. It uses
Hollywood's file and directory adapter plugin interfaces which allow you to
iterate through zip archives as if they were normal directories. Files within
zip archives can also be accessed as if the zip archive was a normal directory.
It is not necessary to unpack a file stored in a zip archive to a temporary
file before it can be opened. Hollywood's file adapter plugin interface allows
direct streaming from the zip archive into the respective file handler.

Additionally, zip.hwp offers a range of functions to read, modify, and write
zip archives. New zip archives can be created, existing zip archives can be
opened and modified. There is a variety of functions which allows you to read,
change, and write attributes of files stored in zip archives. On top of that,
zip.hwp also supports reading and storing password-protected files with strong
AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 encryption.

Starting with version 2.0, zip.hwp also supports some new features of Hollywood
10 like the capability to treat zip archives like file systems which means that
you can also use Hollywood functions like DeleteFile() or Rename() directly on
files or directories inside zip archives.
