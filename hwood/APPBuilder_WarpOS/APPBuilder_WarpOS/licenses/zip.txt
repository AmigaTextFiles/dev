zip.hwp 1.2
===========

This plugin allows Hollywood scripts to read and write zip archives. It uses
Hollywood 6.0's new file and directory adapter plugin interfaces which allow
you to iterate through zip archives as if they were normal directories. Files
within zip archives can also be accessed as if the zip archive was a normal
directory. It is not necessary to unpack a file stored in a zip archive to a
temporary file before it can be opened. Hollywood 6.0's file adapter plugin
interface allows direct streaming from the zip archive into the respective
file handler.

Additionally, zip.hwp offers a range of functions to read, modify, and write
zip archives. New zip archives can be created, existing zip archives can be
opened and modified. There is a variety of functions which allows you to read,
change, and write attributes of files stored in zip archives. On top of that,
zip.hwp also supports reading and storing password-protected files with strong
AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 encryption.
