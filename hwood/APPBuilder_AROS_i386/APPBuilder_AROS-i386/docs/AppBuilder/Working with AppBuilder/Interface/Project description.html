     <h1>Project description</h1>

    <p>In the top right section you can find some string fields where you can
      select the main source code and you can describe the project, let's see
      all available fields:</p>
    <figure class="image image-style-align-center">
      <img src="Project%20description/image.png">
    </figure>
    <p>- <strong>PROJECT NAME</strong> : Type here your project's name
      <br>- <strong>MAIN SOURCE</strong> : Type or select with “…” button the main
      soruce code of your application
      <br>- <strong>EXECUTABLE NAME </strong>: This field is used to define the executable's
      name, but actually has two purposes
      <br>&nbsp; - The path of the selected file will be used as build folder
      <br>&nbsp; - The file name will be used as the executable file name, for Windows
      executables the .exe suffix will be added automatically.
      <br>- <strong>.INFO ICON</strong> : For Amiga-like targets you can also select
      an .info icon that will be copied along with the executable.
      <br>- <strong>NOTES </strong>: A multi-line text field where you can write
      your personal notes about the project.</p>
