xlsx.hwp 1.0
============

The XLSX plugin allows you to conveniently read and write XLSX documents from
Hollywood scripts. It offers a wide variety of functions to set and get cell
values, cell types, cell formulas, document/worksheet properties and several
other attributes. It also offers an iterator function for a high performance
iteration of a large number of cells. 

On top of that, the XLSX plugin also supports Hollywood's serialization
interface which means that you can conveniently serialize Hollywood tables to
XLSX documents by just a single call to Hollywood's SerializeTable() function.
In the same manner you can also deserialize whole XLSX documents into Hollywood
tables by a single call to Hollywood's DeserializeTable() function. It just
doesn't get any easier!
