xmp.hwp
=======

This plugin allows Hollywood to load and play all tracker module formats that
are supported by the Extended Module Player library (XMP) by Claudio Matsuoka
and Hipolito Carraro Jr. For example FastTracker II, ScreamTracker, OctaMED,
The Player, NoisePacker, ProRunner, Oktalyzer, Impulse Tracker, Ultra Tracker,
Ice Tracker, Liquid Tracker, Quadra Composer, and many more.

Once this plugin is installed, OpenMusic() will "automagically" be able to open
all tracker modules supported by libxmp. 

This plugin exports only one command, namely: xmp.SetPlayingTime(). This
function can be used to set the duration of the music in milliseconds. By
default this is set to 60*1000*10, i.e. 10 minutes. This function is necessary
because the plugin currently doesn't offer any end-of-song detection.

A demo applet is also included. You can run this applet using the freely
available Hollywood Player.
