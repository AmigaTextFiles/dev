xml.hwp 2.0
===========

The XML plugin allows Hollywood scripts to parse XML files easily and
efficiently enabling you to make use of this extremely flexible universal
markup language that can be used for so many different purposes. The
plugin offers a powerful library interface that allows you to access all
kinds of data in XML documents like nodes, attributes, namespaces, entities,
attlists, CDATA and more.

On top of that, the XML plugin also supports Hollywood's serialization
interface which means that you can conveniently serialize Hollywood tables
to XML documents by just a single call to Hollywood's SerializeTable() function.
In the same manner you can also deserialize whole XML documents into Hollywood
tables by a single call to Hollywood's DeserializeTable() function. It just
doesn't get any easier!
