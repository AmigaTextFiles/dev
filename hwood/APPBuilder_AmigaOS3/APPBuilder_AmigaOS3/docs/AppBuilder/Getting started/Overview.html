     <h1>Overview</h1>

    <p>First of all, thank you very much for trying AppBuilder, I'm an Hollywood
      developer and this program has been created with and for Hollywood, the
      cross-compiling multimedia language developed by Andreas Falkenhahn.</p>
    <p>Everytime I had to build my applications with Hollywood it was a pain
      for me to manage and remember all the files, and the plugins I had to include
      in the application bundle for each platform I wanted to target, so I started
      to develop this application called APPBuilder to help me to put the needed
      files in the right build for every platform I wanted to target.</p>
    <p>The main purpose of APPBuilder is to simplify the build process taking
      care of additional files and plugins for each targeted platform with the
      option to pack all the included stuff into a zipped archive.</p>
    <p>Once you have defined your application project, with a single click of
      a button, you will be able to build the application.</p>
    <p>After working on your code you can load the previously saved project and
      click the build button and all boring stuff like including readme, copying
      the resources data and the right plugin for the appropriate platform will
      became an old story.</p>
    <p>APPBuilder will manage for you also the MacOSX application boundles copying
      your application data in the right folders.</p>
    <p>APPBuilder is incredibly useful if you develop often for multiple targets
      at the same time: this program can save you a lot of time and the possibility
      to put the needed plugins in the wrong folder.</p>
