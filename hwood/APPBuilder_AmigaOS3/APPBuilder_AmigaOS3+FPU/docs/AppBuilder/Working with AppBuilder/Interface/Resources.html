    <p>Your application may need resource files like images, sounds, databases,
      that are needed at runtime, data that you have to provide in your distribution
      packages.</p>
    <p>For example, suppose you are developing a game that needs the following
      resources:
      <br><code>C:/Development/MyGame/Graphics/</code>
      <br><code>C:/Development/MyGame/Sounds/</code>
      <br><code>C:/Development/MyGame/Maps/</code>
      <br><code>C:/Development/MyGame/levels.dat</code>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With a manual build process you have to copy the folders <code>Graphics</code>, <code>Sounds</code> and <code>Maps</code>,
      along with the file <code>levels.dat</code> where your executable has been
      created. This must be done for every platform you wish to distribute for.</p>
    <p>This section can help you a lot to accomplish this task because you have
      to tell AppBuilder what to include in your distribution and at build time
      the program will take care of copying the contents in the right position,
      including for MacOS application boundles.</p>
    <p>As you can see, at the bottom of this area, you have three buttons you
      can use to <strong>add files</strong>, to <strong>add folders</strong> and
      to <strong>remove entries</strong> into/from the resources list.</p>
