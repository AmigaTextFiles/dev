    <p>In this section you can select/deselect the plugins that your application
      needs, they will be automatically copied in the build folder for the right
      platform.</p>
    <p>If you are used to develop application for all Hollywood supported platforms
      you know the pain when you need to prepare the distribution packages, copying
      the right plugin for the right platform by hand could lead to errors, it's
      the main reason I have built this application :)</p>
    <p>This section is made to make this step a joke:
      <br>All available plugins are listed here, if you have selected a plugin not
      available for a certain target platform you will be alerted during the
      build process with a requester, but the building process will not be interrupted.</p>
    <p>Just selected the plugin your application uses and at build time they
      will be copied into the appropriate folder.</p>
    <p>Note that some plugins that requires more complex handling than a simple
      copy has not been included.</p>
