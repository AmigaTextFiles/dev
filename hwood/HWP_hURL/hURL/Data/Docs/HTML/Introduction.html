<p>
hURL is a plugin for Hollywood that allows you to transfer data using many different protocols.
Based on curl, hURL supports an incredibly wide range of transfer protocols, e.g. DICT, FILE,
FTP, FTPS, Gopher, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB,
SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, Telnet and TFTP. Furthermore, hURL supports SSL certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT,
FTP uploading, HTTP form based upload, proxies, HTTP/2, cookies, user+password authentication (Basic,
Plain, Digest, CRAM-MD5, NTLM, Negotiate and Kerberos), file transfer resume, proxy tunneling and more.
It really is the ultimate data transfer engine for Hollywood, leaving nothing to be desired.

<p>
There are two ways of using hURL: There is a high-level interface that can directly hook itself
into Hollywood's network library, enhancing it with hURL functionality like SSL/TLS support. This makes
it possible to use Hollywood commands like <code>DownloadFile()</code> to download files using custom protocols
that Hollywood itself doesn't support, e.g. SSL/TLS.

<p>
Another way of using hURL is the low-level interface: This interface allows you to access the
curl API directly from Hollywood scripts. This is extremely powerful because it allows you
to access hundreds of different curl options, making it possible to fine-tune hURL to your
specific needs. hURL contains over 500 commands to fulfil all your data transfer needs!

<p>
Finally, hURL comes with extensive documentation in various formats like PDF, HTML, AmigaGuide,
and CHM that contains detailed descriptions about all functions and methods offered by the plugin.

<p>
All of this makes hURL the ultimate data transfer tool for Hollywood that contains everything
you need to send and receive data via almost any transfer protocol on the planet.
