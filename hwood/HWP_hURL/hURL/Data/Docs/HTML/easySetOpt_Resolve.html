Pass a table containing a list of strings with host name resolve information
to use for requests with this handle.

<p>
Each single name resolve string should be written using the format
HOST:PORT:ADDRESS[,ADDRESS]... where HOST is the name libcurl will try
to resolve, PORT is the port number of the service where libcurl wants
to connect to the HOST and ADDRESS is one or more numerical IP
addresses. If you specify multiple ip addresses they need to be
separated by comma. If libcurl is built to support IPv6, each of the
ADDRESS entries can of course be either IPv4 or IPv6 style addressing.

<p>
This option effectively pre-populates the DNS cache with entries for the
host+port pair so redirects and everything that operations against the
HOST+PORT will instead use your provided ADDRESS. Addresses get with
<code>#CURLOPT_RESOLVE</code> will not time-out from the DNS cache like ordinary
entries.

<p>
If the DNS cache already have an entry for the given host+port pair, then
this entry will be removed and a new entry will be created. This is because
old entry may have have different addresses or be ordinary entries with
time-outs.

<p>
The provided ADDRESS get by this option will be used even if
<code>#CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE</code> is get to make libcurl use another IP version.

<p>
Remove names from the DNS cache again, to stop providing these fake resolves,
by including a string in the list that uses the format
&quot;-HOST:PORT&quot;. The host name must be prefixed with a dash, and the host name
and port number must exactly match what was already added previously.

<p>
Support for providing the ADDRESS within [brackets] was added in 7.57.0.

<p>
Support for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was added in 7.59.0.
