     <h1>Your first project</h1>

    <p>Let's see how you cas use AppBuilder application to manage (and build)
      a project.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First of all you have to create an Hollywood script</li>
      <li>Open AppBuilder and click CLEAN button to clean-up all fields</li>
      <li>Fill all the top-right text fields describing your project
        <ul>
          <li>Insert the application name</li>
          <li>Locate the main source with the [...] button or type the path in dedicated
            field</li>
          <li>Locate the place where the project should be build, you can use executable
            name field in two ways:
            <ul>
              <li>Type in the text field the executable name without any path, doing so
                the project will be built in the APPBuilder folder.</li>
              <li>Type in (or locate with the [...] button) the path and the name of the
                executable name, doing so the application will be built in the path specified
                and the file name will be used as executable name, remember that the .exe
                extension for Windows executables will be added automatically.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Locate an info file if you are compiling for Amiga-like systems, you can
            use any file name because it will be copied in the build path and renamed
            with the appropriate executable name (optional).</li>
          <li>If you want you can write a short description in the notes field.</li>
          <li>Push down the switches to select the platform targets</li>
          <li>Push down the switches to select the plugins need by your application,
            if any</li>
          <li>Add any data file and/or folders used as resources by your application</li>
          <li>Add any data file and/or folders used as external data</li>
          <li>Chose if the executable must be compiled using the -compress flag to produce
            a reduced in size executable (switch COMPRESS)</li>
          <li>Chose if you want to pack each platform builds into a single zipped archive
            (switch PACK)</li>
          <li>Hit SAVE or SAVE AS button to save this project if you plan to build again
            your just created project</li>
          <li>Hit the BUILD button and wait for the process to be completed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>During the building process you will see a window showing the build progress
      and, depending on your 7zip version, a window showing the packing progress.</p>
    <p>You can also get some messages while building, for example if you are
      trying to use a plugin that is not available for a specific target a requester
      will warn you about this problem but the build process will not be stopped
      to allow all your selected targets to be built despite the one having problems.</p>
    <p>Once you have updated your Hollywood program and are you ready to compile
      a new version just launch AppBuilder, LOAD your previously saved project,
      adjust it adding/removing resources, externale data, plugins, and so on...
      SAVE it and BUILD.</p>
    <p>You will became more productive using this tool and you will reduce the
      risk of leaving out of the package plugins or application data, or even
      worst to distribute your application with a plugin for the wrong target
      platform.</p>
    <p>That's all!</p>
    <p>I hope this tool will help you to be more productive, to avoid mistakes
      and to love Hollywood as much as I do :D</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
