     <h1>Interface</h1>

    <p>AppBuilder uses a simple interface that allow you to have all under your
      control and into a single place, what you see in the main interface is
      what you have at your fingertips to build your applications.</p>
    <figure
    class="image image-style-align-center">
      <img src="First%20run/image.png">
      </figure>
      <p>
        <br>&nbsp;The above image shows the application main window, as you can see
        the interface is splitted into sections.</p>
      <p>In the left side we have 3 groups : the top group is used to manage your
        project, the middle one is used to set/unset compile switches (saved with
        your project) and the bottom one holds the configuration button we have
        seen earlier and some other button not related with the project.</p>
      <p>The right side is used to setup your project, to select for which platform(s)
        you want to build your app and what plugin(s) you want to include in your
        distribution package.</p>
      <p>The "App Resources" and “External Data” groups allow you to include files
        &amp; folders to your distribution package, but we will talk about them
        later.</p>
