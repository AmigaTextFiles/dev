     <h1>Build process</h1>

    <p>When you have setup a project to build, or you have loaded a previously
      created one with the LOAD button you can hit the BUILD button to build
      your application.</p>
    <p>A compiled folder structure will look like the following graph:</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">[ build folder ]
    +--- [ build date and time ]
            +--- [ platform name ]
            |       +-- [ external data ]
            |           [ application folder ]
            |              +--- [ application executable ]
            |                   [ application resources ]
            |                   [ plugins ]
            +--- [ platform name ]
            ...</code></pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What you have seen above is the default build structure, MacOS application
      boundles have another structure listed below:</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">[ build folder ]
    +--- [ build date and time ]
              +--- [ platform name ]
              |       +--- [ application folder ]
              |               +--- [ external data ]
              |                    [ application boundle ]
              |                       +--- [ Contents ]
              |                               +--- [ MacOS ]
              |                               |       +--- [ plugins ]
              |                               |            [ application executable ]
              |                               +--- [ Resources ]
              |                                       +--- [ application resources ]
              +--- [ platform name ]
              ...</code></pre>
    <p>Zipped archives will preserve these structures and will be created in
      the <code>&lt;build_folder&gt;/&lt;build_date_and_time&gt;</code> folder
      with this name template:
      <br><code>&lt;executable_name&gt;_(&lt;platform_name&gt;).zip</code>
    </p>
