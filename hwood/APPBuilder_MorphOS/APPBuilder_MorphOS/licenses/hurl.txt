hURL 1.2
========

hURL is a plugin for Hollywood that allows you to transfer data using many
different protocols. Based on curl, hURL supports an incredibly wide range
of transfer protocols, e.g. DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, Gopher, HTTP, HTTPS,
IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS,
SMTP, SMTPS, Telnet and TFTP. Furthermore, hURL supports SSL certificates,
HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading, HTTP form based upload, proxies, HTTP/2,
cookies, user+password authentication (Basic, Plain, Digest, CRAM-MD5, NTLM,
Negotiate and Kerberos), file transfer resume, proxy tunneling and more. It
really is the ultimate data transfer engine for Hollywood, leaving nothing
to be desired.

There are two ways of using hURL: There is a high-level interface that can
directly hook itself into Hollywood's network library, enhancing it with
hURL functionality like SSL/TLS support. This makes it possible to use
Hollywood commands like "DownloadFile()" to download files using custom
protocols that Hollywood itself doesn't support, e.g. SSL/TLS.

Another way of using hURL is the low-level interface: This interface allows
you to access the curl API directly from Hollywood scripts. This is
extremely powerful because it allows you to access hundreds of different
curl options, making it possible to fine-tune hURL to your specific needs.
hURL contains over 500 commands to fulfil all your data transfer needs!

Finally, hURL comes with extensive documentation in various formats like
PDF, HTML, AmigaGuide, and CHM that contains detailed descriptions about all
functions and methods offered by the plugin.

All of this makes hURL the ultimate data transfer tool for Hollywood that
contains everything you need to send and receive data via almost any
transfer protocol on the planet.
