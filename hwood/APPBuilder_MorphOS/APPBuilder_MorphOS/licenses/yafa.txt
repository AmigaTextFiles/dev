This plugin allows you to load and play IFF YAFA anims (created by Wildfire)
with Hollywood. This makes it possible for the first time to view these cool
animations on NG Amiga, Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and Android systems without
the need to use an emulator!

All known IFF YAFA formats are supported including the undocumented hi-
and true colour extensions introduced in Wildfire 7. Here are some features:

* support for planar, chunky, 15bit, and 24bit YAFA anims
* support for byte, word, and longword delta compression
* HAM6 and HAM8 modes fully supported
* anims that use a dynamic palette are supported
* support for timestamped anims
* native decompressor for XPK FAST, NUKE, and RAKE packed anims;
  xpkmaster.library is not necessary!
