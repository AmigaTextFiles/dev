sid.hwp
=======

This plugin allows Hollywood to load and play SID files. It is based on TinySID
by Tammo Hinrichs and Rainer Sinsch. 

Once this plugin is installed, OpenMusic() will "automagically" be able to open
SID music files. You can also query the number of subsongs in a SID file by using
GetAttribute() with #MUSIC and #ATTRNUMSUBSONGS. Individual subsongs can be played
using PlaySubsong().

This plugin also exports one command, namely: sid.SetPlayingTime(). This
function can be used to set the duration of the music in milliseconds. By
default this is set to 60*1000*10, i.e. 10 minutes. This function is necessary
because the plugin currently doesn't offer any end-of-song detection.

A demo applet is also included. You can run this applet using the freely
available Hollywood Player.
