svgimage.hwp
============

This plugin enables Hollywood to load SVG and SVGZ images. After this plugin has
been installed, Hollywood will 'automagically' be able to open SVG images. When
you use LoadBrush() on an SVG image, this plugin will create a vector brush for
you. This means that you can transform it using ScaleBrush(), RotateBrush(), and
TransformBrush() without any losses in quality. In case layers are enabled and
you display a vector brush using DisplayBrush(), the layer graphics can also be
transformed without any quality loss. The same as true for BGPics using vector
graphics.

Please note that svgimage.hwp will always create images with alpha channel by
default. If you don't want that, you have to manually delete the alpha channel
using DeleteAlphaChannel() after loading the image. In case you want to use
an SVG image as a BGPic, you can also work around this problem by defining a
background for this BGPic, e.g. like this:

@BGPIC 1, "test.svg", {FillStyle = #FILLCOLOR, FillColor = #WHITE}
