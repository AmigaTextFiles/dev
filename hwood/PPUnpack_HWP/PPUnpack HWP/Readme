PPUnpacker.hwp - Hollywood plugin to handle powerpacked files

This plugin enables reading files that compressed with PowerPacker by Nico Francois (popular classic 68k Amiga file cruncher of the 90's).

Adds the following functions:
 pp.IsPacked -- checks wheter the file is packed with PowerPacker
 pp.UnpackFile -- unpack a file to a new file
 pp.ReadText -- reads a text file wheter it is packed or not

Only OS4 binary is delivered by me, but full source is included.
This work is based on Mark Espie's ppunpack 1.0 sources from 1995.
 
Installation:
 Copy libs/Hollywood/ppunpack.hwp to libs:HollyWood/

For usage information please consult the doc.guide file.
