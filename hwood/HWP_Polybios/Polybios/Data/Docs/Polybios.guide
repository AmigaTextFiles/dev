@NODE Introduction "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Introduction@{ub}

    Polybios is a plugin for Hollywood that allows you to easily create PDF
    documents from Hollywood scripts. On top of that, Polybios can also open
    existing PDF documents and convert their pages into Hollywood brushes. In
    fact, when converting PDF pages into Hollywood brushes, Polybios will create
    vector brushes for you which can be scaled, rotated and transformed without
    any losses in quality (unless bitmap graphics are embedded inside the PDF
    document of course).

    Polybios comes with over 200 functions for creating PDF documents of all
    sorts. It supports graphics primitives, text in different encodings
    including Unicode, embedding fonts as well as images and Hollywood brushes
    inside PDF documents. On top of that Polybios supports the creation of
    password-protected PDF documents, encrypted PDF documents, compression, file
    attachments, annotations, extended graphics states, info dictionaries, RGB,
    CMYK and gray color spaces, different viewing modes, transition effects,
    links, and permission flags for PDF documents. Transformation of PDF objects
    is fully supported too. Finally, Polybios can also create PDF documents with
    an easy-to-navigate outline that can be used as a table of contents as well.

    Polybios also has support for extracting text from PDF pages, getting all
    bookmarks in a document, handling links on PDF pages, and it is also
    possible to search pages. Furthermore, Polybios allows you to query the
    position of text on PDF pages, making it possible to implement text marking
    functionality, for instance.

    Polybios comes with extensive documentation in various formats like PDF (of
    course), HTML, AmigaGuide, and CHM that contains detailed descriptions about
    all functions and methods offered by the plugin. On top of that, over 25
    example scripts are included in the distribution archive to get you started
    really quickly.

    All of this makes Polybios the ultimate PDF tool for Hollywood that contains
    everything to empower you to make history in PDF!

@NODE Requirements "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Requirements@{ub}

    - Hollywood 7.1 or better
    - on macOS, Polybios requires at least 10.9 on x86 and x64 systems and 10.5
      on PowerPC systems
    - on Android, at least version 5.0 is required
    - if you use WinUAE, you need at least WinUAE 4.2.1 or Polybios can crash
      because of a bug in WinUAE's 68020 emulation

@ENDNODE

@NODE Installation "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Installation@{ub}

    Installing Polybios is straightforward and simple: Just copy the file
    polybios.hwp for the platform of your choice to Hollywood's plugins
    directory. On all systems except on AmigaOS and compatibles, plugins must be
    stored in a directory named Plugins that is in the same directory as the
    main Hollywood program. On AmigaOS and compatible systems, plugins must be
    installed to LIBS:Hollywood instead. On macOS, the Plugins directory must be
    inside the Resources directory of the application bundle, i.e. inside the
    HollywoodInterpreter.app/Contents/Resources directory. Note that
    HollywoodInterpreter.app is stored inside the Hollywood.app application
    bundle itself, namely in Hollywood.app/Contents/Resources.

    Afterwards merge the contents of the Examples folder with the Examples
    folder that is part of your Hollywood installation. All Polybios examples
    will then appear in Hollywood's GUI and you can launch and view them
    conveniently from the Hollywood GUI or IDE.

    On Windows you should also copy the file Polybios.chm to the Docs directory
    of your Hollywood installation. Then you will be able to get online help by
    pressing F1 when the cursor is over a Polybios function in the Hollywood
    IDE.

    On Linux and macOS copy the Polybios directory that is inside the Docs
    directory of the Polybios distribution archive to the Docs directory of your
    Hollywood installation. Note that on macOS the Docs directory is within the
    Hollywood.app application bundle, i.e. in
    Hollywood.app/Contents/Resources/Docs.

@NODE FAQ "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Frequently asked questions@{ub}

    This section covers some frequently asked questions. Please read them first
    before asking on the mailing list or forum because your problem might have
    been covered here.

    @{b}Q: @{ub}@{b}How @{ub}@{b}can @{ub}@{b}I @{ub}@{b}modify @{ub}@{b}existing @{ub}@{b}PDF @{ub}@{b}documents?@{ub}

    A: That's currently not supported but planned for a future version of
    Polybios.


    @{b}Q: @{ub}@{b}Why @{ub}@{b}doesn't @{ub}@{b}Polybios @{ub}@{b}support @{ub}@{b}the @{ub}@{b}conversion @{ub}@{b}of @{ub}@{b}PDF @{ub}@{b}pages @{ub}@{b}to @{ub}@{b}vector@{ub}
    @{b}brushes @{ub}@{b}on @{ub}@{b}AROS?@{ub}

    A: That's because PDFium requires a compiler capable of handling C++11 and
    wide characters which is currently unavailable for AROS. But this will
    hopefully change in the future so that AROS users can convert PDF pages into
    Hollywood brushes too.


    @{b}Q: @{ub}@{b}Why @{ub}@{b}aren't @{ub}@{b}Chinese/Japanese/Korean @{ub}@{b}(CJK) @{ub}@{b}characters @{ub}@{b}drawn @{ub}@{b}correctly @{ub}@{b}in @{ub}@{b}my@{ub}
    @{b}document?@{ub}

    A: Make sure you have a TrueType font that has CJK support installed. For
    example, install Konatu on your system and CJK characters should be drawn
    correctly.


    @{b}Q: @{ub}@{b}The @{ub}@{b}68k @{ub}@{b}version @{ub}@{b}of @{ub}@{b}Polybios @{ub}@{b}doesn't @{ub}@{b}work @{ub}@{b}under @{ub}@{b}OS4 @{ub}@{b}emulation.@{ub}

    A: It seems that the OS4 JIT has problems dealing with Polybios' PDF
    renderer which is a 5 MB binary. If you really want to use the 68k version
    of Polybios on OS4, you need to disable JIT for the file
    LIBS:Hollywood/Polybios.ext. Then it should work.


    @{b}Q: @{ub}@{b}Is @{ub}@{b}there @{ub}@{b}a @{ub}@{b}Hollywood @{ub}@{b}forum @{ub}@{b}where @{ub}@{b}I @{ub}@{b}can @{ub}@{b}get @{ub}@{b}in @{ub}@{b}touch @{ub}@{b}with @{ub}@{b}other @{ub}@{b}users?@{ub}

    A: Yes, please check out the "Community" section of the official Hollywood
    Portal online at http://www.hollywood-mal.com.


    @{b}Q: @{ub}@{b}Where @{ub}@{b}can @{ub}@{b}I @{ub}@{b}ask @{ub}@{b}for @{ub}@{b}help?@{ub}

    Please read the history bottom-up. Note that the history might list some
    features that were implemented in beta versions and removed later but are
    still mentioned here. This history is a log of the programmer so that he
    can look up what has been done/tried/modified. Things that were implemented
    and removed later are marked with [VOID].

    Version 1.3   (05-Dec-20)
    - Change: Updated documentation
    - Change: Amiga installer will now also copy the plugins for all platforms to Hollywood's linker plugins
      directory so that they can be easily linked to executables (suggested by kas1e)
    - Fix: pdf.GetPageLen() and pdf.GetText() didn't skip potential control characters in the text correctly
      (reported by Petteri Valli)
    - Fix: doc:SaveToFile() wasn't compatible with virtual files (reported by Jean Holzammer)
    - New: When loading PDFs as animations using \@ANIM or LoadAnim(), Polybios will create vector animations
      now if a Hollywood version that supports vector animations is installed; if you don't want that, pass
      TRUE in the new "NoVectorAnim" tag to \@REQUIRE
    - New: Polybios supports Hollywood Designer 5 now; note that it won't be loaded automatically because
      of its size; you need to manually tell Designer to load it in Designer's settings
      
    Version 1.2   (11-Aug-19)
    - Change: Updated documentation
    - Fix: pdf.GetLastError() will now return #PDFERR_SUCCESS (0) in case pdf.OpenDocument() succeeded
      (reported by Petteri Valli)
    - New: Added pdf.GetMediaBox() to get a page's media box and pdf.GetCropBox() to get a page's crop box
    - New: Added pdf.PageToDevice() function and pdf.DeviceToPage(); these can be used to convert coordinates
      from page to device space and vice versa
    - Fix: pdf.GetPageLinks() and its counterpart in pdf.GetBrush() didn't parse all page links correctly
      (reported by Petteri Valli)
    - Fix: pdf.GetBookmarks() didn't make sure that there was enough stack space for the bookmark table
      (reported by Petteri Valli)
       
    Version 1.1   (21-Jun-19)
    - Change: Updated documentation
    - Change [Examples]: PDF Viewer example supports password-protected PDFs now
    - New [Amiga]: Added "KillExt" tool to distribution archive; this can be used to flush Polybios.ext
      from memory; Polybios keeps this in memory for performance reasons but it will require about 6 MB
      of memory; only ever use KillExt if all resources used by Polybios.ext have been released first
    - Fix [Amiga]: Automatic platform selector in installer didn't work correctly
    - Fix [Amiga]: ".." and "." weren't handled correctly in filename specifications
    - New [Amiga]: Added version string to Polybios.ext
    - New: Added new attributes for GetAttribute(): #PDFATTRVERSION returns the document's PDF version
      and #PDFATTRPERMISSIONS returns its permissions
    - New: Added pdf.GetLastError(); this can be called if pdf.OpenDocument() fails to get extended error
      information; if it returns #PDFERR_PASSWORD, the document couldn't be opened because it's password
      protected
    - New: Added pdf.GetPageLabel() which can be used to get labels from PDF pages
    - New: Added pdf.GetMetaText() which can be used to get meta-data from a PDF document
    - New: Added pdf.GetBookmarks() function; this will return a table containing all bookmarks used by
      the PDF document as well as their targets; the table returned by this function is similar to the one
      returned by pdf.GetPageLinks(), except that bookmarks can be nested
    - New: Added the following functions for searching PDF pages for text: pdf.FindStart(), pdf.FindNext(),
      pdf.FindPrev(), pdf.GetFindResult()
    - New: Added the following functions to deal with text on a page: pdf.GetPageLen(), pdf.GetText(),
      pdf.GetCharBox(), pdf.GetCharOrigin(), pdf.GetCharIndexAtPos(), pdf.GetRects(), pdf.GetBoundedText();
      these functions can be used to retrieve text from a PDF page as well as its position
    - New: Added pdf.GetPageLinks() function; this will return a table containing all links in a page and
      their targets
    - New: Added pdf.LoadPage() and pdf.FreePage() for fine-tuned control over page loading; also added
      pdf.GetBrushFromPage() for getting brushes from pages loaded using pdf.LoadPage()
    - New: Added pdf.IsPDF() function; this can be used to check if the specified file is a PDF document
      (requested by Petteri Valli)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Polybios didn't exit cleanly when opened by hosts that use a pre-Hollywood 6.0 plugin
      interface (e.g. Hollywood Designer or executables compiled by Hollywood < 6.0) (reported by Petteri
      Valli)
    - New: Added optional argument to pdf.GetBrush(); if this is set to TRUE, pdf.GetBrush() will return
      an additional table that contains a collection of all links in the page; the table will contain
      information about the position, type, and target of each link in the page (requested by Petteri Valli)
    - Change [68k]: Recompiled with Bebbo's latest gcc 6 for 68k; WinUAE users note that you'll need at
      least WinUAE 4.2.1 for Polybios now because older versions had a bug in the 68020 emulation which can
      make Polybios crash
    - Fix [BigEndian]: Password-protected PDFs couldn't be opened on big endian architectures because of
      an endian issue in the encryption key generator in PDFium; this will also fix some other non-password
      protected PDFs; when will people learn to write endian-independent code? (reported by Petteri Valli)
    - Fix: pdf.GetBrush() trashed memory when the destination brush was a brush created by pdf.GetBrush()
      (reported by Petteri Valli)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Polybios.ext couldn't be correctly loaded from a path with spaces (e.g. "RAM Disk:")
      (reported by Frank Mariak)
     
    Version 1.0a  (28-Jun-18)
    - No version bump to 1.1 because only the Amiga versions have been changed and I'm too lazy
      to re-compile all other platforms just for an updated version string
    - Fix [Amiga]: pdf.OpenDocument() didn't work with filenames with non-ASCII characters
      (reported by Rafal Chyla)
    - New [OS3]: Added 68881/2 FPU build of Polybios; especially the PDF renderer is a lot
      faster when using the FPU version
    - New [OS3]: The AmigaOS 3.x version of Polybios supports PDF rendering now; thanks a lot
      to Stefan "Bebbo" Franke for his work on gcc 6.4 for m68k which made this possible!;
      NB: if you intend to use the 68k version on OS4 (which doesn't really make sense, but
      anyhow), you have to turn off the JIT for LIBS:Hollywood/Polybios.ext because with JIT
      Petunia seems to be stuck in an endless loop; on MorphOS the 68k PDF renderer won't
      work either but this looks like a bug in MorphOS' 68k emulation to me; on WinUAE it
      works fine
     
    Version 1.0   (21-Apr-18)
    - First Release
@ENDNODE

@NODE ViewingOverview "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    There are two different methods of viewing PDF documents with Polybios in
    Hollywood: You can either load individual PDF pages as vector brushes or you
    can load an entire PDF document as a Hollywood animation in which the
    document's pages are simply mapped to individual anim frames. Whatever way
    you choose, Polybios will always map PDF pages to vector objects in
    Hollywood so that they can be scaled, rotated, and transformed without any
    losses in quality.

    To use Polybios from your Hollywood script, you first need to initialize the
    plugin at the beginning of your script by using the following line:

        \@REQUIRE "polybios"

    There are also some additional arguments that you can pass to the
    "\@REQUIRE" preprocessor command. The following arguments are currently
    available:

    NoVectorAnim:
              When loading PDFs as Hollywood anims, Polybios will automatically
              create vector animations if the Hollywood version used with
              Polybios supports it. If you don't want that, set this tag to
              TRUE. Note that if you set this tag to TRUE, there will be quality
              losses when scaling or transforming the animation that contains
              the PDF pages. Defaults to FALSE. (V1.3)

@ENDNODE

@NODE PageAsVectorBrush "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Loading pages as vector brushes@{ub}

    To load PDF pages as vector brushes you have to open the PDF document using
    the @{"pdf.OpenDocument()" LINK pdfOpenDocument} function and then convert the desired pages to
    Hollywood vector brushes using the @{"pdf.GetBrush()" LINK pdfGetBrush} command.

    Here is an example:

        pdf.OpenDocument(1, "test.pdf")
        pdf.GetBrush(1, 1, 1)
        DisplayBrush(1, #CENTER, #CENTER)
        FreeBrush(1)
        pdf.CloseDocument(1)

    The code above will open the PDF document named test.pdf and convert its
    first page to a vector brush. It will then show this vector brush in the
    center of the display. Note that the vector brush will still depend on the
    PDF document so it is not allowed to call @{"pdf.CloseDocument()" LINK pdfCloseDocument} on the
    document while you still need the brush. That's why we free the brush first
    and close the document afterwards. Otherwise there will be an error.

    You can find out the number of pages in the PDF document by first getting
    the object type for PDF documents and then using Hollywood's
    "GetAttribute()" function, like so:

        PDF_DOCUMENT = pdf.GetObjectType()
        numpages = GetAttribute(PDF_DOCUMENT, 1, #PDFATTRPAGES)

    The code above gets the number of pages from the PDF document that uses the
    identifier 1 and stores it in the variable "numpages".

@ENDNODE

@NODE PageAsAnims "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Loading PDFs as anims@{ub}

    Alternatively, Polybios offers to load an entire PDF document into a
    Hollywood anim object. You can then access the individual pages by simply
    obtaining the anim's frames.

    Here's how to load a PDF document as a Hollywood anim:

        LoadAnim(1, "test.pdf", {FromDisk = True})
        For Local k = 1 To GetAttribute(#ANIM, 1, #ATTRNUMFRAMES)
           DisplayAnimFrame(1, #CENTER, #CENTER, k)
           WaitLeftMouse
        Next

    The code above shows all pages of a PDF document. You need to press the left
    mouse button to skip to the next page.

    Note that we set "FromDisk" tag to True in our "LoadAnim()" call. This is
    very important because otherwise all PDF pages will be loaded and buffered
    in memory which can be a huge waste with larger PDF documents.

    Of course, you could also load the PDF document with the \@ANIM preprocessor
    command instead of "LoadAnim()".

@NODE CoordinateSystem "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Coordinate system@{ub}

    Note that PDF documents use a different coordinate system than Hollywood. In
    the default coordinate system of PDF, shown below, the lower-left corner is
    at coordinates (0, 0), and the upper-right corner is at coordinates (width,
    height). The default resolution is 72dpi. In Hollywood the upper-left corner
    is at (0, 0).

    See image: @{"coordinates.png" LINK "Guide/coordinates.png/MAIN"}

    An application can change the coordinate system by invoking @{"page:Concat()" LINK pageConcat}.
    For example, if an application invokes page:Concat(0.5, 0, 0, 0.5, 100, 100)
    in the default state, the coordinate system shown above is transformed to
    the new system shown in the figure below:

    See image: @{"coordinates2.png" LINK "Guide/coordinates2.png/MAIN"}

@ENDNODE

@NODE GraphicsMode "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Graphics mode@{ub}

    In Polybios, each page object maintains a flag named "graphics mode". The
    graphics mode corresponds to the graphics object of the PDF specification.

    The graphics mode is changed by invoking particular functions. The functions
    that can be invoked are decided by the value of the graphics mode.

    The following figure shows the relationships of the graphics mode.

    See image: @{"gmode.png" LINK "Guide/gmode.png/MAIN"}

@NODE PathPainting "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Painting paths@{ub}

    A path is composed of straight and curved line segments. Paths define shapes
    and regions.

    Vector graphics are drawn by the following steps:

    1. Set graphics states (such as line width, dash pattern, color...) using
       graphics state operators or color operators.
    2. Start new path using @{"page:MoveTo()" LINK pageMoveTo}, @{"page:Rectangle()" LINK pageRectangle}, @{"page:Arc()" LINK pageArc}, or
       @{"page:Circle()" LINK pageCircle}.
    3. Append to path using path construction operators.
    4. Stroke or paint the path using path painting operators.

    Here is a list of graphics state operators:

        page:Concat()
        page:SetDash()
        page:SetFlat()
        page:SetLineCap()
        page:SetLineJoin()
        page:SetLineWidth()
        page:SetMiterLimit()

    Here is a list of color operators:

        page:SetCMYKFill()
        page:SetCMYKStroke()
        page:SetGrayFill()
        page:SetGrayStroke()
        page:SetRGBFill()
        page:SetRGBStroke()

    Here is a list of path construction operators:

        page:Arc()
        page:Circle()
        page:CurveTo()
        page:CurveTo2()
        page:CurveTo3()
        page:LineTo()
        page:MoveTo()
        page:Rectangle()

    Here is a list of path painting operators:

@NODE TextPainting "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Painting text@{ub}

    Text is drawn by the following steps:

    1. Start drawing text by invoking @{"page:BeginText()" LINK pageBeginText}.
    2. Set text states (such as font, filling color...) using text state
       operators or color operators. At least @{"page:SetFontAndSize()" LINK pageSetFontAndSize} must be
       invoked once before invoking text painting operators.
    3. Set text positioning by invoking text positioning operators.
    4. Show text by invoking text painting operators.
    5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 if necessary.
    6. Finish drawing text by invoking @{"page:EndText()" LINK pageEndText}.

    The figure below explains text positioning:

    See image: @{"textpos.png" LINK "Guide/textpos.png/MAIN"}

    You can see that, in contrast to Hollywood's coordinate system, the PDF
    document's coordinate system for placing text starts at the bottom and
    extends upwards.

    Here is a list of text state operators:

        page:SetCharSpace()
        page:SetFontAndSize()
        page:SetHorizontalScaling()
        page:SetTextLeading()
        page:SetTextRenderingMode()
        page:SetTextRise()
        page:SetWordSpace()

    Here is a list of text positioning operators:

        page:MoveTextPos()
        page:SetTextMatrix()

    Here is a list of text painting operators:

        page:ShowText()
        page:ShowTextNextLine()
        page:TextOut()
        page:TextRect()

@NODE Colors "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Colors@{ub}

    Colors are specified using three real numbers (i.e. ones with a decimal
    point) in the form R G B where each number defines the amount of red (R),
    green (G) and blue (B) in a color. The valid numbers are from 0.0 to 1.0

@NODE FontTypes "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Font types@{ub}

    There are several types of fonts available in Polybios.

    Base14 font:
              The built-in font of PDF. Available in all viewer applications.

    Type1 font:
              A font format used by PostScript.

    TrueType font:
              Widely used outline font format.

    CID font: Font format for multi-byte characters. Developed by Adobe.

    Hollywood scripts can use @{"doc:GetFont()" LINK docGetFont} to get a font handle. Before that,
    one of the following functions must be used to load the font before invoking
    @{"doc:GetFont()" LINK docGetFont} : (except for Base14 fonts, those are always available and
    needn't be loaded)

        HPDF_LoadType1FontFromFile()
        HPDF_LoadTTFontFromFile()
        HPDF_LoadTTFontFromFile2()
        HPDF_UseCNSFonts()
        HPDF_UseCNTFonts()
        HPDF_UseJPFonts()
        HPDF_UseKRFonts()

@ENDNODE

@NODE Base14Fonts "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Base14 fonts@{ub}

    Base14 fonts are built into PDF and all viewer applications can display
    these fonts. An application can get a Base14 font handle any time by
    invoking @{"doc:GetFont()" LINK docGetFont}. PDF files which use base14 fonts are smaller than
    those which use other type of fonts. Moreover, PDF processing is faster
    because there is no need to load external fonts. However, Base14 fonts are
    only able to display the Latin-1 character set. To use other character sets,
    an application must use other fonts.

    The following are built-in Base14 fonts. They are available in every PDF
    viewer:

        Courier
        Courier-Bold
        Courier-Oblique
        Courier-BoldOblique
        Helvetica
        Helvetica-Bold
        Helvetica-Oblique
        Helvetica-BoldOblique
        Times-Roman
        Times-Bold
        Times-Italic
        Times-BoldItalic
        Symbol
        ZapfDingbats

@ENDNODE

@NODE Type1Fonts "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Type1 fonts@{ub}

    Type1 is a format of outline fonts developed by Adobe. An AFM file is
    necessary to use an external Type1 font with Polybios. When a Hollywood
    script uses an external Type1 font, it has to invoke @{"doc:LoadType1Font()" LINK docLoadType1Font}
    before invoking @{"doc:GetFont()" LINK docGetFont}. The return value of @{"doc:LoadType1Font()" LINK docLoadType1Font} is
    used as the font name parameter of @{"doc:GetFont()" LINK docGetFont}. If a PFA/PFB file is
    specified when invoking @{"doc:LoadType1Font()" LINK docLoadType1Font}, the glyph data of the font is
    embedded into the PDF file. Otherwise, only metrics data in AFM file is
    embedded.

    Here is an example:

        fontname = doc:LoadType1Font("a010013l.afm", "a010013l.pfb")
        hfont = doc:GetFont(fontname, "CP1250")
        page:SetFontAndSize(hfont, 10.5)

@ENDNODE

@NODE TTFonts "Polybios Guide"
@{b}TrueType fonts@{ub}

    Polybios can use TrueType fonts. There are two types of TrueType fonts: The
    first format, which uses the ".ttf" extension, contains only one font in its
    file. The second format, which uses the ".ttc" extension, contains multiple
    fonts in its file. That is why @{"doc:LoadTTFont()" LINK docLoadTTFont} has a parameter which is
    used to specify the index of the font to load. If the additional parameter
    "embedding" is set to True when invoking @{"doc:LoadTTFont()" LINK docLoadTTFont}, the subset of
    the font is embedded into the PDF file. If not, only the marix data is
    stored in the PDF file. In this case a viewer application may use an
    alternative font if it cannot find the font.

    Here is an example:

        fontname = doc:LoadTTFont("arial.ttf", True)
        hfont = doc:GetFont(fontname, "CP1250")
        page:SetFontAndSize(hfont, 10.5)

    Note that Polybios can use only TrueType fonts which have a Unicode cmap and
    one of the following tables: "OS/2", "cmap", "cvt ", "fpgm", "glyf", "head",
    "hhea", "hmtx", "loca", "maxp", "name", "post", "prep".

@ENDNODE

@NODE CIDFonts "Polybios Guide"
@{b}CID fonts@{ub}

    CID fonts are a multi-byte character font format developed by Adobe. Two
    simplified Chinese fonts, one traditional Chinese fonts, four Japanese
    fonts, and four Korean fonts are available in Polybios. Hollywood scripts
    have to invoke the following functions once before using CID fonts:

    doc:UseCNSFonts()
              Makes simplified Chinese fonts (SimSun, SimHei) become available.

    doc:UseCNTFonts()
              Makes traditional Chinese fonts (MingLiU) become available.

    doc:UseJPFonts()
              Makes Japanese fonts (MS-Mincyo, MS-Gothic, MS-PMincyo,
              MS-PGothic) become available.

    doc:UseKRFonts()
              Makes Korean fonts (Batang, Dotum, BatangChe, DotumChe) become
              available.

    Here is an example:

        doc:UseJPFonts()
        doc:UseJPEncodings()

@NODE Tutorial "Polybios Guide"
@{b}Tutorial@{ub}

    This tutorial will teach you how to create your first PDF document with
    Polybios. The PDF document will contain two pages, one with a circle and one
    with a "Hello World" text.

    First, you need to create a document object. This is done by calling
    @{"pdf.CreateDocument()" LINK pdfCreateDocument} which creates a document object for you. The document
    object handle which is returned by @{"pdf.CreateDocument()" LINK pdfCreateDocument} is then used in the
    following steps.

        doc = pdf.CreateDocument()

    As a second step you can set some document attributes. For example, here we
    set compression, encryption, page mode, and a password:

        ; set compression mode
        doc:SetCompressionMode(#HPDF_COMP_ALL)

        ; set page mode to use outlines
        doc:SetPageMode(#HPDF_PAGE_MODE_USE_OUTLINE)

        ; set password
        doc:SetPassword("owner", "user")

    After setting document attributes call @{"doc:AddPage()" LINK docAddPage} to add a page to the
    document. The page handle returned is used in later operations on the page.

        page1 = doc:AddPage()

    To insert a new page before an existing page, @{"doc:InsertPage()" LINK docInsertPage}. For
    example, to insert "page0" before "page1", do the following:

        page0 = doc:InsertPage(page1)

    After creating a new page, you can set some page attributes if necessary.
    Here we set the page size to B5 and the orientation to landscape:

        page1:SetSize(#HPDF_PAGE_SIZE_B5, #HPDF_PAGE_LANDSCAPE)

    Now that we have set up everything we can start adding content to the page.
    For example, this is how we add a "Hello World" text to the page:

        font = doc:GetFont("Times-Roman")
        page0:SetFontAndSize(font, 24)
        page0:BeginText()
        page0:TextOut(60, 60, "Hello World!")
        page0:EndText()

    We can also draw graphics primitives to the page, for example a filled
    circle:

        page1:SetRGBFill(1.0, 0, 0)
        page1:MoveTo(100, 100)
        page1:LineTo(100, 180)
        page1:Circle(100, 100, 80)
        page1:Fill()

    When you're done adding content to your pages, you'll probably want to save
    the PDF document to disk. This is possible by using the @{"doc:SaveToFile()" LINK docSaveToFile}
    function. Here is how to save our PDF document:

        doc:SaveToFile("test.pdf")

    Now that we are finished, we have to free all resources belonging to the
    document object. This is done by calling the @{"doc:Free()" LINK docFree} method, like so:

        doc:Free()

    Note that now that we have freed the document and all of its resources, we
    must no longer use any handles belonging to this document. In our case this
    means that we must no longer access the following handles: "doc", "page0",
    "page1", and "font". Thus, it is a good idea to set them to Nil so that
    Hollywood's garbage collector can kill them:

        doc = Nil
        page0 = Nil
        page1 = Nil
        font = Nil

    Of course, you can also declare them as local variables and then they will
    be eaten by the garbage collector automatically once they become
    inaccessible.

    That's it, congratulations, you have just created your first PDF document
    with Polybios!

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        x, y = pdf.DeviceToPage(id, page, startx, starty, sizex, sizey, rotate,
                   devicex, devicey)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to convert the screen coordinates of the point
        specified by "devicex" and "devicey" to page coordinates.

        The "rotate" argument can be used to specify the page orientation. This
        can be set to the following special values:

        0:        Normal.
        1:        Rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
        2:        Rotated 180 degrees.
        3:        Rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

        The page to use must be specified in the "page" argument. It must be a
        number in the range of 1 to the total number of pages in the document
        and the page must have been previously loaded using @{"pdf.LoadPage()" LINK pdfLoadPage}. The
        PDF document specified by "id" must have been previously opened using
        @{"pdf.OpenDocument()" LINK pdfOpenDocument}.

        The page coordinate system has its origin at the left-bottom corner of
        the page, with the X-axis on the bottom going to the right, and the
        Y-axis on the left side going up. Note that this coordinate system can
        be altered when you zoom, scroll, or rotate a page, however, a point on
        the page should always have the same coordinate values in the page
        coordinate system.

        The device coordinate system is device dependent. For screen devices,
        its origin is at the left-top corner of the window.

        pdf.FindStart(id, page, s$[, flags, idx])

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to start a new search operation on the page
        specified by "page" in the document specified by "id". You have to pass
        the string that the page should be searched for in the "s$" argument.
        The optional argument "flags" can be used to configure additional
        options for the search operation. The "flags" parameter can be a
        combination of the following special constants:

        #PDFFIND_MATCHCASE:
                  If this flag is set, the search operation will be done in a
                  case-sensitive way.

        #PDFFIND_MATCHWHOLEWORD:
                  If this flag is set, a search result is only triggered if "s$"
                  matches a whole word.

        By default, the search operation starts at the beginning of the page.
        You can change this by passing a character index to start the search at
        in the optional "idx" parameter. Note that character indices start at 0.
        Passing -1 in the "idx" parameter will start the search at the end of
        the page.

        The page to use must be specified in the "page" argument. It must be a
        number in the range of 1 to the total number of pages in the document
        and the page must have been previously loaded using @{"pdf.LoadPage()" LINK pdfLoadPage} with
        the "text" argument set to TRUE. The PDF document specified by "id" must
        have been previously opened using @{"pdf.OpenDocument()" LINK pdfOpenDocument}.

        After you have called pdf.FindStart() to initiate the search operation,
        you then have to call either @{"pdf.FindNext()" LINK pdfFindNext} or @{"pdf.FindPrev()" LINK pdfFindPrev} to
        actually execute the search operation.

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        [id, t] = pdf.GetBrush(id, page, brid[, transparent, getlinks])

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to convert a page from the PDF document
        specified by "id" to a vector brush using the identifier "brid". If you
        pass Nil in "brid", pdf.GetBrush() will automatically choose a vacant
        identifier and return it.

        The page to convert must be specified in the "page" argument. It must be
        a number in the range of 1 to the total number of pages in the document.
        The PDF document specified by "id" must have been opened using
        @{"pdf.OpenDocument()" LINK pdfOpenDocument}.

        The optional parameter "transparent" allows you to specify whether you'd
        like the page background to be transparent or white. If you pass True
        here, you'll get a vector brush in which the page background is
        completely transparent by using alpha channel transparency. Otherwise
        the page background will be white and your vector brush won't use any
        transparency.

        Note that the vector brush will still depend on the PDF document so it
        is not allowed to call @{"pdf.CloseDocument()" LINK pdfCloseDocument} on the document while you
        still need the brush.

        Also note that you should only use this function for pages that haven't
        been loaded with @{"pdf.LoadPage()" LINK pdfLoadPage} before. If you want to convert a page
        that has been loaded using @{"pdf.LoadPage()" LINK pdfLoadPage} to a brush, use the
        @{"pdf.GetBrushFromPage()" LINK pdfGetBrushFromPage} function instead. See @{"pdf.GetBrushFromPage" LINK pdfGetBrushFromPage} for
        details.

        Starting with Polybios 1.1, there is an optional argument called
        "getlinks". If this is set to TRUE, pdf.GetBrush() will return a table
        containing all links in the page. The table is returned as the second
        return value if "getlinks" is set to TRUE. For each entry, the table
        will have the following fields initialized:

        Action:   This field specifies what should happen if the respective link
                  is clicked. This will be set to one of the following special
                  constants:

                  #PDFACTION_GOTO:
                            Skip to page in current document.
                  #PDFACTION_REMOTEGOTO:
                            Skip to page in another document.

                            Launch a program.
                  #PDFACTION_UNSUPPORTED:
                            Unknown action.

        Target:   This will be set to the link's target. Depending on "Action",
                  this may be set to a page number, a URI, or the path to an
                  external file.

        Left:     Left edge of the link's bounding rectangle.

        Top:      Top edge of the link's bounding rectangle.

        Right:    Right edge of the link's bounding rectangle.

        The page coordinate system has its origin at the left-bottom corner of
        the page, with the X-axis on the bottom going to the right, and the
        Y-axis on the left side going up. Note that this coordinate system can
        be altered when you zoom, scroll, or rotate a page, however, a point on
        the page should always have the same coordinate values in the page

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        doc:CreateImageFromBrush() creates an image from the Hollywood brush
        specified by "id". The image will always use the RGB color space, i.e.
        #HPDF_CS_DEVICE_RGB.

        The optional argument "table" can be used to configure further options:

        UseJPEG:  If this parameter is set to True, the image will be compressed
                  using the JPEG file format. You can use the "Quality" field to
                  set the compression level. If "UseJPEG" is set to False, the
                  image won't be compressed, but you can use
                  @{"doc:SetCompressionMode()" LINK docSetCompressionMode} to activate compression for image
                  data, although this won't be as good as JPEG. Defaults to
                  False.

        Quality:  Here you can specify a value between 0 and 100 indicating the
                  compression quality for the JPEG format. A value of 100 means
                  best quality, 0 means worst quality. Defaults to 90 which
                  means pretty good quality.

        When doc:CreateImageFromBrush() succeeds, it returns the handle of an
        image object. Otherwise, it returns Nil and the error handler is called.

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        doc:CreateImageFromMem() creates an image from raw pixel data in memory.
        The "data" argument must be a memory pointer obtained via Hollywood's

        conversion so it is usually faster than the other functions. "bpc"
        specifies the bit size of each color component and can be either 1, 2,
        4, or 8.

        The "colorspace" argument must be one of #HPDF_CS_DEVICE_GRAY,
        #HPDF_CS_DEVICE_RGB, or #HPDF_CS_DEVICE_CMYK. See @{"doc:LoadRawImage" LINK docLoadRawImage} for
        details.

        doc:LoadFont() loads a font using Hollywood and registers it in the
        document object. If the optional "embed" argument is set to True, the
        glyph data of the font is embedded, otherwise only the matrix data is
        included in the PDF file.

        Note that only TrueType fonts can be used with this method. You cannot
        use bitmap fonts in PDF documents.

        The optional arguments "weight" and "slant" can be used to specify a
        font weight and slant. The following can be passed in the "weight"
        parameter:

            #FONTWEIGHT_THIN

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        doc:LoadPNGImage() loads an external PNG image file. The optional
        "cache" argument allows you to set whether this method should cache the
        whole PNG image in memory or not. If you need to embed a PNG image
        several times, it is faster to set this argument to True.

        Note that when embedding PNG images in a PDF, they are not embedded in
        PNG format but as raw, uncompressed pixels (although you can activate
        compression for the pixel data by calling @{"doc:SetCompressionMode()" LINK docSetCompressionMode}).
        The only image format which can be embedded directly inside PDF
        documents is JPEG. Use @{"doc:LoadJPEGImage()" LINK docLoadJPEGImage} to load a JPEG image for
        embedding in a PDF.

        When doc:LoadPNGImage() succeeds, it returns the handle of an image
        object. Otherwise, it returns Nil and the error handler is called.

   @{b}INPUTS@{ub}

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        doc:LoadRawImage() loads an image from raw pixel data stored in an
        externa file. This function loads the data without any conversion. So it
        is usually faster than the other functions. Pixels are stored line by
        line from top to bottom in the color format specified by the
        "colorspace" parameter which must be set to one of the following
        constants:

        #HPDF_CS_DEVICE_GRAY:
                  8 bit gray scale image. The gray scale color space describes
                  each pixel with one byte. For each byte, 0 is maximum dark,
                  and 255 is maximum light. The size of the image data is width
                  * height bytes.

        #HPDF_CS_DEVICE_RGB:
                  24 bit RGB color image. The 24 bit RGB color space describes
                  each pixel with three bytes (red, green, blue). For each byte,
                  0 is maximum dark, 255 maximum light. The size of the image
                  data is width * height * 3 bytes.

        #HPDF_CS_DEVICE_CMYK
                  32 bit CMYK color image. The 32 bit CMYK color space describes
                  each pixel with four bytes (cyan, magenta, yellow, black). The
                  size of the image data is width * height * 4 bytes. For each
                  byte, 0 is maximum dark, 255 maximum light.

        When doc:LoadRawImage() succeeds, it returns the handle of an image

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        In the default setting, a document object has one "Pages" object as root
        of pages. All "Page" objects are created as children of the "Pages"
        object. Since a "Pages" object can own only 8191 children objects, the
        maximum number of pages are 8191 pages. Additionally, the state that
        there are a lot of "Page" object under one "Pages" object is not good,
        because it causes performance degradation of a viewer application.

        An application can change the setting of a pages tree by invoking
        doc:SetPagesConfiguration(). If "page_per_pages" parameter is set to
        more than zero, a two-tier pages tree is created. A root "Pages" object
        can own 8191 "Pages" object, and each lower "Pages" object can own
        "page_per_pages" "Page" objects. As a result, the maximum number of
        pages becomes 8191 * page_per_pages page. An application cannot invoke
        doc:SetPagesConfiguration() after a page is added to document.

        When doc:SetPagesConfiguration() succeeds, it returns #HPDF_OK.

        painting the current path, use the function @{"page:EndPath()" LINK pageEndPath}.

        Following painting operations will only affect the regions of the page
        contained by the clipping path. Initially, the clipping path includes
        the entire page. There is no way to enlarge the current clipping path,
        or to replace the clipping path with a new one. The functions
        @{"page:GSave()" LINK pageGSave} and @{"page:GRestore()" LINK pageGRestore} may be used to save and restore the
        current graphics state, including the clipping path.

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        page:Concat() concatenates the page's current transformation matrix and
        the specified matrix.

        For example, if you want to rotate the coordinate system of the page by
        45 degrees, use page:Concat() as follows:

            Local rad1 = 45 / 180 * #PI
            page:Concat(Cos(rad1),Sin(rad1),-Sin(rad1),Cos(rad1),220,350)

        To change the coordinate system of the page to 300 dpi, use
        page:Concat() as follows:

            page:Concat(72.0 / 300.0, 0, 0, 72.0 / 300.0, 0, 0)

        Invoke @{"page:GSave()" LINK pageGSave} before page:Concat(). Then the change by
        page:Concat() can be restored by invoking @{"page:GRestore()" LINK pageGRestore}.

            ; save the current graphics states
            page:GSave(page)

            ; concatenate the transformation matrix
            page:Concat(72.0 / 300.0, 0, 0, 72.0 / 300.0, 0, 0)

            ; show text on the translated coordinates
            page:BeginText()
            page:MoveTextPos(50, 100)
            page:ShowText("Text on the translated coordinates")
            page:EndText(page)

            ; restore the graphics states
            page:GRestore()

        An application can invoke @{"page:GSave()" LINK pageGSave} when the graphics mode of the
        page is in #HPDF_GMODE_PAGE_DESCRIPTION.

        Returns #HPDF_OK on success. Otherwise, returns an error code and the
        error handler is invoked.
