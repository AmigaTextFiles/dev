<p>
Polybios is a plugin for Hollywood that allows you to easily create PDF documents from Hollywood
scripts. On top of that, Polybios can also open existing PDF documents and convert their pages
into Hollywood brushes. In fact, when converting PDF pages into Hollywood brushes, Polybios will
create vector brushes for you which can be scaled, rotated and transformed without any losses
in quality (unless bitmap graphics are embedded inside the PDF document of course).

<p>
Polybios comes with over 200 functions for creating PDF documents of all sorts. It supports
graphics primitives, text in different encodings including Unicode, embedding fonts as well as
images and Hollywood brushes inside PDF documents. On top of that Polybios supports the creation
of password-protected PDF documents, encrypted PDF documents, compression, file attachments, annotations,
extended graphics states, info dictionaries, RGB, CMYK and gray color spaces, different viewing modes,
transition effects, links, and permission flags for PDF documents. Transformation of PDF objects is
fully supported too. Finally, Polybios can also create PDF documents with an easy-to-navigate outline
that can be used as a table of contents as well.

<p>
Polybios also has support for extracting text from PDF pages, getting all bookmarks in a document,
handling links on PDF pages, and it is also possible to search pages. Furthermore, Polybios allows
you to query the position of text on PDF pages, making it possible to implement text marking functionality,
for instance.

<p>
Polybios comes with extensive documentation in various formats like PDF (of course), HTML, AmigaGuide,
and CHM that contains detailed descriptions about all functions and methods offered by the plugin.
On top of that, over 25 example scripts are included in the distribution archive to get you started really
quickly.

<p>
All of this makes Polybios the ultimate PDF tool for Hollywood that contains everything to empower
you to make history in PDF!
