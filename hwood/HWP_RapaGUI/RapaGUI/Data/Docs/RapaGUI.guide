@NODE Introduction "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Introduction@{ub}

    RapaGUI is a plugin for Hollywood that allows you to easily create GUIs with
    Hollywood. You just have to define the GUI layout in an XML file which is
    converted into a full-blown GUI by RapaGUI on the fly. It just doesn't get
    any easier!

    RapaGUI's premium feature is definitely its cross-platform design. Like
    Hollywood, RapaGUI was designed as a platform-independent program.
    Therefore, it runs on a wide variety of platforms, but still, it uses
    OS-native widgets on all supported platforms to give your applications a
    truly authentic look and feel. Currently, RapaGUI is available in native
    versions for Windows, Linux (GTK2/GTK3), macOS, AmigaOS, MorphOS, AROS, and
    even for Android. With RapaGUI you just have to write your application once
    and it will automatically run on many other platforms too! This allows you
    to spend your time on the really important things, i.e. program design,
    instead of having to write backends for lots of different platforms.

    RapaGUI uses an object-oriented design composed of over 40 MOAI (Magic
    Omnigui Architecture Interface) classes. Those MOAI classes constitute the
    heart of RapaGUI. All GUI elements supported by RapaGUI (windows, widgets,
    menu bars...) are simply objects derived from those MOAI classes. By
    wrapping the diverse native OS GUI APIs into platform-independent MOAI
    classes, those classes reduce the many faces of the different OS GUI APIs
    into just a single MOAI API face, carved in stone by RapaGUI!

    RapaGUI supports all the widgets you need to create modern GUI applications,
    including multi-column listviews, treeviews, tabbed page widgets, toolbars,
    text editor widgets, menu bars, HTML views and much more. The highlight of
    RapaGUI, however, is certainly its inbuilt Hollywood MOAI class. This class
    allows dynamic embedding of complete Hollywood displays into GUIs which can
    be used to combine Hollywood's powerful multimedia functionality with
    RapaGUI's GUI abilities into one powerful application.

    RapaGUI comes with extensive documentation in various formats like PDF,
    HTML, AmigaGuide, and CHM that describes the GUI programming basics in
    detail and provides a convenient MOAI function and class reference. A
    step-by-step tutorial that guides you through your first RapaGUI program is
    also included. On top of that, many example scripts are included in the
    distribution archive, including advanced scripts like a complete video
    player which really show off the power of Hollywood and RapaGUI working
    together.

    All this makes RapaGUI the ultimate cross-platform GUI toolkit, carefully
    crafted for you sailors of the seven GUI seas! Only RapaGUI allows rapid
    cross-platform GUI development on all islands - it is the ultimate fusion of
    all the different OS GUI toolkits into one MOAI face, carved in stone for
    eternity and beyond.

@NODE History "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}History@{ub}

    Please read the history bottom-up. Note that the history might list some
    features that were implemented in beta versions and removed later but are
    still mentioned here. This history is a log of the programmer so that he
    can look up what has been done/tried/modified. Things that were implemented
    and removed later are marked with [VOID].

    Version 2.2a  (10-Sep-24)

    - Note: This release only contains updated builds for the Amiga platforms; the builds for all the other
      platforms are identical with the v2.2 release
    - Fix [Amiga]: Mouse events didn't always work correctly when using Hollywood class and potentially other
      classes (reported by Enrique Mecklenburg)
      
    Version 2.2   (24-Aug-24)

    - Change: Updated documentation
    - New [Android]: HTMLview class also supports JavaScript now (requested by Christos Tsaldaris)
    - Change [Android]: The Hollywood Player sets the "usesCleartextTraffic" tag to TRUE now in the Android
      manifest so that RapaGUI's HTMLview class can also open non-HTTPS sites (reported by Paul Bloedel)
    - New [macOS]: Added support for the macOS arm64 platform (requested by Philipp Lonke)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Hollywood class always reacted on all mouse events outside the Hollywood widget; this was
      inconsistent to the behaviour on other platforms so it has been changed to be consistent with Windows/
      macOS/Linux/Android now; if you really need the old behaviour, there's a new (undocumented) attribute
      Hollywood.Legacy [I] now; if you set this to TRUE, Hollywood widgets on Amiga will behave as in previous
      versions
    - New: Added Scrollcanvas.ScrollX [G] and Scrollcanvas.ScrollY [G] attributes; these two attributes allow
      you to get the current position of the scrollbar
    - New: Added Area.MouseLeft [N], Area.MouseRight [N], Area.MouseMiddle [N], and Area.MouseMove[N] to get
      notified about raw mouse events over widgets; currently, these attributes are only supported by Image
      and Scrollcanvas class; you can use Area.MouseCapture [ISG] to control whether the mouse should be
      captured while a button is down (requested by Sasha Pont and Yannick Buchy)
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Crash on exit when using RapaGUI in display adapter mode
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Mouse wheel events were not recognized by Hollywood class and when using the
      plugin as a display adapter (reported by Tony Canazza)
    - Fix [Windows]: The Treeview widget sometimes sent Listtree.Active notifications when the app was already
      shutting down
    - Fix [Amiga]: Removing menu items at runtime didn't always remove their shortcuts correctly (reported by
      Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Some shortcuts of dynamically added menu items triggered twice (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Change [Amiga]: The "Cmd" identifier in Menuitem.Shortcut is now also mapped to the Amiga key, just like
      the "Ctrl" identifier (suggested by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Getting Menuitem.Title for menu items that use shortcuts trashed memory and corrupted the
      menu item's title (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [OS3/OS4/AROS]: Added workaround for a bug in codesets.library < 6.22 that could cause crashes due
      to memory access faults; the workaround is only used if codesets.library older than 6.22 is installed
      (reported by Bill Borsari)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Passing "Active" as the item parameter in Treeview.GetEntry() often didn't work correctly
      (reported by Leo den Hollander)
    - Change [MorphOS]: Added a workaround for a bug in MorphOS' listtree class that caused notifications on
      Listtree.Active to return the wrong items (reported by Enrique Mecklenburg)
    - Fix: Listview.DoubleClick notification didn't set the trigger value to the active listview item
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Adding objects to a framed group within a pageview caused refresh problems
      (reported by Leo den Hollander)
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Group.Append(), Group.Prepend(), and Group.Insert() didn't handle hidden
      widgets correctly (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Windows]: Relayouting windows, e.g. when showing/hiding widgets, didn't work correctly when the
      window was in minimized state (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - New: Added Window.ToFront() and Window.ToBack() methods to move a window to the front or to the back of
      the window stack (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - New [Amiga]: Added Window.Zoom [SG] attribute; this can be used to programmatically (un)zoom a window 
      and you can also query the current zoom state; additionally, there are the new attributes Window.AltLeft,
      Window.AltTop, Window.AltWidth, and Window.AltHeight (applicability for them all is IG) that allow you
      to set the alternate dimensions and position for the window when it is in zoomed state (requested by
      Michael Rupp) 
    - New: Added Window.Move [N] attribute; you can use this attribute to get notified whenever the user moves
      a window
    - New: Added Window.Minimize [SGN] attribute; this allows you to programmatically minimize (iconify) your
      window or restore it from minimized state (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - New [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Added Window.Maximize [SGN] attribute; this allows you to programmatically
      (de)maximize a window, query the maximize state and get notified when a window is maximized
    - Fix: Instead of actual coordinates, getting Window.Left and Window.Top sometimes resulted in special
      constants like "Centered" or "Moused" being returned
    - New: The Window.Left, Window.Top, Window.Width, and Window.Height attributes can now also be set so the
      applicability of them is ISG now; note that if you set those attributes, you must always specify a
      numeric value; the special values like "Centered" are only supported at initialization time (requested
      by Valerio Giolitto and Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Dialog.ShowModal() didn't work correctly on non-RTG screen without Plananarama (reported by
      Christos Tsaldaris and Dimitris Panokostas)
    - Change [Amiga]: Scrollcanvas class drawing is more efficient now which should prevent flickering when
      the window is resized on systems that support live resizing like MorphOS and AmigaOS 4

    Version 2.1   (24-Oct-21)
    - Change: Updated documentation
    - Fix [macOS/PPC]: Setting Listviewcolumn.Hidden didn't hide the listview column (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [macOS]: Listview.DoubleClick is no longer generated for double clicks on the listview header when
      in dataview mode (reported by Dave C.)
    - Fix: Dynamically adding and removing widgets from scrollgroups didn't work; note that when adding new
      widgets to a scrollgroup, you need to pass the scrollgroup as the parent to moai.CreateObject()
      (reported by Sasha Pont)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Dialog.EndModal() led to a memory leak when called from the event handler of one of the
      dialog's children, e.g. a button (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Change [Amiga]: For consistency with the other platforms, underline shortcuts are also supported for Text
      class on Amiga systems now (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Sliders couldn't be controlled via keyboard shortcuts (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: StringRequest() didn't support the #NUMERICAL mode (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Setting Hyperlink.URL didn't automatically update the label in case no custom
      label was set (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Group.Remove() didn't work correctly for colgroups (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix: moai.CreateObject() didn't accept framed colgroups as the parent (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix: Escape sequences like \\n and \\t weren't converted to the correct character code when the MOAI.I18N
      attribute was set (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Hollywood versions 7.x and 8.0 crashed when trying to load RapaGUI 2.0 when the script
      was requesting ISO 8859-1 mode (reported by Petteri Valli)
    - Fix [Linux]: Setting Popfile.File didn't show the new path in the widget (reported by OffseT)
    - Fix [Android]: Textview.Text returned an empty string on Android if Textview.Styled was set to FALSE
      (reported by Petteri Valli)
      
    Version 2.0   (17-Jul-21)
    - Change: Updated documentation
    - New [Examples]: Added ContextMenu, Dynamic5, Fonts, Localization, Sort, Splitter and Weight examples to
      show and test some new features of RapaGUI 2.0
    - Change [Examples]: Made most examples DPI-aware by setting Hollywood 9's new "DPIAware" tag to TRUE in
      the \@OPTIONS preprocessor command
    - Change [Doc]: Applicability is now clickable so that beginners can get a better idea of what it's about
      (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - Change: Amiga installer will now also copy the plugins for all platforms to Hollywood's linker plugins
      directory so that they can be easily linked to executables (suggested by kas1e)  
    - Change [macOS]: Dropped support for the 32-bit x86 platform; since RapaGUI on Intel Macs requires macOS
      10.10 now it isn't possible to support 32-bit x86 any more because 10.10 doesn't even run on 32-bit x86
      Macs at all
    - New: Listview.First has an applicability of SG now (requested by Michael Rupp)  
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux/Android]: Group.HorizSpacing now defaults to 4 like on AmigaOS (reported by
      Michael Rupp)  
    - Fix [Windows]: Ampersands weren't correctly handled in text class in case Text.Frame was set to FALSE
      (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Group class handled Group.Padding even when Group.Frame was set to FALSE (reported by
      Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Horizontal rows of buttons weren't layouted correctly in case one or more of them had a
      fixed width or a different weight setting than the others (reported by Michael Rupp)  
    - Fix [Windows]: Window.ActiveObject didn't return the correct object in case a listview in dataview mode
      was the active object (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - New: Listview.GetEntry() accepts an optional argument now; if this is set to TRUE, Listview.GetEntry()
      will also return the identifier of the brush/icon used for a listview item or -1 if no brush/icon has
      been set for this item; note that the identifier is only returned for columns that have the "Icon" tag
      set to TRUE (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix: moai.FreeObject() couldn't free menu objects that had previously been attached as a context menu  
      (reported by Thomas Igracki)
    - Change: Area.ContextMenu has an applicability of ISGN now; this means that you can now also set up a
      notification on the attribute; in that case, your event handler will be called immediately before
      RapaGUI shows the context menu; you can then return either FALSE for no context menu or use moai.Set()
      to set the desired context menu to show; this is very useful for customizing the context menu depending
      on where the right mouse button has been clicked; the position will be passed to your event handler; in
      case you are listening to Area.ContextMenu, your event handler will also be passed some additional
      information depending on the context menu's parent widget: for listview widgets, RapaGUI will pass the
      row and column of the item below the mouse pointer; for treeview widgets RapaGUI will pass the id of the
      item below the mouse pointer and for texteditor widgets, the cursor position below the mouse pointer
      will be passed
    - Change: The "Sorted" special position identifier for Listview.Insert() is obsolete now; when a listview
      has a column that is used for sorting, all new entries are automatically sort-inserted and the insert
      position is ignored; also, Listview.Move() and Listview.Exchange() can no longer be used for listviews
      that have a sorting column because the order of elements in a listview that has sorting activated is
      solely determined by the sort order and items cannot be positioned at arbitrary indices
    - New: Added Listviewcolumn.SortOrder [ISGN] attribute; this can be used to set the sorting order of a
      listview column; it can be set to either "Ascending" (the default) or "Descending"; furthermore, you can
      also listen to this attribute to get notified when the user changes the sorting order by clicking a
      listview column's header
    - New: Added Listview.SortColumn [ISGN] attribute; this attribute allows you to set which column should be
      the current sorting column; users can also click on the listview's header to change the current sorting
      column in which case you'll be notified in case you are listening to Listview.SortColumn
    - Change: Listviewcolumn.Sortable is no longer restricted to just a single column; you can set it to TRUE
      for as many columns as you wish  
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Sortable listviews in dataview mode didn't really work correctly; the item's
      indices were returned and handled in the completely wrong order  
    - New: Added Listview.GetColumnID() to find out the identifier of a listview column  
    - Change: Listviewcolumn.Icon, Listviewcolumn.Checkbox, and Listviewcolumn.Editable have an applicability
      of IG now instead of just I  
    - New: Added Listview.Columns [G] attribute to query the number of columns in a listview  
    - New: Added Listview.InsertColumn() and Listview.RemoveColumn() methods to dynamically insert and remove
      listview columns; it's no longer necessary to re-create the whole listview when you need to change its
      number of columns; note that these methods are only available "Listview" and "Dataview" mode; the default
      "Listbox" mode doesn't support multiple columns so you might have to explicitly set Listview.ForceMode
      if you want to add and remove columns on-the-fly
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Setting Area.Hide to TRUE didn't hide the horizontal/vertical spacing applied
      by the parent group object (reported by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [Windows]: Area.Tooltip didn't work with Listview and Treeview in dataview mode (reported by Anbjorn
      Myren)  
    - Fix [Amiga]: Setting XXX.DropTarget multiple times caused a crash (reported by Paul Bloedel)  
    - New: Added Treeview.ClickColumn [GN] attribute; this works in the same way as Listview.ClickColumn and
      can be used to find out the column that the user has last clicked  
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Area.ContextMenu didn't work with Treeview class when Treeview.ForceMode was
      set to "Dataview" and with Listview class when Listview.ForceMode was set to "Dataview"; note that
      "Dataview" is also automatically chosen by RapaGUI in case certain features require it, e.g. multiple
      columns in a TreeView widget will automatically activate dataview mode (reported by Thomas Scheller)   
    - Fix [macOS]: Listviewcolumn.Hidden didn't work (reported by Michael Rupp)  
    - New: Added Radio.GetItem() and Radio.SetItem() methods; these methods can be used to get and set the
      labels of individual radio buttons 
    - New: Added Radio.Columns [I] attribute; this allows you to set the number of columns to use when laying
      out the radio buttons (defaults to 1); note that on Android, you cannot have complex radio layouts that
      use columns and rows; you can either have all radio buttons appear in one row (horizontal layout) or in
      one column (vertical layout) (requested by Sandro Barbagelata)
    - Change [Windows/macOS/Linux]: The default step size for Slider class is 1 instead of 10 now so that
      Windows/macOS/Linux are consistent with MUI; you can use the new Slider.StepSize attribute to set a
      different step size (reported by Michael Rupp)  
    - New [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Added Slider.StepSize [ISG] attribute; this can be used to set the step size
      to use when clicking outside the thumb (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - New: Added Slider.Drag [I] notification; this will trigger whenever the user starts to drag a slider's
      thumb; this is the counterpart to the Slider.Release [I] notification (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - New [macOS]: Added Application.WindowMenu [I] attribute; this attribute allows you to set the title of
      macOS' standard window menu to a custom one (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - New [macOS]: Added new types "About", "Quit", "Help", "Preferences" to the Menuitem.Type attribute; by
      setting a menu item to one of these types, RapaGUI will move it to its appropriate position according to
      the host OS' styleguide (e.g. the "About", "Preferences", and "Quit" menus are part of the program menu
      on macOS); on non-macOS systems, those new types don't have any effect and RapaGUI will just ignore them;
      there's also Menu.Type which can be set to "Help" on macOS to set a menu as the standard help menu
      (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - Change [Amiga]: Pageview.PlainBG defaults to TRUE now if Pageview.Mode has been set to "None"; this is
      for consistency with the Windows/Linux/macOS appearance (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - New: Radio.Title also has an applicability of ISG now instead of I; the same restrictions as with
      Group.FrameTitle apply (requested by Sandro Barbagelata)
    - New: Group.FrameTitle has an applicability of ISG now instead of I; this allows you to change a group's
      frame title anytime; note that this requires a newer MUI version; with MUI 3.8, Area.FrameTitle is only
      I (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - New: Added Textentry.ReadOnly [I]; if this is set to TRUE, the text in the widget won't be editable at all
      (requested by Michael Rupp)
    - Fix [macOS]: Combobox.Value didn't trigger when selecting an entry of the pre-defined list of entries  
    - Fix [macOS]: Listview.AbortEditing and Treeview.AbortEditing were never triggered when aborting editing
    - Fix [macOS]: Text in Listview and Treeview columns could get cut off when using columns that automatically
      adapt their width to the largest entry
    - Fix [macOS]: Single column listviews often showed a scrollbar when there was nothing to scroll at all  
    - New: Added Listview.RowHeight [I] attribute; this allows you to set the row height; this is normally not
      necessary because it is calculated automatically but when using icons in "DataView" mode on Windows and
      macOS it might be necessary to set this attribute because otherwise the icons could get cut off
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Crash when calling Area.Redraw() on widgets that can't be drawn like widgets
      of Rectangle class (reported by Samuel Crow)
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Treeviewleaf.SetItem() was only able to change the text of items in the first
      column (reported by Sandro Barbagelata)  
    - Change: Toolbar.ViewMode defaults to "Gfx" now because this is the standard toolbar look  
    - New: Added Window.SizeChange [N] attribute; this allows you to listen to window size changes; whenever
      the event callback is triggered, the "Width" and "Height" member fields will contain the new window size
      (requested by Lazar Zoltan)
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: When changing the size of a Hollywood widget that was embedded inside a widget
      of type Scrollgroup, the scrollgroup's size was reset to its minimum size (reported by Petr Kaderka)
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: When listening to Window.Activate, the "TriggerValue" message member was
      always set to TRUE
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Listview.Insert() in modes "Listview" and "Dataview" wasn't entirely consisted
      with the Amiga version when inserting entries before the active entry, causing the active entry to be
      shifted down
    - New: Hollywood class supports Hollywood's SetPointer(), HidePointer(), ShowPointer(), and MovePointer()
      functions now; this allows you to change the mouse pointer that should be shown when the mouse is over
      a widget of type Hollywood class (requested by Paul Bloedel)  
    - New [Windows]: Added Listview.SystemTheme [I] attribute; this can be used to enable the Windows system
      theme for a listview control by setting it to TRUE (default is FALSE); note that this is only supported
      case the listview is operating in "Listview" mode (see Listview.ForceMode for details)  
    - New [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Added Application.ContextMenu [I] attribute; this new attribute can be used to
      install a context menu for the application's tray icon; obviously, this will only work if you also use
      SetTrayIcon()
    - New [Windows/macOS/Linux]: RapaGUI also supports Hollywood's SetTrayIcon() function now which can be used
      to install an icon in the system tray for your app; in contrast to Hollywood's SetTrayIcon() function,
      RapaGUI's one will also work on macOS and Linux (only if the Linux window manager supports the "System
      Tray Protocol") (requested by Paul Bloedel)
    - New: Added Combobox.Popup [N] attribute; this will trigger whenever the combobox's list popup is opened
      or closed; the "TriggerValue" message member will contain the current state of the popup list (either
      TRUE or FALSE) (requested by Paul Bloedel)
    - New: Added Combobox.Acknowledge [N] attribute; this will trigger whenever the user presses RETURN in the
      string widget that is part of the combobox (requested by Paul Bloedel)
    - New: Added Combobox.Selected [N] attribute; this will trigger whenever the user selects an item from the
      combobox list (requested by Paul Bloedel)
    - Fix [Android]: Combobox.Value event handler didn't work  
    - New [Android]: Pinch view zooming is now supported for HTMLview class (requested by Paul Bloedel)  
    - New: HTMLview.Search() returns a boolean now indicating whether or not the search term was actually found
      (requested by Paul Bloedel)  
    - New: Added moai.UpdateImage(); this can be used to update the graphics of an image; note that this is
      currently only supported for images inside Listview or Treeview objects; after calling moai.UpdateImage()
      you also have to make sure that rows that use the image are redrawn, e.g. by using Listview.Rename() to
      update the image information in a row (requested by Jörg Renkert)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Pageview widgets weren't in the TAB cycle chain (reported by Thomas Igracki)  
    - New [Amiga]: When Text.Frame is set to TRUE, the text inside the text object will be markable; note that
      this requires MUI 4.0 (requested by Ulrich Beckers)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Percentage info text wasn't correct in case Progressbar.Max was set to something different
      to 100 (reported by Thomas Igracki)
    - Fix [Amiga]: The scale below the progress bar didn't appear in case Progressbar.Max was set to a value
      not equal to 100 (reported by Thomas Igracki)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Area.Hide didn't work correctly on Progressbar widgets when used in the XML file (reported
      by Thomas Igracki)
    - New: Added convenient internationalization support; all tags that accept a string argument also accept
      a new "i18n" attribute now that allows you to specify a catalog string index that should be used if a
      catalog for the user's system language is available; the string index can either be an absolute numeric
      value or a Hollywood constant; for locale-dependent strings that are passed in tag attributes you can
      use the new "\@i18n:" suffix in the string; just append this suffix to the string, followed by a numeric
      value or a Hollywood constant and Hollywood will use the specified catalog string instead if there's a
      catalog for the user's system language available; note that all these internationalization features only
      apply to the XML; all changes that are made at runtime need to be handled manually; also note that it
      will obviously only work if there's an open catalog loaded either via the OpenCatalog() command or via
      the \@CATALOG preprocessor command (requested by Sandro Barbagelata)
    - Fix [Android]: Texteditor.Text didn't correctly return the escape sequence for resetting the color back
      to its default when part of a text was colored (reported by Paul Bloedel)
    - Fix [Android]: Colgroup rows sometimes got cut off (reported by Lazar Zoltan)
    - Fix [Android]: Textentry.Acknowledge didn't trigger on Android (reported by Dick Valk)
    - New: Added Hyperlink class; this can be used to embed clickable links in your GUIs; note that on Amiga
      this requires Hyperlink.mcc which is part of MUI on MorphOS and MUI 4.0 but it's not part of MUI 3.8
      (requested by Sasha Pont)
    - New: Added "HideDisplays" tag to \@REQUIRE; if you set this to FALSE, RapaGUI won't hide all Hollywood
      displays automatically on startup; this can be useful when using RapaGUI in Hollywood emulation mode,
      i.e. without using any of RapaGUI's GUI functionality but just to get some features that Hollywood does
      not support by default on some platforms (e.g. menus on Linux, or inter-process communication on Linux
      and macOS)
    - New: RapaGUI now supports inter-process communication via Hollywood's CreatePort() and SendMessage()
      functions; this is especially useful on macOS and Linux where Hollywood doesn't have inbuilt IPC support
      yet; you can just use RapaGUI now to workaround this Hollywood limit
    - Fix [Amiga]: Window.ActiveObject couldn't be obtained for some widgets like comboboxes, pop objects,
      checkboxes, etc. (reported by Nick S.)
    - Fix: Window.ActiveObject sometimes returned trash (reported by Nick S.)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Context menus didn't work when used on Treeview widgets (reported by Michael Suther)
    - New: RapaGUI now also supports menus attached to normal Hollywood displays using the menu library that
      is part of Hollywood; this can be very useful on Linux because Hollywood doesn't support menus on Linux
      because it is a purely X11 application on Linux; by using RapaGUI, however, your app will be turned into
      a GTK application and GTK apps support menus of course so this is an easy and convenient way to get menu
      support on Linux too! (requested by Juan Carlos Herran Martin)
    - New: Added Window.Remember attribute [I]; if this is set to TRUE, the window will remember its position
      and size when the program is restarted (or when dialogs are destroyed and re-created); note that this
      is only possible for windows/dialogs that have an ID; the ID is used to memorize the window's position
      and size in order to restore it later so keep in mind that if you change the window's ID the settings
      will get lost (or they will be transferred to another window in case you re-use an ID previously used
      for a certain window for a new window); also note that this attribute defaults to TRUE on Amiga systems
      because the standard MUI behaviour is to always remember positions; on all other systems it defaults
      to FALSE
    - New: Added support for splitter groups; splitter groups can be used to make GUI layouts more dynamic;
      RapaGUI supports <hsplitter> for horizontal splitter groups and <vsplitter> for vertical ones; splitter
      groups must always contain two widgets which will be separated by a sash allowing the user to configure
      the size of both widgets; there are also some attributes to fine-tune the behaviour of splitter groups
    - Fix [MorphOS]: Memory leak when creating a Textentry widget without any initial contents
    - New: Added Area.FontName [ISG], Area.FontSize [ISG], and Area.FontStyle [ISG]; these can be used to set
      the font family, size, and style to be used by a widget; note that although these are area attributes,
      they are not supported by all widgets; it depends on what the native widgets of the platform RapaGUI is
      running on actually support; e.g. on AmigaOS, Area.FontName and Area.FontSize have an applicability of
      just IG, meaning you can't change the font family and font size attributes after creation because MUI
      doesn't support that; also note that font sizes are always in points and not in pixels so that they can
      automatically adapt to higher DPI displays (requested by Paul Bloedel)
    - Change [Windows/macOS/Linux/Android]: Area.Weight is now handled better; it's still not completely the
      same as with MUI but we're pretty close now which should be sufficient for most cases; note that when
      setting Area.Weight you normally shouldn't set specific dimensions via Area.Width/Height; these should
      be determined by the Area.Weight setting
    - Fix: Context menus didn't work when they were attached to objects that were created dynamically using
      moai.CreateObject()
    - Fix [Amiga]: Nested context menu items triggered twice (reported by Paul Bloedel)
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Setting Area.ContextMenu didn't work correctly for context menu which hadn't
      been initialized yet (reported by Jörg Renkert)
    - Fix: Plugin is now de-initialized correctly in the rare case that it is loaded several times from
      different locations (reported by Petteri Valli)
    - New [Amiga]: Listview.Alternate [I] and Treeview.Alternate [I] are now also supported on Amiga systems;
      requires MUI 5.0; note that you might have to enable the stripes effect in the MUI preferences first
      (requested by Richard Lake)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Texteditor.NoWrap didn't show a horizontal scrollbar; since this is now supported by
      TextEditor.mcc, RapaGUI now requires TextEditor.mcc 15.53 in case you want to use Texteditor class
      (reported by Lazar Zoltan)
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Listview sorting didn't always work correctly for non-ISO-8859-1 languages
      (reported by Petr Kaderka)
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux/Android]: Sorted insert in listview and dataview mode is case-insensitive
      now just like in the Amiga versions of RapaGUI
    - Fix [Windows]: Sorted insert didn't work when a listview was in listbox mode
    - New: FileRequest() supports extended filters introduced with Hollywood 9.0 now
    - Change: RapaGUI requires at least Hollywood 9.0 now
    - New: Dropped multi-threaded core and replaced it with a single-threaded one which runs all event
      callbacks instantly; e.g. when setting Listview.Active, the notification callback defined for
      Listview.Active will be run right when setting Listview.Active using moai.Set() instead of at the
      next time WaitEvent() is called; this instant event handling might break some scripts which depend
      on the behaviour of the old asynchronous event dispatcher but the API break was necessary for some
      exciting upcoming features and dispatching events instantly is also much cleaner than the previous
      asynchronous event dispatcher
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Listening to Listview.StartEditing led to a memory access fault
    - Change: Since modal event loops are no longer supported by RapaGUI, the plugin now disables all
      Hollywood functions which attempt to start a modal event loop, e.g. WaitLeftMouse(), WaitSampleEnd(),
      InKeyStr(), etc.; these can't be used together with RapaGUI any longer
    - Change: All RapaGUI projects must use WaitEvent() now; it's no longer acceptable to implement custom
      event handling using CheckEvent() or CheckEvents(); routing normal Hollywood scripts through RapaGUI
      will only work if they use WaitEvent() too
    - Change [Examples]: Updated Dialogs.hws example to use RunCallback() instead of a dialog function
    - Change: Dialog.ShowModal() no longer supports dialog functions; if you want to open a dialog that
      doesn't block your script, you now have to set Window.Open to TRUE for the dialog (and possibly
      Application.Sleep to TRUE too) and then you can implement the dialog's actual behaviour by repeatedly
      calling a management function either using SetTimeout() or Hollywood 9.0's new RunCallback() function;
      take a look at the updated Dialogs example for a reference implementation
    - Fix: Getting Listviewcolumn.Width didn't work (reported by Sasha Pont)
    - New: Added support for Finddialog class; this can be used to show the system's standard find dialog;
      the following attributes are supported: Finddialog.Open, Finddialog.ReplaceMode, Finddialog.NoUpDown,
      FindDialog.NoMatchCase, Finddialog.NoWholeWorld, Finddialog.FindString, Finddialog.ReplaceString, 
      Finddialog.Down, Finddialog.MatchCase, Finddialog.WholeWord, Finddialog.Find, Finddialog.FindNext,
      Finddialog.Replace, Finddialog.ReplaceAll; note that the system find dialog must always be modeless
      so you must use Finddialog.Open to show it and not Dialog.ShowModal(); also note that Finddialog class
      is currently not supported on AmigaOS and Android
    - New: Added support for online help; Application.HelpFile [ISG] can be used to set a help file for the
      application; on Windows this should point to a CHM file, on Amiga to an AmigaGuide file and on all
      other platforms to a directory which contains all HTML files belonging to the documentation (the
      main file must be called index.html, the index file must be called findex.html) help file; you can then
      use Application.ShowHelp() and Application.ShowHelpNode() to show the online help; note that this is
      not supported on Android
    - Change: The behaviour of TextEditor.HasChanged is now defined more precisely: it is not triggered
      when setting TextEditor.Text any more (this is an API change!) and it's also not triggered when
      calling TextEditor.Clear(); instead, those two will cause TextEditor.HasChanged to be set to FALSE
      again, i.e. unmodified; you can also do this manually now, i.e. TextEditor.HasChanged has an
      applicability of SGN now but when setting it, you should always set it to FALSE
    - New: Added TextEditor.ScrollToLine() to scroll the specified line into view
    - New: Added TextEditor.GetLineLength() to get a line's length (without any trailing line break or
      carriage return characters)
    - New: Added TextEditor.GetPosition() to get the index position from row and column values; -1 is
      returned in case the position is out of range
    - Fix: TextEditor.GetXY() returns -1 now for both values in case an invalid position was specified
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Using the special button string "Cancel" didn't return the correct
      result when it was pressed when using moai.Request() and SystemRequest()
    - New: Added Textview.Append() method to append text to the existing text in the view; on AmigaOS
      this requires at least MUI 4.0
    - Fix: Setting/getting Group.Title and Group.Icon didn't work for pages that had been dynamically
      added to a pageview using one of the append/prepend/insert page methods
    - Change: It is now allowed to create empty <pageview> objects and add pages later
    - Change: RapaGUI requires Hollywood 9.0 now because it uses several interfaces only available in
      Hollywood 9 and better
    - Change [Amiga]: Optimized main loop for faster event handling
    - Change [Examples]: Updated Image example to use a Hollywood 9 image now
    - Change [Examples]: Scrollbar example now checks if scrollbar position has changed before drawing;
      this improves performance on slower systems, especially on Android
    - New [AROS]: Enabled image support since this is now supported by Zune; requires muimaster.library
      v19.52 or better (reported by Neil Cafferkey)
    - New [Android]: Added Window.Orientation [ISGN]; this tag allows you to set the orientation for the
      respective window; this can be either "Device" to keep what is the current device orientation or
      "Portrait" or "Landscape"; you can also set up a notification on this attribute to get notified
      about orientation changes
    - New [Android]: Added Listview.ItemStyle [I] tag; this tag allows you to configure the appearance
      of listview items on Android; possible values are "Default", "Normal", and "Big"; the "Normal"
      mode corresponds to android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1 and the "Big" mode corresponds to
      android.R.layout.simple_expandable_list_item_1
    - New [Android]: Added Listview.LongClick [N] tag; this notification will be triggered whenever the
      user long clicks a listview item
    - New: Added Scrollcanvas.AutoScale [I] tag; this does the same as Scrollbar.AutoScale but for widgets
      of Scrollcanvas class
    - New: Added Scrollbar.AutoScale [I] tag; if this is set to FALSE, all values set in Scrollbar.Level,
      Scrollbar.Range, Scrollbar.StepSize, and Scrollbar.Visible are interpreted as raw pixels; if the
      tag is set to TRUE, they are interpreted as density-independent pixels; the default of this tag
      is what has been set to the "ScaleGUI" tag on \@REQUIRE (defaults to TRUE)
    - New [Android]: Added Window.NoCyclerMenu [I]; if this tag is set to TRUE, RapaGUI won't add a menu
      that allows you to cycle between all open windows automatically; this is useful if you'd like to
      manage window cycling manually
    - New [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Core model has been completely rewritten and uses a thread-based design
      now; this is much cleaner than the old design and solves several glitches (especially on macOS
      and Linux) that could appear with the old core which was quite hackish anyway [VOID]
    - New: Added Texteditor.Hint [ISG] attribute; this does the same as Textentry.Hint but for RapaGUI's
      Texteditor class; on AmigaOS this requires at least TextEditor 15.51
    - New: Added Textentry.Hint [ISG] attribute; this allows you to set hints to be displayed when the
      widget is empty; note that on Amiga platforms this requires MUI 5 from muidev.de; on MorphOS it
      requires MorphOS 3.12
    - Change: Adapted the Demo, SongPlayer, TextEditor, HTMLview, and VideoPlayer examples for high dpi
      systems; thanks to Martin "Mason" Merz for the hires icons; they look stunning on high resolutions!
    - New: Scrollcanvas also supports high dpi monitors now; by default, the dimensions you specify in
      Scrollcanvas.VirtWidth/Height are in density-independent pixels and RapaGUI will automatically
      apply the system's scale factor to the contents drawn by the paint function; if you want to have
      fine-tuned control, you can set the new Scrollcanvas.AutoScale [I] tag to FALSE; in that case,
      Scrollcanvas.VirtWidth/Height are interpreted as pixels and no auto scaling will be performed so
      that your paint function can draw high resolutions graphics without any quality loss due to
      scaling  
    - New: Application.AboutRapaGUI() also uses high resolution graphics on high dpi monitors now 
    - Change: moai.FreeImage() accepts an optional parameter now that can be used to tell RapaGUI if
      the function should free a brush (the default) or an icon image
    - New: All widgets that support brushes also support Hollywood icons now which were introduced in
      Hollywood 8; the advantage of Hollywood icons is that an icon can contain image data in several
      sizes; this is perfect for adding separate image data for high dpi systems because separate image
      data in a higher resolution of course looks better than scaling low-res graphics; in addition to
      that, Hollywood icons can also use vector graphics in order to be freely scalable; to use Hollywood
      icons in RapaGUI you can either set the new Application.UseIcons [I] tag to TRUE to globally make
      Hollywood icons the default image type instead of brushes; alternatively, you can also configure
      the desired image type individually for each of RapaGUI's widgets by using the following new tags:
      Group.IconType [I], Button.IconType [I], Listviewcolumn.IconType [I], Treeviewcolumn.IconType [I],
      Image.BrushType [I], Toolbarbutton.IconType [I]
    - New: All Hollywood displays will automatically be put into Hollywood 8's new "SystemScale" mode now
      which means that they will appear in the correct size even on monitors with a higher dpi setting;
      you can disable this behaviour by setting the new "ScaleHollywood" tag to FALSE when \@REQUIREing
      RapaGUI; bilinear interpolation is disabled by default but can be enabled from \@REQUIRE by setting
      the new "InterpolateHollywood" tag to TRUE; NB: on Android bilinear interpolation is enabled by
      default because RapaGUI uses hardware-accelerated scaling on Android
    - New: RapaGUI will now automatically scale all brushes that are used by widgets (e.g. button images,
      listview icons, etc.) by the host system's content scale factor so that GUI designs look correct
      on systems with a high dpi as well; you can disable this behaviour by setting the new "ScaleGUI"
      tag to FALSE when \@REQUIREing RapaGUI; bilinear interpolation is enabled by default but can also
      be disabled from \@REQUIRE by setting the "InterpolateGUI" tag to FALSE; automatic scaling of
      UI graphics can also be locally disabled or enabled for certain widgets by using the following
      new tags: Button.IconScale [I], Listviewcolumn.IconScale [I], Treeviewcolumn.IconScale [I],
      Image.BrushScale [I], Toolbarbutton.IconScale [I], Group.IconScale [I]
    - New: Added support for high dpi systems; all position and size values are now expected to be in
      density-independent pixels (dip/dp) instead of pixels (px); using pixel values for GUI layouts
      really doesn't make much sense because the user can have an arbitrary scale factor applied to his
      user interface setting; this is especially so on systems whose monitors use a high dpi (e.g.
      4K monitors or Retina systems on the Mac)
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Combobox.Value didn't work at initialization time
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Textview.Text and Group.Title were falsely handled as texts that could
      contain a keyboard shortcut; the underscore character is now ignored as it should be
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Setting Label.Text didn't correctly handle the underscore character
    - Change [Examples]: The "Dialogs" examples sets Button.Hint for its dialog buttons now which gives
      it a better look on Android systems
    - New [Android]: Added Button.Hint [I]; this allows you to give RapaGUI a hint whether the button is
      the positive, negative, or neutral one in a dialog; this is currently only used in dialogs on
      Android; if you set it for your dialog buttons, RapaGUI will use Android's system dialog buttons
      instead which makes your dialog look more native
    - Fix: TextEditor.Color didn't work at all
    - Fix [Linux/macOS, 64bit only]: TextEditor.GetSelection() didn't return correct values
    - Change [Examples]: All examples declare the GUI's XML file in a \@FILE statement now; this will
      automatically link the XML into the applet when compiling the script which makes it easier to test
      the RapaGUI examples on Android
    - New [Android/Amiga]: Added Window.Borderless [I] attribute; if this is set, the window won't have
      any border; on Android this means that the action bar won't be shown
    - New [Android]: Added Window.Subtitle [ISG]; this allows you to set a string to be shown as the
      action bar's subtitle
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Menu.Remove() didn't scan for the item to be removed recursively like
      it is done in the Amiga version
    - New [Android]: Added Window.SingleMenu [I]; if this attribute is set to TRUE, only the first menu
      of the menu bar is used and its items will be shown directly when pressing the options button in
      the action bar
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Listview.Move() no longer activates the wrong entry when moving entries
    - Change [Windows/MacOS/Linux]: Listview.Exchange() no longer scrolls the second item into view
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Setting Listview.Active to an item that was already active triggered
      another Listview.Active notification; this behaviour was inconsistent to the behaviour on Amiga
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: The Listview.Edit() method didn't work at all
    - Fix [Windows/macOS/Linux]: Setting Slider.Level didn't clip to Slider.Min as the lower boundary
      but to 0
    - Fix [Windows]: Setting Texteditor.Align often didn't change the alignment until the next refresh
    - New: Added Combobox.Open() and Combobox.Close() methods; these two allow you to show and hide the
      combobox's list (requested by Paul Bloedel)
    - Fix [Windows]: Potential crash on exit when Application.AboutRapaGUI() had been called earlier
    - Change [Windows]: RapaGUI no longer requires the Visual C++ Redistributable DLLs; it is completely
      stand-alone now! (but about 200kb bigger because it is now statically linked against MSVCRT)
    - New: Added Treeview.Clear() method; this removes all items from a treeview widget; this does the
      same as calling Treeview.Remove() with the special "Root" keyword 
    - New: Added special "Root" parameter for Treeview.Remove(); if "Root" is passed in item$, all items
      in the treeview will be removed so that the treeview will be empty (requested by Jean Holzammer)
    - Fix: Treeview.Remove() didn't correctly adapt lots of internal state values which could lead to
      the problem that certain MOAI IDs weren't released correctly (reported by Jean Holzammer)
    - Fix [Amiga]: TextEditor.HasChanged triggers for every change now, not only for the first one; this
      makes the Amiga version consistent to the behaviour of the Windows, Linux, and Mac OS versions of
      RapaGUI (requested by Lazar Zoltan)
    - NEW [Android]: Ported RapaGUI to Android; this took more than 6 months to write but the result
      is stunning; creating GUI applications that run on Windows, macOS, Linux, AmigaOS, MorphOS, AROS
      and Android has never been easier! RapaGUI on Android supports almost everything from the desktop
      versions; the only thing missing entirely is a tree view widget because Android doesn't have one;
      all the other features are pretty much all supported, including dialogs, icons, toolbars, multiple
      windows and the Hollywood widget; it is also possible to combine Hollywood displays and RapaGUI
      windows in the same application, just like on the desktop platforms; since the majority of RapaGUI
      for Android has been implemented in Java with just a small bridge layer written in C/JNI, it's not
      possible to distribute it as a plugin because plugins are just shared objects containing native code;
      instead, RapaGUI on Android is completely built into Hollywood; for compatibility reasons, you
      still need to \@REQUIRE it, though, just like you do it on desktop platforms

    Version 1.2   (22-Sep-17)
    - Change: Updated documentation
    - Fix [Amiga]: Changing the text style or text alignment in objects of Texteditor class no longer 
      triggers a Texteditor.HasChanged notification; this fix is for consistency between Amiga and the
      other platforms; requires at least TextEditor.mcc 15.48
    - Change: Texteditor.Align is now a global setting on all platforms; previously, the alignment could
      be changed for individual lines but this is no longer possible for cross-platform consistency; the
      alignment setting will now always be a global setting for all lines in the text editor; on AmigaOS
      this feature requires at least TextEditor.mcc 15.48
    - Fix [Windows/Linux/MacOS]: Clicking to the left and right of the slider knob to change the knob's
      position didn't trigger a notification (reported by Xabier Payet)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Setting MOAI.NoNotify after Slider.Max still caused a notification being triggered
      when the current slider position was higher than the new maximum (reported by Lazar Zoltan)
    - Fix [Windows]: Putting a ListView widget into "Dataview" mode often resulted in refresh errors
      that only went away by resizing the parent window
    - New: Added moai.FreeImage(); this allows you to free an image in RapaGUI's internal image cache;
      you have to pass the number of the brush you want to free or -1 to free all images; note that
      you must make sure that the image you free is no longer used by any widget or RapaGUI might
      crash; note that normally it isn't necessary to call moai.FreeImage() because all images are
      freed automatically when RapaGUI quits; it's only necessary in case you want to reuse the same
      brush number with a new image or free memory used by an image (requested by Lazar Zoltan and
      Petteri Valli)
    - Fix [Windows/Linux/MacOS]: Calling moai.FreeObject() on a listview, treeview or pageview control
      didn't free all images correctly
    - Fix [MacOS]: TextEditor.GetXY() didn't work at all
    - Fix [Amiga]: TextEditor.GetText() didn't convert style information to the platform-independent
      format used by RapaGUI (reported by Paul Bloedel)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Getting TextEditor.Text after changing the alignment to center or right didn't
      work any more (reported by Paul Bloedel)
    - Fix [Windows/Linux/MacOS]: TextEditor.Insert() didn't apply style information to the text in
      case TextEditor.Styled was set to true
    - Fix [Windows/Linux/MacOS]: TextEditor.GetText() didn't return any style information in case
      TextEditor.Styled was set to true
    - New: Added version for the PowerPC version of Mac OS X; note that this version of RapaGUI
      requires OS X 10.5, it won't work on 10.4 (requested by Cameron Kaiser)
    - Fix [Windows/Linux/MacOS]: Treeview.GetEntry() didn't work correctly for nodes which were empty
      (reported by Samuel Crow)
    - Change [Windows/Linux/MacOS]: Single-select listviews of mode "Listview" don't allow deselection
      of the active item any longer for consistency with MUI; note that listview mode "Dataview"
      still allows the deselection of items but a Listview.Active event will be triggered whenever
      the user deselects the active item so you can act upon it
    - Fix: Getting TextEditor.Text didn't work with certain versions of the RichEdit control when
      TextEditor.Styled was set to true and the text contained different styles and ran over
      multiple lines
      
    Version 1.1   (09-Apr-17)
    - Change: Updated documentation
    - New: Added \@2x graphics for high resolutions systems on Windows and Mac OS 
    - Fix [Windows]: Double-clicking on a listview item crashed the program when using the
      "Dataview" backend and listening to the Listview.DoubleClick notification 
    - New: Added support for Listview.AbortEditing [N] and Treeview.AbortEditing [N]; these two
      attributes allow you to get notified when the user cancels item editing by pressing escape
      or clicking outside the edit widget (requested by Lazar Zoltan)
    - Fix [Windows]: Size calculation of vertical sliders with label weren't done correctly
      which could lead to several layout problems like sliders overdrawing neighbouring widgets
      (reported by Lazar Zoltan)
    - Change: When not specifying Window.Title, RapaGUI will now use the value of \@APPTITLE as
      the default title; if \@APPTITLE hasn't been specified, "RapaGUI" is used
    - New: Group.Title and Group.Icon now have an applicability of ISG instead of just I; this
      allows you to change the title and icon of individual pages at runtime; to remove the
      icon from a page set Group.Icon to -1; note that on AmigaOS for all Pageview.Modes except
      "List" this feature requires at least MUI 4 (requested by Sandro Barbagelata)
    - Fix [Amiga]: Accelerator key "ENTER" didn't work (reported by Lazar Zoltan)
    - Fix [Windows/MacOS/Linux]: Treeview.GetEntry() segfaulted when used with "Active" for
      item and "Parent" for position on a node/item in the root list (reported by Samuel Crow)
    - New: Added help strings for RapaGUI's commands; if you have Hollywood 7, you will now
      get function help with Hollywood's IDE for Windows and you can also press F1 to open
      the RapaGUI reference; note that you need to copy RapaGUI.chm to a directory named
      "PluginHelp" inside the Hollywood installation directory for this to work
    - New: Added new methods and attributes for Choice class which make it much more
      flexible; the following new methods are now supported: Choice.Clear(), Choice.GetEntry(),
      Choice.Insert(), Choice.Remove(), and Choice.Rename(); additionally, a Choice.Count [G]
      attribute has been added to allow you to query the number of items in the widget; 
      finally, it is now possible to declare empty choice widgets in XML, i.e. you needn't
      add items in XML any longer but you can simply do this later at runtime using the
      new methods; also note that only Choice.GetEntry() and Choice.Count [G] are compatible
      with MUI 3.8; all other methods need MUI 4 or better (requested by Leo den Hollander)
    - New: Added new methods and attributes for Combobox class which make it much more
      flexible; the following new methods are now supported: Combobox.Clear(), Combobox.GetEntry(),
      Combobox.Insert(), Combobox.Remove(), and Combobox.Rename(); additionally, a
      Combobox.Count [G] attribute has been added to allow you to query the number of
      items in a combobox; finally, it is now possible to declare empty combobox widgets in
      XML, i.e. you needn't add items in XML any longer but you can simply do this later at
      runtime using the new methods (requested by Leo den Hollander)
    - New: Added new sample called "DragNDrop"; this demonstrates how to support drag
      and drop with RapaGUI
    - New [Windows/MacOS/Linux]: Normal displays opened through RapaGUI also support the
      "OnDropFile" event handler now; this feature is only available on Hollywood 7
    - New: Listview, Treeview, and Hollywood widgets now support file dropping; to enable
      drop events for these widgets, you have to set the new "DropTarget" attribute [ISG]
      to TRUE and listen to the new "DropFile" [N] attribute; your event callback will
      then receive the file(s) dropped on the widget in a table passed in the "TriggerValue"
      message field; the position of the drop operation will be passed in the "X" and "Y"
      message fields; this position will be relative to the top-left corner of the widget
      (requested by Sandro Barbagelata)
    - Fix [Doc]: Listview.DefClickColumn is now correctly documented as Amiga-only
    - Fix [Windows/MacOS/Linux]: Listview.ClickColumn wasn't implemented at all (reported
      by Leo den Hollander)
    - New: RaiseOnError() works correctly with RapaGUI now but only if you have Hollywood 7
      or better (reported by Paul Bloedel)
    - Fix: moai.FreeApp() didn't work correctly (reported by Paul Bloedel)
    - Fix [Windows/MacOS/Linux]: FileRequest() filters were laid out in a different way than
      filters in file requesters managed by Hollywood; this inconsistency has now been fixed
      (reported by Dimitris Panokostas)
    - Fix [Windows/MacOS/Linux]: "NoClose" and "NoHide" display flags didn't work with RapaGUI
      (reported by Paul Bloedel) 
    - Fix: RapaGUI no longer crashes when calling its functions without \@REQUIREing it
      (reported by Paul Bloedel)
    - Fix [MacOS]: Calling moai.Set() or moai.DoMethod() to change widget attributes or its
      contents often didn't have any effect until the next event came in which led to quite
      a poor responsiveness; I don't remember seeing this problem on Mac OS 10.11 so I think
      it is related to 10.12; nevertheless, it's fixed now
    - Fix [Doc]: Treeview.GetEntry() was falsely documented as returning a "Name" item in its
      return table but it returns an "Items" table instead (reported by Lazar Zoltan) 
    - New [Windows/MacOS/Linux]: Ported RapaGUI to 64-bit for the upcoming Hollywood 7
    - New: Hollywood class supports the "VanillaKey" event handler now if Hollywood 7 is
      available; this event handler allows you to listen to Unicode keys
    - New: Added Unicode support; this finally allows you to create fully internationalized
      GUIs with RapaGUI; note that Unicode support requires at least Hollywood 7
      
    Version 1.0   (14-May-16)
    - First Release
@ENDNODE

@NODE APIChanges "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Compatibility notes@{ub}

    @{b}RapaGUI @{ub}@{b}2.0 @{ub}@{b}API @{ub}@{b}changes@{ub}

    Unfortunately, it was necessary to make a few design changes in RapaGUI 2.0.
    This might require some adaptations in your scripts to make them compatible
    with RapaGUI 2.0. Please read through the following notes to learn if your
    script is affected.

    - Events are now always handled when they occur. For example, let's assume
      you have installed a notification on the @{"Radio.Active" LINK RadioActive} attribute and then
      you do something like this:

          moai.Set("radio", "active", 5) ; triggers event callback!
          p_DoSomething()

      With RapaGUI 1.x, the event handler function for @{"Radio.Active" LINK RadioActive} wouldn't be
      called before the next call to "WaitEvent()", i.e. "p_DoSomething()" would
      always be called before the event handler for @{"Radio.Active" LINK RadioActive} got called. In
      RapaGUI 2.0 this is different now. The event handler will always be called
      right when the event occurs. This means that "p_DoSomething()" will be
      called after the event handler for @{"Radio.Active" LINK RadioActive} because the call to
      @{"moai.Set()" LINK moaiSet} will force the event handler to be run immediately after
      changing the active radio item.

    - "WaitEvent()" will never return. On most platforms, a call to
      "WaitEvent()" will be a one-way ticket that starts your application's main
      event loop and never returns. Only on AmigaOS and compatibles does
      "WaitEvent()" still return from time to time but you shouldn't rely on
      this behaviour because on other platforms it behaves differently. If you
      want "WaitEvent()" to run custom callbacks, just use Hollywood 9.0's new
      "RunCallback()" function.

    - All RapaGUI projects must use "WaitEvent()" now. It's no longer acceptable
      to implement custom event handling using "CheckEvent()" or
      "CheckEvents()". Routing normal Hollywood scripts through RapaGUI will
      only work if they use "WaitEvent()" too.

    - @{"Dialog.ShowModal" LINK DialogShowModal} no longer supports dialog functions. If you want to open
      a dialog that doesn't block your script, you now have to set @{"Window.Open" LINK WindowOpen}
      to TRUE for the dialog (and possibly set @{"Application.Sleep" LINK ApplicationSleep} to TRUE too)
      and then you can implement the dialog's actual behaviour by repeatedly
      calling a management function either using "SetTimeout()" or Hollywood
      9.0's new "RunCallback()" function. Take a look at the updated Dialogs
      example for a reference implementation of a non-blocking dialog that uses
      this technique (choose "Test progress bar dialog" from the menu).

    - Since modal event loops are no longer supported by RapaGUI, the plugin now
      disables all Hollywood functions which attempt to start a modal event
      loop, e.g. "WaitLeftMouse()", "WaitSampleEnd()", "InKeyStr()", etc. These
      can't be used together with RapaGUI any longer.

    - RapaGUI requires Hollywood 9 now. RapaGUI 2.0 uses many interfaces only
      available in Hollywood 9 so you cannot use it with older Hollywood
      versions any longer.

    - When setting @{"Texteditor.Text" LINK TexteditorText}, RapaGUI will no longer trigger a
      @{"Texteditor.HasChanged" LINK TexteditorHasChanged} notification. Instead, @{"Texteditor.HasChanged" LINK TexteditorHasChanged} will
      just be set to FALSE without triggering any event.

    - @{"Toolbar.ViewMode" LINK ToolbarViewMode} no longer defaults to "TextGfx" but to "Gfx".

    - When a listview has sortable columns, all items will always be sorted now.
      It is no longer possible to insert entries at arbitrary positions in a
      listview that has sortable columns. Instead, the entries are always
      sorted. Sorting is determined by the column that has the sort focus. See
      @{"Listview.SortColumn" LINK ListviewSortColumn} for details.

@NODE FAQ "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Frequently asked questions@{ub}

    This section covers some frequently asked questions. Please read them first
    before asking on the forum because your problem might have been covered
    here.

    @{b}Q: @{ub}@{b}My @{ub}@{b}GUI @{ub}@{b}is @{ub}@{b}not @{ub}@{b}resizable. @{ub}@{b}What @{ub}@{b}am @{ub}@{b}I @{ub}@{b}doing @{ub}@{b}wrong?@{ub}

    A: There are some things that you need to keep in mind for the resize
    feature to work correctly. If there is a widget in your GUI that has a fixed
    size, you need to pad it using resizable <rectangle> objects on its sides.
    Then your GUI will be resizable again. For example, imagine you have a 64x64
    <image> object in a horizontal group in your window. RapaGUI won't be able
    to resize this window unless you add rectangle objects to the sides of your
    image object because RapaGUI needs to find an object that can be resized so
    you need to take care that non-resizable objects in your GUI are always
    padded with resizable ones. By the way, be careful with the <label> tag:
    Widgets of label class are actually not resizable because resizable labels
    look quite awkward!


    @{b}Q: @{ub}@{b}RapaGUI @{ub}@{b}doesn't @{ub}@{b}run @{ub}@{b}on @{ub}@{b}my @{ub}@{b}Linux @{ub}@{b}distribution @{ub}@{b}although @{ub}@{b}I @{ub}@{b}have @{ub}@{b}installed@{ub}
    @{b}GTK+. @{ub}@{b}What @{ub}@{b}could @{ub}@{b}be @{ub}@{b}the @{ub}@{b}reason @{ub}@{b}for @{ub}@{b}this?@{ub}

    A: First make sure that you are using the correct RapaGUI version. RapaGUI
    for Linux is available in versions for GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3. Typically, Linux
    distributions only have one of the two GTK versions installed so you need to
    use a RapaGUI build that matches your install GTK version. You could also be
    missing some third party shared objects required by RapaGUI. To see what

@NODE Credits "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Credits@{ub}

    RapaGUI was written by Andreas Falkenhahn. The design was inspired by my MUI
    Royale plugin which only runs on AmigaOS and compatibles and was first
    published at the end of 2012. First experiments with a wxWidgets-based GUI
    toolkit for Hollywood were already started in 2013. Initially I just planned
    to create a wrapper plugin that allows Hollywood scripts to use wxWidgets
    but then I realized that the wxWidgets API can be quite complicated to use
    and I thought that a MUI Royale-based approach would be much more
    user-friendly and convenient for GUI scripting. By imitating the MUI
    programming paradigms in RapaGUI I could also release versions for AmigaOS
    and compatibles making RapaGUI the first cross-platform GUI toolkit to
    support the Amiga's native MUI toolkit. Thus, RapaGUI has the potential to
    make a dream of many Amiga users come true: To have a cross-platform GUI
    toolkit which uses native widgets on all platforms! RapaGUI has finally
    accomplished this mission.

    Thanks have to go to the wxWidgets team and Stefan Stuntz for their
    wonderful GUI toolkits. Special thanks go to Vadim Zeitlin and Eric Jensen
    for their valuable help on wxWidgets and Thore Böckelmann for his instant
    MUI fixes and his openness towards useful MUI extensions which he also
    implemented very quickly.

    Additional thanks to Alfonso Ranieri for TheBar.mcc and codesets.library,
    Allan Odgaard for TextEditor.mcc, HTMLview.mcc and the TheBar.mcc,
    HTMLview.mcc and TextEditor.mcc Open Source Teams for maintaining those
    classes and fixing old bugs.

@NODE ApplicationTree "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Application tree@{ub}

    Every RapaGUI application is basically a tree containing a lot of MOAI
    objects that make up the application. Typically, MOAI objects are just
    widgets like buttons, listviews, combo boxes, etc. but they can also
    top-level windows or abstract objects like group objects which are used to
    compute the GUI layout.

    The root element of every application tree must always be an instance of
    @{"Application class" LINK Application}. No MOAI object can exist outside the application object.
    Application objects are created by calling @{"moai.CreateApp()" LINK moaiCreateApp} and there can be
    only one application object in every program. The application object is
    responsible for handling all the events and messaging required by your
    application. See @{"Application class" LINK Application} for details.

    The most important children of the application object are the top-level
    windows of your application. These can be normal top-level windows or modal
    dialogs which block the rest of your application while they are open. To
    create those objects in XML, you just have to declare them using the
    <window> and <dialog> tags. See @{"Window class" LINK Window} for details. See @{"Dialog class" LINK Dialog}
    for details.

    Every window or dialog always needs to have exactly one root object which
    must be derived from @{"Group class" LINK Group}. Group class allows you to combine one or
    more widgets in a horizontal, vertical, or grid-based layout. This is one of
    the most important classes and it can be accessed from XML by using the
    <vgroup>, <hgroup>, and <colgroup> tags. Whenever the window size changes,
    all groups are relayouted automatically which means that you don't have to
    care about the complex task of recalculating your GUI layout based on the
    current window size. RapaGUI does this all automatically for you. See @{"Group" LINK Group}
    @{"class" LINK Group} for details.

    Another very important class is @{"Area class" LINK Area}. All widgets are children of
    @{"Area class" LINK Area} because @{"Area class" LINK Area} basically just describes a rectangular region
    within the GUI layout on which widget-dependent graphics are drawn. This
    means that you can use all attributes and methods of this class on all MOAI
    objects that are widgets. For example, you can set the dimensions of all
    your widgets by just using the attributes @{"Area.Width" LINK AreaWidth} and @{"Area.Height" LINK AreaHeight}. This
    is usually unnecessary, however, because RapaGUI automatically chooses the
    dimensions for all widgets. If you're unhappy with RapaGUI's choice, you can
    override it by using those attributes, though. See @{"Area class" LINK Area} for details.

@ENDNODE

@NODE GUILayout "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}GUI layout@{ub}

    As you have already seen above, in RapaGUI GUIs are defined entirely using
    the XML markup language. This allows you to quickly create GUI layouts by
    just composing a tree hierarchy made up of several windows, groups, and
    widgets. Here is an example of what an application tree could look like in
    an XML declaration:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
        <application>
           <window title="Example GUI">
              <vgroup>
                 <listview>
                    <column/>
                 </listview>
                 <textentry/>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button id="add">Add</button>
                    <button id="rem">Remove</button>
                 </hgroup>
              </vgroup>
           </window>
        </application>

    And here is what this GUI looks like on Windows 7:

    See image: @{"examplegui.png" LINK "Guide/examplegui.png/MAIN"}

    As you can see in the XML, no position coordinates or sizes are ever given.
    This is all calculated automatically by RapaGUI to ensure a clean appearance
    on all systems. Keep in mind that RapaGUI applications can run on a wide
    variety of systems: On Windows, GTK, macOS, and even on AmigaOS. By omitting
    hard-coded window and widget sizes and positions RapaGUI can automatically
    choose the best sizes and positions depending on the current screen and font
    size. Of course, you can also force RapaGUI to use hard-coded sizes by using
    the @{"Area.Width" LINK AreaWidth} and @{"Area.Height" LINK AreaHeight} attributes. To enforce a listview size of at
    least 600x400 @{"device-independent pixels" LINK DIP}, you could just write:

        <listview width="600" height="400">
           <column/>
        </listview>

    The only thing which you cannot modify is the widget position. Since the
    widget position highly depends on the current UI font size it really doesn't
    make sense to allow hard-coded widget positions in a cross-platform GUI
    toolkit because there will be massive differences between the different
    operating systems. Thus, RapaGUI doesn't allow you to hard-code widget
    positions.

@NODE RunningGUI "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Running GUIs@{ub}

    All you have to do to create and run GUIs declared using XML is to write a
    few lines of Hollywood code. Let's assume you saved the example GUI XML
    definition from above into a file named GUI.xml, all you would have to do
    now to create and show this GUI from a Hollywood script is creating a
    Hollywood script with the following lines:

        \@REQUIRE "RapaGUI"
        moai.CreateApp(FileToString("GUI.xml"))
        Repeat
           WaitEvent
        Forever

    That's all! When you run the Hollywood script from above, your GUI will
    automatically be created and shown, no matter if your script is running on
    Windows, Linux, macOS, or AmigaOS.

@ENDNODE

@NODE RequireTags "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Initializing RapaGUI@{ub}

    All you have to do to make your script use RapaGUI instead of Hollywood's
    inbuilt graphics engine is adding the following line to the top of your
    script:

        \@REQUIRE "rapagui"

    Alternatively, if you are using Hollywood from a console, you can also start
    your script like this:

        Hollywood test.hws -requireplugins rapagui

    RapaGUI accepts the following arguments in its "\@REQUIRE" call:

    ScaleGUI: When running RapaGUI on a high-DPI monitor, all raster graphics
              will automatically be scaled to fit to the monitor's DPI settings.
              If you don't want that, set this tag to FALSE. See @{"High-DPI" LINK HiDPI}
              @{"support" LINK HiDPI} for details. If this tag is set to TRUE (also the
              default), you can control whether or not bilinear interpolation
              should be used during scaling using the "InterpolateGUI" tag (see
              below). Defaults to TRUE. (V2.0)

    InterpolateGUI:
              If "ScaleGUI" is set to TRUE (also the default), the
              "InterpolateGUI" tag can be used to specify whether or not
              bilinear interpolation should be used when scaling. Defaults to
              TRUE. (V2.0)

    ScaleHollywood:
              When running RapaGUI on a high-DPI monitor, all @{"Hollywood widgets" LINK Hollywood}
              will automatically be scaled to fit to the monitor's DPI settings.
              If you don't want that, set this tag to FALSE. See @{"High-DPI" LINK HiDPI}
              @{"support" LINK HiDPI} for details. If this tag is set to TRUE (also the
              default), you can control whether or not bilinear interpolation
              should be used during scaling using the "InterpolateHollywood" tag
              (see below). Defaults to TRUE. (V2.0)

    InterpolateHollywood:
              If "ScaleHollywood" is set to TRUE (also the default), the
              "InterpolateHollywood" tag can be used to specify whether or not
              bilinear interpolation should be used when scaling. Note that in
              contrast to the "InterpolateGUI" tag the "InterpolateHollywood"
              tag defaults to FALSE which means that by default, bilinear
              interpolation is not used for Hollywood widgets. (V2.0)

    HideDisplays:
              By default, RapaGUI will hide all Hollywood displays on startup.
              If you don't want that, set this tag to TRUE. This can be useful
              when using RapaGUI in Hollywood emulation mode, i.e. without using
              any of RapaGUI's GUI functionality but just to get some features
              that Hollywood does not support by default on some platforms (e.g.
              menus on Linux, or inter-process communication on Linux and
              macOS). (V2.0)

    Here is an example of how to pass arguments to the "\@REQUIRE" preprocessor
    command:

        \@REQUIRE "rapagui", {ScaleGUI = False}

    Alternatively, you can also use the -requiretags console argument to pass
    these arguments. See the Hollywood manual for more information.

@ENDNODE

@NODE ObjectHandling "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Object handling@{ub}

    As you've already seen RapaGUI uses XML files to create MOAI objects. When
    creating objects you can use all attributes marked with the letter "I" in
    the applicability section of the accompanying attribute documentation. For
    example, to create a textentry object with a maximum length of 80 characters
    you would simply use the @{"Textentry.MaxLen" LINK TextentryMaxLen} attribute and include it in your
    XML declaration.

        <textentry id="mystring" maxlen="80"/>

    Once your object is ready, you can start talking to it by setting or getting
    its attributes or by running its methods. For that purpose it is important
    that you give your object an identifier using the "id" attribute so that the
    functions @{"moai.Set()" LINK moaiSet}, @{"moai.Get()" LINK moaiGet} and @{"moai.DoMethod()" LINK moaiDoMethod} can find your object.
    In the code above we assigned the id "mystring" to our textentry widget.
    Here's an example of how we could talk to this widget now:

        moai.Set("mystring", "text", "look")
        s$ = moai.Get("mystring", "text")
        DebugPrint("Always " .. s$ .. " on the bright side of life.")

    As already mentioned above, all attributes and methods are completely
    documented in the documentation coming with this distribution.

    The next thing you have to do is handling events that are triggered by your
    GUI. This is covered in the next section.

@ENDNODE

@NODE HandleEvents "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Event handling@{ub}

    RapaGUI events are handled in the very same way as normal Hollywood events.
    This means that you just have to pass a callback function to Hollywood's
    "InstallEventHandler()" function and whenever a RapaGUI event is triggered,
    your callback function will be called.

    Here is an example how to install a RapaGUI event callback:

        InstallEventHandler({RapaGUI = p_EventHandler})

    Whenever an event occurs, RapaGUI will then call p_EventHandler() with a
    table as parameter. The table will have the following fields initialized:

    Action:   Initialized to "RapaGUI".

    Class:    Contains the name of the MOAI class this event comes from, e.g.
              "Choice".

    Attribute:
              Contains the name of the class attribute that has triggered the
              event, e.g. "Active".

    ID:       Contains the ID of the MOAI object that triggered this event, e.g.
              "mychoice".

    TriggerValue:
              Contains the current value of the attribute that triggered this
              event. You could also find this out by doing a @{"moai.Get()" LINK moaiGet} on the
              object but it is more convenient to get the current value directly
              to your event callback.

    MOAIUserData:
              If the object was assigned certain userdata, it will be passed to
              the event handler callback in this tag. See @{"MOAI.UserData" LINK MOAIUserData} for
              details.

    NotifyData:
              If the object was assigned certain notify data, it will be passed
              to the event handler callback in this tag. See @{"MOAI.NotifyData" LINK MOAINotifyData} for
              details.

    On top of that it is also necessary to tell RapaGUI which events you would
    like to receive. Only events you explicitly request to receive are passed to
    your event callback to minimize overhead. An exception are button, toolbar
    button and menu item events. They are passed to your event callback even if
    you haven't requested them. The reason for this design choice is that
    normally all of these events need to be individually handled because the
    user expects something to happen when pressing a button.

    All RapaGUI events are coupled to attributes of MOAI objects. The next
    section describes this in detail.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Notifications "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Attribute notifications@{ub}

    RapaGUI's event handling is based on the values of certain attributes of the
    different MOAI classes. You can listen to the values of all attributes that
    have an applicability of "N". If you set up a listener on an attribute
    value, RapaGUI will run your event callback whenever the attribute value
    changes.

    For example, you could set up a listener on the @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute
    which contains the active item of a listview widget. If you do this, your
    event handler will be called whenever the active item of the respective
    listview widget changes. To install a listener on a certain attribute, you
    have to set up a notification for this attribute in your object declaration.
    This is done directly in the XML file by using the "Notify" attribute that
    is accepted by all MOAI classes:

        <listview id="lv" notify="active">
           <column>
              <item>One</item>
              <item>Two</item>
              <item>Three</item>
           </column>
        </listview>

    The code above will run your event callback whenever the active item of the
    listview object that has the id "lv" changes because you've requested to
    listen to the value of the @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute.

    If you want to listen to multiple notifications on the same MOAI object, you
    have to separate them using semicolons, e.g.:

        <listview id="lv" notify="active; doubleclick">
        ...
        </listview>

    As you can see, the code above installs listeners on both attributes,
    @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} and @{"Listview.DoubleClick" LINK ListviewDoubleClick}, so that your event callback is
    also invoked when the user double clicks on a listview entry.

    Alternatively, you can also set up or remove notifications at run-time using
    the @{"moai.Notify()" LINK moaiNotify} function from your code.

    To print the currently active listview item from your event handler, you
    could then use the following code:

        Function p_EventHandler(msg)
            Switch msg.action
            Case "RapaGUI":
               Switch msg.attribute
               Case "Active":
                  Switch msg.id
                  Case "lv":
                     DebugPrint("Active listview item:", msg.triggervalue)
                  EndSwitch
               EndSwitch
            EndSwitch
        EndFunction

    Keep in mind, though, that attribute values can also be changed manually.
    For example, your program might want to manually activate a certain listview
    item by doing something like this:

        moai.Set("lv", "active", 5)  ; activate item number 6

    Since the call above changes the value of the @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute as
    well, your event handler callback will be triggered by this call, too. If
    you don't want this, you can use the special attribute @{"MOAI.NoNotify" LINK MOAINoNotify} in your
    call to @{"moai.Set()" LINK moaiSet}. Whenever @{"MOAI.NoNotify" LINK MOAINoNotify} is set to TRUE, the attribute's
    value will be changed without invoking any event handlers. Thus, to change
    the active listview item without triggering any event callbacks, you would
    just write:

        moai.Set("lv", "active", 5, "nonotify", True)

    Finally, as already mentioned in the previous section, there are some
    attributes that RapaGUI always listens to. These are: @{"Button.Pressed" LINK ButtonPressed},
    @{"Button.Selected" LINK ButtonSelected}, @{"Toolbarbutton.Pressed" LINK ToolbarbuttonPressed}, @{"Toolbarbutton.Selected" LINK ToolbarbuttonSelected}, and
    @{"Menuitem.Selected" LINK MenuitemSelected}. Since these are so common and widely used and you will
    normally always want to listen to attributes like @{"Button.Pressed" LINK ButtonPressed} because
    pressing a button will always cause a reaction, RapaGUI listens to them
    automatically. Thus, you don't have to explicitly request a notification on
    these attributes, i.e. writing the following is redundant:

        <button id="btn" notify="pressed">Click me</button>

    Instead, you can just write:

        <button id="btn">Click me</button>

    The same is true for menu items and toolbar buttons.

@ENDNODE

@NODE DynamicObjects "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Dynamic objects@{ub}

    Most applications create their GUI by a simple call to @{"moai.CreateApp()" LINK moaiCreateApp}
    which is passed an XML declaration that contains the complete user interface
    of the whole application. In some situations, though, it might be necessary
    to create MOAI objects after the call to @{"moai.CreateApp()" LINK moaiCreateApp} and insert them
    into the existing application.

    This is possible by using the @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject} API. This function allows
    you to create a MOAI object from an XML declaration, pretty similar to what
    @{"moai.CreateApp()" LINK moaiCreateApp} does except that @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject} doesn't allow you to
    create an application because there can be only one application.

    For example, you can create a button using @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject} like this:

        moai.CreateObject([[<button id="mybutton">Click me</button>]])

    It is very important to set an identifer for the MOAI object you create
    using @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject} because the identifier is needed to refer to the
    object later. Now that we have created the button we could insert it into an
    existing window layout. Let's suppose our window layout currently looks like
    this:

        <window>
           <hgroup id="mygroup">
              <button id="ok">OK</button>
              <button id="cancel">Cancel</button>
           </hgroup>
        </window>

    We could now use the @{"Group.Insert" LINK GroupInsert} method to insert the newly created button
    after the "OK" button. We would have to use the following code to do that:

        moai.DoMethod("mygroup", "initchange")
        moai.DoMethod("mygroup", "insert", "mybutton", "ok")
        moai.DoMethod("mygroup", "exitchange")

    You can see that we're also calling the methods @{"Group.InitChange" LINK GroupInitChange} and
    @{"Group.ExitChange" LINK GroupExitChange}. This is very important. Those methods have to be run
    whenever you change the children of a group, i.e. you remove or add
    children. RapaGUI needs you to call these methods because after removing or
    adding group children a window relayout becomes necessary. That's why simply
    calling @{"Group.Insert" LINK GroupInsert} or any other method that changes the number of group
    children isn't enough.

    Of course, we can also remove children from groups. This is possible by
    using @{"Group.Remove" LINK GroupRemove}. The following code removes the "Cancel" button from the
    above window layout:

        moai.DoMethod("mygroup", "initchange")
        moai.DoMethod("mygroup", "remove", "cancel")
        moai.DoMethod("mygroup", "exitchange")

    After this call, the MOAI object with the id "cancel" has become a detached
    object. This means that you could also attach it to a group now again by
    using @{"Group.Insert" LINK GroupInsert} or a similar method. Note that all methods which insert
    MOAI objects into existing layouts only accept detached objects. It's not
    possible to insert the same MOAI object into multiple groups. As soon as you
    insert a MOAI object into a group (or menu tree), it changes its state from
    detached to attached. Once a MOAI object is in attached state, it can no
    longer be passed to methods which expect a detached object. In order to turn
    a MOAI object from attached to detached state, you need to use a method like
    @{"Group.Remove" LINK GroupRemove} to detach a MOAI object from a group.

    As a final note, the XML code you pass to @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject} can also be a
    complete tree, e.g. you could create a complete window with just a single
    call to @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject}. This is all possible. @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject}
    isn't limited to creating single MOAI objects but it can create multiple
    objects for you as well. When you're creating a window or dialog with
    @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject}, though, don't forget to add it to the application
    object by calling @{"Application.AddWindow" LINK ApplicationAddWindow} since window objects are also in
    detached state by default unless they have been added to an application
    object. For dialogs, you can just use @{"moai.CreateDialog()" LINK moaiCreateDialog} which will
    implicitly call @{"Application.AddWindow" LINK ApplicationAddWindow}.

@NODE Sizeability "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Sizeability@{ub}

    One of RapaGUI's premium features is its capability to automatically
    recalculate the complete GUI layout when resizing the window that contains
    the widgets. This, however, is only possible if all groups in a window can
    be resized, otherwise the window's size will stay fixed and won't be
    resizable. In order to create windows that are freely resizable, you need to
    know which widgets are resizable and which are not. Consider the following
    GUI definition:

        <window>
           <vgroup>
              <button id="btn">Hello World!</button>
           </vgroup>
        </window>

    This window will only be horizontally resizable because button widgets are
    only horizontally resizable by default. They aren't vertically sizable by
    default because buttons which change their vertical size look pretty ugly.
    Normally, a button's height is fixed to the standard button height as
    defined by the theme currently active on the operating system.

    If you want this window to be resizable, you have several options: A widely
    used option is to insert empty space using objects of @{"Rectangle class" LINK Rectangle}.
    These are resizable in all directions. Thus, if you insert a <rectangle>
    object, your window will suddenly become resizable in all directions:

        <window>
           <vgroup>
              <button id="btn">Hello World!</button>
              <rectangle/>
           </vgroup>
        </window>

    Alternatively, you could also insert a different widget which is vertically
    resizeable, for example a listview. Or you could even make the button
    vertically resizable by setting the @{"Area.FixHeight" LINK AreaFixHeight} attribute to False:

        <window>
           <vgroup>
              <button id="btn" fixheight="false">Hello World!</button>
           </vgroup>
        </window>

    But this doesn't look so pretty because now the user could end up with a
    button that is a few hundred pixels in height. That's why the <rectangle>
    approach is the one most oftenly used to insert padding space for
    non-resizable objects.

    In order to use <rectangle> objects as padding space in the right positions,
    you need to know which widgets are resizeable by default and which are not.
    Therefore, here is an overview of the sizeability of the individual widgets
    supported by RapaGUI:

    Busybar class:
              Horizontally resizable.

    Button class:
              Horizontally resizable.

    Checkbox class:
              Not resizable.

    Choice class:
              Horizontally resizable.

    Combobox class:
              Horizontally resizable.

    Hollywood class:
              Not resizable.

    HLine class:
              Horizontally resizable.

    HSpace class:
              Vertically resizable.

    HTMLview class:
              Resizable in all directions.

    Image class:
              Not resizable.

    Label class:
              Not resizable.

    Listview class:
              Resizable in all directions.

    Pageview class:
              Resizable in all directions.

    Popcolor class:
              Horizontally resizable.

    Popfile class:
              Horizontally resizable.

    Popfont class:
              Horizontally resizable.

    Poppath class:
              Horizontally resizable.

    Progressbar class:
              Horizontally resizable for horizontal progress bars. Vertically
              resizable for vertical progress bars.

    Radio class:
              Not resizable.

    Rectangle class:
              Resizable in all directions.

    Scrollbar class:
              Horizontally resizable for horizontal scrollbars. Vertically
              resizable for vertical scrollbars.

    Scrollcanvas class:
              Resizable in all directions.

    Scrollgroup class:
              Resizable in all directions.

    Slider class:
              Horizontally resizable for horizontal sliders. Vertically
              resizable for vertical sliders.

    Text class:
              Horizontally resizable.

    Texteditor class:
              Resizable in all directions.

    Textentry class:
              Horizontally resizable.

    Textview class:
              Resizable in all directions.

    Treeview class:
              Resizable in all directions.

    VLine class:
              Vertically resizable.

    VSpace class:
              Horizontally resizable.

    Of course, you can change these defaults by setting the @{"Area.FixWidth" LINK AreaFixWidth} and
    @{"Area.FixHeight" LINK AreaFixHeight} attributes accordingly to enable or disable certain
    sizeability settings, but this is often not recommended because it will look
    pretty ugly if for example a textentry widget is suddenly vertically
    resizable. This would unnecessarily confuse the user because he might end up
    with a textentry widget which is 300 pixels in height but only allows to
    enter one line of text. Thus, the best idea is to respect the OS defaults
    for the standard widgets.

    Of course, there are also widgets where it's completely acceptable to
    override the defaults from above. For example, widgets deriving from
    @{"Hollywood class" LINK Hollywood} are non-resizable by default but of course you are
    encouraged to use @{"Area.FixWidth" LINK AreaFixWidth} and @{"Area.FixHeight" LINK AreaFixHeight} to adjust the widget's
    sizeability to your personal needs.

@NODE Applicability "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Applicability@{ub}

    In the documentation of every object attribute you will find information
    about the applicability of this attribute. Attribute applicability is
    described in the form of a combination of the four letters I, S, G, and N.
    This tells you the various contexts that the attribute can be used in.

    Here is an explanation of the different applicability contexts:

    I         Attribute can be used when creating the object in the XML file.
              (initialization time)

    S         Attribute can be used with @{"moai.Set()" LINK moaiSet} at runtime.

    G         Attribute can be used with @{"moai.Get()" LINK moaiGet} at runtime.

    N         Notifications on this attribute are possible either by using the
              "Notify" attribute in the XML declaration or by calling the
              @{"moai.Notify()" LINK moaiNotify} function at runtime.

    For example, if an attribute has an applicability of just "I", then this
    attribute can only be used during object initialization time. It cannot be
    changed later using @{"moai.Set()" LINK moaiSet}. If an attribute has an applicability of
    just "S" on the other hand, it is not possible to specify the attribute
    already at initialization time in the XML file. Attributes that have an
    applicability of "ISGN" can be used in all contexts.

@ENDNODE

@NODE DIP "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Device-independent pixels@{ub}

    All position and size specifications in RapaGUI must be in
    device-independent pixels. This has the advantage that they will be
    independent of the current monitor's DPI setting so that your application
    will still look correctly when run on high-DPI monitors, for example.

    Consider the following declaration of a window:

        <window width="640" height="480">
           ...
        </window>

    This will declare a window whose width is 640dip and whose height is 480dip.
    If the current monitor doesn't use DPI scaling (e.g. 96dpi on Windows, 72dpi
    on macOS), the device-independent pixels will be identical to physical
    pixels so that the window's size will be 640x480 pixels. If the monitor is
    configured to use DPI scaling, however, the device-independent pixels will
    automatically be adapted to the monitor's DPI setting. For example, on a
    192dpi monitor (i.e. 200% scale on Windows) the window's physical dimensions
    on the screen will be 1280x960 pixels instead because RapaGUI will
    automatically adapt the device-independent pixels to the current monitor's
    DPI.

    Note that it is generally a good idea to avoid hard-coding specific
    positions and sizes and let RapaGUI determine these automatically from your
    layout. This guarantees a maximum amount of compatibility between different
    operating systems and their specific window managers, fonts, themes, and
    decorations.

    Also make sure to read the chapter on @{"High-DPI support" LINK HiDPI} to learn about other
    things to consider when designing an application that should be compatible
    with high-DPI monitors. See @{"High-DPI support" LINK HiDPI} for details.

@ENDNODE

@NODE HiDPI "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}High-DPI support@{ub}

    RapaGUI has full support for high-DPI displays. Normally, RapaGUI handles
    everything automatically for you so that your application should look the
    same regardless of the monitor's DPI setting. This is achieved by handling
    all position and size values in @{"device-independent pixels" LINK DIP} which makes
    RapaGUI applications scale nicely to different monitor DPI settings.
    Furthermore, RapaGUI will automatically scale all raster graphics, e.g.
    button images set using @{"Button.Icon" LINK ButtonIcon}, to fit to the monitor's DPI setting.

    Note that RapaGUI's automatic scaling of raster graphics could lead to
    images becoming blurry on high-DPI monitors. You can change that by either
    providing sets of images for different DPI settings instead of just a single
    image or by using vector images that can be scaled with no losses in quality
    to any size.

    For example, let's suppose you want to add a 32x32px icon to your button
    using the @{"Button.Icon" LINK ButtonIcon} attribute. If you set @{"Button.Icon" LINK ButtonIcon} to a raster brush
    and the user's monitor has a DPI scaling of 200% activated, RapaGUI will
    scale the image to 64x64px which will look blurry. So you could either set
    @{"Button.Icon" LINK ButtonIcon} to the identifier of a vector brush or you could create a
    Hollywood icon, add 32x32px and 64x64px images (and possibly more) to it,
    and then pass this icon to @{"Button.Icon" LINK ButtonIcon}.

    Note that in that case you'll also have to set the @{"Button.IconType" LINK ButtonIconType} attribute
    to "Icon" to tell RapaGUI that you've passed the identifier of an icon
    instead of a brush, which is the default type for @{"Button.Icon" LINK ButtonIcon}. In that
    case, RapaGUI will use the 32x32px image inside the icon in case the monitor
    has no DPI scaling activated or it will use the 64x64px image in case the
    monitor has a DPI scaling of 200% activated. If the DPI scaling is something
    between 100% and 200%, RapaGUI will scale the image inside the icon whose
    size is closest to the desired target size.

    By default, all widgets that support images expect you to pass Hollywood
    brushes. If you always want to pass Hollywood icons instead, you can also
    set the global attribute @{"Application.UseIcons" LINK ApplicationUseIcons} to TRUE. This will change the
    default of all tags accepting images from Hollywood brushes to Hollywood
    icons.

    As described above, when providing images to RapaGUI using Hollywood brushes
    that contain raster data, RapaGUI will automatically scale those raster
    brushes to fit to the current monitor's DPI settings. If you don't want
    that, you can set the "ScaleGUI" tag to FALSE when you "\@REQUIRE" the
    RapaGUI plugin. See @{"Initializing RapaGUI" LINK RequireTags} for details. Bilinear interpolation
    during scaling can be turned off by setting the "InterpolateGUI" tag to
    FALSE on "\@REQUIRE". Alternatively, automatic image scaling can also be
    configured on a per-widget basis. For example, for button images you can
    control automatic image scaling by setting the @{"Button.IconScale" LINK ButtonIconScale} tag.

    Also, all @{"Hollywood widgets" LINK Hollywood} will be automatically scaled to fit to the
    current monitor's DPI settings. If you don't want that, you can set the
    "ScaleHollywood" tag to FALSE when you "\@REQUIRE" the RapaGUI plugin. See
    @{"Initializing RapaGUI" LINK RequireTags} for details. Bilinear interpolation during scaling can
    be enabled by setting the "InterpolateHollywood" tag to TRUE on "\@REQUIRE".

    With @{"Scrollcanvas class" LINK Scrollcanvas} the dimensions you specify in @{"Scrollcanvas.VirtWidth" LINK ScrollcanvasVirtWidth}
    and @{"Scrollcanvas.VirtHeight" LINK ScrollcanvasVirtHeight} are in @{"device-independent pixels" LINK DIP} by default and
    RapaGUI will automatically apply the system's scale factor to the contents
    drawn by the @{"Scrollcanvas.Paint" LINK ScrollcanvasPaint} function. If you want to have fine-tuned
    control, you can set the @{"Scrollcanvas.AutoScale" LINK ScrollcanvasAutoScale} attribute to FALSE. In that
    case, @{"Scrollcanvas.VirtWidth" LINK ScrollcanvasVirtWidth} and @{"Scrollcanvas.VirtHeight" LINK ScrollcanvasVirtHeight} are interpreted as
    physical pixels and no auto scaling will be done so that your paint function
    can draw high resolutions graphics without any quality loss due to scaling.

    Finally, keep in mind that you explicitly have to enable DPI-aware mode on
    Windows if you want your application to support high-DPI modes natively.
    This can be done by setting the "DPIAware" tag in the "\@OPTIONS"
    preprocessor command to TRUE, e.g.

        \@OPTIONS {DPIAware = True}

    If you don't do that, your application won't be DPI-aware which means that
    Windows will run it in a special compatibility mode. In this compatibility
    mode, Windows will scale your application to match the monitor's DPI setting
    but this will lead to a blurry appearance. That's why it is suggested to set
    "DPIAware" to TRUE, as shown above.

    Note that on Linux you should use the GTK+ 3 version of RapaGUI if you want
    to support high-DPI modes because GTK+ 2 doesn't support high-DPI modes very
    well.

@NODE Shortcuts "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Keyboard shortcuts@{ub}

    RapaGUI allows you to set up keyboard shortcuts really easily by simply
    using an underscore character ("_") before the character you would like to
    set up as a keyboard shortcut. You should always provide support for
    keyboard shortcuts because many users prefer to use them instead of the
    mouse, especially when it comes to actions which have to be repeated dozens
    of times it is much easier to use the keyboard instead of, just as an
    instance, having to navigate to certain submenus hidden deep within the menu
    hierarchy all the time. The following classes support keyboard shortcuts
    defined through the underscore character:

    - Button class
    - Checkbox class
    - Label class
    - Menu class
    - Menuitem class
    - Radio class
    - Slider class
    - Text class
    - Toolbarbutton class

    Here is an example of how to set up two keyboard shortcuts for widgets
    derived from @{"Button class" LINK Button} :

        <hgroup>
           <button id="ok">_OK</button>
           <button id="cancel">_Cancel</button>
        </hgroup>

    The XML code above will set up "O" and "C" as keyboard shortcuts. On
    Windows, the user has to press ALT+O to select the "OK" button and ALT+C to
    select the "Cancel" button. On other platforms the combinations are
    sometimes different, e.g. on macOS you have to use the COMMAND key instead
    of the ALT key.

    Since @{"Label class" LINK Label} doesn't create widgets that can be controlled by the user,
    specifying a keyboard shortcut for labels simply activates the next widget
    in the GUI layout, which is usually the widget that is described by the
    label. For example:

        <hgroup>
           <label>_Name</label>
           <textentry/>
        </hgroup>

    As you can see, in the XML code above "N" has been set up as a keyboard
    shortcut by using an underscore character. Pressing ALT+N will activate the
    text entry widget then since label widgets cannot take the window focus.

    In the rare case that you want to use the underscore character as a label
    text for one of your widgets and not have it automatically converted into a
    token indicating a keyboard shortcut, you can just set the @{"Area.NoAutoKey" LINK AreaNoAutoKey}
    attribute to TRUE. If this is set, RapaGUI will simply show the underscore
    character and won't treat it as a special token. Note: Since menu and
    menuitem objects aren't derived from @{"Area class" LINK Area}, you need to use
    @{"Menu.NoAutoKey" LINK MenuNoAutoKey} and @{"Menuitem.NoAutoKey" LINK MenuitemNoAutoKey} in case you want to disable automatic
    shortcut generation for menu or menuitem objects.

    If you need to use more complex keyboard shortcuts (e.g. certain function or
    control keys, combinations of keys), you have to set up an accelerator table
    using @{"Accelerator class" LINK Accelerator} for your window. @{"Accelerator class" LINK Accelerator} allows the
    definition of advanced keyboard shortcuts which are also independent of any
    widgets in your window. If your complex keyboard shortcuts are linked to
    menu items, however, you don't have to use @{"Accelerator class" LINK Accelerator} but you can
    just set the @{"Menuitem.Shortcut" LINK MenuitemShortcut} attribute to the desired shortcut. This will
    automatically set up an accelerator then. See @{"Menuitem.Shortcut" LINK MenuitemShortcut} for details.
    See @{"Accelerator class" LINK Accelerator} for details.

@NODE TextFormat "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Text formatting codes@{ub}

    Widgets of type @{"Textview class" LINK Textview} and @{"Texteditor class" LINK Texteditor} support text formatting
    if the "Styled" attribute of those classes is set to TRUE. RapaGUI supports
    text formatting by special control codes which are described in this
    section.

    Formatting codes always start with an escape character followed by a
    sequence of characters that describe the formatting code. In decimal
    notation the escape character equals ASCII code 27, which is 33 in octal and
    $1B in hexadecimal notation. Care has to be taken when using formatting
    codes because usage is different between XML files and Hollywood source
    files. In XML files the octal notation is used, i.e. you start an escape
    sequence using a backslash and the octal number 33 ('\\33'). In Hollywood
    source codes, however, octal numbers are not supported after a backslash.
    Hollywood always expects the ASCII code in decimal notation after a
    backslash. That is why you have to use '\\27' to initiate an escape sequence
    from Hollywood code.

    To illustrate this difference a little bit better, let us have a look at two
    examples. Here is an example for creating a bold text object in an XML file.
    Bold text is enabled by using the character 'b' after the escape character:

        <textview styled="true" id="mytext">\\33bBold text</textview>

    You can see that the octal notation is used here because XML files expect an
    octal number after a backslash. In Hollywood, however, it is different
    because Hollywood expects a decimal character after a backslash. So here is
    how you have to specify escape codes when using them from a Hollywood source
    file:

        moai.Set("mytext", "text", "\\27bBold text")

    You can see that the code is the same except that we use \\27b instead of
    \\33b because Hollywood always uses decimal instead of octal numbers after a
    backslash.

    The following formatting codes are currently supported:

    \\33u      Set the text style to underline.

    \\33b      Set the text style to bold.

    \\33i      Set the text style to italic.

    \\33n      Set the text style back to normal.

    \\33P[RRGGBB]
              Change front color to the specified RGB color. The RGB color has
              to be specified in the form of six hexadecimal digits RRGGBB. On
              AmigaOS and compatibles this requires MUI 4.0.

@NODE OnlineHelp "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Implementing help texts@{ub}

    RapaGUI supports several ways of implementing context-sensitive help texts
    in your applications. First of all, every widget can have tooltips that pop
    up after the mouse has been hovering over a widget for some time. This is
    done via the @{"Area.Tooltip" LINK AreaTooltip} attribute. As @{"Area class" LINK Area} is the super class for
    all widgets, you can use this attribute to add tooltip help to all your
    widgets. Here is an example:

        <vgroup>
           <listview tooltip="List of loaded video files">
              <column/>
           </listview>
           <button id="btn1" tooltip="Plays a video stream">Play</button>
           <button id="btn2" tooltip="Stops a video stream">Stop</button>
           <button id="btn3" tooltip="Exits the program.">Quit</button>
        </vgroup>

    Furthermore, menu items and toolbar buttons support the attributes
    @{"Menuitem.Help" LINK MenuitemHelp} and @{"Toolbarbutton.Help" LINK ToolbarbuttonHelp}, respectively. If your window has a
    status bar attached, then the text you specify in these attributes is
    automatically shown in the status bar whenever the mouse cursor is over the
    respective menu item or toolbar button. This kind of visual feedback is very
    helpful because it is shown immediately in the status bar and the user
    doesn't have to wait for a few seconds as it is the case with tooltips.

@ENDNODE

@NODE ContextMenus "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Context menus@{ub}

    RapaGUI supports context menus for each of its widget classes. Context menus
    are assigned to the individual widgets by using the @{"Area.ContextMenu" LINK AreaContextMenu}
    attribute. As @{"Area class" LINK Area} is the super-class for all widgets, you can use
    this attribute with every MOAI object that creates a widget. If you've
    declared @{"Area.ContextMenu" LINK AreaContextMenu} for a widget, RapaGUI will automatically show the
    context menu whenever the user clicks the right mouse button while the
    cursor is over a widget that has a context menu attached.

    @{"Area.ContextMenu" LINK AreaContextMenu} expects an object derived from @{"Menu class" LINK Menu} as its argument
    so you have to create such a menu MOAI object for your context menu in XML
    first. It is very important to note that you have to declare your menus in
    the <application> scope because menus are global objects and are only
    attached to windows or widgets later on. That is why it is not allowed to
    declare menus inside a <window> XML scope.

    Here is an example in which we add a cut, copy, and paste context menu to an
    object of type @{"Texteditor class" LINK Texteditor} :

        <menu title="Context menu" id="ctxtmenu">
           <item id="mni_cut">Cut</item>
           <item id="mni_copy">Copy</item>
           <item id="mni_paste">Paste</item>
        </menu>

        <window>
        ...
           <texteditor contextmenu="ctxtmenu"/>
        ...
        </window>

    Note that when using @{"Menu class" LINK Menu} to create context menus, the @{"Menu.Title" LINK MenuTitle}
    attribute is only used on AmigaOS and compatibles. Context menus on Windows,
    Linux, and macOS don't show a title.

    Also note that context menu events will be delivered via the standard
    @{"Menuitem.Selected" LINK MenuitemSelected} mechanism and not through a special context menu event
    handler. Since you can use the same menu object as a context menu for
    several widgets, you need a way to find out the widget whose context menu
    triggered the event. To give you this information, the event message will
    contain an additional item named "Parent" which contains the ID of the
    context menu's hosting widget. This allows you to re-use the same menu
    object as a context menu for multiple parent widgets.

    AmigaOS users please note that MUI doesn't allow context menu objects to be
    shared across windows. You are not allowed to use the same menu object with
    widgets in different windows. It's okay to re-use a menu object for several
    widgets in the same window but not for widgets in another window. All other
    platforms don't have this limitation, only AmigaOS is affected here.

@NODE I18N "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Internationalization@{ub}

    RapaGUI easily allows you to add internationalization (i18n) support to your
    applications because it seamlessly integrates with Hollywood's catalog
    system. Thus, all you have to do to support multiple languages in your
    application is create a catalog containing all language-dependent texts used
    by your program and open it at startup, for example using the "\@CATALOG"
    preprocessor command, e.g.

        \@CATALOG "MyApp.catalog"

    You can then address individual catalog entries by using either the
    @{"MOAI.I18N" LINK MOAII18N} attribute or the \@i18n: directive. All attributes that accept a
    string argument also accept the @{"MOAI.I18N" LINK MOAII18N} attribute which allows you to
    specify a catalog string index that should be used if a catalog for the
    user's system language is available. The string index can either be an
    absolute numeric value or a Hollywood constant. For example, to create a
    multi-lingual button you could do the following:

        <button i18n="0">Click me</button>

    With such XML code, the text "Click me" will only be used if the user's
    system language is English or RapaGUI can't find a catalog for the current
    system language. Otherwise, RapaGUI will use the string at index 0 in the
    catalog file instead of the default text "Click me".

    For for locale-dependent strings that are passed in tag attributes you have
    to use the \@i18n: directive. Just append this suffix to the string,
    followed by a numeric value or a Hollywood constant and Hollywood will use
    the specified catalog string instead if there's a catalog for the user's
    system language available. For example:

        <window title="My application\@i18n:1">...</window>

    In that example, RapaGUI will use the window title "My application" only if
    the user's system language is English or if RapaGUI can't find a catalog for
    the current system language. Otherwise, RapaGUI will use the string at index
    1 in the catalog file instead of the title "My application".

    As already pointed out, you can also use Hollywood constants instead of
    hard-coded numeric values. Using Hollywood constants might be more
    convenient to maintain your XML because it allows you to easily add and
    remove entries. Using Hollywood constants, the XML from above looks like
    this:

        <button i18n="#CAT_BUTTON">Click me</button>
        <window title="My application\@i18n:#CAT_TITLE">...</window>

    Note that all these internationalization features only apply to the XML. All
    changes that are made at runtime need to be handled manually, so you need to
    use Hollywood's "GetCatalogString()" function to obtain the correct catalog
    string when making locale-dependent changes to the GUI at runtime, e.g. by
    calling functions like @{"moai.Set()" LINK moaiSet}.

@NODE CharacterEncoding "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Character encoding@{ub}

    RapaGUI supports two character encodings in the XML files used to describe
    the GUI layout: iso-8859-1 and utf-8. If you use utf-8 encoding on AmigaOS
    and compatibles, RapaGUI will require codesets.library to do character
    conversion from UTF-8 to the system's default charset.

    Amiga users please note that MUI does not support UTF-8. MUI always uses the
    system's default charset. Thus, if you use UTF-8 encoding in your XML files,
    RapaGUI will try to map these strings to the system's default charset. This
    must not always succeed. For example, if the system's default charset is
    ISO-8859-1 and the UTF-8 XML file uses some Eastern European characters not
    present in ISO-8859-1 then they will not be displayed correctly. They will
    only be displayed correctly if the system's default charset has them as
    well.

@NODE HollywoodBridge "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Hollywood bridge@{ub}

    A powerful feature of RapaGUI is that it allows you to embed complete
    Hollywood displays inside your GUIs using @{"Hollywood class" LINK Hollywood}. Whenever you
    draw something to a Hollywood display that is attached to Hollywood class,
    it will automatically be drawn to your widget as well. You can even hide the
    Hollywood display so that the user does not even notice that Hollywood is
    running in the background. Furthermore, all mouse clicks and key strokes
    that happen inside Hollywood class will be forwarded to the corresponding
    Hollywood display as normal Hollywood events. Thus, Hollywood class allows
    you to use almost all of Hollywood's powerful features inside a GUI widget
    as well.

    Let's have a look at an example. The following code uses Hollywood class to
    embed a playing animation of size 320x200 inside a widget. For this, the
    Hollywood display's size is changed to 320x200 and then it is embedded in
    the GUI using a MOAI object of type @{"Hollywood class" LINK Hollywood}. Here is the XML GUI
    declaration first:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
        <application>
           <window title="Hollywood bridge">
              <vgroup>
                 <hgroup>
                    <rectangle/>
                    <hollywood display="1"/>
                    <rectangle/>
                 </hgroup>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button id="play">Play</button>
                    <button id="stop">Stop</button>
                 </hgroup>
              </vgroup>
           </window>
        </application>

    Note that we use MOAI objects of @{"Rectangle class" LINK Rectangle} to pad the non-resizable
    Hollywood object. This is necessary for the GUI to stay resizable. Here is
    the code now that shows you to connect your GUI widget and Hollywood:

        \@REQUIRE "RapaGUI"
        \@ANIM 1, "amy_walks.anim"
        \@DISPLAY {Width = 320, Height = 200}

        Function p_AnimFunc()
           Local numframes = GetAttribute(#ANIM, 1, #ATTRNUMFRAMES)
           curframe = Wrap(curframe + 1, 1, numframes + 1)
           DisplayAnimFrame(1, 0, 0, curframe)
        EndFunction

        Function p_EventFunc(msg)
           Switch msg.Class
           Case "Button":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Pressed":
                 Switch msg.ID
                 Case "play":
                    SetInterval(1, p_AnimFunc, 50)
                 Case "stop":
                    ClearInterval(1)
                 EndSwitch
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch
        EndFunction

        InstallEventHandler({RapaGUI = p_EventFunc})
        moai.CreateApp(FileToString("GUI.xml"))

        Repeat
           WaitEvent
        Forever

    With a little bit more work we can also make the anim movable with the
    mouse. The user can then click into the Hollywood object and drag the anim
    around using his mouse. Here is the code for that:

        \@REQUIRE "RapaGUI"
        \@ANIM 1, "amy_walks.anim"
        \@DISPLAY {Width = 320, Height = 200}

        Function p_AnimFunc()
           Local numframes = GetAttribute(#ANIM, 1, #ATTRNUMFRAMES)
           curframe = Wrap(curframe + 1, 1, numframes + 1)
           SelectBrush(1)
           Cls
           DisplayAnimFrame(1, offx, offy, curframe)
           EndSelect
           DisplayBrush(1, 0, 0)
        EndFunction

        Function p_MouseFunc()
           If IsLeftMouse() = True
             Local mx, my = MouseX(), MouseY()
             If (grabx = -1) And (graby = -1) Then
               grabx, graby = mx - offx, my - offy
             offx = mx - grabx
             offy = my - graby
           Else
             grabx, graby = -1, -1
           EndIf
        EndFunction

        Function p_EventFunc(msg)
           Switch msg.Class
           Case "Button":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Pressed":
                 Switch msg.ID
                 Case "play":
                    SetInterval(1, p_AnimFunc, 50)
                    SetInterval(2, p_MouseFunc, 20)
                 Case "stop":
                    ClearInterval(1)
                    ClearInterval(2)
                 EndSwitch
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch
        EndFunction

        CreateBrush(1, 320, 200)

        InstallEventHandler({RapaGUI = p_EventFunc})
        moai.CreateApp(FileToString("GUI.xml"))

        Repeat
           WaitEvent
        Forever

    Finally, it is also possible to make the Hollywood object resizable by
    setting the attributes @{"Area.FixWidth" LINK AreaFixWidth} and @{"Area.FixHeight" LINK AreaFixHeight} to FALSE. Whenever
    the user resizes the window, your Hollywood display will receive a
    SizeWindow event that you can listen to using the InstallEventHandler()
    Hollywood function. When using a resizable Hollywood object, we can remove
    the two <rectangle> objects used solely as padding space. The XML code looks
    like this then:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
        <application>
           <window title="Hollywood bridge">
              <vgroup>
                 <hollywood display="1" fixwidth="false" fixheight="false"/>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button id="play">Play</button>
                    <button id="stop">Stop</button>
                 </hgroup>
              </vgroup>
           </window>
        </application>

    Our code is pretty much the same as before with the exception that we now
    have to handle the SizeWindow event to take care of GUI resize events. Here
    is the adapted code from above:

        \@REQUIRE "RapaGUI"
        \@ANIM 1, "amy_walks.anim"
        \@DISPLAY {Width = 320, Height = 200}

        Function p_AnimFunc()
           Local numframes = GetAttribute(#ANIM, 1, #ATTRNUMFRAMES)
           curframe = Wrap(curframe + 1, 1, numframes + 1)
           SelectBrush(1)
           Cls
           DisplayAnimFrame(1, offx, offy, curframe,
             {Width = swidth, Height = sheight})
           EndSelect
           DisplayBrush(1, 0, 0)
        EndFunction

        Function p_MouseFunc()
           If IsLeftMouse() = True
             Local mx, my = MouseX(), MouseY()
             If (grabx = -1) And (graby = -1) Then
               grabx, graby = mx - offx, my - offy
             offx = mx - grabx
             offy = my - graby
           Else
             grabx, graby = -1, -1
           EndIf
        EndFunction

        Function p_EventFunc(msg)
           If msg.Action = "SizeWindow"
             swidth = msg.Width
             sheight = msg.Height
             CreateBrush(1, swidth, sheight)
             Return
           EndIf

           Switch msg.Class
           Case "Button":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Pressed":
                 Switch msg.ID
                 Case "play":
                    SetInterval(1, p_AnimFunc, 50)
                    SetInterval(2, p_MouseFunc, 20)
                 Case "stop":
                    ClearInterval(1)
                    ClearInterval(2)
                 EndSwitch
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch
        EndFunction

        swidth, sheight = 320, 200
        CreateBrush(1, swidth, sheight)

        InstallEventHandler({RapaGUI = p_EventFunc, SizeWindow = p_EventFunc})
        moai.CreateApp(FileToString("GUI.xml"))

        Repeat
           WaitEvent
        Forever

    From this example you can see that @{"Hollywood class" LINK Hollywood} is really powerful and
    can be used to achieve lots of innovative GUI ideas only limited by your
    creativity!

@NODE ImageCache "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Image cache@{ub}

    Many MOAI classes allow you to use icons with the widgets they create, e.g.
    you can add an icon to a button widget by simply using the @{"Button.Icon" LINK ButtonIcon}
    attribute. All MOAI classes that can deal with icons require you to pass
    either a Hollywood brush or a Hollywood icon that shall be used as the icon
    to the class.

    What is important to know now is that RapaGUI caches these images for
    reasons of performance and economy. Just imagine a listview with thousands
    of rows and an icon in each of them. It would be an absolute performance
    killer if RapaGUI had to convert these icons from a Hollywood brush/icon
    into a RapaGUI image for every single row. That's why the images are cached.

    Take a look at this example:

        <button id="ok" icon="1">OK</button>

    The declaration above puts Hollywood brush number 1 next to the text "OK" on
    the button's label. RapaGUI will now cache the image data of Hollywood brush
    number 1 internally and whenever there is a reference to Hollywood brush
    number 1 again, it will simply take the copy from its cache instead of the
    original one. This means that any changes you make to Hollywood brush number
    1 after the declaration above won't have any effect on RapaGUI at all
    because of its image cache! Please keep that in mind. You either have to use
    a brush identifier that is not in RapaGUI's image cache yet or you have to
    remove the brush from RapaGUI's image cache using the @{"moai.FreeImage()" LINK moaiFreeImage}
    function first. For listview and treeview widgets, it's also possible to use
    @{"moai.UpdateImage()" LINK moaiUpdateImage} instead.

    There is just one exception to the rule: Widgets derived from @{"Image class" LINK Image}
    don't cache any image data, although they deal with Hollywood brushes/icons
    as well. The reason for this is that image widgets often display pretty
    large images that could also be animated or changed many times. That's why
    it doesn't make sense to cache image data for widgets derived from @{"Image" LINK Image}
    @{"class" LINK Image}. Images used in other widgets, e.g. buttons, toolbar buttons,
    listviews, treeviews, pageviews, are usually very small and there is usually
    just a fixed number of them. On top of that, they might be needed very often
    - just think of a listview with thousands of rows and an icon in each of
    those rows - which is why an image cache is really necessary here to
    guarantee a good performance.

@NODE PlatformDependence "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Platform-dependent features@{ub}

    Generally speaking, RapaGUI tries to include as few platform-dependent
    features as possible to allow the same application to run on a wide variety
    of platforms without any adjustments. There are, however, very few
    attributes and methods that, although not available on all platforms, are
    still included because they were considered so important that they have been
    included although they somewhat contradict RapaGUI's platform-blind GUI
    toolkit approach. For example, the @{"Window.HideFromTaskbar" LINK WindowHideFromTaskbar} attribute is only
    available on Windows and GTK+ since there is no taskbar on AmigaOS and
    macOS. Another example is @{"Application.OpenConfigWindow" LINK ApplicationOpenConfigWindow} which is only
    available on AmigaOS and compatibles.

    Features which are platform-specific are always documented as such. You just
    need to look into the documentation to see if a certain feature is
    platform-specific. To minimize platform-specific code, all
    platform-dependent features can be specified on all platforms supported by
    RapaGUI as well. RapaGUI will just ignore the attributes and methods then
    instead of reporting an error message. Thus, you could also set
    @{"Window.HideFromTaskbar" LINK WindowHideFromTaskbar} on AmigaOS and macOS. RapaGUI won't report an error
    message. The call will simply be ignored.

@ENDNODE

@NODE MUIRoyaleCompat "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}MUI Royale compatibility@{ub}

    RapaGUI started as a fork of the popular MUI Royale plugin for Hollywood and
    people familiar with MUI Royale will no doubt see that RapaGUI shares the
    very same design so porting applications from MUI Royale to RapaGUI isn't
    particularly difficult. Although there have been many semantic changes to
    abstract RapaGUI from AmigaOS-based terminology, the real design differences
    are actually very few. Thus, when porting applications from MUI Royale to
    RapaGUI most of the time you will just be busy with changing names. Most
    people probably won't even encounter one of the very few design differences
    between MUI Royale and RapaGUI. Still, here is a non-exhaustive list of
    design differences between MUI Royale and RapaGUI to simplify your porting
    endeavours:

    - MUI Royale required you to handle @{"Window.CloseRequest" LINK WindowCloseRequest} for all your windows
      or they would stay open. RapaGUI automatically closes windows that haven't
      got a listener for @{"Window.CloseRequest" LINK WindowCloseRequest} installed.

    - MUI Royale also required you to handle the "HideWindow" and "ShowWindow"
      events to allow the minimizing of windows. RapaGUI handles this
      automatically now.

    - RapaGUI automatically sets up event handlers for buttons, toolbar buttons
      and menu items. MUI Royale required you to explicitly request them but
      this led to unnecessarily wordy XML files where you had to include
      something like notify="pressed" for each and every button because under
      normal circumstances you want to be notified about each button click.
      RapaGUI automatically calls your event handler for all button and toolbar
      button clicks and menu item events now to make the XML more readable.

    - RapaGUI automatically hides all Hollywood displays on startup whereas MUI
      Royale doesn't do this. On MUI Royale you manually have to declare the
      default display as hidden.

    - MUI Royale allows you to use text formatting codes almost everywhere.
      Since this is a highly MUI-centric feature, this is impossible to
      implement in a platform independent way. RapaGUI supports text formatting
      only in its @{"Textview" LINK Textview} and @{"Texteditor" LINK Texteditor} classes and only if @{"Textview.Styled" LINK TextviewStyled}
      and @{"Texteditor.Styled" LINK TexteditorStyled} have been set to TRUE.

    - MUI Royale also allowed you to include icons in almost all widgets via
      text formatting codes. This is also impossible to implement in a
      cross-platform way. Still, RapaGUI has icon support in many classes but
      the way this is implemented is always class dependent. On RapaGUI you can
      use icons with the following classes: @{"Button class" LINK Button}, @{"Listview class" LINK Listview},
      @{"Pageview class" LINK Pageview}, and @{"Treeview class" LINK Treeview}. Check out the documentation of these
      classes to learn more about how to use icons with them.

    - MUI Royale requires you to use an object derived from <virtgroup> class as
      the child for <scrollgroup> objects. On RapaGUI you can just use normal
      groups.

    - MUI Royale sends context menu events using the Area.ContextMenuTrigger
      attribute. RapaGUI simply sends context menu events as normal menu item
      events but it includes a "Parent" field in the event message to inform you
      about the widget whose context menu triggered the event.

    - RapaGUI's @{"Checkbox class" LINK Checkbox} class creates a checkbox and a text label. MUI
      Royale's checkmark class simply creates a checkbox image and you have to
      create the label yourself.

    - RapaGUI doesn't have support for the Listview.InsertPosition attribute but
      its @{"Listview.Insert" LINK ListviewInsert} method simply returns the position of the newly
      inserted entry.

    - In MUI Royale text editor ranges were indicated by block coordinates
      consisting of four different values (x1, y1, x2, y2). RapaGUI just uses
      start and stop coordinates now, so all the methods and attributes that
      deal with text ranges just require/return two arguments now.

    - RapaGUI's @{"Texteditor class" LINK Texteditor}, @{"Textview class" LINK Textview}, and @{"Textentry class" LINK Textentry} use the
      content between the opening and closing XML tags as the initial widget
      contents whereas MUI Royale always required you to use an attribute to set
      the initial contents.

    - RapaGUI requires you to specify a parent object most of the times when
      creating objects dynamically using @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject}. This wasn't
      necessary in MUI Royale.

    - Since RapaGUI's @{"Treeview class" LINK Treeview} supports multiple columns, you have to
      create at least one <column> when declaring your treeview in XML. This
      wasn't needed with MUI Royale because its treeview class merely supports
      single column trees.

    - MUI Royale doesn't have the concept of dialogs since AmigaOS doesn't have
      it either. Modal dialogs were just emulated using normal windows and
      putting all other windows to sleep. RapaGUI now introduces real dialogs.
      While with MUI Royale you would typically create all those pseudo-dialogs
      at startup, this is no longer recommended with RapaGUI. Since windows are
      quite a finite resource on some operating systems, you should create
      dialogs only when you need them and destroy them immediately afterwards.
      See @{"Dialog class" LINK Dialog} for details. If you only target AmigaOS, then you can of
      course still create all your windows with just a single call to
      @{"moai.CreateApp()" LINK moaiCreateApp} but if you want to target other operating systems as
      well, you should follow the recommended programming guidelines and create
      dialogs when you need them and destroy them as soon as you are finished
      with them.

    - Objects of @{"Radio class" LINK Radio} are always framed in RapaGUI. In MUI Royale they
      aren't framed by default.

    - When using a somewhat more complex shortcut string like CTRL+V, Alt+X or
      F5 with Menuitem.CommandString, MUI Royale doesn't automatically listen to
      it. This has to be implemented manually. Only standard shortcuts in the
      form of a single alphabetical key combined with the CMD key are handled
      automatically by MUI Royale. RapaGUI, however, automatically handles
      complex shortcuts as well.

    - When getting @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} and no entry is active, MUI Royale returns
      the special string Off whereas RapaGUI returns -1.

    Of course, there are also many attributes and methods that are present in
    MUI Royale but missing in RapaGUI. The reason for this is of course that
    because of its cross-platform design RapaGUI represents the lowest common
    denominator between Windows, Linux, macOS, and AmigaOS. That's why not all
    MUI Royale features could be transferred to RapaGUI.

    Welcome to the RapaGUI tutorial! This small step-by-step document will guide
    you through the process of creating your first GUI with RapaGUI in very few
    steps. We will create a little GUI application that consists of a listview,
    a text entry widget, and two buttons. The two buttons should be programmed
    to allow the addition and removal of items from the listview. The data to be
    inserted into the listview should be taken from the text entry widget. Here
    is what this little application looks like on Windows:

    See image: @{"tutorial.png" LINK "Guide/tutorial.png/MAIN"}

    Let us start with the basics: In RapaGUI GUIs are created using XML files
    that contain a description of a number of windows containing a variety of
    GUI elements. Here is a minimal GUI description for a RapaGUI GUI that
    contains a window with a listview, a text entry widget, and two buttons in
    XML format:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
        <application>
           <window title="Example GUI">
              <vgroup>
                 <listview>
                    <column/>
                 </listview>
                 <textentry/>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button id="add">Add</button>
                    <button id="rem">Remove</button>
                 </hgroup>
              </vgroup>
           </window>
        </application>

    The <application> object is the master MOAI object for every application and
    must only be used once per application. All other MOAI objects are children
    of @{"Application class" LINK Application}. The root element of every <window> object must be
    derived from @{"Group class" LINK Group}, i.e. it must be either <vgroup>, <hgroup>, or
    <colgroup>. Also note that there must be only one root element per window.

    To see how our XML declaration above looks as a GUI, we have to save it to a
    file named GUI.xml and then use the following code to make RapaGUI convert
    it to a native GUI for the operating system Hollywood is running on:

        \@REQUIRE "RapaGUI"

        moai.CreateApp(FileToString("GUI.xml"))

        Repeat
           WaitEvent
        Forever

    Next you should add some information about your program using the
    \@APPAUTHOR, \@APPCOPYRIGHT, \@APPDESCRIPTION, \@APPTITLE, and \@APPVERSION
    preprocessor commands. RapaGUI needs this information for several purposes,
    e.g. the information passed in \@APPTITLE is used by the MUI preferences
    window on AmigaOS and compatibles. Here is an example declaration of these
    preprocessor commands:

        \@APPTITLE "Tutorial"
        \@APPVERSION "$VER: Tutorial 1.0 (29.12.15)"
        \@APPCOPYRIGHT "Copyright ©2015, Andreas Falkenhahn"
        \@APPAUTHOR "Andreas Falkenhahn"
        \@APPDESCRIPTION "The tutorial app from the RapaGUI guide"

    The next thing we have to do is install an event handler callback using the
    InstallEventHandler() Hollywood function because our Hollywood script needs
    to be informed every time a RapaGUI event comes in. Thus, we have to modify
    our code as follows:

        \@REQUIRE "RapaGUI"

        Function p_EventFunc(msg)
           ; contents follow below
        EndFunction

        InstallEventHandler({RapaGUI = p_EventFunc})
        moai.CreateApp(FileToString("GUI.xml"))

        Repeat
           WaitEvent
        Forever

    What we have done here is installing the function p_EventFunc as an event
    handler callback that gets executed whenever a RapaGUI event comes in. When
    we get such an event, we then have to check which MOAI class and attribute
    has triggered it. This is done by looking into the msg.Class and
    msg.Attribute fields of the event message that our callback receives as its
    first parameter.

    The next thing we want to do is add the functionality that whenever the user
    presses the "Add" button the text in the text entry widget should get added
    to the listview as the last entry. To do this, we first have to find a way
    of identifying our widgets from the Hollywood script. This is done by giving
    them IDs in the XML declaration. IDs are simply text strings that are used
    for talking to MOAI objects from Hollywood scripts. So let's add some IDs
    now for all widgets that we need to talk to. We have to modify our XML
    declaration like this:

        ...
                 <listview id="mylistview">
                    <column/>
                 </listview>
                 <textentry id="mystring"/>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button id="mybt1">Add</button>
                    <button id="mybt2">Remove</button>
                 </hgroup>
        ...

    Now that we have done this we can add some code to our event handler
    callback that grabs the contents of the text entry widget and adds it to the
    end of the list in our listview object. This is done by first calling
    @{"moai.Get()" LINK moaiGet} on the @{"Textentry.Text" LINK TextentryText} attribute to get the contents of the string
    widget and then running the method @{"Listview.Insert" LINK ListviewInsert} on the listview widget
    using @{"moai.DoMethod()" LINK moaiDoMethod} to insert the entry into the listview. Here is the
    code that has to be inserted into p_EventFunc for this purpose:

           Switch msg.Class
           ...
           Case "Button":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Pressed":
                 Switch msg.ID
                 Case "mybt1":    ; "Add" button was pressed
                    Local s$ = moai.Get("mystring", "text")
                    moai.DoMethod("mylistview", "insert", "bottom", s$)
                 EndSwitch
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch

    The next thing we want to do is implement the functionality of our "Remove"
    button. Whenever this button is pressed, we want the active entry to be
    removed from the listview. We can do this by running the @{"Listview.Remove" LINK ListviewRemove}
    method on the listview. Hence, we have to modify our code like this:

                 Switch msg.ID
                 ...
                 Case "mybt2":    ; "Remove" button was pressed
                    moai.DoMethod("mylistview", "remove", "active")
                 EndSwitch

    Now we want the active entry of the listview to be automatically displayed
    in the text entry widget. For this purpose we have to set up a notification
    on the @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute which is triggered whenever the active
    entry of the listview changes. Thus, we have to modify our XML file like
    this:

        ...
                 <listview id="mylistview" notify="active">
                    <column/>
                 </listview>
        ...

    In our event handler callback we can implement this functionality quite
    easily by running the @{"Listview.GetEntry" LINK ListviewGetEntry} method and then setting the text
    entry widgets contents using the @{"Textentry.Text" LINK TextentryText} attribute. Here is the code
    for doing that:

           Switch msg.Class
           ...
           Case "Listview":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Active":
                 Local s$ = moai.DoMethod("mylistview", "getentry", "active")
                 moai.Set("mystring", "text", s$)
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch

    If you try this code, you will set that the @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute is not
    only triggered when the user selects a new listview entry with his mouse,
    but also when entries are removed from the listview and thus cause a new
    entry becoming the active one.

    The next thing we want to do is disable the "Remove" button when there is no
    active entry in the listview. We can disable widgets by setting the
    @{"Area.Disabled" LINK AreaDisabled} attribute to TRUE. As there are no entries in the listview
    initially, we have to set @{"Area.Disabled" LINK AreaDisabled} to TRUE already at the start of our
    program. So you have to insert this code:

        ...
        moai.CreateApp(FileToString("GUI.xml"))
        moai.Set("mybt2", "disabled", True)
        ...

    Now we have to make some modifications to our event handler callback.
    Whenever we get the notification on @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} we have to check if it
    is different from the special value "Off". If that is the case, we will
    enable the "Remove" button. The special value "Off" (-1) is returned by
    @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} whenever there is no active entry in the listview. We have
    to modify our code like this:

           Switch msg.Class
           ...
           Case "Listview":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Active":
                 Local s$ = moai.DoMethod("mylistview", "getentry", "active")
                 moai.Set("mystring", "text", s$)
                 moai.Set("mybt2", "disabled", IIf(msg.triggervalue = -1,
                     True, False))
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch

    We use the field msg.TriggerValue here. This always contains the current
    value of the attribute that has triggered the event, i.e. in our case it
    contains the current value of the @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute. We could also
    call @{"moai.Get()" LINK moaiGet} manually on @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} first, but this is not really
    required because we can simply use the msg.TriggerValue shortcut.

    The last thing we want to do is add a menu to our GUI. All RapaGUI programs
    should have a menu item informs the user that this program was done using
    RapaGUI. You can popup the this dialog by running the
    @{"Application.AboutRapaGUI" LINK ApplicationAboutRapaGUI} method on the application object. To add this menu
    to our program, we use @{"Menubar class" LINK Menubar}. Here is the XML code that you have to
    add before your window declaration:

        ...
        <application>
           <menubar id="mymenubar">
              <menu title="File">
                 <item id="menabout">About...</item>
                 <item id="menaboutrapagui">About RapaGUI...</item>
                 <item/>
                 <item id="menquit">Quit</item>
              </menu>
           </menubar>
           ...
        </application>

    After we have created our menubar object using the XML code above we have to
    attach this menubar to our window. This is done by setting the
    @{"Window.Menubar" LINK WindowMenubar} attribute to our menubar object. Here is the XML code for
    this:

        <window title="Example GUI" menubar="mymenubar">

    Now we have to add code to our event handler function that takes the
    appropriate action when a menu item is selected. Before we can do that,
    however, we need to assign an ID to our application object because we need
    to use @{"moai.DoMethod()" LINK moaiDoMethod} on it. Here is how the XML code needs to be adapted:

        <application id="app">

    Now we can write the code for our event handler callback function that
    handles menu items:

           Switch msg.Class
           ...
           Case "Menuitem":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Selected":
                 Switch msg.id
                 Case "menabout":
                    moai.Request("Test", "Test program\\n" ..
                        "© 2015 by Andreas Falkenhahn", "OK")
                 Case "menaboutrapagui":
                    moai.DoMethod("app", "aboutrapagui")
                 Case "menquit":
                    End
                 EndSwitch
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch

    Some final touches to our program could be adding online help to our widgets
    by using the @{"Area.Tooltip" LINK AreaTooltip} and @{"Menuitem.Help" LINK MenuitemHelp} attributes, adding a status bar,
    and adding keyboard shortcuts for the menu items using the underscore
    character. These changes are left as an exercise for the reader.

    So here is what our final program looks like. First the XML file:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
        <application id="app">
           <menubar id="mymenubar">
              <menu title="File">
                 <item id="menabout">About...</item>
                 <item id="menaboutrapagui">
                    About RapaGUI...</item>
                 <item/>
                 <item id="menquit">Quit</item>
              </menu>
           </menubar>
           <window title="Example GUI" menubar="mymenubar">
              <vgroup>
                <listview id="mylistview" notify="active">
                    <column/>
                 </listview>
                 <textentry id="mystring"/>
                 <hgroup>
                    <button id="mybt1">Add</button>
                    <button id="mybt2">Remove</button>
                 </hgroup>
              </vgroup>
           </window>
        </application>

    And here is the code for the program logic:

        \@REQUIRE "RapaGUI"

        \@APPTITLE "Tutorial"
        \@APPVERSION "$VER: Tutorial 1.0 (29.12.15)"
        \@APPCOPYRIGHT "Copyright ©2015, Andreas Falkenhahn"
        \@APPAUTHOR "Andreas Falkenhahn"
        \@APPDESCRIPTION "The tutorial app from the RapaGUI guide"

        Function p_EventFunc(msg)

           Switch msg.Class
           Case "Button":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Pressed":
                 Switch msg.ID
                 Case "mybt1":    ; "Add" button was pressed
                    Local s$ = moai.Get("mystring", "text")
                    moai.DoMethod("mylistview", "insert", "bottom", s$)
                 Case "mybt2":    ; "Remove" button was pressed
                    moai.DoMethod("mylistview", "remove", "active")
                 EndSwitch
              EndSwitch

           Case "Listview":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Active":
                 Local s$ = moai.DoMethod("mylistview", "getentry", "active")
                 moai.Set("mystring", "text", s$)
                 moai.Set("mybt2", "disabled", IIf(msg.triggervalue = -1,
                     True, False))
              EndSwitch

           Case "Menuitem":
              Switch msg.Attribute
              Case "Selected":
                 Switch msg.id
                 Case "menabout":
                    moai.Request("Test", "Test program\\n" ..
                        "© 2015 by Andreas Falkenhahn", "OK")
                 Case "menaboutrapagui":
                    moai.DoMethod("app", "aboutrapagui")
                 Case "menquit":
                    End
                 EndSwitch
              EndSwitch
           EndSwitch

        EndFunction

        InstallEventHandler({RapaGUI = p_EventFunc})
        moai.CreateApp(FileToString("GUI.xml"))
        moai.Set("mybt2", "disabled", True)

        Repeat
           WaitEvent
        Forever

    That's it! Now you should be able to create fantastic new GUI programs with
    Hollywood and RapaGUI. Thank you for reading this tutorial and enjoy the

@ENDNODE

@NODE moaiCreateApp "RapaGUI Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        moai.CreateApp -- create application object from an XML source

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        moai.CreateApp(xml$)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function creates an application from the XML description passed in
        the "xml$" argument. Please note that "xml$" must be a string that
        contains the XML GUI declaration and not a filename. If you want to use
        an XML GUI declaration from an external file, you have to convert that
        file into a string first, e.g. using the FileToString() Hollywood
        function.

        Once this function returns, you can talk to all your MOAI objects that

        Please note that there can be only one application object per task so
        this function can only be called once. If you want to call
        moai.CreateApp() a second time, you have to free the old GUI first using
        the @{"moai.FreeApp()" LINK moaiFreeApp} call.

        If you need to dynamically add objects like windows or buttons to your
        application object, you can use the @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject} function to do
        this. For dialogs you can use the @{"moai.CreateDialog()" LINK moaiCreateDialog} function.

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        moai.CreateDialog(xml$[, parent$])

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to dynamically create a dialog object from an
        XML source. The newly created dialog object will also be automatically
        attached to your application so that it is ready for instant use. You
        should also specify a parent window for your dialog using the optional
        argument.

        moai.CreateDialog() is very important because you should create dialogs
        only when you need them and destroy them as soon as you are finished
        with them. It is not advised to create all your dialogs on startup using
        @{"moai.CreateApp()" LINK moaiCreateApp} and keep them in memory all the time. Instead, you
        should use this function to create a dialog when you need it and then
        have it destroyed as soon as you are finished with it. The reason for
        this is that windows are quite a finite resource on some operating
        systems supported by RapaGUI. For example, on Windows there is a limit
        of about 10,000 windows per process. That might sound like sufficiently
        enough but keep in mind that on Windows every widget is a "window" for
        the operating system, e.g. every label, button, frame, checkbox, group,
        etc. in your application is a window so you should take care that you
        create your dialogs only as needed using moai.CreateDialog() and destroy
        them right afterwards.

        In practice, it is advised to create a separate XML file for each of
        your dialogs and then use this function to convert the XML file into a
        dialog at runtime and have the dialog destroyed automatically by RapaGUI
        as soon as the user closes it.

        Technically speaking, this function is just a convenience function which
        internally calls @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject} and then adds the newly created
        object to the application object by calling @{"Application.AddWindow" LINK ApplicationAddWindow}.
        moai.CreateDialog() simply combines these two steps into one.

        See @{"Dialog class" LINK Dialog} for more information on dialogs.

@NODE moaiCreateObject "RapaGUI Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        moai.CreateObject -- create MOAI object from an XML source

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        moai.CreateObject(xml$[, parent$])

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to dynamically create a MOAI object from an
        XML source. When moai.CreateObject() returns, the newly created MOAI
        object won't be attached to any parent object and will live in a state
        of isolation from your application object created by @{"moai.CreateApp()" LINK moaiCreateApp}.
        Thus, to break this state of isolation you first have to attach the
        object to a parent object which can be either a group object, a menu
        object, or an application object. If your newly allocated MOAI object is
        a window object, you will have to to attach it to the application object
        by using the @{"Application.AddWindow" LINK ApplicationAddWindow} method. To attach menu objects you
        have to use the @{"Menubar.Prepend" LINK MenubarPrepend}, @{"Menubar.Append" LINK MenubarAppend}, @{"Menubar.Insert" LINK MenubarInsert},
        @{"Menu.Prepend" LINK MenuPrepend}, @{"Menu.Append" LINK MenuAppend}, or @{"Menu.Insert" LINK MenuInsert} methods. All other objects
        can be attached by using the group methods @{"Group.Prepend" LINK GroupPrepend}, @{"Group.Append" LINK GroupAppend}
        and @{"Group.Insert" LINK GroupInsert}.

        For most MOAI classes you have to specify a parent object in the second
        parameter. RapaGUI won't attach the new object to the parent but it
        still needs to know the parent for determining certain settings. The
        only MOAI classes which do not require you to specify a parent object
        are the following:

        - Window class
        - Dialog class
        - Menubar class
        - Menu class
        - Menuitem class

        All other MOAI classes require you to specify the identifier of the
        parent object.

        Normally, you just have to pass the identifier of the window that you
        want to attach the MOAI object to as the parent. There is one exception:
        If you plan to add the MOAI object to a group with a frame, i.e. an
        instance of @{"Group class" LINK Group} with @{"Group.Frame" LINK GroupFrame} set to TRUE, then you have to
        pass this group object as the parent. Note that this only applies to
        groups with a frame. If you plan to add the MOAI object to a normal
        group that doesn't have a frame, you just have to pass the identifier of
        the window to moai.CreateObject(). Note, though, that in case the normal
        group is itself just a child embedded somewhere in the hierarchy of a
        framed group, then you have to pass the identifier of the framed group.
        Also, when adding objects to scrollgroups, you need to pass the
        scrollgroup as the parent.

        To put it in abstract terms: The parent must be set to the next object
        in the layout hierarchy that has a visual representation. Normal groups
        are just layout tools, they don't exist as widgets. Framed groups,
        however, are layout tools but they are also widgets since they have a
        visual representation. Thus, if your object is going to be embedded
        somewhere in a framed group, the framed group must be passed as the
        parent. If it is embedded in a normal group, then the top-level window
        must be the parent. Don't forget to think in hierarchies: Even if you
        want to attach your object to a normal group it could still be the case
        that the normal group is itself embedded in a framed group which means
        that you would still have to pass the framed group as the parent. The
        same applies to scrollgroups since they also have a visual
        representation.

        In contrast to @{"moai.CreateApp()" LINK moaiCreateApp} you can call moai.CreateObject() as
        often as you like as it doesn't create an application object for you but
        just detached MOAI objects of which you can have as many as you like.

        It is important that you specify an ID for your MOAI object in the XML
        declaration because you need this ID to refer to this object when you
        want to add it to an application, menu or group object.

        Once this function returns, you can talk to the newly created MOAI
        object (and to all of its children) using the @{"moai.Set()" LINK moaiSet}, @{"moai.Get()" LINK moaiGet}
        and @{"moai.DoMethod()" LINK moaiDoMethod} functions.

        Detached MOAI objects can be freed using the @{"moai.FreeObject()" LINK moaiFreeObject} function
        but you only have to call this in specific cases, e.g. if you are
        dealing with lots of dynamically allocated MOAI objects and you want to
        do some housekeeping to save on memory and resources.

        moai.DoMethod("app", "addwindow", "newwindow")
        moai.Set("newwindow", "open", True)

        object and opens it.

        moai.DoMethod("mygroup", "append", "newbutton")

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to run a method on the specified MOAI object.
        You have to pass the identifier of the MOAI object in the first argument
        and the name of the method in the second argument. Method and object IDs
        are case insensitive, i.e. it does not matter if you use upper or lower

        The methods that you can use with this function depend on the class of
        the specified MOAI object. Have a look at the class reference to see
        what methods are supported by the different MOAI classes.

        Also, the arguments that you have to pass to this function after the
        method name depend on the method. They are different for every method.
        The same is true for return values. Some methods return values, some do

        This function can be used to delete a dialog object created by

        destruction, you can use this function, though.

        moai.FreeDialog() will first detach the dialog from the application

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to free an image in RapaGUI's internal cache.
        You have to pass the identifier of the image that should be freed in
        "id". If the optional "isicon" argument is set to TRUE, "id" must be the
        identifier of a Hollywood icon to free. Otherwise, "id" must be the
        identifier of a Hollywood brush that should be freed. Alternatively, you
        can also pass -1 in "id" to free all images in RapaGUI's internal cache.

        You must make sure that the specified image is no longer used by any
        widgets in your GUI before you call this function. Note that under
        normal conditions it is not necessary to call this function because
        normally all cached images are freed automatically by RapaGUI. Under
        certain conditions, however, it can be useful to call this function.

        RapaGUI caches all images that you use in your GUI. That is why when you
        try to use a certain image in your GUI a second time, it will just be
        loaded from RapaGUI's internal image cache for performance reasons. This
        can lead to unwanted behaviour in case you have updated your image's
        graphics in the meantime and you want RapaGUI to use the updated
        graphics. In that case, you first have to free the image in RapaGUI's
        internal image cache by using this function. When you pass the image to
        RapaGUI again then, it will be re-created from the image's current
        contents and it will be cached anew. For listview and treeview widgets,
        you can also use @{"moai.UpdateImage()" LINK moaiUpdateImage} to update the graphics data of an
        image.

        See @{"Image cache" LINK ImageCache} for details.

        object that you specify here must not be attached to an application,
        group, or menu object any longer because attached MOAI objects are freed
        with their parent so make sure you only use this function with MOAI
        objects that have been detached from their parent and are no longer
        bound to any parent object.

        To detach MOAI objects from their respective parents, you have to use
        one of the following methods: @{"Application.RemoveWindow" LINK ApplicationRemoveWindow}, @{"Menubar.Remove" LINK MenubarRemove},
        @{"Menu.Remove" LINK MenuRemove} or @{"Group.Remove" LINK GroupRemove}.

        When RapaGUI exits, it will automatically free all detached MOAI objects

        Separate the buttons specified in "buts$" by a "|". The return value
        tells you which button the user pressed. Please note that the rightmost
        button always has the value of FALSE (0) because it is typically used as
        the "Cancel" button. If you have for example three button choices
        "One|Two|Three", the button "Three" has return value 0, "Two" returns 2,
        and "One" returns 1.

        The optional argument "icon$" can be set to one of the following
        predefined values:

        "None":   no icon

        "Information":
                  an information sign

        moai.Set -- set value of a MOAI object attribute

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        moai.Set(id$, attr1$, val1$, ...)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to set the current value of one or more
        attributes in the MOAI object specified in id$. You have to pass the
        attribute name and desired new value for every attribute you want to
        modify. You can repeat these attribute/value pairs as often as you like
        to modify multiple attributes with just a single call to moai.Set().
        Attribute names and object IDs are case insensitive, i.e. it does not
        matter if you use upper or lower case characters for them.

        The attributes that you can use with this function depend on the class
        of the specified MOAI object. Have a look at the class reference to see
        what attributes are supported by the different MOAI classes. In order to
        use an attribute with this function, it needs to have an applicability
        of "S". Attributes of @{"Area class" LINK Area} and @{"MOAI class" LINK MOAI} can be used on almost
        all other classes because the Area and MOAI classes act as superclasses
        for most of the other classes.

        If you have setup a notification on the attribute that you want to
        modify using this function, the notification will be triggered once you
        call moai.Set() on that attribute. If you do not want this behaviour,
        you can use the @{"MOAI.NoNotify" LINK MOAINoNotify} attribute to prevent a notification from
        being issued.

   @{b}INPUTS@{ub}
        id$       identifier of MOAI object to modify
        attr1$    attribute whose value should be modified

        ...       you can repeat attribute/value pairs as often as you like

   @{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}
        moai.Set("my_listview", "active", 15)

        The code above sets entry number 15 as currently active entry in the

        @{"Listview.Active" LINK ListviewActive} attribute.

        ---

        moai.Set("my_listview", "nonotify", True, "active", 15)

        This code does the same as the code above but prevents notifications
        from being issued by setting the @{"MOAI.NoNotify" LINK MOAINoNotify} attribute to TRUE. This
        is useful if you need to distinguish between user selections in the
        listview and selections made programmatically using moai.Set().

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function can be used to update the graphics data of an image in
        RapaGUI's internal cache. You have to pass the identifier of the image
        that should be updated in "id". The optional parameter "isicon"
        specifies if the cached image is a Hollywood brush or icon. The new
        graphics data for the image will also be taken from the Hollywood brush
        or icon specified by "id".

        Note that this function is currently only compatible with listview and
        treeview widgets. You cannot use it to update the graphics of icons in
        other widgets, e.g. icons in a button widget. After updating the
        graphics data of an icon in a listview or treeview widget, you also need
        to make sure that all rows that use that icon are refreshed. You can do
        that by using the @{"Listview.Rename" LINK ListviewRename} or @{"Treeviewleaf.SetItem" LINK TreeviewleafSetItem} methods, for
        example.

        See @{"Image cache" LINK ImageCache} for details.

@NODE Accelerator "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Accelerator class can be used to set up global keyboard shortcuts for a
    window. Normal keyboard shortcuts defined by using the underscore character
    are handled automatically by RapaGUI. See @{"Keyboard shortcuts" LINK Shortcuts} for details.
    However, sometimes you might want to use more complex keyboard shortcuts,
    e.g. you might want to listen to the escape key, function keys, certain
    control keys or key combinations (e.g. CTRL+V for paste). This is possible
    by using Accelerator class.

    Accelerator class allows you to set up a table of keyboard shortcuts which
    can then be assigned to a window by using the @{"Window.Accelerator" LINK WindowAccelerator} attribute
    to make those shortcuts globally available in the respective window. Each
    accelerator table must contain at least one child of type @{"Acceleratoritem" LINK Acceleratoritem}
    @{"class" LINK Acceleratoritem} defining a single shortcut.

    Here is an example of how to set up an accelerator table in XML:

        <accelerator>
           <item id="ac_cut" mod="ctrl">X</item>
           <item id="ac_copy" mod="ctrl">C</item>
           <item id="ac_paste" mod="ctrl">V</item>
           <item id="ac_f1">F1</item>
        </accelerator>

    The accelerator table declared above sets up four different shortcuts:
    CTRL+X, CTRL+C, CTRL+V and F1. Whenever the user presses such a key or key
    combination, the @{"Acceleratoritem.Pressed" LINK AcceleratoritemPressed} notification will be triggered and
    your application can then react on it.

    Note that if you intend to link your accelerator items to menu items, you
    don't have to use Accelerator class at all. In that case you can just use
    the @{"Menuitem.Shortcut" LINK MenuitemShortcut} attribute to set up shortcuts for your menu items.
    Accelerator class is really only necessary if you need to listen to keyboard
    events without having any menu items involved.

    Accelerator class doesn't define any attributes or methods itself. See
    @{"Acceleratoritem class" LINK Acceleratoritem} for all necessary information.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Acceleratoritem "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Acceleratoritem class is used to create an individual keyboard shortcut as
    part of an accelerator table for @{"Accelerator class" LINK Accelerator}. You cannot create
    independent instances of Acceleratoritem class. They always need to be
    embedded inside Accelerator class. See @{"Accelerator class" LINK Accelerator} for details.

    The following keys can currently be specified when creating an accelerator
    item using the <item> XML tag:

    'UP'      Cursor up
    'DOWN'    Cursor down
    'RIGHT'   Cursor right
    'LEFT'    Cursor left
    'HELP'    Help key
    'DEL'     Delete key
    'BACKSPACE'
              Backspace key
    'TAB'     Tab key
    'RETURN'  Return key
    'ENTER'   Enter key
    'ESC'     Escape
    'SPACE'   Space key
    'F1 - F16'
              Function keys
    'INSERT'  Insert key
    'HOME'    Home key
    'END'     End key
    'PAGEUP'  Page up key
    'PAGEDOWN'
              Page down key
    'PRINT'   Print key
    'PAUSE'   Pause key

    Furthermore, Acceleratoritem class supports the English alphabet characters
    from A to Z as well as the numbers 0 to 9 as key specifications. It doesn't
    matter whether you specify all these keys in upper, lower or mixed case. See
    @{"Accelerator class" LINK Accelerator} for an example.

        Acceleratoritem.Mod -- set modifier key(s)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This attribute allows you to specify the modifier key(s) for this
        accelerator item. This can be a combination of the following predefined
        values:

        None      Don't use any modifier key. This is the default.

        Ctrl      Add the control key to the modifier keys.

        Alt       Add the alt key to the modifier keys.

        Cmd       Add the command key to the modifier keys. This is only
                  supported on macOS and AmigaOS.

        Shift     Add the shift key to the modifier keys.

        If you specify more than one modifier key, you have to separate the
        individual keys by a semicolon, e.g. "ctrl;shift".

        When using modifier keys, the keyboard shortcut will only trigger if the
        modifier key(s) and the main key are both down. This is useful for
        monitoring key combinations like CTRL+V for pasting data, etc.

@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Area class is the super class of every MOAI class that creates objects which
    have a visual representation within a window. As such it allows you to
    manage several generic attributes like object visibility (shown or hidden),
    state (enabled or disabled), tooltips, and context menus. Children which are
    derived from Area class are usually called widgets (a portmanteau of
    "window" and "gadget"). Area class can also provide you with information
    about a widget's position and size as well as other details belonging to its
    visual representation within a window.

    Note that objects deriving from @{"Group class" LINK Group} aren't children of Area class
    since @{"Group class" LINK Group} just creates groups of widgets but isn't a widget itself,
    but just a layout tool.

@NODE AreaContextMenu "RapaGUI Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        Area.ContextMenu -- set context menu for object

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Set this attribute to an identifier of a MOAI object derived from @{"Menu" LINK Menu}
        @{"class" LINK Menu} and the respective object will get a context menu. Whenever the
        user presses the right mouse button on the respective object, the
        context menu will be shown.

        Also note that context menu events will then be delivered via the
        standard @{"Menuitem.Selected" LINK MenuitemSelected} mechanism and not through a special context
        menu event handler. Since you can use the same menu object on several
        widgets, you need a way to find out the widget whose context menu
        triggered the event. To give you this information, the event message
        will contain an additional item named "Parent" which contains the ID of
        the context menu's hosting widget. This allows you to re-use the same
        menu object as a context menu for multiple parent widgets.

        Starting with RapaGUI 2.0 you can also set up a notification on the
        attribute. In that case, your event handler will be called immediately
        before RapaGUI shows the context menu. You can then return either FALSE
        for no context menu or use @{"moai.Set()" LINK moaiSet} on Area.ContextMenu to set the
        context menu that should be shown. This is very useful for customizing
        the context menu depending on where the right mouse button has been
        clicked. The position will be passed to your event handler. In case you
        are listening to Area.ContextMenu, your event handler will also be
        passed some additional information depending on the context menu's
        parent widget. Here is an overview of those additional message fields:

        X         X coordinate of mouse click.

        Y         Y coordinate of mouse click.

        CursorPos Cursor index at the position where the user clicked. This is
                  only set for widgets of type @{"Texteditor class" LINK Texteditor}.

        Row       Row at the position of the mouse click or -1 if there is no
                  row at the click position. This is only set for widgets of
                  type @{"Listview class" LINK Listview}.

        Column    Column at the position of the mouse click or -1 if there is no
                  column at the click position. This is only set for widgets of
                  type @{"Listview class" LINK Listview}.

        Item      Treeview item at the position of the mouse click or -1 if
                  there is no item at the click position. This is only set for
                  widgets of type @{"Treeview class" LINK Treeview}.

        AmigaOS users please note that MUI doesn't allow context menu objects to
        be shared across windows. You are not allowed to use the same menu
        object with widgets in different windows. It's okay to re-use a menu
        object for several widgets in the same window but not for widgets in
        another window. All other platforms don't have this limitation, only
        AmigaOS is affected here.

        To remove a context menu completely, pass the special string "(none)" to
        this attribute.

        See @{"Context menus" LINK ContextMenus} for an example.

@NODE Busybar "RapaGUI Guide"

    Busybar class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and creates a widget which shows an

    animation, however, just shows activity but no progress. If you would like
    to visualize progress, use @{"Progressbar class" LINK Progressbar} instead. See @{"Progressbar class" LINK Progressbar}
    for details.

    Once you've created an object of Busybar class, you have to call
    @{"Busybar.Move" LINK BusybarMove} repeatedly to move the animation. This can be achieved by
    setting up an interval timer using Hollywood's "SetInterval()" function.

    @{"Busybar.Move                      " LINK BusybarMove} Draw next animation frame

        Note that RapaGUI might scale the image to fit to the current monitor's

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This attribute allows you to set the type of the Hollywood image object
        passed in the @{"Button.Icon" LINK ButtonIcon} attribute. By default, @{"Button.Icon" LINK ButtonIcon} expects a
        Hollywood brush. By setting Button.IconType, however, you can make it
        use a different Hollywood image type.

        The following image types are currently available:

        Brush     Use a Hollywood brush. This is the default type. You can use
                  either raster or vector brushes. Vector brushes have the
                  advantage that they can be scaled to any resolution without
                  losses in quality. This is very useful when designing
                  applications that should be compatible with high-DPI monitors.
                  See @{"High-DPI support" LINK HiDPI} for details.

        Icon      Use a Hollywood icon. This image type has the advantage that
                  it can contain several subimages of different sizes. This
                  makes it possible to provide images in different resolutions
                  which can be very useful when designing applications that
                  should be compatible with high-DPI monitors. See @{"High-DPI" LINK HiDPI}
                  @{"support" LINK HiDPI} for details.

        Note that you can globally change the default of all "IconType"

    Choice class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and creates widgets that allow the user
    to select an entry from a predefined list of items. Only the selected item
    is visible until the user pulls down the menu of choices.

    When you declare a choice widget, you can use the <item> tag to fill the
    choice widget with items. Here is an example XML excerpt for creating a
    choice widget with three entries:

        <choice id="printer">
            <item>HP Deskjet</item>
            <item>NEC P6</item>
            <item>Okimate 20</item>
        </choice>

    Alternatively, you can also create an empty choice widget and fill it with
    entries later by using the @{"Choice.Insert" LINK ChoiceInsert} method. Here is how to create an
    empty choice widget:

        <choice/>

@NODE Dialog "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Dialog class derives from @{"Window class" LINK Window} and creates modal (or modeless)
    dialogs. Modal dialogs are special top-level windows which block the rest of
    the application until they are closed. Modal dialogs are typically used when
    user action is required to continue with the program or to indicate that the
    application is currently busy. A dialog could show a progress bar then, for
    example.

    As with windows, the root element of a dialog always needs to be a single
    group object, i.e. an instance of @{"Group class" LINK Group}. See @{"Group class" LINK Group} for details.
    Additionally, it is not allowed to have multiple elements at the dialog's
    root level. You must only use a single group object as the root element.
    Here's an example of a simple progress dialog in XML:

        <dialog id="mydlg" title="Working...">
           <vgroup>
              <progressbar id="prg"/>
              <button id="cancel">Cancel</button>
           </vgroup>
        </dialog>

    You should create dialogs only when you need them and destroy them as soon
    as you are finished with them. It is not advised to create all your dialogs
    on startup using @{"moai.CreateApp()" LINK moaiCreateApp} and keep them in memory all the time.
    Instead, you should use @{"moai.CreateDialog()" LINK moaiCreateDialog} to create a dialog when you need
    it and then have it destroyed as soon as you are finished with it. The
    reason for this is that windows are quite a finite resource on some
    operating systems supported by RapaGUI. For example, on Windows there is a
    limit of about 10,000 windows per process. That might sound like
    sufficiently enough but keep in mind that on Windows every widget is a
    "window" for the operating system, e.g. every label, button, frame,
    checkbox, group, etc. in your application is a window so you should take
    care that you create your dialogs only as needed using @{"moai.CreateDialog()" LINK moaiCreateDialog}
    and destroy them right afterwards.

    In practice, it is advised to create a separate XML file for each of your
    dialogs and then use @{"moai.CreateDialog()" LINK moaiCreateDialog} to convert the XML file into a
    dialog at runtime and have the dialog destroyed automatically by RapaGUI as
    soon as the user closes it.

    As a subclass of @{"Window class" LINK Window} most Window class attributes and methods can
    be used with Dialog class as well. See @{"Window class" LINK Window} for details. But note
    that modal dialogs mustn't be opened by setting @{"Window.Open" LINK WindowOpen} but by running
    the @{"Dialog.ShowModal" LINK DialogShowModal} method. To close a modal dialog, simply call the
    @{"Dialog.EndModal" LINK DialogEndModal} method. This will also automatically destroy the dialog,
    i.e. it will implicitly call @{"moai.FreeDialog()" LINK moaiFreeDialog} on the dialog unless you
    explicitly request that the dialog should not be destroyed by setting an
    optional argument to TRUE.

    Similarly, the dialog will also be automatically destroyed when the user
    clicks the close box of a dialog. If you don't want this or if you need to
    customize the application's behaviour when clicking the close box of a
    dialog, you have to install a listener on the @{"Window.CloseRequest" LINK WindowCloseRequest} attribute.
    If there is no listener on this attribute, RapaGUI will simply call
    @{"Dialog.EndModal" LINK DialogEndModal} with 0 as the parameter when the dialog's close box is
    clicked.

    If you want to open a modeless dialog, i.e. a dialog that doesn't block your
    script while it is open, you must not use @{"Dialog.ShowModal" LINK DialogShowModal} but set
    @{"Window.Open" LINK WindowOpen} to TRUE for the dialog instead (and possibly set
    @{"Application.Sleep" LINK ApplicationSleep} to TRUE too, if you wish to put the application in some
    sort of sleep state while the dialog is open). You can then implement the
    dialog's actual behaviour (e.g. a progress bar that is constantly being
    updated) by repeatedly calling a management function either using
    "SetTimeout()" or Hollywood 9.0's new "RunCallback()" function. When you're
    finished with a modeless dialog, just set @{"Window.Open" LINK WindowOpen} to FALSE on it. Do not
    use @{"Dialog.EndModal" LINK DialogEndModal} with modeless dialogs! See the "Dialogs" example that
    comes with RapaGUI for an example of a modeless dialog (choose "Test
    progress bar dialog" in the menu).

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This method will close the specified dialog that has been opened using
        @{"Dialog.ShowModal" LINK DialogShowModal} and it will break its modal loop. The value you pass in
        "retval" will be the return value of the call to this dialog's
        @{"Dialog.ShowModal" LINK DialogShowModal} method then. This value is often used to indicate
        success or failure, i.e. you could return TRUE in case the user pressed
        the "OK" button, and FALSE otherwise.

        Additionally, this method will automatically destroy the dialog, i.e. it
        will implicitly call @{"moai.FreeDialog()" LINK moaiFreeDialog} on the dialog object. If you
        don't want this, you have to set the optional argument "nodestroy" to
        TRUE. However, it is recommended and it is good programming practice to
        destroy every dialog as soon as you are finished with it. See @{"Dialog" LINK Dialog}
        @{"class" LINK Dialog} for details.

        Dialog.ShowModal -- open dialog and begin modal loop

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        retval = moai.DoMethod(id, "ShowModal")

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This method opens the dialog window and begins a modal loop that blocks
        the rest of the application and waits for the dialog to be closed before
        returning control to the script. In other words, Dialog.ShowModal will
        not return before the user either closes the dialog or the script calls
        @{"Dialog.EndModal" LINK DialogEndModal} on the dialog, whatever happens first.

        If you want to open a modeless dialog, i.e. a dialog that doesn't block
        your script while it is open, you must not use Dialog.ShowModal but set
        @{"Window.Open" LINK WindowOpen} to TRUE for the dialog instead (and possibly set
        @{"Application.Sleep" LINK ApplicationSleep} to TRUE too, if you wish to put the application in
        some sort of sleep state while the dialog is open). You can then
        implement the dialog's actual behaviour (e.g. a progress bar that is
        constantly being updated) by repeatedly calling a management function
        either using "SetTimeout()" or Hollywood 9.0's new "RunCallback()"
        function. When you're finished with a modeless dialog, just set
        @{"Window.Open" LINK WindowOpen} to FALSE on it. Do not use @{"Dialog.EndModal" LINK DialogEndModal} with modeless
        dialogs!

        Note that it is good programming practice to create and destroy dialogs
        as needed. You should not keep them in memory for the complete lifetime
        of your application but only create them when necessary and destroy them
        as soon as you are finished with them. See @{"Dialog class" LINK Dialog} for details.

        If you want to be notified when the user clicks the close box of a
        dialog, you have to install a listener on the @{"Window.CloseRequest" LINK WindowCloseRequest}
        attribute. If there is no listener on this attribute, RapaGUI will
        simply call @{"Dialog.EndModal" LINK DialogEndModal} with 0 as the parameter when the dialog's
        close box is clicked.

@NODE Finddialog "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Finddialog class derives from @{"Dialog class" LINK Dialog} and creates a standard system
    find dialog. Find dialogs are typically used in connection with @{"Texteditor" LINK Texteditor}
    @{"class" LINK Texteditor} to allow the user to search through the entire contents of a
    texteditor widget.

    Even though Finddialog class is a subclass of @{"Dialog class" LINK Dialog}, the dialogs it
    creates must always be modeless. Thus, it is neither allowed to show them
    using @{"Dialog.ShowModal" LINK DialogShowModal} nor is it allowed to close them using @{"Dialog.EndModal" LINK DialogEndModal}.
    Instead, dialogs created by Finddialog class must always be shown and hidden
    by setting the @{"Window.Open" LINK WindowOpen} attribute.

    Finddialog class is available since RapaGUI 2.0.

    Note that this class is currently unsupported on AmigaOS (and compatibles)
    and Android.

@NODE Group "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Group class can be used to lay out a number of children in various ways.
    When the parent's size changes, groups relayout their children which can be
    very useful to create windows that are freely resizable in all directions.

    The following different group types are supported by RapaGUI:

    <hgroup>  Group children will be laid out in a row (vertical).

    <vgroup>  Group children will be laid out in a column (horizontal).

    <colgroup>
              Group children will be laid out in columns.

    <scrollgroup>
              A group with scrollbars. This is a special group which shows an
              embedded group with scrollbars. See @{"Scrollgroup class" LINK Scrollgroup} for details.

    Column groups are useful if you need to have identical widget sizes for all
    your children in a group for a more pleasant visual appearance. For example,
    imagine a form made up of text entry widgets and text objects. It is
    recommended to use a <colgroup> here because it leads to a clear and ordered
    visual appearance. Here's an example:

        <colgroup columns="2">
           <label>Name</label>
           <textentry/>
           <label>Street</label>
           <textentry/>
           <label>City</label>
           <textentry/>
           <label>Zip code</label>
           <textentry/>
           <label>Country</label>
           <textentry/>
           <label>Telephone</label>
           <textentry/>
           <label>Email</label>
           <textentry/>
        </colgroup>

    If we used a <vgroup> with one <hgroup> per row the appearance would be
    pretty bad because the text entry widget's width would be different for each
    line which looks pretty ugly.

    Note that Group class doesn't derive from @{"Area class" LINK Area} because groups do not
    exist as physical widgets but they are just layout tools for their child
    widgets or groups. This is why you cannot use attributes and methods from
    @{"Area class" LINK Area} on group objects.

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This method can be used to add the detached object specified by "obj" to
        the group object specified by "id". The detached object will be added as
        the group's last child. After this method returns the specified object
        will change its state from detached to attached. That is why you must no
        longer use functions that expect a detached object with this object now.

        Before you can call this method, you have to put the group into a
        special state that allows the addition and removal of children. This can
        be done by running the @{"Group.InitChange" LINK GroupInitChange} and @{"Group.ExitChange" LINK GroupExitChange} methods on
        the respective group object.

        Detached MOAI objects can be created either by calling the

        Group.Icon expects a Hollywood brush. To remove the image from a group
        page, set this attribute to -1.

        Note that RapaGUI might scale the image to fit to the current monitor's

        This attribute allows you to set the type of the Hollywood image object
        passed in the @{"Group.Icon" LINK GroupIcon} attribute. By default, @{"Group.Icon" LINK GroupIcon} expects a
        Hollywood brush. By setting Group.IconType, however, you can make it
        use a different Hollywood image type.

        The following image types are currently available:

        Brush     Use a Hollywood brush. This is the default type. You can use
                  either raster or vector brushes. Vector brushes have the
                  advantage that they can be scaled to any resolution without
                  losses in quality. This is very useful when designing
                  applications that should be compatible with high-DPI monitors.
                  See @{"High-DPI support" LINK HiDPI} for details.

        Icon      Use a Hollywood icon. This image type has the advantage that
                  it can contain several subimages of different sizes. This
                  makes it possible to provide images in different resolutions
                  which can be very useful when designing applications that
                  should be compatible with high-DPI monitors. See @{"High-DPI" LINK HiDPI}
                  @{"support" LINK HiDPI} for details.

        Note that you can globally change the default of all "IconType"

        Set up a listener on this attribute to have your event handler called
        whenever the group background needs to be drawn. Your event handler can
        then draw custom graphics to the group background.

        RapaGUI will pass the identifier of a Hollywood brush whose size is
        exactly as big as the group background. You then have to draw the
        desired background graphics to this brush. Precisely, you just have to
        draw to the rectangle defined by the four coordinates "X", "Y", "Width",
        and "Height" which are passed to your callback as well. These four
        coordinates describe a rectangular area within the dimensions of the
        brush that is passed to your callback. When a full redraw is needed, "X"
        and "Y" will be 0 and "Width" and "Height" will match the dimensions of
        the brush. Most oftenly, however, only a partial redraw is needed and
        then you must only draw to the portion of the brush defined by those
        coordinates.

        The following extra arguments will be passed to your event handler:

        Brush:    Contains the identifier of a brush you have to draw to. Use
                  Hollywood's "SelectBrush()" command to select this brush as
                  the output device in your callback. Don't forget to call
                  "EndSelect()" when you are done!

        ViewWidth:
                  Contains the total group width. This is also identical to the
                  width of the brush that is passed to your callback.

        ViewHeight:
                  Contains the total group height. This is also identical to the
                  height of the brush that is passed to your callback.

        X:        Contains the x-position inside the brush at which you should
                  start drawing. See above for details.

        Y:        Contains the y-position inside the brush at which you should
                  start drawing. See above for details.

        Width:    Contains the number of columns you should paint to the brush
                  (starting from "X"). See above for details.

        Height:   Contains the number of rows you should paint to the brush
                  (starting from "Y"). See above for details.

        Note that Group.Paint must only be used with <hgroup> or <vgroup>
        objects. It isn't supported for <colgroup> objects. Also, you must not
        set @{"Group.Frame" LINK GroupFrame} to TRUE when using this attribute. If you want to draw
        the background of a framed group, you have to create a helper group
        around the group whose background you want to draw, e.g.

            <vgroup frame="true" padding="0">
                <vgroup notify="paint">
                    ...
                </vgroup>
            </vgroup>

        If you want to draw the background of a <colgroup>, you can also just
        create a helper group around the column group (see above).

        Note that on AmigaOS and compatibles this feature is only available on
        MUI 4.0 or higher.

@NODE Hollywood "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Hollywood class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and allows you to embed a complete
    Hollywood display inside your GUI as a widget. Whenever you draw something
    to a Hollywood display that is attached to a widget, it will automatically
    be drawn into your widget as well. You can even hide the Hollywood display
    and it will still work. Furthermore, all mouse clicks and key strokes that
    happen inside Hollywood class will be forwarded to the corresponding widget
    as normal Hollywood events. Thus, Hollywood class allows you to
    transparently use almost all of Hollywood's powerful features inside a
    widgets.

    Here is an example of how to embed Hollywood display 1 inside your GUI:

        <hollywood display="1"/>

    Note that by default Hollywood widgets are not resizable. You can change
    this by setting the @{"Area.FixWidth" LINK AreaFixWidth} and @{"Area.FixHeight" LINK AreaFixHeight} attributes accordingly.
    If you set one of those attributes to FALSE, you will get a resizable
    Hollywood widget and just like with normal Hollywood displays, your
    Hollywood widget will also be sent a "SizeWindow" message whenever the
    widget size changes. You can then adapt your widget's content to the new
    size.

    Also note that by default, all Hollywood widgets might be scaled to fit to
    the current monitor's DPI setting. If you don't want that, you can set the
    "ScaleHollywood" tag in "\@REQUIRE" to FALSE. See @{"High-DPI support" LINK HiDPI} for
    details.

        This attribute is mandatory and has to be specified whenever you create
        a Hollywood object. You cannot create an empty Hollywood object without
        an attached display.

        By default, the widget won't be resizable. You can change this by
        setting the @{"Area.FixWidth" LINK AreaFixWidth} and @{"Area.FixHeight" LINK AreaFixHeight} attributes to FALSE. In
        that case, your Hollywood widget will become resizable and whenever the
        user resizes the window, your Hollywood display will get a "SizeWindow"
        event which you can listen to using the InstallEventHandler() function.
        You can then react on this event accordingly and redraw your display,
        etc.

    user to individually adjust the sizes of the group's two children by
    dragging the sash.

    Note that HSplitter groups must always contain exactly two children.
    Additionally, the children must also be sizable because HSplitter class
    allows its children to be resized. Here is an example XML excerpt for
    creating a horizontal splitter layout with two textviews:

        <hsplitter>
            <textview>One</textview>
            <textview>Two</textview>

        while resizing. For example:

        - 0: Only the right child is automatically resized.
        - 50: Both children grow by equal size.

    HTMLview class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and creates a widget which displays a

    on a remote server. It also supports some browser features like a history of
    visited pages and the ability to step through this history.

    On Windows and macOS this class uses an HTML control provided by the OS. On
    Linux this class requires WebKitGTK+ to be installed. Since this is not
    available on every system, there is also a separate RapaGUI version without
    this class and thus without a WebKitGTK+ dependency. On AmigaOS and
    compatibles this class requires the HTMLview.mcc extension.

    Image class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and shows the specified image. The image
    pixel data is taken from a Hollywood brush or icon, depending on what is set
    in @{"Image.BrushType" LINK ImageBrushType}.

    Here is an example XML declaration:

        <image brush="1"/>

    The XML code above creates an image object from Hollywood brush number 1.
    Image class fully supports mask and alpha channel transparency in Hollywood
    brushes/icons so you can also embed images with transparent areas.

        Set this attribute to the identifier of a Hollywood brush or icon to
        specify the image that should be shown by the widget. Whether this
        attribute expects a Hollywood brush or icon, depends on what you specify
        in the @{"Image.BrushType" LINK ImageBrushType} attribute. As the name implies, Image.Brush
        expects a Hollywood brush by default.

        Image class fully supports mask and alpha channel transparency in
        Hollywood brushes/icons so you can also embed images with transparent
        areas.

        Note that RapaGUI might scale the image to fit to the current monitor's
        DPI setting. Please read the @{"chapter on high-DPI support" LINK HiDPI} for more

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This attribute allows you to set the type of the Hollywood image object
        passed in the @{"Image.Brush" LINK ImageBrush} attribute. By default, @{"Image.Brush" LINK ImageBrush} expects a
        Hollywood brush. By setting Image.BrushType, however, you can make it
        use a different Hollywood image type.

        The following image types are currently available:

        Brush     Use a Hollywood brush. This is the default type. You can use
                  either raster or vector brushes. Vector brushes have the
                  advantage that they can be scaled to any resolution without
                  losses in quality. This is very useful when designing
                  applications that should be compatible with high-DPI monitors.
                  See @{"High-DPI support" LINK HiDPI} for details.

        Icon      Use a Hollywood icon. This image type has the advantage that
                  it can contain several subimages of different sizes. This
                  makes it possible to provide images in different resolutions
                  which can be very useful when designing applications that
                  should be compatible with high-DPI monitors. See @{"High-DPI" LINK HiDPI}
                  @{"support" LINK HiDPI} for details.

        Note that you can globally change the default this attribute to
        Hollywood icons by setting the @{"Application.UseIcons" LINK ApplicationUseIcons} tag. See

@NODE Label "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Label class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and creates labels for your widgets.
    Labels typically contain an underscore character to indicate the shortcut
    for accessing the widget that a label describes.

    Here is an example of how to use the <label> command:

        <hgroup>
            <label>_Name</label>
            <textentry/>
        </hgroup>

    The code above sets up a text entry widget that is labelled "Name". It also
    sets up a shortcut: When the user presses ALT+N, the text entry widget is
    automatically activated. See @{"Keyboard shortcuts" LINK Shortcuts} for details.

    Please note that labels are not resizable horizontally. That is why they can
    easily block resizing of your whole GUI. To circumvent this problem, you can
    simply put the label in a <hgroup> together with an empty <rectangle>
    object. See @{"Rectangle class" LINK Rectangle} for details.

    @{"Label.Align                       " LINK LabelAlign} Set label alignment

@NODE Listview "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Listview class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and shows a list container that can
    be filled with data items. RapaGUI's listview class is very powerful and
    supports multi-column lists, checkboxes, editable list items, data sorting
    via custom callbacks, and icons for the individual listview items.

    When creating a listview in XML code, you always have to add at least one
    column to it. This is done by using @{"Listviewcolumn class" LINK Listviewcolumn}. Here is an
    example of a minimal listview declaration with just a single column:

        <listview>
           <column/>
        </listview>

    It is also possible to add some entries to the listview right at declaration
    time. This can be done by using the <item> tag:

        <listview>
           <column>
              <item>Entry 1</item>
              <item>Entry 2</item>
              <item>Entry 3</item>
           </column>
        </listview>

    If you want to have a multi-column list, you need to use the <column> tag
    several times. Here is an example:

        <listview>
           <column title="Column 1">
              <item>Entry 1</item>
              <item>Entry 2</item>
              <item>Entry 3</item>
           </column>
           <column title="Column 2">
              <item>Entry 1</item>
              <item>Entry 2</item>
              <item>Entry 3</item>
           </column>
           <column title="Column 3">
              <item>Entry 1</item>
              <item>Entry 2</item>
              <item>Entry 3</item>
           </column>
        </listview>

    In this example we have also made use of the @{"Listviewcolumn.Title" LINK ListviewcolumnTitle} attribute
    to add a title bar to each of our columns. There are some more attributes
    that you can use to customize the appearance of your columns. For example,
    you can add checkboxes to your columns and allow the editing of column
    items. See @{"Listviewcolumn class" LINK Listviewcolumn} for details.

    Note that RapaGUI might use up to three different kinds of widgets for this
    class: In case you are creating a listview that doesn't use any advanced
    functionality (such as multiple columns, icons, sorting) RapaGUI might
    create a more basic list widget for you because some operating systems offer
    several kinds of list-based widgets, e.g. on Windows there is a Listbox
    widget and a Listview widget. RapaGUI will use the Listbox widget in case
    your listview doesn't use any of the advanced features because listboxes are
    usually faster than listviews. If you don't want that, you can force RapaGUI
    to always give you a full-blown listview by setting the @{"Listview.ForceMode" LINK ListviewForceMode}
    attribute to the according tag. See @{"Listview.ForceMode" LINK ListviewForceMode} for details.

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        moai.DoMethod(id, "Edit", row, column)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This method can be used to programmatically initiate item editing.
        Normally, item editing is started by the user by slowly double-clicking
        an item. This method provides an alternative to this user mechanism.

        This will only work if @{"Listviewcolumn.Editable" LINK ListviewcolumnEditable} has been set to TRUE for
        the respective listview column.

        When the user has finished editing, the @{"Listview.ValueChange" LINK ListviewValueChange} attribute
        will be triggered.

        Note that if you have installed a listener on the @{"Listview.StartEditing" LINK ListviewStartEditing}
        attribute, then this callback will be asked for permission first before
        editing is actually started.

        To learn about editing operations getting cancelled, you can listen to
        the @{"Listview.AbortEditing" LINK ListviewAbortEditing} attribute.

        Also note that on AmigaOS and compatibles this feature is only available

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        RapaGUI can use up to three different widgets for Listview class
        depending on your settings. For example, in case a single-column list
        with no icons and headings is used, RapaGUI might use a different widget
        for reasons of efficiency in case the host OS provides such a widget.
        For example, on Windows RapaGUI will use the Listbox control instead of
        a fully featured Listview in those cases. If you don't want that, set
        this attribute to the desired widget and RapaGUI will try to use it.

        The following modes are currently recognized:

        Normal    Automatically selects the widget that fits best. This is the
                  default.

        Listbox   Use a Listbox widget. Listbox widgets only support a single
                  column, no icons, no headings, no check boxes, no editable
                  entries and no hidden columns.

        Listview  Use a Listview widget. Listview widgets support everything
                  instead of check boxes, editable entries, right and center
                  alignment and hiding columns.

        Dataview  Use a Dataview widget. Supports everything but currently uses
                  a generic implementation on Windows.

        Note that on AmigaOS and compatibles this attribute doesn't have any
        effect since RapaGUI always uses the same widget on those platforms.

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Insert one new entry into the listview. If the listview has multiple
        columns, you need to pass individual entry data for all the columns in
        the listview.

        The entry data consists of a text string and, if the column has the
        @{"Listviewcolumn.Icon" LINK ListviewcolumnIcon} attribute set, an icon for each column. The icon has
        to be passed before the text string and it has to be an identifier of a
        Hollywood brush/icon which should be used as the icon for the entry. If
        @{"Listviewcolumn.Icon" LINK ListviewcolumnIcon} isn't set, then you must omit the icon parameter and
        only pass text data for the listview entry. If you've set
        @{"Listviewcolumn.Icon" LINK ListviewcolumnIcon} to TRUE and you don't want to show an icon in this
        particular row and column, you can also pass the special value -1. In
        that case, RapaGUI won't show an icon even though @{"Listviewcolumn.Icon" LINK ListviewcolumnIcon}
        has been set to TRUE. Please note that auto-generated IDs cannot be
        used. Please also read about RapaGUI's image cache to learn more about
        icon support in RapaGUI. See @{"Image cache" LINK ImageCache} for details.

        In case a column is showing a checkbox, you have to pass "On", "True",
        or "1" to select the checkbox and any other text to deselect the
        checkbox.

        The insert position is specified in the "pos" argument. The new entry
        will be added in front of the entry specified by "pos". This can be an
        absolute index position starting at 0 for the first entry or one of the
        following special values:

        Top       Insert as first entry.

        Active    Insert before the active entry. If there is no active entry,
                  the entry will be inserted at the very top of the list.

        Bottom    Insert as last entry.

        If "pos" is bigger or equal to the number of entries in the listview,
        the entry will be inserted as the last entry.

        If the listview has sortable columns, "pos" will be ignored and the
        entry will automatically be sorted into the listview, depending on which
        column currently has the sort focus. See @{"Listview.SortColumn" LINK ListviewSortColumn} for
        details.

        Listview.Insert returns the position of the newly inserted entry. This
        is especially useful when the listview has sortable columns because in
        that case, you can't easily compute where the entry will end up in the
        listview.

        Note that on AmigaOS and compatibles icon support is only available with
        MUI 4.0 or better.

@NODE ListviewRename "RapaGUI Guide"

        Listview.Rename -- rename an entry

   @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        moai.DoMethod(id, "Rename", pos, [icon1,] column1$, ...)

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Rename the listview entry at the specified position. If the listview has
        multiple columns, you need to pass a new name for every column. It is
        not possible to rename only a single column entry - this method always
        affects the complete row so you need to pass as many strings as there
        are columns in your listview.

        For all columns that have the @{"Listviewcolumn.Icon" LINK ListviewcolumnIcon} attribute set, you
        also need to pass an icon before the actual text. The icon has to be an
        identifier of a Hollywood brush/icon which should be used as the icon
        for the column. If @{"Listviewcolumn.Icon" LINK ListviewcolumnIcon} isn't set, then you must omit the
        icon parameter and only pass text data for the listview entry. If you've
        set @{"Listviewcolumn.Icon" LINK ListviewcolumnIcon} to TRUE and you don't want to show an icon in
        this particular row and column, you can also pass the special value -1.
        In that case, RapaGUI won't show an icon even though @{"Listviewcolumn.Icon" LINK ListviewcolumnIcon}
        has been set to TRUE. Please note that auto-generated IDs cannot be
        used. Please also read about RapaGUI's image cache to learn more about
        icon support in RapaGUI. See @{"Image cache" LINK ImageCache} for details.

        In case a column is showing a checkbox, you have to pass "On", "True",
        or "1" to select the checkbox and any other text to deselect the
        checkbox.

        The entry position is specified in the "pos" argument. This can be an
        absolute index position starting at 0 for the first entry or one of the
        following special values:

        Active    Rename the active entry.

        Note that on AmigaOS and compatibles icon support is only available with
        MUI 4.0 or better.

                  if the column has the icon attribute set; note that this must

    Listviewcolumn class is needed when creating listviews. It allows you to

    Listviewcolumn class must always be embedded inside a <listview>
    declaration. Its XML tag is <column>. See @{"Listview class" LINK Listview} for details.

    Note that you cannot create instances of this class using
    @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject}. Listview column numbers are currently static, i.e. you
    cannot add or remove columns at runtime.

        columns show checkboxes instead of text. Whenever an item's text in a
        checkbox column is set to "On", "True", or "1", the checkbox will be
        selected. All other item texts will lead to an unselected checkbox.

        You can modify the states of the checkboxes either by using the
        @{"Listview.Rename" LINK ListviewRename} method or by using the dedicated @{"Listview.SetState" LINK ListviewSetState}
        method. Similarly, getting the state of a checkbox is possible via the
        @{"Listview.GetEntry" LINK ListviewGetEntry} or @{"Listview.GetState" LINK ListviewGetState} methods.

        To get notified whenever the user toggles a checkbox state, you have to
        listen to the @{"Listview.ValueChange" LINK ListviewValueChange} attribute.

        Also note that Listviewcolumn.Checkbox and @{"Listviewcolumn.Editable" LINK ListviewcolumnEditable} and
        @{"Listviewcolumn.Icon" LINK ListviewcolumnIcon} are mutually exclusive. You cannot create checkbox

        can return FALSE to forbid editing of certain items. See
        @{"Listview.StartEditing" LINK ListviewStartEditing} for details.

        To get notified whenever the value of a listview item changes because
        the user has edited it, you have to listen to the @{"Listview.ValueChange" LINK ListviewValueChange}

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This attribute allows you to set the type of the Hollywood image object

        @{"Listviewcolumn.Icon" LINK ListviewcolumnIcon} expects a Hollywood brush. By setting
        Listviewcolumn.IconType, however, you can make it use a different
        Hollywood image type.

        The following image types are currently available:

        Brush     Use a Hollywood brush. This is the default type. You can use
                  either raster or vector brushes. Vector brushes have the
                  advantage that they can be scaled to any resolution without
                  losses in quality. This is very useful when designing
                  applications that should be compatible with high-DPI monitors.
                  See @{"High-DPI support" LINK HiDPI} for details.

        Icon      Use a Hollywood icon. This image type has the advantage that
                  it can contain several subimages of different sizes. This
                  makes it possible to provide images in different resolutions
                  which can be very useful when designing applications that
                  should be compatible with high-DPI monitors. See @{"High-DPI" LINK HiDPI}

    Listviewitem class can be used when creating listviews to add listview

    Listviewitem class entries must always be embedded inside a <column>
    declaration. Its XML tag is <item>. See @{"Listviewcolumn class" LINK Listviewcolumn} for details.

    Note that you cannot create instances of this class using
    @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject}. Instead, you have to use @{"Listview.Insert" LINK ListviewInsert} to create new
    items at runtime. Also, you cannot change any attributes of listview items

        a Hollywood brush. You also need to set @{"Listviewcolumn.Icon" LINK ListviewcolumnIcon} to TRUE if
        you want to use icons in a listview column.

        To change the icon of a listview entry later, you can use the
        @{"Listview.Rename" LINK ListviewRename} method.

        Note that RapaGUI might scale the image to fit to the current monitor's

@NODE Menu "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Menu class can be used to create a single pull-down menu which should then
    be filled with items derived from @{"Menuitem class" LINK Menuitem} class. Menus are usually
    embedded inside a top-level <menubar> object. See @{"Menubar class" LINK Menubar} for details.
    Alternatively, they can also be embedded as submenus of other menu objects.

    It is also possible to add a menu object as a context menu to one of your
    window's widgets using the @{"Area.ContextMenu" LINK AreaContextMenu} attribute. The context menu will
    then appear whenever the user presses the right mouse button over the widget
    that hosts the context menu. Here is an example of how to add a menu object
    as a context menu to a text editor widget:

        <menu title="Context menu" id="ctxtmenu">
           <item>Cut</item>
           <item>Copy</item>
           <item>Paste</item>
        </menu>

        <window>
        ...
           <texteditor contextmenu="ctxtmenu"/>
        ...
        </window>

    Note that when using Menu class to create context menus, the @{"Menu.Title" LINK MenuTitle}
    attribute is only used on AmigaOS and compatibles. Context menus on Windows,
    Linux, and macOS don't show a title.

@NODE Menubar "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Menubar class is used to manage top-level menus that can be attached to
    windows via the @{"Window.Menubar" LINK WindowMenubar} attribute. A menubar contains a number of
    children which are objects of @{"Menu class" LINK Menu}, each of them describing exactly
    one menu.

    In an XML file a menu tree is defined using the <menubar>, <menu> and <item>
    tags. Here is an example definition of a simple menubar:

        <menubar id="mymenubar">
            <menu title="_File">
                <item>_New...</item>
                <item>_Open...</item>
                <item/>
                <item>_Save</item>
                <item>S_ave as...</item>
                <item/>
                <item>_Quit</item>
            </menu>
            <menu title="Edit">
                <item shortcut="Ctrl+X">_Cut</item>
                <item shortcut="Ctrl+C">C_opy</item>
                <item shortcut="Ctrl+V">_Paste</item>
            </menu>
            <menu title="?">
                <item>Se_ttings...</item>
                <item/>
                <item>A_bout...</item>
                <item>About _RapaGUI...</item>
            </menu>
        </menubar>

    Note the use of the underscore character in the XML code above: You can use
    this character to automatically designate the next character as a shortcut
    key for the menu item. This is very useful because many people like to use
    the keyboard instead of the mouse, especially when it comes to repeating the
    same actions many times. Thus, it is always a good idea to set up keyboard
    shortcuts. See @{"Keyboard shortcuts" LINK Shortcuts} for details.

    If you need more complex keyboard shortcuts, e.g. something like Ctrl+V for
    paste, you can use the attribute @{"Menuitem.Shortcut" LINK MenuitemShortcut} to set up such a
    shortcut. Note that on some platforms (e.g. Windows), both types of
    shortcuts can be specified at the same time: Shortcuts specified by using
    the underscore character and shortcuts declared via the @{"Menuitem.Shortcut" LINK MenuitemShortcut}.
    If a certain platform supports only one type of shortcut, the one specified
    in @{"Menuitem.Shortcut" LINK MenuitemShortcut} will take precedence over the one specified using the
    underscore character.

    Also note the empty <item/> declarations: These will insert a separator bar
    into the menu tree. Using separator bars makes your menu more readable to
    the end-user. After you have written the XML declaration above you can add
    the menubar to one of your windows by using the @{"Window.Menubar" LINK WindowMenubar} attribute as
    follows:

        <window menubar="mymenubar">
        ...
        </window>

    It is very important to note that you have to declare your menubars in the
    <application> scope because menubars are global objects and are only
    attached to windows or widgets later on. That is why it is not allowed to
    declare menubars inside a <window> XML scope.

@NODE Menuitem "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Menuitem class can be used to create a single menu item. As such menuitems
    must always be embedded inside a <menu> tag which in turn is usually
    embedded inside a <menubar> tag. See @{"Menubar class" LINK Menubar} for details.

    Please note that the XML tag for menuitem class is just <item> and not
    <menuitem> when creating menu items that are embedded inside a <menu> tree.
    When creating isolated menu items that aren't embedded inside a <menu> tree,
    you have to use <menuitem>, though because otherwise RapaGUI wouldn't be
    able to know which class you are referring to since <item> is used by many
    different classes.

    If you do not specify a title for the menuitem, a separator item will be
    created. This is useful to group certain menuitems together which results in
    a more readable menu layout.

@NODE MenuitemShortcut "RapaGUI Guide"

   @{b}NAME@{ub}
        Menuitem.Shortcut -- set custom shortcut for menu item

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Set a custom shortcut for a menu item. Normally, menu item shortcuts are
        defined by just using the underscore character in the item title to
        designate a keyboard shortcut. See @{"Keyboard shortcuts" LINK Shortcuts} for details. There
        are however certain cases where this is not sufficient. First of all, by
        using the underscore character to declare a keyboard shortcut you are
        limited to characters which are part of the menu item's title. In many
        times, though, you will want to declare a shortcut that is not part of
        the item's title, e.g. the typical shortcut for "Paste" is Ctrl+V
        although there is no "V" in the word "Paste". This is where
        Menuitem.Shortcut can be used to set up arbitrary shortcuts for your
        menu items.

        Additionally, this attribute is also useful for defining more complex
        shortcuts, e.g. Alt+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+X, etc. Defining such complex
        shortcuts isn't possible through the standard underscore route either,
        so you have to use Menuitem.Shortcut for it.

        The string you specify here must be combination of modifiers and keys
        separated by + or - characters. The following modifiers and keys are
        currently recognized:

        'Ctrl'    This specifies the control key on Windows and Linux and the
                  command key on AmigaOS and macOS. The reason why this is
                  mapped to the command key on AmigaOS and macOS is to make it
                  easier for you to write portable code. On Windows and Linux
                  the control key is the standard modifier key whereas AmigaOS
                  and macOS use the command key as the standard modifier key.
                  Thus, by specifying this modifier you will always get the
                  system's default modifier key. If you need to use the real
                  control key on AmigaOS and macOS, use the modifier key RawCtrl
                  (see below). If RapaGUI didn't treat Ctrl as a special token,
                  you'd always have to write separate code for Windows and Linux
                  vs. AmigaOS and macOS, i.e. you'd have to specify Ctrl+V for
                  paste on Windows and Linux and Cmd+V for paste on AmigaOS and
                  macOS. Since this generates unnecessary overhead, Ctrl is
                  treated as a special key which is mapped to the system's
                  default menu shortcut modifier key.

        'Alt'     Use the alt key as a modifier key.

        'Shift'   Use the shift key as a modifier key.

        'RawCtrl' On AmigaOS and macOS this modifier key allows you to listen to
                  the real control key. If you use Ctrl instead, RapaGUI will
                  listen to the command key on AmigaOS and macOS (see above for
                  details). On Windows and Linux RawCtrl is identical to Ctrl.

        'Up'      Cursor up

        'Down'    Cursor down

        'Right'   Cursor right

        'Left'    Cursor left

        'Help'    Help key

        'Del'     Delete key

        'Backspace'
                  Backspace key

        'Tab'     Tab key

        'Return'  Return key

        'Enter'   Enter key

        'Esc'     Escape

        'Space'   Space key

        'F1 - F16'
                  Function keys

        'Insert'  Insert key

        'Home'    Home key

        'End'     End key

        'PageUp'  Page up key

        'PageDown'
                  Page down key

        'Print'   Print key

        'Pause'   Pause key

        Furthermore, you can also add English alphabet characters from A to Z as
        well as the numbers 0 to 9 to your shortcut specification.

        Finally, please do note that specifying shortcuts using the underscore
        character and Menuitem.Shortcut are not mutually exclusive. You can
        actually specify both and on some systems (e.g. Windows) RapaGUI will
        even support both. For example, on Windows you can access menu items via
        the keyboard by first pressing Alt and then the underscore shortcut or
        you can also access menu items by pressing a predefined shortcut, e.g.
        Ctrl+V for paste. On systems which don't support both kinds of
        shortcuts, the shortcut specified in Menuitem.Shortcut will take
        precedence.

@NODE Pageview "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Pageview class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and is a container for multiple pages
    of widgets, displayed as one page at a time. When using this class, you only
    have to supply a number of groups constituting the pageview's children.
    These children can then be visualized in a number of ways, depending on the
    @{"Pageview.Mode" LINK PageviewMode} attribute which determines the widget that is used to browse
    through the pages. The following widgets are currently available for that
    purpose:

    - tabbed widget (default)
    - list widget
    - choice widget
    - none, i.e. pages can only be changed programmatically (useful for setup
      wizards etc.)

    When setting up a pageview, you need to use the @{"Group.Title" LINK GroupTitle} attribute to
    define title texts for your pageview children. You can also use the
    @{"Group.Icon" LINK GroupIcon} attribute to add icons for your pageview children.

    Here is an example of a three page pageview group:

        <pageview>
           <vgroup title="Page 1">

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Set the browser widget this pageview object should use. This can be one
        of the following values:

        Tabs      Use a tabbed control to browse through the pages. This is the
                  default mode.

        List      Use a listview widget to browse through the pages.

        Choice    Use a choice widget to browse through the pages.

        None      Don't use any browser widget at all. This means that the user
                  cannot browse through the pages. Pages can only be changed by
                  setting the @{"Pageview.Active" LINK PageviewActive} attribute. This is useful for
                  setup or installation wizards which often use a custom
                  pageview which only switches page when the user presses a
                  "Next page" or "Previous page" button.

        moai.DoMethod(id, "Prepend", obj[, active])

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        This method can be used to prepend a new page to a pageview. The new
        page specified by "obj" must be a detached group object. This detached
        group object will then be added as the pageview's first page. After this
        method returns the specified group object will change its state from
        detached to attached. That is why you must no longer use functions that
        expect a detached object with this object now.

        Detached MOAI objects can be created either by calling the
        @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject} function or by explicitly detaching them from their
        parent by using the @{"Pageview.Remove" LINK PageviewRemove} method.

        This method will remove the page specified by "obj" from the pageview.
        The group object that constitutes the page that is being removed will
        then change its state from attached to detached. This means that you
        could attach it now to another pageview or group using a function like
        @{"Group.Insert" LINK GroupInsert} and @{"Pageview.Append" LINK PageviewAppend}, respectively, or you could free it

@NODE Radio "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Radio class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and creates a number of mutually
    exclusive buttons allowing the user to make a single choice. The buttons are
    embedded inside a group with a frame and an optional frame title.

    When you declare a radio widget in XML, you have to use the <item> tag to
    fill the radio widget with items. Every radio widget needs to have at least
    one item.

    Here is an example XML excerpt for creating a radio widget:

        <radio id="printer">
            <item>HP Deskjet</item>
            <item>NEC P6</item>
            <item>Okimate 20</item>
        </radio>

    You can use the @{"Radio.Columns" LINK RadioColumns} attribute to fine-tune the layout of the radio
    buttons. By default, they appear in a single-column vertical layout. Setting
    @{"Radio.Columns" LINK RadioColumns} allows you to change that to a horizontal layout, for example.

    @{"Radio.Active                      " LINK RadioActive} Set/get active radio item
    @{"Radio.Columns                     " LINK RadioColumns} Set number of radio columns

@NODE Rectangle "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Rectangle class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and creates empty objects that are
    freely resizable. This might not seem very useful at first but in fact,
    rectangle objects are needed very often to fine-tune the GUI layout. They
    can be used for all kinds of layout magic, e.g. for controlling the
    alignment of fixed-size widgets and much more.

    Additionally, rectangle objects are often necessary as padding space next to
    objects which are not resizable themselves. The <radio> object, for
    instance, is not resizable. To prevent these static radio objects from
    blocking the resizing feature of your whole GUI, you can simply pad them
    with <rectangle> objects. Here is an example of a radio object, padded using
    an invisible rectangle:

        <hgroup>
          <rectangle/>
          <radio id="printer">
            <item>HP Deskjet</item>

    By using rectangles on both sides of the radio box object, the radio box
    will automatically be centered inside the available GUI space. If you used
    only one rectangle object before the radio object, the radio object would
    automatically be right aligned. A rectangle object after the radio object
    would lead to left alignment of the radio object.

    If you need fixed size padding objects, use @{"HSpace class" LINK HSpace} or @{"VSpace class" LINK VSpace}.
    See @{"HSpace class" LINK HSpace} for details. See @{"VSpace class" LINK VSpace} for details.

@NODE Scrollbar "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Scrollbar class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and creates a widget that represents
    a horizontal or vertical scrollbar. An isolated scrollbar object doesn't
    make much sense. That's why scrollbar objects are typically connected to
    another widget by using the @{"Scrollbar.Target" LINK ScrollbarTarget} attribute. For example, you can
    connect scrollbars to an object of @{"Hollywood class" LINK Hollywood} to create a custom widget
    which draws user-defined graphics depending on the current scrollbar
    position.

    @{"Scrollbar.AutoScale                    " LINK ScrollbarAutoScale} Enable/disable auto scaling
    @{"Scrollbar.Horiz                        " LINK ScrollbarHoriz} Set scrollbar object direction

@NODE Scrollcanvas "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Scrollcanvas class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and creates a canvas with
    scrollbars attached. You can draw custom graphics to this canvas via a paint
    callback that is automatically invoked whenever content needs to be drawn.
    You just need to set up a notification on the @{"Scrollcanvas.Paint" LINK ScrollcanvasPaint} attribute
    and your event handler will be called whenever content needs to be drawn.
    The same thing can be achieved by embedding a widget derived from @{"Hollywood" LINK Hollywood}
    @{"class" LINK Hollywood} inside a scrollgroup or connecting such a Hollywood widget to
    scrollbars but Scrollcanvas class is preferable in some cases because it is
    optimized especially for scrolled content, i.e. it tries to minimize
    painting by using OS widgets which are specifically designed for displaying
    scrolled content. Thus, it is usually faster than the two solutions outlined
    above.

    You can set the canvas dimensions by using the @{"Scrollcanvas.VirtWidth" LINK ScrollcanvasVirtWidth} and
    @{"Scrollcanvas.VirtHeight" LINK ScrollcanvasVirtHeight}. Since Scrollcanvas class uses scrollbars, the
    dimensions of the canvas can obviously be much bigger than the physical
    dimensions of the scrollcanvas widget. As with all other classes, you can
    set those physical dimensions using the generic @{"Area.Width" LINK AreaWidth} and @{"Area.Height" LINK AreaHeight}
    attributes.

    To force a complete redraw of your widget, just run the @{"Area.Redraw" LINK AreaRedraw} method
    on your object. Running @{"Area.Redraw" LINK AreaRedraw} on your object will result in your paint
    function being called so that you can update the canvas accordingly.

    With Scrollcanvas class the dimensions you specify in @{"Scrollcanvas.VirtWidth" LINK ScrollcanvasVirtWidth}
    and @{"Scrollcanvas.VirtHeight" LINK ScrollcanvasVirtHeight} are in @{"device-independent pixels" LINK DIP} by default and
    RapaGUI will automatically apply the system's scale factor to the contents
    drawn by the @{"Scrollcanvas.Paint" LINK ScrollcanvasPaint} function. If you want to have fine-tuned
    control, you can set the @{"Scrollcanvas.AutoScale" LINK ScrollcanvasAutoScale} attribute to FALSE. In that
    case, @{"Scrollcanvas.VirtWidth" LINK ScrollcanvasVirtWidth} and @{"Scrollcanvas.VirtHeight" LINK ScrollcanvasVirtHeight} are interpreted as
    physical pixels and no auto scaling will be done so that your paint function
    can draw high resolutions graphics without any quality loss due to scaling.
    See @{"High-DPI support" LINK HiDPI} for details.

   @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
        Set up a listener on this attribute to have your event handler called
        whenever content needs to be drawn on the canvas. Your event handler can
        then paint the canvas contents depending on the current scrollbar
        position.

        RapaGUI will pass the identifier of a Hollywood brush whose size is
        exactly as big as the visible area of your scrollcanvas widget to your
        callback. You then have to draw the desired contents to this brush.
        Precisely, you just have to draw to the rectangle defined by the four
        coordinates "X", "Y", "Width", and "Height" which are passed to your
        callback as well. These four coordinates describe a rectangular area
        within the dimensions of the brush that is passed to your callback. When
        a full redraw is needed, "X" and "Y" will be 0 and "Width" and "Height"
        will match the dimensions of the brush. Most oftenly, however, only a
        partial redraw is needed and then you must only draw to the portion of
        the brush defined by those coordinates.

        The following extra arguments will be passed to your event handler:

        Brush:    Contains the identifier of a brush you have to draw to. Use
                  Hollywood's "SelectBrush()" command to select this brush as
                  the output device in your callback. Don't forget to call
                  "EndSelect()" when you are done!

        ViewWidth:
                  Contains the visible width of widget. This is also identical
                  to the width of the brush that is passed to your callback.

        ViewHeight:
                  Contains the visible height of widget. This is also identical
                  to the height of the brush that is passed to your callback.

        ScrollX:  Contains the position of the horizontal scrollbar.

        ScrollY:  Contains the position of the vertical scrollbar.

        VirtWidth:
                  Contains the virtual width of your widget. This is the value
                  set using @{"Scrollcanvas.VirtWidth" LINK ScrollcanvasVirtWidth}.

        VirtHeight:
                  Contains the virtual height of your widget. This is the value
                  set using @{"Scrollcanvas.VirtHeight" LINK ScrollcanvasVirtHeight}.

        X:        Contains the x-position inside the brush at which you should
                  start drawing. See above for details.

        Y:        Contains the y-position inside the brush at which you should
                  start drawing. See above for details.

        Width:    Contains the number of columns you should paint to the brush
                  (starting from "X"). See above for details.

        Height:   Contains the number of rows you should paint to the brush
                  (starting from "Y"). See above for details.

        To compute the absolute position of the content that should be drawn to
        the canvas, just add the ScrollX+X and ScrollY+Y coordinates and you're
        done.

        See @{"Notifications" LINK Notifications} for details.

@NODE Scrollgroup "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Scrollgroup class is a special variant of @{"Group class" LINK Group} which adds scrollbars
    to groups to make it possible to use groups which are larger than the
    available GUI space. The user can simply scroll through the group then using
    the scrollbars attached to the group. When there is enough space for the
    complete group, the scrollbars are automatically hidden unless explicitly
    configured not to do so.

    Scrollgroups can be created in a similar fashion to normal groups. Here is
    an XML example:

        <scrollgroup>
            <radio>
               <item>Amiga 500</item>
               <item>Amiga 1200</item>
               <item>Amiga 4000</item>
            </radio>
            <listview>
               <column/>
            </listview>
        </scrollgroup>

    Slider class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and creates a widget which allows the
    user to adjust a numeric value using a thumb which can be pulled back and

    orientation depending on the @{"Slider.Horiz" LINK SliderHoriz} attribute. By default a horizontal
    slider is created.

@NODE Statusbar "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Statusbar class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and creates a widget placed at the
    bottom of the window to give small amounts of status information. Status
    bars contain one or more children of @{"Statusbaritem class" LINK Statusbaritem}, all of which can
    be either of fixed or variable lengths.

    When creating a status bar in XML, you have to specify how many fields it
    should get by using the <item> tag to add children of @{"Statusbaritem class" LINK Statusbaritem} to
    your status bar. Here is an example of a status bar with three fields:

        <statusbar>
           <item id="first">Welcome to my application</item>
           <item id="second"/>
           <item id="third" width="20"/>
        </statusbar>

    You can set the widths of the individual fields using the
    @{"Statusbaritem.Width" LINK StatusbaritemWidth} attribute. Above we assign a fixed width only to the
    third field. The other two use variable widths.

    The text of status bar items can be changed later by setting the
    @{"Statusbaritem.Text" LINK StatusbaritemText} attribute. Note, however, that this often isn't even
    necessary because the text provided in the @{"Menuitem.Help" LINK MenuitemHelp} and
    @{"Toolbarbutton.Help" LINK ToolbarbuttonHelp} attributes is automatically shown in the status bar and
    doesn't require any additional code on your part.

    There can be only one status bar per window and it always has to be the last
    child of the window's root group. RapaGUI won't accept status bars at random
    positions in the GUI layout. Status bars must always be the last child of
    the window's root group. Thus, they are always placed at the bottom of the
    window layout.

    Also note that it is not possible to create stand-alone instances of this
    class using @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject}. Status bars always have to be created
    within the context of a window. Thus, if you want to create status bars
    using @{"moai.CreateObject()" LINK moaiCreateObject}, you always have to create a complete window and
    embed the status bar in this window declaration.

    Statusbar class doesn't define any attributes or methods itself. See
    @{"Statusbaritem class" LINK Statusbaritem} for all necessary information.

        absolute value in @{"device-independent pixels" LINK DIP} for a fixed width field or a
        negative value indicating a proportion for a variable width field. The
        space left for all variable width fields is divided between them
        according to the absolute value of this number. A variable width field
        with width of -2 gets twice as much of it as a field with width -1 and
        so on.

        For example, to create one fixed width field of width 100 in the right
        part of the status bar and two more fields which get 66% and 33% of the
        remaining space correspondingly, you would set the width fields of the
        items to -2, -1 and 100, respectively.

        Defaults to -1.

@NODE Text "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Text class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and creates widgets that display one or
    more lines of text, pretty similar to what widgets of @{"Label class" LINK Label} do. A
    difference is that Text class supports multiple lines of text as well as
    frames around the text and widgets created by Text class are resizable
    whereas @{"Label class" LINK Label} creates non-sizeable widgets. Like @{"Label class" LINK Label}, Text
    class also supports the underscore character in its text to define a
    keyboard shortcut.

    Please note that Text class supports neither automatic word wrapping nor
    text formatting. If you want to have these features, you have to use
    @{"Textview class" LINK Textview} instead. See @{"Textview class" LINK Textview} for details.

@NODE Texteditor "RapaGUI Guide"
@{b}Overview@{ub}

    Texteditor class derives from @{"Area class" LINK Area} and creates multi-line text entry
    widgets with most of the functions of a normal text editor. It also supports
    text formatting via certain character codes if @{"Texteditor.Styled" LINK TexteditorStyled} has been
    set. This allows you to enable certain styles (bold, italic, underline) for
    your text as well as change the color of your text. See @{"Text formatting" LINK TextFormat}
    @{"codes" LINK TextFormat} for details. The XML tag's content is used as the initial contents of
    the text editor widget.

    Here is an XML example of how to include a text editor object in your GUI:

        <texteditor>Enter your text here!</texteditor>

    Note that there is a slight difference between the texteditor widget on
    Windows and all other platforms: Windows' native texteditor widget uses two
    characters between lines (CRLF, i.e. carriage return and linefeed) whereas
    on all other platforms only a linefeed character is used. This leads to the
    problem that hard-coded index or range positions are not completely portable
    because Windows always uses two characters to start a new line. Be prepared
    to deal with this problem.

    Also note that this class requires the TextEditor.mcc extension to be
    installed on AmigaOS and compatibles.
