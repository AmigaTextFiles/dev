<p>
Dialog class derives from <a href="Window.html">Window class</a> and creates modal (or modeless) dialogs.
Modal dialogs are special top-level windows which block the rest of the application until
they are closed. Modal dialogs are typically used when user action is required to continue with
the program or to indicate that the application is currently busy. A dialog could show a
progress bar then, for example.

<p>
As with windows, the root element of a dialog always needs to be a single group object,
i.e. an instance of <a href="Group.html">Group class</a>. See <a href="Group.html">Group class</a> for details. Additionally,
it is not allowed to have multiple elements at the dialog's root level. You must only use
a single group object as the root element. Here's an example of a simple progress dialog
in XML:

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>&lt;dialog id=&quot;mydlg&quot; title=&quot;Working...&quot;&gt;
   &lt;vgroup&gt;
      &lt;progressbar id=&quot;prg&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;button id=&quot;cancel&quot;&gt;Cancel&lt;/button&gt;
   &lt;/vgroup&gt;
&lt;/dialog&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

You should create dialogs only when you need them and destroy them as soon as you are
finished with them. It is not advised to create all your dialogs on startup using
<a href="moaiCreateApp.html">moai.CreateApp()</a> and keep them in memory all the time. Instead,
you should use <a href="moaiCreateDialog.html">moai.CreateDialog()</a> to create a dialog
when you need it and then have it destroyed as soon as you are finished with it.
The reason for this is that windows are quite a finite resource on some operating
systems supported by RapaGUI. For example, on Windows there is a limit of about 10,000
windows per process. That might sound like sufficiently enough but keep in mind that on
Windows every widget is a &quot;window&quot; for the operating system, e.g. every label,
button, frame, checkbox, group, etc. in your application is a window so you should take
care that you create your dialogs only as needed using <a href="moaiCreateDialog.html">moai.CreateDialog()</a>
and destroy them right afterwards.

<p>
In practice, it is advised to create a separate XML file for each of your dialogs and
then use <a href="moaiCreateDialog.html">moai.CreateDialog()</a> to convert the XML file into
a dialog at runtime and have the dialog destroyed automatically by RapaGUI as soon
as the user closes it.

<p>
As a subclass of <a href="Window.html">Window class</a> most Window class attributes and methods
can be used with Dialog class as well. See <a href="Window.html">Window class</a> for details. But note that modal dialogs
mustn't be opened by setting <a href="WindowOpen.html">Window.Open</a> but by running the <a href="DialogShowModal.html">Dialog.ShowModal</a> method.
To close a modal dialog, simply call the <a href="DialogEndModal.html">Dialog.EndModal</a> method. This will also automatically
destroy the dialog, i.e. it will implicitly call <a href="moaiFreeDialog.html">moai.FreeDialog()</a>
on the dialog unless you explicitly request that the dialog should not be destroyed by setting an
optional argument to <code>True</code>.

<p>
Similarly, the dialog will also be automatically destroyed when the user clicks the close
box of a dialog. If you don't want this or if you need to customize the application's behaviour
when clicking the close box of a dialog, you have to install a listener on the <a href="WindowCloseRequest.html">Window.CloseRequest</a>
attribute. If there is no listener on this attribute, RapaGUI will simply call <a href="DialogEndModal.html">Dialog.EndModal</a> with
0 as the parameter when the dialog's close box is clicked.

<p>
If you want to open a modeless dialog, i.e. a dialog that doesn't block your script
while it is open, you must not use <a href="DialogShowModal.html">Dialog.ShowModal</a> but set <a href="WindowOpen.html">Window.Open</a>
to <code>True</code> for the dialog instead (and possibly set <a href="ApplicationSleep.html">Application.Sleep</a> to <code>True</code> too, if
you wish to put the application in some sort of sleep state while the dialog is open). You can then
implement the dialog's actual behaviour (e.g. a progress bar that is constantly being
updated) by repeatedly calling a management function either using <code>SetTimeout()</code> or Hollywood
9.0's new <code>RunCallback()</code> function. When you're finished with a modeless dialog, just
set <a href="WindowOpen.html">Window.Open</a> to <code>False</code> on it. Do not use <a href="DialogEndModal.html">Dialog.EndModal</a> with modeless
dialogs! See the &quot;Dialogs&quot; example that comes with RapaGUI for an example of a modeless
dialog (choose &quot;Test progress bar dialog&quot; in the menu).
