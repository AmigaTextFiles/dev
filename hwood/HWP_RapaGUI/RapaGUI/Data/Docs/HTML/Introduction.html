<p>
RapaGUI is a plugin for Hollywood that allows you to easily create GUIs with Hollywood.
You just have to define the GUI layout in an XML file which is converted into a full-blown
GUI by RapaGUI on the fly. It just doesn't get any easier!

<p>
RapaGUI's premium feature is definitely its cross-platform design. Like Hollywood,
RapaGUI was designed as a platform-independent program. Therefore, it runs on a wide
variety of platforms, but still, it uses OS-native widgets on all supported platforms
to give your applications a truly authentic look and feel. Currently, RapaGUI
is available in native versions for Windows, Linux (GTK2/GTK3), macOS, AmigaOS,
MorphOS, AROS, and even for Android. With RapaGUI you just have to write your application
once and it will automatically run on many other platforms too! This allows you to
spend your time on the really important things, i.e. program design, instead of
having to write backends for lots of different platforms.

<p>
RapaGUI uses an object-oriented design composed of over 40 MOAI (Magic Omnigui
Architecture Interface) classes. Those MOAI classes constitute the
heart of RapaGUI. All GUI elements supported by RapaGUI (windows, widgets, menu bars...)
are simply objects derived from those MOAI classes. By wrapping the diverse
native OS GUI APIs into platform-independent MOAI classes, those classes reduce the
many faces of the different OS GUI APIs into just a single MOAI API face, carved in
stone by RapaGUI!

<p>
RapaGUI supports all the widgets you need to create modern GUI applications,
including multi-column listviews, treeviews, tabbed page widgets, toolbars,
text editor widgets, menu bars, HTML views and much more. The highlight of RapaGUI, however,
is certainly its inbuilt Hollywood MOAI class. This class allows dynamic embedding
of complete Hollywood displays into GUIs which can be used to combine Hollywood's
powerful multimedia functionality with RapaGUI's GUI abilities into one powerful
application.

<p>
RapaGUI comes with extensive documentation in various formats like PDF, HTML,
AmigaGuide, and CHM that describes the GUI programming basics in detail and provides
a convenient MOAI function and class reference. A step-by-step tutorial that guides you
through your first RapaGUI program is also included. On top of that, many example
scripts are included in the distribution archive, including advanced scripts
like a complete video player which really show off the power of Hollywood and RapaGUI
working together.

<p>
All this makes RapaGUI the ultimate cross-platform GUI toolkit, carefully crafted
for you sailors of the seven GUI seas! Only RapaGUI allows rapid cross-platform
GUI development on all islands - it is the ultimate fusion of all the different
OS GUI toolkits into one MOAI face, carved in stone for eternity and beyond.
