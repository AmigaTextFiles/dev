<h2 class="heading">2.4 Frequently asked questions</h2>

<p>
This section covers some frequently asked questions. Please read them first
before asking on the forum because your problem might have been covered here.

<p>
<b>Q: My GUI is not resizable. What am I doing wrong?</b>

<p>
A: There are some things that you need to keep in mind for the resize feature
to work correctly. If there is a widget in your GUI that has a fixed size, you need to
pad it using resizable <code>&lt;rectangle&gt;</code> objects on its sides. Then your GUI will
be resizable again. For example, imagine you have a 64x64 <code>&lt;image&gt;</code> object in a
horizontal group in your window. RapaGUI won't be able to resize this window unless you add
rectangle objects to the sides of your image object because RapaGUI needs to find an object
that can be resized so you need to take care that non-resizable objects in your GUI
are always padded with resizable ones. By the way, be careful with the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>
tag: Widgets of label class are actually not resizable because resizable labels look
quite awkward!

<b>Q: RapaGUI doesn't run on my Linux distribution although I have installed GTK+. What could be the reason for this?</b>

<p>
A: First make sure that you are using the correct RapaGUI version. RapaGUI for Linux
is available in versions for GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3. Typically, Linux distributions only
have one of the two GTK versions installed so you need to use a RapaGUI build that
matches your install GTK version. You could also be missing some third party shared
objects required by RapaGUI. To see what shared objects are required by RapaGUI, run
the following command in a console: <code>readelf -d rapagui.hwp</code>

<b>Q: When run on a high-DPI monitor my application appears blurry on Windows. Why?</b>

<p>
A: Make sure to set the <code>DPIAware</code> tag in Hollywood's <code>@OPTIONS</code> preprocessor command
to <code>True</code>. See <a href="HiDPI.html">High-DPI support</a> for details.

<b>Q: RapaGUI's treeview widget doesn't work on Android. Why?</b>

<p>
A: Android doesn't have a native treeview widget which is why RapaGUI can't support
treeviews on Android.
