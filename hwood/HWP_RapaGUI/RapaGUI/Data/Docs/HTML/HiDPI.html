<h2 class="heading">3.12 High-DPI support</h2>

<p>
RapaGUI has full support for high-DPI displays. Normally, RapaGUI handles everything
automatically for you so that your application should look the same regardless of the
monitor's DPI setting. This is achieved by handling all position and size values in
<a href="DIP.html">device-independent pixels</a> which makes RapaGUI applications scale nicely
to different monitor DPI settings. Furthermore, RapaGUI will automatically scale all raster
graphics, e.g. button images set using <a href="ButtonIcon.html">Button.Icon</a>, to fit to the monitor's DPI
setting.

<p>
Note that RapaGUI's automatic scaling of raster graphics could lead to images becoming
blurry on high-DPI monitors. You can change that by either providing sets of images for
different DPI settings instead of just a single image or by using vector images that can
be scaled with no losses in quality to any size.

<p>
For example, let's suppose you want to add a 32x32px icon to your button using the
<a href="ButtonIcon.html">Button.Icon</a> attribute. If you set <a href="ButtonIcon.html">Button.Icon</a> to a raster brush
and the user's monitor has a DPI scaling of 200% activated, RapaGUI will scale the
image to 64x64px which will look blurry. So you could either set <a href="ButtonIcon.html">Button.Icon</a>
to the identifier of a vector brush or you could create a Hollywood icon, add 32x32px
and 64x64px images (and possibly more) to it, and then pass this icon to <a href="ButtonIcon.html">Button.Icon</a>.

<p>
Note that in that case you'll also have to set the <a href="ButtonIconType.html">Button.IconType</a> attribute
to <code>Icon</code> to tell RapaGUI that you've passed the identifier of an icon instead of a
brush, which is the default type for <a href="ButtonIcon.html">Button.Icon</a>. In that case, RapaGUI
will use the 32x32px image inside the icon in case the monitor has no DPI scaling
activated or it will use the 64x64px image in case the monitor has a DPI scaling of
200% activated. If the DPI scaling is something between 100% and 200%, RapaGUI will
scale the image inside the icon whose size is closest to the desired target size.

<p>
By default, all widgets that support images expect you to pass Hollywood brushes.
If you always want to pass Hollywood icons instead, you can also set the global
attribute <a href="ApplicationUseIcons.html">Application.UseIcons</a> to <code>True</code>. This will change the default
of all tags accepting images from Hollywood brushes to Hollywood icons.

<p>
As described above, when providing images to RapaGUI using Hollywood brushes that
contain raster data, RapaGUI will automatically scale those raster brushes to fit to the
current monitor's DPI settings. If you don't want that, you can set the <code>ScaleGUI</code>
tag to <code>False</code> when you <code>@REQUIRE</code> the RapaGUI plugin. See <a href="RequireTags.html">Initializing RapaGUI</a> for details.
Bilinear interpolation during scaling can be turned off by setting the <code>InterpolateGUI</code>
tag to <code>False</code> on <code>@REQUIRE</code>. Alternatively, automatic image scaling can also be configured
on a per-widget basis. For example, for button images you can control automatic image
scaling by setting the <a href="ButtonIconScale.html">Button.IconScale</a> tag.

<p>
Also, all <a href="Hollywood.html">Hollywood widgets</a> will be automatically scaled to
fit to the current monitor's DPI settings. If you don't want that, you can set the <code>ScaleHollywood</code>
tag to <code>False</code> when you <code>@REQUIRE</code> the RapaGUI plugin. See <a href="RequireTags.html">Initializing RapaGUI</a> for details.
Bilinear interpolation during scaling can be enabled by setting the <code>InterpolateHollywood</code>
tag to <code>True</code> on <code>@REQUIRE</code>.

<p>
With <a href="Scrollcanvas.html">Scrollcanvas class</a> the dimensions you specify in <a href="ScrollcanvasVirtWidth.html">Scrollcanvas.VirtWidth</a>
and <a href="ScrollcanvasVirtHeight.html">Scrollcanvas.VirtHeight</a> are in <a href="DIP.html">device-independent pixels</a> by default and
RapaGUI will automatically apply the system's scale factor to the contents drawn by the <a href="ScrollcanvasPaint.html">Scrollcanvas.Paint</a>
function. If you want to have fine-tuned control, you can set the <a href="ScrollcanvasAutoScale.html">Scrollcanvas.AutoScale</a>
attribute to <code>False</code>. In that case, <a href="ScrollcanvasVirtWidth.html">Scrollcanvas.VirtWidth</a> and <a href="ScrollcanvasVirtHeight.html">Scrollcanvas.VirtHeight</a>
are interpreted as physical pixels and no auto scaling will be done so that your paint function can
draw high resolutions graphics without any quality loss due to scaling.

<p>
Finally, keep in mind that you explicitly have to enable DPI-aware mode on Windows
if you want your application to support high-DPI modes natively. This can be done
by setting the <code>DPIAware</code> tag in the <code>@OPTIONS</code> preprocessor command to <code>True</code>, e.g.

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>@OPTIONS {DPIAware = True}
</pre></td></tr></table><p>

If you don't do that, your application won't be DPI-aware which means that Windows
will run it in a special compatibility mode. In this compatibility mode, Windows
will scale your application to match the monitor's DPI setting but this will lead
to a blurry appearance. That's why it is suggested to set <code>DPIAware</code> to <code>True</code>, as
shown above.

<p>
Note that on Linux you should use the GTK+ 3 version of RapaGUI if you want to
support high-DPI modes because GTK+ 2 doesn't support high-DPI modes very well.
