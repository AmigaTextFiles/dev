RapaGUI was written by Andreas Falkenhahn. The design was inspired by my MUI Royale plugin
which only runs on AmigaOS and compatibles and was first published at the end of
2012. First experiments with a wxWidgets-based GUI toolkit for Hollywood were already
started in 2013. Initially I just planned to create a wrapper plugin that allows
Hollywood scripts to use wxWidgets but then I realized that the wxWidgets API can
be quite complicated to use and I thought that a MUI Royale-based approach would
be much more user-friendly and convenient for GUI scripting. By imitating the MUI
programming paradigms in RapaGUI I could also release versions for AmigaOS and compatibles
making RapaGUI the first cross-platform GUI toolkit to support the Amiga's native MUI
toolkit. Thus, RapaGUI has the potential to make a dream of many Amiga users come true:
To have a cross-platform GUI toolkit which uses native widgets on all platforms! RapaGUI
has finally accomplished this mission.

Thanks have to go to the wxWidgets team and Stefan Stuntz for their wonderful GUI toolkits.
Special thanks go to Vadim Zeitlin and Eric Jensen for their valuable help on wxWidgets
and Thore B&ouml;ckelmann for his instant MUI fixes and his openness towards useful MUI
extensions which he also implemented very quickly.

<p>
Additional thanks to Alfonso Ranieri for TheBar.mcc and codesets.library, Allan Odgaard for
TextEditor.mcc, HTMLview.mcc and the TheBar.mcc, HTMLview.mcc and TextEditor.mcc Open Source
Teams for maintaining those classes and fixing old bugs.
