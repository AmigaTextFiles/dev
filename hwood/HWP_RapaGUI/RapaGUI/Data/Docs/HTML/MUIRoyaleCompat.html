<h2 class="heading">3.22 MUI Royale compatibility</h2>

<p>
RapaGUI started as a fork of the popular MUI Royale plugin for Hollywood and people
familiar with MUI Royale will no doubt see that RapaGUI shares the very same design
so porting applications from MUI Royale to RapaGUI isn't particularly difficult.
Although there have been many semantic changes to abstract RapaGUI from AmigaOS-based
terminology, the real design differences are actually very few. Thus, when porting applications from
MUI Royale to RapaGUI most of the time you will just be busy with changing names.
Most people probably won't even encounter one of the very few design differences
between MUI Royale and RapaGUI. Still, here is a non-exhaustive list of design
differences between MUI Royale and RapaGUI to simplify your porting endeavours:

<p>
<ul class="toc">
<li>&ndash;&nbsp;MUI Royale required you to handle <a href="WindowCloseRequest.html">Window.CloseRequest</a> for all your windows
or they would stay open. RapaGUI automatically closes windows that haven't got a listener
for <a href="WindowCloseRequest.html">Window.CloseRequest</a> installed.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;MUI Royale also required you to handle the &quot;HideWindow&quot; and &quot;ShowWindow&quot; events to
allow the minimizing of windows. RapaGUI handles this automatically now.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;RapaGUI automatically sets up event handlers for buttons, toolbar buttons and
menu items. MUI Royale required you to explicitly request them but this led to
unnecessarily wordy XML files where you had to include something like <code>notify=&quot;pressed&quot;</code>
for each and every button because under normal circumstances you want to be notified
about each button click. RapaGUI automatically calls your event handler for all
button and toolbar button clicks and menu item events now to make the XML more
readable.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;RapaGUI automatically hides all Hollywood displays on startup whereas MUI Royale doesn't do this.
On MUI Royale you manually have to declare the default display as hidden.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;MUI Royale allows you to use text formatting codes almost everywhere. Since this is
a highly MUI-centric feature, this is impossible to implement in a platform independent
way. RapaGUI supports text formatting only in its <a href="Textview.html">Textview</a> and <a href="Texteditor.html">Texteditor</a>
classes and only if <a href="TextviewStyled.html">Textview.Styled</a> and <a href="TexteditorStyled.html">Texteditor.Styled</a> have been
set to <code>True</code>.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;MUI Royale also allowed you to include icons in almost all widgets via text formatting
codes. This is also impossible to implement in a cross-platform way. Still, RapaGUI has
icon support in many classes but the way this is implemented is always class dependent.
On RapaGUI you can use icons with the following classes: <a href="Button.html">Button class</a>,
<a href="Listview.html">Listview class</a>, <a href="Pageview.html">Pageview class</a>, and <a href="Treeview.html">Treeview class</a>.
Check out the documentation of these classes to learn more about how to use icons with
them.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;MUI Royale requires you to use an object derived from <code>&lt;virtgroup&gt;</code> class as the
child for <code>&lt;scrollgroup&gt;</code> objects. On RapaGUI you can just use normal groups.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;MUI Royale sends context menu events using the <code>Area.ContextMenuTrigger</code> attribute.
RapaGUI simply sends context menu events as normal menu item events but it includes a <code>Parent</code>
field in the event message to inform you about the widget whose context menu triggered the
event.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;RapaGUI's <a href="Checkbox.html">Checkbox class</a> class creates a checkbox and a text label.
MUI Royale's checkmark class simply creates a checkbox image and you have to create the label
yourself.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;RapaGUI doesn't have support for the <code>Listview.InsertPosition</code> attribute but its
<a href="ListviewInsert.html">Listview.Insert</a> method simply returns the position of the newly inserted
entry.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;In MUI Royale text editor ranges were indicated by block coordinates consisting of
four different values (x1, y1, x2, y2). RapaGUI just uses start and stop coordinates now,
so all the methods and attributes that deal with text ranges just require/return two
arguments now.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;RapaGUI's <a href="Texteditor.html">Texteditor class</a>, <a href="Textview.html">Textview class</a>, and
<a href="Textentry.html">Textentry class</a> use the content between the opening and closing XML tags
as the initial widget contents whereas MUI Royale always required you to use an attribute
to set the initial contents.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;RapaGUI requires you to specify a parent object most of the times when creating objects
dynamically using <a href="moaiCreateObject.html">moai.CreateObject()</a>. This wasn't necessary in
MUI Royale.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Since RapaGUI's <a href="Treeview.html">Treeview class</a> supports multiple columns, you have
to create at least one <code>&lt;column&gt;</code> when declaring your treeview in XML. This wasn't
needed with MUI Royale because its treeview class merely supports single column trees.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;MUI Royale doesn't have the concept of dialogs since AmigaOS doesn't have it either.
Modal dialogs were just emulated using normal windows and putting all other windows to
sleep. RapaGUI now introduces real dialogs. While with MUI Royale you would typically create
all those pseudo-dialogs at startup, this is no longer recommended with RapaGUI. Since windows
are quite a finite resource on some operating systems, you should create dialogs only when you
need them and destroy them immediately afterwards. See <a href="Dialog.html">Dialog class</a> for details. If you only
target AmigaOS, then you can of course still create all your windows with just a single
call to <a href="moaiCreateApp.html">moai.CreateApp()</a> but if you want to target other operating
systems as well, you should follow the recommended programming guidelines and create dialogs
when you need them and destroy them as soon as you are finished with them.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;Objects of <a href="Radio.html">Radio class</a> are always framed in RapaGUI. In MUI Royale they
aren't framed by default.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;When using a somewhat more complex shortcut string like <code>CTRL+V</code>, <code>Alt+X</code> or <code>F5</code> with
<code>Menuitem.CommandString</code>, MUI Royale doesn't automatically listen to it. This has
to be implemented manually. Only standard shortcuts in the form of a single alphabetical
key combined with the <code>CMD</code> key are handled automatically by MUI Royale. RapaGUI,
however, automatically handles complex shortcuts as well.

<p>
</li><li>&ndash;&nbsp;When getting <a href="ListviewActive.html">Listview.Active</a> and no entry is active, MUI Royale returns
the special string <code>Off</code> whereas RapaGUI returns -1.
</li></ul>

<p>
Of course, there are also many attributes and methods that are present in MUI Royale
but missing in RapaGUI. The reason for this is of course that because of its
cross-platform design RapaGUI represents the lowest common denominator between
Windows, Linux, macOS, and AmigaOS. That's why not all MUI Royale features
could be transferred to RapaGUI.
