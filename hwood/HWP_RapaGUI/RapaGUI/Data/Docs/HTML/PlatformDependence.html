<h2 class="heading">3.21 Platform-dependent features</h2>

<p>
Generally speaking, RapaGUI tries to include as few platform-dependent features
as possible to allow the same application to run on a wide variety of platforms
without any adjustments. There are, however, very few attributes and methods
that, although not available on all platforms, are still included because they
were considered so important that they have been included although they somewhat contradict RapaGUI's platform-blind
GUI toolkit approach. For example, the <a href="WindowHideFromTaskbar.html">Window.HideFromTaskbar</a>
attribute is only available on Windows and GTK+ since there is no taskbar on
AmigaOS and macOS. Another example is <a href="ApplicationOpenConfigWindow.html">Application.OpenConfigWindow</a> which
is only available on AmigaOS and compatibles.

<p>
Features which are platform-specific are always documented as such. You just
need to look into the documentation to see if a certain feature is platform-specific.
To minimize platform-specific code, all platform-dependent features can be specified
on all platforms supported by RapaGUI as well. RapaGUI will just ignore the attributes
and methods then instead of reporting an error message. Thus, you could also set
<a href="WindowHideFromTaskbar.html">Window.HideFromTaskbar</a> on AmigaOS and macOS. RapaGUI won't report
an error message. The call will simply be ignored.
