hTeX 1.0
========

hTeX is a plugin for Hollywood that allows you to use the LaTeX markup
language from Hollywood. This makes it possible to easily display
mathematical formulas in your Hollywood scripts but of course you can also
use more advanced LaTeX features like tables, boxes, and various formatting
styles. On top of that, hTeX also allows you to export LaTeX formatted text
as PDF documents, SVG images, and PNG images.

Using hTeX is very simple and convenient because the plugin directly
interfaces with Hollywood's text library so you don't need to learn any new
functions but you can just use the functions from Hollywood's text library.
As soon as the hTeX plugin is installed, all functions from Hollywood's text
library will automatically be able to handle text formatted in LaTeX. hTeX
will make the text available to Hollywood as full vector text which means
that it can be infinitely scaled, rotated, and transformed without any loss
of quality.

The hTeX distribution comes with several examples as well as a comprehensive
documentation to get you started quickly.
