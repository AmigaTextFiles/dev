NOT FIXED KNOWN BUGS:
 * error report of the error in the last line in the include file name
   will report wrong file name; instead of include file name the parent
   file name is reported.

  (when I get good idea how to fix it, I do it, but right now, this
   bug happens only and only in several ocasions with probability
   1/10000000 and does not effect the output - lets rather do more
   important stuff first)

TODO_List()
 1. Segment References; (hierarch. removal support)
 2. Sections 
 3. Auto Linking Support 
 4. Segment functions as: start(segname), end(segname) and size(segname) 
 5. Debug Output (avaexe, almost finished)
