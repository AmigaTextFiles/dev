as31, is an 8031/8051 assembler. The program consists of the
following files:

	makefile	- Makefile.
	as31.h		- Package header file.
	as31.y		- Parser / code generator.
	lexer.c		- Scanner.
	symbol.c	- Symbol table / opcode table.
	emitter.c	- Object code generation routines.
	main.c		- Command line / calls yyparse().

	as31.man	- Assembler manual.

	new.asm		- Sample 8031 code. This is a working
			  debugger written by Theo Deraadt.

OVERVIEW OF AS31:
	as31 is a full featured assembler but it does lack
	facilities for linking several modules together.
	as31 can be configured to produced a wide variety of
	object output formats.
	One of the supported output formats is S-records.
		(Written by: Theo Deraadt)

	Standard assembler syntax is accepted.

MAKING AS31:
	On most unix systems, running make should be sufficient
	to produce a working assembler.

	Also typing:

		% make man

	Will produces a text file from as31.man (called as31.cat).
	This is the users manual.

	This package does work on the following systems:
		SUN 3 / SUN 4 (SunOS 4.0), Tandy 6000 (Xenix)

	Non-unix systems may require some porting for the FILE I/O
	stuff but most reasonable implementations of stdio.h
	should work.

SOURCE CODE:
	This code is public domain.

REPORTING BUGS:
	If any bugs are detected in this program, I would
	like to know about them so that I could fix them. I can
