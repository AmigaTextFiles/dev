I've been working on this project for a long time now. But it
never seems to get "completely" finished. So I have decided to release
it in it's current state and thus make it available to whom ever that
could be interested in it. Maybe support and bugreports from you will
make the project better in time.

No developement has been done to this project for many months now. And
the manuals are not really up-to-date, so I hope you will learn the
new features by looking in the history files which I've always kept
up-to-date. Despite it's incomplete status the programs are fully
functional. I and some of my friends have used them for years.

Any bugreports and/or comments may be sent to:

Please disregard any information on how to contact me in the rest of
the manuals. They are kind of obsolete.

Don't trust any information blindly. And if you do find mistakes
please do point them out to me so that I can correct them to the next
realese.

I know there are other cross assemblers around for the amiga but I've
never seen one which support local labels before. I just love local
labels. And I don't think there is a monitor available. So even if
you're accustomed to another assembler or even Stan Burtons
C-developement package I think you should check out the monitor. And
please tell me if anything went wrong.

One more thing. When trying to "connect" with the monitor. Do check
that the IRQ to the processor is high (i.e. not asserted). Else it
won't work.
