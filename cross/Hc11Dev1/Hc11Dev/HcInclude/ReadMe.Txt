Information about include files in this directory.

$VER: IncludeFile_Info 1.1 (16-Nov-93)

This directory contains include files to be used when programming.
Unfortunately I only have the files needed for the Hc11A0 ,A1, A8
(The file "A8Regs.i") and the F1 (The file "F1Regs.i"). If you are
using any other model you will have to make your own include file.
Information about what addresses the registers have can be found
in the "Technical Data" and the "Programming Reference Guides" for
the various models. If you make an include file similar to the
ones in this directory I would be glad if you would post them to
me so that I can include them in the next release of this package.
You can find information on how to contact me in the manuals for
HitAsm and HitMon11.

The file "RegsHc11.i" is not made by me. It's written by J P 
Somers (He/She is unknown to me). I don't know for what Hc11 it's
made so you'll have to compare notes to see if it matches with the
model you are using. It's quite extensive, even the bits in the
registers are defined. If you like it's style maybe you can modify
it to fit the Hc11 you are working with. If you do please post the
result to me.
