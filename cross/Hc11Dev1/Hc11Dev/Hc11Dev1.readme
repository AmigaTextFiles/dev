A develpoement system for the Motorola 68HC11 MCU line of processors.

Included is a cross-assembler supporting macros, local labels,
includefiles, conditional assembly and a rich set of pseudo opcodes.
The assembler will generate listfiles, Motorola S19 record files and
syblolfiles. (HitAsm v0.21)

Also in the package is a monitor that will interact with a "live" HC11
MCU over the serial port. Any serialport with a serial.device
compatible device driver can be used. Code present in the Hc11 can be
dumped or disassembled to your screen. Memory can be altered and S19
records can be downloaded and verifyed. The monitor transparently
reads and writes to on-chip EEPROM and RAM, and to what ever other
devices you have hooked up on the bus. The monitor will work with any
model of the Hc11 (I hope :). (HitMon11 v0.26)
