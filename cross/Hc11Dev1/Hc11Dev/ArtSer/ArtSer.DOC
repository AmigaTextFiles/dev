               artser 37.6 - replacement serial.device
                        By CBM & Arthur Hagen
                Latest version compiled on 1993/04/19
               =======================================

Just a debugged and optimised version of the C= serial.device 37.4.
All functions should be identical, but this one should be somewhat
faster and safer (the original contained code that trashed a byte when
closing the device).
To use this program, place it in your devs: directory, and select
artser.device instead of serial.device in your comms program.

Note to NComm users:
Because of a bug in NComm, it won't help if you select artser.device
as the device in the menu, since serial.device already is present in
memory, and thus artser.device cannot be loaded, since NComm "forgets"
to expunge the serial.device before loading the new one.  To use
artser.device, edit the file NComm:NComm.config, and replace the text
"serial.device" with "artser.device".  Then save and reboot before
starting NComm again.

Note to users of other comms packages:
If you cannot set the device in your comms program, don't despair.
Rename your old serial device to devs:oldser.device or something
similar, and rename artser.device to devs:serial.device.
Then edit or zap this file, and replace the two occurences of the
string "artser" with "serial".  If you already have used your comms
package since last reboot, you might have to reboot again before the
change will have any effect.

Enjoy,
