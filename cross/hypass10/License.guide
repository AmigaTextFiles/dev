    HypAss evaluation license and registration information

    Wherever the terms "HypAss" or "the archive" appear in this license,
    it means the complete contents of the archive HypAss**.lha, where '**'
    represents the version of the relating release.

    It seems that we have to feel like criminals, just because we supply the
    world with freely distributable software, or why do we need to write
    stuff like that?

@NODE COPYRIGHT_NOTICE
  COPYRIGHT NOTICE:

    HypAss and HyperSource are
    (c) Copyright 1998 Ralf Steines, Konz/Trier, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

    HypAss is released under the terms of 'Shareware'.

    HypAss IS *NOT* IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN!!!

    HypAss is made availlable to you for evaluation purposes within 30 days.
    If you think that this product fits your needs of a crossassembler you
    have to register. If not, you are not allowed to continue using HypAss.


@ENDNODE
@NODE DISTRIBUTION
  DISTRIBUTION:

    HypAss is freely distributable as long as
    the following conditions are met:

    The archive MUST STAY in its normal, UNMODIFIED state, with all original
    files supplied by me. It is not allowed to add a BBS remark or any
    other file to this archive. I explicitly forbid to spread this archive
    in unpacked form, not on CD and not on disk. Just spread the 100%
    original Lha-packed archive. HYPASS IS NOT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN!!!

    It is not permitted to use any part of this archive for any other
    purposes except for evaluating HypAss. All data contained in the archive
    must *NOT* be reprocessed to any other format, or any other computer
    except Amiga, and I explicitly forbid decompilation, reassembling and
    any other way of reversal engineering the programs and any part included
    in this archive.

    The archive may be spread on 1 single floppy disk if the disk is sold
    for less than 3.- german marks (or currency equivalent).

    The archive may be spread on CD, if the CD is sold for less than 25.-
    german marks (or currency equivalent) *AND* if the CD contains more
    than 400 MBytes of freeware/shareware UTILITIES and/or PROGRAMS
    *FOR AMIGA*, (no multimedia data collections but executable programs
    and their docs), *AND* as long as I get a free sample of any media
    containing the Hypass archive.

    Any FREE BBS and FTP-server may spread the HypAss archive as long as
    no donation is required to login or download *AND* as long it contains
    an extensive AMIGA area (more than 1000MBytes) or is Amiga-Only.

    General permission is of course given to the lords of Aminet®, the
    breath of our machines! Although outside the limits of cost for a CD,
    Fred Fish may include this archive in his library (for historical
    reasons). Thanks, Fred.

    This archive may *NOT* be spread on cover disks or cover CD's without
    my prior written permission.

    This program MUST not be used for any development of military machinary,
    even if used for civil purposes.

    Any commercial usage of HypAss is prohibited without prior written
    permission of the author.

    This archive must *NOT* be added to any commercial product!

    I explicitly forbid any usage, storage, inclusion of this archive in
    any part of their library in any way by PDSOFT, currently ESSEX/UK, and
    any possible actual or future daughter organisation, even when renamed,
    moved to another place or what ever may be done to escape these state-
    ment.

    There are many PD libraries which do their job in a clean way and earn
    enough to stay alife. But there also exist organisations which ignore
    all DISTRIBUTION NOTES which are written down in each authors document,
    and make by this illegal and immoral use of other peoples work.

    Amen.


@ENDNODE
@NODE DISCLAIMER
  DISCLAIMER:           I have the work, You have the risk!

    HypAss10 is supplied 'AS IS', and is not meant to be free of bugs. It
    is in its early state, without warranty of any kind, expressed or
    implied. You use this archive and its contents at your very own risk,
    and you take the entire responsibility and consequences of its use. I
    will not be liable for any special or incidental or consequential
    damages, even if informed of the possibility of such damages in advance.
    The risk is totally on your side, if you don't agree, you must stop
    using HypAss and delete the archive!


               ! DO NEVER USE THIS PROGRAM WITHOUT A HELMET ! ;-)

    Wherever the term 'future releases will have...', or anything having the
    same or a similar meaning, appears in these documents, it is just an
    idea, and there is no promise that there will appear even one more byte.
    I *really* want to continue developing HypAss to aproxximate being THE
    assembler one day, but nobody knows if I don't stop this tomorrow. There
    is no guarantee of any kind about this!

    Just one thing I promise: If somebody wants to make me program for PC,
    he has to buy away my mind!



@ENDNODE
@NODE EVALUATION_LIMITS
  EVALUATION LIMITS

    The evaluation version of HypAss is limited in some rare points,
     because you should have an additional reason to register:

        Source size:            unlimited
        Include size:           unlimited
        Include files:          unlimited
        Include nesting levels: unlimited

        Macro size:             unlimited
        Macros:                 unlimited     in LOWMEM mode all macros
        Macro nesting levels:   unlimited     must fit in 32K heap!

        Labels + symbols:       unlimited
        Forward references:     unlimited

        Object size:            unlimited    (if supported by object format)

    The term 'unlimited' means not especially limited by HypAss, but the
    limits of you memory and storage medium space can't be changed by HypAss
    for reasons you should normally know, if you are a programmer! ;-)

  LATEST NEWS:

    I have decided not to cripple hypass in any way, at least in this release.


@ENDNODE
@NODE USER_REGISTRATION
  USER REGISTRATION

    HypAss started as a little idea and went a huge project, as you can see
    in the @{" statistics " link hass:doc/-statistics.guide/main}, and I think it's worth to be continued. It may be
    also of your interest that this project will not disappear in a shelter.


  HOW TO GET A REGISTERED USER:

    HypAss is Shareware, as you could read in the copyright notice. So if
    you are interested to get a full user license for HypAss send me 30.-
    german marks (or US $25) by international money order or by cheque.
    This money must *reach* me, I will not pay for an exchange! Then
    print out the 'registration.form' in the docs archive. Fill it out with
    all necessary data, put it in a FREE letter, addressed at yourself,
    containing a formatted 3.5 inch floppy disk (DD or HD) and send it to
    me, and you will receive the latest, registered version of HypAss.
    I will not pay for postage! The postage to you will be at your own risk,
    so think well for which postage system your letter will already be paid
    for when it reaches me.

    Think well about registration *BEFORE* you send me anything! I can't
    give back any money later! You have a good chance to find out now
    weather you like HypAss or not!

    For registered users, any future updates will be FOR FREE!
    (Not the postage) I hate multiple paying for one single piece of
    software, what I've seen very often now.

    Each MAIN AUTHOR (and not the owner of the copyrights) who has ever
    written a freeware assembler for Amiga will get a registration for free!
    Just send me a disk as described before, and "identify" yourself by
    putting your latest assembler version on disk. ;-)


  REGISTRATION DISCLAIMER:

    Although a registration will give you the full license to use HypAss
    according to the conditions stated in this doc, you will not have a
    right for support in future (but a very good chance!). I'm interested
    myself to let HypAss grow, but nobody knows what will be tomorrow.
    Whenever there exist updates, you will have a right to receive them,
    if you send me a disk as described before. Evaluation updates will be
    released by the same electronic channels which brought you this release.
    The earliest place where these updates will occur is of course the
    directory 'aminet/dev/cross', what should signalize to you, that the
    time has come to contact me for a new registered version. This system
    is in the moment prelimary. *Maybe* a keyfile will be sent to registered
    users one day, activating the evaluation versions. Any section of this
    doc except the 'distribution' area still stay valid for registered
    users!


  HOW TO HANDLE A REGISTERED HYPASS:

    In opposite to the evaluation version, the registered version of HypAss
    is *NOT* freely distributable. You are not allowed to give a copy to
    anyone. You are allowed to make a safety backup for yourself. If
    everything breaks down, you may order a new disk from me (as described),
    that's no problem. The registered version of HypAss will carry your
    personal signature, so I can identify any illegal copy running around!
    You will be held responsible for any software piracy which may be a
    result of your registered version, direct or indirect.
    You are *not* allowed to sell your registered version of HypAss!

@NODE DEVELOPER_REGISTRATION
  DEVELOPER REGISTRATION

    If you are an *experienced* AmigaE programmer and if you want to see
    a syntax set, an object format or especially another CPU be supported
    by HypAss, then contact me. I'm preparing prelimary developers material,
    containing includes, structure definitions, example libraries and so on.
    HypAss started as a little idea and went a huge project, as you can see
    in the @{" statistics " link hass:doc/-statistics.guide/main}, and I think it's worth to be continued. It may be
    also of your interest that this project will continue to grow.


  HOW TO GET A REGISTERED DEVELOPER:

    HypAss is Shareware, as you could read in the copyright notice. This is
    also valid for developers. So if you are interested to get a full
    developers license for HypAss send me 60.- german marks (or US $50) by
    international money order or by cheque. This money must *reach* me, I
    will not pay for an exchange! Then print out the 'Developer.form' in the
    docs archive. Fill it out with all necessary data, put it in a FREE
    letter, addressed at yourself, containing a formatted 3.5 inch floppy
    disk (DD or HD) and send it to me, and you will receive the latest,
    registered DEVELOPERS version of HypAss. I will not pay for postage! The
    postage to you will be at your own risk, so think well for which postage
    system your letter will already be paid for when it reaches me.

    Think well about registration *BEFORE* you send me anything! I can't
    give back any money later! You have a good chance to find out now
    weather you like HypAss or not!

    For registered users and for developers, any future updates will be
    FOR FREE! (Not the postage) I hate multiple paying for one single piece
    of software, what I've seen very often now.


  DEVELOPERS REGISTRATION DISCLAIMER:

    Although a registration will give you the full license to use HypAss
    according to the conditions stated in this doc, *AND* to use all
    supplied material to create extensions of HypAss, you will not have a
    right for support in future (but a very good chance!). I'm interested
    myself to let HypAss grow, but nobody knows what will be tomorrow.
    Whenever there *exist* updates, you will have a right to receive them,
    if you send me a disk as described before. Evaluation updates will be
    released by the same electronic channels which brought you this release.
    The earliest place where these updates will occur is of course the
    directory 'aminet/dev/cross', what should signalize to you, that the
    time has come to contact me for a new registered material. This system
    is in the moment prelimary. *Maybe* a keyfile will be sent to registered
    users one day, activating the evaluation versions. Any section of this
    doc except the 'distribution' area still stay valid for registered
    users and developers!


  HOW TO HANDLE THE REGISTERED DEVELOPERS MATERIAL INCLUDING HYPASS-DEV:

    In opposite to the evaluation version, any kind of registered versions
    of HypAss and any parts of the supplied developers material is *NOT*
    freely distributable. You are not allowed to give a copy to anyone.
    You are allowed to make a safety backup for yourself. If everything
    breaks down, you may order a new disk from me (as described), that's no
    problem. The registered developers version of HypAss including all other
    material will carry your personal signature, so I can identify any
    illegal copy running around! You will be held responsible for any
    software piracy which may be a result of your registered developers
    version, direct or indirect. You are *not* allowed to sell any part of
    this material!


  THESE RULES YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT TO GET A REGISTERED DEVELOPER:

    You are not allowed to create any commercial parts, which need HypAss
    to run! You are not allowed to spread any material before it is 100%
    tested by you *AND* by me. (Libraries do strange things if they are
    buggy, what may waste the whole appearance of the project)
    Your sources must be availlable to me for debugging and for recompi-
    lation when there are major changes. There will anyway be the need to
    change the main program and adapt it to whatever will be necessary when
    adding new features. (But no guarantee to implement your needs!). It
    will be necessary to work "hand in hand", because I will not give away
    the main sources of HypAss ;-). I'll not spread your sources, to NOBODY!
    The copyrights of your work will of course stay 100% with you.
    Additional parts to HypAss must be written using AmigaE 3.2++. Although
    small libraries may even be written using the EC 3.2 demo, I strongly
    recommend to register to help Wouter van Oortmerssen continue his
    genious project. (It's a pleasure to program in E!)
    You should send me a password directly!
