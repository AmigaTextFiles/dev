    I could imagine, that a developer will look in the aminet/dev/cross dir
    quite often, so I decided to release this "buglist/todo" file like this.

    This should not be a collection of arguments against Amiga, but a BUG-
    list where the developers maybe just find one idea.

@NODE AmigaGuide
  Dear AmigaGuide Developers!

  There are some basic needs in AmigaGuide which would horribly increase
  the already good quality of AmigaGuide:   (Datatypes 40.5/Multiview V40.8)

  ACCESS NODE FROM SHELL:

    In the moment I have not found out a way yet how to make Multiview
    display a required node from within the shell. It does not accept a
    path into the database. Emaple: My database is called t:kk/test.guide.
    Now I want to view another than the node main. It should be no problem
    to make this work: 'Multiview t:kk/test.guide/index'. datatapes should
    then first check if a file exists in this path, if not just the node
    has to be stripped off....  Via ARexx this is no problem, but there we
    have the problem to find multiview's port if there are multiples.


  RETRACE:

    Everybody who has intensively used AG-documents knows this problem:
    If you move through huge databases and browse somewhere, you have
    a "user confusing" retrace function. To properly encapsulate browse
    areas we may already specify \@PREV <samenode> at the beginning and
    \@NEXT <samenode> at the end. A very easy help to avoid the retrace
    confusion would be a \@RETRACE <mothernode> function defined in the
    first node of a properly enclosed browsable section, which should be
    valid until a none-browse operation gets activated. Then, there should
    be no retrace-memorization starting from a node which shows to be the
    beginning of a browse area, again until none-browse function. I guess
    this should not be a big problem to solve. And what about a menue
    'clear retrace buffer'?


  LINE TERMINATION:

    Another bug in AmigaGuide: If the last @ENDNODE line is not terminated
    by \\n, the whole database fails. What about adding a \\n when loading
    the database. (I guess we can spend this one byte)


  SHUT DOWN DATABASE:

    The arexx port of AmigaGuide is a good feature. But we *NEED* to close
    up a database in remote, when we may open it like that.


  CtrlC:

    Maybe a bug: Multiview sometime crashes intuition to deadlock, when you
    CtrlC while the intuition interface gets constructed. This may be a side
    effect of the really big list of pathes which MCP1.10 does to my system,
    but I do not have problems with other programs. It runs stable.
    I included a @{" patchlist ;-) " link Patchlist } for this, so you maybe see the hot spot
    with one look at it (Or you see that it could be no reason)


  ACTION BUTTONS:

    Another bug: Multiview may crash and seems to enforce around when a node
    within a link botton is not properly enclosed by *2* double quotes:
    \@{"bla" link "tralala} may crash MultiView.


@ENDNODE

@NODE Break
  Status/break

    What I missed very often now with the AmigaDos Status command is to
    break a process by name! There's no somehow easy way to break multiple
    processes having the same name by status<>break!

        Example:

        I launched 2 multiviews and want to break them both (because arexx
        doesn't support shutdown any more). So I have just CtrlC to remote.
        For this I use:

            Status com=sys:utilities/multiview

        The answer is:

            2
            5

        Now I can break them by:

            break 2
            break 5

        To manage this to a script is a horror!
        What would be really easy to write and realize:

            break com=sys:utilities/multiview

        Thank you very much.

    The last 6 entries I really don't understand, MCP patches asl.library to
    _asl.library, which runs reqtools.library. What does my screen grabber
    has to do with this? Maybe patchcontrol can't display nested patches.
