@NODE Hard_soft_requirements
  HypAss hard/soft requirements:

  Short:

    Works fine: A4000/030, Kickstart39.106, WB40.42, RAM 18MB,  use Installer.
    May work:   Any Amiga, Kickstart V34+,  WB V34+, RAM 512K+, use Installer.


  More precise:

    Memory requirements:

      Although HypAss may assemble small programs within 350-500K of free
      RAM I would say that you should have at least 1M of free memory. It
      is no good idea to work close to NOMEM conditions, because the most
      programs just crash if this happens. HypAss was extensively tested for
      such conditions and seems to be system friendly when crashing to the
      borders of your memory. HypAss checks its own stack size and displays
      its own memory consumption, and future releases will one day have a
      configurable safety memory that should prevent the system from LOMEM
      conditions. The current version of HypAss has a lowmem mode, which
      tries to reduce what can be reduced, but if your code is too complex
      (e.g. recursion or many symbols) there could be no reduction of the
      required memory space.


    Software requirements:

      OS 4.x:

        Please create an image file of your KickRom and send it to me!  ;->

      OS 3.x:

        Congradulations, you have choosen the right kernal. This Kickstart
        version enables all features of HypAss: Localization, HyperSource©-
        listings displayed my Multiview, direct links from within your
        actually displayed listing file to any part of your project and to
        any type of object files.
        You will of course have installed Workbench 3.x, including all
        datatypes. You should watch out for a binary.datatype which works
        proper with Multiview (I have not found any yet, V39.11 doesn't).
        The locale.library is required if you want e.g. german errors.
        HypAss checks if you own OS V39+ and will translate the backslash
        of your source file (\\) into a double backslash for Multiview.
        This documentation uses double backslashes to display one!
        HypAss was developed and tested using Kick3.0, Workbench 3.1 on an
        18MB A4000EC030/25.

      OS 2.x

        The lowest performanced system I tested was an A600 using Kick2.05
        and a mixture of WB2.0 and WB3.1 libraries. The locale.library of
        WB3.1 works fine with Kick2.05/37.175! (Amiga is ingredible). If no
        locale is availlable HypAss will use the builtin english catalog
        file. If you run Workbench 2.0 you should install AmigaGuide V34, but
        I have not made any tests with AmigaGuide V34 yet. If you own Work-
        bench 2.1 I guess there must be an amigaguide version supplied with
        it. I do not own WB2.1 (I just own original WB 1.2/1.3/2.0/3.0/3.1).
        If anybody wants to make a present to me please send me the ORIGINAL
        Workbench 2.1 disks for testing purposes. (No pirated material!)

      OS 1.x

        HypAss is designed to run on any Amiga using OS 34+ (Kick 1.2), but
        I have nothing like that any more (thank god), so using HypAss with
        Kick 1.x is totally untested! Anyway, you will not have the full fun
        of HypAss and of Amiga! I guess it's not worth to support Kick 1.x
        any more. I'm not sure if I will care of BIG problems you have with
        HypAss running Kick 1.x, but I'm very sure that one of the next
        releases of HypAss will detach from the 1.x community. I have worked
        a long time with Kick 1.2, then Kick 1.3, and I don't want to think
        of all this trouble any more. Amiga is grown to a stable working
        nearly perfect implementation of REAL multitasking, so why should we
        miss all these new features just to stay compatible to a collection
        of old bugs called Kickstart 1.x? Any future gui support of HypAss
        will require at least a working gadtools.library. I want to care of
        low performance Amigas and of small memory, so I will not use gui
        systems which even appear non-realtime on 25MHz 68030.

@NODE Installation_procedure
  HypAss installation procedure:

    Harddisk installation:

      The easiest way is, you double click the Installer icon, and one of
      the most style guide incompatible programs will do the installation
      for you. You have to create a new directory by Installer! Although
      HypAss requires a lot of libraries (in the moment 29), they will not
      be spread around in your system. All parts of HypAss stay within their
      own directory 'HAss:' (the home of HypAss).
      HypAss needs 3 assigns, they will be added by Installer, your User-
      Startup will also get this 3 new entries, but you need NOT reboot to
      make your first experiments. These are the assigns:

            HAss:       to find HypAss and its children.
            HInc:       for HyperSource© include files
            HSrc:       for HyperSource© source code


    Floppydisk installation:

      Hopefully nobody needs to work with HypAss under these conditions, but
      in general it is possible to run HypAss from floppy-disk-based systems.
      (other platforms can't do things like that any more!)

      The installer script is no help for you. Use tools like DirectoryOpus®.

      Format 2 disks. The first one you should call 'HAss', the second one
      'HSrc'. Because HypAss will additionally need a complete workbench
      disk, you should prefer to have two disk drives, df0: for the work-
      bench, and df1 for swapping the two disks named before.

      Copy the complete contents of this archive to the 'hass' disk, except
      the directories 'hsrc' and 'hinc'.
      Make a directory 'hinc' on the 'hsrc' disk. Copy the complete
      contensts (but not the directory itself!) of the 'hsrc' directory
      within this archive to the root directory of your 'hsrc' disk.
      Copy the complete contents of the hinc directory within this archive
      to the directory 'hinc' on your 'hsrc' disk.

      And last but not least, add this line to your user-startup-sequence:

        Assign hinc: hsrc:hinc.


@ENDNODE
@NODE First_HAss_experiments
  First experiments with the HypAss executable:

  NOTE!!!:

   This section was written before the GUI existed, keep this in mind.
   Many restrictions described here are not valid any more! I kept this
   section for people using pre 2.1 os so they could use hypass too,
   since the GUI requires kick20/wb21 (v37).

   All people using kick/os 3.x should open the GUI (called HypMake),
   and click at the "Make" button to choose a make file from the demo
   directory. Once the file is loaded you may click at the assemble
   button to see hypass work....


  First experiments with the HypAss executable:

    You MUST run HypAss from Shell. (currently)

    When entered from our lovely Workbench, there are 4 icons in the
    HypAss directory: The installer script, this document, the license,
    and an IconX script that will open a shell for you to run HypAss
    within. Whenever you run HypAss you should have it in your current
    dir or somewhere else in your path. Best is you leave it in HAss:
    and 'CD' there.

    -CD to hass:
    -type 'demo math v' and you will get thrown the first
     HyperSource© listing output in your face.

     'demo' is a batch file to start the HypAss executable with one of
     the example sources in the hsrc:demo directory. 'math' is the name
     of one of these examples. 'v' states, that you want to view the
     result by multiview (or whatever you may want to config).

     Try all these demo scripts which show some features of HypAss.
     Don't get shocked, there are some crazy programs, which I have
     written while developing HypAss for stress testing purposes.
     'Demo' itself is a batch file to demonstrate nested shell argument
     passing to HypAss.

     These buttons directly link to already processed HyperSource©-
     LISTING files!

       @{" 'demo math v'   " link hsrc:demo/math.hlst/main  }   Show the powerfull evaluator of HypAss
       @{" 'demo xass v'   " link hsrc:demo/xass.hlst/main  }   Shows all directives of xass syntax set
       @{" 'demo macro v'  " link hsrc:demo/macro.hlst/main }   Demonstrate multiple macro syntax sets
       @{" 'demo mexit v'  " link hsrc:demo/mexit.hlst/main }   Demonstrate conditional macro recursion
       @{" 'demo stress v' " link hsrc:demo/stress.hlst/main}   Some macro recursion stress tests

     GOOD LUCK WITH HypAss, and don't forget to take your pills.


@ENDNODE
@NODE How_2_read_these_dox
  How 2 read these dox:

    The documentation of HypAss was styled to be a reference manual in
    every-day-usage times. This may look a little irritating for beginners.

    For this I have choosen to give some navigating infos for beginners:

    Wherever you jump from the HypAss documentation home page, you see in
    the header line either a button with the info *** READ THIS FIRST ***,
    or an information what you should read first in this section. I have
    choosen this way, so you needn't scroll away this info later, because it
    should usually be enough to read it once. Later you have always the
    easiest access to more specific reference information.

    So if you are new to HypAss, you should always watch out for anything
    in the first line of each page that is embedded in '***'. If nothing
    like that exists, then you should read the page normally.

    Have no fear to climb in the document tree, the 'Retrace' button will
    bring you home again!  :)

      Have fun with HypAss!

  NOTE:

    Although writing english documents is not my quality, did I do it to
    offer my work to as many people as possible. This results in lots of
    silly grammatical mistakes, but take the information stored herein and
    use other literature to see perfect english dox. Please forgive me.
    It would have been the easiest just to write it in german language, but
    I didn't do this, because we are not allone on the world.

    I do not have any english Thesaurus, nor do I have any grammatical
    dictionary. I learned 7 years "Oxfort" english at a german high scool,
    to find myself nearly unable to use this knowledge. The most I learned
    after scool in foreign countries and from reading tons of hardware
    manuals. I beleave the german scool system is not good in teaching other
    languages, although I have been interested from the very beginning.

@NODE HypAss_Introduction
@NEXT HypAss_Introduction
    HypAss is the "spider-monster" which connects all sections of a
    HyperSource© programming system, as there are:

            global configuration
            localization
            context sensitivity
            syntax libraries
            math libraries
            processor libraries
            object libraries
            action batch files

    And additionally you may also use it as an assembler ;-)


@ENDNODE
@NODE BENCHMARK
  HypAss benchmarks

  I frequently optimize all routines, since I started the speed of HypAss
  increased about 500%.... (to be continued)
  Here are some examples to show that HypAss is neither the fastest nor the
  slowest assembler of the world:

  The first example is taken out the "WD65C816 S-NES Macro Assembler v1.4
  [MC68030], © 1993 by Infernal Byte, INC" example sources and contains
  405111 lines with rts each line:

    Source:  ram:rts.s (2025555 bytes)
      Code:             0 -> 62E74    =    405108 bytes
      Source:     2025555    Syntax:    XASS    Includes:     1
      Lines:       405112    Math:       HYP    Labels:       1 of 200
      Passes:           2    Cpu:       6502    Symbols:      2 of 200
      Memory:     2705336    Object:     CBM    Macros:       0
      Time:       07:36.4    Dummies:      0    FwrdRefs:     0

      This "speed" will increase by 100% when HypAss will have its
      multi-pass features. Then this will be solved in 1 pass. (now: 2)

        888  lines/s
        4442 bytes/s

      The horribly fast S-NES assembler just needs 22 seconds!


  This example contains 9271 lines real source code:

    Source:   hsrc:old/-JOIN.hsrc
      Code:             0 -> 2C42     =     11330 bytes
      Source:      219674    Syntax:    XASS    Includes:     1
      Lines:         9271    Math:       HYP    Labels:     705 of 2000
      Passes:           2    Cpu:       6502    Symbols:    498 of 2000
      Memory:      631968    Object:     CBM    Macros:      20
      Time:       00:16.5    Dummies:      0    FwrdRefs:   414
    No errors.

         561 lines/s
       13313 bytes/s

    When tested with buffalo32 source (about 130K), HypAss had 2 times
    the speed of AS11 from the motorola freeware assemblers.

    When tested with a 225K source in 47 includes, HypAss had 2.86 times
    the speed of XAss64 1.0.
