REVIEW

        This CD-ROM I bought because of the big talks about exclusively
        featuring the commercial full version of the A64 emulator 3.01
        by Questronix, distributed by PDSOFT (the CD is from PDSOFT)!

        Now I paid 30 marks at WOC exposure Cologne, Germany, and was really
        happy of getting this commercial product that cheap. (The original
        order form requests US$69.95 plus an additional fee for shipping,
        but for this you get a hardware interface to connect the 1541 floppy
        to the parallel port of the Amiga).

        Now when I was home, I directly started my Amiga and tried to launch
        the A64 emulator. My amiga reported (from WBL) Unable to open your
        tool 'A64'! Shit. So I tried it from shell: a64: bad loadfile hunk!
        So I looked in other directories, where I found 2 archives, one
        containing the 2.0 distribution (known not to run with WB3.x) the
        other archive containes the *DEMO* version of the A64 emulator 3.01!

        I was really angry and started snoopdos to verify if some font or
        library is missing (anyway, I know this program well from the demo
        version I am really familiar to). But snoopdos only showed that this
        program can't be executed by WBL or shell process. I verified the
        file structure of the CD: 100% ok. I made virus checks to the whole
        CD by VT2.82: nothing in unpacked area! So I knew that there was
        *no* accident, because there's *no* error on the CD. I read in the
        documetation in the CD cover how to prepare the preferences to run
        A64, all was done. This is no executable file, this file was made
        inexecutable! (Don't tell me by accident)

        They made a fool of me. In the directory where should be the original
        *WORKING* full version I could find (oh how nice of you) an error
        report template. OK forget about A64 3.01 full version.

        I looked around what else I can find on this CD to slow down my
        anger about the waste of money for me:

        The CD contains at all 490.7 MB of data, that's ok I think.
        Let's describe the portions:


        C64 RELATED DATA:

          180 MB      C64 demo disks lha-archived as files (not disk images)
          246 MB      The same, but as disk images in D64 format.

            0.6 MB    C64 pics as iff pictures.

            0.25 MB   C64 music
           12.4 MB    C64 Sidtunes in PlaySID format


        PC RELATED DATA:

            0.38 MB   PC-archivers without docs.
           11.3  MB   PC <> C64 utilities
           12.9  MB   PC <> Spectrum,Mac utilities
            1.0  MB   PC <> Amstrad utilities

        MAC RELATED DATA:

            0.6 MB    Mac <> C64 utilities
            1.6 MB    Mac <> Spectrum utilities

        ATARI RELATED DATA:

            0.8 MB    Atari <> Spctrum utilities


        AMIGA RELATED DATA:

            0.85 MB   A64 3.01 MAD full version, DOESN'T WORK

            5.5 MB    Unpacked Amiga <> C64 utilities,
                      containing Frodo 1.5 unpacked featuring the original
                      copyrighted C64 basic and kernal ROMs, which are not
                      included by Frodo for this!!!. Maybe they were allowed
                      to spread this kernals? But why then putting them in
                      the frodo dir?
            2.8 MB    The same stuff as the 5.5MB above, but as lha archives,
                      containing also A64 3.01, but the *DEMO* version. All
                      material on this CD is stored twice, once unpacked,
                      once archived EXCEPT the original sick A64 3.01!!!!!!
                      This one is archived in another version (of course)

            6.7 MB    Unpacked amiga utilities from lha to virusz, all as
                      full packagages mostly including docs! Yeah!
                      But contains ReOrg3.11 and DNet without docs and the
                      DMS2.0 version, which is known to contain pirated data.

            0.9 MB    Amiga <> spectrum utils

                      didn't clean it since OS V34. This is really true.
                      Here you can find all V37 shell commmands, 2 version

                      I know myself from Kick 1.3 times. You find here for
                      example "CopyMemQuicker" or "ColourPatch", "DiskDoktor

            0.28 MB   Commercials for other CD's of PDSOFT (who created
                      this desaster)


        The CD comes with a CDMANAGER having a nice gui to search/copy/unpack
        and allows 3 kinds of 'about' about PDSOFT. All in all it is just a
        GUI for Lha 1.38 to process the lha-stored C64-demo disks.
        You may comfortably choose which demo you want to be processed.
        When you select the list function you must be very fast, because the
        program switches to workbench sreen, opens a window there and runs
        as many lha's as disks belong to the selected demo. The listing will
        scroll out of the window independently of the fact if you have seen
        something. At the end it awaits an 'escape' of you, so you can't
        control the gui completely by mouse. When you select the unpack
        button the same procedure repeats, but now you can choose the
        destination directory to unpack to before lha gets launched to do the
        job. The problem is only that you can't create directories from
        within the gui. Sou you must always switch to another tool to do this,
        what is really nerving.
        There are really lots of demos in the C64 archives, and they
        are nearly all packed (It's nearly inpossible to get more data on
        a C64 disk) Lha was mostly compressing these files with 0-10%! SO
        you really get a lot of data. The complete data is from old hacking
        groups, 90% demos and some C64 cracking utilities, some ripped
        assemblers and many hardcore/sexual named material. When I was
        searching for assemblers by 'asm' I found about 20 programs ending
        in '**gasm'. About the quality of these demos I just could say that
        I owned more interesting C64 demo collections 12 years ago.
        This material has one interesting fact: you see how computers and
        programming quality increased. The disks contain for example an
        assembler with 3 directives! .BYTE / .WORD *and* .TEXT and a doc
        says that it's finally *THE* assembler for the C64! Funny stuff.

        You may test these files by the already installed Frodo package,
        because the Frodo package is installed with the copyrighted original
        C64 ROMS. (it's good that this one isn't damaged)

        All the unpacked amiga utilities may be entered from a magicwb
        iconed workbench. Even the original workbench files have MWB icons.

        The program PlaySid 3.0 may be used to play all SID tunes (from WB)

        All C64 pics have icons which start MultiView when double clicked.

        Neither the SID tunes, nor the pics nor the demos contain anything
        special, but they may be interesting for historical reasons.

        The word "sensations" that can be found in the title has *nothing*
        to do with any corner of the CD.

LIKES & DISLIKES

        So far, I have yet to find anything I like about this CD.


BUGS

        None found.


CONCLUSION

        I am not sure weather PDSOFT got permission to spread a mixture of
        ALL generations of Workbench releases I have ever seen on ONE CD,
        but if they haven't this is extremely illegal as far as I know.
        I really found parts of V34/35/36/37/38/39/40 !!!!
        (I don't want to talk about other commercial parts on this CD).

        I am a programmer myself, and each release of any program I have
        seen yet (e.g. on aminet) explicitely states that the program's
        may *NOT* be spread in single pieces or without docs.

        The Lha doc states that lha may not be used for commercial products,
        but maybe they got permission from the author.

        As far as I know, it's not ok to spread the complete C64 basic ROM
        and kernal, stated in any C64 emulator I have seen yet, for any
        platform I know, but maybe they got permission.

        I could not find the MagicWB documentation, although it's the whole
        appearance of the workbench.

        Sorry, but I have never seen such a dirty work.
        (And I own tons of CDs)

        I would give this CD 1 star out of 10.
        (Because of the traditional demos and pics)
