ERROR: Source line too long (max. 255 chars).
KEY:   ERR_LineTooLong

DESCRIPTION:

       This error should normally never occur.
       It may be, that the source file you processed
       does not contain line termination characters.
       It may also be that you process a source which
       uses single $0d termination for each line.
       Use a text filter to convert before then!

KEY:   ERR_UnknownOperator

DESCRIPTION:

       You have used a non existing mathematical operator in your
       calculation. (e.g. 22@3)

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_UnknownOperand "Unknown operand."
ERROR: Unknown operand.
KEY:   ERR_UnknownOperand

DESCRIPTION:

       You have used an illegal element in a calcutalion, where

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_Overflow "Overflow, result too big."
ERROR: Overflow, result too big.
KEY:   ERR_Overflow

DESCRIPTION:

       While the whole calculation is signed 32-bit integer, and I
       have not found out how to handle 32bit overflows in AmigaE
       yet, this error can't occur for now.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_UnfinishedTerm "Unfinished term."
ERROR: Unfinished term.
KEY:   ERR_UnfinishedTerm

DESCRIPTION:

       This error occurs when there's an unexpected end of line in your
       formula or calculation.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_TermTooComplex "Term too complex."
ERROR: Term too complex.
KEY:   ERR_TermTooComplex

DESCRIPTION:

       There were too many operands or too many operators within your
       formula or calculation. This is nearly impossible to occur.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_DivisionByZero "Division by 0."
ERROR: Division by 0.
KEY:   ERR_DivisionByZero

DESCRIPTION:

       This is a very traditional thing: Mathematics ignore the fact
       that 1/0=the universe  and that 1/universe=0, because this TRUTH
       will throw away all mathematical laws. (You know: 1*0=55*0, so 1=55)
       Anyway: 1/0 does not fit in 32bit integer, so this error occures.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_MissingComparisonOperator "Missing comparison operator."
ERROR: Missing comparison operator.

       that was disabled in the character conversion table.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_IllegalRadix "Illegal Radix (2 - 36)."
ERROR: Illegal Radix (2 - 36).
KEY:   ERR_IllegalRadix

DESCRIPTION:

       The numerical base choosen by you was not within the valid
       range. The valid range is 2-36, because only the characters
       0-9 and a-z or A-Z are supported by the numerical parser.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_RedefinedLabSym "Label already defined."
ERROR: Label already defined.
KEY:   ERR_RedefinedLabSym

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_WrongLabelAlignment "Wrong label alignment."
ERROR: Wrong label alignment.
KEY:   ERR_WrongLabelAlignment

DESCRIPTION:

       You have tried to define a label 'between' two addresses. Some
       CPUs have word aligned data bus, and don't accept byte accesses.
       (e.g. PICs) So labels can just be defined on even addresses.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_LabSymNameTooLong "Label name too long."
ERROR: Label name too long.
KEY:   ERR_LabSymNameTooLong

DESCRIPTION:

       The name of a label or a symbol in your source code is too long.

ERROR: Symbol Phasing error (P1: $%lx, P%ld: $%lx).
KEY:   ERR_SymbolPhasing

DESCRIPTION:

       The value a symbol should be assigned to was not the
       same in pass 1 and pass 2, maybe because of forward

DESCRIPTION:

       You tried to use an addressing mode
       that is not allowed for this mnemonic.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_IllegalRegisterAddressing "Illegal register addressing mode."
ERROR: Illegal register addressing mode.
KEY:   ERR_IllegalRegisterAddressing

DESCRIPTION:

       You tried a register addressing mode
       that is not possible. Maybe you combined
       two registers that may not both be passed
       to the relating mnemonic.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_BranchOutOfRange "Branch op%ld out of range (%ld - +%ld)."
ERROR: Branch op%ld out of range (%ld - +%ld).
KEY:   ERR_BranchOutOfRange

DESCRIPTION:

       The destination address of a branch was not
       within the required range. Range gets displayed.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_NoDirectPage "CPU doesn't support direct page addressing."
ERROR: CPU doesn't support direct page addressing.
KEY:   ERR_NoDirectPage

DESCRIPTION:

       You tried to set the direct page origin,
       while the choosen CPU doesn't support
       direct page optimized addressing.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_NotPageAligned "Address must be page aligned."
ERROR: Address must be page aligned.
KEY:   ERR_NotPageAligned

DESCRIPTION:

       You tried to set the direct page origin
       to an address that is not page aligned.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_NotInCurrentPage "Address not in current page."
ERROR: Address not in current page.
KEY:   ERR_NotInCurrentPage

DESCRIPTION:

       The operand passed to the actual mnemonic
       is not within the current direct page,
       and there is no addressing mode to reach
       the required address by extended addressing.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_OutOfCpuSpace "Program counter out of processor space."
ERROR: Program counter out of processor space.
KEY:   ERR_OutOfCpuSpace

DESCRIPTION:

       The processor you have choosen is not able
       to handle the actual address, because it's out
       of the valid range.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_OpenObjectLib "Can't open Object library."
ERROR: Can't open Object library.
KEY:   ERR_OpenObjectLib

DESCRIPTION:

       The Object library you have choosen does not exist,
       can't be loaded, or has the wrong version number.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_AscendingPCrequired "Ascending program counter required."
ERROR: Ascending program counter required.
KEY:   ERR_AscendingPCrequired

DESCRIPTION:

       You use a binary object format and try to ORG
       backwards. This is not permitted, because this
       would create an objectfile about 4 GB size.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_OutOfObjectSpace "Program counter out of destination space."
ERROR: Program counter out of destination space.
KEY:   ERR_OutOfObjectSpace

DESCRIPTION:

       The object format you have choosen is not able
       to handle the actual address, because it's out
       of the valid range.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_OpenObject "Error opening object file."
ERROR: Error opening object file.
KEY:   ERR_OpenObject

DESCRIPTION:

       The object file you have choosen can't be opened.
       It may be that another program has a lock on it.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_WriteObject "Error writing object file."
ERROR: Error writing object file.
KEY:   ERR_WriteObject

DESCRIPTION:

       The object file you have choosen was opened successfully,
       but writing it completely did not succeed.
       It may be that the destination storage was full.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_CloseObject "Error closing object file."
ERROR: Error closing object file.
KEY:   ERR_CloseObject

DESCRIPTION:

       The object file you have choosen was opened successfully,
       but writing it completely did not succeed.
       It may be that the destination storage was full.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_OpenListing "Error opening listing file."
ERROR: Error opening listing file.
KEY:   ERR_OpenListing

DESCRIPTION:

       The listing file can't be opened. Close all multiviews
       and try again, cause multiview puts a lock on each file to read.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ERR_WriteListing "Error writing listing file."
ERROR: Error writing listing file.
KEY:   ERR_WriteListing

DESCRIPTION:

       The listing file was opened successfully, but writing it
       completely did not succeed. It may be that the destination
       storage was full.
