@NODE QUESTIONS "RST - WHO CAN TELL ME?"
  RST - WHO CAN TELL ME? (NOTHING WITH COMPUTERS)

    I've found some very special information about the Cheops pyramid in
    Egypt: Inside there are tunnels, full of this strange hyroglyph signs.
    It's telling the story of thousands of years in pictures. There are many
    dates (day/month/year) marked, without any description and context.
    I read that any date that was written down there, there happened very
    important things on the past. And now there's just ONE more date, that
    is in the future. It is the last date before Kings chamber, also known
    as the room of ever lasting knowledge, this date is the 9/17/2001!
    Now an astrologic woman asked me what will be with the stars this day.
    So I started the demo version of ASTROLOGIC V1.19 (just using it as a
    gui for UN*X astrolog) and looked what will be. I got a shock when I
    looked at this day, at my coordinates at 12 o'clock (11.00 GMT):
      Venus,Mars,Jupiter,Saturn,Uranus,Neptun,Pluto,
      Chiron,Ceres,Pallas,Juno,Vesta,MoonTransit,Ascendant,Medium Coeli,
      everything has the same coordinates in the same houses!!!
      The astrochart is just one line and one big bulb of planets on it!?
    I changed the time to 11.50 and then to 12.10, everything was totally
    different! What is this? What's gonna happen in the wire craft?
    May anybody tell me if this physical information is wrong?

@NODE HISTORY "RST - SHORT PERSONAL HISTORY"
  RST - SHORT PERSONAL HISTORY:

    I'm 32 years old, and I'm deeply envolved in assembler programming and
    electronics. I started with electronics when I was 8 years old, now I
    have 24 years of experience in this business.
    1983 I started to programm 6502 assembler (C= VC20), with the assemble
    command of a monitor program. This 'assembler' was able to handle !16!
    labels, but just the object file could be saved. Source files were an
    unusual thing in this time! Oh yeah, everything changed, what a goal.
    My favourite business is constructing computers (not by buying modules
    and putting them together), from the first idea to the finished, 100%
    home made multimedia project. 'Multimedia' is a word I use since 1983,
    since there have been the first people in my area making multivisions.
    (Using arrays of slide projectors). I do not mean the word multimedia
    that has been misused by a guy named Bill, who thinks this is a word
    for 2 really bad plastic speakers and one cheap 2nd class CD-ROM drive.
    My first controller I built was slave of a VC20 and was able to control
    64 output channels with relais (I hate these things). Later there were
    SCR controlled digital dimmers, slave to DMX512 250 kbaud data stream,
    realtime light morphing algorithms, multitasking, and everything running
    in my private computers, using my private kernals, PCB boards routed and
    produced on Amiga, first using DPaint, then PPaint! Now I've routed about
    250 boards on my Amigas, I produce the films on professional laser
    machines (don't know how they are called in english) with 2450 dpi
    resolution. The results are perfect PCB's without the need of any
    expensive PC-program and of Bill. (And I would say that nothing can
    route a PCB boards more effective than an experienced human brain!)

    SEE ALSO:  @{" EXAMPLE BOARD " system "sys:utilities/multiview screen hass:doc/-DSPA56FC.L180"}  50*50mm, original resolution 360*360dpi

    My other hobbies are metaphysical mindwarp and transcendental overflow,
    and sometimes I connect all my hobbies and write an assembler...

    This section should desribe, under which conditions all tests were
    made. A list of allways running utilities, which I have found out to
    be 100% stable (needn't think about any more) is added.
    I update this corner frequently, and every changes to my system get
    remarked here.
