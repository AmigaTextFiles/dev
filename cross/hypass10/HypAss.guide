  How 2 read these dox:

    The documentation of HypAss was styled to be a reference manual in
    every-day-usage times. This may look a little irritating for beginners.

    For this I have choosen to give some navigating infos for beginners:

    Wherever you jump from the HypAss documentation home page, you see in
    the header line either a button with the info *** READ THIS FIRST ***,
    or an information what you should read first in this section. I have
    choosen this way, so you needn't scroll away this info later, because it
    should usually be enough to read it once. Later you have always the
    easiest access to more specific reference information.

    So if you are new to HypAss, you should always watch out for anything
    in the first line of each page that is embedded in '***'. If nothing
    like that exists, then you should read the page normally.

    Have no fear to climb in the document tree, the 'Retrace' button will
    bring you home again!  :)

      Have fun with HypAss!

  NOTE:

    Although writing english documents is not my quality, did I do it to
    offer my work to as many people as possible. This results in lots of
    silly grammatical mistakes, but take the information stored herein and
    use other literature to see perfect english dox. Please forgive me.
    It would have been the easiest just to write it in german language, but
    I didn't do this, because we are not allone on the world.

    I do not have any english Thesaurus, nor do I have any grammatical
    dictionary. I learned 7 years "Oxfort" english at a german high scool,
    to find myself nearly unable to use this knowledge. The most I learned
    after scool in foreign countries and from reading tons of hardware
    manuals. I beleave the german scool system is not good in teaching other
    languages, although I have been interested from the very beginning.
