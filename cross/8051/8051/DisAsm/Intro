Feeling tired and frustrated at manually extracting those nasty binary opcodes
from your PROM?  Feeling stupid because you threw away your valuable assembler
program, or because you accidentally removed all your software files?  Well,
there's help on the way ... the 8051 DISASSEMBLER!

That's right, a disassembler for the Intel 8051 family of processors.  With
this, you can recover your code sans comments and English symbolic names and
make some headway in stemming the tide of ever-increasing disk entropy.

It's yours for free!  This is a one-time offer.  In addition to the disassembler
source, you will receive one (1) free 8051 assembler source file containing a
simplified version of the World's Smallest Multitasking Kernel (among other
goodies).  That's right, an 8-bit multitasking kernel that has already been
successfully been used in a time-critical stepper motor application, and other
applications.

Of course, if you feel this little gem has served you well, you are free to
express your appreciation (for example, by sending me a $20 donation, by buying
me cruise tickets for 2 for a Carribean cruise, or contracting me for any
future software development you want completed in a timely manner :) ).  Further
information is contained in the "readme" file contained in this package.

Be on the look-out for further software developments...
