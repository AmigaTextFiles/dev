The following files have been provided:

Dis8051.c ... The source for an 8051 disassembler.
Dis.doc ..... Notes on usage.
r.a ......... A non-trivial sample assembly program.
r.hex ....... Its Intel Hex listing.
entries...... A list of entry points to be used with r.hex.
r.s ......... The source derived from the Intel Hex listing.
Kernel.doc .. Usage notes on the multitasking kernel contained in r.a
              The documentation refers to some items not contained in r.a
README ...... This file.

The disassembler is small (under 400 lines), and fast, and it has come in
handy for me on several occasions.  It uses ANSI-C prototypes, and all the
library routines are ANSI-standard, so it will be portable to any system with
an ANSI-C compiler.

If compiled as an executable "Dis8051", then the command line used to generate
the file r.s above would have been:

                           Dis8051 <r.hex >r.s

There is no copyright on this software.  You may use it as you wish,
wherever you wish.  It is being distributed with the philosophy that the
more of my software pervades this world, and the more that my style influences
others, the better off software engineering (and the world) will be.
