  Freely distributable for non-commercial use (basically,
  don't sell this program without my permission. You can
  use it for developing commercial PIC applications, but
  of course I am not responsible for any damages caused by
  this assembler generating bad code or anything like that)


  Suggestions and bug reports are welcome.

  Code is (mostly) ANSI-C, and should compile with most
  platforms (It does assume that negative integers are
  stored in two's complement representation, and that
  'short' variables are at least 16-bit long. And it
  uses the strcasecmp() or stricmp() function)


 Command line usage:
    picasm [-o<objname>] [-l<listfile>] [-ihx8m] [-ihx16]
           [-pic<device>] <filename>
 
 Options:
    -o<filename>  Define output file name.
                  Default is <source_without_ext>.hex

    -l<listfile>  Enable listing. Default listing
                  file name is <source_without_ext>.lst

    -w            Give more warnings (omitted W/F-flags,
                  tris/option instructions on 14-bit PICs)

    -ihx8m        IHX8M output format (default).
    -ihx16        IHX16 output format.

    -pic<device>  select PIC device
     (16c54, 16c55, 16c56, 16c57, 16c64, 16c71, 16c74, 16c84)


  This is a single-pass assembler, forward gotos/calls are patched
  at the end of the assembly (only single labels are accepted in
  that case, otherwise expressions can be used too)

  In versions 0.99c and later forward references can also be used
  with movlw, addlw and retlw (only the low 8 bits of an address are used)

  Expressions can have the following elements:
  (from highest precedence to the lowest)

   integer constants
   symbols
   (<expression>)
   . (or $)   current location

   defined(symbol)      -- TRUE (-1) if symbol is defined else FALSE (0)

   streq("str1","str2") -- TRUE if strings are identical.

   isstr(arg)           -- TRUE is argument is a quoted string

   chrval("str", pos)   -- Returns ASCII character code from the string.
                           position range is from 0 to string length-1.
                           If position is out of range, returns -1.

   [expr1 expr2 ... exprn] -- the same as (1<<expr1) | (1<<expr2) ...
			(builds a number by setting individual bits)

   -   unary minus
   ~   bitwise not
 
   *   multiply
   /   divide
   %   modulo/remainder
   &   bitwise and

   +   add
   -   subtract
   |   bitwise or
   ^   bitwise exclusive or
   <<  shift left
   >>  shift right

   = ==   equal
   != <>  not equal
   <      less than
   <= =<  less or equal than
   >      greater than
   >= =>  greater or equal than

  The compare operators return TRUE (-1) or FALSE (0)
  (they are useful with conditional assembly)

  Expressions are evaluated as 32-bit integers (or whatever size 'long' is).

  hex numbers: 0x<digits>, h'<digits>' or <digits>h (must begin with 0..9)
  octal numbers:  <digits>o, o'<digits>'
  binary numbers: 0b<digits>, b'<digits>' or <digits>b
  decimal numbers without prefix or d'<digits>'

  Directives:
  (square brackets denote optional parameters)

<label>   equ   <expr>   - Define a constant ('=' also works)
<label>   set   <expr>   - Define a variable (similar to equ but
                           can be redefined with another set-directive)

  org <address>
  org <address>,<mode>
  org <mode>
    - Specify origin for program code, register file or data EEPROM.

    <mode> is 'code' for program code, 'reg' for register file
    and 'edata' for data EEPROM. If mode is not given, it is
    determined automatically from first instruction that generates
    output to the hex file. After that the mode cannot be changed
    without another ORG statement. When ORG is used with only
    the mode parameter, the address continues from the last value
    for that mode.


  include <filename>   - Include another source file. includes can be nested.

  end                  - End assembly. anything after this is ignored.

<label>  ds     <expr>   - Reserve <expr> number of file register (RAM)
                           locations. ORG must be set for this to work.
 
<label>  edata  <expr>[, <expr>...]
                         - Define data EEPROM contents (only with PIC16C84)

         if     <expr>   - Conditional assembly. If <expr> is non-zero,
        <code1>            <code1> after the if-directive is assembled,
        [else              and the optional <code2> is skipped. If <expr>
        <code2>]           is zero, <code1> is skipped and optional
         endif             <code2> is assembled.

<macroname> macro        - Define a macro.
            <macro definition>
            endm

   Macro parameters are \1...\9, \# is the number of parameters.
   \@ (or \0) is an number that is different  for each macro
   expansion (it can be used to generate unique labels inside macros).
   Macros can be recursive.

         exitm          - Exit macro (can only be used inside a macro
                          definition. Useful with conditional assembly)

 
         config <config_param>[, <config_param>...]
                        - Define PIC configuration fuse data.
                          <config_param> can be:

                          CP=<on_off>      - code protection (default off,
                                             PIC16C64/74 partial protection
                                             not suppored)

                          PWRT=<on_off>    - powerup timer (default on,
                                             not valid with PIC16C5x)

                          WDT=<on_off>     - watchdog (default on)

                          OSC=<osctype>    - oscillator type (HS,XT,LP,RC)

                          The <on_off> parameter can be:
                            on, yes, enable   - on
                            off, no, disabled - off

                          The fuses are located in address 0xfff with
                          PIC16C5x and 0x2007 with PIC16C64/71/74/84.


         picid <id1>,<id2>,<id3>,<id4>
                         - Define PIC ID values.
                           (not allowed with PIC16C64 and PIC16C74)
			   The ID is located in the hex file at the address
                           following program memory end with PIC16C5x,
                           and at 0x2000 with PIC16C71 and PIC16C84.

 
         device <device> - select PIC device type
                         Valid values are PIC16C54, PIC16C55, PIC16C56
                         PIC16C57, PIC16C64, PIC16C71, PIC16C74 and PIC16C84.


         opt    <option> - set assembly options
                         Currently only implemented:
                           list or l     - turn listing on
                           nolist or nol - turn listing off
