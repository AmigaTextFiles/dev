VERSION = 1.26b     ( <-beta: 'caz' need some more test's)


DESCRIPTION							  DESCRIPTION

What do you do with a Z80 Assembler on the Amiga ?
Right: playing with own Hardware Projects. This is the
idea of 'caz'. You can fully development your Z80 Code
on your Amiga.

'caz' should work with WB 1.3(not tested), 2.x,3.0 (tested).
The source is written in Ansi-C and should be running on every
system. So you can compile it on Atari's, Unix, MS-DOS, ...

USE:	caz [options] source-filename

	You must start 'caz' on CLI. To get a short description
	of all options type 'caz -h'. A more detailed documentation
	is 'caz.guide' (Amiga-Guide format, German only). No special
	libraries are needed.
