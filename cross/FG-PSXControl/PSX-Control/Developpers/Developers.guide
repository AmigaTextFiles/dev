   PSX-Control also offers the possibility for other coders to take advantage
   of the Playstation's capabilities. To help those coders (and not telling
   them to re-invent the wheel) some basic functions are included in
   PSX-Control that make their lifes a bit easier.

   Some of those functions include transfering and execution of files.

   Imagine you want to code a 3D-object viewer (with texturemapping and
   phong-shading and all those goodies), but you simply can't get it
   fast enough on the Amiga. Then the solution is simple: You transfer
   a homemade viewer executable to the Playstation, you put all the
   texture and object data on one PSX memory address and then run the
   program! If the user wants to view other objects, then you simply
   transfer new data to that address and re-execute the program.

   This is just an example of thousands of possible projects you can
   think of.

   Want to code a render plugin for your favourite renderprogram so
   you can see your rendered scenes immediatelly and realtime ? Or want
   to walk through your virtual dreamhouse or want to see how your house
   looks like when a plane crashes into it ? All this is now possible
   with the render capabilities of the Playstation.

   The main advantage of PSX-Control is that the util coder doesn't
   have to write his/her own software for every different type of
   Playstation development system there is. All these can be adressed
   in the same way using the psxamiga.library

                         @{B}  ·       @{U}REQUIREMENTS@{UU}        · @{UB}

   In order to develop for PSX-Control you at least need an Amiga that is
   capable of running PSX-Control :).

   Knowledge of how to use libraries can also come in handy, but if you
   want to develop some serious applications, knowledge of Playstation
   programming in general could be usefull.

******************************************************************************

@NODE Usage "Using the psxamiga.library"

@{B}                      - - --÷{· @{BG SHADOW}@{APEN 2}  PSX@{BG HIGHLIGHT}@{APEN 1}Control v1.0  @{BG BACKGROUND} ·}÷-- - -

                         @{B}  ·   @{U}USING THE LIBRARY@{UU}   · @{UB}

   Using the psxamiga.library is very simple: You open the library and call
   the functions you need! There are some things you REALLY should pay
   attention to though.

   @{u}Things to check in the psxamiga library base@{uu}

   * Before calling a function, always check the pa_Status. This @{b}must@{ub}
     be set to UBYTE 1 before you call a function. If it is set to UBYTE 0,
     then another program is already performing an action that locks the
     other programs out (eg. transfering of files). If another program
     is using the psxamiga.library, then the function calls will simply
     fail.

   @{u}The library functions@{uu}

   * Transfering of files is done by calling the function @{b}Transfer2PSX()@{ub}.
     This function automatically detects what kind of file you are transfering
     and will act accordingly.

     Executables will always be transfered to the CORRECT address. If you
     want to upload code at random addresses, then DON'T include the PSX-EXE
     or ECOFF header in that file, and specify the correct destination address
     (remember that PSX Executables are @{u}always@{uu} hardcoded for a certain
     address. On the PSX the rule:
     "@{i}coders that write from a fixed address should be shot@{ui}"
     is not valid.

     Data files are transfered to the address specified.

  * If you want to execute a file, then first set all registers to the correct
    addresses using the function @{b}SetCPUReg()@{ub} and then call the function
    @{b}PSXExecute()@{ub}. The registers you should AT least set are:

      EPC = The program counter. The Playstation will jump to this address when
            you do a PSXExecute().
      GP  = Global Pointer (usually set to zero)
      SR  = Stack Register (usually set to $801ffff0)

                         @{B}  ·  @{U}PLAYSTATION DEVELOPMENT@{UU}  · @{UB}

   Some important things you should know about Playstation development are:
     * Never transfer a file to the adressing range $80000000 - $0801FFFFF
       when the pa_System is YAROZE. The Yaroze terminal and LIBPS.EXE files
       reside at these addresses and overwriting them will make the Yaroze
       crash.

     * Take care when transfering files to certain addresses. If several
       programs are using the psxamiga.library at the same time, then those
       programs might overwrite addresses that you are using.
