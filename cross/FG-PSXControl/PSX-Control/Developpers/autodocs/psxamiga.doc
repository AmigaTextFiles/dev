    PURPOSE
        The main idea behind the psxamiga.library is to give programmer's the
        means to communicate with the Net Yaroze / Playstation as easy as
        possible. For the moment, only communications to the Net Yaroze are
        allowed, but in the future support for other development systems will
        be added.

        The psxamiga.library is a library that gets opened in memory as soon
        as the main tool PSX-Control is started.

        Some caution must be taken when using the psxamiga.library. Since
        almost all commands are executed by communicating with a terminal
        program, it might take some time before the command is actually
        executed. 

        ALWAYS CHECK THE PSXBASE pa_Status VALUE BEFORE CALLING THE FUNCTION.

        The pa_Status value should be 1 (UBYTE) before you can execute a function.
        When another program is using the library for transferring, this byte
        will be set to 0. 

        All functions will *FAIL* if you call them when pa_Status = 0.

psxamiga.library/SetCPUReg                         psxamiga.library/SetCPUReg

    NAME
	SetCPUReg -- Set an R3000 CPU register to a specified value.

    SYNOPSIS
	success = SetCPUReg(register, value)
        D0.l                D0.l      D1.l

        LONG      SetCPUReg(ULONG register, LONG value);

    FUNCTION
        Sets a particular R3000 CPU register to the value passed as "value".
        The value passed should be in regular BIG ENDIAN mode (take care
        when sending values gotten from Executables, since these are all
        in LITTLE ENDIAN mode).

        The registers that are recognized can be found in the psxamiga.i
        include file. Also read the notes for the registers there!

    INPUTS
       register = The register to change. Only use values as found in
                  psxamiga.i include file!
       value    = big endian value to put in the CPU register

    RESULTS
       success  = NULL for success, or (-1).l for failure.

    NOTES
        Currently supported development systems are: YAROZE

psxamiga.library/Transfer2PSX                   psxamiga.library/Transfer2PSX

    NAME
	Transfer2PSX -- Transfer a file to the Yaroze memory

    SYNOPSIS
	bytes = Transfer2PSX(destination, filename)
        D0.l                 D0.l         A0

        LONG    Transfer2PSX(ULONG destination, STRPTR filename);

    FUNCTION
        Transfers a file (specified by filename) to the specified memory
        adress. Executable files will automatically be transfered to the
        correct adress, data files are transfered to the address specified
        by "destination". The number of transfered bytes is returned in D0.
        If the user pressed abort, only the actual number of bytes is
        returned, so you might considering checking that a file actually
        completely got at the PSX-Side after this call.

    INPUTS
       destination = The destination adress in the Playstation memory.
                     This adress should be in BIG ENDIAN format.
       filename    = The file to transfer to the memory

    RESULTS
       bytes       = The actual number of bytes transfered. If the transfer
                     failed then this value will be NULL.

    NOTES
        Currently supported development systems are: YAROZE

psxamiga.library/TransferFromPSX             psxamiga.library/TransferFromPSX

    NAME
	TransferFromPSX -- Transfer a block of Yaroze memory to the Amiga.

    NOTES
        This function is currently not implemented because of hardware
        problems.
        
psxamiga.library/PSXExecute                       psxamiga.library/PSXExecute

    NAME
	PSXExecute -- Start the program that EPC currently points to.

    SYNOPSIS
	result = PSXExecute()
        D0.l     

        LONG     PSXExecute()

    FUNCTION
        Let the Yaroze terminal jump to the address that the EPC (Program
        Counter) currently points to. Make sure you set the EPC using the
        SetCPUReg function before calling this function!

    RESULTS
       result      = Succes/Failure indicator. If the function succeeded,
                     then this will be ULONG zero, otherwise it is the
                     IO_ERROR field from the IORequest.

    NOTES
        Currently supported development systems are: YAROZE

        During the execution of the program all other function calls are
        not possible because the Yaroze Terminal will go offline.
