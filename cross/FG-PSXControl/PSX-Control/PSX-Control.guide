@NODE Introduction "Introduction"

@{B}                      - - --÷{· @{BG SHADOW}@{APEN 2}  PSX@{BG HIGHLIGHT}@{APEN 1}Control v1.0  @{BG BACKGROUND} ·}÷-- - -

                         @{B}  ·       @{U}INTRODUCTION@{UU}        · @{UB}

   The Playstation probably is the most successful console on the current
   games market. People have always been very interested in creating
   games and demos on this remarkable piece of machinery. Sony answered
   the global demand for a hobbyist development system with the black
   playstation, the Net Yaroze.

   Unfortunately, the software that comes with the Net Yaroze is only for
   the PC. A few months after the initial Net Yaroze release, also support
   for Macintosh machines appeared. All us Amiga users were left in the
   dark.

   Until now!

   This development kit is a complete replacement for the official Sony
   kit. Its intended use is the official Net Yaroze package. I'm aware
   off the fact that there are people who create homemade links and other
   development systems. If PSX-Control also works on these systems then
   this is a pure coincidence and not encouraged by the authors.

   This is the documentation file for @{b}PSX Control@{ub}, the main
   control program for the Net Yaroze seriallink connection. It does
   the same things SIOCONS does on the PC, namely transfering files
   and running files (with some special goodies).

   Features of PSXControl include:

    * 100% OS Legal code (optimized 68020 assembler)
    * Complete font sensitivity
    * Configurable serial device, unit and baudrate. You can scan
      for the baudrate the PSX is currently working at. Ofcourse
      you can also change the PSX's baudrate through PSXControl
      (without having to restart PSXControl!)

    * Binary File upload to PSX (Data, PS-EXE, ECOFF)
    * Constant information on the status of the seriallink and PSX terminal
    * Audio CD player for the PSX
    * Support for SIOCONS and EZ-O-RAY auto batch files.

   Note: Please read the @{" Distribution " LINK "Distribution"} chapter for more info on
         PSX-Control. Please send us an email if you use it!

   To use PSX-Control in full extend, you at least need:
     * An Amiga with 68020 processor or higher.
     * Kickstart 3.0 or higher
     * A few bits of free memory (about 100k should be enough)

     * The Net Yaroze package

   @{B}Hardware installation:@{UB}

   You need a working Net Yaroze cable as hardware. Connect it to the PSX's serial
   port and then connect it to an Amiga Serial port. You might need to purchase
   an adaptor that will convert the 9-pin Yaroze serial connector to a 25-pin
   serial connector.

   For more information on connecting and starting your Net Yaroze, refer to
   your Net Yaroze's starter's guide.

   @{B}Software installation:@{UB}

   The installation is very simple. Copy the PSX-Control executable and icon
   file to a directory of your choice. The documentation can also be put
   anywhere you want it to be.

   For example: Copy everything to a directory called DH0:PSX/

   Before you actually run the program, you might want to have a look at the
   @{"usage" link "Usage"} of PSX-Control.

                         @{B}  ·       @{U}STARTING IT@{UU}        · @{UB}

   You can start PSX-Control without modifying any settings in the icon tooltypes,
   but it is advised that you at least have a look at them and adapt them where
   necessary.

   PSX-Control can be started from the CLI and from the Workbench.

   @{B}@{U}CLI usage@{ub}@{uu}

   PSX-Control accepts the following parameters:

                      (eg. serial.device / duart.device / gvpserial.device / ...)
                      Default: @{i}serial.device@{ui}

     @{b}U=UNIT@{ub}       -   The device unit where the Net Yaroze cable is connected to
                      NOTE: Only units from 0 - 9 are valid
                      Default: @{i}0@{ui}

     @{b}B=BAUD@{ub}       -   The baudrate the Net Yaroze BootCD is currently operating
                      at. The baudrate can be found at the main screen of the
                      Yaroze Terminal (as "Terminal baudrate <baudrate>").

                      after the "BAUD" tooltype upon startup. This takes a
                      few seconds at startup and is only usefull when your
                      memorycards are always full ;)
                      Default: @{i}No@{ui}

     @{b}LOGFILE@{ub}      -   If you want to keep a log of all actions, then you can
                      specify a logfile here. Only recommended for PSX-Control
                      debugging purposes. Note: This logfile grows fast!

   Here you can see :

   @{u}@{b}1) The status of the Net Yaroze@{ub}@{uu}

     The Terminal status is the most important statusreport. It informs you
     if the Yaroze terminal is operational with the current baudrate settings.
     Once the Terminal status is online, you can perform actions (such as
     transfering files, playing music cd's, ...).

     The Link status informs you if the link cable between the Net Yaroze
     and the Amiga is operational with the current device and unit settings.
     Once the Yaroze Terminal has started, this should say "Online". If it
     doesn't then you might want to check your @{" serial settings " LINK "Prefs"}.

     Note: The Terminal status cannot be "Online" when the Link status is
           offline!

   @{u}@{b}2) The status of PSX-Control@{ub}@{uu}

     The status of PSX-Control is shown in the middle of the window. Various

   PSX-Control recognizes scripts that were made for SIOCONS, CAETLA and
   EZ-O-RAY (three different development systems for the Yaroze and the
   regular Playstation).

                         @{B}  ·    @{U}TRANSFER TO YAROZE@{UU}        · @{UB}

   When you start a transfer to the Net Yaroze, a window will popup and ask
   you for the filename, destination address and filetype. It is very
   important that you enter all the data @{b}correctly@{ub} or otherwise
   you will most likely crash the program that you are uploading.

   To transfer a file, simply press the popup-gadget (marked with a
   questionmark "?") to select the file to transfer. PSX-Control will
   automatically detect what kind of file it is and adjust other settings
   accordingly.

   At this time, the following file types are recognized:

   * @{b}PSX-EXE files@{ub} : Standard Playstation executables.
                     PSX-Control will automatically fill in the correct
                     destination address. Do NOT upload the executable to
                     another address or it *will* crash.

   * @{b}ECOFF files@{ub}   : Executables compiled with the GCC compiler.
                     PSX-Control will automatically detect the correct
                     destination address. Once again, do NOT change it!
                     Uploading executable files to a wrong address will
                     result in a software crash at the Playstation side.

   * @{b}Data files@{ub}    : General data files.
                     You manually have to enter the correct destination
                     address for these files. The destination address can
                     be (or should be) in the documentation of the
                     program you are transfering.

   When all data has been entered correctly, you can press the "Go!"
   button to start the transfer of the file.

   During the transfer you can press the abort button to stop the
   transfer. Caution: If you abort the sending of files then you
   cannot launch the program anymore.

   If you're transfering an ECOFF file, then the file will be sent in
   four parts (this is done automatically). It is possible that there
   are some small delays during the transfer because PSX-Control has
   to initialize some variables before it can send more of the ECOFF
   data.

   After the transfer of executable files (such as PSX-EXE or ECOFF files)
   is finished, PSX-Control will adjust the Yaroze terminal to prepare
   for the launching of the file. This preparation is basically setting
   some Yaroze registers to the correct values (where it can find the
   executable, how large the executable is, ...). Once this preparation is
   done, you are ready to @{" start the file " LINK StartProg}.

   Once the transfering of executable files is finished, you can start the
   program you have sent by pressing the "Go!" button in the main PSX-Control
   window.

   If you turned on the @{" PSXDEBUG " LINK Prefs} option in the preferences
   menu, then you will get debugging information from the Yaroze while the
   program is executing. This debugging information will be shown in a
   window (that can be closed at any time). Once the execution of the program
   has finished, you will be notified and then you can close the window to
   continue working with PSX-Control.

   If you haven't specified the PSXDEBUG option, then the program will just be
   started and you can carry on using PSX-Control.

   @{b}Important:@{ub} During the execution of files you CANNOT use PSX-Control transfer
              functions since the Yaroze Terminal is offline. To re-enable the

                         @{B}  ·   @{U}SETTING PREFERENCES@{UU}        · @{UB}

   You can change your PSX-Control settings in the preferences window.
   There are two kinds of preferences to change: the serial settings and
   the global preferences.

   @{B}Serial settings:@{ub}
    You can enter the name of the device your Yaroze cable is connected to
    in the device name. Don't forget to enter the correct unit aswel.
    Examples:  @{i}serial.device@{ui} and @{i}0@{ui}
               @{i}duart.device@{ui}  and @{i}1@{ui}

    Then you have to enter the baudrate the Yaroze terminal program is
    operating at. You can see the baudrate in the Yaroze terminal. It
    is behind the text "Terminal baudrate". By default, the Net Yaroze
    starts at 9600 baud, but you can increase this rate to speed up
    transfers. If you don't know the baudrate, then press the "Autodetect"
    gadget to let PSX-Control find it.

    Note: If the baudrate you selected is too high, then you won't be able
          to use PSX-Control. You can experiment a bit with the baudrates,
          and once PSX-Control complains that the terminal is offline (or
          that it fails to set the baudrate) then the baudrate is too high.
          Good baudrates are: 38400 for standard Amiga serialports.
                              57600 for fast Amiga's and a standard serialport.
                              115600 for Amiga's with extra serial ports (such
                                     as the MultiFaceIII).

   @{B}General Settings@{ub}
    This are the settings for PSX-Control itself. You can choose the public
    screen you want PSX-Control to open its window on (press the "?" gadget
    to select one from the list).

    Furthermore, you can toggle the PSX-DEBUG option on and off. When this
    option is on, you will get various debugging information from the
    Yaroze terminal while it executes programs. If you turn this option
    off then you don't get any debugging information.

   In the next version of PSX-Control (which will immediatelly be bumped to
   version 2.0), a more dynamic plugin-system will be used to add support for
   all other PSX development systems out there. Currently planned plugins
   are : * Yaroze (This will be the current PSX-Control in plugin-form)
         * Hitmen (Support for their Serial 1.3 psx terminal program)
         * PAR    (Support for Action Replay, if it is possible hardwarewise).

   Every plugin will have the ability to add menu options to the main 
   PSX-Control menu. For example, Yaroze plugin will be able to add
   "Play MusicCD" and "Clear Terminal Screen" in a special Yaroze
   menu (these are all Yaroze-specific routines). The PAR plugin will
   have Cheatcode searching/writing menu options etc, etc...

   Ofcourse the main idea will be the same, one GUI for all these plugins,
   one library (the psxamiga.library) for the developpers that automatically
   uses the correct plugin. Ofcourse a lot more developper docs will be
   available (to write more plugins, to code the psxamiga.library, to code
   the psx).

   In order to write this PSX-Control v2.0, a complete rewrite of the code
   is necessary (currently the code is rather dependant on the Yaroze). 
   Ofcourse all this will be done in fast 68020 assembler, and little-memory
   consuming. (Add a 68020 to an A500 with 512k chip and it should still
   work :).

   The development of PSX-Control v2.0 depends a lot on the feedback that you
   users out there send us. If nobody cares then we won't spend 8 months coding
   PSX-Control v2.0 ofcourse ;)... So if you like PSX-Control v1.0, or if you
   have any suggestions/bug reports/like to chat about PSX coding, then please
   @{" contact us !!! " LINK "Authors"}.

   More information on this will follow soon.
