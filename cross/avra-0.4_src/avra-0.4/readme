----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction

avra is an assembler for the Atmel AVR microcontrollers, and it is
almost compatible with Atmel's own assembler. The difference is that
avra supports some extra preprocessor directives, and the macro-support
is better.

Since avra is written in ANSI C it should be possible to compile on
most systems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Installation

To install avra you should copy the avra-executeable to a apropriate location.

To compile you should rename the apropritate makefile, and do a make (use smake
for Amiga SAS/C, and nmake for Mickeysoft visual c++).


2.1 Linux

First you should compile the source by typing make.

avra should be copied to /usr/local/bin/ or other apropriate directory.

Doing a 'make install' will do the same thing.


2.2 AmigaOS

avra should be copied to c: or other apropriate directory.

If you are using the source-distribution a 'make install' will do the same.


2.3 win32 (Windows 95 (++) and Windows NT)

avra.exe should be copied to an apropriate location.  A 'nmake install' will
copy it and avra.def to c:\bin\

----------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Adding support for other systems

avra is written mostly in ANSI-C, so it should be possible to port it
to other 32-bit systems.

Checklist to do a port:
 -Make a system-dependent Makefile
 -Send your modification to the author, so they can be included in the next
  release.
