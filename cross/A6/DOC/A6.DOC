         1. Introduction

         A6 was written to be a cross-assembler to write code for the
         Commodore 64/128 microcomputers.  It was originally distributed
         only as MS-DOS binaries, and eventually I added Linux and Amiga
         distributions.

         Beginning with version 0.4.3, I have decided to release the
         assembler in source format under the GNU public licence.

         Binary distributions for Amiga and MS-DOS will be generated for
         A6, but the Linux binaries will be discontinued;  most Linux
         distributions contain GCC anyway, and this way I am no longer
         confining myself to i386 and kernel versions 2.0 or better.

         The auto-configure scripts that are found with the current
         version of A6 are very restricted in the number of compilers
         that they support.  If necessary, you can contact me and I will
         alter (or help you alter) the auto-configure scripts to support
         a currently unsupported compiler.

         To prevent annoyance, I've created a FAQ, which can be viewed
         at http://www.powerfield.demon.co.uk/a6/faq.htm

         2. New versions and contact information

         You can currently obtain A6 from the following web sites:
             http://www.powerfield.demon.co.uk/a6/        UK    home
         site

         There are currently no FTP mirrors.

         You can contact the author by email:
             simon@powerfield.demon.co.uk

         There is also an A6 mailing list, which is intended as a
         dicussion forum for the assembler.  To join it, send mail to
             majordomo@powerfield.demon.co.uk
         with the words "subscribe a6" as the body of the message.  I
         will happily guarantee that the mailing list will never be sold
         on to any junk emailers.

         If you have the time, and/or inclination, to work on A6, please
         join the mailing list.  I decided not to make two separate
         mailing lists so far, as there is very little traffic on the
         list.

         If you only want to follow the list, and don't want to be
         snowed under with the messages from the list, join the a6-
         digest mailing list instead.  This list will give you digests
         of the list, usually every 120 days, although if the size of
         the digest rises above 12,000 lines, the digest is generated
         before the 120 days are up.

         3. The A6 philosophy

         The A6 philosophy is simple: to produce a cross-assembler that
         assembles 6502 code efficiently and quickly, while retaining
         the syntax from the familiar "Laser Genius" assembler for the
         Commodore 64, as well as grafting in some of the command set
         from "Turbo Assembler".

         Many Turbo Assembler users have said to me that they won't use
         A6 because it doesn't use the Turbo Assembler syntax.
         Actually, the original Turbo is mainly a subset of the Genius
         syntax, and I suspect that both emulate some earlier, more
         obscure assembler.  Generally, both Genius and Turbo programms
         should (eventually) feel right at home with A6, and source
         codes written for either should be fairly portable to A6.  A
         quick nod will be made towards the command sets of AS65 and
         C64ASM, in order to make those users more comfortable as well.

         However, with the source code for A6 now freely available, it
         is possible for the user to modify the command set to suit
         themselves.  It is possible, in fact, that one day, I will
         separate the grammar from the assembler to the extent that it
         is changeable on the fly.  Which would be nice.

         4. Compiling and installing A6

         4.1 Compiling A6

         First of all, you will need to configure the source code for
         your platform.  There are three scripts you can run, depending
         on the platform that you are using.

         On Amiga DOS, type
             execute config.ami

         On MS-DOS, type
             config.bat

         On Unix, type
            chmod 755 config
            ./config

         The configuration script will then churn away and attempt to
         find the preferred compiler for your system, and then make the
         files "makefile" and "conf.h".  The configuration script will
         then print out the necessary steps to finish compiling A6.

         The final stage is to test the assembler;  this will be done by
         a program called "compare".  If compare reports any errors,
         please email the file "compare.txt" to
         simon@powerfield.demon.co.uk.

         If you need to make alterations to conf.h and makefile for
         another compiler, please e-mail them to
         simon@powerfield.demon.co.uk so that I can include the
         configuration details into the configuration scripts.


         4.1.1 Currently supported Amiga C compilers

         4.1.1.1 Lattice C

         A6 is written primarily with Lattice C under OS3.  There are no
         known problems with the Amiga configuration under Lattice C 5,
         although Lattice is missing several important defines from the
         latest ANSI standard.

         4.1.1.2 SAS C

         This is the latest version (that I know of) of the Lattice
         series of compilers.  As far as I am aware, there should be no
         problems compiling it with the script provided in config.ami.
         However, this has not been tested; if changes are required to
         the makefile and conf.h, please inform me.


         4.1.2 Currently supported MS-DOS compilers

         4.1.2.1 Borland C





         Page 6                                                 17/01/98


         A6 0.4.3 documentation          Copyright A6 Development Team, 1998


         I have successfully compiled A6 using a hand-written makefile,
         using Borland C 4.  Support for this compiler will follow in
         the next release.

         4.1.2.2 DJGPP (GNU C)

         DJGPP is the compiler under which the project began, and is
         therefore the preferred compiler for DOS.  I have set the
         makefile for a 386 or better.  DJGPP requires DPMI memory, and
         will not therefore compile on anything less than a 386.


         4.1.3 Currently supported Unix compilers

         4.1.3.1 GNU C

         The makefile for GNU C on Unix is written using new style
         rules, '%.o %.c', rather than '.c.o'.  If the makefile throws
         an error, you need to change this line in the makefile.


         4.2 Installing A6

         If you have compiled A6, you can install it using the target
         "install". by typing

             make install

         Under Unix systems, the binary will live in the directory
         /usr/local/bin.  Amiga makefiles copy the result into c:, where
         as DOS makefiles copy the result into c:\utils, which is where
         the result lives on my system.  For DOS installations, you may
         wish to alter this path or copy it directly.

         If you have downloaded a binary distribution, simply extract
         the zip, lzh or .tar.gz file into a directory and copy the
         binary into the directory of your choice.


         4.3 Important notice for Amiga users

         Amiga hard drive handling appears to be rather slow.  As A6 is
         quite heavy on disk usage, you might want to add another 20 or
         40 buffers to dh0:

             addbuffers dh0: 25

         At some point, I intend to try and take some load off the disk
         usage if I can.  At the moment, however, stability  and
         functionality are the prime concerns.


         4.4 Transferring code to the Commodore 64

         Many people have asked me how it to transfer the object code to
         the Commodore 64 after assembly.  Since there are so many
         possible platforms for this assembler (depending on where you
         compile it), this is left as an exercise for the reader.  I am


         Page 7                                                 17/01/98


         A6 0.4.3 documentation          Copyright A6 Development Team, 1998


         currently waiting for someone to get back to me with a possible
         solution for a PC or Amiga parallel port, watch this space for
         further details.

         In the meantime, I suggest PRLink, J-Net, 64Copy or Star
         Commander.  I recommend Bacchus/Fairlight's site at
         http://www.fairlight.to.

         5. Using A6

         A6 is a command-line assembler.  You will need a text editor to
         edit source files, and some way of executing the results.

         The general command line takes this format:

             a6 [switches] filename

         The switches have the following meaning:

         -d
              this switch makes the dot in front of assembler directives
              optional.  Thus, ".byte" could be used as "byte", without
              the leading dot.  This option is intended to help
              compatability with the AS65 assembler.

         -f<format>
              sets the output file format:
                -fb   Binary, assembled bytes written direct to output
                -fp   PRG file (Commodore binary file)
                -f0   P00 file (used by the PC64 emulator)

         -l
              generate listing (to standard output) on pass 2.

         -o<filename>
              set output filename.

              If no output filename is specified, it defaults to the
              name of the source file, with the appropriate extension.

         -s<0|1|2>
              restrict assembler syntax.  -s2 is the default.
                -s0   Laser Genius directives only
                -s1   Laser Genius and other assembler directives
                -s2   All directives, including A6 extensions

         -t
              list symbol table after assembly.

         Switches cannot be combined:  thus, '-fps0' is not equivalent
         to '-fp -s0'.


         5.1 Input and output file formats

         File format     Include    Output   Notes
         raw             .incbin    -fb      This is the default file
         format
         PRG file        .incprg    -fp
         P00 file        .incp00    -f0      Used by PC64 emulator

         6. Known bugs

             o  The makefiles are dreadful.
             o  Segmentation faults may occur on Linux, I'm going to try
                 and find a GPL version of lint and see what I can do
                 about that.
             o  Some undocumented opcodes may be specified incorrectly
                 in the assembly table.  However, use at your own risk
                 anyway.
             o  The new line parser may not recognise some of the
                 constructs that the old one handled in its myriad
                 special cases.  Please let me know if this is the case.
















































         Page 10                                                17/01/98


         A6 0.4.3 documentation          Copyright A6 Development Team, 1998


         7. Source file format

         In A6, each line consists of up to three fields.  Before the
         fields are generated, comments are stripped from the line.
         Comments always begin with the semi-colon character,  ';'.

         The possible line combinations are as follows:
             label
             label    = value
             label    opcode      expression
                      opcode      expression
             label    directive   [expression]
                      directive   [expression]

         Labels always begin in the first column of the line.  Opcodes
         always begin after some whitespace.  This was done as an
         optimisation, and generally does not, in my experience, tend to
         conflict with most programmers' indenting habits.


         7.1 Labels

         Labels can begin with any alphabetic character, or an
         underscore.  After that, labels can then consist of any
         alphanumeric character, underscore, dollar sign or dot.

         To access a global label within a local block, or to define a
         global label within a local block, precede it with an
         exclamation mark.  Thus, within a local section:
             label1
         and
             !label1
         do not refer to the same address.  A6 supports up to 32000
         local sections, which should be more than enough for most
         practical projects.

         The label "*" is reserved, and always refers to the current
         assembly position.

         You can enter a new namespace by using '.local' to enter the
         namespace, and '.endloc' to exit it.


         7.2 Opcodes

         Opcodes are case sensitive.  The following opcodes are
         supported:

             aax*   adc    alr*   amb*   and    asl    aso*   axh*
             axs*   bcc    bcs    beq    bit    bmi    bne    bpl
             brk    bvc    bvs    clc    cld    cli    clv    cmp
             cpx    cpy    cra*   dcm*   dec    dex    dey    eor
             hxm*   hym*   inc    ins    inx    iny    jmp    jsr
             las*   lax*   lda    ldx    ldy    lse*   lsr    nop
             npo*   oax*   ora    pha    php    pla    plp    rla*
             rol    ror    rra*   rti    rts    sax*   sbc    sec
             sed    sei    skb*   skw*   sta    stx    sty    sub*
             tax    tay    tsx    txa    txs    tya    xma*


         Page 11                                                17/01/98


         A6 0.4.3 documentation          Copyright A6 Development Team, 1998



         Opcodes that are marked with a star are undocumented, and can
         only be used when undocumented opcodes are switched on.  Please
         see section 8.9 for details of switching undocumented opcodes
         on.

         Opcodes are case-sensitive, thus BRK is not recognised as an
         opcode.


         7.3 Expressions

         Expressions are evaluated in a strict left-to-right order.
         Mathematical precedence is ignored.  Although this is somewhat
         non-intuitive behaviour, it is consistent with Genius, and
         allows the code to be easily read.  The following arithmetic
         expressions are supported:

             +                addition
             -                subtraction
             *                multiplication
             /                division

             ^ or |           bitwise inclusive-OR
             ^^ or ||         logical inclusive-OR (returns 0 or 1)
             &                bitwise AND
             &&               logical AND (returns 0 or 1)
             ?                bitwise EOR
             ??               logical EOR (returns 0 or 1)

             label1           label
             [label1]         is label defined? (returns 0 or 1)
             12345            denary (base 10) number
             $3039            hexadecimal (base 16) number
             @30071           octal number
             %1100000111001   binary number
             *                current assembly position

         Values can be prefixed with '-' to take the two's complement
         value.

         Expressions can be prefixed with '<' or '>'.  '<' allows the
         expression to return the lower 8 bits of the expression;  '>'
         allows the expression to return the upper 8 bits of the
         expression.  These are equivalent, respectively, to suffixing
         the expressions with '&255' and '/256'.

         Note: overflows and underflows in arithmetic are not detected,
         and do not cause either errors of warnings.  However, division
         by zero does cause a non-fatal error.

         8. Assembler directives

         Assemblers directives under A6 divide into three groups:
         Genius directives, Turbo Assembler directives, and A6
         extensions.  In this list, Turbo Assembler syntax (-s1) is
         marked with a star (*), and A6 extensions (-s2) are marked with
         two (**).

         You can specify that you want to drop the dot from the
         beginning of directives by adding the switch "-d" to the
         command line.


         8.1 .add** <value>, .eor* <value>

         These directives encode the output stream in whatever manner
         you desire.  Eor is part of the extended Turbo Assembler
         specification, and Add I have added for A6.

         Add is guaranteed to be performed _before_ Eor, thus the
         fragment

                     ldx #$0c
           lp1       lda encoded,x
                     eor #$40
                     sec
                     sbc #$20
                     sta $0400,x
                     lda #$01
                     sta $d800,x
                     dex
                     bpl lp1
                     rts

                     .eor $40
                     .add $20
           encoded   .tscrl "Hello, world!"

         Would print "Hello, World!" on the screen.  (This example is
         unashamedly CBM64 centric.  Sorry!)


         8.2 .align** <expression>

         Aligns the object code to a position;  especially important for
         time-intensive loops, where you don't need the cross-page
         timing penalties.  The expression should evaluate to a power of
         two, such as 4, 8, 16 or 256;  however, any expression is
         accepted, zero being automatically converted to 256.


         8.3 .block <expression>, .pad <expression>

         These two directives are included for Genius compatability.
         They both do the same thing, which is to pad the output stream
         with the required number of NOP codes ($EA).




         Page 13                                                17/01/98


         A6 0.4.3 documentation          Copyright A6 Development Team, 1998


         Note that this is _slightly_ different from the Genius syntax,
         because in Genius .block skips memory;  when I get round to
         supporting hex output formats, I'll make it conform to the
         Genius specification.

         Another point is that .block is used in some versions of Turbo
         Assembler for what I've called .local (an A6 extension).  This
         is also used by Thomas Lehmann's AS65 assembler on the Amiga.
         It's unfortunate, but to change .block would be to make A6
         break the Genius syntax.


         8.4 .byte <list>

         Shorthand: .byt

         This directive parses a comma-separated list of values and
         writes the output to the output file.

         Labels and characters are welcome in the output stream, and the
         following would be quite legal:

                     .byte "The zero page value is ",zz01,0

         provided the value of zz01 was 8-bit (i.e. did not exceed
         0xFF).

         If values do exceed 8-bits, a non-fatal error will be
         generated.  Text is interpreted according to the current
         character set, see section 8.5.


         8.5 .cset** <csetname>

         This directive sets the current output stream character set.
         The default is PET ASCII, but can also be PC ASCII, upper-case
         screen characters or lower-case screen characters.  Valid
         arguments for this opcode are as follows:

           ascii       PC ascii
           pet         PET ASCII
           scrl        lower-case screen characters
           scru        upper-case screen characters


         8.6 .echo** <string>

         Just your average echo;  copies the string given directly to
         the output.  At some time, I might change that so that it can
         print variables and so on, but for now, it's just an echo.


         8.7 .incbin** <filename>, .incprg** <filename>, .incp00**
         <filename>

         These directives specify that the required file is to be
         included directly in the output stream.  The file is opened,



         Page 14                                                17/01/98


         A6 0.4.3 documentation          Copyright A6 Development Team, 1998


         and its contents copied to the output stream at the current
         assembly position.

         .incbin assumes that the file is a straight binary file, such
         as A6 produces with no arguments (aka a Commodore SEQ file).

         .incprg assumes that the file is a Commodore PRG file, which
         contains the load address in the first two bytes.  The load
         address is ignored.

         .incp00 reads the file from a PC64 file image.  The header
         details and file load address are ignored.


         8.8 .include** <filename>

         Shorthand: .inc

         This directive specifies that the required file is to be
         processed as though it were part of the current file.  The file
         is opened, read in, and then closed once the file finishes.
         Control returns to the file that opened it.

         You can nest .include directives up to a limit of 32.  There
         are a maximum of 64 files allowed per project, which on the
         CBM64 tends asymptotically towards about 1,024 bytes of object
         code per file.


         8.9 .local**, .endloc**

         .local begins a local block, and .endloc leaves the block.
         Within a local block, labels with the same name as global
         labels can be defined and used as though they were global
         labels.  When .endloc is encountered, A6 leaves the block and
         returns, either to the local block outside the current local
         block (they can be nested up to 32 blocks deep), or to the
         global structure.  Here is an example:

             label1 = 4
                    .local
             label1 = 5
                    .byte label1
                    .endloc
                    .byte label1

         This piece of code produces the bytes $05 $04 in the object
         code.

         Please see section 7.1 for further details.


         8.10 .org <expression>

         You can set the output position for your code using this
         directive.  However, ".org" can be used only _once_ per
         assembly stream, and if you try to use it again, it throws an



         Page 15                                                17/01/98


         A6 0.4.3 documentation          Copyright A6 Development Team, 1998


         error.  If you want to re-define the output position, use `*='
         or .block or .pad (see section 8.2)


         8.11 .tasc**, .text*, .tpet**, .tscrl**, .tscru**, .txt**

         These six directives are similar to .byte, but only support
         text directives.  Labels, numeric expressions and other values
         are not permitted in text lines.

         .text and .txt support the current global characterset, as
         defined by .cset.  The others are designed to be used locally,
         where another character set is temporarily required:

           .tasc     PC ascii
           .tpet     PET ascii
           .tscrl    Lower-case screen characters
           .tscru    Upper-case screen characters


         8.12 .undoc**, .noundoc**

         Enable and disable undocumented opcodes.  These work, although
         they will be replaced later by a method of loadable CPU tables.


         8.13 .ver <version>

         This directive came in with version 0.4.3, and is compared to
         an internal number that indicates the version number.  The
         current version is $0403, and you can use this number to define
         that your source code requires A6 v0.4.3 or better.

         A6 assumes that the next minor version is incompatible enough
         to be worthy of an upgrade;  therefore, .ver $0500 will always
         cause your source code to fail.


         8.14 .word <expression>

         This directive parses a comma-separated list of 16-bit values
         and writes the output to the output file, in low/high format
         (low byte first).

         Labels are welcome in the output stream, and the following
         would be quite legal:

                     .word $1234,ad01,0

         If values do exceed 16-bits, a non-fatal error will be
         generated.

         9. Version history

         Version 0.4.3 18-Jan-1998
             o  Rewrote a lot of the documentation (again), including
                 remembering to document .word (oops!)
             o  Untested support for environment variable "A6_INCPATH"
                 added.
             o  Source released under the GNU Public Licence!!!
             o  Changed colon on global references to bang (!) instead,
                 to avoid clashing with what will be the macro
                 invocation character (:).
             o  DOS switches now only invoked with '-'.
             o  Rewrote line parser to be cleaner, faster and less
                 memory-hungry.
             o  Command-line options are now case-sensitive.
             o  Symbol table printout no longer crashes when you use
                 local labels.
             o  Some errors now print more useful info.
             o  The reported errors with local labels turned out to be
                 problems in my 6510 source code, not with A6  :-)
             o  Added .align, .ver.

         Version 0.4.2  27-Sep-1997
             o  Problems with the new opcode table corrected for BEQ,
                 LSR, NOP and XMA.
             o  Must be going mad:  I'd put the code in for .PAD, but
                 forgot to add it to the directives tables.  Doh!
             o  Added ??, && and ^^ operators.
             o  Allowed global reference to labels with colon.
             o  Added [defined] construct.
             o  Fixed .cset so it recognises "scrl" not "srcl"  ;-)
             o  Huge speedup to dereference labels, though still nowhere
                 near as fast as I'd like.
             o  Added variable support.
             o  Rewrote lots of the documentation.
             o  Fixed silly bugs in command line options.

         Version 0.4beta1  21-Sep-97
             o  .UNDOC and .NOUNDOC added.
             o  Massive speed increases all round.
             o  -d flag added.
             o  Local labels fixed.
             o  Linux and Amiga distributions added.
             o  Allowed "*=" expressions without any spaces in them.
             o  Dots and dollar signs are now allowed in labels.
             o  Re-ordered to-do list to indicate which order I guess
                 I'll implement everything in.

         Version 0.3 (beta)  21-Jul-97
             o  .BYTE and .TEXT stuff reworked - you can now mix
                 argument types between chars, numeric values and
                 strings, separating them with commas.
             o  .WORD is now recognised (forgot to increment the
                 directives count)
             o  Problem with forward references being invisibly ignored
                 in .BYTE and .WORD (leading to PC-overflow on next
                 label) now fixed.  (Fixes the previous known bug

                 "sometimes unneccessarily reports that PC counter has
                 wrapped")
             o  "Undefined label" error now tells you which label it
                 couldn't find.
             o  Various optimisations here and there.  (Hopefully a
                 little bit quicker).
             o  Assembly files now start at line 1, instead of line 2
                 (oops ;-)
             o  .LOCAL and .ENDLOC added to support local labels.

         Version 0.2 (beta)  10-Jul-97
             o  Added syntax levels for restricting available syntax.
             o  Fixed some bugs in string-insensitive compare routine.
             o  Single characters now allowed in expression.
             o  "ROL A" forms of accumulator instructions now permitted.
             o  Started adding Turbo Assembler syntax (I was asked for
                 it, I didn't _want_ to do it!)
             o  Lower-case character values corrected in PET ASCII
                 character conversion routine.
             o  Commas now allowed in quoted strings in .text arguments.
             o  .WORD now works, instead of being synonyms for some of
                 the .txxx series.

         Version 0.1 (beta)  3-Jul-97.
             o  First version.  Very few facilities.

         10. Development roadmap

         If you're looking for other features in the assembler, here is
         the roadmap of round-about when I think I'll have these
         features ready.  If you want to go and add them yourself,
         please email me your modifications so that I can share them
         with the A6 user community.  Your effort will be credited.

         0.4.4:
             o  Add T64 and Genius compressed hex as output formats.
             o  Finish the new-improved, faster expression parser.

         0.5 series:
             o  Macro support.
             o  Environment variable to specify include paths
             o  .image directive.
             o  Add Intel and Motorola hex as output formats.
             o  Add T64 as an "incbin" format under the name "inct64".

         0.6 series and beyond:
             o  Conditional assembly.
             o  Startup file to specify options for project.
             o  100% Genius compatability.
             o  Genius-style listing.
             o  Genius-style concordance table.
             o  Ability to assemble "compressed" Genius source files.
             o  Support CPU tables loadable from files.


         Silly things I might do if you ask nicely enough:
             o  Support EBCDIC.
             o  Support base 12.
             o  Support custom character sets. (1)
             o  Support custom CPUs (useful for generating p-code???)
