     SMEGICOM 2 Amiga To Magicom Link Cable (SMEGCable) [TX & RX]


The SMEGCable will let you transfer and receive data to and from the
Magicom and does not need to use the joystick port like some progarms.

The cost of the chip (74LS241) is less than the price of a 9 Pin D
Connector needed for the Joystick Port type cable.  Also the receive
speed is greatly improved.


NOTE !!!!..

The chip must be of the type LS as there is limited power available
from the parallel port of the amiga (LS only takes 25mA on standby).
The parallel port is current limited, to only 100mA.


The diagram @{" SMEGCable.pic " system "/Utilities/PPShow SMEGCable.pic"} shows you how to make the SMEGCable.

It can fit inside the back shell of a 25 Way Connector.  (A bit
tight!!)


The diagram @{" SMEGLED.pic " system "/Utilities/PPShow SMEGCable.pic"}  shows you how to make the addon interface
which indicates if you are in transfer or receive mode.

This interface can use either a Bi-Colour LED or Two LED'S, Red/Green.
If a Bi-Colour LED is used, connect the common leg to the 0V Pin, 20.

                                                            THE SMEG.
