NOTE  WELL:  MODIFYING ANY NINTENDO GAME  CARTRIDGE  INVALIDATES  YOUR 
GAURANTEE AND ANY WARRANTY AGREEMENTS APPERTAINING TO SAME. 

The SMEG DSP Cart is made from  an old game cart which has a DSP  Chip 
inside ie:  MARIO KART / PILOT WINGS / SUPER AIR DIVER

  MARIO KART / SUPER AIR DIVER are both high ROM games..
  PILOT WINGS  is a low ROM game..

Files you need before you start :-

         @{" DSP.PIC2 " system "/Utilities/PPShow DSP.PIC2"}   Shows Mario Karts Control chip pin-outs.

Components Needed

  1: 74LS139  x 1
  2: 74LS241  x 1
  3: Single strand insulated wire.

Once you have got your cart and have the components..

It  is time to take the cart apart, this can be done with a  soldering 
iron  by  pulling the cart apart and just warming up the tops  of  the 
screws,  with the soldering iron stop warm as so as it starts to  come 
apart.   This will stop the plastic from getting too melted.  Remember 
you  have to put the cart back together after!. Next you will have  to 
remove the unwanted components from the PCB and cut some tracks.

Which cart are you modifying ?  @{" Mario Kart " link MARIOKART}

  MARIO KART

On  this  cart you have to remove the ROM / BATTERY /  BATTERY  RAM  / 
LOCK-CHIP

You  will  be  left  with only a 74LS139 / 74HCU04 /  DSP1  /  XTAL  / 
TRANSISTOR and the odd cap or two..

NEXT  Cut all tracks that go to the LOCK-CHIP but leave the  pads  and 
the power (pins 8 / 16).

Cut  the DSP LEGS pins 26 / 27  but leave enough leg to solder to  !!, 
remove the rest of the leg from the hole.. for both (pins 26 / 27 )

It is now ready to be modified..

  PILOT WINGS

On this cart you have to remove the ROM / LOCK-CHIP

You will be left with only a 74LS139 / 74HCU04 / DSP1 / XTAL / and the 
odd cap or two..

NEXT  Cut all tracks that go to the LOCK-CHIP but leave the  pads  and 
the power (pins 8 / 16).

Cut  the DSP LEGS pins 26 / 27  but leave enough leg to solder to  !!, 
remove the rest of the leg from the hole.. for both (pins 26 / 27 )

It is now ready to be modified..

  THE MAIN MOD !!!
  ----------------

Right  solder the 74LS139 in the place where the lock-chip  came  out, 
(with pin 1 were pin 1 was !!).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Use diagram @{" PILOT.PIC " system "/Utilities/PPShow PILOT.PIC} if you are modifying PILOT WINGS..

Use diagram @{" MARIO.PIC " system "/Utilities/PPShow MARIO.PIC} if you are modifying MARIO KART..

Bend all the legs out of the 74LS241 and cut them short


               BEFORE                      AFTER
               _______                    ________
            --I_______I--              --I________I--
           I             I          


(enough  to  solder to). Stick the chip down with  some  double  sided  
sponge tape in the middle of the ROMs place, so that pin 1 is near pin 
1 and pin 11 is near pin 17.


NEXT comes the wiring ...

On the 74LS241 wire pin 10 to the ROMS pin 16, pin 20 to the ROMS  pin 
32.  This powers the chip.

Wire the rest for the legs using the single strand wire to the correct
places  on the pcb, this could be a leg of a chip or a pad  where  the  
chip was  before it was taken out (the ROM). Use the info supplied for 
this ..

 @{" DSP-ROM.PINS " link DSPROMPINS}

If   you are modifying PILOT WINGS (40)A15 is not used on  this  cart.   
You  will  have to scrape off the lacquer right from the  top  of  the 
connector and solder your wire on there .

  (40 -  Edge connector pin 40)

You  will see on the diagrams that there are connections marked to  go  
to  a pin on a 74LS139 this is not the one in the diagram but the  one   
which  was  in  the  cart at the start and not  your  added  one,  all 
connections to this chip are show in the diagram..

----------------------------------------------------------------------

  For Both Carts And Modes
  ------------------------


  !! WARNING !!
  -------------


MAKE ALL WIRES AS SHORT AND AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE. AS GLITCHING  CAN  
HAPPEN IF THE WIRES ARE TOO LONG OR CRISS CROSS ALL OVER THE PLACE !!

Once  all  the  wiring is complete check that it looks  right  to  the 
diagrams if so PLUG-IN and away you go !!!!


  NOTE
 ------

  DUNGEON MASTER and 3D BASEBALL   Both   use a DSP 2 chip ...

  MARIO KART / PILOT WINGS / AIR DIVER    use a DSP 1 chip ...
