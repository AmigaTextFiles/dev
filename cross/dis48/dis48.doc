Introduction

This is a simple disassembler for the Intel 8048 processor, which is
used in the Videopac game computer of 1978. It was not written by myself,
just imported to the Amiga. Originally, dis48 is a part of the O2EM
distribution, so to give credit where it is due, here are the authors'
copyrights etc:

O2EM Freeware Odyssey2 / Videopac+ Emulator
Created by Daniel Boris <dboris@comcast.net>  (c) 1997,1998
Developed by Andre de la Rocha <adlroc@users.sourceforge.net>

The entire O2EM source code including dis48 is available for download at
"http://o2em.sourceforge.net". I took the dis48 source code from v1.01
I think, and wanted to release it on the Amiga. I also improved it a bit.

Changes

This is a list of all of the changes I did to the program:

- added a standard Amiga-style command line interface
- made it give a little bit of information
- changed the maximum filesize from 8 kilobytes to 24
- added the option to print opcodes

Operation

Format:                    dis48 <File> [ADDRESS=n] [OPCODES]

Template:                  FILE/A,ADDRESS/K/N,OPCODES/S

Purpose:                   To disassemble a 8048 binary file.

Specification:

Pass dis48 the name of your 8048 binary file and see it disassembled on
the screen. Normally, you will only see the address and instruction, but
invoking the OPCODES option, that was added by me, you will also get
the bytes in hex.

As dis48 was used to disassemble Videopac ROM images, it had a maximum
file size of 8192 bytes, which is the maximum ROM size for this computer.
In case, should you have a 8048 binary of other type, I increased the
maximum size to 24576 bytes.

For this same reason, dis48 will assume that the code starts at $400,
which is where a ROM cartridge is mapped on a Videopac. I also added
the ADDRESS keyword for you to pass in a starting address other than
that. Without it, the starting address defaults to $400.

Output redirection is supported, a <CTRL>-C break is checked for after
every instruction and pattern matching is not done. If you want to get
in touch with me, write to "contact@timelore.fi". For example, the Amiga
version of the source code is available on request.

I dropped the original code inside a frame of Amiga-style base that
instantaneously allowed me to make it an Amiga-style program. I also
rewrote the main() function to use dos.library instead of ANSI C
file handling.

Finally, when distributing the program, keep this documentation with it.
