HELLO FELLOW AMIGANS

THE INCLUDED ASSEMBLERS - 6801,6804,6805,6809, and 68HC11 SHOULD RUN ON

YOUR AMIGA, WITH NO MODIFICATION, FROM CLI. THEY WERE PORTED FROM THE

MS-DOS VERSIONS FOUND ON THIS BOARD, BEING COMPILED WITH VERSION 4.02

LATTICE 'C' COMPILER.

I HAVE USED THE 6805 ASSEMBLER QUITE A BIT WITH NO PROBLEMS. THE OTHERS

HAVE BEEN TESTED ON VERY SHORT FILES, AND WHILE THEY ALL WORKED, SINCE

I HAVE NOT TESTED THEM EXTENSIVELY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO RUN A WELL KNOWN

SOURCE FILE ON THEM AND COMPARE THE RESULTANT S19 FILES JUST TO BE SURE.

IF ANY PROBLEMS REAR THEIR UGLY HEADS PLEASE LEAVE A NOTE TO THE SYS-OP.

I WILL CHECK BACK FROM TIME TO TIME TO SEE IF ALL IS WELL.

MOTOROLAS' DOC FILE IS IN THIS DIRECTORY, BUT TO GIVE A QUICK EXAMPLE

THE FOLLOWING COMMAND LINE WILL INVOKE THE 6805 ASSEMBLER USING FILE.TST

AS THE SOURCE FILE, REDIRECT SCREEN OUTPUT TO FILE TST.LST AND GENERATE

A LISTING, SYMBOL TABLE, CROSS REFERENCE TABLE, AND ADD CYCLE COUNTS TO

THE LISTING:

(FROM CLI)   AS5 > TST.LST FILE.TST -L S C CRE


 IF YOU OPERATE IN RAM: IT ALL GOES PRETTY FAST, SO DO IT!


                                                T.GROVER   10/21/88

P.S. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ASM.DOC IS THE ORIGINAL MOTOROLA DOC AND

SAYS THAT THE ASSEMBLER EXECUTABLES HAVE A .EXE EXTENSION. THIS IS

ONLY FOR THE MS-DOS CRAP. THE AMIGA ASSEMBLERS HAVE NO EXTENSIONS,

AND ARE NAMED AS1,AS4,AS5,AS9,AND AS11.
