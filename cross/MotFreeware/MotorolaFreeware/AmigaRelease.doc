                               RELEASE NOTES
                    MOTOROLA FREE WARE CROSS ASSEMBLERS
                                ver TER_2.0

o These assemblers are based upon and compatible with the original Motorola
free ware cross assemblers.

o The following archive files contain:

o Apology

The author is not engaged as a software engineer on a full time basis
(system engineer).  Some features may need enhancement and the assemblers
could still need further testing although original code having to do with
the micro-processors themselves was not altered and so should be "as good
as new."  I used AS11 ver TER_2.09 to assemble about 8k bytes of existing
code after modifying it to use most of the new features with no problems.
I also modified the 68HC11 floating point code on the Motorola BBS to work
with the other uC/uPs, assembled them and checked the listing against the
Motorola 8 bit documentation (OK).  Much new code was tested as a finite
state machine.  Comments may be forwarded through Motorola or directly to
my home address (with SASE if reply is requested).  Please do not call my
business telephone.  These assemblers were completed at home without my
employer's equipment or time so that they would be the property of
Motorola.

My interest in the assemblers themselves is the study of software,
operating systems and software development systems.  I also make use of
Motorola 68HC11s as embedded processors in my work.  This project was
completed because I had never coded anything in "C" and I wanted to know
the language well.  I remain interested in this project for itself and will
further upgrade them as time is available.  If others are interested on
this same basis, we might cooperate.  A full linking macro assembler with
local variables seems like the next logical step.  My goal is to develop
the source code so that it is transportable, adding most system specific
controls as drivers or shells (viz the Amiga/UNIX scripts in this release)
and to keep the memory requirements within the bounds of MS-DOS.

Compilers used are Amiga Lattice C and MicroSoft MS-DOS Quick C.  The MS-
DOS version has not been tested with maximum number of symbols.  The Quick
C options were for size and speed.  This means that other things may
suffer, like data size, but I'm not sure.  At the very least, there is
likely to be a drastic reduction in speed using Intel processors and MS-DOS
beyond a critical number of symbols.  The MAC and Amiga 68000, 68020 and
68030 systems do not have these problems.  No options were used to compile
the Amiga version.  An Amiga 2500 using AS11, ~120k of source code in 10
files and an 8k byte output takes about 50 seconds to complete assembly.
These assemblers are about 10% slower than the originals on large files.

Documentation without extension .doc are in Electronic Arts Interchange
File Format (Amiga Standard) and should be readable by most if not all MAC
and Amiga word processors.  There is no MS-DOS word processor documentation
because there are no standards to use.  Some example files may have shorter
names than mentioned in documentation so as to permit handling by (ugh) MS-
DOS and MS-DOS compatible archive programs.

o Files

Files ending in .info are Amiga only.  There are separate MS-DOS and Amiga
.arc files because the EOL symbol is different on each system (and the
assemblers are different).  System specific files such as Trashcan are on
disk distribution only (not available through Motorola).  Add the extension
s shown below to make icons visible i.e. rename NewMan.doc.i
NewMan.doc.info (MS-DOS again, ugh!).  Some source code .info files did not
make the archive at all because of length.  This will make no difference in
editing or compiling.  Copy other info files over e.g. copy AS11.C.info to
TABLE11.H.info to make TABLE11.H visible at Amiga WorkBench.
