******* CONTENTS *******

	This package contains five files:
X320: The TMS32010 cross assembler program
X320.c: it's source file
L320: The linker from my own object code to Intel's hex format
L320.c: it's source file
readme: this readme file

******* DISCLAIMER *******

	The two programs contained in this package had been tested and
they probed to be reliable. However, I can not (and I will not) be
responsible for any damage resulting of their use. It's your own risk and
responsability.

******* HISTORY *******

	I refused to start new projects using the TMS32010 DSP because of
the lack of a cross assembler, not even running on stupid PCs.
	Then, I decided to write my own.

*******  COPYRIGHT *******

	This is an unregistered work, it's shareware, and what I try to
mean is "should you like it, use it; if you find it useful, send a $10
donation to my address. Please keep all files together and do not change
the copyright.

******* DESCRIPTION *******

	The assembler program performs two passes, one to fetch all labels
and AORG directives and the second to assemble the code. I preferred to
treat each kind of instruction separately because it's easier to debug and
to adapt it to assemble different processors in the future.
	You have two assembly options: "x" that generates a simple cross
reference listing on the standard output, and "L" that calls the linker to
obtain the code in a single instruction.
	The object code is a simple address-instruction format in ASCII,
and it makes easy for the linker to obtain the Intel hex format which you
can then send to a programmer.
	The assembler takes an input file and generates other with the
name you gave or the same name as the input file plus the ".obj"
extension.
	The linker takes a ".obj" file as it's input (note that you don't
need to add ".obj" to the name when calling the linker, but you can if you
wish) and generates two files with the name you gave or the same name as
the input file (without the ".obj" extension) plus the ".low" and ".high"
extensions for the low and high order bytes respectively.
	Both programs are CLI only.

******* FUTURE ********

	I am planing to convert this programs to handle all current 8 bit
microprocessors and microcontrollers, so Amiga users will not need to use
boring PCs.

******* BUGS *******

	The assembler supports Texas notation for hexadecimal numbers
(>1234) as well as C notation (0x1234 for hexa,01234 for octal, 1234 for
decimal), so be careful when writing numbers as a leading zero means
octal.
	The DATA directive suppports multiple operands, so you don't need
to write many DATAS. Operands are currently only labels or positive
numbers.
	The label "$" means actual PC, and there are no restricted words,
so the label ADD is valid.
	The only syntactic constrain is that the assembler decides that if
the first character of a line is a blank (tab or space), then the first
valid word is a mnemonic; otherwise, the first word is a label.
	I have modified a part of the standard syntax, that is, you can't
use the "*" to signal comments. You use ";" instead. This is because "*"
is also used to mark indirect addressing and it complicates the string
handling so I decided to alter the syntax, since I'm not a programmer and
this joke was growing so faster...

course donations to the following address:
