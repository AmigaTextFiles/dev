WildSend V1.xxx [dx] (C)1994 AMR

History

All previous Versions never trashed any other memory than that of my Amigas

Version V1.13a (first ever released Version)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A minor Bug was fixed in the HiRom detection Routine. If the Game was
a SWC/FIG dual HiRom it didn't worked at all. -fixed

I added an external Manufacturer List so you can add unknown Manufacturers
by simple editing this list. A sample List is included.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.15 dx
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous Versions did not work with the new SWC DX, but this one does.
added an Option to send Games in Realtime-Save Mode (see Switches)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.16 dx - never released
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.17 dx
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added support for send/save (only on SWCdx)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.18 dx
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- OOPS ! V 1.17 dx passed some info to the console that were only for my pleasure
- fixed ugly info-display
- OOPS, again: I forgot to insert the external Manufacturer List to the Archive.
- Added Option ONLYINFO/S :This overrides all other switches and will only
  Display the Games Information.
- Code size reduced

Version Counter Changed!!
Version now 1.181 (dx, of course)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each new Revision will increase the Revision Counter by one, so the next revision
will be 1.182 but its not sure that that is the next published Revision.
- Only some internals Changed and compiled with E V3.1a

Version 1.182 (03 Feb 1995) (never released)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XPK-Support added. You are now able to pack SINGLE-PARTED!! Files via any
XPK-Packer Library (Mash works great for me).
The XPK-Support only works for Sending. The ONLYINFO/S etc... wont work on
XPK-Packed Files.

Version 1.183 (04 Feb 1995)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XPK-Support now uses xfd Package ©Georg Hörmann
xfddecrunch must be in your path.

Version 1.184 - 1.187 (?? Feb 1995) (never released)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.188 (14 Feb 1995)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-XPK-Support still not working 100% ( but 99% :-) )
-Somtimes the Copier wont Start even if send was OK, i hope i fixed it in this
 version.

Version 1.189 (?? Feb 1995) (never released)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.190 (26 Feb 1995)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- optimized send routine a little bit
- added new manufacturers (94) and updated the external list.
- added intro finder to info window (startpos)
- LZX support added (you need LZX in your path)
  LZX is a great new archiver written by Jonathan Forbes of DCT
- now waits for swc instead of leaving if swc is busy (can be interrupted with
  Ctrl-C
- ASK/S switch added. Use in combination with DEL/S and see what happens.

Version 1.198 (29 Mai 1995)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- CHECKSWC/S removed
- W=WINDOW/S added (will output Gauge + Info (if I=INFO/S) in window)

Version 1.200 (27 Juni 1995)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- XPK-Support removed (I think it was never really used.)
- ONLYINFO/S in combination with WINDOW/S now works.
- External List removed. (WildSend knows ca. 98% of all manufacturers up to now)
- optimized the whole code a little.

Ok and now the Docs
===================
If you don't own a Super Nintendo or a Super Famicom then delete this Archiv.

If you own one of the above and a Super Profighter Q then pray and hope that
this nice tool will work with your System.

If you are a lucky owner of the Super Wild Card then this tool is the right
choice to send your Games to your SNES.

IF your Copiers Name ends with DX then this is the only choice for you.

As you have already guessed this is a File transfer Utility for the SNES+SWC.

Ok, ok, there are several tools flying around that already do this job, but
I found none that was able to send SFII Turbo oneparted or other 20-32 MBit
Files correctly. So I decided to write this one. It is able to send 20-32 MBit
Files (I wasn't able to test bigger ones, but I think they work, too),
it also sends HiROM Games correctly and it tries to Start even Profighter
HiROMS on your SWC. So you don't have to use these fucking ProQ->SWC fixes as
long as you use this Transfer Software. There are several switches built in,
and I will no describe them in a very short way, because they are so easy to
understand.

NOTE: Profighter Hirom support removed due to changes in the Send-Routine
      but Profighter Games will run on SWC-DX anyway.
      (I will add this in a future release.)

Usually you will enter WILDSEND followed by the file you want to send.

The switches WILDSEND knows about are CHECKSWC, INFO, NOALLOC, DESTDIR, DEL, REALTIME

INFO/S     tells you if it is a HiROM Game and gives some Infos about the
           Manufacturer and release Country and Moduletype. Simply try it out
           and you'll see.
           (To use the external Manufacturer List, put it in your s: drawer)

NOALLOC/S  I added this feature for the reason that another tool already
           allocated the Parallelport and you don't want to stop it while
           sending a file. Usually WildSend allocates the Parallelport
           correctly via AllocMiscResource()/FreeMiscResource().

The next options are only for LHA-Support

DESTDIR/K  If you try to send files out of an LH-Archive you can use this
           switch to specify the Destination Directory.

DEL/S      If the files are extracted and sent they will be deleted so your
           Destination path will not run out of space.

REALTIME/S If this switch is used the game will be started in Realtime Save
           Mode. This only works on the new Super WildCard-DX.
           If you use this on a normal SWC or a Profighter your Copier might
           crash.
           On a DX System you can also Send+Save Files with this Option.
           This is how it works:
           1) Send the Game
           2) Press the X-Button
           3) Go to the Wild Card Options menu
           4) Select Program transfer/to Disk/...

ONLYINFO/S This one will Display the Games Info. It will override all other
           switches, so if you use it with other switches they are ignored.
           except the WINDOW switch wich will redirect the Info to a window
           on the active screen.

W=WINDOW/S This switch is used to open a gauge window and (if I=INFO/S is used)
           an info window on the active screen. This is useful for Directory Opus
           or other DirTools, because no Shell Window is needed for the output.

ReqTools:
---------
If you simply call WildSend with no argument it opens a reqtools requester to
select a File, so you need the reqtools.library in your libs: drawer.

Ok, that is all to be said about WildSend.
Have fun with it
