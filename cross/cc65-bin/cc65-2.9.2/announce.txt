I'm proud to announce cc65 version 2.9.2. cc65 is a complete cross
development package for 65(C)02 systems, including a powerful macro
assembler, a C compiler, linker, librarian and several other tools.

cc65 has C and runtime library support for many of the old 6502 machines,
including

  - The Commodore VIC20 (contributed by Steve Schmidtke
    <steve_schmidtke@hotmail.com>).

  - The Commodore C64 and C128.

  - The Commodore C16, C116 and Plus/4.

  - The CBM 510 (aka P500), a quite rare Commodore machine (programs
    run in bank 0).

  - The CBM 600/700 family (programs run in bank 1).

  - Newer PET machines (not 2001)

  - The Apple ][ (library support by Kevin Ruland <kevin@rodin.wustl.edu>)

  - The Atari 8 bit machines (thanks to the Atari team: Christian Groessler
    <cpg@aladdin.de>, Mark Keates <markk@dendrite.co.uk>, Freddy Offenga
    <taf_offenga@yahoo.com> and David Lloyd, <dmlloyd@atari-central.com>).

  - GEOS for the C64 and C128 (by Maciej Witkowiak <ytm@elysium.pl>)

  - The Oric Atmos (this one is BETA!).

The libraries are fairly portable, so creating a version for other 6502s
shouldn't be too much work.

This is a maintenance release that contains bug fixes for version 2.9.1 (see
http://www.cc65.org/bugs.php for a list), but no additional features.

Special care has been taken to make sure that this release works flawlessly
together with Contiki, Adam Dunkels internet enabled operating system and
desktop environment (http://dunkels.com/adam/contiki/). Thanks a lot, Adam!

Available packages:

As usual I will provide the complete sources and several binary packages,
including RPMs for RedHat Linux. Linux is the primary development
platform, so the sources do compile out of the box on Linux machines.

Please note that there are separate RPMs for the compiler proper and the
target specific libraries. To develop for one of the predefined target
systems you need the compiler RPM package *and* one of the target machine
packages.

Binaries for DOS and and Windows will follow or may already be available
at the time you read this. OS/2 packages will again be available, but
since there are almost no downloads for OS/2, so the host platform may
get dropped in the near future (again). As with the RPM packages, you
need the package for the development system (Windows, etc.) *and* one or
more of the target machine packages.

Thanks to all who sent feedback and suggestions, and of course to anyone who
helped developing cc65!
