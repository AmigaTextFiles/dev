Atmel cross assembler and programmer.
=====================================

This archive contains a cross assembler and programmer for the Atmel
AT90S range of microcontrollers.

The Atmel AT90S range of microcontrollers are all Flash based devices
and are available with various configurations of ram/flash/io pins and other
stuff you would usually find on a microcontroller.
They are comparable to PIC devices but in my opinion are far superior.

Some salesman came round to have a natter at work trying to convince me
that this new range of flash PIC's were brillient.  I wasn't impressed and
told him I had been doing that for ages with the Atmel and H8 microcontrollers.
He left.

Have a look at Atmels web page for device information. (Can't remember the
address, shouldn't be hard to find.)

I have included the source code for both bits of software, written in C.
