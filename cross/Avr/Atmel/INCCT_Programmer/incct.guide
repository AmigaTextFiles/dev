Atmel AT90S In circuit programmer V1.00

This software allows the Atmel AT90S range of microcontrollers to be
programmed using the serial programming protocol.  Other Atmel devices using
this same method of programming are probably programmable with this software.

@endnode

@node Req

You will need.
--------------

The INCCT software.
A programming lead (See below)
The required program code to be transferred to the flash device.

Programming cable.
------------------

The programming cable connects to the parallel port.  This is then wired
directly to the appropriate pins on the Atmel device.
The use of some series wired resistors is advised!

   25 Pin                               Device Pin
   Parallel port.                       (Example AT90S4414)
      2                -  1K  - >       Data in  (MOSI) (Pin 6)
      11               - 470R - >       Data out (MISO) (Pin 7)
      3                -  1K  - >       Clock in (SCK)  (Pin 8)
      4                -  1K  - >       Reset    (RST)  (Pin 9)
      25               -  -   - >       0 Volts  (GND)  (Pin 20)

The use of shielded cable is advised.  Connect the shield to pin 25 of the
25 pin parallel port connector.  Leave the shield unconnected at the other
end.

@node Use
Software operation.
-------------------

The software is started from the command line with :

INCCT <Filename> [Option]

Where <Filename> is the file to operate on.
[Option] is one of :
-r    Reads the entire device flash and stores it in <Filename>.
-l    Locks the flash.

No [Option] will program the device with the contents of <Filename>.

The device you are programming must be powered up and running with a good
clock signal (Xtal connected).

 OR

Double clicking the icon or supplying no command options will start the GUI.

@endnode

@node File

Motorola S Record.
------------------

The input <Filename> to the software must be a valid Motorola S19 Record.

@endnode

@node Bugs
The reading and writing of onboard EEPROM is not supported yet.

Version 1.0 : First release, Didn't work! Doh!
              Will work for small code <256 bytes.

Version 1.1 : All known bugs fixed, will now do a full chip ;)
