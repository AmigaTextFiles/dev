NOTE:   Serial programming
        ------------------

        Serial way works as documented in Databook.
        Transfer of data is only on pins RB6, RB7
        and *MCLR.

        So connect HW to computer and use only these
        pins from programmer.


        For parallel way you must connect all wires
        as showed on scheme.
