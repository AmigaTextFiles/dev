NOTE: This doc was written in one night, when I decided to get this very, very
      incoplete prog. to you and say ..now you're beta tester..

                    .. so use at your own risk !!

    All tips & suggestions are welcomed so don't be lazy and write crazy !

    PIC Developer's kit v 0.9 beta.
    ===============================

    Please, don't think that this document is manual for PIC microcontrollers.
NO !! This isn't DataBook and never'll be. So more infos about PIC controllers
are in official Microchip materials and especially in [1].

    What it's ?
    ===========

    This package include PIC 16C5x, PIC 16C84 cross assembler and PIC 16C84
programmer. To allow program those stuffs you'll need a piece of HW too. So
little pretty piccy of very basic programmer is included. This version'll works
with this programmer but all newer versions that'll able to program PIC 16C5x, PIC
16C7x and other will need a bit special programmer. Still low cost, but more
expandable (like EPROM 2716..27256 etc.). This is done for you that you can
develop and debug software for 16C84 which has ( as one) 1Kb of EEPROM. And in
this case is suitable for developing. In fact I got to you quite powerful tool
for development in price of ICs you need to construct the programmer.

    All never versions will be shareware that'll not be compatible with this
one ( programmer). But maybe I'll release newer value version for 16C84 (like
this) again.

NOTE:   All future developing is in your hands. Please, if you are interested in
        this project, give me a sign that'll give me power to do more for Amiga.

        Amiga isn't only TOY, so take a care for her Jobs !! :-)



    Instalation:
    ============

    Copy all file is one directory ( for example  DH1:Apps/PIC_Kit) and add assign
"Assign >NIL: PIC: DH1:Apps/PIC_Kit". This assign is necesary only if you want to use
arexx macro for GoldED.

An arexx macro is added for using this kit with GoldED, so if you want to use
it, you have to install this in your GoldED. Simply by adding this into the menu
strip as an arexx script.




    assembler v0.9ß
    ===============

    Usage:
    ------

      picasm [opts] <source_file.p84>

      options:

        -d debug option, all actions are listed so you can easy recognize what's
           wrong

    Features:
    ---------

      - 16c5x, 16c84 code support ( type is selected by added suffix .p84 .p54 .p55
        .p56 .p57 etc.)

      - generated code is in INHX16 standard

      - implemented

        %10101x10       binary format

        b'11111x00'     binary format

        F8h or 0x0F8    hexadecimal

        248             decimal

        034             sorry it's implemented but i never used this and my
                        calcy is far away so try it... :)

        EQU             constant definition

        ORG             sets actual PC value

        ;               comments

        LIST            more info during assembling

        NOLIST          no more info during assembling

        include         include files

      - non implemented (soon'll be)


        #define         c style constant definitions

        END             for PC's cross assembler compatibility

        macro           for you personal enjoy

        INHX8 (merged)  needed for Microchip third party programmers (do you
                        have this one ?? :) )

        INHX8 (split)                -- // --

        some errors aren't recognized properly and are prompted as unexpected or
        syntax errors



    If you think that there is missing something you can live without please let
    me know and I will do maximum to satisfy you.



    Programmer v0.9ß
    ================

    implemented:

      - HEX16 code support

      - full PIC 16c84 support

      - both serial and parallel programming mode

    non implemented

      - PIC 16C5x support

        This is only limited in this version (anyway - available)

      - INHX8 (merged, split)

        don't cry will be soon as possible (tommorow's late)

    If you think that there is missing something you can live without please let
    me know and I will do maximum to satisfy you.

    Short info about gadgets:

    "INFO" area
    -----------

      INFO gadet  - i think there's nothing special

    "Actions" area
    --------------

      Action "Program" - Allows you to select specific operations like program,
                        read, removing code protection etc.. See [1].

      Action "Type select" - Now you can select 16c84 or 16c5x, but 16c84 only
                            works.

      Action "Oscilator type" - LP, HS, XT, RC type. See [1].


    "CFG Word" area:
    ----------------

      Ext - If selected external configuration word is used from a HEX file.

      PW - PWRTE Power On Reset Timer Enabled see [1].

      WD - WDTE Watch Dog Timer Enabled see[1].

      CP0, CP1 - Code protection flags for future compatibility with P16C7x
               is PC1 flag added too, anyway see[1].


    "Prog area" area
    ----------------

      PM - When program action is selected, this gadget determines if program
           memory'll be programed.

      EM - If type = p16c84 this gadget determines if Data EEPROM will be
           programmed.


    "ID" area:
    ----------

      Here you can enter 4 hexadecimal numbers that are ID nubers for your
      products. In fact you can program eight bits, but when code protection is
      selected and upper 4 bits are not set to zero you can't read this number
      corectly, so in this programmer you can enter only lower 4 bits of each 4
      bytes that represent hexadecimal number. ID is then readed corectly
      independent on code protection.

    "Method" area
    -------------

      You can select serial or parallel, but remember that RemoveCP, EraseDM,
      ErasePM can be used only when parallel mode is selected.

    "Format" area
    -------------

      Sets current input and output format.
      Now is supported INHX16 ( HEX16) only.

    "GO"
    ----

      Starts selected actions read, program etc.

    "LOAD" & "SAVE" & "EXIT"
