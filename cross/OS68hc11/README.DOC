                              MCX11 NOTES 

The two S-record object files on this diskette, SYSTEM.S19 and TEST.S19,
were created using the AS11 assembler. SYSTEM.S19 is the object file for
the MCX11 kernel, system tables, and clock driver consistent with the needs
of TEST.AS.

The TEST.AS file contains four tasks (tasks 2-5, task 1 is the clock driver)
which are designed to execute all of the functions in MCX11. They do not 
necessarily test all possibilities for each function. It will operate on an
EVM board having as little as 256 bytes of RAM. TEST.AS does not do anything
important so don't expect earthshaking results or outputs.

The command lines used for assembling the files are as follows:

For MCX11 kernel - Object is SYSTEM.S19

     AS11 SYSTEM.AS MCX.AS CLKDRIVR.AS VECTORS.AS -L CRE C > MCX.LST

For TEST program - Object is TEST.S19

     AS11 TEST.AS -L CRE C > TEST.LST

MCX.LST and TEST.LST are the listing files for the two assemblies. Both
listings include the cycle count and produce a cross reference listing. If
either is not desired, the command lines can be changed accordingly.

It would be possible to join all elements into a single assembly and produce
only one object and listing file. 

As a time saver (and paper saver), listing suppression directives could be
inserted into the source code. A most likely candidate would be the code in
the MCX.AS file. Since it is the main part of the kernel, it is unlikely to be
changing as often as the application (TEST.AS) program.

A batch file, ASSEMBLE.BAT, is also included for a quick construction of the
test environment.
