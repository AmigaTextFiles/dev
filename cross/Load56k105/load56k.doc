LOAD56K DOC

1. System requirements:

	Amiga, 1MB , OS3.0 or better, EVM-56k-Board ( conected to serial ).

2. Getting started

	Run from CLI:

	if run from CLI type

		 load56k <lodfilename> <-Ddevice [-Uunit]>

	The option <lodfilename> may be ignored. In this case , a filerequester
	apears.

	Optional the serial device may be change for use with multi-io-cards.
	In this case, the device name, you`ll use and the unit number must be
	given.

	Example:

	load56k test.lod -Dduart.device -U1


	Run from WB :

	If run from WB simply double-click Load56k icon.

		TOOLTYPES

		DEVICE=devicename

		Change serial device to devicename

		UNIT=unitnumber

		Set unitnumber

		LODFILE=lodfilename

		Set a filename for loading


3. How it works

	If a filename is given, Load56k try to reset the board, force DSP to
	enter debug-mode and start file transfer.
	The actual transfer state is shown while loading.
	When transfer is finnished, OK- or GO-botton may clicked.

	GO-Botton set the DSP in runnig state and fore programm execution from
	address 0x0000.

	OK-Botton leaves the DSP in debug-state and exit.

	If an error detected, Load56k will only activate the cancel-botton.
