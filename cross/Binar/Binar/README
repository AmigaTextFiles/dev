By using Binar you can extract source code from machine language programs
created for Apple 8-bit computers, Atari 8-bit computers, and Commodore 
8-bit computers.

Binar is a non-symbolic disassembler for 65xx/75xx/85xx processors. It is
capable of disassembling and recognising all the 256 opcodes of
65xx/75xx/85xx processors, including undocumented ones.

In addition to extracting source codes, it can provide extra information
about machine language programs which is difficult to get otherwise, such
information as the number of code lines and number of subroutine calls.

Disassembled code can be viewed in a shell window or saved in an ASCII 
file to be archived, annotated, and/or further analysed.

By default, Binar disassembles in Commodore's TEDMON Monitor format but
output can be modified to meet your needs better.

If you do not like using command arguments, an alternative easy interactive
usage is provided through BinarGUI GUI-front-end. With the BinarGUI you
can view the source code by just a few mouse clicks.

Binar is a freeware [AMITY] product.
