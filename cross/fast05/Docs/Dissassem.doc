		FAST05 Disassembler


Dis05 is a disassembler for the MC68HC05 series Microcontrollers.
The tool runs from the CLI and takes the form.

 Dis05 <binary file> [control script]

Dis05 outputs a assembler file of the same name but with a ".asm"
extension.

An optional control script can be used to control the disassembly
process. You can set start & end points within the binary file
and also declare data sections to avoid the generation of
garbage. The control script has four commands

o <hex addr>             set origin
e <hex addr>             set end
l                        add a memory listing to the comment field
d <hex addr> <hex addr>  declare a data section

The command character must be the first chr on the line.
No comments are allowed.
You can declare as many data sections as you like.

for example

o 0100
e 01FF
l
d 0114 01FF

this script
.starts disassembly $0100 (256) bytes from the begining of the
 binary file
.ends disassembly at byte $01FF (511).
.A comment will be added to each line of output listing the address 
 of the line
.binary data from loc $0144 to loc $01FF will be disassembled into
 data tables. binary data from loc $0100 to loc $0113 will be
 disassembled into code.

All output can be reassembled as is on the Asm05 assembler. When
disassembling rom image files (from Asm05) you will need a control
script to avoid disassembling large sections of unused rom.
