To use the fast dev system you will need to
  1) call up a shell window
  2) make the tools (in the tools directory) available in your path

I do this using the files in this directory.

I use the Tool Icon (Fast.info) to run a script (Fast) which opens
a shell window.

The shell window starts up by first running the script OpenFast

OpenFast copies all the developemts tools to RAM: and makes AmigaDos
JOIN resident.

Confusing eh.

But.

It means you don't have to assign anything in your startup sequence
and the tools run a bit quicker. And you have an icon you can drag
around the place to call up the system at any time.

You will have to edit both Fast and OpenFast to set up the right
directory paths. You can then drag & drop the fast icon into any
directory you like (I leave it out on workbench when I am doing a
lot of developemt work). To Call up the fast system just double
click on this icon.

If you use the cli a bit you probably have you own shell startup
stuff so you will have to modify OpenFast acordingly.
