@NODE "Hardware description"

@{B}    Hardware description @{UB}

The Hardware is rather complex because of the standalone function
and the production grade powersupply but anyone who has worked with
pic's before should be able to build it.

The PIC16C84 forms the heart of the circuit, it holds the programming
algorhitm, I2C routines and the RS-232 routines.

The MAX232/ICL232 translates the Amiga's serial port logic levels (+/-12V)
to the standard logic levels of 0 and +5V as used by the PIC16C84.

The 24C16 is an 2K*8 serial EEPROM which is connected to the PIC16C84
through an I2C-bus.
It is used to store the ProgramFile for the PIC12C508.

The 74LS145 together with an LM317T and a BC547B forms the programmable VDD 
powersupply for the PIC12C508.
The 74LS145 is a bcd to decimal decoder with 15V open collector outputs
(you MUST use this type, no ls45, ls445 or HC/HCT types !).
It can select four voltages: 0V (off) ,VddMIN(typ. 3V), VddP( 5V) and
VddMAX (typ. 5.5V).
The circuitry connected to pin RA4 is used to switch VPP
(Programming voltage) on and off.
The circuitry connected to pin RB7,RB6,RB5 is used for the serial
communications with the PIC12C508.

The opamp CA3130 is necassery to interface to the PIC16C84 because of the 
programmable VDD, I'm sorry I couldn't find a cheaper replacement for this,
I tried several other opamps, but this was the only one which worked
properly.

Only two parts remain, the 7805 which is used to provide a fixed +5V
powersupply and the LM317T, which is used to provide +13.25V for the
VPP(programming voltage).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Building the Hardware"

@{B}    Building the Hardware @{UB}

Building is straightforward, all needed info is included in this archive.
The power needed is about 16-17volts at a current of 100mA 
(I have not tested the current consumption so this is just a guess), you
can always use a non-regulated AC plug adapter at 12V beacause these
usually deliver a much higher voltage.
The maximum input voltage is about 30 Volts.

@{"Power Schematic" LINK "Power.pic/MAIN"}

A couple of things need attention when building:
-Use a socket for at least the PIC16C84 for easy upgradeability
 and easy adjustment of the power supply.
-The power regulators don't need a heatsink, the 7805 can become
 warm but not hot.
-Use ceramic multilayer or sibatit types if posible for the 100nF decoupling
 capacitors.
-If you can get hold of a ICL232, it is to be preferred above a MAX232
 (MAX232's can be very picky about their powersupply's!).
-Last note: most IC's used are CMOS types, so take ESD precautions !
-connections of the pic12c508:

 VPP : programming voltage
 VSS : ground
 VDD : power supply

@{"Programmer Schematic" LINK "Programmer.pic/MAIN"}

@{"Connections Schematic" LINK "Connections.pic/MAIN"}

-I have not designed nor tested this programmer as an in-system programmer,
 so use a zif socket or something like that

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Adjusting the voltages"

@{B}    Adjusting the voltages. @{UB}

Adjusting the VPP is fairly straightforward, just place a multimeter
at the output of the LM317T and adjust it with the trimmer to +13.25V

The VDD supply is a little bit more complicated.

Adjusting the programmable Vdd supply Step 1:
Switch on power without the PIC16C84 inserted.
The 74LS145 will now output a 'low' on the Q3_NOT output because
a TTL-input goes to a logic one when left open.
Now adjust the output of the LM317T (associated with the VDD supply)
to VddMAX with the 500Ohms trimmer connected to Q3_NOT.(typ. 5.5V)

Step2:
Connect a wire between input A of the 74LS145 and ground.
The selected input code is 10 which is Q2_NOT.
Adjust the output of the LM317T (associated with the VDD supply)
to VddP with the 500Ohms trimmer connected to Q2_NOT.(5.0V)

Step3:
Connect a wire between input B of the 74LS145 and ground.
The selected input code is 01 which is Q1_NOT.
Adjust the output of the LM317T (associated with the VDD supply)
to VddMIN with the 250Ohms trimmer connected to Q1_NOT.(typ. 3.0V)

After these adjustments have been made, switch of power (!) and insert
all other IC'S.
Be sure to program the PIC16C84 before inserting!

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Operating the Programmer"

@{B}    Operating the Programmer @{UB}

Included in this archive is a utility called "Control12".
It's a small cli (GUI is on the way) program used to download .hex files
to the programmer.
It is also used to perform a blank check (To see if a PIC is empty) and
to program a pic online.

Downloading:
Select d. The program will ask for a .hex file.
After loading the hex file the program will ask you the settings of
the config register.
You must select:
-Codeprotection on/off.
-MCLR pin enable/disable.
-Watchdogtimer on/off.
-Oscillator type.
After typing 'y' to confirm, the program will download the .hex file
and the configuration to the programmer. (Be sure it is swtiched on
and online!)
You can always abort by ctrl_c.
If the program reports "contact made" everything is going well.
Downloading is rather slow at the moment because of the 1200baud
connection and the heavy handshaking, but it is reliable, so please be
patient when downloading.
The status LED will light up green while downloading.

Blank Test:
Select 'b', the status LED will light red and the program will report
the result of the test.

Online Programming:
Select 'p', the status LED will light red and the programming begins.

The program will report:
1) Blank Test result.
2) Programming result.
3) VddMIN verify result.
4) VddMAX verify result.
5) Configuration Programming result.

If an error occurs, the status LED will flash red and the program will
report the failure.
If a fatal hardware error occurs, the status led will flash green and
the program will hang.
abort with ctrl_c.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Standalone Programming"

@{B}    Standalone Programming. @{UB}

Because this is a standalone programmer, it can be used indepently from
the Amiga.
When there is a valid .hex file in the programmer's eeprom memory, you
can program a PIC12C508 simply by pressing the start button.
The LED will light red during programming, when it lights green again,
programming was OK, when it flashes red, a programming error occurred.
You can insert and remove PIC's with the programmer switched on, as
long as the LED is green, flashing red or flashing green.
So when the LED is continueosly red, the programmer is accessing the
PIC and you can't remove the PIC.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Status LED explanation"

@{B}    Status LED explanation @{UB}

The status LED indicates the programmer's status
red:         the programmer is accessing the PIC (programming or blank testing).
green:       the last action was succesfull.
flash green: A hardware error occurred (eeprom checksum failed or I2C error)
             you need to reset the programmer in this case.
flash red:   the last action was not succesfull

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Assembler"

@{B}    Assembler @{UB}

You'll be missing one important thing in this archive: the assembler!
That's right, I've not written an assembler for it.
This is because there are already very good PIC assemblers out there.
Any assembler capable of handling PIC16C5x processor's can handle the
PIC12C508 too.
Just set the assembler (by example) to PIC16C54 and tada! the generated
code is directly compatible with the PIC12C508.
The PIC12C508 is based on the PIC16C5x family and therefore has the same
12bit core.
I've included a .inc file with all declarations and settings needed
to use a PIC16C5x assembler for the PIC12C508.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "The Calibration location"

@{B}    The Calibration location @{UB}

As you know the PIC12C508 has a calibration value programmed at location
0x1ff.
The programmer will leave this location untouched, even when you have
used this location in your program.
However, if the programmer can't find a valid movlw 0xXX instruction
(erased by UV light in the windowed version by example), it will program
a movlw 0x00 instruction at location 0x1ff.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "CARDWARE"

@{B}    Disclaimer @{UB}

This package is CARDWARE which means you may use and distribute it
freely, as long as you don't change the archive.
If you like it and use it, I would like it very much to receive a postcard
from you (maybe a nice tourist card ?).

    27 May 1998         V1.0

                        -First release


    28 October 1998     V1.1

                        -Serial Speed improved to 2400 baud

                        -Programming algorithm updated to new specs
                        as described in doc DS30557D from www.microchip.com
                        This wil fix all problems with the infamous
                        "9820" series of MCU's although it seemed that my
                        programmer never had any problems with this series,
                        Some commercial programmers did ......

                        -Error fixed in main schematic
                        -several Errors fixed in readme


    11 Januari 1999     V1.2

                        -improved HEX-loader, the loader can now read any dialect
                         of the infamous INHX8M format.
                         I also added a special version of the downloader which ignores
                         checksums, as some hexfiles work OK but mess around with checksums.

                        -made some timing changes in the firmware so update the firmware too!


    02 December 2001    V1.21

                        -new email adress
                        
                        -stopped development
                        
                        -added sources


@ENDNODE

@NODE "Todo list"

@{B}    Future or todo list @{UB}

-Add a selftest function to simplify adjustment and testing
-Create a MUCH simpler version of the programmer as I got very little
 response to this programmer, presumably due to the complexity of the
 hardware
 I am thinking of a version with only a pic16c84,max232 and some transistors
