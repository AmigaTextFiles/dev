                                   AmiExec
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AmiExec is a real-time, multi-tasking microkernel, the core of which is an
implementation of exec.library.  AmiExec can be used for automation, process
control, or other embedded systems based on 68K family CPUs and
microcontrollers.  Software development for AmiExec can be done on Amigas
with Amiga development tools.

----------------------------- Last Minute Info -------------------------------

rexxdossupport.library is used by some of the ARexx utility scripts. It
can be fetched from the util/rexx directory of Aminet.


------------------------------- Release V3R2 ---------------------------------

exec.library 3.18
-----------------

Additions:

Support for non-zero VBR.

Support for pseudo-VBR scheme for 68000 systems with ROM vector tables.

Added SetExceptVect procedure for VBR aware vector table manipulation.

BootEvent callback.  Specified in the BootTable this callback is invoked at
the beginning of ROMTag scanning, as ROMTags are found, and as ROMTags are
processed.  Useful for debugging a system encountering difficulties very
early in the boot process, before debug.library becomes available.


Changes:

BootTable now passed as a parameter to Exec entry point instead of being at
known offset from entry point.  Increases "re-targetability" of AmiExec.


debug.library 3.11
------------------

Additions:

One shot breakpoint command.

Trace command.

Tag stepping.  If specified in the BootTable (TagStep == TRUE) the system is
paused at each BootMsg as the resident modules initialize.  Hitting CTRL-C
enters debug for system inspection, hitting RETURN contines booting with no
more pausing, any other key steps to the next BootMsg.


cpu.resource
------------

Additions:

New documents - cpu.resource.guide, cpu.resource.ag, and cpu.resource.ad.


Tools
-----

Changed:

MemTag - Removed MUI interface.  There was a bug, it was the only MUI client
in the distribution, and I find it just as easy to simply edit the tool-types
anyway.

Sysgen.rexx - Command line arguments have changed.  Easier support of
different ROM monitors on the target system.
