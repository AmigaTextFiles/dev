I don't feel like writing much so if you can't figure it out just email me at

I think hex-bin is public domain.  There were no notices of any kind with it

string85 and makeasm are Copyright ©1997 Shawn D'Alimonte and are freeware
That means you may use them free of charge.  Please don't charge more than
the cost of media for copying.  If modify them please give me credit and 
clearly indicate what you have changed.

This is my package of programs that will help the ZShell developer using an
Amiga.  They were compiled with GCC so need ixemul.library

hex-bin - Many of the assemblers I have tried give Ihex output which is not
          what I wanted.  I found the source code on the net somewhere and 
          used it to help.  Reads from stdin and writes to stdout
          ie hex-bin <junk.hex >junk.o

string85- My verison of string85.  Does not insert required ID bytes so they
          must appear in assembly file.  Typically your starting would look
          like:
	      	incl	"ti-85.h"	;modified to suit assembler

		db 0	;ZShell needs these two
		db $fd
		org 0	;This has to go here
		db ,DESC_LEN	;Length of Descripition
		string "Description"
		db 0

		;Program starts here

	Usage is:
	string85 file.o varname

makeasm - A batch file to call asz80, hex-bin and string85 all at once
	  variable takes the name of the assembly file minus the .asm

For an assembler I use asz80 which comes in a package I found one Aminet called
Frankenstien that contained assemblers for many 8bit microprocessors.

Others I know of that may work are caz and c_z80.  Check the dev/cross dir on
aminet for more stuff.
