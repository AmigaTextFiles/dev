 This program is released under the concept of SHAREWARE.
 The registration fee is 20,-DM. More is welcome :)
 If you want further updates, then REGISTER NOW.

 This is the ONE AND ONLY public beta release.

 The recommended use for this utility is for developing purposes only.
 Backup  units  are cheaper than all other cross-development packages.
 Although  they  don't offer you the same power, they can be perfectly
 used for developing games and other programs.
 Please remember:
 Copying software without permission is a criminal act !

How to register:
 The  easiest  way  is to send the money by mail to my adress.  I will
 then  send you the next version, either by mail or by E-mail.  Please
 state  in your registration which way do you prefer.  Don't forget to
 write  your  adress  in  a readable manner.  If any of the registered
 versions is  released  to  the  public, I will immediatly drop public
 support.

PLEASE NOTE:
 I can't help you getting a backup unit, it was fairly hard to get one
 by myself. Just take a trip to Hong Kong and enjoy life a little bit.

BONUS PROGRAMS:
 SMDC  - converts SMD modules to binary images and vice versa,
         including checksum calculation by converting from BIN to SMD.
 SCalc - calculates the checksum of a SNES file.
         Set checksum to $0000/$FFFF in your own programs. Then use
         SCalc. (Actually this one was just a testprg, don't expect
         too much of it 8)

SPECIAL FEATURES:
 Sending XPK files !!!
 Sending splitted files (Sorry, I'm still stucked with a 880KB floppy)
 Nice behaviour in your multitasking turbo environment.
 Can't think of anything else at the moment :)

FUTURE:
 - bug fixes :)
 - better support of backup unit features
 - better MD support
 - binary support for sending files
 - reading cartridges
 - dumping/editing file information
 - maybe a full powered gui version
 - a debug handler (probably snes only), which you can include in your
   programs, so that you can trace your program.
   (Far future, first I have to finish my MD Music Set)
 - PLUS whatever you want me to do.

All options are rather self-explanatory:
I  hope that the PFQ & PFX/PFQ+ transfer works the right way.  I don't
have  any  of  these,  so I had to assume how they work.  Actually the
only  difference  is  in  sending  highrom  files  and  maybe the sram
mapping. If neither of them work for your machine, then tell me.

OPTIONS: FILE,RB=RBRAM/S,NB=NOBRAM/S,RT=REALTIME/S,
         DPFSN/S,DPFMD/S,PFX/S,PFQ/S,SWC/S,SMD/S,HELP/S,
         NC=NOCHECK/S,GF=FINGER/K/M,PW=PASSWORD/K

where: ----> Main Options <----
       FILE     - file to be sent or received.
       RBRAM    - receive battery ram and save as FILE (SNES only).
       NOBRAM   - disable battery ram (SNES only).
       REALTIME - enable Realtime Save (DPF SNES).
       ----> Transfer Options <----
       DPFSN    - use DPF SNES transfermethod.
       DPFMD    - use DPF Megadrive transfermethod.
       PFX      - use PFX/PFQ+ transfermethod.
       PFQ      - use PFQ transfermethod.
       SWC      - use SWC transfermethod.
       SMD      - use SMD transfermethod.
       ----> Extra Options <----
       NOCHECK  - don't check for valid GOLD FINGER code(s).
       FINGER   - apply GOLD FINGER code(s) to file.
       HELP     - you should know this one by now 8-)
       ----> XPK Options <----
       PASSWORD - password for encrypted XPK files.

Parallel Cable Connection:
--------------------------
The  easiest  way  is  to  buy a PC parallel cable, then cut all pins
except the ones needed.  After that you have to connect former pin 13
on  the  Amiga  side to pin 1 Backup Unit.
If you are not sure how to build this cable and if you want a perfect
read/write cable, you can get an PC->AMIGA CABLE ADAPTER for 30,- DM.
(Which makes a total of 50,-DM when you register !!!)
Please  state in your registration whether you want the adapter to be
plugged  between  Amiga and cable or Backup Unit and cable (length of
adapter is approx. 7 cm).

Standard write only cable:
           Backup Unit COM I/O Port          Amiga Parallel Port
                     1 --------------------------> 13
                     2 -------------------------->  2
                     3 -------------------------->  3
                     4 -------------------------->  4
                     5 -------------------------->  5
                     6 -------------------------->  6
                     7 -------------------------->  7
                     8 -------------------------->  8
                     9 -------------------------->  9
                    11 --------------------------> 11
                    21 --------------------------> 21

An advanced read/write cable can be build by adding some logic to it.
