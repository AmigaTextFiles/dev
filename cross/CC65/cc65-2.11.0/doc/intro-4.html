<P>The linker combines several object and library files into one output file.
<B>ld65</B> is very configurable, but fortunately has a built-in configuration
for the C64, so we don't need to mess with configuration files, here.</P>
<P>The compiler uses small functions to do things that cannot be done inline
without a big impact on code size. Those runtime functions, together with the
C library, are in an object-file archive named after the system, in this case,
"<CODE>c64.lib</CODE>". We have to specify that file on the command line, so that the
linker can resolve those functions.</P>
<P>A second file (this time, an object file) needed is the startup code that
prepares the grounds for the C program to run. The startup file must be
executed first, so it must be the first file on the linker command line.</P>
<P>Let's link our files to get the final executable:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ld65 -t c64 -o hello c64.o hello.o text.o c64.lib
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The argument after <CODE>-o</CODE> specifies the name of the output file, the argument
after <CODE>-t</CODE> gives the target system. As discussed, the startup file must be
the first input file on the command line (you may have to add a path here, if
<CODE>c64.o</CODE> is not in your current directory). Since the library resolves
imports in <CODE>hello.o</CODE> and <CODE>text.o</CODE>, it must be specified <EM>after</EM> those
files.</P>
<P>After a successful linker run, we have a file named "<CODE>hello</CODE>", ready for
our C64!</P>
