<P>Older versions of VICE had several problems with labels. However, even those
versions were still tremendously useful, and all known problems are gone in
current versions. So, here is a list of the problems known to me as of version
0.16.1:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The "<CODE>ll</CODE>" command does not work. Worse, it seems that internal
memory gets corrupted when using this command, so VICE will crash after use.
Use the "<CODE>pb</CODE>" command to load the label file in this case.
</LI>
<LI>VICE will crash if you use a label that is undefined. This is probably
the worst problem of all, since it needs just one typo to kill VICE. So, watch
your steps:-)
</LI>
<LI>Cheap labels, that is, labels starting with '@' or '?' are not accepted.
</LI>
<LI>The disassembly output is somewhat suboptimal. However, most things are
just cosmetical, e.g. labels appended to the right side of the disassembled
code.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><B>Note</B>: All these problems are fixed in current (&gt;= 1.0) VICE
versions. If you're really using such an old version, you should think about
an upgrade.</P>
