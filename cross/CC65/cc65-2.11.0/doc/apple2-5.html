<P><EM>Note:</EM> Since the Apple&nbsp;][ doesn't have working disk I/O
(see 
<A HREF="apple2-6.html#limitations">section &quot;Limitations&quot;</A>), the
available drivers cannot be loaded at runtime (so the term "loadable drivers"
is somewhat misleading). Instead, the drivers have to be converted using the
<A HREF="co65.html">co65 utility</A> and statically linked. While
this may seem overhead, it has two advantages:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The interface is identical to the one used for other platforms
and to the one for the Apple&nbsp;][ once it has disk I/O.</LI>
<LI>Once disk I/O is available, existing code can be changed to load drivers
at runtime with almost no effort.</LI>
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="apple2.html#toc5.1">Graphics drivers</A>
</H2>


<P><EM>Note:</EM> Since memory for the high resolution graphics has to be allocated,
programs using graphics drivers will have to be linked using a special linker
configuration. See the <CODE>apple2-tgi.cfg</CODE> file in the documentation
directory, and the 
<A HREF="ld65.html">linker documentation</A> on
how to use it.</P>
