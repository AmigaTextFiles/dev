<P>VICE is an emulator for many of the CBM machines. It runs on Unix, DOS and
Windows 95. It emulates the Commodore 64, 128, VIC20, PET and the 600/700
machines. For more information see the VICE home page:</P>

<P>VICE has a builtin machine language monitor that may be used for debugging
your programs. Using an emulator for debugging has some advantages:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Since you're using a crossassembler/-compiler anyway, you don't need to
transfer the program to the real machine until it is done.
</LI>
<LI>An emulator allows many things that are almost impossible one of the
original machines. You may set watchpoints (detect read or write access to
arbitary addresses), debug interrupt handlers and even debug routines that run
inside the 1541 floppy.
</LI>
<LI>You may use the label file generated by the linker to make much more use
from the monitor.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Please note that you need at least VICE version 0.16 for the label file
feature to work. This version has still some problems (see 
<A HREF="debugging-5.html#problems">Problems and workarounds</A>), but older versions had even more problems
and do <EM>not</EM> work correctly.</P>
