ToTI (C) 1998 LJS
ToTI converts the output from a Z80 assembler to a .86p file for a TI-86
calculator.  This is only useful if your into writing your own assembly
programs for your TI-86.

You will need OS37 or above to run it.

There are other programs you will need to complete your collection of
programming tools for your TI-86.

You will require a Z80 assembler.  There is only one that comes to mind that
is written for the Amiga and that's CAZ.  Its available on Aminet .
You will also need some software to transfer your newly made .86p file wont
you?
Send85 will do the job nicely, although written for a TI-85 it will work for
the 86.  There is documentation included with this software detailing the
construction of the serial adapter.

Once you have written your assembly source code, assemble it into a memory 
dump.  Dont bother with the namby pamby S record files or even worse 
Intel hex, all we want is a memory dump.
CAZ will generate this as default.

Then convert the assembler output to the .86p file :-

toti a.out smiley.86p Smiley

a.out is the output from the assembler, smiley.86p is the .86p file your
going to create and Smiley is the name of the program which will appear on
your TI-86.

And thats it, transfer the thing to your calc, run it and then?
It either works first time, It crashes your calc and you spend ages 
debugging your source!!!

CAZ and Snd85 are available from Aminet and I had nothing to do with any
of them.
