In order to compile as31 for Amiga only minimal changes were necessary.
(One strncpy had to be changed to strcpy (gcc problem?) and in the Makefile
-m486 had to be discarded)

This version is improved by Paul Stoffregen (mainly Intel Hex support)
(needed for his superb Paulmon and Paulmon2)

In order to run as31 ixemul.library is needed. (Available on Aminet
or Geek Gadgets)
