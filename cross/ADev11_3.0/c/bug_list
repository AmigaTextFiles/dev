ID  LEVEL  DESCRIPTION

  -------- LIVE BUGS --------
61    4     if the first of two arguments to a function call contains an
              expression with an undefined symbol the following argument
              (a simple variable) is the one declared as undefined.
54    4     the compiler does not correctly pass instances of structures to
              functions, it seems that was never coded in.  Passing a
              structure rather than a pointer to it is a dumb idea anyway.
51    4     prototype checking for too few arguments is non-existant
38    4     the compiler forgets to generate a label for a static function
              that is consistent with the label it uses when the address
              of the function is stored in a function pointer.
37    4     the compiler was never coded to initialize structures local to
              a function. An example statement would be;
              struct st = {3, 4, DOG};
64    3     printf does not handle floats
62    3     scanf does not work at all for reasons I don't understand and
              can't determine without a better debugging system.
60    3     the put_asc_l family of functions in C_lib are not implemented
              thus attempts to print longs will not happen.
56    2     a "register used" tracking peep-hole optimization could markedly
              improve code generation in cases such as
                * if (*chr_ptr == 's') {
                        ldx   _chr_ptr
                        ldab  0,x
                        cmpb  #'s'
                        bne   L4
                *   ...
                * } else if (*chr_ptr == 't') {
                L4
                        ldx   _chr_ptr
                        ldab  0,x
                        cmpb  #'t'
                        bne   L5
                *   ...
                * }
              In the second clause both the ldx and ldab could be removed,
              This is a tricky optimization and will be left undone.
44    2     change the linker to allow replacing functions
20    2     add an option/keyword/pragma to allow placement of variables
              in zero page memory
21    1     allow C++ style comments
14    1     eliminate the lc_auto label used for local var access (inc  4-L1,Y)

  -------- NEWLY DEAD BUGS --------

  -------- ROTTING BUGS --------
49    4     ellipsis handling for prototype checking is incorrect
50    4     prototype checking for too many arguments is non-existant
59    3     bugs in conversions of larger types to smaller types
58    3     comparisons generating incorrect code
57    3     casts of constants are being ignored
53    3     missing ldx 0,x in direct version of switch statement
52    3     various fixes to stdio routines
45    3     the following statement breaks the compiler repeatedly
              file_ptr->_buff[file_ptr->_wr_cnt++] = *((char *)file_ptr->_io_ext->_data)++;
43    3     two errors in the long branch optimizer could (although rarely)
              cause a short branch range to be exceeded.
39    3     size of return values from functions is not being used.  The
              default size of int is being used.
36    3     initialization of structures, longs and pointers are not correct
35    3     return of address of variable produces a 68000 addr mode
29    3     post fix auto increment of longs where result is used in further
              expressions is not done
26    3     incorrect handling of char cast to int as function parameter
22    3     bugs in string usage
17    3     multiply and divide library functions need to be coded
16    3     all comparisons (if, while etc.) will not work with longs
              this is due to missing 4 byte compare
15    3     one form of switch statement will not work with longs
              this is due to missing 4 byte compare
12    3     various errors in local vars, using local vars, function
              parameters -Stan
13    3     returning a constant from a function resulted in a 68000 instr -Stan
6     3     a short branch is always used even when a long one is req'd -Stan
7     3     the switch statement generates a sequence that crashes SAsm -Stan
5     3     increment decrement is not correct with longs -Stan
2     3     incorrect code in ?: syntax -Stan
31    2     a hangover from the 68000 version is forcing structures to an
              even byte size
32    2     the assembler (SAsm) must be modified to handle zero page
              XREF's  (XREF.z	L99999999) and segments
24    2     Modify linker to handle IDATA
28    2     auto increment by sizes other than char doesn't advance efficiently
              for post fix forms
25    2     write c.o startup program
55    2     optimize std x/ldd x and stab x/ldab x
46    2     optimize ldd followed by cpd #0
41    2     optimize the &= and |= operators to bit ops where possible and
              add a compiler option to generate 6301 bit ops instead or to
              not generate bit ops if 6301 bit ops prove insufficient.
              CANCEL!! 6301 can never be used effectively with C (no Y reg)
42    2     optimize the +, -, += and -= operators to do a faster version
              when the operand is a simple variable.
48    2     use of float variables should now be correct.  There is also a
              new library (math.lib) containing arithmatic and trigonometric
              functions.
47    2     three HC11 specific builtin functions must be added; enable_intr()
              = CLI, disable_intr() = SEI and wait_for_intr() = WAI
34    2     add peephole optimization cmpb #0 ==> tstb and if it follows a
              ldab remove it completely
19    2     add an option to generate PROMable programs
              ( the -P option generates initialized data into an IDATA segment
              when the linker sees this, it creates a BSS the size of the
              segment and make this segment into code. Your program must call
              _init_data to cause the code image to be copied to the BSS.
              This will first require a rev of the linker.)
1     2     allow for 8 bit pushes to stack instead of "pshd" in binary ops
              with 8 bit operands -Stan
10    2     create a static compiler option that forces local vars to
              static -Stan
              ( this option is -w )
9     2     optimize incdec to use inx/dex for 2 byte operands -Stan
              (this was not done, the existing method is one byte longer
              but, normally, 4 cycles faster.)
4     2     automatic promotion of numerics to any size (with cbl cwl) does
              not happen -Stan
8     2     the switch statement needs optimization
3     2     multiply of char * char to char forces to int size -Stan
63    1     the quiet option now defaults to on
23    1     compiler always reports same version at startup
27    1     write printf,scanf routines
40    1     due to the importance of prototypes for return values from
              functions it is neccesary to add a warning whenever a
              function is used before its prototype is known.
33    1     default path for includes should be ADev11:include
11    1     remove muldiv32 option
