I've recompiled these source files so that they'll work with the new
redirection of std*. I haven't touched the ito* printf11 uto* routines
cos they're heavily hand optimized - the source provided will compile into
an appropriate file, but they'll be ~20-30% larger than the provided .asm
files.

I've compiled the scanf function group, but I've no idea whether they work
or not!! - Have fun!
