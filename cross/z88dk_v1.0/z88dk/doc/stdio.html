<H4>This file is an early stage of writing and should not be regarded as a
definitive guide to the functions in the C library, nor should what is said
about each function be taken as the truth - always check the library source
code!</H4>

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=2>
<TR>
<TD>extern FILE *fopen(char *name, char *access);</TD>
<TD>Open a file on the Z88, the file is loaded from the current directory
however you can specify the entire path. The access mode may be either "r","w","a" for read, write and append.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern int fclose(FILE *fp);</TD>
<TD>Close the file specified by the file handle fp (supplied by fopen)</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern fgets(char *buffer, int count, FILE *fp);</TD>
<TD>Read from file fp a maximum of <I>count</I> bytes and place them in buffer. This function will stop reading when a \n or EOF is found. fgets returns the number of bytes read.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern fputc(unsigned char c, FILE *fp);</TD>
<TD>Put character c to file fp</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern fgetc(FILE *fp);</TD>
<TD>Read a character from file fp</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern fputs(char *buffer, FILE *fp);</TD>
<TD>Write the string contained in buffer to file fp</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern feof(FILE *fp);</TD>
<TD>Test for EOF on file fp</TD>
</TR>
<TD>extern putc(char c)</TD>
<TD>putc is a macro which puts the charcter c to stdout. If you redirect
stdout, then it could go to a file!</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern printf(char *format,...);<BR>
extern fprintf(FILE *fp, char *format,...);</TD>
<TD>
A simple cut down printf that handles ints and chars and strings. (f)printf knows nothing about floats, longs or far pointers. Even though cut down, using this function will add 2k to your executable.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern int remove(char *filename);</TD>
<TD>Delete the file with the name filename</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern int rename(char *src, char *dest);</TD>
<TD>Rename the file src giving it the newname dest</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern char getk();</TD>
<TD>Scan keyboard for a keypress, if no key is pressed it will return NULL</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern char getkey();</TD>
<TD>Wait for keypress</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern putchar(char);</TD>
<TD>Put a character to the screen, similar to putc except that it always
puts the character to the screen, even if stdout is redirected.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern putn(int);</TD>
<TD>Print the integer on the screen</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern puts(char *);</TD>
<TD>Print the string to the screen. Unlike ANSI this does not append a \n to the end of the string</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>extern settxy(int x, int y);</TD>
<TD>Set the current screen coordinates to (x,y)</TD>
</TR>
