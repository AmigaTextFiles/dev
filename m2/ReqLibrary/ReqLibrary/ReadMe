This is a Modula-2-interface to Colin Fox's and Bruce Dawson's "req.library"
V2.5 (AmigaLibDisk419) for A+L AG's Modula-2-compiler "M2Amiga" V4.0. For the
use of the library refer to the documents for the "req.library".

The interface-modules are public-domain, but if you want to use them in
commercial programs, please inform me!
