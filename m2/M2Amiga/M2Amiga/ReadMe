Welcome to the Amiga Modula-2 Demo System!                            © 21.9.87

This  demo system  has full  functionality  of the released  product but limits
the  size  of  compilable  programs.  Also  just a few  interface  and standard
libraries are  included in this system. The basic idea of  this  demo system is
offering the possibility to have a close look at this product and its features.

A list of features can be found in the product  announcement  also available on
this disk. A  summary  of differences  to other  Modula-2  compilers  certainly
contains the following points:

- Compiler generates direct ROM calls using the library pointer supplied by the
  run-time system and the library offset supplied by the symbol file. There are
  NO object files for  Amiga libraries!  It is  also possible to write your own
  inteface  definitions  to standard Amiga  libraries or  custom libraries. The
  same mechanism can be used to interface an Amiga device.
- This single pass compiler is based on Professor  Wirth's lastest  development
  and is very fast without producing bad  code. Famous is Wirth's  alogorith to
  recover from compilation errors to avoid stupid followup error messages.
- The run-time system is very userfriendly. Processor traps  are announced by a
  requester and the program is  terminated. It provides  the means for resource
  tracking which  allows you to  release all  allocated resources after program
  crash or termination. The standard  libraries, based on  this mechanism, free
  all  allocated  memory,  close all open  files or windows.  It also  supports
  interrupt driven <CTRL>-C handling. Hit <CTRL>-C and  your program is stopped
  and terminated.

You are now in the Modula-2 editor. You can move around in this text by
pressing the left or right mousebutton while pointing on the dashed line
at the bottom of the screen. Please try it now!

This disk does not contain the Amiga operating system. Please use the
programm DoMe to produce a usable Modula-2 disk. DoMe will copy parts
of your Workbench disk and most of this disk onto a new disk. You should
therefore prepare an empty, formatted disk using the format command
before you start DoMe.

This disk contains some programs in the directory 'Demos'. You can either
copy the whole directory to an empty disk or copy single programs you want to
compile on your Modula-2 disk.

NOTE: If you have problems with our half tone icons, use the white parts to
      select them.
