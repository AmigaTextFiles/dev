Cyclone Control Centre
----------------------

Cyclone Control Centre is an application to control easy the switches of the
compiler and linker of Cyclone.

With the button "Save Default" CCC will save two files (cmc.opt and cml.opt)
in the directory am2:. With button "Save" the two files are saved in the
current directory.

The compiler and linker use always the current dir settings before am2:
If the files in the current dir are not available than the settings stored
in am2: will be used.

CCC is written with the Cyclone Modula-2 Compiler and make use of MUI.
MUI is written by Stefan Stuntz.
