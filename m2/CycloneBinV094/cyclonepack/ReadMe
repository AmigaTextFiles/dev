                         by Marcel Timmermans

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Welcome to Cyclone.  This is a modula-2 development system.  For global
information about the specifiek programs please look into the Cyclone.guide. 


Warning
=======

Be sure that you recompile all symbol and objectfiles before using the
compiler!! This is necessary because the symbol- and objectformat has been
changed!! :(

When you only use modules from the am2:modules and am2:oomodules dir and
you didn't replace/add any modules.  Than you do not need to recompile the
modules if you install the latest CycloneModule.lha archive.



Package information
-------------------

For a complete system you will need the following archives:

CycloneBinVxxx.lha
CycloneModules.lha (latest date)

If you like you can also look at the demos archive:

CycloneDemos.lha


Installation
------------

Copy the archive files to a tempory destination. f.e. ram:

extract CycloneBinVxxx.lha 

lha x CycloneBinVxxx.lha 

Start the installscript.
