  release Apr 5, 2011 changes from previous release Feb 28, 2010
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
          
  Compiler     - Mod2 v3.1 Beta (13.2.2011)
               - fix for CARDINAL8 * TwoPowerConst -> CARDINAL32 giving wrong result
               - Fix for "char number literals":
                 CAP(c), where c was a CONST CHAR was giving an error.
               - Fix for const parameters to M2 standard functions
                 eg, the second call to INT(801.0) was giving a bad result.


  M2IDE        - v0.4 (28.3.2011)
             Changes:
               - New editor "plug-in", AnnFront, integrates editor Annotate (with limitations)
                 into M2IDE.
               - Status message now reports "ok" on successful compiles.
 
  System Mods  - Bugfix in M2RTS: The default input/output window opened when a program is started from Workbench
                 were not taking input from the keyboard. Now using CON: rather than RAW:
                 for this window.@{_ITEMEND_}
               - Module DebugIO (and thus also Debugging.DebugPause) now has a 60 second timeout.
               
  Amiga Libs   - updated for release 53.20
                  > DOS FileHandle and FileLock are now opaque types rather than ADDRESS.
                  > Rasters is using AreaInfoPtr instead of ADDRESS for appropriate parameters
                  > GraphicsInterfaces VectorBuffer parameter for InitArea() changed from 
                    ARRAY OF POINT to ADDRESS. It is not really an array of point; each vector
                    takes 5 bytes in it.
          
  Reaction     - updated for release 53.20
                  > ReactionPrefs and UserInterfPrefs moved to directory Reaction from directory Amiga.
                    
  ISO Mods     - RealStr v0.3 (10.10.2010)
                  > Rounding is implemented fairly correctly
                  > Changed code to compensate for a very infrequent glitch in compiler's TRUNC().
                  > RealToFixed() is now working for reals > approx 4294967300  (2^32-1)
                  > WriteReal() and RealToFloat() now use the output space as ISO specifies.
                 
  Aglet Mods   - AmigaTimer v1.6 (13.12.2010) 
                  > Supporting new timer modes for "waituntil" and "entropy". Changed mode from a number to
                    an enumeration type, TimerFlavors.  
                  > new procs GetEClock(), GetEClockFreq() and GetEntropyATimer()
                  > Since they are used as library calls, a TimerHandle is no longer needed as parameter
                    for procs GetSysTime() and GetSysTOD()
               - StrMacros  v0.2 (3.4.2011)
                  > missing comma between parameters in a macro call no long hang the program.
               - SimpRexx1  v0.3  (13.3.2011)    
                  > Added automatic single quotes around Port name since it is necessary if port name
                    does not happen to be all caps.
               - PipeIO v0.6  (16.2.2011)                                        
                  > Added ReadPipeLine() for more efficient buffered reading line by line.
                  > Similarly, added dReadPipeLine() unlimited line lengths.
                  > added a Timeout Exception feature
                 
  Experimental - OsRun  v0.3 (27.3.2011)
                  > added Proc SpawnRedirect() to provide for specifying the standard in/out/err
                  > added Proc BreakOffspring() to send ^C to all Spawned children.
                  > added Procs WaitForStarted() and CheckForProcessRunning().
               - SimpleGraphics  v1.3 (16.2.2011)
                  > implemented BufferedScreens, at least enough for straightforward animations.
                  > Methods ForeColor Get/Set moved from class GraphPlot up into parent class GraphRegion.
                  > other bug fixes
               - Obj v1.1 (16.5.2010)  
                  > added func ooClassSameOrDescendent() so that you can test this, not just assert it.
