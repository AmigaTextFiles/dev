Here is a (hopefully) complete interface to ARP for all Benchmark Modula-2
programmers. Just one quick word: I hadn't that much time to test it. Although
it seems pretty bug free, there still may be some of them crawling around
somewhere.

Some functions were not documented in my current release of ARP. If anybody
has documentation for these routines, let me know.
