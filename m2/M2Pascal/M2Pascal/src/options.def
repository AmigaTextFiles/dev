DEFINITION MODULE options;

(*  


   by : Greg Mumm

   This module deals with the various user adjustable options available
   to anyone using the program. It's purpose is twofold:  

                1) To allow other modules information as to what the options 
                   are ( i.e. should the "begin" keyword go on the next
                   line ? )
*)

                         BeginNewLine     :  BOOLEAN;
                      END;

END options.
