OVERVIEW:

     This program was developed because of the popularity of pascal and
     the lack of a decent pascal compiler for the Amiga. My intent in
     writing this program was to help the college student with his projects
     by enabling him to use his Modula-2 compiler and all of the advantages
     of the language and environment without stepping down to a pascal
     compiler.

     In theory this is how it work: write the assignment at home with
     your Amiga and Modula-2 package and then run it through 'm2pascal'--
     presto -- pascal. It's a lot easier then doing it by hand ! Of course
     this program is not limited to college students, but keep in mind that
     it is intended for short, simple programs.

     This work is released to the public-domain and may be modified at will, so
     long as it's not sold for profit and my name is keep intact somewhere.
     This is the first real program I ever wrote, so it's not written very 
     well. Scan.mod, for instance, is especially buggy and difficult to 
     understand.

     Because of it's public domain nature there is no warranty, implied
     or otherwise. Use at your own risk!


QUICK AND DIRTY:

     Nobody likes reading documentation! Here's how to run this program:


                   ****************************
                   *                          *
                   *  1> copy test.mod ram:   *
                   *  1> copy m2pascal ram:   *
                   *                          *
                   *  1> m2pascal test.mod    *   +Make sure test.mod compiles
                   *                          *    with no errors under 
                   *                          *    Modula-2.
                   *  1> more test.p          *   +Set stack to 10000.
                   *                          *
                   ****************************           

DISCRIPTION:

     Commands :

                -bn, -bd     ->   place "begin" on line BELOW statement
                                  example: m2pascal -bd test.mod test.p
                -?,  -h      ->   help
                                  example: m2pascal -?

     Terminal I/O translation

          -  Commands beginning with "write" (such as "WriteInt" )  are
             translated as the following example shows: The command
             on the right is modula-2, the left is pascal.

                       WriteInt ( number , 1 )   ==>    writeln ( number )

          - Commands beginning with "Read" ( ReadString, ReadInt etc... )
            are are translated as the following example show:

                       ReadInt ( number )   ==>    read ( number )

            note: A pascal readln statement might have to be inserted
            manually after translating with m2pascal.


          - Special note: The benchmark C slash command "\n" is fully 
            supported. For example:

                       WriteString("hi\n")       ==>  write('hi'); writeln;



BUGS/PROBLEMS:  ( hey I SAID it was public domain, did you keep the receipt? )

     Outputfile ( object file ) destroyed without query.      ( scan.mod )

     Spaces REQUIRED in INC/DEC/ALLOCATE/DEALLOCATE commands: ( StandardIO.mod )
 
                 INC ( i , 1 ) ;      works, but   INC(i,1,);     doesn't 

     Tabs treated as one space.                               ( OutModule.mod )

         -Tabs don't work correctly in some circumstances. The use of a tab 
          might cause the output "not to be aligned" with the above line OR
          may extend the text beyond the designated line length.
    
        - Running m2detab or a similar tab removable program will solve
          the problem.

     Doesn't respond well to single statements seperated onto seperate lines.

     Multidemensional arrays not supported. 

     CASE statement not supported.                           ( process.mod )

         - If you have a CASE statement edit the resulting pascal program
           as follows:

                   - Place a 'begin' after all colons.
                   - If the CASE statement has a default ('ELSE...') option
                     then erase the 'end' directly before it or your program
                     will have one too many end's in it.

     Do not use the underscore character "_" in variable names if your pascal
     compiler doesn't support it.

     Do not use empty parenthesis in the declaration of a procedure:

            PROCEDURE flag () : BOOLEAN           PROCEDURE flag : BOOLEAN;
                                           OR
                           wrong                               right
    
     Procedures which contain the keyword 'RETURN' but do not return a value
     will be translated incorrectly.     

     Intended for single pass modula-2 compiler ONLY. ( like benchmark )

                   - m2pascal will not arrange procedures/functions in your
                     resulting file to work with a single pass pascal compiler.

     Intended for use on syntactically correct modula-2 programs. If there
     is an error in your program m2pascal may behave unpredictably.


EXTENSIONS:

     Nested functions. Technically this is illegal in Module-2, but maybe
     the new standard will support it.

     Infinitely many nested comments are accepted. ( The resulting pascal
     compiler may not support this. )

     The C slash command for a new line ( "\n" ) is understood.

     Keyword 'begin' can be put on the line following the command with
     the "-bn" command line option:

          if a=1 then begin              if a=1 then
           ...                   OR      begin
           ...                            ...
          end;                           end;
     

COMPILATION NOTES NOT USING BENCHMARK:

    The only compiler I own is the Benchmark compiler so I have not tried
    compiling it with anything else. The source is as generic as possible. 
    Remember that benchmark allows the underscore char "_" in variable names. 
    Also remember that the C slash commands are also supported in 
    benchmark strings (i.e. "\n" ).
