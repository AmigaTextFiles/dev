When I first grew out of Pascal, and was looking at Modula 2 to gain
access to those nice features of the Amiga, such as custom screens and
flashy graphics, I did not buy a Modula 2 compiler right away.

Instead I picked up the PD Modula 2 available on Fred Fish #24, this was
around 1987, long before Benchmark Modula 2 came out. The PD Compiler
lacked several standard modules as well as the Amiga Specific modules.

Through long hours of reading Advanced Amiga Basic and looking at .bmap
files I was able to write some Definition and Implementation modules for
the Graphics and Intuition Amiga Libraries. Also a MathLib0 Module which
was missing.


The files in this archive are as follows:

   Intution.DEF & Intuition.MOD
   Graphic.DEF  & Graphic.MOD

These are Definition and Implementation modules to access the Graphics
library and Intuition library from the PD Modula 2 compiler found on
Fred Fish disk #24. They go in the m2 directory of that disk.

FlashyPD.MOD is the source code for one of my first Modula 2 programs
with the Fred Fish #24 Modula 2 program, it requires those as well as
the MathLib0 modules.

Flashy2 is an enhanced version of FlashyPD written in TDI Modula 2, both
FlashyPD and Flashy2 grew out of the Color Art Amiga Basic Program which
appeared in Amazing Computing somewhere around 1987.

I am releasing these programs for their educational value,
FlashyPD at least worked under 1.2 back when I had my 1000.
Flashy2 will work under 1.2 and 1.3
