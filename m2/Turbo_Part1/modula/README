This is an update to V1.3, and contains bug fixes and some new features
(see docs/whatsnew.doc).

There is a mailing list for the compiler, see docs/maillist.doc

A debugger is under development, a very simple prototype was done before
christmas, and it worked very well. However I have not done any work on it
since xmas because I've been very busy. When it does get finished it may be
released as shareware.

The second part of the distribution: the dice archive, has not be changed since
since the V1.3, so no need to download it! You can use you old modula/dice
directory (if you havent already deleted it :( ).Ive been looking around for
the latest version of freeware dice, and may update the supplied dice
distribution if i can find a newer version. If you are still using 1.1 then
make sure you download the second archive because it was updated during
the 1.1->1.2->1.3 updates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Turbo Modula-2 is not public domain, all files (except the DICE archive)
are (C) 1994 by Amritpal Mann. The system may only be distributed unmodified
and without profit.

The compiler is of commercial quality: its fast, generates small & fast code,
doesn't eat too much memory and the error reports are normally very accurate
and clear.

This is the only freeware implementation of Modula-2 for the amiga that I am
a aware of (theres one on Fish 23, buts its not serious).

Turbo should run on any Amiga computer (1.5M+Hard-Disk recommended).
If you dont already have Matt Dillon's DICE system installed on your hard-disk
then the first thing to do is to extract the DICE archive (dice/dice.lha) using
the dice/m2extract script.

>cd dice
>execute m2extract

To install type:

>assign MODULA: <dir> ; <dir> = directory where you unarchived Turbo
>execute MODULA:s/startup ; assuming you're using the supplied version of dice

If youre not using the supplied version of dice then you should modify
the s/startup script.

If you have any problems, feel free to Email.

To compile & link a program:

>m2b Module.mod

Note that some Amigas (mainly some A3000/A4000) cannot use the compiler
pointer checking option ('-p'). If you get bogus 'ILLEGAL POINTER' requesters
while running any of your (or my example) programs then you should replace
the '-p' in the MODULA:M2OPTS file with '-P' and then recompile.
If you still get spurious errors then remove the flag completely.

You are advised to read all the files in docs/ before using any of the programs.

If you dont have access to Email then you can to write me:
