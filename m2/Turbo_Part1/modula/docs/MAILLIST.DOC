			The Turbo Modula-2 Mailing list
			===============================

    A mailing list has been set up to provide support for Turbo Modula-2 users
    and allow discussion of the system and the Modula-2 language in general.

    To subsribe send a message to maillist@econet.demon.co.uk, with
    subject field: SIGNON turbo-list.

    Send actual messages to turbo-list@econet.demon.co.uk

    The mail list server is run on an acorn archi computer by Daedulas,
    he uses a dial up internet account and so mailed messages will only be
    propagated each time he logs on. This is normally once per day. He told me
    that when he gets a decent serial card his computer will auto log on and
    shift mail every hour.
