This example illustrates how to call a 'C' language function from Modula-2
The function SayHello() defined in Hello.c is called from test.mod

To compile type
>m2b Test.mod Hello.o

This wil invoke the following
m2c Test.mod
m2l Test.o Hello.o

Where hello.o is object file compiled from Hello.c
Hello.o will be passed through to DLINK.

As Hello.o is a standard object file, it could just as well have been
assembled from a file Hello.a.
