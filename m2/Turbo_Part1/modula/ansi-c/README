This directory contains defintions for the ANSI-C standard library.
This is a very powerful & flexible library.
Except for the functions in StdIO, most of the commonly used functions are
commented.
For more information you should see any book on ANSI-C or buy the full
version of DICE which contains examples, manual pages & source code for each
of the functions.
