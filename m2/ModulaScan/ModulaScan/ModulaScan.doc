NAME

        ModulaScan


FORMAT

        Not runable from Shell or WB.


PURPOSE

        Modula-II Scanner for GoldED.


SPECIFICATION

        ModulaScan was written to use with the "FUNC" command of GoldED. It
        recognizes PROCEDUE-, TYPE-, CONST- and VAR objects. So GoldED is able
        to generate a referencefile of all your Modula Definition modules. Now
        you can look up the definition of the function under the cursor with
        only one keyhit.


OPTIONS

        None.

EXAMPLE

        the following text

        ----
        PROCEDURE test;

        TYPE str:ARRAY [0..10] OF CHAR;
             dummy:CARDINAL;

        CONST drei=3;

        VAR eins,zwei:INTEGER
        ----

        will generate an object list with the items "test, str, eins, drei".

BUGS

        None (I hope).
