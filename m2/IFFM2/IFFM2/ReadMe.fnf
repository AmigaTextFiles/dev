This material was submitted to me on disk directly by the author, Gregory
Epley, for inclusion in the library.  Thanks Gregory!  Below is an excerpt
from his note to me, included on the disk:

  PLEASE make sure that you mention that the IFFM2 materials will only work
  with Interface Technologies M2Amiga Modula-2 Rel 3.1 (but they should also
  work with Rel 3.2e).
