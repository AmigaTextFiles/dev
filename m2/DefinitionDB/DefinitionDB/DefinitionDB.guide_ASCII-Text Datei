@node INTRO  "Introduction"
The included programs MakeDB, MSearchDB, CycloneFindDefinition.rexx
should make programming a little bit easier for you, as they will
help you to find the exact definition of a procedure, type, constant,
or variable. It is somewhat like m2ohm from the M2Amiga system, but
currently much more limited.

It is intended for use with Cyclone by Marcel Timmermans, but should
also work with M2Amiga.

@node REQUIRES  "Requires"

Required:
- AmigaOS 2.0+ (only 3.1 tested so far)
- MUI 3.6+

Recommended:
something better than a 68000/7, 512KB ...

@endnode


@node QUICK  "Quick start"
From a shell type:
>makedb am2:modules/txt/#?.def am2:oomodules/txt/#?.def

This will put all standard definition modules into the DB, add your custom
modules (Mui#?.def etc.) to the line above.

Start MSearchDB and try it out (has bubble help).

(Hey, now read the full docs!)
@endnode


@node MAKEDB  "MakeDB"
MakeDB is for packing all definitions from several definition file into
a database, that allows fast lookup.
It will make/use the directory "am2:DefinitionDB" to store the DB in three
files (DefIndex.dat, DefNames.dat and DefStrings.dat).
You can start MakeDB from the Shell/CLI and give all definition modules to
be included in the DB as parameters. Currently it is not possible to add
or delete something to/from the DB, so if you have spread your definition
modules over many directories then you should make yourself a little
script.

Note: MakeDB uses Dos file buffering, which is not activated before
AmigaOS 3.0 (3.1??). It might run much slower on 2.x systems :(

Warning: Right now MakeDB is not very robust. Do NOT feed it with anything
else than correct Modula2/Cylone definition modules!!

@node MSearchDB  "MSearchhDB"
MSearchDB is for looking up single entries in the DB. You can type them in,
look for them in the index or submit them via arexx.

@{B}Listview:@{UB}
The big listview can show three different things. Whenever an identifier
was found or a definition module was load directly, the title line will
display the name of the module and show it. You can scroll around, but
currently it is not possible to click on single words fur further
information.
If you press the "Load"-Button then a list of modules that can be loaded
will be shown.
If an identifier is not in the DB or if you pressed the "Index" button,
then the alphabetic sorted index is shown.

@{B}String gadget:@{UB}
Here you can type in words to look up by hand.

@{B}Load button:@{UB}
An alphabetic sorted list of definition modules will be displayed.
Doubleclick on one to load and show it.

@{B}Index button:@{UB}
Will show all identiiers in the DB. Doubleclick on one to load the
definition files it is in. (On slow computers: Set menu
Settings/Show Index/paged)

@{B}< and > buttons:@{UB}
If there is more than one match for an identifier (f.e allocate) and you
are viewing a definition module, then you can jump to the previous/next
definition without using the index.

@{B}@{U}Menus:@{UB}@{UU}

@{B}Project/About ...@{UB}
Aaaaaahhhhh...

@{B}Project/About MUI ...:@{UB}
Oooooohhhhhh...

@{B}Project/Quit Program@{UB}
Quit program. (See also Settings/MUI ...)

@{B}Settings/Show Index@{UB}
It is not uncommon for the index to hold 8000 entries or more. Displaying
them all at once is a little bit slow on some amigas. So you could set this
menu to "paged", which will only show the direct neighbours of an identifier
which is often enough if your problem is just a simple typo.

@{B}Settings/MUI...@{UB}
Will call MUI-Preferences, so you could adjust local prefs for MSearchDB.
Read on if you have not much mui experience so far:
(All on system page)
- Turn off bubble help, after some time it is more annoying than helpful.
- If you do not have you editor on the WB screen, then set "Screen" to
  frontmost or whatever, to let MSearchDB pop up on your editor screen.
- If the msearchdb window is in your way, do not quit but iconify it.
  Deiconify is much faster than a new startup, because the DB has not to be
  loaded again into memory. Assign a hotkey for iconify!
- (on list page) The listview uses a fixed font. Set this to something
  nicer than topaz/8 (Courier/13 or so recommended)

@{B}Settings/MUI...@{UB}
Will save settings permanently.

@node REXX  "Cyclone_FindDefinition.rexx"
This is a rexx script for calling MSearchDB from inside your editor.
It will launch MSearchDB, if it is not already running. Then it
submits the word that is under the cursor to MSearchDB.

Is it directly useable with BED, but should be easily adapted for any
other editor:
-'GetWord' gets the word from under the cursor. The command might have
another nameeditor on your system.
- Also you have to change "msearchpath" to your setup.

@node HISTORY  "History"
V0.5
  -initial release

Future
  MakeDB
  - make it faster and more robust with corrupt input files
  - allow adding and deleting of single definition modules

  MSearchDB
  - pattern matching optional
  - history buffer
  - highlight all identifiers in a definition module and use
    them as links

Send me you suggestions
