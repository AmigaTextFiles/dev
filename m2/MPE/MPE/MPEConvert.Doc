INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

MPEConvert is very simple. With this program you can convert the old mpe
config files convert to the lateset version of today. The best thing is
to run this every time you get an update from mpe.


HOW IT WORKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well it works very easly. Just run mpeconvert with the specific directory
f.e  MPEConvert M2:
Now mpeconvert converts every mpe config file to the latest version of mpe
it also looks in sub-directories.
Also mpe.opt in the s: directory will be changed (this option is for the
user define settings). Good luck!


Sorry for my poor (school) english.
