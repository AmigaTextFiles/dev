I spent lots of hours finetuning the 'iris-mono' and 'iris-color',
please email me if you find a program that does display improperly,
or try to tune by yourself and send me a fixed version. ;)

'amiga-fb' is 'amiga-f' but with no colors i made it coz 'amiga'
is disaster. 'amiga-fb' is for use with console on the Workbench.
