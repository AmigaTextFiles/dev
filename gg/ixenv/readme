	These are the neccesary files required for most ixemul ports.

	Installation steps:
	-Put the directory 'gg' in SYS:
	-Put the contents of DEVS,L and LIBS to DEVS:, L: and LIBS:
	-Put the gg-startup script in S:
	-Include the line 'execute gg-startup' in S:startup-sequence

	If you put the 'gg' directory to another location than SYS:,
	you must modify the first line of gg-startup to match the new
	location.
