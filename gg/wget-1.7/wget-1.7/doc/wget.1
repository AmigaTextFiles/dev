.SH "SYNOPSIS"

wget [\fIoption\fR]... [\fIURL\fR]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
GNU Wget is a freely available network utility to retrieve files from
the World Wide Web, using HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) and
FTP (File Transfer Protocol), the two most widely used Internet
protocols.  It has many useful features to make downloading easier, some
of them being:
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background,
while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval
and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By
contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence,
which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
Wget is capable of descending recursively through the structure of
\s-1HTML\s0 documents and \s-1FTP\s0 directory trees, making a local copy of
the directory hierarchy similar to the one on the remote server.  This
feature can be used to mirror archives and home pages, or traverse the
web in search of data, like a \s-1WWW\s0 robot.  In that
spirit, Wget understands the \f(CWnorobots\fR convention.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
File name wildcard matching and recursive mirroring of directories are
available when retrieving via \s-1FTP\s0.  Wget can read the time-stamp
information given by both \s-1HTTP\s0 and \s-1FTP\s0 servers, and store it
locally.  Thus Wget can see if the remote file has changed since last
retrieval, and automatically retrieve the new version if it has.  This
makes Wget suitable for mirroring of \s-1FTP\s0 sites, as well as home
pages.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
Wget works exceedingly well on slow or unstable connections,
retrying the document until it is fully retrieved, or until a
user-specified retry count is surpassed.  It will try to resume the
download from the point of interruption, using \f(CWREST\fR with \s-1FTP\s0
and \f(CWRange\fR with \s-1HTTP\s0 servers that support them.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
By default, Wget supports proxy servers, which can lighten the network
load, speed up retrieval and provide access behind firewalls.  However,
if you are behind a firewall that requires that you use a socks style
gateway, you can get the socks library and build Wget with support for
socks.  Wget also supports the passive \s-1FTP\s0 downloading as an
option.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
Builtin features offer mechanisms to tune which links you wish to follow.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
The retrieval is conveniently traced with printing dots, each dot
representing a fixed amount of data received (1KB by default).  These
representations can be customized to your preferences.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
Most of the features are fully configurable, either through command line
options, or via the initialization file \fI.wgetrc\fR.  Wget allows you to define \fIglobal\fR startup files
(\fI/usr/local/etc/wgetrc\fR by default) for site settings.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
Finally, \s-1GNU\s0 Wget is free software.  This means that everyone may use
it, redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the \s-1GNU\s0 General
Public License, as published by the Free Software Foundation.

Append to \fIlogfile\fR.  This is the same as \fB\-o\fR, only it appends
to \fIlogfile\fR instead of overwriting the old log file.  If
\fIlogfile\fR does not exist, a new file is created.

Turn on debug output, meaning various information important to the
developers of Wget if it does not work properly.  Your system
administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without debug support, in
which case \fB\-d\fR will not work.  Please note that compiling with
debug support is always safe---Wget compiled with the debug support will
\fInot\fR print any debug info unless requested with \fB\-d\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-q\fR" 4

.Ip "\fB--non-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--non-verbose\fR"
Non-verbose output---turn off verbose without being completely quiet
(use \fB\-q\fR for that), which means that error messages and basic
information still get printed.
.Ip "\fB\-i\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-i\fR \fIfile\fR"
.Ip "\fB--input-file=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--input-file=\fR\fIfile\fR"
Read URLs from \fIfile\fR, in which case no URLs need to be on
the command line.  If there are URLs both on the command line and
in an input file, those on the command lines will be the first ones to
be retrieved.  The \fIfile\fR need not be an \s-1HTML\s0 document (but no
harm if it is)---it is enough if the URLs are just listed
sequentially.
.Sp
However, if you specify \fB--force-html\fR, the document will be
regarded as \fBhtml\fR.  In that case you may have problems with
relative links, which you can solve either by adding \f(CW<base
href="\fIurl\fR">\fR to the documents or by specifying
\fB--base=\fR\fIurl\fR on the command line.
.Ip "\fB\-F\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-F\fR"
.Ip "\fB--force-html\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--force-html\fR"
When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an \s-1HTML\s0
file.  This enables you to retrieve relative links from existing
\s-1HTML\s0 files on your local disk, by adding \f(CW<base
href="\fIurl\fR">\fR to \s-1HTML\s0, or using the \fB--base\fR command-line
option.
.Ip "\fB\-B\fR \fI\s-1URL\s0\fR" 4

.IX Item "\fB--base=\fR\fI\s-1URL\s0\fR"
When used in conjunction with \fB\-F\fR, prepends \fI\s-1URL\s0\fR to relative
links in the file specified by \fB\-i\fR.
.Sh "Download Options"
.IX Subsection "Download Options"
.Ip "\fB--bind-address=\fR\fI\s-1ADDRESS\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--bind-address=\fR\fI\s-1ADDRESS\s0\fR"
When making client \s-1TCP/IP\s0 connections, \f(CWbind()\fR to \fI\s-1ADDRESS\s0\fR on
the local machine.  \fI\s-1ADDRESS\s0\fR may be specified as a hostname or \s-1IP\s0
address.  This option can be useful if your machine is bound to multiple
IPs.
.Ip "\fB\-t\fR \fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-t\fR \fInumber\fR"
.Ip "\fB--tries=\fR\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--tries=\fR\fInumber\fR"
Set number of retries to \fInumber\fR.  Specify 0 or \fBinf\fR for
infinite retrying.
.Ip "\fB\-O\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-O\fR \fIfile\fR"
.Ip "\fB--output-document=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--output-document=\fR\fIfile\fR"
The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all will
be concatenated together and written to \fIfile\fR.  If \fIfile\fR
already exists, it will be overwritten.  If the \fIfile\fR is \fB\-\fR,
the documents will be written to standard output.  Including this option
automatically sets the number of tries to 1.
.Ip "\fB\-nc\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-nc\fR"
.Ip "\fB--no-clobber\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--no-clobber\fR"
If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory, Wget's
behavior depends on a few options, including \fB\-nc\fR.  In certain
cases, the local file will be \fIclobbered\fR, or overwritten, upon
repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved.
.Sp
When running Wget without \fB\-N\fR, \fB\-nc\fR, or \fB\-r\fR,
downloading the same file in the same directory will result in the
original copy of \fIfile\fR being preserved and the second copy being
named \fIfile\fR\fB.1\fR.  If that file is downloaded yet again, the
third copy will be named \fIfile\fR\fB.2\fR, and so on.  When
\fB\-nc\fR is specified, this behavior is suppressed, and Wget will
refuse to download newer copies of \fIfile\fR.  Therefore,
``\f(CWno-clobber\fR'\*(R' is actually a misnomer in this mode---it's not
clobbering that's prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already
preventing clobbering), but rather the multiple version saving that's
prevented.
.Sp
When running Wget with \fB\-r\fR, but without \fB\-N\fR or \fB\-nc\fR,
re-downloading a file will result in the new copy simply overwriting the
old.  Adding \fB\-nc\fR will prevent this behavior, instead causing the
original version to be preserved and any newer copies on the server to
be ignored.
.Sp
When running Wget with \fB\-N\fR, with or without \fB\-r\fR, the
decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a file depends
on the local and remote timestamp and size of the file.  \fB\-nc\fR may not be specified at the same
time as \fB\-N\fR.
.Sp
Note that when \fB\-nc\fR is specified, files with the suffixes
\fB.html\fR or (yuck) \fB.htm\fR will be loaded from the local disk
and parsed as if they had been retrieved from the Web.
.Ip "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-c\fR"
.Ip "\fB--continue\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--continue\fR"
Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when you
want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget, or
by another program.  For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        
\&        wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z
.Ve
If there is a file named \fIls-lR.Z\fR in the current directory, Wget
will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will
ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the
length of the local file.
.Sp
Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just want the
current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should the
connection be lost midway through.  This is the default behavior.
\fB\-c\fR only affects resumption of downloads started \fIprior\fR to
this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting around.
.Sp
Without \fB\-c\fR, the previous example would just download the remote
file to \fIls-lR.Z.1\fR, leaving the truncated \fIls-lR.Z\fR file
alone.
.Sp
Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use \fB\-c\fR on a non-empty file, and
it turns out that the server does not support continued downloading,
Wget will refuse to start the download from scratch, which would
effectively ruin existing contents.  If you really want the download to
start from scratch, remove the file.
.Sp
Also beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use \fB\-c\fR on a file which is of
equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the
file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when the file
is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it was changed
on the server since your last download attempt)---because ``continuing'\*(R'
is not meaningful, no download occurs.
.Sp
On the other side of the coin, while using \fB\-c\fR, any file that's
bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
download and only \f(CW(length(remote) - length(local))\fR bytes will be
downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This behavior can
be desirable in certain cases---for instance, you can use \fBwget \-c\fR
to download just the new portion that's been appended to a data
collection or log file.
.Sp
However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been
\fIchanged\fR, as opposed to just \fIappended\fR to, you'll end up
with a garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file
is really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be especially
careful of this when using \fB\-c\fR in conjunction with \fB\-r\fR,
since every file will be considered as an \*(L"incomplete download\*(R" candidate.
.Sp
Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use
\fB\-c\fR is if you have a lame \s-1HTTP\s0 proxy that inserts a
``transfer interrupted'\*(R' string into the local file.  In the future a
``rollback'\*(R' option may be added to deal with this case.
.Sp
Note that \fB\-c\fR only works with \s-1FTP\s0 servers and with \s-1HTTP\s0
servers that support the \f(CWRange\fR header.
.Ip "\fB--dot-style=\fR\fIstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--dot-style=\fR\fIstyle\fR"
Set the retrieval style to \fIstyle\fR.  Wget traces the retrieval of
each document by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a
fixed amount of retrieved data.  Any number of dots may be separated in
a \fIcluster\fR, to make counting easier.  This option allows you to
choose one of the pre-defined styles, determining the number of bytes
represented by a dot, the number of dots in a cluster, and the number of
dots on the line.
.Sp
With the \f(CWdefault\fR style each dot represents 1K, there are ten dots
in a cluster and 50 dots in a line.  The \f(CWbinary\fR style has a more
``computer'\*(R'\-like orientation---8K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots
per line (which makes for 384K lines).  The \f(CWmega\fR style is
suitable for downloading very large files---each dot represents 64K
retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each line
(so each line contains 3M).  The \f(CWmicro\fR style is exactly the
reverse; it is suitable for downloading small files, with 128-byte dots,
8 dots per cluster, and 48 dots (6K) per line.
.Ip "\fB\-N\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-N\fR"
.Ip "\fB--timestamping\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--timestamping\fR"
Turn on time-stamping.  
.Ip "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-S\fR"
.Ip "\fB--server-response\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--server-response\fR"
Print the headers sent by \s-1HTTP\s0 servers and responses sent by
\s-1FTP\s0 servers.
.Ip "\fB--spider\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--spider\fR"
When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web \fIspider\fR,
which means that it will not download the pages, just check that they
are there.  You can use it to check your bookmarks, e.g. with:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        
\&        wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html
.Ve
This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the
functionality of real \s-1WWW\s0 spiders.
.Ip "\fB\-T seconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-T seconds\fR"
.Ip "\fB--timeout=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--timeout=\fR\fIseconds\fR"
Set the read timeout to \fIseconds\fR seconds.  Whenever a network read
is issued, the file descriptor is checked for a timeout, which could
otherwise leave a pending connection (uninterrupted read).  The default
timeout is 900 seconds (fifteen minutes).  Setting timeout to 0 will
disable checking for timeouts.
.Sp
Please do not lower the default timeout value with this option unless
you know what you are doing.
.Ip "\fB\-w\fR \fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-w\fR \fIseconds\fR"
.Ip "\fB--wait=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--wait=\fR\fIseconds\fR"
Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.  Use of
this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by making the
requests less frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the time can be
specified in minutes using the \f(CWm\fR suffix, in hours using \f(CWh\fR
suffix, or in days using \f(CWd\fR suffix.
.Sp
Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network or the
destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough to
reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the retry.
.Ip "\fB--waitretry=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--waitretry=\fR\fIseconds\fR"
If you don't want Wget to wait between \fIevery\fR retrieval, but only
between retries of failed downloads, you can use this option.  Wget will
use \fIlinear backoff\fR, waiting 1 second after the first failure on a
given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the second failure on that
file, up to the maximum number of \fIseconds\fR you specify.  Therefore,
a value of 10 will actually make Wget wait up to (1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 55
seconds per file.

Note that this option is turned on by default in the global
\fIwgetrc\fR file.
.Ip "\fB\-Y on/off\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-Y on/off\fR"

.IX Item "\fB\-Q\fR \fIquota\fR"
.Ip "\fB--quota=\fR\fIquota\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--quota=\fR\fIquota\fR"
Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value can be
specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with \fBk\fR suffix), or
megabytes (with \fBm\fR suffix).
.Sp
Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So if you
specify \fBwget \-Q10k ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls-lR.gz\fR, all of the
\fIls-lR.gz\fR will be downloaded.  The same goes even when several
URLs are specified on the command-line.  However, quota is
respected when retrieving either recursively, or from an input file.
Thus you may safely type \fBwget \-Q2m \-i sites\fR---download will be
aborted when the quota is exceeded.
.Sp
Setting quota to 0 or to \fBinf\fR unlimits the download quota.

.IX Item "\fB--no-directories\fR"
Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving recursively.
With this option turned on, all files will get saved to the current
directory, without clobbering (if a name shows up more than once, the
filenames will get extensions \fB.n\fR).
.Ip "\fB\-x\fR" 4

.Ip "\fB--force-directories\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--force-directories\fR"
The opposite of \fB\-nd\fR---create a hierarchy of directories, even if
one would not have been created otherwise.  E.g. \fBwget \-x
http://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt\fR will save the downloaded file to
\fIfly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-nH\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-nH\fR"
.Ip "\fB--no-host-directories\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--no-host-directories\fR"
Disable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By default, invoking
Wget with \fB\-r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/\fR will create a structure of
directories beginning with \fIfly.srk.fer.hr/\fR.  This option disables
such behavior.
.Ip "\fB--cut-dirs=\fR\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--cut-dirs=\fR\fInumber\fR"
Ignore \fInumber\fR directory components.  This is useful for getting a
fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval will
be saved.
.Sp
Take, for example, the directory at
\fBftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/\fR.  If you retrieve it with
\fB\-r\fR, it will be saved locally under
\fIftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/\fR.  While the \fB\-nH\fR option can
remove the \fIftp.xemacs.org/\fR part, you are still stuck with
\fIpub/xemacs\fR.  This is where \fB--cut-dirs\fR comes in handy; it
makes Wget not ``see'\*(R' \fInumber\fR remote directory components.  Here
are several examples of how \fB--cut-dirs\fR option works.
.Sp
.Vb 8

.Ve
If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this option is
similar to a combination of \fB\-nd\fR and \fB\-P\fR.  However, unlike
\fB\-nd\fR, \fB--cut-dirs\fR does not lose with subdirectories---for
instance, with \fB\-nH --cut-dirs=1\fR, a \fIbeta/\fR subdirectory will
be placed to \fIxemacs/beta\fR, as one would expect.

Set directory prefix to \fIprefix\fR.  The \fIdirectory prefix\fR is the
directory where all other files and subdirectories will be saved to,

.IX Item "\fB--html-extension\fR"
If a file of type \fBtext/html\fR is downloaded and the \s-1URL\s0 does not
end with the regexp \fB\e.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?\fR, this option will cause
the suffix \fB.html\fR to be appended to the local filename.  This is
useful, for instance, when you're mirroring a remote site that uses
\fB.asp\fR pages, but you want the mirrored pages to be viewable on
your stock Apache server.  Another good use for this is when you're
downloading the output of CGIs.  A \s-1URL\s0 like
\fBhttp://site.com/article.cgi?25\fR will be saved as
\fIarticle.cgi?25.html\fR.
.Sp
Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded every time
you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that the local
\fI\fIX\fR.html\fR file corresponds to remote \s-1URL\s0 \fIX\fR (since
it doesn't yet know that the \s-1URL\s0 produces output of type
\fBtext/html\fR.  To prevent this re-downloading, you must use
\fB\-k\fR and \fB\-K\fR so that the original version of the file will be
saved as \fI\fIX\fR.orig\fR.

encode them using either the \f(CWbasic\fR (insecure) or the

When set to off, disable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget will
send the remote server an appropriate directive (\fBPragma:
no-cache\fR) to get the file from the remote service, rather than
returning the cached version.  This is especially useful for retrieving
and flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers.
.Sp
Caching is allowed by default.
.Ip "\fB--cookies=on/off\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--cookies=on/off\fR"
When set to off, disable the use of cookies.  Cookies are a mechanism
for maintaining server-side state.  The server sends the client a cookie
using the \f(CWSet-Cookie\fR header, and the client responds with the
same cookie upon further requests.  Since cookies allow the server
owners to keep track of visitors and for sites to exchange this
information, some consider them a breach of privacy.  The default is to
use cookies; however, \fIstoring\fR cookies is not on by default.
.Ip "\fB--load-cookies\fR \fIfile\fR" 4

not saved.
.Ip "\fB--ignore-length\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--ignore-length\fR"
Unfortunately, some \s-1HTTP\s0 servers (\s-1CGI\s0 programs, to be more
precise) send out bogus \f(CWContent-Length\fR headers, which makes Wget
go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.  You can spot
this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again and again,
each time claiming that the (otherwise normal) connection has closed on
the very same byte.
.Sp
With this option, Wget will ignore the \f(CWContent-Length\fR header---as
if it never existed.
.Ip "\fB--header=\fR\fIadditional-header\fR" 4

Define an \fIadditional-header\fR to be passed to the \s-1HTTP\s0 servers.

Identify as \fIagent-string\fR to the \s-1HTTP\s0 server.
.Sp
The \s-1HTTP\s0 protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a
\f(CWUser-Agent\fR header field.  This enables distinguishing the
\s-1WWW\s0 software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of
protocol violations.  Wget normally identifies as
\fBWget/\fR\fIversion\fR, \fIversion\fR being the current version
number of Wget.
.Sp
However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of tailoring
the output according to the \f(CWUser-Agent\fR\-supplied information.
While conceptually this is not such a bad idea, it has been abused by
servers denying information to clients other than \f(CWMozilla\fR or
Microsoft \f(CWInternet Explorer\fR.  This option allows you to change
the \f(CWUser-Agent\fR line issued by Wget.  Use of this option is
discouraged, unless you really know what you are doing.

.Ip "\fB--dont-remove-listing\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--dont-remove-listing\fR"
Don't remove the temporary \fI.listing\fR files generated by \s-1FTP\s0
retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory listings
received from \s-1FTP\s0 servers.  Not removing them can be useful for
debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to easily check on the
contents of remote server directories (e.g. to verify that a mirror
you're running is complete).
.Sp
Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this file,
this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making
\fI.listing\fR a symbolic link to \fI/etc/passwd\fR or something and
asking \f(CWroot\fR to run Wget in his or her directory.  Depending on
the options used, either Wget will refuse to write to \fI.listing\fR,
making the globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the
symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual
\fI.listing\fR file, or the listing will be written to a
\fI.listing.\fInumber\fR\fR file.
.Sp
Even though this situation isn't a problem, though, \f(CWroot\fR should
never run Wget in a non-trusted user's directory.  A user could do
something as simple as linking \fIindex.html\fR to \fI/etc/passwd\fR
and asking \f(CWroot\fR to run Wget with \fB\-N\fR or \fB\-r\fR so the file
will be overwritten.

.Ip "\fB--glob=on/off\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--glob=on/off\fR"
Turn \s-1FTP\s0 globbing on or off.  Globbing means you may use the
shell-like special characters (\fIwildcards\fR), like \fB*\fR,
\fB?\fR, \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR to retrieve more than one file from the
same directory at once, like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        
\&        wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg
.Ve
By default, globbing will be turned on if the \s-1URL\s0 contains a
globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing on or off
permanently.
.Sp
You may have to quote the \s-1URL\s0 to protect it from being expanded by
your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing, which is
system-specific.  This is why it currently works only with Unix \s-1FTP\s0
servers (and the ones emulating Unix \f(CWls\fR output).
.Ip "\fB--passive-ftp\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--passive-ftp\fR"
Use the \fIpassive\fR \s-1FTP\s0 retrieval scheme, in which the client

to work behind firewalls.
.Ip "\fB--retr-symlinks\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--retr-symlinks\fR"
Usually, when retrieving \s-1FTP\s0 directories recursively and a symbolic
link is encountered, the linked-to file is not downloaded.  Instead, a
matching symbolic link is created on the local filesystem.  The
pointed-to file will not be downloaded unless this recursive retrieval
would have encountered it separately and downloaded it anyway.
.Sp
When \fB--retr-symlinks\fR is specified, however, symbolic links are
traversed and the pointed-to files are retrieved.  At this time, this
option does not cause Wget to traverse symlinks to directories and
recurse through them, but in the future it should be enhanced to do
this.
.Sp
Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was
specified on the commandline, rather than because it was recursed to,
this option has no effect.  Symbolic links are always traversed in this
case.

The \fB\-r\fR option is to retrieve recursively, and \fB\-nd\fR to not

After the download is complete, convert the links in the document to
make them suitable for local viewing.  This affects not only the visible
hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to external content,
such as embedded images, links to style sheets, hyperlinks to non-\s-1HTML\s0
content, etc.
.Sp
Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:
.Ip "\(bu" 8
.IX Item "\(bu"
The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be changed to
refer to the file they point to as a relative link.
.Sp
Example: if the downloaded file \fI/foo/doc.html\fR links to
\fI/bar/img.gif\fR, also downloaded, then the link in \fIdoc.html\fR
will be modified to point to \fB../bar/img.gif\fR.  This kind of
transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of directories.
.Ip "\(bu" 8
.IX Item "\(bu"
The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will be changed
to include host name and absolute path of the location they point to.
.Sp
Example: if the downloaded file \fI/foo/doc.html\fR links to
\fI/bar/img.gif\fR (or to \fI../bar/img.gif\fR), then the link in
\fIdoc.html\fR will be modified to point to
\fIhttp://\fIhostname\fR/bar/img.gif\fR.
.Sp
Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file was
downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was not
downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address rather than
presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former links are converted
to relative links ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to
another directory.
.Sp
Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which links have
been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done by \fB\-k\fR will be
performed at the end of all the downloads.

.IX Item "\fB--mirror\fR"
Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on recursion

\fB\-r \-N \-l inf \-nr\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-p\fR"
.Ip "\fB--page-requisites\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--page-requisites\fR"
This option causes Wget to download all the files that are necessary to
properly display a given \s-1HTML\s0 page.  This includes such things as
inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.
.Sp
Ordinarily, when downloading a single \s-1HTML\s0 page, any requisite documents
that may be needed to display it properly are not downloaded.  Using
\fB\-r\fR together with \fB\-l\fR can help, but since Wget does not
ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined documents, one is
generally left with ``leaf documents'\*(R' that are missing their
requisites.
.Sp
For instance, say document \fI1.html\fR contains an \f(CW<IMG>\fR tag
referencing \fI1.gif\fR and an \f(CW<A>\fR tag pointing to external
document \fI2.html\fR.  Say that \fI2.html\fR is similar but that its
image is \fI2.gif\fR and it links to \fI3.html\fR.  Say this
continues up to some arbitrarily high number.
.Sp
If one executes the command:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        
\&        wget -r -l 2 http://I<site>/1.html
.Ve
then \fI1.html\fR, \fI1.gif\fR, \fI2.html\fR, \fI2.gif\fR, and
\fI3.html\fR will be downloaded.  As you can see, \fI3.html\fR is
without its requisite \fI3.gif\fR because Wget is simply counting the
number of hops (up to 2) away from \fI1.html\fR in order to determine
where to stop the recursion.  However, with this command:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        
\&        wget -r -l 2 -p http://I<site>/1.html
.Ve
all the above files \fIand\fR \fI3.html\fR's requisite \fI3.gif\fR
will be downloaded.  Similarly,
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        
\&        wget -r -l 1 -p http://I<site>/1.html
.Ve
will cause \fI1.html\fR, \fI1.gif\fR, \fI2.html\fR, and \fI2.gif\fR
to be downloaded.  One might think that:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        
\&        wget -r -l 0 -p http://I<site>/1.html
.Ve
would download just \fI1.html\fR and \fI1.gif\fR, but unfortunately
this is not the case, because \fB\-l 0\fR is equivalent to
\fB\-l inf\fR---that is, infinite recursion.  To download a single \s-1HTML\s0
page (or a handful of them, all specified on the commandline or in a
\fB\-i\fR \s-1URL\s0 input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off
\fB\-r\fR and \fB\-l\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        
\&        wget -p http://I<site>/1.html
.Ve
Note that Wget will behave as if \fB\-r\fR had been specified, but only
that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links from that
page to external documents will not be followed.  Actually, to download
a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist on separate
websites), and make sure the lot displays properly locally, this author
likes to use a few options in addition to \fB\-p\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        
\&        wget -E -H -k -K -nh -p http://I<site>/I<document>
.Ve
In one case you'll need to add a couple more options.  If \fIdocument\fR
is a \f(CW<FRAMESET>\fR page, the \*(L"one more hop\*(R" that \fB\-p\fR gives you
won't be enough---you'll get the \f(CW<FRAME>\fR pages that are
referenced, but you won't get \fItheir\fR requisites.  Therefore, in
this case you'll need to add \fB\-r \-l1\fR to the commandline.  The
\fB\-r \-l1\fR will recurse from the \f(CW<FRAMESET>\fR page to to the
\f(CW<FRAME>\fR pages, and the \fB\-p\fR will get their requisites.  If
you're already using a recursion level of 1 or more, you'll need to up
it by one.  In the future, \fB\-p\fR may be made smarter so that it'll
do \*(L"two more hops\*(R" in the case of a \f(CW<FRAMESET>\fR page.
.Sp
To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea of an
external document link is any \s-1URL\s0 specified in an \f(CW<A>\fR tag, an
\f(CW<AREA>\fR tag, or a \f(CW<LINK>\fR tag other than \f(CW<LINK
REL="stylesheet">\fR.

.IX Item "\fB--follow-ftp\fR"
Follow \s-1FTP\s0 links from \s-1HTML\s0 documents.  Without this option,
Wget will ignore all the \s-1FTP\s0 links.
.Ip "\fB--follow-tags=\fR\fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--follow-tags=\fR\fIlist\fR"
Wget has an internal table of \s-1HTML\s0 tag / attribute pairs that it
considers when looking for linked documents during a recursive
retrieval.  If a user wants only a subset of those tags to be
considered, however, he or she should be specify such tags in a
comma-separated \fIlist\fR with this option.
.Ip "\fB\-G\fR \fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-G\fR \fIlist\fR"
.Ip "\fB--ignore-tags=\fR\fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--ignore-tags=\fR\fIlist\fR"
This is the opposite of the \fB--follow-tags\fR option.  To skip
certain \s-1HTML\s0 tags when recursively looking for documents to download,
specify them in a comma-separated \fIlist\fR.  
.Sp
In the past, the \fB\-G\fR option was the best bet for downloading a
single page and its requisites, using a commandline like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        
\&        wget -Ga,area -H -k -K -nh -r http://I<site>/I<document>
.Ve
However, the author of this option came across a page with tags like
\f(CW<LINK REL="home" HREF="/">\fR and came to the realization that
\fB\-G\fR was not enough.  One can't just tell Wget to ignore
\f(CW<LINK>\fR, because then stylesheets will not be downloaded.  Now the
best bet for downloading a single page and its requisites is the
dedicated \fB--page-requisites\fR option.
.Ip "\fB\-H\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-H\fR"
.Ip "\fB--span-hosts\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--span-hosts\fR"
Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving.
.Ip "\fB\-L\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-L\fR"
.Ip "\fB--relative\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--relative\fR"
Follow relative links only.  Useful for retrieving a specific home page
without any distractions, not even those from the same hosts.
.Ip "\fB\-I\fR \fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-I\fR \fIlist\fR"
.Ip "\fB--include-directories=\fR\fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--include-directories=\fR\fIlist\fR"
Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to follow when
downloading  Elements
of \fIlist\fR may contain wildcards.
.Ip "\fB\-X\fR \fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-X\fR \fIlist\fR"
.Ip "\fB--exclude-directories=\fR\fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--exclude-directories=\fR\fIlist\fR"
Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to exclude from
download  Elements of
\fIlist\fR may contain wildcards.
.Ip "\fB\-nh\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-nh\fR"
.Ip "\fB--no-host-lookup\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--no-host-lookup\fR"
Disable the time-consuming \s-1DNS\s0 lookup of almost all hosts.
.Ip "\fB\-np\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB\-np\fR"
.Ip "\fB--no-parent\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB--no-parent\fR"
Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving recursively.
This is a useful option, since it guarantees that only the files
\fIbelow\fR a certain hierarchy will be downloaded.
.SH "FILES"
.IX Header "FILES"
.Ip "\fB/usr/local/etc/wgetrc\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB/usr/local/etc/wgetrc\fR"
Default location of the \fIglobal\fR startup file.
.Ip "\fB.wgetrc\fR" 4
.IX Item "\fB.wgetrc\fR"
User startup file.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
You are welcome to send bug reports about GNU Wget to
<\f(CWbug-wget@gnu.org\fR>.
.PP
Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.
.Ip "1." 4
.IX Item "1."
Please try to ascertain that the behaviour you see really is a bug.  If
Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If Wget does not behave as documented,
it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not sure about the way
they are supposed to work, it might well be a bug.
.Ip "2." 4
.IX Item "2."
Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.  E.g. if
Wget crashes on \fBwget \-rLl0 \-t5 \-Y0 http://yoyodyne.com \-o
/tmp/log\fR, you should try to see if it will crash with a simpler set of
options.
.Sp
Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of your
\fI.wgetrc\fR file, just dumping it into the debug message is probably
a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see if the bug repeats
with \fI.wgetrc\fR moved out of the way.  Only if it turns out that
\fI.wgetrc\fR settings affect the bug, should you mail me the relevant
parts of the file.
.Ip "3." 4
.IX Item "3."
Please start Wget with \fB\-d\fR option and send the log (or the
relevant parts of it).  If Wget was compiled without debug support,
recompile it.  It is \fImuch\fR easier to trace bugs with debug support
on.
.Ip "4." 4
.IX Item "4."
If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. \f(CWgdb `which
wget` core\fR and type \f(CWwhere\fR to get the backtrace.
.Ip "5." 4
.IX Item "5."
Find where the bug is, fix it and send me the patches. :\-)
