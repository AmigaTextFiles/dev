This is the GNU implementation of sed, the Unix stream editor.

Compiled using GCC 2.9.5 with optimization at the highest
possible level, 3.

NOTES:

      - I decided to use 2.9.5 instead of 3.4.0 coz
        the second one produces incredible huge code,
        about 1.2 Mib way too fat... -this is IMO 
        unacceptable for m68k.
