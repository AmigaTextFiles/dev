verison 4.2:
	* Normal users can now execute codeblue (upon request)

version 4:
	* Implemented Nimda Registry database query to add infected hosts
          to their ever-growing database with the -q option
        * Now sends email as high priority
        * Now uses default return-to address of postmaster@yourhost.
          You can still specify a return-to address with the new -e option
        * Can now only be run as root for security reasons
        * Lots of code optimization, clean up, etc..
