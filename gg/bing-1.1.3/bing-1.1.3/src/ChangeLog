*** Release 1.1.3 ***

Fri Jun 05 07:30:49 MET DST 1997
	- Modified the Win32 code to improve the RTT measurment. It now uses
	  the QueryPerformanceCounter API to get an 8 microsecond precision.
	- Improved the portability of the bing 1.1 serie. It has been 
	  compiled and tested on:
		AIX 2
		HP-UX 10
		Linux 2.0.27
		Solaris 2.5
		SunOS 4.1.3
		Windows 95
		Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0 on i386
	- Fixed a bug in finishit, secs should be a double not a long.
	- Fixed a bug related to srand()/rand(). On some platforms (alpha, 
	  win32) RAND_MAX is not INT_MAX in which case the content of the 
	  buffer was not random.
	- Modified the output to make it more readable. bing now display Mbps
	  or Kbps as sensible.
	- Converted the bing man page format from mandoc to man. This should
	  be more portable.
	- Changed the order in which adapt_rtt checks the RTT for coherency. 
	  It seems safer to check the coherency for each host separately first
	  and only then to check the coherency between hosts.

	- ported to Win32. This involves a new icmp module which

	  directory and the unix specific parts are in the ux

	  on many links.
