autoconf 2.13 configured for AmigaOS4.

The sourcecode can be found here: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf

I have after building it renamed the files to *-2.13.
In autoreconf-2.13 have I changed the top autoconf and autoheader paths to represent /SDK/Local/C/autoconf-2.13 and /SDK/Local/C/autoheader-2.13

Please read the original README file that is in the same directory.

Best regards,
