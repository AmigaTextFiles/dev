HTDUMP
==================================
This package is a commandline tool to retrieve www pages. This
is especially usefull for automated scripts and in debugging
purposes. If you are a web developer then this tool will help
you to see what is going on with your CGI's.

Please note that this package has only been tested with 
Slackware Linux and is almost certain to compile with errors
on other systems, however I think I coded pretty clean ANSI C,
so bugs should be easy enough to fix. If you port this program
to another platform, please send me the diff's.



SSL SUPPORT
==================================
To install this package you have the choice of compiling it with or
without SSL support. To compile with SSL support follow the following
steps first.

  (1) Download the OpenSSL lib from http://www.openssl.org/

  If compiled htdump with OpenSSL 0.9.4, but I think any version
  will do if it's not too old.

  (2) tar -xvzf openssl-0.9.4.tar.gz

  (3) cd openssl-0.9.4\

  (4) ./configure

  Select your operating system here, note that htdump has only been
  tested on Slackware Linux so far though.

  (5) make

  (6) make install

All of this will put some .h include files and 2 .a lib files
in /usr/local/ssl which we will take with us in our compilation.

ATTENTION, depending on your local situation, laws may prevent you
from using this package with encryption support. Please check local
laws before using this program. You can always compile without SSL
support to be safe.



COMPILING
==================================
Compilation is pretty easy. Follow the following steps.

  (1) tar -xvzf htdump-0.9x.tar.gz

  (2) cd htdump-0.9x\

  (3) make

      -OR-

      make ssl

To compile the SSL version install the OpenSSL lib first.

If you wish to compile either the normal version or SSL version
after you compiled the other type you can do so without having
to delete any object files. The existing htdump binary will
be replaced though.

If this doesn't work for you, you can always download a
pre-compiled ELF binary from my website.



MAKE
==================================
Your options with this makefile are:

  htdump      Compiles the program without SSL
              (same as 'make' or 'make all')

  ssl         Compiles the program with SSL support

  install     Copy htdump to /usr/local/bin/

  clobber     Clean all object files and htdump itself

  clean       Clean all object files but leave htdump

  clear       Clear the screen


Options can be issued on the same line, for example:

  make clear clobber ssl
