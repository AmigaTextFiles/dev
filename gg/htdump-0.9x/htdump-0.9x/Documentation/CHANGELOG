Version 0.9x:
------------------------
* Added more examples and stuff to the website
* Fixed more typos
* Moved SSL code from main.c to socket.c
* Moved connect.c to socket.c
* Added open, read, write and close to socket.c
* Update file writing code
  - moved from main.c to file.c
  - if file present, appends automatically
  - if file present, changes RANGE header automatically 
* File downloading is automatic now, meaning if you
  give the -f switch, htdump will look if a file allready
  exists. If it does exist, it will look if it has any
  permissions. If permissions are absent it will assume the
  file has not finished downloading yet, and will resume
  to download the file, automatically added Range headers
  to the request. File permissions are set to 644 when
  the file is completely downloaded.
* Changed from short to long arguments, this will break
  scripts. Sorry, I was running out of letters :(
* Changed the way arguments are processed. Instead of
  changing the original Argv and Argc, everything
  is now copied, parsed and dynamically allocated.
  All of this to get ready to read in a list of URL's
  from the same site, and thus using the Keep-Alive
  method which is infinitly faster then seperate
  connections, certainly with SSL connections.
* Fixed a dynamic allocation bug. Strings did not
  get their trailing zero copied.
* Added some prelimenary download status.
  When using -file and -debug, you get to see
  how many bytes are downloaded sofar.
* Fixed bug where you couldn't redirect stdout.
  Turned out OpenFile was not called and output
  went through stdin instead.
* Program SEGV's when downloading a big file.
  Probably in the receive function, if I make the buffers REALLY large
  it seldomly occurs anymore, also if I get a socket reading error
  (or writing) then usually some other data is corrupt too. probably
  the output fd that gets overwritten.
  Was a problem with ReadSocket, fixed it.
* Some commandline options were switched


Version 0.9u: (INTERNAL)
------------------------
* Fixed some typo's in the usage screen
* Saving a file would have no permissions at
  all. Fixed to to set it on 644
* Seems to be a bug in the htdump code that
  when -d is given, the base64 encoding doesn't
  work right. Seems to be fixed in this version.
* Packet dumping with -dd was removed from the
  code.. Added this again.
* Added to the README files and such.

 
Version 0.9t:
------------------------
* Initial Release
