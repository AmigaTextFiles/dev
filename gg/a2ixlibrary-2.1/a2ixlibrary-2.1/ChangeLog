	* string_hash.c: increased symbol buffer len. so long('g++') 
	symbols wont crash the hasher.
	* postlink.c: increased name buffer in 'lib' struct from 10
	to 108 bytes, so postlinking libraries with names longer
	than 10 bytes wont trash the relocs and thus the binary.
	* Modified the code here and there so kit can be used with 
	gcc-3 as well.
	* a2ixlibrary: Added '-noinst' option that allows to use
	user's own instance macro.
	* added 'gena2ixinst.rexx' script that in conjunction with
	'-noinst' allows to generate handy and magic macros.
	* added missing 'ld' wrapper to the distribution.

	* postlink.c (main): Apply patch from Hans to use dynamically
