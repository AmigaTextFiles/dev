#
# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE:
#
# This file describes the capabilities of various character-cell terminals,
# as needed by software such as screen-oriented editors.
#
# Other terminfo and termcap files exist, supported by various OS vendors
# or as relics of various older versions of UNIX.  This one is the longest
# and most comprehensive one in existence.  It subsumes not only the entirety
# of the historical 4.4BSD, GNU, System V and SCO termcap files and the BRL
# termcap file, but also large numbers of vendor-maintained termcap and
# terminfo entries more complete and carefully tested than those in historical
# termcap/terminfo versions.
#
# Pointers to related resources (including the ncurses distribution) may
# be found at <http://www.tuxedo.org/terminfo>.
#
# INTERNATIONALIZATION:
#
# This file uses only the US-ASCII character set (no ISO8859 characters).
#
# This file assumes a US-ASCII character set. If you need to fix this, start
# by global-replacing \E(B and \E)B with the appropriate ISO 6429 enablers
# for your character set.  \E(A and \E)A enables the British character set
# with the pound sign at position 2/3.  
#
# In a Japanese-processing environment using EUC/Japanese or Shift-JIS,
# C1 characters are considered the first-byte set of the Japanese encodings,
# so \E)0 should be avoided in <enacs> and initialization strings.
#
# FILE FORMAT:
#
# The version you are looking at may be in any of three formats: master
# (terminfo with OT capabilities), stock terminfo, or termcap.  You can tell
# which by the format given in the header above.
#
# The master format is accepted and generated by the terminfo tools in the
# ncurses suite; it differs from stock (System V-compatible) terminfo only
# in that it admits a group of capabilities (prefixed `OT') equivalent to
# various obsolete termcap capabilities.  You can, thus, convert from master
# to stock terminfo simply by filtering with `sed "/OT[^,]*,/s///"'; but if
# you have ncurses `tic -I' is nicer (among other things, it automatically
# outputs entries in a canonical form).
#
# The termcap version is generated automatically from the master version
# using tic -C.  This filtering leaves in the OT capabilities under their
# original termcap names.  All translated entries fit within the 1023-byte
# string-table limit of archaic termcap libraries except where explicitly
# noted below.  Note that the termcap translation assumes that your termcap
# library can handle multiple tc capabilities in an entry. 4.4BSD has this
# capability.  Older versions of GNU termcap, through 1.3, do not. 
#
# For details on these formats, see terminfo(5) in the ncurses distribution,
# and termcap(5) in the 4.4BSD Unix Programmer's Manual.  Be aware that 4.4BSD
# curses has been declared obsolete by the caretakers of the 4.4BSD sources
# as of June 1995; they are encouraging everyone to migrate to ncurses.
#
# Note: unlike some other distributed terminfo files (Novell Unix & SCO's),
# no entry in this file has embedded comments.  This is so source translation
# to termcap only has to carry over leading comments.  Also, no name field
# contains embedded whitespace (such whitespace confuses rdist).
#
# Further note: older versions of this file were often installed with an editor
# script (reorder) that moved the most common terminal types to the front of
# the file.  This should no longer be necessary, as the file is now ordered
# roughly by type frequency with ANSI/VT100 and other common types up front.
#
# Some information has been merged in from terminfo files distributed by
# USL and SCO (see COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS below).  Much information
# comes from vendors who maintain official terminfos for their hardware
# (notably DEC and Wyse).
#
# A detailed change history is included at the end of this file.
#
# FILE ORGANIZATION:
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry (this feature had to be sacrificed in order
# to allow standard terminfo and termcap syntax to be generated cleanly from
# the master format).  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with 
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more
#
# to see a listing of section headings.  The intent of the divisions is
# (a) to make it easier to find things, and (b) to order the database so
# that important and frequently-encountered terminal types are near the
# front (so that you'll get reasonable search efficiency from a linear
# search of the termcap form even if you don't use reorder).  Minor sections
# usually correspond to manufacturers or standard terminal classes. 
# Parenthesized words following manufacturer names are type prefixes or
# product line names used by that manufacturers.
#
# HOW TO READ THE ENTRIES:
#
# The first name in an entry is the canonical name for the model or
# type, last entry is a verbose description.  Others are mnemonic synonyms for
# the terminal.
#
# Terminal names look like <manufacturer> <model> - <modes/options>
# The part to the left of the dash, if a dash is present, describes the
# particular hardware of the terminal.  The part to the right may be used
# for flags indicating special ROMs, extra memory, particular terminal modes,
# or user preferences.
#
# All names should be in lower case, for consistency in typing.
#
# The following are conventionally used suffixes:
#	-2p	Has two pages of memory.  Likewise 4p, 8p, etc.
#	-am	Enable auto-margin.
#	-m	Monochrome.  Suppress color support
#	-mc	Magic-cookie.  Some terminals (notably older Wyses) can
#		only support one attribute without magic-cookie lossage.
#		Their base entry is usually paired with another that
#		uses magic cookies to support multiple attributes.
#	-nam	No auto-margin - suppress <am> capability
#	-nl	No labels - suppress soft labels
#	-ns	No status line - suppress status line
#	-rv	Terminal in reverse video mode (black on white)
#	-s	Enable status line.
#	-vb	Use visible bell (<flash>) rather than <bel>.
#	-w	Wide - in 132 column mode.
# If a name has multiple suffixes and one is a line height, that one should 
# go first.  Thus `aaa-30-s-rv' is recommended over `aaa-s-rv-30'.  
# 
# Entries with embedded plus signs are designed to be included through use/tc
# capabilities, not used as standalone entries. 
#
# To avoid search clashes, some older all-numeric names for terminals have
# been removed (i.e., "33" for the Model 33 Teletype, "2621" for the HP2621).
# All primary names of terminals now have alphanumeric prefixes.
#
# Comments marked "esr" are mostly results of applying the termcap-compiler
# code packaged with ncurses and contemplating the resulting error messages. 
# In many cases, these indicated obvious fixes to syntax garbled by the
# composers.  In a few cases, I was able to deduce corrected forms for garbled
# capabilities by looking at context.  All the information in the original
# entries is preserved in the comments.
#
# In the comments, terminfo capability names are bracketed with <> (angle
# brackets).  Termcap capability names are bracketed with :: (colons).
#
# INTERPRETATION OF USER CAPABILITIES
#
# The System V Release 4 and XPG4 terminfo format defines ten string
# capabilities for use by applications, <u0>...<u9>.   In this file, we use
# certain of these capabilities to describe functions which are not covered
# by terminfo.  The mapping is as follows:
#
#	u9	terminal enquire string (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 DA)
#	u8	terminal answerback description
#	u7	cursor position request (equiv. to VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48 DSR 6)
#	u6	cursor position report (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 CPR)
#
# The terminal enquire string <u9> should elicit an answerback response
# from the terminal.  Common values for <u9> will be ^E (on older ASCII
# terminals) or \E[c (on newer VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# The cursor position request (<u7>) string should elicit a cursor position
# report.  A typical value (for VT100 terminals) is \E[6n.
#
# The terminal answerback description (u8) must consist of an expected
# answerback string.  The string may contain the following scanf(3)-like
# escapes:
#
#	%c	Accept any character
#	%[...]	Accept any number of characters in the given set
#
# The cursor position report (<u6>) string must contain two scanf(3)-style 
# %d format elements.  The first of these must correspond to the Y coordinate
# and the second to the %d.  If the string contains the sequence %i, it is
# taken as an instruction to decrement each value after reading it (this is
# the inverse sense from the cup string).  The typical CPR value is
# \E[%i%d;%dR (on VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# These capabilities are used by tack(1m), the terminfo action checker
# (distributed with ncurses 5.0).
#
# TABSET FILES
#
# All the entries in this file have been edited to assume that the tabset
# files directory is /usr/share/tabset, in conformance with the File Hierarchy
# Standard for Linux and open-source BSD systems.  Some vendors (notably Sun)
# use /usr/lib/tabset or (more recently) /usr/share/lib/tabset.  
#
# No curses package we know of actually uses these files.  If their location
# is an issue, you will have to hand-patch the file locations before compiling
# this file.
# 
# REQUEST FOR CONTACT INFORMATION AND HISTORICAL MATERIAL
#
# As the ANSI/ECMA-48 standard and variants take firmer hold, and as
# character-cell terminals are increasingly replaced by X displays, much of
# this file is becoming a historical document (this is part of the reason for
# the new organization, which puts ANSI types, xterm, Unix consoles,
# and vt100 up front in confidence that this will catch 95% of new hardware).
#
# For the terminal types still alive, I'd like to have manufacturer's
# contact data (Internet address and/or snail-mail + phone).
#
# I'm also interested in enriching the comments so that the latter portions of
# the file do in fact become a potted history of VDT technology as seen by
# UNIX hackers.  Ideally, I'd like the headers for each manufacturer to
# include its live/dead/out-of-the-business status, and for as many
# terminal types as possible to be tagged with information like years
# of heaviest use, popularity, and interesting features.
#
# I'm especially interested in identifying the obscure entries listed under
# `Miscellaneous obsolete terminals, manufacturers unknown' before the tribal
# wisdom about them gets lost.  If you know a lot about obscure old terminals,
# please go to the terminfo resource page, grab the UFO file (ufo.ti), and 
# eyeball it for things you can identify and describe. 
#
# If you have been around long enough to contribute, please read the file
# with this in mind and send me your annotations.
#
# COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS
#
# The BSD ancestor of this file had a standard Regents of the University of
# California copyright with dates from 1980 to 1993.
#
# Some information has been merged in from a terminfo file SCO distributes.
# It has an obnoxious boilerplate copyright which I'm ignoring because they 
# took so much of the content from the ancestral BSD versions of this file
# and didn't attribute it, thereby violating the BSD Regents' copyright.
#
# Not that anyone should care.  However many valid functions copyrights may
# serve, putting one on a termcap/terminfo file with hundreds of anonymous
# contributors makes about as much sense as copyrighting a wall-full of
# graffiti -- it's legally dubious, ethically bogus, and patently ridiculous.
#
# This file deliberately has no copyright.  It belongs to no one and everyone.
# If you claim you own it, you will merely succeed in looking like a fool. 
# Use it as you like.  Use it at your own risk.  Copy and redistribute freely.
# There are no guarantees anywhere.  Svaha!

######## ANSI, UNIX CONSOLE, AND SPECIAL TYPES
#
# This section describes terminal classes and brands that are still
# quite common.
#

#### Specials
#
# Special "terminals".  These are used to label tty lines when you don't
# know what kind of terminal is on it.  The characteristics of an unknown
# terminal are the lowest common denominator - they look about like a ti 700.

#
# The following is an entry for the full ANSI 3.64 (1977).  It lacks
# padding, but most terminals using the standard are "fast" enough
# not to require any -- even at 9600 bps.  If you encounter problems,
# try including the padding specifications.
#
# Note: the :as: and :ae: specifications are not implemented here, for
# the available termcap documentation does not make clear WHICH alternate
# character set to specify.  ANSI 3.64 seems to make allowances for several.
# Please make the appropriate adjustments to fit your needs -- that is
# if you will be using alternate character sets.
#
# There are very few terminals running the full ANSI 3.64 standard,
# so I could only test this entry on one verified terminal (Visual 102).
# I would appreciate the results on other terminals sent to me.

# Define IBM PC keypad keys for vi as per MS-Kermit while using ANSI.SYS.
# This should only be used when the terminal emulator cannot redefine the keys.
# Since redefining keys with ansi.sys also affects PC-DOS programs, the key
# definitions must be restored.  If the terminal emulator is quit while in vi
# or others using <smkx>/<rmkx>, the keypad will not be defined as per PC-DOS.
# The PgUp and PgDn are prefixed with ESC so that tn3270 can be used on Unix
# (^U and ^D are already defined for tn3270).  The ESC is safe for vi but it
# does "beep".  ESC ESC i is used for Ins to avoid tn3270 ESC i for coltab.
# Note that <kcub1> is always BS, because PC-dos can tolerate this change.
# Caution: vi is limited to 256 string bytes, longer crashes or weirds out vi.
# Consequently the End keypad key could not be set (it is relatively safe and
# actually useful because it sends ^@ O, which beeps and opens a line above).

# Comments in the original are summarized here:
#
# hurd uses 8-bit characters (km).
#
# Although it doesn't do XON/XOFF, we don't want padding characters (xon).
#
# Regarding compatibility to vt100:  hurd doesn't specify <xenl>, as we don't
# have the eat_newline_glitch.  It doesn't support setting or removing tab
# stops (hts/tbc).
#
# hurd uses ^H instead of \E[D for cub1, as only ^H implements <bw> and it is
# one byte instead three.
#
# <ich1> is not included because hurd has insert mode.
#
# hurd doesn't use ^J for scrolling, because this could put things into the
# scrollback buffer.
#
# gsbom/grbom are used to enable/disable real bold (not intensity bright) mode. 
# This is a GNU extension.
#
# The original has commented-out ncv, but is restored here.
#
# Reading the source, RIS resets cnorm, but not xmous.

# From: Benjamin C. W. Sittler <bsittler@nmt.edu>
#
# I have a UNIX PC which I use as a terminal attached to my Linux PC.
# Unfortunately, the UNIX PC terminfo entry that comes with ncurses
# is broken. All the special key sequences are broken, making it unusable
# with Emacs. The problem stems from the following:
# 
# The UNIX PC has a plethora of keys (103 of them, and there's no numeric
# keypad!), loadable fonts, and strange highlighting modes ("dithered"
# half-intensity, "smeared" bold, and real strike-out, for example.) It also
# uses resizable terminal windows, but the bundled terminal program always
# uses an 80x24 window (and doesn't support seem to support a 132-column
# mode.) 
# 
# HISTORY: The UNIX PC was one of the first machines with a GUI, and used a
# library which was a superset of SVr3.5 curses (called tam, for "terminal
# access method".) tam includes support for real, overlapping windows,
# onscreen function key labels, and bitmap graphics. But since the primary
# user interface on the UNIX PC was a GUI program (ua, for "user
# assistant",) and remote administration was considered important for the
# machine, tam also supported VT100-compatible terminals attached to the
# serial port or used across the StarLan network. To simulate the extra keys
# not present on a VT100, users could press ESC and a two-letter sequence,
# such as u d (Undo) or U D (Shift-Undo.) These two-letter sequences,
# however, were not the same as those sent by the actual Undo key. The
# actual Undo key sends ESC 0 s unshifted, and ESC 0 S shifted, for example.
# (If you're interested in adding some of the tam calls to ncurses, btw, I
# have the full documentation and several programs which use tam. It also
# used an extended terminfo format to describe key sequences, special
# highlighting modes, etc.) 
# 
# KEYS: This means that ncurses would quite painful on the UNIX PC, since
# there are two sequences for every key-modifier combination (local keyboard
# sequence and remote "VT100" sequence.) But I doubt many people are trying
# to use ncurses on the UNIX PC, since ncurses doesn't properly handle the
# GUI. Unfortunately, the terminfo entry (and the termcap, too, I presume) 
# seem to have been built from the manual describing the VT100 sequences. 
# This means it doesn't work for a real live UNIX PC. 
# 
# FONTS: The UNIX PC also has a strange interpretation of "alternate
# character set". Rather than the VT100 graphics you might expect, it allows
# up to 8 custom fonts to be loaded at any given time. This means that
# programs expecting VT100 graphics will usually be disappointed. For this
# reason I have disabled the smacs/rmacs sequences, but they could easily be
# re-enabled. Here are the relevant control sequences (from the ESCAPE(7) 
# manpage), should you wish to do so: 
# 
# SGR10 - Select font 0 - ESC [ 10 m or SO
# SGR11 - Select font 1 - ESC [ 11 m or SI
# SGR12 - Select font 2 - ESC [ 12 m
# ... (etc.)
# SGR17 - Select font 7 - ESC [ 17 m
# 
# Graphics for line drawing are not reliably found at *any* character
# location because the UNIX PC has dynamically reloadable fonts. I use font
# 0 for regular text and font 1 for italics, but this is by no means
# universal. So ASCII line drawing is in order if smacs/rmacs are enabled.
# 
# MISC: The cursor visible/cursor invisible sequences were swapped in the
# distributed terminfo.
# 
# To ameliorate these problems (and fix a few highlighting bugs) I rewrote
# the UNIX PC terminfo entry. The modified version works great with Lynx,
# Emacs, and XEmacs running on my Linux PC and displaying on the UNIX PC
# attached by serial cable. In Emacs, even the Undo key works, and many
# applications can now use the F1-F8 keys. 
#

#	from escape(7) in Unix PC 7300 Manual.
#	Somewhat similar to a vt100-am (but different enough
#	to redo this from scratch.)

# Sent by Stefan Stapelberg <stefan@rent-a-guru.de>, 24 Feb 1997, this is
# from SGI's terminfo database.  SGI's entry shows F9-F12 with the codes
# for the application keypad mode.  We have added iris-ansi-ap rather than
# change the original to keypad mode.
#
# (iris-ansi: added rmam/smam based on init string -- esr)
#
# This entry, and those derived from it, is used in xwsh (also known as
# winterm).  Some capabilities that do not fit into the terminfo model
# include the shift- and control-functionkeys:
#
# F1-F12 generate different codes when shift or control modifiers are used.
# For example:
#	F1      	\E[001q
#	shift F1	\E[013q
#	control-F1	\E[025q
#
# In application keypad mode, F9-F12 generate codes like vt100 PF1-PF4, i.e.,
# \EOP to \EOS.  The shifted and control modifiers still do the same thing.
#
# The cursor keys also have different codes:
#	control-up	\E[162q
#	control-down	\E[165q
#	control-left	\E[159q
#	control-right	\E[168q
#
#	shift-up	\E[161q
#	shift-down	\E[164q
#	shift-left	\E[158q
#	shift-right	\E[167q
#
#	control-tab	\[072q

# NetBSD "wscons" emulator in vt220 mode.
# This entry is based on the NetBSD termcap entry, correcting the ncv value.
# The emulator renders underlined text in red.  Colors are otherwise usable.
#
# Testing the emulator and reading the source code (NetBSD 2.0), it appears
# that "vt220" is inaccurate.  There are a few vt220-features, but most of the
# vt220 screens in vttest do not work with this emulator.  For instance, it
# identifies itself (primary DA response) as a vt220 with selective erase.  But
# the selective erase feature does not work.  The secondary response is copied
# from Kermit's emulation of vt220, does not correspond to actual vt220.  At
# the level of detail in a termcap, it is a passable emulator, since ECH does
# work.  Don't use it on a VMS system -TD

#### FreeBSD console entries
#
# From: Andrey Chernov <ache@astral.msk.su> 29 Mar 1996
# Andrey Chernov maintains the FreeBSD termcap distributions.
#
# Note: Users of FreeBSD 2.1.0 and older versions must either upgrade
# or comment out the :cb: capability in the console entry.
#
# Alexander Lukyanov reports:
# I have seen FreeBSD-2.1.5R... The old el1 bug changed, but it is still there.
# Now el1 clears not only to the line beginning, but also a large chunk
# of previous line. But there is another bug - ech does not work at all.
#

# for syscons
# common entry without semigraphics
# Bug: The <op> capability resets attributes.
# Bug? The ech and el1 attributes appear to move the cursor in some cases; for
# instance el1 does if the cursor is moved to the right margin first.  Removed
# by T.Dickey 97/5/3 (ech=\E[%p1%dX, el1=\E[1K)
#
# Setting colors turns off reverse; we cannot guarantee order, so use ncv.
# Note that this disables standout with color.
#
# The emulator sends difference strings based on shift- and control-keys,
# like scoansi:
#	F13-F24 are shifted F1-F12
#	F25-F36 are control F1-F12
#	F37-F48 are shift+control F1-F12

#### DEC VT52
# (<acsc>/<rmacs>/<smacs> capabilities aren't in DEC's official entry -- esr)
#
# Actually (TD pointed this out at the time the acsc string was added):
# vt52 shouldn't define full acsc since most of the cells don't match.
# see vt100 manual page A-31.  This is the list that does match:
#	f degree
#	g plus/minus
#	h right-arrow
#	k down-arrow
#	m scan-1
#	o scan-3
#	q scan-5
#	s scan-7
# The line-drawing happens to work in several terminal emulators, but should
# not be used as a guide to the capabilities of the vt52.  Note in particular
# that vt52 does not support line-drawing characters (the scan-X values refer
# to a crude plotting feature) -TD

#### DEC VT100 and compatibles
#
# DEC terminals from the vt100 forward are collected here. Older DEC terminals
# and micro consoles can be found in the `obsolete' section.  More details on
# the relationship between the VT100 and ANSI X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 may be
# found near the end of this file.
#
# Except where noted, these entries are DEC's official terminfos.
# Contact Bill Hedberg <hedberg@hannah.enet.dec.com> of Terminal Support
# Engineering for more information.  Updated terminfos and termcaps 
# are kept available at ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/termcaps.
#
# In October 1995 DEC sold its terminals business, including the VT and Dorio
# line and trademark, to SunRiver Data Systems.  SunRiver has since changed
# its name to Boundless Technologies; see http://www.boundless.com.
#

# NOTE:  Any VT100 emulation, whether in hardware or software, almost
# certainly includes what DEC called the `Level 1 editing extension' codes;
# only the very oldest VT100s lacked these and there probably aren't any of
# those left alive.  To capture these, use one of the VT102 entries.
#
# Note that the <xenl> glitch in vt100 is not quite the same as on the Concept,
# since the cursor is left in a different position while in the
# weird state (concept at beginning of next line, vt100 at end
# of this line) so all versions of vi before 3.7 don't handle
# <xenl> right on vt100. The correct way to handle <xenl> is when
# you output the char in column 80, immediately output CR LF
# and then assume you are in column 1 of the next line. If <xenl>
# is on, am should be on too.
# 
# I assume you have smooth scroll off or are at a slow enough baud
# rate that it doesn't matter (1200? or less). Also this assumes
# that you set auto-nl to "on", if you set it off use vt100-nam 
# below.
# 
# The padding requirements listed here are guesses. It is strongly
# recommended that xon/xoff be enabled, as this is assumed here.
# 
# The vt100 uses <rs2> and <rf> rather than <is2>/<tbc>/<hts> because the 
# tab settings are in non-volatile memory and don't need to be 
# reset upon login. Also setting the number of columns glitches 
# the screen annoyingly. You can type "reset" to get them set.
#
# The VT100 series terminals have cursor ("arrows") keys which can operate
# in two different modes: Cursor Mode and Application Mode.  Cursor Mode
# is the reset state, and is assumed to be the normal state.  Application
# Mode is the "set" state.  In Cursor Mode, the cursor keys transmit
# "Esc [ {code}" sequences, conforming to ANSI standards.  In Application
# Mode, the cursor keys transmit "Esc O <code>" sequences.  Application Mode
# was provided primarily as an aid to the porting of VT52 applications.  It is
# assumed that the cursor keys are normally in Cursor Mode, and expected that
# applications such as vi will always transmit the <smkx> string.  Therefore,
# the definitions for the cursor keys are made to match what the terminal
# transmits after the <smkx> string is transmitted.  If the <smkx> string
# is a null string or is not defined, then cursor keys are assumed to be in
# "Cursor Mode", and the cursor keys definitions should match that assumption,
# else the application may fail.  It is also expected that applications will
# always transmit the <rmkx> string to the terminal before they exit.
#
# The VT100 series terminals have an auxiliary keypad, commonly referred to as
# the "Numeric Keypad", because it is a cluster of numeric and function keys.
# The Numeric Keypad which can operate in two different modes: Numeric Mode and
# Application Mode.  Numeric Mode is the reset state, and is assumed to be
# the normal state.  Application Mode is the "set" state.  In Numeric Mode,
# the numeric and punctuation keys transmit ASCII 7-bit characters, and the 
# Enter key transmits the same as the Return key (Note: the Return key
# can be configured to send either LF (\015) or CR LF).  In Application Mode,
# all the keypad keys transmit "Esc O {code}" sequences.  The PF1 - PF4 keys
# always send the same "Esc O {code}" sequences.  It is assumed that the keypad
# is normally in Numeric Mode.  If an application requires that the keypad be
# in Application Mode then it is expected that the user, or the application,
# will set the TERM environment variable to point to a terminfo entry which has
# defined the <smkx> string to include the codes that switch the keypad into
# Application Mode, and the terminfo entry will also define function key
# fields to match the Application Mode control codes.  If the <smkx> string
# is a null string or is not defined, then the keypad is assumed to be in
# Numeric Mode.  If the <smkx> string switches the keypad into Application
# Mode, it is expected that the <rmkx> string will contain the control codes
# necessary to reset the keypad to "Normal" mode, and it is also expected that
# applications which transmit the <smkx> string will also always transmit the
# <rmkx> string to the terminal before they exit.
#
# Here's a diagram of the VT100 keypad keys with their bindings.
# The top line is the name of the key (some DEC keyboards have the keys
# labelled somewhat differently, like GOLD instead of PF1, but this is
# the most "official" name).  The second line is the escape sequence it
# generates in Application Keypad mode (where "$" means the ESC
# character).  The third line contains two items, first the mapping of
# the key in terminfo, and then in termcap.

# vt220 termcap written Tue Oct 25 20:41:10 1988 by Alex Latzko
# (not an official DEC entry!)
# The problem with real vt220 terminals is they don't send escapes when in
# in vt220 mode.  This can be gotten around two ways.  1> don't send
# escapes or 2> put the vt220 into vt100 mode and use all the nifty
# features of vt100 advanced video which it then has.
#
# This entry takes the view of putting a vt220 into vt100 mode so
# you can use the escape key in emacs and everything else which needs it.
#
# You probably don't want to use this on a VMS machine since VMS will think
# it has a vt220 and will get fouled up coming out of emacs

#   host writable status line, yet another different DRCS matrix size,
#   and such, but they add the DEC Technical character set, Multiple text
#   pages, selectable length pages, and the like.  The difference between
#   the vt330 and vt340 is that the latter has only 2 planes and a monochrome
#   monitor, the former has 4 planes and a color monitor.  These terminals
#   support VT131 and ANSI block mode, but as with much of these things,
#   termcap/terminfo doesn't deal with these features.
#
# Note that this entry is are set up in what was the standard way for GNU
# Emacs v18 terminal modes to deal with the cursor keys in that the arrow
# keys were switched into application mode at the same time the numeric pad
# is switched into application mode.  This changes the definitions of the
# arrow keys.  Emacs v19 is smarter and mines its keys directly out of 
# your termcap or terminfo entry,

# DEC doesn't supply a vt400 description, so we add Daniel Glasser's
# (originally written with vt420 as its primary name, and usable for it).
# 
# VT400/420 -- This terminal is a superset of the vt320.  It adds the multiple 
#    text pages and long text pages with selectable length of the vt340, along
#    with left and right margins, rectangular area text copy, fill, and erase
#    operations, selected region character attribute change operations,
#    page memory and rectangle checksums, insert/delete column, reception
#    macros, and other features too numerous to remember right now.  TERMCAP
#    can only take advantage of a few of these added features.
#
# Note that this entry is are set up in what was the standard way for GNU
# Emacs v18 terminal modes to deal with the cursor keys in that the arrow
# keys were switched into application mode at the same time the numeric pad
# is switched into application mode.  This changes the definitions of the
# arrow keys.  Emacs v19 is smarter and mines its keys directly out of 
# your termcap entry,

# DEC VT220 and up support DECUDK (user-defined keys).  DECUDK (i.e., pfx)
# takes two parameters, the key and the string.  Translating the key is
# straightforward (keys 1-5 are not defined on real terminals, though some
# emulators define these):
#
#               if (key < 16) then  value = key;
#               else if (key < 21) then value = key + 1; 
#               else if (key < 25) then value = key + 2;
#               else if (key < 27) then value = key + 3;
#               else if (key < 30) then value = key + 4;
#               else value = key + 5;
#
# The string must be the hexadecimal equivalent, e.g., "5052494E" for "PRINT". 
# There's no provision in terminfo for emitting a string in this format, so the
# application has to know it.

#
# The VT520 is a monochrome text terminal capable of managing up to
# four independent sessions in the terminal.  It has multiple ANSI
# emulations (VT520, VT420, VT320, VT220, VT100, VT PCTerm, SCO Console)
# and ASCII emulations (WY160/60, PCTerm, 50/50+, 150/120, TVI 950,
# 925 910+, ADDS A2).  This terminfo data is for the ANSI emulations only.
#
# Terminal Set-Up is entered by pressing [F3], [Caps Lock]/[F3] or
# [Alt]/[Print Screen] depending upon which keyboard and which
# terminal mode is being used.  If Set-Up has been disabled or
# assigned to an unknown key, Set-Up may be entered by pressing
# [F3] as the first key after power up, regardless of keyboard type.

# This emulates vt100 + vt52 (plus a few vt220 features:  ech, SRM, DECTCEM, as
# well as SCO and Atari, color palettes from Linux console).  Reading the code,
# it is intended to be VT102 plus selected features.  By default, it sets $TERM
# to xterm, which is incorrect, since several features are misimplemented:
#
#	Alt+key always sends ESC+key, so 'km' capability is removed.
#
#	Control responses, wrapping and tabs are buggy, failing a couple of
#	screens in vttest.
#
#	xterm mouse support is not implemented (unrelease version may).
#
# Several features such as backspace/delete are optional; this entry documents

# This entry is for Tera Term Pro version 2.3, for MS-Windows 95/NT written by
# T. Teranishi dated Mar 10, 1998.  It is a free software terminal emulator
# (communication program) which supports:
#
#	- Serial port connections.
#	- TCP/IP (telnet) connections.
#	- VT100 emulation, and selected VT200/300 emulation.
#	- TEK4010 emulation.
#	- File transfer protocols (Kermit, XMODEM, ZMODEM, B-PLUS and
#	  Quick-VAN).
#	- Scripts using the "Tera Term Language".
#	- Japanese and Russian character sets.
#
# The program does not come with terminfo or termcap entries.  However, the
# emulation (testing with vttest and ncurses) is reasonably close to vt100 (no
# vt52 or doublesize character support; blinking is done with color).  Besides
# the HPA, VPA extensions it also implements CPL and CNL.
#
# All of the function keys can be remapped.  This description shows the default
# mapping, as installed.  Both vt100 PF1-PF4 keys and quasi-vt220 F1-F4 keys
# are supported.  F13-F20 are obtained by shifting F3-F10.  The editing keypad
# is laid out like vt220, rather than the face codes on the PC keyboard, i.e,
#	kfnd	Insert
#	kslt	Delete
#	kich1	Home
#	kdch1	PageUp
#	kpp	End
#	knp	PageDown
#
# ANSI colors are implemented, but cannot be combined with video attributes
# except for reverse.
#
# No fonts are supplied with the program, so the acsc string is chosen to
# correspond with the default Microsoft terminal font.
#
# Tera Term recognizes some xterm sequences, including those for setting and
# retrieving the window title, and for setting the window size (i.e., using
# "resize -s"), though it does not pass SIGWINCH to the application if the
# user resizes the window with the mouse.

# Tested with WinNT 4.0, the telnet application assumes the screensize is
# 25x80.  This entry uses the 'Terminal' font, to get line-drawing characters.
#
# Other notes:
# a) Fails tack's cup (cursor-addressing) test, though cup works well enough
#    for casual (occasional) use.  Also fails several of the vttest screens,
#    but that is not unusual for vt100 "emulators".
# b) Does not implement vt100 keypad
# c) Recognizes a subset of vt52 controls.

# Konsole 1.0.1
# (formerly known as kvt)
#
# This program hardcodes $TERM to 'xterm', which is not accurate.  However, to
# simplify this entry (and point out why konsole isn't xterm), we base this on
# xterm-r6.  The default keyboard appears to be 'linux'.
#
# Notes:
# a) konsole implements several features from XFree86 xterm, though none of
#    that is documented - except of course in its source code - apparently
#    because its implementors are unaccustomed to reading documentation - as
#    evidenced by the sparse and poorly edited documentation distributed with
#    konsole.  Some features such as the 1049 private mode are recognized but
#    incorrectly implemented as a duplicate of the 47 private mode.
# b) even with the "vt100 (historical)" keyboard setting, the numeric keypad
#    sends PC-style escapes rather than vt100.
# c) fails vttest menu 3 (Test of character sets) because it does not properly
#    parse some control sequences.  Also fails vttest Primary Device Attributes
#    by sending a bogus code (in the source it says it's supposed to be a
#    vt220, which is doubly incorrect because it does not implement vt220
#    control sequences except for a few special cases).  Treat it as a
#    mildly-broken vt102.
#
# Update for konsole 1.3.2:
#    The 1049 private mode works (but see the other xterm screens in vttest).
#    Primary Device Attributes now returns the code for a vt100 with advanced
#    video option.  Perhaps that's intended to be a "mildly-broken vt102".

# indicate that it emulates more than one terminal, but incompletely.
# 
# This is adapted from a FreeBSD bug-report by Daniel Rudy <dcrudy@pacbell.net>
# It is based on vt102's entry, with some subtle differences, but also
#	has status line
#	supports ANSI colors (except for 'op' string)
#	apparently implements alternate screen like xterm
#	does not use padding, of course.

# Notes:
# (a)	screen does not support invis.
# (b)	screen's implementation of bw is incorrect according to tack.
# (c)	screen appears to hardcode the strings for khome/kend, making it

# (d)	screen sets $TERMCAP to a termcap-formatted copy of the 'screen' entry,
#	which is NOT the same as the terminfo screen.<term>.
# (e)	when screen finds one of these customized entries, it sets $TERM to
#	match.  Hence, no "screen.xterm" entry is provided, since that would
#	create heartburn for people running remote xterm's.

#	xterm (-xfree86 or -r6) does not normally support kIC, kNXT and kPRV

# NCSA telnet is one of the most used telnet clients for the Macintosh.  It has
# been maintained until recently by the National Center for Supercomputer
# Applications, and it is feature rich, stable and free.  It can be downloaded
# from www.ncsa.edu.  This terminfo description file is based on xterm-vt220,
# xterm+sl, and the docs at NCSA.  It works well.
#
# NCSA Telnet 2.6 for Macintosh in vt220 8-bit emulation mode
# The terminal options should be set as follows:
#         Xterm sequences ON
#         use VT wrap mode ON
#         use Emacs arrow keys OFF
#         CTRL-COMND is Emacs meta ON
#         8 bit mode ON
#         answerback string: "ncsa-vt220-8"
#         setup keys: all disabled
#
# Application mode is not used.
#
# Other special mappings:
#	Apple		VT220
#	HELP 		Find
#	HOME		Insert here
#	PAGEUP		Remove
#	DEL		Select
#	END		Prev Screen
#	PAGEDOWN	Next Screen
#
# Though it supports ANSI color, NCSA Telnet uses color to represent blinking
# text.
#
# The status-line manipulation is a mapping of the xterm-compatible control
# sequences for setting the window-title.  So you must use tsl and fsl in
# pairs, since the latter ends the string that is loaded to the window-title.

# adapted from the stock ELKS termcap. The project itself looks stalled,

#
# To cope with the ELKS dumb console I added an "elks-glasstty" entry;

# This entry fits the Windows NT console when the _POSIX_TERM environment
# variable is set to 'on'.  While the Windows NT POSIX console is seldom used,
# the Telnet client supplied with both the Windows for WorkGroup 3.11 TCP/IP
# stack and the Win32 (i.e., Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.1 or later) operating
# systems is not, and (surprise!) they match very well.
#
# See:  MS Knowledge Base item Q108581, dated 13-MAY-1997, titled "Setting Up
# VI POSIX Editor for Windows NT 3.1".  True to Microsoft form, not only
# are the installation instructions a pile of mind-numbing bureaucratese,
# but the termcap entry is actually broken and unusable as given; the :do:
# capability is misspelled "d".
#
# To use this, you need to a bunch of environment variables: 
#
# SET _POSIX_TERM=on
# SET TERM=ansi
# SET TERMCAP=location of termcap file in POSIX file format
# which is case-sensitive.
# e.g. SET TERMCAP=//D/RESKIT35/posix/termcap
# SET TMP=//C/TEMP
#
# Important note: setting the TMP environment variable in POSIX style renders
# it incompatible with a lot of other applications, including Visual C++. So
# you should have a separate command window just for vi. All the other
# variables may be permanently set in the Control Panel\System applet. 
#
# You can find out more about the restrictions of this facility at
# <http://www.nentug.org/unix-to-nt/ntposix.htm>.

######## COMMON TERMINAL TYPES
#
# This section describes terminal classes and maker brands that are still
# quite common, but have proprietary command sets not blessed by ANSI.
#

#### Altos
#
# Altos made a moderately successful line of UNIX boxes.  In 1990 they were
# bought out by Acer, a major Taiwanese manufacturer of PC-clones.
# Acer has a web site at http://www.acer.com.
#
# Altos descriptions from Ted Mittelstaedt <tedm@agora.rain.com> 4 Sep 1993
# His comments suggest they were shipped with the system.

# Note: there are newer ROMs for 2621's that allow you to set 
# strap A so the regular arrow keys xmit \EA, etc, as with the

# xmitting if you reset it, until you unset and reset the strap!
# Since there is no way to set/unset the strap with an escape 
# sequence, we don't use it in the default.

#### Lear-Siegler (adm)
#
# These guys are long since out of the terminals business, but
# in 1995 many current terminals still have an adm type as one of their
# emulations (usually their stupidest, and usually labeled adm3, though
# these `adm3' emulations normally have adm3a+ capabilities).
#
# WARNING: Some early ADM terminals (including the ADM3 and ADM5) had a 
# `diagnostic feature' that sending them a ^G while pin 22 (`Ring Indicator')
# was being held to ground would trigger a send of the top line on the screen.
# A quick fix might be to drop back to a cheesy 4-wire cable with pin 22
# hanging in the air. (Thanks to Eric Fischer, <eric@fudge.uchicago.edu>,
# for clearing up this point.)

# You will need to get into the supervisor setup before you can set
# baudrate etc. for your ADM-12+. Press Shift-Ctrl-Setup and you should
# see a lot more setup options.
# 
# While in supervisor setup you can also use following codes:
# 
# Ctrl-P Personality character selections (configure for example what
#        arrow keys send, if I recall correctly)
# Ctrl-T tabs 1-80   use left&right to move and up to set and
# Ctrl-V tabs 81-158 down to clear tab. Shift-Ctrl-M sets right margin at cursor
# Ctrl-B Binary setup (probably not needed. I think that everything can
#        be set using normal setup)
# Ctrl-A Answerback mode (enter answerback message)
# Ctrl-U User friendly mode (normal setup)
# Ctrl-D Defaults entire setup and function keys from EPROM tables
# Ctrl-S Save both setup and functions keys. Takes from 6 to 10 seconds.
# Ctrl-R Reads both setup and functions keys from NVM.
# Shift-Ctrl-X Unlock keyboard and cancel received X-OFF status
# 
# ADM-12+ supports hardware handshaking, but it is DTR/CTS as opposed to
# RTS/CTS used nowadays with virtually every modem and computer. 19200
# bps works fine with hardware flow control.
# 
# The following null-modem cable should fix this and enable you to use
# RTS/CTS handshaking (which Linux supports, use CRTSCTS setting). Also
# set ADM-12+ for DTR handshaking from supervisor setup.

# Qume was bought by Wyse, but still (as of early 1995) has its own support
# group and production division.
#
# Discontinued Qume models:
#
# The qvt101 and qvt102 listed here are long obsolete; so is the qvt101+
# built to replace them, and a qvt119+ which was a 101+ with available wide
# mode (132 columns).  There was a qvt103 which added vt100/vt131 emulations
# and an ANSI-compatible qvt203 that replaced it.  Qume started producing
# ANSI-compatible terminals with the qvt323 and qvt61.
#
# Current Qume models (as of February 1995):
#
# All current Qume terminals have ANSI-compatible operation modes.
# Qume is still producing the qvt62, which features emulations for other
# popular lines such as ADDS, and dual-host capabilities.  The qvt82 is
# designed for use as a SCO ANSI terminal.  The qvt70 is a color terminal
# with many emulations including Wyse370, Wyse 325, etc.  Their newest
# model is the qvt520, which is vt420-compatible.
#
# There are some ancient printing Qume terminals under `Daisy Wheel Printers'
#
# If you inherit a Qume without docs, try Ctrl-Shift-Setup to enter its
# setup mode.  Shift-s should be a configuration save to NVRAM.

# tvi{912,920}[bc] - TeleVideo TVI-912B/TVI-920B and TVI-912C/TVI-920C
# From: Benjamin C. W. Sittler
#
# Someone has put a scanned copy of the manual online at:
#     http://vt100.net/televideo/912b-om/
#
# These terminals were produced ca. 1979, and had a 12" monochrome
# screen, supported 75-9600 baud (no handshaking), monochrome, 7-bit
# ASCII, and were generally similar to adm3a but with attributes
# (including some with magic cookies), fancy half-duplex mode, and
# different bugs.
#
# Some operations reqire truly incredible amounts of padding. The
# insert_line (<il1>) and delete_line (<dl1>) operations in particular
# are so slow as to be nearly unusable.
#
# There may or may not have been a separate, earlier series of 912/920
# terminals (without the "B" and "C" suffix); I have never seen one,
# and the manual only describes the "B" and "C" series. The 912 and 920
# are quite distinct from the 914 and 924, which were much nicer non-
# magic-cookie terminals similar to the 950.
#
# This is a new description for the following TeleVideo terminals,
# distinguished chiefly by their keyboards:
#
#   TVI-912B - very odd layout, no function keys (84 keys)
#   TVI-920B - typewriter layout, no function keys (103 keys)
#   TVI-912C - very odd layout, function keys F1-F11 (82 keys)
#   TVI-920C - typewriter layout, function keys F1-F11 (101 keys)
#
# To choose a setting for the TERM variable, start with the model:
#
#    Model  || base name
# ----------||-----------
#  TVI-912B || tvi912b
#  TVI-912C || tvi912c
#  TVI-920B || tvi920b
#  TVI-920C || tvi920c
#
# Then add a suffix from the following table describing installed options
# and how you'd like to use the terminal:
#
#   Use Video | Second | Visual |  Magic  |  Page || feature
#  Attributes |  Page  |  Bell  | Cookies | Print || suffix
# ------------|--------|--------|---------|-------||---------
#      No     |   No   |  N/A   |   N/A   |   No  || -unk
#      No     |   No   |  N/A   |   N/A   |  Yes  || -p
#      No     |  Yes   |   No   |   N/A   |   No  || -2p-unk
#      No     |  Yes   |   No   |   N/A   |  Yes  || -2p-p
#      No     |  Yes   |  Yes   |   N/A   |   No  || -vb-unk
#      No     |  Yes   |  Yes   |   N/A   |  Yes  || -vb-p
#     Yes     |   No   |  N/A   |    No   |  N/A  ||
#     Yes     |   No   |  N/A   |   Yes   |  N/A  || -mc
#     Yes     |  Yes   |   No   |    No   |  N/A  || -2p
#     Yes     |  Yes   |   No   |   Yes   |  N/A  || -2p-mc
#     Yes     |  Yes   |  Yes   |    No   |  N/A  || -vb
#     Yes     |  Yes   |  Yes   |   Yes   |  N/A  || -vb-mc
#
# So e.g. a model 920 C with second page memory option, visual bell
# and no magic cookies would be tvi920c-vb; a model 912 B without the
# second page memory option and using magic cookies would be
# tvi912b-mc
#
# PADDING
#
# At 9600 baud, the terminal is prone to overflow its input buffer
# during complex operations (insert/delete
# character/line/screen/page), and it does not signal this over the
# RS232 cable. The typical symptom of an overrun is that the terminal
# starts beeping, and output becomes garbled.
#
# The padding delays in this terminfo were derived using tack(1)
# running on a Linux box connected to a TVI-920C with a later-model
# (A49C1-style) ROM running at 9600 baud, so your mileage may
# vary. The numbers below seem to give the terminal enough time so
# that it doesn't overflow its input buffer and start losing
# characters.
#
# KEYS
#
# If you want to use the FUNCT key on a tvi912[bc], use the
# corresponding tvi920[bc] terminfo with FUNCT + ... equivalents from
# the following table (these also work on the 920 series):
#
# Unshifted Function Keys:
#
#  Key | capname|| Equivalent
# -----|--------||------------
#   F1 |  <kf1> || FUNCT + @
#   F2 |  <kf2> || FUNCT + A
#   F3 |  <kf3> || FUNCT + B
#   F4 |  <kf4> || FUNCT + C
#   F5 |  <kf5> || FUNCT + D
#   F6 |  <kf6> || FUNCT + E
#   F7 |  <kf7> || FUNCT + F
#   F8 |  <kf8> || FUNCT + G
#   F9 |  <kf9> || FUNCT + H
#  F10 | <kf10> || FUNCT + I
#  F11 | <kf11> || FUNCT + J
#
# Shifted Function Keys:
#
#  SHIFT + Key | capname|| Equivalent
# -------------|--------||------------
#   SHIFT + F1 | <kf12> || FUNCT + `
#   SHIFT + F2 | <kf13> || FUNCT + a
#   SHIFT + F3 | <kf14> || FUNCT + b
#   SHIFT + F4 | <kf15> || FUNCT + c

# 		installed, Extension Mode is selected.
#
# NON-STANDARD CAPABILITIES
#
# Sending <u9> or <u7> returns a cursor position report in the format
# YX\r, where Y and X are as in <cup>. This format is described in
# <u8> and <u6>, but it's not clear how one should write an
# appropriate scanf string, since we need to subtract %' ' from the
# character after reading it. The <u9> capability is used by tack(1)
# to synchronize during padding tests, and seems to work for that
# purpose.
#
# This description also includes the obsolete termcap capabilities
# has_hardware_tabs (<OTpt>) and backspaces_with_bs (<OTbs>).
#
# FEATURES NOT YET DESCRIBED IN THIS TERMINFO
#
# The FUNCT modifier actually works with every normal key by sending
# ^AX\r, where X is the sequence normally sent by that key. This is a
# sort of meta key not currently describable in terminfo.
#
# There are quite a few other keys (especially on the 920 models,) but
# they are for the most part only useful in block mode.
#
# These terminals have lots of forms manipulation features, mainly
# useful in block mode, including "clear X to nulls" (vs. "clear X to
# spaces"; nulls are sentinels for "send X" operations); "send X"
# operations for uploading all or part of the screen; and block-mode
# editing keys (they don't send escape sequences, but manipulate video
# memory directly). Block mode is used for local editing, and protect
# mode (in conjunction with the "write protect" attribute,
# a.k.a. half-intensity outside of protect mode) is used to control
# which parts of the screen are edited/sent/printed (by <mc0>).
#
# There are at least two major families of ROM, "early" and
# A49B1/A49C1; the major difference seems to be that the latter ROMs
# support a few extra escape sequences for manipulating the off-screen
# memory page, and for sending whole pages back to the host (mainly
# useful in block mode.) The descriptions in this file don't use any
# of those sequences: set cursor position including page (\E-PYX,
# where P is \s for page 0 and ! for page 1 [actually only the LSB of
# P is taken into account, so e.g. 0 and 1 work too,] and Y and X are
# as in <cup>); read cursor position (\E/), which is analogous to <u9>
# and returns PYX\r, where P is \s for page 0 or ! for page 1, and YX
# are as in <cup>, and some "send page" features mainly useful for
# forms manipulation.
#
# The keyboard enable (\E") and disable (\E#) sequences are unused,
# except that a terminal reset (<is2>) enables the keyboard.
#
# Auto-flip mode (\Ev) is likely faster than the scrolling mode (\Ew)
# enabled in <is2>, but auto-flip is very jarring so we don't use it.
#
# BUGS
#
# At least up to the A49B1 and A49C1 ROMs, there are no \Eb and \Ed
# sequences (I infer that in some TeleVideo terminal they may invert
# and uninvert the display) so the <flash> sequence given here is a
# cheesy page-flip instead.
#
# The back_tab (<cbt>) sequence (\EI) doesn't work according to

# Visual 50 from Beau Shekita, BTL-Whippany <whuxlb!ejs>
# Recently I hacked together the following termcap for Visual
# Technology's Visual 50 terminal. It's a slight modification of
# the vt52 termcap. 
# It's intended to run when the Visual 50 is in vt52 emulation mode
# (I know what you're thinking; if it's emulating a vt52, then why
# another termcap? Well, it turns out that the Visual 50 can handle
# <dl1> and db(?) among other things, which the vt52 can't)
# The termcap works OK for the most part. The only problem is on
# character inserts. The whole line gets painfully redrawn for each
# character typed. Any suggestions?
# Beau's entry is combined with the vi50 entry from University of Wisconsin.
# Note especially the <il1> function.  <kf4>-<kf6> are really l4-l6 in
# disguise; <kf7>-<kf9> are really l1-l3.

#
#	The Wyse 350 is a Wyse 50 with color.
#	Unfortunately this means that it has magic cookies.
#	The color attributes are designed to overlap the reverse, dim and
#	underline attributes.  This is nice for monochrome applications
#	because you can make underline stuff green (or any other color)
#	but for true color applications it's not so hot because you cannot
#	mix color with reverse, dim or underline.
#	    To further complicate things one of the attributes must be
#	black (either the foreground or the background).  In reverse video
#	the background changes color with black letters.  In normal video
#	the foreground changes colors on a black background.  
#	    This terminfo uses some of the more advanced features of curses
#	to display both color and blink.  In the final analysis I am not
#	sure that the wy350 runs better with this terminfo than it does
#	with the wy50 terminfo (with user adjusted colors).
#
#	The mandatory pause used by flash does not work with
#	older versions of terminfo.  If you see this effect then
#	unset xon and delete the / from the delay.
#	i.e. change $<100/> to $<100>
#
# Bug: The <op> capability resets attributes.

#	The Wyse 60 is like the Wyse 50 but with more padding.
#	The reset strings are slow and the pad times very depending
#	on other parameters such as font loading.  I have tried
#	to follow the following outline:
#
#		<rs1> -> set personality
#		<rs2> -> set number of columns
#		<rs3> -> set number of lines
#		<is1> -> select the proper font
#		<is2> -> do the initialization
#		<is3> -> set up display memory (2 pages)
#
#	The Wyse 60's that have vt100 emulation are slower than the
#	older Wyse 60's.  This change happened mid-1987.
#	The capabilities effected are <dch1> <dl1> <il1> <ind> <ri>
#
#	The meta key is only half right.  This terminal will return the
#	high order bit set when you hit CTRL-function_key
#
#	It may be useful to assign two function keys with the
#	values  \E=(\s  look at old data in page 1
#	        \E=W,   look at bottom of page 1
#	where \s is a space ( ).
#
#	Note:
#	   The Wyse 60 runs faster when the XON/XOFF
#	   handshake is turned off.
#
# (wy60: we use \E{ rather than ^^ for home (both are documented) to avoid
# a bug reported by Robert Dunn, <rcdii@inlink.com> -- esr)

# Can't set tabs! Other bugs (ANSI mode only):
# - can't redefine function keys (anyway, key redefinition in ANSI mode
#   is too much complex to be described);
# - meta key can't be described (the terminal forgets it when reset);
# The xon-xoff handshaking can't be disabled while in ansi personality, so
# emacs can't work at speed greater than 9600 baud.  No padding is needed at
# this speed.
#   dch1 has been commented out because it causes annoying glittering when
# vi deletes one character at the beginning of a line with tabs in it.
#   dch makes sysgen(1M) have a horrible behaviour when deleting
# a screen and makes screen(1) behave badly, so it is disabled too. The nice
# thing is that vi goes crazy if smir-rmir are present and both dch-dch1 are
# not, so smir and rmir are commented out as well.

# This terminal (firmware version 02) has a lot of bugs:
# - can't set tabs;
# - other bugs in ANSI modes (see above).
# This description disables handshaking when using cup. This is because
# GNU emacs doesn't like Xon-Xoff handshaking. This means the terminal
# cannot be used at speeds greater than 9600 baud, because at greater
# speeds handshaking is needed even for character sending. If you use
# DTR handshaking, you can use even greater speeds.

#
#	The Wyse 160 is combination of the WY-60 and the WY-99gt.
#	The reset strings are slow and the pad times very depending
#	on other parameters such as font loading.  I have tried
#	to follow the following outline:
#
#		<rs1> -> set personality
#		<rs2> -> set number of columns
#		<rs3> -> set number of lines
#		<is1> -> select the proper font
#		<is2> -> do the initialization
#		<is3> -> set up display memory (2 pages)
#
#	The display memory may be used for either text or graphics.
#	When "Display Memory = Shared" the terminal will have more pages
#	but garbage may be left on the screen when you switch from
#	graphics to text.  If "Display Memory = Unshared" then the
#	text area will be only one page long.
#
# (wy160: we use \E{ rather than ^^ for home (both are documented) to avoid
# a bug reported by Robert Dunn, <rcdii@inlink.com> -- esr)

#	   The Wyse 75 can support one attribute (e.g. Dim, Inverse,

#	uses this capability, but when more than one attribute is
#	put on the screen at once, all attributes will be changed

#TITLE:  TERMINFO ENTRY WY520
#DATE:   8/5/93
# The WY520 terminfo is based on the WY285 entry published on the WYSE 
# BBS with the addition of more function keys and special keys.
#
#               rs1 -> set personality
#               rs2 -> set number of columns
#               rs3 -> set number of lines
#               is1 -> select the proper font
#               is2 -> do the initialization
#               is3 -> If this string is empty then rs3 gets sent.
#
#       Wyse 520 emulating a vt420 7 bit mode with default ANSI keyboard
#       - The BS key is programmed to generate BS in smcup since
#         is2 doesn't seem to work.
#       - Remove and shift/Remove: delete a character
#       - Insert : enter insert mode
#       - Find   : delete to end of file
#       - Select : clear a line
#       - F11, F12, F13: send default sequences (not ESC, BS, LF)
#       - F14 : Home key
#       - Bottom status line (host writable line) is used.
#       - smkx,rmkx are removed because this would put the numeric
#         keypad in Dec application mode which doesn't seem to work
#         with SCO applications.

######## NON-ANSI TERMINAL EMULATIONS
#

#### Avatar
#
# These entries attempt to describe Avatar, a terminal emulation used with
# MS-DOS bulletin-board systems.  It was designed to give ANSI-like
# capabilities, but with cheaper (shorter) control sequences.  Messy design,
# excessively dependent on PC idiosyncracies, but apparently rather popular
# in the BBS world.
#
# No color support.  Avatar doesn't fit either of the Tektronix or HP color
# models that terminfo knows about.  An Avatar color attribute is the
# low 7 bits of the IBM-PC display-memory attribute.  Bletch.
#
# I wrote these entries while looking at the Avatar spec.  I don't have
# the facilities to test them.  Let me know if they work, or don't.
#
# Avatar escapes not used by these entries (because maybe you're smarter
# and more motivated than I am and can figure out how to wrap terminfo
# around some of them, and because they are weird enough to be funny):
#				level 0:
# ^L		-- clear window/reset current attribute to default
# ^V^A%p1%c	-- set current color attribute, parameter decodes as follows:
# 
#      bit:         6   5   4   3   2   1   0
#                   |       |   |   |       |
#                   +---+---+   |   +---+---+
#                       |       |       |
#                       |       |  foreground color
#                       |  foreground intensity
#                  background color
#				level 0+:
# ^V^J%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c%p4%c%p5%c	-- scroll (p2,p3) to (p4,p5) up by p1 lines
# ^V^K%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c%p4%c%p5%c	-- scroll (p2,p3) to (p4,p5) down by p1 lines
# ^V^L%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c		-- clear p2 lines and p3 cols w/attr %p1 
# ^V^M%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c%p4%c	-- fill p3 lines & p4 cols w/char p2+attr %p1 
# (^V^L and ^V^M set the current attribute as a side-effect.)
# ^V ^Y <a> [...] <c>	-- repeat pattern. <a> specifies the number of bytes
#			   in the pattern, <c> the number of times the pattern
#		  	   should be repeated. If either value is 0, no-op.
#			   The pattern can contain Avatar console codes,
#			   including other ^V ^Y patterns.
#				level 1:
# ^V^O		-- clockwise mode on; turn print direction right each time you
#		   hit a window edge (yes, really).  Turned off by CR
# ^V^P		-- no-op
# ^V^Q%c	-- query the driver
# ^V^R		-- driver reset
# ^V^S		-- Sound tone (PC-specific)
# ^V^T			-- change highlight at current cursor poition to %c
# ^V^U%p1%c%p2%c	-- highlight window <a> with attribute <b>
# ^V^V%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c%p4%c%p5%c
#			-- define window 
#

# (The <blink>/<bold>/<rev>/<smacs>/<smul>/<smso> capabilities exist only to
# tell ncurses that the corresponding highlights exist; it should use <sgr>,
# which is the only method that will actually work for multiple highlights.)
#
# Update by TD - 2004: half of this was inconsistent.  Found documentation
# and repaired most of the damage.  sgr0 is probably incorrect, but the
# available documentation gives no clues for a workable string.

#
# Matrix Orbital 20x4 LCD display
# Command Character is 0xFE (decimal 254, octal 376)
#
# On this device, cursor addressability isn't possible.  The LCD expects:
#      0xfe G <col> <row> 
#      for cup: %p1 == row and %p2 is column
#
# This line:
#	cup=\376G%p2%c%p1%c
# LOOKS like it will work, but sometimes only one of the two numbers is sent. 
# See the terminfo (5) manpage commented regarding 'Terminals which use "%c"'.
# 
# Alas, there is no cursor upline capability on this display.
#
# These entries add some 'sanity stuff' to the clear function.  That is, it
# does a 'clear' and also turns OFF auto scroll, turns ON Auto Line Wrapping,
# and turns off the cursor blinking and stuff like that.
#
# NOTE: calling 'beep' turns on the backlight (bell)
# NOTE: calling 'flash' turns it on and back off (visual bell)

# 
# Teletype Model 5420 -- A souped up 5410, with multiple windows,
# even! the 5420 has three modes: scroll, window or page mode
# this terminfo should work in scroll or window mode, but doesn't
# take advantage of any of the differences between them.
#
# Has memory below (2 lines!)
# 3 pages of memory (plus some spare)
# The 5410 sequences for <cup>, <cvvis>, <dch>, <dl>, <ech>, <flash>, <home>,
# <hpa>, <hts> would work for these, but these work in both scroll and window
# mode... Unset insert character so insert mode works
# <is1> sets 80 column mode,
# <is2> escape sequence:
# 1) turn off all fonts
# 2) function keys off, keyboard lock off, control display off,
#    insert mode off, erasure mode off,
# 3) full duplex, monitor mode off, send graphics off, nl on lf off
# 4) reset origin mode
# 5) set line wraparound
# 6) exit erasure mode, positional attribute mode, and erasure extent mode
# 7) clear margins
# 8) program ENTER to transmit ^J,
# We use \212 to program the ^J because a bare ^J will get translated by
# UNIX into a CR/LF. The enter key is needed for AT&T uOMS.
#     1      2            3              4     5     6    7  8
# <is3> set screen color to black,
# No representation in terminfo for the delete word key: kdw1=\Ed
# Key capabilities assume the power-up send sequence...
# This <rmcup> is not strictly necessary, but it helps maximize 
# memory usefulness: <rmcup=\Ez>,

# This is the att700 entry for 700 native emulation of the AT&T 700
# terminal.  Comments are relative to changes from the 605V2 entry and
# att730 on which the entry is based.  Comments show the terminfo
# capability name, termcap name, and description.
#
# Here is what's going onm in the init string:
#	ESC [ 50;4|	set 700 native mode (really is 605)
# x	ESC [ 56;ps| 	set lines to 24: ps=0; 40: ps=1 (plus status line)
#	ESC [ 53;0|	set GenFlow to Xon/Xoff
#	ESC [ 8 ;0|	set CR on NL 
# x	ESC [ ? 3 l/h	set workspace: 80 col(l); 132 col(h)
#	ESC [ ? 4 l	jump scroll 
#	ESC [ ? 5 l/h	video: normal (l); reverse (h)
#	ESC [ ?13 l	Labels on
#	ESC [ ?15 l	parity check = no
#	ESC [ 13 l	monitor mode off
#	ESC [ 20 l	LF on NL (not CRLF on NL)
#	ESC [ ? 7 h	autowrap on
#	ESC [ 12 h	local echo off
#	ESC ( B		GO = ASCII
#	ESC ) 0		G1 = Special Char & Line Drawing
#	ESC [ ? 31 l	Set 7 bit controls
#
# Note: Most terminals, especially the 600 family use Reverse Video for
# standout mode.  DEC also uses reverse video.  The VT100 uses bold in addition
# Assume we should stay with reverse video for 70..  However, the 605V2 exits
# standout mode with \E[m (all normal attributes).  The 730 entry simply
# exits reverse video which would leave other current attributes intact.  It
# was assumed the 730 entry to be more correct so rmso has changed.  The
# 605V2 has no sequences to turn individual attributes off, thus its setting
# and the rmso/smso settings from the 730.
#
# Note: For the same reason as above in rmso I changed exit under-score mode
# to specifically turn off underscore, rather than return to all normal 
# attributes
#
# Note: The following pkey_xmit is taken from the 605V2 which contained the
# capability as pfxl.  It was changed here to pfx since pfxl
# will only compile successfully with Unix 4.0 tic.  Also note that pfx only
# allows strings to be parameters and label values must be programmed as
# constant strings.  Supposedly the pfxl of Version 4.0 allows both labels
# and strings to be parameters.  The 605V2 pfx entry should be examined later
# in this regard. For reference the 730 pfxl entry is shown here for comparison
# 730 pfx entry:

#### Ann Arbor (aa)
#
# Ann Arbor made dream terminals for hackers -- large screen sizes and huge
# numbers of function keys.  At least some used monitors in portrait mode,
# allowing up to 76-character screen heights!  They were reachable at:
#
#	Ann Arbor Terminals
#	6175 Jackson Road
#	Ann Arbor, MI 48103
#	(313)-663-8000
#
# But in 1996 the phone number reaches some kitschy retail shop, and Ann Arbor
# can't be found on the Web; I fear they're long dead.  R.I.P.
#


# Originally from Mike O'Brien@Rand and Howard Katseff at Bell Labs.
# Highly modified 6/22 by Mike O'Brien.
# split out into several for the various screen sizes by dave-yost@rand
# Modifications made 3/82 by Mark Horton
# Modified by Tom Quarles at UCB for greater efficiency and more diversity
# status line moved to top of screen, <flash> removed 5/82
# Some unknown person at SCO then hacked the init strings to make them more
# efficient.
#
# assumes the following setup:
#   A menu: 0000 1010  0001 0000

#### Applied Digital Data Systems (adds)
#
# ADDS itself is long gone.  ADDS was bought by NCR, and the same group made
# ADDS and NCR terminals.  When AT&T and NCR merged, the engineering for
# terminals was merged again.  Then AT&T sold the terminal business to
# SunRiver, which later changed its  name to Boundless Technologies.  The
# engineers from Teletype, AT&T terminals, ADDS, and NCR (who are still there
# as of early 1995) are at:
#
#	Boundless Technologies
#	100 Marcus Boulevard
#	Hauppauge, NY 11788-3762
#	Vox: (800)-231-5445
#	Fax: (516)-342-7378
#	Web: http://boundless.com
#
# Their voice mail used to describe the place as "SunRiver (formerly ADDS)". 
# In 1995 Boundless acquired DEC's terminals business.

# From: David S. Lawyer, June 1997:
# The CIT 101-e was made in Japan in 1983-4 and imported by CIE
# Terminals in Irvine, CA.  It was part of CITOH Electronics.  In the
# late 1980's CIT Terminals went out of business.
# There is no need to use the initialization string is=... (by invoking
# tset or setterm etc.) provided that the terminal has been manually set
# up (and the setup saved with ^S) to be compatible with this termcap.  To be
# compatible it should be in ANSI mode (not VT52).   A set-up that
# works is to set all the manually setable stuff to factory defaults
# by pressing ^D in set-up mode.  Then increse the brighness with the
# up-arrow key since the factory default will likely be dim on an old
# terminal.  Then change any options you want (provided that they are
# compatible with the termcap).  For my terminal I set: Screen
# Background: light; Keyclicks: silent; Auto wraparound: on; CRT saver:
# on.  I also set up mine for parity (but you may not need it).  Then 
# save the setup with ^S.
# (cit101e-rv: added empty <rmcup> to suppress a tic warning. --esr)

#### Getronics
#
# Getronics is a Dutch electronics company that at one time was called 
# `Geveke' and made async terminals; but (according to the company itself!)
# they've lost all their documentation on the command set.  The hardware
# documentation suggests the terminals were actually manufactured by a
# Taiwanese electronics company named Cal-Comp.  There are known
# to have been at least two models, the 33 and the 50.
#

# The 50 seems to be a top end vt220 clone, with the addition of a higher
# screen resolution, a larger screen, at least 1 page of memory above and
# below the screen, apparently pages of memory right and left of the screen
# which can be panned, and about 75 function keys (15 function keys x normal,
# shift, control, func A, func B). It also has more setup possibilities than
# the vt220. The monitor case is dated November 1978 and the keyboard case is
# May 1982.
#
# The vt100 emulation works as is.  The entry below describes the rather
# non-conformant (but more featureful) ANSI mode.
#

# Extensive changes to c108 by arpavax:eric Feb 1982
# Some unknown person at SCO then translated it to terminfo.
#
# There seem to be a number of different versions of the C108 PROMS
# (with bug fixes in its Z-80 program).
# 
# The first one that we had would lock out the keyboard of you
# sent lots of short lines (like /usr/dict/words) at 9600 baud.
# Try that on your C108 and see if it sends a ^S when you type it.
# If so, you have an old version of the PROMs.
# 
# You should configure the C108 to send ^S/^Q before running this.
# It is much faster (at 9600 baud) than the c100 because the delays
# are not fixed.
# new status line display entries for c108-8p:
# <is3> - init str #3 - setup term for status display - 
# set programmer mode, select window 2, define window at last 
# line of memory, set bkgnd stat mesg there, select window 0.
# 
# <tsl> - to status line - select window 2, home cursor, erase to 
# end-of-window, 1/2 bright on, goto(line#0, col#?)
# 
# <fsl> - from status line - 1/2 bright off, select window 0
# 
# <dsl> - disable status display - set bkgnd status mesg with 
# illegal window #
# 
# There are probably more function keys that should be added but 
# I don't know what they are.
#
# No delays needed on c108 because of ^S/^Q handshaking

# Concept 100:
# These have only window relative cursor addressing, not screen 
# relative. To get it to work right here, smcup/rmcup (which 
# were invented for the concept) lock you into a one page 
# window for screen style programs.
# 
# To get out of the one page window, we use a clever trick:
# we set the window size to zero ("\Ev    " in rmcup) which the 
# terminal recognizes as an error and resets the window to all 
# of memory.
# 
# This trick works on c100 but does not on c108, sigh.
# 
# Some tty drivers use cr3 for concept, others use nl3, hence 
# the delays on cr and ind below. This padding is only needed at 
# 9600 baud and up.  One or the other is commented out depending on 
# local conventions.
# 
# 2 ms padding on <rmcup> isn't always enough. 6 works fine. Maybe 
# less than 6 but more than 2 will work.
# 
# Note: can't use function keys f7-f10 because they are 
# indistinguishable from arrow keys (!), also, del char and 
# clear eol use xon/xoff so they probably won't work very well.
# 
# Also note that we don't define insrt/del char/delline/eop/send 
# because they don't transmit unless we reset them - I figured 
# it was a bad idea to clobber their definitions.
# 
# The <mc5> sequence changes the escape character to ^^ so that 
# escapes will be passed through to the printer. Only trouble 
# is that ^^ won't be - ^^ was chosen to be unlikely. 
# Unfortunately, if you're sending raster bits through to be 
# plotted, any character you choose will be likely, so we lose.
#
# \EQ"\EY(^W (send anything from printer to host, for xon/xoff) 
# cannot be # in is2 because it will hang a c100 with no printer 
# if sent twice.
