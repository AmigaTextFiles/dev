What @{b}configure@{ub} does
*******************

   This manual documents Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub}, a program which helps to
automate much of the setup activity associated with building large
suites of programs, such the Cygnus Support Developer's Kit.  This
manual is therefore geared toward readers who are likely to face the
problem of configuring software in source form before compiling and
installing it.  We assume you are an experienced programmer or system
administrator.  For further background on this topic, see
@{"Apologia Configure" link "cfg-paper.guide/Some Basic Terms"}, by K. Richard Pixley.

   When @{b}configure@{ub} runs, it does the following things:

@{i}* creates build directories@{ui}
     When you run @{b}configure@{ub} with the @{b}--srcdir@{ub} option, it uses the
     current directory as the @{i}build directory@{ui}, creating under it a
     directory tree that parallels the directory structure of the
     source directory.  If you don't specify a @{b}srcdir@{ub}, @{b}configure@{ub} first
     assumes that the source code you wish to configure is in your
     current directory; if it finds no @{b}configure.in@{ub} input file there,
     it searches in the directory @{b}configure@{ub} itself lies in.  (For
     details, see @{"Build directories" link "Build directories"}.)

@{i}* generates @{b}Makefile@{ub}@{ui}
     A @{b}Makefile@{ub} template from the source directory, usually called
     @{b}Makefile.in@{ub}, is copied to an output file in the build directory
     which is most often named @{b}Makefile@{ub}.  @{b}configure@{ub} places definitions
     for a number of standard @{b}Makefile@{ub} macros at the beginning of the
     output file.  If @{b}--prefix=DIR@{ub} or @{b}--exec_prefix=DIR@{ub} are specified
     on the @{b}configure@{ub} command line, corresponding @{b}Makefile@{ub} variables
     are set accordingly.  If host, target, or site-specific @{b}Makefile@{ub}
     fragments exist, these are inserted into the output file.  (For
     details, see @{"Makefile generation" link "Makefile generation"}.)

@{i}* generates @{b}.gdbinit@{ub}@{ui}
     If the source directory contains a @{b}.gdbinit@{ub} file and the build
     directory is not the same as the source directory, a @{b}.gdbinit@{ub} file
     is created in the build directory.  This @{b}.gdbinit@{ub} file contains
     commands which allow the source directory to be read when
     debugging with the GNU debugger, @{b}gdb@{ub}.  (See @{"Command Files" link "gdb.guide/Command Files"}.)

@{i}* makes symbolic links@{ui}
     Most build directories require that some symbolic links with
     generic names are built pointing to specific files in the source
     directory.  If the system where @{b}configure@{ub} runs cannot support
     symbolic links, hard links are used instead.  (For details, see
     @{"The configure.in input file" link "configure.in"}.)

@{i}* generates @{b}config.status@{ub}@{ui}
@{b}     configure@{ub} creates a shell script named @{b}config.status@{ub} in the build
     directory.  This shell script, when run from the build directory
     (usually from within a @{b}Makefile@{ub}), will reconfigure the build
     directory (but not its subdirectories).  This is most often used
     to have a @{b}Makefile@{ub} update itself automatically if a new source
     directory is available.

@{i}* calls itself recursively@{ui}
     If the source directory has subdirectories that should also be
     configured, @{b}configure@{ub} is called for each.

Invoking @{b}configure@{ub}
******************

   Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub} is a shell script which resides in a source tree.
The usual way to invoke @{b}configure@{ub} is from the shell, as follows:

     eg$ ./configure HOSTTYPE

This prepares the source in the current directory (@{b}.@{ub}) to be compiled
for a HOSTTYPE environment.  It assumes that you wish to build programs
and files in the default @{i}build directory@{ui} (also the current directory,
@{b}.@{ub}).  If you do not specify a value for HOSTTYPE, Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub} will
attempt to discover this information by itself (see
@{"Determining system information" link "config.guess"}).  For information on HOSTTYPE
environments, See @{"Host" link "Host"}.

   All GNU software is packaged with one or more @{b}configure@{ub} script(s)
(see @{"How Configuration Should Work" link "standards.guide/Configuration"}).  By using @{b}configure@{ub} you prepare
the source for your specific environment by selecting and using
@{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments and fragments of shell scripts, which are prepared
in advance and stored with the source.

@{b}   configure@{ub}'s command-line options also allow you to specify other
aspects of the source configuration:

       configure HOSTTYPE  [--target=TARGET] [--srcdir=DIR] [--rm]
                 [--site=SITE] [--prefix=DIR] [--exec-prefix=DIR]
                 [--program-prefix=STRING] [--tmpdir=DIR]
                 [--with-PACKAGE[=YES/NO]] [--without-PACKAGE]
                 [--enable-FEATURE[=YES/NO]] [--disable-FEATURE]
                 [--norecursion] [--nfp] [-s] [-v] [-V | --version] [--help]

@{b}--target=TARGET@{ub}
     Requests that the sources be configured to target the TARGET
     machine.  If no target is specified explicitly, the target is
     assumed to be the same as the host (i.e., a @{i}native@{ui} configuration).
     See @{"Host" link "Host"}, and @{"Target" link "Target"}, for discussions of each.

@{b}--srcdir=DIR@{ub}
     Direct each generated @{b}Makefile@{ub} to use the sources located in
     directory DIR.  Use this option whenever you wish the object code
     to reside in a different place from the source code.  The @{i}build
     directory@{ui} is always assumed to be the directory you call @{b}configure@{ub}
     from.  See @{"Build directories" link "Build directories"}, for an example.  If the source
     directory is not specified, @{b}configure@{ub} assumes that the source is
     in your current directory.  If @{b}configure@{ub} finds no @{b}configure.in@{ub}
     there, it searches in the same directory that the @{b}configure@{ub} script
     itself lies in.  Pathnames specified (Values for DIR) can be
     either absolute relative to the @{i}build@{ui} directory.

@{b}--rm@{ub}
@{i}     Remove@{ui} the configuration specified by HOSTTYPE and the other
     command-line options, rather than create it.

@{i}          Note:@{ui} We recommend that you use @{b}make distclean@{ub} rather than
          use this option; see @{"Invoking make" link "make.guide/Invoking make"}, for details on @{b}make
          distclean@{ub}.

@{b}--site=SITE@{ub}
     Generate the @{b}Makefile@{ub} using site-specific @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments for
     SITE.  See @{"Adding information about local conventions" link "Makefile fragments"}.

@{b}--prefix=DIR@{ub}
     Configure the source to install programs and files under directory
     DIR.

     This option sets the variable @{b}prefix@{ub}.  Each generated @{b}Makefile@{ub}
     will have its @{b}prefix@{ub} variables set to this value.  (See
     @{"What configure really does" link "What configure really does"}.)

@{b}--exec-prefix=DIR@{ub}
     Configure the source to install @{i}host dependent@{ui} files in DIR.

     This option sets the variable @{b}exec_prefix@{ub}.  Each generated
     @{b}Makefile@{ub} will have its @{b}exec_prefix@{ub} variables set to this value.
     (See @{"What configure really does" link "What configure really does"}.)

@{b}--program-prefix=STRING@{ub}
     Configure the source to install certain programs using STRING as a
     prefix.  This applies to programs which might be used for
     cross-compilation, such as the compiler and the binary utilities,
     and also to programs which have the same names as common Unix
     programs, such as @{b}make@{ub}.

     This option sets the variable @{b}program_prefix@{ub}.  Each generated
     @{b}Makefile@{ub} will have its @{b}program_prefix@{ub} variables set to this value.
     (See @{"What configure really does" link "What configure really does"}.)

@{b}--tmpdir=TMPDIR@{ub}
     Use the directory TMPDIR for @{b}configure@{ub}'s temporary files.  The
     default is the value of the environment variable @{b}TMPDIR@{ub}, or @{b}/tmp@{ub}
     if the environment variable is not set.

@{b}--with-PACKAGE[=YES/NO]@{ub}
@{b}--without-PACKAGE@{ub}
     Indicate that PACKAGE is present, or not present, depending on
     YES/NO.  If YES/NO is nonexistent, its value is assumed to be @{b}yes@{ub}.
     @{b}--without-PACKAGE@{ub} is equivalent to @{b}--with-PACKAGE=no@{ub}.

     For example, if you wish to configure the program @{b}gcc@{ub} for a Sun
     SPARCstation running SunOS 4.x, and you want @{b}gcc@{ub} to use the GNU
     linker @{b}ld@{ub}, you can configure @{b}gcc@{ub} using

          eg$ configure --with-gnu-ld sun4

     See @{"What configure really does" link "What configure really does"}, for details.  See the
     installation or release notes for your particular package for
     details on which other PACKAGE options are recognized.

@{b}--enable-FEATURE[=YES/NO]@{ub}
@{b}--disable-FEATURE@{ub}
     Include FEATURE, or not, depending on YES/NO.  If YES/NO is
     nonexistent, its value is assumed to be @{b}yes@{ub}.  @{b}--disable-FEATURE@{ub} is
     equivalent to @{b}--enable-FEATURE=no@{ub}.

     See @{"What configure really does" link "What configure really does"}, for details.  See the
     installation or release notes for your particular package for
     details on which other FEATURE options are recognized.

@{b}--norecursion@{ub}
     Configure only this directory; ignore any subdirectories.  This is
     used by the executable shell script @{b}config.status@{ub} to reconfigure
     only the current directory; it is most often used
     non-interactively, when @{b}make@{ub} is invoked.  (See @{"config.status" link "config.status"}.)

@{b}--nfp@{ub}
     Assume that the intended HOSTTYPE has no floating point unit.

@{b}-s@{ub}
     Suppress status output.  This option is used internally by
     @{b}configure@{ub} when calling itself recursively in subdirectories.  You
     can override this option with the @{b}--verbose@{ub} option.

@{b}-v@{ub}
@{b}--verbose@{ub}
     Print status lines for each directory configured.  Normally, only
     the status lines for the initial working directory are printed.

@{b}--version@{ub}
@{b}-V@{ub}
     Print the @{b}configure@{ub} version number.

@{b}--help@{ub}
     Print a short summary of how to invoke @{b}configure@{ub}.

@{i}   Note:@{ui} You may introduce options with a single dash, @{b}-@{ub}, rather than
two dashes, @{b}--@{ub}.  However, you may not be able to truncate long option
names when using a single dash.  When using two dashes, options may be
abbreviated as long as each option can be uniquely identified.  For
example,
     eg$ configure --s=/u/me/src HOSTTYPE

is ambiguous, as @{b}--s@{ub} could refer to either @{b}--site@{ub} or @{b}--srcdir@{ub}.  However,
     eg$ configure --src=/u/me/src HOSTTYPE

is a valid abbreviation.

Using @{b}configure@{ub}
***************

@{b}   configure@{ub} prepares source directories for building programs in them.
"Configuring" is the process of preparing software to compile
correctly on a given @{i}host@{ui}, for a given @{i}target@{ui}.

@{b}   configure@{ub} subsequently writes a configured @{b}Makefile@{ub} from a pre-built
template; @{b}configure@{ub} uses variables that have been set in the
configuring process to determine the values of some variables in the
@{b}Makefile@{ub}.  Because of this we will refer to both @{b}configure@{ub} variables
and @{b}Makefile@{ub} variables.  This convention allows us to determine where
the variable should be set initially, in either @{b}configure.in@{ub} or
@{b}Makefile.in@{ub}.

What @{b}configure@{ub} really does
==========================

   Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub} is a shell script that sets up an environment in
which your programs will compile correctly for your machine and
operating system, and will install in proper places.  @{b}configure@{ub}
accomplishes this task by doing the following:

   * it generates a @{b}Makefile@{ub} from a custom template called @{b}Makefile.in@{ub}
     in each relevant source directory;

   * it customizes the build process to your specifications; you set
     certain variables for @{b}configure@{ub}, either on the command line or in
     the file @{b}configure.in@{ub}, which subsequently sets variables in each
     generated @{b}Makefile@{ub} to be used by @{b}make@{ub} when actually building the
     software;

   * it creates @{i}build directories@{ui}, places for your code to be compiled
     in before being installed;

   * it generates a @{b}.gdbinit@{ub} in the build directory, if needed, to
     communicate to @{b}gdb@{ub} where to find the program's source code;

   * it generates a shell script called @{b}config.status@{ub} which is used
     most often by the @{b}Makefile@{ub} to reconfigure itself;

   * it recurses in subdirectories, setting up entire trees so that
     they build correctly; if @{b}configure@{ub} finds another @{b}configure@{ub} script
     further down in a given source tree, it knows to use this script
     and not recur.

   For the sake of safety (i.e., in order to prevent broken
installations), the GNU coding standards call for software to be
@{i}configured@{ui} in such a way that an end user trying to build a given
package will be able to do so by affecting a finite number of
variables.  All GNU software comes with an executable @{b}configure@{ub} shell
script which sets up an environment within a build directory which will
correctly compile your new package for your host (or, alternatively,
whatever host you specify to @{b}configure@{ub}).  For further background on
this topic, see @{"Apologia Configure" link "cfg-paper.guide/Some Basic Terms"}, by K. Richard Pixley.

   Use @{b}configure@{ub} to set for the build process:

   * correct values for certain variables;

   * which type of host you wish to configure a given package for (see
     @{"Host" link "Host"});

   * where you want to install this package (by using @{b}prefix@{ub},
     @{b}exec-prefix@{ub} and @{b}program-prefix@{ub}; see
     @{"Full descriptions of all installation directories" link "Install details"});

   * optionally, which type of machine you wish to @{i}target@{ui} this
     package's output to (see @{"Target" link "Target"});

   * which other GNU packages are already installed and available to
     this particular build (by using the @{b}--with-PACKAGE@{ub} option; see
     @{"Invoking configure" link "Invoking configure"});

   * where to place temporary files (by using the @{b}--tmpdir=DIR@{ub} option;
     see @{"Invoking configure" link "Invoking configure"});

   * whether to recur in subdirectories (changeable through the
     @{b}--norecursion@{ub} option; see @{"Invoking configure" link "Invoking configure"}).

@{b}   configure@{ub} uses a few other files to complete its tasks.  These are
discussed in detail where noted.

@{b}configure.in@{ub}
     Input file for @{b}configure@{ub}.  Shell script fragments reside here.
     See @{"The configure.in input file" link "configure.in"}.

@{b}Makefile.in@{ub}
     Template which @{b}configure@{ub} uses to build a file called @{b}Makefile@{ub} in
     the @{i}build directory@{ui}.  See @{"Makefile generation" link "Makefile generation"}.

@{b}config.sub@{ub}
     Shell script used by @{b}configure@{ub} to expand referents to the HOSTTYPE
     argument into a single specification of the form CPU-VENDOR-OS.
     For instance, on the command line you can specify

          eg$ ./configure sun4

     to configure for a Sun SPARCstation running SunOS 4.x.  @{b}configure@{ub}
     consults @{b}config.sub@{ub} to find that the three-part specification for
     this is

          sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1

     which notes the CPU as @{b}sparc@{ub}, the MANUFACTURER as @{b}sun@{ub} (Sun
     Microsystems), and the OS (operating system) as @{b}sunos4.1.1@{ub}, the
     SunOS 4.1.1 release.  See @{"Variables available to configure" link "configure variables"}.

@{b}config.guess@{ub}
     If you do not put the HOSTTYPE argument on the command line,
     @{b}configure@{ub} uses the @{b}config.guess@{ub} shell script to make an analysis
     of your machine (it assumes that you wish to configure your
     software for the type of machine on which you are running).  The
     output of @{b}config.guess@{ub} is a three-part identifier as described
     above.

@{b}config.status@{ub}
     The final step in configuring a directory is to create a shell
     script, @{b}config.status@{ub}.  The main purpose of this file is to allow
     the @{b}Makefile@{ub} for the current directory to rebuild itself, if
     necessary.  See @{"config.status" link "config.status"}.

@{b}config/*@{ub}
@{b}     configure@{ub} uses three types of @{b}Makefile@{ub} @{i}fragments@{ui}, which reside in
     the directory @{b}SRCDIR/config/@{ub}.  See
     @{"Adding information about local conventions" link "Makefile fragments"}.

Build variables
---------------

   There are several variables in the build process which you can
control through build programs such as @{b}make@{ub}.  These include machine
definitions, local conventions, installation locations, locations for
temporary files, etc.  This data is accessible through certain
variables which are configurable in the build process; we refer to them
as @{i}build variables@{ui}.

   For lists of build variables which you can affect by using @{b}configure@{ub},
see @{"Variables available to configure.in" link "configure variables"}, and
@{"Full descriptions of all installation directories" link "Install details"}.

   Generally, build variables, which are used by the @{b}Makefile@{ub} to
determine various aspects of the build and installation processes, are
changeable with command-line options to @{b}configure@{ub}.  In most large
suites of programs, like the Cygnus Support Developer's Kit, the
individual programs reside in several subdirectories of a single source
code "tree".  All of these subdirectories need to be configured with
information relative to the @{i}build directory@{ui}, which is not known until
@{b}configure@{ub} is run.  Unless specified otherwise, @{b}configure@{ub} recursively
configures every subdirectory in the source tree.

   Build variables are passed from @{b}configure@{ub} directly into the
@{b}Makefile@{ub}, and use the same names (except that dashes are transformed
into underbars; for example, when you specify the option @{b}--exec-prefix@{ub}
on the command line, the @{b}Makefile@{ub} variable @{b}exec_prefix@{ub} is set).  In
other words, if you specify

     eg$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/gnu/local ... HOSTTYPE

on the command line, @{b}configure@{ub} sets an variable called @{b}prefix@{ub} to
@{b}/usr/gnu/local@{ub}, and passes this into the @{b}Makefile@{ub} in the same manner.
After this command, each @{b}Makefile@{ub} generated by @{b}configure@{ub} will contain a
line that reads:

     prefix = /usr/gnu/local

   For a list of the @{b}Makefile@{ub} variables @{b}configure@{ub} can change, and
instructions on how to change them, see
@{"Variables available to configure.in" link "configure variables"}, and @{"Invoking configure" link "Invoking configure"}.

@node "Build directories" "configure.guide/Build directories"
@next "Makefile generation"
@prev "Build variables"
@toc "What configure really does"

Build directories
-----------------

   By default, @{b}configure@{ub} builds a @{b}Makefile@{ub} and symbolic links in the
same directory as the source files.  This default works for many cases,
but it has limitations.  For instance, using this approach, you can
only build object code for one host at a time.

   We refer to each directory where @{b}configure@{ub} builds a @{b}Makefile@{ub} as a
@{i}build directory@{ui}.

   The build directory for any given build is always the directory from
which you call @{b}configure@{ub}, or @{b}.@{ub} relative to your prompt.  The default
@{i}source directory@{ui}, the place @{b}configure@{ub} looks to find source code, is
also @{b}.@{ub}.  For instance, if we have a directory @{b}/gnu-stuff/src/@{ub} that is
the top branch of a tree of GNU source code we wish to configure, then
the program we will use to configure this code is
@{b}/gnu-stuff/src/configure@{ub}, as follows.  (Assume for the sake of argument
that our machine is a sun4.)

     eg$ cd /gnu-stuff/src
     eg$ ./configure sun4
     Created "Makefile" in /gnu-stuff/src
     eg$

   We just configured the code in @{b}/gnu-stuff/src@{ub} to run on a Sun
SPARCstation using SunOS 4.x by creating a @{b}Makefile@{ub} in @{b}/gnu-stuff/src@{ub}.
By default, we also specified that when this code is built, the object
code should reside in the same directory, @{b}/gnu-stuff/src@{ub}.

   However, if we wanted to build this code for more than one host, we
would be in trouble, because the new configuration would write over the
old one, destroying it in the process.  What we can do is to make a new
@{i}build directory@{ui} and configure from there.  Running @{b}configure@{ub} from the
new directory will place a correct @{b}Makefile@{ub} and a @{b}config.status@{ub} in this
new file.  That is all @{b}configure@{ub} does; we must run @{b}make@{ub} to generate any
object code.

   The new @{b}Makefile@{ub} in @{b}/gnu-stuff/sun4-obj@{ub}, created from the template
file @{b}/gnu-stuff/src/Makefile.in@{ub}, contains all the information needed to
build the program.

     eg$ mkdir /gnu-stuff/sun4-obj
     eg$ cd /gnu-stuff/sun4-obj
     eg$ ../src/configure --srcdir=../src sun4
     Created "Makefile" in /gnu-stuff/sun4-obj
     eg$ ls
     Makefile       config.status
     eg$ make all info install install-info clean
     COMPILATION MESSAGES...
     eg$ mkdir /gnu-stuff/solaris2
     eg$ cd /gnu-stuff/solaris2
     eg$ ../src/configure --srcdir=../src sol2
     Created "Makefile" in /gnu-stuff/solaris2
     eg$ ls
     Makefile       config.status
     eg$ make all info install install-info clean
     COMPILATION MESSAGES...

   We can repeat this for other configurations of the same software
simply by making a new build directory and reconfiguring from inside
it.  If you do not specify the HOSTTYPE argument, @{b}configure@{ub} will
attempt to figure out what kind of machine and operating system you
happen to be using.  See @{"Determining system information" link "config.guess"}.  Of course,
this may not always be the configuration you wish to build.

@{i}   Caution:@{ui} If you build more than one configuration for a single
program, remember that you must also specify a different @{b}--prefix@{ub} for
each configuration at configure-time.  Otherwise, both configurations
will be installed in the same default location (@{b}/gg@{ub}); the configuration
to be installed last would overwrite previously installed
configurations.

@{b}Makefile@{ub} generation
-------------------

   Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub} creates a file called @{b}Makefile@{ub} in the build
directory which can be used with @{b}make@{ub} to automatically build a given
program or package.  @{b}configure@{ub} also builds a @{b}Makefile@{ub} for each relevant
subdirectory for a given program or package (irrelevant subdirectories
would be those which contain no code which needs configuring, and which
therefore have no @{b}configure@{ub} input file @{b}configure.in@{ub} and no @{b}Makefile@{ub}
template @{b}Makefile.in@{ub}).  See @{"make Invocation" link "make.guide/Running"}, for details on using @{b}make@{ub}
to compile your source code.

   Each @{b}Makefile@{ub} contains variables which have been configured for a
specific build.  These build variables are determined when @{b}configure@{ub} is
run.  All build variables have defaults.  By default, @{b}configure@{ub}
generates a @{b}Makefile@{ub} which specifies:

   * a @{i}native@{ui} build, which is to occur

   * in the current directory, and which will be installed

   * in the default installation directory (@{b}/gg@{ub}) when the code is
     compiled with @{b}make@{ub}.

Variables are changeable through command-line options to @{b}configure@{ub} (see
@{"Invoking configure" link "Invoking configure"}).

   If you are porting a new program and intend to use @{b}configure@{ub}, see
@{"Porting with configure" link "Porting"}, as well as @{"Writing Makefiles" link "make.guide/Makefiles"}, and
@{"Makefile Conventions" link "standards.guide/Makefiles"}.

Determining system information
------------------------------

   The shell script @{b}config.guess@{ub} is called when you do not specify a
HOSTTYPE on the command line to @{b}configure@{ub}.  @{b}config.guess@{ub} acquires
available system information from your local machine through the shell
command @{b}uname@{ub}.  It compares this information to a database and attempts
to determine a usable three-part system identifier (known as a @{i}triple@{ui})
to use as your HOSTTYPE.  See @{"What configure really does" link "What configure really does"}, to see how
this information is used.

@{i}   Note:@{ui}  If you do not specify a HOSTTYPE on the command line,
@{b}configure@{ub} will attempt to configure your software to run on the machine
you happen to be using.  This may not be the configuration you desire.

@node "config.status" "configure.guide/config.status"

@{b}config.status@{ub}
-------------

   The final step in configuring a directory is to create an executable
shell script, @{b}config.status@{ub}.  The main purpose of this file is to allow
the @{b}Makefile@{ub} for the current directory to rebuild itself, if necessary.
It is usually run from within the @{b}Makefile@{ub}.  See
@{"Extensions to the GNU coding standards" link "Makefile extensions"}.

@{b}   config.status@{ub} also contains a record of the @{b}configure@{ub} session which
created it.

The @{b}configure.in@{ub} input file
===========================

   A @{b}configure.in@{ub} file for Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub} consists of a
@{i}per-invocation@{ui} section, followed by a @{i}per-host@{ui} section, followed by a
@{i}per-target@{ui} section, optionally followed by a @{i}post-target@{ui} section.  Each
section is a shell script fragment, which is executed by the @{b}configure@{ub}
shell script at an appropriate time.  Values are passed among @{b}configure@{ub}
and the shell fragments through a set of shell variables.  When each
section is being interpreted by the shell, the shell's current
directory is the build directory, and any files created by the section
(or referred to by the section) will be relative to the build
directory.  To reference files in other places (such as the source
directory), prepend a shell variable such as @{b}$(srcdir)/@{ub} to the desired
file name.

   The beginning of the @{b}configure.in@{ub} file begins the @{i}per-invocation@{ui}
section.

   A line beginning with @{b}# per-host:@{ub} begins the @{i}per-host@{ui} section.

   A line beginning with @{b}# per-target:@{ub} begins the @{i}per-target@{ui} section.

   If it exists, the @{i}post-target@{ui} section begins with @{b}# post-target:@{ub}.

Variables available to @{b}configure.in@{ub}
-----------------------------------

   The following variables pass information between the standard parts
of @{b}configure@{ub} and the shell-script fragments in @{b}configure.in@{ub}:

@{b}srctrigger@{ub}
     Contains the name of a source file that is expected to live in the
     source directory.  You must usually set this in the @{i}per-invocation@{ui}
     section of @{b}configure.in@{ub}.  @{b}configure@{ub} tests to see that this file
     exists.  If the file does not exist, @{b}configure@{ub} prints an error
     message.  This is used as a sanity check that @{b}configure.in@{ub} matches
     the source directory.

@{b}srcname@{ub}
     Contains the name of the source collection contained in the source
     directory.  You must usually set this in the @{i}per-invocation@{ui}
     section of @{b}configure.in@{ub}.  If the file named in @{b}srctrigger@{ub} does not
     exist, @{b}configure@{ub} uses the value of @{b}srcname@{ub} when it prints the error
     message.

@{b}configdirs@{ub}
     Contains the names of any subdirectories in which @{b}configure@{ub} should
     recurse.  You must usually set this in the @{i}per-invocation@{ui} section
     of @{b}configure.in@{ub}.  If @{b}Makefile.in@{ub} contains a line starting with
     @{b}SUBDIRS =@{ub}, then it will be replaced with an assignment to @{b}SUBDIRS@{ub}
     using the value of @{b}configdirs@{ub} (if @{b}subdirs@{ub} is empty).  This can be
     used to determine which directories to configure and build
     depending on the host and target configurations.  Use @{b}configdirs@{ub}
     (instead of the @{b}subdirs@{ub} variable described below) if you want to
     be able to partition the subdirectories, or use independent
     @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments.  Each subdirectory can be independent, and
     independently reconfigured.

@{b}subdirs@{ub}
     Contains the names of any subdirectories where @{b}configure@{ub} should
     create a @{b}Makefile@{ub} (in addition to the current directory), @{i}without@{ui}
     recursively running @{b}configure@{ub}.  Use @{b}subdirs@{ub} (instead of the
     @{b}configdirs@{ub} variable described above) if you want to configure all
     of the directories as a unit.  Since there is a single invocation
     of @{b}configure@{ub} that configures many directories, all the directories
     can use the same @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments, and the same @{b}configure.in@{ub}.

@{b}host@{ub}
     Contains the full configuration name for the host (generated by
     the script @{b}config.sub@{ub} from the name that you entered).  This is a
     three-part name (commonly referred to as a @{i}triple@{ui}) of the form
     CPU-VENDOR-OS.

     There are separate variables @{b}host_cpu@{ub}, @{b}host_vendor@{ub}, and @{b}host_os@{ub}
     that you can use to test each of the three parts; this variable is
     useful, however, for error messages, and for testing combinations
     of the three components.

@{b}host_cpu@{ub}
     Contains the first element of the canonical triple representing
     the host as returned by @{b}config.sub@{ub}.  This is occasionally used to
     distinguish between minor variations of a particular vendor's
     operating system and sometimes to determine variations in binary
     format between the host and the target.

@{b}host_vendor@{ub}
     Contains the second element of the canonical triple representing
     the host as returned by @{b}config.sub@{ub}.  This is usually used to
     distinguish among the numerous variations of @{i}common@{ui} operating
     systems.

@{b}host_os@{ub}
     Contains the the third element of the canonical triple
     representing the host as returned by @{b}config.sub@{ub}.

@{b}target@{ub}
     Contains the full configuration name (generated by the script
     @{b}config.sub@{ub} from the name that you entered) for the target.  Like
     the host, this is a three-part name of the form CPU-VENDOR-OS.

     There are separate variables @{b}target_cpu@{ub}, @{b}target_vendor@{ub}, and
     @{b}target_os@{ub} that you can use to test each of the three parts; this
     variable is useful, however, for error messages, and for testing
     combinations of the three components.

@{b}target_cpu@{ub}
     Contains the first element of the canonical triple representing
     the target as returned by @{b}config.sub@{ub}.  This variable is used
     heavily by programs which are involved in building other programs,
     like the compiler, assembler, linker, etc.  Most programs will not
     need the @{b}target@{ub} variables at all, but this one could conceivably
     be used to build a program, for instance, that operated on binary
     data files whose byte order or alignment differ from the system
     where the program is running.

@{b}target_vendor@{ub}
     Contains the second element of the canonical triple representing
     the target as returned by @{b}config.sub@{ub}.  This is usually used to
     distinguish among the numerous variations of @{i}common@{ui} operating
     systems or object file formats.  It is sometimes used to switch
     between different flavors of user interfaces.

@{b}target_os@{ub}
     Contains the the third element of the canonical triple
     representing the target as returned by @{b}config.sub@{ub}.  This variable
     is used by development tools to distinguish between subtle
     variations in object file formats that some vendors use across
     operating system releases.  It might also be use to decide which
     libraries to build or what user interface the tool should provide.

@{b}floating_point@{ub}
     Set to @{b}no@{ub} if you invoked @{b}configure@{ub} with the @{b}--nfp@{ub} command-line
     option, otherwise it is empty.  This is a request to target
     machines with @{i}no floating point@{ui} unit, even if the targets
     ordinarily have floating point units available.

@{b}gas@{ub}
     Set to @{b}true@{ub} if you invoked @{b}configure@{ub} with the @{b}--with-gnu-as@{ub}
     command line option, otherwise it is empty.  This is a request to
     assume that the specified HOSTTYPE machine has GNU @{b}as@{ub} available
     even if it ordinarily does not.

@{b}srcdir@{ub}
     Set to the name of the directory containing the source for this
     program.  This will be different from @{b}.@{ub} if you have specified the
     @{b}--srcdir=DIR@{ub} option.  @{b}srcdir@{ub} can indicate either an absolute path
     or a path relative to the build directory.

@{b}package_makefile_frag@{ub}
     If set in @{b}configure.in@{ub}, this variable should be the name a file
     relative to @{b}srcdir@{ub} to be included in the resulting @{b}Makefile@{ub}.  If
     the named file does not exist, @{b}configure@{ub} will print a warning
     message.  This variable is not set by @{b}configure@{ub}.

@{b}host_makefile_frag@{ub}
     If set in @{b}configure.in@{ub}, this variable should be the name a file
     relative to @{b}srcdir@{ub} to be included in the resulting @{b}Makefile@{ub}.  If
     the named file does not exist, @{b}configure@{ub} will print a warning
     message.  This variable is not set by @{b}configure@{ub}.

@{b}target_makefile_frag@{ub}
     If set in @{b}configure.in@{ub}, this variable should be the name of a file,
     relative to @{b}srcdir@{ub}, to be included in the resulting @{b}Makefile@{ub}.  If
     the named file does not exist, @{b}configure@{ub} will print a warning
     message.  This variable is not set by @{b}configure@{ub}.

@{b}site_makefile_frag@{ub}
     Set to a file name representing to the default @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragment
     for this host.  It may be set in @{b}configure.in@{ub} to override this
     default.  Normally @{b}site_makefile_frag@{ub} is empty, but will have a
     value if you specify @{b}--site=SITE@{ub} on the command line.

@{b}Makefile@{ub}
     Set to the name of the generated @{b}Makefile@{ub}.  Normally this value is
     precisely @{b}Makefile@{ub}, but some programs may want something else.

@{b}removing@{ub}
     Normally empty but will be set to some non-null value if you
     specified @{b}--rm@{ub} on the command line.  That is, if @{b}removing@{ub} is not
     empty, then @{b}configure@{ub} is @{i}removing@{ui} a configuration rather than
     creating one.

@{b}files@{ub}
     If this variable is not empty following the @{i}per-target@{ui} section,
     then each word in its value will be the target of a symbolic link
     named in the corresponding word from the @{b}links@{ub} variable.

@{b}links@{ub}
     If the @{b}files@{ub} variable is not empty following the @{i}per-target@{ui}
     section, then @{b}configure@{ub} creates symbolic links with the first word
     of @{b}links@{ub} pointing to the first word of @{b}files@{ub}, the second word of
     @{b}links@{ub} pointing to the second word of @{b}files@{ub}, and so on.

A minimal @{b}configure.in@{ub}
----------------------

   A minimal @{b}configure.in@{ub} consists of four lines.

     srctrigger=foo.c
     srcname="source for the foo program"
     # per-host:
     # per-target:

   The @{b}# per-host:@{ub} and @{b}# per-target:@{ub} lines divide the file into the
three required sections.  The @{b}srctrigger@{ub} line names a file.  @{b}configure@{ub}
checks to see that this file exists in the source directory before
configuring.  If the @{b}srctrigger@{ub} file does not exist, @{b}configure@{ub} uses the
value of @{b}srcname@{ub} to print an error message about not finding the source.

   This particular example uses no links, and only the default host,
target, and site-specific @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments if they exist.

@{b}# per-target:@{ub}.  @{b}configure@{ub} invokes the commands in the @{i}per-host@{ui} section
when determining host-specific information.

   This section usually contains a big @{b}case@{ub} statement using the variable
@{b}host@{ub} to determine appropriate values for @{b}host_makefile_frag@{ub} and @{b}files@{ub},
although @{b}files@{ub} is not usually set here.  Usually, it is set at the end

section extends to the end of the file.  @{b}configure@{ub} invokes the commands
in the @{i}per-target@{ui} section when determining target-specific information,
and before building any files, directories, or links.

   This section usually contains a big @{b}case@{ub} statement using the variable
@{b}target@{ub} to determine appropriate values for @{b}target_makefile_frag@{ub} and

Install locations
=================

   Using the default configuration, @{b}make install@{ub} creates a single tree
of files, some of which are programs.  The location of this tree is
determined by the value of the variable @{b}prefix@{ub}.  The default value of
@{b}prefix@{ub} is @{b}/gg@{ub}.  This is often correct for native tools installed on only
one host.

Changing the default install directory
--------------------------------------

   In the default configuration, all files are installed in
subdirectories of @{b}/gg@{ub}.  The location is determined by the value of the
@{b}configure@{ub} variable @{b}prefix@{ub}; in turn, this determines the value of the
@{b}Makefile@{ub} variable of the same name (@{b}prefix@{ub}).

   You can also set the value of the @{b}Makefile@{ub} variable @{b}prefix@{ub}
explicitly each time you invoke @{b}make@{ub} if you are so inclined.  However,
because many programs have this location compiled in, you must specify
the @{b}prefix@{ub} value consistently on each invocation of @{b}make@{ub}, or you will
end up with a broken installation.

   To make this easier, the value of the @{b}configure@{ub} variable @{b}prefix@{ub} can
be set on the command line to @{b}configure@{ub} using the option @{b}--prefix=@{ub}.


@endnode

@node "exec_prefix" "configure.guide/exec_prefix"
@next "Install details"
@prev "prefix"
@toc "Install locations"

Installing for multiple hosts
-----------------------------

   By default, host dependent files are installed in subdirectories of
@{b}$(exec_prefix)@{ub}.  The location is determined by the value of the
@{b}configure@{ub} variable @{b}exec_prefix@{ub}, which determines the value of the
@{b}Makefile@{ub} variable @{b}exec_prefix@{ub}.  This makes it easier to install for a
single host, and simplifies changing the default location for the
install tree.  The default doesn't allow for multiple hosts to
effectively share host independent files, however.

   To configure so that multiple hosts can share common files, use
something like:

     configure HOST1 -prefix=/usr/gnu -exec_prefix=/usr/gnu/H-host1
     make all info install install-info clean
     
     configure HOST2 -prefix=/usr/gnu -exec_prefix=/usr/gnu/H-host2
     make all info install install-info

   The first line configures the source for HOST1 to place host-specific
programs in subdirectories of @{b}/usr/gnu/H-HOST1@{ub}.

   The second line builds and installs all programs for HOST1,
including both host-independent and host-specific files, as well as
removing the host-specific object files from of the build directory.

   The third line reconfigures the source for HOST2 to place host
specific programs in subdirectories of @{b}/usr/gnu/H-HOST2@{ub}.

   The fourth line builds and installs all programs for HOST2.  Host
specific files are installed in new directories, but the host
independent files are installed @{i}on top of@{ui} the host independent files
installed for HOST1.  This results in a single copy of the host
independent files, suitable for use by both hosts.

   See @{"Extensions to the GNU coding standards" link "Makefile extensions"}, for more information.


@endnode

@node "Install details" "configure.guide/Install details"
@prev "exec_prefix"
@toc "Install locations"

Full descriptions of all installation subdirectories
----------------------------------------------------

   During any install, a number of standard directories are created.
Their names are determined by @{b}Makefile@{ub} variables.  Some of the defaults
for @{b}Makefile@{ub} variables can be changed at configuration time using
command line options to @{b}configure@{ub}.  For more information on the standard
directories or the @{b}Makefile@{ub} variables, please refer to
@{"Makefile Conventions" link "standards.guide/Makefiles"}.  See also
@{"Extensions to the GNU coding standards" link "Makefile extensions"}.

   Note that @{b}configure@{ub} does not create the directory indicated by the
variable @{b}srcdir@{ub} at any time.  @{b}$(srcdir)@{ub} is not an installation
directory.

   You can override all @{b}Makefile@{ub} variables on the command line to @{b}make@{ub}.
(See @{"Overriding Variables" link "make.guide/Overriding"}.)  If you do so, you will need to specify
the value precisely the same way for each invocation of @{b}make@{ub}, or you
risk ending up with a broken installation.  This is because many
programs have the locations of other programs or files compiled into
them.  If you find yourself overriding any of the variables frequently,
you should consider site dependent @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments.  See also
@{"Adding site info" link "Sites"}.

   During @{b}make install@{ub}, a number of standard directories are created and
populated.  The following @{b}Makefile@{ub} variables define them.  Those whose
defaults are set by corresponding @{b}configure@{ub} variables are marked
"@{b}Makefile@{ub} and @{b}configure@{ub}".

@{b}prefix (@{b}Makefile@{ub} and @{b}configure@{ub})@{ub}
     The root of the installation tree.  You can set its @{b}Makefile@{ub}
     default with the @{b}--prefix=@{ub} command line option to @{b}configure@{ub} (see
     @{"Invoking configure" link "Invoking configure"}).  The default value for @{b}prefix@{ub} is @{b}/gg@{ub}.

@{b}bindir@{ub}
     A directory for binary programs that users can run.  The default
     value for @{b}bindir@{ub} depends on @{b}prefix@{ub}; @{b}bindir@{ub} is normally changed only
     indirectly through @{b}prefix@{ub}.  The default value for @{b}bindir@{ub} is
     @{b}$(prefix)/bin@{ub}.

@{b}exec_prefix (@{b}Makefile@{ub} and @{b}configure@{ub})@{ub}
     A directory for host dependent files.  You can specify the @{b}Makefile@{ub}
     default value by using the @{b}--exec_prefix=@{ub} option to @{b}configure@{ub}.
     (See @{"Invoking configure" link "Invoking configure"}.)  The default value for @{b}exec_prefix@{ub} is
     @{b}$(prefix)@{ub}.

@{b}libdir@{ub}
     A directory for libraries and support programs.  The default value
     for @{b}libdir@{ub} depends on @{b}prefix@{ub}; @{b}libdir@{ub} is normally changed only
     indirectly through @{b}prefix@{ub}.  The default value for @{b}libdir@{ub} is
     @{b}$(prefix)/lib@{ub}.

@{b}mandir@{ub}
     A directory for @{b}man@{ub} format documentation ("man pages").  The
     default value for @{b}mandir@{ub} depends on @{b}prefix@{ub}; @{b}mandir@{ub} is normally
     changed only indirectly through @{b}prefix@{ub}.  The default value for
     @{b}mandir@{ub} is @{b}$(prefix)/man@{ub}.

@{b}manNdir@{ub}
     These are eight variables named @{b}man1dir@{ub}, @{b}man2dir@{ub}, etc.  They name
     the specific directories for each man page section.  For example,
     @{b}man1dir@{ub} by default holds the filename @{b}$(mandir)/man1@{ub}; this
     directory contains @{b}emacs.1@{ub} (the man page for GNU Emacs).
     Similarly, @{b}man5dir@{ub} contains the value @{b}$(mandir)/man5@{ub}, indicating
     the directory which holds @{b}rcsfile.5@{ub} (the man page describing the
     @{b}rcs@{ub} data file format).  The default value for any of the @{b}manNdir@{ub}
     variables depends indirectly on @{b}prefix@{ub}, and is normally changed
     only through @{b}prefix@{ub}.  The default value for @{b}manNdir@{ub} is
     @{b}$(mandir)/manN@{ub}.

@{b}manNext@{ub}
@{i}     Not supported by Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub}@{ui}.  The `GNU Coding Standards' do
     not call for @{b}man1ext@{ub}, @{b}man2ext@{ub}, so the intended use for @{b}manext@{ub} is
     apparently not parallel to @{b}mandir@{ub}.  Its use is not clear.  (See
     also @{"Extensions to the GNU coding standards" link "Makefile extensions"}.)

@{b}infodir@{ub}
     A directory for @{b}info@{ub} format documentation.  The default value for
     @{b}infodir@{ub} depends indirectly on @{b}prefix@{ub}; @{b}infodir@{ub} is normally changed
     only through @{b}prefix@{ub}.  The default value for @{b}infodir@{ub} is
     @{b}$(prefix)/info@{ub}.

@{b}docdir@{ub}
     A directory for any documentation that is in a format other than
     those used by @{b}info@{ub} or @{b}man@{ub}.  The default value for @{b}docdir@{ub} depends
     indirectly on @{b}prefix@{ub}; @{b}docdir@{ub} is normally changed only through
     @{b}prefix@{ub}.  The default value for @{b}docdir@{ub} is @{b}$(datadir)/doc@{ub}.  @{i}This
     variable is an extension to the GNU coding standards@{ui}.  (See also
     @{"Extensions to the GNU coding standards" link "Makefile extensions"}.)

@{b}includedir@{ub}
     A directory for the header files accompanying the libraries
     installed in @{b}libdir@{ub}.  The default value for @{b}includedir@{ub} depends on
     @{b}prefix@{ub}; @{b}includedir@{ub} is normally changed only indirectly through
     @{b}prefix@{ub}.  The default value for @{b}includedir@{ub} is @{b}$(prefix)/include@{ub}.

Host
====

   The arguments to @{b}configure@{ub} are @{i}hosttypes@{ui}.  By @{i}hosttype@{ui} we mean the
@{i}environment@{ui} in which the source will be compiled.  This need not
necessarily be the same as the physical machine involved, although it
usually is.

   For example, if some obscure machine had the GNU @{b}POSIX@{ub} emulation
libraries available, it would be possible to configure most GNU source
for a @{b}POSIX@{ub} system and build it on the obscure host.

Target
======

   For building native development tools, or most of the other GNU
tools, you need not worry about the target.  The @{i}target@{ui} of a
configuration defaults to the same as the @{i}host@{ui}.

Adding information about local conventions
==========================================

   If you find that a tool does not get configured to your liking, or if
@{b}configure@{ub}'s conventions differ from your local conventions, you should
probably consider @{i}site-specific @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments@{ui}.  See also
@{"Adding site info" link "Sites"}.

   These are probably not the right choice for options that can be set
from the @{b}configure@{ub} command line or for differences that are host or
target dependent.

   Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub} uses three types of @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments.  In a
generated @{b}Makefile@{ub} they appear in the order: @{i}target fragment@{ui}, @{i}host
fragment@{ui}, and @{i}site fragment@{ui}.  This allows host fragments to override
target fragments, and site fragments to override both.

   Host-specific @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments conventionally reside in the
@{b}./config/@{ub} subdirectory with names of the form @{b}mh-HOSTTYPE@{ub}.  They are
used for hosts that require odd options to the standard compiler and
for compile time options based on the host configuration.

   Target-specific @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments conventionally reside in the
@{b}./config/@{ub} subdirectory with names of the form @{b}mt-TARGET@{ub}.  They are used
for target dependent compile time options.

   Site specific @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments conventionally reside in the
@{b}./config/@{ub} subdirectory with names of the form @{b}ms-SITE@{ub}.  They are used
to override host- and target-independent compile time options.  Note
that you can also override these options on the @{b}make@{ub} invocation line.

@node "Makefile extensions" "configure.guide/Makefile extensions"
@prev "Makefile fragments"
@toc "Using configure"

Extensions to the GNU coding standards
======================================

   The following additions to the GNU coding standards are required for
Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub} to work properly.

   * The @{b}Makefile@{ub} must contain exactly one line starting with @{b}####@{ub}.
     This line should follow any default macro definitions but precede
     any rules.  Host, target, and site-specific @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments
     will be inserted immediately after this line.  If the line is
     missing, the fragments will not be inserted.

   * Cygnus adds the following targets to each @{b}Makefile@{ub}.  Their
     existence is not required for Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub}, but they are
     documented here for completeness.

    @{b}info@{ub}
          Build all info files from texinfo source.

    @{b}install-info@{ub}
          Install all info files.

    @{b}clean-info@{ub}
          Remove all info files and any intermediate files that can be
          generated from texinfo source.

    @{b}Makefile@{ub}
          Calls @{b}./config.status@{ub} to rebuild the @{b}Makefile@{ub} in this
          directory.

   * The following @{b}Makefile@{ub} targets have revised semantics:

    @{b}install@{ub}
          Should @{i}not@{ui} depend on the target @{b}all@{ub}.  If the program is not
          already built, @{b}make install@{ub} should fail.  This allows you to
          install programs even when @{b}make@{ub} would otherwise determine
          them to be out of date.  This can happen, for example, when
          the result of a @{b}make all@{ub} is transported via tape to another
          machine for installation.

    @{b}clean@{ub}
          Should remove any file that can be regenerated by the
          @{b}Makefile@{ub}, excepting only the @{b}Makefile@{ub} itself, and any links
          created by @{b}configure@{ub}.  That is, @{b}make all clean@{ub} should return
          all directories to their original condition.  If this is not
          done, then the command sequence

               configure HOST1 ; make all install clean ;
               configure HOST2 ; make all install

          will fail because of intermediate files intended for HOST1.

   * Cygnus adds the following macros to all @{b}Makefile.in@{ub} files, but you
     are not required to use them to run Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub}.

    @{b}docdir@{ub}
          The directory in which to install any documentation that is
          not either a @{b}man@{ub} page or an @{b}info@{ub} file.  For @{b}man@{ub} pages, see
          @{b}mandir@{ub}; for @{b}info@{ub}, see @{b}infodir@{ub}.

    @{b}includedir@{ub}
          The directory in which to install any header files that
          should be made available to users.  This is distinct from the
          @{b}gcc@{ub} include directory, which is intended for @{b}gcc@{ub} only.  Files
          in @{b}includedir@{ub} may be used by @{b}cc@{ub} as well.

   * The following macros have revised semantics.  Most of them describe
     installation directories; see also
     @{"Full description of all installation subdirectories" link "Install details"}.

    @{b}datadir@{ub}
          is used for host independent data files.

    @{b}mandir@{ub}
          The default path for @{b}mandir@{ub} depends on @{b}prefix@{ub}.

    @{b}infodir@{ub}
          The default path for @{b}infodir@{ub} depends on @{b}prefix@{ub}.

    @{b}BISON@{ub}
          is assumed to have a @{b}yacc@{ub} calling convention.  To use GNU
          @{b}bison@{ub}, use @{b}BISON=bison -y@{ub}.

   * Each Cygnus @{b}Makefile@{ub} also conforms to one additional restriction:

     When libraries are installed, the line containing the call to
     @{b}INSTALL_DATA@{ub} should always be followed by a line containing a call
     to @{b}RANLIB@{ub} on the installed library.  This is to accommodate
     systems that use @{b}ranlib@{ub}.  Systems that do not use @{b}ranlib@{ub} can set
     @{b}RANLIB@{ub} to "@{b}echo@{ub}" in a host specific @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragment.

Adding @{b}configure@{ub} to new programs
================================

   If you are writing a new program, you probably shouldn't worry about
porting or configuration issues until it is running reasonably on some
host.  Then refer back to this section.

   If your program currently has a @{b}configure@{ub} script that meets the GNU
standards (see @{"How Configuration Should Work" link "standards.guide/Configuration"}, please do not add Cygnus
@{b}configure@{ub}.  It should be possible to add this program without change to
a Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub} style source tree.

   If the program is not target dependent, please consider using
@{b}autoconf@{ub} instead of Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub}.  @{b}autoconf@{ub} is available from the
Free Software Foundation; it is a program which generates an executable
shell script called @{b}configure@{ub} by automatically finding information on
the system to be configured on and embedding this information in the
shell script.  @{b}configure@{ub} scripts generated by @{b}autoconf@{ub} require no
arguments, and accept the same options as Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub}.  For
detailed instructions on using @{b}autoconf@{ub}, see
@{"How to organize and produce Autoconf scripts" link "autoconf.guide/Making configure Scripts"}.

   To add Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub} to an existing program, do the following:

*Make sure the @{b}Makefile@{ub} conforms to the GNU standard
     The coding standard for writing a GNU @{b}Makefile@{ub} is described in
     @{"Makefile Conventions" link "standards.guide/Makefiles"}.  For technical information on writing a
     @{b}Makefile@{ub}, see @{"Writing Makefiles" link "make.guide/Makefiles"}.

*Add Cygnus extensions to the @{b}Makefile@{ub}
     These are described in @{"Extensions to the GNU coding standards" link "Makefile extensions"}.

*Collect package specific definitions in a single file
     Many packages are best configured using a common @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragment
     which is included by all of the makefiles in the different
     directories of the package.  In order to accomplish this, set the
     variable @{b}package_makefile_fragment@{ub} to the name of the file.  It
     will be inserted into the final @{b}Makefile@{ub} before the
     target-specific fragment.

*Move host support from @{b}Makefile@{ub} to fragments
     This usually involves finding sections of the @{b}Makefile@{ub} that say
     things like "uncomment these lines for host HOSTTYPE" and moving
     them to a new file called @{b}./config/mh-HOSTTYPE@{ub}. For more
     information, see @{"Adding hosts and targets" link "Hosts and targets"}.

*Choose defaults
     If the program has compile-time options that determine the way the
     program should behave, choose reasonable defaults and make these
     @{b}Makefile@{ub} variables.  Be sure the variables are assigned their
     default values before the @{b}####@{ub} line so that site-specific @{b}Makefile@{ub}
     fragments can override them (see
     @{"Extensions to the GNU coding standards" link "Makefile extensions"}).

*Locate configuration files
     If there is configuration information in header files or source
     files, separate it in such a way that the files have generic
     names.  Then move the specific instances of those files into the
     @{b}./config/@{ub} subdirectory.

*Separate host and target information
     Some programs already have this information separated.  If yours
     does not, you will need to separate these two kinds of
     configuration information.  @{i}Host specific@{ui} information is the
     information needed to compile the program.  @{i}Target specific@{ui}
     information is information on the format of data files that the
     program will read or write.  This information should live in
     separate files in the @{b}./config/@{ub} subdirectory with names that
     reflect the configuration for which they are intended.

     At this point you might skip this step and simply move on.  If you
     do, you should end up with a program that can be configured only
     to build @{i}native@{ui} tools, that is, tools for which the host system is
     also the target system.  Later, you could attempt to build a cross
     tool and separate out the target-specific information by figuring
     out what went wrong.  This is often simpler than combing through
     all of the source code.

*Write @{b}configure.in@{ub}
     Usually this involves writing shell script fragments to map from
     canonical configuration names into the names of the configuration
     files.  These files will then be linked at configure time from the
     specific instances of those files in @{b}./config@{ub} to files in the
     build directory with more generic names.  (See also
     @{"Build directories" link "Build directories"}.)  The format of @{b}configure.in@{ub} is described in
     @{"The configure.in input file" link "configure.in"}.

*Rename @{b}Makefile@{ub} to @{b}Makefile.in@{ub}
   At this point you should have a program that can be configured using
Cygnus @{b}configure@{ub}.

Adding hosts and targets
========================

   To add a host or target to a program that already uses Cygnus
@{b}configure@{ub}, do the following.

   * Make sure the new configuration name is represented in @{b}config.sub@{ub}.
     If not, add it.  For more details, see the comments in the shell
     script @{b}config.sub@{ub}.

   * If you are adding a host configuration, look in @{b}configure.in@{ub}, in
     the @{i}per-host@{ui} section.  Make sure that your configuration name is
     represented in the mapping from host configuration names to
     configuration files.  If not, add it.  Also see
     @{"The configure.in input file" link "configure.in"}.

   * If you are adding a target configuration, look in @{b}configure.in@{ub}, in
     the @{i}per-target@{ui} section.  Make sure that your configuration name is
     represented in the mapping from target configuration names to
     configuration files.  If not, add it.  Also see
     @{"The configure.in input file" link "configure.in"}.

   * Look in @{b}configure.in@{ub} for the variables @{b}files@{ub}, @{b}links@{ub},
     @{b}host_makefile_frag@{ub}, and @{b}target_makefile_frag@{ub}.  The values assigned
     to these variables are the names of the configuration files,
     (relative to @{b}srcdir@{ub}) that the program uses.  Make sure that copies
     of the files exist for your host.  If not, create them.  See also
     @{"Variables available to configure.in" link "configure variables"}.

   This should be enough to @{b}configure@{ub} for a new host or target
configuration name.  Getting the program to compile and run properly
represents the hardest work of any port.

Adding site info
================

   If some of the @{b}Makefile@{ub} defaults are not right for your site, you can
build site-specific @{b}Makefile@{ub} fragments.  To do this, do the following.

   * Choose a name for your site.  It must currently be less than
     eleven characters.

   * If the program source does not have a @{b}./config/@{ub} subdirectory,
     create it.

   * Create a file called @{b}./config/ms-SITE@{ub} where SITE is the name of
     your site.  In it, set whatever @{b}Makefile@{ub} variables you need to
     override to match your site's conventions.

   * Configure the program with:

          configure ... --site=SITE
