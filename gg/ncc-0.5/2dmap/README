2dmap is a simple tool that views trees in general from text files.

The format of the tree in the text file will be:

##############################
#Comment

NodeParent
	NodeChild1
	NodeChild2

NodeChild2
	NodeChild3
	NodeChild4

NodeChild3
	NodeParent
#############################


2dmap is designed to run on a text terminal (no X Windows)
and it is a good idea to setfont 8x14 or even 8x8.


You see all the functions.
The dark grey are the extern ones (their definition
was not found, C library, etc). (Existing as child only in the tree)

Movement _is_ possible with the use of the arrow keys.

MODE-1:
  pressing ' ' on a function: some other functions will become
	orange and some blue.  The blue are callers, the orange
	called by this function.
  pressing '1': will paint green all the orphans (functions,
	not called by nobody)
  pressing 'q' exits the viewer.
  pressing a letter (except 'q') will take the pointer
	to the closest fuction begining with that letter.
  pressing <enter> on a function enters MODE-2

MODE-2:
  Here you can see the function, the callers (in blue) and the
  children (orange / dim grey).  Movement is still possible.
  <enter> on a function will do the same for that function, unless
  if it is the current function, in which case we go back.
  pressing 'q' wil get you back to MODE-1 no matter how deep in
  MODE-2 you are.
