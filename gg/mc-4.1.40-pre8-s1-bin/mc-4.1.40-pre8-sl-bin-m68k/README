About:
~~~~~~
The goal of this project is creating a stable, well-working, usefull 
console-only version of well-known Midnight Commander, without bugs 
and garbage, like tk, xv and gnome. 

I'm bored waiting for bugfixes, and A'rpi's ESP team stops their work in 
this direction too, so I did it. I'm fixing all (found) bugs, reported by my 
friends, and made some really pleasent new features, like real-time clock, 
or filegroups colorizing.

- Why is it an alternate version of mc, instead applying patches
to main mc project? 

- The original mc is now about v4.6.x, with more and more bugs, 
"monster from the console" grows more and more, and now it has some 
very bad structural changes, tons of garbage code, and finally - 
there is no possibilities to compile it without some X parts, like Glib.

When I use linux - i want to use fast and powerfull _console_ file manager, 
and I like mc 4.1.x series much better: it has well-designed structures, 
easy to add new features.

Btw. I back-ported some of new usefull things appeared in 4.5.x and 4.6.x, 
make some fixes, catch some memory leaks, and so on...


Quick installation:   (keep this order!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1.	Check/edit mc.configure, and execute it:
	    ./mc.configure
        (remove --without-gpm-mouse for console mouse support)    
	You can also use ./configure, specifying options manually.
    2.	Compile it:
    	    make
    3.	If compilation successful, remove your old mc version, because it
        DOES CONFLICT with this. At least delete everything from /usr/lib/mc:
	    rm -rf /usr/lib/mc ~/.mc ~/.cedit
    4.  Install the new mc:
	    make install


ToDo:
~~~~~
    Possible-NEAR TODO:
	- 2GB limit in directory size counters must not has a place anymore!!!
	- Check and correct BeOS port (term, BackgroundTasks, Ix86/PPC):
          * Needs mountlist menu BeOS code revision (it SegFaults for now)
	  * Needs Background operations BeOS code revision
	  * Panels switch-off realisation in BeOS's beterm is necessary

	  ? Who knows, how we can determine BeOS PE5 & BeOS Dan0? How we can 
	    differentiate it one from another by #ifdef? These systems contain
	    same (BONE) headers in differetn places, and there is a problem.

	  ? Must we use only BONE, or "classical BeOS" realisation of network 
	    functions (adopt for NetServer) is necessary too ?

	- Check and correct platform-oriented ports (WIN32, QNX, Solaris with 
	  native SUN compilers, etc)
	- Inspect and correct .po, .ext, menu and documentation files
	- "configure" script needs revision

    Possible-FAR TODO:
	- Nedit -> mcedit syntax files converter (program|script)


New features in 4.1.40-pre8:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    General:
	- ADDED: "Free all VFS now" and "Refresh" buttons for "Active VFS" 
	         dialog (which binded on "Ctrl+x a")
	- ADDED: "Free all VFS now" feature in "Commands" menu
	- ADDED: "find First entry only" feature in "Find File" dialog. This 
		 option gave possibility to find only first entry of searching 
		 text definition, one per file
	- ADDED: initial support of MultiScreen feature (thanx a lot to 
	         Walery Studennikov for idea, primal MC realisation and help 
		 in porting to mc-MP)
		 Keybindings for this feature are next (for both panels and 
		 editor):
		  * Alt+d - "Dialogs" menu  (This keybinding is TEMPLATE and 
		    must be changed as soon as possible)
		  * Alt+i - "Next Dialog"
		  * Alt+u - "Previous Dialog"
	- ADDED: "HotKeys filesort" feature and keybindings (Ctrl+x 1,2,3,...,7)
	         for Re-Sorting files in panels (sort by name, extension, etc), 
		 indicator feature (that shows current sorting state ) is also 
		 realized
	- ADDED: "Charsets" additional keybinding [Shift-F8] (for editor)
    	- IMPROVED: BeOS support (PE5/Dan0 +BONE, thanx to Smedos for help)
    	- IMPROVED: Horizontal resplitter (Ctrl+LEFT|RIGHT|END) now works only 
	            if cmdline buffer is clear
    	- IMPROVED: Ctrl+H behaviour is changed:
		    * IF cmdline buffer is clear - Ctrl+H Shows/Hides hidden 
		      files/dirs, else Ctrl+H works as BackSpace
	- FIXED: SunOS/Solaris support (thanx to Mikhail Yu. Fursov for 
	         Solaris's "strsep"=="getToken" analogy) 

	        * SOLARIS PORT TESTED WITH GCC ONLY!

	- FIXED: editor behaviour with search in "re-encoding" mode
	- FIXED: editor statusline info shorts, when clock display is on 
	         (useful for 80x25 mode, but can be reverted to an older view)
	- FIXED: editor bookmarks shows correctly with [n]curses
	- FIXED: viewer's hex editor correctly shows cursor colors with [n]curses

	        * possible need some colour-corrections for slang/xterm mode
		
	- FIXED: viewer's hex editor "offset marks" currently has 8 chars, that
	         revert old-style "5-chars marks" for correction of indecorous 
		 figure, "inheritance" of older MCs
	- FIXED: viewer's status line dynamicly follows long of i18n string 
	         values (including "Col:", "Offset:", "File:", "bytes", and so 
		 on)

    Scripts:
        - Added some "mc-[SYSTEM_CLASS_NAME].configure" scripts for 
	  different systems: for most impatient persons, who can't read 
	  simple "./configure --help", and/or can't combine some necessary 
	  commandline keys of "configure" in conclusion.
	- audio vfs partially reworked
