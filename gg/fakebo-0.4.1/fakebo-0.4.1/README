                                       it's able to emulate the bugs

1. How to?
==========
Unpack the fakebo tar.gz archive and then type:

./configure
make

and then (if you are root or have write permissions to sys dirs):

make install

2. Can FakeBo auto start when I connect to the Net via PPP?
===========================================================
Yep. It can be done. Just put "fakebo" in /etc/ppp/ip-up, and it will run
fakebo when PPP is activated. Don't forget to put something like "killall 
fakebo" in /etc/ppp/ip-down....

3. WWW support page.
====================
Go to: 
http://cvs.linux.hr/fakebo/

4. Mailing-list.
================
If you want to subscribe to FakeBO mailing list, just send your e-mail
to fakebo-subscribe@linux.hr

5. I need Back Orifice client. Where can i get that?
====================================================
Well, you're lucky. Dobrica is now took mainting of Back Orifice *nix
client from Cult Of Dead Cow. You can always download latest version from:
http://cvs.linux.hr (see also section A.1 for more information)

6. I caught a bug. What to do now?
==================================
Write e-mail to the bugs-fakebo@linux.hr with short description what you
were doing, your OS version and FakeBO version. It would also be nice if
you could send your fakebo.conf and your "plugin", i.e. custom script
(if you use one) if you changed anything. Your message will enter our
bug tracking system, and you can examine it's status on:
http://cvs.linux.hr/bugs/fakebo
If you like web access better, you can use address above to submit bug
from your web browser also.

7. I desperately need some feature in FakeBO.
=============================================
Send e-mail to fakebo@linux.hr with short description of the feature
you need. Then, after a short discussion on the list (fakebo@linux.hr is 
actually a developers mailing list), and if most of us agree (or at least
someone who has to add feature ;-), the feature will be added.

8. I want to be a developer of FakeBO.
======================================
Send e-mail to the dpavlin@linux.hr for a CVS account. And then you can
write the code. It would be good to subscribe to the fakebo mailing list
too. For coding style and other usefull tips, read file HACKING included
in distribution of FakeBO.

9. I just want to send a patch.
=================================
Send patches to fakebo@linux.hr, and we'll see if it is o.k. to
include in the fakebo. Please, read file "HACKING" before submiting.

10. Contacts?

Robert Avilov: signal handling, forking                 ravilov@iname.com

APPENDIX:

A. Misc OSes (and bo client software)
=====================================

FakeBo supports following "strange", non-unix OSes: BeOS, QNX

A.1 bo client

To test misc OSes we ported bounix client to them. In the process, Dobrica
has became the maintainer of bounix client. If you want client with
advanced features (like readline, netbus support etc. -- all that is still
in plan, right now it has just portability fixes) go to anonymous CVS tree:
http://cvs.linux.hr/cvsweb.cgi/boclient/

or:

CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.linux.hr:/cvstree
cvs login
cvs checkout boclient

You will have to have GNU autoconf and automake to compile it.

A.2 BeOS

Let me start by saying that I don't really like BeOS. It's a nice OS, but
Linux is much, much better on Intel arhitecture. But, as a protability test,
I ported it to BeOS. It works (it's gcc based, anyway...)

A.3 QNX

Well, QNX 4 is posix, but it has Watcom compiler. It works anyway :-)

A.4 Windows NT

Support under windows NT (command line) is tested using UWIN POSIX layer
(look at http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/) with gcc compiler.
We are pretty sure that it also works under cygwin32 :-)
