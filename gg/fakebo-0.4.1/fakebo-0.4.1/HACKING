How to write code for FakeBO?
-----------------------------

If you wonder how do we like to code, It's hard to say. We have different
opinions. Most of them are the same as Linus', so have a look at
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle

For inpatient:

Please indent your sources with "indent -kr -i8"
Send diffs in -u format
Write changes interested for user in NEWS
Developers will use ChangeLog to track changes
	(which is created from time to time from CVS rcs)

Please, use CVS! It's a great way to develop.

CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.linux.hr:/cvsroot
cvs login	(no password, just enter!)
cvs checkout fakebo

To get write access to CVS tree write to: <dpavlin@linux.hr>

You will need latest-and-greatest tools after you do a checkout from
CVS tree: 

automake (GNU automake) 1.4
	(if you have 1.4a or higher, you can uncomment dist-bzip2)
autoconf version 2.13

If you have them, you can use autogen.sh to rebuild files which are needed
and normal ./configure ; make to build FakeBO.

You might want to subscribe to FakeBO developers mailing list by sending
an e-mail to: fakebo-subscribe@linux.hr.
