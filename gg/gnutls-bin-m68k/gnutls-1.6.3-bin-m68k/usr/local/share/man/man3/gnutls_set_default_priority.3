.SH NAME
gnutls_set_default_priority \- Sets some default priority on the cipher suites supported by gnutls.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_set_default_priority(gnutls_session_t " session ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets some default priority on the ciphers, key exchange methods, macs
and compression methods. This is to avoid using the gnutls_*\fB_priority()\fP functions, if
these defaults are ok. You may override any of the following priorities by calling
the appropriate functions.

The order is TLS1, SSL3 for protocols.
RSA, DHE_DSS, DHE_RSA for key exchange 
algorithms. SHA, MD5 and RIPEMD160 for MAC algorithms.
AES_128_CBC, 3DES_CBC, 
and ARCFOUR_128 for ciphers.

Returns 0 on success.
