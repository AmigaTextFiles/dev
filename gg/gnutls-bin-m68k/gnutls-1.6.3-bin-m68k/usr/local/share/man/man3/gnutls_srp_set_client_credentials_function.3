gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function \- Used to set a callback to retrieve the username and password
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function(gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t          " cred ", gnutls_srp_client_credentials_function          * " func ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t          cred" 12
is a \fBgnutls_srp_server_credentials_t\fP structure.
.IP "gnutls_srp_client_credentials_function          * func" 12
is the callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the username and
password for client SRP authentication.
The callback's function form is:
int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, unsigned int times, char** username,
char** password);

The \fIusername\fP and \fIpassword\fP must be allocated using \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP.
\fItimes\fP will be 0 the first time called, and 1 the second.
\fIusername\fP and \fIpassword\fP should be ASCII strings or UTF\-8 strings 
prepared using the "SASLprep" profile of "stringprep".

The callback function will be called once or twice per handshake.
The first time called, is before the ciphersuite is negotiated.
At that time if the callback returns a negative error code,
the callback will be called again if SRP has been
negotiated. This uses a special TLS\-SRP idiom in order to avoid
asking the user for SRP password and username if the server does
not support SRP.

The callback should not return a negative error code the second
time called, since the handshake procedure will be aborted.

The callback function should return 0 on success.
\-1 indicates an error.
