.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t structure
.IP "unsigned int seq" 12
specifies the sequence number of the alt name (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)
.IP "void * ret" 12
is the place where the alternative name will be copied to
.IP "size_t * ret_size" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the alternative names, contained in the
given certificate.

This is specified in X509v3 Certificate Extensions. 
GNUTLS will return the Alternative name (2.5.29.17), or a negative
error code.

Returns GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if &ret_size is not enough to hold the alternative 
name. In that case &ret_size will be updated. If everything was ok the type of alternative 
name is returned. The type is one of the enumerated gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t.

If the certificate does not have an Alternative name with the specified 
sequence number then returns GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE;
