@{B}Hi there!@{UB}


Thanks for trying the mmu.library, or "MuLib" for short. Due to the
complexity of this package, I'd like you to take a few seconds and
@{B}read@{UB} this tiny document. I hope this avoids further trouble
and misunderstandings, as well as unnecessary email. (-;

____________________________________________________________________________

@{B}What is the MuLib supposed to be?@{UB}


For short, a shared system library to make a special hardware component, the
"memory management unit", available for the system.


@{"More background" link MMU.guide/MMUOverview}

____________________________________________________________________________

@{B}Why do I need this?@{UB}


Because you might want to use a canonical set of tools that make use of the
MMU and which cooperate nicely with each other. For example, to remap the
Kickstart ROM to RAM, hence to speed up your system.


If you are a program author, you might appreciate the debugging tools in
this package, and you might be interested in the new horizons that are
opened by this package.

____________________________________________________________________________

@{B}What do I have to install, and how to install?@{UB}


Depends on what you want and what you need. There's only one mandatory
program that must be installed, and this is to copy the "mmu.library" from
the "LIBS" drawer to your "LIBS:" directory. That's all for a basic
installation. Additionally, you should get rid of the MMU hacks, or should
at least run them before you launch the MuLib.


@{B}The easiest way to install the MuLib is, of course, using the supplied
installation script.@{UB} It is located in the "Install" directory of the
distribution and is run by a double-click. It will keep care about most of
the technical points of the MuLib installation. It might be smarter than you
guess, so give it a try.


@{"Critical programs and replacements" link MMU.guide/Replacement}


The MuLib package has a bit more to offer, including new processor
libraries, some system fixes, and some extended configuration capabilities
for the expert, and ...


@{"The full installation procedure" link MMU.guide/Install}

____________________________________________________________________________

@{B}Problems? Questions?@{UB}


The best way to answer questions is to click here and read:

@{"Answers are in the FAQ" link MMU.guide/FAQ}


And, for all this numbo-mumbo in case you feel lost:

@{"Technical terms explained" link MMU.guide/Glossary}


You are of course free to complain about bugs or "features" - or whatever
you call them. But please, before contacting me:


@{B}Make a SERIOUS ATTEMPT to read the guide.@{UB}


Anyhow, here's my EMail:


@{B}thor\@math.tu-berlin.de@{UB}


PROVIDED YOU REALLY TRIED THE GUIDE BEFORE! Really, I mean it!

____________________________________________________________________________

@{B}The legal stuff@{UB}:


I'd like you to read the full licence once you've installed the MuLib,
but to say the most important things, here's it's contents compressed to a
few notes:


- The MuLib is freeware, but copyrighted. No need to pay anything for
the private user. Although I'd enjoy a thank-you note, of course....

- Do whatever you want to do with it, but don't make money.

- Redistribute it if you like, but the archive must be complete.

- I refuse any responsibility about what it might do to your system.


@{"The complete licence" link MMU.guide/Licence}


The MuLib archive contains several third-party programs you'll find in the
directory "Contributions". They might come with a licence of their own,
please check their documentation for details.


@{B}MuForce@{UB} is a special program: It is based on Mike Sinz's "Enforcer"
program and is therefore copyrighted code © Mike Sinz. In case you plan to
re-distribute the program, please remember to contact him as well and ask
for permission.

____________________________________________________________________________

@{B}SINCE NOBODY SEEMS TO READ THE GUIDE, HERE AGAIN:@{UB}


No, you @{B}need not@{UB} install the special processor libraries in this
archive. It might be a good idea to try this, but it is clearly not a
@{B}must@{UB}. The MuLib will run on top of any processor library.


Note, however, that it won't work on top of the "ppc.library" due to reasons
that are simply out of my hands. I'm sorry. You have to use "WarpOs", and
Frank Wille's ppc.library emulation.


About the @{B}MMU-Configuration@{UB}: You need one @{B}IF AND ONLY
IF@{UB} you use one of the MuLib based processor libraries, i.e. the 68040,
the 68060, the 68030 or the 68020.library in this distribution. You do not
need it otherwise, but it won't hurt if it is setup correctly. The
installation script will keep care about this.

____________________________________________________________________________

@{B}Final words@{UB}...


@{B}Besides this file, this archive should contain:@{UB}

- A "ReadMe" file with additonal information and last minute changes.

- The MMU.guide with much more detailed information.

- Thousands of tiny red program snippets saying "Warning".

- Millions of of hints saying "Read the guide!".

- Tons of software fluff to protect it against damage during transport.



@{B}You've to provide (not in this archive):@{UB}

- An Amiga Computer. Every model will do, provided a MMU is on board. Ok,
some MuLib programs will run without, but it doesn't really make too much
sense.

- Your brain. It doesn't come with an "Owner's Manual", though.

- A supersonic pair of tweezers.

- Ten miles of tram wire.



@{B}If something is missing:@{UB}

- Contact me at "thor\@math.tu-berlin.de"

- Turn around to your sprout and say:


"Do you know why this country is down, Annie? Because nobody cares, that's
why!"


Warning: This message assumes that your sprout's name is Annie.

@{B}And Now....@{UB}

                     May the MuForce be with you!

                        Thanks for reading!
