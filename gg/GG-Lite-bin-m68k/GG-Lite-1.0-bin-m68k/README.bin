GG-Lite-1.0 (m68k Amiga release)
---------------------------------

---

Geek Gadgets Lite was initially created as a compact  GNU CC environment to
help Amiga fans start coding in  C programming language. The main advantage
of the  package is that you do  not need to install  anything, nor you need
to have super-extra  OS installation. All it takes is just a  Workbench 3.x
floppy disk and around  70  megabytes of storage if whole package  is to be
installed. Less(apx. 30 megabytes) is needed if you want just the compiler.
Although  package is really aimed at being used with  'qdev'  so that quick
and easy,  native software  development is possbile it does not contain it!
The reason for that is  'qdev'  is still under heavy development  plus does
not really requires you to install it. This is because per branch  isolated
usage is essentially possible.

Geek Gadgets Lite consists of  3  archives where the  very first one is the
most important:

  GG-Lite-1.0-bin-m68k.lha - Base archive that contains minimalistic GNU CC
                             and friends(including headers and libs).

As you can see "lastest-version-is-not-always-the-best" route was taken. It
is not  only bacause of this, but simply there is no newer packages around.
But anyway if you are experienced user and your knowledge on Amiga stuff is
excellent then you can  skip on documentation, also if you do not have home
network nor access to the  Internet  then the  last package can be ommitted
too. Note  however that having a functional loop interface  is a good thing
in general, so it is worth  to  install  the network stack and disable  all
physical interfaces.

To install the environment just download all the packages,  unpack them and
move the contents from  '#?-doc-#?' and '#?-net-#?' to '#?-bin-#?'. You are
done at this point. Now visit the 'GG-Lite-?.?-bin-m68k/GG/' from Workbench
and double click  'GG_Shell'. Korn shell prompt should show up. Compiler is
all ready at that time  and you can  start coding with  'nano'  text editor
which is a very intuitive thing :-) . If network is needed then please edit
the   'startnet'  script and specify your ADDR(an IP address of your Amiga)
and GATEWAY(address of your router or computer that does the NAT). You will
also  need to select network  interface that is  under IFACE. Included  are
Ethernet PCMCIA most popular drivers plus the default A2065 ZorroII driver.
If your  NIC  is not supported by this small subset then install the driver
in  'Devs/Networks'  and add proper entry in 'db/interfaces' and go back to
'startnet'.

NOTES:

[*]
Requires 68020(no FPU)+, OS 3.0+, 8+ MiB of free memory, Workbench 3.x disk

[*]
Very important! If you are 68040/68060 turbo board user and you do not have
support library in 'Libs:' then do something like this,

  cd GG-Lite-?.?-bin-m68k/
  copy Libs/mmu.library Libs:
  copy Libs/680??.library Libs:
  copy Devs/MMU-Configuration Devs:

and reboot asap. This will make sure that the  CPU  features and its caches
are being used properly. Without this your system will be unstable!

[*]
Please do not copy all other  OS components from  'Libs',  'Devs', 'L'  and
'Prefs' to your 'SYS:' partition they will be assigned automatically during
'gg_init'!

[*]
Please note that  OS/Workbench 2.x  boot  diskette is  unsuitable!  Package
programs  will most likely  crash  probably due to differences in  MathIEEE
libraries! In theory you could load V38 libraries residently and reboot and
it should work but i did not test that!

[*]
All the  'proto/' and  'inline/' were regenerated with 'fd2pragma' tool for
GCC so that no  'libamiga.a' glue is necessary, but all direct 'alib' calls
will reference that library!

[*]
If you need network then please edit 'BIN:startnet' script and fill in your
details. By  default no physical interface is to be put  online so only the
'lo0'  will be active. Remeber that if the  TCP/IP  stack is running before
you 'gg_init' then no GG-Lite network will ever be configured!

[*]
For your convinience '#?-net-#?' includes 'lynx' web browser so you can get
things from Internet as well as browse locally stored web sites.

[*]
Default DNS server can be found in  'db/netdb'  under NAMESERVER specifier.
If  you experience  problems with  Level 3 - 4.2.2.2  then try  the  Google
- 8.8.8.8 one.

[*]
No wireless  network cards are supported because  'prism2.device'  is still
too unstable. If  you  desperately  need  WLAN  then disable  'nicfeed'  in
'startnet'  so that the driver(it really  does not like to  be put offline)
will not crash your machine that soon...

[*]
When in doubt use 'multiview' or 'man' to get help. All the programs in the
archive come with the documentation.

[*]
Please  note that packages utilised  were copied minimalistically, which is
to say only the essential parts were taken! All the sources can be found on
the net.

[*]
Be aware that most GG programs accept UNIX-like paths, so 'RAM:' should  be
written as '/RAM/', also Amiga denesting '/' must be typed as  '../'. Local
files should be requested with './<file>'.

[*]
If you can put your hands on an  "Amiga Developer CD 2.1" then you are home
and  the Amiga development will no  longer be  heavy wizardy to you. Try to
Google, CD images are floating around.

[*]
As to binaries, startup codes and static link libraries 68020 flavours rule
the package. The  'libpthread.a'  library is the  HSCM  one so you can code
with no worries about context switches.

[*]
In the  '#?-doc-#?' archive aside reference manuals you will also find some
nice tutorials regarding GCC and GDB.

[*]
Aside 'nano' which was rebuilt to work on non-FPU setup there is also 'ame'
a GUI based MicroEmacs clone taken from DiceC package.

[*]
Feel free to hack on this package  and try to make it even  smaller if that
is possible at all. But  please maintain  full functionality! At  this time
all  the dependencies are met so i have no idea, beside  binary compression
which i  want to avoid  how to  make it smaller. Anyway,  if you  see  that
something can be done better please tell me about it. Thanks!
