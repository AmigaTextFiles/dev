bison and flex generated files are included in this distributions
because we noticed some problems by using lex and compiling with C++
we are working on a work around ;-)

using lex, yylex must be declared as extern "C" in java2html.cc
and anyway scanner.c (generated by lex) must be compiled with
-D__EXTERN_C__

-l and -L are used (with yacc-bison and lex-flex respectively) to avoid
#line directory in the generated files which cause problems when 
we build the program in another directory.

I don't know if these problems still exist...
