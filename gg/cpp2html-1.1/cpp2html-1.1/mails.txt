Hi Lorenzo,

Hey, thanks, this is pretty useful :))

But I have two suggestions:

1) Include the tags.j2h file in the Win32 binary distribution file... for
really lazy Windows users :)

2) Add a switch to map tabs to spaces... I want that each tab expand to
three spaces just like in my editor; right now I would need to run a
secondary program to do the tab expansion, or lose my favourite formatting.
Java code usually has lots of identation even without heavily nested control
structures -- thanks to exception, synchronized blocks, class scope, nested
classes... with eight chars per tab the code runs over any right margin
pretty soon!!

The following code produces incorrect syntax highlighting because it
takes everything after the double quotation mark to be a string up until
it encounters a second double quotation mark.

char quot = '\"';

Anyhow, hope this help... Great idea to make a java2html syntax
highlighter.

Hi,

   I just downloaded java2html and started playing with it and it seems
to
me that having a couple of more command line options to specify input
and output files would make life easier:

-input for the input file
-output for the output file

instead of assuming the argv[1] is the input and argv[2] is the output.

This would allow people to do something like:

cat MyFile.java | java2html -output ~/html/HyJava.html

Also, perhaps another command line option to specify the title
of the HTML document when the -doc option is used.

e.g.:

java2html -input MyFile.java -output ~/html/HyJava.html -doc \
-title "Title"

I am attaching a version of java2html.cc with the above changes so
you can see what I mean.

Hello,

Here is a little patch to add some const qualifiers in function
arguments. Without some of them, gcc 2.95 refuses to compile the
program.

Hello, Mr. Bettini!

I like your java2html software very much - it's very useful. I have some
suggestions about improving the customization capabilities of java2html.

First of all, the physical formatting can be replaced by logical
formatting. Syntax elements can be rounded by <span class="xxx"> tags,
instead of <b>, <i>, <u> and <font> tags.

For example:

<span class="java-keyword"> </span>
<span class="java-type"> </span>
<span class="java-string"> </span>
<span class="java-comment"> </span>
<span class="java-number"> </span>

Once marked with these classes, user can change the physical formatting
of the generated HTML as easy as possible - using Cascading Style
Sheets.

For example:

.java-keyword {
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold
}

Changing a class definition will cause a changing of the physical format
of all marked elements. And without need java2html to produce the HTML
file again.

These CSS can be inline (in HTML) or in external .CSS file.

I'm attaching a modified variant of Hello3 example to demonstrate my
suggestion.

Hi

Thank you for java2html! However there is still something to do...
Namely I found two bugs in it:

- It ends a string when it finds an escaped double quotation mark in it
(i.e. "Hello \"World\"")
- It doesn't replace '&'-characters with "&amp;" as it should

I'll attach a "bug.patch", which should fix it (it has also an improved
Hello.java to test it)...


Then I figured that it would be nice to have an alternative output
format: HTML with CSS. This would make it easy to adjust the look of
html files on-the-fly. I include a "css.patch" which does this. You can
try the new feature like this:

java2html -input Hello.java -doc -css Hello.css
or
java2html -input Hello.java -css

(The command line handling is a bit clumsy because it requires that that
the -doc is specified before -css.)

java2html fails to identify that there
is a single backslash in the following
code fragment:

  int a( int b )
  {
    _tcsrchr( 0, _T('\\') );
  }

Instead, it things that the character
string has started, but is never ended.

Hi,

Great program, but I am not sure if this is a bug or not, but whatever I
do I cannot get the darkgreen colour working.  I keep on adding it into
the tags.j2h file, but I keep on the getting the following error and it
reverts back to the default colour,

[cjmaso@sunlab19] ~> java2html --verbose < Dictionary.java >

My tags.j2h file looks like this,

keyword blue;

string black;
number black;
comment darkgreen;

[cjmaso@sunlab19] ~/Utils/Linux/share/java2html>

However if I change the darkgreen to green it works without any problems,
but just wanted to use the darkgreen!

How about an option to set the default tab length, it seems to be using 8,
but I would like it if you can set this?  As I prefer to use 2 when
formatting code.

Cheers,
Chris Mason

Hello Lorenzo

You probably remember me, I once write you about java2html. I send you a
part of a HTML-Document, which was generated with your java2html-program
v1.5 and I have cut out of the whole HTML-Document (extract bug.zip).
As you can see, there is a '/*' after a '//', this star-comment is never
being closed and all following text is highlighted with the wrong color.
A bit more far, this text would change the color again, because this bug
implies other errors and the color of all text is changed again.

I think this bug happens because java2html doesn't realize that after a
'//' a star comment ('/*') has no meaning anymore and doesn't need to be
closed with a '*/'.

Just a little bug. I'm sure you can correct it fastly, then your program
looks pretty good.

Greetings from Switzerland, Mike
