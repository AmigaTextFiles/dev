cpp2html THANKS file

cpp2html has originally been written by Lorenzo Bettini.

Many people have further contributed to cpp2html by reporting problems, 
suggesting various improvements, or submitting actual code. Here is
a list of these people (alphabetically sorted). 
Help me keep it complete and exempt of errors, please.

These people actually helped in java2html, and thus, indirectly
also in cpp2html which is based on it :-)
