	* src/header.html: added, used with --header
	
	* doc/cpp2html.html.in: added, version number is automatically
	substituted during configuration

	* src/main.cc (readFile): read a file and return the contents in
	a char *.
	(print_top): it is assumed that if header is specified, the colors
	are defined there
	(main): handle header and footer options.
	(read_file): open the file as binary otherwise we'd
	have problems under windows, as the number of char read could be
	less then the total number of char.

	by the command line parser
	
	* src/cmdline.ggo: added, used by gengetopt to generate the
