Installation is very simple.

	First, run the file "autogen.sh":
	# sh autogen.sh

	Second, run the "configure" script:
	# sh configure

	Third, begin compiling:
	# make

	Fourth, installing.  you need to be root for this:
	# make install

	Fifth, testing.  this is optional, but if you'd like:
	# cd tests
	# ./test03

It is SUGGESTED that you read the documentation provided (in the
"docs" directory).  I would rather not recieve emails about things I
clearly explained :)  My email is at the bottom of that file as well.

In a nutshell.

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

Thats it.
