Completed the bare bones of all the main functions.

Ran into some problems with binary vs ascii transfers, fixed that with the
	help of James

Buffering problems with the function that reads listening sockets, fixed
	with help from James and Greg.

Made up all the new Makefiles and configure scripts, and here it is.

Before I released this, Greg pointed out some of the bit headers aren't
	present in newer systems.. configure now checks for that.

Well, even that didn't help much, just included sys/select.h and
	sys/fcntl.h, which appears to have fixed it.

Also, Greg pointed out on newer systems, main cant be void, it must return
	an int.

Greg also couldn't compile test02 becuase newer systems didn't like the
	idea of setting *fp as stdout all in one line.

Changed the test programs to look for "../src/ports.h" instead of
	<ports.h> since ports.h hasn't been installed at the time.

Fixed the reading stuff to actually tell you when someone disconnects.

Made a delsock function to be used externally to allow you to easily wipe
	the struct that contains the information.

Redid the broken disconnection parsing, now detects new connects and
	disconnects and passes it to the parser. (see docs)

Fixed one of the test programs segfaulting when a client disconnect (parser 
	was passed -1 and fwrite dies trying to write -1 chars).

Fixed a close() in test02 where it tried to close an entire struct rather
	then the file descriptor (only on error however).

Wrote test03.. it tests everything to see if it works, it appears to work
	pretty well.

Got bored and added some comments.. I should get in the habit of adding
	them as I go :)

Friend on GamesNET tested it on his sparc.. it worked!  However test03
	says "an sparc", so I fixed it to say "a sparc" :)

Problems with deleting the socket then telling the parser the socket is
	gone are fixed.  (Some programs will rely on the info libports holds)

Forced select() to wait until something it ready rather then
	looping.. massive CPU hog that way, all fixed now.

Changed back to looping.. the timing array gets modified by select() so I
	had to move some stuff around.

Using the variable "errno" in error.c caused problems.  Changed to "err".

Modified readfromlisten to return -9 when select() fails (when the
	listening socket is closed.)
