flex-2.5.27
-------------

---

flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognize
lexical patterns in text.

---

NOTES:

Requires 68000(no FPU), OS 2.04+, 512+ KiB of free memory, ixemul 48+

Important, I found that Aminet release of flex-2.5.33 is broken... So
this(2.5.27) is the last version that works and has most of the features
that can be found in 2.5.33(difficult to port) or later.
