.TH smssend 1 "october 7th 2001" "Version @VERSION@"
.SH NAME
smssend \- The sms sender (to GSM)
.SH SYNOPSYS

\fBsmssend\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIprovider\fP [\fIprovider-arguments\fP]
        -- [SkyUtils-options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSmssend\fP is an application that can send an SMS (a short message,
refering to the Short Message Service)
to any GSM, connecting to internet sites using scripts.
.SS Options
.TP
-q
Does not display anything when running \fBsmssend\fP.
.TP
-h or --help
Prints a short description and usage message.
.TP
-v or --version
Prints version number, then exits.
.TP
-update
Searches for a new version of \fBsmssend\fP. Requires an internet connection.
.SS Provider Arguments
.TP
-help
Must be the first provider argument, if used. Prints needed arguments, their type and description for the specified \fIprovider\fP.
.TP
-update
Must be the first provider argument, if used. Searches for a new version of the specified \fIprovider\fP. Requires an internet connection.
.TP
-
Use - as provider argument if you want this argument to be prompted from command line (stdin).
.TP
""
In each provider, there is at least one message string (quoted). You can use the escape character \\ to insert any ascii code. For example
you can add a CR/LF to the message (to force a CR on the gsm) with \\0A. The escape character always needs 2 numbers representing the ascii
code of a character in hexadecimal.

Use -help as first provider argument to see what arguments you need for the provider you wish to use. You need to give ALL
arguments the \fIprovider\fP needs in order to get it to work, but without the name of the argument. For example, if a provider
lame.sms needs the 2 arguments Tel and Message, you must call : '\fBsmssend\fP lame 123456 "Hi there"' with 123456 as phone number (ie Tel)
and "Hi there" as Message.
.SS SkyUtils Options
.TP
-p<proxy>:<port>
\fBSmssend\fP supports the use of a proxy (http proxy). If the http_proxy environment variable is set, \fBSmssend\fP will
automatically use this variable to get proxy parameters (See \fBLynx Users Guide\fP for additional details and examples on how
to set this variable). If you don't want to use this variable, you can use this option and tell \fBSmssend\fP to use the specified
\fIproxy\fP on \fIport\fP.
.TP
-u<Username>:<Password>
Use this option to specify a \fIUsername\fP and \fIPassword\fP to use when connecting to the proxy given with the -p option.
.TP
-t<Timeout>
Use this option to specify a \fItimeout\fP value (in sec) for the connections (default=60sec).
.TP
-d<DebugLevel>
Use this option to set a \fIDebugLevel\fP value (from 0 to 5) for both skyutils and smssend.
.TP
-h<User'sHeaderFile>
Use this option to use a \fIUser'sHeaderFile\fP instead of the default header for all HTTP requests.
.SH FILES
.TP
Provider Files
The needed \fIprovider\fP files are installed by default to @prefix@/share/smssend.
When invoking \fBsmssend\fP with a \fIprovider\fP, the program first
looks for the corresponding file in the current directory, then
in ~/.smssend/, and finally in the shared directory.
.TP
Aliases File
When invoking \fBSmsSend\fP with arguments, you have the possibility to use aliases (@Alias_name), which
are located in the file ~/.smssend/aliases. Each line of this file (except for empty lines, and lines starting with
a '#') must be as following : 'Name Alias' (without the '), where Name and Alias being separated by at least one space.
.nf
Example :
smssend totalise.sms @MyCountryCode @Sophie "Hi Sophie"
.SH EXAMPLE
Here comes an example on how to use \fBsmssend\fP with the script totalise.sms :
This script requires 3 parameters (CountryCode, Tel and Message). Here is how you must call \fBsmssend\fP if you wish to send the message
"hi from smssend" to the french recipient 06123456 :
smssend totalise.sms 33 6123456 "hi from smssend"
.SH BUGS AND NOTES
Well... there MIGHT be bugs in the program. But it is sure that the provider scripts may not work,
or may stop to work if provider's site changes. In this case, just send me an email, telling me
which script doesn't work, and I'll update the script as soon as possible (then you will be able to
get the latest version of the script with the command \fBsmssend <provider> -update\fP.)
