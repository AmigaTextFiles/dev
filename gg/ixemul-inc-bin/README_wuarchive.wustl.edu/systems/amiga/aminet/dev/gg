This version is compatible with AmiTCP/IP or Miami SDK. Also va_list definition
in machine/ansi.h is fixed to work properly with GCC v3.

To be able to compile AmigaOS programs which use bsdsocket.library you don't
need to install while AmiTCP or Miami SDK. Most of networking stuff is already
present in these includes. You need just to copy proto, clib and inline
directory (or probably some other files which you really need but which DO NOT
PRESENT in gg:include directory) into your gg:os-include directory. Remember
to specify -noixemul switch for every compiler call, not only for linker.
