Introduction
************

   This manual is incomplete: No attempt is made to explain basic file
concepts in a way suitable for novices.  Thus, if you are interested,
please get involved in improving this manual.  The entire GNU community
will benefit.

   The GNU file utilities are mostly compatible with the POSIX.2
standard.

   Please report bugs to <bug-fileutils@gnu.org>.  Remember to include
the version number, machine architecture, input files, and any other
information needed to reproduce the bug: your input, what you expected,
what you got, and why it is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but please
include a description of the problem as well, since this is sometimes
difficult to infer. See @{"Bugs" link "gcc.guide/Bugs"}.

   This manual was originally derived from the Unix man pages in the
distribution, which were written by David MacKenzie and updated by Jim
Meyering.  What you are reading now is the authoritative documentation
for these utilities;  the man pages are no longer being maintained.
Franc,ois Pinard did the initial conversion to Texinfo format.  Karl
Berry did the indexing, some reorganization, and editing of the results.
Richard Stallman contributed his usual invaluable insights to the
overall process.

Common options
**************

   Certain options are available in all of these programs (in fact,
every GNU program should accept them).  Rather than writing identical
descriptions for each of the programs, they are described here.

@{b}--help@{ub}
     Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
     successfully.

@{b}--version@{ub}
     Print the version number, then exit successfully.


 @{" Backup options             " link "Backup options"}  -b -S -V, in some programs.
 @{" Block size                 " link "Block size"}  BLOCK_SIZE and -block-size, in some programs.

Backup options
==============

   Some GNU programs (at least @{b}cp@{ub}, @{b}install@{ub}, @{b}ln@{ub}, and @{b}mv@{ub}) optionally make
backups of files before writing new versions.  These options control
the details of these backups.  The options are also briefly mentioned
in the descriptions of the particular programs.

@{b}-b@{ub}
@{b}--backup@{ub}
     Make a backup of each file that would otherwise be overwritten or
     removed.  Without this option, the original versions are destroyed.

@{b}-S SUFFIX@{ub}
@{b}--suffix=SUFFIX@{ub}
     Append SUFFIX to each backup file made with @{b}-b@{ub}.  If this option is
     not specified, the value of the @{b}SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX@{ub} environment
     variable is used.  And if @{b}SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX@{ub} is not set, the
     default is @{b}~@{ub}, just as in Emacs.

@{b}-V METHOD@{ub}
@{b}--version-control=METHOD@{ub}
     Use METHOD to determine the type of backups made with @{b}-b@{ub}.  If this
     option is not specified, the value of the @{b}VERSION_CONTROL@{ub}
     environment variable is used.  And if @{b}VERSION_CONTROL@{ub} is not set,
     the default backup type is @{b}existing@{ub}.

     This option corresponds to the Emacs variable @{b}version-control@{ub}; the
     same values for METHOD are accepted as in Emacs.  This options
     also more descriptive name.  The valid METHODs (unique
     abbreviations are accepted):

    @{b}t@{ub}
    @{b}numbered@{ub}
          Always make numbered backups.

    @{b}nil@{ub}
    @{b}existing@{ub}
          Make numbered backups of files that already have them, simple
          backups of the others.

    @{b}never@{ub}
    @{b}simple@{ub}
          Always make simple backups.

Block size
==========

   Some GNU programs (at least @{b}df@{ub}, @{b}du@{ub}, and @{b}ls@{ub}) display file sizes in
"blocks".  You can adjust the block size to make file sizes easier to
read.  The block size used for display is independent of any filesystem
block size.  Displayed sizes are rounded to the nearest block, with
ties rounding to an even number.

   The default block size is chosen by examining the following
environment variables in turn; the first one that is set determines the
block size.

@{b}DF_BLOCK_SIZE@{ub}
     This specifies the default block size for the @{b}df@{ub} command.
     Similarly, @{b}DU_BLOCK_SIZE@{ub} specifies the default for @{b}du@{ub} and
     @{b}LS_BLOCK_SIZE@{ub} for @{b}ls@{ub}.

@{b}BLOCK_SIZE@{ub}
     This specifies the default block size for all three commands, if
     the above command-specific environment variables are not set.

@{b}POSIXLY_CORRECT@{ub}
     If neither the @{b}COMMAND_BLOCK_SIZE@{ub} nor the @{b}BLOCK_SIZE@{ub} variables are
     set, but this variable is set, the block size defaults to 512.

   If none of the above environment variables are set, the block size
currently defaults to 1024 bytes, but this number may change in the
future.

   A block size specification can be a positive integer specifying the
number of bytes per block, or it can be @{b}human-readable@{ub} or @{b}si@{ub} to select
a human-readable format.

   With human-readable formats, output sizes are followed by a size
letter such as @{b}M@{ub} for megabytes.  @{b}BLOCK_SIZE=human-readable@{ub} uses powers
of 1024; @{b}M@{ub} stands for 1,048,576 bytes.  @{b}BLOCK_SIZE=si@{ub} is similar, but
uses powers of 1000; @{b}M@{ub} stands for 1,000,000 bytes.  (SI, the
International System of Units, defines these power-of-1000 prefixes.)

   An integer block size can be followed by a size letter to specify a
multiple of that size.  When this notation is used, the size letters
normally stand for powers of 1024, and can be followed by an optional @{b}B@{ub}
for "byte"; but if followed by @{b}D@{ub} (for "decimal byte"), they stand for
powers of 1000.  For example, @{b}BLOCK_SIZE=4MB@{ub} is equivalent to
@{b}BLOCK_SIZE=4194304@{ub}, and @{b}BLOCK_SIZE=4MD@{ub} is equivalent to
@{b}BLOCK_SIZE=4000000@{ub}.

   The following size letters are defined.  Large sizes like @{b}1Y@{ub} may be
rejected by your computer due to limitations of its arithmetic.

@{b}k@{ub}
     kilo: 2^10 = 1024 for @{b}human-readable@{ub}, or 10^3 = 1000 for @{b}si@{ub}.

@{b}M@{ub}
     Mega: 2^20 = 1,048,576 or 10^6 = 1,000,000.

@{b}G@{ub}
     Giga: 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 or 10^9 = 1,000,000,000.

@{b}T@{ub}
     Tera: 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776 or 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000.

@{b}P@{ub}
     Peta: 2^50 = 1,125,899,906,842,624 or 10^15 =
     1,000,000,000,000,000.

@{b}E@{ub}
     Exa: 2^60 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 or 10^18 =
     1,000,000,000,000,000,000.

@{b}Z@{ub}
     Zetta: 2^70 = 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 or 10^21 =
     1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

@{b}Y@{ub}
     Yotta: 2^80 = 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 or 10^24 =
     1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

   Block size defaults can be overridden by an explicit
@{b}--block-size=SIZE@{ub} option.  The @{b}-k@{ub} or @{b}--kilobytes@{ub} option is equivalent
to @{b}--block-size=1k@{ub}, which is the default unless the @{b}POSIXLY_CORRECT@{ub}
environment variable is set.  The @{b}-h@{ub} or @{b}--human-readable@{ub} option is
equivalent to @{b}--block-size=human-readable@{ub}.  The @{b}-H@{ub} or @{b}--si@{ub} option is
equivalent to @{b}--block-size=si@{ub}.

File permissions
****************

   Each file has a set of @{i}permissions@{ui} that control the kinds of access
that users have to that file.  The permissions for a file are also
called its @{i}access mode@{ui}.  They can be represented either in symbolic
form or as an octal number.

 @{" Symbolic Modes             " link "Symbolic Modes"}  Mnemonic permissions representation.

@endnode

@toc "File permissions"

Structure of File Permissions
=============================

   There are three kinds of permissions that a user can have for a file:

  1. permission to read the file.  For directories, this means
     permission to list the contents of the directory.

  2. permission to write to (change) the file.  For directories, this
     means permission to create and remove files in the directory.

  3. permission to execute the file (run it as a program).  For
     directories, this means permission to access files in the
     directory.

   There are three categories of users who may have different
permissions to perform any of the above operations on a file:

  1. the file's owner;

  2. other users who are in the file's group;

  3. everyone else.

   Files are given an owner and group when they are created.  Usually
the owner is the current user and the group is the group of the
directory the file is in, but this varies with the operating system, the
filesystem the file is created on, and the way the file is created.  You
can change the owner and group of a file by using the @{b}chown@{ub} and @{b}chgrp@{ub}
commands.

   In addition to the three sets of three permissions listed above, a
file's permissions have three special components, which affect only
executable files (programs) and, on some systems, directories:

  1. set the process's effective user ID to that of the file upon
     execution (called the @{i}setuid bit@{ui}).  No effect on directories.

  2. set the process's effective group ID to that of the file upon
     execution (called the @{i}setgid bit@{ui}).  For directories on some
     systems, put files created in the directory into the same group as
     the directory, no matter what group the user who creates them is
     in.

  3. save the program's text image on the swap device so it will load
     more quickly when run (called the @{i}sticky bit@{ui}).  For directories on
     some systems, prevent users from removing files that they do not
     own in the directory; this is called making the directory
     @{i}append-only@{ui}.

Symbolic Modes
==============

@{i}   Symbolic modes@{ui} represent changes to files' permissions as operations
on single-character symbols.  They allow you to modify either all or
selected parts of files' permissions, optionally based on their
previous values, and perhaps on the current @{b}umask@{ub} as well (see
@{"Umask and Protection" link "Umask and Protection"}).

   The format of symbolic modes is:

     [ugoa...][[+-=][rwxXstugo...]...][,...]

symbolic modes.

Setting Permissions
-------------------

   The basic symbolic operations on a file's permissions are adding,
removing, and setting the permission that certain users have to read,
write, and execute the file.  These operations have the following
format:

     USERS OPERATION PERMISSIONS

The spaces between the three parts above are shown for readability only;
symbolic modes can not contain spaces.

   The USERS part tells which users' access to the file is changed.  It
consists of one or more of the following letters (or it can be empty;
see @{"Umask and Protection" link "Umask and Protection"}, for a description of what happens then).
When more than one of these letters is given, the order that they are
in does not matter.

@{b}u@{ub}
     the user who owns the file;

@{b}g@{ub}
     other users who are in the file's group;

@{b}o@{ub}
     all other users;

@{b}a@{ub}
     all users; the same as @{b}ugo@{ub}.

   The OPERATION part tells how to change the affected users' access to
the file, and is one of the following symbols:

@{b}+@{ub}
     to add the PERMISSIONS to whatever permissions the USERS already
     have for the file;

@{b}-@{ub}
     to remove the PERMISSIONS from whatever permissions the USERS
     already have for the file;

@{b}=@{ub}
     to make the PERMISSIONS the only permissions that the USERS have
     for the file.

   The PERMISSIONS part tells what kind of access to the file should be
changed; it is zero or more of the following letters.  As with the
USERS part, the order does not matter when more than one letter is
given.  Omitting the PERMISSIONS part is useful only with the @{b}=@{ub}
operation, where it gives the specified USERS no access at all to the
file.

@{b}r@{ub}
     the permission the USERS have to read the file;

@{b}w@{ub}
     the permission the USERS have to write to the file;

@{b}x@{ub}
     the permission the USERS have to execute the file.

   For example, to give everyone permission to read and write a file,
but not to execute it, use:

     a=rw

   To remove write permission for from all users other than the file's
owner, use:

     go-w

The above command does not affect the access that the owner of the file
has to it, nor does it affect whether other users can read or execute
the file.

   To give everyone except a file's owner no permission to do anything
with that file, use the mode below.  Other users could still remove the
file, if they have write permission on the directory it is in.

     go=

Another way to specify the same thing is:

     og-rxw

@node "Copying Permissions" "fileutils.guide/Copying Permissions"
@next "Changing Special Permissions"
@prev "Setting Permissions"
@toc "Symbolic Modes"

Copying Existing Permissions
----------------------------

   You can base a file's permissions on its existing permissions.  To do
this, instead of using @{b}r@{ub}, @{b}w@{ub}, or @{b}x@{ub} after the operator, you use the
letter @{b}u@{ub}, @{b}g@{ub}, or @{b}o@{ub}.  For example, the mode
     o+g

adds the permissions for users who are in a file's group to the
permissions that other users have for the file.  Thus, if the file
started out as mode 664 (@{b}rw-rw-r--@{ub}), the above mode would change it to
mode 666 (@{b}rw-rw-rw-@{ub}).  If the file had started out as mode 741
(@{b}rwxr----x@{ub}), the above mode would change it to mode 745 (@{b}rwxr--r-x@{ub}).
The @{b}-@{ub} and @{b}=@{ub} operations work analogously.


@endnode

@node "Changing Special Permissions" "fileutils.guide/Changing Special Permissions"
@next "Conditional Executability"
@prev "Copying Permissions"
@toc "Symbolic Modes"

Changing Special Permissions
----------------------------

   In addition to changing a file's read, write, and execute
permissions, you can change its special permissions.  See
@{"Mode Structure" link "Mode Structure"}, for a summary of these permissions.

   To change a file's permission to set the user ID on execution, use @{b}u@{ub}
in the USERS part of the symbolic mode and @{b}s@{ub} in the PERMISSIONS part.

   To change a file's permission to set the group ID on execution, use
@{b}g@{ub} in the USERS part of the symbolic mode and @{b}s@{ub} in the PERMISSIONS part.

   To change a file's permission to stay permanently on the swap device,
use @{b}o@{ub} in the USERS part of the symbolic mode and @{b}t@{ub} in the PERMISSIONS
part.

   For example, to add set user ID permission to a program, you can use
the mode:

     u+s

   To remove both set user ID and set group ID permission from it, you
can use the mode:

     ug-s

   To cause a program to be saved on the swap device, you can use the
mode:

     o+t

   Remember that the special permissions only affect files that are
executable, plus, on some systems, directories (on which they have
different meanings; see @{"Mode Structure" link "Mode Structure"}).  Using @{b}a@{ub} in the USERS part of
a symbolic mode does not cause the special permissions to be affected;
thus,

     a+s

has @{i}no effect@{ui}.  You must use @{b}u@{ub}, @{b}g@{ub}, and @{b}o@{ub} explicitly to affect the
special permissions.  Also, the combinations @{b}u+t@{ub}, @{b}g+t@{ub}, and @{b}o+s@{ub} have no
effect.

   The @{b}=@{ub} operator is not very useful with special permissions; for
example, the mode:

     o=t

does cause the file to be saved on the swap device, but it also removes
all read, write, and execute permissions that users not in the file's
group might have had for it.


@endnode

@node "Conditional Executability" "fileutils.guide/Conditional Executability"
@next "Multiple Changes"
@prev "Changing Special Permissions"
@toc "Symbolic Modes"

Conditional Executability
-------------------------

   There is one more special type of symbolic permission: if you use @{b}X@{ub}
instead of @{b}x@{ub}, execute permission is affected only if the file already
had execute permission or is a directory.  It affects directories'
execute permission even if they did not initially have any execute
permissions set.

   For example, this mode:

     a+X

gives all users permission to execute files (or search directories) if
anyone could before.


@endnode

@node "Multiple Changes" "fileutils.guide/Multiple Changes"
@next "Umask and Protection"
@prev "Conditional Executability"
@toc "Symbolic Modes"

Making Multiple Changes
-----------------------

   The format of symbolic modes is actually more complex than described
above (see @{"Setting Permissions" link "Setting Permissions"}).  It provides two ways to make
multiple changes to files' permissions.

   The first way is to specify multiple OPERATION and PERMISSIONS parts
after a USERS part in the symbolic mode.

   For example, the mode:

     og+rX-w

gives users other than the owner of the file read permission and, if it
is a directory or if someone already had execute permission to it,
gives them execute permission; and it also denies them write permission
to it file.  It does not affect the permission that the owner of the
file has for it.  The above mode is equivalent to the two modes:

     og+rX
     og-w

   The second way to make multiple changes is to specify more than one
simple symbolic mode, separated by commas.  For example, the mode:

     a+r,go-w

gives everyone permission to read the file and removes write permission
on it for all users except its owner.  Another example:

     u=rwx,g=rx,o=

sets all of the non-special permissions for the file explicitly.  (It
gives users who are not in the file's group no permission at all for
it.)

   The two methods can be combined.  The mode:

     a+r,g+x-w

gives all users permission to read the file, and gives users who are in
the file's group permission to execute it, as well, but not permission
to write to it.  The above mode could be written in several different
ways; another is:

     u+r,g+rx,o+r,g-w


@endnode

@node "Umask and Protection" "fileutils.guide/Umask and Protection"
@prev "Multiple Changes"
@toc "Symbolic Modes"

The Umask and Protection
------------------------

   If the USERS part of a symbolic mode is omitted, it defaults to @{b}a@{ub}
(affect all users), except that any permissions that are @{i}set@{ui} in the
system variable @{b}umask@{ub} are @{i}not affected@{ui}.  The value of @{b}umask@{ub} can be set
using the @{b}umask@{ub} command.  Its default value varies from system to
system.

   Omitting the USERS part of a symbolic mode is generally not useful
with operations other than @{b}+@{ub}.  It is useful with @{b}+@{ub} because it allows
you to use @{b}umask@{ub} as an easily customizable protection against giving
away more permission to files than you intended to.

   As an example, if @{b}umask@{ub} has the value 2, which removes write
permission for users who are not in the file's group, then the mode:

     +w

adds permission to write to the file to its owner and to other users who
are in the file's group, but @{i}not@{ui} to other users.  In contrast, the mode:

     a+w

ignores @{b}umask@{ub}, and @{i}does@{ui} give write permission for the file to all users.

Numeric Modes
=============

   File permissions are stored internally as 16 bit integers.  As an
alternative to giving a symbolic mode, you can give an octal (base 8)
number that corresponds to the internal representation of the new mode.
This number is always interpreted in octal; you do not have to add a
leading 0, as you do in C.  Mode 0055 is the same as mode 55.

   A numeric mode is usually shorter than the corresponding symbolic
mode, but it is limited in that it can not take into account a file's
previous permissions; it can only set them absolutely.

   The permissions granted to the user, to other users in the file's
group, and to other users not in the file's group are each stored as
three bits, which are represented as one octal digit.  The three special
permissions are also each stored as one bit, and they are as a group
represented as another octal digit.  Here is how the bits are arranged
in the 16 bit integer, starting with the lowest valued bit:

     Value in  Corresponding
     Mode      Permission
     
               Other users not in the file's group:
        1      Execute
        2      Write
        4      Read
     
               Other users in the file's group:
       10      Execute
       20      Write
       40      Read
     
               The file's owner:
      100      Execute
      200      Write
      400      Read
     
               Special permissions:
     1000      Save text image on swap device
     2000      Set group ID on execution
     4000      Set user ID on execution

   For example, numeric mode 4755 corresponds to symbolic mode
@{b}u=rwxs,go=rx@{ub}, and numeric mode 664 corresponds to symbolic mode
@{b}ug=rw,o=r@{ub}.  Numeric mode 0 corresponds to symbolic mode @{b}ugo=@{ub}.

   First, a quote:

     Our units of temporal measurement, from seconds on up to months,
     are so complicated, asymmetrical and disjunctive so as to make
     coherent mental reckoning in time all but impossible.  Indeed, had
     some tyrannical god contrived to enslave our minds to time, to
     make it all but impossible for us to escape subjection to sodden
     routines and unpleasant surprises, he could hardly have done
     better than handing down our present system.  It is like a set of
     trapezoidal building blocks, with no vertical or horizontal
     surfaces, like a language in which the simplest thought demands
     ornate constructions, useless particles and lengthy
     circumlocutions.  Unlike the more successful patterns of language
     and science, which enable us to face experience boldly or at least
     level-headedly, our system of temporal calculation silently and
     persistently encourages our terror of time.

     ...  It is as though architects had to measure length in feet,
     width in meters and height in ells; as though basic instruction
     manuals demanded a knowledge of five different languages.  It is
     no wonder then that we often look into our own immediate past or
     future, last Tuesday or a week from Sunday, with feelings of
     helpless confusion.  ...

   This section describes the textual date representations that GNU
programs accept.  These are the strings you, as a user, can supply as
arguments to the various programs.  The C interface (via the @{b}getdate@{ub}
function) is not described here.

   Although the date syntax here can represent any possible time since
zero A.D., computer integers are not big enough for such a
(comparatively) long time.  The earliest date semantically allowed on
Unix systems is midnight, 1 January 1970 UCT.

General date syntax
===================

   A @{i}date@{ui} is a string, possibly empty, containing many items separated
by whitespace.  The whitespace may be omitted when no ambiguity arises.
The empty string means the beginning of today (i.e., midnight).  Order
of the items is immaterial.  A date string may contain many flavors of
items:

   * calendar date items

   * time of the day items

   * time zone items

   * day of the week items

   * relative items

   * pure numbers.

We describe each of these item types in turn, below.

   A few numbers may be written out in words in most contexts.  This is
most useful for specifying day of the week items or relative items (see
below).  Here is the list: @{b}first@{ub} for 1, @{b}next@{ub} for 2, @{b}third@{ub} for 3, @{b}fourth@{ub}
for 4, @{b}fifth@{ub} for 5, @{b}sixth@{ub} for 6, @{b}seventh@{ub} for 7, @{b}eighth@{ub} for 8, @{b}ninth@{ub} for
9, @{b}tenth@{ub} for 10, @{b}eleventh@{ub} for 11 and @{b}twelfth@{ub} for 12.  Also, @{b}last@{ub} means
exactly -1.

   When a month is written this way, it is still considered to be
written numerically, instead of being "spelled in full"; this changes
the allowed strings.

   Alphabetic case is completely ignored in dates.  Comments may be
introduced between round parentheses, as long as included parentheses
are properly nested.  Hyphens not followed by a digit are currently
ignored.  Leading zeros on numbers are ignored.

Calendar date item
==================

   A @{i}calendar date item@{ui} specifies a day of the year.  It is specified
differently, depending on whether the month is specified numerically or
literally.  All these strings specify the same calendar date:

     1970-09-17           # ISO 8601.
     70-9-17              # This century assumed by default.
     70-09-17             # Leading zeros are ignored.
     9/17/72              # Common U.S. writing.
     24 September 1972
     24 Sept 72           # September has a special abbreviation.
     24 Sep 72            # Three-letter abbreviations always allowed.
     Sep 24, 1972
     24-sep-72
     24sep72

   The year can also be omitted.  In this case, the last specified year
is used, or the current year if none.  For example:

     9/17
     sep 17

   Here are the rules.

   For numeric months, the ISO 8601 format @{b}YEAR-MONTH-DAY@{ub} is allowed,
where YEAR is any positive number, MONTH is a number between 01 and 12,
and DAY is a number between 01 and 31.  A leading zero must be present
if a number is less than ten.  If YEAR is less than 100, then 1900 is
added to it to force a date in this century.  The construct
@{b}MONTH/DAY/YEAR@{ub}, popular in the United States, is accepted.  Also
@{b}MONTH/DAY@{ub}, omitting the year.

   Literal months may be spelled out in full: @{b}January@{ub}, @{b}February@{ub}, @{b}March@{ub},
@{b}April@{ub}, @{b}May@{ub}, @{b}June@{ub}, @{b}July@{ub}, @{b}August@{ub}, @{b}September@{ub}, @{b}October@{ub}, @{b}November@{ub} or
@{b}December@{ub}.  Literal months may be abbreviated to their first three
letters, possibly followed by an abbreviating dot.  It is also
permitted to write @{b}Sept@{ub} instead of @{b}September@{ub}.

   When months are written literally, the calendar date may be given as
any of the following:

     DAY MONTH YEAR
     DAY MONTH
     MONTH DAY YEAR
     DAY-MONTH-YEAR

   Or, omitting the year:

     MONTH DAY

@next "Time zone item"

@toc "Date input formats"

Time of day item
================

   A @{i}time of day item@{ui} in date strings specifies the time on a given
day.  Here are some examples, all of which represent the same time:

     20:02:0
     20:02
     8:02pm
     20:02-0500      # In EST (Eastern U.S. Standard Time).

   More generally, the time of the day may be given as
@{b}HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND@{ub}, where HOUR is a number between 0 and 23, MINUTE is
a number between 0 and 59, and SECOND is a number between 0 and 59.
Alternatively, @{b}:SECOND@{ub} can be omitted, in which case it is taken to be
zero.

   If the time is followed by @{b}am@{ub} or @{b}pm@{ub} (or @{b}a.m.@{ub} or @{b}p.m.@{ub}), HOUR is
restricted to run from 1 to 12, and @{b}:MINUTE@{ub} may be omitted (taken to be
zero).  @{b}am@{ub} indicates the first half of the day, @{b}pm@{ub} indicates the second
half of the day.  In this notation, 12 is the predecessor of 1:
midnight is @{b}12am@{ub} while noon is @{b}12pm@{ub}.

   The time may alternatively be followed by a time zone correction,
expressed as @{b}SHHMM@{ub}, where S is @{b}+@{ub} or @{b}-@{ub}, HH is a number of zone hours and
MM is a number of zone minutes.  When a time zone correction is given
this way, it forces interpretation of the time relative to Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC), overriding any previous specification for the
time zone or the local time zone.  The MINUTE part of the time of the
day may not be elided when a time zone correction is used.  This is the
only way to specify a time zone correction by fractional parts of an
hour.

   Either @{b}am@{ub}/@{b}pm@{ub} or a time zone correction may be specified, but not
both.

Time zone item
==============

   A @{i}time zone item@{ui} specifies an international time zone, indicated by
a small set of letters.  They are supported for backward compatibility
reasons, but they are not recommended because they are ambiguous in
practice: for example, the abbreviation @{b}EST@{ub} has different meanings in
Australia and the United States.  Any included period is ignored.
Military time zone designations use a single letter.  Currently, only
integral zone hours may be represented in a time zone item.  See the
previous section for a finer control over the time zone correction.

   Here are many non-daylight-saving-time time zones, indexed by the
zone hour value.

Day of week item
================

   The explicit mention of a day of the week will forward the date
(only if necessary) to reach that day of the week in the future.

   Days of the week may be spelled out in full: @{b}Sunday@{ub}, @{b}Monday@{ub},
@{b}Tuesday@{ub}, @{b}Wednesday@{ub}, @{b}Thursday@{ub}, @{b}Friday@{ub} or @{b}Saturday@{ub}.  Days may be
abbreviated to their first three letters, optionally followed by a
period.  The special abbreviations @{b}Tues@{ub} for @{b}Tuesday@{ub}, @{b}Wednes@{ub} for
@{b}Wednesday@{ub} and @{b}Thur@{ub} or @{b}Thurs@{ub} for @{b}Thursday@{ub} are also allowed.

   A number may precede a day of the week item to move forward
supplementary weeks.  It is best used in expression like @{b}third monday@{ub}.
In this context, @{b}last DAY@{ub} or @{b}next DAY@{ub} is also acceptable; they move one
week before or after the day that DAY by itself would represent.

   A comma following a day of the week item is ignored.

@node "Relative item in date strings" "fileutils.guide/Relative item in date strings"

@toc "Date input formats"

Relative item in date strings
=============================

@{i}   Relative items@{ui} adjust a date (or the current date if none) forward
or backward.  The effects of relative items accumulate.  Here are some
examples:

     1 year
     1 year ago
     3 years
     2 days

   The unit of time displacement may be selected by the string @{b}year@{ub} or
@{b}month@{ub} for moving by whole years or months.  These are fuzzy units, as
years and months are not all of equal duration.  More precise units are
@{b}fortnight@{ub} which is worth 14 days, @{b}week@{ub} worth 7 days, @{b}day@{ub} worth 24
hours, @{b}hour@{ub} worth 60 minutes, @{b}minute@{ub} or @{b}min@{ub} worth 60 seconds, and
@{b}second@{ub} or @{b}sec@{ub} worth one second.  An @{b}s@{ub} suffix on these units is accepted
and ignored.

   The unit of time may be preceded by a multiplier, given as an
optionally signed number.  Unsigned numbers are taken as positively
signed.  No number at all implies 1 for a multiplier.  Following a
relative item by the string @{b}ago@{ub} is equivalent to preceding the unit by a
multiplicator with value -1.

   The string @{b}tomorrow@{ub} is worth one day in the future (equivalent to
@{b}day@{ub}), the string @{b}yesterday@{ub} is worth one day in the past (equivalent to
@{b}day ago@{ub}).

   The strings @{b}now@{ub} or @{b}today@{ub} are relative items corresponding to
zero-valued time displacement, these strings come from the fact a
zero-valued time displacement represents the current time when not
otherwise change by previous items.  They may be used to stress other
items, like in @{b}12:00 today@{ub}.  The string @{b}this@{ub} also has the meaning of a
zero-valued time displacement, but is preferred in date strings like
@{b}this thursday@{ub}.

   When a relative item makes the resulting date to cross the boundary
between DST and non-DST (or vice-versa), the hour is adjusted according
to the local time.

Pure numbers in date strings
============================

   The precise intepretation of a pure decimal number is dependent of
the context in the date string.

   If the decimal number is of the form YYYYMMDD and no other calendar
date item (see @{"Calendar date item" link "Calendar date item"}) appears before it in the date
string, then YYYY is read as the year, MM as the month number and DD as
the day of the month, for the specified calendar date.

   If the decimal number is of the form HHMM and no other time of day
item appears before it in the date string, then HH is read as the hour
of the day and MM as the minute of the hour, for the specified time of
the day.  MM can also be omitted.

   If both a calendar date and a time of day appear to the left of a
number in the date string, but no relative item, then the number
overrides the year.

Authors of @{b}getdate@{ub}
==================

@{b}   getdate@{ub} was originally implemented by Steven M. Bellovin
(<smb@research.att.com>) while at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.  The code was later tweaked by a couple of people on
Usenet, then completely overhauled by Rich $alz (<rsalz@bbn.com>) and
Jim Berets (<jberets@bbn.com>) in August, 1990.  Various revisions for
the GNU system were made by David MacKenzie, Jim Meyering, and others.

   This chapter was originally produced by Franc,ois Pinard
(<pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>) from the @{b}getdate.y@{ub} source code, and then
edited by K. Berry (<kb@cs.umb.edu>).

   This chapter describes the @{b}ls@{ub} command and its variants @{b}dir@{ub} and @{b}vdir@{ub},
which list information about files.

@{b}ls@{ub}: List directory contents
===========================

   The @{b}ls@{ub} program lists information about files (of any type, including
directories).  Options and file arguments can be intermixed
arbitrarily, as usual.

   For non-option command-line arguments that are directories, by
default @{b}ls@{ub} lists the contents of directories, not recursively, and
omitting files with names beginning with @{b}.@{ub}.  For other non-option
arguments, by default @{b}ls@{ub} lists just the file name.  If no non-option
arguments are specified, @{b}ls@{ub} lists the contents of the current directory.

   By default, the output is sorted alphabetically.  If standard output
is a terminal, the output is in columns (sorted vertically) and control
characters are output as question marks; otherwise, the output is listed
one per line and control characters are output as-is.

   Because @{b}ls@{ub} is such a fundamental program, it has accumulated many
options over the years.  They are described in the subsections below;
within each section, options are listed alphabetically (ignoring case).
The division of options into the subsections is not absolute, since some
options affect more than one aspect of @{b}ls@{ub}'s operation.

   The @{b}-g@{ub} option is accepted but ignored, for compatibility with Unix.
Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

Which files are listed
----------------------

   These options determine which files @{b}ls@{ub} lists information for.  By
default, any files and the contents of any directories on the command
line are shown.

@{b}-a@{ub}
@{b}--all@{ub}
     List all files in directories, including files that start with @{b}.@{ub}.

@{b}-A@{ub}
@{b}--almost-all@{ub}
     List all files in directories except for @{b}.@{ub} and @{b}..@{ub}.

@{b}-B@{ub}
@{b}--ignore-backups@{ub}
     Do not list files that end with @{b}~@{ub}, unless they are given on the
     command line.

@{b}-d@{ub}
@{b}--directory@{ub}
     List just the names of directories, as with other types of files,
     rather than listing their contents.

@{b}-I PATTERN@{ub}
@{b}--ignore=PATTERN@{ub}
     Do not list files whose names match the shell pattern (not regular
     expression) PATTERN unless they are given on the command line.  As
     in the shell, an initial @{b}.@{ub} in a file name does not match a
     wildcard at the start of PATTERN.  Sometimes it is useful to give
     this option several times.  For example,

          $ ls --ignore='.??*' --ignore='.[^.]' --ignore='#*'

     The first option ignores names of length 3 or more that start with
     @{b}.@{ub}, the second ignores all two-character names that start with @{b}.@{ub}
     except @{b}..@{ub}, and the third ignores names that start with @{b}#@{ub}.

@{b}-L@{ub}
@{b}--dereference@{ub}
     In a long listing, show file information (e.g., times and
     permissions) for the referents of symbolic links rather than for
     the symbolic links themselves.

@{b}-R@{ub}
@{b}--recursive@{ub}
     List the contents of all directories recursively.

What information is listed
--------------------------

   These options affect the information that @{b}ls@{ub} displays.  By default,
only file names are shown.

@{b}-D@{ub}
@{b}--dired@{ub}
     With the long listing (@{b}-l@{ub}) format, print an additional line after
     the main output:

          //DIRED// BEG1 END1 BEG2 END2 ...

     The BEGN and ENDN are unsigned integers that record the byte
     position of the beginning and end of each file name in the output.
     This makes it easy for Emacs to find the names, even when they
     contain unusual characters such as space or newline, without fancy
     searching.

     If directories are being listed recursively (@{b}-R@{ub}), output a similar
     line after each subdirectory:
          //SUBDIRED// FORMAT BEG1 END1 ...

     Finally, output a line of the form:
          //DIRED-OPTIONS// --quoting-style=WORD
     where WORD is the quoting style (see @{"Formatting the file names" link "Formatting the file names"}).

@{b}-G@{ub}
@{b}--no-group@{ub}
     Inhibit display of group information in a long format directory
     listing.  (This is the default in some non-GNU versions of @{b}ls@{ub}, so
     we provide this option for compatibility.)

@{b}-h@{ub}
@{b}--human-readable@{ub}
     Append a size letter such as @{b}M@{ub} for megabytes to each size.  Powers
     of 1024 are used, not 1000; @{b}M@{ub} stands for 1,048,576 bytes.  Use the
     @{b}-H@{ub} or @{b}--si@{ub} option if you prefer powers of 1000.

@{b}-H@{ub}
@{b}--si@{ub}
     Append a size letter such as @{b}M@{ub} for megabytes to each size.  (SI is
     the International System of Units, which defines these letters as
     prefixes.)  Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; @{b}M@{ub} stands for
     1,000,000 bytes.  Use the @{b}-h@{ub} or @{b}--human-readable@{ub} option if you
     prefer powers of 1024.

@{b}-i@{ub}
@{b}--inode@{ub}
     Print the inode number (also called the file serial number and
     index number) of each file to the left of the file name.  (This
     number uniquely identifies each file within a particular
     filesystem.)

@{b}-l@{ub}
@{b}--format=long@{ub}
@{b}--format=verbose@{ub}
     In addition to the name of each file, print the file type,
     permissions, number of hard links, owner name, group name, size in
     bytes, and timestamp (by default, the modification time).  For
     files with a time more than six months old or more than one hour
     into the future, the timestamp contains the year instead of the
     time of day.

     For each directory that is listed, preface the files with a line
     @{b}total BLOCKS@{ub}, where BLOCKS is the total disk allocation for all
     files in that directory.  The block size currently defaults to 1024
     bytes, but this can be overridden (see @{"Block size" link "Block size"}).  The BLOCKS
     computed counts each hard link separately; this is arguably a
     deficiency.

     The permissions listed are similar to symbolic mode specifications
     (see @{"Symbolic Modes" link "Symbolic Modes"}).  But @{b}ls@{ub} combines multiple bits into the
     third character of each set of permissions as follows:
    @{b}s@{ub}
          If the setuid or setgid bit and the corresponding executable
          bit are both set.

    @{b}S@{ub}
          If the setuid or setgid bit is set but the corresponding
          executable bit is not set.

    @{b}t@{ub}
          If the sticky bit and the other-executable bit are both set.

    @{b}T@{ub}
          If the sticky bit is set but the other-executable bit is not
          set.

    @{b}x@{ub}
          If the executable bit is set and none of the above apply.

    @{b}-@{ub}
          Otherwise.

@{b}-o@{ub}
     Produce long format directory listings, but don't display group
     information.  It is equivalent to using @{b}--format=long@{ub} with
     @{b}--no-group@{ub} .  This option is provided for compatibility with other
     versions of @{b}ls@{ub}.

@{b}-s@{ub}
@{b}--size@{ub}
     Print the disk allocation of each file to the left of the file
     name.  This is the amount of disk space used by the file, which is
     usually a bit more than the file's size, but it can be less if the
     file has holes.

     Normally the disk allocation is printed in units of 1024 bytes,
     but this can be overridden (see @{"Block size" link "Block size"}).

     For files that are NFS-mounted from an HP-UX system to a BSD
     system, this option reports sizes that are half the correct
     values.  On HP-UX systems, it reports sizes that are twice the
     correct values for files that are NFS-mounted from BSD systems.
     This is due to a flaw in HP-UX; it also affects the HP-UX @{b}ls@{ub}
     program.

@toc "ls invocation"

Sorting the output
------------------

   These options change the order in which @{b}ls@{ub} sorts the information it
outputs.  By default, sorting is done by character code (e.g., ASCII
order).

@{b}-c@{ub}
     Sort according to the status change time (the @{b}ctime@{ub} in the inode).
     If the long listing format (@{b}-l@{ub}) is being used, print the status
     change time instead of the modification time.

@{b}-f@{ub}
     Primarily, like @{b}-U@{ub}--do not sort; list the files in whatever order
     they are stored in the directory.  But also enable @{b}-a@{ub} (list all
     files) and disable @{b}-l@{ub}, @{b}--color@{ub}, and @{b}-s@{ub} (if they were specified
     before the @{b}-f@{ub}).

@{b}-r@{ub}
@{b}--reverse@{ub}
     Reverse whatever the sorting method is--e.g., list files in reverse
     alphabetical order, youngest first, smallest first, or whatever.

@{b}-S@{ub}
@{b}--sort=size@{ub}
     Sort by file size, largest first.

@{b}-t@{ub}
@{b}--sort=time@{ub}
     Sort by modification time (the @{b}mtime@{ub} in the inode), newest first.

@{b}-u@{ub}
     Sort by access time (the @{b}atime@{ub} in the inode).  If the long listing
     format is being used, print the last access time.

@{b}--time=atime@{ub}
@{b}--time=access@{ub}
     When used with @{b}--sort=time@{ub} (@{b}-t@{ub}), this is equivalent to @{b}-u@{ub}.  With
     options that print times (e.g., @{b}--format=long@{ub}), print each file's
     time of last access, rather than its time of last modification.

@{b}--time=ctime@{ub}
@{b}--time=status@{ub}
@{b}--time=use@{ub}
     When used with @{b}--sort=time@{ub} (@{b}-t@{ub}), this is equivalent to @{b}-c@{ub}.  With
     options that print times (e.g., @{b}--format=long@{ub}), print each file's
     time of last inode change, rather than its time of last
     modification.

@{b}-U@{ub}
@{b}--sort=none@{ub}
     Do not sort; list the files in whatever order they are stored in
     the directory.  (Do not do any of the other unrelated things that
     @{b}-f@{ub} does.)  This is especially useful when listing very large
     directories, since not doing any sorting can be noticeably faster.

@{b}-v@{ub}
@{b}--sort=version@{ub}
     Sort by version name and number, lowest first.  It behaves like a
     default sort, excepted that each sequence of decimal digits is
     treated numericaly as an index/version number.  (See
     @{"More details about version sort" link "More details about version sort"}.)

@{b}-X@{ub}
@{b}--sort=extension@{ub}
     Sort directory contents alphabetically by file extension
     (characters after the last @{b}.@{ub}); files with no extension are sorted
     first.

More details about version sort
-------------------------------

   The version sort takes into account the fact that file names
frequently include indices or version numbers.  Standard sorting
functions usually do not produce the ordering that people expect
because comparisons are made on a character-by-character basis.  The
version sort adresses this problem, and is especially useful when
browsing directories that contain many files with indices/version
numbers in their names:

           > ls -1            > ls -1v
           foo.zml-1.gz       foo.zml-1.gz
           foo.zml-100.gz     foo.zml-2.gz
           foo.zml-12.gz      foo.zml-6.gz
           foo.zml-13.gz      foo.zml-12.gz
           foo.zml-2.gz       foo.zml-13.gz
           foo.zml-25.gz      foo.zml-25.gz
           foo.zml-6.gz       foo.zml-100.gz

   Note also that numeric parts with leading zeroes are considered as
fractional one:

           > ls -1            > ls -1v
           abc-1.007.tgz      abc-1.007.tgz
           abc-1.012b.tgz     abc-1.01a.tgz
           abc-1.01a.tgz      abc-1.012b.tgz

General output formatting
-------------------------

   These options affect the appearance of the overall output.

@{b}-1@{ub}
@{b}--format=single-column@{ub}
     List one file per line.  This is the default for @{b}ls@{ub} when standard
     output is not a terminal.

@{b}-C@{ub}
@{b}--format=vertical@{ub}
     List files in columns, sorted vertically.  This is the default for
     @{b}ls@{ub} if standard output is a terminal.  It is always the default for
     the @{b}dir@{ub} and @{b}d@{ub} programs.  GNU @{b}ls@{ub} uses variable width columns to
     display as many files as possible in the fewest lines.

@{b}--color [=WHEN]@{ub}
     Specify whether to use color for distinguishing file types.  WHEN
     may be omitted, or one of:
        * none Do not use color at all.  This is the default.

        * auto Only use color if standard output is a terminal.

        * always Always use color.  Specifying @{b}--color@{ub} and no WHEN is
     equivalent to @{b}--color=always@{ub}.

@{b}-F@{ub}
@{b}--classify@{ub}
@{b}--indicator-style=classify@{ub}
     Append a character to each file name indicating the file type.
     Also, for regular files that are executable, append @{b}*@{ub}.  The file
     type indicators are @{b}/@{ub} for directories, @{b}\@@{ub} for symbolic links, @{b}|@{ub} for
     FIFOs, @{b}=@{ub} for sockets, and nothing for regular files.

@{b}--full-time@{ub}
     List times in full, rather than using the standard abbreviation
     heuristics.  The format is the same as @{b}date@{ub}'s default; it's not
     possible to change this, but you can extract out the date string
     with @{b}cut@{ub} and then pass the result to @{b}date -d@{ub}.  See
     @{"date invocation" link "sh-utils.guide/date invocation"}.

     This is most useful because the time output includes the seconds.
     (Unix filesystems store file timestamps only to the nearest
     second, so this option shows all the information there is.)  For
     example, this can help when you have a Makefile that is not
     regenerating files properly.

@{b}--indicator-style=WORD@{ub}
     Append a character indicator with style WORD to entry names, as
     follows:
    @{b}none@{ub}
          Do not append any character indicator; this is the default.

    @{b}file-type@{ub}
          Append @{b}/@{ub} for directories, @{b}\@@{ub} for symbolic links, @{b}|@{ub} for FIFOs, @{b}=@{ub}
          for sockets, and nothing for regular files.  This is the same
          as the @{b}-p@{ub} or @{b}--file-type@{ub} option.

    @{b}classify@{ub}
          Append @{b}*@{ub} for executable regular files, otherwise behave as for
          @{b}file-type@{ub}.  This is the same as the @{b}-F@{ub} or @{b}--classify@{ub} option.

@{b}-k@{ub}
@{b}--kilobytes@{ub}
     Print file sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block
     size (see @{"Block size" link "Block size"}).

@{b}-m@{ub}
@{b}--format=commas@{ub}
     List files horizontally, with as many as will fit on each line,
     separated by @{b}, @{ub} (a comma and a space).

@{b}-n@{ub}
@{b}--numeric-uid-gid@{ub}
     List the numeric UID and GID instead of the names.

@{b}-p@{ub}
@{b}--file-type@{ub}
@{b}--indicator-style=file-type@{ub}
     Append a character to each file name indicating the file type.
     This is like @{b}-F@{ub}, except that executables are not marked.

@{b}-x FORMAT@{ub}
@{b}--format=across@{ub}
@{b}--format=horizontal@{ub}
     List the files in columns, sorted horizontally.

@{b}-T COLS@{ub}
@{b}--tabsize=COLS@{ub}
     Assume that each tabstop is COLS columns wide.  The default is 8.
     @{b}ls@{ub} uses tabs where possible in the output, for efficiency.  If
     COLS is zero, do not use tabs at all.

@{b}-w@{ub}
@{b}--width=COLS@{ub}
     Assume the screen is COLS columns wide.  The default is taken from
     the terminal settings if possible; otherwise the environment
     variable @{b}COLUMNS@{ub} is used if it is set; otherwise the default is 80.

Formatting the file names
-------------------------

   These options change how file names themselves are printed.

@{b}-b@{ub}
@{b}--escape@{ub}
@{b}--quoting-style=escape@{ub}
     Quote nongraphic characters in file names using alphabetic and
     octal backslash sequences like those used in C.

@{b}-N@{ub}
@{b}--literal@{ub}
     Do not quote file names.

@{b}-q@{ub}
@{b}--hide-control-chars@{ub}
     Print question marks instead of nongraphic characters in file
     names.  This is the default if the output is a terminal and the
     program is @{b}ls@{ub}.

@{b}-Q@{ub}
@{b}--quote-name@{ub}
@{b}--quoting-style=c@{ub}
     Enclose file names in double quotes and quote nongraphic
     characters as in C.

@{b}--quoting-style=WORD@{ub}
     Use style WORD to quote output names.  The WORD should be one of
     the following:
    @{b}literal@{ub}
          Output names as-is.

    @{b}shell@{ub}
          Quote names for the shell if they contain shell
          metacharacters or would cause ambiguous output.

    @{b}shell-always@{ub}
          Quote names for the shell, even if they would normally not
          require quoting.

    @{b}c@{ub}
          Quote names as for a C language string; this is the same as
          the @{b}-Q@{ub} or @{b}--quote-name@{ub} option.

    @{b}escape@{ub}
          Quote as with @{b}c@{ub} except omit the surrounding double-quote
          characters; this is the same as the @{b}-b@{ub} or @{b}--escape@{ub} option.

     You can specify the default value of the @{b}--quoting-style@{ub} option
     with the environment variable @{b}QUOTING_STYLE@{ub}.  If that environment
     variable is not set, the default value is @{b}literal@{ub}, but this
     default may change to @{b}shell@{ub} in a future version of this package.

@{b}--show-control-chars@{ub}
     Print nongraphic characters as-is in file names.  This is the
     default unless the output is a terminal and the program is @{b}ls@{ub}.

@{b}cp@{ub}: Copy files and directories
==============================

@{b}   cp@{ub} copies files (or, optionally, directories).  The copy is
completely independent of the original.  You can either copy one file to
another, or copy arbitrarily many files to a destination directory.
Synopsis:

     cp [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST
     cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY

   If the last argument names an existing directory, @{b}cp@{ub} copies each
SOURCE file into that directory (retaining the same name).  Otherwise,
if only two files are given, it copies the first onto the second.  It
is an error if the last argument is not a directory and more than two
non-option arguments are given.

   Generally, files are written just as they are read.  For exceptions,
see the @{b}--sparse@{ub} option below.

   By default, @{b}cp@{ub} does not copy directories (see @{b}-r@{ub} below).

@{b}   cp@{ub} generally refuses to copy a file onto itself, with the following
exception: if @{b}--force --backup@{ub} is specified with SOURCE and DEST
identical, and referring to a regular file, @{b}cp@{ub} will make a backup file,
either regular or numbered, as specified in the usual ways (see
@{"Backup options" link "Backup options"}).  This is useful when you simply want to make a
backup of an existing file before changing it.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-a@{ub}
@{b}--archive@{ub}
     Preserve as much as possible of the structure and attributes of the
     original files in the copy (but do not preserve directory
     structure).  Equivalent to @{b}-dpR@{ub}.

@{b}-b@{ub}
@{b}--backup@{ub}
     Make a backup of each file that would otherwise be overwritten or
     removed.  See @{"Backup options" link "Backup options"}.

@{b}-d@{ub}
@{b}--no-dereference@{ub}
     Copy symbolic links as symbolic links rather than copying the
     files that they point to, and preserve hard links between source
     files in the copies.

@{b}-f@{ub}
@{b}--force@{ub}
     Remove existing destination files.

@{b}-i@{ub}
@{b}--interactive@{ub}
     Prompt whether to overwrite existing regular destination files.

@{b}-l@{ub}
@{b}--link@{ub}
     Make hard links instead of copies of non-directories.

@{b}-p@{ub}
@{b}--preserve@{ub}
     Preserve the original files' owner, group, permissions, and
     timestamps.

@{b}-P@{ub}
@{b}--parents@{ub}
     Form the name of each destination file by appending to the target
     directory a slash and the specified name of the source file.  The
     last argument given to @{b}cp@{ub} must be the name of an existing
     directory.  For example, the command:

          cp --parents a/b/c existing_dir

     copies the file @{b}a/b/c@{ub} to @{b}existing_dir/a/b/c@{ub}, creating any missing
     intermediate directories.

@{b}-r@{ub}
     Copy directories recursively, copying any non-directories and
     non-symbolic links (that is, FIFOs and special files) as if they
     were regular files.  This means trying to read the data in each
     source file and writing it to the destination.  It is usually a
     mistake to apply @{b}cp -r@{ub} to special files like FIFOs and the ones
     typically found in the @{b}/dev@{ub} directory.  In most cases, @{b}cp -r@{ub} will
     hang indefinitely trying to read from FIFOs and special files like
     @{b}/dev/console@{ub}, and it will fill up your destination disk if you use
     it to copy @{b}/dev/zero@{ub}.  Use the @{b}--recursive@{ub} (@{b}-R@{ub}) option instead if
     you want to copy special files, preserving their special nature
     rather than reading from them to copy their contents.

@{b}-R@{ub}
@{b}--recursive@{ub}
     Copy directories recursively, preserving non-directories (contrast
     with @{b}-r@{ub} just above).

@{b}--sparse=WHEN@{ub}
     A @{i}sparse file@{ui} contains @{i}holes@{ui}--a sequence of zero bytes that does
     not occupy any physical disk blocks; the @{b}read@{ub} system call reads
     these as zeroes.  This can both save considerable disk space and
     increase speed, since many binary files contain lots of
     consecutive zero bytes.  By default, @{b}cp@{ub} detects holes in input
     source files via a crude heuristic and makes the corresponding
     output file sparse as well.

     The WHEN value can be one of the following:
    @{b}auto@{ub}
          The default behavior: the output file is sparse if the input
          file is sparse.

    @{b}always@{ub}
          Always make the output file sparse.  This is useful when the
          input file resides on a filesystem that does not support
          sparse files (the most notable example is @{b}efs@{ub} filesystems in
          SGI IRIX 5.3 and earlier), but the output file is on another
          type of filesystem.

    @{b}never@{ub}
          Never make the output file sparse.  If you find an
          application for this option, let us know.

@{b}-s@{ub}
@{b}--symbolic-link@{ub}
     Make symbolic links instead of copies of non-directories.  All
     source file names must be absolute (starting with @{b}/@{ub}) unless the
     destination files are in the current directory.  This option merely
     results in an error message on systems that do not support
     symbolic links.

@{b}-S SUFFIX@{ub}
@{b}--suffix=SUFFIX@{ub}
     Append SUFFIX to each backup file made with @{b}-b@{ub}.  See
     @{"Backup options" link "Backup options"}.

@{b}-u@{ub}
@{b}--update@{ub}
     Do not copy a nondirectory that has an existing destination with
     the same or newer modification time.

@{b}-v@{ub}
@{b}--verbose@{ub}

@{b}-V METHOD@{ub}

@{b}dd@{ub}: Convert and copy a file
===========================

@{b}   dd@{ub} copies a file (from standard input to standard output, by
default) with a changeable I/O block size, while optionally performing
conversions on it.  Synopsis:

     dd [OPTION]...

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

   The numeric-valued options below (BYTES and BLOCKS) can be followed
by a multiplier: @{b}b@{ub}=512, @{b}c@{ub}=1, @{b}w@{ub}=2, @{b}xM@{ub}=M, or any of the standard block
size suffixes like @{b}k@{ub}=1024 (see @{"Block size" link "Block size"}).

@{b}if=FILE@{ub}
     Read from FILE instead of standard input.

@{b}of=FILE@{ub}
     Write to FILE instead of standard output.  Unless @{b}conv=notrunc@{ub} is
     given, @{b}dd@{ub} truncates FILE to zero bytes (or the size specified with
     @{b}seek=@{ub}).

@{b}ibs=BYTES@{ub}
     Read BYTES bytes at a time.

@{b}obs=BYTES@{ub}
     Write BYTES bytes at a time.

@{b}bs=BYTES@{ub}
     Both read and write BYTES bytes at a time.  This overrides @{b}ibs@{ub} and
     @{b}obs@{ub}.

@{b}cbs=BYTES@{ub}
     Convert BYTES bytes at a time.

@{b}skip=BLOCKS@{ub}
     Skip BLOCKS @{b}ibs@{ub}-byte blocks in the input file before copying.

@{b}seek=BLOCKS@{ub}
     Skip BLOCKS @{b}obs@{ub}-byte blocks in the output file before copying.

@{b}count=BLOCKS@{ub}
     Copy BLOCKS @{b}ibs@{ub}-byte blocks from the input file, instead of
     everything until the end of the file.

@{b}conv=CONVERSION[,CONVERSION]...@{ub}
     Convert the file as specified by the CONVERSION argument(s).  (No
     spaces around any comma(s).)

     Conversions:

    @{b}ascii@{ub}
          Convert EBCDIC to ASCII.

    @{b}ebcdic@{ub}
          Convert ASCII to EBCDIC.

    @{b}ibm@{ub}
          Convert ASCII to alternate EBCDIC.

    @{b}block@{ub}
          For each line in the input, output @{b}cbs@{ub} bytes, replacing the
          input newline with a space and padding with spaces as
          necessary.

    @{b}unblock@{ub}
          Replace trailing spaces in each @{b}cbs@{ub}-sized input block with a
          newline.

    @{b}lcase@{ub}
          Change uppercase letters to lowercase.

    @{b}ucase@{ub}
          Change lowercase letters to uppercase.

    @{b}swab@{ub}
          Swap every pair of input bytes.  GNU @{b}dd@{ub}, unlike others, works
          when an odd number of bytes are read--the last byte is simply
          copied (since there is nothing to swap it with).

    @{b}noerror@{ub}
          Continue after read errors.

    @{b}notrunc@{ub}
          Do not truncate the output file.

    @{b}sync@{ub}
          Pad every input block to size of @{b}ibs@{ub} with trailing zero bytes.

@{b}install@{ub}: Copy files and set attributes
======================================

@{b}   install@{ub} copies files while setting their permission modes and, if
possible, their owner and group.  Synopses:

     install [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST
     install [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
     install -d [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...

   In the first of these, the SOURCE file is copied to the DEST target
file.  In the second, each of the SOURCE files are copied to the
destination DIRECTORY.  In the last, each DIRECTORY (and any missing
parent directories) is created.

@{b}   install@{ub} is similar to @{b}cp@{ub}, but allows you to control the attributes
of destination files.  It is typically used in Makefiles to copy
programs into their destination directories.  It refuses to copy files
onto themselves.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-b@{ub}
@{b}--backup@{ub}
     Make a backup of each file that would otherwise be overwritten or
     removed.  See @{"Backup options" link "Backup options"}.

@{b}-c@{ub}
     Ignored; for compatibility with old Unix versions of @{b}install@{ub}.

@{b}-d@{ub}
@{b}--directory@{ub}
     Create each given directory and any missing parent directories,
     setting the owner, group and mode as given on the command line or
     to the defaults.  It also gives any parent directories it creates
     those attributes.  (This is different from the SunOS 4.x @{b}install@{ub},
     which gives directories that it creates the default attributes.)

@{b}-g GROUP@{ub}
@{b}--group=GROUP@{ub}
     Set the group ownership of installed files or directories to
     GROUP. The default is the process's current group.  GROUP may be
     either a group name or a numeric group id.

@{b}-m MODE@{ub}
@{b}--mode=MODE@{ub}
     Set the permissions for the installed file or directory to MODE,
     which can be either an octal number, or a symbolic mode as in
     @{b}chmod@{ub}, with 0 as the point of departure (see @{"File permissions" link "File permissions"}).
     The default mode is 0755--read, write, and execute for the owner,
     and read and execute for group and other.

@{b}-o OWNER@{ub}
@{b}--owner=OWNER@{ub}
     If @{b}install@{ub} has appropriate privileges (is run as root), set the
     ownership of installed files or directories to OWNER. The default
     is @{b}root@{ub}.  OWNER may be either a user name or a numeric user ID.

@{b}-l LOGFILE@{ub}
@{b}--log=LOGILE@{ub}
     Create a log file with name, size and date of all installed files.
     LOGFILE should be a path like /var/install-logs/fileutils-3.13.

@{b}-p@{ub}
@{b}--preserve-timestamps@{ub}
     Set the time of last access and the time of last modification of
     each installed file to match those of each corresponding original
     file.  When a file is installed without this option, its last
     access and last modification times are both set to the time of
     installation.  This option is useful if you want to use the last
     modification times of installed files to keep track of when they
     were last built as opposed to when they were last installed.

@{b}-s@{ub}
@{b}--strip@{ub}
     Strip the symbol tables from installed binary executables.

@{b}-S SUFFIX@{ub}
@{b}--suffix=SUFFIX@{ub}
     Append SUFFIX to each backup file made with @{b}-b@{ub}.  See
     @{"Backup options" link "Backup options"}.

@{b}-v@{ub}
@{b}--verbose@{ub}
     Print the name of each file before copying it.

@{b}-V METHOD@{ub}
@{b}--version-control=METHOD@{ub}
     Change the type of backups made with @{b}-b@{ub}.  The METHOD argument can
     be @{b}numbered@{ub} (or @{b}t@{ub}), @{b}existing@{ub} (or @{b}nil@{ub}), or @{b}never@{ub} (or @{b}simple@{ub}).  See

@{b}mv@{ub}: Move (rename) files
=======================

@{b}   mv@{ub} moves or renames files (or directories).  Synopsis:

     mv [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST
     mv [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY

   If the last argument names an existing directory, @{b}mv@{ub} moves each
other given file into a file with the same name in that directory.
Otherwise, if only two files are given, it renames the first as the
second.  It is an error if the last argument is not a directory and
more than two files are given.

@{b}   mv@{ub} can move only regular files across filesystems.

   If a destination file exists but is normally unwritable, standard
input is a terminal, and the @{b}-f@{ub} or @{b}--force@{ub} option is not given, @{b}mv@{ub}
prompts the user for whether to replace the file.  (You might own the
file, or have write permission on its directory.)  If the response does
not begin with @{b}y@{ub} or @{b}Y@{ub}, the file is skipped.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-b@{ub}
@{b}--backup@{ub}
     Make a backup of each file that would otherwise be overwritten or
     removed.  See @{"Backup options" link "Backup options"}.

@{b}-f@{ub}
@{b}--force@{ub}
     Remove existing destination files and never prompt the user.

@{b}-i@{ub}
@{b}--interactive@{ub}
     Prompt whether to overwrite each existing destination file,
     regardless of its permissions.  If the response does not begin
     with @{b}y@{ub} or @{b}Y@{ub}, the file is skipped.

@{b}-u@{ub}
@{b}--update@{ub}
     Do not move a nondirectory that has an existing destination with
     the same or newer modification time.

@{b}-v@{ub}
@{b}--verbose@{ub}
     Print the name of each file before moving it.

@{b}-S SUFFIX@{ub}

     @{"Backup options" link "Backup options"}.

@{b}-V METHOD@{ub}
@{b}--version-control=METHOD@{ub}
     Change the type of backups made with @{b}-b@{ub}.  The METHOD argument can
     be @{b}numbered@{ub} (or @{b}t@{ub}), @{b}existing@{ub} (or @{b}nil@{ub}), or @{b}never@{ub} (or @{b}simple@{ub}).  See

@{b}rm@{ub}: Remove files or directories
===============================

@{b}   rm@{ub} removes each given FILE.  By default, it does not remove
directories.  Synopsis:

     rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   If a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the @{b}-f@{ub} or
@{b}--force@{ub} option is not given, or the @{b}-i@{ub} or @{b}--interactive@{ub} option @{i}is@{ui}
given, @{b}rm@{ub} prompts the user for whether to remove the file.  If the
response does not begin with @{b}y@{ub} or @{b}Y@{ub}, the file is skipped.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-d@{ub}
@{b}--directory@{ub}
     Remove directories with @{b}unlink@{ub} instead of @{b}rmdir@{ub}, and don't require
     a directory to be empty before trying to unlink it.  Only works if
     you have appropriate privileges.  Because unlinking a directory
     causes any files in the deleted directory to become unreferenced,
     it is wise to @{b}fsck@{ub} the filesystem after doing this.

@{b}-f@{ub}
@{b}--force@{ub}
     Ignore nonexistent files and never prompt the user.  Ignore any
     previous @{b}--interactive@{ub} (@{b}-i@{ub}) option.

@{b}-i@{ub}
@{b}--interactive@{ub}
     Prompt whether to remove each file.  If the response does not begin
     with @{b}y@{ub} or @{b}Y@{ub}, the file is skipped.  Ignore any previous @{b}--force@{ub}
     (@{b}-f@{ub}) option.

@{b}-r@{ub}
@{b}-R@{ub}
@{b}--recursive@{ub}
     Remove the contents of directories recursively.

@{b}-v@{ub}
@{b}--verbose@{ub}
     Print the name of each file before removing it.

   One common question is how to remove files whose names begin with a
@{b}-@{ub}.  GNU @{b}rm@{ub}, like every program that uses the @{b}getopt@{ub} function to parse
its arguments, lets you use the @{b}--@{ub} option to indicate that all
following arguments are non-options.  To remove a file called @{b}-f@{ub} in the
current directory, you could type either:

     rm -- -f

or:

     rm ./-f

   The Unix @{b}rm@{ub} program's use of a single @{b}-@{ub} for this purpose predates
the development of the getopt standard syntax.

Special file types
******************

   This chapter describes commands which create special types of files
(and @{b}rmdir@{ub}, which removes directories, one special file type).

   Although Unix-like operating systems have markedly fewer special file
types than others, not @{i}everything@{ui} can be treated only as the
undifferentiated byte stream of @{i}normal files@{ui}.  For example, when a file
is created or removed, the system must record this information, which
it does in a @{i}directory@{ui}--a special type of file.  Although you can read
directories as normal files, if you're curious, in order for the system
to do its job it must impose a structure, a certain order, on the bytes
of the file.  Thus it is a "special" type of file.

   Besides directories, other special file types include named pipes
(FIFOs), symbolic links, sockets, and so-called @{i}special files@{ui}.


 @{" ln invocation              " link "ln invocation"}  Make links between files.
 @{" mkdir invocation           " link "mkdir invocation"}  Make directories.
 @{" mkfifo invocation          " link "mkfifo invocation"}  Make FIFOs (named pipes).
 @{" mknod invocation           " link "mknod invocation"}  Make block or character special files.
 @{" rmdir invocation           " link "rmdir invocation"}  Remove empty directories.


@endnode

@node "ln invocation" "fileutils.guide/ln invocation"
@next "mkdir invocation"
@toc "Special file types"

@{b}ln@{ub}: Make links between files
============================

@{b}   ln@{ub} makes links between files.  By default, it makes hard links; with
the @{b}-s@{ub} option, it makes symbolic (or @{i}soft@{ui}) links.  Synopses:

     ln [OPTION]... TARGET [LINKNAME]
     ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY

   * If the last argument names an existing directory, @{b}ln@{ub} creates a
     link to each TARGET file in that directory, using the TARGETs'
     names.  (But see the description of the @{b}--no-dereference@{ub} option
     below.)

   * If two filenames are given, @{b}ln@{ub} creates a link from the second to
     the first.

   * If one TARGET is given, @{b}ln@{ub} creates a link to that file in the
     current directory.

   * It is an error if the last argument is not a directory and more
     than two files are given.  Without @{b}-f@{ub} or @{b}-i@{ub} (see below), @{b}ln@{ub} will
     not remove an existing file.  Use the @{b}--backup@{ub} option to make @{b}ln@{ub}
     rename existing files.

   A @{i}hard link@{ui} is another name for an existing file; the link and the
original are indistinguishable.  Technically speaking, they share the
same inode, and the inode contains all the information about a
file--indeed, it is not incorrect to say that the inode @{i}is@{ui} the file.
On all existing implementations, you cannot make a hard link to a
directory, and hard links cannot cross filesystem boundaries.  (These
restrictions are not mandated by POSIX, however.)

@{i}   Symbolic links@{ui} (@{i}symlinks@{ui} for short), on the other hand, are a
special file type (which not all kernels support: System V release 3
(and older) systems lack symlinks) in which the link file actually
refers to a different file, by name.  When most operations (opening,
reading, writing, and so on) are passed the symbolic link file, the
kernel automatically @{i}dereferences@{ui} the link and operates on the target
of the link.  But some operations (e.g., removing) work on the link
file itself, rather than on its target.  See @{"Symbolic Links" link "library.guide/Symbolic Links"}.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-b@{ub}
@{b}--backup@{ub}
     Make a backup of each file that would otherwise be overwritten or
     removed.  See @{"Backup options" link "Backup options"}.

@{b}-d@{ub}
@{b}-F@{ub}
@{b}--directory@{ub}
     Allow the super-user to make hard links to directories.

@{b}-f@{ub}
@{b}--force@{ub}
     Remove existing destination files.

@{b}-i@{ub}
@{b}--interactive@{ub}
     Prompt whether to remove existing destination files.

@{b}-n@{ub}
@{b}--no-dereference@{ub}
     When given an explicit destination that is a symlink to a
     directory, treat that destination as if it were a normal file.

     When the destination is an actual directory (not a symlink to one),
     there is no ambiguity.  The link is created in that directory.
     But when the specified destination is a symlink to a directory,
     there are two ways to treat the user's request.  @{b}ln@{ub} can treat the
     destination just as it would a normal directory and create the
     link in it.  On the other hand, the destination can be viewed as a
     non-directory--as the symlink itself.  In that case, @{b}ln@{ub} must
     delete or backup that symlink before creating the new link.  The
     default is to treat a destination that is a symlink to a directory
     just like a directory.

@{b}-s@{ub}
@{b}--symbolic@{ub}
     Make symbolic links instead of hard links.  This option merely
     produces an error message on systems that do not support symbolic
     links.

@{b}-S SUFFIX@{ub}
@{b}--suffix=SUFFIX@{ub}
     Append SUFFIX to each backup file made with @{b}-b@{ub}.  See
     @{"Backup options" link "Backup options"}.

@{b}-v@{ub}
@{b}--verbose@{ub}
     Print the name of each file before linking it.

@{b}-V METHOD@{ub}
@{b}--version-control=METHOD@{ub}
     Change the type of backups made with @{b}-b@{ub}.  The METHOD argument can
     be @{b}numbered@{ub} (or @{b}t@{ub}), @{b}existing@{ub} (or @{b}nil@{ub}), or @{b}never@{ub} (or @{b}simple@{ub}).  See
     @{"Backup options" link "Backup options"}.

   Examples:

     ln -s /some/name  # creates link ./name pointing to /some/name
     ln -s /some/name myname  # creates link ./myname pointing to /some/name
     ln -s a b ..      # creates links ../a and ../b pointing to ./a and ./b

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-m MODE@{ub}
@{b}--mode=MODE@{ub}
     Set the mode of created directories to MODE, which is symbolic as

   A @{i}FIFO@{ui} is a special file type that permits independent processes to

@{b}mknod@{ub}: Make block or character special files
============================================

@{b}   mknod@{ub} creates a FIFO, character special file, or block special file
with the specified name.  Synopsis:

     mknod [OPTION]... NAME TYPE [MAJOR MINOR]

   Unlike the phrase "special file type" above, the term @{i}special file@{ui}
has a technical meaning on Unix: something that can generate or receive
data.  Usually this corresponds to a physical piece of hardware, e.g.,
a printer or a disk.  (These files are typically created at
system-configuration time.)  The @{b}mknod@{ub} command is what creates files of
this type.  Such devices can be read either a character at a time or a
"block" (many characters) at a time, hence we say there are @{i}block
special@{ui} files and @{i}character special@{ui} files.

   The arguments after NAME specify the type of file to make:

@{b}p@{ub}
     for a FIFO

@{b}b@{ub}
     for a block special file

@{b}c@{ub}
     for a character special file

   When making a block or character special file, the major and minor
device numbers must be given after the file type.

   The program accepts the following option.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-m MODE@{ub}
@{b}--mode=MODE@{ub}
     Set the mode of created files to MODE, which is symbolic as in

Changing file attributes
************************

   A file is not merely its contents, a name, and a file type (see
@{"Special file types" link "Special file types"}).  A file also has an owner (a userid), a group (a
group id), permissions (what the owner can do with the file, what
people in the group can do, and what everyone else can do), various
timestamps, and other information.  Collectively, we call these a file's
@{i}attributes@{ui}.

   These commands change file attributes.


 @{" chown invocation           " link "chown invocation"}  Change file owners and groups.
 @{" chgrp invocation           " link "chgrp invocation"}  Change file groups.

     [OWNER] [ [:.] [GROUP] ]

   Specifically:

OWNER
     If only an OWNER (a user name or numeric user id) is given, that
     user is made the owner of each given file, and the files' group is
     not changed.

OWNER@{B}.@{UB}GROUP
OWNER@{B}:@{UB}GROUP
     If the OWNER is followed by a colon or dot and a GROUP (a group
     name or numeric group id), with no spaces between them, the group
     ownership of the files is changed as well (to GROUP).

OWNER@{B}.@{UB}
OWNER@{B}:@{UB}
     If a colon or dot but no group name follows OWNER, that user is
     made the owner of the files and the group of the files is changed
     to OWNER's login group.

@{B}.@{UB}GROUP
@{B}:@{UB}GROUP
     If the colon or dot and following GROUP are given, but the owner
     is omitted, only the group of the files is changed; in this case,
     @{b}chown@{ub} performs the same function as @{b}chgrp@{ub}.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-c@{ub}
@{b}--changes@{ub}
     Verbosely describe the action for each FILE whose ownership
     actually changes.

@{b}-f@{ub}
@{b}--silent@{ub}
@{b}--quiet@{ub}
     Do not print error messages about files whose ownership cannot be
     changed.

@{b}--dereference@{ub}
     Do not act on symbolic links themselves but rather on what they
     point to.

@{b}-h@{ub}
@{b}--no-dereference@{ub}
     Act on symbolic links themselves instead of what they point to.
     This is the default.  This mode relies on the @{b}lchown@{ub} system call.
     On systems that do not provide the @{b}lchown@{ub} system call, @{b}chown@{ub} fails
     when a file specified on the command line is a symbolic link.  By
     default, no diagnostic is issued for symbolic links encountered
     during a recursive traversal, but see @{b}--verbose@{ub}.

@{b}--reference=FILE@{ub}
     Use the user and group of the reference FILE instead of an explicit
     NEW-OWNER value.

@{b}-v@{ub}
@{b}--verbose@{ub}
     Verbosely describe the action (or non-action) taken for every FILE.
     If a symbolic link is encountered during a recursive traversal on
     a system without the @{b}lchown@{ub} system call, and @{b}--no-dereference@{ub} is
     in effect, then issue a diagnostic saying neither the symbolic
     link nor its referent is being changed.

@{b}-R@{ub}
@{b}--recursive@{ub}
     Recursively change ownership of directories and their contents.

@{b}chmod@{ub}: Change access permissions
================================

@{b}   chmod@{ub} changes the access permissions of the named files.  Synopsis:

@{b}   chmod@{ub} never changes the permissions of symbolic links, since the
@{b}chmod@{ub} system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a
problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used.
However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line, @{b}chmod@{ub}
changes the permissions of the pointed-to file.  In contrast, @{b}chmod@{ub}
ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive directory
traversals.

   If used, MODE specifies the new permissions.  For details, see the

=============================

@{b}   touch@{ub} changes the access and/or modification times of the specified
files.  Synopsis:

     touch [OPTION]... FILE...

   If the first FILE would be a valid argument to the @{b}-t@{ub} option and no
timestamp is given with any of the @{b}-d@{ub}, @{b}-r@{ub}, or @{b}-t@{ub} options and the @{b}--@{ub}
argument is not given, that argument is interpreted as the time for the
other files instead of as a file name.

   Any FILE that does not exist is created empty.

   If changing both the access and modification times to the current
time, @{b}touch@{ub} can change the timestamps for files that the user running
it does not own but has write permission for.  Otherwise, the user must
own the files.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

   No disk can hold an infinite amount of data.  These commands report
on how much disk storage is in use or available.  (This has nothing
much to do with how much @{i}main memory@{ui}, i.e., RAM, a program is using when
it runs; for that, you want @{b}ps@{ub} or @{b}pstat@{ub} or @{b}swap@{ub} or some such command.)

@{b}df@{ub}: Report filesystem disk space usage
======================================

@{b}   df@{ub} reports the amount of disk space used and available on
filesystems.  Synopsis:

     df [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   With no arguments, @{b}df@{ub} reports the space used and available on all
currently mounted filesystems (of all types).  Otherwise, @{b}df@{ub} reports on
the filesystem containing each argument FILE.

   Normally the disk space is printed in units of 1024 bytes, but this
can be overridden (see @{"Block size" link "Block size"}).

   If an argument FILE is a disk device file containing a mounted
filesystem, @{b}df@{ub} shows the space available on that filesystem rather than
on the filesystem containing the device node (i.e., the root
filesystem).  GNU @{b}df@{ub} does not attempt to determine the disk usage on
unmounted filesystems, because on most kinds of systems doing so
requires extremely nonportable intimate knowledge of filesystem
structures.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-a@{ub}
@{b}--all@{ub}
     Include in the listing filesystems that have a size of 0 blocks,
     which are omitted by default.  Such filesystems are typically
     special-purpose pseudo-filesystems, such as automounter entries.
     Also, filesystems of type "ignore" or "auto", supported by some
     operating systems, are only included if this option is specified.

@{b}-h@{ub}
@{b}--human-readable@{ub}
     Append a size letter such as @{b}M@{ub} for megabytes to each size.  Powers
     of 1024 are used, not 1000; @{b}M@{ub} stands for 1,048,576 bytes.  Use the
     @{b}-H@{ub} or @{b}--si@{ub} option if you prefer powers of 1000.

@{b}-H@{ub}
@{b}--si@{ub}
     Append a size letter such as @{b}M@{ub} for megabytes to each size.  (SI is
     the International System of Units, which defines these letters as
     prefixes.)  Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; @{b}M@{ub} stands for
     1,000,000 bytes.  Use the @{b}-h@{ub} or @{b}--human-readable@{ub} option if you
     prefer powers of 1024.

@{b}-i@{ub}
@{b}--inodes@{ub}
     List inode usage information instead of block usage.  An inode
     (short for index node) is contains information about a file such
     as its owner, permissions, timestamps, and location on the disk.

@{b}-k@{ub}
@{b}--kilobytes@{ub}
     Print sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block size
     (see @{"Block size" link "Block size"}).

@{b}-l@{ub}
@{b}--local@{ub}
     Limit the listing to local filesystems.  By default, remote
     filesystems are also listed.

@{b}-m@{ub}
@{b}--megabytes@{ub}
     Print sizes in megabyte (that is, 1,048,576-byte) blocks.

@{b}--no-sync@{ub}
     Do not invoke the @{b}sync@{ub} system call before getting any usage data.
     This may make @{b}df@{ub} run significantly faster on systems with many
     disks, but on some systems (notably SunOS) the results may be
     slightly out of date.  This is the default.

@{b}-P@{ub}
@{b}--portability@{ub}
     Use the POSIX output format.  This is like the default format
     except that the information about each filesystem is always
     printed on exactly one line; a mount device is never put on a line
     by itself.  This means that if the mount device name is more than
     20 characters long (e.g., for some network mounts), the columns
     are misaligned.

@{b}--sync@{ub}
     Invoke the @{b}sync@{ub} system call before getting any usage data.  On
     some systems (notably SunOS), doing this yields more up to date
     results, but in general this option makes @{b}df@{ub} much slower,
     especially when there are many or very busy filesystems.

@{b}-t FSTYPE@{ub}
@{b}--type=FSTYPE@{ub}
     Limit the listing to filesystems of type FSTYPE.  Multiple
     filesystem types can be specified by giving multiple @{b}-t@{ub} options.
     By default, nothing is omitted.

@{b}-T@{ub}
@{b}--print-type@{ub}
     Print each filesystem's type.  The types printed here are the same
     ones you can include or exclude with @{b}-t@{ub} and @{b}-x@{ub}.  The particular
     types printed are whatever is supported by the system.  Here are
     some of the common names (this list is certainly not exhaustive):

    @{b}nfs@{ub}
          An NFS filesystem, i.e., one mounted over a network from
          another machine.  This is the one type name which seems to be
          used uniformly by all systems.

    @{b}4.2, ufs, efs...@{ub}
          A filesystem on a locally-mounted hard disk.  (The system
          might even support more than one type here; Linux does.)

    @{b}hsfs, cdfs@{ub}
          A filesystem on a CD-ROM drive.  HP-UX uses @{b}cdfs@{ub}, most other
          systems use @{b}hsfs@{ub} (@{b}hs@{ub} for `High Sierra').

    @{b}pcfs@{ub}
          An MS-DOS filesystem, usually on a diskette.

@{b}-x FSTYPE@{ub}
@{b}--exclude-type=FSTYPE@{ub}
     Limit the listing to filesystems not of type FSTYPE.  Multiple
     filesystem types can be eliminated by giving multiple @{b}-x@{ub} options.
     By default, no filesystem types are omitted.

@{b}-v@{ub}
     Ignored; for compatibility with System V versions of @{b}df@{ub}.

@{b}du@{ub}: Estimate file space usage
=============================

@{b}   du@{ub} reports the amount of disk space used by the specified files and
for each subdirectory (of directory arguments).  Synopsis:

     du [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   With no arguments, @{b}du@{ub} reports the disk space for the current
directory.  Normally the disk space is printed in units of 1024 bytes,
but this can be overridden (see @{"Block size" link "Block size"}).

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-a@{ub}
@{b}--all@{ub}
     Show counts for all files, not just directories.

@{b}-b@{ub}
@{b}--bytes@{ub}
     Print sizes in bytes, overriding the default block size (see
     @{"Block size" link "Block size"}).

@{b}-c@{ub}
@{b}--total@{ub}
     Print a grand total of all arguments after all arguments have been
     processed.  This can be used to find out the total disk usage of a
     given set of files or directories.

@{b}-D@{ub}
@{b}--dereference-args@{ub}
     Dereference symbolic links that are command line arguments.  Does
     not affect other symbolic links.  This is helpful for finding out
     the disk usage of directories, such as @{b}/usr/tmp@{ub}, which are often
     symbolic links.

@{b}-h@{ub}
@{b}--human-readable@{ub}
     Append a size letter such as @{b}M@{ub} for megabytes to each size.  Powers
     of 1024 are used, not 1000; @{b}M@{ub} stands for 1,048,576 bytes.  Use the
     @{b}-H@{ub} or @{b}--si@{ub} option if you prefer powers of 1000.

@{b}-H@{ub}
@{b}--si@{ub}
     Append a size letter such as @{b}M@{ub} for megabytes to each size.  (SI is
     the International System of Units, which defines these letters as
     prefixes.)  Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; @{b}M@{ub} stands for
     1,000,000 bytes.  Use the @{b}-h@{ub} or @{b}--human-readable@{ub} option if you
     prefer powers of 1024.

@{b}-k@{ub}
@{b}--kilobytes@{ub}
     Print sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block size
     (see @{"Block size" link "Block size"}).

@{b}-l@{ub}
@{b}--count-links@{ub}
     Count the size of all files, even if they have appeared already
     (as a hard link).

@{b}-L@{ub}
@{b}--dereference@{ub}
     Dereference symbolic links (show the disk space used by the file
     or directory that the link points to instead of the space used by
     the link).

@{b}--max-depth=DEPTH@{ub}
     Show the total for each directory (and file if -all) that is at
     most MAX_DEPTH levels down from the root of the hierarchy.  The
     root is at level 0, so @{b}du --max-depth=0@{ub} is equivalent to @{b}du -s@{ub}.

@{b}-m@{ub}
@{b}--megabytes@{ub}
     Print sizes in megabyte (that is, 1,048,576-byte) blocks.

@{b}-s@{ub}
@{b}--summarize@{ub}
     Display only a total for each argument.

@{b}-S@{ub}
@{b}--separate-dirs@{ub}
     Report the size of each directory separately, not including the
     sizes of subdirectories.

@{b}-x@{ub}
@{b}--one-file-system@{ub}
     Skip directories that are on different filesystems from the one
     that the argument being processed is on.

@{b}--exclude=PAT@{ub}
     When recursing, skip subdirectories or files matching PAT.  For
     example, @{b}du --exclude='*.o'@{ub} excludes files whose names end in @{b}.o@{ub}.

@{b}-X FILE@{ub}
@{b}--exclude-from=FILE@{ub}
     Like @{b}--exclude@{ub}, except take the patterns to exclude from FILE, one
     per line.  If FILE is @{b}-@{ub}, take the patterns from standard input.

   On BSD systems, @{b}du@{ub} reports sizes that are half the correct values
for files that are NFS-mounted from HP-UX systems.  On HP-UX systems,
it reports sizes that are twice the correct values for files that are
NFS-mounted from BSD systems.  This is due to a flaw in HP-UX; it also
affects the HP-UX @{b}du@{ub} program.

@{b}sync@{ub}: Synchronize data on disk with memory
==========================================

@{b}   sync@{ub} writes any data buffered in memory out to disk.  This can
include (but is not limited to) modified superblocks, modified inodes,
and delayed reads and writes.  This must be implemented by the kernel;
The @{b}sync@{ub} program does nothing but exercise the @{b}sync@{ub} system call.

   The kernel keeps data in memory to avoid doing (relatively slow) disk
reads and writes.  This improves performance, but if the computer
crashes, data may be lost or the filesystem corrupted as a result. @{b}sync@{ub}
ensures everything in memory is written to disk.

   Any arguments are ignored, except for a lone @{b}--help@{ub} or @{b}--version@{ub}
(see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}).
