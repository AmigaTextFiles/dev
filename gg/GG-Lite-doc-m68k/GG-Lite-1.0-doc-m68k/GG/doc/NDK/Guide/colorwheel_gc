   NAME@{ub}
        colorwheel.gadget -- create standard HSB color wheel BOOPSI objects
                             (V39)@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        The color wheel class provides the ability to create gadgets
        enabling the user to control the hue and saturation components
        of an HSB (Hue-Saturation-Brightness) color space. The companion
        gradient slider class enables control of the brightness component of
        the color space.

        The color wheel can operate on screens of any depth, and adapts
        its rendering to the number of colors available. The system's pen
        sharing mechanism is used in order to maximize the number of colors
        used by the wheel. A color wheel gadget is (normally) responsible
        for choosing it's own color pens to draw in (using
        @{"graphics.library/ObtainBestPen()" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/graphics/ObtainBestPenA"}). However, the creator of the gadget
        can "donate" some pens to the gadget, using the @{"WHEEL_Donation" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 51}
        tag.

        The reason that the color wheel picks its own colors is because
        it has the ability to display several different layouts depending
        on the number and variety of colors available. For example, when
        opening on a screen of low depth or when opening on a screen where
        all the pens have already been allocated exclusively, the gadget will
        display a "monochrome" version of the color wheel, where instead of
        colored segments, the letters "R" (for red), "G" (for green), "B"
        (for blue), "Y" (for yellow), "C" (for cyan) and "M" (for magenta)
        will be used as labels.

        You can talk to the color wheel using HSB or RGB, even though the
        color wheel only really deals with HSB in its user-interface. All
        communications with applications are performed with full 32-bit
        color component values.@{b}

        @{"WHEEL_Hue" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 41} (@{"ULONG" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/types.h/File" 52}) -- Set and get the hue component of a color wheel.
                This is effectively the angle around the wheel where the
                desired color lies. If the wheel is currently displayed,
                the position of the selection knob will be moved to reflect
                the new hue.

                A hue value of 0 is all red, and nothing but red. Increasing
                the value moves the color towards all green at $55555555, full
                blue at $AAAAAAAA, and back to red at $FFFFFFFF.

                If you are setting or getting more than one color component at
                a time, it is more efficient to use the @{"WHEEL_HSB" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 44} tag.

                Default for this tag is 0. Applicability is (ISGNU).
                (V39)

        @{"WHEEL_Saturation" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 42} (@{"ULONG" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/types.h/File" 52}) -- Set and get the saturation component of a
                color wheel. This is effectively the distance from the center
                of the wheel where the desired color lies. If the wheel is
                currently displayed, the position of the selection knob will
                be moved to reflect the new saturation.

                A saturation value of 0 puts the knob at the center of the
                wheel and always yields white. Increasing the value
                progressively moves the knob farther away from the center.
                until the value $FFFFFFFF is reached in which case the knob
                is as far as it can go.

                If you are setting or getting more than one color component at
                a time, it is more efficient to use the @{"WHEEL_HSB" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 44} tag.

                Default for this tag is $FFFFFFFF. Applicability is (ISGNU).

                color wheel. The color wheel does not itself have any means of
                displaying or editing brightness, but it does maintain this
                value internally. Used with @{"WHEEL_GradientSlider" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 53}, this tag lets
                you control the value of a gradient slider object by passing
                @{"WHEEL_Brightness" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 43} to a color wheel.

                A brightness value of 0 means all black. Increasing the value
                progressively brightens the current color, until the value
                $FFFFFFFF is reached in which case the color is as bright as
                it gets.

                If you are setting or getting more than one color component at
                a time, it is more efficient to use the @{"WHEEL_HSB" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 44} tag.

                in color, it automatically renders itself in monochrome
                instead. In such a case, the various color segments are
                identified by six letters G=Green, C=Cyan, B=Blue, M=Magenta,
                R=Red, and Y=Yellow. You can provide a replacement set of six

                contain any number of pens, and is terminated with a pen
                value of ~0. The wheel will change the RGB values of these
                pens to suit its needs, so be prepared for this. This means
                the pens should likely be allocated using the @{"PENF_EXCLUSIVE" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/graphics/view.h/File" 228}
                option of the @{"graphics.library/ObtainPen()" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/graphics/ObtainPen"} function.

                linking of a gradient slider object to a color wheel object.
                You give this tag a pointer to a gradient slider object
                obtained previously from @{"NewObject()" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/intuition/NewObject"}. Once this is done,
                anytime the various tags that can affect the brightness
                component of the current color is sent to the color wheel,
                the color wheel automatically changes the value of the
                attached gradient slider to match that new brightness value.
                Reading the brightness value from the color wheel returns the
                current value indicated by the gradient slider.

                Using this tag effectively allows you to treat the color wheel
                and gradient slider as a single gadget. Once things are set up,
                all communications occur through the wheel object, and the
                gradient slider can pretty much be ignored by the application.

                Default for this tag is @{"NULL" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/types.h/File" 101}. Applicability is (IS). (V39)

   WARNING@{ub}
        Once a color wheel has been created on a given screen, the wheel
        object must be deleted using @{"DisposeObject()" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/intuition/DisposeObject"} prior to closing the
        screen. This is because the wheel object allocates pens on the
        screen.@{b}

   BUGS@{ub}
        Even though all communication with the color wheel is done using full
        32-bit color components, color calculations are currently done using
        16-bit math, which can cause certain rounding errors to appear.

        Prior to V40, the @{"WHEEL_Red" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 45}, @{"WHEEL_Green" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 46}, and @{"WHEEL_Blue" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 47} tags
        did not return the correct values when a gradient slider is linked
        with the color wheel using the @{"WHEEL_GradientSlider" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 53} tag. The
        workaround is to always use the @{"WHEEL_RGB" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/gadgets/colorwheel.h/File" 48} tag, and just extract the
        values from there.
