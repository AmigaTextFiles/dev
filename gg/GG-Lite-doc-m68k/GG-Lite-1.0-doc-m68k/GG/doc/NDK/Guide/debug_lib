   NAME@{ub}
        KCmpStr - compare two null terminated strings@{b}

   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        mismatch = KCmpStr(string1, string2)
        D0         A0        A1@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        string1 is compared to string2 using the ASCII collating
        sequence.  0 indicates the strings are identical.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "KGetChar" "debug.lib/KGetChar()"
@{b}

   NAME@{ub}
        KGetChar - get a character from the console
                   (defaults to the serial port at 9600 baud)@{b}

   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        char = KGetChar()
        D0@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        busy wait until a character arrives from the console.
        KGetChar is the assembly interface, _KGetChar and _kgetc
        are the C interfaces.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "KGetNum" "debug.lib/KGetNum()"
@{b}

   NAME@{ub}
        KGetNum - get a number from the console@{b}

   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        number = KGetNum()
        D0@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        get a signed decimal integer from the console.  This will busy
        wait until the number arrives.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "KMayGetChar" "debug.lib/KMayGetChar()"
@{b}

   NAME@{ub}
        KMayGetChar - return a character if present, but don't wait
                      (defaults to the serial port at 9600 baud)@{b}

   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        flagChar = KMayGetChar()
        D0@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        return either a -1, saying that there is no character present, or
        whatever character was waiting.  KMayGetChar is the assembly
        interface,  _KMayGetChar is the C interface.

@NODE "KPrintF" "debug.lib/KPrintF()"
@{b}

   NAME@{ub}
        KPrintF - print formatted data to the console
                  (defaults to the serial port at 9600 baud)@{b}

   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        KPrintF("format string",values)
                 A0             A1@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        print a formatted C-type string to the console.  See the
        exec @{"RawDoFmt()" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/exec/RawDoFmt"} call for the supported % formatting commands.@{b}

   INPUTS@{ub}
        "format string" - A C style string with % commands to indicate
                          where paramters are to be inserted.
        values - A pointer to an array of paramters, to be inserted into
                 specified places in the string.

        KPutFmt and KPrintF are identical assembly interfaces that want the
        two pointers in registers.  _KPrintF and _kprintf are C interfaces
        that expect the format string pointer on the stack, and the
        paramters on the stack above that.@{b}

   SEE ALSO@{ub}
        @{"exec.library/RawDoFmt" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/exec/RawDoFmt"}, any C compiler's "@{"printf" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/amiga_lib/printf"}" call.

   NAME@{ub}
        KPutChar - put a character to the console
                   (defaults to the serial port at 9600 baud)@{b}

   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        char = KPutChar(char)
        D0              D0@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        Put a character to the console.  This function will not return
        until the character has been completely transmitted.@{b}

   INPUTS@{ub}
        KPutChar is the assembly interface, the character must be in D0.
        _KPutChar and _kputc are the C interfaces, the character must be
        a longword on the stack.

   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        KPutStr(string)
                A0@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        put a null terminated string to the console.  This function will
        not return until the string has been completely transmitted.@{b}

   INPUTS@{ub}
        KPutStr is the assembly interface, a string pointer must be in A0.
        _KPutStr and _kputs are the C interfaces, the string pointer must
        be on the stack.
