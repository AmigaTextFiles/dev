   NAME@{ub}
        Read -- read input from parallel port@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        This command causes a stream of characters to be read from the
        parallel I/O register. The number of characters is specified in
        io_Length. The EOF and EOL modes are supported, but be warned that
        using these modes can result in a buffer overflow if the proper
        EOL or EOF character is not received in time. These modes should
        be used only when the sender and receiver have been designed to
        cooperate. A safety guard can be implemented to EOF by setting
        io_Length to a maximum allowed value. That cannot be done with EOL
        since the EOL mode is identified by io_Length=-1.

        The parallel.device has no internal buffer; if no read request has
        been made, pending input (i.e. handshake request) is not
        acknowledged.@{b}

        sets the devices's flags and parameters to their boot-up time

        will be so also here.@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        This command causes a stream of characters to be written to the
        parallel output register. The number of characters is specified in
        io_Length, unless -1 is used, in which case output is sent until
        a zero byte occurs in the data. This is independent of, and may be
        used simultaneously with setting the EOFMODE in io_ParFlags and using
        the PTermArray to terminate the read or write.@{b}

   NAME@{ub}
        Open -- a request to open the parallel port@{b}

   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        error = @{"OpenDevice" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/exec/OpenDevice"}("parallel.device", unit, ioExtPar, flags)
        D0                  A0                D0    A1        D1@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function allows the requestor software access to the parallel
        device.  Unless the shared-access bit (bit 5 of io_ParFlags) is
        set, exclusive use is granted and no other access is allowed
        until the owner closes the device.

        A FAST_MODE, can be specified (bit 3 of io_Parflags) to speed up
        transfers to high-speed printers. Rather than waiting for the printer
        to acknowledge a character using the *ACK interrupt, this mode will
        send out data as long as the BUSY signal is low. The printer must be
        able to raise the BUSY signal within 3 micro-seconds on A2630s,
        otherwise data will be lost. Should be used only in an exclusive-
        access @{"Open()" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/dos/Open"}.

        A SLOWMODE mode can be specified (bit 4 of io_ParFlags) when very
        slow printers are used. If the printer acknowledges data at less
        than 5000 bytes per second, then this mode will actually save CPU
        time, although it consumes much more with high-speed printers.

        The PTermArray of the ioExtPar is initialized only if the EOFMODE
        bit (bit 1 of io_ParFlags) is set. The PTermArray can be further
        modified using the @{"PDCMD_SETPARAMS" LINK "PDCMD_SETPARAMS"} command.@{b}

   INPUTS@{ub}
        "parallel.device" - a pointer to literal string "parallel.device"

        SetParams -- change parameters for the parallel device@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        This command allows the caller to change the EOFMODE parameter for
        the parallel port device. It will disallow changes if any reads or
        writes are active or queued.

        The @{"PARB_EOFMODE" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/parallel.h/File" 69} bit of io_ParFlags controlls whether the
        io_PTermArray is to be used as an additional termination criteria
        for reads and writes.  It may be set directly without a call to
        SetParams, setting it here performs the additional service of
        copying the PTermArray into the device default array which is used
        as the initial array for subsequent device opens. The Shared bit
        can be changed here, and overrides the current device access mode
        set at @{"OpenDevice" LINK "OpenDevice"} time.@{b}
