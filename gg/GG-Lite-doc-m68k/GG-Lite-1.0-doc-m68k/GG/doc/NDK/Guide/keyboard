   NAME@{ub}
        @{"KBD_ADDRESETHANDLER" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/keyboard.h/File" 19} -- Add a keyboard reset handler.@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        Add a function to the list of functions called to clean up
        before a hard reset generated at the keyboard.  The reset
        handler is called as:
            ResetHandler(handlerData)
                         a1@{b}

   IO REQUEST@{ub}

        io_Data         a pointer to an interrupt structure.
            is_Data     the handlerData pointer described above
            is_Code     the Handler function address@{b}

   NOTES@{ub}
        Few of the Amiga keyboard models generate the communication codes
        used to implement this reset processing.  Specifically, only the
        Euro a1000 (rare), and the B2000 keyboard generate them.

        The interrupt structure is kept by the keyboard device until a
        RemResetHandler command is satisfied for it, but the
        @{"KBD_ADDRESETHANDLER" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/keyboard.h/File" 19} command itself is replied immediately.

   NAME@{ub}
        @{"KBD_READEVENT" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/keyboard.h/File" 17} -- Return the next keyboard event.@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        Read raw keyboard events from the keyboard and put them in the
        data area of the iORequest.  If there are no pending keyboard
        events, this command will not be satisfied, but if there are
        some events, but not as many as can fill IO_LENGTH, the
        request will be satisfied with those currently available.@{b}

        io_Length       the size of the io_Data area in bytes: there
                        are sizeof(inputEvent) bytes per input event.
        io_Data         a buffer area to fill with input events.  The
                        fields of the input event are:
            ie_NextEvent
                        links the events returned

            ie_Qualifier
                        only the shift and numeric pad bits are set

                        are not used, and set to zero@{b}

   RESULTS@{ub}
        This function sets the error field in the IORequest, and fills
        the IORequest with the next keyboard events (but not partial
        events).

        io_Length       the size of the io_Data area in bytes: this
                        must be big enough to hold the key matrix.
        io_Data         a buffer area to fill with the key matrix:
                        an array of bytes whose component bits reflect
                        each keys state: the state of the key for
                        keycode n is at bit (n MOD 8) in byte
                        (n DIV 8) of this matrix.@{b}

        io_Error
             @{"IOERR_BADLENGTH" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/errors.h/File" 16} - the io_Length was not exactly 13 bytes.
                        The buffer is unchanged.  This is only returned
                        by V33/V34 kickstart.
        io_Actual       the number of bytes filled in io_Data with key
                        matrix data, i.e. the minimum of the supplied
                        length and the internal key matrix size.@{b}

   NOTE@{ub}
        For V33/V34 Kickstart, io_Length must be set to exactly 13 bytes.@{b}

   RESULTS@{ub}
        This function sets the error field in the IORequest, and sets
        matrix to the current key matrix.

        Indicate that reset cleanup associated with the handler has
        completed.  This command should be issued by all keyboard
        reset handlers so that the reset may proceed.@{b}

   NOTES@{ub}
        The keyboard processor itself performs the hardware reset, and
        will time out and perform the reset even if some reset handlers
        have not indicated yet that the reset may proceed.  This
        timeout is several seconds.
