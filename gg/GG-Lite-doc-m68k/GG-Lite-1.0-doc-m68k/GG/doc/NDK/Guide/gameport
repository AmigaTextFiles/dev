   FUNCTION@{ub}
        This command identifies the type of controller at the game
        port, so that the signals at the port may be properly
        interpreted.  The controller type has been set by a previous
        SetCType.

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        This command inquires what conditions must be met by a game
        port unit before a pending Read request will be satisfied.
        These conditions, called triggers, are independent -- that
        any one occurs is sufficient to queue a game port report to
        the Read queue.  These conditions are set by SetTrigger.

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        Read game port events from the game port and put them in the
        data area of the iORequest.  If there are no pending game port
        events, this command will not be satisfied, but if there are

                        the delta time since the last report, given

                        count in the TV_SECS field.@{b}

   RESULTS@{ub}
        This function sets the error field in the iORequest, and fills
        the iORequest with the next game port events (but not partial
        events).@{b}
