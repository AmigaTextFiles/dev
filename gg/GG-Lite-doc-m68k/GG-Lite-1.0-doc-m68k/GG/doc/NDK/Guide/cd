   NAME@{ub}
       @{"CD_ADDCHANGEINT" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 42} -- add a disk change software interrupt handler.@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
       This command lets you add a software interrupt handler to the
       disk device that gets invoked whenever a disk insertion or removal
       occurs.

       You must pass in a properly initialized Exec Interrupt structure
       and be prepared to deal with disk insertions/removals immediately.
       The interrupt is generated by the exec Cause function, so you must
       preserve A6.

       To set up the handler, an Interrupt structure must be initialized.
       This structure is supplied as the io_Data to the @{"CD_ADDCHANGEINT" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 42}
       command.  The handler then gets linked into the handler chain and
       gets invoked whenever a disk change happens.  You must eventually
       remove the handler before you exit.

       This command only returns when the handler is removed. That is,
       the device holds onto the IO request until the @{"CD_REMCHANGEINT" LINK "CD_REMCHANGEINT"} command
       is executed with that same IO request.  Hence, you must use @{"SendIO()" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/exec/SendIO"}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
       This command lets you add a software interrupt handler to the
       disk device that gets invoked whenever a new frame is encountered
       while CD audio is being played.

       You must pass in a properly initialized Exec Interrupt structure
       and be prepared to deal with frame interrupts immediately.
       The interrupt is generated by the exec Cause function, so you must
       preserve A6.

       To set up the handler, an Interrupt structure must be initialized.
       This structure is supplied in io_Data of the @{"CD_ADDFRAMEINT" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 65}
       command.  The handler then gets linked into the handler chain and
       gets invoked whenever a frame event occurs.  You must eventually
       remove the handler before you exit.

       This command only returns when the handler is removed. That is,
       the device holds onto the IO request until the @{"CD_REMFRAMEINT" LINK "CD_REMFRAMEINT"} command
       is executed with that same IO request.  Hence, you must use @{"SendIO()" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/exec/SendIO"}
       with this command.@{b}

   NOTES@{ub}
       The interrupt handler can be added before or after a play command is
       sent.  Interrupts will only be generated while CD audio is playing.
       Interrupts will not be generated when audio is paused.@{b}

   RESULTS@{ub}
       io_Error        Returns an error if drive does not support attenuation
       io_Actual       current volume level (fade may be monitored)@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
       This command will ramp the CD audio volume up or down from its
       current value to the value contained in io_Offset.  The range is 0
       (silence) to 0x7FFF (full volume).  If -1 is specified as the target,
       the attenuation will not be modified; the current attenuation value
       will be returned in io_Actual.

       io_Length contains the duration of the fade.  In seconds, this is
       io_Length divided by the current frame rate (usually 75).

       Note that this command returns before the fade has completed.  Thus,
       once started, a fade cannot be aborted.  You can, however, send a
       new @{"CD_ATTENUATE" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 63} command, which will immediately override any fade
       currently in progress.  An io_Length of zero means attenuate
       immediately.

       If a gradual attenuation command is sent before the play command, the
       fade will begin as soon as the play command is sent.@{b}

   EXAMPLE@{ub}@{b}

   NOTES@{ub}
       This command has no effect on Amiga audio volume, only CD audio.

       If the drive does not support volume attenuation, but does support
       mute, a value of under $0800 should be considered mute, and equal
       to or above should be full volume.  If chunky attenuation is
       supported, the drive should do the best it can.  If the drive does
       not support volume attenuation at all, an error should be returned.
       Even if only mute is supported, if gradual attenuation is requested,
       the device should still emulate the fade command and mute based on
       the $0800 boundary.@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
       This command sets one or more of the configuration items.
       The configuration items are:

       @{"TAGCD_PLAYSPEED" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 115}                 Default: 75
       @{"TAGCD_READSPEED" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 116}                 Default: 75 (do not count on this)
       @{"TAGCD_READXLSPEED" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 117}               Default: 75
       @{"TAGCD_SECTORSIZE" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 118}                Default: 2048
       @{"TAGCD_XLECC" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 119}                     Default: 1 (on)
       @{"TAGCD_EJECTRESET" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 120}                Default: can be 0 (off) or 1 (on)

       The speed settings are described in the number of frames (sectors)
       per second.  All CD-ROM drives are capable of the 75 frames/second
       rate.  Some drives are capable of 150 frames/second, and some even
       more.  To determine the maximum frame rate of the drive, use the
       @{"CD_INFO" LINK "CD_INFO"} command.  Valid values for caddyless Commodore CD-ROM drives
       are 75 and 150 (normal speed and double speed).  All other values are
       invalid.  You should always make sure the drive is capable of the
       configuration you are requesting by either using the @{"CD_INFO" LINK "CD_INFO"} command,
       and/or by checking for an error condition after submitting your
       request.

       There are three different types of CD-ROM sectors.  Mode 1 sectors
       (2048 bytes), mode 2 form 1 sectors (2048 bytes), and mode 2 form 2
       sectors (2328 bytes).  Normally, disks are encoded in Mode 1 format.
       Mode 2 form 1 is basically the same as mode 1; however, the mode 2
       form 2 sector format contains no CD-ROM error correction information.
       In order to read information encoded in this sector format, the
       drive's sector size must be configured to 2328 byte sectors.

       Error correction (ECC) of the READXL command can be turned off or
       on with this command.  Error correction can be implemented in either
       hardware or software (depending on the CD-ROM drive).  When ECC is
       implemented in software, CPU usage can become bursty.  Errors rarely
       occur on CDs unless they have numerous scratches, but when they do
       occur, they will cause a loss of CPU bandwith.  When ECC is
       implemented in hardware, no CPU bandwidth is lost -- in this case,
       ECC will always be on no matter how you configure the drive because
       it is free.  The READXL command is used primarily for displaying
       movie-like data.  In this case, speed is essential and data integrety
       is not; however, if the CPU is not being utilized during an XL
       animation there is no need to disable ECC (since the bandwidth is
       there to be used).  The only time ECC should be disabled is when you
       are doing intense calculations in the background of a READXL command,
       AND your program is time-critical.  Do not forget to change this back
       when you are done!

       To make the computer reset when a CD is ejected (for an application
       that does not exit), use the @{"TAGCD_EJECTRESET" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 120} tag.  When possible,
       titles should be able to exit cleanly back to Workbench.  Error
       conditions should be monitored when doing disk I/O.@{b}

   EXAMPLE@{ub}
       /* Configure ReadXL for double-speed reading and turn off ECC when */
       /* the ReadXL command is used.                                     */

       @{"struct TagItem" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/utility/tagitem.h/File" 32} ConfigList[] = {

           if (ior->io_Error) @{"printf" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/amiga_lib/printf"}("Could not be configured\\n");@{b}

   NOTES@{ub}
       Setting the configuration will not modify the behavior of a read or
       play command already in progress.

       This can be a very dangerous command.  If for instance you set
       @{"TAGCD_SECTORSIZE" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 118} to 2328, you will no longer be able to read any
       data encoded at 2048 byte sectors (e.g. the file system will not be
       able to read the disk anymore).  After you read any data stored with
       this sector format, you should immediately configure back to the
       original default value (even if the read failed -- the disk could
       be removed in the middle of your read).  You should NEVER use this
       command if you are not the exclusive owner of your disk.@{b}

   BUGS@{ub}
       @{"TAG_IGNORE" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/utility/tagitem.h/File" 41}, @{"TAG_MORE" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/utility/tagitem.h/File" 42}, and @{"TAG_SKIP" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/utility/tagitem.h/File" 45} do not work.  Do not use these.

       When switching speeds from single to double (or double to single),
       If the drive is prefetching in single-speed the data you are going
       to use in double-speed, the drive will not switch to double-speed
       (and visa versa).  To avoid this problem, switch to the desired speed,
       begin reading at least 4k into the data (just read two bytes), then
       begin reading at the beginning.  This will force the prefetch buffer
       to clear and issue a new read command with the desired speed.

       This command will place the CD in, or take the CD out of pause mode.
       The desired pause state is placed in io_Length.  This command only
       effects play commands.  When the audio is playing and the pausemode
       is set, this command will immediately pause the audio output
       suspending the play command until the play is unpaused.  When audio
       is not playing and the pausemode is set, this command will set the
       pause mode (having no immediate effect).  When a play command is
       submitted, the laser will seek to the appropriate position and pause
       at that spot.  The play command will be suspended until the play is
       unpaused (or the play is aborted).@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
       This command starts reading data off the disk at the specified
       location and deposits it into memory according to the nodes in a
       transfer list.  The pointer to the list of transfer nodes is placed
       in io_Data.  If you have a non-circular transfer list, simply set
       io_Length to 0 (0 is special and means ignore io_Length) -- your
       transfer will end when your transfer list has been exhausted.  If you
       have a circular transfer list, the list will never end.  In this case,
       the transfer will terminate when io_Length bytes have been
       transferred.

       The fields in the CDXL node structure are:

       @{"struct  CDXL" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 226} {

           @{"struct MinNode" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/nodes.h/File" 31}  Node;         /* double linkage                */
           char           *Buffer;       /* data destination              */
           @{"LONG" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/types.h/File" 51}            Length;       /* must be even # bytes          */
           @{"LONG" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/types.h/File" 51}            Actual;       /* bytes transferred             */
           @{"APTR" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/types.h/File" 49}            IntData;      /* interrupt server data segment */
           @{"VOID" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/types.h/File" 24}            (*IntCode)(); /* interrupt server code entry   */
           };

       The philosophy here is that you set up the buffers you want filled,
       create CDXL nodes describing the locations and sizes of these
       buffers, link all the nodes together in the order that you'd like
       (even make a circular list for animations), and execute the command.
       The data will be streamed into the appropriate buffers until the
       list has been exhausted, an entry with a Length of zero is
       encountered, io_Length bytes have been transferred (if io_Length is
       non-zero), or the command is aborted with @{"AbortIO()" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/exec/AbortIO"}.

       If you fill in the (*IntCode)() field with a pointer to an interrupt
       routine, your routine will be called when the transfer for the node
       is complete.  Your code will be called before the driver proceeds to
       the next node.  The interrupt should follow the same rules as standard
       interrupts (see @{"AddIntServer" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/exec/AddIntServer"} of Exec autodocs).  Register A2 will
       contain a pointer to the node just completed.  You may manipulate the
       list from within the interrupt. Your code must be brief (this is an
       interrupt).  When returning from this interrupt, D0 should be cleared
       and an RTS instruction should be used to return.

       Servers are called with the following register conventions:

           D0 - scratch
           D1 - scratch

           A0 - scratch
           A1 - server is_Data pointer (scratch)
           A2 - pointer to CDXL node just completed

           A5 - jump vector register (scratch)

           all other registers must be preserved@{b}

   EXAMPLE@{ub}@{b}

   NOTES@{ub}
       Try to make sure that small buffers are not overused.  Each time
       a node is completed, an interrupt is generated.  If you find that
       your computer is acting sluggish, or the @{"CD_READXL" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 53} command is
       aborting, you are probably generating too many interrupts.  It is
       not efficient to have more than a few of these interrupts generated
       within a vertical blank.

       Unlike the READ command, the READXL command will not retry a sector
       if there is an error.  Since the READXL command's purpose is primarily
       for animations, data streaming is considered more important than the
       data itself.  An error will be returned in io_Error if a data error
       did occur.  This command will never drop to a lower speed in the event
       of an error.@{b}

       The search mode can be set before the play command is sent, or during

       If @{"CD_SEARCH" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 59} is sent during a play, the play will automatically
       switch to the desired mode and continue playing until the original

       The io_Data field points to an array of CDTOC structures to receive
       the TOC data.

       The io_Length field specifies the total number of entries to be

       being equal to the location of the lead-out track minus the start of
       the first track (which is never zero).@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
       This command returns the table of contents of the disk currently in
       the drive.  The table of contents consists of up to 100 entries.
       Entry zero is summary information describing the number of tracks
       and the total number of minutes on the disk.  Entries 1 through N
       contain information about each individual track.  All position
       information will be in MSF format.

       The io_Data field points to an array of CDTOC structures to receive
       the TOC data.

       The io_Length field specifies the total number of entries to be
       fetched.  The array pointed to by io_Data must be at least this many
       elements in size.

       The io_Offset field specifies the entry number at which to start
       copying TOC data into *io_Data.

       Entry zero (the summary entry) contains the following:

       @{"struct TOCSummary" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 249} {

           @{"UBYTE" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/types.h/File" 62}        FirstTrack;    /* First track on disk (always 1)   */
           @{"UBYTE" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/types.h/File" 62}        LastTrack;     /* Last track on disk               */
           @{"union LSNMSF" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 202} LeadOut;       /* Beginning of lead-out track      */
           };

       Track entries (entries 1 through number of tracks) contain:

       @{"struct TOCEntry" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 257} {

           @{"UBYTE" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/types.h/File" 62}        CtlAdr;        /* Q-Code info                  */
           @{"UBYTE" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/exec/types.h/File" 62}        Track;         /* Track number                 */
           @{"union LSNMSF" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 202} Position;      /* Start position of this track */
           };

       CDTOC is described as a union between these two structures:

       @{"union CDTOC" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 265} {

           @{"struct TOCSummary" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 249} Summary;  /* First entry is summary info.  */
           @{"struct TOCEntry" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/Include/devices/cd.h/File" 257}   Entry;    /* Entries 1-N are track entries */
           };@{b}
