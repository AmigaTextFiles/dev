   FUNCTION@{ub}
        Indicate to the clipboard device that data is available for
        use by accessors of the clipboard.  This is intended to be
        used when a cut is large, in a private data format, and/or
        changing frequently, and it thus makes sense to avoid
        converting it to an IFF form and writing it to the clipboard
        unless another application wants it.  The post provides a
        message port to which the clipboard device will send a satisfy
        message if the data is required.

        If the satisfy message is received, the write associated with
        the post must be performed.  The act of writing the clip
        indicates that the message has been received: it may then be
        re-used by the clipboard device, and so must actually be
        removed from the satisfy message port so that the port is not
        corrupted.

        If the application wishes to determine if a post it has
        performed is still the current clip, it should check the
        post's io_ClipID with that returned by the @{"CBD_CURRENTREADID" LINK "CBD_CURRENTREADID"}
        command.  If the current read io_ClipID is greater, the clip
        is not still current.

        If an application has a pending post and wishes to determine
        if it should satisfy it (e.g. before it exits), it should
        check the post's io_ClipID with that returned by the
        @{"CBD_CURRENTWRITEID" LINK "CBD_CURRENTWRITEID"} command.  If the current write io_ClipID is
        greater, there is no need to satisfy the post.@{b}

@{b}

   NAME@{ub}
        @{"CMD_READ" LINK "gg:doc/NDK/Guide/console/CMD_READ"} -- Read from a clip on the clipboard.@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        The read function serves two purposes.

        When io_Offset is within the clip, this acts as a normal read
        request, and io_Data is filled with data from the clipboard.
        The first read request should have a zero io_ClipID, which
        will be filled with the ID assigned for this read.  Normal
        sequential access from the beginning of the clip is achieved
        by setting io_Offset to zero for the first read, then leaving
        it untouched for subsequent reads.  If io_Data is null, then
        io_Offset is incremented by io_Actual as if io_Length bytes
        had been read: this is useful to skip to the end of file
        by using a huge io_Length.

        When io_Offset is beyond the end of the clip, this acts as a
        signal to the clipboard device that the application is
        through reading this clip.  Realize that while an application
        is in the middle of reading a clip, any attempts to write new
        data to the clipboard are held off.  This read past the end
        of file indicates that those operations may now be initiated.@{b}

   FUNCTION@{ub}
        This command writes data to the clipboard.  This data can be
        provided sequentially by clearing io_Offset for the initial
        write, and using the incremented value unaltered for
        subsequent writes.  If io_Offset is ever beyond the current
        clip size, the clip is padded with zeros.

        If this write is in response to a SatisfyMsg for a pending
        post, then the io_ClipID returned by the @{"CBD_POST" LINK "CBD_POST"} command must
        be used.  Otherwise, a new ID is obtained by clearing the
        io_ClipID for the first write.  Subsequent writes must not
        alter the io_ClipID.@{b}
