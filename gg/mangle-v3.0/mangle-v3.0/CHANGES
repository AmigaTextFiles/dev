This release is a complete rewrite of 99% of the code. It should be
faster, less buggy, and much easier to maintain.

Please note that it is currently in beta stage. It may behave strangely at
times. If you find a bug, or it just flat out crumples and dies, please
send me the source you are trying to modify along with a description of
what arguments you used, etc.
