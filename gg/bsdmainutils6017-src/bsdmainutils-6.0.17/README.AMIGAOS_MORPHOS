 This port is based on Debian release of bsdmainutils. The following programs
have been removed from it due to some significant constraints of the
ixemul.library:

 calendar - requires Unicode support
 ncal	  - requires Unicode support
 look     - requires mmap functionality
 write	  - relies on full UNIX multiuser system (utmp/wtmp)

 Any questions regarding this port should be sent to
Pavel Fedin <sonic_amiga@rambler.ru>
