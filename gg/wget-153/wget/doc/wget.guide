Overview
********

   GNU Wget is a freely available network utility to retrieve files from
the World Wide Web, using HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) and FTP
(File Transfer Protocol), the two most widely used Internet protocols.
It has many useful features to make downloading easier, some of them
being:

   * Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the
     background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to
     start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget
     finish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require
     constant user's presence, which can be a great hindrance when
     transferring a lot of data.

   * Wget is capable of descending recursively through the structure of
     HTML documents and FTP directory trees, making a local copy of the
     directory hierarchy similar to the one on the remote server.  This
     feature can be used to mirror archives and home pages, or traverse
     the web in search of data, like a WWW robot (See @{"Robots" link "Robots"}).  In that
     spirit, Wget understands the @{b}norobots@{ub} convention.

   * File name wildcard matching and recursive mirroring of directories
     are available when retrieving via FTP.  Wget can read the
     time-stamp information given by both HTTP and FTP servers, and
     store it locally.  Thus Wget can see if the remote file has
     changed since last retrieval, and automatically retrieve the new
     version if it has.  This makes Wget suitable for mirroring of FTP
     sites, as well as home pages.

   * Wget works exceedingly well on slow or unstable connections,
     retrying the document until it is fully retrieved, or until a
     user-specified retry count is surpassed.  It will try to resume the
     download from the point of interruption, using @{b}REST@{ub} with FTP and
     @{b}Range@{ub} with HTTP servers that support them.

   * By default, Wget supports proxy servers, which can lighten the
     network load, speed up retrieval and provide access behind
     firewalls.  However, if you are behind a firewall that requires
     that you use a socks style gateway, you can get the socks library
     and build wget with support for socks.  Wget also supports the
     passive FTP downloading as an option.

   * Builtin features offer mechanisms to tune which links you wish to
     follow (See @{"Following Links" link "Following Links"}).

   * The retrieval is conveniently traced with printing dots, each dot
     representing a fixed amount of data received (1KB by default).
     These representations can be customized to your preferences.

   * Most of the features are fully configurable, either through
     command line options, or via the initialization file @{b}.wgetrc@{ub} (See
     @{"Startup File" link "Startup File"}).  Wget allows you to define @{i}global@{ui} startup files
     (@{b}/usr/local/etc/wgetrc@{ub} by default) for site settings.

   * Finally, GNU Wget is free software.  This means that everyone may
     use it, redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the
     GNU General Public License, as published by the Free Software
     Foundation (See @{"Copying" link "Copying"}).

Invoking
********

   By default, Wget is very simple to invoke.  The basic syntax is:

     wget [OPTION]... [URL]...

   Wget will simply download all the URLs specified on the command
line.  URL is a @{i}Uniform Resource Locator@{ui}, as defined below.

   However, you may wish to change some of the default parameters of
Wget.  You can do it two ways: permanently, adding the appropriate
command to @{b}.wgetrc@{ub} (See @{"Startup File" link "Startup File"}), or specifying it on the command
line.

@toc "Invoking"

URL Format
==========

@{i}   URL@{ui} is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator.  A uniform resource
locator is a compact string representation for a resource available via
the Internet.  Wget recognizes the URL syntax as per RFC1738.  This is
the most widely used form (square brackets denote optional parts):

     http://host[:port]/directory/file
     ftp://host[:port]/directory/file

   You can also encode your username and password within a URL:

     ftp://user:password@host/path
     http://user:password@host/path

   Either USER or PASSWORD, or both, may be left out.  If you leave out
either the HTTP username or password, no authentication will be sent.
If you leave out the FTP username, @{b}anonymous@{ub} will be used.  If you
leave out the FTP password, your email address will be supplied as a
default password.(1)

   You can encode unsafe characters in a URL as @{b}%xy@{ub}, @{b}xy@{ub} being the
hexadecimal representation of the character's ASCII value.  Some common
unsafe characters include @{b}%@{ub} (quoted as @{b}%25@{ub}), @{b}:@{ub} (quoted as @{b}%3A@{ub}), and @{b}\@@{ub}
(quoted as @{b}%40@{ub}).  Refer to RFC1738 for a comprehensive list of unsafe
characters.

   Wget also supports the @{b}type@{ub} feature for FTP URLs.  By default, FTP
documents are retrieved in the binary mode (type @{b}i@{ub}), which means that
they are downloaded unchanged.  Another useful mode is the @{b}a@{ub} (@{i}ASCII@{ui})
mode, which converts the line delimiters between the different
operating systems, and is thus useful for text files.  Here is an
example:

     ftp://host/directory/file;type=a

   Two alternative variants of URL specification are also supported,
because of historical (hysterical?) reasons and their wide-spreadedness.

   FTP-only syntax (supported by @{b}NcFTP@{ub}):
     host:/dir/file

   HTTP-only syntax (introduced by @{b}Netscape@{ub}):
     host[:port]/dir/file

   These two alternative forms are deprecated, and may cease being
supported in the future.

   If you do not understand the difference between these notations, or
do not know which one to use, just use the plain ordinary format you use
with your favorite browser, like @{b}Lynx@{ub} or @{b}Netscape@{ub}.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you have a @{b}.netrc@{ub} file in your home directory, password will
also be searched for there.

Option Syntax
=============

   Since Wget uses GNU getopts to process its arguments, every option
has a short form and a long form.  Long options are more convenient to
remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix different option
styles, or specify options after the command-line arguments. Thus you
may write:

     wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.cc.fer.hr/ -o log

   The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument
may be omitted.  Instead @{b}-o log@{ub} you can write @{b}-olog@{ub}.

   You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
like:

     wget -drc URL

   This is a complete equivalent of:

     wget -d -r -c URL

   Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
terminate them with @{b}--@{ub}.  So the following will try to download URL @{b}-x@{ub},
reporting failure to @{b}log@{ub}:

     wget -o log -- -x

   The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the
convention that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This can be
useful to clear the @{b}.wgetrc@{ub} settings.  For instance, if your @{b}.wgetrc@{ub}
sets @{b}exclude_directories@{ub} to @{b}/cgi-bin@{ub}, the following example will first
reset it, and then set it to exclude @{b}/~nobody@{ub} and @{b}/~somebody@{ub}.  You can
also clear the lists in @{b}.wgetrc@{ub} (See @{"Wgetrc Syntax" link "Wgetrc Syntax"}).

     wget -X '' -X /~nobody,/~somebody

Basic Startup Options
=====================

@{b}-V@{ub}
@{b}--version@{ub}
     Display the version of Wget.

@{b}-h@{ub}
@{b}--help@{ub}
     Print a help message describing all of Wget's command-line options.

@{b}-b@{ub}
@{b}--background@{ub}
     Go to background immediately after startup.  If no output file is
     specified via the @{b}-o@{ub}, output is redirected to @{b}wget-log@{ub}.

@{b}-e COMMAND@{ub}
@{b}--execute COMMAND@{ub}
     Execute COMMAND as if it were a part of @{b}.wgetrc@{ub} (See
     @{"Startup File" link "Startup File"}).  A command thus invoked will be executed @{i}after@{ui}
     the commands in @{b}.wgetrc@{ub}, thus taking precedence over them.


@endnode

@node "Logging and Input File Options" "wget.guide/Logging and Input File Options"
@next "Download Options"
@prev "Basic Startup Options"
@toc "Invoking"

Logging and Input File Options
==============================

@{b}-o LOGFILE@{ub}
@{b}--output-file=LOGFILE@{ub}
     Log all messages to LOGFILE.  The messages are normally reported
     to standard error.

@{b}-a LOGFILE@{ub}
@{b}--append-output=LOGFILE@{ub}
     Append to LOGFILE.  This is the same as @{b}-o@{ub}, only it appends to
     LOGFILE instead of overwriting the old log file.  If LOGFILE does
     not exist, a new file is created.

@{b}-d@{ub}
@{b}--debug@{ub}
     Turn on debug output, meaning various information important to the
     developers of Wget if it does not work properly.  Your system
     administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without debug
     support, in which case @{b}-d@{ub} will not work.  Please note that
     compiling with debug support is always safe--Wget compiled with
     the debug support will @{i}not@{ui} print any debug info unless requested
     with @{b}-d@{ub}.  See @{"Reporting Bugs" link "Reporting Bugs"} for more information on how to use
     @{b}-d@{ub} for sending bug reports.

@{b}-q@{ub}
@{b}--quiet@{ub}
     Turn off Wget's output.

@{b}-v@{ub}
@{b}--verbose@{ub}
     Turn on verbose output, with all the available data.  The default
     output is verbose.

@{b}-nv@{ub}
@{b}--non-verbose@{ub}
     Non-verbose output--turn off verbose without being completely quiet
     (use @{b}-q@{ub} for that), which means that error messages and basic
     information still get printed.

@{b}-i FILE@{ub}
@{b}--input-file=FILE@{ub}
     Read URLs from FILE, in which case no URLs need to be on the
     command line.  If there are URLs both on the command line and in
     an input file, those on the command lines will be the first ones to
     be retrieved.  The FILE need not be an HTML document (but no harm
     if it is)--it is enough if the URLs are just listed sequentially.

     However, if you specify @{b}--force-html@{ub}, the document will be
     regarded as @{b}html@{ub}.  In that case you may have problems with
     relative links, which you can solve either by adding @{b}<base
     href="URL">@{ub} to the documents or by specifying @{b}--base=URL@{ub} on the
     command line.

@{b}-F@{ub}
@{b}--force-html@{ub}
     When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an HTML
     file.  This enables you to retrieve relative links from existing
     HTML files on your local disk, by adding @{b}<base href="URL">@{ub} to
     HTML, or using the @{b}--base@{ub} command-line option.

Download Options
================

@{b}-t NUMBER@{ub}
@{b}--tries=NUMBER@{ub}
     Set number of retries to NUMBER.  Specify 0 or @{b}inf@{ub} for infinite
     retrying.

@{b}-O FILE@{ub}
@{b}--output-document=FILE@{ub}
     The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but
     all will be concatenated together and written to FILE.  If FILE
     already exists, it will be overwritten.  If the FILE is @{b}-@{ub}, the
     documents will be written to standard output.  Including this
     option automatically sets the number of tries to 1.

@{b}-nc@{ub}
@{b}--no-clobber@{ub}
     Do not clobber existing files when saving to directory hierarchy
     within recursive retrieval of several files. This option is
     @{i}extremely@{ui} useful when you wish to continue where you left off with
     retrieval of many files.  If the files have the @{b}.html@{ub} or (yuck)
     @{b}.htm@{ub} suffix, they will be loaded from the local disk, and parsed
     as if they have been retrieved from the Web.

@{b}-c@{ub}
@{b}--continue@{ub}
     Continue getting an existing file.  This is useful when you want to
     finish up the download started by another program, or a previous
     instance of Wget.  Thus you can write:

          wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z

     If there is a file name @{b}ls-lR.Z@{ub} in the current directory, Wget
     will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and
     will require the server to continue the retrieval from an offset
     equal to the length of the local file.

     Note that you need not specify this option if all you want is Wget
     to continue retrieving where it left off when the connection is
     lost--Wget does this by default.  You need this option only when
     you want to continue retrieval of a file already halfway
     retrieved, saved by another FTP client, or left by Wget being
     killed.

     Without @{b}-c@{ub}, the previous example would just begin to download the
     remote file to @{b}ls-lR.Z.1@{ub}.  The @{b}-c@{ub} option is also applicable for
     HTTP servers that support the @{b}Range@{ub} header.

@{b}--dot-style=STYLE@{ub}
     Set the retrieval style to STYLE.  Wget traces the retrieval of
     each document by printing dots on the screen, each dot
     representing a fixed amount of retrieved data.  Any number of dots
     may be separated in a @{i}cluster@{ui}, to make counting easier.  This
     option allows you to choose one of the pre-defined styles,
     determining the number of bytes represented by a dot, the number
     of dots in a cluster, and the number of dots on the line.

     With the @{b}default@{ub} style each dot represents 1K, there are ten dots
     in a cluster and 50 dots in a line.  The @{b}binary@{ub} style has a more
     "computer"-like orientation--8K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots
     per line (which makes for 384K lines).  The @{b}mega@{ub} style is suitable
     for downloading very large files--each dot represents 64K
     retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each
     line (so each line contains 3M).  The @{b}micro@{ub} style is exactly the
     reverse; it is suitable for downloading small files, with 128-byte
     dots, 8 dots per cluster, and 48 dots (6K) per line.

@{b}-N@{ub}
@{b}--timestamping@{ub}
     Turn on time-stamping.  See @{"Time-Stamping" link "Time-Stamping"} for details.

@{b}-S@{ub}
@{b}--server-response@{ub}
     Print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by FTP
     servers.

@{b}--spider@{ub}
     When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web @{i}spider@{ui},
     which means that it will not download the pages, just check that
     they are there.  You can use it to check your bookmarks, e.g. with:

          wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html

     This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the
     functionality of real WWW spiders.

@{b}-T seconds@{ub}
@{b}--timeout=SECONDS@{ub}
     Set the read timeout to SECONDS seconds.  Whenever a network read
     is issued, the file descriptor is checked for a timeout, which
     could otherwise leave a pending connection (uninterrupted read).
     The default timeout is 900 seconds (fifteen minutes).  Setting
     timeout to 0 will disable checking for timeouts.

     Please do not lower the default timeout value with this option
     unless you know what you are doing.

@{b}-w SECONDS@{ub}
@{b}--wait=SECONDS@{ub}
     Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.  Use
     of this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by
     making the requests less frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the
     time can be specified in minutes using the @{b}m@{ub} suffix, in hours
     using @{b}h@{ub} suffix, or in days using @{b}d@{ub} suffix.

     Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network
     or the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough
     to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the
     retry.

@{b}-Y on/off@{ub}
@{b}--proxy=on/off@{ub}
     Turn proxy support on or off. The proxy is on by default if the
     appropriate environmental variable is defined.

@{b}-Q QUOTA@{ub}
@{b}--quota=QUOTA@{ub}
     Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value can be
     specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with @{b}k@{ub} suffix), or
     megabytes (with @{b}m@{ub} suffix).

     Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So
     if you specify @{b}wget -Q10k ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls-lR.gz@{ub}, all
     of the @{b}ls-lR.gz@{ub} will be downloaded.  The same goes even when
     several URLs are specified on the command-line.  However, quota is
     respected when retrieving either recursively, or from an input
     file.  Thus you may safely type @{b}wget -Q2m -i sites@{ub}--download will
     be aborted when the quota is exceeded.

     Setting quota to 0 or to @{b}inf@{ub} unlimits the download quota.

Directory Options
=================

@{b}-nd@{ub}
@{b}--no-directories@{ub}
     Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving
     recursively. With this option turned on, all files will get saved
     to the current directory, without clobbering (if a name shows up
     more than once, the filenames will get extensions @{b}.n@{ub}).

@{b}-x@{ub}
@{b}--force-directories@{ub}
     The opposite of @{b}-nd@{ub}--create a hierarchy of directories, even if
     one would not have been created otherwise.  E.g. @{b}wget -x
     http://fly.cc.fer.hr/robots.txt@{ub} will save the downloaded file to
     @{b}fly.cc.fer.hr/robots.txt@{ub}.

@{b}-nH@{ub}
@{b}--no-host-directories@{ub}
     Disable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By default,
     invoking Wget with @{b}-r http://fly.cc.fer.hr/@{ub} will create a
     structure of directories beginning with @{b}fly.cc.fer.hr/@{ub}.  This
     option disables such behavior.

@{b}--cut-dirs=NUMBER@{ub}
     Ignore NUMBER directory components.  This is useful for getting a
     fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval
     will be saved.

     Take, for example, the directory at
     @{b}ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/@{ub}.  If you retrieve it with @{b}-r@{ub}, it
     will be saved locally under @{b}ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/@{ub}.  While the
     @{b}-nH@{ub} option can remove the @{b}ftp.xemacs.org/@{ub} part, you are still
     stuck with @{b}pub/xemacs@{ub}.  This is where @{b}--cut-dirs@{ub} comes in handy; it
     makes Wget not "see" NUMBER remote directory components.  Here are
     several examples of how @{b}--cut-dirs@{ub} option works.

          No options        -> ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
          -nH               -> pub/xemacs/
          -nH --cut-dirs=1  -> xemacs/
          -nH --cut-dirs=2  -> .
          
          --cut-dirs=1      -> ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
          ...

     If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this
     option is similar to a combination of @{b}-nd@{ub} and @{b}-P@{ub}.  However, unlike
     @{b}-nd@{ub}, @{b}--cut-dirs@{ub} does not lose with subdirectories--for instance,
     with @{b}-nH --cut-dirs=1@{ub}, a @{b}beta/@{ub} subdirectory will be placed to
     @{b}xemacs/beta@{ub}, as one would expect.

@{b}-P PREFIX@{ub}
@{b}--directory-prefix=PREFIX@{ub}
     Set directory prefix to PREFIX.  The @{i}directory prefix@{ui} is the
     directory where all other files and subdirectories will be saved
     to, i.e. the top of the retrieval tree.  The default is @{b}.@{ub} (the
     current directory).

HTTP Options
============

@{b}--http-user=USER@{ub}
@{b}--http-passwd=PASSWORD@{ub}
     Specify the username USER and password PASSWORD on an HTTP server.
     According to the type of the challenge, Wget will encode them
     using either the @{b}basic@{ub} (insecure) or the @{b}digest@{ub} authentication
     scheme.

     Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself
     (See @{"URL Format" link "URL Format"}).  For more information about security issues with
     Wget, See @{"Security Considerations" link "Security Considerations"}.

@{b}-C on/off@{ub}
@{b}--cache=on/off@{ub}
     When set to off, disable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget
     will send the remote server an appropriate directive (@{b}Pragma:
     no-cache@{ub}) to get the file from the remote service, rather than
     returning the cached version.  This is especially useful for
     retrieving and flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers.

     Caching is allowed by default.

@{b}--ignore-length@{ub}
     Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more
     precise) send out bogus @{b}Content-Length@{ub} headers, which makes Wget
     go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.  You can
     spot this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again
     and again, each time claiming that the (otherwise normal)
     connection has closed on the very same byte.

     With this option, Wget will ignore the @{b}Content-Length@{ub} header--as
     if it never existed.

@{b}--header=ADDITIONAL-HEADER@{ub}
     Define an ADDITIONAL-HEADER to be passed to the HTTP servers.
     Headers must contain a @{b}:@{ub} preceded by one or more non-blank
     characters, and must not contain newlines.

     You may define more than one additional header by specifying
     @{b}--header@{ub} more than once.

          wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \\
               --header='Accept-Language: hr'        \\
                 http://fly.cc.fer.hr/

     Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all
     previous user-defined headers.

@{b}--proxy-user=USER@{ub}
@{b}--proxy-passwd=PASSWORD@{ub}
     Specify the username USER and password PASSWORD for authentication
     on a proxy server.  Wget will encode them using the @{b}basic@{ub}
     authentication scheme.

@{b}-s@{ub}
@{b}--save-headers@{ub}
     Save the headers sent by the HTTP server to the file, preceding the
     actual contents, with an empty line as the separator.

@{b}-U AGENT-STRING@{ub}
@{b}--user-agent=AGENT-STRING@{ub}
     Identify as AGENT-STRING to the HTTP server.

     The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a
     @{b}User-Agent@{ub} header field.  This enables distinguishing the WWW
     software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of
     protocol violations.  Wget normally identifies as @{b}Wget/VERSION@{ub},
     VERSION being the current version number of Wget.

     However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of
     tailoring the output according to the @{b}User-Agent@{ub}-supplied
     information.  While conceptually this is not such a bad idea, it
     has been abused by servers denying information to clients other
     than @{b}Mozilla@{ub} or Microsoft @{b}Internet Explorer@{ub}.  This option allows
     you to change the @{b}User-Agent@{ub} line issued by Wget.  Use of this
     option is discouraged, unless you really know what you are doing.

@{b}     NOTE@{ub} that Netscape Communications Corp. has claimed that false
     transmissions of @{b}Mozilla@{ub} as the @{b}User-Agent@{ub} are a copyright
     infringement, which will be prosecuted.  @{b}DO NOT@{ub} misrepresent Wget
     as Mozilla.

FTP Options
===========

@{b}--retr-symlinks@{ub}
     Retrieve symbolic links on FTP sites as if they were plain files,
     i.e. don't just create links locally.

@{b}-g on/off@{ub}
@{b}--glob=on/off@{ub}
     Turn FTP globbing on or off.  Globbing means you may use the
     shell-like special characters (@{i}wildcards@{ui}), like @{b}*@{ub}, @{b}?@{ub}, @{b}[@{ub} and @{b}]@{ub} to
     retrieve more than one file from the same directory at once, like:

          wget ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr/*.msg

     By default, globbing will be turned on if the URL contains a
     globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing on
     or off permanently.

     You may have to quote the URL to protect it from being expanded by
     your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing,
     which is system-specific.  This is why it currently works only
     with Unix FTP servers (and the ones emulating Unix @{b}ls@{ub} output).

@{b}--passive-ftp@{ub}
     Use the @{i}passive@{ui} FTP retrieval scheme, in which the client
     initiates the data connection.  This is sometimes required for FTP
     to work behind firewalls.

Recursive Retrieval Options
===========================

@{b}-r@{ub}
@{b}--recursive@{ub}
     Turn on recursive retrieving.  See @{"Recursive Retrieval" link "Recursive Retrieval"} for more
     details.

@{b}-l DEPTH@{ub}
@{b}--level=DEPTH@{ub}
     Specify recursion maximum depth level DEPTH (See
     @{"Recursive Retrieval" link "Recursive Retrieval"}).  The default maximum depth is 5.

@{b}--delete-after@{ub}
     This option tells Wget to delete every single file it downloads,
     @{i}after@{ui} having done so.  It is useful for pre-fetching popular pages
     through proxy, e.g.:

          wget -r -nd --delete-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/

     The @{b}-r@{ub} option is to retrieve recursively, and @{b}-nd@{ub} not to create
     directories.

@{b}-k@{ub}
@{b}--convert-links@{ub}
     Convert the non-relative links to relative ones locally.  Only the
     references to the documents actually downloaded will be converted;
     the rest will be left unchanged.

     Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which
     links have been downloaded.  Because of that, much of the work
     done by @{b}-k@{ub} will be performed at the end of the downloads.

@{b}-m@{ub}
@{b}--mirror@{ub}
     Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on
     recursion and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and
     keeps FTP directory listings.  It is currently equivalent to @{b}-r -N
     -l inf -nr@{ub}.

@{b}-nr@{ub}
@{b}--dont-remove-listing@{ub}
     Don't remove the temporary @{b}.listing@{ub} files generated by FTP
     retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory
     listings received from FTP servers.  Not removing them can be
     useful to access the full remote file list when running a mirror,
     or for debugging purposes.

@{b}-D DOMAIN-LIST@{ub}
@{b}--domains=DOMAIN-LIST@{ub}
     Set domains to be accepted and DNS looked-up, where DOMAIN-LIST is

@{b}-L@{ub}
@{b}--relative@{ub}
     Follow relative links only.  Useful for retrieving a specific home
     page without any distractions, not even those from the same hosts
     (See @{"Relative Links" link "Relative Links"}).

@{b}--follow-ftp@{ub}
     Follow FTP links from HTML documents.  Without this option, Wget

Recursive Retrieval
*******************

   GNU Wget is capable of traversing parts of the Web (or a single HTTP
or FTP server), depth-first following links and directory structure.
This is called @{i}recursive@{ui} retrieving, or @{i}recursion@{ui}.

   With HTTP URLs, Wget retrieves and parses the HTML from the given
URL, documents, retrieving the files the HTML document was referring
to, through markups like @{b}href@{ub}, or @{b}src@{ub}.  If the freshly downloaded file
is also of type @{b}text/html@{ub}, it will be parsed and followed further.

   The maximum @{i}depth@{ui} to which the retrieval may descend is specified
with the @{b}-l@{ub} option (the default maximum depth is five layers).  See
@{"Recursive Retrieval" link "Recursive Retrieval"}.

   When retrieving an FTP URL recursively, Wget will retrieve all the
data from the given directory tree (including the subdirectories up to
the specified depth) on the remote server, creating its mirror image
locally.  FTP retrieval is also limited by the @{b}depth@{ub} parameter.

   By default, Wget will create a local directory tree, corresponding to
the one found on the remote server.

   Recursive retrieving can find a number of applications, the most
important of which is mirroring.  It is also useful for WWW
presentations, and any other opportunities where slow network
connections should be bypassed by storing the files locally.

   You should be warned that invoking recursion may cause grave
overloading on your system, because of the fast exchange of data
through the network; all of this may hamper other users' work.  The
same stands for the foreign server you are mirroring--the more requests
it gets in a rows, the greater is its load.

   Careless retrieving can also fill your file system unctrollably,
which can grind the machine to a halt.

   The load can be minimized by lowering the maximum recursion level
(@{b}-l@{ub}) and/or by lowering the number of retries (@{b}-t@{ub}).  You may also
consider using the @{b}-w@{ub} option to slow down your requests to the remote
servers, as well as the numerous options to narrow the number of
followed links (See @{"Following Links" link "Following Links"}).

   Recursive retrieval is a good thing when used properly.  Please take
all precautions not to wreak havoc through carelessness.

Following Links
***************

   When retrieving recursively, one does not wish to retrieve the loads
of unnecessary data.  Most of the time the users bear in mind exactly
what they want to download, and want Wget to follow only specific links.

   For example, if you wish to download the music archive from
@{b}fly.cc.fer.hr@{ub}, you will not want to download all the home pages that
happen to be referenced by an obscure part of the archive.

   Wget possesses several mechanisms that allows you to fine-tune which
links it will follow.


 @{" Relative Links        " link "Relative Links"}  Follow relative links only.
 @{" Host Checking         " link "Host Checking"}  Follow links on the same host.
 @{" Domain Acceptance     " link "Domain Acceptance"}  Check on a list of domains.
 @{" All Hosts             " link "All Hosts"}  No host restrictions.
 @{" Types of Files        " link "Types of Files"}  Getting only certain files.
 @{" Directory-Based Limits " link "Directory-Based Limits"}  Getting only certain directories.
 @{" FTP Links             " link "FTP Links"}  Following FTP links.

Relative Links
==============

   When only relative links are followed (option @{b}-L@{ub}), recursive
retrieving will never span hosts.  No time-expensive DNS-lookups will
be performed, and the process will be very fast, with the minimum
strain of the network.  This will suit your needs often, especially when
mirroring the output of various @{b}x2html@{ub} converters, since they generally
output relative links.


@endnode

@node "Host Checking" "wget.guide/Host Checking"
@next "Domain Acceptance"
@prev "Relative Links"
@toc "Following Links"

Host Checking
=============

   The drawback of following the relative links solely is that humans
often tend to mix them with absolute links to the very same host, and
the very same page.  In this mode (which is the default mode for
following links) all URLs the that refer to the same host will be
retrieved.

   The problem with this option are the aliases of the hosts and
domains.  Thus there is no way for Wget to know that @{b}regoc.srce.hr@{ub} and
@{b}www.srce.hr@{ub} are the same host, or that @{b}fly.cc.fer.hr@{ub} is the same as
@{b}fly.cc.etf.hr@{ub}.  Whenever an absolute link is encountered, the host is
DNS-looked-up with @{b}gethostbyname@{ub} to check whether we are maybe dealing
with the same hosts.  Although the results of @{b}gethostbyname@{ub} are cached,
it is still a great slowdown, e.g. when dealing with large indices of
home pages on different hosts (because each of the hosts must be and
DNS-resolved to see whether it just @{i}might@{ui} an alias of the starting
host).

   To avoid the overhead you may use @{b}-nh@{ub}, which will turn off
DNS-resolving and make Wget compare hosts literally.  This will make
things run much faster, but also much less reliable (e.g. @{b}www.srce.hr@{ub}
and @{b}regoc.srce.hr@{ub} will be flagged as different hosts).

   Note that modern HTTP servers allows one IP address to host several
@{i}virtual servers@{ui}, each having its own directory hieratchy.  Such
"servers" are distinguished by their hostnames (all of which point to
the same IP address); for this to work, a client must send a @{b}Host@{ub}
header, which is what Wget does.  However, in that case Wget @{i}must not@{ui}
try to divine a host's "real" address, nor try to use the same hostname
for each access, i.e. @{b}-nh@{ub} must be turned on.

   In other words, the @{b}-nh@{ub} option must be used to enabling the
retrieval from virtual servers distinguished by their hostnames.  As the
number of such server setups grow, the behavior of @{b}-nh@{ub} may become the
default in the future.

@node "Domain Acceptance" "wget.guide/Domain Acceptance"
@next "All Hosts"
@prev "Host Checking"
@toc "Following Links"

Domain Acceptance
=================

   With the @{b}-D@{ub} option you may specify the domains that will be
followed.  The hosts the domain of which is not in this list will not be
DNS-resolved.  Thus you can specify @{b}-Dmit.edu@{ub} just to make sure that
@{b}nothing outside of MIT gets looked up@{ub}.  This is very important and
useful.  It also means that @{b}-D@{ub} does @{i}not@{ui} imply @{b}-H@{ub} (span all hosts),
which must be specified explicitly.  Feel free to use this options
since it will speed things up, with almost all the reliability of
checking for all hosts.  Thus you could invoke

     wget -r -D.hr http://fly.cc.fer.hr/

   to make sure that only the hosts in @{b}.hr@{ub} domain get DNS-looked-up for
being equal to @{b}fly.cc.fer.hr@{ub}.  So @{b}fly.cc.etf.hr@{ub} will be checked (only
once!) and found equal, but @{b}www.gnu.ai.mit.edu@{ub} will not even be checked.

   Of course, domain acceptance can be used to limit the retrieval to
particular domains with spanning of hosts in them, but then you must
specify @{b}-H@{ub} explicitly.  E.g.:

     wget -r -H -Dmit.edu,stanford.edu http://www.mit.edu/

   will start with @{b}http://www.mit.edu/@{ub}, following links across MIT and
Stanford.

   If there are domains you want to exclude specifically, you can do it
with @{b}--exclude-domains@{ub}, which accepts the same type of arguments of @{b}-D@{ub},
but will @{i}exclude@{ui} all the listed domains.  For example, if you want to
download all the hosts from @{b}foo.edu@{ub} domain, with the exception of
@{b}sunsite.foo.edu@{ub}, you can do it like this:

     wget -rH -Dfoo.edu --exclude-domains sunsite.foo.edu http://www.foo.edu/

All Hosts
=========

   When @{b}-H@{ub} is specified without @{b}-D@{ub}, all hosts are freely spanned.
There are no restrictions whatsoever as to what part of the net Wget
will go to fetch documents, other than maximum retrieval depth.  If a
page references @{b}www.yahoo.com@{ub}, so be it.  Such an option is rarely
useful for itself.


@endnode

@node "Types of Files" "wget.guide/Types of Files"
@next "Directory-Based Limits"
@prev "All Hosts"
@toc "Following Links"

Types of Files
==============

   When downloading material from the web, you will often want to
restrict the retrieval to only certain file types.  For example, if you
are interested in downloading GIFS, you will not be overjoyed to get
loads of Postscript documents, and vice versa.

   Wget offers two options to deal with this problem.  Each option
description lists a short name, a long name, and the equivalent command
in @{b}.wgetrc@{ub}.

@{b}-A ACCLIST@{ub}
@{b}--accept ACCLIST@{ub}
@{b}accept = ACCLIST@{ub}
     The argument to @{b}--accept@{ub} option is a list of file suffixes or
     patterns that Wget will download during recursive retrieval.  A
     suffix is the ending part of a file, and consists of "normal"
     letters, e.g. @{b}gif@{ub} or @{b}.jpg@{ub}.  A matching pattern contains shell-like
     wildcards, e.g. @{b}books*@{ub} or @{b}zelazny*196[0-9]*@{ub}.

     So, specifying @{b}wget -A gif,jpg@{ub} will make Wget download only the
     files ending with @{b}gif@{ub} or @{b}jpg@{ub}, i.e. GIFs and JPEGs.  On the other
     hand, @{b}wget -A "zelazny*196[0-9]*"@{ub} will download only files
     beginning with @{b}zelazny@{ub} and containing numbers from 1960 to 1969
     anywhere within.  Look up the manual of your shell for a
     description of how pattern matching works.

     Of course, any number of suffixes and patterns can be combined
     into a comma-separated list, and given as an argument to @{b}-A@{ub}.

@{b}-R REJLIST@{ub}
@{b}--reject REJLIST@{ub}
@{b}reject = REJLIST@{ub}
     The @{b}--reject@{ub} option works the same way as @{b}--accept@{ub}, only its logic
     is the reverse; Wget will download all files @{i}except@{ui} the ones
     matching the suffixes (or patterns) in the list.

     So, if you want to download a whole page except for the cumbersome
     MPEGs and .AU files, you can use @{b}wget -R mpg,mpeg,au@{ub}.
     Analogously, to download all files except the ones beginning with
     @{b}bjork@{ub}, use @{b}wget -R "bjork*"@{ub}.  The quotes are to prevent expansion
     by the shell.

   The @{b}-A@{ub} and @{b}-R@{ub} options may be combined to achieve even better
fine-tuning of which files to retrieve.  E.g. @{b}wget -A "*zelazny*" -R
.ps@{ub} will download all the files having @{b}zelazny@{ub} as a part of their name,
but @{i}not@{ui} the postscript files.

   Note that these two options do not affect the downloading of HTML
files; Wget must load all the HTMLs to know where to go at
all--recursive retrieval would make no sense otherwise.

@node "Directory-Based Limits" "wget.guide/Directory-Based Limits"
@next "FTP Links"
@prev "Types of Files"
@toc "Following Links"

Directory-Based Limits
======================

   Regardless of other link-following facilities, it is often useful to
place the restriction of what files to retrieve based on the directories
those files are placed in.  There can be many reasons for this--the
home pages may be organized in a reasonable directory structure; or some
directories may contain useless information, e.g. @{b}/cgi-bin@{ub} or @{b}/dev@{ub}
directories.

   Wget offers three different options to deal with this requirement.
Each option description lists a short name, a long name, and the
equivalent command in @{b}.wgetrc@{ub}.

@{b}-I LIST@{ub}
@{b}--include LIST@{ub}
@{b}include_directories = LIST@{ub}
@{b}     -I@{ub} option accepts a comma-separated list of directories included
     in the retrieval.  Any other directories will simply be ignored.
     The directories are absolute paths.

     So, if you wish to download from @{b}http://host/people/bozo/@{ub}
     following only links to bozo's colleagues in the @{b}/people@{ub} directory
     and the bogus scripts in @{b}/cgi-bin@{ub}, you can specify:

          wget -I /people,/cgi-bin http://host/people/bozo/

@{b}-X LIST@{ub}
@{b}--exclude LIST@{ub}
@{b}exclude_directories = LIST@{ub}
@{b}     -X@{ub} option is exactly the reverse of @{b}-I@{ub}--this is a list of
     directories @{i}excluded@{ui} from the download.  E.g. if you do not want
     Wget to download things from @{b}/cgi-bin@{ub} directory, specify @{b}-X
     /cgi-bin@{ub} on the command line.

     The same as with @{b}-A@{ub}/@{b}-R@{ub}, these two options can be combined to get a
     better fine-tuning of downloading subdirectories.  E.g. if you
     want to load all the files from @{b}/pub@{ub} hierarchy except for
     @{b}/pub/worthless@{ub}, specify @{b}-I/pub -X/pub/worthless@{ub}.

@{b}-np@{ub}
@{b}--no-parent@{ub}
@{b}no_parent = on@{ub}
     The simplest, and often very useful way of limiting directories is
     disallowing retrieval of the links that refer to the hierarchy
     @{i}upper@{ui} than the beginning directory, i.e. disallowing ascent to the
     parent directory/directories.

     The @{b}--no-parent@{ub} option (short @{b}-np@{ub}) is useful in this case.  Using
     it guarantees that you will never leave the existing hierarchy.
     Supposing you issue Wget with:

          wget -r --no-parent http://somehost/~luzer/my-archive/

     You may rest assured that none of the references to
     @{b}/~his-girls-homepage/@{ub} or @{b}/~luzer/all-my-mpegs/@{ub} will be followed.
     Only the archive you are interested in will be downloaded.
     Essentially, @{b}--no-parent@{ub} is similar to @{b}-I/~luzer/my-archive@{ub}, only
     it handles redirections in a more intelligent fashion.

Following FTP Links
===================

   The rules for FTP are somewhat specific, as it is necessary for them
to be.  FTP links in HTML documents are often included for purposes of
reference, and it is often inconvenient to download them by default.

   To have FTP links followed from HTML documents, you need to specify
the @{b}--follow-ftp@{ub} option.  Having done that, FTP links will span hosts
regardless of @{b}-H@{ub} setting.  This is logical, as FTP links rarely point
to the same host where the HTTP server resides.  For similar reasons,
the @{b}-L@{ub} options has no effect on such downloads.  On the other hand,
domain acceptance (@{b}-D@{ub}) and suffix rules (@{b}-A@{ub} and @{b}-R@{ub}) apply normally.

   Also note that followed links to FTP directories will not be
retrieved recursively further.

Time-Stamping
*************

   One of the most important aspects of mirroring information from the
Internet is updating your archives.

   Downloading the whole archive again and again, just to replace a few
changed files is expensive, both in terms of wasted bandwidth and money,
and the time to do the update.  This is why all the mirroring tools
offer the option of incremental updating.

   Such an updating mechanism means that the remote server is scanned in
search of @{i}new@{ui} files.  Only those new files will be downloaded in the
place of the old ones.

   A file is considered new if one of these two conditions are met:

  1. A file of that name does not already exist locally.

  2. A file of that name does exist, but the remote file was modified
     more recently than the local file.

   To implement this, the program needs to be aware of the time of last
modification of both remote and local files.  Such information are
called the @{i}time-stamps@{ui}.

   The time-stamping in GNU Wget is turned on using @{b}--timestamping@{ub} (@{b}-N@{ub})
option, or through @{b}timestamping = on@{ub} directive in @{b}.wgetrc@{ub}.  With this
option, for each file it intends to download, Wget will check whether a
local file of the same name exists.  If it does, and the remote file is
older, Wget will not download it.

   If the local file does not exist, or the sizes of the files do not
match, Wget will download the remote file no matter what the time-stamps
say.

@prev "Time-Stamping"
@toc "Time-Stamping"

Time-Stamping Usage
===================

   The usage of time-stamping is simple.  Say you would like to
download a file so that it keeps its date of modification.

     wget -S http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/

   A simple @{b}ls -l@{ub} shows that the time stamp on the local file equals
the state of the @{b}Last-Modified@{ub} header, as returned by the server.  As
you can see, the time-stamping info is preserved locally, even without
@{b}-N@{ub}.

   Several days later, you would like Wget to check if the remote file
has changed, and download it if it has.

     wget -N http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/

   Wget will ask the server for the last-modified date.  If the local
file is newer, the remote file will not be re-fetched.  However, if the
remote file is more recent, Wget will proceed fetching it normally.

   The same goes for FTP.  For example:

     wget ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/emacs/gnus/*

@{b}   ls@{ub} will show that the timestamps are set according to the state on
the remote server.  Reissuing the command with @{b}-N@{ub} will make Wget
re-fetch @{i}only@{ui} the files that have been modified.

   In both HTTP and FTP retrieval Wget will time-stamp the local file
correctly (with or without @{b}-N@{ub}) if it gets the stamps, i.e. gets the
directory listing for FTP or the @{b}Last-Modified@{ub} header for HTTP.

   If you wished to mirror the GNU archive every week, you would use the
following command every week:

     wget --timestamping -r ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/

HTTP Time-Stamping Internals
============================

   Time-stamping in HTTP is implemented by checking of the
@{b}Last-Modified@{ub} header.  If you wish to retrieve the file @{b}foo.html@{ub}
through HTTP, Wget will check whether @{b}foo.html@{ub} exists locally.  If it
doesn't, @{b}foo.html@{ub} will be retrieved unconditionally.

   If the file does exist locally, Wget will first check its local
time-stamp (similar to the way @{b}ls -l@{ub} checks it), and then send a @{b}HEAD@{ub}
request to the remote server, demanding the information on the remote
file.

   The @{b}Last-Modified@{ub} header is examined to find which file was modified
more recently (which makes it "newer").  If the remote file is newer,
it will be downloaded; if it is older, Wget will give up.(1)

   Arguably, HTTP time-stamping should be implemented using the
@{b}If-Modified-Since@{ub} request.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) As an additional check, Wget will look at the @{b}Content-Length@{ub}
header, and compare the sizes; if they are not the same, the remote
file will be downloaded no matter what the time-stamp says.

@toc "Time-Stamping"

FTP Time-Stamping Internals
===========================

   In theory, FTP time-stamping works much the same as HTTP, only FTP
has no headers--time-stamps must be received from the directory
listings.

   For each directory files must be retrieved from, Wget will use the
@{b}LIST@{ub} command to get the listing.  It will try to analyze the listing,
assuming that it is a Unix @{b}ls -l@{ub} listing, and extract the time-stamps.
The rest is exactly the same as for HTTP.

   Assumption that every directory listing is a Unix-style listing may
sound extremely constraining, but in practice it is not, as many
non-Unix FTP servers use the Unixoid listing format because most (all?)
of the clients understand it.  Bear in mind that RFC959 defines no
standard way to get a file list, let alone the time-stamps.  We can
only hope that a future standard will define this.

   Another non-standard solution includes the use of @{b}MDTM@{ub} command that
is supported by some FTP servers (including the popular @{b}wu-ftpd@{ub}), which
returns the exact time of the specified file.  Wget may support this
command in the future.

Startup File
************

   Once you know how to change default settings of Wget through command
line arguments, you may wish to make some of those settings permanent.
You can do that in a convenient way by creating the Wget startup
file--@{b}.wgetrc@{ub}.

   Besides @{b}.wgetrc@{ub} is the "main" initialization file, it is convenient
to have a special facility for storing passwords.  Thus Wget reads and
interprets the contents of @{b}$HOME/.netrc@{ub}, if it finds it.  You can find
@{b}.netrc@{ub} format in your system manuals.

   Wget reads @{b}.wgetrc@{ub} upon startup, recognizing a limited set of
commands.

Wgetrc Location
===============

   When initializing, Wget will look for a @{i}global@{ui} startup file,
@{b}/usr/local/etc/wgetrc@{ub} by default (or some prefix other than @{b}/usr/local@{ub},
if Wget was not installed there) and read commands from there, if it
exists.

   Then it will look for the user's file.  If the environmental variable
@{b}WGETRC@{ub} is set, Wget will try to load that file.  Failing that, no
further attempts will be made.

   If @{b}WGETRC@{ub} is not set, Wget will try to load @{b}$HOME/.wgetrc@{ub}.

   The fact that user's settings are loaded after the system-wide ones
means that in case of collision user's wgetrc @{i}overrides@{ui} the system-wide
wgetrc (in @{b}/usr/local/etc/wgetrc@{ub} by default).  Fascist admins, away!

Wgetrc Syntax
=============

   The syntax of a wgetrc command is simple:

     variable = value

   The @{i}variable@{ui} will also be called @{i}command@{ui}.  Valid @{i}values@{ui} are
different for different commands.

   The commands are case-insensitive and underscore-insensitive.  Thus
@{b}DIr__PrefiX@{ub} is the same as @{b}dirprefix@{ub}.  Empty lines, lines beginning
with @{b}#@{ub} and lines containing white-space only are discarded.

   Commands that expect a comma-separated list will clear the list on an
empty command.  So, if you wish to reset the rejection list specified in
global @{b}wgetrc@{ub}, you can do it with:

     reject =

     Set proxy authentication password to STRING, like @{b}--proxy-passwd@{ub}.

quiet = on/off
     Quiet mode, the same as @{b}-q@{ub}.

quota = QUOTA
     Specify the download quota, which is useful to put in global
     wgetrc. When download quota is specified, Wget will stop retrieving
     after the download sum has become greater than quota.  The quota
     can be specified in bytes (default), kbytes @{b}k@{ub} appended) or mbytes
     (@{b}m@{ub} appended).  Thus @{b}quota = 5m@{ub} will set the quota to 5 mbytes.

@node "Simple Usage" "wget.guide/Simple Usage"

@toc "Examples"

Simple Usage
============

   * Say you want to download a URL.  Just type:

          wget http://fly.cc.fer.hr/

     The response will be something like:

          --13:30:45--  http://fly.cc.fer.hr:80/en/
                     => `index.html'
          Connecting to fly.cc.fer.hr:80... connected!
          HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
          Length: 4,694 [text/html]
          
              0K -> ....                                                   [100%]
          
          13:30:46 (23.75 KB/s) - `index.html' saved [4694/4694]

   * But what will happen if the connection is slow, and the file is
     lengthy?  The connection will probably fail before the whole file
     is retrieved, more than once.  In this case, Wget will try getting
     the file until it either gets the whole of it, or exceeds the
     default number of retries (this being 20).  It is easy to change
     the number of tries to 45, to insure that the whole file will
     arrive safely:

          wget --tries=45 http://fly.cc.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg

   * Now let's leave Wget to work in the background, and write its
     progress to log file @{b}log@{ub}.  It is tiring to type @{b}--tries@{ub}, so we
     shall use @{b}-t@{ub}.

          wget -t 45 -o log http://fly.cc.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg &

     The ampersand at the end of the line makes sure that Wget works in
     the background.  To unlimit the number of retries, use @{b}-t inf@{ub}.

   * The usage of FTP is as simple.  Wget will take care of login and
     password.

          $ wget ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr/welcome.msg
          --10:08:47--  ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr:21/welcome.msg
                     => `welcome.msg'
          Connecting to gnjilux.cc.fer.hr:21... connected!
          Logging in as anonymous ... Logged in!
          ==> TYPE I ... done.  ==> CWD not needed.
          ==> PORT ... done.    ==> RETR welcome.msg ... done.
          Length: 1,340 (unauthoritative)
          
              0K -> .                                                      [100%]
          
          10:08:48 (1.28 MB/s) - `welcome.msg' saved [1340]

   * If you specify a directory, Wget will retrieve the directory
     listing, parse it and convert it to HTML.  Try:

          wget ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/
          lynx index.html


@endnode

@node "Advanced Usage" "wget.guide/Advanced Usage"
@next "Guru Usage"
@prev "Simple Usage"
@toc "Examples"

Advanced Usage
==============

   * You would like to read the list of URLs from a file?  Not a problem
     with that:

          wget -i file

     If you specify @{b}-@{ub} as file name, the URLs will be read from standard
     input.

   * Create a mirror image of GNU WWW site (with the same directory
     structure the original has) with only one try per document, saving
     the log of the activities to @{b}gnulog@{ub}:

          wget -r -t1 http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/ -o gnulog

   * Retrieve the first layer of yahoo links:

          wget -r -l1 http://www.yahoo.com/

   * Retrieve the index.html of @{b}www.lycos.com@{ub}, showing the original
     server headers:

          wget -S http://www.lycos.com/

   * Save the server headers with the file:
          wget -s http://www.lycos.com/
          more index.html

   * Retrieve the first two levels of @{b}wuarchive.wustl.edu@{ub}, saving them
     to /tmp.

          wget -P/tmp -l2 ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/

   * You want to download all the GIFs from an HTTP directory.  @{b}wget
     http://host/dir/*.gif@{ub} doesn't work, since HTTP retrieval does not
     support globbing.  In that case, use:

          wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A.gif http://host/dir/

     It is a bit of a kludge, but it works.  @{b}-r -l1@{ub} means to retrieve
     recursively (See @{"Recursive Retrieval" link "Recursive Retrieval"}), with maximum depth of 1.
     @{b}--no-parent@{ub} means that references to the parent directory are
     ignored (See @{"Directory-Based Limits" link "Directory-Based Limits"}), and @{b}-A.gif@{ub} means to
     download only the GIF files.  @{b}-A "*.gif"@{ub} would have worked too.

   * Suppose you were in the middle of downloading, when Wget was
     interrupted.  Now you do not want to clobber the files already
     present.  It would be:

          wget -nc -r http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/

   * If you want to encode your own username and password to HTTP or
     FTP, use the appropriate URL syntax (See @{"URL Format" link "URL Format"}).

          wget ftp://hniksic:mypassword@jagor.srce.hr/.emacs

   * If you do not like the default retrieval visualization (1K dots
     with 10 dots per cluster and 50 dots per line), you can customize
     it through dot settings (See @{"Wgetrc Commands" link "Wgetrc Commands"}).  For example, many
     people like the "binary" style of retrieval, with 8K dots and 512K
     lines:

          wget --dot-style=binary ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/README

     You can experiment with other styles, like:

          wget --dot-style=mega ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/xemacs-20.4/xemacs-20.4.tar.gz
          wget --dot-style=micro http://fly.cc.fer.hr/

     To make these settings permanent, put them in your @{b}.wgetrc@{ub}, as
     described before (See @{"Sample Wgetrc" link "Sample Wgetrc"}).

Guru Usage
==========

   * If you wish Wget to keep a mirror of a page (or FTP
     subdirectories), use @{b}--mirror@{ub} (@{b}-m@{ub}), which is the shorthand for @{b}-r
     -N@{ub}.  You can put Wget in the crontab file asking it to recheck a
     site each Sunday:

          crontab
          0 0 * * 0 wget --mirror ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/ -o /home/me/weeklog

   * You may wish to do the same with someone's home page.  But you do
     not want to download all those images--you're only interested in
     HTML.

          wget --mirror -A.html http://www.w3.org/

   * But what about mirroring the hosts networkologically close to you?
     It seems so awfully slow because of all that DNS resolving.  Just
     use @{b}-D@{ub} (See @{"Domain Acceptance" link "Domain Acceptance"}).

          wget -rN -Dsrce.hr http://www.srce.hr/

     Now Wget will correctly find out that @{b}regoc.srce.hr@{ub} is the same as
     @{b}www.srce.hr@{ub}, but will not even take into consideration the link to
     @{b}www.mit.edu@{ub}.

   * You have a presentation and would like the dumb absolute links to
     be converted to relative?  Use @{b}-k@{ub}:

          wget -k -r URL

   * You would like the output documents to go to standard output
     instead of to files?  OK, but Wget will automatically shut up
     (turn on @{b}--quiet@{ub}) to prevent mixing of Wget output and the
     retrieved documents.

          wget -O - http://jagor.srce.hr/ http://www.srce.hr/

     You can also combine the two options and make weird pipelines to
     retrieve the documents from remote hotlists:

          wget -O - http://cool.list.com/ | wget --force-html -i -

Proxies
=======

@{i}   Proxies@{ui} are special-purpose HTTP servers designed to transfer data
from remote servers to local clients.  One typical use of proxies is
lightening network load for users behind a slow connection.  This is
achieved by channeling all HTTP and FTP requests through the proxy
which caches the transferred data.  When a cached resource is requested
again, proxy will return the data from cache.  Another use for proxies
is for companies that separate (for security reasons) their internal
networks from the rest of Internet.  In order to obtain information
from the Web, their users connect and retrieve remote data using an
authorized proxy.

   Wget supports proxies for both HTTP and FTP retrievals.  The
standard way to specify proxy location, which Wget recognizes, is using
the following environment variables:

@{b}http_proxy@{ub}
     This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for HTTP
     connections.

@{b}ftp_proxy@{ub}
     This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for HTTP
     connections.  It is quite common that HTTP_PROXY and FTP_PROXY are
     set to the same URL.

@{b}no_proxy@{ub}
     This variable should contain a comma-separated list of domain
     extensions proxy should @{i}not@{ui} be used for.  For instance, if the
     value of @{b}no_proxy@{ub} is @{b}.mit.edu@{ub}, proxy will not be used to retrieve
     documents from MIT.

   In addition to the environment variables, proxy location and settings
may be specified from within Wget itself.

@{b}-Y on/off@{ub}
@{b}--proxy=on/off@{ub}
@{b}proxy = on/off@{ub}
     This option may be used to turn the proxy support on or off.  Proxy
     support is on by default, provided that the appropriate environment
     variables are set.

@{b}http_proxy = URL@{ub}
@{b}ftp_proxy = URL@{ub}
@{b}no_proxy = STRING@{ub}
     These startup file variables allow you to override the proxy
     settings specified by the environment.

   Some proxy servers require authorization to enable you to use them.
The authorization consists of @{i}username@{ui} and @{i}password@{ui}, which must be sent
by Wget.  As with HTTP authorization, several authentication schemes
exist.  For proxy authorization only the @{b}Basic@{ub} authentication scheme is
currently implemented.

   You may specify your username and password either through the proxy
URL or through the command-line options.  Assuming that the company's
proxy is located at @{b}proxy.srce.hr@{ub} at port 8001, a proxy URL location
containing authorization data might look like this:

     http://hniksic:mypassword@proxy.company.com:8001/

   Alternatively, you may use the @{b}proxy-user@{ub} and @{b}proxy-password@{ub}
options, and the equivalent @{b}.wgetrc@{ub} settings @{b}proxy_user@{ub} and
@{b}proxy_passwd@{ub} to set the proxy username and password.

============

   Like all GNU utilities, the latest version of Wget can be found at
the master GNU archive site prep.ai.mit.edu, and its mirrors.  For
example, Wget 1.5.3 can be found at

============

   Wget has its own mailing list at <wget@sunsite.auc.dk>, thanks to
Karsten Thygesen.  The mailing list is for discussion of Wget features
and web, reporting Wget bugs (those that you think may be of interest
to the public) and mailing announcements.  You are welcome to
subscribe.  The more people on the list, the better!

   To subscribe, send mail to <wget-subscribe@sunsite.auc.dk>.  the
magic word @{b}subscribe@{ub} in the subject line.  Unsubscribe by mailing to

Reporting Bugs
==============

   You are welcome to send bug reports about GNU Wget to
<bug-wget@gnu.org>.  The bugs that you think are of the interest to the
public (i.e. more people should be informed about them) can be Cc-ed to
the mailing list at <wget@sunsite.auc.dk>.

   Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.

  1. Please try to ascertain that the behaviour you see really is a
     bug.  If Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If Wget does not behave as
     documented, it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not
     sure about the way they are supposed to work, it might well be a
     bug.

  2. Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.
     E.g. if Wget crashes on @{b}wget -rLl0 -t5 -Y0 http://yoyodyne.com -o
     /tmp/log@{ub}, you should try to see if it will crash with a simpler
     set of options.

     Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of
     your @{b}.wgetrc@{ub} file, just dumping it into the debug message is
     probably a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see if the
     bug repeats with @{b}.wgetrc@{ub} moved out of the way.  Only if it turns
     out that @{b}.wgetrc@{ub} settings affect the bug, should you mail me the
     relevant parts of the file.

  3. Please start Wget with @{b}-d@{ub} option and send the log (or the relevant
     parts of it).  If Wget was compiled without debug support,
     recompile it.  It is @{i}much@{ui} easier to trace bugs with debug support
     on.

  4. If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. @{b}gdb `which
     wget` core@{ub} and type @{b}where@{ub} to get the backtrace.

  5. Find where the bug is, fix it and send me the patches. :-)

Portability
===========

   Since Wget uses GNU Autoconf for building and configuring, and avoids
using "special" ultra-mega-cool features of any particular Unix, it
should compile (and work) on all common Unix flavors.

   Various Wget versions have been compiled and tested under many kinds
of Unix systems, including Solaris, Linux, SunOS, OSF (aka Digital
Unix), Ultrix, *BSD, IRIX, and others; refer to the file @{b}MACHINES@{ub} in the
distribution directory for a comprehensive list.  If you compile it on
an architecture not listed there, please let me know so I can update it.

   Wget should also compile on the other Unix systems, not listed in
@{b}MACHINES@{ub}.  If it doesn't, please let me know.

   Thanks to kind contributors, this version of Wget compiles and works
on Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT platforms.  It has been compiled
successfully using MS Visual C++ 4.0, Watcom, and Borland C compilers,
with Winsock as networking software.  Naturally, it is crippled of some
features available on Unix, but it should work as a substitute for
people stuck with Windows.  Note that the Windows port is @{b}neither
tested nor maintained@{ub} by me--all questions and problems should be
reported to Wget mailing list at <wget@sunsite.auc.dk> where the
maintainers will look at them.

@node "Signals" "wget.guide/Signals"

@toc "Various"

Signals
=======

   Since the purpose of Wget is background work, it catches the hangup
signal (@{b}SIGHUP@{ub}) and ignores it.  If the output was on standard output,
it will be redirected to a file named @{b}wget-log@{ub}.  Otherwise, @{b}SIGHUP@{ub} is
ignored.  This is convenient when you wish to redirect the output of
Wget after having started it.

     $ wget http://www.ifi.uio.no/~larsi/gnus.tar.gz &
     $ kill -HUP %%     # Redirect the output to wget-log

   Other than that, Wget will not try to interfere with signals in any
way. @{b}C-c@{ub}, @{b}kill -TERM@{ub} and @{b}kill -KILL@{ub} should kill it alike.

Robots
======

   Since Wget is able to traverse the web, it counts as one of the Web
@{i}robots@{ui}.  Thus Wget understands @{i}Robots Exclusion Standard@{ui}
(RES)--contents of @{b}/robots.txt@{ub}, used by server administrators to shield
parts of their systems from wanderings of Wget.

   Norobots support is turned on only when retrieving recursively, and
@{i}never@{ui} for the first page.  Thus, you may issue:

     wget -r http://fly.cc.fer.hr/

   First the index of fly.cc.fer.hr will be downloaded.  If Wget finds
anything worth downloading on the same host, only @{i}then@{ui} will it load the
robots, and decide whether or not to load the links after all.
@{b}/robots.txt@{ub} is loaded only once per host.  Wget does not support the
robots @{b}META@{ub} tag.

   The description of the norobots standard was written, and is
maintained by Martijn Koster <m.koster@webcrawler.com>.  With his
permission, I contribute a (slightly modified) texified version of the
RES.

Introduction to RES
-------------------

@{i}   WWW Robots@{ui} (also called @{i}wanderers@{ui} or @{i}spiders@{ui}) are programs that
traverse many pages in the World Wide Web by recursively retrieving
linked pages. For more information see the robots page.

   In 1993 and 1994 there have been occasions where robots have visited
WWW servers where they weren't welcome for various reasons. Sometimes
these reasons were robot specific, e.g. certain robots swamped servers
with rapid-fire requests, or retrieved the same files repeatedly. In
other situations robots traversed parts of WWW servers that weren't
suitable, e.g. very deep virtual trees, duplicated information,
temporary information, or cgi-scripts with side-effects (such as
voting).

   These incidents indicated the need for established mechanisms for
WWW servers to indicate to robots which parts of their server should
not be accessed. This standard addresses this need with an operational
solution.

   This document represents a consensus on 30 June 1994 on the robots
mailing list (@{b}robots@webcrawler.com@{ub}), between the majority of robot
authors and other people with an interest in robots. It has also been
open for discussion on the Technical World Wide Web mailing list
(@{b}www-talk@info.cern.ch@{ub}). This document is based on a previous working
draft under the same title.

   It is not an official standard backed by a standards body, or owned
by any commercial organization. It is not enforced by anybody, and there
no guarantee that all current and future robots will use it. Consider
it a common facility the majority of robot authors offer the WWW
community to protect WWW server against unwanted accesses by their
robots.

   The latest version of this document can be found at
@{b}http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/norobots.html@{ub}.

RES Format
----------

   The format and semantics of the @{b}/robots.txt@{ub} file are as follows:

   The file consists of one or more records separated by one or more
blank lines (terminated by @{b}CR@{ub}, @{b}CR/NL@{ub}, or @{b}NL@{ub}).  Each record contains
lines of the form:

     <field>:<optionalspace><value><optionalspace>

   The field name is case insensitive.

   Comments can be included in file using UNIX bourne shell conventions:
the @{b}#@{ub} character is used to indicate that preceding space (if any) and
the remainder of the line up to the line termination is discarded.
Lines containing only a comment are discarded completely, and therefore
do not indicate a record boundary.

   The record starts with one or more User-agent lines, followed by one
or more Disallow lines, as detailed below. Unrecognized headers are
ignored.

   The presence of an empty @{b}/robots.txt@{ub} file has no explicit associated
semantics, it will be treated as if it was not present, i.e. all robots
will consider themselves welcome.


@endnode

@node "User-Agent Field" "wget.guide/User-Agent Field"
@next "Disallow Field"
@prev "RES Format"
@toc "Robots"

User-Agent Field
----------------

   The value of this field is the name of the robot the record is
describing access policy for.

   If more than one User-agent field is present the record describes an
identical access policy for more than one robot.  At least one field
needs to be present per record.

   The robot should be liberal in interpreting this field. A case
insensitive substring match of the name without version information is
recommended.

   If the value is @{b}*@{ub}, the record describes the default access policy
for any robot that has not matched any of the other records. It is not
allowed to have multiple such records in the @{b}/robots.txt@{ub} file.


@endnode

@node "Disallow Field" "wget.guide/Disallow Field"
@next "Norobots Examples"
@prev "User-Agent Field"
@toc "Robots"

Disallow Field
--------------

   The value of this field specifies a partial URL that is not to be
visited. This can be a full path, or a partial path; any URL that
starts with this value will not be retrieved. For example,
@{b}Disallow: /help@{ub} disallows both @{b}/help.html@{ub} and @{b}/help/index.html@{ub}, whereas
@{b}Disallow: /help/@{ub} would disallow @{b}/help/index.html@{ub} but allow @{b}/help.html@{ub}.

   Any empty value, indicates that all URLs can be retrieved. At least
one Disallow field needs to be present in a record.


@endnode

@node "Norobots Examples" "wget.guide/Norobots Examples"
@prev "Disallow Field"
@toc "Robots"

Norobots Examples
-----------------

   The following example @{b}/robots.txt@{ub} file specifies that no robots
should visit any URL starting with @{b}/cyberworld/map/@{ub} or @{b}/tmp/@{ub}:

     # robots.txt for http://www.site.com/
     
     User-agent: *
     Disallow: /cyberworld/map/ # This is an infinite virtual URL space
     Disallow: /tmp/ # these will soon disappear

   This example @{b}/robots.txt@{ub} file specifies that no robots should visit
any URL starting with @{b}/cyberworld/map/@{ub}, except the robot called
@{b}cybermapper@{ub}:

     # robots.txt for http://www.site.com/
     
     User-agent: *
     Disallow: /cyberworld/map/ # This is an infinite virtual URL space
     
     # Cybermapper knows where to go.
     User-agent: cybermapper
     Disallow:

   This example indicates that no robots should visit this site further:

     # go away
     User-agent: *
     Disallow: /

Security Considerations
=======================

   When using Wget, you must be aware that it sends unencrypted
passwords through the network, which may present a security problem.
Here are the main issues, and some solutions.

  1. The passwords on the command line are visible using @{b}ps@{ub}.  If this
     is a problem, avoid putting passwords from the command line--e.g.
     you can use @{b}.netrc@{ub} for this.

  2. Using the insecure @{i}basic@{ui} authentication scheme, unencrypted
     passwords are transmitted through the network routers and gateways.

  3. The FTP passwords are also in no way encrypted.  There is no good
     solution for this at the moment.

  4. Although the "normal" output of Wget tries to hide the passwords,
     debugging logs show them, in all forms.  This problem is avoided by
     being careful when you send debug logs (yes, even when you send
     them to me).

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

 10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.

   The hypothetical commands @{b}show w@{ub} and @{b}show c@{ub} should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than @{b}show w@{ub} and @{b}show c@{ub};
they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.
     
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.
