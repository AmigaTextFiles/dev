						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

I know that there are lots of university students, lecturers etc on this list.

Is anyone doing Astro Physics or similar?

I've just seen a program on the Hubble Telescope and the big bang.   
What they were saying didn't seem to make sense so if anyone 
reckons that they can explain all this to an intelligent layman, please

Hi all,

Does anyone on this list use the PC version of Blitz. If so is it capable of
doing 2D games or is it 3D only. If it can do 2D what sort of performance are
we talking about, 50 frames per second? Also how does it compare to DarkBasic.

Thanks everyone,

Best wishes,
Jason.

The original BlitzPC is 2D only, and costs, err, $20 or something. Blitz3D 
(which does 3D ;) costs $100 I think.

>From the demos, both are very fast on my machine, but I've got a Duron750 and

From: Nick Clover <bauk@...>
Date: 10-17-01 02:18:29
Subject: @{b}detecting if workbench is frontscreen@{ub}

Greetings,

I've got a small problem....

I've added a function to automatically toggle gtgadgets as you move the mouse
over them and a routine to automatically activate the window if you move the
mouse over it. The problem I have is that it works too well :)

If I move the mouse over the area my window is in on ANOTHER SCREEN it activates
my window :(

Is there a way I can store the name of the screen my program opened on (Usually 
Workbench) and only check the mouse-over stuff if that screen is the frontmost?

Cheers

The .screen type includes a pointer to the screen title. Use that, first to get
your host screen name, and later to get the current screen name before you
activate your window. That should do it :o)

Comparing strings, blegh ;)

Why not just do:

*myscreen.Screen = Peek.l(Addr Screen(Used Screen))

; in the subroutine
myscreenactive=0
*ib.IntuitionBase=IntuitionBase ; I'm sure you could find a better way of
                                ; doing this without using this command
ilock.l=LockIBase_(0)
If *myscreen=*ib\ActiveScreen Then myscreenactive=-1
; Alternatively, you can check *ib\FirstScreen for the frontmost screen
UnLockIBase_ ilock

If myscreenactive
; Do stuff
EndIf

0L and 0l you mean? They simply force the compiler to use an unsigned long 
value (L) or a signed long value (l). It's just to make sure it uses a 
longword and not a 16 bit value. The way to do it in Blitz is the way you 
mention.

Subject: @{b}Gadgets & Mouse@{ub}

Hello blitzers !

This is my last question for the next four weeks for sure !

Is there any possibility to check via IDCMP-messages if the mouse pointer is over an gadget in a window ?

Is use the IDCMP_HELPxxx event for my program, but as this only gives a message after a special time, it is not usable for a mouse-over-gadget-checking...

You mean IDCMP_GADGETHELP? Well, if that's not suitable, I guess you'd need to 
manually check gadgets yourself.

If you check on each IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE event, you should be able to check the 
gadgets as soon as the mouse is moved. I'm not sure what the fastest way of 
doing the checks are though, but you'd want it really fast or your program 
would be sluggish.

I guess you could partition your gadgets up into different areas, e.g. gadgets 
in the topleft, topright, bottomleft and bottomright corners of your window. 
Then, depending on where the mouse position is, you only need to check one of 
those four areas.

To check each area, I guess you could just have some arrays with the top, 
left, width and height of each gadget which you could compare against the 
mouse pointer.

I think BOOPSI gadgets can do this stuff automatically, or you could try the 
GadgetMouse_ function from intuition.library (although it looks as if it will 
only check one gadget - so it basically would do the same thing as you).

I'm not aware of any other OS functions for it, but I could be wrong.

I tried IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE for a similar function but I never got any feedback (yes I
did add it the the windows IDCMP flags) I eventually had to use a  -  repeat, check mouse,
check events, wait a  bit - loop to get it to work :(

Below is the routine I use (not very good but it works)...

.main
  Repeat
    If autogads
      ev.l=0
      Repeat
        JSR gadgeton
        Delay_ 2
        ev.l = Event
      Until ev>0
    Else

No, there are none. You either need to implement a custom drawing routine via 
the ListView callback hook, use MUI or make your own GTListview-alike gadget 
out of individual gadgets (which is basically writing your own drawing routine 
but a lot easier that using the callback hook).

IIRC Tony Rolfe wrote his own GTListView-alike gadget. I can't remember if he 
posted the source here or not though.

You're not often wrong, David, but that wasn't me.

All I did was a series of functions which had all the standard stuff in 
them to validate input from GTString gadgets.   (Even my numbers are 
taken from GTStrings).

Nothing as fancy as that though.

From: amorel <amorel@...>
Date: 10-15-01 01:24:23
Subject: @{b}listview/slider scrolling@{ub}

This is really bugging me. I have this problem with NCS that for example a 
listview does not auto update when scrolling after a number of updates. I 
thought this was a bug in NCS(maybe it still is). But I have now 
implemented everything with pure os functions but it still happens. And I 
do use the #LISTVIEWIDCMP tag etc.

My code does this:

DEFTYPE .Window *w0, *w5, *w9
DEFTYPE .IntuiMessage *idcmp0, *idcmp5, *idcmp9

signals.l=Wait_(*w0\UserPort|*w5\UserPort|*w9\UserPort)
;adding a wait_() or an nvwait does not noticably change how things work
  
    *idcmp0=GT_GetIMsg_(*w0\UserPort)
    *idcmp5=GT_GetIMsg_(*w5\UserPort)
    *idcmp9=GT_GetIMsg_(*w9\UserPort)
    
    While *idcmp0<>0 ;window 0 got a message
      Select *idcmp0\Class

        Case #IDCMP_GADGETUP
          ;do stuff
          GT_ReplyIMsg_(*w0\WindowPort)

        Case #IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW
          GT_ReplyIMsg_(*w0\WindowPort)
          Goto cleanend

        Default
          GT_ReplyIMsg_(*w0\WindowPort)

      End Select

      *idcmp0=GT_GetIMsg_(*w0\UserPort)
    Wend

etcetera.

Now why the hell does it NOT work as I want it to. I know it`s not hard, I
am able to do it without problems in my player using Blitz gadtools and
window functions(but I now avoid those for obvious reasons). Though the
listview in the main window of my player is not set to be able to auto
update, strangely it prevents the updating of window drawing/gadget
updating from module notes being played. But that`s another story.

#LISTVIEWIDCMP is not a tag, you need to combine it with your IDCMP flags when 
you open the window.

You're not waiting correctly, it should be e.g. (1 LSL *w0\UserPort\mp_SigBit) 
not just the userport in each case.

>      Select *idcmp0\Class

You shouldn't really do this, ini case your program takes a while to do the 
processing for anything. You are supposed to reply as quickly as possible to 
the message. In reality, this means taking a copy of the fields you are 
interested in and then doing a reply.

One last thing, how are you opening your windows? When I was trying to find 
the bug in the NCS I was doing different combinations of NCS and OS code, but 
I cannot remember the results. You might still get this problem if you open 
the window with NCS code and then use OS code to process the messages.

LSL means Logically Shift Left. What it does is shift the value on the left 
hand side of LSL to the left by the number of binary places specified in the 
right hand side of LSL, e.g.

1 LSL 2 = %0000000001 LSL 2 = %0000000100
1 LSL 15 = %000000000000001 LSL 15 = %000000000000001

You need to do this because the Wait_ command takes a signal mask. To get the 
signal mask for a Window's message port (or any other message port) is to 
shift the value 1 to the left by the number of places specified in the SigBit 
field of the message port.

You still need to take a copy of the fields, not just the pointer. Something 
like this (if you want to copy all the fields - you could just copy them 
individually):

DEFTYPE.IntuiMessage *idcmp0, imsg0 ; Note, no pointer for the second one

;NVWait ; Not needed if you are doing a "Wait_"

; This should all be on one line
sigmask.l = (1 LSL *w0\UserPort\mp_SigBit) | (1 LSL *w5\UserPort\mp_SigBit) | 
(1 LSL *w9\UserPort\mp_SigBit) |

signals.l=Wait_(sigmask)

If signals & (1 LSL *w0\UserPort\mp_SigBit)
  *idcmp0 = GT_GetIMsg_(*w0\UserPort)
  While *idcmp0
    CopyMem_ *idcmp0,&imsg0,SizeOf.IntuiMessage
    GT_ReplyIMsg_ *idcmp0

    Select imsg0\Class
      Case #IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW
        ; etc
    End Select
    *idcmp0 = GT_GetIMsg_(*w0\UserPort)
  Wend
EndIf

If signals & (1 LSL *w5\UserPort\mp_SigBit)
  ; Like above but for window 5

OK, I'll trust you on that one :)

LSL means Logically Shift Left. What it does is shift the value on the left 
hand side of LSL to the left by the number of binary places specified in the 
right hand side of LSL, e.g.

1 LSL 2 = %0000000001 LSL 2 = %0000000100
1 LSL 15 = %000000000000001 LSL 15 = %000000000000001

You need to do this because the Wait_ command takes a signal mask. To get the 
signal mask for a Window's message port (or any other message port) is to 
shift the value 1 to the left by the number of places specified in the SigBit 
field of the message port.

You still need to take a copy of the fields, not just the pointer. Something 
like this (if you want to copy all the fields - you could just copy them 
individually):

DEFTYPE.IntuiMessage *idcmp0, imsg0 ; Note, no pointer for the second one

;NVWait ; Not needed if you are doing a "Wait_"

; This should all be on one line
sigmask.l = (1 LSL *w0\UserPort\mp_SigBit) | (1 LSL *w5\UserPort\mp_SigBit) | 
(1 LSL *w9\UserPort\mp_SigBit) |

signals.l=Wait_(sigmask)

If signals & (1 LSL *w0\UserPort\mp_SigBit)
  *idcmp0 = GT_GetIMsg_(*w0\UserPort)
  While *idcmp0
    CopyMem_ *idcmp0,&imsg0,SizeOf.IntuiMessage
    GT_ReplyIMsg_ *idcmp0

    Select imsg0\Class
      Case #IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW
        ; etc
    End Select
    *idcmp0 = GT_GetIMsg_(*w0\UserPort)
  Wend
EndIf

If signals & (1 LSL *w5\UserPort\mp_SigBit)
  ; Like above but for window 5
EndIf

If signals & (1 LSL *w9\UserPort\mp_SigBit)

Not really. I`ve had far too many terrible crashes by placing an os function

There`s not much error checking and debugging going in in that area :-(

C=#LISTVIEWIDCMP is a constant, so Blitz just replaces that with the defined

Yeah, my mistake. It dopes compile and work correctly. Cause luckily the os

it out to make sure.

It's not a bug.

in C you would do like this:

if (imsg0.IAddress->ng_GadgetID <= 8)

If the next line doesn't work in blitz then you have to copy the address 
first:

if imsg0\*IAddress\ng_GadgetID <= 8

That's because the IAddress is pointer and not a substructure of imsg0.

Not really, unless you define your own IntuiMessage structure which has the 
IAddress field set up to be *IAddress.Gadget.

In C you could cast it (dynamically make the compile treat the pointer like 
another type) but not in Blitz.

In normal circumstances, you don't actually need notification of a string gadget
in MUI. MUI and EFMUILib take care of the string contents themselves.

I'm going to make a couple of assumptions. 1. that you've created the gadget
using

MUIString obj no.,"String contents",Maxlen

TBH, I usually use MUIString obj no,"",maxlen and set the string contents
separately, but whichever works for you.

The second assumption is that the string object is part of a GUI which will have
something like an "OK" button, and that you have correctly set up the
notification on that button, AND that you are not concerned with the string
contents until the button is pressed. If so, your code would look something
like this:-

;MUI intialisiation stuff, including any other gadgets. The obj numbers in the
example are for demonstration purposes only, and you should replace them as
your application requires.

;The following constant can be anything you choose, as long as the number is
unique, and you define it at the start of your prog

#ID_OK=10

MUIString 10,"",64
MUISimpleButton 11,"OK"

;Rest of MUI objects.

MUIAddObjsHGroup 12,10,11 ;You would of course use AddObjsVGroup if it's a
vertical                               ;group and include all objects in the
group as required.

;Finish your MUI stuff, including initialising the window.

MUINotifyApp 11,#MUIA_Pressed,0,#ID_OK

;Then, in you main loop, after you've opened the window

ev.l=MUIWaitEvent
Select ev
    Case #ID_OK
    mystring$=MUIGetString(11)

;stick the rest of your stuff here

End Select

;The string contents will now be found in mystring$

You can set the string contents using MUISetString 11,NewString$

If you do want mui to react everytime the string contents change (unlikely), let
me know. I'm sure I can figure out a way using the #MUIV_EveryTime flag.

Hi,

I am slowly getting used to creating an MUI interface, and have come across
something strange, which hopefully someone can shed some light on.

Basically  I have created a label (using MUILabel) and I would like to
center it within a group. SO logically I looked for a tag. In the EFMUI
docs it says that these tags are in MUI_Label.doc. But I have looked
everywhere for it and cannot find it.

Does it exist?

It does NOT appear to be in the mui3.8 developer archive, so I guess it 
doesn't exist. Perhaps mui_text.doc is the one you need to look at.

As for centering an object in a group, surely it would be some tag for the 
group you'd need to use?

Well I thought the same about some sort of group tag, but no there is
nothing mentioned in the autodocs. I have had a look at the mui_text doc
and there is an escape sequencne to centre text but I am not sure how to
get it to work with the MUI_Label, or to actually use the specific 'Text'
commands.

OK, using the MUILabel command:-

MUILabel Obj No,"Label Text",#MUIO_Label_Centered

will centre a label in the window (I'm not sure about how it would perform in a
HGroup, though). However, there seems to be a bug with the MUILabel command
which will stop the GUI resizing if you use it. To get around this, create your
own instead:-

MUINewObject obj
no,"Text.mui",#MUIA_Frame,#MUIV_Frame_String,#MUIA_Text_Contents,
&gdisp$,#MUIA_Background,#MUII_TextBack

(all on one line) will create a text object with a string frame around it,
containt the text defined in gdisp$ using the standard background colour. You
can apply other standard MUI flags to this object (see the MUI Area doc), or
you can parse text in place with the use of control characters. So, for
example, using the command:-

gdisp$=Chr$(27)+"c"+your text

BEFORE you create the object will centre the text. Other supported control codes
are listed in the MUI_Text doc. (Chr$(27) is Esc), which allows preparsing.

You can later change the contents of the Text object, if you wish, with:-

gdisp$="Whatever you want - including formatting codes"
MUISet obj No,#MUIA_Text_Contents,&gdisp$

Hope this helps.

I'll assume you have managed to get a pointer to the first item in the list, 
because that's different depending on what gadget system you use (and I'm not 
sure how to do it for NCS :).

Then if you really want to get the 21st gadget, you could do this:

i.w=0
while i < 21 AND *gadgetp
  *gadgetp = *gadgetp\NextGadget
  i+1
wend
If i=21 Then NPrint "21st gadget found"

However, some gadgets (eg scrollers, sliders, listviews, MX) actually have up 
to 6 items in the gadget list. So if you want to find the 21st complete gadget 
you'd probably have to do something like:

i.w=0
gaid.w=-1
while i < 21 AND *gadgetp
  if gaid<>*gadgetp\GadgetID
    gaid=*gadgetp\GadgetID
    i+1
  endif
  *gadgetp = *gadgetp\NextGadget
wend
If i=21 Then NPrint "21st gadget found"

But then you have another problem (which I got stuck with in the BBGTLib) in 
that if you scan the gadget list for the gadgets, and then try to do e.g. 
GTSetGadgetAttrsA_() on them, you have to make sure you get the correct gadget 
for the tag you are trying to use on it. Sometimes it's the first gadget you 
find, sometimes it's the last. You are far better off just keeping a pointer 
to the gadgets when you create them in an array and then using that if 
possible.

Finally, the gadgets might not be in numberical order of GadgetID - if you 
want gadget with an ID of 21 you will need to scan for that specific value in 
the list. And a word of warning, the system gadgets have ID's of 0, so I tend 
to avoid that for my own gadgets.

Hi Mac,

[QBlit code]

>Where is the mistake?
>The Shape is always drawn with a solid black block around it.

There is no mistake in the code, as I get the same effect here. The mistake is 
in the way you think QBlit works. It draws the shape with the correct cookie 
mode (i.e. no block around it) but when you unqueue the shapes, they are 
removed and replaced with solid colour 0 blocks - this is what creates the 
effect of a black block around the shape.

You'd either need to manually replace the background after UnQueue, or use 
BBlits which do that automatically.

How do I do this:

somelist()\item.s=*string\Buffer

The compiler keeps complaining about not being able to convert types etc.
Buffer is supposed to contain the (a pointer to a (?))string which has been
typed into a string gadget. I need to put this value into a string variable.

If it's a list array you shoud NEVER use an array number...

If you put in an array number you don't want the \item... Is it a simple array
or a list your trying to put the info into?

If it's a list don't you want something like 'additem somelist()\item, string\buffer' ?

First thing I noticed is the somelist()\item.s ..aren`t you missing an array 
number , as in 'somelist(1)\item.s='
Second thing.. you`re putting an address into a string!
AFAIK it should be something like *somelist(1)\item.s=*string\Buffer

But without seeing the structures you use, it`s hard to pinpoint the exact 
problem if the above doesnt work.

Try: somelist()\item.s = peek.s(*string\Buffer).

If Buffer is actually a pointer to a string then that's probably why
you're getting the types error.

Hope this helps,

afaik All sprites have to be at the same depth, but can be of a different

You better use the displaysprite command, which has the added advantage of
using of super hires positioning. Maybe the infront commands work correctly
with that command. Otherwise try to find what registers decide the infront
stuff and change them yourself. There`s an aga guide on aminet which describes
all known aga registers and stuff and on my site you can find the rkrm and 3.1

Are you definately sure that InFrontx does not work with the displaylibrary? I 
had a quick look at the docs and from what I remember of the sprite/playfield 
priority hardware it should not matter that you use the displaylibrary (i.e. 
infrontx would just write to the custom chips for the sprite priority).

I've just had a look at the hardware RKRM and OK, it might not work, but make 
sure you have tried it in case it does :)

If you want to do it manually, you can:

Write/Poke a word to BPLCON2 (address $dff104)

Bits 15-7 should be all 0's
Bit 6 is the playfield 2 priority (when set to 1, pf1 shows in front of pf2 - 
if they have the same priority)
Bits 5-3 are the pf2 priority with respect to the sprites
Bits 2-0 are the pf1 priority with respect to the sprites

Values for playfield priorities against sprites (leftmost items show at the 
front, rightmost items are at the back):

000 pf   sp01 sp23 sp45 sp67
001 sp01 pf   sp23 sp45 sp67
010 sp01 sp23 pf   sp45 sp67
011 sp01 sp23 sp45 pf   sp67
100 sp01 sp23 sp45 sp67 pf

pf is playfield, spxy is sprites x and y

So for example, poking a value of %0000000001010000 would give you an order of

pf1 sp01 sp23 pf2 sp45 sp67

Poking %000000001000000 would give you

pf2 pf1 sp01 sp23 sp45 sp67

I don't think the displaylibrary would reset this each frame, but you never 
know. You could always set this up as a customstring at the start of your 
display to get around that problem if it exists.

Nope, it was, errr, a few different people, but never me. Names that spring

people were involved but I can't remember who they were (sorry people :).

Blitz programs written with the tcp.lib that I have used were all OK, 
except one problem where it could never work out it's own host address. And 
there should be no problem with "finding" a tcp-stack since all the library 
does is open bsdsocket.library and so it should work with that option 
enabled in WinUAE.

Perhaps the tcp.lib uses something that is broken under WinUAE, IIRC the 
latest few versions are all bugged.
