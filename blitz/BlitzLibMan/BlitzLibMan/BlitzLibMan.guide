  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}BlitzLib Manager@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back} (aka @{i}BlitzLibMan@{ui})

  This program is an excellent utility for @{fg shine}Blitz Basic@{fg text},
  written by @{i}Richard T Elmore @{ui}(of Elmore Libs "fame") in 1995.

  It allows you to perform various operations and generally
  manage the files in your Blitzlibs drawer.

  The reason I've uploaded it is that it's been hidden away on
  a little-known FTP site for years, and whenever it's mentioned
  on the @{"Blitz Basic mailing list" link "Mail" 0}, nobody actually knows where
  to get it from. Also, as far as I know, Richard Elmore no longer
  has anything to do with Blitz (or the Amiga, possibly).

  So here it is, along with this doc file, as there are no
  instructions in the archive on the FTP site.

  Originally downloaded from @{fg shine}ftp://x2ftp.oulu.fi/pub/amiga/prog/blitz/@{fg text}

  Worth a visit - check out the @{i}HelpApp @{ui}program (get the latest version
  as there are several there for some reason).

@node "Use" "Usage"

  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Usage@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  First of all, a few points to note :

  1) BlitzLibMan was written before Blitz Basic 2. The previous
     versions of Blitz used a drawer within Blitzlibs called
     "userlibs" to store 3rd party libraries, whereas Blitz 2
     is supposed to use a drawer called "otherlibs".

     What this means is that BlitzLibMan will only check in the
     Blitzlibs:userlibs drawer for 3rd party libraries, so
     you'll have to put all of your libraries into a drawer
     called userlibs if they're currently stored in
     Blitzlibs:otherlibs. Blitz 2 checks in both drawers, so it
     won't cause any problems.

  2) BlitzLibMan makes a backup of your Blitz2:deflibs file
     before creating the new deflibs, so if anything goes wrong,
     just delete the new deflibs and rename deflibs.BAK as deflibs,
     then you'll be back to your previous setup.

  3) Whenever you add a new library (either a file with a .obj ending
     in userlibs or a file called something like example.library1 in
     Blitzlibs:amigalibs), you may find that you get the dreaded
     @{"library number conflict" link "Conflict" 0}. All Blitz libraries are assigned a number
     from 1 to 255. As far as I know, only Blitz's own libraries can
     have numbers from 128 upwards.

     If two libraries share the same number, you'll get some odd results
     when trying to use commands from these libraries. BlitzLibMan lets
     you find the conflicting numbers, and change them. You'll find that
     different users have the libraries set up with different numbers
     as there's no standard setup for 3rd party libs.

  4) Don't give a library the number 1, as this tends to screw up other
     libraries for some reason (on my system anyway).

  5) You can install it anywhere - the program uses the Blitzlibs: assign
     to find the appropriate files.

  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Running BlitzLibMan@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  Just double-click on the icon, or type BlitzLibMan in the CLI.

  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Using BlitzLibMan@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  The cycle gadget at the top tells you which drawer you're looking
  at : Userlibs and Amigalibs are generally the only ones you'll
  use (I think the others are obsolete - at least in Blitz 2).

  The various operations are listed down the left of the window, and
  you click on one of these to perform that operation, then click on
  the library in the listview upon which you wish the operation to act.

  Also, check the menu at the top of the screen (right mouse button).

  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Examining libraries@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  Click on the "Examine Lib" button and then click once on one of
  the entries in the Userlibs list. The program reads the relevant
  information from the library. If you then click again, you'll see
  some more information in the text gadgets at the right of the
  window : the name of the library, its number, the number of commands
  in that library and the size of the library (this size is added to
  your executable file if you use even just one command from that
  library!).

  It'll also give you a requester which will list the commands available
  in that library, as well as giving you the option to print them out
  (note that I've never tried printing).

  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Changing conflicting library numbers@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  First of all, go to the menu at the top, and choose "Scan for
  Conflicting LibNums". This will search through all of the libraries
  and tell you if any two or more libraries are currently sharing the
  same library number. If they are, you'll be told which libraries
  have the same number, otherwise it'll say "No clashes found".

  If you do have conflicting libraries, go to the menu option "Suggest
  LibNum for a New Library". The program will then tell you the next
  free number available. You can click on Stop to go and change the
  number (by clicking on Change LibNum, followed by clicking on the
  library whose number you want to change), or you can click on Next
  to find the next available number. NEVER CHOOSE NUMBER 1, even if
  it's suggested as a free number! This causes weirds problems on my
  setup, even though no two libraries are sharing number 1!

  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Other functions@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  Although the above functions are the most used, you can perform
  some other operations :

  *DELETE      - Delete library - not recommended!

  *Rename      - Rename library - not recommended!

  (De)Activate - This keeps the library in the drawer, but doesn't
                 add it to Deflibs. This is a good way to remove a
                 library from your setup, without having to delete
                 it. Deactivated libraries go to the bottom of the list,
                 and are shown by a - sign in front of them. To reactivate,
                 you just click on them, with the (De)Activate button
                 pressed in.

  That's all there is to it really. :)

    jamesboyd@all-hail.freeserve.co.uk

  There's not really much point in contacting me though,
  as I didn't write the program and have told you all I know!

  Especially don't send me bug reports - send them back in time
  to Richard T Elmore...

  Thanks to Richard for a great program, and all the stuff he did
  for Blitz Basic!

  See ya :)

@node "Conflict" "Library Conflicts"

  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Library number conflicts@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  You'll know that you have a library number conflict if
  you find that commands either refuse to tokenise (ie
  change colour to show that Blitz recognises them), or
  you may find that when they do tokenise, they change to a
  totally different command!

  BlitzLibMan will sort it out - read further on the @{i}Usage @{ui}
  page.
