Yes, it certainly is, maybe I should have been more spesific 8).
I was going to write more about myself and my interests in Blitz 
to welcoming message, to start a conversation sort of, but I 
have math exam tomorrow, and that's why I don't have much time before it...
anyway, list works, and if you have anything to ask, go for it, maybe
somebody knows...

Dear blitzers...
after 3 days of start there are 19 of us in this list, so
this is starting to look very promising. 

This list is meant to any kind of conversation and questions concerning
Blitz Basic 2, the best programming tool in it's pricerange for any
computer. 

I myself am not a programming guru of any kind, I'm in fact a total
newcomer to blitz. I'll do my best, however, to answer any questions
sended to this list, although I'm sure there are already some excellent
programmers subscribed to this list...

list's address is: blitz-list@helsinki.fi
If you answer to letters sended to the list, and want all others see
the answer too, please remember to forward your answer to this address.

-Mikko Makela 

p.s. as you may have noticed (?), english wasn't my best subject in
school - I hope this doesn't disturb anybody 8)

Well, I received my copy of Blitz just couple of weeks ago from
Amiga Format, and it's v1.7, so I guess that's the newest version.
I'm going to write to Acid Software about the list this week, so
maybe (hopefully) we'll receive some news from them soon.

What comes to swapping programs and so on, I'll try to make aminet's
guys to make directory for blitz (dev/blitz/). Only I have the problem,
that I don't have any other material yet, what didn't come with blitz...
Infact, I don't even have BUMs in hole, because they were packed to
one disk, and almost all articles were missing (I presume).
Maybe somebody who has them, could upload them to aminet ?

While I'm on it, here are couple of questions also:
-Is there any kind of screen/window/gadget manager for blitz ?
 If not, this could be good project to share...
-Anybody have a procedure to play sample from spesific memorylocation ?
 I need it bad.

-Mikko

No need to worry about the English.  Blitz is not my best subject!  :)

Has anyone else received the latest BUM?  I haven't but have heard it has been
sent out in some areas.

Yes, v1.7 is the latest unless a new version has been released on the new BUM.

I do not think you can upload them to anywhere.  It may be best to write to
Simon in NZ to ask for permission.

>-Is there any kind of screen/window/gadget manager for blitz ?
Well, there is that one utility program that does not work with newer systems
as they have not recompiled the code since it was first released.

Hello fellow blitzers,

Does anybody know if acid house are planning support for new mod formats.
I badly need support for Protracker 3.15, but the latest version of
Octamed would also be adequate. Basically, a friend has invested a great
deal of time in creating some mods for my blitz game (which should be
released soon, small plug there 8^), but he used PT3.15 which uses timing
commands not available in standard sound/noisetracker or medv3 mod formats,
and hence it plays very badly in blitz (the speed of playback is all over
the place). 

He can redo them of course, but this will take a long time, and the results
will be far from satisfactory.

Are there any other possible solutions for getting these mods to work which
I may have missed. Could I use an asm routine to handle the playback, and
not use the blitz functions. If so, does anybody have example source for
this (you'll get a credit in my game, honest 8).

Thanks for your time.

Hello there,
	A few little questionettes for you intelligent people.

	1) Is BUM 6 out yet, and if so wheres my copy.

	2) Has any one noticed bugs in either getashape or Blit?
	   My shapes seem to get corrupted. In the game I am writing
	   I build shapes as I go, and they get corrupted even though
	   they are OK before they are blitted or getashaped. By corruption
	   I mean, some colours or lost, and colour 0 splatted in the middle
	   etc.

	
	Skidmarks is excellent. I am very impressed, nice one lads.

Hmm, OK, so we can all display Ham, and now Ham8. Is there any way of detecting

Hi everyone,

I reckon I have received about 30 pieces of mail re blitz list since yesterday
when I subscribed. My mail box is getting v cluttered. I was wondering if it
would be possible for the mail to be filtered a bit more effectively, I have
received some request to join the list amongst other things.

Perhaps you could change the format so that one large mail goes out to every
one at the end of the day containing all the days mail messages. Also perhaps
you could filter out joining requests so that othere dont receive them.

This is just a suggestion. Let me know what you think.

Andy.

Here's some source code for all you fellow blitzers.
It's a landscape program. First of all it produces a  plasma  type  view,
after a mousewait it continues to do a 3d scape.

I take no credit for this at all, csi077 at my address wrote this and has
allowed me to upload it. What a dude! Cheers Pete.

Anyway, do what you like with this file. 

Let's hope this starts off some source sharing... :)

1st thing:
I think that we would need some place to save all blitz pd's and sources
,which could be useful for all blitz-users, so here are some alternatives:
-aminet
-ftp.funet.fi
-some ftp:able place

Which one would you prefer ? I would think that they all are possibly
to arrange.

2nd thing:
When you advertize this list, please remember to give the request
address (blitz-list-request@helsinki.fi), so that subscribtions won't
be posted to everyone on the list.

3th thing:
I have an exam next friday+monday+thursday. AARGH!
(Had to let it out 8)

Hi,
Does any one know much about the Polyf command. I`ve used it to
do write a filled surface, rotating cube. I`ve just used Blitz,
i.e no machine language. The question i have about the polyf command
is, is it the fastest way to fill polygons. IF not how would you
go about writing your own (I do have a knowledge of assmebly.. a
few algorithms would be of help). Also, the last (optional)
parameter of the poly commands should be -1, to not draw faces
which are drawn anticlockwise (or is it clockwise), but would
say -2, or 10, as the last parameter mean ?

		Thanx   Jonny

Hi,

I probably know the answer to this already, but has any representive
of Acid House joined either Internet or better still this blitzlist
yet?

If not, what is the best way to get in touch with them, regarding
some serious bugs or failings in the blitz language.

Thanks.

Hi blitzers,

Can anybody help me with a few problems:

1. If I set up the copper to do palette switches using the ColSplit
   command, how do I get rid of them and go back to a single palette
   screen?

2. Is it possible to have more than 8 sprites on screen, using some
   sort of sprite multiplexing (not sure if thats the correct term 8^)
   If so, how, and what are the limitations.

3. If there any chance to Acid House writing some decent docs? 8)

Is it just me, or is this list very quiet. I was expecting lots of
discussions, gossip, jokes etc. Come on folks!!! 8)

Hi there,
        in response to Martin's question about copper rainbow effects
(Col Splits), I had this problem too. My own game required a 12 colour
b/g rainbow the colours of which changed with each level; each time I
reset the ColSplits the copper list got longer and the screen got
messier.

My solution:
I wrote a little programme which set the rainbow colours to $111,$222
etc. and then looked through the copper list (using CopLoc and CopLen)
for these values. No luck (??)

Now I've set the colour split using Custom Cop

dim cop_adr.l(11)

Aargh!! Cut short! Here goes again:

dim cop_adr.l(11) ;table of LONG WORD adresses for (12) rainbow lines

for i=1 to 15
  customcop mki$($180+2*col_index)+mki$($111*i),slice_top+i*16
next ;this sets up a grey rainbow

for i=0 to coplen step 4
 iadr=coploc+i
 for j=1 to 11
  if peek.w(iadr)=$180+2*Col_index AND peek.w(iadr+2)=$111*j 
  cop_adr(j)=iadr+2
 next
next; locate colours (currently grey scales) in coplist

Now poke new values into adresses stored in cop_adr array. Don't open
new slices after doing this, or otherwise change coplist. To remove
rainbow effect, just poke the same colour into all of the adresses.
Not perfect, but it works. I dont know how to totally remove the rainbow
code, but you could try storing the old copper list in an array; set up
rainbow; then poke old one back to coploc and following adresses? Sounds
dodgy to me, but it might work.

OK, so I'm doing a map editor for a rather funky game which is coming out soon.

So I get clobbered to do a map editor, I thought Blitz can do that!

I crank up my 1200, start Blitz, stick in some NEW gadgets like gtslider and then
it hits me. How the bloody hell do I know what value has been selected, ie, can
I pass a value back from gtslider and scroller in a similar manner to pro
proportional gadgets???


I thought I'd mail this STUPID question in the hope that I get 'flamed' for 
being a thicky as we need *some* kind of a discussion! :)

Dunno if they are connected or not. They are connected on AmigaNet though,
and have answered lots of questions when they aren't galavanting all over

Hi blitzers,

I have a small problem with a game I am developing. I want to be
able to show 4 15colour sprites onscreen at any time. These are
small sprites, less than 16x16.

Anyway, I know that 15 colour sprites must be displayed through
even-numbered channels,a nd they tie up the next odd numbered
channnel.

However, I cannot get a sprite to work through channel 7!!!
If I show a 15col sprite through channel6, it has corrupted
colour, and if I try to show a 3col sprite through channel 7
it comes back with an error 'channel in use'.

What this probably means is that something (has reserved channel
7, and not letting me access it. Maybe the workbench mouse?? I
don't know.

Does anybody know of this problem, and how to solve it. Thanks 8)

P.S. As an aside, can the blitz person who I promised AIBB modules
for my machine please contact me. I forgot to bring them in today
actually, but I just realised that I don't have your address, so
I couldn't send them to you anyway. Call me!!!!! 8)

No, I don't, but I think we would need one place with little storage,
IF people are going to share some source. That way I could upload them
to aminet when reasonable. I'll see what I can do. 

And I think that almost everyone has something to share, so come on
guys, mail them. I myself am writing a little screen manager, and
will post it, when there is something to post.

Hi There,
	Two (propably stupid) problems with GT gadgets in Blitz 2 (BUM5)

	1. How do I get values of sliders, integers etc?

	2. How do I change attributes of sliders, eg set a higher total,
	the SetAttrs does not work, do I have to use GT_SetAttrsA system
	call?

	I am writing a GOOD shape grabber, what features do you want? Which
	do you already like? Come on guys let's discuss. Would you like
	me to mail the current version so as that you can comment on it?

	Many Thanks

Some good ideas there Mike, unusual for you 8^). Anyway, I'd like to
second the idea for having the ability to define methods for cutting
out iffs automatically from iff's structured to suit this (although
the blitz shapegrabber can handle this, as long as you are willing
to sacrifice one colour).

Heres a few more ideas:

1. Ability to merge shapes files, extract/delete/move shapes.
2. Ability to load in existing shapes files, and add to them from
   other iff's.
3. Simple graphical operations. Not painting really, but the ability
   to move/flip shapes, and to cut off sides of the shape to reduce
   its size. 

A question here, not a request. Can you have shapes with different
depths in the same shapes file. I imagine so, I have just never tried
it to be honest. If you can:

4. Ability to handle multiple depth shapes handling, again with merge/
   extract, etc.

Theres loads of other things I can think of, but these will do for the
moment. I'll come up with more ideas once I've seen the program.

Oh yes:

5. Ability to both graphically/andor manually define hotspots for all
   shapes. Very important, they must not be just centered.

There you go Nigel. 8)

If it's not huge, you could mail it to the list. I think many of us
would like to see it (tell me if I'm wrong). I'm still finding out,
if there is a chance for me to make ftp:able place, where all Blitz-
related stuff could be uploaded (and maybe upload them in one piece
to aminet, when there would be reasonable amount to do that). 
I can't promise anything though.

OK OK!!

	First off things that are already in, or ready to go in,

	1. The ability to load shape files and merge them, then delete
	move around, grab new ones and put them anywhere in the bank.
	You can specify wether you want new shapes to go into a 
	certain place in the bank or at the end.

	2. You can copy and swap and delete shapes.

	3. You Can load an existing shape file then add to it from any
	number of other IFF and shape files.

	4. Multi depth no probs, BLitz does that ;)

	I had not thought about,

	1. Drawing operations

	2. Hot spot definition

	These will go in! Here is the uue file, the disk may have got a 
	little corrupt, so I will bring another copy up tomorrow incase it,
	STOP PRESS, it is corrupt, I will upload it tomorrow, it is only
	little. Meanwhile keep up the ideas. 

	And Martin, don't slander Michael, of course he doesn't have
	good ideas ;)

	Mike, git means Gifted Intelligent Type, honest...


	Sorry aboutthe delay, I hate PC's.

To: blitz-list@helsinki.fi
Status: RO

I think I know what you mean about tinting effects. I still use DPaint
II so I am not entirely sure. A n y w a y . . . .

One neat effect I thought of is to use dummy bitplanes, using the
command BitmapBitplanes. Say you have a 32 colour bitmap #0, you can
define, say Bitmap 1 to be the top bitplane (most significant bit) with

BitMap BitPlanes 1,0,%10000 
                 ^ ^      ^
           New BM  Source Mask setting which Bitplanes are active

This doesnt use more memory, merely sets BM 1 to refer to part of the
memory used by bm 0
I think thats right. Set colours 0-15 of the relevant slice to your
favoruite palette, and colour 16 to 31 to half the intensity of the
colour 16 less. Now Blit any one bitplane shape to bitmap 1 and you will
darken the area.

Now, all you rich bastards with AGA: Set up an 8 plane (256 colour
screen), and set three dummy bitmaps to provide red green and blue
light, and mix them. Could look great for lighting effects in an Alien
type atmosphere.

 EASY-PEASY! ;)

      Resident files hold your newtype and constant definitions (in case you
didnt know - have you read *ANY* of the manual?).  compile a file containing
these as normal, then select create resident.  enter your filename (*.res is
a good idea ;) ), and presto - one resident file.  To use it just bung its
name (including path) into the resident files box under compiler options in
the relevant files.  It means that view type stuff works *ALL* the time (not
just immediately after compilation), and the code you work on is smaller.

   Also another neat trick is to use blitz as a modular compiler.  The prog
im working on at the moment uses about 8 different files, each file containing
different parts of the prog.  Nice easy development + reduces compile time to
test singular bits.  Also makes my code ive done now easily transportable ;).
Very useful when youre making an adventure creator+interpreter -> file io is
all in one file so i only have to change it in the include file and both progs
are fixed for the new version.

        By the way - if anyones interested in adventure creators ill upload
the thing when its done - dont know how long - and any comments on what sort
of things i ought to have are very gratefully received.  Does anyone know how
i can call Multiview for my help file - currently i cheat and use some nasty
code that looks like this....

      .HELP
        SetErr
          f=Execute_("execute multiview SCREEN vw.guide",0,0)
          goto cheat
        End SetErr
        FindScreen 2,"MultiView"
        ScreenToFront_(2)
      .cheat
      Return

      Yeah - i know - its ugly but it works - does anyone know a cleaner way?
   (the findscreen bit produces an error if it cant find the screen making it
hit the error handler).

                Happy Blitzing,

You need to compile the file before you can create a resident file.

Right,
	Here it is. It took hours to work out how to read a Gadtools
integer. But I did find a way...


	integer.l=Val(GetGadInteger(gadlist,#id))

Sorry that should be GetGadString. The GetGadInteger returns a pointer
that I cannot seem to work out what it is pointing to!

There are some bugs still in this  but I really want to know what you think
generaly, use help to explain buttons!


Let me know huh!

Hello, just a couple of questions for all you intelligent people
out there. 8)

Firstly, I couldn't find any reference in the manuals about how a blitz
compiled game loads into memory. I know that all graphics/sounds etc
loads in chip, but does the main exe and other things like lookup tables
automatically load into fast, or does this have to be requested????

Secondly, in my game I load different map blocks for each level. The number
of blocks is always the same, so currently when I come to load them in I
just go
	LoadShapes #first,"..."

without bothering to delete the existing shapes. Is this an okay thing to
do, or should I free the old set first?

Does anybody have any news on the latest issue of bum (issue 6). Also, has
anybody in the uk who ordered skidmarks with their subscription received it
yet. I've been waiting for a couple of months now, but no package. I've
also tried ringing the main office for the last two weeks, but all I get
is either a answer phone or an endlessly ringing line. 8(

You can examine screen's viewmode from viewport-structure, 32 bytes 
from start of the structure:

viewmode=peek.w(viewport(scr_number)+32)

Here is explanation of modes (from book "Mapping the Amiga", I don't
have RKMs yet):

name (C)            bit  hex
genlock_video        1    2
lace                 2    4
pfba (?)             6    40
extra_halfbrite      7    80
genlock_audio        8    100
dualpf               10   400
ham                  11   800
vp_hide (?)          13   2000
sprites              14   4000
hires                15   8000

...these were listed in the book. As you can see, there is no mention
about for example superhires, but you can find out missing modes by
changing wbscreen to desired mode and peeking address given above.

Yeah, but don't do it too often or his head will probably explode 8)

Theres probably hundreds of blitz users out there (how many people are
on this list anyway) who are thinking, 'what the bloody hell are these
people talking about, wasting time and flooding my mailbox' 8) And its
all your fault Mike, you started this.

hi all,

    Ive finally got the asl file requester to work without crashing (no thanks
to the aslfilerequest command!), using the library call AllocASLRequest_
and RequestFile_.  Trubble is - it only wants to open up the file requester on
the workbench screen, not the currently used one!  Can anyone help me out here?

    Im actually at uni so im going home in a weeks time - if BUM6 is going to
arrive in the next couple of weeks then its bound to be just after i leave and
im pissed off by it.  (im at home for 5 weeks - doing nothing at all ;)  ).

    Do you know if were ever likely to see the blitz compiler as command line
type thang so i can use my fave editor rather than ted (assuming ted isnt going
 to become magically transformed in BUM6).  I wish i could fold my statements
like in the AMOS editor (about the only thing i miss about amos ;) ).

    And i want multiple documents open on just one ted screen - having three
screens open at once isnt exactly user friendly! (or memory for that matter!)

    Oh well - thats enough wishes for one mail,

                                    SgtBilko signing off....

	I have the latest version of Shapez with Auto-Grabbing, configuration, graphical handle setting
and loads of extra stuff. Even though it is small please mail ME if you want a copy.

	All joking aside it does have a whole host of new features, if you all want a version I guess I can put it 
here.

	Missing you already (well apart from Mike;)

Hello blitzers,

I have some serious problems with blitz (well I think its a problem
with blitz rather than with my program, but moe on that in a sec).

Heres the situation. I am developing a game in blitz, and apart from
a few bugs, its pretty stable at the moment, but it is getting pretty
large (the exe is 175k with no debug-info). 

Now, if I compile the program *without* debug-info, then the game
runs perfectly okay, in fact yesterday I played it on about a dozen
occasions with no problems whatsoever.

Now, if I compile the program with debug-info enabled, things get
somewhat hairy. The program crashes over and over again at seemingly
randome points, in fact it doesn't run for more than a couple of
minutes without crashing. And when I say crash, I mean a total system
failure (either a machine lockup or a software guru box). Thats with
no message from the debugger at all. Also, to make matters worse, if
I put STOP commands around the code, 9 times out of 10, the game will
again crash majorly, and the debugger just plain refuses to stop at
the required line.

All this has been happening over the last few days. I have tried
reinstalling blitz, but to no avail.

I wa wondering if maybe the debugger is straining under the presssure
of such a large amount of code and symbols?? I'm not sure, but if the
debugger cannot handle this much information, then I'm in trouble.
And as I mentioned above, my game works fine with no debug-information.

Does anybody have any ideas on this. Is it possible to break down
a program into separate modules, and turn off debug-info for certain
modules to see if this eases the strain.

Any help will be greatly appreciated, I need the debugger since I am
making last minute alterations to the code and I need to look at
variables.

Thanks

Hello again,

I just managed to get through to AcidHouse UK, and bad news. They
think it will be as much as two (!!) months before bum6 is released.
Major bummer. At leat he confirmed that they they know about the
major bugs (especially on accelerated machines) in the sfx, keyboard,
and debugger (see previous letter) department, and these are being
addressed.

First bad news: I can't start an anonymous ftp-place just for the list,
as I tried. So we have to use second alternative: aminet

But since "threshold" to upload something to aminet is quite high, I
thought that it could be better, if I would collect all the stuff, and
upload it to aminet in one archive. I'll include all programs already
sended to the list (if you don't want that, please let me know).

So if you have something to share, send it to me ! (and this is an order 8^) )

Easiest way of doing this would be just by replying to this letter, and
including your program in uuencoded form.
(For Unix, command for uuencoding is "uuencode", and if you use emacs as
a mail-editor, you can include a file with "Ctrl+x Ctrl+i")

BTW, where do you think I should upload them: in dev/misc/ or in
dev/basic ?

Looking thru the manual, I did not find any info on sending output to your printer.
Can anyone suggest a method.
Also if your program is in a loop, is there a way to break and stop the program?

 Have you tried CTRL-ALT-C ? Invoke the debugger then hit escape to
halt program execution - if you have gadgets and stuff then you may need to
cause an idcmp event type thing.

    By the way - can we just determine what the differences are between
versions of blitz in the uk and usa?  Here in the uk from Amiga Format i got
User Manual, Reference guide, 4 archived disks.  BUM1-4 were in the User guide
and BUM5 disk was archived on one of the others.  The archives contained main
blitz disk, BUM5 disk, Blitzlibs, examples, pd disks 1-4.  I have received no
addendum and no BUM6 8^{.  There are references in the user guide to an
advanced developers pack or something.  There is only a couple of references,
and nothing about how to get it/ how much it costs/ what it actually is!

    If anyones interested ill have my adventure creator type thang ready
around 6th May ish (im off for 5 weeks easter hols now ;).  If you want it
email me personally.


         Seeyall in 5 weeks...... SgtBilko

Mikko Makela suggested that I look in Bum5 disks for examples.
The only problem is that I did not receive any disks in my Blitz Package.
Only the Bum 1-5 magazines.
Is there a way to get these disks?

If you order your package from the states, you will receive the User Guide,
Reference Manual and 5 Disks (Program, Libaries, Examples and two Pd Disks).
Also Bum 1-5 Magazines.

That should do something like a vwait, but exiting earlier than if you

Hi All,

  I have finally gotten around to doing some serious converting from GFA
over to blitz2. Listed below are commands which I've had to write custom
functions for. Having written them, I suppose there's not much need for
them
to be included in Blitz, but it sure would be nice.

  Perhaps these could be included in Blitz2 or added like the commands in
Elmorelib.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ERASE z1()[,z2()...]

Function: Erase the given array.


INSERT x(i)=y
DELETE x(i)

Function: To insert or delete elements from an array (Not a list array).
          INSERT will insert the value, dropping the last element in the
          array and moving all later values down 1 element.


ARRAYFILL x(),y

Function: Fill all elements of the given array with the value of y.


STR$(x,y)

Function: Pads the returned string with leading spaces to make the string
          y characters in length.


MOD(x,y)
DIV(x,y)

Function: Return value from numeric function x MOD y or x DIV y


DEC x
INC x

Function: Increase or decrease the given variable by 1 unit.


ODD x
EVEN x

Function: Return True/False if given variable is odd or even.


MID$(a$,x[,y]) as command

Function: Allows the insertion of a string into another string.


TRIM$(a$)

Function: Removes white-space from both ends of given string.


ELSE IF

Function: Allows for more than 3 undefined options in an IF-ENDIF block.


EXIT IF con

Function: Exits looping routine of con is true.


ERR
ERR$(x)

Function: ERR returns the error number of an offending error. ERR$(x)
returns

Hi all

How can I initialize an array with some determinated values?
I do it using DATA and READ, but i'd like to know if it is possible
to do it directly like in C (myarray=[1,2,...])

Also, I am trying to use the function Poly, giving an array of words 
to it containing the X and Y coords of the polygon, but I get something
strange on my screen. I've tried doing it with Line and works fine.
If anybody knows where is the problem, please, tell me.

Hi guys

Have a look at the example of CustomCop in the manual - I reckon there
are some pretty cool special FX could be reproduced with the code there.
For exampe, if anyone else out there plays Stardust and admired the
ripply water effect on the special mission levels, I reckon you could
use Copper pokes to the adresses given in the example to acheive such an
effect, using a minimal amount of memory and power. 
Investigations have only begun, Ive got to try this out for dual
playfields now. Ill post results later, when I know what Im doing.

Over and Out    Mike

Hmmm. Code sure was small. Executable sure as hell wasn't. There's gotta be
something wrong somewhere when 2K of code compiles to 40K+ of executable.
Unless I'm doing something wrong, this seems to be an awful bad exe/code
ratio.

Read this file carefully, then eat your terminal. We don't want this to
get into the hands of the Commies....

The adresses $108 and $10A indicate the memory shift to be performed at
the start of each scan line, for even and odd bitplanes respectively.
Their values should match for normal screens, and represent fg & bg in a
dual playfield. The default value is related to the width of the bitmap
being displayed as follows:

BPLMOD=(BITMAP WIDTH - WINDOW WIDTH)/8 - 2
^                       ^            ^   ^
Value    Width par. in Slice     A Byte  God knows?

The effect of this is to jump the excess width of the bitmap if you are
hardware scrolling, and start each line 1 pixel down from the previous
one.

Now calculate BMLINE=bitmap Width/8 (size of a line in bytes)

Now, if you want to miss every second line on the bitmap, add BMLINE to
the value of BPLMOD. The screen will appear squashed by a factor of 2 in
the vertical. Subtract BMLINE from BPLMOD and you jump back a line, thus
making each line displayed the same as the previous one. Subtract
2*BMLINE and the screen is displayed upside down, and so on.

Value            Description

BPLMOD+0*BMLINE  Normal
BPLMOD+1*BMLINE  Half height
BPLMOD+2*BMLINE  Third Height
BPLMOD-1*BMLINE  Vertical stripes (each line shows same memory)
BPLMOD-2*BMLINE  Upside down
BPLMOD-3*BMLINE  Upside down & Half Height etc.

The trick is to use the copper to write to these adresses at certain
beam positions, to create warped/flipped areas of the screen.

Alright, the ripply effect:

Set up a dual playfield (320x256), and we'll ripple the background

for i=1 to15
 bplmod=-2
 if i&1=1 then bplmod=-82
 CustomCop Mki$($10A)+Mki$(bplmod),slice_top+i*16
next

What have I done?
The first 16 scan lines are normal.   
The next sixteen count backwards, so we see the same part of the bitmap
upside down.
The next sixteen are normal again, and so look identical to the first
sixteen.
And so on.
Note that the first sixteen lines of the background bitmap are repeated
over and over again, we cannot see the bottom of it on screen. You can
get away with displaying a bitmap only 16 pixels high, and still fill
the screen.

Set aside a bitmap 320x32 and draw some nice wibbly patterns on it. Now
move it up and down

Repeat
 For i=0 to 15
  Vwait : ShowB 1,0,i
 Next
 For i=14 to 1 step -1
  Vwait : ShowB 1,0,i
 Next
Until JoyB(0)<>0

Wibbly wobbly woo woo!

DISCLAIMER: I havent actually tried the above myself yet, I just think
it should work. I'll have a go over the weekend and post any corrections
required.

How do I send the Blitz2 graphics to a Public Screen of my naming?
I am trying to use MainAuthor to stream a Ham8 animation, and want to have
my Blitz2 program use that Ham8 Public Screen for its own graphics and
interactivity when the anim is not streaming.

I've used WbToScreen to send Blitz2 to the workbench, but while that gives
me 256 colors, it won't give me Ham8.  And I haven't gotten FindScreen to
work with a Ham8 screen, it opens its own window but not on the named
screen.

Alternatively, anyone able to load an anim larger than CHIP ram (i.e.
almost any AGA anim), either into FAST ram for playback or streaming from
disk?  Blitz2 seems to be loading the anims into CHIP RAM, which doesn't get
me very far.  Or maybe I've got a setting off?

Anyway, thanks for any help on this.

       This message has been sent to you for good luck. The original
       is in New England.  It has been sent around the world nine times.
       The luck has now been sent to you. You will receive good luck within
       four days of receiving this message - provided you, in turn, send it
       on. This is no joke. You will receive good luck in the mail. But no
       money. Send copies to people you think need good luck. Don't send 
       money as fate has no price. Do not keep this message. This message
       must leave your hands within 96 hours.

       A United States Air Force Officer received $470,000.  Another man 
       received $40,000 and lost it because he broke the chain.  Whereas 
       in the Philippines, Gene Welch lost his wife 51 days after receiving 
       the message. He failed to circulate the message. However, before 
       his death, he received $7,555,000.

       Please send 20 copies and see what happens in four days.  The chain 
       comes from Venezuela and was written by Saul De Groda, A missionary 
       from South America. Since the copy must tour the world, you must 
       make twenty copies and send them to friends and associates - After 
       a few days you will get a surprise - this is true, even if you are 
       not superstitious.

       Do note the following: Constantine Diaz received this chain in 1958.
       He asked his secretary to make 20 copies and send them out. A few
       days later he won a lottery of two million dollars. Carlos Daditt,
       an office employee, received the message and forgot that it had to 
       leave his hands within 96 hours. He lost his job.  Later, after 
       finding the message again, He mailed 20 copies. A few days later he 
       got a better job.  Dalan Fairchild received the message and, not 
       believing, threw the message away. Nine days later he died.  In 1987 
       the message, received by a young woman in California, was very faded 
       and barely readable. She promised herself that she would retype it
       and send it on, but she set it aside to do it later. She was plagued 
       with various problems, including expensive car repairs. The letter 
       did not leave her hands within 96 hours. She finally typed the letter 
       as promised and got a new car.

       Good Luck but please remember: 20 copies of this message must leave
       your hands.

     All the best.

Bye,

First of all, thanks to the guy who posted some stuff on the changelist. I used
his idea and now I'm using all the new gt stuff, sure is great!

But, I'm stuck elsewhere now!
Regarding 256 colour screens, I now know that I should be using initcop,
createdisplay, etc but it just makes my screen go funny. Well, weird would be
more acurate as I don't find myself laughing when it happens.
Basically, I can create a 256 colour screen in AMIGA or BLITZ mode but when
it comes to changing the palette or displaying a picture it's 'bomb-out city!'

Any help/source would be greatly appreciated.

Getting back to the new gt stuff..
How can I change the level of a slider gadget, I need to tie three together.
How can I enable a gtgadget? Enable doesn't find the new gadgets..

I think that's all for now..


Andy :)

PS. How come my best special effects are produced by system crashes?!

Hello,

Can anybody tell me what is the best way of checking for the
existance of a file before attempting to load? I am fed up
of having blitz programs crash the system when a file is
requested for loading which isn't there!?!?

Any news on BUM6 also 8) (optimistic or what!)

Hmm.
OK, so I can open a window on a public screen from Blitz2, ok so far.
But I can't get the palette correct.  
Is there a way to make an intuition call to set the pallette for a shanghai
Ham8 window?  I have a *special* pallette that I use for all my Ham8 stuff,
but I can't seem to invoke it for shanghai'd windows.

Any help appreciated--thanks.

	HI,
		Can anyone out there help me to produce 8 way scrolling
	using blitz?
	Horizontal scrolling is no problem (just adjust bitplane pointers
	by a word for every 16pixels scrolled) but I've seen this combined
	with vertical scrolling using the copper wrap method.
	
	any hints\source on the copper wrap method would be great!

	On another note is BUM6 out I've being waiting 3months now
	so whats the story?

The easiest way is to use the Exists() command!

Having said that, it depends on exactly what you want to do with the file
once you have found it!

Hello,

Can anybody advise me on the best (easiest/quickest/safest) was of
moving graphics/mods etc from chip into fast mem. Basically, I want
to program my game so it takes advantage of any fast mem in the
system, storing unused items in fast to reduce loading.

Do I have to go through the system to allocate/copy mem, and if so,
could anybody help me with a few examples.

Thanks.

Hello everybody!

I'm a 27 year old blitz user from Stockholm, Sweden, who is new to this list. I was very happy to see that there actually existed such a list since I haven't had anyone to discuss topics related to blitz-programming. I like beer, karate(2nd Dan) and women(I'm married). Of course I also like programming. My current job is as a research engineer at the Swedish Graphich Arts Research Institute.

1989 I bought an Amiga 2000 HD which I had decided to learn how to program on. I started out with Amiga Basic(yuk!) and assembler(puh) and played around with them for a couple of years. Then Amos came and I was stuck on it since the very first day I bought it. I never thought that anything could even compete with it until I read about Amiga Formats BlitzBasic Compo last autumn. I decided to buy it and decided I liked it. I and a friend of me even completed a game which we sent as an entry to the competition(I have not yet heard the results though). I'm really stuck with BB2 now and I hope that I may found people here that think like me.

Now to some new-to-the-list questions.
- How long has this list been around?
- How many subscribers are there?
- Is there any connection to Acid Software( i.e do they read this list)?
- Is it possible to receive a list of all subscribers?

Best Regards
Peter Sandberg

The only new commands are supplied by blitz users. To that end the elmore
library has been include in blitz basic. Many printer commands have been added
as well as MemAlloc and MemFree (I cannot remember the exact name (I haven't 
got may Amiga with me.) Also there is memory monitoring routines to determine
the amounts of various memory that is free (Fast, chip). Also compression and 
decompression commands for power packer and imploder have been included.

As far as I can tell 2 commands have been revamped
ScreenPens which now has 7 argumants.
SortList now supports by any field (I would have prefered to pass a function 
	pointer for the comparison function).

Some examples have been included but you need to judge for yourself if they are
better.

Intuitools has been revamped and only works for 2.0+ (rats I only have 1.3).

That's all for now. I need to unarchieve various *.lha file to discover more but
as of yet my Lharc cannot uncompress it. Does anyone know where I can get the 
latest version? (Or if Lharc is the wrong archieve which one should I be looking
for?)

Mark.

Sorry, I do not have distribution rights. I would like to help out but my

PS. you shouldn't have to wait too long (perhaps another week or two.)

Hi all!

I can't find the way to make parameter passing by reference to return 
some value (I don't want to use SHARED). I think it should be like in
C (i.e. foo{&parameter}) but I don't know how to refer to the value
pointed by a pointer. I also had that problem when tried to access to
values defined with Dc like this:

*ptr.b=&text
; What can I do to read the value pointed by the pointer?
text
Dc.b "text",0

Any help would be apreciated.

Use LhA. Can be found on Aminet.

There are some things you should note:

- library numbers #supportlib and #seriallib clash (both 90)
so if you want to use the above AllocMem and FreeMem you must change
#supportlib to something else (eg. 99) and recompile libmacs and then
AmigaSupportLib.

- Also HARDWARE.ElmoreLib.obj is missing. You need to recompile it from source 
code (can be found in one of the directories).
 
Can some kind soul send me the last 10 tracks from the second BUM6? Mine are
corrupt, :(

Hello,

Can anybody tell me what countries have been blessed with the
release of BUM6 so far!?! Also, when can us downtroden blitz
users in the UK expect to get it (BUM5 was 2-3 months late if
memory serves me correct).

As anybody in the UK rang head-office. If not, I'll do that
tomorrow.

Thanks for your time...

G'day all,
  I just got my copy of Blitz Basic 2 last week from Amiga Format (great deal!)
but don't seem to have got the intuition planner.  There is a pic of it on th e
back of the box, and it is also mentioned several times in the User Guide.

  Has anyone got any idea where I can get this program??

  Also, what is the format of the MapEditor files??  There is no documentation
on it at all, so how are we supposed to include its maps in our games??

Thanks in advance,
Dave

	Well I had to chace Acid UK a bit to get Skidmarks, they had cashed
my cheque but lost my order!!!!!!!
	Anyhow after highlighting the problem they sorted it all out
and in three days I had Skidmarks!
	Yeah the palette is the same. The shapes get corrupted, like
bytes are begin missed etc. I just cannot work out wether it is in the
blitting or the getting, even the shape grabber gets this sometimes!
	Sometimes no corruption, sometimes there is, it is never in the same
place or pattern!

	I shall give the nice chap at Acid Uk a bell. Let me know how you
get on!

G'day all,
  Just another (!!) query about the stuff that comes with BB2.  On
the back of the box, it has a pic for Insectoids, which looks different
to the version on disk.  Is this another version or what??

Just curious,
Dave

G'day all,
  It mentions somewhere in the manuals that Sibly and co are going to be
writing a CD32 specific library.  As there any news on this yet??
  I have a CD32 (but not a 1200, am waiting for the CD32 expander), but
would like to use the controller of the 32 (joypad), and all of its buttons
(rather than just direction and 2 fire buttons).

Thanks for any info,
dave

G'day all,
  As you may know from a previous post, I am interested in writing a wibble
effect for the copper in Blitz.  A problem that has occurred for me however,
is that when I do the following:

For i=0 To 15
  co$=Mki$(#BPLCON1)+Mki$(i)
  CustomCop co$,i+100
  VWait
  Show 0
Next i

instead of scrolling all bitplanes over by the relevent degree, it will only
move a bitplane or 2 (I'm not sure how many are moving).  Why don't all the 
bitplanes move??  Am I forgetting to do something prior to this (maybe set
BPLMOD or something??)

ANy help would be appreciated.

Dave

Dear all,

Anyone know how to get scroll bars in the bit of blue around the edges on 
an intuition window using either Gadtools or the standard gadgets?  

Thanks

G'day all,
  I've come across a snag in my wibble program, and I just can't seen
to work out why it buggers up.

  What I want it to do, is to get a specific line (say line 100 on the
display), and move it to the right by say 15 pixels, then move it back to the
left by 15 pixels.

  However, it doesn't seem to be that easy.  It seems to move the line
a bit to the right, then it starts to stuff the display, by moving lines
below this line (100).

  If anyone has any ideas, I'd be happy to upload the source to them (only
currently about 20-30 lines).

Any help appreciated.

Dave

Here is what Simon says about samples messed up on accelerated machines:

Samples do tend to stuff up, also on 040 machines, I am not sure what to do
about this, has anyone got good code that handles the double interupt bug in
audio hardware a nice clean way?

Also, the following is beta Shape Maker source code.  Intuitools 2 should
be on here soon:

I've got a question concerning the WORD (.w) and QUICK (.q) primitives.
In the User Guide, it says quicks are 2 bytes long and have an accuracy of
1/65536. Isn't 2 bytes a bit small to hold +/- 32768 and 1/65536 data?
(shouldn't it be 4 bytes?)

Also it says quicks are fast, but relative to what? Just floats or words
and long words as well? Is it better off for me to use words instead of
quicks when I don't need fractional accuracy or just leave the default to
quicks for speed?

Thanks..

I was wondering if anyone has a list of what files they have installed with
Blitz?  I mean, there isn't really an Install program/method, so did everyone
just drag the drawers over to their HD?  I put the Libraries drawers in one
directory and the Main disk (Blitz2:) in another.  Did everyone do the same?
Do you ever get an OUT OF MEMORY error when you do RELOAD LIBS?  Anyone been
able to get LibManager to work or LibTool or whatever it is called?

Anyone have a complete list of Libs and what number they are?

I was just wondering the same thing.  I DO get an out of memory when I 
try reload libs and haven't a clue about the libtools.  I think Blitz is 
crying out for an update, there are SO many bugs that are just SO irritating.

I want a shape grabber that lets me either cut the shapes manually or can do
it automatically using settings that I set.  Such as, 2 pixel blank border
around each shape which separates them, 16x16 or 16x32 or 32x32 or 32x16, etc.
And then I'd like to be able to flip them around within the file so that
a certain type of shape (like walls) are all together, etc.

Most definitely!  Perhaps some certain codes should be constants.  For instance,
if you set the hot spot to $000 that means in the middle.  $110 means upper
left corner, etc.  Let the program figure out exactly where those spots are
in terms of the shape.

In BB2, there are only 3 needed files, right?  Deflibs, Blitz, and Ted, right?
All the others are NOT needed.  Let me know if I am wrong because I am going to
delete a bunch of stuff I have yet to touch in those directories.  They are on
floppy, but I'd rather not have to drag them out.  You know how us gits are.

G'day all,
  I was wondering if it was possible to use a shape to be used in
tinting another object behind it, similar to the effect found in 
DPaint III.

  For instance, I would have a square shape with a pattern on it,
which I would want to tint the upper half of it (reduce the brightness
of the colour) using another shape to do so (If shapes were used
various patterns can be used as a stencil in the tint).

  Its hard to explain, but hopefully someone will understand what
I'm asking.

Thanks in advance,
Dave

PS.  If you aren't sure what i mean, but think you know of a solution,
I can post a small pic showing what I want.

I also have 6MB.  4MB FAST, 2MB CHIP.  Still get it, though.

Also, anyone know how to make resident files?  I select the CREATE RESIDENT
option, but it does NOTHING!!!

On BUM 5 in the Devmaterial.lzh archive there is a gtlib source and a
bbgtlib.lib library.  Does anyone know if they are the same thing?  Also,
in the gtlib source it asks for the resident file 'blitzoffs'.  Is that on the
disks somewhere?

Nope. We're getting more tight with creating new directories, so there
must be a more general scope for any new dirs. Thus I *could* be talked
into dev/basic/, maybe adding dev/amos to it later. Will that do?

	Does anyone out there know what viewmode option does and what
values does it take? Blitz manual (which is horrible) only mentions that
long version of screen command provides more control but it does't explain
what each option does. I was able to find most of the required info
scattered across the manual but nothing about viewmode.
	Also, does anyone know how to kill mouse pointer in amiga mode
without changing its sprite to blank?

Oh, yes, it will.  THe directory on Aminet will just be a place to put files

If someone wants the latest, email me and I will email it to you.  it has
smaller code, so it is faster.

Also, a new Intuitools is supposed to be on BUM 6, whenever it comes out,
that is!

They are NOT PD.  Unless the file on the disk says it is PD, it is not.  The
files I have uploaded are not on BUM disks, but have been placed in PD by the

Anyone receive the BB2 addendum?  It had a few things:

Talks about the 'display' lib as being beta and how to code a display using
the display lib.

Do not use the Gadtools Palette gadget under WB2.xx.  It is being fixed for
WB2.xx, but works fine under WB 3.xx.

ASLScreenRequest is a WB3.xx only function

A new Intuitools is being made and will take advantage of Gadtools.

Some users of the 1230XA 50/50/4 seem to be having problems while others
are not. :)

And a little sort demo that shows how to sort lists.

Ummm, I don't think you CAN view the .res files.  Just look at the .bb2 file
that made the .res file.  The Libmacs were on BUM 5 and I downloaded a new
Libnum file.  I don't have Blitzoffs, though.

I just got hold of BUM1 and in it I found a very interesting article on
rounding that might be of interest to some of you.

[Quote from BUM1]

BUGGY BOOBOOS
-------------

Being the first issue of Blitz User it would be silly if we were already
reporting bugs in this section. However there has been a few problems with
evaluation inside square brackets...

SQUARING UP..

If an evaluation such as:

  jim\son[5-bob\numkids]="BILLY"

gives spurious results try:

  num=5-bob\numkids
  jim\son[num]="BILLY"

We are currently doing more tests on such evaluations.

ROUNDING OFF..

A few mathematical issues will now be addressed here. This discussion is
based around the complex issue of rounding numbers not about some 'bug' in
the Blitz2 quick maths library or the Amiga's Fast Floating Point library
(which we use for all floating point calculations).

The only reason this discussion is in the Buggy Booboos section is because
this section needs fleshing out a bit...

Anyway try the following...

  DEFTYPE .f
  While Joyb(0)=0
    NPrint a
    a=a+.1
  Wend

So where do all the wierd numbers come from? Try it in another BASIC. Now
try changing the deftype back to quick (that's .q). Same problem again.

This is because computers are not decimal (base 10) but binary (base 2)
and have big trouble accurately defining a number such as .1, this is of
course the same as 1/10.

To see the binary equivalent of .1 try the following:

  a.q=.1
  NPrint Bin$(Peek.l(&a))
  MouseWait

This prints in binary the contents of the memory location where the
variable a is kept. As you can see .1 is a very complex number in base 2.

What's more when using quicks (fixed point maths) multiply increases the
rounding error dramatically:

  a.q=.1
  Print 500*a
  MouseWait

You can now see why rounding errors are such big deal in computer science.

The above example remains accurate with floating point because of the
nature of floating point (amount of error is absorbed by the change in
exponent) but rounding still increases with sufficient initial error.

Confused?

Let's just say that if you want to do an accounting type package in Blitz2
don't use fixed point (quick) types.

Fast floating point is also probably not a good idea as when you hit the
$260,000 anything less than a dollar will disappear.

So what should you do?

Wait for a Double Precision maths library to be released? Don't be silly,
just use long integers and treat a dollar as 100 cents. Ha, not only do
you get to account for numbers up to 20 million but you don't loose a cent
of accurary either.

Don't forget to physically insert the decimal point two digits from the
right when you print figures.

Also divide by whole numbers rather than multiplying by decimal points
whenever possible.

As if somebody is going to write huge financial programs in Blitz2
anyway...

[End of quote]

Phew! Hope that answers some of your questions.

Keep blitzing...

In your Blitzlibs: dir, create a directory called USERLIBS and place any
non-ACID libraries in here.  Then, run the MAKEDEFLIBS program.  It works for
me so let me know if you have problems.

        I needed to do this recently and the only way I found was to use
        a combination of pointers and newtypes...

            NEWTYPE .kludge
                myarray.b[100]
            END NEWTYPE

            :

            DEFTYPE .kludge *ptr

            :

            *ptr=&myarray_data

            :

            myarray_data
            Dc.b 1,2,3,4....99,100

        You can then access the data using   *ptr\myarray[n]

        (The code is from memory if it doesn't work, let me know and
        I'll find the exact method I used.)

Here's a small program to for all to browse, implementing a very slow
version of realtime texture mapping. I don't think it'll be of use to
anyone, but hey, what the heck. Btw: post me any speed improvements.

Thanks.

Hmmmm...If there are any .info or .bb2 files in the SYSTEM, AMIGALIBS, BASIC,
or USERLIBS directories, delete them.

I don't think there is.  LibManager is supposed to do that, but it isn't stable
on AGA machines.  I will list my BlitzLibs: dir and post it.

>Thanks for your help,
No problem.

Well, I never was a fashion statement.  Besides, it's those Brits like Martin
and Kift that are slaggers!!!  ;)

G'day all,
  I was just wondering about the subscription to the Blitz User
Mags, and whether you had to pay.  All I got in my Blitz box was a
rego card which I have sent off.  There were no other details about
BUM etc.

  I think I heard a while ago that the first User Mag was free and
then you paid an annual fee after that.  Any info concerning the
User Mags would be greatly appreciated.

In the USA, it is $20 for a year sub.  You should get BUMs 1 - 5 in new
BlitzBASIC 2 packages.  At least, people here (USA VA) have.

G'day all,
  I decided to write something today in BLitz as I was feeling
board, and ended up writing a progress indicator program.

  It is written as a couple of statements, so should easily be
implemented into any program.  If anyone is interested, I could
post it to the list, as it is only 3-4k uuencoded, else I could
mail it to you direct.

posting it to the list (I hope noone minds 8-)).

The easiest way to do this within Blitz is probably to use the ReadFile() 
function.  It will return a zero (false) if it fails, and since it 
implies input only, will fail if the file doesn't exist.  Don't have the 
manual around, but I'm pretty sure the argument template is 
ReadFile(file,filename).  Here is an example:

If ReadFile(0,"does_it_exist.file")
   {file exists}
   Free File 0
else
   {file does not exist}
Endif   

If you only want to see if it exists, you can close the file immediately; 
if you want to read it in if it exists, read it in (FileInput 0, etc.) 
and then close it.

You can also use dos.library, but this method requires less work (and 
less knowledge of how the system works) on your part.

Hope this solves your problems.

You can use dos routine open to check if file exists. If I remember
correctly, it returns 0 if unsuccessful, otherwise its a file handle. For
more info on the routine refer to hardwre manuals.
