                          Blitz Mailing List Guide
                          ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

Hi amorel

Here's a function I use (I hope it's the working version :) to press a 
gadget and release it for a short time (to make it look like it's been 
clicked on) without actually pressing it.

; Turns gadget on then off
Statement HighlightGad{windownum.w, gtlistnum.w, gadgetid.w}
    DEFTYPE.w       gadpos
    DEFTYPE.Gadget  *g
    DEFTYPE.Window  *w

    *g = GTGadPtr(gtlistnum, gadgetid)
    *w = Peek.l(Addr Window(windownum))

    ; Toggle the gadget on and redraw it
    gadpos = RemoveGadget_(*w,*g)
    *g\Flags = *g\Flags | #GFLG_SELECTED
    AddGadget_ *w,*g,gadpos
    RefreshGList_ *g,*w,0,1

    Delay_ #GADHITIME   ; Wait for a wee while

    ; Toggle the gadget off and redraw it
    gadpos = RemoveGadget_(*w,*g)
    *g\Flags = *g\Flags & NOT(#GFLG_SELECTED)
    AddGadget_ *w,*g,gadpos

I'm sure the function that BlitzGUIGen delivers is more eloquent than that :)

You'd think I'd remember that you use the NCS, you mention it every time

Subject: @{b}AHI & Blitz@{ub}

Hi out there !

I`m a new and fresh member of this Blitzlist.
I`ve been using blitz since 6 years now.

I have some problem using AHI with Blitz,
so I searched the web and found this list.

My first question:
Does anybody know how to use the 
AHI library functions within Blitz ?

I`ve already implemented some code
but it behaves very unstable. I often get
"Privileg violation" Gurus or the machine
freezes.

I`ve done some stable code using AHI via device interface.
If someone is interessted I can post this code.

Ciao,

Thilo

Paul Burkey done some AHI functions for Blitz, but I don't know if it was 
using the device or the library. I can't seem to find the archive any 
more either.

I'd be interested in your code, if you could send it to me that would be 
great.

@NODE "mail_7" " Animation Question "
From: Jason Faramus <Jason@...>

Subject: @{b}Animation Question@{ub}

Hi all,

How would I go about animating a character in Blitz? In AMOS I used to use AMAL
but since using Blitz I have yet to find an effective method. I have tried putting all of
the frames that I want to animate in data statements and reading them into a
variable that is used to select the image. Is this the best way to tackle the
problem?

Thanks Jason.

'------------------------------
Here's what I'm doing at the moment.

    statu$="WALKINGLEFT"
    Restore PLAYER_+statu$

If JoystickRight

The general method I guess is correct (repeating loops of shape numbers), 
although I think it would be quicker like this:

#START_FRAME_LEFT = 1
#END_FRAME_LEFT = 3
#START_FRAME_RIGHT = 4
#END_FRAME_RIGHT = 6

If JoystickLeft(1)
    startframe = #START_FRAME_LEFT
    playerframe = #START_FRAME_LEFT-1
    endframe = #END_FRAME_LEFT
EndIf

If JoystickRight
    startframe = #START_FRAME_RIGHT
    playerframe = #START_FRAME_RIGHT-1
    endframe = #END_FRAME_RIGHT
EndIf

playerframe+1
If playerframe>endframe Then playerframe=startframe
QBlit 0,playerframe,100,100

@NODE "mail_9" " Auto Fire Problem "
From: Jason Faramus <Jason@...>
Date: 06-25-01 20:49:16
Subject: @{b}Auto Fire Problem@{ub}

Hi all,

Can anybody help me with this really obvious question as my brain is not in
gear at the moment and it's driving me nuts.

In a game I'm making when the player presses fire on the joypad/stick the
character fires his gun, the problem is that if the player continually holds
the fire button down the character just happily keeps on shooting. I do not
want this to happen as it's like having autofire on. I just want the character
to fire one bullet and then, if the player's still holding the button down do
nothing until the player releases the button then represses. Any ideas?

Best wishes,
Jason.

On 25-Jun-01,  Jason Faramus said -

try:-

tjb=jb
jb=joyb(1)    ;Or whichever port the joystick is in

if tjb<>jb
    
    the rest of your code

endif

this will allow jb to be used as a toggle to test whether or not the state of
the button has changed since you last read it (unless your code takes a long
time to execute and the user can press, release and press the button fast
enough)

It's a quick and dirty solution, but it should work.

I was there at the dawn of the third age of mankind. It began in the earth
year 2257 with the founding of the last of the Babylon stations, located
deep in neutral space. It was a port of call for refugess, smugglers,
businessmen, diplomats and travellers from hundred worlds. It could be a
dangerous place, but we accepted the risk because Babylon 5 was our last
best hope for peace. Under the leadership of its final commander, Babylon 5
was a dream given form. A dream of a galaxy without war, when species from
different worlds could live side by side, in mutual respect. A dream that
was endagered as never before by the arrival of one man on a mission of
destruction. Babylon 5 was the last of the Babylon5 stations.
This is it´s story...

Nowhere. After I signed up to the webspace provider, everything seemed 
OK, I checked their forums and there weren't many complaints. But now, 
for some strange reason, they either keep mucking around with their 
server config or their server keeps dying (well, it does run Windows 2000 
AFAIK ;).

It is there (when it works) but I'm cleaning the pages up anyway, so I 
might as well look for a(nother) completely reliable host. It shouldn't 
make too much difference to you (the users) if you use the .co.uk URL.

Sorry for the hassle.

If you are going to have many animationframes for each 
character I suggest having some kind of fixed amount of 
shapes in each of the directions your character can 
move in. However it isn't that hard to use different 
amount of shapes per direction - it just requires some 
thought and caution.

This example might be a little overkill here for what 
you want to do but it shows one possible example of 
doing animation.

I hope that this makes sence for to, ask me if there is 
anything you are wondering about.

Subject: @{b}cia timing@{ub}

This CIA timing thing Ants made works well. But it`s only allowing an asm
interupt handler and can`t use Blitz variables. Is there a way to use Blitz
variables/commands or go around it and use some pokes or something?

I am currently using setint 5 as interrupt handler to run the necessary code
in and using the timer/resttimer commands from riamoslib, which uses a CIA
timer. It works well. But doesn`t offer enough granularity(it fires every 1/50
of a second) to raise/lower 1 bpm at a time. It raises like 7-10 bpm. And
ofcourse the stint 5 itself only uses 50 or 60 Hz. But it`s a nice fix until I
get proper timing/interrupt settled.

As a side note, I read some docs on devcd2.1 and it says to always use
CIAB-timer B if possible. In the RKRM this had been told incorrectly.

I just put up an CIA interrupt with setintvector_. It`s not very hard.
Btw: I noticed that using the paula interrupt is a bit easier
(but more hardware banging!) and provides better timing,
because it has not the problem with the detuning when
CPU is on heavy load. (Also this problem seems to
be very slighly) Disdvantage is that you loose one
audio channel. I also implemented this successfuly.

Yes, saw RIFastserial. Seems to be a similar hack like mine.
Difference is that my code can be executed within interrupts
because it is pure ASM, as RIFastserial consists of Blitz Commands.

As I am also a musician, my intention is to write
a professional application that supports several
serial ports like the silversurfer and is system friendly. 
You can not write a hardware hack for all serial 
connectors out there, that is because serial.devices exist.
My programm will support up to 4 MIDI outs.
(limitation is only the gadgets in the prefs-gui,
could easily increased)

If you manage MIDI out within a thread instead of an interrupt
you have two problems:
- your thread can`t do things parallel like open/close
windows, do graphic output and MIDI output.
Thus install a seperate thread with a higher priority than
the main thread that has only one thing to do: MIDI output (or input)
This thread will NOT be blocked by window sizing, menues
and similar stuff.
- thread is blocked by other threads with higher priority
Solution: put it very high. I think setting priority over 25
will prevent the thread from suffering from user inputs.
I will see in the near future how good the performance is.

Yes, performance is very good, i know. Currenlty I have "your" 
solution implemented.
I don`t know which resolution you are
trying, I use 192 ticks per quarter. 
But if there is no data to
send within a cetain period of time (say one quater), 
my "thread solution" will sleep all the time and consume 0% CPU 
while the interrupt is caused 192 times, only to notice 
that there is no data to send.
At 192 ticks per quarter there are about 95% of the interrupt
calls unneccessary.

No. Within an interrupt no Blitzcommands are available.
But I saw some code that did it. But can`t remember where.

The problem is that the registers a4, a5, a6 & d7 are expected
to contain some special data like a pointer to the blitz-variable base.
That is the same reason why you are not allowed to change these
registers when you use inline ASM. So I guess if you write
some ASM code in top of the interrupt handler that restores this 
registers, it must be possible to use Blitz commands.

But I prefer ASM within interrupts, because it is faster and 
interrupts are time-critical.

 Yeah I had a look at the interupt docs I've got, and you have to save
and restore any registers you use.

  I checked it out- it doesn't crash but the blitz code doesn't seem to
work :/

I tried this-

.Interrupt  
 MOVEM.l a0-a6/d0-d7,-(a7)        ; save register

  test=test+1

  MOVEM.l (a7)+,a0-a6/d0-d7        ; restore register
RTS  

  - And tried printing test out in the main loop- but it stays at `0' :/
I think I've tried this before, and it didn't work.

No no ! You missunderstood me !

1. You have to save and rescue any register you change during the interrupt.
Registers you don`t change can be left untouched.

2. To make Blitz commands & variables work, you have to fill the registers
a4, a5, a6 & d7 with blitz-specific data as the blitz
commands expect these register to have ceriandata in it. 
(e.g. pointer to the variables)
That means you have to save their contents anywhere in RAM and
when the interrupt is called you have to write this data back to 
the registers before you use any blitz stuff.

I have never tried this, but it should work. There is also
an example in Aminet how to use Blitz Commands
within hooks, this must be the same thing.

Thilo

I don't think you need d7, and you only need a4 if you are working inside 
a function. I think it is also a good idea to preserve a3 which Blitz 
uses as a string buffer of some kind.

Yes, it works if you do something like this:

move.l a5,globbase

OK, your Blitz library and system libraries sound like they are working 
correctly (sort of) since they are trying to read from the directory you 
tell it to (I don't know why it checks FONTS: first).

I just tried a program like that and it works as expected. I've attached

Subject: @{b}Fonts not loading - solution@{ub}

Hi all,

Just another point about fonts not appearing to load correctly is that 
they sometimes don't get used for the GT gadgets. This is because (I 
think) that gadtools.library doesn't load fonts from disk.

So when you have done 'LoadFont 0,"progdir:blah.font",10' the font is set 
up with the path name in it. Gadtools then ignores the font and uses the 
default screen font.

To get the fonts to work properly in your GUI you can do this:

    LoadFont 0,"progdir:blah.font",10
    LoadFont 1,"blah.font",10
    Use IntuiFont 1
    FreeFont 0

Hello all,

I'm creating a gadtools GUI for a little(?!?) project I'm working on. The GUI
includes a GTListView which is created without problems. However, when the
program quits, I get an error "Unable to free memory", which I have tracked down
to the GTListView (If I comment the GTListView out I don't get any problems).

During testing, this causes Blitz to hang. It also means I have to include the
runtime error debugger when I create an executable  to avoid the machine hanging.

I've tried freeing the list manually in my code but this results in the same
error. What's going on, and how can I cure it?

All the best

Steve.

Maybe you change the list during it is attached.
You have to use the GTchangelist command
to de/attach the list if it should be changed.

Have you installed the Gadtools bug-fix ?

No, I hadn't. I've had to re-install Blitz recently following a fairly serious
system meltdown. I re-installed all the orig stuff and BSS, but I forgot about
the patches. Just installed the bugfix, did a quick compile check, and it seems
to have cured it.

I wonder how long it'll be before I stop finding patches to my system that I
didn't know I'd lost?

Thanks very much. :o)

Some of them are on Aminet (in dev/basic), some are on the old RWE pages 
(http://www.ldngedge.demon.co.uk/Archives) and all should be on the 
Blitz2000 site (although most of it is currently broken, http://www.blitz-
2000.co.uk).

I just tried your MenuChecked problem on my machine and I get the same 
freezing problems, so I don't think any patches can help you. I don't 
know why it doesn't work, since I never use those commands.

You could try using the GTMenu library (part of BSS) and available at 
http://members.digitalrice.com/blitz-2000/archives/software/bss.lha
(yes that is one of the broken pages, so you won't find it unless you use 
that URL). The GTMenu library uses gadtools.library, so should be more 
compatible. AFAIK, nearly all the commands are the same, but you need to 
put a "GT" in front.

Hi Joar

I don`t remember what was your menu problem
exactly, but I have used the RIGTMenu library
and everything worked fine.

- get IDCMP message via *Event* or *Waitevent*
- find out which menu with *menuhit*, *itemhit* and *subhit*
- hotkeys are working (They don`t work correct under the old menulib)
- mutual exclusion is possible
- set and check the checkmark menuitems works

(be sure to have the latest version that

There's loads, you might even find some code for it. Try the official

I'm not sure how full a discussion it has about the theory, but Anton

Check out the UDPFuncs (Pyro-Mid is the game) on Aminet or his homepage

Well I don't know is the way you are doing things how good, but the way
you jsr:ed to library function certainly is incorrect.
When you jsr to library function you MUST have a6 loaded with the
library base address, because the library expects to find this address
and uses it for relative addressing.

So the jump to the function call should look something like this.

jsr functionoffset(a6) ; where a6 is loaded with the library base, which
you got from the openlibrary call.

You could use jsr (Rx.w,a6) and put the offset to Rx (but only if the
register Rx is not a parameter to the function you are calling).

I think best way would be to make small wrapper functions for each
library function (like fdconvert).

There are some fansy asm things you could do though, but if you haven't
coded with assembler then it's better to do the wrappers, because it's
much faster (unless you want to learn more about asm...).

Hi all !

I have some problems to access the AHI library functions.
As you can not include the AHI library funtions into
Blitz like normal shared libraries via .fd files,
I have to call them manually. For that, you
receive a pointer to the AHI library base from the ahi.device
and you can store it into a Blitz variable. Now I want to call some
functions. For this reason I wrote some small code
that encapsules the invoking process.
Some of the functions of the AHI library work well,
others crash with "privileg violation".
Is it my fault or some problem with Blitz ?

Please have a look at the code if it is
correct or if I have done something stupid.

Yup..dunno why the mhi library has it`s own sub directory though.
Not only that,under the MHI system, different hardware has a differently 
named MHI library..!
ie the MASplayer(pro version) uses Mhimaspro.library etc.. although all the 
functions/offsets etc are in the same place in each one.
I suppose I`ll have to get around to manually using libraries!
(I wish my ring bound Blitz manual wasn`t just a ring binder with about 3 
pages left in it :(( )
Any ideas as to how to call functions within a library without converting 
them to blitzlibs??

Anyway, the main thing is, I can get it to work and get on with other stuff 
while I figure that out.Ta for that signals tip David, works a treat

Hi Demon

> Any ideas as to how to call functions within a library without converting

Use assembler. Although there's not much you need to know about assembly 
to do it. Just make up stub functions and statements and call the library 
code from within, e.g.

DEFTYPE.Library *mhiBase

; Make up statements and functions for the library commands (obviously
; use a statement for commands that do not return a value). Give the
; statements, and functions the same parameters as the library commands
; (and use the same names for the parameters, it'll stop confusion).
; Make sure all the types are the same too.
Statement mhi_example1{par1.l, tags.l}
    SHARED *mhiBase ; You need access to the library base

    ; All you need to do is put the correct parameters in the correct
    ; registers (which you get from the autodocs)...
    GetReg d0,par1
    GetReg a0,tags
    GetReg a6,*mhiBase

    ; And then call the function using the correct offset (best to use
    ; constants, or even use fd2pragma or something).
    JSR -30(a6)
    AsmExit
End Statement


Function.l mhi_example2{mhi_handle.l, setting.l, tags.l}
    SHARED *mhiBase

    GetReg a0,mhi_handle
    GetReg d0,setting
    GetReg a1,tags
    GetReg a6,*mhiBase

    JSR -36(a6)

    ; You do not need to specify a return value, since Blitz
    ; automatically returns the value in d0 (which should
    ; be the result of the library call).
    AsmExit
End Function

*mhiBase = OpenLibrary_("mhiwhatever.library", version_number)
If *mhiBase

    ; Safe to use the MHI functions here

    CloseLibrary_ *mhiBase : *mhiBase = 0
    ; Do not use the functions again until you re-open the library

Cheers David, I`ll pluck up the courage to try it out this weekend.
Although I`m still baffled as to why the creator of the MHI libraries 
decided to make programmers call a hardware specific library.
I can`t see any reason why the user/installer routine shouldn`t just rename 
the specific library to libs:mhi.library, unless he has plans for a program 
that uses multiple hardware MP3 players!!
Still, my Mp3 player is working well..compiled to 28k (with blitz debugger

Can't find it in the BSS source archives I have, and I'm still convinced

I've tried doing the above David and have found it to work OK for what I need
it for but have one small probelm which I hope that you, or someone else can help
me with.

Instead of using display scroll to create a perspective effect I have cut out
each individual line as a seperate shape. Each shape is placed on the screen, each one
lower than the one before to create the graphic image (original .iff). Next, I test the joystick and
move each shape down the display a little faster on the x-axis than the line above
giving us the illusion of motion (albeit ALOT slower than proper Display Scrolling :( )

This works fine, I increase the x-axis  0.0125 for line one 0.0125*2 for line two
0.0125*3 for line three and so on for all the lines on the display, 50 in
total which is moved 0.0125*50. The problem is this, when the joystick is held
left the lines/shapes scroll properly with perspective to the left, when I hold
right they do the same to the right but when the display crosses the middle
section i.e. there inital positions, dead center I get an ugly pause. This in
effect is just like in DPaint when you have a looping anim and it has got two
identical frames in a row thus causing a pause. I think that the same thing is
happening and the same line/shape position is being shown twice as when the
joystick is moved either left or right when the display is dead center all the
shapes just shift 1 pixel to the left or right all at the same speed, just as if
you were moving them all as one whole shape. I cannot figure out how to cure
it though. Can anybody solve this (probably really obvious) problem for me?

Thanks and sorry for the long email.

Could it possibly be just due to the mathematics of the thing?

e.g. You'll have positions of 0 for all the things in the initial (middle)
position. When you move one frame to the right, the biggest distance is
going to be 50*0.0125=0.625.

When you do any displaying with this, the .625 part just gets removed, so
the things are all still displayed at position 0.

@NODE "mail_59" " MUI ListView problem... "
From: Gareth Griffiths <mail@...>

Subject: @{b}MUI ListView problem...@{ub}

Hi,

OK, I've managed to get two MUI ListView's on my window, although I haven't
written any code for the six buttons I mentioned in an earlier mail...

My problem is that the listview entries are not just limited to the ones in
my array.

My code (minus the constants and window stuff)
----
Dim array$(4)
array$(0)="Arse1" : array$(1)="Arse2" : array$(2)="Arse3"
array$(3)="Arse4" : array$(4)="Arse5"

MUIListHook Off
MUIList #w5_list_left,"WEIGHT=150",array$()
MUIAddTags #w5_lv_left,#MUIA_Frame,#MUIV_Frame_ReadList
MUIListView #w5_lv_left,#w5_list_left
----

The listviews come out fine, but the contents confuse me... Arse1-5 are
there, but then there is a load of garbage in the list as well. The
scrollbar is the right size to accomodate these other garbage items too.

Any ideas?

Cheers,
GazChap.

I've got a new problem! It never used to do this in old versions of my
program (I'm rewriting the new version of MP3-2-HTML from scratch) and I
can't see any differences in the code that might do it.

Basically, if I run the program and try and access the MUI settings for it,
it crashes with a "GURU! ILLEGAL INSTRUCTION!" or something error.

Is there something you have to do to get MUI Settings to function properly?

MUIApplicationBase defines the name of the messageport
of the application. So I see no reason why it should be limited
to 4 chars. I also have some programms working stable
with much longer MUIApplicationBase`s.

My only idea is maybe it was a typo and what it really meant

You definately have the files:

PROGDIR:Fonts/Xen.font
PROGDIR:Fonts/Xen/9

? Because that code should work. Have you checked what actually happens 
using SnoopDos? I'm beginning to wonder if there is perhaps different 
versions of the IntuiFont library with one version that works and another 
that doesn't.

Try this code from James Boyd's StatsFuncs collection:

; Function : OSAssign { assign name, path, type }

; Author : James L Boyd - jamesboyd@...

; This function creates an assign and returns True if
; successful, false if not.

; The parameters are the assign name (eg. "MyAss:"), the
; path which this assign refers to (eg. "Work:Gfx/Pics"),
; and the type of assign - True (-1) for Path, or False (0)
; for a Late assign.

; Path assigns are activated immediately, Late assigns
; only activate when you try to use them (saves clogging
; up file/path requesters for a start :)

; I've called it OSAssign to avoid confusion with the BSS command
; Assign.

; Also, the function checks for the existence of the path
; you specify, since you CAN assign a name to a non-existent
; drawer! It returns False (0) if the path doesn't exist.

; Sore Point : Don't know how to remove it, except for :

;   Execute_ "run >NIL: assign <assign> REMOVE",0,0

Function.b OSAssign {name$,path$,PathOrLate.b}

If Exists(path$)

  Select PathOrLate

    Case 0 ; LATE assign...starts when accessed.

      If AssignLate_(&name$,&path$)
        Function Return -1
      Else Function Return 0
      EndIf

    Case -1 ; PATH assign...starts immediately.

      If AssignPath_(&name$,&path$)
        Function Return -1
      Else Function Return 0
      EndIf

  Default
      Function Return 0
  End Select

Else Function Return 0
EndIf

End Function

; demo :

;; NOTE : To remove the assign after testing, go to the CLI and
;; type "assign MyAss: REMOVE" (without the quotes!).

; If OSAssign {"MyAss","SYS:C/",-1} ; -1=path assign...
;   Request "","Success! MyAss: is assigned to the SYS:C/ drawer!","OK"
; Else Request "","Couldn't assign MyAss: !","OK"
; EndIf

; End

AmigaLibsII needs some underscores in the type names and sometimes in the 
variable names inside the types. But I can't remember which. Look at the 
newtypes from inside the compiler. Check if amigalibsii uses _Screen or 
maybe Screen_. You can then check the variables inside the screen type to 
see if they also need underscores.

Hi amorel !

I haven`t made any midi data structures. I have only used a bunch of midi
commands to send note on and then note off at a certain midi channel. In order
to test midi data actually got sent through the serial. Once the nativa audio
replaying works good enough and is implemented for the biggest part I`ll get
into the midi stuff.

You can do:

; checks all signals specified in the mask and then sets them to the

Wouldn't there be problems if other people use your program? I'm guessing 
that there is some reason for the library to be in a subdirectory of 
libs:, and all other installs will have the file in that subdir too?

@NODE "mail_74" " problem with menuchecked command "
From: Joar Berntsen <joar.berntsen@...>

Subject: @{b}problem with menuchecked command@{ub}

hi, this is my problem

command:MenuChecked(menulist,menu,item,[subitem]) returns false or true

this is an example of what i want to do:

test1=MenuChecked(18,1,1,0) ; this 1 was processed fine
test2=MenuChecked(18,1,1,1) ; process stops, and no error is displayed
test3=MenuChecked(18,1,1,2) ; cant step to this 1

the debugger cant quit, and not the prog. but i can step back on the
debugger.

the subitem exists
max menulists is 100
compiled with make smallest code
if i run it without debugger it will just slow down the system on the 2.
line.


what is the reason??? :/



some other things i've wondered about:

I have never understood how to use the Period command,and not got any result
from trying it..  how do u use it??

what version is "the ultimate blitz basic"? I have 2.10

hope you have some answers.

I don`t know a period command, if you mean the setperiod command, I use this:

runnersoff
xbsetperiod soundcode,soundperiod
runnerrson

The setperiod command crashes the debugger so I switch that off and on
afterwards. Also if you use the xbones sound library you can put xb in front
of sound commands. They are apparantly better.

I think the official Blitz Support Suite version allows mutual exclusion 
items. You can get the full BSS from http://www.blitz-

Sorry for the awkward URL, but some of my pages seem to have reverted to

Its not so easy. I have the same problem porting the game "Toadies"
to graphics cards. I thought about replacing every single Blitz
command into a system friendly one and that`s it. But due to very different
performance of the single operations it is not possible. Forget copperlists,

smooth scrolling and tricks with bitplanes. Everything that runns in 
blitzmode-only is not possible (including BBlit). 
Also BitmapToWindow is very slow and not suitable or quick drawings. 
Best method is to keep everything that is possible in a bitmap allocated in 
the graphics card memory.
Things like fading is also a bit tricky, because you can not rely on that
your screen is colour mapped like AGA screens. Fades on hi/true color
screens means to recalculate the whole picture which is not possible
on ZII cards in acceptable framerates.
But if you find some solutions for games on graphics cards, it would
be interessting for me.

I've got a guy with a Spectrum doing tests for me. I gathered from past posts
that you need to use window based drawing commands which I've done, but I'm
still having trouble. Can you use BBlit commands on a bitmap and then do a
BitMaptoWindow? It also uses a routine that utilizes the FadePalette command
that does not seem to work with RTG. Is there a paper or perhaps some other

Hello Mark !

For applications, if the speed has not to be

I have used successfully "BitMap" and "BitMapToWindow"
or "NBitMap" and "NCopyBitMap" (NewCommandSet)

But there is still the problem left that you have
to watch out for the right colours of the bitmap.

Easy if you have your own screen where
you can define the palette like you want.

Difficult if you use this on a WB screen,
you have to remap the bitmap to get
the right colours.

Someone an idea for this ?

I posted some code here recently for remapping shapes (to the WB colours) 
so they could be used as NImageGadget's/GTShape's. It worked on 15/16 bit 
screenmodes also, although I guess the shapes you wanted to draw had to 
be 8 bit or less - if you wanted to draw in 15/16/24/32 bit colours I 
think you'd need to use the cybergraphics or picasso96 libraries directly.

I can re-send the code (if anyone is interested and I can find it)?

Subject: @{b}Running external programs@{ub}

Hello again,

OK, I'm putting the finishing touches to a little (?!?) utility, which as a
matter of course hasto run external programs (either my own, or AmigaDOS
commands).

1) I've tried it two ways, opening an ARexx port and having the orig program
generate and run an Arexx script - Very clunky and untidy.

2) Writing a commandline to CON: and using the Execute_ command.

Option two is much cleaner and faster, but opens a CON: window on screen. I'd
like to acheive the same effect, but without the CON: window, but I'm stumped.

I need to be able to run an external program, and then, as I wish, either
continue executing the original program immediately, or optionally, wait for the
external program to return before continuing. I don't want to use any third
party hacks because I want my program to run on as wide a range of machines as
possible, without the need to install anything other than mine.

Do I have any options?

All the best

Steve.

Okay, try this:

Execute_ "ThisIsTheProgram >NIL:",0,0

The ">NIL:" bit is what should stop the CON: window appearing.

See above. My program uses this and works fine, continues running. No
problems.

If you want to wait for it to finish, you might want to remove the ">NIL:"
bit, but then you will get the annoying CON: window again/

Hope this helps.

Nope, I had tried various options using re-direction to NIL: and have now tried
your suggestion. I Still get the CON: window appearing.

Apart from which, for some of the external programs, it is essential that I wait
for them to finish before continuing execution, since they will be processing
files that I will then need.

What program are you using? If it's opening it's own CON: window, then there
is no way to stop it. I was assuming that CLI was opening one, in which case my 
code would have worked.

What program is this? Does it need input?

Have you tried the NULL: device, because it implements complete device
interface like CON: unlike NIL:
(You can find it from the Aminet ofcourse ;)

No, it is CON: that's opening the window (I'm using 3-4 external programs, one
of which is one of my own, and doesn't write to the console at all).

Each of the external programs takes commandline parameters, and I wonder if this
is something to do with it.

Besides, as I said in an earlier mail, I have to wait for some of the externals
to return, which means I can't use >NIL: for those anyway.

It's starting to look like I'll have to put up with it.

Well Have you tried to execute those programs one by one so that you can
see which one is makeing the con: to appear?
It's so dificult to help when you doesn't have a glue what kind of
programs you are trying to run.
Do some of these programs nead input? if so have you redirected it
correctly? are you pipeing something? and if you are is it bi or mono
directional pipeing? So many questions and only few answers. ;)

The programs are already executed one by one, and they all open the CON: window.

And example of the programs used are AmigaDOS list and sort commands, both
redirected to files, and so not producing any output to the Console, nor
requiring any input from the user.

Further programs are my own (Blitz) programs, which I could include in the main
code, but I'm anxious to keep the executable size to a minimum (It runs as a
commodity permanently). Neither of my own programs output anything to the
Console. Where any output is required, they open their own windows internally
and output to a GTText gadget in that (using GTSetString).

No piping takes place at all.

Steve.

Hello !

I wrote some code that does similar things and
I remember that it does matter if the calling programm
(your Blitz Programm) was called from CLI or from WB.
If you call it from CLI it opens a CON: Window,
otherwise not.
If the programm has an .info icon you have a cycle gadget
to define the way it is started. (set it to "WB" for no CON:)

I have written several programs that run externals without a CON: window, I use the 
following method

cmd$="external program"
execute_ &cmd$,0,0

you will still get a CON: on anything less than OS3.x

If the program you are waiting to finish is your own just get it to
write a tempory file in t: then use a loop to check for it eg.

External program:

    if writefile(0,"t:return")
        fileoutput 0
        nprint "finished"
        defaultoutput
        closefile 0
    else
        ;oops an error
    endif

Main Program:
    finished.b=false
    repeat
        filefound.l=lock_("T:return",0)
        if filefound
            finished.b=true
            unlock_ filefound
            kill "T:return"
        endif
        delay_ 1
    until finished


If it's not yours try executing two commands at once eg.

cmd$="external program"+chr$($A)+"Echo >T:return finnished"

Then use the same routine to check for it, I'm not sure this
will work as I havn't tried it...
    
Hope this helps...

of KingCON or if this is a general feature.

Would someone NOT using any CON: patches (KingCON etc.) please run the attached
and tell me if it opens a CON: window during execution.

There should be no output - it's just a test.

Thanks in advance.

All the best

Steve.

cmd$="C:List >nil: c:"+Chr$(10)+"endcli" #Why?#
cli$="con:0/0/0/0/GHelp/AUTO" #Why?#

If you don't want a CON: window, why are you deliberately opening one
then telling it not to open unless something is output (AUTO option)?

This would do the same thing:

    cmd$="C:List >nil: c:" : Execute_ &cmd$,0,0
 

Here is an extract from a program I wrote to search/Sort/rename/delete mp3 files 
(It is available at http://home.snafu.de/dcr/ ) It does nothing
until the executed program has finished. Maybe one of the programs 
your calling detatches itself from the cli. That would cause
your program to continue running without the info it needs.

Hi Nick

No it doesn't, Gosub / Return get changed into JSR / RTS and nothing 
else. There might be more if you have the debugger on, but in that case 
you are obviously not worried about exe size or speed.

BSR / RTS might be smaller (2 bytes) and faster (1 clock cycle?) but 
you're not saving much. If you really want to optimise the Blitz 
executables, disassemble them and then scream in horror at the code it's 
produced :)

It won't make any difference at all, except you won't get nice error 
messages like "Return without Gosub" when using the debugger (if

I was reading CON: to allow me to check for errors if the external program does
something odd or doesn't exist. As it happens, I suppose I could check for
obvious error, such as a missing external before calling Execute_. Obvious,
really. I just didn't think of it :o/

Thanks to those that replied. If nothing else, it has got me thinking a little
differently about how I do things.

You using the NCS?

I think it would be something like this:

NResetTagList #SA_DisplayID,<whatever eg 640x200 is>
NAddTag #SA_Width,640
NAddTag #SA_Height,400
NAddTag #SA_AutoScroll,-1
; etc

No you added the width and height tags.

But it seems I got to add actual values to the screen command, if I use the
values supplied by aslrequester it will only open on hires and it seems the
#sa_height and width don`t do something in that case.

Also the crashes were caused by drawing windows relatively of the visible
screen dimensions(nscreenwidth etc).

I don't think so, unless you have a pointer to another window which you

@NODE "mail_112" " Using libraries "
From: Demon Hell <demonhell_@...>
Date: 06-04-01 23:11:58
Subject: @{b}Using libraries@{ub}

Hi guys,
   I got a small problem I suspect is down to the way I`m using a library. I 
converted the mhimasprolibrary.fd to A blitzlib using the fdconvert program, 
and all the commands get highlighted and work..

Problem is, when I first call my program from the CLI, the debugger gives me 
a "GURU ILLEGAL INSTRUCTION" alert, and stops the program!
But on starting it again, it runs fine.

I tracked the problem down to where my program first calls a command from 
the library, so I figured it must be down to the way I opened the library, 
using the following line.

libaddr.l=openlibrary_("libs:mhi/mhimaspro.library",0)
(btw, when it crashes libaddr.l is non zero)

I supposed I`ve missed something bleeding obvious, but I got no example code 
of using external libraries to hand!

There are many possibilities for this happening. Anything that trashes
memory, corrupts the stack, plays with Blitz registers, etc, etc can cause
this kind of error.

Could you give us some context about when and how you are making the calls
tothe library?

You do not need to do this when using external libraries in Blitz. When
you convert the FD file, the Blitz library which is created has some
initialisation code added to it which automatically gets called when the
library i sused in your program. This initialisation code will do the
OpenLibrary(...) for you.

So your code should just look like:

; Example code
DoSomeSharedLibFunction_(blah)
blah
blah
End

So would opening the library twice cause the above problem?

No, opening the library twice will just leave the library open one extra
time (unless you call CloseLibrary in your code). It woudl definately not
cause a crash though.

I've heard E libraries can course problems if opened more than once

Are the MHI commands you are using all from the library
libs:mhi/mhimaspro.library (which is the same one you open)?

If so, you'll want to hex-edit the .library1 file and check what the
library it is trying to open is.

I think it might probably just be trying to use mhimaspro.library (i.e.
not in the sub-directory), so when you use the commands from the lib, the
library base is 0 and you'll be jumping to some weird memory locations.

If this is the problem, you'll probably need to modify the fdconvert program to
specify the correct file. The source was included with New(er)FDConvert by
Curt and James on Aminet. I don't think plain hex-editing will work, but I
suppose you could try it.

Bye
