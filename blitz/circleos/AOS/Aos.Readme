AOS readme.

This is the sourcecode for CircleOS. It shows you how you
can create a desktop. Its not perfect, but at least it
shows you how i would approach the problem.

I hope that this code can be of help to someone, im sure
it contains many small snippets that people would like to
see in their own programs.

Remember to run the assign script first!!
