Well, you can use Wblit.  And also use a standard bitmap and use any bitmap
commands, then BitMapToWindow to put this on the window.

But this is not really a good method for either GFX card or standard system. 

The problem with this method is speed - I think this would slow down your
program a lot.  I'm not sure, I really haven't tried doing it this way.

Better to use ShowBitmap for standard systems.

And for GFX cards, use chunkies and Wpa8 or something.  I really don't know a
lot about GFX cards, I don't have one.

That's exactly, what the problem was. I forgot a "0" in the constant. It

Yes, Joyb(0)=3D2 now works again.

Hi !

I`ve some questions about Asm source to blitz converting:

1) It seems that Blitz doesn`t like variable types at the end of
     a variable...for example (a0,4.w),a1 wouldn`t work but (a0,4),a1
    would work. Do I need those extensions or can I remove them?

2) How can I make a line like this working: Move.l (a0,a7),(a6)

3) Which others thing do I need to know if I want to convert asm src
     to Blitz?

Greetings,
--

  You could try `DEFTYPE .w' before your code- I don't know if it would
work with assem.

 If you intend on using ASM in statements or functions or want to mix ASM and blitz then 
you need to remember these things:

1) a3 is used as a pointer to strings when they are being manipulated
2) a4 is used as the local variable base (in statements / functions)
3) a5 is used as the global variable base

I couldn't get that working either. Probably doesn't support it.

I am not sure that that's a legal addressing mode. I recall having to
use: Move.l 0(a0,a7),(a6)

There's no stackpointer variable as you know. Macros are generally
defined differently I think. Assembler in blitz statements may get
fidgety if you try to use an rts (such as subroutine). Not sure if
that can be worked around or not.

There may be other things to consider.

okay guys,
	can anyone give me idea how feasable it is to run an anim of
disk as the backdrop to a game?
	It would be really cool to write a platformer like Beast/Beast2
but where the backdrops are rendered as an anim and controlled as the
player walks. I.e. the player stays in the centre of the screen.
	Clearly though this would only work if they could be spooled off
CD. Any ideas?

or something like that.
The easiest way to do this is to save every frame of your anim out =

Subject: Changing Gadtools

Hey Blitz-type people, got another question, (hopefully after asking all these
questions, I might be able to provide some answers :) )

How can I change a the size, width, height etc of a GTgadget (say a GTstring
gadget), can I just detachGTlist #(list number) define it as if it didn't
exist then re attach the list redrawing the one I changed, or is there
something else I have to do, or some other way I have to go about it. I ask
this cos I have defined a GTstring gadget and I want to be able to change it's
appearance from time to time, possibly change what type of gadget it is.

Also is adding to the list as simple as detaching it adding the gadgets I want
and re attaching the list ?

I've only been able to do this by remaking the gadgetlist:

DetachGTList
Free GTLIST                  ;MUST do this!  Or else you get 2 or more copys!
(remake the entire GTlist)
AttachGTList

If you don't Free the GTlist before re-making it, intuition keeps BOTH copies,
and you can wind up with 2 (or more) sets of gadgets in the window at once. 
(and they all work, too!  I speak from experience - ie, I made this mistake
before!)

I haven't done this while the window is still open, but it should work for
that too.  You will probably need to do a WCLS to clear out the old gadget
images first, or at least do a Wbox over the gadget(s) you are changing.


The other part, about just adding a gadget - might work by just detaching the
GTlist, then re-attaching it.

I don't think this is possible, except from a painting program when saving an
entire picture.  A palette file by itself contains only colour info.

IFF is a fileformat standard, part of which is to support the storage
of ILBM pictures - InterLeaved BitMaps. The file has a number of
`chunks' which have a small header such as "CAMG" (amiga display
modes) or "BODY" bitmap data. There are chunks for colourcycling too.
If you could get hold of some saveiff sourcecode you could write a
little prog to save off the palette and colourcycling to an IFF file
with the appropriate chunks in it.

I wouldn't, since I don't seem to have this one available on my system  ;)
Square pixel modes available here are hi-res laced (NTSC & PAL), lo-res (NTSC

I have done this by using "GetAShape" - I think it will only work on the
currently active window.  And the size is limited to 640 * 400.

Then you can use "ShapesBitmap" to convert this into a Bitmap for drawing on,
etc.

Also, the scroll command would probably work, using the Screen's Bitmap number
as the "from" bitmap, and your other bitmap as the "to" bitmap.  But here you
would need to determine your window's exact location in reference to the
screen.

You might want to get Xopa (on Aminet).  This program will show you a list of
all active tasks (as well as screens, assigns, fonts, and a whole bunch of
other useful stuff)  Also note that the tasknames seem to be case sensitive -
if the task is listed as "Mpega", you won't find it with Findtask_("mpega")

On this subject:  I've found out that some programs are listed as Tasks, while
others are Processes.  Findtask_ won't find Processes.

Is there a command to find Processes?  And just what the heck is the
difference anyway???

HiHo PPl out there!

I have got two little problems:

1st :

I have a window and a bitmap, both of the same size. Now I want to copy the
Windowsbitmap to the bitmap. (the opposit of Bitmaotowindow). Please help me!

2nd :

I'm still writing a GUI for MPEGA. Now I want to send a Ctrl+C to the program,
but I can't find the Tasks address with Findtask_("mpega"). What is the right
Taskname and how can I find it out?

thank u very much!

HiHo PPl out there!

Here are my problems:

I have a window and a bitmap, both of the same size. Now I want to copy the
Windowsbitmap to the bitmap. (the opposit of Bitmaotowindow). Please help me!

Isn't it possible to copy the bitmaps directly by using the CopyMem_ command?
It should be, but how can I get the WindowsBitmap Address? I'm able to grab
the bitmap's address as the source, but how can I get the destination of the
Window? I hope u know what I mean! (Oh, my silly english! *s*)

2nd :

My FindTask_ Problem again! :(((

I've found out, that MPEGA is not a task! It's a process! U can suggest my
question? Right: How can I get the address of these Process? FindProcess_ does
not exists, but there must be another way!

Thank u!

Blitzers,

I hope all these questions aren't annoying too many people

Is it possible to assign A GT gadget hit to a variable

eg a=GadgetHit
   Nprint a

If so, I cant get it to work, I can get the right gadget number returned with
GadgetHit but I can't assign it anywhere, I particularly need to know who to
determine what String Gadget was last clicked in / generated the event.

Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am pulling my hair and I shall be

Save you hair!  This works for me:

Ev.l=waitevent

if Ev=$20 or Ev=$40 then gh.w=GadgetHit

This way, gh will always hold the id number of the gadget that was hit.  Even
if other events happen later.

I think GadgetHit actually returns a Long, but unless you have over 32,000
gadgets a word should do  ;)

$20 is returned if a string gadget is clicked in, $40 when return is pressed
to end the input.  So use just one or the other (or both) depending on what
you are doing from there. 

Later...

That's what this list is for, to get enlightment from people who are smarter

Yes it is but,
>eg a=GadgetHit
>   Nprint a

you should be aware of what .type your variable is. In your two example
lines it should work alright. But,

a=23  ;a is defined as a deftype variable normally .quick
a=gadgethit  ;gadgethit contains a longword not an integer (quick)

would not work, coz in the first line, a is defined as a .quick type
variable, in the second line you should use a .long type.
=>
a.l=gadgethit

All this is not 100% correct, coz I don't know if gadgethit really contains
a .long ,but just be aware of your types, dude!

So long,
chris

Of course, but every programmer should try out the different approaches
on as many systems as possible, because I discovered that those PPC
processors act quite differently. For example, marking memory as
noncachable in the voxelspace demo helped to improve the performance on
603E based systems a lot while it even slowed down the demo on 604E
based system (probably because of the much greater memory bandwidth).

Additionally I hope that those programmers will not only read the
technical part but also the rest about game play. I would rather buy a
game with a perfect game play, which is slower by 20 percent, than the
faster one, which is not playable at all. I think, that many programmers
spend too much time into performance and technical features. Therefore
I also hope, that standards like OpenGL will be supported by more and
more programmers in future (as soon as the performance will suffice
thanks to 3D hardware support) so that they can concentrate on other
features and they don't have to care for the lowlevel work anymore.

No problem. Just place a remark, where you took the docs from and place
a link to the WarpUp site for all those people which would like to
download the whole archive.

Subject: GTShape and Shapegadget

Hello,

I have some Problems mit GTShape-Gadgets and (Blitz-)Shapegadgets:

When I use GTShape the loaded Shapes will only be displayed in
4 colours. But they are 8-colour-shapes. Is this a but in GTShape
or in Gadtools or does Gadtools only support up to 4 colours?

Also when I use GTShape and want to use two Shapes (the second
for the pressed Gadget)... like:

Loadshape 0,"0.iff"
Loadshape 1,"1.iff"
Loadshape 2,"2.iff"
Loadshape 3,"3.iff"
Loadshape 4,"4.iff"
Loadshape 5,"5.iff"

GTShape 0,50,10,10,$10,0,1
GTShape 0,51,30,30,$10,2,3
GTShape 0,52,50,50,$10,4,5

Then it will display only Shape# 5 as 2nd (pressed) image in all
Gadgets. Is this a bug?


Then a problem with Shapegadgets:

Loadshape 0,"0.iff"

Shapegadget 0,10,10,$10,50,0

The shape has a size of 50X43 pixels. When I use the above
commands the Gadget seems to have a size of over 250 pixels!
What's wrong?

 Andy

I managed to find the mistake: the "$10"-Flag...when I replace it
with "0" it works perfectly!

I have not seen this one!  This command works OK here.  Do you have
VisualPrefs on your system.  I have heard VisualPrefs works by making all
GTgads into GTshapegads, so this might cause a problem.

I don't have this problem either.  Are you sure the shape is really 50 x 43?
You might try the "ShapeWidth" and "ShapeHeight" commands to tell for sure.

"When I hit the prefs button a window with 6 fields comes up. 5 fields are

("Device" is a GTString)

It works perfectly on my 020 system - can anyone help??

Hi All Blitzers...

This Email is for everyone who wants to know more about the new Amigalibs that
was send to you a week ago or, for everyone who scared to use OS functions...

Why a New lib?
- I rewrite all the new lib from the latest includes because like a lot of
users, I was tired to have some headacke to find and use "Tips" to patch the
old lib when I translated routines from C to Blitz.

Difference between then both libs...
- Now, you can use the OS Functions as describes in the RKM manual. All
examples can be use with very minor changes from C codes... to be usable in
Blitz.

All Newtypes ( Structures ) are describes like they should be... You won't
need patches to fix newtypes like we had to do with the Window one.


Examples:
Like I tell you before, now, you will be able to learn very fast how to
use/translate routines from C sources to be usable with Blitz... and to prove
my words... I send you a code that you can find in the RKM manual. "How to
create a gadget in a window..." ( and close the window with the closebutton ).

I hope you will appreciate and use the new lib...

Hi!

I`ve some questions about MUI with BB2....

1) Why does MUI displays Bubble Help on MUIString gadgets but not
     one SimpleButton Gadgets? For example:

    MUIAddTags 1,#MUIA_ShortHelp,Null("Help")
    MUIString 1,"Enter String",200
 
    works with no problems....but
 
    MuiAddTags 2,#MUIA_ShortHelp,Null("Help"(
    SimpleButton 1,"Blabla"
  
    doesn`t work. Why?

2) How can I set the height of my window it shall be opened at my
     first start? Then the user can size it how he likes - but at the first
     start on a new system the GUI shall use this height!

3) Can I combine Listtree.mcc with dirlist.mcc? That I can browse
     with listttree.mcc through directories? Is this possible?

Thank you

Subject: Multiplayer Net-link testing

  For those interested, I finally did some speed testing with my 
UDP_Chat (V1.9) program (thanks Julian :-) over the internet. It all ran
exactly as it does locally on my machine (bugs and all :), and I didn't
lose one packet- no resends needed at all (which is a little strange, as
UDP is only meant to be about 90% reliable)! It's good though, as my
routines have assumed only a small amount of dropped packets, for speed.
   The lag to Julian's machine (50/030) ran the same as a Ping test to
his machine (about 35 frames- 700ms), which shows UDP_Chat wasn't adding
any appreciable lag- yay!! (Julian: I was wrong about the lag being
twice the Ping- I stuffed up my calculations- doh). The lag from
Julian's machine through my program on my 500 and back, was about 40-50

@NODE "Mail.47" "narrator.device"
From: bohdan_lechnowsky@csgsystems.com
Date: Tue, 02 Jun 98 06:49:21 -0600
Subject: narrator.device


Does anyone on the list know how to access the narrator.device directly from 
Blitz?

For those of you who aren't sure what I'm talking about, the speech capability 
which shipped with AmigaOS up until the release of 2.1 consisted of the 
translator.library, narrator.device, speak-handler, and say utility.

The translator.library used English pronunciation rules to try to figure out how
to translate regular text like this into phonetic codons (i.e lay4k dhie3s).  
Seeing as how the English language doesn't follow any rules too well, 
pronunciation using the translator.library is not so good (not understandable at
all many times) even though it uses over 700 rules.

The narrator.device reads in the codons from the translator.library and converts
them into sound.

I am trying to replace the translator.library with a function which contains an 
entire pronunciation dictionary of over 100,000 English words with both American
and English pronunciations.

Any help would be appreciated!  I've got the source code of how to do it in C, 
but would like to avoid having to do it in C if at all possible.

Thanks!

-Bo

Thanks Curt!

Someone else on the Blitz list let me know there is a Blitz command to input 
phonetic data directly into the narrator.device (PhoneticSpeak).  It will be a 
very simple process of writing the program now :^)

Thanks again, though!

I don't know about the narrator device itself, but I did have a program on a 
CD here somewhere that allowed you to add rules to the regular translator 
library for specific words, phrases, etc.

I'm not sure if this would be of any help, but let me know.  It's probably on 
Aminet too, but I don't remember the name.  Maybe someone else knows?

@NODE "Mail.52" "New amiga games, and 25fps, and some blitting...."
From: Dave Newton <Dave@nbsamiga.demon.co.uk>
Date: Tue, 30 Jun 1998 13:47:34 -0000
Subject: New amiga games, and 25fps, and some blitting....


Hi all,

 Sorry about that. I was supposed to be going on holiday, and it's all been
canceled...so now I'm in a mess at the moment. Anyway, I just thought I'd
better email about a few things (sorry this isn't in any of the threads).

 Curt is completely correct about the 25fps thing. It's not the only way
to do it, but it's the best. My prefs program sets the fps by testing the
cpu (by just calling the maximum load of rouintes per frame, and working
out how many frames it will take). It will usually be on 25fps, and
if they have a incredibly fast machine, it may make 50fps...but I doubt
it. The slowdown in my game is the copy from the fastmem buffer to the
chipmem buffer...always seems to need nearly a frame to itself (320x256x8).
The way that Curt's works..if you haven't worked it out is too always force
a 25fps update, unless the routines take more than two frames...then it's
just as best as it can be. This is how a lot of pc games work. The point
is, say one update takes under a frame....and the next update takes over
a frame....just using a single vwait would make this very jerky, going
from 1 vwait to 2 vwait and so on, giving something like 33fps If I'm not
mistaken (didn't check...guessed). Where as, all the updates will take
2 frames giving you a more steady picture. 25fps will never look quite
as good as 50fps...but it is usable.

 I am still working on my blit routines. A clipblit is planned, and so
are some of the other features. I have finished the save/load for my
routines, but it's mostly untested. If you want to be a 'beta' tester
then email me, and I'll send you the latest version, so you can try it.
It'll be a week or so before there's more blitting stuff...but it will
be there. Hope that helps. (Btw, although the blockscroll is okay, to
do something like a fast>fast>chip where your going to copy the whole map,
you probably need a custom routine for you size. I have one for 320x256x8
if that helps, just to get the fastest speed possible).

 And about 'new' amiga games. If you want games on your machine, then you'll
have to put up with needing fast hardware. I used to program games back
in the day's off the first a500 with 1/2meg chip and 1 floppy. You could
do some great stuff, and still can....but today things have changed. When
pc's got fast and fancy graphics cards, the amiga was in trouble. I can't
even draw some lines on my machine in the same time as my 150 pentium
draws an entire 3d display with everything. The problem is that things
have got faster...like memory and processors. The amiga's chip speed
is very slow. The most anyone has of it is 2mb, unless your using an
emulator. And even that's not all available to you. And you can use
256 colours, but that slows the machine down, and you can't really do
anything fast unless you use lores. The problem is that games player's
have come to see better resolutions, better sound. I agree that making
a game 3d doesn't make it any better generally, but you try telling that
to everyone else. I still have my c64...and I see how far that could be
pushed...but there's a limit....and we've reached that on the amiga. All
the tricks have been learnt, and most of them you can't use anymore as
everything needs to be fairly os compliant. And they were pushing that
to the limit before....and were still using the exact same hardware. It's
not sloppy programming....it's just that most of the tricks are impossible
these days...and for the things most ppl are trying to do, wouldn't work.

Dave

From: "Alastair Murray" <malcolm.murray@virgin.net>
Date: 30 Jun 98 16:26:38 +0100
Subject: New User

I've had blitz for quite some time but never used it much because I
didn't really like it. It seemed to crash too much and most programs
made with it were unreliable too.... plus the fact that the manual is
appaling....

However, I've decided to give it a proper go now and am willing to be
converted to it. Firstly though I have a few questions that I hope
someone can help me with.

1. I don't seem to be able to open a Hires Laced 256 colour screen
(not intuition, for a game in blitz mode). Can this not be done?

2. What is the best version of TED and where can I get it? Most of
them seem to crash all the time (including the SuperTED on AMINET).
The one I'm using now is OK but a bit unfriendly. For example, AMIGA+I
is not used for insert line.

3. Is there no clipping supported in the BBlit commands? If so, then
what would someone reccomend to make a full scrolling game? Please
don't say the "make a screen twice the size of the display" option
because I don't really have the memory for that and besides, there
should certainly be better options than that. If there is just a way
of clipping BBlit then I would be fine from there on.

4. Extensions. I don't have anything except what came in the box of
Blitz 2.1 Is there any updates? Where can I get them?

Thanks,
-Murray

The manual has a clipping version for normal Blit but not for QBlit or
BBlit. It says that it will be intorduced soon though. Is there some
update to this?

Hi,

    I`ve been trying to archive some files then decrunch them
    in my program.
    I`ve been testing the implode and deplode commands that
    came with blitz, they seem quick but doesn`t reduce the
    file size very much , I had one mod which was reduced
    from 680,000 to 640,000 .
    Anyone know anything better, I can`t use lha (I think)
    because I want to unarchive the file into a Blitz `Bank`
    unarchiving to Ram: is no good because then my program
    still needs to load it from ram: which would mean two
    copys in mem and the mods are quite big.
    Currently I do this:

     - Get needed size of bank from file header.
     - init bank of right size
     - loadbank 0, imploded file
     - deplode bank(0)
     - decodemodule Bank(0)   , doesn`t allocate more mem( I think)

     Basically I want to unlha directly into a bank.

thanks for any help

Dave

I wasn`t aware of any PPC Blitz. From what I have gathered development of
Blitz has ground to a halt as only 1 member of RWE wants to work on it.

with regards to Roger Beausoleil's inquiries into Pheonix, the proposed
PPC version  of Blitz, I would like to ask our little community whether
or not they think that Amiga Inc's announcement about OS4>OS5 puts the
viability of PPC into question.
	I am in two minds, I think it is ridiculous that the way that
all of Phase5 et al's time and commitment has been thrown into doubt by
the promise of a new system. Surely now all the developers will not
bother with PPC, and we will go without high-end software for another
18months.
	However, does the promise of OS5 deliver more possibilities than
PPC? Surely the PPC's performance would be incredibly limited by having
to run through existing Amiga machines? (32bit bus etc) Would it be
worth getting a Pheonix development team to invest in OS4 development?

Hi all!

And here again some questions....

1) Smooth scrolling of shapes: I can smooth scroll little shapes. But if I
take
    bigger ones on a bitmap with depth 8 it isn`t smooth ;( Is it possible to
     scroll a ca. 200x100 shape smoothly on a 256 color bitmap. If yes,
     how to do it. BTW: I`m always using doublebuffer

2) Writing hex in files: If I want to write the hex string "4E4F" to file 0
     I`m using Mki$. If I want to write the hex string "4E4F4E4F" to file 0
    I`m using Mkl$. And what to use if I only want to write the hex string
     "4E" to filr 0? There`s no command for it but I`m really needing it. 
   Please help.....

3) I still need a crossfade routine for 2 256 colors pics. For example:
    I want to crossfade bitmap 1 (320x256x8) with bitmap 2 (320x256x8)
   Possible or not?
  
4) And again decode pictures from FastRam. It really doesn`t work...
     I tried some things with LoadBank, AllocMem etc. Can anyone
    send me a src which loads an IFF PIC to fast mem and decodes
    it to chip then to a bitmap. Please!

By crossfade do you mean that the pixels from the first picture are randomly
removed and replaced by the pixels in the second picture?

You can do this by using a point & plot method to read the pixels from the
second pic and send these to the first pic's bitmap.  You would want to set up
some sort of random table first to select which pixel is transferred.

I put a simple example of this in dev/basic.  But that one just randomly
selects the pixels in real-time, for better results you would want to
pre-store these in an array or list.

If the palettes are different, you would need to do a palette fade at the same
time.

There /are/ limits. You could try to have a smaller display. There is
quite a lot of blitter time difference between a 256 and a 200 height
screen.

What CPU do you have? You could try a cpu-based blit routine perhaps.

I and others were chatting about this on the blitz list the other day.
You might have to do a conversion to a HSV colourmodel instead of RGB
in order to properly fade the colours. The effect is essentially to do
a spread, a range of colours, for EVERY pixel, from the source colour
to the destination colour. Then, you'd need to devise a suitable
palette. Having the same palette in both pics would help.

If you can forego the 256-colour limit and have a situation where the
TOTAL number of bitplanes is no more than 8, there is a very simple
and quick palette fade you could use, but again generating the
inbetween colours is a bit tricky.

I think he was wanting a colour fade. But regarding dissolves, if you
want an ordered dissolve you can simple have an `add' value. You'd
treat all the pixels in the bitmap as offsets. Line 0 would be 0..319
and line 1 would be 320..639, etc... You start with a given pixel, any
one of them. You do the pixel copy. Then you add the `add' value to
the pixel number. If the add value exceeds the last pixel in the
screen, you subtract the total number of pixels from the pixel number,
to wrap around to the top again. This wrapping is important. You have
to select odd numers for your add value AFAIR, and you can experiment
with different numbers. Some wont work, some will. But basically if
you choose a number like, say, 6743, it will likely dissole in every
pixel in the screen. It will have a certain appearance. You will get a
different appearance with different values.

Furthermore, if you have a bitplane free, use it as a `mask in or out'
bitplane. Make the lower half of the palette black and the upper half
the colours you want. Do the ordered dissolve on the bitplane to
dissolve up or down a bitmap from/to black or another colour. You can
also do small chunks, like say divide the height into 8 or 10 or 20
even. Do a dissolve only with that height (like 16 lines), and use a
copy routine to repeat the pattern down the screen.

Anyway...

First up, allocate sufficient memory in FastRAM to hold the IFF file you are
loading. The easiest way is to use Initbank to initialise a bank in FastRAM
(press HELP to see the number for FastRAM, I think it's 2) and use "BLoad"
to load the file into the beginning of the bank (adress found using Bank
command). The BLoad command is in the RIAmosFunc library, which is available
free from the RWE website or is part of B.S.Suite. Create a bitmap as normal
with all the correct width/height/bitplane values. Then use the "GrabILBM"
command (see above for availability) to grab the bitmap and palette. This
command also needs an adress input parameter, which is the "Bank" command
again.

eg. To load a bitmap into FastRAM (untested! warning...)

Initbank 1,Filesize("Test.IFF"),2
Bitmap 0,320,256,4
BLoad "Test.IFF",Bank(1)
GrabILBM 0,1,Bank(1) ; 2nd parameter is the destination palette

Check the syntax, I just made it up!

You might want to look at my example I attached here.  I just tried it with a
128x128x128 shape and it takes about 2-3 sec  on my NTSC 030/50.

But you may be able to speed this up, I am doing a lot of error checking that
you might not need.

Also it has a progress bar that will slow things down I think.

I've a little question: I would like to use 256 coloured photos as a
window backdrop. I know that I can remap loaded bitmap to current
pallette (BDGFX lib) but the problem is placed in other place.
Colours 0-19 are locked - so I can't change them. The rest of colour
register could be changed but the current pallette don't contains any
data so I've to create new "current" pallette. I've to scan bitmap and
set correct values for colour registers 20-255. It isn't very difficult
I think BUT I also want to remap these 256 coloured bitmap to the
window with depth 4,5,6 instead 8.
Has anybody ready code to do this or have I do it myself?

One more question: I was using BDGFX lib to load 128x128x8 shape and
remap it to the 256 color screen palette but it takes A LOT of time.
This is only 16384 points - it's possible to do it a bit faster (about
one second on 030/50)?

into hardware limitations.  No matter what hardware spech you develope fo=

e as
possible or just mucking things together and letting it go.  Also, 'press=
ing
the limits' may mean different things to different people depending on th=
eir
abbilities, knowledge, time restraints, and coding system used.  I, for
instance, used to hardwire code on bread-boards (the original machine
language) back in the late '60s and early '70s.  Cobal and Pascale were r=

steps up.  They were considered wastefull of machine resources and a 'laz=

the first hard drives and marvoling over them.  They were units about 1-1=

meters high with a nearly 1/2 meter diameter disk which looked like a hug=
e,
shiney flywheel thick in the center and thinner at the edge.  I believe t=
hey
held a megabyte or two and I saw them at a government project.
  I've been through enough stuff now that I believe it's high time for a
programming system where cool and spectacular things are made easily
accessable, such as Blitz was aspiring to be.  Blitz needs upgrading in
a number of ways to be where it once was, kinda like the Amiga hardware.
I disagree catagorically with the idea of layering to much O.S. stuff
between the the hardware and the applications as a manditory fundimental
(which is kinda what I think you are getting at) but I agree that it is
necessisary to have hardware abstraction layers in place to be used for
grunt-work type stuff where the ability to do mundane everyday jobs at
a reasonable cost in money and labor are the main considerations.  But
the system shouldn't FORCE the coder to go thru the abstraction layers
if they want to push the limits of the hardware.  If the coders want to
make really cool stuff that only runs on one model but does things that
are otherwise impossible, then they should be allowed to do that.
If they want to make software where they have gon to the extra work of
making several versions optimized to different hardware so as to allow
more powerful results, then they should be able to do that also.  The
O.S. should be flexible enough to allow for bypassing parts or all of
it, protecting only the memory locations necessary to preserve other
programs in progress.  The kernel should also allow for direct access
totally eliminating the O.S. and only single-tasking one piece of
software for the purpose of devoting all resources to that application.
This would of course be used mainly for games and dedicated systems
that run only a single task.  But it would drastically increase system
performance for the single tast being run, and should of course be
easily switchable to normal O.S. functioning if needed.
  In other words, I believe the state of the art has reached the point
where the is no excuse for both the coder and the end user to not be
able to 'have their cake and eat it too'.  No stuffy Mac or wintel
'do things our way or forget it' mentality.  Let's get back to 'the
customer is always right'.  And those of you who are programing for
commercial markets, keep this in mind also.  People are getting sick
of software dictating to them.  They don't want what YOU want.  They
want what THEY want.  Give them what they want and you will make sell
more copys and have many more repeat customers.  However, if you want
what YOU want badly enough and it is different from the main-stream
and you believe it will be worth your while (either because you
believe the market for it will be big enough or because you don't
care if you make any money but you just want to do things so they
please you) then go for it.  Try share-ware or free-ware, or just
do it and have fun.  There is often a suprising interest in some
pretty off-beat things.  And if you are just doing it for yourself
it doesn't matter anyway.  But those who are trying to make a
commercial success of their creations are going to find more and
more that making software flexible and configurable so that the
user can suit themselves it becoming more and more of a necessity.

  Besides, I think it's fun to try and meet the challenge of trying
to make software which pleases a wide variety of people.  Taking
a narrow view is to simple to be interesting to me.  bill gates
can have a corner on that (shrinking) market if he wants it.


  Oh, boy!  And you guys thought YOU were ranting!  And how did
bill gates get his ugly face into this anyway???

I think SuperTed 2.52 is the highest it got to (2.5 is installed with BSS),
you can get the upgrade from 2.5 > 2.52 from the RWE website. When I
installed BSS it seemed to put in some new libs, which I think are quite
uptodate. I`m sure someone else on the list will have more info on this.  ;)

I am not sure why I am still getting BlitzList e-mail, but anyhow the direct answer is probably
"no", although I am sure some things will appear over time. 

The original RWE team has "broken up". Basically, the time constraints on full-time jobs
and Blitz development proved too much. RWE LTD the company continues, and I am sure we
will all work together from time to time.

I am now the only member of the original team that is still working with the company.

The Amiga web-site will remain at:

	http://www.ldngedge.demon.co.uk/

and the RWE PC site is at

	http://www.bug-face.demon.co.uk/rwe/index.html

I know you are all Amiga fans, but if you are role-players as well, you will find Familiar
interesting!

Basically, we are all still about doing "things", but directed Blitz (and Amiga) effort by RWE has stalled
for the time being.

If you want to use a window, you can use the Bimaptowindow command, which
has everything you need. It works with grafixcards (unlike ShowBitmap!), but
is very slow.
You can use a screen which is bigger then the visible part of the
screenmode, and move it around.

Hi blitzers!

I have a very big problem:
I finally got the CPU blitting routines I was looking 4 (by Dave Newton).
Now, there is no CPUClipBlit command. The only solution to get
round this that I know of is to make a bigger bitmap (256,256 pixels atm)
and somehow position it at coords 128,128. i.e. The bitmap is not
starting with 0,0 but with 128,128. Any ideas how to perform this?
I am using a screen in Amiga mode and display the bitmap

Subject: Scroll

I'm having trouble with BlockScroll command. Replacing it with the
Scroll command works (although being slower) which makes it sound as
though it is because the values are not divisable by 16 but I've
checked and checked again and they definetly are.

This is the line:

Scroll 160,160,320,320-32,160,160+32

Its used to scroll a 640x576 bitmap around. That one is to scroll it
up. Similar commands to scroll right and down work fine but scroliing
left doesn't work either.

What happens is it seems to copy one horizontal line of 32x32 blocks
right down across the screen.

Any ideas of what could be wrong?

Also, are there any new commands that have been added to any of blitz
librarys I should know about. I've got a new version of acidlibs file
which is 60k larger but I don't know what it does extra. Any chance
that it has the BBlit clipping commands I'd like?

Thanks,

Hey Blitz peoples, a rather simple (and probably easily answered) question for
you all....

How do I find out what 3 fonts have been set in Workbench prefs ? I need to
know both the font type and size so I can incorporate them into windows that
will be displayed on Workbench.

Also how does one determine the width of the fonts from the above question, or
for that matter, the width of any fonts ?

P.S Despite lengthy help from Curt, I haven't been able to get the

If you use a non-proportional font it shouldn't be a problem, should it?!
For proportional fonts use the textlen_ OS-function.

Yes, this will always give a steady 25fps (30 fps in NTSC) unless your main
loop code is taking LONGER than 2 Vblanks to execute.  If that happens, you
will see a slowdown.

A Tick is simply 1 Vblank - ResetTimer sets the count to 0, then Ticks returns
the number of Vblanks that have passed since you reset.  So a "Tick" is 1/50
sec in PAL, or 1/60 in NTSC.

Sorry, I don't have any example for this - I did both my games to execute in
<1 vblank.  (They're simple...)

But just try inserting the code as shown and judge for yourself.

The code above simply checks how long your main loop took, and makes sure that
each frame takes at least 2 vblanks, regardless of processor speed or how many
objects you are handling at any time.  It is up to you to insure that your
code always completes the loop in less than 2 Vblanks.

The other suggestion is better, (inserting more graphics for faster machines,
etc.) - but this will get you started.

Sorry to muddle the waters again, but it IS ALWAYS possible to force your
program to SLOW DOWN to 25 fps, or any delay you like.

I tried adding that code I posted before to my game (which runs at 60 fps on
NTSC) and I can slow it down to any VBlank speed I like (pointless, of course,
but it does work)

What is NOT possible is to force your program to run faster than your main
loop allows.  In other words, if you main loop sometimes takes longer than 2
VBlanks (25 fps) to execute, you can't get a smooth 25 fps from it.

The only solution to that would be to find a way to speed up your main loop.

 If it always takes less than 2 Vblanks to execute, it doesn't matter exactly
how long it takes, you should get a constant 25fps using my example.

You can't guarantee 25fps in your game unless you use some very good, fast
optimised code.

In throey your game should run at 50fps, that's the fastest the Amiga can go I
think. Right, if you just do a main loop and note the fps it'll be 50fps,
cause you're not doing anything, just looping around.

Now if you start puttin gthings in your loop, in your case for your game,
it'll start going into subroutines before it can finish the loop. Subroutines
like blitting graphics, moving the display, artificial intelligence, that sort
of thing.

    #Reset Timer#

    #While KeyCode#<>117 ; Wait for ESC key to be hit.

     #VWait#
    
     #If Timer#>49
        fps.q=framecount/1.0
        framecount=0
        #Reset Timer#
     #End if # 

     framecount+1
    #Wend#

This will give you 50fps, no greater, cause you're not doing anything in the
loop. Now if we do an example of a game loop :

    #Reset Timer#

    #While KeyCode#<>117 ; Wait for ESC key to be hit.
    
    #VWait#

     #If Timer#>49
        fps.q=framecount/1.0
        framecount=0
        #Reset Timer#
     #End if # 

     #Gosub# check_inputs
     #Gosub# render_background
     #Gosub# ai_routines
     #Gosub# render_objects 
     
     #ShowBitmap# db : db=1-db

     framecount+1
    #Wend#

In the above loop, before the framecount can be added with one, more ticks are
going to happen because you're going into four subroutines, which will of
course take some valuable ticks up. Now when the ticks are equal to 50 the
number of frame counts counted won't be as high as when you're doing nothing,
therefore a lower frame rate will appear. If you've got processor specific
routines they faster your processor will process them, therefore less time to
do the four routines and give you a higher frame rate.

You can't force a program to have 25fps if it's taking less than 25 frames a
second  to do your entire loop.

If you knew all this, I'm sorry but I thought you where in a bit a muddle with
all this 25fps stuff. :)

Send an email to blitz-list-request@netsoc.ucd.ie with unsubscribe
in the subject. Do the same for your new account but with subscribe
in the subject field.
When I subscribe to a list I always keep the intro message from the
list and also make a note of how to subscribe/unsubscribe with the
address details in my email address book. This is really easy and 
saves me having to ask how to subscribe/unsubscribe from a list
everytime I need to. I mention this tip as the amount of times

Subject: Variable Corruption


OK I know this is kind of vague and I've still got some investigating to do,
but has anyone seen anything like this?

I've a simple word variable typ which is assigned once in my program as zero
and then used in a Select Case structure in a subroutine like this:
Select tdat(typ,1) etc. tdat() is an array tdat(7,1). Problem is, the third
time this subroutine gets called, the program stops with array subscript
out of range. As far as I can tell typ should still be zero, so this error
shouldn't occur. Unfortunately, my program uses Format to set the print format
and this seems to affect the debugger's EVAL which tells me typ has the
value "        1 0~0". I added the line

if typ<0 or typ>7 then print typ:stop 

before the select tdat(typ,1) and the program stops after printing 1.

So is typ 1 or what? Print seems to think it is, but the conditional tests 
and array access seem to think its something else. How come?

Haven't had time to comment out various routines to try and find out when
typ gets corrupted (or whatever), which I will, but just wondered if this
was familiar to anyone. Not another 030 quirk?
