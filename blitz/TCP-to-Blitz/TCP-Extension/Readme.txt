TCP-to-Blitz V1.1
-----------------

FreeWare
~~~~~~~~

This program is freeware so you are not obliged to give me anything
for its use. However if you use it and you happen to have written
some good programs with it I would be gratefull if you can send me
a copy of them or inform me about their existence and from where I
can get a copy of them.


Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Up to now people who wanted to create AmiTCP applications had
to resort to programming in the C language. This was really a
pity when one considers the number of languages available for
programming on the Amiga. Besides it limited the number of people
who could create TCP applications for the Amiga which everyone
would benefit from. Despite the fact that I usually program in
machine language, I have always admired programming languages like 
Blitz Basic and Amos since they allow beginners to create astonishing
programs.

As blitz Basic is one of my favourite languages I decided to make
a SDK of AmiTCP for Blitz. Another one for Amos will shortly follow
which will feature more easy TCP programming.

Together with the extension I have included some example programs
which though very crude and incomplete give a starting example.

I have converted all AmiTCP socket.library commands, so there is no
limit to the applications you can create with this extension.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the extension copy the file bsdsocket.library1 to the
Blitz2:blitzlibs/amigalibs drawer and run the makedeflibs.bb program
to incorporate the commands in Blitz basic.


Updates from previous versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed some bugs in the IRC and Hostname Examples.

- Added a new example showing the basics to create a daemon server.
