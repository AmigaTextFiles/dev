                          Blitz Mailing List Guide
                          ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@netsoc.ucd.ie>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@netsoc.ucd.ie>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@host.domain", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@acc.umu.se or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

One thing you should take into account is that most Amigans today, at least
the ones I talk to and so forth doesn't like to have the OS being taken
over, in this case the so called 'Blitz-mode'. I do belive that this is a
general idea amung the Amigans today, with exceptions.

It also depends on what machine you're aiming for, most amigans today are
blessed with at least some Fastram and a commonly used 030 (especially the
A1200).  And remember, AGA can be VERY slow when you start using it, but if
you know the hardware tricks and are aiming for higher specs Amigas, then
you might wanna give standard AGA a go.

;--
If you're going for Blitz Basic in conjunction with OS-friendly programming,
what I can suggest is using Mildred which is a chunky-mode system for
Blitz, a quite easyhandled thing too.
It does support both AGA and RTG screenmodes and holds the normal
Blitz-gfxroutines + a lot of nice other features and will get you started
in a second.

Just check it out and ask if you need any help with it.

Subject: @{b}Amiga/ Blitz MUGEN@{ub}

Hello again everyone,

I have just seen the "Crap Fighter" engine that I was asking about (thanks to
the person who sent it) Wow! It has convinced me that with a little effort
Blitz could quite easily produce a top quality Beat-Em-Up.

I would just like to ask if anyone would like to help me with a new project
that I have been planning for ages. Amiga MUGEN. MUGEN, as some of you may
already know is a 2-D fighting game engine for the PC. It allows you to create your own
charaters and backgrounds/ moves etc... and put them all together in a very
professional looking game (Capcom style). Am I wrong in believing that the Amiga
could pull a similar thing off seeing as it specializes in 2-D graphics, unlike
PC's?

If anyone at all is interested or can offer me their sevices then let me know,
I already have a very detailed plan of how it would work so it just needs to
be put into motion. I really need some good coders to work on the different
sections of the program (which is why I joined this list. I'm very impressed!  ;)
So please, like I said let me know what you all think.

Thanks for everyone's time,
I look forward to hearing your views.

(0h, and BTW I have included a screen shot of PC MUGEN to show you
what we would be aiming for.)

Jason.

Before I start, I think it's possible, but it might be tricky.

If you are going to make it a blitz mode game (i.e. hardware banging), apart 
from annoying everyone with a graphics card (and sound card, and not being able 
to use pretty much any other piece of hardware during the fight sequences), you 
are going to be limited to using chipram, which isn't the fastest in the world. 
And if you need a 256 colour screenmode...

You won't be able to use dual playfields (unless you can somehow make the 
graphics work in 32 colours). This leaves you with the choice of using sprites 
for the foreground stuff (fast, but limited colours and sizes, unless you use 
some fancy tricks) or blits (slow, can use full colours, again can be optimised 
with some tricks).

If you choose to use the OS, so you can support all this nice hardware, you get 
a different set of problems. Do you stick with planar graphics or use chunky? 
Maybe do both, one for high end systems and one for low end. You wouldn't be 
able to use any hardware tricks, unless you made an AGA only version. And would 
you use CPU blitting (either direct into chipram, into fastmem [and copy to 
chip of gfx card memory]) or would you rely on graphics/cybergraphics libraries 
so you can use the hardware blitter of whatever display device is in use?

I'm not an expert, these are just general observations. And I'm sure there are 
people here who could tell you to ignore some of the options, because they're 
either overkill for this kind of project, or are just too damned awkward.

The only thing I can help you with  really would be the coding behind the health bar - the rest is  litte beyond me! I developed (years before Nokia!) a snake type game and used a decreasing bar across the top of the screen as a timer. 
   Although this is probably wht you don't want to hear and has been implied in an earlier post - you need to scale down your rather ambitious plans as without a lot of ppl helping you with it it will take a very long time to get it to the way you want it too. I suggest leaving the AI till last and just getting a 2-player beta up and running for bug testing.

Have you got anyone in mind yet for the graphics or music?

Subject: @{b}Re: Amiga/ Blitz MUGEN@{ub}

O.k. thanks for your opinions. 

Firstly, someone asked who would be doing the graphics/ music etc.. Well I am
planning to do the graphics myself but am open to help with anything if you
are interested. Unfortunetly, I not an advanced coder and thats why I'm asking
for some help, but believe me if it's graphics your after I'm your man. Next, I totally agree,      
an OS friendly version would be the way to go, however wouldn't this kill the
speed some what? If anyone could send me a sample of what Mildred is capable
of then please do. But really I would like a silky smooth frame rate, is this
still possible with Mildred and chunky graphics modes?

This is how I was originally going to tackle the main engine,

* A 256 colour (debatable) Blitz mode display/ single playfield
    maybe with extra background layers if speed permits. 

* Main charaters would be 15 colour sprites which would take 2 sprite channels
    I believe and a futher two to make them 128 pixels wide if need be (huge
    charaters) these could be any height as I think that sprites allow this (?).
    So this means that both charaters would use 4 channels each using up all
    available sprite channels (Sprite mode 2). Am I right in thinking that this would work?
    Would this give us a good frame update as we are not blitting anything
    yet.

* Next I planned to have projectiles etc... drawen by blitting, as they would
    not be to big and should not take away much speed. Maybe foreground
    objects can be added this way to? Or the energy bars etc...

* The floor would scroll with perspective as seen in the Crap Fighter demo
    using the Display scroll command.

Does all this sound feasible? And would I be able to pull of the same sort of
thing with Mildred? Also does Mildred support transparency? Maybe some neat
effects could be added this way. And finally would anybody be wiling to run up
a quick test version of the above to see how things could look. I would be
most greatful.    

Best regards and thanks for your interest in the project,
Jason.

Subject: @{b}RE:Re: Amiga/ Blitz MUGEN@{ub}

All this talk of fps reminds me of Quake coding discussions. The fps rate depends on two things:-

How long the computer takes to do the instructions you tell it to between frames - also whether (and this is sometimes essential unless you want a very high fram rate) you synchronise it with the refresh rate of the screen. I think that's something like Wait Vbl - however I also user AMOS so check it out first wby pressig help on the keyword to get the syntax for the Wait command.

There are programs available that automatically write music for games - you just decide on the instruments used. The author says you can use the modules that the program makes for anything you want to. However I'm sure there are plenty of ppl on this list who can tell you how to write  basic tune in Octamed Soundstudio too. If you have a MIDI interface and a MIDI keyboard you can play the music you want in your game.

Hi Jason

I think 040/25 (but they suck anyway, 030/50's are effectively faster :) 
gets you 25fps on AGA. If you were to use Mildred with a graphics card, 
you'd probably get 50fps, as you won't need to do the chunky to planar 
conversion.

> * A 256 colour (debatable) Blitz mode display/ single playfield

You'd struggle with the extra background layers I think, since you'd 
probably need to have the most background layer as a bitmap and then blit 
the layers in front of that.

Correct about all the sprite stuff. Yes, it would still run at full speed.

> thing with Mildred? Also does Mildred support transparency? Maybe some neat

Yes, sounds feasible apart from the background layers thing. For an example 
of most of this stuff with Mildred, have a look on the Mildred Support Site 
at http://www.stationone.demon.co.uk. There's an example of a Defender game 
(or is it Revenge of the mutatnt camels?) which does layers of parallax 
scrolling for the ground and clouds I believe, and obviously blits for the 
main ship/enemies/etc.

I don't think Mildred supports transparency, although with a 256 colour 
palette, you'd probably just be easier not doing real transparency, but 
having a section of palette for the shades. Or maybe even do the same as 
crap fighter, and have the shadows cross hatched.

This is a new beta(1.5) version of the audio player. The looks have changed,
internal array coding has changed, it has got a new glow icon ;-) And more
internal stuff. The final version will be out in a month or so.

If you want try it out. You know where to send any comments.

Can anyone help here.

I've attached a code fragment.   You will see two STOP commands with
comments attached to each.    Basically, If you stop within the
statement, the value is correct.   If you stop outside the statement
the value is wrong.    Please DO NOT run this program until you are
willing to have your system crash.

I'm sure it's just my misuse of the syntax somehow.

With a newtype containing a pointer variable, how do you reference
sub-variables within the pointers newtype?

Help would be greatly appreciated

Thanks

Tony

Hi Tony

> Can anyone help here.

I have this trouble all the time. I think the problem comes from the first 
statement where you are storing the string in your newtype. It seems as when 
you assign a string which is local (in this case Text$) to the string in your 
newtype, it allocates the string memory from the local variable space, which 
obviously gets lost (or should I say, can be overwritten) when you exit the 
function.

You can check this, inside the function when it stops, assign the string and 
then look at the newtype in the memory window to check the address. Run on to 
the second stop check the address in the memory window again. It should be the 
same, but now it just points to crap :(

I'm not sure of the best way around this, as I was able to simply use a single 
shared variable and left it at that. Obviously you're not able to do this.

Perhaps this is a bug in the Blitz string variable routines. You could try 
using a command which returns a string to see if you can get it to force it to 
allocate global memory. Something like:

*MCR\Headings\Column[0]\String = String$(Text$, 1)

Maybe?

Perhaps, allocatd your own piece of memory for the string, and let the newtype
point at that?

Thank goodness for that.  I thought I was simply going dotty on my old

I can't do that.   Maybe I could pass the address of the string to the
routine.   People would have to do a$ = "Some Text" then
ReportColumn{&a$...
but I guess that's not too bad.

I'll give a few things a try and get back to you.

Thanks, David.   Also, thanks to Ralf for similar ideas.

Pagan doesn't have an auto-responder, I'm guessing it's something Peter has
set up on a private machine. I remember the last time this happened though,
at least it's not sending auto-responses to it's auto-responses. Last time
that happened there was 5Mb of e-mail to download.

Strange, when did you subscribe? It has been quiet, but there has been a
few messages recently (has there?). I've copied this message to you in

The problem with BlitzGtFix is ... I always give new look

*EX.ExtGadget = GtGadPtr(#GadList, #GadNbr)
*PropI.PropInfo = *Ext\SpecialInfo
*PropI\Flags = *PropI\Flags | #PROPNEWLOOK
And it works with the old AcidLibs (that I've carefully 
backup before patching). But not with the new one ! Why ?

Prop gadgets are the ones with a slider? Or is it a slider and arrows. You

It could be a similar problem to the one with GTListviews and GTPalettes 
(GTGadPtr and other functions which used the same code didn't work).

Hi,

Right, I found the bug, just need to wait till I get home so I can fix it 
(I don't have the latest source here). It might be a bit of a pain to fix 
this.



For those interested in the problem:

(Background)
With OS2, complex gadgets such as sliders, listviews, etc could be created 
which are actually made up of a number of single gadgets. OS2 
gadtools.library allocated different gadget ID's for each component of the 
complex gadgets, which is why you should start your ID's from a number such 
as 51 when coding for OS2+ in Blitz. Finding the correct part of a gadget 
was simple in the Blitz library, as only one gadget in the list (the actual 
master gadget I think) has the desired ID.

(Main part)
In OS3+, these complex gadgets now only use a single gadget ID for all 
their parts. While nice for normal programmers who can keep a pointer to 
the actual gadget created, doing this in a Blitz library would be difficult 
and probably quite pointless. It does mean now that when searching the 
gadget list you can find multiple gadgets (when using GTGadPtr) although, 
since the function can only return one value, we need to decide which 
pointer to return. The default behaviour in the Acid version of the library 
was to search for the last item in the list which had a matching ID and 
return a pointer to that. While this worked for some gadgets, the 
GTListviews and GTPalettes were broken. When I fixed this problem, I made 
it return the pointer to the first gadget with the matching ID. However, 
this then broke the prop gadgets which require you to return the pointer to 
the last gadget with a matching ID.

You can check which one you have by typing "GTList" into Blitz 2 and

Hello David

Sorry, I think it's going to get boring, but, ...
the new fix brings a new bug !

You can't use GTBevelBox from now. "GTList not attached to window". With old acidlibs and your previous acidlibs (previous fixes), GTBevelBox works fine.
For the prop gadgets fix, you'd got a great idea. The new GTNewLookProp command is simply easier and more powerful. Thank's a lot.

Doh!

I changed this on purpose to make it work better, obviously it didn't work.

The problem is (that I've always found) if you try to use GTBevelBox 
without attaching the GTList to a window, it crashes (because the pointer 
to the window and screen visualinfo are NULL). I added this check with the 
debugger turned on so that would not happen. Looks like nothing will happen 
though :(

I'll fix that soon.

It's fixed now, I was checking the wrong address register in the debugger

Just keep sending the bug reports, it gives me something to do :) Sorry for

Sorry, why ? We all know programming and debugging is a

I meant about the debugger problem with the GTBevelBox command, because you 
wouldn't believe how simple a mistake it was and how little I checked that

Hello David

> What kind of programs is it you are working on?

Well last year, before getting a new job and an iMac, I had some time to write something in Blitz, and started working on an account manager because every good one is shareware. I'm using it for my own, and every time someone looked at it or decided to use it, they simply told me to sell this prog. I'm a professional programmer, and I'm writing a lot of other progs for different computers (IBM AS400, Macintosh, and even PC ...). I don't want to loose time trying to sell something to the small Amiga community. Since everything is at least shareware now, you must buy a lot of progs, and it finally is ... very expensive. No I don't want that. So my account manager will be freeware, and my Disk/Book/Tape/Video manager too. 
I'm at home every week-end (and there I work on my Mac with RealBasic),  but the other days I'm in a small room, not far from my job. One month ago, I brought my A1200 there, and the pleasure of working on this good all machine is still here. So I'm coding again with blitz, but it's not easy. To write tools, and os friendly programs, you need a lot of work, there are bugs everywhere (sure you know about it, what's the name ... blitzgtfix I think). And localisation is a long and hard work (actually everything is in french, but I'm working on it). Since most of the problems have been fixed, let's write more routines ...

Well, I don't know if the author or the list would appreciate that, but it
is on Aminet: cx23.lha.  The source is in the Quelltext directory (and

OK, I got that, but you should have read the comments at the top ;) I don't 
speak German, but I managed to figure out that he got his idea from 
CXCommander (also on aminet, source in C and English) :)

Anyway, the important part is that both programs use private functions of 
commodities.library. Here's the important snippage:

/*** private functions of "commodities.library" ***/

#pragma libcall CxBase FindBroker 6c 801
#pragma libcall CxBase CopyBrokerList ba 801
#pragma libcall CxBase FreeBrokerList c0 801
#pragma libcall CxBase BrokerCommand c6 802

CxObj *FindBroker(char *);
LONG CopyBrokerList(struct List *);
LONG FreeBrokerList(struct List *);
LONG BrokerCommand(char *, LONG id);

The first number in the #pragma lines is the library offset. The second is 
the parameters. 802 is (a0,d0) in an FD file (parameters in that order) and 
801 is (a0). It's probably easiest to stick these private functions into 
your FD file for commodities.library and then fdconvert them.

Hi amorel

Not using the hardware as it is. Maybe if you wrote your own insane-o huge 
copperlist or something, but the dual playfields are limited to 16 colours 
because AGA displays can only handle 8 bitplanes. So when you go to 2 
playfields, it gives half the bitplanes to each playfield, resulting in 4 
playfields each and therefore 16 colours. I'm not sure how well poking around 
in the copperlist changing colours would work either.

You can change the distribution of the playfields. For example playfield 1 has 
32 colours (5 bitplanes) and playfield 2 has 8 colours (3 bitplanes), and so on.

As for more than 2 playfields, you could use hardware sprites. You can put 
sprites in between playefields and in fornt and behind them, so you could end 
up with a display with 5 playfields. I think you could even stick more sprites 
in between them too. But then you'd need something like multiplexed or 
tesselated (that the right word? Sami and Teemu [hope I got the name right] 
were speaking about this a while ago) sprites, to fill the full width of the 
display.

I'm sure a demo coder would be able to tell you properly if you know one :)

After having a look at the hardware RKRM, this looks like the only way sprites 
work. You can specify where the odd and even sprites (normally 4 colours) take 
their 16 colours from separately (i.e. sprites 0,2,4,6 use colours 16-31 and 
sprites 1,3,5,7 use colours 240-255), although if you create sprites of 16 
colours, I think they can only come from one place in the palette (which is 
where the odd numbered sprites get their colours from).

I don't know how to set sprites up so they are 16 colour sprites and have their 
own palette each. Sorry.

I was going to suggest this, but I thought it would be too much pain for little 
gain. I suppose it would be OK if you could copy a whole bitmap over the other 
quickly enough(!!) because that would be the only real way to do it in software 
:(

I think. You could of course start the copy using the blitter, and then use the 
CPU to do some other processing at the same time).

Does anyone know how to use file notification with blitz?

I'm working on an mp3 player that uses the MAS-Player hardware.

Dirk Conrad has written a cli based player that I'm interfacing with, which
writes it's status to a file in ENV:

If I can find a way to find if the file has been changed (without having to
load it every second or so), I can setup things like automaticaly playing the 
next mp3 when the current one finishes.

If anyone is interested a recent version is on my website, it can also be used
to create playlists for AmigaAmp, just copy it into your AmigaAMP drawer.

For automatic loading call your playlist AmigaAMP.pls

Yep. :)  

Here's a general overview of how I did it, let me know if you need more
details.

First you need a message port set up.  Once you have that, do something
like this:
    
   deftype .NotifyRequest nreq

   nreq\nr_Name = fname.s              ; file to watch
   nreq\nr_Flags = #NRF_SEND_MESSAGE   ; notify us with a message
   nreq\nr_Stuff\nr_Msg\nr_Port = *msgport ; use address of your msgport
   
   if StartNotify_(&nreq)<>0
     addresult = True   ; success!
     endnotify_(&nreq)
   Else
   ; failed!
   EndIf

This will set up the notify, (don't do the endnotify() until you want to
stop) once you've done that, you'll get a message on the message port when
the file changes.  I basically wait until GetMsg_ on the port returns
nonzero.


Hope this helps!

Works fine here. Obviously I had to modify some variable values though

Problems could be not enough memory to read the font list or something?

I should have mentioned that the variables are all defined elsewhere

Probably not, since the WinUAE set up has aonly a few fonts and oodles

Does anyone have a list of ALL the GTTags values, the list in the manual is crap,
I know there are more but I don't know where to find them.

Regards

Funnily enough I was doing this last week :) I think there might be something 
wrong with the way GTListview works, although the latest version of the gtlib 
works the same as the Acid one.

Anyway, you need to do this:

GTTags gtlist_id, gtlistview_id, #GTLV_ShowSelected, 0
GTListview <blah>

If you want, you can use GTGadPtr(gtlist_id, gtstring_id) instead of 0 in the 
GTTags call and it will also display the selected item in the string. Be warned 
that the string gadget must be the same width and possibly x position as the 
listview or it doesn't work.

what are u thinking to do ? I don't understand your prob... Do you mean
access pass protected web site (using http) or just a simple access to
another machine ?

   I've written some http code (check signature). you can find almost all
about http transaction in bb2 on the bb 2000 site. I recomend also to read
the book client programming with perl (you can find it on the net 4 free.
Read the first 2 chapter and you'll know enough about http)

Hi all...

   Recently I come across a little bug in math section... Maybe it's my

Check the following code...
.....................................


; why this is wrong ?

#range=32000

; if range is around 32.000 everything is fine...
; if more than 33.000 negative numbers start to appear...
; is there something wrong  ?

x1.l=#range

Repeat

a.l=Int(Rnd(#range))


If x1>a
   x1=a
   NPrint "min: ",x1
EndIf

If x2.l<a
  x2=a
  NPrint "max: ",x2
EndIf


Until end_of_world
...................................


if #range is bigger than 32.xxx I start to get errors... Does rnd

I'd say that the parameter for the Rnd command is a word, and so any
number bigger than 32767 will loop back round to -32768.

Subject: @{b}Moving the list@{ub}

There was some mention, the other day, of moving the list because of
the turn-round time for messages.

My son has his own web server, running a twin P500, which has an
average CPU queue length of around 0.01.    In other words, it is
bored silly.

I've talked to him about the possibility of hosting mailing lists and
he is considering getting MajorDomo to host lists on his machine.

Hosting the list would be free, but he would want to add a random
advert to the bottom of each outgoing e-mail.

If the general consensus is that we want to move, could one of the
moderators give me an e-mail privately and I'll forward james's
address to you.    If not, then we can stay here with no worries.

Any thoughts anyone??

It'd be possible to stay subbed to both lists and redirect people to the new

Agreed about the service, but I hate the turn around. Sometimes I find

As I recall (but the memory is going these days) the e-groups fiasco
was due to trying to have two lists, the beginners and the more
experienced.    

I take everyones point about the hassles of moving, so I'll drop the
subject now.   I personally don't have a problem with the response
time - I'm rarely on when anyone else is awake anyway :-(

If the list ever has to move, just remember the offer...

I don't like the idea of moving the list to a private server. I
don't know about your son, but my server is used for learning
UNIX system administration (to play with that is ) a.s.o.
It's rebooted once in a while, reinstalled and other weird

Yeah, something like that. The real problem was that everyone just ended up

Here you are adding 1 to the result of a function to give a string
result.

I don't know whether the function returns a string or a numeric, but
in either case you need to do something to sort out the types.

Probably stick a Ustr$(...) around the function and the +1 to convert
it all to a string.

I think :-)

You're mixing up string variables with numeric variables. You should do this:

PServer=#MUIGet#(#MUI_Cycle3,#MUIA_Cycle_Active)+1
suc.l=#SetToolValue#("Server",Ustr$(PServer))

Hopefully :)

The new local vet, Nick Knight, got into old Daisy up to their elbow.
Inside they found My Blitz Problem.

> But I dont realy know what I am doing.  Can anyone help me .  

Is that the entire code for your game? I hope not :)

But if it is, you might want to see if you can get any cheap/free books on
game techniques. Looking like you are just wanting to use Blitz mode,
you'd be safe enough getting an AMOS book on general game techniques
(although I think most might explain that as an introduction) as the
techniques will be the same, although the code will not. I say AMOS books
here, because I think there was only ever 1 written for Blitz :(

A couple of links you might want to have a look at instead of getting a
book are:

http://freespace.virgin.net/jason.hayman/BlitzCBL   (very good)
http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~fish/HTML/blitzman        (good, but not complete)

However, the basic steps you need to do are this:
    1) Load/create graphics, sound etc
    2) Create 2 (or more) bitmaps for display
    3) Create display
    4) Start of main loop.
    5) Display bitmap on screen and use a bitmap not being displayed
    6) Get input from user (joystick/keyboard/mouse)
    7) Update player positions
    8) Update non-player positions (e.g. the enemies)
    9) Check for collisions between player/bullets/enemies/scenery/etc
   10) Do whatever depending on the result of step 9 (e.g. remove enemy
       from screen, kill player, etc)
   11) Draw player/bullets/enemies to bitmap not being displayed
   12) Wait for display syncrhonisation
   13) Repeat main loop until end of game conditions have been met (e.g.
       player dies, all enemies killed, whatever)

I'd still recommend you go and look at BlitzCBL (from the link above).
Actually, ignore the thing about an AMOS book and my rantings and just go
straight to the BlitzCBL page. It will take your through each step and
give you code as you do it.

Hi all,

  I'm still trying to get a list of commodities that are running -- I've
managed to get all of the functions set up, but the function that
generates the list (CopyBrokerList) fails.  The only difference between my
code and the example C code I'm looking at is a NewList() function called
on the list structure -- so I'm wondering if anyone knows what this
function does so I can do it.  It appears to be part of amigalib in

Any thoughts?

released. It includes the support for sprites, joystick, keyboard, sound,

    The Amiga version and the PC version are almost compatiable (except some

    It will be good if you could test the compiler to see if it's 'bullet

    It's available on www.purebasic.com

I once did a dictionary/spellchecker for YAM actually for your information
:)

How it worked was it checked what word was pressed in YAM, extracted the
first letter of the word and opened the appropriate file and looked up the
spelling. I had one file for each letter in the alphabet, so getting a 'g'
as the first letter, I opened "g.dict" and searched for the word in
question.

So splitting the 4Mb file into smaller ones would be better, just take a
random number, each nr for a letter in the alphabet and open the
corresponding file.

Another idea might be to have an index in the beginning of each file that
has the offset in bytes where each letter is located and then you
automagically know how long the word is by using the next offset and can
jump to it very fast.

Why do you copy it to Ram in the first place? How long does the dictionary
remain in memory?
I would just open the file in question, do the search directly to it and
close it. But then again, it depends on the context.

Speaking about the undecifrable strings, that must be a flaw in your routine
;)

Cheers, Thor.

Subject: @{b}Searching a smart idea...@{ub}

Hi all, I've a question for you...

   I'm planning to make a routine wich simply show a word (a string not
numeric word format) taken randomly from a file.

The file is a simple dictionary where the words are written on each line.
Beetwen 2 words there's only the chr$(10).

es.

.......
abba
aca
ada
alien
amiga
blitzbasic
campus
wolfang
zirconium
zorro
.............

   Now I first copy the whole file in mem and then go to a random
position. Then I search the next chr$(10) and I took each chars till I
found another chr$(10).

   The system is quite easy and also really fast, however I came across
two problems. First is memory... My dictionary file is now 4mb (that have
to be copied in ram). The second is that sometimes blitz put out
undecifrable strings taken somewhere from the mem...

   So... Can anyone suggest me a more elegant way of extracting a random
word from a plain ascii file without copy it to ram ?

thx all

I don't make any claims on how well this works or how fast it is. It
shouldn't use too much memory though. Basically you calculate a random
start position and then work back until you find a newline character. Then
you read a line to give you a random line (hopefully :).


If ReadFile(0, "dictionary.txt")
    FileInput 0
    startpos.l = Rnd(Lof(0))
    while a$<>chr$(10) AND startpos>=0
        startpos = startpos - 1
        FileSeek startpos
        a$=Inkey$(1)
    wend
    a$=Edit$(256)
    PopInput
    CloseFile 0
End If

NPrint a$ ; should be a random line of text from the dictionary file

Anther idea is to break the word up into a chain of pointers
corresponding to the letters in the word and end the chain with a
null. If you hit a null before you run out of letters in the word or
don't have a pointer corresponding to the next letter, you know it's
not in the dictionary. The advantage is that the same chain could
correspond to several words with the same initial letters. Adding
another word would just mean adding extra pointers for the final few
letters.

It would be quick access, more compact and would not involve sorting
the dictionary to add more words.

One or two small modifications I'd like to make:

Function GetWord {filname$}
 If ReadFile(0, filename$)
    FileInput 0
    startpos.l = int(Rnd((1)*Lof(0)))     ;gets past the .w bug in rnd. startpos.l = Rnd(Lof(0))
    while a$<>chr$(10) AND startpos>=0
        startpos - 1                 ;First startpos not needed. startpos = startpos - 1
        FileSeek startpos
        a$=Inkey$(1)
    wend
    a$=Edit$(40)                     ;Anybody ever see a 256 letter word? a$=Edit$(256)
    PopInput
    CloseFile 0
 Else
    a$=""
 End If
 Function Return a$
End Function

Well select random number from 0 to filelength
seek to fileposition which is the random number minus the length of the
longest word
and read two times with edit$. The secon read returns your random word.
and this is ultra fast. ;)

Surely that should be:
    startpos.l=int(Rnd(1)*Lof(0))
?

Cos if you have (1)*Lof(0) inside the brackets you won't be getting round
the .w limit of Rnd.

EOF() doesn't seem to work (properly) under (Win)UAE, so instead of using

Hi,

Does anyone know of a way to find out what icon, or icons, are selected in
Workbench using Blitz? I think the OS3.5 Arexx port can do it, but I'd
prefer not to do it that way.

Any ideas?

I believe the 3.5 icon.library can do it, but not earlier versions...

I can't say too much because I'm a student myself. Anyway, so you don't have
to wait until christmas I've attached the needed library.  Just stick it in
blitzlibs:amigalibs/ and run makedeflibs. If you want some more info about

My son and I have been studying "C" some, but I don't like it much.

  I am hoping that a good system such as Blitz or Power Basic (that is
the right name isn't it Fred?) becomes available for the new Amiga DE
and that the Amiga DE supports Play Station 2 so that I can code for
the Amiga and have it also work on PS2 and Linux and windoze, etc.
That would be the apex of COOL!!!

    Nop, the right name is PureBasic.. An AmigaDE port is being thinked. The
Windows port is close to be finished: Sprites, joystick, keyboard, sound and
network are supported and the new public version (PR2) will be available
this week.

Subject: @{b}Will there be a Blitz Basic 3?@{ub}

Does anyone know if a 3rd version of BB will come out or will any new version be only for the Amiga One and not for "classic" Amigas. Of course I'm assuming here that development on Blitz continues.
Somebody out there could sure make a bit of money by rewriting the manual. When I got BB2 I must have spent about five or ten minutes editing it for the mistakes made that were listed on the pages marked addendum. Even then - I'd have liked there to have been more in it about some of the more complex commands and less of the simple ones eg dim, for...next etc.

This is a little off-topic but we all use Amigas anyway - Does anyone know yet what the specifications will be for the Amiga One and how much it will cost? If I've waited this long for a new Amiga I can wait at least another year more. :-)

In short, no...Blitz Basic is being revived on the PC (and it rocks :)

I'd recommend Fred Laboureur's PureBasic as the new Amiga Blitz (your source
compiles on Windoze too!)...it's modelled very much on Blitz Basic, and you
should feel right at home with it...though I get the impression it's aimed
mostly at GUI/apps type stuff in the Amiga version (does it do Blitz-mode
type stuff, anyone? The Windoze version does, or at least, is getting
there)...anyway, that's at:

You wanna head to http://www.amiga.com/ -- I really don't know whether to

You'll be able to plug in an Amiga-ONE compatible board (by Eyetech) to a

Just because it doesn't have a Blitz mode doesn't mean you can't use it for 
games :) Every big (and most shareware) game released over the last 3 years 
or so has been working under the OS.

Basically, you can use PB for apps or games, on both Amiga and PC. All of 
the app type commands are the same on both platforms, so you can just re-
compile your code. For the game stuff, I'm not sure, because both machines 
are fairly different in how they do this, but I think most of it is 
portable.

This is where Fred turns up and tells you that it is fully source 
compatible :)

Or A4000. But that's not what to get excited about, the Eyetech machine is 
just a specification to keep the rabid Amiga zealots happy. The OS/DE 
whatever you want to call it will be the interesting part.

Yeah, good point! I think I mentioned it in case people go looking for the
AMOS-like Blitz mode though... ;)

Looking at the source for one of the example games, there are only a very
few commands that call Windoze functions directly -- most of the graphics
code looks to be PureBasic's own calls, so it would probably be trivial to
make it run on the Amiga (assuming the graphics stuff is implemented in the
Amiga version)...

Is that the "Waponez II" game? Remember, Fred sent an Amiga version of that

Yeah, the Amiga version has stuff for sprites (which I think is also the 
name for blits and other moving drawing objects), bitmaps, etc, etc.

Yeah, Waponez II (I think it was originally written in Blitz?)...like I say,
it looks to be all PB commands except for a couple of calls with underscores
after them (something like InitKeyboard_ () and some other minor things)...

    Thanks for the recommends :). Current version of PureBasic Amiga (1.60)
has all needed stuffs to do a very fast and optimized 2D game: copper
rainbow, sprite (trough blitter and Amiga Hardware), chunky (c2p provided), sound, protracker
module replay... Note than all these commands doesn't shutdown the whole
AmigaOS multitasking but are all FASTER then Blitz2 commands. A Blitz mode
is being devellopped though to allow even more FXs, like parralax scrolling
and multiplexed sprites which can't be done in OS mode (for V2.00)

    Blitz mode makes sense only on 68000/512 kb based amiga (A500)...

    Hehe, that's true, even for multimedia functions (A sprite is still a
sprite, even on PC :-). Ok, some functions differs, but not so much...
