autoconstants.Usefull for GUI etc.You never need handle numbers

There is a intern counter #__autoconstant you can set

Every time you use a constant with #@xxxx this constant
#xxxx get the number #__autoconstant contain.#__autoconstant is
increase by 1 after the assign

Example for gadtools

foo.l=GTString(0,1,20,20,150,15,"Normal",#PLACETEXT_ABOVE,50)
foo.l=GTString(0,2,20,50,150,15,"Default",#PLACETEXT_ABOVE,50,"foo!")
foo.l=GTString(0,3,20,80,150,15,"Disabled",#PLACETEXT_ABOVE|$40,50)
foo.l=GTString(0,4,20,110,150,15,"Immediate",#PLACETEXT_ABOVE|$80,50)

Now you can write

foo.l=GTString(0,#@string1,20,20,150,15,"Normal",#PLACETEXT_ABOVE,50)
foo.l=GTString(0,#@default,20,50,150,15,"Default",#PLACETEXT_ABOVE,50,"foo!")
foo.l=GTString(0,#@str_disable,20,80,150,15,"Disabled",#PLACETEXT_ABOVE|$40,50)
foo.l=GTString(0,#@immideate,20,110,150,15,"Immediate",#PLACETEXT_ABOVE|$80,50)

This constant contain now same numbers as above,but maybe more readable

And acsess your gadget direct with #string #default #str_disable....

When press help over end if exact over the f the actuell if line is show
in screen title

arrays can now get multiple values,so you need not put it in data statemts
Currently work not with strings,it is harder to get it working

dim f.l(20)

f(0)=10,20,30,@@
     40,50,60,70,90,100,200,400,800,1000,@@
;more data
     60,80

Added Easy reqlib (allow of async requesters)from Etienne Ignazi
to deflibs + docu+link to example Prog

Bugfix of dialog feature in PED

64bit FPU Type .d add.

See example test64bitfpu.ab2 for more.
If you dont use the default new acidlibs,
make sure you use the new printlib.obj and vallib.obj.
If not optimizer 2 is set .d work as before with ffp
The print nprint str$ val work now always 64 bit so you get better acuracy
as before also with 32 bit fpu.

New eclock_include from Thilo Köhler add
You can choose how many ticks/sec you want
See example eclock_test.ab2.It need new tklibs.res
Or if you dont like the .res you can include eclock_include.bb2
from Thilo_includes dir

Added windowbackfillhook Command.Add a backfillhook to the following
windows open.Set adress to 0 to clear it.You can add upto 20 diffrent
24 bit pictures of any type as window background.See example for more

Thanks to Blackbird there is a usermacro_ger.guide in german.
and he add links to example Progs in usermacro.guide (ger/eng)for
image_include,eclock_include,ahi_easy_device,dbl_include.

ped work now this way.The german ped use in redhelp dir
redhelp_ger.dat.Here are the links to german files
(they have appendix _ger.guide)

linked list work now over OS with disable enable.It run 20% slower
than old but there is hope....
New command nextlistitemfast add.It is NOT safe to use lists
in other tasks/interrupts without locking by hand,
but command is 3-4* faster than old.
See the new sorttest.ab2 (addsortet command.
It lock manual but is 3* faster than old

true false command 4* faster with optimize 1 and save 12 bytes of diskspace

Bugfix of eventdoubleclick in windowslib 

CloseScreen can now work as function too.When return val=false
the screen is still open.If return val=true screen is close(same as AmigaOS Command)
There is also a bug fixed that if the screen is
close with close screen,but a non AB2 window
is open so the screen cant really close.

When then in the end command the window is closed the screen stay still open
Now all work ok
!cout macro (from all.res) change to use a console window

Also it work now correct from subtasks

str$ can now work with strings too. a$=str$(a$) is allowed.Usefull
when use macros and you dont know parametertype

Bugfix of old BB2 Bug

a.b=$90
if a=$90 then ....

a$=$6fffff03
a.l=val(a$)

work now when optimizer 3 is on.Without optimizer the bug is still in

Added to newsyntax Mode (optimize 4)esc sequences

Added Keyword for strings \\__DATE__ to insert compilation date  english
Added Keyword for strings \\__DATE_GER to insert compilation date german
Added \\n to do a linefeed (simular to C)

Note: The timer command work not if a program sets the amigaclock rapidly
Facts do that,or restoretime in winuae to get hybernate working
.Also it work not with OS Calls


updatet

usermacros.guide help of image_blit does not show when press shift help

Added macro getfpcr {value} and setfpcr {value} for read and write the
68k Controlregister to set roundingmodes

Now when use fpu the FPCR is always set to 0 on AB2 prog startup
