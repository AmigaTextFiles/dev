libinfo is another CLI only tool. It can scan through individual library files
and give you information about the commands that are contained within (name,
parameter types, help strings).

It is provided as an alternative to viewlibs, as it shows some more info, but
it is a lot more useful for library developers, or those who want to reverse
engineer a Blitz 2 library :)
