makedeflibs must be run from a CLI!!! (there are not options for it)

Makedeflibs is the tool which can read all the individual library files
contained in the sub-directories of your Blitzlibs: assign and create
the Blitz2:deflibs file.

Of course, you can do this from the library managers with GUI's, but this
tool has been included in case you prefer a CLI version or there is some
problem with the GUI based library managers.
