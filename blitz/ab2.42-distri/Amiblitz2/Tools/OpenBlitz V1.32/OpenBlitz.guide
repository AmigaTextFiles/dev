@NODE INTRO "Introduction"

    @{b}Introduction:@{ub}

  Because all the libraries on the Amiga are released
  for the C/C++ langage format, Blitz 2 users need to
  convert some files before they can use the library.

  Hopefully, a program called FDConvert (and better,
  NewFDConvert) is used to convert automatically the
  library functions into tokenized Blitz 2 functions.

  Nevertheless, you don't have the include file,
  which contain all the strutures and constants
  used by the library. And you have to convert them.
  Manually. It's very boring and time consuming.

  At this moment, OpenBLitz enter the game. It will
  simply take your include file and convert it in
  Blitz 2 format. Only that :-). The result is near
  from perfect for about all includes files I've test
  (some bugs persist...). You must do the needed
  corrections by hands.

@NODE COPYR "Copyrights"

    @{b}Copyrights:@{ub}

  This package is Giftware. If you find it useful, send me a postcard
  of your town/country and I will be very happy. If you want make
  a donation, it's welcome and you will get a little surprise...
  (if you're on the net).

  Therefore, it's freely distribuable so spread it like you want !

@NODE INSTA "Installation"

    @{b}Installation:@{ub}

  Drag the file where you want.

  ASL.library is requiered.

@NODE HOWUS "How To Use It"

    @{b}How To Use It:@{ub}

  Launch the program, and a little window will ask you
  what you want to do. OpenBlitz can operate in two
  ways:

    + Convert a single file (self explanatory)

    + Convert a whole drawer:
  In this mode, all the files are converted, without any
  distinctions. Very usefull for large convert (ie:
  the Rom Kernal Manual includes files...:-)

  All the files are outputed in the 'Ram:T/' drawer. 

@ENDNODE


@NODE SPEED "Limitations"

    @{b}Limitations:@{ub}

  OpenBlitz has been written to convert header files, not standard
  C/C++ programs. So don't claim me that it doesn't convert Netscape
  Comunicator C++ source correctly into Blitz code..

  + 'Union' stuffs within structures aren't converted
  + Fixed string can be changed as the convertor doens't take
    care if the info is inside a string or outside.

@ENDNODE


@NODE FUTUR "Future plans"

    @{b}Future plans:@{ub}

  Make a more and more accurate convertions. All bugs/ideas reports
  are welcome.
