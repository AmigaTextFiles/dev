      2.27
      Fixed old BB2 bug when call OS command with more than 2 stringvars
      
      ped crash fix if screenid is not known.Open screen with id 0 then
      so you need not clear ped.prefs

      syntax 2 fix Tony Rolfe report  *account account give errors

      object adress calculations work with 32 bit instead of 16 bit
      A maximum of 32000 Objects can now be used

      !screen_width !screen_height !screen_depth !screen_id macros add
      to get the dimensions of a Screen opened with !screen_

      The screenwidth commands of elmorefunclib i not recommend to use
      to get screen dimensions because intuition delay sometimes updating
      this short after a screen is open so this macros are add
      Fixed end in Macros report Arne Lunde
      Fixed type\a,1,2,3,4,5 go wrong if start on not word alligned report Arne Lunde
      Fixed runerrsof sometimes give line 1111 Error  report Thilo Köhler

      fpu optimizer fix:
      sa.l = a.l-testfunc{Str$("test")}
      optimize 1 fix #num-1 sometimes work wrong

      does put fpu regs illegal to stack
      (because AB2 think ustr$ use FPU)
                                 Thanks to Steffen Nitz for the example Code
      optimizer 1/2 fixes       Thanks to Thilo Köhler for lots reports

.News 2.27

   foldjump add.
   If a cursur down come to a ;@@1
   then it jump to the next ;@@0
   If a cursor up come to a ;@@0 and there is a above ;@@1 then it jump to it
   See example for it
   Pressing help over ;@@0 toggle between ;@@0 and ;@@1

   Added Tooltype Classiccolor.This show chipset commands in diffrent color
   in instructionhelper.No tooltype set all is like old
   Tooltype value 99 disable showing of chipset commands in
instructionhelper
   Other values show instruction with palettenumber

   Paste changes
   If you have no mark spaces in 1. line
   ped paste at current column whole block Thanks amorel for idea
   If you have spaces in first mark line old way is done

   cybergraphics online guide from Aminet CGX-DEV archive.Thanks Blackbird

   Press help after \ or over \ open typehelper and show type
   Work also with usepath (\content)and arrays.
   Limits: if you have lokal and global var with same name but diffrent types
           the local type is choose
   Only help here is avoid same varname in local global with diffrent type

   screen_ macro support also Tags add in all.res
   version macro add to all.res
   Optional Function Parameter need a @ before the var this make it safer
   (if you not notice the warning you get random effects in C
   i search long in winuae for such a bug)
   All vars later are optional
   Missed parameter values are set to -1
   Thanks Thilo for Idea

   For ex.
   statement test{par1,@par2,par3}
   if par2=-1 then par2=........  .Do this for handle it.
   .....
   Setting

   Calling
   test{}       give error not enough parameter
   test{10}     ok par1=10 par2 and par3 have value -1
   test{10,20}  ok par2 have value 20 and par3 =-1


   Added window settings at F4 F5 F6.To store settings press lamiga+F4 /F5/F6
   The current active window is then the window where the string is activate
   after recall a setting
   Note: No string gad should be activate for now to save and recall settings
   To see if store is correct the windows do short close and reopen
   To save settings to file you need choose prefs and click on save.
   After start from ped always config F4 is load

       Clash in resident show now in windowtitle what clash
       Instruction object and end object add
       See online guide for this
       You can insert Instruction Pars in a dialog.Press CTRL+HELP
       for this.If the win is open you can click also on the instruction
       to show the pars in the dialog.Add Code add the code or modify it if
       there was code after instruction

       Better comment display and chars after ;:@ is not draw as a comment

       Added ped hotkeys:
     
       lamiga+a jump to last position where you add chars
       lamiga+shift+1/2/3 save local bookmark
       lamiga+1/2/3 jump to local bookmark

       Tooltype standardeditmode change return key to standard
       (return split line)
       backspace on first column do a join line
       Pressing del on a marked block clear the block and do a displaybeep warning


       You can use upto 5 FPU registervars do it with regload var1 var2.
       which increase speed on your Code.fpu load/store convert always single
       to extend this give you a speed boost on all Systems
       If vars are changed when they are on register do a regsave.
       It store all register to memory.

      strings can cast to longs(char num cannot be greater than typesize)
      compare work with byte word long and float
       in newsyntax mode

    Example:
      x.l=@"ILBM":if x=@"CMAP" then .....:if a.w=@"ab"
      Give lot speed instead of using asc(x)

      Added AB2fdconvert
      enhanced bb2convert that handle reserved AB2 numbers correct
      and also scan
      blitz:userlibs/beta dir for existing libs to get no clashes

      ; Highlight fix highlight now at first ;

      \\char add char with hexbyte to a string in newsyntaxmode (optimize 4)
      You must write always both chars (ex: \\0a for 0xa)
      print "\\22 Hello \\22"  print the text " Hello "
      If you want print \\ you need write \\\\ 4 backslashs

      \\R05char repeat char 5 times print "\\R09*Hello" print"********* Hello"

      Tooltype STARTDIR add.You can choose a default directory now for startup

      Does now automatic switch to nontoken Mode so you can
      edit .guide and .txt Files in ped.Try the amiblitz History it have some bookmarks set
Note: if you maybe get wrong mode (nothing is impossible)
      go to preferences and set the tokenmode manuel (no data lost possible)
      If you totally unhappy with this feature
      Tooltype no_auto_tokenize can set

Ped can now handle editpad/YAM Clipboard data

writetype/readtype command add to load/save a complete Type

     Use only with this compiler Version or you get runtime errors

     stop commands are ignored in release builds

     No error no crash now
debug of extern programs
     Type DEBUG as first command in your programm and you can debug
     it when you have a plugin or start from WB or cli
     Notes: dont let such a program reach a stop when ped is not run
            Also the source of this program must be visible in ped
            or you see no (wrong Source) in reddebug

BTW:  Ped(AMiblitz) can now debug since this version with reddebug


.Fixes 2.27:
      
.reddebug 2.53 shows now no enforcer hits (i hope)
              show Programmcounter in dissasembler window
              Changing programcounter update disasm window
              Clicking on # show now constants too
      2.26

.News 2.26:
      Give Error when use FAST in Functions wrong.See also the tips in the reuqester
      If FAST give no error you can now sure that the function
      use no memalloc and is as fast as a C Function

      Statement/Functions parameter num  increase from 6 to 10

      Added 020 Addressing Modes 0(a0,d0*2[4,8])
      Added 020 Instruction extb.l which do ext.w d0:ext.l d0
A german and a english version is available
                          german translate from  cj-stroker (Franz Schlick )
      rename ped_ger to ped to use the german ped version
      and start amiblitz_ger

      Horizontal 128 char Limit increase to 250 chars
      Horizontal realtime scroll
      Dim in functions now work
      *pointer="abcdef"  or *pointer=a$ give error now because it can not work
      stable in praxis (reportet from Berga)
      a$="123"
      Print peek$(*pointer)
      print out 123 because *pointer show to temporary stringbuffer

      Use *pointer.s="abcdef" or *pointer=&a$ instead

      Dim KEEP added.This allow redim without datalost
      Check with:
      dim KEEP a(dim1,....,changedim)
      if getd0=0 then ..... ;d0 has value 0 if it fail
      If it fail no old data is lost so you can continue your program
      only you can NOT do is access more dimdata so you must set maxdim
      to your old value back.
      Keep in mind that only the last dimension can change

      Syntax command added:
      Bit 0 (value 1) indicate that you must declare all vars now
      with deftype/shared

      Bit 1 (the praxis solution idea from Thilo Köhler)(value 2)
      see above but a myvar.l is also accepted
      If you type later in your prog mvar AB2 report a error because
      AB2 think you have written something wrong.Pointers you must
      declare *pointer.l  Strings are accept with mystr$ or mystr.s

      Bit 2 (4)
      Typeconvert to smaller sizes give a error.
      To force it type + as first character in new line or after :


      Shift+Help on objects work now too

      Syntax Error replaced with more concrete Tips

      Functioncalls can now have variable parameter count on newsyntaxmode
          All missing parameters have then value 0

      Editor can work in 8/16 colors now (set tooltype newcolormode)
      The blockmarkcolor ist then always the last color of the palette
      So be sure to modify your palette to your needs.
      A example ped.prefs is included for 16 Color sheme
     
      Allow now highlightcolor for functions/constants/macros/strings/types
      Set Tooltypes functioncolor macrocolor constantcolor to desired
      Palette value)
      
Fixes
       Fixed chars >128 in data$

       Note: a and b /a or b give error use & or | instead
        In asm instructions lsl asl you must type the : after the label
        as in old mode

       asm fpu/ppc dont work in include files  (reportet Bug from Thilo Koehler)

       check for wizard.library and disassembler.library to avoid crashes
       With missing disassembler.library you can work with AB2 but then the
       reddebugger show only questionmarks in disasmview

that should show in instructionshelp after the macro def
ex: macro mymacro ;myhelp for this
(see more in How to use in Libraryoverview)
Embedded Help work only if compiled
with  AB2 >2.23 so you must recompile your all.res to see comment line
With newsyntax Mode (optimize >=4) label out of context range work
