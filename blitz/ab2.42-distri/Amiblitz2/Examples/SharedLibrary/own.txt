Howto make a standard Amiga shared Library with AB2

compile ownlib.bb2
1. This create the shared library in the libs: dir of the amiga
    Now you can use the library with whatever you want.
    If you wonder wy it is so large (34kb)keep in mind that all basic
    librarys must add here too 
    Soo for small libs best you use ncommands or no basiccode
Note:
The libname you use for the file and the libname in the source 
must EXACT Casesensitive or it dont work
best you use small letters.

See the labels where you can add your stuff

2. Add your commands to the own.fd file.


3. Use the ab2fdconvert to generate the library description for AB2
   The library is create in Blitz2:userlibs/beta so you need not
   rebuild the deflibs:restart AB2 is enough
   Also you can update deflibs/acidlibs without loosing your libs
   if you use libnums above 200 (6 free) or 2,3 (2 Free)


Now you can load the own_test.bb2
If the lame.... commands are tokenized all work ok
