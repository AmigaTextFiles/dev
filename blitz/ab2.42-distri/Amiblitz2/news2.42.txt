Add comand in brexxlib rawkeystate rawqualifier,can use to
check keys and mouse in OS friendly way. Should work on PPC OS

Add check for scriptbit that online guide can work

added new gadtools lib from David (fix gtcycle Bug)

fixed Bug in standardeditmode
when ped scroll horizontal and press return (Report from Demon)

You can build automatic commandline help for your
bb2(for example stats&funcs.bb2) files that contain functions and statements

To do this copy this files in dir blitz2:includes or choose one with the
tooltype incdir="myincludedir"

include and xinclude statements search last
before they give error in this dir

choose Menu edit->Build help from includedir

Now a file is build browsefile.txt in blitz2: dir

This file is used by ped to support help
Now if press help over such a command give the commandline help.

when you press help there also popup a window below code which close
with cursor up down or esc.It show the filename in which the function is
If direct after the function is
;% help

All lines are show then too
To see in praxis type the command  ahi_bytes2samps and press help

also it is possible that you build amiga guide help.
To do this add the text in usermacros.guide or usermacrosgerman.guide

I currrently dont add feature that this win close when do mousemove,
i think so it is more usefull.But if you want it close by mousemove let me
know,i add then a option.Also other ideas are welcome

With CTRL+right cursor you can open instruction helper for command
completion below cursor

To see the browsefile.txt help in Instructionbrowser press the toggle button
incdir

acidlibs bugfix
allocmem is 8 byte allign(some chipset modes need this)
editlib  edit commands dont give error if no Blitz window is,open
         because it should be possible that you write programs
         without blitzwindows
menulib  fixed harmless enforcer hit on menutitles with string ""

deflibs bugfix

nclipboardlib bugfix some tst.l are forget after OS call to fix OS4 Problems

NOTE:I think the Coder of nlib dont know that RKM say dont assume
     on correct flags
     so all nlibs have this problem.If your program should run on OS4
     avoid nlibs.I have no source of other nlibs to fix it

If you get token not found $d505 then you not use this new acidlibs
because getd0 from wizard.obj is now intern mapped
to $d505 token (in editlib).This avoid load of wizard.library
and 30 kb memsave if you dont need it
(Thilo includes use this)

This acidlibs file work also on older AB2 and BB2 correct

ped and debugger work better with fonts diffrent topaz 8
New ped menus in edit
Choose file and add to code ->open a filerequester and add the filename
                              to source
Load file under cursor      ->load the file under the cursor into new ped
                               window
Example

include "myinclude" when cursor is between the " load the file myinclude in

Show in last line filebuttons which can click to switch to file in ped

Error of compiler in include now load the file and position cursor on that line

IMPORTANT BUGFIX: New System friendly compile progressbar add because
old BB2 code trash memory at end of Z3 mem when you use a screen >800*600*32bit

fixed old ted random crash when choose a font

global variables add

Command
SHARED out of a funktion do that.See in examples dir sharedtest.bb2

debugger have now a bubblehelp.click in source window on a expression
calc this expression.This string is then the default for add variable
and eval Requester so you can add or change fast

Faster source win and disasm redraw

s and d key for step or step over have autorepeat.As long you press
the debugger execute steps.


2.41

New acidlibs:

New command readline$ add.See example that print user-startup
Most it is used to parse bb2 source on which edit$ fail due to missed
$0a and $0d

bugfix in eventdoubleclick
read a line of text from a file in the string very fast

horizontal scroll work on PPC OS

ped do highlight commands that are classic only

To select the colors easy:
Load a source
choose menu prefs
select a 8 bit screen 16 color or more
new select use
Now you see in realtime in your source,when you change the colors of highlighting
Now change to your desired 16 24 32 bit screen you want

Systemconstant #__include
If the file is include from another file it is set to 1.
This is need for new thilo includes to run automatic the demo,when
you compile and run the include standalone

cnif @#test. @ is indicator that say that if #test is not define
give no compiler error and let it 0.If #test is set than it is 1
Same as the C  IFDEF check
