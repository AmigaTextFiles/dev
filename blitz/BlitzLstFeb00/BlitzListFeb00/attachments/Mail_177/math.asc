;Hi All!

;I changed with sucess all my libs with NewFdConvert because I was NOT able To
;Use Mathffp OR Mathtrans OS commands, AND, the problem still there...

;Try this:

WbToScreen 0
Window 0,0,0,320,200,$140F,"",1,2

sp1.f=10
sp2.f=2.5

result.f= SPMul_(sp1,sp2)          ; Answer Should be 25

NPrint "{SPMul}    10 x 2.5 = ",result  ;well, this still returns 0  :(

;------------------------------------------------------------------

result.f=sp1.f*sp2.f               ;but the Blitz command works????

NPrint "{Blitz .f} 10 x 2.5 = ",result

;------------------------------------------------------------------



A.f = 90 * Pi/180                ; Tranfert 90 degree in Radian


ret.f=SPCos_( A )

NPrint "{SPCos}    90 * Pi/180 = ",ret
                          ;I don't know if this is right, but it's
                          ;no longer a negative number...
MouseWait
End

;Like you will see Both anwers will are wrong...

;Any Suggestions?
