<h2>Useful System Calls</h2>

You do not know what system calls are ? Well, maybe you've seen that part in
you manual where in introduces to commands with a "_" at the end. That is
exactly the way Blitz indicates subroutines in the system libraries being
the part of your workbench package. There are many various libraries in the
SYS:LIBS/ drawer, but only some of them are of particular interest for us
within blitz: the <tt>graphics.library</tt> and the <tt>intuition.library</tt>.
To find out about another routines in the other libraries, please obtain a
copy of the AutoDocs (documentation about system functions).<p>

Now let us pick out some calls from the <tt>intuition.library</tt>:<br>
<ul>
<li><tt>ChangeWindowBox_()</tt> [V36]<br>
This Function moves and resizes a window in one step.<br>
<li><tt>ClearPointer_()</tt><br>
<li><tt>CloseWorkbench_()</tt><br>
<li><tt>DisplayAlert_()</tt><br>
<li><tt>DisplayBeep_()</tt><br>
<li><tt>LockIBase_()</tt><br>
<li><tt>LockPubScreen_()</tt><br>
<li><tt>OpenWorkBench_()</tt><br>
<li><tt>RefreshWindowFrame_()</tt><br>
<li><tt>UnlockIBase_()</tt><br>
<li><tt>WBenchToBack</tt><br>
<li><tt>WBenchToFront</tt><br>
