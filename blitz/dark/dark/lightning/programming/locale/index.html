<h2>The locale.library</h2>

If you are writing applications in Blitz, you surely are interested in
providing a version for your own and other improtant languages. compiling
several lagnuage versions does not make much sense. This is where you could
use the locale.library in your program. This library is available on every
system with 2.1 and above. The clue is the following: you obtain from your
program strings with id-numbers. So maybe #1 could be 'Okay' or #2 could
be 'Cancel' etc. If the user requests an another laguage (he set in his
locale preference program), the id's remain the same, only their contents
change, so  e.G. in german #2 will be 'Abbrechen'. These strings are stored in
a file with the suffix '.catalog' in a IFF format, so we need a extra tool to
edit them.
