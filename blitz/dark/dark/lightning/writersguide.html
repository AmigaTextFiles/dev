<h2><b>The Lightning - Writers' Guidelines</b></h2>
</center>

<ol>
<h2><li>Submission</h2>
Currently, all material intended for the magazine should be sent to Morten
Lehmann.
<p>
<pre>
   Internet:       <a href=mailto:ml@db.dk>ml@db.dk</a>
   Snail-mail:     Morten Lehmann
                   Kisumparken 77, 1. tv.
                   DK-2660  Brondby Strand
                   Denmark
</pre>
<p>
Material should be in either standard ASCII-format or HTML2-compliant
format. If you submit your material in ASCII-format you're encouraged to
attach a document with guidelines as to the final formatting of your material.<br>
Blitz-code should be submitted in ASCII-format. (Use ...[menu-item, which I
can't recall at the moment] ). Also, whenever possible, try to list any
special libraries you use, which are not in the standard Blitz-package.

<h2><li>Copyright</h2>
All authors retain copyright on their material. Therefore please enclose a
note, that you're allowing us to use the material submitted, or that you're
issuing the material into the Public Domain.<br>
Please note though, that readers are allowed to use the sourcecode presented
in the magazine as they wish.<br>
'The Lightning' or it's editors can not be made responsible for the content
of anything submitted to and used within the magazine, following these
conditions.<br>
<i>[Now, I don't know s**t about law. Could someone try to translate this into
something that will not give us any trouble?]</i>

<h2><li>Payment</h2>
'The Lightning' is freeware. As such we're making no money, and so the
people submitting won't either. But you can go to sleep in the evening,
knowing you have done something good for the Blitz-community!<br>
All those submitting material to the magazine are entitled to a free copy of
the disk-based version, should they want it. Please state in the material
that you want the disk, otherwise you won't get it.<br>

<h2><li>Content</h2>
<ol>
<li>Tips<br>
If you've got a good tip regarding Blitz, just send it. A simple description
should be OK here
<p>
<li>Article/SourceCode<br>
If you're submitting sourcecode, please take the time needed to fully
comment it. We're not going to feature *any* uncommented sourcecode (except
for perhaps the most trivial stuff). Whenever possible, also write a small
article describing what your sourcecode does, and how it is structured - use
your imagination :-)<br>
If you choose to go the other way around, that is writing an article and
then illustrating it with some sourcecode, or source-snippets, please see to
it, that all your sourcecode is either documented in the article or
otherwise commented on.<br>
Don't worry about spelling mistakes etc. We'll be able to proofread everything.
<p>
<li>Tutorials/Series<br>
If you've written a tutorial/how-to article, please try to illustrate it
with the odd source-code.<br>
If you've written a series or just part of a series, try to divide it into
sensible parts. Divide the thing where it seems right logically. Also try to
be at least one installment ahead! This way your readers won't despair,
should you get 'writers block' or something.
