Quoting my RKM's here.

Public RAM is at present not implemented in the Amiga system.  It's function
will be to provide a non swappable area of memory that is available to all
programs.  Software should use this flag to ensure compatibility with future
Amiga systems.

End quote.

At this point in time, specifying public or fast makes no difference.
However, it does make a difference when running on a chip memory only Amiga.
If you specify fast on an unexpanded A1200, the allocation fails.  If you
specify public on the same A1200, you get the requested allocation in chip ram.
