 Hmm. I can think of one solution for this..

 There is a command called "NTSC" which could be used in a situation 
like so..

Blitz
 If NTSC=True:ForcePAL:EndIf

 This _should_ take care of any problems with NTSC users and PAL copper-
lists. The only downside is that it won't work if the Agnus can't go
to Pal, but if those lazy [censored] people haven't upgraded that yet,
they deserve to be left out. :P
