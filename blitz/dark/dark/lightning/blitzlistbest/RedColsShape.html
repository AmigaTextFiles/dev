Here is a small algorithm for converting
a m-plane shape to a n-plane shape 
with predetermined colours, that uses dithering

*The shape has dimensions Wx,Wy.
*original shape is number 1
*decreased shape is number 2


--Get the colour at one pixel.
--Search the palette for the two closest colours
The best way to do that is to calculate an error% for
each available colour and use the smallest ones IMHO.
Another way, that is best with dithering, is to get 
the smallest 2 values that have a different error sign.(difficult to 
do fast)
*Random Dithering
--Choose the appropriate color by using a uniform distribution
such as Rnd. The possibility of a color been chosen should be equal
to the ratio of error between that color and the other.
*Normal dithering
--Instead of using a random function, you can use that possibility
in order to determine an appropriate dither pattern. That complicates
things a bit, as you will have to have use x and y to determine
which pixel in the pattern should be displayed.
--Go back until no more pixels


There is also a technique that increases the picture contrast in order
to get better-looking results. This is done by mapping the lower and 
higher intensity colours of the original shape to the corresponding
colours of the predetermined palette.

If you look into the subject's literature, you will find hundreds of 
methods to do that. Take your pick. I can give you some references if
you want.
