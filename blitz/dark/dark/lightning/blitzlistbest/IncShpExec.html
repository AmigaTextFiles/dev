  Thank you very much or the answer. Another way that was proposed to me by
  Ted Bailey is the following:

  - load all the shapes I want to include with the LoadShape command.
  - save all the shapes with the SaveShapes command (like a shape bank).
  - Do the following

        DecodeShapes 0,4,?initgrf

        ....(code)


        initgrf:
        IncBin "shapes"
