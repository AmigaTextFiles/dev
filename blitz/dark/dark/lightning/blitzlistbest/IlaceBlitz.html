I did have one ready for BUM10 <sulk>

Anyway, before I make another one it's something like this I think...


Bitmap 0,640,512,8                  <---- BIG bitmap

DisplayGenlock 4                    <---- this forces interlace and must be
                                          before the initcoplist

InitCoplist 0,40,256,$13108,8,256,0  <--- height is still 256 although it
                                          magically becomes 512....
