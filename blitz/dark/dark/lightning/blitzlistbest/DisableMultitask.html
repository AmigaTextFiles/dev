I  tried a lot of things to kill flicker in Intui-Windows ...  but
nothing works 100%.

After  my  brain  was grown up doubble size, I found the solution.
Just  disavle multitasking while scrolling !!!  Thats no joke .  I
think all other editors/paintprogs or whatelse uses this trick!

Example ...

Forbid_
WScroll
Permit_

This  works 1000000% and it takes no time !!!!  Your Machine is as
fast as without Forbid_ / Permit_ , perhaps even faster !!!!!
