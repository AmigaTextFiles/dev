As far as I know (and according to the manual), the LoadFont command tries
loading fonts from the FONTS: assign, not the current directory. If you
specify a full path, it will search there however. Try this:


dos$="cd >T:spoon"
Execute_ dos$,0,0
If OpenFile(0,"T:spoon")
  FileInput 0
  pa$=Edit$(256)
  PopInput
  CloseFile 0
  KillFile "T:spoon"
EndIf
; pa$ now contains the current directory
LoadFont 0,pa$+"/temp/2001.font",8


This code works (I just tried it) and while not as elegant, you only have
to get the current directory once.
