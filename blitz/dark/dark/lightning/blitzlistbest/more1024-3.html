Recipe for chunks a'la shapes (suitable for 4 servings) :
You will need:
    Greater than 1000 shapes. (not worthwhile with less)
    Blitz Basic (any flavour, newer the better)
    Misc food, drink and music for consumption while working.

1. Arrange your shapes into logical chunks. e.g all workers in one chunk,
all explosions in another chunk, etc. Each chunk must be less than 1000
shapes, preferably less than 500 for ease of use.

2. Get all the shapes for the first chunk into Blitz either with GetAShape
or a shape editor.

3. Use the command SaveShape to save all shapes to a file. Call the file
something sensible so you know what is in it.

4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for each chunk you have.

5. In your main program (or suitable mixing bowl), at the bottom include
the following two lines for each chunk -

.<sensible name for chunk>:
INCBIN "<chunk file name>"

6. To activate a chunk use the following line (light grilling also works) -

DecodeShapes <beginning shape num>,<end shape num>,?<name for chunk from 5>

7. When you have finished your chunks a'la shapes, use the following -

For count.b=<beginning shape num> To <end shape num>
    Free Shape count
Next

(note: This stage could be slow. Perform only when necessary. Adding herbs
and spices at this stage does not help the speed, but improves flavour)

8. You are now ready to activate another chunk as in 7. Of course, if the
total shapes does not exceed 1000, more than one chunk can be active at a
time.
