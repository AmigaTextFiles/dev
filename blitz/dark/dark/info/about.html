<h1>About</h1>

Finally i managed to get back to this project, which actually has been
frozen for a loooong while. Motivated by the great iBrowse and all other
new amiga browsers, i want to demonstrate, that a basic based language like
blitz has the possibilities to write such range of software.
This is a very early demo release for some good friends..
<p>
please try it out and let me know, what you think.<br>
This software is NOT complete !
<p>

<b>technical, bugs & co.</b>
<ul>
<li>sometimes spaces appear or disappear (uh, strange)
<li>url resolving is sometimes not correct.
<li>the blitz-tag is still not supported. Soon ...
<li>make sure, that you've got 'ed' and 'more' in your c: drawer<br>
without the edit & view options doesn't work
</ul>
<br>
<b>todo next...</b>

<ul>
<li>make that tortoise faster !!!
<li>tables !!! ;-) (but this one will be very hard)
<li>and many, many more !!! :)
</ul>
<p>
<br>
note that this project is being developed in blitz 2 ...<br>
the parser should primarily be used to view blitz documentation, or tutorials.<br>
maybe a blitz magazine will base on it ...
