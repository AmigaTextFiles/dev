html viewer programmed in blitz basic 2.1.
quite all html2.dtd tags supported, quite fast.
source code included.
a special bonus: the archive
contains material which was planned to
be released as a blitzbasic-mag called lightning
unfortunately the project freezed down somehow...
maybe you'll pick it and continue.
BTW: the dark html-viewer should be used for
viewing the magazine.

background:
-----------

as i have not longer enough time to continue developing
programs (especially in blitz basic) i decided to give
the devlopment avay. i would be glad if the included
sourcecode helps other 'blitzers' to become more skilled
in coding clean intuition programs.
please contact me via email, if you pick up the code,
and let me know how/if you will use it in future.
