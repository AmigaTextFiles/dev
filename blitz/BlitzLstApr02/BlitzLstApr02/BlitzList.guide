						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

Can anyone tell me why this code will NOT goto cleanend if I send it a ctrl_c
signal. In other words it doesn`t respond to a break. I know I got it to work,
but it doesn`t currently. SetSignal_(0,0) also doesn`t work.

signals.l=SetSignal_(0,#SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C)
If signals=signals & #SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C
  Goto cleanend
EndIf

Subject: @{b}AB2.26@{ub}

Now it`s not possible to do something like this:

ng25\ng_GadgetText=textread25_1$ 

and this:

*procmp\mp_Node\ln_Name="BlahSomePort"


It gives an error "can`t convert types". I read sth about *pointer="xxx" not
being possible anymore, but I can`t understand it fully. Adding a & in front
of the string helps, but I don`t feel like changing whole my source. It
obviously worked ok. What wasn`t stable about this, as the docs say it can not
work stable?

Then print the ln_Name
ln_name has now the string 12345 in 2.25

because the ln_Name points to the Blitz temporary stringbuffer and the
buffer is changed with every stringoperation


Keep in mind that you can get very strange errors when you do this

C=e.g.

C=*foo.s=&blah$ ; will work
C=*bar.b=&blah$ ; will not

I don`t know, they are strings or STRPTR or whatever afaik. It works the way I
do it(pre 2.26 (ami)blitz does compile ok), otherwise I would have noticed by

I see, maybe that explains why I get some characters on a window somewhere

it`s gone.

I guess I have to do:

var$="BlahSomePort"
*procmp\mp_Node\ln_Name=&var$

And it will all be ok? I know that makes the compile error go away.

Yes thats ok

But i can try for this situation to add a new AB2 feature immediate strings

so a *procmp\mp_Node\ln_Name=&"blahsomeport"  can work too

BTW: this maybe can speedup stringoperations a lot

because normaly the string is copy to the tempbuffer.and the pointer of the
tempbuffer is then given.
then the stringbuffer is copy to the variable

with &"blahport" the pointer to the binary maybe can given

If you do lots of constant compares this give much speedincrease

AHI is a piece of shit and the author admits it if you read his docs well :-)
But that`s beyond my point, we`re stuck with it, how sad it may be.

I don`t get the damn example in blitzahifuncs.lha working, except from a
little click. AHI is working ok on my system, as other programs using it
testify.

Told you AHI sucks ;-)

Subject: @{b}Re: AHI@{ub}

Hello amorel

AHI is ok, but a bit overheaded on slower systems.

If you like I can send you my source.
I did it for the device interface (found in Samplemanager.lha, Aminet)
and for the function interface (found in HD-Rec), including AHI mode 
requester. It is in the style of the image.include, just like

if AHI_open {}
  While morebuffers
    If AHI_nextbuffer {}
       AHI_write {mybufferptr.l,blength.l}
    End If
  Wend
  AHI_close {}
End if

The sources are optimized for my needs, but maybe this helps
you.

If you only need to output a double buffered stream I recomend
the device interface (has also a function for visualisation of
output level and calculation of current timeindex), otherwise you 
will need the function interface
(which is much more difficult to use, and much means really much).

Ciao,

Thilo

@NODE "mail_12" " AHI soundfunc hook "
From: Thilo Köhler <koehlerthilo@...>
Date: 04-12-02 01:21:02
Subject: @{b}AHI soundfunc hook@{ub}

Hi all!

Does someone know some stuff about the AHI library
interface ?

My question:
When I playback sound data it has a slightly crackling
noise in it. The higher frequencies are more affected then the
lower. I found out that is has something to do with
the soundfunc hook I am using for doublebuffering.
How much time I am allowed to spend in the soudnfunc hook ?
I do mixing some audiostreams to fill the next (short) buffer.

Seems like I am spending more time than one sample (sampleframe!)
needs for playback and the AHI system is blocked and repeats 
this sample (thats why lower noises are not much affected,
as neighboured samples are almost equal).

This would mean the time to spend in the soudnfunc hook is limited
to the duration of one sample, e.g. 1/44100 sec if you playback
at 44100 Hz.

Any ideas ?

Anyone did a bit more than setting up the loop within the soundfunc ?

Ciao,

Thilo

You should only change the playbuffer to your last calculate one and do a
software interrupt and calc your new data to the last free buffer.Tasks are
not dropout stable but for debugging you can also signal a task and
calculate data from here.

Gives an "Array subscript out of range" error at the AllocAslRequest_ in
AB2.26, it didn`t do this in earlier versions.

It doesnt matter if you use tag2(0) or &tag2(0). I normally don`t use the "&"
in front of a tag array, but this code was partially copied from statfuncs.

Hi,

Right, some background info on the MUI cycle gadgets first.

The items in the cycle list are not stored in an array, they are created in
the MUICycle command.

How can I change the items in the list? Is there a property for it? Using
MUISet I'd have to use an array, which I'm a bit loathe to do (although its
not too troubling, admittedly) but is there any way of doing it without an
array?

Cheers,

Hi all!

I have following questions to the dynamic Lists
(from Amorel (?))

1. Is it correct to do

If AddItem (mydynlist())
  mydynlist()\x = 0
End If

because I dont see the "if additem() then" in the example,
there is only Additem() without if.


2. Seems that new memory is allocated every 10-20 new
entries. When Items are freed I dont see the memory
going back to the system. Is it freed at all when I do killitem() ?


3. Is it correct to do
Clearlist(mydynlist())
if I want to throw all items away ? Is the memory freed then or
is there no way to free it (except end of Program) ?


4. What happens if no memory is available ? Guru ?
Then I suggest to let Additem() simply fail to make it 100%
compatible to normal lists.


Thanks for any help,

There is an optional flag with DLL.   If the #DLL_TRAP_ERRORS flag is 
zero then you must do your own error handling.   In other words,  you 
do the above code and handle the else clause yourself.

If #DLL_TRAP_ERRORS is set to 1 then the DLL routines trap all errors 
and you have to supply a function called Fatal_Error, which takes a 
string argument.  A sample is supplied which simply pops up a 
requester with the string supplied.

All memory is deallocated when no longer used.   Either at killitem or 
Clearlist.    How the original Blitz commands work, I'm not sure.

Yes, as I am doing it and it does work. I don`t know if it actually will

internal error checking or so, I`d rather (also) have returning false if so)

You could change that in the arrayslib source and recompile iirc.

Standard Blitz mem alloc (allocmem) fail with a trap so you need to install
a errorhandler now but i plan to add memalloc commands that return a 0 soon

No this is because poolmem use a puddle size of 2000 Bytes
The default value is after every 3. listitemadd the memory is alloc.(can
change if you wish for more speed)

Reason is simple memalloc take much time. See textprocessing Programs
golded/finalwriter....
Try loadijng 100000 Lines (it use lists every line is a entry)
You notice long load times. If you release your text you notice even much
longer time where mem is released
(see how your memory is increase).Releasing mem take much time because the
mementry must search from the OS to merge the freed mem in.Also it cause
fragmentation

No  this free not the mem

You need to do a
dim list mydimlist() to clear all mem

I dont add a freemem code if you release a item because i think you load
something so you have the memory.
Then if you work on it normaly it grows.It is really selden that you want to
shrink a project i think.

If someone want to change the Code it is possible if you use a increase num
of 1 to free the mem
But i see no need for this.Speedloss is very extrem if do this also if you
use poolmem

Setting the increase size per AB2 Instruction i can add if someone wish it
(now you can change the constant in the source)

If you load/make another project then the dim list mydimlist() clear all mem

If i have allocmem working without trapping this return false

First, I have tried this test on KS1.3:

  NPrint "OK!"
Else
  NPrint "Error!"
EndIf
End

It worked correctly.

After that I built it into my program:

If ExecVersion>36
; Main program here:
  ...
    *Cat=OpenCatalogA(0,"test.catalog",0)
  ...
Else
  NPrint "Error!"
EndIf
End

It is not working on KS1.3!
I have checked it with Snoopdos:
My program opens locale.libary before KS checking!
Is there any solution for checking KS?

Hi,

The reason for this is that all libraries are initialised at the start of your program. In 
most (all?) cases, this will include opening any OS libraries that are required.

However, this should not matter. If they library cannot be opened, it will not be. You then 
check for the version of the OS and quit if it is too old. The library will be closed on 
program exit (if it was opened).

I really do not see why this is a problem.

You have a kickstart >1.3 Install and you use Kickstart 1.3.
On a clean 1.3 install there is no locale library so this must work

You can't make Slices that have 256 colours, you need to 
use the DisplayLibrary.

And if the built in commands do not work very well, you 
could always write your own code to do the fade:

loop:
 For frames=0 To 255
  For i.w=0 To 255
   AGAPalRGB 0,i,Max(AGARed(i)-1, 0), Max(AGAGreen(i)-1,0), 
Max(AGABlue(i)-1,0)
  Next
  DisplayPalette 0,0

Subject: @{b}let the program code and compile itself.@{ub}


this is a frightening project of mine,
that randomly alters some strings
in the editor, and compiles itself.

you only need to start it by compiling once.

the strings then develop randomly each compilation.

the two last lines in the code is dependant
on how long the menu takes to react
after the mousebutton is released.
if it reacts too quick,
the prog is not allowed to compile
because the current has not ended yet.
If you have that problem,
you could try to run something
cpu consuming in the background.

you need to have a 640x512 display,
and any size 8 font to make it work.

the included prefs can make this for you.
( copy to env )

if you let it develop too long,
one of the strings eventually gets too long,
and the prog can not compile without error.

I hope it gives you cool ideas, as it gave me.

feedback is welcome.

Hi all!

Short question:

I want to use the ASM instruction

move.w x(d1, a0),d0

where the effective adress is calculated like this
adress = a0 + d1 + x

a0 containes the base adress
d1 containes a variable offset
and x is an byte long constant.

in the manual for the 68k assembler is written that
the offset defined in d1 can be byte, word or longword.
But there is only one Blitz ASM command for that.
Which offset size for d1 does it use and is there a posiblility to
choose ?

IIRC you can you move.w x(a0, d1.l) (or .b or .w) to specify the size. It defaults to 
word size.

Subject: @{b}Shared Library in Blitz@{ub}

Hi all!

I want to create a shared library providing some
functions. Is is possible to do that in Blitz
(of course it is, but how ;-)

Lets say I want to do a library that provides the function

a.l = b.l * c.l and a.l = b.l / c.l


Am I right doing it like this:

_______________________________ snip!
JMP multiply
JMP divide
JMP more_functions
JMP ...

multiply:
Putreg d0,a.l  ; get the params from d0 and d1
Putreg d1,b.l
c.l = a * b
Getreg d0,c  ; store the result in d0
RTS

divide:
Putreg d0,a.l
Putreg d1,b.l
c.l = a / b
Getreg d0,c
RTS
____________________________ snip!

and simply compile this to an executable ?
Would this work or is there another trick ?

Ciao,

No, there are some special structures you need to include in a shared library. Sami Naatanen (I'm sure 
I spelled that incorrectly) sent some ASM code to the list a long time back showing you how to do it.

The original Blitz can't make shared libs at all, so the example is for 
assembler (I used PhxAss) not for Blitz.
Bernd will make a version that can be used to make shared libraries 
with AB2.

Of course I meant your version, but sent by David.

Hope that it will be possible soon to make
shared libraries, as it is kind of basic feature
that a programming language should have.
It should also be included in the official distribution.

How about implementing this as a feature in the compiler menu ?
Could work like this:

Menu:
compiler->create library

adds automatially library startup code, takes
the libname from the requested filename and turns
all statements and functions into the library functions,
in the order it is in the sourcecode.
global code that is not within functions will be ignored.
Additional it could generate a .fd file out of the
function names.
Or will it be too difficult and better do this manually ?

Ciao,

Thilo

The example I sent (it was Sami's code that I had converted to Blitz style ASM) should work 
when you do a create executable.

As for Blitz creating libraries, that would be cool. I guess it could be made simpler if 
the code which is generated for startup ATM is simply put into the LibOpen (well, not the 
open one, the one which gets called when the library is LoadSeg'ed into memory) routine and 
the exit code is put into the one for unloading.

Of course it may need some testing to make sure that there are no conflicts which would 
cause deadlocks (such as messing with ramlib).

And the programmer would need some care to make sure their procedures are re-entrant (I 
like Thilo's idea of making all statements/functions the library functions).

So I am confused now. Which example should I use ?
Sami's or Bernie's ?
What are the differences ?
I guess that Bernie added the code to be able to use Blitz
commands and vars within the library functions, whereas Samis
example does not install the a5 for Variables and so on.

Am I right ?

As making a library out of blitz statements is a very schematical task,
I guess it could be easily done by amiblitz itself, so you
avoid makeing mistakes cause the startup code is quite wired.
if it is done once correctly be Bernie)

Too much work. I think it is enough to have a example in the guide that show

Because you have same limits as C that you cannot sourcelevel debug libs so
you need switch the debugger to asm mode.

Its not for beginners and Sami´s example is enough for advanced Users.If
problems still exist ask me i can then update the docu interactive so that
it is better understand

From what I remember, Sami's code is simply an example of using Blitz to create shared libraries, 
but it is all in ASM.

Bernd's code shows how to use basic code (I do not know if that includes commands - I have not 
tried his example yet). It may not work with commands if the Blitz libraries need to allocate some 
stuff on program startup because that program startup code would not get executed when a library is 
loaded into memory.

However, I guess you could do it like e.g. Miami - you have a separate program which is run 
normally and then use MakeLibrary to create the shared library. Then you should be able to use 
normal Blitz commands as the normal program startup code is executed.

Feel free to correct me if I am wrong about the startup code - like I said, I have not tried 
Bernd's example yet.

It work with all AB2 commands
The stuff at programstartup is done with the
command
 initbasic
    in library open.
with
end noa7 you release the stuff (on library flush)

So you can use this libs with all languages

I add labels and more explain (this text)to the example soon.

You can get the example working like this:

compile
ownlib.bb2
1. This create the shared library in the libs: dir of the amiga
    Now you can use the library with whatever you want.
    If you wonder wy it is so large (34kb)keep in mind that all basic
librarys must add here too like real basic
    programs
    Soo for small libs best you use ncommands or no basiccode
Note:
The libname you use for the file and the libname in the source must EXACT
Casesensitive or it dont work
best you use small letters.

2. Do the all steps for adding amigalibs.
    Convert the  file own.fd with the AB2 newfdconvert.

    Note:
    it suggest as last libnum 217 218 219 Dont use this libnums
    For the example i use libnum 212 (all libnums >200 are free for private
use)

   I change the newfdconvert to not list this nums and do the defaultdir for
liboutput to userlibs/beta
 also libs in userlibs/beta should scan for clashes

3. for now you must set the outputdir to userlib/beta and make the file.

You need not to make a new deflibs.Only you to do is start AB2 again

Now you can load in the own_test.bb2
If the lame.... commands are tokenized all work ok

Hi,

I have the AmiBlitz2 distribution v2.25 (27th March 2002). Does this run on a standard Amiga 1200? I was mainly using Blitz Basic 2 but I thought it was time to give AmiBlitz2 a try. When I run it on a standard A1200 I get the message... No FPU found. Anyone?

You need an FPU because the editor uses it.

Hi !

 I'd need some ideas about programming a slot-machine in BlitzBasic
(just for fun). How would you code the gfx effect of the rolling
wheels ?

System friendly or in Blitz mode ?

System friendly I would open a window
and use my image.include for that.
Blit a picture all over the window that
defines the whole Slotmachine,
leaving the slots empty. (e.g. black)

You have to modify the blit command a bit to 
do clipped blitting. Maybe I will add this feature soon.
Than I would do a picture that shows all
Items in a column and blit a rectanglular
area out of this picture to the window at the
position where the slots are.


like this:

______________________ whole picure start
$$$
$
$$$
   $
$$$

XXX
XXX
------ visible clip start, offset within the picture
XXX
XXX
XXX

AAA
AAA
AAA
------ visible clip end
AAA
AAA
______________________ whole picture end

By changing the offset would "rotate" the slots. If you come
to the bottom jump to offset zero again or vice versa.

Ah, and dont forget that the first Item must be doubled at the
bottom to make the illusion perfect.

Ciao,

Thilo

Ciao Thilo Köhler,

 I'd like to use blitz-mode, because my project needs 9 wheels.

 Yes, that seems a good way. Which command should I use
to copy an area from a bitmap to another one (I mean Blitz-mode
commands) ?

 Thank you.

Hello Fabio

Use:

Loadbitmap 0,"mybground.iff",0  ; to load your background picture plus
palette
Loadbitmap 1,"myitems.iff"  ; to load your "stripe of items"

Use bitmap 0
Slice ...
Show bitmap 0

__Loop BEGIN
... manipulate y1 ...
VWait
scroll x1,y1,width,height,x2,y2,1
__Loop END



where 
x1 = 0
y1 = offset within your stripe bitmap (range from 0 to stripeheight -
visibleheight-1)
width = width of the stripe bitmap = visible width
height = visible height
x2 = x pos in your background picture, guess there are 3 positions for 3
slots
y2 = y pos in your background picture, should be the same for all 3 slots

hope this helps,

Thilo

 Thank you so much, I made a beta version and it seems to work great that
way.

 On 060/AGA (my system) I can have 6 wheels which scroll without flickering
(and maybe more, I havent tried). I was thinking, maybe should I use a
double-buffer to increase speed ? And what about dual-playfield ? So I could
have some gfx from the background cover some part of the wheels: it would be
great indeed.

Regards.

Doublebuffering does not increase speed, it gives only more visible
stability because you dont see how the next picture is draw. (= less
flickering)
I would not suggest playfields because you are limited to 8 colours (OCS)
and I dont see the advantage of it. What should the second playfield do ?
 
Ciao,

Thilo

You can gain some "speed" by using a method similar to double buffering.
Lets say you can scroll the bitmap with the wheels 32 pixels before you need
to re-blit new gfx. You show the same bitmap during the scroll, but break
those blits down per frame. Esentially, you have 32 frames for blitting your
images on to the bitmap that isn't shown. Then you swap bitmaps and begin
the process all over again with the other bitmap.

Yes, you could use a dual playfield as you describe. You would have, as an
example, the slot machine gfx on the front bitmap and the wheel gfx on the
back bitmap. Just remember you limit the number of colors you can use that
way.

 Please, can you explain better how all this should work ?

That is what I was thinking indeed. Though on aminet (games/misc/slots.lha),
I saw a program, which has such gfx-effect (little parts of the main
background cover the wheels) and it doesn't seem to use a dual playfield
mode (each bitmap is a 6-bit depth, that is 64 colours).

 Thank you.

Hello,

 I'm looking for an example source in Blitz about coding a slot machine
(with visual effects and so on) ? Maybe I'm wrong, but I think
to have seen such source once. Thanks for help.
