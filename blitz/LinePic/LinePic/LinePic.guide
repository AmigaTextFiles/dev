@NODE "Requires" "What this archive's contents require"

To read this guide file properly, you'll need a program that reads Amigaguide files,
like Multiview or Amigaguide.

To compile and read the BB2 tokenised source you'll need Blitz Basic.

To read the ASCII version of the BB2 source you'll need a text viewer capable of
reading normal text files, like More, MuchMore or PPMore.

To execute the compiled version of the source you'll need an OCS+ machine, like A500, A1200 or A3000

To email to the author you'll need a good EMailing-software, like YAM.

To get more info about BlitzBasic2 and to meet some other BB2 fans/coders, you'll need
to join the Blitz2-mailinglist at blitz-list@netsoc.ucd.ie by sending a message to blitz-list@
netsoc.ucd.ie with subject SUBSCRIBE.

Hmm... I think that's all that's required....;)))))

   I'm 15 years old boy (and only that; I still don't think I have "grown" in @{u}any@{uu} way;),
and I live in Imatra, Finland. Finland resides in Scandinavia, in the Northern Europe.
My Amiga setup is A1200, 030/50, 2 Mb/16 Mb RAM,MikroniK Z2 tower, Delfina DSP sound card, Acer 8x CD-ROM,
second disk drive, X-Link 33.6 modem, Amiga M1438S monitor, Wizard 560 DPI mouse and
Quantum BigFoot 2.5 Gb Harddrive.

If you want to contact me for programming advice (maybe bothways), project suggestions, or anything, write to:

I think that's about it really...  oh, I'm looking for an e-mail exchanger... if it
really means what I think it means (Sending mail to each other? Like an email penpal?).

@NODE "Info" "Information on this archive"

I tought I'd release this little example to the public. There were two
main reasons to do so:

1. To help some @{b}beginners@{ub}
2. To get some help from other Blitz coders.;)

As you may have noticed this Archive is directed to Blitz2 programmers, although
you can still read the ascii version of the source and execute the compiled even if you don't have Blitz2...
it's your own choice

  Well, it first initializes the screens and bitmaps, and things that have something
to do with visual, and then it creates a dummy (black) palette,and after that it will
init the sound, and then it goes to the main code. The main code loops checking every time
if the x,y or Joyb() values are the ones requested, if they are, then it acts as appropriate.
If the rows (y) are not the biggest+1(257), it then goes and draws all the grafix needed
to a spare bitmap. After it has drawn it, it marks a flag and returns. Then it checks if
the flag is marked, and if it is, goes and swapsbitmaps with one and the other and in the
middle showing the finished one. it waits for a Vertical Blank, and then it starts modifying
the other bitmap and returns. When all the graphics are drawn or mouse is pushed, it stops
the loop and waits for a mouse button or approximately 10 seconds and beeps every second
indicating that the program @{u}still@{uu} runs (it's amazing isn't it? My program and it works!!!;).

That's about. In the source the workings are described much sharply, this is just a @{i}brief@{ui}
overview how the program/example works.

@NODE "Thanks" "Greets and thanks go to..."

Thanks and greets go to (in random order(well, almost)):

  @{b}Thomas Biskup@{ub}
    For the greatest game ever made, @{i}ADOM@{ui}.

  @{b}Jochen Terstiege@{ub}
    For the Amiga version of the game mentioned above.

  @{b}Joni Lehto@{ub}
    For being a good SysOp

  @{b}Juha Hämäläinen@{ub}
    Without him I think I wouldn't have even seen an Amiga

  @{b}All the blitz-list guys@{ub}
    All the knowledge to program came from here (not exactly, but...;)

  @{b}The Coca-Cola Company and Paulig@{ub}
    Without these companies' products I wouldn't have been able to surf
    in the 'net all the night

  @{b}Acid Software@{ub}
    Blitz2 is the best language ever made!

  @{b}Scuba@{ub}
    I hope you don't mind me using your picture in this. But if you do,
    I can still get some other pics to use in the future versions of this GFX
    example, but make sure you inform me it too;)

  @{b}Anthony Sherrat@{ub}
    Keep working on Monty the Wolf, it looks and plays @{b}very@{ub} good...
    Have to register...;)

  @{b}Paul Burkey@{ub}
    WOW! I think you're some kind of a MacGyver of Blitzers... Foundation
    promises a lot, and I believe it keeps 'em, won't it?

And of course the greets and the thanks go to everyone I have forgot...

@NODE "Problems" "Some problems where I need your help"

Well, I have mainly two problems:

  @{b}1. How to get it faster?@{ub}
    Or is this the fastest method? At least I don't think so...

  @{b}2. How to make the pointer disappear?@{ub}
    I've tried making a dummy window in the displayed screen and
    changing the pointer and  making a window in the WB and changing the pointer,
    but I didn't get neither of 'em to work.

And there's one "minor" problem: the size of the excutable. I know this is because
of Blitz, but how could I make it smaller? I'd appreciate it if you'd send me help
about these things, among many others, to @{"me" link "Author" 0}.

@NODE "ToDo" "Future projects and plans"

I'm going make some improvements to the code, which include:

   @{b}* Flexible picture loader @{ub}
      This is easy to do...

   @{b}* Requester to load a pic @{ub}
      This is also easy to do

And these are my (future/present) projects:

   @{b} A Game @{ub}
      Don't really know yet what kind of a game, you could send @{"me" link "Author" 0} some
      suggestions...

   @{b} An Adventure Game/System @{ub}
      Well, this is only my dream, don't really think I can never do something like this,
      but I'm working on it!

If have some suggestions, please send the to @{"me" link "Author" 0}.
