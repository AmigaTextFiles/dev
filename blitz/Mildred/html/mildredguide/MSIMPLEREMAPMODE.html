<PRE>MSimpleReMapMode ;Returns value 6 which is `SimpleReMap' mode in blit modes (uses current 1-dimensional table)

For use with one of the `BlitMode' commands, as described more fully in the
documentation for MReMapMode. MSimpleReMapMode is similar except that it uses a
1-dimensional remapping table, comprising just 256 bytes, each byte representing
the value that the pixels in the destination (and part of the Shape's cookie)
will be changed to. This simple remapping is faster than the 2-dimensional remap
and does not take into account the source Shape data, except for its cookie which
it uses to mask the area that will be altered in the destination. The end result
is that the area in the destination, in the design of the source Shape's image,
will be remapped to new values. It is quite feasible to remap only certain
colours by ensuring that the colours to be protected in the table get remapped
without any alteration in value. MSimpleReMapMode will work with MBlitMode,
MQBlitMode, MSBlitMode, MQSBlitMode, and MMaskScrollMode.
