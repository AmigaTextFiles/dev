<PRE>MReMap [Colour#0.b,Colour#1.b,BitmapNum.w] *or* [RemapTable.l[,BitmapNum.w]] ; Remap #0 to #1 or with table

Remaps the colours in a chunky Bitmap's graphic from one colour to another.
You specify two colour numbers. Pixels of the first colour number (0..255) are
searched for and when found a replaced with the second colour number (0..255). So
all pixels of the first specified colour become the second specified colour.
There is an alternative set of parameters possible with this command in which you
specify the address of a remapping table and possibly also the number of a Bitmap
to use (if not specified it will use the currently used chunky Bitmap). The
remapping table should be 256 bytes, each byte corresponding to the 256 colours
of the graphic in the chunky Bitmap. The first colour value is read from the
Bitmap using a kind of `point' operation. The second colour value, which is the
colour it will be changed to, is then read from the remapping table relevant to
the colour that had been found in the Bitmap. ALL pixels in the Bitmap will be
remapped, although this can be cropped using the Bitmap's clip window with
clipping set to On for that Bitmap. You currently need to generate the remapping
table yourself.
