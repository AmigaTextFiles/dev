<PRE>MBlockUnQueue QueueNumber.w[,FirstItem.w,LastItem.w][,BitmapNumber.w];Block-UnQueue [range of] objects[&flush]

Block-UnQueues the specified Queue to the current chunky Bitmap. If the Bitmap
parameter is omitted a `clearscreen' operation will be performed (to current ink)
in all of the areas that have been recorded into the Queue list. If the Bitmap
parameter is specified a chunky Bitmap will be used as a background store, from
which the areas recorded in the Queue will be blitted to the currently used
Bitmap instead of just performing a clearscreen. Once all items have been
un-queued, the Queue will be completely flushed. If FirstItem and LastItem are
specified, a range of items in the queue will be unqueued. However, in this
case the queue will NOT be flushed, and an MFlushQueue will likely be needed at
a later stage. The width of items you place on the queue should be a multiple of
16, and their X coordinate should be a multiple of 16. MBlockUnQueue will not
check this so it is up to you to be careful in adding items to a queue. Note that
if you temporarily select `MCPU 3' or lower, an 030 routine will be used which
does allow you to ignore the alignment of the X coordinates, but still needs the
width to be a multiple of 16.
