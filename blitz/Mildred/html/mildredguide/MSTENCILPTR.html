<PRE>MStencilPtr [Xpos.w,Ypos.w][,BitmapNumber.w] ; Return address calculated using stencil [and coords]

Does the same as MBitmapPtr except with regards to the stencil of a chunky Bitmap
object or the stencil of the currently used chunky Bitmap object. The address
returned is based on the Bitmap's stencil data and possibly handle/origin, clip
window and specified Xpos,Ypos coords. This command can be used to allow you to
easily view a Bitmap's stencil with the c2p system.
