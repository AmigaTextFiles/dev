<PRE>MTable [(]TableNumber.w,SizeInBytes.l[)] ; Allocmem for Table list items

Initialises a new chunky Table object. The number of the table is specified with
TableNumber and you should specify how many byte of memory can be stored in the
table. This command is basically an elaborate form of memory allocation, but
holds some data which is needed by other parts of Mildred such as the MReMap blit
mode. One initialised the data in the Table will be nonsense, or possibly 0's.
If used as a function, this command will return the address in memory at which
the Table data is being held, which is the base address of the data.
