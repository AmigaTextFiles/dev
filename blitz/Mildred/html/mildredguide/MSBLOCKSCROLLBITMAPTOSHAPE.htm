<PRE>MSBlockScrollBitmapToShape X1.w,Y1.w,Width.w,Height.w,X2.w,Y2.w[,SourceBitmapNum.w];BlockCopy bm2sh&st2ck

Does the same as MSBlockScroll except that the source is a chunky Bitmap and the
destination is a chunky Shape. The chunky Bitmap's graphic and stencil are
block-blitted to the destination Shape's graphic and cookie, or the source
Bitmap's graphic is block-cut `behind' the cookie-protected areas of the
destination Shape.
