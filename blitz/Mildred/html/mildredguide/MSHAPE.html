<PRE>MShape [(]ShapeNumber.w,Width.w,Height.w[)] ; Allocmem for shape data

Initialises a new shape, which basically means that it creates a new chunky Shape
object. If Mildred's autocookie feature is turned on, a cookie for the shape will
also be initialised also. Width should be a multiple of 4. A chunky Shape object
contains graphics data (also cookie-data). If used as a function, this command
will return the address of the new Shape's graphics data or 0 for failure.
