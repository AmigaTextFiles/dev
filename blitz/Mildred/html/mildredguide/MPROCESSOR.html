<PRE>MProcessor ; Returns value 0..6 representing MC68000..MC68060 cpu according to exec\AttnFlags

Replaces the blitz instruction `Processor' to provide a function to return a
value representing what cpu the host computer has available. Values from 0 to 6
will be returned, representing MC68000 to MC68060 cpu's. Normally most of Mildred
will take any value &gt;=4 as meaning that special 040 only routines should be used,
where possible. The only difference is that the old `Processor' instruction did
not return values higher than 4, so it was not possible to detect the presence of
an 060 cpu. It is recommended that you use `MProcessor' in place of `Processor' where
possible. Also note that as of v1.36, Mildred will auto-detect the available cpu
using MProcessor and will set default values for MCPU and Mc2pCPUmode accordingly.
Care should be taken when choosing a cpu that is not the same as the cpu on the
host system, although this will not often be required or efficient.
