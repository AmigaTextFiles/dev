<PRE>MQDummy [Queue.w,]Xpos.w,Ypos.w,Width.w,Height.w ; Add an item to a queue without having to do a blit

Adds an item to the specified or currently used chunky Queue object, without
having to perform a blit operation. Width should be a multiple of 4. This command
allows you to add `items' to the queue to represent other kinds of blits which
are not directly supporting of the Queue system, such as the Tile and Scroll
routines.
