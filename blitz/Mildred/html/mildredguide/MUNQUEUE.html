<PRE>MUnQueue QueueNumber.w[,FirstItem.w,LastItem.w][,BitmapNumber.w] ; UnQueue [range of] queued objects [&flush]

Un-Queues the specified Queue to the current chunky Bitmap. If the Bitmap parameter
is omitted a `clearscreen' operation will be performed (to current ink) in all of
the areas that have been recorded into the Queue list. If the Bitmap parameter is
specified a chunky Bitmap will be used as a background store, from which the
areas recorded in the Queue will be blitted to the currently used Bitmap instead
of just performing a clearscreen. Once all items have been un-queued, the Queue
will be completely flushed. If FirstItem and LastItem are specified, a range of
items in the queue will be unqueued. However, in this case the queue will NOT be
flushed, and an MFlushQueue will likely be needed at a later stage.
