<PRE>MShapePtr [Xpos.w,Ypos.w][,ShapeNumber.w] ; Return data address calculated using shape [and coords]

Does the same as MBitmapPtr except with regards to a chunky Shape object or the
currently used chunky Shape object. The address returned is based on the Shape's
graphics data and possibly handle, clip window and specified Xpos,Ypos coords.
This command can be used to allow you to easily view a Shape's graphic with the
c2p system.
