<PRE>MSBlockScrollShape X1.w,Y1.w,Width.w,Height.w,X2.w,Y2.w[,SourceShapeNum.w] ; Block-Copy sh2sh and ck2ck

Does the same as MSBlockScroll except with regards to chunky Shapes. The chunky
Shape's graphic and cookie are block-blitted to the destination Shape's graphic
and cookie, or the source Shape's graphic is block-cut `behind' the
cookie-protected areas of the destination Shape.
