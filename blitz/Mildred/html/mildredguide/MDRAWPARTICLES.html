<PRE>MDrawParticles CoordinateList.l,NumPoints.l,Buffer.l ; Draw lots of previously grabbed points using a table

Performs a kind of `unbuffer' using a memory buffer (Buffer.l) of previously
created or grabbed pixels. The list, pointed to with CoordinateList.l, will be
read in reverse order, facilitating a stack rather than a queue system. This
allow this command to be used to correctly restore the pixels in the background
which were possibly trashed by other commands. It can also be used simply to
render a buffer of coloured pixels, perhaps representing an image, to locations
on the bitmap according to the X.w,Y.w, X.q,Y.q or Ptr.l coordinate list.
When MParticleMode is set to MSimpleReMapMode or MReMapMode, points will be
simple or complex remapped respectively. In MSimpleReMapMode, the buffer points
will be simple-remapped and then simply placed in the destination. In
MReMapMode, points will be complex-remapped as a combination of buffer pixels
and destination pixels. Please refer to MParticleFormat which you should call
before performing your particle operations if you want to be sure of the list
format.
