<PRE>MCludgeCookie ShapeNumber.w,Memory.l ; Cludge shape's cookie from existing mem

Once a chunky Shape object has been created you may wish to cludge a new cookie
from some existing graphics memory rather than create a new memory area for it.
This command allows you to do that. Your cookie data should be aligned to a
multiple of 16 bytes in memory. This is to provide proper support for block and
tile routies on 040+ cpu's. Please note to take care in cludging cookie data that
it shares the same linemodulo as the main image data. That is, if you cludged the
shape onto existing memory, or created it as a window within another
shape/bitmap and the width of the new shape is smaller than the original data,
there will be a `leftover' amount of bytes that have to be skipped each line.
This amount is the linemodulo, and in order to operate correct Mildred requires
that your cludged cookie data is created under similar circumstances, ie sharing
the same linemodulo. It is therefore in appropriate, for example, to make a shape
using MBitmapShape for a small area within a large bitmap, the cookie for that
shape must also be cludged within memory that is structured similarly to the main
data - ie taking into account any linemodulo the shape data has. Note, therefore,
that cludging cookies for shapes with linemodulo's larger than 0 must be handled
carefully, otherwise any masked operations/blits using the shape will not behave
as they should.
