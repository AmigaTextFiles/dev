<PRE>MSBlockScrollShapeToBitmap X1.w,Y1.w,Width.w,Height.w,X2.w,Y2.w[,SourceShapeNum.w];BlockCopy sh2bm&ck2st

Does the same as MSBlockScroll except that the source is a chunky Shape and the
destination is a chunky Bitmap. The chunky Shape's graphic and cookie are
block-blitted to the destination Bitmap's graphic and stencil, or the source
Shape's graphic is block-cut `behind' the stencil-protected areas of the
destination Bitmap.
