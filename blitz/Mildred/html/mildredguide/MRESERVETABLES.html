<PRE>MReserveTables [(]NumberOfTables.w[)] ; Reserve structure-memory for Tables

Allows you to reserve space for the structures of some table objects. It does not
allocate space for the actual table itself. A table object is similar to a queue
but generally contains a lookup table of byte data rather than information about
the position of areas to be unqueued. By default, 20 tables will be allocated,
meaning that at most you are allowed to create tables numbering 0 to 19. If you
want more tables than this then you need to use MReserveTables. Any pre-existing
tables will be erased before space for new tables is made. If used as a function,
this command will return the address in memory at which the table structures have
been allocated.
