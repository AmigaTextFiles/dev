<PRE>MUseShape MainShapeNum.w[,SecondShapeNum.w[,ThirdShapeNum.w]] ; Current Shape(s) to use

Allows you to specify one, two or three chunky Shape objects to be used as the
`current' objects. Once made current, an object can be `assumed' in later
commands so that it doesn't have to be respecified each time.
