Does the same as MSMaskScroll except that the source is a chunky Bitmap and the
destination is a chunky Shape. The Bitmap's graphic and stencil are mask-copied
to the destination Shape's graphic and cookie, or the Bitmap's graphic is
mask-cut `behind' the cookie-protected areas of the destination Shape's image.
