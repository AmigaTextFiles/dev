<PRE>MPlanar16ToBitmap BitmapNum.w,PlanarAddr.l[,OpWidth.w,OpHeight.w,PlanarWidth.w,PlanarHeight.w] ; Convert p2c

Converts an area of planar-format graphics data into a previously-created chunky
Bitmap object's graphic. The planar graphic should have contigous non-interleaved
bitplanes without a linemodulo and should have a width that is a multiple of 16.
If the destination chunky Bitmap is larger than the operation, or the source
planar `Bitmap' is larger than the operation, then you should use the long
version of this command and again the same rules about contiguous bitmaps and so
on apply. The operation width should be a multiple of 16, due mainly to the way
that the conversion handles words of planar data at a time (a word is 16 pixels
in planar). You should use PlanarAddr.l to specify the location of the topleft
corner of the planar graphic. If all goes well, the planar graphic (perhaps held
in a blitz bitmap object cludged onto pre-reserved contigous memory) will be
converted to chunky format and placed into the graphic of the specified chunky
Bitmap object.
