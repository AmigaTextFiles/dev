<PRE>MUseBitmap MainBitmapNum.w[,SecondBitmapNum.w[,ThirdBitmapNum.w]] ; Current Bitmap to use

Allows you to specify one, two or three chunky Bitmap objects to be used as the
`current' objects. Once made current, an object can be `assumed' in later
commands so that it doesn't have to be respecified each time.
