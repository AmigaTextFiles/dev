<PRE>MTile32x32Store [ShapeNumber.w,]Xpos.w,Ypos.w ; Block-blit 32x32 shape to 2 bitmaps, size 32x32, align x/y

Does the same as MTile32x32 except that the Shape's graphic will *also* be placed
onto the *second* currently-used chunky Bitmap's image. This is mainly so that a
background-store Bitmap can be created for use with Bitmap-based un-queue
operations. The Shape's cookie is not copied anywhere.
