<PRE>MParticleMode [([]Mode.w[])] ; MColourMode, MSimpleReMapMode or MReMapMode - to use in particle plot/draw

Allows you to choose a rendering mode for use in the particle animation commands.
Legal parameters are MColourMode, MSimpleReMapMode, or MReMapMode. The default is
MColourMode, which will cause things to behave normally. If a remappig mode is
chosen, the plot, draw, and grab&plot routines will behave differently. In
MReMapMode, the plot routines will take the `source' colour from the specified
colour or the current ink colour, whereas in MSimpleReMapMode it will just remap
the destination. The same applies to the MGrabParticlesAndPlot commands. The
particle draw commands such as MDrawParticles will output the buffer normally in
MColourMode. In MSimpleReMapMode they will simple-remap the buffer data and
output it to the destination, in which the data is NOT combined with the
destination. In MReMapMode the buffer data will be the source and the destination
data the destination for a normal 2-dimensional remap. If MParticleMode is called
as a function, it will return the number representing the previously set / current mode.
