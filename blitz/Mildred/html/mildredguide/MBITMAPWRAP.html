<PRE>MBitmapWrap BitmapNumber.w,On/Off ; De/Activate X&Y Handle-Wrap for Bitmap

Specifically turns the wrapping for a chunky Bitmap On or Off. When On, the
Bitmap's handle may be used in creating the address of part of a graphics
operation, typically when outputting to the Bitmap. This is mainly used for
scroll methods. Wrapping is used in probably all graphics operations in Mildred.
