<PRE>MQBlit [[Queue.w,]ShapeNumber.w,]Xpos.w,Ypos,w ; QBlit shape to bitmap, any coords

Performs a straight masked-blit of a chunky Shape into a chunky Bitmap to
coordinates Xpos,Ypos. If the ShapeNumber is omitted the currently used Shape is
used. The type of blit performed is defined with the MQBlitMode command. Normally
the Shape is simply cookie-blitted onto the Bitmap, with areas of Colour 0 as
transparent. Just prior to the blit being performed an entry is added to the
specified (or assumed) chunky Queue object corresponding to the area that the
Shape has changed in the destination Bitmap. This area can later be cleared or
restored using an un-queue.
