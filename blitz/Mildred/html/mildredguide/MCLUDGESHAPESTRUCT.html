<PRE>MCludgeShapeStruct [(]SourceShape.w,DestShape.w[)] ; Copy definition-data only

Creates a new chunky Shape object based on an existing Shape object. The existing
Shape's definition is duplicated into the new chunky Shape and the graphics and
cookie data are cludged to use the data that exists in the original chunky Shape.
Graphics and cookie data are not copied to the new chunky Shape. If used as a
function, this command will return the address of the new Shape's graphic data,
or 0 for failure.
