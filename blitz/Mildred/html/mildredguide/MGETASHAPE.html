<PRE>MGetaShape ShapeNumber.w,X.w,Y.w,Width.w,Height.w[,Block?,StencilIsCookie?] ; Grab shape from bitmap

Grabs a new chunky Shape object from a previously-created chunky Bitmap object.
The chunky Shape is created of the dimensions specified (Width must be multiple
of 4) and then the Bitmap's graphic is copied into the Shape. If the `Block'
parameter is set to True or On, a block-scroll type of grab will be used, for
which the Shape should have a width that is a multiple of 16, and the Shape
should be grabbed from X coordinates that are multiples of 16. You can also
specify to use the Bitmap's stencil as the cookie, in which case the relevant
portion of the stencil will be copied into the new Shape's cookie. The end result
is a new, standalone (non-cludged) chunky Shape.
