<PRE>MAddToParticles CoordinateList.l,NumPoints.l,IncA.l[,IncB.l] ; Add [two sets of] increments to particle list

Processes a list of X.w,Y.w, X.q,Y.q or Ptr.l coordinates as pointed to by
CoordinateList.l, adding X.w,Y.w, X.q,Y.q or Ptr.l increments to each pair as
taken from the list pointed to by IncA.l. The increments list should contain
pairs of words, quicks or a mem pointer which are amounts to be added to the
X and Y components or the Ptr.l in the coordinate list. The end result is that
the particle locations are moved. The increment list could be a set of carefully
worked out `adders', or perhaps a list of precalculated random numbers. This
command does not render any particles, it simple moves them. If a second
increment list is specified its X.w,Y.w, X.q,Y.q or Ptr.l values will also be
added to the particles. Please refer to MParticleFormat which you should call
before performing your particle operations to be sure of the list format.
