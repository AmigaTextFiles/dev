<PRE>MMakeCookie [FirstShape.w[,LastShape.w]] ; Make a cookie for a shape, range of shapes, or all shapes

Initialises (if necessary) and generates cookies for a specific shape, a range
of shapes, or all shapes. If the cookie doesn't yet exist it will be allocated.
The cookie will be generated based on the contents of the Shape's image. If
the parameters are omitted, all currently created chunky Shapes will have
cookies generated. The area of a Shape used to make a cookie can be cropped
using the Shape's clip window. If a second parameter is specified you can make
cookies for a range of shapes.
