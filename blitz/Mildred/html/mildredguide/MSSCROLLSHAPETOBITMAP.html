Does the same as MSScroll except that the source is a chunky Shape and the
destination is a chunky Bitmap. This is effectively the equivelent of an `SBlit'
of a Shape to a Bitmap. The Shape's graphic and cookie are copied to the
destination Bitmap's graphic and stencil, or the Shape's graphic is cut `behind'
the stencil-protected areas of the destination Bitmap's image.
