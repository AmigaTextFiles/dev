<PRE>MShapesBitmap [(]SourceShape.w,DestBitmap.w[)] ; Copy definition-data only

Creates a new chunky Bitmap object based on a previously-created chunky Shape
object. The information for the Shape is copied into the Bitmap and then the
graphics are cludged. The Shape's cookie will be used as the new Bitmap's
stencil. The Shape's graphic and cookie are not copied. This command takes
advantage of the fact that, internally, chunky Bitmaps are 100% interchangeable
with chunky Shapes. If used as a function, this command will return the address
of the Bitmap's graphics data, or 0 for failure.
