<PRE>MMaskScrollShapeToBitmap X1.w,Y1.w,Width.w,Height.w,X2.w,Y2.w[,SourceShapeNum.w] ; Copy shape to bitmap & cut

Does the same as MMaskScroll except that the source of the operation will be a
chunky Shape and the destination will be a chunky Bitmap. The Shape's image will
be blitted to the Bitmap using the Shape's cookie as a mask. This does
effictively the same as a normal `Cookie Blit' of a Shape to a Bitmap.
