<PRE>Mc2pCPUmode CPU.b ; Set cpu c2p uses. Use `Processor' or MProcessor. &lt;4=030-, &gt;3=040+

Use this to set the cpu to which the c2p system should be targetted. Use the
blitz `Processor' instruction/token as the parameter, or the new MProcessor
command. Values of 0,1,2 and 3 represent the 68030-optimised routine, and 4 or
6 represents the 68040+ optimised routine. You should set the cpu mode for the
c2p system before performing a chunky-to-planar conversion, although Mildred
will set the default cpu to use according to what cpu is available at runtime.
The c2pCPUmode is seperate of the general cpu mode (see later). Mc2pCPUmode
affects all c2pWindows that you use because it alters which routine the
conversion process uses at all times. It is perfectly safe to use the 040+
c2p routine when the user does not have a processor of that specification, but
there may simply be a loss of efficiency.
