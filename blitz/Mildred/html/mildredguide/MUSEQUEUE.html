<PRE>MUseQueue MainQueueNum.w[,SecondQueueNum.w[,ThirdQueueNum.w]] ; Current to use

Selects which chunky Queue object to use as `current', and also second and third
`current' Queues. These current Queues will be assumed later so that you don't
have to keep specifying which chunky Queue object(s) to use. Usually only the
main (first) Queue is used.
