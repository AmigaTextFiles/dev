<PRE>MQueue [(]QueueNumber.w,NumberOfItems.w[)] ; Allocmem for Queue list items

Creates a new chunky Queue object. The Queue is initialised so will be empty.
Once created, you can start to add items to the Queue using the various `Q'
blits. Only as many items as you specify are allowed to be added to the Queue
before it will become full. If used as a function, this command will return the
address at which the chunky Queue structure is stored, or 0 for failure.
