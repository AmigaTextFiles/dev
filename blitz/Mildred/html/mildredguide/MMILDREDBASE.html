<PRE>MMildredBase  ; Returns long address of the base of Mildred's internal data area

Using this command you can obtain the address in memory at which Mildred's
internal data area is stored. The internal data area is built into the library
so it will not fluctuate at runtime. Using this command you can pass the base
address to your own custom library so that you can access Mildred's data from
your custom routines. Note also, library programmers, that it should be possible
to obtain this base address by specifying that you want it as part of the !libs
macro for a given token in your library header. I'm not sure what you should call
the lib, perhapas #MildredLib. In the event that that method doesn't work or is
unreliable, MMildredBase can be used to feed the base into your library, which it
can store somewhere internally, which may actually be the preferred method. Note
also that Mildred's internal data area isn't much of a `structure' so is liable
to possible changes in future versions.
