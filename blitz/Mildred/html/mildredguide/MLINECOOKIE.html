<PRE>MLineCookie [Xpos.w,Ypos.w,]Xpos2.w,Ypos2.w[,Colour.b] ;Draw a line from X1,Y1 to X2,Y2 in a cookie, Col or 0

Does the same as MLine, except that the line is drawn to the cookie of the
currently used chunky Shape, and the colour drawn will /represent/ the
specified colour or ink.  If the drawing mode is
set to MReMapMode or MSimpleReMapMode with the MDrawingMode command, MColourMode
will be used instead as it is illogical to try to perform remapping to the
cookie.
