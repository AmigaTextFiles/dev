<PRE>MInk MainColour.b[,SecondColour.b[,ThirdColour.b] ; Set what colour to assume as currently used. 0..255

Sets the currently used colour so that graphics operations can assume it rather
than you having specify a colour for every call. The colour should be from 0 to
255 inclusive. The ink colour will be used for a variety of operations, but note
that clearscreen operations (MCls) will always assume a colour of 0 as that is
more logical. The ink colour, prior to being defined by the programmer, will
default to 1. If you specify SecondColour and possible ThirdColour these will be
stored as the secondary and third colours to assume, although will not be used in
most operations.
