<PRE>MGrabParticlesAndPlot CoordinateList.l,NumPoints.l,Buffer.l[,Colour.b]; Grabs points to buffer & plots table

Does the same as MGrabParticles, at the same time as doing the same as
MPlotParticles. As each particle is grabbed from the currently used chunky
Bitmap, according to the list of X.w,Y.w, X.q,Y.q or Ptr.l coordinates listed
as pointed to by CoordinateList.l, pixels in the currently used Ink or the
specified Colour will be plotted to the same coordinates. This facilitates a
kind of `buffered plot' system whereby the background is stored using the grab
and then pixels rendered using the plot. Buffer.l points to the buffer memory
to which the background pixels will be grabbed and NumPoints.l specifies how
many points will be handled. If MParticleMode is set to MSimpleReMapMode or
MReMapMode, pixels will be simple or complex remapped respectively when they
are plotted. If MReMapMode is chosen, the source colour will be taken from the
specified colour or ink. In MSimpleReMapMode the destination pixels will be
simple-remapped regardless of specified or currently used colour. Please refer to
MParticleFormat which you should call before performing your particle
operations if you want to be sure of the list format.
