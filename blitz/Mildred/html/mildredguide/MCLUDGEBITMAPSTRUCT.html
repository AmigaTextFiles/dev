<PRE>MCludgeBitmapStruct [(]SourceBitmap.w,DestBitmap.w[)] ; Copy definition-data only

Creates a new chunky Bitmap object based on an existing Bitmap object. The
existing Bitmap's definition is duplicated into the new chunky Bitmap and the
graphics and stencil data are cludged to use the data that exists in the original
chunky Bitmap. Graphics and stencil data are not copied to the new chunky Bitmap.
If used as a function, this command will return the address of the new Bitmap's
graphic data, or 0 for failure.
