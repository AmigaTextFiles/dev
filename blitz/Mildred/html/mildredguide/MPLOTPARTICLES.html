<PRE>MPlotParticles CoordinateList.l,NumPoints.l[,Colour.b] ; Plot lots of points from a table of positions

Performs multiple Plot operations to the currently used chunky Bitmap, in the
current Ink colour or the specified colour. CoordinateList.l should point to
memory containing a list of coordinates. The coordinates should normally be within
the bitmap's dimensions. The list format depents on the setting made with
MParticleFormat and can be X.w,Y.w pairs, X.q,Y.q pairs, or Ptr.l actual memory
addresses. The total number of points that are to be processed is passed as
NumPoints.l, and notice that this is a longword value and allows for more
particles than you probably have the memory capacity for, although there is a
limit of about 2^29 particles. Coordinates are taken from the list and the
pixels are plotted to those locations on the bitmap, in the colour being used
or specified. When MParticleMode is set to MSimpleReMapMode or MReMapMode,
points will be simple or complex remapped respectively. In MReMapMode, the
specified colour or ink will be used as the source. In MSimpleReMapMode the
destination pixels will be simple-remapped regardless of the specified or
currently used colour. Please refer to MParticleFormat which you should call
before performing your particle operations if you want to be sure of the list
format.
