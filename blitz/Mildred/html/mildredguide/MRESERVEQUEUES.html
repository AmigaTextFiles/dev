<PRE>MReserveQueues [(]NumberOfQueues.w[)] ; Reserve structure-memory for Queues

Before using any of the queue-related commands you need to call MReserveQueues in
order to allocate space to store the basic information needed for some chunky
Queue objects, unless making use of the default reserved Queue objects. This
does not allocate any space for storing actual items onto the Queue, for which
you need to first create a chunky Queue object. Once reserved, Queue numbers
will range from 0 upwards. If used as a function, this command will return the
address in memory where the chunky Queue structures are stored, or 0 for
failure.
