Draws a line in the specicied colour or ink, starting at Xpos,Ypos and ending
at Xpos2,Ypos2 in the currently used chunky Bitmap. If Xpos,Ypos are omitted,
the end coordinates of the previously drawn line will be used, allowing you to
easily draw a chain of connected lines (a polyline). See also MDrawingMode for
further details of the drawing modes that are available.
