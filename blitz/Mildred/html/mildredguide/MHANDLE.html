<PRE>MHandle ShapeNumber.w,XOffset.w,YOffset.w ; Set handle of Shape

Sets the handle for a previously-created chunky Shape object. This is the
coordinate offset that is added to the coordinates that you may specify for a
blit-operation later on. These coordinates are also used by Mildred's wrapping
feature to provide the offset of a sliding window relative to the base of the
Shape's image and/or cookie.
