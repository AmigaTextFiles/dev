<PRE>MAutoBitmapWrap On/Off ; Auto X&Y Handle-Wrapingp for Bitmaps

Turns the autowrapping feature of Mildred for chunky Bitmaps On or Off. Generally,
if the Bitmap is the destination in a graphics operation, the Bitmap's handle will
be added to the output coordinates (and applies at all times even when output
coordinates are not specified). When wrapping is on, the base address will have
an offset added to it to represent the handle coordinates, before the
graphics-operation is performed. This causes the graphics-operation to output
into possibly unreserved memory and Mildred does not check for this so be very
careful to allocate a memory area to move into (make the Bitmap big enough). This
command turns the automatic wrapping On or Off which means that when a new chunky
Bitmap is created, the `wrapping' flag for the Bitmap is activated to indicate that
the handle will be used in the operation. Wrapping has been implemented mainly to
better support sliding windows in memory for scrolling.
