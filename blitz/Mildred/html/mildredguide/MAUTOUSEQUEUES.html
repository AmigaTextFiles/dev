<PRE>MAutoUseQueues True/False ; Automatically `use' new Queues. &lt;&gt;0=True

If set to True/On, any chunky Queue objects created in future will automatically
be `used' as the `current' main chunky Queue object. Other commands can then use
this to `assume' which Queue you are referring to so that you don't have to keep
specifying it each time.
