<PRE>MBitmapShape [(]SourceBitmap.w,DestShape.w[)] ; Copy definition-data only

Creates a new chunky Shape object based on a previously-created chunky Bitmap
object. The information for the Bitmap is copied into the Shape and then the
graphics are cludged. The Bitmap's stencil will be used as the new Shape's
cookie. The Bitmap's graphic and stencil are not copied. This command takes
advantage of the fact that, internally, chunky Shapes are 100% interchanageable
with chunky Bitmaps. If used as a function, this command will return the address
of the Shape's graphics data, or 0 for failure.
