<PRE>MBitmapPtr [Xpos.w,Ypos.w][,BitmapNumber.w] ; Return data address calculated using bitmap [and coords]

Returns an address based on the specified chunky Bitmap object. If a Bitmap
object is not specified, the currently-used object will be used. The address is
calculated by taking the base address of the Bitmap's graphics data. If the
wrapping feature is switched on for the Bitmap, the Bitmap's origin/handle will
cause an offset to be added to the address to represent those coordinates. If the
clipping feature is switched on for the Bitmap, the top-lefthand coordinates of
the Bitmap's clip window will be added to the address also to provide an offset
representing that location. Finally, if you have specified Xpos and Ypos these
coordinates will also be added to the address to represent the memory location of
that location. The final address is then returned and is of particular use for
the `Chunky.l' parameter of Mc2p.
