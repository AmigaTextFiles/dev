<PRE>MQSBlock [[Queue.w,]ShapeNumber.w,]Xpos.w,Ypos.w ; QBlock-blit shape 2 bitmap, Xpos&width mult of 16

Does the same as MSBlock except that an item is also added to the specified or
currently used chunky Queue object to represent the area that the blit has
changed on the Bitmap's graphic. Note that areas of the Bitmap's stencil are not
accessible by the queue system so when performing an SBlit or SBlock with
SBlitCut Off, changes made to the Bitmap's stencil will be permanent.
