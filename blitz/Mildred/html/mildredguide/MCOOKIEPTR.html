<PRE>MCookiePtr [Xpos.w,Ypos.w][,ShapeNumber.w] ; Return address calculated using cookie [and coords]

Does the same as MBitmapPtr except with regards to the cookie of a chunky Shape
object or the cookie of the currently used chunky Shape object. The address
returned is based on the Shape's cookie data and possibly handle/origin, clip
window and specified Xpos,Ypos coords. This command can be used to allow you to
easily view a Shape's cookie with the c2p system.
