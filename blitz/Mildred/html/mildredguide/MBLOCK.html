<PRE>MBlock [ShapeNumber.w,]Xpos.w,Ypos.w ; Block-blit shape to bitmap, align Xpos and width in multiples of 16!

Performs a straight unmasked block-blit of a chunky Shape into a chunky Bitmap to
coordinates Xpos,Ypos. Xpos should be a multiple of 16 and so should the width of
the Shape. If the ShapeNumber is omitted the currently used Shape is used. This
command performs only a solid `replace' blit and does not use Colour 0 as
transparent.
