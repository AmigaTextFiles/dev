<PRE>MQBlock [[Queue.w,]ShapeNumber.w,]Xpos.w,Ypos.w ; QBlock-blit shape 2 bitmap, align Xpos & width in mult of 16

Performs a straight unmasked block-blit of a chunky Shape into a chunky Bitmap to
coordinates Xpos,Ypos. Xpos should be a multiple of 16 and so should the width of
the Shape. If the ShapeNumber is omitted the currently used Shape is used. This
command performs only a solid `replace' blit and does not use Colour 0 as
transparent. Just prior to the blit being performed an entry is added to the
specified (or assumed) chunky Queue object corresponding to the area that the
Shape has changed in the destination Bitmap. This area can later be cleared or
restored using an un-queue.
