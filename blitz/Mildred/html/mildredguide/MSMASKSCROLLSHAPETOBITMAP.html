<PRE>MSMaskScrollShapeToBitmap X1.w,Y1.w,Width.w,Height.w,X2.w,Y2.w[,SourceShapeNum.w] ; Cook-Copy sh2bm&ck2st

Does the same as MSMaskScroll except that the source is a chunky Shape and the
destination is a chunky Bitmap. This is effectively the equivelent of an
`SMaskBlit' of a Shape to a Bitmap. The Shape's graphic and cookie are
mask-copied to the destination Bitmap's graphic and stencil, or the Shape's
graphic is mask-cut `behind' the stencil-protected areas of the destination
Bitmap's image.
