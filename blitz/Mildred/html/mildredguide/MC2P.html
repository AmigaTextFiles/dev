<PRE>Mc2p [[c2pWindow#.w],Chunky.l],Planar.l ; Convert chunky to planar (Use Mc2pWindow first)

Performs a conversion of data from Chunky format to Planar format. Chunky.l
points to some chunky-grahics data and Planar.l should point to some
planar-graphics data. The planar data, probably held in a normal Blitz Bitmap
object or pre-reserved memory area, should be non-interleaved and all bitplanes
should be in strictly contigous memory and should not have any line modulos,
otherwise the conversion will appear to produce faulty output. Data is read in
from chunky (fastram) and output to planar (chipram) with conversion on-the-fly.
If you omit the first two parameters (ie omit Chunky.l), the chunky address will
be found based on the current chunky Bitmap object's data, and also the Bitmap's
handle if Mildred's wrapping feature is active, and also the Bitmap's clip window
topleft corner if the Bitmap has clipping active. See the `Wrap' and `Clip'
related commands. Note that Chunky.l and Planar.l basically represent the top-left
corner of the area to be converted and it is with this that you can position the
source and destination operations. See also the BitmapPtr and related commands.
It is highly recommended that output from the c2p (Planar.l) is aligned to the
nearest 4 bytes, ie 32 planar pixels, or the routine will suffer slowdown. Also
try and use the highest possible fetchmode in your display. Also note that if the
c2pWindow you use for the operation has no linemodulos, that is that the source
and destination are the same width so as to be solid interrupted blocks of
memory, then the c2p system will detect this and perform an optimised c2p routine
which should be a few fps faster than if you had linemodulos or differing widths.
