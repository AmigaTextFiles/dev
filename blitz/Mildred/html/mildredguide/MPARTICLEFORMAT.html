<PRE>MParticleFormat [(]Format.b[)] ; Set particle lists/operation format. 0 = X.w,Y.w, &lt;0 = X.q,Y.q, &gt;0 = Ptr.l

Using this command you can tell the library the format of your particle lists.
Specifying a value of 0 indicates that you store your particles as pairs of
X.w,Y.w coordinates. If you specify a value less than 0 (perhaps -1) then the
system will consider your particles to be stored as pairs of X.q,Y.q coordinates
in which each particle consumes 2 longwords (the amount of mem needed to store
two `quick' values). If you specify a value greater than 0 (perhaps 1) then the
system will consider your particles to be stored as a single Ptr.l for each
pixel, which is an actual memory address. Particles will be grabbed, drawn,
plotted to or added to this exact address. You should call MParticleFormat before
proceeding to call any other particle commands otherwise the system will default
to assuming that you use X.w,Y.w pairs for each particle.
