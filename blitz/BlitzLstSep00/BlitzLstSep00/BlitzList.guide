                          Blitz Mailing List Guide
                          ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@netsoc.ucd.ie>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@netsoc.ucd.ie>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@host.domain", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@acc.umu.se or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

I might still have 'em somewhere, but if it's not too much trouble, could
you send 'em over anyway...more for completeness' sake than anything else ;)

  You'd be better off using my UDP funcs (see my URL) for net game
programming, as TCP can be much slower- it depends what sort of game
you're using- you may have problems with a fast action game- you'd have
to do some testing.

Subject: @{b}Amiga Developer list.@{ub}

Hello,

I've been asked by the moderators of this list to plug it on here, in case
anyone is interested. Sorry for the ubiquitous plug :-0

AmiDev is a place where Amiga coders, in any languages, can ask questions
and hopefully receive answers. It also runs projects which are designed to
improve your understanding of programming, so it's a list for the complete
novice as well as an expert coder.

I used to be on it, but unsubscribed for no real reason :-) It was a good
list while I was on it, but I just unsubscribed.

If you want to subscribe, send a blank e-mail to
amidev-subscribe@egroups.com

Cheers,
GazChap.

I wrote something similar a while back, only it done
it on the Workbench screen. If I can find the source
for it I'll pass it on to you.

Really simple too.  It was called CoolButtons and found on...  no, not

In any case, if I remember correctly, the code was pretty messy if you

to write it yourself =]

Not having DOpus, I'm not sure. However, if it is doing this, then it sounds 
like the problem Amorel was having with the windowtitle function - in that 
because you've used a temporary string (i.e. just doing "blah") and the library 
would seem to not take a copy and just use the string straight away it "loses" 
the correct string.

> Is there a way round this?

Try using a string variable:

appname$="My Appicon :)"
appfile$="blah.info"
If AddAppIcon(0,appname$,appfile$)=0 Then End

If that still doesn't work, you could use the OS functions directly ;) That 
would have the benefit of using OS3.5 functions too, since they aren't 
supported by any library I know of.

Hi,

Firstly, thanks for all your help with the listviews ;)

I'm using the RIAppLibrary's AddAppIcon command to (rather obviously ;)
create an AppIcon. For instance

If AddAppIcon(0,"Name","File")=False : End : Endif

Is there a known problem with this commnd under DOpus, because a few lines
after the AppIcon code, I open a file to read from it, and in DOpus, the
AppIcon inherits the name of that file for some bizzare reason.

Is there a way round this?

Also, try this on a non-essential file! It's *meant* to set the default
tool, but it's quite likely it doesn't work (I can't tell, because in WinUAE
it just deletes the icon, but that might be cos of WinUAE's slightly odd
handling of files, due to Windoze' filing system)...let me know, will ya?

Subject: @{b}ASL Font Requester@{ub}

Hello!

I am using the blitz's ASL font requester. It works fine except for one
detail. My program can make use of color fonts, but the available sizes of
those fonts are not visible in the font requester. It's not a big problem as
the user can still select the requested size even without seeing the
available ones but it would certainly look better if those sizes could be
displayed aswell.

Is it possible to make the ASL font requester show the colored fonts as well
as the normal ones? How?

Kind regards

Actually, it should work, but...

What if our friendly other music makers fail to use the audio.device, but use
their own (usually nasty) code. One thing at least I know you cannot do is 
read from the address in memory where the sound is sent to, for some cheeky
reason it is write-only (cos it's not memory, but the sound chip, but still 
VUMeters would be so much easier if you could read from it :).

About opening devices: I tried to kill the input-device (which worked!) and
then start a new one (which did not work, and so left me with a computer
without input :). It seems to be pretty hard to properly open a device, but
maybe the audio-device is different, and easy :)

that should show you how to not play if the audio device is already in

you'll probably need to cut'n'paste that page then unbase64 it.

Hello!

You might remember that a few days ago I wrote to this list with a problem
of CopyShape command trashing the shapes when they are too big. After the
resposes to this list I investigated the problem further and found out that
it was indeed a problem of overflowing the allbpmem value which is a word. I
wrote a replacement for the command (stil have to do it for the Scale
command) and I'd like you to test it. It works fine on my system in my
program but I'd like to be sure. It's used just the same as the original
command is.

if so, then rotation is easy, just multiply your speed by the sine of the
angle your car is turning (ie, if your wheels are at 5 degrees from center,
		the new speed should be sin(pi*2*(5/360))*oldspeed.

now i'm no math wiz :) so it could be you need the cosine (cos) instead,
anyway you need the one where function(90 degrees) = 0

Not sure this works accurately, or well at all, but it's the way i would
start.

  So, you've got the basic s=vt, velocity working. Ie: you're starting
with a simple linear velocity simulation. Next you want to put in a
constant linear acceleration. So s=vt + 1/2at^2, with a being a
constant.
  Then to be more realistic you need the Force and Momentum equations-
next you need to change it all to Rotational force and momentum, so you
need the mass, and radius of your Rotor. 
  Then you want to add in the change in acceleration (Impulse if I
remember- forgotten the formula :)

  Hope this helps- give us a yell, if you need more details :)

> Could you not just subtract each value that you have
> to work out the rate of change?

I'm doing that just now to calculate the speed, acceleration and third
derivative (of position). I must be doing something wrong, as it doesn't
look like what it should (I have graphs here showing the expected output
for certain inputs that I ain't gettin).

I was just wondering if anyone had anything that worked. It doesn't need
to be mathematic, just more realistic than the crap simulation I am using
now (which is the only way I've got it to work so far).

speed = input_voltage
position = position + speed * time_step_size

So it doesn't take any kind of friction or inertia into account so it
pretty much sucks :)

Thanks though.

Could you not just subtract each value that you have
to work out the rate of change?

For instance, say the speed of the motor gives you a
value of 134 and then 234, your rate of change would
be 100.

I used something similar in a project that I was doing
for college (I've just passed it today, :D ) where I
had to trigger an event whenever the rate of change in
a signal was over a certain value.

Hope that helps.

Francis.

Wait Top Of Frame I think (picky or what eh? ;)

And I thought that was the one that didn't work on some GFX cards, cos
they were missing an interrupt, or maybe it was some versions of CyberGFX
didn't support it. WaitBOVP_ was the one I thought worked, although
WaitTOF_ is the better function (since WaitBOVP_ does a busy-wait loop).

Just use something like:

    repeat
        ev.l=waitevent
        keycode.s=ASC(inkey$)
        WaitTOF_
    until ev=$400

If you add #IDCMP_VANILLAKEY to your window, detect for those events, you can 
then use EventCode to get the ASCII code. Note, this only works for the vanilla 
coloured keys (i.e. letters, numbers etc), you'll still need to use RAWKEY for 
things like shift, etc.

Note2: Escape key will return ASCII 27 from a vanillakey event. Return might 
return ascii 10 or 13, or maybe it still gives rawkeys. I can't remember.

Set up an array of ASCII codes and use the key value as an index.
You'll have something like this:

ASCII = keyarray[keycode]

This is probably really obvious, but when I'm scanning for a keypress event

I've tried EventCode, and it just returns the decimal equivalent of the

From what others have said, it seems it's some kind of icon loader for 3.5
icons? I can't help there, but these sources load "normal" icons (and if
NewIcons is running, NewIcons get automatically remapped)...

You'll need Blitzlibs:amigalibs.res and Blitzlibs:bb2objtypes.res as well
for the TABB one...

I don't know where you're getting your information from (and as I've never 
tried this with OS3.5 icons I might be wrong) but normally the GadgetRender 
field points to an Image newtype, and not a chunky thing (even though OS3.5 
icons are stored internally as chunky images, they get decoded when loaded).

You'd need to do something like this:

WBStartup
*myicon.DiskObject=GetDiskObject_("amiga:christmas-look")
If *myicon
  WbToScreen 0:WBenchToFront_

  Window 0,0,0,160,160,$1800,"",1,2:rp.l=RastPort(0)
  ; If you have OS3.5 and have converted the OS3.5 icon.library .fd file,
  ; you can use DrawIconStateA_ here.
  ; For non-OS3.5 programs you can use DrawImage_ (or DrawImageState_)
  ; and use *myicon\do_Gadget\GadgetRender as the Image pointer
  While WaitEvent<>$200:Wend
  FreeDiskObject *myicon
End If
End

Hehe...I understand :)...as I said..t`was my fault because of the time when

did actually allocate the whole 4mb at init? Just curious :)

No, Dave's saying that all the memory for all the items in the list will get 
allocated when you Dim the array - and so if you have each item in the list 
containing 1000 longs, you will be allocating 1000 (for the number of items in 
the list) * 4 (sizeof.l) * 1000 (number of longs in each item of the list) 
which gives 4000000 bytes (3.8Mb ish).

Use Dave Newton's DLL stuff (on Blitz-2000 and Aminet) or do it manually, using

uhm, the overhead should be just 1000*4, as you can get to the longs by addig X (=4??) bytes to the base for every long you want beyond the first one.

Ofcourse this is only true if they programmed it well :)

Umm..I`m not sure about that...I think that would be true for say strings,
but if you try


newtype .silly
  lotsoflongs.l[1000]
end newtype

dim list dave.silly(1000)

should allocate atleast 3.8mb for just the longs, nevermind the overheads
(1000*4*1000)...I think so anyway..mind you it`s 4am :)

Actually, that's not strictly true (At least I don't think it is).

DIM List Fred.Tyep(2000) actually allocates 2000 headers and the
actual data is allocated by the AddItem() call.

Make sure you're typing "dim list ..." rather than "dim ...". That's an

That's the theory for linked lists, but I don't believe blitz2 works that
way.
In my project I use eight different lists. To initiate each list, I
dim(ension) them.
If I insert two high values in the dim-command (which should be useless with
lists), the program refuses work because "out of memory" before there is
anything stored in any list...

David is right, as usual.  But he forgot to point out what I think is the
real answer to your question, the part about Dim'ing the list.

Lists are NOT treated the same as a standard array, so the normal method is
to simply Dim the list to a value much larger than you ever expect to use,
then add the items as needed.

For example, if I was expecting to have a maximum of 50 ~ 100 items in a
list, I would Dim it to say 2000, or so to be safe...

The key point is that the list will NOT waste any memory on the unused
items - it only sets aside the memory for each item when it is actually
added to the list, whereas Dim'ing a standard array DOES set aside the
entire memory for the number of items requested, right at the start.

I'm not sure what's happening, but attached is a failed attempt to put
listview stuff into functions (it worked, it was just too cumbersome)...look
at the ChangeList () and other functions, which should help you on your way!

Also, for anyone interested, there's a new WinUAE at
http://www.vintagegaming.com/emulist.phtml?emuarchive=amiga (it's listed as
"V0.8.15 (Unofficial)", but the author note says it was done by Brian King,
who's the main WinUAE author...I haven't tried it yet, so I don't know

I just went and had a look. Basically, some guy has compiled the main UAE 
(0.8.15) into the WinUAE source. He's put Brian King's name down as main author 
since he didn't change much of the Win32 stuff.

However, it sucks ass! It won't even boot here, moans about setpatch not being 
executable. Went back to the old version (0.8.8) and its all working perfectly 
again.

Hmmmm.

Nononononononono. The whole point of lists is that you do not need to increase 
the size (unless of you course you *really* mean to increase the size of the 
list), you just add and remove items from the list.

i.e. to add another thing to the list you would do:

If AddItem(guilist()) Then guilist()\entry = <whatever>

> Dim List guilist.lview(count+1) : ResetList guilist()

If you reeeeeeeeeeeally need to do this then you need to copy all your data out 
of your list before you re-Dim it and then copy it back, otherwise the list 
will be empty, or full or crap.

Dunno about better, but the correct way is this:

> GTChangeList 0,1

; (Add|remove|kill|burn) items, do whatever you want to the list here

> GTChangeList 0,1,guilist()

And now it should show the new list data.

> What do I do?

Do it properly. Even the manual, BUMs, and online help all explained 
GTChangeList I think.

Hi,

I'm getting a bit annoyed by a GTListView I'm using in a program.

Basically, I've got

NEWTYPE.lview
    dummy.w
    entry.s
End NEWTYPE

Dim List guilist.lview(count)        ; count is usually between 5 and 10
ResetList guilist()

This works. I can use that list in a GTListView.

It's when I want to add something to guilist() and update the listview that
is all goes wrong :) What is the correct way to do this? I obviously need to
increase the size of the linked list, so do I just do

Dim List guilist.lview(count+1) : ResetList guilist()

or is there a better way? If I do it like this, then add all the data into
the list again, including the new piece of data. Then, I do

GTChangeList 0,1
GTChangeList 0,1,guilist()

but the top few entries in the list are made up on 'non-printable'
characters (y'know what I mean? :) and stuff. I once had one of the entries
replaced by 'exec.library'.

And it's annoying me now :)

What do I do?

This is how I did it in Crazy 8's  -  it's actually much better, since you
(or anybody else) can edit them with a normal text editor.  It also allows
the user to change to any language they like at any time without messing
with their system locale prefs.

Hey, so do I! But I'd say don't use them -- they're WAY more trouble than
they're worth...just use ASCII text files with each translated word on a
different line, a separate file for each language (if you use the official
Amiga language names (eg. deutsch, sveska(?), etc), there's a function in
StatsFuncs.lha on Aminet/dev/basic/ that tells you the user's language

Define it in your  main code and then SHARED inside functions as
required.   As far as I can tell there are no true Global Variables in
Blitz.

The Blitz Compiler does this.    Load up your BB2 file and use the
Project/Save ASCII meun item.     A CLI program wouldn't be too hard
to create by butchering Investigator, but unless you want to do lots
of them, the manual way would work.


Hope someone else can answer the others.    Probably can, they are a
pretty bright bunch here you know :-)

Do you mean in your own window, or some other program's window?

If you mean language catalogs,
I have some functions by James Boyd for doing this from our BeatBoxII
program.

You must mask out the channel(s) that you want to play the sound on.

On my website you can get the source for my Crazy Eight's game, which shows
how to do this by temporarily masking out the sound channel only when the
sound is playing.

> 6)How can I declare GLOBAL variable ?

You can't.  The workaround is to "share" the variables that your function
needs to access.

If you have the BlitzSupportSuite, there is a command to get the program's
name when it is run.

If not, there is a function to do this in James Boyd's  StatsFuncts  file in
Aminet/dev/basic/

Unless you have a very old version of Blitz, there should be a menu option
to do this with any source you have loaded.

If your version does not have this, you can try selecting the entire
program, then use "Save block as" from the menu - this is always in plain
text.

Have alook at dir2html source on Aminet. The catalog bits use the OS
routines, but I don't think there are any Blitz routines for doing any of
this stuff (that are any different from the OS routines). The other way
you could do localisation is to have separate text files for each
language, each string being a separate line in the locale file.

in the main body of the code, define a variable. in each

PS, the window pixel problem you should be able to use:

col.w = ReadPixel_(RastPort(num),x,y)

where col = colout number into the palette of the pixel, num = window
number, x,y = co-ordinates of the pixel.

Hi James,

Here is a working version of the screen mode requester demo.

You can put it on the site - I'll probably upgrade it later, but for now, it
does work.

You'll need to use the Demo version though, as the keypress commands seem to
have gone back to standard ascii values...

Oh, I also included a grab if you want to use it.

And no, don't ask for any more things to be added to it, unless it's bugged

A PowerUp card will never approach 060 speeds, the lack of L2 cache
seriously hampers the emulation. It should fly on something like an
AmiJoe, if it ever happens.

I haven't tried it, but it got a good write-up in Amiga Active...they
compared a few operations against an 060, and it did fairly well,
considering it has to emulate the 68060 as well as do the actual work!

Most of the operations were won by the 060, but it beat it on a couple of
them, but I think that's cos those tests involved parts that weren't yet
ported to MorphOS...once they do that, it ought to kick the 060's ass :)

It didn't beat the 060, in *any* of the tests. The tests it won were
those using PowerUP software, which tended to run slightly faster with
MorphOS.

680x0 software ran at around 040/25 speeds.

Maybe it's one of those 'plug in your CD-audio' bits?

You put the motherboard in between such a metal, and

Hi,

as some of you may know i've been trying to piece back my Amiga 1200 from its

One looks like a kind of diskdrive bit, but I have no idea WHERE on the

The other piece is a folded bit of metal with a screwhole in it. 

Anyone have any idea where they go? Please tell me :)

I had that briefly with this -- make sure you've got your UAE screenmode
matching your Amiga Screenmode prefs -- if you see what I mean ;)

I think that's all it took...excecpt I do have to run it full-screen now, or
it's screwed up (I did run full-screen before, but wanted to go to windowed
mode)...check both full-screen boxes in Display...

BTW Seems faster to me, at least in opening drawers and stuff...

It's not the WinUAE gui, it's everything on the Amiga (only when using a P96 
screenmode, not a native one). It all worked fine on 0.8.8r8 and I've tried all

The only things that get drawn are the window borders and borders for

Just try my text converter on Aminet (util/conv). It is called WoW and convert
Ww6 to Rtf format (without images for the moment). It can do much more ...

And I started it with Blitz :) Now in C.

Sorry for the off topic post.   Please reply privately.

I'm trying to send a PC owning friend a letterhead created with WW6.

It consists of a picture (Cool linked to the file), a text frame and a
couple of lines of text in the main body of the file.

If I try to save it as a RTF file or a WordPerfect 5.1 file, only the
couple of lines of text are saved out.

Does anyone know how to convert a WW6 file to MSWord, PDF or anything
else a PC owner could use.   I guess having the picture embedded in
the file might be a start, but what about the text frame...

Thanks and apologies again for the OT post.

From: Emanuele Cesaroni <emacesa@tin.it>
Date: 09-03-00 12:54:17
Subject: @{b}Picasso96 problems.@{ub}

Hi coders.

I have a big problem with Picasso96. I alloc some bitmaps by
graphics.library/AllocBitmap() then i do some blit operations on them as
normal copy and masked copy using graphics.library/BltBitMap() and
graphics.library/BltMaskBitMapRastPort().

Well, sometimes, above all when i have a lot of applications running, i get
my programs screen corrupted.
I think this happens because Picasso96 found the graph board without phisic
mem available, and does some buffering operations in fast mem to solve
memory limits, without show a classic error message as, "not enought video
mem".

I tryed to modify the settings of Picasso96, for example disabling "planes
to fast", but the problem is still present, so now i think Picasso96 does
this actions normally, so do you know a way to force picasso96 don't to
share the phisic mem in board?
I tryed the flag BMF_USERPRIVATE in p96AllocBitMap() but i have still these
problems (and if i have understand well, by that flag, p96 allocates bitmaps
in fast mem).  

Thank you, and bye.

Emanuele.

Date: 09-29-00 00:34:53
Subject: @{b}QNX available!@{ub}

   The QNX RTP, is now availible for free download from
http://get.qnx.com . It is available in the base 24.1 meg version,
which installs as a hard file on Windows, and a version for Linux will
be available soon. Extra files/programs can be downloaded off the net
using the package filesystem that comes with it, or from
http://qnxstart.com .
   Also, you can download the 91 meg iso image to burn to a CD with
everything on, which can install as in the 24 meg one, and can also
install to a partition. 

;******************************************************************

Developers Can Now Get QNX® for Free

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SAN JOSE, ESC Show, September 26, 2000 - The moment eagerly awaited by
over
45,000 pre-registered developers and enthusiasts is here: This morning,
QNX
Software Systems officially released the QNX realtime platform on
http://get.qnx.com. Starting immediately, anyone can download the entire
platform for evaluation, prototyping, personal use, or other
non-commercial
purposes at no charge.

"Today marks two firsts in the embedded industry," said QNX CTO Dan
Dodge.
"To begin with, the QNX realtime platform is the only solution to
combine
the reliability, speed, and small footprint of an RTOS with all the
benefits
of a platform OS: low cost of entry, friendly self-hosted environment,
plus
tools and POSIX APIs familiar to thousands of developers.

"Second, QNX is the only major OS vendor to give away its entire
technology
suite free to anyone who wants it for non-commercial purposes. The new
Get
QNXT program will make it much easier for developers to join the
fast-growing QNX community, and much easier for our OEM customers to
leverage a large base of knowledgeable developers."

A Complete Distribution
The free download is a complete, fully functional distribution of the
QNX
realtime platform. It includes the full suite of QNX OS modules
(microkernel, file systems, networking, etc.), a GNU toolchain, a
code-generating application builder, the Photon microGUI® windowing
system,
Internet and multimedia applications, hundreds of utilities, plus source
code for many applications, drivers, and libraries.

Third Parties Get with the Program
The free download also includes a variety of software from third-party
vendors, including: Glide 3D API from 3dfx, scalable fonts from
Bitstream,
ICA client from Citrix, RenderWare 3D toolkit from Criterion, Quake III
Arena demo from id Software, Flash Player from Macromedia, and
RealPlayer
from RealNetworks.

Partners Join in
Several of QNX's key alliances have also joined in, by serving as active
members of the platform's beta program. According to Jim Colson, lead
architect for appliance software at IBM's Pervasive Computing Division,
"With its POSIX APIs, open architecture, and rich multimedia
capabilities,
the QNX realtime platform will serve as an excellent development
environment
for the emerging Internet appliance market. Furthermore, it will enable
developers to build reusable, standards-based, and network-deployable
components that can run on various devices, including mobile phones,
PDAs,
Internet-enabled vehicles, set-top boxes, and residential gateways."

Productivity First
Dan Dodge explained the QNX realtime platform was designed with one
overriding goal: to significantly improve the productivity of embedded
developers. "Besides providing immediate access to a complete OS and
suite
of development tools, the QNX realtime platform offers extensive memory
protection to speed up debugging, POSIX and Linux APIs so developers can
leverage existing code, and, most importantly, a self-hosted environment
that eliminates the need to build a separate target system developers
can
develop, debug, and test embedded applications right on their PCs."

Modular Packaging, Easy Installation
The QNX realtime platform auto-detects a PC's hardware, making
installation
a snap. Plus, it can be installed on an existing Windows system no need
to
create a separate partition.
The download itself comes in distinct packages that the developer can
pick
and choose from, using a convenient package installer. This modular
approach
makes for faster downloads and simplifies the process of installing new
or
upgraded components.

Once the platform is installed, the developer can visit the QNX
Developers
Network (http://qdn.qnx.com), a web site filled with useful services,
including a searchable knowledge base, FAQs, bug reporting, and more.
Plus,
the QDN contains a public newsgroup where anyone can discuss the QNX
realtime platform, ask questions, and help others.

CD Available
The noncommercial version of the QNX realtime platform is also available
on
CD, for US $29.95. To order the CD, visit http://get.qnx.com.

ISV Program in the Works
QNX also announced it will launch a special program for independent
software
vendors (ISVs) who want to develop applications for the QNX realtime
platform. The program, to be unveiled later this Fall, will include
special
discounts on commercial development licenses.

About QNX Software Systems
Founded in 1980, QNX Software Systems is the industry leader in
realtime,
microkernel OS technology. The company has established a strong customer
base in a variety of industries, including telecommunications, consumer
electronics, transportation, medical instrumentation, process control,
and
point-of-sale. QNX products are distributed in over 100 countries
worldwide.

The new local vet, nick knight, got into old Daisy up to their elbow.
Inside the found Questions at last.

> When I load more than one bitmap it say "only availible in

Thats happening because you are using the command LoadBitmap after you
have called the command BLITZ in your souce. Perhaps not actually after it
in terms of source code, but in terma of the instructions executed.

> How do I load a bimap on a graphics card (800x600)

You can still use LoadBitmap, but you'll probably need to open a screen
and window then blitz the bitmap to the window.

> I want to start making a simple a simple shoot em up, so how do I go
> about doing it ?

Decide whether you want to use hardware bangin commands or OS stuff. Make
crappy example graphics. Make a simple program that show shapes on a
screen or display (OS display or hardware display). work out a way of
getting input. work out a way of upadting positions of player and enemy
craft. update positions. repeat until player dies. ;)

> Why is the blitz maual so lame !

Because a programmer who was deeply rooted in 68k asm wrote it.

> (I hope you dont mind all the questions)

Makes a welcome change, eh Chris? ;)

You can use wider bitmaps, but I'm not an expert about those OS scrolls, so I
don't know how, but AD's with includes should
point you in right direction. OS screen's can't scoll part's of screen
efficiently, but using blitter it can be done.
Display lib can scroll even independet scanlines if you want. This is made using
the custom copperlist instructions, but I have only done this using
independent asm program, so don't know how to do it using those custom cops.

After using the code snippet you suggested everything is working like a
charm.

Thanks.

You could use ShapesBitMap and then use the Blitz bitmap structure (it is 
compatible with the OS structure).

However, if that doesn't work due to the same problem with Scale, you could do 
this:

; need amigalibs.res and bb2objtypes.res
DEFTYPE.BitMap bmp
*s.shape = Addr Shape(x)
bmp\BytesPerRow = *s\ebwidth
bmp\Rows = *s\pixheight
bmp\Depth = *s\depth
For i.w=0 to *s\depth-1
    bmp\Planes[i] = *s\data + i * *s\ebwidth * *s\pixheight
Next

I think that should do it.

Hello!

I am trying to write a replacement for the Scale command which trashes the
image when scaling big shapes. After browsing through the autodocs I found
the BitmapScale function which I'd like to use for this purpose.

To use it, I need the data in the OS Bitmap struct (newtype if you want).
Could anybody please tell me how to get the image data from Blitz's Shape
object to the OS Bitmap structure and back?

Kind regards

A good trick with Blitz is to type random words and see if they
tokenize.    Then hit help and try to figure out what they do. :-)

To sort lists using a string as the key you need to use StringSort.  
The syntax is StringSort List(), sizeof .Type, Offset
Or something like that.

I used to use it before I converted to DLL, so I know it does work.

Subject: @{b}SortList@{ub}

Hello,

OK, I'm using Lists and I need to sort the directory names I'm reading
in, in alphabetical order.  SortList is absolutely useless.  =]

The manual doesn't give enough info...  so far my code is something like
this:

-=-

NEWTYPE.mynewtypestructure
  firstword.w
  dirname.s
End NEWTYPE

error=AddItem(entry())
\firstword=SizeOf.mynewtypestructure ; This is what the manual tells me
to do?

While MoreEntries
  If AddItem(entry())
    ifdirectorynamethenshoveitintothisentry{}
    \firstword=Peek.w(&\dirname) ; This gives me a two digit numerical
value to sort the title under
  EndIf
Wend

SortList entry(),entry(0)\pad

-=-

As far as I know this code is OK.  But SortList doesn't change the order of
anything.  Am I doing something wrong or is the command screwed, in
which case, anyone got a replacement?

Also, upon further tinkering, AddFirst doesn't work?  I'm using it the same
as AddItem (with an ItemStackSize of twice the capable size of the list)
but it just adds it to the end of the list like AddItem does.

Help!

Kind regards

well the chr$ code you can pick ALL ISO-LATIN chr$ codes using this small proggy:

for i=0 to 255
  nprint "Here is the char ->"+chr$(i)+" And it has CHR$ code: "+str$(i)
  if (i mod 20) = 19 then mousewait ; or was it waitmouse ?
next i

Well you surprisingly should get this information from the MANUAL :)

qualifier or similar which gives a bit pattern about those
qualifier keys: capslock, ctrl, left shift, left amiga, left alt, right shift,
right amiga, right alt

And tab, return, esc, function keys etc you can read using rawkey

If you meant chr$ code for shift or alt then there isn't any, because those are
qualifiers and don't have any outprint.

I've checked the archive that comes with toolbar class.

in c you've to write something like:


 DoMethod(TB_Bank1, MUIM_Toolbar_Notify, NEW, MUIV_Toolbar_Notify_Pressed, False,
   app,    2, MUIM_Application_ReturnID, MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit);


and in bb2 I think

MUIDoMethod   4,#MUIM_Toolbar_Notify,1,#MUIV_Toolbar_Notify_Pressed,True,1,2,aa,1

This does't work 4 me. I've tried a lot of times without any success... I
wish better luck to you :-)

   Maybe other people here know how to make a full workin toolbar [I hope

Hi amorel

Not having looked at it, but I think it's probably because the OS routines 
which are called from the windowtitle function require that the strings stay at 
what they are all the time. The reason for the garbage is probably because it 
is using a local variable.

You could try changing it to a global variable and using "SHARED" inside the 
windowtitle function.

Goodday

I`ve just tried the windowtitle funcion of statfuncs and it seems to be not
too good. I use it to change the title of the screen after I opened a window.
That works well but when I access the menu the title I gave is gone and also
the windowtitle is gone. Actually the screen title went to "font" which makes
me suspect it just grabbed whatever garbage was wherever ;-) Also when you
click out of the window, thus making it inactive, the same thing happens,
though that "font" word didn`t appear anymore, which seems according to what I
suspected ;-) It`d be nice if changes would be permanent until changed again
:-)

Btw Curt Esser thanks for that fixed gtlib now I can use shape gadgets in a
decent manner =) I`ll be trying that dll stuff soon.

Hi all,

Sorry if this is semi-OT! Do any other WinUAE users find that the Blitz
Debugger draws its windows/gadgets *really* slowly when you compile & run?
Everything's fine after that...it's weird...

See ya,

I found that always happened on the older version anyway. Sometimes went like a 
greased weasel on subsequent compile & runs though. Probably due to the fact 
that with the REDDebugger, the debugger is a separate program which gets run 
via a "stub" debugger for the first time, and then sits in memory until you 
quit it (there's usually a REDDebugger window on the WB). Maybe the stub 
debugger calls one of the OS routines which UAE runs very slowly, like maybe 
setting itself up as a trap/exception handler or maybe the call to create a new 
process is slow.
