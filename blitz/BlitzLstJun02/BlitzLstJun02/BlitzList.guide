						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

@NODE "mail_0" " Amiblitz bug "
From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 06-06-02 01:53:12
Subject: @{b}Amiblitz bug@{ub}

Hi there,

I have a proggy which uses the include from the newicon.library. Using Amiblitz
I get an error saying that {} are not allowed in library statements, but there
aren't any:o/

An extract with the line producing the error is:-

Function.b NIBOpenIcon{NNum,NPath$}
  SHARED *NIBStruct(),XPath$
  If Right$(NPath$,5)=".info"
    XPath$=UnLeft$(NPath$,5)
  Else
    XPath$=NPath$
  EndIf

  *NIBStruct(NNum)=wbmessage(&XPath$) ;<<<< Error Here
  If *NIBStruct(NNum)
    Function Return True
  Else
    Function Return False
  EndIf
End Function

This happens with Amiblitz 2.24 and 2.26. Blitz 2.21 compiles correctly.

Any ideas?


All the best



Steve

wbmessage has no Parameter in the latest AB2 deflibs (Press help to see)
Maybe you use a diffrent deflibs in AB2 and BB2.On my system it fail on on
BB2 too

From what library wbmessage come ?

I think a wbmessage with paramter seem newer version

Hi there, Bernd

On 07-Jun-02, you said:

BR> Maybe you use a diffrent deflibs in AB2 and BB2.On my system it fail on on
BR> BB2 too

It seems you're right. With a different deflibs it works fine. Oddly, my
compiling without debugger enabled has gone too, but I don't know why. I didn't
do anything to fix it - it just vanished. Ah, well. I'm not going to lose any
sleep over it. Everything seems to be working again, now.

BTW - just had a first look at AB2.26 - Much better. I'm far more comfortable
with proper syntax highlighting. Any chance of getting a full config in place
for it (so that I can select which items are highlighted in which colours -
similar to Golded)

There is one other longstanding AB bug, bit I'll mail you privately regarding
it, since I'll need to send you a couple of window grabs to show you what I
mean.

Regards



Steve

It is fully configurable with the tooltypes you can set which pen a
highlight use (function=9)
use pen 9 for functions.
I give all Highlights a own pen by default in the tooltype so you can change
your prefered colors
in the color prefs as you like

The simplest way would be to use the NClipboard library. However, there is also an archive
on Aminet which should show you how:

ZClipBoard.lha     dev/basic    2K 242 Routines to read/write strings in clipboard

The Bank() command simply returns the address of an initialised bank, so in
effect if you used:-

InitBank x,len
BLoad f$,Bank(x)

it's the same thing. I'd go with using Bank() everytime. It helps avoid typing
errors.

To answer the second part, you need to allocate the memory to use, eg...

memaddress.l = allocmem (size,memtype)
bload f$,memaddress
;do something
freemem memaddress,size

InitBank does the same thing - reserves the memory. Memtype can be either 0

FreeBank x does the Freemem_ bit.

AFAIK the syntax of some of the commands changed..I had the same problems
too.

Wish I had a working miggy beside me right now, so this answer is from my
bad memory !

Most of the commands now need their parameters in brackets,
so MUIOpenWindow 0 is now MUIOpenWindow(0).
Also, it seems some commands give a return value so you may need to try
success.l=MUIOpenWindow(0)

If this works, could you send me a couple of bottles of Radeghast..I miss
the stuff ;)

A HAM image is in 16 colour format, or 256 colours for AGA HAM. So it`s
either 4 or 8 bits.

I`m sure it is doing it as if you are viewing a 16 or 256 colour animation
or picture. I doubt it`d look good and my quick guess is that to see it in
HAM the only thing you need to do is open a HAM screenmode, but there
might just be additional stuff to be done in order to see it properly.

Huh? What are talking about ? A Ham 8 can have as many colors as a 24bit
picture. And a ham 6 has 4000 odd colors or so. HAM (hold and modify)
Its in the DPaint manual I think :)

How do I save a ham image stored in a BitMap as an IFF file with the correct palette. It seems to me that blitz cant tell the difference
between a 256 color image and a Ham8. And when I do save the image the
color palette is screwed.

I think amorel was right. You should look in the rkrm or in the amigaos
devkit for further intructions about the ham format. But i'm not so sure
about the ham8 to be 8 bit deep. I thought it, but after trying a mui
screenmode prefs replacement, i found out that it opens a 64 colours (6 bit)
screen to visualize ham8 graphics...boh?
I cannot tell you more because i'm too lazy to search in the devkit :)

As I said before, you should look in the rkrm or in the amigaos devkit, and
i don't know if you can use the blitz's bitmaps for this. Maybe you must use
your own (or amigaos) bitmap. The blitz's bitmap lib is outdated now.

HAM8 uses 8 bit planes. 6 bitplanes are used for the base colours (and that is why you get a 64
colour palette) and the modify values, the 2 remaining bitplanes are used for the control
(normal, modify red, modify green, modify blue.

Normal HAM is similar but uses 6 bitplanes (4 for colour, 2 for control).

Well, the bitmap isn't really the thing which stores whether it is a HAM image or not, it is the
screenmode. Of course, it would be nice if you had a flag in a bitmap saying it should be used
with a HAM screenmode, but I'm not sure if SaveBitMap would do that.

You could use SaveScreen (IIRC) but that has problems when you use interleaved bitmaps on your
screens.

I thought I had some examples of HAM displays (Blitz mode only though, and not saving) but I
cannot find them.

Yes Ham8 & Ham6 do use 8 & 6 bitplanes respectively. That part seems
to be ok.

LoadBitMap and RIAnimInit have a palette object # and the picture or
frames palette should be loaded into that, but the correct palette isnt being saved when I use the SaveBitMap command for some reason.

How have you created your palette? And as I said
before, I'm not sure if SaveBitMap saves the screenmode
part of the IFF properly (i.e. so that when you read it
in again, the other program recognises it is a HAM
image), because the Blitz bitmap object does not have
any screenmode related stuff in it (it certainly does
not have a flag saying it should be saved as HAM).

Yes you are right. SaveBitMap does not save the screenmode part of the
image. However the palette information is correct. I proved this by
converting one of those saved bit maps top another picture format
(ie. png & jpg). When I viewed the converted picture the palette &
display were infact correct. :) Now I've just got to work out on how
to detect when it is a ham & how to save it as a ham. However the ham part is not as critical now. Thanks for
sheding some light on the subject for me. :)

Hi there,

OK, I had a couple of ideas after replies to my recent post re search algorithms
that I thought I'd try - BUT I CAN'T :o(((((

Whenever I compile I run my code my system crashes. This happens with all
versions of my code (Including known working and stable versions).

I've tried with the original Blitz (clean installation), AmiBlitz 2.24 and
AmiBlitz 2.26 - all the same result.

If I run through the debugger, I get random crashing during a variety of MUI
object creation commands. Without the debugger, I'm getting Address Violations,
Illegal Instruction and other (unknown - since my system falls down before the
debug - not debugger - window opens) Guru's.

MuForce doesn't report anything untoward (Tho' it may just not have a chance),
nor does SnoopDOS.

Thinking that this may be an OS3.9 BB2 problem, I reverted to my last working
(as far as Blitz is concerned) setup - no change.

I also randomly get drive processes crashes (DH0: DH2: RAM:) and ramlib
crashes/errors.

To add to the confusion, a compiled version of my code done previously runs
without problem, indictating that something is going wrong at compile time.

I've tried with my orig DefLibs, a later DefLibs that I created, and Dave's
DefLibs - all the same.

I re-iterate - this is happening with unmodified versions of known to be good
code.

Given the apparent random nature of the crashes, it's impossible to pin it on
any one instruction/sequence of instructions.

I CAN compile short programs that use the more basic commands, tho' even some of
them are exhibiting similar behaviour unless the Run time debugger is switched
on.

I suspect something to do with MUI as the main culprit, but since a previously
compiled version works, I can't be sure.

Does anyone know what may be causing this and how to stop it?

All the best

I think it is the MUI lib thats the culrpit. I've had similar problems many
times before but I'm afraid I can't remember for the life of me how I fixed
it. I think I re-installed Blitz :(

I've no idea what cuases it either, perhaps there is a lib number clashing
or something.

Hi there,

OK - There is a libnum clash. EFMUILib is at lib number 8 which is used by
Acidlibs. The only way to change the number is to recompile the source, which
uses constants such as #word. However, #word gets tokenised. That's not the
only one, either. I found the values of the dodgy constants, amended the code,
and recompiled to libnum 6 (which is free here). This worked, but some of the
MUI tokens are no longer recognised by the compiler (the editor gets them,
though).

So, I tried a completely different deflibs, with no library clashes at all
(efmuilib at libnum 8) - and still I get the crash when I run the compiled exe.

I'm still convinced it's an EFMUILib problem, so if anyone else knows why, and
how to fix, I'd be most grateful.

All the best

Well, I don't know what's causing the errors you're having, but you can
definately change library numbers without recompiling anything. I'm not sure
which library managers support it (except mine, and it has its share of
problems.)

In davidsdeflibs 8 is efmuilib (see the libnum textfile).What acidlibs you

Which acid library is that?

If you changed the library number, the editor should *not* still tokenise them (unless you
saved as ASCII first, but then it should pick up *all* the commands). The editor and compiler
use the same library files, so it sounds like you migt still have the EFMUILib#8 installed.

Well, if it was compiled with a broken deflibs, changing deflibs will not change an already
compiled program.

Subject: @{b}Is this a bug@{ub}

Hi there,

Remeber I said I had a problem with executables compiled without the runtime
debugger enabled crashing, but running fine and without errors if the debugger
was enabled. Well I think I've found the cause.

Whilst developing my programs, and during test runs from the editor, I of course
enable the debugger and make use of the"Stop" command so that I can selectively
trace execution of small parts of my code whilst leaving the rest to run at
full speed.

If I forget to remove the "Stop" command before compiling the full executable,
it'll Guru at the point where the "Stop" command is.

I was under the impression that "Stop" was a compiler directive, and should
simply be ignored if the debugger is disabled, but this seems not to be the
case.

Removing the "Stop" stops the crashes in the final compile.

All the best

I think Stop is a command from one of the debug libraries. However, you should not be able to compile
programs which contain the Stop command and the debugger is turned off - you would normally get a
message saying "Runtime debugger needs to be enabled for Stop" or something similar.

AB2 allow this because if you use other tasks or so you can catch the task
with post mortem debuggers
If you see a trap #10 message it is a stop command.

BTW: MCP let you continue the program

I think about only using it in this way with optimize 4 (newsyntax mode)

Is this ok ?

Probably a good idea, since it would help avoid the situation Steve found. I don't think I would
have figured it out (because I am so used to getting the error if I leave Stop in by mistake).

Which explains why I didn't get the error - just the guru. I don't use MCP,
Bernd - I found it unstable here, and so opted for MultiCX instead. Besides,
the proggy is for distribution, and I'd hate to make MCP a pre-requisite to
using it.

Perhaps a warning at compile time if an exe has been made with no debugger and
stop, then the author could remove it and re-compile if he really doesn't want
it before running (like me)?

From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 06-23-02 03:36:43
Subject: @{b}MUI - Arexx command@{ub}

Hi there,

I'm trying to add a command to the MUI Arexx port for one of my programs,
using:-

MUIAddApplicationTags #MUI_Application_Commands,cmd(0)

but I can't get it working.

If anyone has managed to do this, can you go through filling the MUI_Command
structure and receiving a notification (without having to change my
MUIWaitEvent to a Wait -  ev.l=MUIEvent structure if possible) so that I can
react on it.

The command is simple, requiring no parameters, and so should be able to be set
up with #MC_TEMPLATE_ID rather than setting up a hook.

Anyone?

I want to do it this way since the command is strictly related to the MUI
elements, and I don't really want to have to set up a public msg port.
(Basically, it's for a daemon running in the background to be able to intercept
a CX_POPKEY event and pass it to my program). The program that will finally
react on the event is not a commodity. The message is, quite simply, "front".
Unfortunately, the MUI rexx command SHOW doesn't pop a window to the front - it
only uniconifies an iconified application. I want to be able to pop it to the
front - which is easy enough IF I can get the message :o/

Ta muchly.

All the best

PBM format's does not use any compression so it's probably not for the

Oh and there should be information that you never should make your task
priority higher than input-handlers priority is, because it will kill the
input event generation. (This does not count tasks that do Delay_(XXX)'s

I can't guarantee this, but would IND_ADDHANDLER (input.library) allow you to

From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 06-06-02 17:43:39
Subject: @{b}Re: Recovering my sanity (was I'm going slightly mad)@{ub}

Hi there,

I finally found the problem - and it was in my code - but it took a hell of a
lot of finding, and I didn't put it there.

Anyhow - a call to GetDiskObject_ had become a call to FreeDiskObject_ (used for
the MUI AppIcon). Since I've been using an ascii version of my code recently
(and usually do whenever I change deflibs) I assume that this got changed some
time ago, perhaps after a rogue entry got into deflibs. I don't know. And why
this should manifest itself in other parts of the code, that do nothing at all
with the DiskObject I don't know.

I found it whilst trying some re-arranging of the code to cure the problems I'd
been having, and just happened to spot this odd entry. I could go in to the
full tale of how I finally found it, but I won't bore you. Suffice to say, it's
taken three days to find a command that I never put there in the first place
:o)

I did, however, notice that I never freed the DiskObject myself, so why previous
versions have been stable is beyond me, too. Anyway, I've fixed that, too :o)

Now another, slightly less destructive problem (because there is a workaround).
If I compile my prog with the runtime debugger enabled, there's no problem. If
I turn the debugger off, it crashes. This problem isn't isolated to this
program, it happens with small, fairly innoccuous code, too. The workaround
around is not to disable the runtime debugger, but I'd like to know why, and
how to cure it.

Anyone?

Regards

I guess it could be done yes. Just needs some addition of code in the
library.

Has anyone got the latest source of the RIAnimLib?
I've only got v1.0 here but the RIAnimLib seems to be at V2.5. So please send

No, it was a bug in the code for the library. What happened was the socket number was
read from the TCPSock object (to see if the socket already existed). However, this
number was used in all the calls to set options on the socket, instead of the socket
number returned from socket_().

I have no idea how this ever worked on a real Amiga, as it was very broken :)

It could be the library - remember I told you I was getting wierd crashes when I was
using it previously? It could be that there has been extra stuff added to it since the
last public release which trashes something.

Hello David, I forgot that I promised to send you the latest version of the
sdstcplibrary but I cannot find it on any of my harddrives. I have some other
harddrives in my home-town but I am not able to go there right now and check
for the file.

I remember that the filename was "bsdsocketlibrary2.1.bb2" or something
similar (I am SURE about 2.1 though) but the description on the first rows in the source
for sure said it was V2.00 and I belive it was Rob Hutchinson who had the latest control over it.

I also remember that I found the bug you meantioned earlier too where the
wrong socketnumber was stored and it was still not fixed in the version I
got from Rob so that might give you a clue on what version was the latest
until I hopefully find it back home.

I think it was the latest version I found. It had the
same filename as you mentioned, and Rick had made some
changes (at least to the guide, don't know about the
lib, but I think he added some commands).

Still ,would be interesting to see the version you
have, just to see if they match. Just don't put
yourself out getting the code :)

OOh, maybe this was why several progs I wrote couldn`t be reconnected to. It
used to report it had closed a socket, but then refused to run again, saying
the port was in use (netstat showed the connection even though my prog had
quit)

I`ll have to get around to recompiling them with the newer TCP lib, see if
that works

Subject: @{b}SDTCP.lib & WinUAE@{ub}

Hi all!

I have written a programm that accesses
the internet and downloads an html file.
It works fine with Miami (Amiga & Amithlon),
but under WinUAE with bsdsocket Emu it
refuses to create a socket (TCPCreateSocket).
Error is: "Could not set async"
(error description from the example of this lib).

I use it in non-blocking mode.

Any hints what is wrong here ?
Do I have a chance at all to make it work under WinUAE ?
I wonder why this does not work because IBrowse, AWeb,
AmiTradeCenter etc. work all fine on the WinUAE machine.

Either the TCPLib needs to be re-written to get that to work, or it does not work using WinUAE's
current bsdsocket.library emulation. For some reason, this was always a problem with the SDSTCPLib
library, that when you used the bsdsocket.library function to set certain aspects of a socket, it
would fail. Rob Hutchinson could never figure out why. I had the same problems with code in C. It
was an Amiga specific function it used, SocketBaseTagList. I'm not sure, but I think you can set
async mode using some other way which is more Unix like.

> I wonder why this does not work because IBrowse, AWeb,

Well, do these actually work in async mode or do they simply open a normal socket when async mode
fails? I never use internet apps under UAE any more, so I'm just asking :)

I tried it in "blocking" mode but now
TCPConnectSocket always fails with #TCP_CONN_FailNoConnect on
all machines (also Amiga with miami).
Has anybody successfuly used "blocking" mode ?

I found the source I have, but I do not know if it is up-to-date. Still, anyone wanting
it can ask for it (I have sent it to you Bernd privately). A shame that WinUAE does not
support asynchronous mode though.

I could use blocking mode too, no problem for my application.
But blocking mode does not work at all. Nevermind on which system
(Amitlhon, 68K Amiga, WinUAE etc.).
Thats why I want to know if anyone did this successfuly, so I know
if it is my fault (what I doubt) or the library is broken.

  I don't know if this helps, buts here's some source attached for
Windows and Unix for setting up sockets etc using UDP from enet lib:

Ciao Steve Hargreaves,

>Does anyone know where I can find some good info on search algorithms

>up.

 If the texts are alphabetically ordered, you can use the so called
"binary search" . It is the based on the algorithm used in QuickSort.
 It is very fast and if your texts aren't alphabetically ordered, you
could think to order them first and use this algorithm (you have to
check if that is useful, though).

 Here it is an example I did in TurboPascal (but you can easy convert
to Blitz). You need to put all your texts in an array called vet[1..100]
, the text to search is in "j".

[...]

j:="Text to search";
c:=0;
inf:=1;
sup:=n; ->number of texts

while (c=0) do
begin
    center:=(inf+sup) / 2;

    if (j=vet[center]) or (inf=center) then
    begin
        c:=1;
    end;

    if j<vet[center] then
    begin
        sup:=center;
    end
    else
    begin
        inf:=center;
    end;
end;

writeln;
if j=vet[centro] then writeln('Found.')
else writeln('Not found.);

[...]

Hope to have been usefull. :)

No info (I did have one site, but it was hosted on Xoom, so it no longer exists), but you
could try the BudFS (Budda Fast Search) library for Blitz. It is specifically written for
doing searches through blocks of data, and it was a *lot* faster than using the built in
Blitz commands.

Yep - I see what your routine does (Checks the middle of the text then looks
above or below depending on whether the search term is > or < than the central
entry and repeat).

However, it wouldn't work for what I need (well - it would - but it'd take a
hell of a lot longer than my current routine) because I'd need to sort the
file(s) first. Since these are full blown text files (not simple word lists)
and could be of any length (a megabyte of text in one file isn't unheard off -
and I could be searching through tens or even hundres of files) then simply
sorting and storing all the texts would be both time consuming and very memory
demanding.

Thanks anyway...

Two problems with FastSearch - 1st - it can't deal with single character search
strings I tested this with the following:-

a$="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
al.Len(a$)
NPrint FastSearch(&a$,al,"j")

which returns 0

but NPrint FastSearch(&a$,al,"jk")

works.

2nd. The search routine I'm trying to replace doesn't use Instr (except to strip
some isolated single characters before searching). It uses the amigados
function _MatchPattern, since I need to support AmigaDOS pattern matching.

At the moment, I read each line of the file sequentially into a blitz string (or
256 chars if the line is longer), clean it up, then use _MatchPattern to check
for a match. It isn't bad, but I know it can be done faster (DirScanner does a
similar thing for different reasons and is much faster, for example). So what I
really need is some way to optimise this whole routine.

It isn't sufficient to just find the first instance of the search term, either.
There are occassions when I need to find all of them in a file.

Any more ideas?

On a more painful note, I haven't visited the code for a while, and have several
dozen revisions on my HD. Compiling the latest two or three revisions and then
running crashes my system - and I can't remember what I did to change them :o(

What code do you use to clean it up? You do realise that string manipulation in Blitz is pretty slow,
so something written in C or ASM (I'm guessing that DirScanner is anyway) would always be much faster.

For example, if you did

a$=UCase$(Edit$(256)) to read the string from a file, then you are looking at something like this:

1) read string/256 chars from file into temporary buffer
2) allocate string and copy from temporary buffer to new string
3) pass pointer to new string to UCase$
4) convert string to upper case, storing in temporary buffer
5) allocate memory for new string and copy from temporary buffer

And that is only with two commands.

That's not too much of a problem, once you get something which can search for strings in a fast way.

Hello All!

I would do it like this:

Take the first byte of the search string and
compare it bytewise with the big text buffer.
Should be fast enough if you use a simple ASM
loop with cmp.b (a0)+,d0. (You can also add the
Upper/lowecase letter if you want to search case-insensitive.
If the byte is found check if the second byte is the same etc.

Should do more than 2MB of text in 1 sec on 68060/50Mhz.

@NODE "mail_91" " Source Directory - update "

Subject: @{b}Source Directory - update@{ub}

Hi there,

In case anyone was wondering - I've done it. Instead of trying to get the
directory from the shell, it occured to me that NameFromLock_ would return the
full path of the filename passed as a parameter.

I still can't get the directory locked by the shell that launches the program,
but now I don't need it :o)

All the best

There is a little source about using NameFromLock...

Function$ fullpath {f$}
; Convert relative path to FULL path
; examples:   IN: SYS:t/1 -> OUT: Workbench:t/1
; CD SYS:t... IN: 1       -> OUT: Workbench:t/1

  puff$=SPACE$(1024)                  ; create puffer
  lock.l=Lock_(&f$,-2)                ; lock for reading
  a=NameFromLock_(lock,&puff$,#maxln) ; name from lock
  UnLock_(lock)                       ; unlock
  b$=Peek$(&puff$)                    ; reading from puffer

@NODE "mail_93" " Source directory? "
From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 06-11-02 05:36:20
Subject: @{b}Source directory?@{ub}

Hi there,

OK - I've got a headache now. I've spent 2 hours searching through the RKRMs and
can't find this, so....

I need to get the full directory path locked by the shell when a program is run
from a CLI in order to be able to use a full path and filename passed as an
argument.

This would be a similar result to ParPath$ (which is only available from WB).
eg:

If my program is launched from a shell, who's current dir is SYS:Locale/Help,
and the commandline is:-

SYS:Locale/Help > myprog amigaguide.guide

I need to be able to expand internally to:-

myprog: SYS:Locale/Help/amigaguide.guide

I've been through the dos.library docs and checked various OS structures 'til
I'm blue in the face, and can't find this information anywhere.

Anyone know how to do it. There's no way around it in my program - I have to
have teh full path.

I've tried *cli.CommandLineProcess=Cli_() - but I get NULL returned. I've
searched through the various File locks, but none seem to contain the Path to
the file :o(

All the best

If you are running from the CLI then you should have this structure. However, I've recently
noticed some weird bug with Scalos that some programs started from the WB cannot launch CLI
programs (and perhaps it's because of the missing CLI structure - I have not investigated
much).

Because the pointer you want for the directory lock is inside that structure :)

You probably also won't get it if you run from within
the editor.
If it's not that, then I'm stumped too....

Whoops, seems I compiled the library with the wrong value for a constant :)

You can get the new archive from Blitz2000, Aminet (soon) or if you have the tools to put
libraries into acidlibs or a previous archive, the library file is attached here.

Bernd - why does serial output have problems in AB2.26. It's very useful to be able to use
it when developing libs (obviously it should not have the debug output when the users get
it :)

This is a general Problem
The first Cyberstorm PPC Flashroms does too send serial output.When i
connect a Midi Keyboard to MIDI in then my system does not boot when the
MIDI keyboard is on

This maybe block a handshake flag or so

Hello Bernd

Ups! Can not find this bbgtlib.obj in my library collection

I remeber it had a different name, so can someone tell

@NODE "mail_102" " Version string "

Subject: @{b}Version string@{ub}

Hi there,

I'm sure I've seen this answered before (in fact, I think I've provided a
solution before, but I can't remember what it was :-/)

Anyway, a proggy I have written usus BD-GFX.library which puts it's own version
string in the compiled exe. Using the normal way of doing thigs with blitz, if
I put v$="$VER: My prog v1.0 (19/06/02)" at the head of my program, because the
blitz compiler organises strings at the end of the exe, using version on the
compiled prog return the BD-GFX version string, and not my own.

To get around this, I have created a text file ("ver.asc") containing the
version string, and at the top of my prog:-

optimize 1
WBStartup

Goto strt
incbin "ver.asc"
.strt

rest of program

Which works. However, if ver.asc contains "$VER: My Prog v1.0 (c) Steve
Hargreaves (19/06/02)" then the exe gurus (Address error on Goto strt).

i) Why
ii) Is there a more elegant way of doing this.

I can't use the IncBin without the Goto, otherwise I get an immediate guru.

All the best



Steve

Hello Steve

What about doing this right on top of your programm:

JMP skipver
DC.b "$VER MyProggy V1.0"
Even
.skipver

...rest of program...

You need no include file and I had never problems with
this.

I'd recommend doing this with Thilo's solution.

You are then guaranteed to have a null char at the end of your string (even will not insert
any extra characters if the address is already even).

I still got this problem with p96 and uae, I see uaegfx modes in the
screenmode pref program, but when I select it and save or use it the
screen won`t change to it. I do run uae in 800-600 if that`d matter. The
p96 mode editor does show 800-600 for example perfectly in the test mode
thing. I also get this p96 env-handler error saying "Terminated due to
error" but it doesn`t seem to quit p96.

Any ideas?

Here is the example from BUM4 (I only have it on paper, that is why it is not on the site
ATM), see the online help for a description of what the fields do
(blitz2:redhelp/acidguides/speaklib.guide).

NEWTYPE.voicepars
