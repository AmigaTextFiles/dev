                    Blitz List.guide 	 01 Apr 1999                      

               contains Yam mail within the following dates                
                        1/Mar/1999   to 31/Mar/1999               



--- Here are the ezmlm command addresses.

I can handle administrative requests automatically.
Just send an empty note to any of these addresses:

   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>:
   Receive future messages sent to the mailing list.

   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>:
   Stop receiving messages.

   <blitz-list-get.12345@netsoc.ucd.ie>:
   Retrieve a copy of message 12345 from the archive.

DO NOT SEND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUESTS TO THE MAILING LIST!
If you do, I won't see them, and subscribers will yell at you.

To specify God@heaven.af.mil as your subscription address, send mail
to <blitz-list-subscribe-God=heaven.af.mil@netsoc.ucd.ie>.
I'll send a confirmation message to that address; when you receive that
message, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.






                      Encoding: quoted-printable

 This transfer standard introduces strange characters into the final guide
          which may make some individual mail items harder to read.

@NODE "Mail_0" "Yet More DLL...."

Subject: Yet More DLL....

Encoding: 7bit

Hi again,

 Well I`ve had a change of heart...seeing as a few people have taken an
interest I`m going to work on it for another day (though I`m getting sick of
the sight of linked lists..lol). I have fixed a couple of bugs...but I think
I`m going to rewrite some of it (ie change the lists) for a couple of
reasons....and I think I can make it look like a blitz list to blitz. All it
will mean is a bit more setting up before you use the list....and you will
have to have 2 variables, a list head, and a list node (ie, current item
pointer). This does have an advantage....the way I did my list`s was to
cheat, and have a node at the top of them, with a head pointer..so I could
always reach the head of the list from anywhere inside the list. This meant
that each item took 18 bytes without any extra data, as I wanted to try and
implement gtlistview compatibility. (ie, I had to leave a word pad gap and a
string gap).....which takes away a lot of memory when your list reaches
100,000. The new way it would work is (this will only make sense to people
who have seen the other version)

deftype .dllhead *myhead                ;this is the list head..still a
pointer needed
deftype .myitem *mylist                     ;this would be the `current
item` in the list

then you`d call

*myhead=INIT_LIST{&*mylist,sizeof .myitem} (note the &* start for the
current item pointer)

if *myhead=0 then end         ;couldn`t initilize list

and from then on, you`d put *myhead in the routine calls (just *, not &*)
and access the item in the list as normal by using *mylist

ie...

if ADD_ITEM{*myhead}

 *mylist\name="fred"

endif


does this make sense to anyone?? It makes it a lil more confusing, but each
item only requires an overhead of 8 bytes (a lot better than 18 bytes per
item) and *SHOULD* allow you full gtlistview compatibility (ie, you make
your item

newtype .myitem
 node.dll
 pad.w
 string.s
end newtype

just like you would with a blitz list...and then hopefully, you can use it
in your gtlistview call...

If I manage this..I`ll post it to the list if that`s okay....and after that
if any more bugs are detected I`d put it updates on a site, or aminet :).

Dave


P.s. anyone think of a better short name instead of dll???

Hello James,

On the 23rd March 1999, James L Boyd must have been typing for hours...

[Mammoth code example removed (o;]

Alternatively, you could try this:

Statement WBackFill{win.b,patt.l,col.b}
  ad.l=RastPort(win)
  Poke.l ad+8,&patt
  Poke.b ad+$1d,1
  WBox WLeftOff,WTopOff,InnerWidth+WLeftOff-1,InnerHeight+WTopOff-1,col
  Poke.l ad+8,0
  Poke.b ad+$1d,1
End Statement

FindScreen 0
Window 0,0,0,200,200,$100f,"",1,2
WBackFill{0,$aaaa5555,2} ;Requester Background
MouseWait
End

This will fill the whole inner part of the window with a reqtools type fill.
You can achieve different effects by altering the pattern and colour parameters.
Also, you could modify the statement to fill any area size you want, but for now
it just calculates the inner area of the window (works on normal & gzz windows)

Regards,
Scott

Hello all :)
Can anyone help me with this little problem? I need to be able to remove 
gadgets from a window after it has been setup and to reattach them at a 
later time. I already know how to do this with gadtools gadgets but I 
need to do it with the normal window gadgets because gadtools shape 
gadgets will only let me have a maximum of 4 colours. I think I might 
have to change the linked list for the gadgets in the window but I'm not 
even sure how to go about doing that. Any help would be greatly 
appreciated.

Many thanks,
Jamie Solomons

 No, its a bug in the gadtools library. Check out my web site for some cod=

 Why don't you just:

    DetachGTList x
    InnerCls
    AttachGTList win,y

 DetachGTList is one of those commands that gets a *whole* lot of space in=
 the

Oh, how??   Please tell.   I've tried this but the only way I can find
is to FreeGTList, Close the window, Open it again and attach the new
GTList.

What I'd really like to do is leave the window open and keep flipping
from one GTList to another.

Coz I've never heard of DetachGTList!!   Sounds pretty reasonable
though.  I guess I would need to FreeGTList the original one to free
up it's memory and to stop messing up if I re-use the same GTList
later  (Most of my lists are built dynamically and can vary in content
depending on context).

I agree.  Moving is just going to confuse a lot of people.  No matter how
clear you make ANY instructions, there be those who will get lost.
And, having 2 lists is silly.  I don't see why I need to subscribe to
another list if the SAME stuff is gonna be on there.  That just mean twice
as much mail.
I can see people posting the same mails on BOTH lists.

..just an opinion.

so it`s easy enough to do now,.. all you have to do now is get the last few

  I personally don't see anything wrong with having more than one Blitz
oriented list, especially if they develope different focuses and
environments.
  I may join the new list and see how it goes.  I am however Not going to
abandon this list.  I actually kind of like the unmoderated environment
except for the few times when it causes inconvenience.


cacha later,

Donovan Reeve (bubby.lnk@ispi.net)

Why should we bother our collective arses just because of one f*ckhead. I'm
sure if we can annoy the people who control Rob's Net Privileges they'll be
taken away from him. Which is much easier than moving the entire mailing
list.  

Or if you REAAAAAALLY need to move, I think you should update all references
and tie up all ends *FIRST* before moving. Or else ultimate destruction and
bloodshed will ensue :)

I see more people whining about him than I see mails from him. He doesnt

Ehehe,.. I agree,.. This is what we need,.. to get everything ship-shape
before removing ourselves from this list,... 

I`m going to go search the web for blitz sites, and contact those
webmasters who mention the original blitz-list.
That should smooth things a little more. Although something must
be done about the NEWS group linking that was talked about..
Anyone got any ideas? (See, this is where the administrator WOULD
come in,... but we dont have one, DOH! :( )

Plan B is illegal, and you'll just lose your intenet priviliges. Not wort=

Who the hell said plan B was illegal??? Mail Bombing isn`t technically

Yes, mail bombing is technically illegal. It's a denial of sevice attack =
(which is illegal) and it can also count as spam (also illegal) However, =
should you just happen to live in a different country than him it's not a=
 big deal since Interpol rarely follow up on individual cases. Unfortunat=
ely, this seems not to be the case.

 (Which

  Personally, I'm just the opposite.  I HATE games that try to force me t=
o
play for days.  And I tend to want to murder the programmers of them for
being so arrogant and self-consumed as to try to force their will on me.
Such games soon lose any attraction for me unless I can find a way to
shortcut it or cheat.  It's like taking hours to tell a joke.  Nobody
cares by the time you finally spew out the punch line.  The only
exception is strategy games.  Even then I prefer to be able to do my own
thing instead of being limited by some programmers ego and lack of
imagination.  That is why puzzel games usually bore me to death.
  By far the best and most fun puzzel "game" I have played is trying to
create some decent software.  Now THAT's a fun "game".  But you have to
take a break from it every so often or it'll drive you crazy.

  I am trying to creat some games for working stiffs like me, because all=

the games seem to be created for the reviewers and the game junkies who
seem to have nothing else to do with their lives and no need to earn a
living.  My personal opinion is that most of the loud-mouthed people who
always complain about games being to hard or short are those who steal
them.  (Not saying that applys to you of course, but one gets the
impression that most of the loud-mouths on the AmigaNutta list for
instance are pirates and/or not supporting themselves (ie little kids).
  I want to create some games which really have a real-life feel in
allowing the player to choose his own course of action.  It is high time
for games to conform themselves to the user instead of the other way arou=
nd.
Such a game could be SO much more interesting (but of course would force =
us
programmers to get off our lazy duffs and WORK!).  Myst was a huge game f=
or
its time, but still a rigid puzzel without any soal or life.  Multi-
threading is not enough, there need to be enough real possibilities in a
large enouth world or universe to make it feel "real".  Some of you may
know the guys in World Foundry doing Explorer2260 and the related univers=
e.
I think they are on the right track.  Especially by makeing a number of
loosely related games based in the same world or universe the sum of the
whole definately become much greater than the individual parts, and it al=
l
starts taking on a reality which any one by itself lacks.  Within the gam=
es
this is true of the sceanerios and game-play threads as well.  And if a
game must be limited in size, then it should concentrate on one particula=
r
theme with a wealth of detail which makes it feel like part of a larger
whole even if it's designed for a quick recreational splurge.
  Games appeal to different people for different reasons but tend to fall=

into two classes:  those attempting to keep the emotions on edge and the
adrenlin flowing, and those attempting to stimulate reasoning and
imagionation.  A game which can successfully bridge the gap and have a
well-balanced element of both types can sometimes become greater than
either by itself.  Whether it appeals on both counts or repels on both
counts and to what classes of people is up to the planners and programmer=
s
to figure out and to accomplish.  But one thing it would behoove us all t=
o
remember, that we must choose between deciding on the target audience(s)
and attempting to give them what THEY want so we can make money, or
pleasing ourselves in the belief that there will be others with the same
taste to buy our products, or just pleasing ourselves entirely and not
caring about the market.
  I am going by the second line of thinking, but ready to veer to the
third the instant the second doesn't pan out.  ;)  In other words, when I=

work on applications I try to make them usefull to others, but when
it comes to games, I just wanna have fun (even when programming them).

  I guess I'm just not cut out for the commercial market bit with games,
either as a user or as a programmer.


cacha later,

Donovan Reeve (bubby.lnk@ispi.net)

  Yes, I love that! It's hard work to do though. Games like
Armour-Geddon were awesome because of this!  Another from memory was an
RPG- Lure of the Enchantress- the townsfolk went around and did their
own business, went home, then slept, got up and worked and interacted
with each other etc, so you had to approach them at the right time- ie:
at their shop at daytime, not wake them up in the middle of the night,
or you'd get tossed in the slammer!!

Then you should both love that new sega dreamcast game that they all keep
going on about....you play this guy, and you get a flat in the city...and
then you need money to pay your rent, and you have to go out and find a job
and then actually have to do the job to get paid...whoooooopieeee....I`m
first inline to buy that!!...that`ll sure be a change from the non stop
party that I call life ;)


If you can`t tell what sarcasm is....try askin,

I don't see the difference between playing a short game over and over, or=
 playing a long game once. Certainly if the game is half as good as Baldu=

Ah, so in your opinion big games can't be creative ? Well, that was the f=

Yeah, that's the impression I feel aswell. Well, that and then the fact t=

Ah, well now that Explorer game is basically just an Elite rip off, and D=

the Mercenary series of games (And possibly Escape Velocity for the Mac, =
which again is Elite, but in 2D) are the only games I've seen that gives =

And every console magazine I`ve picked up in the last few months....it
sounds to me like another Japanese roleplaying game...and this time...your
not rescuing fair dragons from foul fire breathing maidens, or hunting for
long forgotten treasure....or time travelling to vanquish evil
empires....your doing what anyone could do every single day of the week in
real life...that`s all my point was....under the thread titled....What`s
Fun??

>Quite obviosly you missed the point entirely. You have probably never

nope...I just make a line up, and attach it at the bottom...it never usually
means anything...just the first thing that pops into my head.....I have
played lots of games....and never found one that gave me the freedom to do
what I want...I even have baldurs gate, might and magic IV....half life,
sin...all the ones that have been mentioned lately...(even gta....which I
don`t rate...and think that it spoils DMA`s fairly good history....if you
look at there other N64 games...like body harvest and the new ones....you`ll
see that they make good games most of the time...ie..playable..even if the
gfx isn`t the best in the world!). Baldurs gate doesn`t give you any
particular amazing freedom..it`s the same as any other decent rpg I`ve
played (in fact...it`s worse than some...how bad is the programming when
they use 5 cd`s....ever heard of bitmap compression???...in fact..I should
sue them for breaking my 16 speed cd rom!)....it has some good points..it
looks good..and is based on ad+d, but I found m+m better in the long
run...but there both games where you have missions to complete...you can
choose which order to do some of them in, and you get random treasure...but
other than that...the game the same if you play it again, as the missions
are fixed). The day I play a good game, where the missions are generated as
you play, and the characters interact properly (ie, in might and magic...a
shop opens from say, 6am-6pm...so why, when I can destory a sky full of
dragons...can I not bust in and steal everything from a small wooden shack
at night???) and the people of the village do not just randomly move
about...then I will be happy ;).


How much wood, could a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood??

  And to finish the game, you end up working in McD's for slave wages,
and come home to a grumpy wife who really wanted to be living in a
luxury apartment on the Gold Coast with a suave tycoon, and you didn't
turn out to be /it!/  And the 4 snotty nosed kids are screaming where's

So has AOE, Total Annihilation, Deadlock II, Warlords III and a lot of other
games I have purchased and played...but it`s still the same game...but
instead of some such resouce being on the right...whoooah...it`s on the
left, or..wait for it...the top...or the bottom....that doesn`t make the
game any different...just means that when you start off, nobody knows where
the goodies are, as that would be mudane in multiplayer.

Ask too much?? Do you know how much money games companies make?? Do you know
how much I`ve spent on games in the last 2 years?? (A lot...I don`t want to
work that out...`shudder`)...and I think that was my who point my original
message in this thread...that what I think is fun, other people might not,
and what they think is great fun...I might not...like that weird roleplaying
game I mentioned. I recently purchased atomic bomberman, and it`s fun, but
for about the first 10 minutes...then everyone gets sick of losing to the
ridicuosly fast computer player...because they can easily avoid bombs
because they always know to stand 1 past the end of your explosion. I dunno
about `my wishes` becoming reality (although the new hired guns game sounds
quite good...but I`m sure they`ll find someway of making it worse than the
original)


Dave

P.s. You keep banging on about music in games...how about you doing some
music for my game??

Actually I remember anyone ever emailing me to make music for their game

   My game Pyromid will be probably end up a bit of a Bomberman clone
(especially in multiplayer), but there'll be more emphasis on shooting

Hi,

I have put a very basic version of my web page up and when i say basic
i mean basic i knocked it up in about half hour.
anyway the url is http://www.homepages.enterprise/oly/games/index.htm

there is a list down the left side of the page of the games coding
areas you would like to see on this page if there is anything else you
would like added tell me.

I need information web pages books code on allmost all of these
topics if you can help me out with any of them E-mail me and let me
know which ones or if you would like to help with this page also let
me know.

I was thinking of adding a section to this page where people can
create small groups and work on projects together i wasas thinking of
doing it so you can write a wanted ad and post it to the webpage.

Hi,

I am thinking on writing a web page on creating games in blitz basic
it would explain how to open do collision detection open bitmap scroll
them create AI 3D techniques and all sorts of other things you need to
know to create game.
I am not exsperienced at writting computer games the main reason for
creating this page is to help me learn how to code games in a better
way and to learn techniquies it will be based on newer ways of writing
games like chunky graphics and retargetable sound instead of the way
that it shows you in the manual.
Does any one think it would be a good idea to create a web page like
this and if so what would you want to see on the webpage.

Is there anyway i can get a list of all the open screen so that i can
send a window to the screen selected by the user.

  I think this is a GREAT idea!

  I would like to see it eventually cover all of the aspects of game
programming so that even beginners can benifit from it, but my own
personal preferances for starters would be such things as are likely
to expand the knowledge of those who already know the basics.

  I would like to suggest such things as isometric maps, 3D techniques,
artificial intelligence routines, pathfinding, improving displays
(including for graphics boards), optimising graphics handling,
optimising code in general, color palette optimizing, modular graphics,
animation techniques, object priority handling and useful coding tricks.

  I may be able to help with a few of these things.

  If everyone pitched in with the knowledge they had we could make a
referance which would benefit us all!


cacha later,

I`ve been working on a smilar problem myself.  I don`t have access 
to the code off hand but here is a general run through.

1) Open intuition library
2) Set up a loop
3) increase counter to the next screen
4) until (no next screen or counter=screen wanted)
5) close library

Here comes the code
(needs amigalibs.res present)


*Intuition. IntuitionBase = OpenLibrary_ ("intuition.library",37)

if *Intuition
	*Scr.Screen = *Intuition\FirstScreen
	finished=false


	lock.l= LockIBase_ (0)   ;Make sure intuition doesn`t 	
					;modify anything

	repeat
		if *Scr\NextScreen
			*Scr=*Scr\NextScreen
		else
			finished=false
		endif		

	until finished=true


	UnlockIBase_ ( lock )

	closelibrary_ (*Intuition)

endif

No, WCLS erases the whole window.  Why not use WBox instead, to only clear
the part above the slider?

Or you could do a "Redraw" right after WCLS to put the gadget back...

I think you'd have to do this manually, by watching  for the main window
being moved, then move the other one to match.

You can't, all the gadgets imagery will be overwritten, even though the gad=
gets
still exist. The easiest way, if you REALLY have to WCls is to issue a
GT_RefreshWindow_ Peek.l(Addr Window(x),0 where 'x' is the number of your
window. This will tell Gadtools to refresh all the gadgets in the window.

It doesn't play actual CD's, the idea is that you plug it into your PC
(spit, spit) and upload your selected MP3 files to the thing's own build in
memory.  I've seen a walkman type version, and there's also a HiFi version
as well.

Are you talking about the Diamond Rio.....it has 32Mb of internal memory to

I think that's one of them, not cheap, but what new tech was when it hit =

Well it's about as much as a minidisc player (portable) and the sound
quality
is much better in the minidisc. And you can have multiple dsics for your
minidisc
to a very low price. A new memoy cartride for the MP-Man (mp3 player is
called
that) costs a fortune. An in all the tests of MP-Man's Vs. Minidiscs the
minidiscs
has always won, and has gotten a much higher mark when it comes to sound
quality. Now about mp3. Use em on your Minidisc then. You just need a RCA to
3.5mm cable and you can record anything you want. So hock it up to the sound
output on your miggy and start recoding em illegal tunes. I've done this
loads
of time and never had ne probs..

NOW Lets get back ontopic...Just wanted to save you guys from wasting alot
of money on crap when ya can get something really good for the same price.

 BYe!

That's the one! Couldn't remember the name of it! :)

Ah, well actually high quality MPEG layer 3 files are better than MiniDis=

Sure it would be handy when the soundquality is increased and the prices for
extra memory cratridges is lowerd
heavily. And concerning "bumps" in sound when doing stuff, you dont get that
on a MD. I've shaken mine for over 60
secs to test it and it just kept on playing like nothing happend. And
60sec's should be enough for all of us.

Well actually the sound quality of a mp3 walkman sucks. And why would peole
get something that has 32mb
memory and if you want a extra memory it costs a shit load of money. Get an
MD instead..extra cartridges are
cheep and the soundquality is amazing..much better then portable cd players,
since the MD's outputs a much
cleaner sound as well as really good diskant and base.

(ps. before all of ya nag, yes i have both a portable cd (not an old one, a
really new one) and
I also have a MD..and md is better when it comes to sound)

Really ? That's stange coz CD's have a wider sound spectum, and they use =
(roughly) the same technology.

  Amiga accelerators these days all can have at least 256Megs ram. But
128Meg Simms tend to be a bit expensive :-/  4000's could do it with

Yeah, but even still, the Blizzard (or Cyberstorm) PPC cards and the Cybe=

This is AmigalibsII.res syntax. You have to add AmigalibsII.res (can be f=

Well, that's a typo for starters ;)

Are you sure you don't mean .ViewPort (wihtout the _ sign)?

The CLI Version command is very picky - it looks for the keyword "$VER:" in
the file.  It must also be in the exactly correct format.

This also goes for the VersionWB program, and anything else that looks for a
version number (like an installer script)

Here is an example:

v$="$VER: Crazy8 v2.9a (14-02-99) by Curt Esser"
     ^      ^      ^        ^         ^

     |      |      |        |     Other stuff
     |      |      |  Date must have "()" around, and this exact format
     |      |    Version must have "v" and version with no spaces
     |   Program's name
   Keyword must be exactly this way -  "VER$:" won't work!

You can use this with the dcb method, or just as a string like I show.  It
will work either way.

There shouldn't be a problem unless something else in your exec has it's own
"$VER: " string.  That is why Blitz libraries have no version strings in
them.
If you find one that does, do the same as below, then re-make your deflibs.

If there is something else in your exec with a "$VER:" just find it with a
hex editor and change it to "XVER:" or anything else so the version command
will ignore it.

            
              
    

                                    Yours electronically,

  Yes, we need a decent upper limit (but request that people ask before
sending big-uns!), what with the Mildred lib, NCS lib,
and especially now with Power Basic!

Subject: Update of what is going on with installing blitz 2.1

Hi,

Mike child mentioned something to me in answer to my question.

Thanks Mike.

Alas I was not 100% correct with my discription of the problem.

I again tried to install BlitzBasic 2.1.

The "main" program installed ok, but when I tried to install the support
programs is where I came unstuck.

I had snoopdos running, but not in exactly the correct mode.  :(

The problem occurs when I am in the redmapeditor stage.

The whole machine just resets.

So snoopdos' log is gone unless I have it log it immediatly.

After getting back to workbench and starting snoopdos and making it log
immidiatly, I ran the install script again.

Alas I made it log to a revocerable ram disc - alas it either didn't survive
or wasn't there after the reset.  :(

So I tried again excluding the redmapeditor and the machine rebooted during
the superted phase.

In doing so, de-validated the partition I was installing it (a 1 GIG
partition and my WB partition.)

Not impressed.

Anyone please help me?


One thing I am considdering is this SFS....  Anyone have any data on it?




Cya!

        Well, I never had any problem installing BSS.
        But what I do if I have trouble with an installer is, load up the
        install script in an editor and check everything is ok, this shouldn`t
        be a problem as BSS installed ok for me, so check the cli commands that
        are used in the script and make sure you have them all, if it still
        doesn`t work look though the install script line by line but do the
        steps manually it`s normally only a matter of moving files to the write
        place.

You mean RAD: ? RAD: Will survive anything but a Hardreset (Such as switc=

But it seems like RWE wasn't very neat when they did the install script, =
or there is a bug in the Commodore installer.

Well you forget to mention that memory sanity check is another one, which=

So if program have somehow messed with memory pool (freed memory twice or=

Well If memory sanity check fails EXEC will reinit the memory pools from
scratch and you can't prevent that.
This memory freeing thing is the most commond problem because programmers=

does not keep good record of their allocated memory etc. and if you
accidentaly free memory that is already freed or you are trying to free
memory like this.

Mymem.l=3DAllocMem(Size.l,Options.l)
freeMem(MyMem+40,size-40)
freemem(Mymem,40)

So you should always free the memory in same sized chunks as you allocate=
d
it or you will trash the EXEC memory pool. And RESET follows...

Yes, so what's the problem ? Just read them as signed bytes and put them =

 (And it didn't work) you can just convert them using this very simple fo=

Hi all,

I know Daniel found out his problem with unsigned bytes. When I need to p=
ut an
unsigned byte (in a palette register for example) I do that :

red.w=3Dpeek.b(adr)&ff                  ; reads a colour component
green.w=3Dpeek.b(adr+1)&ff
blue.w=3Dpeek.b(adr+2)&ff

agapalrgb palettenb,colournb,red.w,green.w,blue.w

You have to mask the numbers : Blitz thinks red, green, blue are positive=

numbers.

I would say firstly abs() is VERY slow, you should use
   if value<0
   then value=3D(NOT value)+1
instead of
   if value<0
   then value=3Dabs(value)

Bye,

                                 Mathias

Firstly abs is fast enough for converting 768 bytes in an area where spee=
d isn't critical (and setting up a palette is hardly very CPU intensive),=
 and second I was only displaying the maths behind it, not the fastest wa=
y to do it. You could even go "one step beyond" and just do it in assembl=
y (get the address of the palette, find out where the colour info starts,=
 and start moving the data, since in assembly signed or unsigned numbers =
depend on how YOU interpret them. $ff could be either 255 or -1, the CPU =
really doesn't care.)

If anyone is still having trouble installing it, I've fixed and added stuf=

the install script (so that it installs the Blitzlibs directory as well). =
You 
can get it from my web site http://members.xoom.com/David_McMinn/blitz2.ht=

Ahhhh good! i like the way it tells u when another person disconnects
or when the server goes down, kewl.

Maybe u could make a seperate version without the terminal and the
print commands etc.. like just give the user a send function and a
recieve function and a status variable or something, so the coder
could more or less implement the udp code straight away without
having to remove the gui and all the print commands and stuff.

Just a thought anyway :)

Cheers
Chris.

  Yeah :)  - do you know how much work went into getting the
connect/disconnect routines working properly- arrggg- that's been the
hardest thing yet! 
  It also needs an extra status- 'Waiting for Connection', so you can
put in a timeout routine, and maybe a keepalive system like Quake has,
in case it takes awhile to get the connection fully up and running, or
you have to load lots of GFX of the HDD, or swap Skins with the Server
etc.

  Yes, I'm doing that in the next version :) This version is halfway
there already, as I took most things out of the main loop. 
  I'll take anything non-UPD related out of Comms_Housekeeping{} like
the Rexx stuff, and it will return different values if a user has
connected, or disconnected etc. All security messages will now be
stored in a string array, so they can be printed out by the user any
time (and way) they want. 
  I'll also change the way game data packets are delt with- they'll just
get thrown into a buffer and the user can deal with them as they wish,
also the player at your machine's, data will be put into that buffer and
delt with the same as the other player's (ie: the single-player data
will be handled the same as the multi-player). This way we can put an
artificial lag into the player's movements when using Peer-To-Peer, to
prevent there being too much of a discrepancy in a player's position on
different machines if you have higher lags.
   You could put in a lag of say half the current lag to the Server (to
be completely accurate), but you could probably take off another 
50-100 ms to improve playability. The more you took off the less fair it
would be to the other players; but with small lag times, it wouldn't
matter, and you could have the player move without any lag!!! This
system would also work with Client-Server if the Server didn't have a
analogue modem. This cuts down the lag from a standard Client-Server
system, by more than half!! -Am I brilliant, or am I brilliant!! :-))
   All the other calls to Print_String{} will be only be done if
#DEBUG=1, so with it off, all my routines will be GUI independant, and
Print_String could always be changed to outputting to a logfile to ram:
. UDP_Chat was always meant to be just a debugging interface, but it
took me awhile to tidy it up, as I'd never done anything like this (or
on this scale) before! :-)

Alex Moon once did a rather nice routine for this, it's included in it's =
full length below.

------- Begin 2nd Mouse Example -------

NEWTYPE .Dat
  Reg.l:  X.w:  Y.w:  cx.w:  cy.w
  MinX.w: MinY.w: MaxX.w: MaxY.w
End NEWTYPE
Dim M.Dat(1)
M.Dat(0)Reg=3D$dff00a ;Hardware reg for port 1 (mouse)
M.Dat(1)Reg=3D$dff00c ;Hardware reg for port 2 (joy)
M.Dat(0)MaxX=3D319;  Set max x boundary to 319
M.Dat(0)MaxY=3D255;  Set max y boundary to 255
M.Dat(1)MaxX=3D319;  Set max x boundary to 319
M.Dat(1)MaxY=3D255;  Set max y boundary to 255

Statement ReadMouse{Port}
  SHARED M.Dat()

  USEPATH M.Dat(Port)
  ocx.w=3Dcx
  ocy.w=3Dcy

  ; This is where the reading from the hardware regs is done
  cx=3DPeek.b(Reg+1)
  cy=3DPeek.b(Reg)

  ; Here the deltas are calculated
  dx.w=3Dcx-ocx: dy.w=3Dcy-ocy

  ; Wrap around counters
  If(dx<-127)  dx+256
  If(dx>127)   dx-256
  If(dy<-127)  dy+256
  If(dy>127)   dy-256

  ;Update coords
  X+dx:  Y+dy

  ;Don't you go beyond your limits
  If(X>MaxX)  X=3DMaxX
  If(X<MinX)  X=3DMinX
  If(Y>MaxY)  Y=3DMaxY
  If(Y<MinY)  Y=3DMinY
End Statement

BLITZ
Slice 0,44,2
BitMap 0,320,256,2
Cls 0
Line 0,0,5,5,1
GetaShape 0,0,0,6,6
GetaSprite 0,0
Cls 0
Show 0


BitMapOutput 0
; This is the loop you'd need
Repeat
  ReadMouse{0}
  ReadMouse{1}
  ShowSprite 0,M.Dat(0)X,M.Dat(0)Y,0
  ShowSprite 0,M.Dat(1)X,M.Dat(1)Y,2
  VWait
Until Joyb(0)
End

------- End 2nd Mouse example -------

As you can see it's an old ugly blitzmode thingy, but the technique is so=
lid, and should work on a system friendly intuition screen aswell.

TVPaint getting released for free was just about the only interesting
announcement from the Amiga99 show. I'm quite sure that AF will cover
the Amiga99 with a little more enthusiasm than me but there you go :)

It needs a CGFX compatible graphics card though, doesn't it?  I got it
anyway in case I ever have such a thing, but I can't use it on AGA, or am
I missing something??

  Not that it matters in this discussion much but the hand grenades I used
had an 8 second fuze.  In the most of the situations we were in, a 3 second
fuze would have been more dangerous to us than the enemy.  Allthough if
you were outside of a hardened bunker in a very exposed condition a 3
second fuze might be nice, I don't know as I was never in that particular
situation.  You would want to be VERY sure not to muff it by slipping a
little, or fumbling it, or finding you didn't have as good a place to get
rid of it as you thought a few seconds earlier.  All of these things are
VERY likely to happen in a firefight.  There were times when I actually was
thankful for my training.

  I don't believe there is any majec number for fuze length.  We of cours=

  Yeah, that's about right, for most guys in good shape.  I knew one who =
could
regularly toss a grenade over 170 yards, and very accurately but he was
exceptional.  My best measured practice throw was about 143 meters (altho=

we measured them in yards).  We didn't always throw the grenades though. =
 In
some situations we were forced to get creative, and place grenades and sc=

for cover.  C4 sachel charges they are not, but if they are all you have
they are better than nothing.  I guess with a 3 second fuse I wouldn't be=

trying any of that.  We used grenade launchers some also.  The poor mans
morter.


  Well, it's been fun, but of course off topic.  Still, as the crap fades=

again.  If you want to jive privately with me on such matters feel free.
I am very interested in military tactics, history, weaponry and strategy =

Well, the thing is that the tokens are 2 bytes, but the first must always=

be

text).  But somehow Blitz can get a library number (1-255) and a command

I think the compiler just (generally) "replaces" the token with whatever =

Yes, I read something about this once, from RWE, this is also why Blitz p=
rogram code can only use ASCII7 charecters, and blitz can actually get a =
library number from 0 to 65535, so I'm sure it's supposed to be a longwor=
d or something. I'm sure Mark Sibly knows the answer. :o>

Anyway if you do decide to write Mark Sibly, tell him that his "Guardian =
and Roadkill projects for the PC" are gonna be huge flops.

Hi Curt,

yesterday I tried to understand tokens checking them in a bb2 source and =
their
lib and command numbers. Library number goes from 1 (0 ?) to 255 (8 bits)=
 but
command number goes from 0 to 127 (7 bits, this explains certainly your
problem with Mildred lib).

Tokens are 16 bits long :
 lib number cmd number
 /       \/     \
1xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx      (x is 0 or 1 :-)
^ =

bit 7 of the first byte : Blitz understand it's a token.

I looked your program, and apparently you seemed to make that. But I don'=
t
know why your examples don't work with lib 10 and 73. Are you sure 11 and=
 13
libs aren't 10 and 12 (BDGfxLib and another) ?

Maybe you solved your  problem today ? If you need any help ...

Cheers,

                  Mathias

Subject: Time for change? or not?

Hello,

   Ok, I have been making notes on all the points for and against moving
the list over to EGroups. And overall,. it`s about 50/50, Mostly the people
who have been on the list for years are the ones who really dont want
to make the change,. and those who think it will be in whole, damaging
to the list.

I still think it`s a GREAT idea to move the list, cos of all the advantages.
Although it seems that there are those who are TOTALLY adament that
they wont move,.. and there are those who think it`s a good idea, but the
new list should get as or more/as popular first,. 
I think the latter is the best solution,.. so that we are GAURENTEED not
to separate the group.

Should we have a poll?

If we do all move over,.. I will pay the $5 myself to have those SPAM
Suffix`s removed!! (Then there wont be ANY SPAM what-so-ever on the
new list (if that was bothering anyone?)) ehehe :)

BTW - Thought of another advantage I forgot to mention, Auto Reply-to`s.

Cya!

Wow, how can I pass up an offer like that  ;)
Seriously, if you like my stuff, I'm happy to make up some for you.
Email me direct and let me know what you have in mind - I usually put

I use Heddley, from Aminet.  You'll also need some sort of a text editor for
Heddley to link up with - anything will do, even the one that comes with
WB.

It doesn't SysInfo thinks it's a 7Mhz 68000 with a 60Mhz 68882 for some r=

a computer configuration you want to compare it to of Aminet. That's will=

We don't write documentation, didn't you know ? Anyway, if you're not upt=
o doing it by hand there is a utility called AGW (Amiga Guide Writer [Ori=
ginal name, don't you think ?]) on Aminet. It's not good, by a long shot,=
 but it'll do.

I don`t use this any more. It was and still is a popular method
of double buffering on graphics cards. I now discovered that
allocating a bitmap and cludging a rastport to point to it is
a good way to do hidden rendering on graphics cards. I also realized
that double buffering isn`t very important on gfx cards anyway. The
latest version of Foundation has the double buffering disabled
and very few people noticed :) Of course, I'm not rendering pixels
and shapes to the display directly. All that is done in a chunky
buffer but then the chunky buffer is copied to the display while
it's actualy in view. It would look very nasty on a planar display
but looks okay in chunky.

Modern demos will probably use chunky graphics because thats the
only way to you do all the modern effects in the most efficient
way on faster cpu's. This means dual AGA (c2p) and cybergfx support
can be very easy to impliment. Planar modes usually point to
copper effects and blitter objects. I've not seen a demo like that
for a while.

No, intuition coding is fast. I have yet to see any AGA stuff that compea=

I agree, even simple "slideshow" type demoes ae done in chunky these days=

try something like this...

DEFTYPE .RastPort rp                       ; make a rastport structure
DEFTYPE .BitMap *bmp                       ; make a bitmap pointer
InitRastPort_ &rp                          ; create your rastport
*bmp=AllocBitMap_(160,160,8,#BMF_CLEAR,0)  ; create your bitmap
rp\_BitMap=*bmp                            ; point rastport to bitmap

render_here.l=&rp

Now you can use render_here.l for your rastport rendering such
as WritePixelArray8_ etc.

I hope all that works, I just copied it from a bit of old example
code I used durring the testing stages.

Cheers,

Paul

I was thinking this too.  And of course they do not say in the docs anywh=

And really in the system libs, they are splitted after #127 commsnd.

Because surely the whole Mildred library DOES work...

Well It's quite obvious. Because those "overflowed" commands will occupy
the area of the next library and thus you can't use it to anything.
But using library as splited will occupy the next library number correctl=
y.
Now if someone is using same lib number you will see that there is alread=
y
library of this number. If you just overflow it. It will work unless
somebody installs library to the next library number from your lib.

Now this one wasn't discovered, because the next lib was MiniMildred.

Interesting questions Curt. Mildred is one lib numbered 15. When I had
to modify the makedeflibs it seemed to me that all it did was allocate
enough space in the deflibs file to store the whole object file + 4
bytes, and those 4 bytes are used to tell it how many bytes are in the
object file. I don't know what happens after that, or why other libs
are split into two parts. Maybe it's just to make things friendlier or
something.

Hi,

Well now I have it working again, I can again look at programs.

One that has been hanging over my head for a long time now is one for
moresecode.

Though it is a simple thing, I would like some help with the code I wrote so
I can learn the little tricks, and see where I went wrong.

>From memory I need a bit of help with "skipping" the values between 9 and A

What it does is gets the ascii value and looks up the code.

I have commented the code as best I could.

Thanks in advance for any help.


p.s.

Can anyone also please help me with the "accepted" extensions of files....

I call them .bas but I have seen .bb .bb2 and .xtra

What is the significalnce of these extensions?  Yes, I know it will be in
the manual, but it has been about 2 years since I touched blitz so I am
just asking.



Cya!

You only posted this message to me!!,... So I replied to it back

Should definatly think about it before doing anything rash.

Although I myself wouldn`t use my own account, for that matter,
I probably wouldn`t even use the same ISP,. probs setup a dummy
Free-Online account or summats... :)),.. Would be the first thing I
would do too (contacting postmasters),.. If I was him.

But I do see your point now,.. Would just be causing problems
for other people, and not him at all,.. But PLEASE! PLEASE!
Tell them that he has become such a pain that certain members
have THOUGHT about going this far :) And if we had,... would have
certainly caused problems for `The Service',.. (Maybe that you just
saved them from disaster or summats..),. I`m sure they wouldn`t
have liked getting 20,000,000 copies of the same 10K mail,... In
fact I`m certain of it ;)

   Yes, and the other thing that could be done, if that doesn't work, is
have lots of people on the list complain to the admin, so at least
they'd get fair warning, before their network got mailbombed.
 
  On that note, one of our telecommunications providers (Telstra), got
attacked from someone in an American uni, who was annoyed at someone on
a New Zealand IRC provider, and decided to shut the ISP down.
  Because the connection at big uni's are so huge- they managed to shut
down all of that providers customers (ISP's), so half of the NZ
internet was crippled!!

Okay, here's a thought, why not just make the HELP key a "toggle" option,=
 it's easy to implement and very user friednly, also, don't forget to hav=
e some sort of indicator as to wheter help mode in on or off.

Well, you could just Blit a bitmap to the window, or copy a bitmap to the=
 window bitmap. Both work, but I'm not sure either ae that system friendl=
y. Note, you should do this BEFORE you attach the gadget list (so really =
using standard gadgets, might not work), or maybe there is some sort of W=

Surely it will still be `expensive' if you were to hold a font in ram
and render it as required? Without doing planar-to-chunky conversion
to render the characters from 2-colour planar to 256-colour chunky,
which would be dam slow (an expense), I can't see another way around
it. The way you're already doing it is imo the better approach.

I'd Agree. Because people have a lot of memory anyway nowadays, and the
amount required for 50-100 or so small characters is negligible. Also, using shapes
 for characters gives you a bit more control over them IMHO, with the added 
bonus of being able to add cool effects to your text as well :)))   And if
you create a queue for anything you're printing and use Mqblit, you can just
plonk it down and forget about it,  and just unqueue it when you want to get
rid of it. Seems worthwhile to me :))

Regards

  Yes, you can easily do fonts in many colours, dropshadows etc, instead
of just the boring one colour font!

Expensive ? How ? IMHO what you're doing is the best way, and with Mildre=
d, you can do all sorts of cool effects.

Hello,

   Ok, I`m working on ANOTHER GUI system for Blitz, and I`m just wondering
how my small demo program will work on GFX cards and low colour screens,
... Can someone test it for me?.. The window colours are supposed to be
a set of complementory Greys. Which SHOULD make up a bevel border...
Can someone test it for me,. Esspecially with GFX cards.. Cos I have a
feeling it`ll spack on GFX cards (Hope not though..)

I was actually supprised at the EXE size (before PP`ing), considering what
is there, (about 600 lines of code), it`s pretty small ;)

Cya!

It works fine, when there are enough free colours on the screen (256). 8 
colours with a MWB palette, it still looks OK but on a 4 or 2 colour scree=
n you 
just get the background colour for the entire window.

BTW that was on UAEGfx card.

Hi,

I've just downloaded and installed the RedHelpFix1 (I think?) archive.
I still can't get TED's HELP menu option to work.  Alt-Help key
combination works, but the HELP menu item doesn't.  SnoopDOS doesn't
show any failures.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

   I was thinking about what I wrote here; maybe that isn't a good idea
to do, unless the user knows about it. This is delving into a users
hard drive, and they might not like it (SnoopDos would pick it up).
Because Internet programs are so easy to be made trojan, and steal
stuff off computers, you should really keep your programs as squeaky
clean as possible, or no one will trust them!
  What you should do, is what AmIRC does, and allow you to configure you
USER name, and REALNAME- it grabs them off ENV: when you first
configure the program. This way the user can verify the whole process.

Hello,

    Ok, people probely been asked this a million times already,... but I`m
having problems with detecting tasks.

FindTask_() is ok, and works with `Blitz2' ... But wont find any of my
executables! :((((... Why?

Oh also,.. is there any way to rename your task, I`ve noticed that XOpa
usually shows tasks at the original filename,.. but is there a way
to make sure the taskname will be exactly what you want it to be,
and not something different if the user has renamed the file?

Ta.

Probably because you're running them from the compiler, and have to look =
for "Blitz ][ proc" or something. Use ARTM to findout what Blitz calls it=

No, not being an authourity on System programming, I can help you here. B=
ut to my best knowledge Tasks can be named whatever you please, off cours=
e, in Blitz you'll probably either have to hack it in, or start the threa=
d yourself....

Maybe they are "Processes" rather than tasks...

Also, using FindTask_ you must keep in mind that it IS case sensitive.

And if run from the CLI, the taskname would be something like:

"CLI[8]SYS:Utilities/MultiView" or whatever you typed into the CLI to run
it...

Well, once it is run, I don't think you can change the name.

But here is a function that tells you what your program's name is.  Maybe
this is helpful.

I find that FindTask_(0)  works perfectly well.  'Zero' being the calling
program.
And, if you want to change the Priority, use -

        psetting.w = SetTaskPri_(FindTask_(0),num)

where - psetting now contains the NEW Priority level,
        num is the value you want to set.

Well, I can only change it when it's run from CLI, but maybe this is
of use...

Function SetProgName {name$}
  If SetProgramName_ (&name$)
    Function Return -1
  Else Function Return 0
  EndIf
End Function

; demo :

; If SetProgName {"I'm a little Test Program!"}=0
;   Request "","Failed to set new program name!","OK"
;   Else Request "","New program name set!|Go look in XOpa or a similar
program!","OK"
; EndIf

; End

Run the demo and look in XOpa's list...

Not quite right ;)

You should dod a Forbid_/Permit_ around it (can't remember why...)
and the value returned is the /old/ priority of the program...

-----------------------------------------

Function.w SetPriority{newpriority.w}

  If newpriority<-127 OR newpriority>127 Then Function Return 0

  Forbid_                     ;lock system to check for task

  *task.l=FindTask_(*crap.l)  ;*crap.l is only a NULL-Pointer
                              ;this way the task of the program itself
                              ;is returned

; set the new priority:
  oldpriority.w=SetTaskPri_(*task,newpriority.w)

  Permit_                     ;and return the system

Function Return oldpriority.w

End Function

Executables are always launched as their DOS names....

...but you can use CreateNewProc to create a new process of the name you=
 want.
There would be no way to change the name of this process, but it does invlo=
ve
a lot of extra work and overhead.

Hello,

Just a small update to the archive I posted yesterday... =3D] Fixes some
innaccuracies I simply wasn't happy with and also plays an entire directo=
ry of
samples now.  Uses a routine from Stats&Funcs by Curt Esser =3D] (#SafeSo=

What code do you need to put in to be able to use your prog with version?

I do this:

goto skipthis
even
   dc.b "VER$: blah blah"
even
.skipthis:

This at least makes the info appear in a text viewer, if it reads in exe
files. Without the goto it crashes miserably :-)

What does dc.b do btw?

 It just sticks the bytes directly into your program, at the location they=
 are 
in the program. So if you do what you did above, in the middle of some cod=
e, 
the processor tries to execute it - crash, boom, bang. Another way that it=
 
might work is to define a string which has the "VER$: blah" in it. A bit 
easier, but don't know if it works all the time, i.e. if anything in your 
program has a version string *before* the strings are stored (usually put =
at 
the end by the compiler) then those version strings may be used.

Encoding: 7bit

Hey all blitz gurus...anyone got an idea how to fix this??

I have an old dynamic linked list library (well, an include really), which
I`ve used in the past okay (just for messing about with really) and now I
want to use it in a real application. Only I can`t figure out how to
deallocate strings.

Basically, I have all the same functions as the normal blitz lists, but when
it comes to killing an item, I can simply freemem the list memory, but the
.s variables in the list are just long word pointers. What I need to be able
to do is to see if any of the items in the list have strings in them, and
deallocate them before I free the list item`s memory. Otherwise I`ll end up
with a load of disconnecting strings taking up extra memory until END is
reached in the program.

Could I fix this by making it a library?? Is there a way to access strings
in libraries...i.e., call a string library function to properly deallocate
them, or will I have to do some dodge patching of blitz (i.e., getting the
allocated mem base, and stepping through it looking for my strings and then
deallocate them)


Slightly Puzzled,

Dave


P.s. I can share the source if it`ll help........

Couldn't you just get the address of the string, and scan through ram from
there until you get a null char?  Then you could calculate the size of the
string and use that with Freemem_ to free that memory.  Or is that what
you're trying to avoid doing? :)

Hi John,

Wow...that was fast...do you sit there and wait for blitz messages about
strings??? lol

Ummm...well, that is quite a good way to do it...though I`d have to use
freemem (ie, the blitz version) as blitz remembers what it`s alloc/freed (so
END works correctly)...I could do that, in fact it`s easy, because -4 from
the string is the string length, and -8 from that is the memory allocated
(when you use maxlen) so I could just add (1 because of the end zero byte)
which would be fast....the main problem is...all I can rely on is the header
of the list...I don`t know where the .s are in the list item (ie, it`s just
some bytes added on to the end of the list)....the easy way around that is
too somehow tell my routines where the strings are in each item...say at
position 4,8,12.....I`ll have a think on that....

Thanks for the help :)

Dave

P.s. I`ve just had a reasonable idea...I could make sure that all my .s are
at the bottom of the item..and then just pass the first string pos, and then
I`d know where the others are.....that wouldn`t be too bad....any better
ideas??

I don't think there is a problem here.  If you do a

 Dim List Fred.thing(1000), 

where the .thing type contains strings, then another 

Dim List Fred(any number you like)

will deallocate all the memory associated with the list (including the
strings), before recreating the new headers.

At least, it seems to in my program.  I've not got huge amounts of
memory to spare and have never run out of memory mid-stream.  I do the
Dim List ReportLines(some number) all over my code (this is my default
GTScroller array).   If there were strings left lying about I'm sure
I'd have run out of memory at least occasionally.

Cheers

yeah that does work..unfortunately....clever old me has written completely
new routines, and I can`t do a dim, because you never have to set a limit on
the number of items in the list...it allocates the memory for the list as it
goes. There are good points and bad points for this, but it`s handy if your
doing database type situations where you don`t know how many items you`ll
end up with.

I *THINK* I have fixed this (with a lil jiggery pokery....and a hand from
john mason)...what I`m working on is a list sort routine (for any variable
type in the list)..and when that`s finished...I can upload it to the list if
anyone wants it (if I lha it...it won`t be very big).......


thanks for taking an interest ;),

Dave

Oh, yes please.   I've been writing the same thing myself, but as a
low priority background thingy.   What I really do need, though, is
the ability to sort the lists by multiple text and-or numeric fields.
Never been any good at sort algorythms myself.

 Int rounds down, it sounds like he's trying to round to the nearest integ=
er, 
in which case you should do Print Str$(Int(value+0.5))

Yes, except that I don't want to print the integer value, I want it
rounded first.  I.e. Print 10 if value is 9.65.

Str$ does that perfectly (except for 9.5+ and 99.5+).

I can get round it.   I'm just warning everyone else about the
unexpected behaviour.

But even that won't work.   A number in the range 9.0 - 9.4999 will
round up to the "magic" range and STR$ will print it as "0".

Subject: SpriteColors.

Hello I've got a little problem. I am showing two sprites in BLITZ
mode but i can't seem to get the colors right. A matter of fact I
doens't seem to be able to change them at all.
The sprites are taken from 4 color shapes.
The Display library is used to setup the display.

So my question is how do you set up the colors in sprites and how
do you alter them. I know they use the colors 17-31 but it doesn't
seem to make any difference if I change them..

Thanks in advance

Hello,

Keep in mind that 2 bit plane sprites (actually 3 colours and transparent=
)
get their colours from colour registers 17-31; however, depending on the =

sprite channel you use you will be using different colour registers (as s=
tated in the manual):

   sprite channel    colours
      0,1            17-19
      2,3            21-23
      4,5            25-27
      6,7            29-31

So if you want a sprite to use say colours blue/green/purple and
sprite channel 2 or 3, your 32 colour palette MUST have these colors
in colour registers 21-23.

I hope this helps.

Thanks

Tom

 Don't you try typing random commands to see if they tokenise? Its the onl=
y way 
you can find some commands :)

 Use SortUp or SortDown to select the sorting order then use Sort array() =
sort it. I think there's also SortList for sorting lists and there's an RI=
 sort 
command (again for lists), but I can't remember it.

For simple (Non-list) arrays use the Sort and SortUp/SortDown commands

For Lists use StringSort (for String-type) Keys or SortList (for
numeric-type keys)

Hope that helps

 Whoever writes the program (i.e. sits and types it in) owns the copyright=
. 
Apparently the first owner of copyright is the author, unless he creates i=
n in 
the course of employment duties, in which case the owner is the employer.

 Sounds dubious though, better to have some sort of contract.

Yes that's right, I'm talking about AMOS. 

Does anyone know where I can get hold of the AMOS PRO v2.x update disk? I've
searched the net everywhere, cos the 1.12 update was free, so i though the
2.x upd. would an all. I don't think it's on aminet.

Anyone help? I've just bought the compiler and it won't bloody work with

Hi James,

I changed the program so that it would NPrint the results instead of an R=
T
requester. It works with no startup sequence, so I'll be able to test it =
with
the UAE 68000 emulation as well. I suspect it works fine though.

Anyway, here's my results for the 060:
    Full boot to workbench - 68060, 68060 FPU (math emulation)
    Full boot to WB + Cyberpatcher - 68060, 68060 FPU (math emulation)
    No startup - 68040, No FPU
    No startup + Setpatch - 68060, 68060 FPU (math emulation)

This is similar to the code I already had. It basicly replaces the
buggy RawStatus function of a dodgy Blitz lib. However I wasn`t
looking for the raw key checking code but the Mouse Event qualifier
function. My problem was solved when someone pointed out the
EventQualifier function.

Hrmm, I guess an If Addr Shape(#) should work.

eg.

For i.w=3D 0 to 99

If Addr Shape(i)
    <Do your thingy>
Else
    EZRequest "Argh ! Lame coder error !"
    Stop

I suspect this works, havn't tested it though...

Peek.l Addr(Shape (whatever)) will tell if a shape is there.

But only if you have not used and free'd this shape before.

Try this way  (assuming you want to use shapes # 1 and 2, and they were used
before)

Free Shape 1   
Free Shape 2
Poke.l Addr Shape(1),0
Poke.l Addr Shape(2),0

IconToShape(1,2)

If Peek.l (Addr Shape(2))
  ;yes, there is a second image
Else
  ;no, only the first image should be used

Because a Compliment or Backfill icon has only 1 image...

LSL is Logarithmic shift left, not logical shift left. Same for right.
Mind you, I don't pretend to know what logarithmic means. :-}

There is also ASL and ASR which are arithmetic shifts. The difference
is that with a logarithmic shift the high or low end of the shifted
value is filled with 0's, whereas the arithmetic shift maintains the
sign-extend.

Whatever you say. It doesn't really matter what it means, point is how it=

From: BaH <brucey@thenet.co.uk>
Subject: SetPatch, 3.1 and Blitz

It was with some anticipation that I opened the AMIGA OS box from Power
Computing last week and found a couple of ROMS, disks and manuals.
In went the ROMS.
I booted up, and everything seemed fine.
Then I thought I should install the drivers.  Of course my eagerness came
before much sense and I didn't back up ALL my libs/c/s stuff.
Of course, now I can't get setpatch to work, AT ALL, with my 1260 board.
I downloaded the newest one from Amiga and that don't work either. I just
get a hang then reset.  Anyone have an 060 with Setpatch.  Any other
versions would be appreciated.  The computer does boot with 060 disabled,
but that really defeats the purpose.

And to keep a little bit on topic...
I vaguely remember someone was using a 'different' mod player/library in
blitz for playing the likes of soundtracker/protracker mods.  I think it
might have been Mr Burkey, though I may be wrong.  What is it, and where
might I find it ?

One last thing.  How does Powerpacker on Max compression rate to the
'other' packers ppl seem to be using ??   My chunky bitmaps (320x256)
average around 15k powerpacked (from 80k).
(except at the moment I can't use Mildred as I have no AGA..........)

On with the GUI's......

I'm only using the CIATracker.lib (or whatever it's called) I think it's
prety much standard issue with blitz isn`t it?
