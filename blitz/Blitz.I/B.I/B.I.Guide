@node "Intro" "What is it for?"


  Blitz Private Investigator - we'll just call it B.I. from now on ;)
  is simply a little tool that will read through your Blitz libraries
  and give you a listing of the library number and available commands.

  What for?  Well, it really is the start of a larger program that
  will read through your tokenized Blitz source code and give you a
  listing of what libraries were used, and how many times each command
  from the library was used.

  In order to do that, I first needed to know just exactly what the
  library numbers are (it can vary from system to system) and also what
  commands are in each library.

  Anyway, I've gotten this far with it, and several people (including
  myself) have found even this much to be handy, so I'm releasing it
  as-is for now.

  FEATURES:

  * Runs from WorkBench
  * Multi-selection of the libraries
  * Can read acidlibs, deflibs, and individual library files
  * It also works on fd-converted libraries
  * Output can go to a console window, the printer, or to disk files.
  * Can be used as a SuperTed plugin
  * Source included

  REQUIRES:

  ReqTools  (It will probably crash otherwise)

  KingCON is also recommended, but not required

@node "dist" "What kind of "


  Blitz Private Investigator is PD.

  That's a word you don't see very often, eh?  And no, I don't
  mean "copyrighted PD", I mean simply "Public Domain" -
  no strings, do whatever you like with it.

  Reverse-engineer it, hack it to shreds in your hex editor -
  have fun with it.  (Yeah, the source IS included, but you could
  delete it and pretend there wasn't one)

  Stick your name on it and impress your girlfriend or whatever..
  
  NOTE: If THAT impresses your girlfriend, you need to find a new
  girlfriend   ;)

  If you make any improvements, I'd appreciate a copy - so I can stick
  MY name on it and impress MY girlfriend  ;)

@node "use" "What do I do?"

 Well, it's pretty self-explanatory, but I needed to fill some space
 in this Guide, so:

 Installation:

 * Just put it somewhere


 Useage:

 * Double Click the Icon -

  > If you have ReqTools, you'll see a requester with 3 options:

    > To Disk:

     > Library information will be saved to disk files, and shown
       in the output window
     > You will get a path requester to select the drawer to save
       the files in 
       

    > Printer:

       Library info will be sent to your printer

    
    > No!:

       Library info is shown only in the window

  > Next comes a filerequester, asking you which library to read

    > You can select as many as you like
    > Select Cancel to end the program

  > Finally, the libraries are read, the output is sent where you
    selected, and the whole thing repeats...

  > Oh, and if you DON'T have ReqTools, you will most likely get a nice
    black screen with a flashing red box - but EVERYBODY has ReqTools by
    now, don't they?

@node "options" "Options"

 There are some options you can set using the tooltypes on the
 program's icon:

     (default settings shown)

 WB=160/20/320/400       sets the position and size of the
                         output window on the WorkBench

                         the parameters are:
                         x position/y position/width/height

                         the "/"'s MUST be used, and NO SPACES!

 TED=160/20/320/400      same as above, if run on the SuperTed screen
                         these can be different than the WB settings
                         See below for running on the SuperTed screen

 WBCLOSE=YES             Should the output window close when the
                         program ends?  If you use KingCON, you might
                         like to set this to "NO"

 TEDCLOSE=NO             Should the window automatically close when
                         the program ends on the SuperTed screen?

 FROM=Blitz2:            Initial directory in the filerequester

 SAVE=RAM:               Initial directory in the save requester

@{fg fill}========================================================================@{fg text}

 Using as a SuperTed plug-in:

 Put the program and it's icon somewhere handy (Plugins/ is suggested)

 Now, go to the "Custom" menu, and add a menu item for this program.

 You can call it anything you like.

 For the command line, just use the full path plus the argument "TED"

 Example: Blitz2:plugins/B.I. TED

 Now save the settings.

 Now the program will come up on the SuperTed screen when you select it
 on the menu.
