						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

David have add much more docu to the AB2.3 Version on his page
Maybe this help too

He begin docu before the way with object was 100% clear so here is now a
correct of the AB2.3 docu (macros are replasce with objects)
 
The reson wy use new command is that you can debug it when you set
#developobject=1.Macros cant debug

Then AB2 ignore all object(macro) end object commads so it looks as without
macros

BTW: this is maybe intresting for user who use no AB2 so they see what
features they can wish for other languages/Platforms

Cheers Dave :)

Got it, brilliant, no problems and a good dl spped too :)

Now the problem I found :(

I've been using "\\xx" to replace chr$($xx), but "\\27" isn't recognised:
here's a section of my source:

    i$=Inkey$
    If i$<>""
      Select LCase$(i$)
        Case "\\8B"
          JSR help
        Case "\\1C"
          JSR backward
        Case "\\1D"
          JSR forward
        Case "\\1E"
          JSR forward
        Case "\\1F"
          JSR backward
        Case " "
          JSR forward
        Case "l"
          JSR load
        Case "g"
          JSR jump
        Case "j"
          JSR togglejustify
        Case "b"
          SetComment_ filename2.s,Str$(PageNumber)
        Case "\\27"
          save.b=False
          JMP quit
      End Select
      i$=""
    EndIf

Everything works except the ESC key :(

Subject: @{b}Re: Ahi includes@{ub}

Is it possible someone could make .obj files of that ahi stuff. I really can`t make 
it work and its a shitjob to figure out all kinds of lib clashes and tokenise errors. 
Using the deflibs which came with the archive and saving it to .asc won`t help much 
cause then i`m left with a mess of ???lib xx commands at places.
Also what libs from the AB distro have changed compared to the earlier verion so I 
don`t have to add the whole bunch and end up with a mess.

Also sorry for asking again, I forgot this and lost the email. Am I right into 
thinking I should use memlibpool.obj or memlib.obj or just both and forget about it? 
And what about the beta and patch dirs in blitzlibs: ?

Thanks :-)

I would suggest my solution of this problem.
Just throw away the deflibs and aclidlibs file.
Copy all uncompiled .obj and .library1 files to
the drawer "Blitz2:Userlibs". You can also
create subdirectories called "Acidlibs" or "MyLibs"
etc. This is working thanks to the great work of Bernd.

That it is very easy to handle libclashes and new libs.
you can just copy new libs to the directory and
they are installed. With the libsman you can check 
for clashes and change the libnums. Just
restarting AB2 gives you the changes, no confusion
by recompiling to a deflibs file.

I dont see an advantage of making them into a deflibs
file becomming unflexible.

If you like I can send you my whole (and working)
library directory with all up-to-date libraries.

Only thing you have to do is to save your sources as .asc once,
then change to the new libraries and resave your code
as .bb2 or .ab2 to make sure to not get wrong tokens if you
have used different libnums before.

I would also suggest this solution as standard for the
next release, but people seem to like the deflibs. :-(

Ciao,

Thilo

The deflib is compatible to older.See blitzlibs:davidsdeflibs.txt for
libnumbers
and free for own use numbers

The patchdirs are not need and should be empty.memlibpool.obj is in the
acidlibs release what i send to list and previous versions

The beta dir is for your own use,here you can add all your .obj that are not
in standard distri.So you need not build a new deflibs you can use the
distrideflibs and add your own .obj here.You only need care about
clashes.Best is you add stuff from highest num to lowest num

When i add .obj for standard deflibs i begin from low   

As i remember correct you need  
mpega.library1                                                     6
guigfx.library                                                   123
camd.library                                                       5

for that stuff

Yes I could do that, but the libnumbers being different remains. I have changed 
libnumbers quite a bit during the years :-D

Sure go ahead and I can try and get a more compatible setup. I have my sources saved 
as .asc also, though just as a procoution, it takes minutes to read it in the editor.

Thanks, but I wondered if those includes can be compiled into object files, like the 
ahi include source etc. Cause the source seems to imply it can, ofcourse I cant as a 
result of all the clashes and all. But I figured if all these sources are compiled 
into object files theres no problems anymore like I have.

I have been trying to get the command optimize to tokenise correctly but it will each 
time change to ReadFolderSpool_ even though I did copy over the new acidlibs file and 
the new libraries and made a new deflib with those included and any clashes fixed. I 
changed numbers of unimportant libs. Any idea what I do wrong? Ofcourse it does 
tokenise ok with the deflib which came with the AB archive but it lacks stuff I use.

I think you understand the new object format worng.

Thats no .obj files

obj files can only build in assembler need lots work...

With new object format you can easy add it to a .res file.
You get same features as .obj (help guide etc...) without limits to use only
asm
or write leadheader or libnums

Maybe your function is like this:


Function test{x,}
......
end function

Make a object out of it:

object test ;here come the screenline help
Function test{x,y}
......
end function
end object

object test ;here come the screenline help
Function test2{x,y}
......
end function
end object
..................


So you can compile it and build a .res file out of it or us it like before 
if set 
#developobject=1

Now if you have attached the .res to compileroptions you can include the
function 
with !test.But thats much work we are not on C or JAVA who must import by
hand

So the recommend way from me is (used in Thilos includes)

make a function in your lib that include all functions from this file 

object test_include;
!test
!test1
!test2
........... 

end object

The 2.30 Compiler does then automatic not compile unused functions

Look also the amiblitz guide,here is also more docu to see how add guidehelp
etc...

If you have questions about it please ask so i can explain more and enhance
docu.

I know my english is not good understandable.....

I ask for a long time what usefull libs are miss.There are enough free
slots.
29 are free to add 

If you use libs that are not add in Distri deflibs you can simple put them
to blitz2:userlibs/beta

You need not recompile the deflibs.6 libs >200 are free.They will never fill
also libnum 2 and 3 is free for your won use.

If this 8 private libs are not enough you can begin from high to low add
your libs

I add libs from low to high.

The libs necessary for thilo includes i add the to slot 5 and 6

amigalibs/camd.library1                                              5
amigalibs/mpega.library1                                             6

This libs are reserved for the optimizer PPC and 68k fpu stuff.If you add a
lib here the optimzer cant work.Maybe you can use 219 too if you need not
some 68k fpu instructions.

 RESERVED by fpulib in acidlibs   (optimizer ppc asm and 68k fpu)  217

                         29 lib nums are free for releasing librarys
                          2 lib nums reserved for lib developing
                          6 free nums above 200 can use for fd convertet

Hello,all

I have a problem... (I'm a beginner .. the NUBEE  :-)

My origonal AmiBlitz download was not complete......
I was missing a few things .. I've looked it over and as far 
as I can tell I have everything now.

I've been getting some private tutoring from 
Steve (Madgun68) Flock ... atleast until he gets bored 
with my slow learning procress :-)

The Deflib in my download was not up to date....
I recompiled it, now when I start AmiBlitz I get an error.
  "Library not found : FFFA"
This error was not there before I recompiled and also
Blitz is not reconizing all of the reserve words.
It doesn't reconize "NPRINT" for one, I don't know
what other words yet.
Steve wasn't sure what is missing or why the new 
Deflib compile created this problem..

Any ideas ??


Kind regards
Mel Ott

I think you have no deflib sourcefiles
Download amiblitz 2.3 full distri 4.2 MB.Here is all stuff you need

Then start in tools libman.Now you should see much files here
Click at all and click make deflibs  

But wy you need a new deflibs ?
The deflibs is old stuff and never update,it  contain all
usefull stuff.

If you really need some additional stuff simple look in davidsdeflibs.txt if
the used libnum is free and copy this lib to Blitz2:userlibs/beta restart
ab2 and all is ok  

If you use the AB2fdconvert this do automatic convert the fd file and put it
to correct place so too only need restart AB2

We, beginners and I think also guys who downloaded amiblitz for testing alone and
are not in this list to send very basis questions, have some difficulties 
to do little and simple things like this one with amiblitz.


Surely the main problem is because It's we are more or less new with
amiblitz, It's a langage program also  and the explanations in english is a
problem also sometime (for non english users)if not explained simply and
with details (for rookies ;-).


Often, try to use a source and have problems with compiling because
someting missing can cause desapointment and if user try amiblitz for his
first half of hour if a very detailed explanation isn't available to resolve
this common rookie first problem.

interesting, I would like to try to use xad and xfdmaster with amiblitz as
first non simple first program.

I am tring to write a little file search util and some of the commands I
need are in ElmoreDos lib which wasn't being reconized by AB.2
I tried putting ElmoreDos in Blitz2:userlibs/beta but on re-start
it didn't reconize it, so I recompiled the Deflib. I did save the old
as Deflib.bak.

The problem went away ......Thanks Steve


Something else is not right now though....
This example from ElmoreDos docs......
----------------------------
        If Getassigns(2)
               repeat
              a$=assigns$
              If a$ then Nprint a$
              until a$=""
        EndIF
--------------------------
It says "Syntax error : Tip :      This Libcall does not support a return
value"
This is exactly from the docs so I would assume it should run.

Any ideas??

I know what you mean... and my native language is "English :-)"
I don't think they are being deliberatly hard to understand ,, they
are just on a much higher level of programing than we are and 
sometimes forget that the simple things to them are not so 
simple to us. I think that if you or I don't understand an answer
all we would have to do is ask for an answer in more a simple form.
I have been reading the Blitz-List letters I downloaded from Aminet
and most of the guys seem very patient with new programers.

Yes this is a problem that there were diffrent deflibs out.If the problem is
so big it is easy to make a amiblitz_olddeflib for those programs.

But what is the deflibs for that.If someone can send me one i can make it.

only start in tools/ab2fdconvert  ab2fdconvert choose the fd file agree the
libnum or maybe change it
200 and above are free for own use and will never fill from deflibs.

If this is not enough use always highest number 
Standard deflibs is filed from low nums

I will also create the mailing list archives for March 2003 seeing as there have

Hello,

I have a problem...... (I'm a beginner, The NUBEE)
My origonal AmiBlitz download was not complete ..
Was missing a few things.. I've looked it over and 
as far as I can tell I have everything now.
I been getting some private tutoring from 
Steve (Madgun68) Flock atleast until he get to
impatient with my slow learning procress ;-).

The Deflib in my download was not up to date..
I recompiled it , now when I start AmiBlitz I get
an error  "Library not found : FFFA".
This error was not there before I recompiled, and
also Blitz is not reconizing all the reserve words.
It doesn't reconize "NPRINT" for one, I don't know
what other words yet.
Steve wasn't sure what is missing or why the new 
Deflib compile created this problem..

Any ideas ??

Kind regards

Hello,all

Does anyone have any idea why this ElmoreDos.lib command isn't

I've gone to AB 2.3, and checked the libs, they appear to be ok.

I get an error on the first line (getassigns(2))

As the tip says, that command does not have a return value. So you cannot use it 
like:

  If GetAssigns(...)

You need to use it like:

  GetAssigns ...

> I really need to get the bugs out of AB2 before I can go very far.

I recommend you do not use the Elmore libs then. They have more bugs than a rain 
forest. If anything goes wrong internally with those commands (very possible) 
then your program will have bugs beyond your control.

Do you happen to have any examples floating around that contain a newtype
for calling functions that need the doslist structure? I'm not quite sure
how one would go setting that up.

Get a copy of the RKRM (you can probably find it to download if you search) and
use the DOS library directly. You'll have cleaner code with more control.

The all.res file should contain all the necessary newtypes. It's just a case of
knowing how to access them.

If you let us know specifically what it is you are doing, I, or someone, should
be able to knock up an example code to acheive it.

I want a list of all assigns. I've got an idea on how to do it, but it's the
newtype that I can't figure out. An example:

dl=LockDosList_(LDF_ASSIGNS | LDF_READ)

I have no idea how to set up dl.

I think the elmoredoslib attached in 2.27 and above have no bugs.
All i can say again and again is report bugs if you get any

The getassigns call support on 2.2 have no return value, i think it is not
necessary because it can never fail  

Problem with elomoredoslib is more complicatet:

There is a newer version out (>7000 Bytes of size)without source and docu
which is really buggy (simple directory reading example in elmore docu
fail).
This was attached with 2.26.
Only this one have the commands for assign

Since 2.27 i use lib from last available source (4500 Bytes size) because it
can
fix and luckily noone use new instructions or know how the new commands
work

Have you docu for this commands  ? 
How do you find the commands ?  

I check out your example and it work ok when remove the if,so i merge it in
current elmore source

Attached is now a elmoredos lib with the assign stuff add.
The docu is also enhanced with a example to show how it work.

Yes .. ver.2.2 with docs is the one I have. I D/Led it from Aminet.

Yes .. David said about the same thing. He cautioned me about using this

Hi there, MadGun68

On 14/03/03, you said:

I've had a bit of a play with this, but can't get it working myself - but in any
event, I don't think locking the dos lib is the way to get what you want. I
can't see any way to get the name of the assign using the doslist, but perhaps
someone can correct me.

However, the correct way to do the command you asked about is:-

*dl.DosList=LockDosList_(#LDF_ASSIGNS|#LDF_READ)

*dl is a pointer to the doslist that you just locked. According to the RKRM,
tho', this doesn't return a "Real" DosList structure, but a dummy. To get a
"Real" value, you need to use further Dos commands afterwards. eg:-

*dl=NextDosEntry_(*dl,#LDF_ASSIGNS|#LDF_READ)

And dont forget to unlock the doslist when you're done with it:-

UnlockDosList_(#LDF_ASSIGNS|#LDF_READ)

Yes, that is how you do it. Each dos list entry has a dol_Assign or dol_Name 
entry in it that is (probably) a BSTR (pointer to BCPL string). I thought I 
had some code here for displaying an assign list, but it seems not.

Something like:

*dol.DosList = LockDosList_(#LDF_ASSIGNS|#LDF_READ)
*dol = NextDosEntry_(*dol)
While *dol
	If *dol\dol_Name
	    NPrint Peek$(*dol\dol_Name + 1)
	EndIf
    *dol = NextDosEntry_(*dol)
Wend
UnlockDosList_(#LDF_ASSIGNS|#LDF_READ)

I'm sure there's C code for doing this on Aminet (and have a look at the 
Snoopdos source code if you can stomach it, t has lots of cool stuff in it).

Thats the code of elmoredoslib i add.....
No locks.....

So it seem work only 100% when you not mount or assign anything when code i
sexecute

I add then a lockdoslist command

Are the ElmoreDOSLib commands for reading the assigns? In that case you should use 
LDF_READ. The OS should be sensible enough to allow multiple people to read the dos 
list at the same time, and if there are people reading it then no-one is allowed to 
write it.

The semaphores in exec.library can work like this, so I imagine that is how access 
to the dos list works too.

I am not clear what i should do with lock.

Must i tell the OS that other tasks can not write to list or delete entries.

Or must i tell that I want read data.

The OS must then automatic forbid other tasks writing or deleting data very
unlogic   

I see like this:

Hey AmigaOS Lock the dosbase so that other tasks cannot write or delete
assigns and do this with all

According to the RKRM LockDosList() does a Forbid() anyway (for backwards
compatibility with 1.3) so you shouldn't need to worry too much about it as
long as you are only reading. If you intend to write to the dos list then you
should use AttemptLockDosList() which will return NULL if the list is busy. As
long as you remember to UnlockDosList() when you're done there should be no
problems.

That warning is only for DOS handler authors, not applications. It is OK to use 
LockDosList with LDF_WRITE but your program will be blocked from running until the list 
is ready to be written.

Well, in that case, programmers have a choice. Use AttemptLockDosList() and

Basic languages are case sensitive a$ and A$ is not the same

Also it is important to add close file and defaultoutput to your code

It is important to use the debugger.I often singlestep what i code.You see
much faster a problem when singlestep it,then sitting over the code and
thinking whats wrong.The more complex the code is,the harder it is to see
how it work in mind


Choose menupoint debug/runtimerrrors so that a checkmark is see.
Now add on the place that not work a command stop.

Start your program now.The debugger come up.Now you can click with mouse on
var to get their values.With s or d you get next instruction.Most time you
need not more features to find your problem

But if you intrestet about more see also the debugger guide(press help when
a debugger window is activate).Take also a look to project
keyboardshortcuts Menu

maybe you want to see logfileoutputs you can use the macro !cout {a$} 
(all.res must use) which open a window and print out the content of a$.

I add here a stop command

I am running "Red Debugger v2.52".
I don't see an option to singlestep in the compiler options menu.

I would like to print the "Volums" to the file "test".
If I understand correctly this code should do this.
It doesn't.... 
The window opens, the Directory and file are 
created but nothing prints to either the file or
the Window. It should not need a window until
the end of the code where output is redirected.

Is there something wrong with my setup or
is my code wrong?
Something should print somewhere.

I've ran Library Master and have No conflicts
now, everything seems to be stable now.
So what am I doing wrong?

Yes the newest is 2.54 but 2.52 work too,only it offer less features

Here is attached example version.Also binary is attached.
It start debugger.Now you see a gadget bar
with 
stop step skip.You can press help to get onlineguide for other buttons

To step you can click step button or press key s.For quit choose the close
button.

I recommend if something not work rename the Blitz2: dir and move the
blitz2: blitzlibs: assign to the fullinstall dir of AB2.3 i send to list or
is download from Davids Page

I really don't like to be the one who is asking this (since most of the time
I don't know what I'm doing).

Is there a problem with AB2.3 ?  On Bernd's advice I did a totally new
installation of the newest version AB2.3.(full).
The only thing I didn't replace was the ED prefs.
The full installation of AB2.3 (on my machine) doesn't reconize (any?)
of the libs except the elmoreDos.lib which is placed in "Userlibs/Beta".

I'm sure the problem is probably simple, except I've had enough 
problems that I'm reluctant to change anything without good
advice.

What do I do?

I think  your assign of blitz2: blitzlibs is wrong.

Take a look in userstartup or use snoopdos 

I send a new deflibs to the dir in davids page.

Please remove then the elmoredos out of userlibs beta and use this

They should be in the AmiBlitz distribution, in the directory Examples/GadTools.

If they are not correct than the examples are in the archive for the library on 
Aminet.

From: Berga <berga76@...>
Date: 03-22-03 18:13:46
Subject: @{b}locale.library problem@{ub}

Hi all!

I just needed to add localization in one of my programs, but I can't do it.
My Amiga crashes with BlitzBasic 2.1 and with the full installation of
AmiBlitz 2.3, just when I use OpenCatalog_(), or it cannot initialize
(returns NULL), even if debugger is turned on or off.

The code look like this:

locname.s="locale.library":nul.s=""
*locptr.Library=OpenLibrary_(&locname,38)
If *locptr=0 Then End:EndIf

catname.s="mycat.catalog":deflanguage.s="english"
Dim cattags.TagItem(2)
cattags(0)\ti_Tag=#OC_BuiltInLanguage
cattags(0)\ti_Data=&deflanguage
cattags(1)\ti_Tag=#TAG_DONE
cattags(1)\ti_Data=0

*catptr.Catalog=OpenCatalogA_(&nul,&catname,&cattags(0))
If *catptr=0
  Then
         CloseLibrary_ *locptr
         End
  EndIf
NPrint "Catalog opened!"
CloseCatalog_ *catptr
CloseLibrary_ *locptr
End

This can be compiled with both BlitzBasic and AmiBlitz, you only need to
change "catname".

Thanks in advance,
Berga

Sounds similar to a problem I had using libraries last year..

I take it the "OpenCatalogA_" means the locale.library is converted into a 
blitzlib to use it this way??

If so, comment out the open& close library lines, as the converted lib 
should automatically take care of this, and your prog should run.

AFAIK, this problem is caused by your program opening 2 instances of the 
same library, although I dont know why it gets confused and crashes..


>*catptr.Catalog=OpenCatalogA_(&nul,&catname,&cattags(0))

Why not use just 0 instead of &nul ??

OpenCatalogA_() is a direct system call to locale.library. You get this (and
all the others libcalls) when you convert a .fd file into an amigalib. So I
think this is not a blitzlib (where all the allocations are free'd at end
automatically), and you need to free all the allocated resources (opened
libs and other stuff) manually.
Anyway I will try without the Open&Close parts.

Just because I don't know where the problem is, so I've done things like
written on AmigaOS devkit...but in blitz should be no differences between
using &nul (where nul="" or 0) or directly use 0 (is this true?). I thought
it NEEDS a STRPTR, so I've feeded it with &nul.

Thanks, I will try that and report what happens.

A convertet FD lib do always open and close the lib automatic.

See also exec commands etc..

I have nothing done with locale,but if you send me a running example with

Read the documentation for the locale.library and you will see that this function 
can return NULL to mean that the program should use the built in language. This is 
not an error.

> nul.s=""

This is completely different from a null pointer. Don't do it. Use 0.

Apart from that your code looks OK. Opening the library twice should not cause a 
problem* (it just means that the library will be opened twice).

Are you sure there are no clashes between the locale.library1 file and another 
Blitz library? It has been known to happen before (and I'm sorry if it does :).

* - I have been told that libraries written in AmigaE cannot be opened more than 
once by the same program. I don't know why that would be, but the guy who told me

So I NEVER need to open libraries? And devices too? That's why lot of my
progs are stuck in development...damn! :)
A running example is the one I sent on blitz-list:

locname.s="locale.library":nul.s=""
*locptr.Library=OpenLibrary_(&locname,38)
If *locptr=0 Then End:EndIf

catname.s="mycat.catalog":deflanguage.s="english"
Dim cattags.TagItem(2)
cattags(0)\ti_Tag=#OC_BuiltInLanguage
cattags(0)\ti_Data=&deflanguage
cattags(1)\ti_Tag=#TAG_DONE
cattags(1)\ti_Data=0

*catptr.Catalog=OpenCatalogA_(&nul,&catname,&cattags(0))
If *catptr=0
  Then
         CloseLibrary_ *locptr
         End
  EndIf
NPrint "Catalog opened!"
CloseCatalog_ *catptr
CloseLibrary_ *locptr
End

just change the catname var to one you have in your
sys:locale/<YourLanguage>/ drawer.
I didn't had the time to test this code without the open/close functions,
but I will let you know if this is the problem.

Thanks!

OpenCatalogA_() returns NULL the few times it does not crash my Amiga.
Anyway, even if it returns NULL, the system become unstable.

Dunno, I will look...but if there are any clashes, they exists even on

devices need open.

If you open a lib manual should not crash the system and doesnt matter.
If you want check if a library is here you should try to open it, because if
the library is not there Programms crashes.But you can close it immediate
then.
Also the checklib function do the job

It was a problem with the library, not because it was used in Blitz.

It actually mentions this in the main E manual, although it is not as bad as I 
remembered it (quote):

"What's so special about libraries then?

Well, imagine that the code in a library is completely separate from the
calling program, and that it may be executed at the same time by two different
tasks.  This weren't so problematic if it weren't for the fact that code in
most languages needs a global environment, not only for storing global
variables, but in E also for quite a lot of features including exception
handling, memory, io, library bases, etc.  (In E, the A4 register is used for
this).  It is safe to say that E code without this specific global environment
is almost impossible.

This environment can't be provided by the program that calls the library,
since this program might be written in C (even for E it would be a problem).
It can't be stored in the library base, since two tasks might be using the
library at the same time.  So what do E libraries do?  They create such an
environment for every task that calls them.  When the library is opened by a
task, a small E environment for that task is created.  When the task makes a
call, the environment belonging to the task is looked up (and put in A4).

In practise this means that libraries created by E should be opened/closed by
any one task EXACTLY ONCE, not more, not less (this shouldn't pose any
problems though).  If you put your library in the PD, you will want to put a
programmers notice in your docs mentioning this.  Strange things WILL happen
if you don't obey this rule."

(Sorry for the long mail, but hey, it's only text.)

Source included. Take a look at it, it's very simple. I found out that it
works when you create an exe instead of compile&run it, maybe a debugger
bug?

Then you can open the lib by hand.There should be no problem.
If you have a e lib you can open the lib manuel and close it immidiatly this
should help

The reason wy it opened automatic is simple

The command 
delay_(1) 
have no paramter for dosbase so AB2 need intern to open the lib

How does it crash before mousewait or later.Can you singlestep it ?
What happen here
 
I see no problems.The catptr get the value and all end without crash

Please try from 2.3 acidlibs and deflibs for test.Is this here too ?
 
The newest acidlibs work also ok with BB2

The program compiles, then it runs, but just after loading reddebugger my
Amiga crashes. I can step it until OpenCatalogA_() is used, then it crashes
(at least this is what I can remember, I can be more precise if you need,
because when I'm connected to internet I cannot use my Amiga). I had the
same problem with BlitzBasic 2.1 when trying to use libcalls instead of
blitz commands, so I thought it was a blitz problem. So I've installed
AmiBlitz over it, replacing all older files, but the problem's still there.
I've got an A1200 with 68040/40 MHz and I'm using AGA. If you don't have the
same problem, maybe it's a problem of my system. Can you tell me which libs
are using AmiBlitz and all of its components (including the reddebugger)?
I've written 10's of programs in blitz until now, and the only problems I
got are when I try to use libcalls. I had problems with devices too, and the
only device that seems to work (well, from the ones I've tried) is the
trackdisk.device.
As I told you, it seems that creating an exe works (exe with or without the
debug code), but the crash happens only when I'm trying to compile&run it.
If you need I can tell you the error I get and the exact place where the
program crashes.

Thanks for the help and for your great work (for WinUAE too!)!

Berga

Attached is a reddebug config.Maybe this help ?

Can you switch the new reddebugger before the opencatalog to asm step and
step with s thru the  single asm instructions.

ALso grab the asm debugoutput with powersnap so i can see the code registers
before executing the jsr -$xx(a6)

It seem a good idea to build a minimal AB2 which work independ from all

Hey everyone,

Does anyone know the names for the following library numbers? (If I can add
these last few, lm2 will be able to correctly name all libraries afaik.)

1
129
157
191
217
64135
65534

I've also changed the structure for the Decompiled directory a bit. Inside
of it, I've added acidlibs, amigalibs and userlibs. During a decompile, the
single files are tossed in the correct directory.

I'll have a beta available shortly. It'll only have a few options, but the
most useful for most will be the option to replace a single library in the
deflibs file.

Regards,
Steve

Check the davidsdeflibs.txt file in the Blitzlibs directory of the AmiBlitz 
distributions. You can also try the libnums.#? file for the two high numbers 
(also in Blitzlibs directory).

I got these from the deflibs list from David`s Blitz2000 site.

1= dhandlerlib (never heard of it...what`s it do?)
129 =wzlib
157 =fadelib
191 ..listed as a free number!
217 fpulib (reserved for compiler optimise commands)

>64135
>65534

Dunno about these 2, since the list only goes to 255. Maybe more internal 
Blitz commands?

Those files you mention only seem to cover deflibs.. At least they don't go
over 255. I did manage to find out what the two higher numbered libs are. I
used the original libmaster to decompile acidlibs and looked at the file
sizes. :)

I need to clean up the list a little more, but everything seems okay.. You
can split up the acidlibs/deflibs now and everything has a name.

Remember to delete any Blitz or Amiblitz

An extra plus is if you get really angry when

Dont just listen.

Many problems/topics have been discussed here already,
so it will be very specific what you can read here.
If you have general questions you will have to ask by yourself,

Since the original poster said they were a newbee, it`d be a good idea
for them to have a look through the mailing list archives and code snippetts 
on Dave`s site at www.blitz-2000.co.uk

No idea wy it fail.

Check the reddebug file in blitz2:dbug.Version should show 2.54
Is this ok ?
Also check if file defaultdebug in Blitz2: is 384 Bytes in size.
Best use file from 2.3 Install

Try a simple program

i=1
stop
 i=4

Please don't call winuae an Amiga.

If you do this often,
then people listening to you
will slowly think that winuae IS a real Amiga.

Then these people try winuae,
and winuae bugs up the display and sound like always.
Then if the people have not tried a REAL amiga,
they will go:
"What #$@!$ crap is this!?... ... Amiga sucks!"


Then when these talk to other people,
and Amiga becomes the topic,
they go:
"Amiga is crap, it sucks."
 Then a guy who has tried a REAL amiga go:
"What?... Amiga is very kewl!"
then the others go:
"no way! it is buggy as hell and always crash!"

all because some idiot told him Winuae is short for -Amiga.

Ah so maybe thats the reason wy most not want Amiblitz files
 
Amiblitz is 100% develop on winuae.The reason is simple.
All avalaible amigas are too slow to do that.

Maybe this help to understand wy it is impossible for me to use real
amigas..
Life is too short to wait for a 060/50 or a PPC OS4

old Blitz 2.1 take 60 sec to compile the amiblitz or ped source
Originaly Blitz Code was in devpac asm for compile Speed.But using asm take
lots time to develop and a programming language that is not compile by
itself i think is crap.So i use old asm code in amiblitz but add new code in
Basic

Because programming compilers you must be very carefully.A application you
can check out by testing all menupoints all gadgets.

But with compilers User can add code I never seen, so i must always run
enforcer wipeout to detect problems.

Then compile time with Blitz 2.1 is about 2 Mins.

Also i dont spend time if the future of AmigaOS is not clear.With uae i have
source so i can do what i want with it,if windows go down no problem,i can
add code to linux

The old AmigaHardware maybe go down,the PPC Hardware get never buy.

And MOS is buggy Hardware maybe buggy too like hell, OS4 is not out,and i
guess its crap too,only what it should do is run old portet PC games and
sell expensive Hardware.I like the chipset want drag screen to show behind
them need hrtmom to debug the
debugger.All is impossible without AGA.And AGA run on winuae with 256
colors fast as real amiga with CGX,have no refresh limit so i can use
714*283(566) Screen with 120 hz,so i use always
aga screens when programming, to see the output of program and debugger
together 

So winuae is the nearest one to Amiga.

Of course i never use winuae,if a 68060/500 is available for real Amiga
Hardware
This speed is enough for me to do imageprocessing audioprocessing coding in
aceptable times.

A 060/50 is too slow to do that,but if others happy with that speed no
problem
Amiblitz should forever run on real Amigas

I work too on winuae fixing bugs etc.From my point of view it is 100%
stable,also Amiblitz is 100% stable

If not then you can report bugs of both to me

BTW: The AB2 crash with missing defaultdebug is also a bug and i fix that
soon so
that it give error to show wy it fail.

This come from the syntaxhighlighter.

Look all Highlight tooltypes if they have not a higher colornum than your
screen color have.
Look also that you have set for the colornum a color in the ped prefs  

Check also your screen depth in Ped prefs.Make sure you use min. 16 colors

Thanks Bernd

The problem was in the amount of colors. I was set at 4 colors ... as soon
as
I set it to 16 colors the problem went away.

Hi folks!

As I mentioned some time back, I'm rewriting Library Master to include MANY
new features.

The final release of the program will support window resizes, but early
releases will not. As such, I'd like an idea of what resolutions everyone is
running workbench in. This will give me a good direction to head in for
window layout.

Thanks,

I'm using a 640x256x7 screenmode for workbench, but I use different
screenmodes for other programs. The most used are:

640x256x7  for Workbench
640x400x8 -or- 640x512x8  for WebBrowser
640x400x4 -or- 640x512x4  for some compilers and other programs (like
DirOpus)

I don't own a gfx card.

I don't know if you need other screenres than Workbench, but 2 lines of text
more doesn't cost so much ;)

Hi to all you!
I have discovered the bug that crashes my AMIGA 1200 and WinUAE: the defaultdbug was missing; I have connected to the Blitz 2000 site  but I have not found it alone: I think it is present into the AmiBlitz2 archive.
However I have found it on my OS 3.5 WinUAE workbench, so I have copied it to my OS 3.0 WinUAE Blitz drawer and to my A1200 Blitz drawer again.
Thanks a lot to Bernd for answering me and many greetings from Italy!

Subject: @{b}Syntax@{ub}

Hello All

Would anyone care to give a lesson on syntax ?
I would think there are general rules on syntax.
As in any language there are rules for punctuation.
I know I can use the help key for the syntax on a
command in a line of code. But when a person uses 
more than one command on the same line which relates
to how the other command is going to work. It appears
the rules change.
Can a reserve word be used inside brackets in the arg
of another reserve word?
This example line of code doesn't work and looks 
wrong to me.
-----------------------------
Example .. (ElmoreDos.lib again :-)

  "Print Lset$(EntryName$.30)
----------------------------
I understand what he is asking, I just don't think it
can be done that way.

Paramter are always separate with , .You can nest as much you want but i
recommend not to nest too much, it is hard readable 1 Year later

It turned out that it was a database error.   Each file has a pointer to the
