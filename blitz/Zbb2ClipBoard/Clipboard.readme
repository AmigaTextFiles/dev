Using the Amiga's Clipboard.device with Blitz2
  by Benoit Socias -- bsocias@ulb.ac.be
  Feel free to copy this code into your program


 ClipWrite{s.s} : writes string s to Clipboard

 s.s=ClipRead{} : reads Clipboatd into string s


The strings are put in the Clipboard in FORM++++FTXTCHRS format.
(That's the way Shell does...)
