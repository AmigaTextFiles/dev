     New Chunky Blit Library V1.00

****************************************

Story : A Blitzers, James, has put on the
Blitz list an ASM code to 'Blit' chunky
shape onto a chunky buffer. I've take
the code and I've decided to create a
library with it. But also to try to
optimize it to the max. So it's about
80 % faster than the original one and
I've coded 2 other commands which operate
ver very fast but has some limits.
Just take a look...


BlitzLibs Number : 23


NCpuBlit ShapeAddr, ChunkyBufAddr, ShapeWidth, ShapeHeight, BitmapWidth

    This one copy a Chunky Shape on the Chunky buffer. It has the color
0 for transparent color. It's reasonnably fast.


NCpuBlock2 ShapeAddr, ChunkyBufAddr, ShapeWidth, ShapeHeight, BitmapWidth

    This one blit one shape with width multiple of 2. It's 2,5 times
faster than the NCpuBlit command so if you need more speed, use this one.


NCpuBlock4 ShapeAddr, ChunkyBufAddr, ShapeWidth, ShapeHeight, BitmapWidth

    This one is an Rocket. It's about 5 times faster than the NCpuBlit command
but it need a width multiple of 4. Else there no other limitations.



Global Note : NONE of these commands are 'clipped' so be sure than you blit your
command INSIDE the chunky buffer or you will have a BIG crash ;-).

Final Words: I launch a challenge to all Blitz 2 coders : Try to do even faster
Chunky Blit routine. I don't think this is possible so prove this is ! I like
competition ;-)

    Hope you will like it !
