                          Blitz Mailing List Guide
                          ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

With what? If you want the ezmlm (list manager) commands send an email to 
blitz-list-help@netsoc.ucd.ie.

And these are wrong, I thought the list admins were going to fix it? It 
should be blitz-list-..., i.e. do not put the "/" in the address.

I actually fixed them some time ago. Going to do it again lager today.
The problem is that I don't know what is causing it but I guess
it is because of software upgrades of ezmlm.

The admins at netsoc doesn't answer my mails anymore so I don't
get any help from them.

Yeah, that's a bit annoying. Or maybe it was the addresses in the help 
message that were fixed before, and no-one noticed the list footer?

They don't answer them at all or only at the moment? Our university has 
finished the teaching part of the year, there is only a few days of exams 
left, so perhaps the admins are never in university any more :)

The last time I emailed them about something I got a reply after a few 
hours I think, but that was a couple of months ago.

There are very few personal problems that cannot be solved
through a suitable application of high explosives.

It was the last time this problem occured and when we had long
delays on e-mail delivery.

I contacted them again now but, as you say, they can be elsewhere
now.

Could a 060 cpu user try out this program:

Play some modules with it and all. I have had no reports that it did not work
on a 060 so I expect it to be ok. I just want to be sure.

Strange, but it might be easy to explain. I changed the filter command to a

That doesn`t happen here, but the reason why was easy to find. I use an 8

do, the variable gets a certain value, but it got higher every time you set
the graph. eq. That`s fixed now. I also changed back to filter command. Try it
out to see if the bugs are gone.

I don't know where you read that, but it definately ain't better :) 
Especially since you're trying to move a word to an odd address (that

You can't go changing all the bits at that address, you'll alter other

From: Jason Faramus <Jason@...>
Date: 05-27-01 15:52:38
Subject: @{b}256 Colour screens?@{ub}

Hello,

Can anyone tell me if it's possible to create a 256 colour, 8 bit plane
intuition screen. I know that it can be done with a bitmap for use with Blitz
mode but I cannot find anything about doing the same for screens. In the
manual it say that the depth of a screen can only be 1-6 bit planes but surely
you can use AGA's 8. Please let me know if I'm missing something here.

On another note, I've been thinking about my blitting and using display
scrolling problem and was wondering if the following might solve the problem.

At the moment whatever I blit get's display scrolled to, so can anyone tell me
if this solution might work as I really need to use blits and not sprites,

1. Display scroll the empty background.
2. Copy this to a hidden bitmap, out of sight of the main display.  
3. Blit our shapes onto the main display.
4. Copy our hidden bitmap to the main display.
5. Display scroll this background.
6. Copy this to the hidden buffer.
7. Blit our shapes again.
8. Repeat...

So to escape the display scrolling of the blitted shapes we only display
scroll every other frame and blit on the frames inbetween thus the display is
not being display scrolled when the shapes are visible. Any chance of this
idea working or am I dreaming? If not has anyone got an alternative idea?    

Best wishes,
Jason.

Yes, you can. Tha manual (at least the one I remember reading) did not 
get updated when the screen commands where updated, the information for 
it was in BUM3 or whatever it was released with. Not sure about the 
version of the manual that came with the CD.

I think you need to use the long version of the screen command though:

Screen 
screennum,x,y,width,height,depth,viewmode,title$,dpen,bpen[,bitmapnum]

Nope, the displayscroll is a hardware thing that is done to the display 
as it gets put out to the display - it doesn't affect the actual in-
memory bitmaps.

Would it be possible for you to use a dual playfield display? Then you 
can displayscroll the front and back playfields separately.

The only other thing I can think of ATM is doing the scroll in software 
onto another bitmap and then displaying the main playfield and blits on 
top of that. But that would be pretty slow.

I'm thinking about it but I really need a few more colours than this allows.

I've tried this and the speed is not to bad at all. The main problem with this
though is that the floor moves much to fast. Is there a way that I could
smooth it out a bit? Is it possible to blit in fractions of pixels like when
displayscrolling or is there another way. At the moment the first line moves
at a rate of one pixel the second at two pixels and so on, but like I have said this
is much to fast. Any ideas?

Best wishes,
Jason.

You can't blit in fractions of a pixel. If you are willing to you can do 
it in jerk-o-vision, where you update the position in fractions and only 
actually move the floor on pixel boundaries.

This isn't as difficult as it sounds, not difficult at all. Just use a 
quick variable for storing the position to move by, increase the position 
by a fraction and the bitting commands will automatically use the integer 
part of the values.

But like I say it'll be a bit jerky.

Well, without the original library installation, a "de-tokenizer" won't
work -
All the tokens really are is a note to the compiler that translates
something like this:
"Use command #03 from library #036 here"

This was the fatal flaw in Blitz's library implementation (or rather, in the
idea of making it possible to save tokenized source code...)

That's why you often get those bad command errors when you load someone
else's tokenized source (or even your own old tokenized sources when you
add/change your Blitz library setup...

There is nothing in a tokenized source that will tell you which library on
the original author's setup had that number, nor which version of that
library was used...

In other words, there really is no way to de-tokenize a Blitz source
accurately without having the exact library setup that was used to tokenize
it in the first place - and if you DO have that, why not just load up the
source into Blitz and save it as plain text?

If you don't, next best would be to install a "standard" set of Blitz
libraries, load the source, and painfully correct it by hand before saving
as plain text...

Well, the reason for having to manually "correct" some of the tokens was
that some libraries have "hidden" tokens in them - apparently these are
commands that are only called by the library itself, not available to the
user - and I couldn't figure out how to not recognize them as commands when
parsing through the libraries.

And yes (assuming that that the above command number patching was correct)
it would work all the time, unless you changed your library setup.  In that
case, you would have to re-parse your libraries again for accurate results.

But again, you would only get accurate results on the specific library setup
you have "customized" it for, by having it parse through your libraries.
The problem is this: The tokenized source has only library/command numbers,
and the command names themselves are inside the actual libraries, which can
(and often do) have different library numbers on different systems...

It should be easy enough. Curt's investigator could be used as the base, and I 
posted all the info you'd need and example program of extracting all the basic 
commands and things from the libraries. I was actually going to do a 
detokeniser back then, but never had the time to start it.

I just can't remember if it worked all the time. And I know Curt had to 
manually enter some tokens in his Investigator.

Oh, and there's already a tool for getting the tokenlist, I think it's called 
Viewlibs or something - it's either on Aminet, or was as source in the 
blitzlibs: drawer from later versions. Either way, it should be on b2k :)

I have used blitz with a Blizzard 1260, with no problems (well, 
I think the debugger was running slowly, but that can be 
cured).  One thing it could be is if you're using an old version 
of Ted, it might not like the cybervision screenmodes.  Try an 
updated version.

Hi Eveyone,

Just wanted to ask what sort of systems you are running Blitz on,
I have an 060 (Apollo) and Blitz keeps crashing in the most annoying way's
almost making me never go near it again. Does this happen to anyone else?
I have also just installed OS 3.9 and I don't know if I'm just imagining it
but it seems to have made matters worse. 

I have tried to disable my 060 but I still get problems, is there any known
programs etc... that Blitz doesn't like if so could someone suggest somethng
that I could try? Sometimes I cannot even start Blitz at all! Please help. I
am not running any hacks or anything like that so I'm really stumped. Here's
my config,

A1200 
Apollo 060/50-32 mb
Cybervision 64/3D

Before I go, can anyone tell me if there would be a significant speed increase
over an AMOS made games blitting operations if I were to convert it to Blitz
or is the Blitting speed the same in both programs as it's restricted by the
Amiga's hardware?  

Best wishes,
Jason.

Someone had a problem running Blitz on an Apollo060 before. It crashed 
every time he tried to compile his programs I think, so your problems 
sound worse.

I think someone on this list runs Blitz with OS3.9 and it runs fine. He 
did have problems to start with, but that was a problem with something 
else.

AFAIK there are no programs which cause Blitz to crash. What version of 
Blitz do you have? Have you tried running a minimal setup? What version 
of the editor do you have? Have you tried running just the editor (Ted) 
by itself to see if the problems are related to that? Have you virus 
checked your Blitz2 and Ted programs - some virus don't like 060s and 
crash even though they don't appear to do much else?

I've been using Blitz for a good few years with an 060 with no problems. The
one thing I will say is to delete envarc:ted.prefs and env:ted.prefs and try
running it again. For some unknown reason TED fails here and I have to do
the same thing myself. Everything is fine after that.

When I got 3.9 I had some troubles with getting it to run properly. But that
was caused by those two files in env: someone mentioned. They gave me
sporadic lockups. Nowadays I dont have any problems thought on two of my
working machines, 030/50, 040/25, AGA and RTG and both with 3.9.

Get hold of the latest version of the editor and also, do as Simon Archer
wrote, delete the files

envarc:ted.prefs
env:ted.prefs

and see how it runs.

The blitting-operations themselves won't be speeded up, about Blitz vs. AMOS
I don't know - only used it for about an hour in my life :)

Hope it gets sorted,

Great, just my luck!

> What version of Blitz do you have?
The latest one from the UBB CD. I have also got the new installer that I
believe you wrote and have updated all the necessary files that it say's to do
when installing. I have also tried running the bare minimum Blitz installation
without any of the updates at all Blitz 1.9 I believe.  

> Have you tried running a minimal setup?
Yep. After the crash has happened though my Amiga will not warm reset at all
so I have to completely switch off. (Sounds bad doesn't it) 

> What version of the editor do you have?
Superted 2.52 (I think...)

> Have you tried running just the editor (Ted)

That work fine strangely enough. I have tried running Snoopdos to try to catch
the problem as it happens but I'm getting nothing :( 

> Have you virus 
> checked your Blitz2 and Ted programs - some virus don't like 060s and

I thought of that too but all files are virus free.

I will try deleting the two files that were suggested to see if that helps (I
deleted the whole installation in a fit of rage so I have to re-install first)
and will let you all know if it help, thanks for all your support though :)

Best wishes,
Jason.

I used to use it with a Blizzard '060 too. That point about deleting the
ENV: and ENVARC: prefs is a good one, as I seem to recall that fixed things
for someone else a while back...

Also, check your 060 and 040 libraries are correctly installed, of course.

Yes, it is a bug in TED - when you install a new version, it tries to read
in the old prefs if it finds them and the format is different than the new
prefs, so it will crash...

Hello all,

Thanks to everyone who offered me advice about possible reasons as to why
Blitz was crashing my system, I have finally, after much testing, found the
cause of the problem... Picasso96! Since removing it from my system and
installing CGX everything now works perfectly :) I do however have to disable
my data caches on my 060 Apollo though to create executables, still this is
nothing major. Thanks again to all who helped,

Best wishes,

There must be some other problem in that case, perhaps with the 
configuration of your screenmodes (either in P96Mode or the screenmode 
you have selected in Blitz - in which case deleting the env: and l: files 
should give you a screen like your workbench), since I use P96 on WinUAE 
and also on my Mediator.

Although I suppose it could be different since you have a CV64/3D though?

Did you download that patched debugger I put somewhere? Or did I ever get 
round to uploading it?

It's in the Blitz section of my website (see sig). I'll upload it to

That's odd, cos I use Blitz under WinUAE with P96. The only problem is the
slowdown in the debugger, which is apparently related to whatever gfx card

Its a question of the way the logic is evaluated..

Rather then the first line you should use 
IF NOT (v=10 OR v=32) : CP1=a : ....

or 

IF (NOT v=10) AND (NOT v=32) : CP1=a : ....]

An alternative approach is to use InStr$

Build a string containing the numbers (with leading zeroes and 
delimited by "|")
Numbers$
="000001|000002|000004|000006|000111|000800|005678|222222"

; The above all on one line :-)

Then do

Format "000000"
if InStr$(Number$, Str$(YourNumber))
	Then ; one was found
	else ; not in list
endif

Alternatively, what's wrong with the obvious

Select YourNumber
	Case 1
	Case 2
	Case any other number you like
end select

Yep, but you've got to type the little suckers in somewhere :-{

One thing I used to do in PL/1 programs was to create an external 
routine whose name was built from the variable ( Names like  
Routine000001.exe, Routine222222.exe, etc)

These contained the code to do whatever needed to be done for the 
given variable.

Then I simply attempted to load and execute the routine.    If it 
worked then the number was valid.   If the routine didn't exist then 
the figure was invalid.

Not sure how to that in Blitz, but it might be worth thinking about.

Has the great advantage of not having to change the program if you 
add a new variable, just create the new routine and stuff it into the 
path somewhere.

Cheers

Tony

var.w = 23131
pn$="ExternalProg_"+Ustr$(var)+".exe"
Execute_ &pn$,0,0

Although you've then got the problem of getting a return value from the 
external program. You could maybe set and ENV-var I suppose.

You also have the problem of passing data to the program in the 
first place.

Actually, these are the same problem, really - pop a file into ram?, 
must be a better way?

What happens if the program doesn't exist?   Can you get a clean 
"executable not found" or "file not executable" response from the 
OS?

Not really, just do pn$="ExternalProg_"+Ustr$(var)+".exe "+arg$ I think. 
And if not, you can change the input and output streams (which I suppose 
would mean having to create a file somewhere as you mention below).

> Actually, these are the same problem, really - pop a file into ram?, 
> must be a better way?

They are different problems, since it's far easier to pass parameters. 
And if you're external programs are written in Blitz, it's difficult to 
create a proper return code. It may be worth using SystemTagList_ as you 
get more control and proper return codes.

If the program cannot be found, Execute_ returns 0 (it might also return 
0 in the case of not executable, or it cannot execute for some other 
reason).

Hi Guys,
      This is probably a really simple question, but I don`t have my "C for

I`ve been playing with the mhimaspro.library, which I converted from the fd

in the example code...

  sigmask = 1L << mysignal

where mysignal is returned from mysignal.l=allocsignal_(-1)..
so the biggy is, what does 1L<<mysignal do..i got a feeling it`s a bitwise

Hello people.

Okay, this is my first posting to the list. So sorry if I have broken any
rules...

I am also new to Blitz programming. So, explain this in simple terms if you
can! ;-)

Right. I have written a program, that reached vesion 1.0 yesterday. However,
I have allready had three e-mails from people saying that they would like
to do translations into other languages for me (nice of them!!).

However, this is where my problems start. I have no idea how to write a
catalog for my program!! Can anyone help me here?

One bloke has already asked for a "catalog.descriptor (.cd)" file for it.
Yet I have no idea what he is talking about :-0 !!

Please help!!!

Richard Brooklyn.

It depends how you've done your strings in your program. If you used the
locale.library then you should already have a .cd, .ct and .catalog files
somewhere.

.cd is Catalog Description file
.ct is Catalog Translation file
.catalog is the one which holds all the strings for the different
languages.

But I guess you didn't do this since you don't know what a .cd file is :)
The simplest way to do multi-language support is to have a simple text
file, where each of the strings in your program is on a single line in the
file. When you start your program (or if the user chooses another
language) you can just read each line into a string array. Just make sure
all your strings in your program are accessed via the string array.

e.g.

#MAX_LOCALE = 1
Dim locale$(#MAX_LOCALE)

; Set up default strings here
locale$(0)="Hello, this is in English"

Statement ReadCat{language$}
    SHARED locale$()
    If(OpenFile(0,"PROGDIR:catalogs/"+language$))
        i.w=0
        While Lof(0)<>Loc(0) AND i<#MAX_LOCALE
            locale$(i)=Edit$(256)
            i+1
        Wend
    EndIf
End Statement

ReadCat{"francais"}
NPrint locale$(0)
ClickMouse
End

--------------------

Now, if you create a text file called francais and put some string at the
first line (which would be the French version of whatever the English
strings are), you have simple multi-language support.

(If you are running the program from inside the Blitz2 editor though,
you'll need to change the path to the file, since PROGDIR: will not work.)

hmmm.. I like your idea a lot. Your method of adding multi-lingual support
appeals to my lazy and stupid side! However, during the programming of my
software, I have always wanted to do things the "proper" way, and I have
managed to keep this promise to myself. Until now. I would like to be able
to use the locale.library if I can. Prehaps you could explain how to use the
locale.library?? However, if it requires the use of the amigalibs.res then I
am stuck. As the amigalibs.res file clashes with another resident file that
I have running (which is required I'm afriad).

Don't get me wrong! I like your soultion a lot, and it is clear to me that
you have spent a fair amount of time coming up with a solution for me. For
which I am greatefull (<-- spelling!!). But I would like to do things
"properley". Hope you understand.

That's not the way I do it, but every time I suggest locale.library I get
shot down in flames for making it more complicated than it needs to be :)

I've cut'n'pasted the code from one of my programs and attached it here.
It works OK, and if you want to see the whole program (and source, called
Dir2HTML) you can find it on my site (see sig).

I can't actually remember how to create the catalogs now. I know I used
ReCatIt from Aminet, and I think all you need to do is type in the string,
and then the constant you would like to associate with that message, i.e.

Constant: LOCALE_STRING_GADGET
Msg: This is a string gadget

Then you could access it using locale$(#LOCALE_STRING_GADGET) in your code
(after you create a list of constants from inside ReCatIt). I didn't
fiddle too much, so the constants would never change, but I think you can
specify exact values for the constants in ReCatIt (although I found the
program a bit fiddly).

Actually, I think I might have used FlexCat (also on Aminet), but I still
can't remember what I done. If I did use FlexCat, you have to create the
.cd file by hand in a text editor (the FlexCat docs tell you how, in fact
I think they explain pretty much everything) and then convert it into a
.ct and .catalog file. If you do go for flexcat, it allows you to specify
a template for the code it generates - I've also attached mine, but I
can't remember if I used it or not. And I won't be held responsible for
any bad stuff inside it :)

> requires the use of the amigalibs.res then I am stuck. As the

It uses amigalibs.res for a couple of constants, but let me guess, you are
using the MUI.res file? If you have the MUI2.res, then it has the whole of
amigalibs.res in it already.

> Don't get me wrong! I like your soultion a lot, and it is clear to me

I am very thankfull you you ppl trying to help. I just regret that
I give such poor explanation when describing my problems.

My problem is...
When a running program passes a certain checkpoint, I need to check
if a key has been recently been pressed. My program does not use blitzmode
or windows. It only uses a screen. It is therfore important that I can check
at random occations to see if a key has been recently pressed.

A little source example would be gratefully appreciated.


BTW: where can I get the latest information on all the commands in BlitzII
since my "book" is quite outdated?


In advance, Thanks
 Terje Maurset

I found some C source last night which I'll have a go at porting, just

Hi,

Has anyone got a routine for doing a floodfill on a chunky bitmap? I
checked the Mildred, and NCS functions and they don't appear to have
anything.

Thanks.

Hi all,

Has anyone who has tried the old Crap Fighter demo experienced screen
corruption, i.e. flickering lines etc... as it seems to happen on my Amiga and
also happens with Worms DC (also Blitz made I believe) Is this a fault with
Blitz maybe the Display Scroll command or is it my Amiga? If anyone can offer
any advice then that would be great.

Thanks,
Jason.

It would only be a fault of the DisplayScroll command if someone used it 
wrongly.

For example, if you try to scroll lines further than the edges of the 
bitmap, you will either get graphical corruption or the egdes of the 
previous/next lines appearing.

Another problem could be if your coplist is set up wrongly so that custom 
copper instructions overlap. Weird things would definately happen then.

You will also get problems if your custom copper instructions take up too 
much time in the video frame. If you run too far off the end of the 
timing of a frame, there might be problems with the start of the next 
frame. You might get similar problems on a per line basis, in that if you 
put too many copper instructions per line subsequent copper instructions 
will be performed at incorrect times.

The final problem that I can think of is if you try to use displayscroll 
to jump about a bitmap too much. (It will automatically change the pixel 
distance you move so that it moves up to 16 pixels and then for every 16 
pixels it will change the start address of the bitmap being displayed. I 
think the maximum you can move is +/-32k pixels.) The specific example I 
was thinking of was a game where the programmers were using a hugely wide 
bitmap and at the bottom they tried to do a mirror reflection of the 
lower part of the bitmap. They had used DisplayScroll to move the bitmap 
pointers and give it a wobbly water effect, but they could only do a few 
lines due to the limitations above. So make sure you're not trying to 
exceed the limitations of what the hardware can do.

First of all. Sorry about the size of this mail.

I've been messing about with your code and come up with the attached program, It 'sort of' supports
multiple devices (32) and puts up a small VU Meter style window so you can keep track of your 
drives visually. The tooltypes are fairly simple there are 6 for the colours, WINX & WINY, DELAY
and DEVICE00 to DEVICE31 for the partitions you want to monitor.

The DEVICE tooltype is case sensitive and you MUST not use a trailing colon ":", the device is checked
using findtask_ to see if it really exists.

The meter switches on one block for every 10% of the device used, except for the top block which
switches on at 95%.

What I want to do is put the individual meters into the icons of the drives (OS 3.5+ only), I got the
idea from the mac version of internet explorer 4, It puts a small meter in the icons for files it's
downloading.

If anyone knows how to copy a coloricon image into a bitmap so I can modify it, then write 
it back, please let me know.

I also need to know how to notify dopus magellan II that the icon has changed.

As usuall, do what ever you want with my code, you will most likely delete it anyway ;)

IIRC this was about the second program to come out which supported 
altering OS3.5 programs, not sure what it is, but it's on Aminet 
somewhere.

Use icon.library v44. The principle is the same as with normal icons, and 
I'm sure there's been code posted here before to do that. In fact, you 
could have a look at the "newicons in blitz" code, I think it does that.

> I also need to know how to notify dopus magellan II that the icon has
> changed.

Use workbench.library v44 for that :) I think DOpus will have some sort 
of emulation, where it will recognise those calls. I only briefly looked 
at this before, but when you draw an icon (or was it appicon?) you can 
specify a hook to be called every time the icon needs to be updated. The 
OS then calls this hook to update the icon.

I can't remember how you make your program cause an update though.

Hi Blitzers,

another problem presented by me:

Ii guess it has been discussed some weeks ago, but when I try to dimension
some "Dim List"s (about 12) which consist of different newtypes, the
debugger(!) says "out of memory" after compiling and starting.
Is there a way to get it run without changing to other solutions like "dll"
?

When does this error-message occour? Just when the debugger pops up or
afterwards? Does the program guru when you turn of the debugger?

Try and calculate the size of your lists with the /SizeOf/ command to see
how many bytes your NEWTYPE's actually take up and multiply that with the
amount of items you are dimming. 

Maybe posting the code might help.

Hi all,

I'm now stuck with the Display Scroll command. I've been fiddling with it for
ages but am still having trouble. (Once again thanks to the useless
description in the docs...) How does it work? Am I right in thinking that it
can do the same as hardware scrolling i.e. shift the screen around as a whole
or can it just be used to position individual lines? If it can do the above
how would I go about setting this kind of display up?

Any help would be much appreciated.

Don't use it for hardware scrolling (assuming you only want to move the
displayed area of the bitmap), you'd be better using the x,y parameters of
DisplayBitMap for that.

Yes, DisplayScroll can position individual lines. The two parameters are
pointers to arrays (of .q type) for the front and back playfields, and
each value in the array is the amount to the right (I think) that the line
is shifted compared to the left. For example, if in your array you had:

Dim xpos.q(256) ; Should do one value in the array for each line of the
                ; display that DisplayScroll will be used on. So we use
                ; 256 for a full PAL display.

xpos(1)=3       ; All the rest will default to 0
xpos(3)=-2
xpos(4)=5

Your display will look like this

==========...    First line
   =======...    Line 1
   =======...    Line 2
 =========...    Line 3
 =========...    Line 4
      ====...    Line 5

And all the rest will align with that last one (cos they have an offset of
0). Obviously the blanks in the diagram above will be filled by whatever
is to the left of the first pixel, so you need to make sure your bitmap is
a bit wider than the display, or you will end up displaying the last part
of the previous line.

In the coed I think you use it like DisplayScroll 0,&xpos(0),&xpos2(0)
where xpos is the array of offsets for the front playfield and xpos2 is
the array of offsets for the back playfield (if you have a dual playfield
display, if not, make them both &xpos(0)).

You also need to reserve 4 custom instructions per line (subtract 4 from
the numcustoms parameter when you use InitCopList). I did have some code
which I was playing around with trying to get it to work, but I can't seem
to find it now.

Hello,

Thanks for the advice on using Display Scroll, my next problem (yes sorry
another one) is how can I use the Blitting commands on the Bitmap that I am
Display Scrolling without the Display Scroll affecting the shapes that I have
just blitted? I thought that if I Blitted the shapes after I have Display
Scrolled then I would have been O.K. but the last shape that is Blitted is
obviously still there next time round which in turn also gets Display Scrolled
along with the Bitmap, any ideas? (I know that using sprites would solve this
problem but I really need to Blit the shapes.)

You can't, DisplayScroll is a hardware thing which always affects the 
bitmap which is being displayed. You'd have to come up with some sort of 
evil custom blitting functions if you wanted to blit the shapes in a way 
so as to not look displayscrolled. Or use sprites which you mention 
later. Or rethink what you are using displayscroll for, or possibly 
change the way your display is being organised. (Are you using 
displayscroll for parallax effects by any chance?)

Shapes getting left behind? You'll want to use either queued or buffered 
blits. Queued blits remove the background when you remove them from the 
bitmap and buffered ones restore the background. Obviously buffered blits 
are slower. Both follow the same sort of routine:

; Create a queue or buffer
Queue queuenum,size                    Buffer buffernum,memorysize

; Then when you blit your shapes you do:
QBlit queuenum,shape,x,y               BBlit buffernum,shape,x,y

; When you want to remove them from that frame
Unqueue queuenum                       Unbuffer buffernum

and so on. Obviously you can use two buffers or queues so that it works 
properly on double buffered displays.

Hi,

Can anyone remind me where the original (command line) fdconvert program
comes from? I seem to have lost it, and it's not on the CD, and nowhere in
my Blitz directories.

I know there's NewerFDConvert, but I'm specifically looking for the
command line one.

Thanks.

Have you tried fdconvert.bb2 on the BlitzCD 'extras/libsdev/toolssrc/fdconvert.bb2' ?

Subject: @{b}Fetchmode Question@{ub}

Hello,

I'm trying to create a coplist display that uses fetchmode 3 but this seems to
push everything to the right. The question is how can I center my display
again. I am only blitting and not using sprites so am I correct in thinking
that this is possible? In AMOS there is a command to position the screen but
how can I do this in Blitz, say for example if I wanted to allow the user to
set the position of a game screen to suite their TV display.   

Thanks for any help.

The command you are looking for is probably DisplayAdjust, but the
documentation for it sucks.

Tell me about it, along with all the other docs. I'm surprised no-one has
tried re-writting them yet. Are there any other sources of info for Blitz's
commands apart from the useless manual? 

Anyway, I believe you are right with the display adjust command which leads me
onto my next question, can anyone explain it in english for me as it's kind of
urgent.

I think someone started writing a replacement manual years ago. This is
also one of the goals of Blitz2000, but I don't have enough time to work
on it :(

I've had a few offers of help, but I never manage to arrange who's doing
what.

> Anyway, I believe you are right with the display adjust command which

> as it's kind of urgent.

I have an example Ted Bailey wrote ages ago (attached), but he doesn't explain
how the parameters are used. And it's not what I thought they'd be, it looks
like they are the "difference from the normal". Yeah, I've just checked
the lib source, and they are indeed the difference from the norm.

DisplayAdjust #coplist,fetchwid,ddfstrt,ddfstop,diwstrt,diwstop

#coplist - the number of your coplist object
fetchwid - fetch width - 32 for fetchmode 3 I think
ddfstrt - data fetch start (what horizontal position in the scanline the
data is starting to be read from memory by the custom chips)
ddfstop - stop position for data fetch
diwstrt - display window start (left edge of the display)
diwstop - display window stop (right edge of display)

I also think the ddfxxxx values are in multiples of 4, so if you specify
e.g. 8 you actually change the start/stop position by 32 pixels (this is
the way the hardware works).

If you wanted to move the things to left (as in your case) you would
specify something like:

DisplayAdjust 0,0,-8,-8,-16,-16
Would move the data fetch 32 pixels to the left and the window 16 pixels
to the left. You need to start the data fetch before the display window,
but that will already be the case, so if you move them to the left in
equal amounts, you should be OK.

And I'm guessing here. And it may be offset to the right for a good reason
 - that all the stuff you have (sprites and fetchmode and stuff) means you
cannot position the display any further to the left, due to hardware
limitations. You might also need to move them in multiples of 32 due to
the fetchmode working in multiples of 32 on fetchmode 3.

I'm sorry to hear that as it's a great site and I would really like to see you
complete it. It would sure be a great help to a lot of people such as myself
as the manual that ships with Blitz is dreadful. 

Thanks David for that Display Adjust example too it was very helpful. 

Best wishes,

You have to use the displayadjust command(and maybe displaycontrols). It`s a
bit of a hit and miss affair. But I managed to get quite a big ntsc overscan
that way and still use 8 sprite channels(if needed).

I`ll try. I don`t know too much and you really should read the aga docs(I
attached them). 

I use these commands to open a lore ntsc overscanned screen and I did a lot of
trying out with different displayadjust parameters to get the max overscan
possible(and still use all sprites iirc ;)

InitCopList 0,21,241,$10868,8,256,-8
DisplayAdjust 0,2,-8,0,-16,0
DisplayControls 0,0,%0000000000010010,0

The paremeters which change the positions are -8,0,-16,0
The first 2 parameters 0,2 are coplist number and fetchwid(whatever that is,
maybe fetchmode?). First trye adjusting one of the paremeters starting a
minus. Those do make screen bigger vertically and horizontally(iirc -16
controls vertical). If they`d be at 0 u would have no overscan if they would
bve positive you get underscan. The 0 next to the negative parameters also
adjust something, maybe move screen to another position? Just try out. After a
while you`ll get the hang of it.

The displaycontrols command does change BPLCON3 register in this case and
switches on sprites in border(so they can go out of screen) and BRDNTRAN,
which was hmm maybe allow copper rainbow in border(which is what happens here
in my game so I guess it`s that). The zeros and ones after the % are the bits
you switch on or off in the register and bit 15 is the first and bit 00 the
last. It`s a bit of a black art but fun imo :-)

Dunno, works fine, here.

If you are opening a file for output in your second program anywhere, try
inserting "DefaultOutput" before your readfile routine. You may be reading
the file fine, but outputting the text to another file.

All the best

If you are only writing to the file, best use If WriteFile(0,"text").

And you should put a PopOutput here (not always necessary, but at least 
you can get output after you finish this :) which will set the output to 
where it was before the FileOutput 0.

> a$=Edit$(Lof(0))

I wouldn't recommend using Lof(0) to set the length of your read buffer. 
If you have no line breaks in the file, you will end up with the entire 
file in the string.

But your code looks OK, so unless I missed something it must be the full 
version of your code does something different.

Hi Everybody!

Yes, I got another problem...now that I got the Intro nearly ready (thanx
again), I started to crypt the Highscores. For this, I wrote a small
programm, that converts Normal Text into mystical top-secret code (*g*) and
saves it. 

Then I got another Programm which decrypts this mystical
top-secret-Highscore-Code and prints it in a window.

Well, but the second programm can't read the file the first program has
created. Don't know why...
But the second programm can read normal docs written with ED. 

The code of the programms:

1. (shorted)

If OpenFile(0,"text")
a$="HALLO"
FileOutput 0
Print a$
CloseFile 0
Endif

2. (also shorted)

If ReadFile(0,"text")
FileInput 0
a$=Edit$(Lof(0))
Print a$
CloseFile 0
Endif

Anyone got an Idea why this doesn't work?

Thanx,

What are you printing to the file, because it have to be normal ASCII
text or else you can't read it in with edit$ and be sure that it works.
So does the reading proggy read partial file or what. Have you looked
the output of your first proggy with text editor so that it contains
visible characters and that the first character of the file is NOT LF.
because edit$ doesn't read any characters after a LF character. So for
crypting purposes you should use binary operations.

Cant remember if these are in correct syntaxes (too long time without my
beloved Amiga)

Writing:
if openfile(0,"mycryptedfile") ; try to open the output file
  a$="mycryptedstring"
  ; do encrypting here
  writemem(0,&a$,len(a$)) ; write the manipulated string to file
  closefile(0)
endif

Reading:
if openfile(0,"mycryptedfile") ; try to open the input file
  a$=spaces(lof(0)) ; or something so that we have string that's length
matches exactly the length of the data we are going to read
  readmem(0,&a$,lof(0)) ; read the manipulated string
  closefile(0)
  ; do decrypting here
endif

Well, I tried to read the ztextfile with a normal Text-Editor, and it 
works fine. And (!) if I read the file with the text editor, and !save! 
it with the text editor (same file, no changes), the second programm 
reads the file properly...

I really get mad...;) I'll try your sourcecode, maybe that works...

@NODE "mail_94" " Floating help box "
From: John Mason <ah210@...>
Date: 05-26-01 23:35:15
Subject: @{b}Floating help box@{ub}

Hi all,

  My Wibby program (on Aminet :) ) has a floating help box that appears
after a few seconds and follows the mouse around (sorta like in wind*ws). 
Right now it does this by allocbitmap'ing the area where it's about to
open, then drawing the help box, and when it's time to go away, it draws
the data back that was overwritten.  This works well and is nice and fast,
but apparently on gfx cards the help box scrambles the graphics underneath
itself.  
Is there anything I can do about this?  I know I could open a window instead,
but that won't be nearly as fast as the way I'm doing things now.  Is
there a more gfx-card-friendly way to get my bitmap back into the window?
I'm using BltBitMapRastPort_ to restore the image.

Thanks in advance,

The bitmap is restored fine here (PicassoIV with P96), it does flicker a lot
though.

Same here, no corruption just flicker (PIV & P96). One suggestion for Wibby:

Already there! :)  Set the DEFAULTMODE tooltype to what you want, and
remove the MODERESET tooltype.

LoadFont 0,"PROGDIR:fonts/myfont.font",fontsize should work.

No this is a serious problem with blitz, it refuses to load fonts from other 
places than the fonts: assign.  I have seen no other solution than to assign 
fonts: to your drawer, or use some other fontsystem which lets you make your 
own fonts and stuff, but this is not as easy and straightforward to use as 
the intuifont stuff.

My solution to the problem was to incbin the font and if it wasn't in the 
fonts: assign it was saved to fonts:   Probably not very well liked to make 
programs that automatically write stuff to people's hd's, but what can we 
do?

It does work, although I guess if the path inside the .font file is
hardcoded to fonts: rather than just a relative path then it would not
work. See Aminet/dev/basic/viewfsrc.lha and Aminet/text/font/viewfont.lha.

I tried it now, by copying a font to t: and deleting all reference to it
from fonts: and it still works (and the font was not loaded into memory
before I copied it, since I never use that font, and I don't have any font
caching programs, and no assigns are ever made in that program).

I have also tried loading the fonts as David suggests, but can never get it
to work reliably.

Here is another way, which you will find in the source code for BeatBox2 on
my website:

http://members.nbci.com/Curt_Esser/

We used the Execute_ command to add our own fonts/ directory like this...

1 Assign a name to the current directory  (Like "Myprog:")
2 Assign FONTS: ADD Myprog:fonts/

Run your program as usual.  Now, Blitz can load you font either from the
normal Fonts: directory, or your program's own fonts/  directory.  This
gives the user the option to copy your font to Fonts: or not, as they
prefer.

DO NOT simply change the FONTS: assign to point to your own fonts/
directory!  This may cause problems with other programs that are running.

To clean up when your program exits, you can use two more Execute_ commands:

1 Assign FONTS: REMOVE Myprog:fonts/
2 Assign Remove Myprog:

Now you can end your program.

                          Curt Esser

Yes, it should be. You want to edit the .font file like this:

Offset  Size (bytes)   Description
0       2              ID number, tells you what type of font it is
2       2              Number of fonts in this .font file
4       256            Path/name to font data file (e.g. GoldED/10)
260     2              Font size
262     1              Font style
263     1              Flags
264     Repeats structure starting from the path/name to font data

Just make sure the path is always less than 256 bytes (since you need to 
get a NULL byte in there too). There's a modification to this structure 
where Tags are overlayed at the end of the string (working backwards), so 
if there isn't a NULL at the end, don't go cutting stuff out.

Wasn't there one posted to the list within the last couple of months? 
IIRC someone was having trouble using the converted font.

Have a look at the attached, it's just a straight conversion of the C 
code in the archive. I'm not sure how well it would work, but you could 
try hacking the font into an IntuiFont object too, with the code below:

; On program startup, AFTER you have called AskFont_()
Poke.l &Ruby12Font, Addr IntuiFont(0)
CopyMem &attr_Ruby12, Addr IntuiFont(0)+4, sizeof.TextAttr

; Do whatever

; On program exit BEFORE you call RemFont_()
FillMem Addr IntuiFont(0),sizeof.TextAttr+4,0
; something like that, I think it is an RI command?

Yes, you just need to set the correct flag in the gadget structure after 
you have created it. Oh, and you'll need to use pointers :). I think you 
need to do this:

GTButton ....
*g.Gadget = GTGadPtr(...)
*g\Activation = *g\Activation | #GACT_TOGGLESELECT

You might also need to set the gadget to be immediate (you can set that 
with a flag in the GTButton command).

I did that and it worked thanks. Though I use new command set and the

You have 2 options, 
    1. use NPrint instead of Print
    2. add +chr$($0A) to the end of your string

FYI '0A' is hex-ascii for the return-key

You proably knew, but just in case... :)

Hex or Chr$(*0A*) is the same as the *RETURN/ENTER* key (new line)

Subject: @{b}How to write a letter that doesn't exist? (was: File Creating&Reading)@{ub}

Well, I think I got the error. I used a hex-editor to check if there are
differences between the file my programm creates and the file, which is
written when I write the same file with an Text-Editor (ED). 

When I use ED, the text-editor puts an hex-code at the end of the file, 0A.
My programm puts nothing there.

Well, sound cool, but: How do I write the hex-code 0A to my file? Doesn't
work with Print, because there is no Ascii-Letter for the hex-code 0A...

Anyone got an Idea?

Bye,

  Mac

Not here they don't. What code do you use and what size is your 
gtmenu.obj?

Normally this works:

while ev.l<>#IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW
  ev.l=WaitEvent
  select ev
    case #IDCMP_MENUPICK
      nprint "you picked menu: ",MenuHit
  end select

Subject: @{b}Merging Backgrounds@{ub}

Hello,

Can anyone give me a simple (and fast) solution to the following,

I have a background set up on one screen and a foreground
set up on another, I need a way to somehow merge the foreground
graphics on top of the backround, kind of like DPaint's merge in front tool.
I would really like to copy the screen as a whole and not blit
individual sections of it onto the backround but it must be done
reasonably quickly. I initially thought that I might be able to use the scroll
command to copy the contents over from one screen to another but the
transparent parts of the foreground (colour 0) are not transparent so they 
do not let the background show through them. Can I change the way scrolls
are performed to allow colour 0 to be transparent? 

Any help would be great.
Jason.

Is it actually a screen you want to copy? Or just a bitmap? And would 
this be in Blitz mode or not?

The problem for that is you also need a mask (which is a one bitplane 
image to show where the foreground should be drawn). You'll need to 
generate this mask, as bitmaps do not have these by default (shapes do 
though).

The easiest way I can think of using existing commands in Blitz is this 
(watch out for line wrap and textstyles):

; You need amigalibs.res and bb2objtypes.res included in the compiler
; options

; Instead of "BitMap bmp,w,h,d" we're gonna make our own
; wdth, hght, dpth are the width, height and depth of your bitmaps
fg_bmp.l=AllocVec_((((wdth+15)&$FFF0)lsr3)*hght*dpth, 
#MEMF_CLEAR|#MEMF_PUBLIC|#MEMF_CHIP)

; If you are using Blitz mode do the previous two lines before entering it

If fg_bmp
  fg.w = 0
  CludgeBitMap fg,wdth,hght,dpth,fg_bmp
  fg_shp.w = 69 ; just some number that ain't being used by anything

  ; Here's some kuldgery-pokery fun :)
  ; NEVER FREE THIS SHAPE!!!!!!!!
  *fgs.shape = Addr Shape(fg_shape)
  *fgs\_pixwidth = wdth
  *fgs\_pixheight = hght
  *fgs\_depth = dpth
  *fgs\_ebwidth = ((wdth+15)&$FFF0)lsr3
  *fgs\_bltsize = (*fgs\_pixheight&$FFC0)lsl6 + ((*fgs\_ebwidth/2+1)&$3F)
  *fgs\_xhandle = 0
  *fgs\_yhandle = 0
  *fgs\_data = fg_bmp
  *fgs\_cookie = 0
  *fgs\_onebpmem = *fgs\_ebwidth * *fgs\_pixheight
  *fgs\_onebpmemx = (*fgs\_ebwidth + 2)* *fgs\_pixheight
  *fgs\_allbpmem = *fgs\_onebpmem * *fgs\_depth
  *fgs\_allbpmemx = *fgs\_onebpmemx * *fgs\_depth


  ; You can blit as you normally would to the bitmap.


  ; When you want to blit the foreground onto the background, do this:
  MakeCookie fg_shp
  Use BitMap bg
  Blit fg_shp,0,0

  ; At the end of the program, do this or die in guru hell!
  ; (Do this when you free the bitmap too.)
  FillMem Addr Shape(fg_shp),SizeOf.shape,0
  ; RIAmosFuncLib command
EndIf

; Do the next bit after you come out of Blitz mode
If fg_bmp : FreeVec_ fg_bmp : fg_bmp = 0 : EndIf
End


Of course, this doesn't take double buffered displays into account, but 
you should be able to modify it easily. Oh, and I've never tested it, so 
I don't know if it works. Or how fast, but that will depend on the size 
of the bitmap and how often you need to do a MakeCookie (i.e. if your 
foreground never changes, you only need to do it once, but if it changes 
every time round a loop, you must do a MakeCookie every time round the 
loop).

My guess is that it would be pretty slow (a single MakeCookie command 
needs to read 8 bitplanes [assuming the depth of your bitmap is 8] and 
write 1 bitplane). I'd guess it uses the blitter (therefore also chipmem) 
which would make it stop your program while it works. Actually, if it did 
use the blitter and you had an 8 bitplane bitmap, it would need to read 
11 bitplanes (8 planes + read mask 3 times) and write to the mask 
bitplane 4 times. The blitter runs at a clock cycle of 1/7.09MHz = 140ns 
and each blitter operation needs a number of clock cycles (called ticks 
here and in the RKRMs). So assuming a 320x256x8 foreground bitmap, it 
will take:

30 ticks (the minimum I could work out)* 20 (words per line) * 256 
(lines) * 140ns = 21.504 milliseconds.

Which at 50 frames per second is a whole frame (and a bit). And that 
doesn't include any time it takes for the blitter to logically OR the 
data together at each stage (tho' I'm not sure if that takes any 
measurable time). This also doesn't include any time taken by the CPU to 
do the function calls and set up the blitter. And it also doesn't include 
any time take by other DMA processes (sound, disk drive, etc).

There are a few tricks you can use to give your program a higher 
throughput or make it run a bit faster (the first would be make sure you 
don't call MakeCookie every time round a loop :). If you want the ideas, 
tell me and I'll send a list (didn't want to make this mail any longer 
:). They'll mostly be based on writing your own assembly language 
routines to replace some of the Blitz ones though.

Check the Internal.txt for the ChunkyResource-structure.

Get hold of the address of the MBitmap with MAddrBitmap() and you will find
the
address of the graphics at an offset of 8.

Subject: @{b}MUI ListViews.@{ub}

Hi,

Could anyone give me some example code on the following topic? ;)

I want to have an MUI window in my app. that has two listviews. Between
them, two buttons. Underneath the right listview, four buttons (see attached
mock-up)

When the user clicks the "<" button, the selected entry from the right LV
moves to the left LV, and vice versa when ">" is clicked.

The four at the bottom of the right LV control the order of the items in the
right LV.

Later in the program, I want to move through the items in the right LV,
starting from the top and moving down, and noting down their contents.

Is this possible?

Please help!!! I'm totally inexperienced with MUI ListViews! :/

Cheers,
GazChap.

Remapping will always be necessary, except maybe on 15/16/24/32 bit 
screenmodes. Even then it might still be necessary to do some conversion.

See the attached (the NImageGadget example which I have modified). It 
works on P96 on UAE (both 8 bit and 24 bit), so I hope it would work on 
other things too. It mostly uses NCS commands, but the source is a bit of 
a mess - it doesn't use statements or functions and doesn't allocate 
things as it needs them. But you should be able to change it if you need. 
The remapping code might be a bit slow (although I guess it will not be 
noticably slower with small shapes).

 Thanks, you're my saviour dude! Source is already fixed and fit into my

I'd tell you if I knew :) but I don't have a system which uses CGX to 
test it on. It should work, but I guess someone on this list with CGX

It was in the appendix for the big A4 book I have (the one with the black

be in the small white ring-bound book.

Oh, and when I say information, it's typical Blitz docs. It tells you what
is inthe structure, but not what the fields are used for. You'd be as well
putting blitzlibs:bb2objtypes.res in the compiler options and then viewing
the newtypes from the menu.

What structure is it you are looking for?

Well it's nice when it is possible to use programs in native language. I do
that in the David's way. I create a text file with translation. But the to
chose the the language I use ToolTypes. In program's icon I put :
LANGUAGE=ENGLISH (ie.) and in my program I read this line by

GetIconObject "Progname"
LANGUAGE$=FindToolValue("LANGUAGE")
FreeconObject

Then I check if the textfile exists end if does then I open in that way as
David describe.

Subject: @{b}Playing .it modules@{ub}

Hi all,

Does anyone know if it's possible to play music modules in the .it format
(Impulse Tracker...I think) on an Amiga, if yes is there a program somewhere
that does this? Also is there a way to convert them to the normal .mod format
for use in Blitz. 

Thanks,
Jason.

I've been able to use DeliTracker to play some IT mods, but not all... I
don't remember if DT has the ability to convert to 4 channel mods or not;
but I don't think that would be possible with a 32 channel IT mod, unless
it made one big sample that contained the whole IT song :)

You shouldn't need to, you can just use "PROGDIR:" - it's an assign that
is automatically set up for each program when they are run on the system
by the OS. And each program's PROGDIR: assign is correct for that program.

The only time it doesn't work, just like Nick's code, is if you use
"Compile & Run" from the Blitz2 editor.

Use My bit of code from Stats&Funcs:

; Function : ProgsDir {}

; Author : Nick Clover - nick@...

; Returns a string with the program's directory.

; IMPORTANT! Only works with compiled executables,as
; Compiling & Running doesn't use a directory (obviously ;)

; **** REPLACEMENT by Nick Clover ****
; Now returns program directory when run from WB as well!
; Cool :)

; UPDATE - renamed to ProgsDir, to keep in line with ProgsName,
;          because ProgDir is a BLITZ Support Suite command.

Function.s ProgsDir{}

  MaxLen path$=200
  NameFromLock_ GetProgramDir_(),&path$,200
  path$=Peek$(&path$)
  If Right$(path$,1)<>":" AND Right$(path$,1)<>"/"
    path$+"/"
  EndIf
  If path$="SYS:" Then path$="I only work when compiled!"
Function Return path$
End Function

; demo :

;; note that this returns a name only from executables!
;; you'll just get a blank string if you run it from Blitz!

Hi coders!

I need to write a mod player (for protracker modules), i get some docs about

I saw some players as the HippoPlayers which are able to detect the finish
of a mod.
How can i calc its lenght for example in 1/50 of sec?

For a simple guideline, most modules end when the next pattern to jump to is
pattern 0. It's not always the case, but  the few exceptions are always
purposely made that way.

HippoPlayer can detect the finish of a mod, but it is done by checking a
track position. There is somewhere variable indicating which track player is
playing currently. When it is set backwards, mod loops.

EC> How can i calc its lenght for example in 1/50 of sec?

With vanilla player you can't. You must develope your own routines for
this purpose... Sorry, never tried but it is possible if you know protracker
well enough.

I've looked at the BREXX Commands, but i can't seeme to do anything
else than move the mouse pointer with these commands.

Do you got a small example please?

I can't remember what the original message was, but you don't use BRexx 
to deal with events. It would just be something like this:

AddIDCMP #IDCMP_VANILLAKEY
Window 0,0,0,400,300,$100f,"fff",-1,-1
While ev.l<>#IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW
    ev = WaitEvent
    Select ev
        Case #IDCMP_RAWKEY
            NPrint "Key pressed: ",EventCode
        Case #IDCMP_VANILLAKEY
            NPrint "Key pressed: ",EventCode," (",Chr$(EventCode),")"
    End Select
Wend

Although I think the first message meant to use the RawStatus() command 
instead of the EventCode command. However, that would mean you would have 
to call rawstatus for every key you want to check.

??? Nope, everything (V, IBrowse, AWeb, YAM, BlackIRC, AmiTradeCenter) 
I've tried so far works fine with bsdsocket emulation, although I've
heard there are problems with ICQ. That's with WinUAE 0.8.8r8 on WinNt4.
If you really needed to use a stack, I guess you could run Miami and make
use of the serial port to control the modem from WinUAE, but you shouldn't
need to do that.

And to bring it back on topic :), IIRC there were some problems trying to
find your own IP address with the tcplib.

Hi David,

thanks for your replay.
Ok, that was a real stupid sentence. The problem is that I cannot get my
Modem run with Miami. The Modem works with the pc, it works with the amiga,
but Miami/UAE always says, that the Carrier won't work ;-(( So I cannot get
a dialup-connection.

For the bsd-emulation, do I have to do any configuration to make it run ?

You don't need Miami in WinUAE -- you just check "bsd emulation" or whatever
it is in WinUAE's GUI, then run your Amiga net apps. If Windows is online,
WinUAE is online :)

What are the "valid" values to use in set period? The ones which make the
sound change period I mean ofcourse.

I can't find my test code right now, but as I recall around  300  will play
the sound at it's normal pitch.  Anyway try starting there and see what
happens.

Lower values will make it play slower, and higher values make it play faster
(higher pitch)

Yeah I sort of figured that out, but I wondered about the limits. For example,
it doesn`t go right up in pitch when going from 0 to 1 to 2 etc. And what`s
the biggest value.
