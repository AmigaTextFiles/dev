						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

SetPatch QUIET

Does this term work with sushi and print text to console ?

copy s:startup-sequence ser:

Sashimi work well with kprintf and maybe fail only when write to ser:

Hi Bernd,

You could try

copy s:startup-sequence CON:

You can also specify the format of the console window using the / separated values immediately after 
CON:. I cannot remember what they are, but they are in the standard (i.e. user) OS docs somewhere.

If you really want a kprintf like command, I added some code in the bbgtlib for doing this.

oh yes thanks i remember

I think its a good choose to make a kprintf function too in AB2 so profiler
log and debugmessages can print out

The  Cos,Sin and Tan commands take Radians instead of degrees as the input 
units.
Dunno why Acid favoured radian, since most people use degrees..stupid kiwis 
;)

Anyway, if you don`t know what Radians are (maybe you were fast asleep 
during maths lessons that day), there are 2*pi rads = 360 degrees ( or pi 
rads=180 degs !)

Hi Terie, is Stefano Maria from Italy here!
I must let know that Blitz trigonometric function like Sin() e Cos() need the angle between brackets expressed in Radiants; for example 360° (Degree) in Radiants is Pi*2 (that is 6,28)

@NODE "mail_16" " Enforcer Hits in Blitzlibs "
From: Thilo Köhler <koehlerthilo@...>
Date: 01-05-03 20:44:37
Subject: @{b}Enforcer Hits in Blitzlibs@{ub}

Hi All!

I am not an expert how Blitzlibs are build but
I recently noticed the following:

The Blitzlibs seem to have an "init code" that
is executed BEFORE the first command line in my program. And sadly
some of them have bugs/enforcerhits that lead sooner or
later to a crash (at least on Amithlon).
E.g. the library providing "sound", "loadsound", "period" etc.
is killing AHI if the Paula driver is running even if the commands
are never used.

I have programs written that have this problems and some not.
So I wanted to find out which of the libs cause this enforcer hits
to warn about this libs but it is simply far to much work. So is there
any possibility to find out which libs are used ? Maybe it is possible to do
it
in the way Newtypes are displayed just in a window listing
all used Libs ? This would be very helpful.

Thanks for any comments about that,

Thilo

There`s a little app/tool I got from the blitz2000 website (but for the life 
of me I can`t remember what it`s called!) that`ll check the source code and 
display a list of how many commands are called for each library used. I 
think it was more for optimisation purposes than debugging, but it should do 
what you want.

As for your sound problems, does Enforcer show a hit on the sound lib`s init 
code, or does AHI stop/jitter when it happens ?
If it`s the latter, I think it`s just the way Blitz hits paula directly..but 
as you say, Blitz does this init stuff before your app`s code, so there`s 
nothing you can do apart from not using the built in sound commands :((   
(well apart from hassle Bernd to rewrite the lib to be AHI aware )

Although it is not integrated into Blitz, Curt Esser wrote (and Tony Rolfe updated) a small tool 
called Investigator which tells you what libraries are used in your source code.

Investigator3 is the latest one, should be on Aminet and Blitz2000. It might even be in the AmiBlitz 
distribution if you got the one with all the extra tools.

OK, thanks I will check out the investigator.

The Soundlib was just an example what nasty things can happen
if you use a lib and you can try to search for the bug and never find it
because it happens already in the init code. In this case the 
libs hits the hardware even if you play no sound and AHI output
is killed.

The are some libs doing very bad stuff and I have to find out
which.

BTW: The StringGadget command of the gadgetslib
(NOT Davids Gadtools lib) causes a lot of
enforcer hits and crashes Amithlon sooner or later.
Is this known and is there an update or do I have to
rewrite my proggy with Davids GT lib ?

Ciao,

Thilo

A lot of libraries are like this because Acid were never very respectful of the OS and a lot of 
cool things we have now did not exist back then (e.g. AHI).

One sure-fire way of escaping the problems is to use OS calls directly (well, and hope that the 
OS library interface for that library is not broken :)

> The are some libs doing very bad stuff and I have to find out

From what I remember the problems are mainly caused by:
- Acid libraries which work with the OS
- Some RWE libraries
- Elmore libraries (a lot)

Use gadtools if possible. The commands are not too much different and you will gain more 
features (I do not think you lose any). The gadgetslib is a GUI library for OS 1.3(!). Even 
gadtools nowadays is "outdated" (since they are trying to make Reaction the standard GUI).

If interpol is on it, then ok. I just needed to know if I was the only one
who got it, or if everyone did. We have had an almost identical incident
like this one i Norway once before a few year ago. Unfortunatly one person
got killed(or was he just injured?) when he refused to cooperate after he
was involved. Anyway I just threw myselves over the phone and called the media,
asking them to check it up against their records. Havent heard anything yet...

Anyway, thanks to everyone for all your replies :)

@NODE "mail_24" " Modifying Screen Tags "
From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 01-08-03 22:43:34
Subject: @{b}Modifying Screen Tags@{ub}

Hi there,

Is there a way to modify the tags of a screen that's already open. I'm trying to
force a particular private screen to be public, and whilst I can modify the
screens flags to include the public flag, I also need to modify (or set)
#PubName, #PubSig and #PubTask, but can't find a way to do it :o/

Thanks.

All the best



Steve

Use PubScreenStatus_(*screen,flag)
And flag is either #PSNF_PRIVATE to make it private or 0 to make it public. You don`t 
need to change #PubName, #PubSig and #PubTask, you should set those when you open the 
screen and they will be used when you make a screen public. There is no way afaik to 
set these later.

Not what I was hoping for, but what I suspected. As it happens, I don't open the
screen (I'm trying to patch the Wordworth screen), so I have no control when
the screen is opened. Ahh, well, back to ModePro and rexx script to disable it
for anything that doesn't like it (Myst, ADoom using directcgx, warp 3D etc.)
:o(

Thanks anyway.

Hi Joar, is Stefano Maria from Italy here!
Take a look at the attachment of this message;
This source code should be the solution for your problem;
If I remember correctly, you must load the desired module with LoadModule, then set an interrupt number 5 (SetInt 5 and EndSetInt, or something similar) and type inside PlayModule, that will make your music run indipendently from your program.

Hi Blitz & AmiBlitz users!
I have some hints to give to you and specifically to Bernd Roesh:

1) Try to launch the MenuEdit program without the font.prefs (to try this, simply rename it temporarly with a different name, you don't need to delete it!); on both my AMIGA A1200 and my WinUAE emulated AMIGA it give a crash!

2) I have downloaded yesterday the AmiBlitz min distribution and I have installed it on my emulated AMIGA; I have changed the AmiBlitz screen resolution and, after this, I am not abled to use again the AmiBlitz environment without a crash, this until I have deleted the PED.prefs.

3) I have found the voice Wizard in the custom menu of AmiBlitz; I have removed it because it leads to nowhere on my system; however I think if will it be of some use when will it bugfixed?

Hopeing to has been of some help to all you, I send many thanks and many greetings from Milan, Italy!

Ok I think I now found right syntax to cause that bug I mentioned earlier. If you do this:

The !" part will show up in the same colour as what has been set for Macros. That is white in my

In dem deflibs von mir ist das drinne aber ich habe vergessen das obj file
reinzutun

Auf jedenfall sollte das stormwizard demo laufen (Verzeichnisse anzeigen)
Mit der 2.26 lib tuts das nämlich nicht

Anbei mal alle blitzlibs amigalibs

Da ist auch die mpega/camd library mit ner offiziellen nummer nun drinne 5
und 6
Nummern über 200 sind ja laut doku in distri frei für eigenbedarf

Soll das bedeuten, daß ich die Distri und das Update mit den Sachen hier
