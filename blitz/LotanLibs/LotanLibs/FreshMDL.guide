@Node Intr "FreshMDL : Introduction"

  @{b}@{u}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}

    I created @{fg highlight}FreshMDL@{fg text} because I was really tired of @{b}MakeDefLibs@{ub} and @{b}LibMan@{ub}, tired to
    join  ALL  the  drawers everytime I wanted to test one of my own set of commands.
    Moreover @{b}MakeDefLibs@{ub} is so slow and big...

    So I made @{fg highlight}FreshMDL@{fg text}.

    @{fg highlight}FreshMDL@{fg text} uses temporary files in each drawer found in  @{i}BlitzLibs:@{ui}.  So  when  you
    want  to  create the @{i}DefLibs@{ui} @{fg highlight}FreshMDL@{fg text} joins all those files and not all the libs.
    Updating @{i}DefLibs @{ui}is really simple and fast.

    @{fg highlight}FreshMDL@{fg text} recognise executable files, so you can leave sources of your libs in the
    drawers.  @{fg highlight}FreshMDL@{fg text}  is  also  very  small,  only  8  Ko comparing to the 12 Ko of
    @{b}MakeDefLibs@{ub} or the 34 Ko of @{b}LibMan@{ub}.

    @{fg highlight}FreshMDL@{fg text} is @{i}If_you_don't_send_me_some_thing_I'll_kill_the_cat_Ware@{ui}. If  you  find
    it  useful  (sure  you  will  :-),  try  to  send me what you want to my address.
    Therefore, it's freely distribuable so spread it like you want !

    I'm looking for:
      - Keyfiles of your own program
      - Björk stuff
      - Friends videos
      - Cookies
      - Old games (Amiga, MegaDrive, SNes, GameBoy and N64 ;-)
      - Post cards.
      - Chocolate.
      - Various CDs.
      - Money 8-)
      - Something made by you...

  @{b}@{u}Using FreshMDL@{ub}@{uu}

    @{b}First use@{ub}
    When you use it for the first time @{fg highlight}FreshMDL@{fg text} creates  a  temporary  file  in  each
    drawer.  These temporaty files (@{i}.libs.tmp@{ui}) will be used to create @{i}DefLibs@{ui}. Once a
    temporary file is created it is added to the @{i}DefLibs@{ui} file.

    @{b}Updating@{ub}
    To update a @{i}.libs.tmp@{ui} you can either delete it (then  it  will  be  made  calling
    @{fg highlight}FreshMDL@{fg text}) or CD to the directory that you want to update and enter :

      @{i}@{bg text}@{fg shine}BlitzLibs:MyLibs>@{bg background}@{fg text} @{ui}FreshMDL dir

    You can also gives the name of the directory you want to update :

      @{i}@{bg text}@{fg shine}Sys3.0:>@{bg background}@{fg text} @{ui}FreshMDL MyLibs

    To update all @{i}.libs.tmp@{ui} and also update your @{i}DefLibs@{ui} enter :

      @{i}@{bg text}@{fg shine}Sys3.0:>@{bg background}@{fg text} @{ui}FreshMDL all

    To only update @{i}DefLibs@{ui} enter :

      @{i}@{bg text}@{fg shine}Sys3.0:>@{bg background}@{fg text} @{ui}FreshMDL
