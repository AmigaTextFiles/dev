@node intro "Introduction"

    First of all, forget everything about GUI programming in @{"Blitz2" link "blitz2"}. It
    is not the same creating a GadTool-GUI or a TRITON GUI.

    Read this documentation carefully, so you really understand the
    difference.

    I wish to thank a lot Rupert "HelpApp" Henson, without his help
    this conversion could not been finished. He had the trick how to
    do the Project-TagList and helped me converting the macros.
    Now this trick is obsolete due to the @{"Taglistlib" link "thx"} from D.C.J. Pink.

@node things "Some useful definitions"

    When speaking of @{"TRITON" link "triton"}, there are to major terms:

        an application: That is your program. The informations
                        (application tags) are for use in the
                        TRITON Preferences Editor (ShareWare)

        a project     : In fact, that's your GUI. For every
                        window you use, you create a new project.

    Second, every string passed to any TRITON library function has
    to be passed using Null(s$) because these functions need the 
    adress of a null-terminated string.

    *NEVER* use an ID of zero for anything (window, button etc.)

    If you ever break your program with the debugger when the window
    was already open, do *NOT* end it with the debugger, instead
    continue the program and close the window. Otherwise TRITON will
    not close the window what causes confusion when you restart your
    program!

            @{" Go back " link "main"}

@endnode

@node start "How to install TRITON on your Blitz2 system"

    First of all: Before you can use this package, you have to get at least the
    TRITON developer archive from aminet/dev/gui. Take also a look at
    the TRITON user archive in aminet/util/libs. It contains the very good
    TRITON preference editor.


    IF YOU DON'T HAVE THESE ARCHIVES, THIS PACKAGE IS WORTHLESS TO YOU!

	If you are not sure which library-IDs are free on your system, get the
	program "ViewLibs" or the new library manager "LibMan". Both should be
	avaiable on any @{"Blitz2-ftp-site" link "blitz2"}. Just type "ViewLibs"
	in the shell, it'll show up all libraries with their IDs. Using LibMan,
	start it and change view to "Sort by ID".

    When you have the developer archive, you have to @{"convert" link "conv"} the 
    file "@{b}triton/developer/fd/triton_lib.fd@{ub}" with FDConvert. This program you should find in
    your Blitz2:BBTools-drawer or on any @{"Blitz2-ftp-site" link "blitz2"}.
	
    Put the converted library in "blitzlibs:amigalibs"

    Then, you should compile the "@{"taglistlib.bb2" system "more blitzlibs/userlibs/taglistlib.bb2"}" file to
    "TagListlib.obj" and put this into "blitzlibs:userlibs". Take
    care, that the library ID of 10 is free. If not, change the
    constant #Taglistlib from 10 to the id that fits to your system. And
    remember, before you compile the library, include "blitzlibs:libmacs.res"
    in the resident file list of the compiler options menu (Amiga-o)

    To make sure that you check for a free ID, I changed the libray ID in the
    source code to "xx" which will produce an error if you compile it. Just
    exchange the "xx" to your favourite free library ID.

    Now delete your old "deflibs" file and create a new one with
    MakeDefLibs, or, if you use Blitz2.1, run @{"LibMan" link "blitz2"}.

    Reload Blitz2 and try typing "TR_OpenProject_" (without quotes) and
    press the HELP-Key on your keyboard. Do the same typing
    "InitTagList" (without quotes) and press the help key again.

    If it turns to your tokencolor and a short helptext appears in your titlebar,
    then you did everything right.

    To be able to use the TRITON include-file "triton.bb2", you have
    to save it first with Blitz2, so that it will be tokenised!

@endnode

@node conv "Converting 'triton_lib.fd' with FDConv"

	Start a shell.
	cd to the appropriate directory where the triton_lib.fd file is.
	Type "FDConv triton_lib.fd"
	FDConv asks now for the library name.
	Type "triton.library"
	It'll then suggest a library ID.
	Ignore this suggestion and type a free ID in, e.g. 12
	The converted library will automatically be added to the
	Blitzlibs:userlibs/ directory.

	@{b}Take care that the IDs of TRITON.library and the taglistlib are
	different!!!!!@{ub}

@endnode

@node program "How to program a TRITON user interface?"

    The use and syntax of the commands of the taglistlibrary can easily
    be taken from the library source. 
    The use and syntax of the commands of TRITON.library can be taken
    from the autodoc file which comes with the TRITON developer archive.

    Remember that you are using system library calls. You get all the
    keywords from the TRITON archive's autodoc file, just add an under-
    score to them. You mustn't write i.e. TR_OpenProject but instead
    TR_OpenProject_

	If you plan programs with more than 5 taglists, don't forget to
	increase the amount in 'compiler options' !


    Now we can start:

    Of course, first come the includes (remember amigalibs.res!) and
    the most important variable initialisation.

        INCLUDE "blitz2:bbincludes/libraries/TRITON.bb2"    ; or wherever you
                                                            ; put it.
        InitTaglist 2,10                    ; making place for our application
        InitTagList 1,20                    ; making place for 20 tags
                                            ; in the first taglist

        Use TagList 2                       ; and use the app. taglist

    Now, we could tell @{"TRITON" link "triton"}, that we launch a new application, our
    program. Therefore, TRITON wants to know something about our
    program for its prefs program.

    The tags you can use, are:

        #TRCA_Name
        #TRCA_LongName
        #TRCA_Info
        #TRCA_Version
        #TRCA_Release
        #TRCA_Date

        And it looks like this in your code:

            @{b}AddTags #TRCA_Name,Null("TritonTemplate")
            AddTags #TRCA_LongName,Null("TritonTemplate")
            AddTags #TRCA_Info,Null("Looks like a template")
            AddTags #TAG_END,0 @{ub}

        Now we open our application. Remember that this variable MUST
        be long!

            @{b}application.l=TR_CreateApp_ (TagList)@{ub}

        Before we continue, we have to check that nothing has
        happened.

            @{b}if (application)

                ... code ...@{ub}

        Now we create our GUI. First, we want to do a window with two
        buttons. So we use the prepared Taglist:

            @{b}Use TagList 1@{ub}


        Therefore we use the macros. For the window, the most
        important ones are:

            !WindowID{id}   - the ID must not be zero!!!

            !WindowPosition{@{"positionflag" link "posflag"}}

            !WindowTitle{Null("Window title")}
                as you remember, strings and text must always
                be passed with the Null(string) command!!

            !WindowFlags{@{"flag1|flag2|flag3|..." link "winflags"}}

        If you create your Taglist with the TagListLib, then remember that
        the last Tag must be #TAG_END,0 

        Now we come to our Buttons. All Gadget are grouped in @{"TRITON" link "triton"}.
        There are two major kind of Groups: horizontal and vertical
        aligned groups. Depending on if you want your gadgets
        horizontal or vertikal aligned :) you must choose between
        these groups. Of course, they can be mixed. So you can make
        4 Buttons in 2 horizontal groups and put these groups into a
        vertical group. Every group must be ended with the !EndGroup
        macro.

            Groups : !HorizGroup, !VertGroup    
                        (arrangement of buttons: look into the include file!
                         A Group @{b}must@{ub} always end with the macro !EndGroup)

            Buttons: !Button{Null("T_ext"),id}   
                        (Shortcuts are marked by an underscore in front of the Key)

        The code looks like this:

@{b}
            AddTags !VertGroupA
            AddTags     !Space
            AddTags     !HorizGroupA
            AddTags         !Space
            AddTags         !Button{Null("_Save"),12}
            AddTags         !Button{Null("_Cancel"),15}
            AddTags         !Space
            AddTags     !EndGroup
            AddTags     !Space
            AddTags !EndGroup
            AddTags #TAG_END,0
@{ub}

        You should type your code always structured to keep the context
        in mind. It's easier to overview ;)

        Now we can open our window, i.e. our project which MUST also be
        a variable of long!

@{b}            project.l=TR_OpenProject_(application,TagList)@{ub}

        Now comes the real program:
@{b}
            if (project)   ; only if no error occured

                close_me.b=False      ; let the window open

                while NOT close_me    ; and as long as it's open
                    TR_Wait(application,0)     ;wait for a message

                    *trmsg.TR_Message=TR_GetMsg_(application)
                                    ; what does the user do??

                    while (*trmsg)   ; as long as it's valid

                        if (*trmsg\trm_Project=project)    ; it's for our window

                          select *trmsg\trm_Class       ; which message?

                            case #TRMS_CLOSEWINDOW
                                close_me=True

                            case #TRMS_ACTION           ; a button was triggered

                              select *trmsg\trm_ID      ; which one?

                                case 1
                                    ; button 1
                                    ; code

                                case 2
                                    ; button 2
                                    ; code

                              end select

                            case #TRMS_NEWVALUE     ; check for i.e. checkboxes
                                                    ; and some other gadgets which
                                                    ; return this message instead
                                                    ; of #TRMS_ACTION. You need it only if
                                                    ; you have such a gad in your GUI.          
                          end select
                        endif

                        *trmsg=TR_GetMsg_ (application) ; and get the next

                    wend
                wend

              TR_CloseProject_ project         ; close our window
            else
                NPrint "Unable to create project"       ; if it failed
            endif

            TR_DeleteApp_ application          ; and tell TRITON that
                                                ; our program was terminated
         else

         endif

    To see all the macros and constants, take a look at the Blitz
    include file "@{"TRITON.bb2" system "more bbincludes/libraries/triton.bb2"}"or at the C include file "triton.h"

    To see how to do other gadgets (some send TRMS_NewValue messages!) and what
    more functions the TRITON library offers, take a look at the autodoc file, 
    the demolistings or ask @{"me" link "author"} directly.

    The use of QuickHelp is shown in @{i}TOOLMANAGER1a.bb2@{ui}, also the
    use of Blitz2-Lists for the @{"ListView" link "LV"}

    A special case is TRITON s @{"Easyrequester" link "TREZ"}, which
    replaces the system's requester.

        firmed by return, the button is triggered. How can I avoid 
        this?@{ub}

     A: Use the macro !StringGadgetNR instead of !_StringGadget.

     @{b}Q: I want to use a fixed width font, how to do it?@{ub}

     A: Very easy: When you do your windowtags, just add this line:

        AddTags #TRWI_FixedWidthFontAttr,font

        where font is initialised as font.TextAttr=Null("name.font"),size

                If you just want to use the system's fixed width font, then you
                can go on and use the !FW... macros without setting the
                #TRWI_Fixed... constant.

     @{b}Q: How do I get the string of a string-gadget?@{ub}

     A: You have to peek$ to the pointer.

        *text=TR_GetAttribute(*project,stringID,0)
        text$=peek$(*text)

    I think you got now the difference between a GadTools (or, worse,
    a Blitz) GUI and @{"TRITON" link "triton"}. But from now on you just don't need to
    care about fontsensitivity and calculating positions of gadgets.

    You should only take the above example as a model to program
    a TRITON GUI. I have to admit that I didn't change the other
    demo listings to this way, so just take them to see how to
    create other gadgets or layouts. Take care of these rules:

        a) use goto and/or gosub rarely in your program. This
           is a not very good style which should be avoided as often
           as possible. Blitz2 offers many possibilities for it:
           statements and functions.

        b) Every macro that has the same name as a Blitz2-Keyword
           begins with an Underscore. So the original macro
           !StringGadget{...} is named !_StringGadget{...}. If a
           TRITON macro turns yellow in your TED, just put a "_"
           in front :)

        c) Before getting a message, use TR_Wait_ *app,otherbits

        d) Always check that your project/application was opened!

        e) Reply every Message you get from TRITON.

        f) To program, use the macros - they are the easiest way
           to create a TRITON GUI. To explain all macros would
           exceed this little docu, but just take a look at either
           the Blitz2-Includes or the original C-Includes (in
           "TRITON/developer/includes/libraries"). The name of all
           constants and macros should be self-explaining. Try them
           out!

           You really should take a deep look at the Blitz2-include
           file TRITON.bb2, just to see what kinds of gadgets you
           can create and what the macro names are for!
           And you should also take a even deeper look at the autodoc
           file in TRITONs developer archive.

    But always remember: Due to the TRITON Preferences Editor, the
    user can not only change the look of the gadgets but also place
    your window(s) on any screen he likes. So do never use fixed
    coords! In fact, you do not need to size your window - the user
    can change it and it will be safed in ENV: and ENVARC:, so with
    every startup of your program, the window opens in the same
    dimensions and coords where the user closed it last.

    You should keep in mind, that this file does some system calls to show you the
    include file and some sources. If you change the path or the location of this
    guidefile, these calls may end in an error.

@node future "The end and the future"

    So I wish you happy blitzing with @{"TRITON" link "triton"} and hope to see some
    of your programs which use TRITON. I'd really appreciate, if you
    send me just a few words when you finished a program that uses TRITON,
    so we are able to create a TRITON-Applications-list as exists for MUI.

    I included a little program called "memo" to this package - it can
    only be started via CLI and pops up a TRITON requester with your text
    in it. You need two arguments!

    memo "Hello World!" "Remember to write Philipp!!"

    This program could be used with CyberCron, DCron etc. for
    reminding.

               **********************************************


   Triton  is  an  object  oriented  GUI creation system for AmigaOS.  Triton
makes  it much easier to create good looking graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
than GadTools, BOOPSI or other systems.  Complicated things like resizability
of  windows  or  a fully font sensitive gadget layout are handled entirely by
Triton.

   Furthermore  Triton  GUIs  can  be  configured  by  means of a Preferences
editor,  including  e.g.  a screen and a window manager  for most comfortable
GUI management.


   There is a mailing list for discussions and questions about Triton.
If you have any problems with Triton or simply want to get in touch
with other developers who are using Triton, you can subscribe to the
list.

   In that case, send EMail to majordomo@mail.im.net with any subject
and the line `subscribe triton' in the body of your message. If you
want the list mail to be sent to a different EMail address (and *only*
if you want this), please use `subscribe triton
a.different@email.address' instead (after replacing
`a.different@email.address' with the address to send the mail to of
course).

   In order to unsubscribe from the list, simply follow the above
rules, replacing `subscribe' by `unsubscribe'.

   If you need more help, send mail to majordomo@mail.im.net with a line
`help' in the body.

@node changes "Changes since release 1.0"

    I eliminated some typos. If you still find some, write me immediately!
    
    I tried to fix the macro !ListROC{} but couldn't finde the bug. Blitz
    still reports the macro being to long. Sorry that you can't use it, you
    just have to do it "by hand".

    @{b}Release 1.1@{ub}

    The macro !ListROC{} works now.

@node save "For advanced programmers"

    There is a way to make your executables a lot smaller when using
    TRITON.

    First, you don't have to use Null() to pass strings to TRITON. You
    could type &string$ instead as the Blitz2-Strings are all
    zero-terminated. I recommend Blitz2 v1.9 at least to be sure that
    this will work!
    Remember then, that the strings must not be changed until they have
    been used by TRITON, which is usually after TR_CreateApp_

    You can also use a label reference to pass the strings. Remember,
    that if you use Functions/Statements, you have to create new
    labels for each Function/Statement!.

    To get a view how these tricks work in reality, read the source
    of the listing "memo2.bb2" which is written and commented by
    Daniel Pink.
