						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

@NODE "mail_0" " 24bit images/gtshapes in blitz (image.include) "
From: Thilo Köhler <koehlerthilo@...>
Date: 01-26-02 15:30:21
Subject: @{b}24bit images/gtshapes in blitz (image.include)@{ub}

Hi all!

It is done.
Here is the include file if you want to use
24bit (or whatever you want) images in your
Blitz programs. You can also convert them into
a blitz shape and use it with GTShape.

It uses datatypes for loading images, so you can
have any fileformat which has a datatype installed.
(e.g. iff, jpg, gif, pcx, bmp)

Drawbacks:
No real transparency is povided, because the shapes
are remapped and it is very unlikely that your shapes backgroundcolor
will be mapped to color 0 which is turned into transparency with
"makecookie". Maybe someone has an idea how to do this.

It uses guigfx (and render) library. So if you want to use it
you have to remake your deflibs with the guigfx.library1 included,
or create your own with the .fd file from the guigfx archive (Aminet).
(beware of libclashes !!!)

The include has to be regarded as alpha version, so maybe
there are some bugs or room for improvement, any suggestions are
welcome.

Have fun,

Thilo

P.S. And don't forget to set the right pathes for the include files,

Excellent!

I wasn't aware you could have transparent GTShape gadgets - there is no
mask storage in the Image structure, so it's unlikely unless you were
copying the background to your shape.

The libnumber you've used (123) seems to be free - so I suggest we use 123
as the "official" number for this library. Any comments anyone?

From: Brian Hills <brian@...>

Subject: @{b}256 color-cycling?@{ub}

Hi all,
Am still trying for 256 color cycling.
Surely someone has played with this?
I am definately in aga, as my code has 256 color
pallette selector coded by me, which shows all 256
colors, and will shade or modify any color range.
(shameless plug, see my source in gfx/frac dir on Aminet
'Fraktool-fractal generator in Blitz Basic)
The cycle code in this is not correct,as will only cycle
first time selected, I have since corrected but
managed 32 colors only - maybe my library for aga
needs updating?
The code in 'Fraktool' opens an aga hi-res screen and window, sets up
'menus', a small fractal generator loop, the other bits
are merely 'gosub' subroutines, all the usual things
associated with fractal proggies, (even 'invert fractal')

......Screen 0,0,0,640,512,8,$8004,"",1,2
      Window 0,0,0,640,512,$1433,"",1,2,0


subroutine 'Cykle'

......Setcycle 0,0,4,31,speed   (0-31 colors, OK!)
      Cycle 0
      Return


but not (0-255)!
 
can anyone help? I would be gratefull.

Hello Brian

Why you dont write your own cycling
routine using something like

for n.l=0 to 255
  index.l = (n + offset) mod 256
  RGB n,red_vlaue(index),green_value(index),blue_value(index)
next


This would solve your problem, or am I wrong ?

Looking in my 2.1 blitz manual (both remaining pages!) there are 2 commands 
for colour cycling
CyclePalette (Palette#)
and Cycle(Palette#)

If you tried Thilo`s example palette cycling routing and found that works, 
then it`s 99.9% safe to assume the Cycle command is leftover from the old 
OCS/ECS days.
Dunno if the CyclePalette command was in the V1.7 you have though..

Thanks for suggestion, Thilo...but...
Tried similar to above,sure can do it....

Naah, For/next loop too slow, need asm routine, anyone?
seems the aga library routines may not support
greater than 32 colours for cycling.
I've tried every which way using 'cyclepalette 0',
'setcycle',etc.

code follows for 32 colours (error with 255!)

Screen 0,0,0,640,491,8,$8004,"",1,2
Window 0,0,0,640,491,$1433,""1,2,0
Loadscreen 0,"a 256 colour piccy.iff"
Loadpalette 0,"a 256 colour piccy.iff"
SetCycle 0,0,4,31,.3

You don`t need asm..the problem is the refresh rate of the amiga`s output. 
If you do a 256 col cycle, at 50 hz (PAL) it`ll take just over 5 secs to do 
it..assuming you vwait to sync the display.

Try skipping cycles instead,or using a higher offset instead of 1.

I knocked up a small test tonight(attached), goes pretty fast on my 040 with 
debugger off.

I did try the built in cycle commands, but Blitz kept throwing up "value out 
of range" errors at compile time ,even when trying to only cycle 32 cols!

hmmm, ran your prog - blitz says can't find include - 'bb2objtypes.bb',    I'm using
'AmiBlitz2 v.2.21', what ver do you have?
do I find include on Aminet? I did a search.

Here! Finally found it.
Use it in a loop like this:

Repeat
           VWait
           CycleColours{Addr Palette n}
           Use Palette 0   ;needed because only the blitz2 palette object
will be modified.
          Forever

I don't know the author, maybe i've found it in an old blitz-list log?

I've also added a small program that loads an IFF ILBM then cycles it. Use
with care as it doesn't checks for non-aga machines, but in an aga one it
works ok.

That was using Blitz 2.1, the bb2objtypes.bb was in the Blitzlibs dir.
If you can`t find it I can mail it to you, although I dunno if it`s 
compatible with the V1.7 structures, (although it should be fine with 
AmiBlitz 2.x)

Oops, I think I forgot to send one.

As for the news in the list header:
  1) I can't control that
  2) It would not work with the current webforwarding ATM. I will fix that

Remove that include, and go to the Compiler Options item (in the Compiler

Hello all!

I want to do the following:

Visual monitoring (VU meter) of Input AND output signal of the
AHI audiostream.

Monitoring the output can be done by setting up a realtime effect
for the output signal that  examines the outputstream and writes
the peakvalue into a certain memory location.

But how can this be done for the input signal ? There
is no possibility to set up a realtime effect to this signal (or
am I wrong ?)

Maybe there is a complete different solution for this. Doesn anybody know ?

Big thanks for hints !

Ciao,

In the news of the site, It's 14, but in the download page, It's 4, but
appared yesterday. Little hard to understand what happened about this
subject.


I would like to install a full clean and so on amiblitz version. I wait
after the release of a next full and big version for having the official and
final deflibs. I'm right ???


I'm a newbie of blitz and want to learn but little afraid about problem of
libs numbers when receive code to other persons for example. Maybe after
saving source code only in ascii for compatibility or allways official
deflibs and new stuff for coding only in userlibs. how for this finally ???


Thanks a lot for amiblitz, allready very great I'm sure (I want to install
to see that) and become very best if no problems for libs numbers (maybe
allready done). I regret to not know blitz language allready to beta test
amiblitz like I often do for lots of normal amiga programs all the year.

Because the site was updated on the 14th Jan but I never uploaded it. The date
of AB2.23 is 4th Jan. Does it even matter? It's the most up to date
version.

Yes, a new version of the full distribution will be released on Saturday
(it will still be AB2.23 though).

There isn't that many problems with libnums. People sending code in Blitz2
format instead of ASCII should be slapped with a fish ;)

Though I am not exactly "active" in using Blitz, I feel that if I don't get

Welcome to the list. Looking at the manual, it doesn't mention 32 colour
limit for cycling. How have you done the cycling, it seems there are two
ways:

CyclePalette Palette#

or

Cycle Palette#

There's also the command SetCycle which allows you to set the colour range
and speed of the cycle.

I seem to remember having to modify the screens palette to get AGA colour 
cycling (although that was 5 or 6 yrs ago!..my memory is a bit fuzzy on that 
one) by doing a for - next loop and using the agapalrgb command in the 
middle.

Are you sure you are using AGA palette? You can only use 256 colours on AGA
machines, so setup colours using the AGAPalRGB command.
Will be useful to take a look at your code to be more precise.

Yes you can, this is a BUG in the debugging routine of SetCycle.  To
get around it, do this:

RunErrsOff
  SetCycle whatever,whatever,whatever,whatever
RunErrsOn

The bug has no effect when the debugger is switched off.  (The command
works fine)

Hi all,
two things - want to expand my color cycling query.

I have the ancient Blitz ver 1.70 - bought and
registered, and no one contacted me to tell me where/how
to update since then!! 

Screen 0,0,0,640,491,8,$8004,"",1,2
Window 0,0,0,640,491,$1433,"",1,2,0

subroutine.. SetCycle 0,0,4,31,speed
             Cycle 0
             return    ........this works
 
??why not......SetCycle 0,0,4,255,speed ???

(do I need a library which supports this?)
 
as it is a fractal proggy, and cycling just 32 colors
looks a bit lame!

see my prog 'Fraktool' in Aminet under gfx/fractal
which I did years ago, now I'm reworking it!!


Second thingy, I downloaded t'other day, AmiBlitz2
ver. 2.21 (Super Ted 2.21 also) from......
http://blitz2000.gazchap.com/introduction/getit.html

is this worth using?  any advice welcome and appreciated.

(would like to do an arkanoid game in Blitz, aka 'BabeAnoid' - see the demo on Aminet)

Yeah, why not? That should work. If you can use the SetCycle commnd, you
should be able to specify 255 as the high colour. However, you might need
an update from v1.70.

Yes. Very much so, although you are far better off getting the full
distribution, as that will contain all the updated libraries. You could wait a few
hours and I should have a more up to date distribution.

If you do fractal programming you can use AB2 2.33 from Davids page and
speed up your prog by Factor 5-10
Add command  optimize 3 in your program

Hi all,
two things - want to expand my color cycling query.

I have the ancient Blitz ver 1.70 - bought and
registered, and no one contacted me to tell me where/how
to update since then!!

Screen 0,0,0,640,491,8,$8004,"",1,2
Window 0,0,0,640,491,$1433,"",1,2,0

subroutine.. SetCycle 0,0,4,31,speed
             Cycle 0
             return    ........this works

??why not......SetCycle 0,0,4,255,speed ???

(do I need a library which supports this?)

as it is a fractal proggy, and cycling just 32 colors
looks a bit lame!

see my prog 'Fraktool' in Aminet under gfx/fractal
which I did years ago, now I'm reworking it!!


Second thingy, I downloaded t'other day, AmiBlitz2

The rkrm doesn`t say this clearly but I wonder if you have to do the whole
process of createmsgport, opendevice, commands, closedevice, deletemsgport for
EVERY device access. Or is it ok to just createmsgport and open the device at
some point and leave it open until exit or some time later and doing a whole
bunch of writes and reads and such.

I feel like I`m talking to myself here, but maybe my problems are too complex
;-)

Hello amorel

No stuff is too complex for me!!!  ;-)
Try my sourcecode.
Sorry that I had not the time to document it.

Example would be:
_______________________________________________ BEGIN
if midiport_open {mp.w,"serial.device",unit.w}
  succ.w = midiport_write {mp.w,data_ptr.l, bytelength.l}
  midiport_close {mp.w}
End If
End
_______________________________________________ END

You can open as many midiports (=serial.device with 31250 baud)
as you have defined with #max_midiports.
It does not matter if you open the same device with
the same unit twice with several mp.w numbers,
it will be recognized correctly and handled correctly
if you close them.
Sorry that there is no midiport_read {} command, but it should
be easy to implement.
Advantage to the blitzcommands is that the data is send asynchron,
that means midiport_write {} returns immideately and you can go on
while your data is being sent.
It also works with different devices, e.g. 
I tested it with 8n1.device, silversurfer.device and powercom.device.

Hope this helps.
BTW. if you want to do MIDI input/output you should take
a look at the CAMD library instead of devices. If you want you can get the
source from my camd.inlcude, which makes it very easy to use MIDI
in blitz programs.

But how to find out the seconds/micros in Blitz2 ?
Of course it is included in the intuimessage, but
you can not get the intuimessage because
Blitz2 uses its own queue for IDCMP messages,
so reading it out from the Windowstructure
does not represent always the current IDCMPmessage.

Is there another way or a solution for this ?

This does not work unless you can guarrantee that you
can check the events in realtime (and my programm does not). 
If you have longer
timeframes where you can not check the events some
clicks can be interpreted as doubleclick but they are not.
So I really need to knwo when the event occured, not
when I come to check the eventqueue.
I think only way is to read out the IDCMP message,
but there is no Blitz Command for this.
(Hello Bernie :o)

Following functions would be useful:

secs.l = EventSecs
mics.l = EventMics
qualifierflags.w = EventQualifier

Must be very similar to 

EMouseX
EMouseY
EventCode usw.
becaue its the same thing but only with other offsets
the read out from the Intuimessagestructure.

There is os commands for that or just generic var=var2 etc. The idcmp message
is a pointer to a idcmp structure which contains amongst other things a
timestamp. Find a way to get that pointer, it`s easy using the os though: 
*idcmpmsg=GT_GetImsg(*window\UserPort)

The Event or WaitEvent command seems to reply the IDCMPmessage already,
so you are not alowed to read the values outof the structure since it is
no longer valid after replying.

You have it correct. However, you can manually peek at the values before
you use Event or WaitEvent (well, Event makes more sense).

Something like this might work IIRC:

*win.Window=Peek.l(Addr Window(0))
Wait_(1 LSL *win\UserPort\mp_SigBit) ; If you want to do a "WaitEvent"
*imsg.IntuiMessage = *win\UserPort\mp_MsgList\lh_Head
; Thats the first message in the queue, which will be the next
; one processed

If *imsg\ExecMessage\mn_Node\ln_Succ<>0
   ; Need to check if there is actually a message there
   sec.l=*imsg\Seconds
   mic.l=*imsg\Micros
EndIf

ev.l=Event
If ev
  ; Normal processing here
EndIf

Of course, this becomes more complicated if you have more than 1 window
open since all messages will be in the same queue and you will need to
make sure you are checking clicks for the correct window.
(*imsg\IDCMPWindow has a pointer to the window which the event came from).

I'd say it would be a lot less hassle to not do this kinda crap though ;)

Adding this is easy only problem is:
Because we have no source of the new patched version (RWE)of this (wtitle
Syntax new is wtitle window[,screen])

But maybee have someone a newer source.
Search for wtitle in it and look if it has the screen parameter as
option.The old version need both parameter

If there are other functions changed i dont know but i think this is a good
check to find newer versions

BTW:The wizardlib use a command wzdoubleclick.I look soon how i make this (I

If no newer windowslibsource  found:
In the gadtoolslib (prehandler)you have access  to the complete intui

When a mousebutton release, the time can store and compare with the lasttime
value
A command doubleclick can then return 1 or 0
But best is to enhance the eventstruct to allow all intuition stuff in the

Yes, but it doesnt work.
It give neighter the qualifierflags nor the pointer to
the qualifierflags. So I dont knwo what to do
with the wired data "Qualifier" command gives me.
Currently I am reading out the qualifier from
the ntuimessagestructure which could also be
already the next intuimessage, but I guess that
you press qualifiers like the Shiftkey quite slowly
so it works in practise. But withdiubleclick it is more
time critical, so it doe not work here for me.

I think a better idea would be to have the two commands Thilo wanted -
EventSeconds and EventMicros - that way the user can do what they like
with the values and it would not be limited to mouse clicks.

It does work, but maybe it only works for certain keypresses. I think it only
works for IDCMP_RAWKEY events, but I could be wrong. I know it works at
least some of the time because I use it in a text editor I have.

EventQualifier is different from Qualifier.

Try this:

; ------8<---------8<---------

WbToScreen 0
Window 0,0,0,400,300,$100f,"jkl",-1,-1
While ev.l<>#IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW
  ev=WaitEvent
  NPrint Hex$(EventQualifier)
Wend

And have a look at the OS includes for devices/inputevent.h

Hi Blitz Basic Users.
I have compiled the enclosed program; it use the Set Period statement.
Someone has told me on this list that the debugger error message "Illegal
chanel (n°5?) mask" blow up because there is a bug in the reddebugger, and
it was sufficient to create an exe with the debug option disabled to
overcome
the problem.
It was true.
I must thank all you; the enclosed program is my present to all you!
Thanks a lot Bernd for AmiBlitz2.

I guess it's more likely to be a bug in the debug code for that library,
not the debugger. Isn't the XBAudiolib a direct replacement for that one
anyway?

Good to hear you got it fixed.

Actually, it was never supposed to be a replacement, and I was a little
shocked
to see that it has been basically used as one. There was a bug with one of
the
commands in the original audiolib (which was all I knew about at the time)
and
was corrected. That was supposed to be merged in to the audiolib, not forked
off in to a redundant library.

IIRC (and I may be wrong..) there was a problem with samples playing at the
wrong frequency, but I don't recall if it was with SetPeriod or not.

It should became a MIDI sequencer but, seen that I am a poor programmer, I

I didn't test the program, but is that correct? I guess the GetDeviceList
(what lib is that from BTW?) is like LockDosList, so you'd maybe need
something like #LDF_VOLUMES|#LDF_READ ?

Hello David

it's from the RI DOS Library V2.5


32mStatement: GetDeviceList39m
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : success=GetDeviceList(flags)

  This command will attempt to lock the DOS objects list ready for 
traversing.

Note: whilst this is locked, no programs may use the DOS object list.

The FLAGS parameter is a bit pattern showing which information you want
to extract. BIT 0 should always be set. NEVER set bit 1.

Valid flag values :

 DEVICES          = %100
 VOLUMES          = %1000
 ASSIGNS          = %10000

Add combinations together to get more than 1 type of entry.

This command optionally returns a success value (which you should check for).

        NextDevice
        FreeDeviceList

I've written a routine to get devices, assigns and volumes, but I use
LockDosList_ with the above (from David, which is also my name ;) constants.
Or you can use #LDF_DEVICES for devices, but anyway you have to use a bit
more complicated routine to get the data.

              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
See, you need the #LDF_READ constant or'ed in with the value you used in
GetDeviceList.

I doubt that's enough to fix the problem though - but I can't see anything
else wrong with the code.

hmmm, getting a bit away from what I wanted here...

This code has been tested on 5 machines so far and only 1 has failed, what I was hoping for
is for some people to actually run the code and let me know if it works ok...

I suspect it's something to do with that odd machine (he's got a very weird setup), I just want to know if it fails on other machines...

ok, here's the code again

WBStartup
CloseEd
NoCli

Dim vname.s(32)

.get_devices
  i=-1
  If WriteFile (1,"Ram:VolumeMeter.debug")
    FileOutput 1
    If GetDeviceList(%1000)
      Repeat
        i=i+1
        vname(i)=NextDevice
        test$=Left$(LCase$(vname(i)),3)
        If test$="ram" OR test$="env"
          i-1
        Else
          NPrint "Device: "+Str$(i)+" Name: "+vname(i)
        EndIf
      Until vname(i)=""
      FreeDeviceList
    Else
      EZRequest "Error","Cannot read device list :(","Quit":End
    EndIf
    CloseFile 1
    PopOutput
    EZRequest "Debug file created in ram..."
  EndIf
End

It worked here. But you should still add that other bit being set, or your
program remains wrong.

What OS did it fail on?

Oh, and consider the case where RAM: or ENV: are the first devices - your
Until line will be checking vname(-1).

This fail by me immediatly because test$ is ram and i is set to -1
Then vname has a Array out of range because it is 0

Maybee you use a dynamic list with dim 0 and add only entries who are valid.

I assume somewhere before the loop "i" is initialized to "-1" or else 
it should work.

My version of the loop. "i" needs to be initialized to 0.

Repeat
   vname(i)=NextDevice
   test$=Left$(LCase$(vname(i)),3)
   If test$="ram" OR test$="env"
   Else
     NPrint "Device: "+Str$(i)+" Name: "+vname(i)

I think this is not the point. Weird setup or not, a program should work and
foresee all problems that might happen.
A high level command like that, doesn't give the programmer the possibility
to check EVERY problem, and it can of course contain bugs. Using OS directly
for the operation you need is not so hard, and it gets only a few minutes if
you know how to do it.
A good example to obtain device (as well as assigns and volumes) listing, is
in the RKM.

Thanks guys, 

code changed to:

.get_devices
  i=0
  If GetDeviceList(%1000|#LDF_READ)
    Repeat
      vname(i)=NextDevice
      test$=Left$(LCase$(vname(i)),3)
      If test$<>"ram" AND test$<>"env" Then i=i+1
    Until test$=""
    NumDevs=i-1
    FreeDeviceList
  Else
    EZRequest "Error","Cannot read device list :(","Quit":End
  EndIf

Works fine here, will send to Mal (with the problem machine) to test it.

To create a filled box use the command Boxf x1,y1,x2,y2,colour.
You can use this command with new values to zoom +/- the box, but use a Cls
[colour] between every drawing to clear the used bitmap. You should need to
use double-buffered display.
For a filled circle, use the command Circlef x,y,radius[,y radius],colour as
above.
What is a T object?

Polyf numpoints,*coords.w,colour[,colour2]
is a command to draw filled polygons (use Poly for non-filled polys). You
must feed it with a pointer type array (a list of values, all referenced by
one word, like a variable), that contains all the coordinates (x,y) of the
points.

To learn the basics of BlitzBasic (now AmiBlitz, thanking to the great work
of Bernd Roesch, and the support mainly by David McMinn and all the
blitz-list gang), you should read its manual (you should have it, if your
copy is original...). I think there is an AmigaGuide version of the manual
somewhere (on blitz2000 site? I forget the url everytime I need it, so ask
to David McMinn).

Hi, and pleased to have you here!

Hi Berga

(BTW, I must admit that I too thought this was going to be some spam, and
wondered why everyone was replying :)

> What is a T object?

I guess a textured object? I think there is some source on Aminet to show
you how to make a textured cube in Blitz (in the dev/basic drawer).

Like this:

Dim points.w(8) ; Allows 4 points to be defined
points(0) = 20 : points(1) = 20
points(2) = 120 : points(3) = 20
points(4) = 120 : points(5) = 80
points(6) = 20 : points(7) = 80
PolyF 4,&points(0),3

Of course, you will need to have created a bitmap to draw onto.

The colour2 parameter, IIRC allows you to plot the polygon in a different
colour if the points are in anti-clockwise order. You can also set this colour2
parameter to be -1 and the polygon will not be drawn
at all if the points are anti-clockwise.

Aminet has the most amount of "raw" resources at the moment. The Blitz2000
site is at http://www.blitz-2000.co.uk and tries to be more ordered about
the files (but it's still a mess :).

Hehe. I normally just delete anything I think is spam. I get a few every
week, and my 68k is too slow to waste cycles on opening and closing YAM
windows that I do not want to read :)

I would guess very rare for the Amiga, especially Blitz. There are probably many
who write in C++ for Windows though.

Right, I've been pondering and playing with this for a few days to get an answer
for you, and failed.

There is an MUI tag, #MUIA_ControlChar (area class) which is supposed to do just
that, but I'm buggered if I can get it to work, but don't give up hope, there
may still be an answer:-

1) You could code your hotkeys in Blitz and just include a check for them in
your main loop, then call the appropriate function - this should work without a
problem

or

2) I haven't tested this, so I can't guarantee it. For each of your image
buttons, create a corresponding text button with MuiKeyButton which will let
you assign a hotkey to them. Then, hide each Text button using #MUIM_Hide.
Create your notification so that any action on the text button acts on your
image button.

Option 2 would still do it "The MUI way" but - a) I don't know if a hidden
button would still react to hotkeys - so it may not work, and b) It's messy,
doubling up the number of MUI objects that you need to code for.

If I can find a proper way of doing it, I'll let you know.

Option 1 is the easiest for me as my buttons are all dynamically generated,
and having to create more but with different object numbers would be a
pain. (as in option2)

The thing is I don't know where to start to code hotkeys in blitz. I only
need hotkeys that will respond when the window is selected, not any other
time.

Any help would be much appreciated

Firstly, in your event waiting loop, add the blitz command EventWindow that
return the window object number in where the event occurs.
Then check RawKey that returns the RAW keycode of the last pressed button.
RAW means that this value doesn't worry about keyboard mapping,  as this
command (as far as I remember - already exists AFAIR?) works in absolute
way, not relative. Example: if you press the 'z' key on a qwerty keyboard
RawKey returns a different value than in a qzerty one.
If you want to check for qualifiers, simply use Qualifier command.
This is a quick overview of what I do usually for my progs, and it works
fine! Use the downscore '_' char before the letter on a GadTools button, and
you get a nice interface. The only thing which works bad is the RawKey
function, that doesn't support keymapping. You should use os function to do
the thing.
Oh. And if something doesn't work tell me, because I'm not on Amiga ATM so I
can be wrong.

I have done a quick testm but it hasn't worked. This is what I did:
(ignoring the window check bit)

Check=Rawkey

If Check=01 ;(Rawkey code for 1?)
    Other bit of code

I'm thinking I got the rawkey code wrong, but I got it from the back of the
Blitz manual.

Any help apprecieted!

I've turned on my Amy so now I'm looking at the code. Try this:

Repeat
          hap.l=WaitEvent            ;this will wait until an event occurs
(ANY event on every win or screen)
                                            ;I can't remember if hotkeys
works this case. If something fails, try using a
                                            ;VWait and then a hap.l=Event
          win.l=EventWindow      ;this returns the window ID in where the
event occurs
          stat.l=EventCode         ;this returns the event code

          If win=#MyWin AND hap=$400
            Then Select stat
                              Case $45            ;ESC key pressed
                                      Goto quit
                              Case $5F            ;HELP key pressed
                                      NPrint "You pressed the Help key"
                              Case ....
                              End Select
             EndIf

         Forever
.quit
End

Usually I place an ESC key check for every window, so the user can close it
by pressing esc.
If create a gadtools gadget like this: GTButton ...,"Press me to _exit",...
the word exit has the 'e' underlined, so now you need only to check if that
letter has pressed and then go to the same subroutine that you'll go by
pressing it. The blitz manual has all the rawkey codes (in hex, so you have
to add the $ before the number) of the keyboard, but you have to test them
because they may be different from yours.

See ya!

Hi there, Lewis

On 03-Jan-02, you said:

LB> that remap easily. question is how can I give them hotkeys?

OK, sorry it's taken a little time to get back to you on this, but here's your
answer.

Suppose you have the notification on your image button set up as:-

MUINotifyApp Obj,#MUIA_Pressed,0,#ID_BUTTONPRESSED

You would set your hotkey up as follows (the example uses the "b" key):-

MUINotifyApp Window,#MUIA_Window_InputEvent,"b",#ID_BUTTONPRESSED

Note that the event isn't allocated to your button, but to your host window. By
specifying the same return ID you ensure that the hotkey will call the same
routine.

If your notification is set to react on another MUI object, then simply set the
hotkey notification up the same way.

According to the MUI developer docs, this should only be used for the odd
hotkey, and subclasses should be used in general, but using subclasses for
hotkey events doesn't seem to work with EFMUI.library where hotkeys are not
directly supported by the Blitz command :o/

Nevertheless, I've tested my method, and it works.

Regards

I tried your method quickly an unfortunately It didn't work for me. However,
I did manage to get the MUIA_ControlChar to work, sort of.

By using it as specified in the docs, the assigned hotkeys do not work. But
what actually happens is that any hotkeys seemed to be assigned a letter
starting from A.

E.g. First button created with ahotkey gets assigned a shortcut of ctrl a,
the second ctrl b and so on!

If you want to do Animations with objects you do the following:

- create two bitmaps same size
- create one display

loop:
- clear bitmap x
- draw your T-Object on bitmap x
- change coordinates of the T-Object to the new values
- wait for the vblank with vwait
- show bitmap x
- do x=1-x or something that "x" is now the other bitmap
goto loop


What commands exactly to use depends on what display you choose,
a os-friendly screen (which is more difficult) or a hardware hack display
using the
slice command (don't forget to go into "Blitzmode" then).

What system config do you have ?

Don't use Slice! Use the display library commands if you need a hardware

Subject: @{b}Newcomer Questions@{ub}

Hi,

  This is my first message to the list as I have not used Blitz for many
years and have blown the dust off the disks and decided to start again.
Unfortunately I have hit a few stumbling blocks and a friend directed me to
the blitzlist which I hope can help solve some of the problems I am having.

Here goes!

Q1 :

SCREENS - Using the SCREENTAGS command Blitz will open a copy of Workbench
on CGFX provided the  `#LikeWorkbench' tag is set. It also allows me to
change the dimensions and properties of the New Screen but any attempt to
change the resolution with the `#DisplayID' mode tag fails.

I have tried getting the information on the Display mode from the worbench
screen and New Screen at different resolutions and setting the `#DisplayID'
tag to those values. Unfortunately when that tag is set the entire
SCREENTAGS command fails to open the screen but does not generate any
errors either.

Just changing the `Width' and `Height' values leaves thick black borders
around the edges.

So is there any way to generate a custom CGFX screen using SCREENTAGS or
could someone please explain how to get a valid ScreenMode ID ?????????


Q2:

WINDOWS - Could anyone tell me where can I get info on the WINDOWTAGS
taglist supported by Blitz ? There is nothing in the manual and the Online
Help has no info either.


Q3:

Label reference out of context - This error is generated whenever i try to
use the RESTORE command from within a statement or Function despite the
fact that the manual states that this type of error should not happen. Is
there a way around this problem or am I simply going to have to place the
command outside of any procedures????


Q4:

PROCEDURES - Another little problem that grates on my sanity is that
procedures cannot call other procedures if they are positioned lower in the
program listing than the function calling it. 

Is there a way of making Blitz search the entire listing for the procedures
or will I simply have to reorganize the program and possibly have to use
duplicate procedures with different names?



I hope that someone can help with these little problems as the documentation
in the manual can be a little ropey in some areas. Any assistance will be
greatly appreciated and hopefully save what little is left of my sanity
after the last few days.

Cheers,

Oz.

You can put the data inside the function too.

Either use Bernd's screen_ macro or use an ASL requester - there's a demo
of exactly how to do this on Aminet.

I find it difficult to believe that you cannot re-organise your code so
that all the required procedures are above the places they are used from.
Generally, if you can't do that it means you have some nasty recursion
(loops of procedure calls) going on.

From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 01-16-02 20:12:52
Subject: @{b}Optimize 3 problem@{ub}

Hi there,

I still ahve a problem using optimize with any value other than 1. Before, I
just crashed (with or without the debugger), now the error is trapped, but I'm
still stumped.

My routine is:-

.ldconfig

If Exists(cfle$)
  of=ReadFile(1,cfle$)
  If of
    FileInput 1
    status$=Edit$(3)
    defsrch$=Edit$(64)
    defpath$=Edit$(256)
    otherfilter$=Edit$(256)
    CloseFile 1
    If defsrch$="0" Then defsrch$=""
    If otherfilter$="0" Then otherfilter$=""

    MUISetCM 130,Val(Left$(status$,1))
    MUISetCM 132,Val(Mid$(status$,2,1))
    MUISetCM 134,Val(Right$(status$,1))
    MUISetString 139,otherfilter$
    MUISetString 141,defpath$
    defconfig=True
    If LCase$(cfle$)<>"env:ghelp.config"
      cfgpath$=StripPath{cfle$}
      cfgfile$=StripFile{cfle$}
      defconfig=False
    EndIf
  EndIf
EndIf

Return

The line defsrch$=Edit$(64) produces an "Unable to free memory" error. If I set
Optimize 1 or skip the line, the rest of the code runs.

Any ideas?

All the best

Subject: @{b}Re: Optimize 3 problem@{ub}

I add it in bugs2.2 file but this work ok (optimize 3/7 testet debug on/off)
I think that a command previous write on the adress where the string of
defsrch$
stand,a value.When a stringsize is too small it want free the old string.But
if this is a wrong value this give a mem
error.

So to track the problem add a defsrch$=x$ where x$ is a string with > 64
lines.in your code on some places
You can find the line who write to wrong var space.
If this command work the wrong code comes later.If the command fail the code
is before

Another way:
Maybee you can switch the optimizer of fpu on later and look when it fail.
The calc results are wrong but maybee this help too

Try also running enforcer/mungwall maybee this shows something

Everyone should ensure their files are clash free themselves, thus

The patchlibs dir way is not good but it is a easy way so that user can
check the merged acidlibs replacements
and see if they make problems.Because there are many unoffical bugfixes in
the acidlibs out this helps to find
problems in the offical Source in the fastest way.If you notice a problem
from a lib out of patchlib you can use the deflibman do a select all and
remove step by step all patchlib and mail me then the exact problem.

Later if all are happy with the acidlibs no file should stay in
patchlibs.This is then used for users that want to add
features to the acidlibs.And users who like it can install in patchlibs and
test it.If they notice problems they can
easy remove the lib and check without it.The developer of a patchfile should
add large default object numbers for testing because you can not increase
maximum objects in compilerprefs

Thats the sense wy i have add the patchlibs dir.


A libclush requester i think is part of the librarymanager to show when a
user want to create a deflibs
that is wrong build.This is better i think as when a user start blitz and
then come the libclushrequester.
then he must build his deflibs and start blitz again etc.

Is there any work done on a librarymanager  ?

Subject: @{b}Serial example@{ub}

This is a simple piece of code to show how to write to the serial port in
Blitz the "proper" way ;-) (using os-functions) Although DoIO_ isn`t the
prefered method, as it will not return until the write is completed. Best is
to use SendIO_, CheckIO_, WaitIO_ etc. But it`s not too much different from
this and the rkrm supplies you with enough info. Maybe I`ll convert the
complex example one day.

This example supposedly does work here. Ofcourse I should check the serial
output to know for sure. I have also attached the original c source.

My problem regarding sharing of the serial port remains :-( A solution I did
using os-functions only works half for now.

I can't remember if NewIcons are 24-bit (might be just 256 colours), but the
attached shows how to load icons (including NewIcons if running) into shape
gadgets... note that you need to put some stuff in the Compiler Options for
it to work...

You'd struggle to make 24bit ShapeGadgets (or GTShapes) because they both
use an OS Image structure to represent the graphics for the gadget. AFAIK
Image structures can only deal with 8bit graphics.

Personally I don't think using icons for GUI elements is very good. If the
user has no newicons installed, you get some butt ugly GUI. If the user
has OS3.5+ and has them turned off, you also get an ugly GUI.

Thilo - how does guigfx remap graphics? Can you specify a target bitmap
and it gets remapped to that? The recent discussion was about using
datatypes to remap the images, but they get remapped to the screen depth,
and if that is >8bit you cannot use the remapped images as gadgets.

Thanks for that, I will check this out.

Yes, I know. That because I wanted to remap them.

But newicons can contain normal icondata as well,or am I wrong !?
So I can do a 4 color version of the gadget for users
who have turned newicons off (they must be used to ugly GFX anyway)

GUIGFX is a nice thing. It loads all kind of pictures via datatypes
for you and blits them on every screen you want with any depth.
(on the fly remapping & zooming). If you need speed
you can call an "optimize" function that prepares the
picture for fastest possible blitting for a certain screen,
e.g. remaps it for colorindexed screens or converts it
into 16bit for a 16bit screen.
But you can also force it to be remapped to a custom
pixelformat (I hope so, I will have to check it again)
 and you can turn it into an OS bitmap.
(that means receive a pointer to it, I guess the pictures are handled
internal 
like this anyway).
So it should be no problem to create a - lets say 32color - OS bitmap
out of any kind of picture. But how do I use a bitmap in a shapegadget ?
Dirty way would be like this:
Take a shapeobject, fill out the structure manually with the pointers
stolen from the OS bitmap and clear it manually on exit. But maybe there 
is a more friendly way to do this.

I will check if you can remap to any desired format, even if there
is no screen open for this. Stay tuned...


Ciao,
Thilo

I have newicons turned off on my 16bit screens because I couldn't
be bothered removing them and they were randomly scattered across my HDD -
it broke the look of my WB.

A better way to do it would be something like:

; Create shape with desired width, height and depth
InitShape shp_num,shp_width,shp_height,shp_depth

; Use shape data as a bitmap
ShapesBitMap shp_num,bmp_num

BltBitMap_ *guigfx_bm,0,0,Addr
BitMap(bmp_num),0,0,shp_width,shp_height,$C0,-1,0

But both your GuiGFX bitmap and shape should be the same size.

Bye

I tried it but all I get are the (mostly)4 color old icons.
I tried it with newicons, glowicons and normal(old) icons.
Some MWBIcons give 8 colours, so it is not a problem of the
GTShape, I also checked the Depth variable of the Image.
Any idea whats wrong ?

Hate to ask, but -- are you running NewIcons? :)

Hello all!

OK, I checked it out.

With guigfx.library you can render a 24bit picture to an 8 bit chunky
picture, but this doesn't help because the 8bit
representation is not associated with
the screen palette. But you can draw a 24 bit picture
to every rastport. So if it is possible to set up a rastport
to the shapes bitmap is must be possible to get the picture
rendered to the screencolours into the bitmap of the shape.

So I will check out how to set up a rastport for a bitmap.
I looked into the autodocs and it seems that you
have do do everything manually.

Ciao,

Thilo

It's very easy:

Deftype.RastPort rp
InitRastPort_ &rp
rp\BitMap = Addr BitMap(0) ; or whatever Blitz bitmap

Ha, got it !!!

Turning any kind of picture (jpg, iff, gif) with any
colordepth (2-24bit) into a shape gadget (GTShape)
or a Blitz Shape, colormapped with right colors on
your desired Screen with any depth (2-24 bit).

Think this will be of interesst for many of you,
so I will turn the sourcecode into human readable text
and post it here.

Thanks to David and James for your hints!

@NODE "mail_128" " Sharing serial port "
From: amorel <amorel@...>
Date: 01-29-02 03:19:01
Subject: @{b}Sharing serial port@{ub}

How can I share a serial port between 2(or more) processes? Opening it shared
in both with openserial and required parameters doesnt work and causes a guru
when the second process opens it. Using one openserial will not work as the
other process can`t use it. I tried using the os, but despite following rkrm
examples to the letter functions writing data to serial will never return.

An example of using the os would be welcome too =)

Yes but I spawn the process from within a main process. Therefor I let them
share the same data and whatever else applies. I`m sure this would work using
os functrions, just seems the blitz functions arent as smart or I miss
something obvious.

C=Maybe the device driver you use doesn`t like sharing?

Ahem, it`s the standard os serial.device, the rkrm would at least mention it
if it doesnt like sharing ;-))

I should add that when I try opening the serial port in the process I do get
an indication that it succeeded(I open a requester with returned value of
openserial plsu which unit number) but right after that the debugger complains
"unable to free memory". I am almost positive this happens within the process,
which has the debugger switched off as it would otherwise crash.

If I have a label like .stopplay then the right hand window will show it as

stop will cause a breakpoint entry in the right hand window.
