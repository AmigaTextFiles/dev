Does anyone know what this system can do, and why it will be bundled
with every machine ( I mean what do you think "average user" will do
with it) ? And how could Blitz take advantage of the system... ?

Hi,

Yup,it is possible...you the following before you initialize the GTLISTVIEW
(you need the gadtools include files for this - I have a resident with
all the gadtools stuff in it if you want it)

GTTags #GTLV_ShowSelected,0	

or it may be

GTTags #GTLV_ReadOnly,-1

try both and see which work.. :)

Steve.

dont think so.  You could have some cludge to check whether there as a
mouseclick in the area, then check whether there is an item highlighted and 
reset it back to the old one.  Or maybe just disable the delete gadget again?

I'm pretty certain that you would need to use the Display library in order
to use such AGA specific features: According to my Hardware Reference Manual
the OCS/ECS chipset could only use 3 bitplanes for fore/back grounds, but
from the AGA hardware guide document off Aminet, AGA can use 4 bitplanes 
for each.

I can send out my AGA Dual Playfield (4 fore + 4 back bitplanes) Blitz source 
code if anyone needs it.

	Dear Philipp Lonke,

	I'm very sorry about the delay in responding to your query about why my
blitz setup is accepting 'DetachGTList', 'GTFreeGadget' while yours isn't.

	The library which contains the commands I was using is in fact the
'bbgtlib' which should reside in your 'BlitzLibs:Basic' directory. Although I
don't know the version of the library I was using, I can tell you that it is
available from Steve Mc on the blitz-list or by contacting
'sis3149@sisvax.sis.port.ac.uk'.

	The 'bbgtlib' library update contained the following commands...

		GTButton, GTCheckBox, GTCycle, GTInteger, GTListView, GTMX,
		GTNumber, GTPalette, GTScroller, GTSlider, GTString, GTText,
		AttachGTList,  GTTags, GTGadPtr, GTBevelBox, GTChangeList,
		GTSetAttrs, GTSetString, GTSetInteger, GTGetString,
		GTGetInteger, GTShape, GTGetAttrs, GTEnable, GTDisable,
		GTToggle, GTStatus, GTArrowSize, DetachGTList, GTGimmeCludge,
		GTSetHighlight, GTFreeGadget.

		Should you (Or anybody else for that matter) wish to know more
about my blitz setup (I've got a complete cmmmand list available - directory
structures - lib allocs - etc...) then please feel free to contact me either on
the blitz-list or EMail me directly. I'm not saying that I'll know the answers
to all of your questions, but I'll try my best to help out...

			Good luck with the bbgtlib...

I have been trying to work out how to set the colour palette on a DPfield,

I would be very pleased to see your DP code posted on the list

You wrote HalpApp,  I have vversion 1.1 but I does not seem to work on my
2.04 Amiga A2000, problem is the text that's printed into the windows is
not there.  All the gadgets and menus are visible it's just the text.  I
did expirence a simular problem with an early version of Steve's very cool
debugger,  but I not sure what he changed to fix it.  HelpApp looks very
usefull.

The NPrint command prints a carriage return after all of its parameters 
have been output.  If you don't want this CR, just use the Print command.

Use the "Print" command instead of "NPrint."  (Together with the 
WLocate/Locate commands) you should have no problem printing scores.

Subject: GTList Deallocation


	Fellow blitzers,

	I have a quickish question which has been puzzling me for quite some time now. If anybody can help me out I'll be very grateful.

    The problem is this...
	Using GTList objects I've been performing simple resizing of
interfaces. This involves detaching, remaking and then reattaching the GTLists
to a given window.

	The thing is that I seem to be having memory deallocation
problems. I've used 'MemWatcher' by F.Brandau and it reports that all allocated
memory IS deallocated only upon termination of the program using the
interfaces. Therefore I can only assume (And don't forget I'm only guessing)
that there is a bug in a command somewhere in the code.

        Have a play with the following code and see if you can't get it to work
without deallocation problems (Please)...

    ;
    ; Code starts here...
    ;

    WBStartup : NoCli : CloseEd

    WbToScreen 0
    Window 0,0,0,300,200,$1|$2|$4|$8|$10|$20|$1000,"GTLib memory tester...",2,1

    GTButton 0,0,0,0,InnerWidth,InnerHeight,"Tester button",0
    AttachGTList 0,0

    Repeat
      Select WaitEvent
      Case $2
        DetachGTList 0 : GTFreeGadget 0,0 : Free GTList 0

        InnerCls 0 : RefreshWindowFrame_(Peek.l(Addr Window(0)))

        GTButton 0,0,0,0,InnerWidth,InnerHeight,"Tester",0
        AttachGTList 0,0
      Case $200
        End
      End Select
    Forever

    ;
    ; Code ends here
    ;

      I hope to hear from someone on this rather frustrating matter soon...

              Thanks all,

                     Ricky J. Clarke

I suspect that Ralph was looking to be able to print ANYWHERE on the screen.
I have seen some source in C that implements a window. It might also
help someone who asked the question : how do I open a console if
Blitz Basic doesn't provide me with one?

If anyone is still interested, I'll see if I can convert the C code
to Blitz Basic, so that it could perform the required function.

Hi there,

 What am I doing wrong? I just try to read a ASCII-File into strings
and then to display them in a window. But the ascii-File is never read
in properly :(

The textfile contains special characters because it uses the IBM
graphics font. Is that the cause or my code?


if exists("text:ascpic")
  if readfile(0,"text:ascpic")
    fileinput 0
    while not eof(0)
      t$=inkey$

      if (t$=chr$(10)) or (t$=chr$(13))

        a$(count)+t$
      endif

    wend
  endif
  closefile 0
  defaultinput

First of all, the "if exists()" followed by the "if readfile()" is 
redundant.  Readfile will return FALSE if it couldn't open the file for 
any reason, including it not existing.

Now then, since Edit$() will terminate on CHR$(10) CHR$(13) or CHR$(0) 
when reading from a file, it would be a lot faster to use it in your routine:

Dim a$(32767)	;Max amt. of items for a BB2 array...
count=0

If ReadFile(0,"text:ascpic")
	FileInput 0
	While Not Eof(0)
		a$(count)=Edit$(1024)
		count+1
	Wend
	CloseFile 0
	DefaultInput
Else
	Nprint "Error #",IOErr_
EndIf

I have been for a while saveing useful pointers from the blitz list, 
I am thinking of editing these and includeing them with the Blitz.guide

What is your thoughts on this,  I would like to know before I put too

               But after you mentioned the gadtools include file, i looked
               through the BUM disks and found (on BUM 7) a lot more tags
               than i new existed.  Arrrrhhh, i had the answer all along!

Now, I also want to make a Listviewgadget which is Read-only. So I set
up my GTList :

        GTButton   ...
        GTButton   ...
        GTTags     #LV_Readonly,True
        GTListview ...

But as soon as the user clicks on the Listview, the blue bar appears -
that's what I wanted to avoid! What am I doing wrong?

Second, when I open a screen with ScreenTags and set #SA_ShowTitle to
True, the Titlebar still appears. Why that?

Subject: Selling Blitz games


  Hi All,

        Has anyone got any ideas about where to sell a finished Blitz
  game?  It seems to me that if you've written something which isn't
  good enough to be a commercial sell-in-the-shops-for-twenty-quid sort
  of game, the only other choice is shareware (where your chances of making 
  anything are about zero).  

  Do magazines still accept games for their cover disks (and pay for them)?
  I know they used to, but nowadays they seem to only use demos of commercial 
  games.  I'm not looking to get filthy rich, I just want a few quid for all
  my trouble (in the good old days of 32K computers, you could get games
  printed in magazines and earn about 100 quid pretty easily).

 
  Any ideas?

 
  -"Moneygrabber" Matt.

A bit of background first.  When programming Blitz libraries, Blitz 
itself provides access to memory allocation routines to you - the memory 
you allocate with these routines is automatically freed up at the end of 
the program.  Thus what is most probably happening is that a command in 
one of the libs you use if allocating memory and then not freeing it up - 
leaving it to Blitz's clean up routine to sort out.

One command that is guilty of this is the WTitle command in the 
Windowslib.  This command never freed up the old window and screen titles 
after you changed them - I have fixed this command now but there maybe 
other commands that mess up in exactly the same way.

You're using Gadtools so it maybe a problem with that.  As far as I know 
the latest version that I distributed is perfectly okay - but I did not 
have time to test it exhaustively.  Thus there may still be lingering 
problems with regards to freeing up gadgets and lists.  I'll try and find 
time to have a look at these.

You also use the Screen and Window libs - these too might have problems 
as well.  Remember that you'll be getting quite a lot of intuition 
messages to your window - so before you try using any memory program make 
sure that your program itself has processed all IDCMP messages that come 
to its port.

Can you tell me how much memory you loose each time you run?  It'd help 
if there was a fixed amount (e.g. previously GTShape gadgets always 
caused the lose of 20bytes everytime you freed one of them).


Anyway, if any of this proves to me useful, or you want any more 
info/help then just mail back.

Yes I use south east, I think I shall knock up a help prefs program to

Yes delay 30 is oK but I prefer 25 8) As I said sounds good for the

It would not be that hard to try and move it around, I shall give
it a go and see how it goes.

Right I think the problem here is a lack of font sensitivity. I will be
sorting this in the final version. Thanks for pointing it out.

This is very strange, I will have a look to see what is going on.

Go for it. I think most people on the list have a copy so let's

be the last, so anything you want to see, let me know, or try and
convince me to carry on with it.

I'm not sure what you want to do. Do you want to be able to write to 
a console window (i.e. what you get with a CLI) - or a window
created by Blitz. Are you writing a game? - in which case, you would
open a window and use something like the WLocate command. I don't
think there is a command that will allow you to print literally
anywhere on the screen - you have to set things up first.

Maybe if you could tell me a bit more about what you are trying to do, I 
could help

There are a few people out there using the demo or even pirated 
versions of Blitz, but IMHO without the manuals and BUMs, even a pointer 
here and there isn't going to be of much use to them.  So what if they 
figure out an obscure feature of Blitz, they still aren't familiar with 
90% of the rest of it.  (Not enough to write anything useful anyway.)  
Either they'll buy the full Blitz package and get the manuals etc. or 
they won't, but it took me a long time to master Blitz even WITH the 
manuals.  I would be very impressed with the individual who can do that 
just by pure guesswork and browsing example sourcecode.

In short, I think you've got a good idea, and I reccomend you put it in 
the guide file if you think it would be helpful.  The pirates out there 
won't be able to make much use of it.

dont discount shareware.  as long as your product is useful/fun enough, and 
there is an incentive to register (ie extra levels - definitely _NOT_ disabling
a feature such as saved hi-scores) then you`ll get something back from it.

My Virtual Worlds has had a number of reistrations, and at 15 squids a time,
it soon adds up.

I know that as soon as my ami is sorted Im going to register Roketz, just
like i registerred Gravity Force, and a coupla other things.

They dont advertise the fact any more, but if its good enough then they may
consider it - either they pay you lots for the full game or maybe just stick
a demo on.  If you get a demo on a coverdisk then you`ll (apparently) get loads
of registyrations - That Charlie Chimp game on Amiga Power had _lots_ of regos
apparently - and that was pretty crap really!

Yup this is a BIG problem. I think also you would be suprised how little 
even the 20 quid games make for their developers.

Acid (us) have stuffed a lot of people around cos we wanted to publish 
their games (bbombers, cascade, tennis etc.) but the market is just not 
there at present. If escom does roll out Amiga's at least 3 months before 
christmas I still want to follow up the partypack idea where we publish 3 
games at a time for the same price as 1 full price game. The magazines 
are right behind us on this one but even some of them look as though they 
are not going to be around for too much longer without some strong market 
leadership by escom....

 Not really sure, but....
 
 If you think you have a good game, what does it hurt to send a DEMO version
 to numerous magazines for potential review.  You could also mention you are
 looking for someone to distribute (if that is what you want to do) your game.
 If it makes it in a magazine and gets a good review, potential distributors
 may come knocking at your door.  And if you have the resourses to ditribute
 yourself, and you passed this information on to the magazines, hopefully 
 people will send directly to you.
 
 If you have addresses for known game developing houses, you could also
 send demos directly to them.  What could it hurt?
 
 Hope this helps.
 
 Sincerely
 
 Tom Stone (the guy who wrote Fantasy Quest for the Mac and then made it
            shareware to only get about 10 people actualy send in a shareware
            fee.  I will never go shareware again!)

  On 2 June Ralph Barbagallo asked about printing to a screen with no window.
The OS likes to have at least a backdrop window.  I get the impression
from the RKM that there is no point opening a screen without one, but that
the overhead is small in any case.
  On 5 June Matthew O'Donnell asked about money from games.
My advice is, if circulating shareware, make sure it is well crippled or
cut down.  My game Spelltris (full version released) spread to a lot of
libraries, so somebody must like it.. but I've had zero registrations.
  Maybe in a few years there will be a system where people download stuff
and pay maybe ten pence to the author, but that is some time away.

Subject: Blitz II Multitasking :-(

Hi all,

I appologise if this is a FAQ, but I've only just started reading
this list.

I have noticed that when I try to run more than one instance of a
compiled Blitz Basic programme or if I try to run more than one
compiled Blitz Basic executable, either my own code or the supplied 
demo GUI proggys, simultaneously then one of them will crash the Amiga 
with the dreaded Guru/Software Failure.  I have checked my code 
carefully and can see no reason for the crashes.  I have tested this 
with code which merely opens a window on the workbench screen and 
wait for it to be closed by the user.  When two instances of this 
executable are run, closing one of them will crash the computer.  If 
I run the executable only once, then closing the window will do as 
expected, ie terminate the programme and free the resources.

I am running Blitz Basic II, version 1.90 on an Amiga 1200 and on an
Amiga 4000-030 both with the same results.

I am currently developing some specialist Database Management software
(for a book library) and it requires that I be able to write the 
software in module form each module must be able two co exist with 
one or more instances of itself on the one machine.  The crashing software
doesn't help in this respect :-)

Has anyone else come across this problem?

Any pointers as to the probable cause of my problem would be
appreciated.

I'd say this is a problem with one of the libraries in Blitz not sharing 
some resource properly or using an absolute address in memory by mistake.

Q. Are you using any third party libraries or straight acid ones only?

Q. Do you have access to snoopdos and maybe enforcer to help give a better
   error report

Q. DO you have runtime errors enabled, I think If you do blitz programs 
will not multitask as they will clober the traps in an unsharing way.

p.s. that last one re runtime errors I think is the one?

Subject: *Ware


I was interested to hear the discussion on shareware in the Blitz
list. It makes a change from all the technical questions that are
asked on the list - not that I am complaining - I have asked many
such questions myself.

What I would be interested to hear from is of anyone's experience
of releasing Freeware. I have put a few bits and pieces in both
PD libraries and on the Aminet. I have never heard any response
from anyone. It makes me wonder whether anyone looks at my stuff,
hates it, or is just plain indifferent. It seems to me that the
only people making money out of programs are the PD companies.
Some of them charge upwards of 3 quid. Considering a floppy
costs 50p to buy - any slightly less if you buy them in bulk - it
seems difficult to believe that they are being sold on a 
not-for-profit basis. I wonder how much money the owners of
the libraries take out as salary.

Perhaps a good way of releasing software is to adopt the
philosophy of GNU - provide all the code, and make it free. That
way, at least you have the chance that someone could improve
your code and add new features - so as an author who uses
the product that you create - you get someone else who increases
the usefulness of the product to you. Admittedly, this is more
directed to utility programs rather than games; and it
probably means that the code would be better if written in C
rather than a Basic (to increase the base of people who can
code in it).

And on the subject of comparing C with Blitz Basic - I recently
looked at the C code for the program emacs. A line count revealed
that over 9000 lines of code were present. That's one hell of
a line count! I couldn't help thinking that if it was written in
Basic, the line count would be a lot lower. What I would like
to see in Blitz Basic, though, would be the following :
   o better structuring - being able to pass functions and 
arrays as parameter arguments
   o better control for larger projects. The INCLUDE statement
in BB2 is good - but if an INCLUDEd module contains an error,
you're in trouble, beacause BB2 doesn't tell you what and where it's wrong.



Anyway, that's enough chat from me.
I look forward to your responses.

Mark Carter.

  Hi All,

        Sorry if this has been covered before - I'm writing a game which
   loads in a shapes file of about 150K length.  I was wondering if there's
   any way I can compress the shape file somehow, load it into Blitz and then
   uncompress it in memory (I'm trying to save some space on the disk).

   Is there an easy way to do this?

Subject: Shareware - reply to Mark Tiffany

>> Shareware without an incentive to register is pointless (or something)

  Yes I agree, and that is why I offered other software for those who
registered my game, but I still had no luck.  Okay, maybe it just wasn't good
enough.

  I think we could get hung up on semantics talking about different definitions

of "crippled".  My understanding of the word would include an adventure creator

that couldn't produce distributable games.

  Basically, what I was trying to say was that if there is to be any chance of
getting money from shareware, the incentive better be fairly massive.  I don't
think a few Arexx utilities will do it.  For games, I'd say a short demo rather

than a long one.  And when it comes to utilities, I'd suggest that using them
should be quite limited if you haven't registered.

  And of course, they have to be pretty good!

  Anyway, thats how I see it.  For now I will stick with the day job...

	There is the alternative approach of `Licenseware' which is
run in the UK by F1 Software, a PD house in Exeter. They usually
advertise in Amiga Format and the like. The software costs slightly
more than the usual PD disk, but a good share (25 %) I think goes
straight to the author on every disk sold. The title is licensed to F1
so it can't be sold by other PD houses, which may be a drawback if you
want very wide distribution of your title. Has anyone used this method
of selling software and does it work ?

Our new shapeslib can pack shapes using a simple byterun algorithm, it 
can also grab these shapes from memory.  If you used this alongside a 
more comprehensive packer,like Stone Cracker or Crunchmania, you can get 
your shape files down to a very small size.

There are userlibs available for blitz forboth stonecracker and 
crunchmania so you shouldn't have any problems using them.

Couple of things which came to my mind about shareware:

- Yes, programs must be good if one wants to get more than 
 a few to register them. Close to commercial quality.

- In future, when there will be opportunity for everyone to
 charge for downloads from one's www-page etc. , many will
 quite surely do just that with their programs. Good about
 this is, that it's so easy, that more people will surely
 pay something for software that way. Not so good thing
 will ofcourse be, that many programs which would
 previously be released as PD in aminet will maybe take this
 path. I'm kind of waiting for this though...

The LESHapesLib is in the libraries directory of the ShapeZII archive,
along with the new RIPAck library which is required for LEShapes to

Use the LEShapes library which allows shapes to be saved and loaded
in compressed formats. It is in the SHapeZII archive which is 
on the blitz ftp site.

I don't think many programmers are looking to make a fortune out
of their efforts. I know it is not the case for me. Some kind
of feedback from people would be nice, though. Whether the www
is a good idea or not depends on the price people charge for their
software. I think people would be very wary about buying an
unknown program for 5 pounds. Maybe charge them a nominal fee in
return for a highly crippled program. Then if they like the
software, they can ask the author for the full version at the
5 pounds level. Of course, you would be justified in saying that
this represents little change from the current setup. However,
there is one important difference - contact has to be made with 
the author. With PD libraries and Aminet, the author is remote, and
somehow out of the equation. I would say that there would be a much
greater level of registration if potential users dealt with the
author directly. On the other hand, I could be completely wrong,
and it would just be business as usual. But sometimes subtle
shifts in emphasis can bring about large changes in results.

What I think would be great is a much better degree of co-operation 
between authors. You can see, for instance, that on the Aminet there
are many text editors, all doing pretty much the same thing. But
each one has it's own foibles and strengths, and it would be nice
to see one good text editor that satisfied everyone, than lots
of text editors that had niggling deficiencies. Again, I say, I
am becoming more enamoured of the idea of free software that
everyone tries to improve. It is a good way of starting off from
a fairly rough product, and refining it into a killer program.

Mikko mentioned that shareware would receive lots of registrations
if it was close to commercial quality. The problem here is that
software of very high quality is very difficult to write. If I
had written something that was THAT good, I would probably try
to sell it commercially - rather than rely on the vagaries of

Hi i was wondering if any one out there has an algorithm for a plasma effect.
and also does any one know if any amiga ftp sites have the game Last-lap

In theory it _is_ possible to print directly to the screen's bitmap (i.e.
without a window).

Just use a BitmapOutput command first.

However, I don't recommend this.

Instead, use a window that is backdroped and without borders or system
gadgets.

Subject: RE: Amiga Crashes w/ 2 BB2 progs


Before you try running enforcer etc. you should make sure that your code
contains the command:

WBStartUp

If you know about this it will seem like a dumb statement (but you still may
have forgotten); if you don't know about it then it may make all the
difference in the world.

If the programs that crashed were started from the workbench, and if you don't
get the same problem when you run them from two shells, I can pretty much
guarantee this is it.

If you don't know why you need to do this, first understand that programs are
run from the WB or CLI in different ways.

>From WB, your program is launched (i.e. becomes its own process) and is sent a
WBStartup message which it must return before it ends.

>From CLI, your prgram runs using the CLI's process, and it is not sent any
messages.

The command WBStartup tells BB2 that your program might be run from WB, so it
adds extra code to detect this so that it sends back the WB's message when
your program ends.

If you are started from the WB and you don't return your message when you
exit, differnt things may happen depending on certain factors, but the
situation you describe is one of them.

If it doesn't help you, it will no doubt help someone else.

Well I don't use any third party libraries just those supplied with 
blitz II and any upgrades from the BUM disks.  What is really bugging 
me is that the problem arises no matter how simple I make the code, 
it requires no fancy or of the wall programming to cause the crash.  
As I mentioned earlier standard Intuition Windows etc. via Blitz's built
in commands is enough.

Hmm. The last one would be the most likely cause of the problem alright, the 
only questions are:

Does the runtime error trapping apply to Amiga built executables as well as code 
compiled and run from within the Blitz environment?

Would you not need to generate an error for the crash to occur or 
would merely enabling the error checking be enough to cause a crash?

If you take a look at ALL the stuff each month that comes out on cover 
disks and all the other stuff that doesn't (hmm thats pretty clever) my 
guess is the standard is pretty darn high.

I'd like to hear how roketz did, one of the more impressive Blitz ps

Vision Software who were in the same office as us for quite a while use 
to get more enjoyment from the letters people would send them rather than 
the money which I think is a big thing, gratification for your work rather 
than payment is just/more important for some...

This is definately the big one for us also. However my biggest fear is 
that Amiga can not cut it on the net. AMosaic is just SO far behind 
netscape, or maybe i've just got a really old version. AmiTCP is complete 
overkill for homeusers wanting to use their Amiga for a dialup connection...

Something HAS to be done! 

Well, me and Mark did get the IP checksum happening last night and he's 
got slip working from bb, hopefully ppp is not too far behind and then a 
nice bb socket library....

Hmmm, this should have come up b4 but I can't remember...

Runtime errors is for development, in my view if you want clean 
multitasking well behaved executables you must not enable runtime errors. 
It is up to you to check for filenotfound etc. errors... With runtime 
errors disabled I'm pretty sure:

SetErr:End:End SetErr

will help in a lot of situations...

Subject: SuperSkidmarks (on CD32)

G'day All,
  I just purchased Super Skidmarks for the cd32 yesterday, and am
very impressed.

  I'm glad to see that the keyboard routine was changed (allowing
cd32's to use it), but am suprised that the tracks are only the
normal ECS ones.  Where are the AGA tracks (similar to the one
found on the old cover diski from AmigaCD (from about a year ago)??

  What I'd like to know (this is the Blitz part), is was this due
to a technical reason??  ie, was it too hard (in terms of speed),
to be able to have both an AGA track, as well as controlling the 8
cars and scrolling the screen, or, was it they just weren't
included??  Also, how much of the game was written in assembler,
and how much blitz??

  Were there any extra libs written for the game??  If so, what did
they do, and will they be available in ABC??

  Also, how was the hires mode done??? It appears as though the
screen has been put into hires de-interlaced (ie, half of an
interlaced screen - every 3nd line has been removed).


  Just as a side note, where the hell is the car converter??  It
doesn't appear to have been included on the CD.  Will I get this
when I send off the registration??

Thanks for any info (and sorry if this isn't related to blitz
enough to appear in the list).

Dave

Subject: blitz v1.9

   Lately I got a multiscan monitor, so I upgraded to Blitz 1.9 (on
BUM7) which can deal with DBLPal screens (if they are not overscanned).
That is, the debugger works again.

   I recompiled some old programs which load in gfx files from the
same directory as the Blitz program.  They worked fine when running
under the Blitz environment.

   But the standalone compiled versions failed to load the gfx, because
instead of starting from the directory the program was in, they
looked in SYS: for the files.

   I could solve it with pathnames or assigns, I suppose, but I'd like
to have things as simple as with Blitz1.7.  Does anybody know how to
fix this, or at least to learn the current directory of a started-up
blitz executable?  I need something that is Wb1.3 compatible.


   Thanks...

 Your quite right Simon, the standard of amiga pd/sw software is getting 
 very high indeed. I think you will find it is largely due to Blitz Basic
 and other less capable languages (ahem).

 From what I hear it is doing very well indeed.

 Nail on the head. There is nothing like receiving a letter from someone
 somewhere in teh world saying "thanks for a great game". Tetris Duel
 AGA, which I released as s/w, got 3 registrations and a truck load of
 thankyou mail. I even got one letter from a Polish Sailor who apologised 
 for not being able to pay the reg fee! So I sent him a free copy, 1 month
 later and another letter from him. This is what it is all about. I'm not
 saying I would not have liked more money BUT in the end it's just 
 great to kow your stuff is out there and being enjoyed.

 There is a flip side. Amiga owners (in general) are begining to get on 
 my nerves (not you guys at all, read c.s.a.games). They whinge and
 want everything for no effort. I have to admit I have just bought a high 
 spec PC for games coding, and although missing blitz I have found the
 PC community very friendly. It took me 2 weeks to work out why. Many
 of them used to be Amiga coders.

 If it had not been for the support of the people on the Blitz list I 
 would have stopped releasing stuff on the Amiga last year (I will never
 stop writing stuff for it, just releasing) so a big thanks to everyone
 espicially Mikko, Marky Tiff, Brett Cooper and all the others.

 Sorry for the delay with the next ShapeZ, but there are some BIG changes
 going on under the bonnet which will allow you all to make ShapeZ jump
 through hoops 8)

Well...the Roketz did pretty good for 'pocket money' but that's about 
it...i.e. it would be ok if it was written by one dude...to be 
honest we thought it'll be more successful...at the
moment it's good if we get 1 (one) registerer per week (hmm there was
3 weeks quiet now and yesterday there were 2 new lucky Roketz
owners ;) Hmm...perhaps there wasn't enough adds for it...on the other 
hand it should be included on every biggest PD library out there... 
I think there's about 200 official registered users world wide now
and I think it's not that much or is it?
One thing of course is that the game is AGA only...we're working
on ECS version now so perhaps it even gets released ;)

And for now it has only been on 1 coverdis (Amiga Power) which
said the game sucked - obviously it didn't ;) - it's just that
the reviewer dude just didn't like gravity games 8)
AmigaFormat somehow refused although they seem SO friendly on
their coverdisk submissions i.e. just send it to us and we'll take 
care of it...well it ain't like that - we bombed Stephen Bradley
(some important dude in AF) with phonecalls for a month or so
and finaly we just gave up...

Yes... 'thank you' letters are also cool - it's also good to know 
what people think of you/your product.

One thing is sure - you won't get rich on Amiga Shareware scene though
you might get famous (at least a bit ;)

Hi there. I have a few questions.

1) What is my registration number and where do i find it out. The reason 
i am asking is Yesterday I rang Acid Distribution UK to notify them of my 
change of address and they asked me for my identification number which i 
do not have and never had. Also I asked if they had sent out BUM 8. There 
reply was no we are still waiting for it. 

2) Is Rocketz on the aminet

3) Does any one on the list know if i have to contact power computing for 
a software upgrade to the XL 1.76M Disk drive, as I have a V1.2 of the patch
and would like to get hold of 1.3 or higher as 1.2 is a bit buggy, or is 
it on the aminet as well

4) Where can i get hold for the lastest version of the BBGTLIB the one 
with GTGimmieCludge and GTdeallocate (i dont know if my version has these 
commands).  

1 and 3 are the most urgent as i finshes at uni for the year and consequently
lose access to e-mail.

Thanks Rupet and simon for the AGA DPF and Plasma code.

Cheers

I cant agree more with that.  When i moved from AMOS Professional to BB,
one of the two things i missed, was AMOS's abillity to 'Fold' procedures
down to a single line, just at the hit of an F-Key. This meant that all
code was in the editor at all times (so when an error occured you were
taken straight to it) but all procedures were only visably one line big.
This made the code appear a lot shorter so finding your way round a large
program was childsplay.
I would really love to see this in blitz.  Possibly do the same to GoSub
routines as well. In other words this;

  .subroutine_name
    .
    ..
    lots of lovely code :-)
    ..
    .
  Return

Could be turned into this;

  .subroutine_name


What do people think?  Any likely-hood of this becoming reality?

PS. In case anyones interested, the second thing i really miss is AMOS
    Pro's FULL help system.

I wasnt trying to create a read-only listview gadget, i was trying to

which i have now done thanks to the guys on this list.

Was you asking me in particular these questions, or just saying hi?
If you were asking me im afraid i cant help, ive never got the #LV_Readonly
tag to do anything, and ive never had any need to open a screen using
ScreenTags.  Sorry.

Still, someone else will probably help with these.  Byee.

I dont know of an actuall command, but I've written a quicksort

I tried as you suggested and disabled the runtime error checking 
before building my executable and guess what?  It worked :-)  No 
crashes so far, so I assume that the Blitz error checking was causing 
the original problem.  

This man is a genius :-) Thanks for the help.

I wouldn't go near an Amiga usenet group with an Axe in my head, that 
side of the Amiga community is definately a little self opinionated to 
say the least... As for PC, I don't see what the big drama is all about, 
a computer is a computer, the amount of enjoyment I've got from learning 
3 other assembly languages and 2 other operating systems this year has 
been much more eye openning now I've shrugged off any ami-phobic problems...

I prefer people mailing and saying what they like/dislike about any 
software - there's nothing like being egotripped about something you've 
written.  As for money, well I'll be programming for a living soon at 
which time I'll earn money - I wouldn't expect to get much out of shareware.

Although it would have been nice if ***someone*** mailed me about my nice 
map editor...  It's still a shame since the registered version is soooo 
cute :)

Noone is ever likely to get much out of shareware unless the program is 
mindbogglingly brilliant, or can't live without fantastic.  200 people 
registered doesn't sound like a lot in real terms but its still a fair 
number - not enough to live on though...

Its a shame that people seem to associate shareware with free software (I 
do it myself half the time).  I would assume that its a fact of life that 
shareware will not earn money, especially in a relatively small market 
as the Amiga.  On the PC its slightly different in that you have such a 
massive user base that you'd make a killing even if a relatively small 
percentage of people actually registered.  I think if people intend to 
make money out of their computer, but remain as hobbyists, they most 
probably will have to write on a machine with a massive user base.

Know how you feel about AP - they slated our BlitzBombers game next time 
and stated incorrectly that a software house had bought the rights to it 
and were 'fixing all the wrongs'.  I think that mag has a serious ego 
problem.  And its a bit shit :).

Roketz on a coverdisk would be bloody brilliant - give it the coverage it 
requires to make some money and the coverage it deserves for being so 
good.  The mags though might be worried about size (how much space does 
Roketz take up?) and the fact that loads of people with PD library 
access/Aminet access will have already seen it.

Fame is why we started....  Oh and to win that bloody Amiga Format Blitz

Whakt you need is a replacement acid library that fixes some quirks 
introduced into Blitz2 in BUM7.  I think the library is the cliargs lib, 
although I could be wrong.

I found some nasty little quirks in the library - which have hopefully 
now been completely killed off.

Bugs involved the freeing of gtmenulists before a program exited (bug in 
library finit routine).  There was also a problem of the menustrips not 
being freed up when the program ends.

Drop us a line for a fresh version...

I sent a copy of the lib out to a list of people but the address above 
came back with an error.  Chris Feringa: is this the correct address for 
you, if yes then can you ask one of the other people I sent the lib to to 
forward you a copy of it.

Lib was sent to the following addresses:

If any of you don't receive the lib through mail soon they just drop 
another line, slagging off Portsmouth university and asking for a fresh 
version.

Yes, and I've also created a Blitz2 library to bring it up on your own 
BB2 screen as well, go directly to any node or line, etc.  If you're 
interested, e-mail me and I'll work out a way to get it to you...

routine, I had a go at it last night.

 I'm hoping to find around 4-5 people who would like to test the new code.
Any takers? (NOTE: I _want_ feedback.. So only respond if your willing
to do this..) If, for some reason, I wind up with more than five people
wanting to check it out, I'll prolly just limit sending out the lib
to the first five. If the lib seems okay, I'll release it.

Perhaps  I  can  help  a bit for you guys to get some money from the german
users.   Many  of  them  _want_ to register and pay the shareware fee.  But
there's a big problem which I can understand very well:

E.g.   you'll  have  to  register with 5 pounds.  Okay, where can you get 5
pounds from in Germany???  No bank just changes 5 pounds.  The next problem
is:  You'll have to send this money in an envelope to a foreign country.  I
personally  wouldn't  do this.  The third problem is:  Will the author ever
send me an update or something else (he's so far away).

These  are  many  reasons  which  keep  most  of  the  german users off the
registration for a real good shareware product.

Okay,  what  can I do?  For example I (=the german Blitz2 distribution) can
function  as an agency by collecting the fees in german DM and forward them
to  the  authors.   This  means the users have a contact address in Germany
which makes things _much_ easier for them.

Another  suggestion:  We sell a disk ("low cost") with a registered version
of  the  program, this would be against the shareware idea, but perhaps the
author could get some money with it.  Example:  We sell ShapeZII (shareware
5  pounds  I  think) for DM 25,- (10 pounds).  50-50 between author and us.
For  our 50% we would take care (send out) updates etc., self-evident!  The
author  just  has  to  send us the update.  If we would make it DM 30,-, we
could also include a german documention (necessary in Germany...)



If there are any cool Blitz programers outside who developed cool stuff in
and/or for BlitzBasic, then contact me, I'm sure we can find a solution!

Falk

Have you thought about trying datatypes?  Has anyone played with datatypes

does anyone know how to set up a ppp connection with amitcp 2.3 ?

my work provides me with a non dynamic ppp connection to the internet over
the phone lines.... non dynamic being that i have a fixed ip address...

the problem is this.. first i have to dial up and login using AT commands..
i use ncomm to write the AT commmands.. the problem is once i have logged in
and told the sytem i want a pp connection, i then execute my amitcp startup..
this gives me 'can`t open serial device', obvioulsy because it is being used
by ncomm..

i therefore thought i should close the serial port from ncomm and then do
the amitcp startup... but this loose the telephone line link.. ie the host
modem hangs up... ?

any ideas on how i should do this..

all the scripts for connecting to ionternet via ppp at work are for a PC..
but surely i should be able to get it working with my Amiga. I have tried
some of the dialup scripts off aminet.. ie the arexx ones, but once they
close the serial port (they also mention something about closing the
serail port but leaving DTR open) the phone line is lost..

Any ideas ?

TIA

Falk,
What you're saying sounds interesting enough.  I wouldn't mind having a 
go at this since I've had fuck all response from people (***EXCEPT*** one 
person - you know who you are) about my map editor.

Nigel: Wanna do that collection that we wanted to do before?  And have

I just thought about this when reading Matt's letter, but how do I access
datatypes within blitz2? Unfortunately, I have not got the Autodocs3 yet-
(and maybe I should wait until the RISC-OS comes out...:) ).

What is the VBlank No. 2 for? It does _nothing_ on my Amiga (1200)

In an old blitz-list-entry I read about a problem with the BitmapInput-
function in Blitz-Mode - I have exactly the same problem, but I did not
read anything about it since then. The problem is as following:
You start in BLITZ-mode, do a nice intro where you need a input from
the keyboard (i.e. for entering your name). Then you want to load in
level-data and things like, so you enter QAMIGA-mode and load everything
in. Ok, no problem until now: In your game you want to access the keyboard
again (using BitMapInput) and what happens is 1)nothing 2)a system failure.
If somewants, I can mail a example (very short, fear not). The funny thing
is that on Blitz-PD 2 or so (Asmodeus), the same happens if you play the
game twice and enter your name the second time...
It must have to do something with FileInput - I think Blitz does not re-
direct the input correctly to the keyboard when in Blitz-mode. I have no
idea...

Sorry for the long mail, it's my first and I have much to catch up with.:)

I need to be able to place the mousepointer relatively to screen,

I know that viewmode=Peek.w(ViewPort(0)+32) , but what I don't know
(and can't test with my A3000) is what this gives in AGA machines
in different resolutions. 

Or is there a better way to find out the resolution of the screen ?

Why reinvent the wheel. There are a mass good text editors and a compiler

I'd prefer a fully useable and bugfree version of Amiga-Blitz. You
should imho first concentrate on the "mother of all Blitz'" to get it
work right...

And, in fact, on the PC-Side they use Visual Basic and got a real good
thing with it so I don't believe you'll make that much money with it.
Or do you do it for crosscompiling your games? But: Does anyone want's
to code games on your amiga?

If  we  (Acid)  can  program  a  stand  alone  compiler,  somebody (or Acid
themselves)  can  program  an  API  module (special format for GoldED) in C
which  can  still  be  used  as  an  CLI  compiler.  This API module can be
implented  in GoldED and can be controlled via GoldED. If you've just a CLI
compiler,  you'll  always  have  to  save  your  source, start the external
compiler etc. This take too much time of course. Another advantage ist that
via this (and GoldED) Blitz2 gets an ARexx interface :-)

If  somebody wants more information conc. these modules: In the GED archive
there's  a  directory  called 'API'. If more people are interested in it, I
can also post it to the list!

You are both right, we must not forget the users who still don't have the
configuration. Besides: In Germany we chucked OS1.3 over one year ago. It
makes no sense supporting this anymore. A harddisk is already highly
recommended by us. An API (CLI version) would make it very easy to include
another, simple editor for people with less equipment. 

A programer who really wants to program DOES have the configuration I'm
sure. Somebody who doesn't have the configuration doesn't need GoldED
'cause it's too prfoessional. These people should perhaps get a 'light'
editor (like TED). Okay, a little bit confused, but I hope you understand
what I mean :-)))

You lot can have my GED Blitz config (and all associated files)(athough
it is a bit naff).
 It's very easy to install, all u have to do is copy all files into a

The bad news is that the author of Blitz2 is no longer part of Acid 
Software, I am struggling to get new editor interface plus all bugs fixed 
for bum8/ABC. After this I really can't see what should happen to BB... 
The reality is the only people who have made money out of Blitz have been 
the ones that wrote games with it (us included). Our emphasis is now 
developing on many platforms (Amiga, Sega, Jaguar and PC at present)..

The mother of all Blitz for use is one that can generate code for many 
machines, the mother of all Blitz for you is perhaps a bug free compiler 
that works with GoldEd, you will be happy to know that your mother is top 
priority for us at present:)

Game development on PC is still very difficult.

Unfortuneately (at least in some cases) Blitz2 always tries to open *ALL* 
libraries used in your program before your program gets a chance to run 
at all-- and it will then close these libraries after the last line of 
your code is completed...  There is only one workaround, and that is to 
open the libraries yourself and call them (in assembly only) in a 
function or subroutine...

If you need examples of doing this, e-mail me and I'll throw something 
together... :)

I think it is the only way to go. I was just wondering how many people
have registered Blitz?

Visual Basic does not support any kind of games development it really
is only good for UI development.

PC games development is a little difficult, but I have managed to get the
basic game engine for Blitz Bombers up and running in 12 days. This is
from scratch, writing all the graphics primitives file handling the
lot, which is not bad considering I had never coded on a PC before. 
It ain't that hard.

I think Blitz would go down a storm on the PC. 

I can see why you are having trouble Simon, so what next? I presume this
is the end of Blitz on the Amiga, so why not pass on the code to another
company (maybe one of Hisofts developers could pickit up (for a price)).

You split up with Acid? I just began to like this company ... :) Are you
planning to run your own software-company? But who will take care of BB?
This language is getting more and more important on the Amiga, I think..
I simply cannot imagine that it does not pay anymore to develop that engine..

why  should this be the end for Blitz on the Amiga? Escom brings Amiga back
to  the computer world, so there's a biiiiig market for Blitz (they plan to
sell  150.000  Amigas  till end of the year). There's no other Basic on the
Amiga that can concure with Blitz, SAS/C is also dead, this is the chance.

It's  no  wonder  that  Acid Software is unable to make money with it, just
look  at  their marketing behaviours. Bugs, bugs, bugs, instead of removing
them,  they  promise  us  the  moon, "only a few days etc." and program new
bugs  (Hi  Jurgen...).  Maybe  they  should  listen  to the bug reports and
suggestions  of  the  users, then they would be able to make Blitz the best
programming  language for the Amiga. How long did we suffer under TED, if I
haven't  bombarded  Simon  with  suggestions  and concepts for a new ED, he
would still swear on it. This is just one example.

[complaining off]

Blitz  has  so many excellent features and just some "simple" bugs, if Acid
Software  is  unable  to remove them, they have to sell it (I know somebody
who would buy it :-)). But don't sell it to HiSoft.....

Simon,  just  send  me the source of the compiler, and I will organize some
capable  programmers who develope everything we/you want. Implement GoldED,
LES  Debugger,  cool  userlibs, program an optimizer and have a look on the
few bugs in the existing libraries - where's the problem? Such a BlitzBasic
would let every PC user go green with envy.

Let's  see  what  the "blitz week" at Acid brings. Maybe it's my fault that
I'm still such an optimist after working three years "together" with Acid?

I think maybe you misunderstand me. Blitz is a hell of a big project to keep
rolling with just one person. What I was suggesting was that if Simon
could not keep up with it, there would be people who could pick it up
and KEEP IT GOING! That's the main point, I agree Blitz could sweep the Amiga
scene.

This is the real problem. LES has supplied Acid with a multitude of big fixes,
Gadtools, keyboard device etc, and I have yet to see Acid release them. 
I sent Acid loadsastuff for BUM 8 ages ago. The BUMS don't always have to be
another Landmark for Blitz, they just need a few examples, a nice proggy and
some gossip!

It was just a suggestion to keep it alive IF Simon could not. I mean,
would you rather have no Blitz or Hisoft (insert name of better publisher
here)?

Sounds great to me. I know LES would like to be involved in someway, I think
we have a proven track record as one of the most productive Blitz coding
groups.

I'm all for Blitz on the Amiga, I hope they both go from strength to strength,
I would like to be part of that effort.

 RELEASE NOTICE:

 Since I didn't find enough people wanting to help test the Protracker routine I 
fixed up (From Neil O'Rourke's source) I decided to upload it to Aminet in the 
dev/misc directory as-is. (The routine has been tested and found working on four
machines as of now.)

 BUG NOTICE: 

 After uploading, I noticed that _some_ modules don't care for the command 
DecodeModule. (I fixed this problem in the LoadTrackerModule command, but didn't 
think to check any included modules.) The problem has been fixed, and the new 
version will be sent up shortly.)

 WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE: 

 This version does NOT require the SetDMA command. (As a matter of fact, the SetDMA 
command has been removed.) This is most meaningful to anyone who wants to use noise/
protracker modules in their programs and want it to work on other peoples machines.

The requests for bbc100.lha have been flooding in, but I think I have
responded to everyone who asked before the weekend.  If you don't have yours
yet, and you asked for one, write again, or...

It is also available from x2ftp.oulu.fi in (I think) /pub/amiga/prog/blitz
or will be shortly, when the administrator accepts it.

RE: cross-development via blitz:

This is a great idea.  You don't have to like PCs to make money off people who
buy them (hey, that's how I pay the rent).

Question: Why did Infocom (before they died) make fistfuls of money?
Answer:   Their stuff was available for just about anything ever made
          (and still is).  Why?  Their games were written in a pseudo-
          assembler code.  They simply wrote one "Z-Machine" (interpreter
          engine) for each computer, and then any of their games was
          directly compatible (put it on a disk with the interpreter
          and away you go, no conversion of any kind).  They did _not_
          go out of business because they didn't make money.

Of course this is much more complicated when you leave the text adventure
genre, but the idea is there.

And about pirates on the pc: yes they are out there, but so is everyone else,
and here's the trick:

The pc market is easily more than 100x that of the Amiga market.  So for every
copy you sold  of an Amiga version, you would (very roughly) expect 100 copies
to be sold for the pc.  That's a very big difference in profits.

65% of software in the U.S. is in legal copies (compare 8% Japan, 1% Thailand);
I'm pretty sure you can find several non-pirate copies of Excel (go to any big
business that isn't using Lotus).

Mark has set up BlackMagic as we both needed our independence. The fact 
that I seem to take credit for writing Blitz in many magazines being an 
example. Gloom is one of the best games ever written for Amiga 
technically and playability wise, it was obvious if Acid was to publish 
then then Mark the author would not have got fair credit...

Now don't get me wrong here either. I NEVER said we would stop supporting 
Amiga. The fact is that working on other types of computers after 6 years 
is very refreshing. It puts a few things into perspective especially 
programming methodology etc. The fact that I now have a hell of a lot 
more respect for C (not that I use or like it) is one such instance.

Yes, we made enough money that we can drop all our other projects and 
spend 18 months developing the next generation Blitz. Baaaah.

Hey Simon, how about pushing for a deal with Escom to bundle Blitz/ABC
with the new Amigas. Since the Amiga needs to come back in a big way
this just might do it. With a lanuage like Blitz packed with the new
Amigas, many users would really get to see the power of their machines.
It would develope a larger user base for Blitz and enhance sales for Escom.

That's right. Also with Gloom - really a hit! It's the hardest of the Doom-

Wasn't the Commodore-saga refreshing enough? ;)
However, I have a lot of respect for C, knowing that the Amiga's OS was made
with it. It's only that the source always looks like blasted spaghetti...
Besides, I will be able (/forced) to use it soon (university).

Don't get me wrong: at the time Blitz-I was released, it was unbeatable both
in power and easiness of use. (I had been looking for such a package for 
years!) - and I dare say that for every BlitzI-Fan these 18 months were as

The way I see it, the Amiga market, whilst being small, is still worth 
supporting - but it cannot support all the software houses that were 
hanging onto it.  Thus recently loads have left, or moved to 
concentrating on other platforms - this is to be expected, they are after 
all businesses.  It doesn't mean that the Amiga market is gonna fall dead 
overnight - forgive me if I'm being naive or over-optimistic about all 
this...

Simon Armstrong has recently put further work on Blitz in question - Mark 
Sibly leaving Acid is obviously gonna effect it.  Also the fact that Acid 
are a commercial company and need to make money out of their products is 
a key factor - just how much money is there to be made out of Blitz 
compared to a good game?  I wonder how well sales of Blitz II compared to 
sales of big games.

I'm not saying that Blitz should be abandoned - but something does need 
to be done if its to be considered to be a friendly and powerful language 
that is being supported by its creaters and users.  In the past Steve 
Matty and I have helped with support for Blitz in our own way and will 
probably continue to do so.  The question is, what are Acid gonna do with 
it?  It maybe possible that Simon would like to 'contract out' Blitz 
development - in which case we'd certainly be interested...

I did notice in a recent letter from Simon Armstrong that he came across 
as being rather consilatory towards people on the Blitzlist.  I can 
understand him wanting to support other platforms (we ourselves are 
branching out to support PC in an initially limited way) but how about a 
little movement on the Amiga front?  I think we could all use some after 
that Commodore fiasco.

Here it comes: Amiga Ltdh (?). I know this is kind of daydream, as they can't be
that clever, can they ?  If I was in the head of Amiga Ltdh, I would make
everything possible to push developing of development environments.
Blitz is surely one of the programming languages with most potential.
I would make Blitz & the source pd, and pay little something for all good
enchancements for it (new libraries, frontends, utilities and so on).
I really think this would be great in the long run for the company.

But how to get them to realize that ?

I'd like to my conribution to the ongoing Ted debate. 

I think it is basically okay, as it includes an ability to highlight
text, and tells you the cursor position. I have changed the prefs so
that the background text appears in black. This makes things much more
readable. What I can't do, however, is change the colour of highligthed
text. It appears in white, and is very difficult to read.

I, myself, think it could do with a few tweaks- but on the whole, it's okay.
It's a lot more useful than some of the text editors that I've tried that
are out on Public Domain - and I don't have to send off a registration fee.

Has anyone thought of doing a Public Domain version of Basic - like Blitz
Basic, only better? (i.e. without the bugs, and with more logical features).
And including the source code - e.g. made from lex and yacc?

Has anyone thought of doing a user magazine for Blitz? - like BUM, only for
free, and one that actually does make an appearance every so often?

the problem conc. Blitz is in my opinion, that most of the PC users do 
_use_ programs and do not develope programs. Yes, the market is much 
bigger, but not for programing languages. PCs are in every office, nearly 
everybody has got one at home, but for their purposes QBasic is enough, and
if they want to develop with a "real language", they use Visual Basic or
C++ (was it from MS?). Blitz wouldn't have a chance. But on the Amiga
market there

a) are more "freaks"

b) is only BlitzBasic ;-)

So BlitzPC isn't a good idea I think.

Subject: Money with Blitz2

Hi,

it's obvious that Acid Software isn't able to make any money with Blitz2 if
they don't produce any. There's still a great demand for it, even for V1.9.
But  Acid  hasn't shipped any for about 9 months (correct me if I'm wrong),
where should the money come from?


The normal way for a software company should be (as I believe):

A  software  product  is developed and sold. It gets a good reputation, but
there are still some bugs in it.

The  company  develops  a  new, better version. a) The user can upgrade (by
_buying_ an update) b) The users, who haven't bought it yet due to its bugs
do  now  buy it. c) Others buy it 'cause it has new, cool features d) don't
forget the guys who will change from other products (here: A*OS)

In  this  circulation  the  company must earn money, if they don't, there's
something going wrong...

During  this  whole  time,  there arises new demand with every new computer
sold. (This situation will start in September again.)


Please please please Simon & Mark, update Blitz2, produce new units and the
rest will work by itself I'm sure.


hoping,


Falk

The following is reply, which I got from Dr. Peter Kittel, one of 
the bosses at Amiga Technologies GmbH.

Now I would like you all to give me some reasons, why they should
buy Blitz instead of concentrating on E or something else (ofcourse,
they could do both, who knows). I would also like to know, what you
think are the best examples of Blitz's power.

Simon, how large part of the games which you and Mark have written, are
written with Blitz (I mean, how much is Blitz % & how much assembler) ?
And would Blitz be for sale, if we can ensure Peter ?

already enough messages/day 8).

This is an example of calling exec library's FINDTASK() command 
with a (name) argument of zero.  The information can be found in the 
RKM's or in books such as "Mapping the Amiga."  This is completely from 
my head, so I can't guarantee it'll work as-is, but it *should* be fine.


#_findtask=-$126  ;The offset to exec's findtask() function

Function.l getmytask{}

All screens *CREATED* (not found) by Blitz's screen library use a UserID 
value equal to the characters "BlTz" to identify which were created by 
the blitz program.  At the program end, Blitz will search the list of 
screen objects either FindScreen'ed, or opened:  Those that have this 
special UserID are CloseScreen'ed and those that don't are just 
"forgotten."

This means that programs written in Blitz can FindScreen other program's 
screens and not close them on exit, but if the found screen is that of 
another program compiled in BB2, it *will* try to close it.

I'm now in the process of re-writing the screen library to help cope with 
this, as well as use more efficient (2.x and above) means to grab 
workbench, etc. and possibly support public screen creation too.

Ooops-- forgot to offer my suggestion to work around the screen-closing 
problem in the last message:  The easiest (legal too, as hackish as it 
seems) way would be to:

Use NewZap, FileX etc. to modify the blitz executeable in question-- 
Search and replace all occurences of the "BlTz" string with another 
4-char string of your choice-- just make sure you use the same string 
throughout... (You could use your own initials or something.)

Odd as it sounds I'm pleased to hear that this bug actually exists!

I've used FindScreen once or twice like this, and knowing how Blitz tends to
be, I programmed around it without even testing if it ever did this or not!

The screen object is (if I recall) simply a pointer to an Intuition screen. 
(I wondered that the object wasn't bigger, so that they could keep track of
exactly the thing we're talking about: i.e. who owns the screen, Blitz or
someone else, but maybe they use the user data field of the screen structure
(which might explain why Blitz sometimes gets tricked) or something equally
bizzare.).

Anyway, you _should_ be able to stop it from doing it by changing the address in
the object to zero, i.e. Poke.l Addr Screen(scrn_num), 0 (or something
similar), so that it points to NULL instead of a real screen.

However, for anything more than a hack or utility for yourself, you should
probably be using public screens -- otherwise, suppose the user quits the
program you're using (closing the screen) and you either (a) still have an
open window on it [could get real ugly, real fast] or (b) try to use the
screen after it doens't exist [see previous comment].

Hope this helps.

Thanks Richard, but it`s to hard for me to code those stuff in

Well, actually... In 2.x and above, you *can't* close a screen with 
windows on it... (Blitz included!)  No crashes or anything, the 
CloseScreen_ intuition function just returns FALSE and does nothing if a 
window is still open on the screen in question....

However, Public Screens probably would be better, but they're a pain 
to keep up with by yourself, though not impossible in BB2 even now using 
ScreenTags...  I'm now working on a COMPATIBLE replacement for the 
original screen library to handle some of these things automatically.  It 
will feature Public Screen support as well.

You will find the OpenWindowTagList() function is a *LOT* easier to use, 
which I'd recommend using.  It simply requires a taglist (see includes 
and autodocs) and you can pass a null newwindow structure.

I think Blitz pokes the user data of the intuition screen structure with 
the value bLTz (or something like that).  It then looks through all 
screens it has initialised - checking for this value in the userdata.  
ShapezII is written in blitz and so blitz running your program attempts 
to free the screen because it sees the blitz identifier.  It would be 
possible to change the screen library so that instead of using the 
userdata field it has a flag to say whether or not the screen was created 
via the Screen/ScreenTags command.

hi..

wot is the best way to pass parameters between a c module and an
assembler module, and how do i pass a return value back from the
assembler module ?

an example may be the best for of help, ie write a calling c module
which passes 2 numbers to a function called add whihch adds them together
and returns the result .. ie the c prog would be..

number1= 10
number2= 20
printf( "%d\n",add(number1,number2)

the asm module would contain

add.l d0,d1
ie how do i pass in number1 as d0, number2 as d1, and read d1 from the c code
as the return value ?

and wot sort of extern definitions do i need to give etc ?

thanx, i hope it all makes sense

Try using the ForcePal/ForceNTSC commands from the ElmoreHardware 
library-- They *should* work fine in Blitz mode...  Of course the user 
needs a monitor or true PAL TV to see the display correctly.

You might be better off forcing the screenmode to NTSC (to get a 
fullscreen image on PAL machines.)

I basically agree, although you are quite wrong about Windows. I have
a doom clone the runs in my 1024x768 24 bit Windows screen which is
almost as fast as normal Doom II in DOS. Windows now has a load of stuff
to support game development. 

I can't say much more but Windows is not the Sloth it used to be. 

Still don't like it as an OS much, but you CAN do FAST games in Windows.

I disagree with that. When Eurpress launched their 'Amos for PC'

    People can't or won't program in Pascal or C++ because the
support facilities and libraries for hi-quality graphics/sound
etc are either too hard to get hold of or just don't exist...
it's not a question of Pascal being too hard.
    I ditched the PC in favour of the A600 then 1200 some time
back because 'mig packages such as Blitz provide full and easy access
to system routines for graphics/sprite/bob/sound handling.
    Packages like Borland's C and C++ were OK if you wanted easy
file handling etc but totally and utterly crap if you wanted to
bash together a quick Space Invaders.... or Doom ;)

> PC owners are screaming for this kind of procduct, if Acid don't give

    If Blitz and similar existed for the PC I would, in all
probability, invest huge amounts of cash in one with all speed (if
only to see my new kit become obselete in approx 6 weeks, unlike
my Amiga 1200 etc etc etc etc.... :)

    Nigel: Give it to the world! The first one in gets a huge sum
of cash out, IMHO.

OK Andrew, I like you, but I don't takle this shit from anyone. I'm not quite sure
what you are getting at here. The game is in 256 colours but I run windows in a 24 bit 
screen mode. So even though the game IS only in 256 colours it is still updating on
a 24 bit screen. Don't tell me this is not true, because I got the game from a cover-disk.
Lot's of people have it.

For a start I told you it was running in Windows. The buffers are held in normal
memory. Don't even think of flaming me, I KNOW this is how it is don. A lot of PC
games do this. And my machine is a Pentium 60Mhz. 

I really f*cking hate people telling me that what I see running on my machine does
not exist.

Yes I know, but it is running through WINDOWS. Some cards are very slow, mine is a simple
32bit Trident card. Don't tell me about PC cards, no I would not be suprised, I'm bloody
coding a game on them every day.

Most PC 24 bit cards for SVGA are chunky. Any slow down caused by cards not having a linear
addressing space can be avoided.

I just wish I could tell you all I know and what I am  going to be doing. You do not
know what you are talking about. Sorry Andrew, that's it. I don't suppose you

Sure it WILL run SLOWER but not as SLOW as ____I____ thought. When I saw the
Doom game running, and then latyer became privvy to how it is done (with full
OS support) I was pleasently suprised.

These compilers are NOT for games. I'll stop right there before I explode. Don't
tell me what PC owners want and do not want. I read all their news groups, espcially
the programming ones, and they want an alternative to C whic provides built in
features to ease game development for new programmers and the like. 

I did not mean it SHOULD run in windows, I just was pointing out it could and what
was about. I did not have you down as a blinkered Amiga owner.

Yeah? You find someone else how can master a new machine from scratch in 2 weeks and
then be offered work by a multi-million pound games company. Not many of us. You 
want to be watching Leading Edge, we're going places.

I'll bring in the games name and the name of magazine I got it from for you tomorrow.
I will not have you say I'm talking shite, you can play the game on a PC and see

I know how you feel :-(  I discovered the *correct* syntax (as 
opposed to the incorrect one in the manual) after weeks of searching.  
Well here it is....

OpenSerial(device$, unit#, baud, io_serflags)

where device$ = serial.device or a replacement
unit# = the id of the port to access, for multi port serial cards I 
assume.


Hope this helps

I disagree with this. Click and Play is a very very good product. It we

for beginners that lets them easily learn the concepts behind game 
design. Blitz has never and will never be suitable for beginners, the

who couldn't do anything with it might have made us more money but at the

shelves never being used.

Steve etc. has to be rude about BB and it's deficiencies when it is plane 
that asm is a more suitable tool for what he wants to be doing.

and produce stuff that we can make a living from. I don't think Acid will 
ever be in the business of making large bucks from selling development 
languages, infact its more the fact that we like to share the tools we 
use to get where we want to go with others for their benefit. In regards 
to the PC it's more likelt that we will publish a large collection of 
very good modules to go with Watcom which in regards to optimisation etc. 
is mind blowing.

That's true, Blitz is not for beginners, but you CAN learn it, look 
at Amos. But when you look at Click & Play, I must say, 
sorry..It's like the S.E.U.C.K. (Shoot Em Up Construction Kit) for 
the Amiga, very limited. Maybe a Win95 Click & Play will be a hit 
because Win95 is damn fast (graphics).

I can see why Steve (and a lot of other guys) are pissed off, when 
you create a programming language it may not contain bugs since 
version 1.00. What would happend to a company like Borland do when 
they say: Sorry guys, but our products are just a tool, go 
programming in assembley...Sorry Simon, you're wrong at this point..

I hope I will see some modules for Watcom (or is it Wadcom?)

You may not realize it is a function... You would do something like this...

If OpenSerial("serial.device",0,19200,64)=0 Then End

It will return zero if the device couldn't be opened for some reason, or 
non-zero if things went OK.

 Eeh? You sure this is the routine I put there? (Check and see if SetDMA is still
a tokenised command. If it is, it is _NOT_ the one I put there.) Also make sure
that Neil's routine isn't there also, because they have the same lib number. (#57)
It could pose problems if both were present.

 (Since you're talking missing notes..) Also make sure you aren't using the commands
for modules that Blitz has. (I.e. LoadModule, etc.) There are different syntaxes 
between the two. (And for a reason.)

 I don't quite follow.. And since I HATE Am*s, I have no idea what you mean by sample
triggering. Go a little more indepth and maybe I can get an idea of what you mean.

 Yup. Add it to the user libs and remake the deflibs file. (Make sure you remove
Neil's routine if you have it.. They are both the same lib number since I basically
started working off his source.

 PS: Check the docs and see if you've got version 1.01b.. The previous version has

Yes, I tried it, but the LoadTrackerMod (or whatever it ws called) froze 
my machine solid every time :(. Also, the Decode command tokenised into 
the Stop command - wierd.

Not sure if by 'Steve etc.' you include me (you probably do) so I'll 
reply as if you did.

The reason why we are 'rude' about BB's deficiencies are:

		A) When we're polite and we get ignored.

		B) Some of the problems are incredibly annoying.

		C) I think BB should be growing and becoming better - 
hence pointing out deficiencies should be good for Blitz.

Call me old fashioned but I like to see software supported.  I 
understand that Acid are a small company and that there is obviously not 
much money in writing Blitz - compared with a top selling game for 
example.  But it'd be nice to think that Blitz was actually going 
somewhere.  It seems like at the moment, apart from stuff produced as 
user libraries by people like us, Blitz is stagnating.

I hope you don't get me wrong about all this - I do like using Blitz.  
The only problem I have is the fact that support has been lacking.  I 
could have understood this if you'd said at the beginning "This is just 
something we use, use it yourselves if you like but don't coming running 
to us with problems" but you didn't - if you make a commitment to support 
something you should make an effort to do so.

I think a fair number of Blitz users probably share my opinion with this 
(correct me if I'm wrong) - we'd like to see a little movement towards a 
new Blitz.  We ourselves have offered to help improve Blitz - just so 
that the problems get fixed but as usual there has been no reply to our 
messages...  Maybe you could at least say yes or no out of politeness.


Thats all folks,
Steve Mc.

I agree with you. And i think too, before they will look to compeletely new
things like BlitzPC, Acid should "finish" first BB2 (i mean with "finish": better
support e.c.t.). Then, if that works good, they can look forward to other
great things. IMHO normal PC-users don't have the patience like we have
here with Acid.
(If we look back to the last year we can say that Amigans are veery much
patience-people... :)

If ABC was going to be available free to registered users, I still

I purchased Blitz BASIC 2 in March 1994, and sent in $25 for BUM 
subscription three months later,... and that was the end of it.

So, how can I find out if I am a registered user? I would really like

I paid $100 US dollars for Blitz Basic II here in the States. This is 
the most I have ever paid for any computer software. I am aware that 
developement software can cost more than this but I live on a limited
income and I had to save up in order to buy Blitz. At $100 a pop it
seems that somebody made some money some where on Blitz. If you dance
to the music you got to pay the piper... the piper has been paid.

Hey if the guy who made Blitz duffed the money and ran over to the PC
side then thats life. Blitz Basic has the potential to be the best
programming language ever developed for a computer. That includes C,
C++, ASM, Pascal and Modula II. The concept of Blitz is unique to any 
language I have seen. If it takes more money to support, develop and
expand Blitz to new platforms then I am all for it.

If Blitz is stagnating it's because you can't buy it ANYWHERE. Where

then the info on the next car will be on the list....i only want to have the cars name on the list but when it is selected i want to display all the rest...

I think if anyone can explain this in simple complete terms they must be a genius also i want to access this info from a file...i would prefer it to random access so it will load the info as it is selected and then forget it when the next car is selected

 If you're talking ASM, the blitter is used. Printing shouldn't take up much cpu time..
Unless you're not double buffering the screen and have tons going on.

 Dunno about this one. If a person REALLY needed that many shapes, it would be better
to load some of them from disk now and then.

 Each set of shapes (i.e. "baddies1.shapes" and "baddies2.shapes") wouldn't use the
same memory if you IncBin'd them. By Decoding (or cludging) them, it changes blitz's
points to that/those parts of memory.

 It would be quite easy to switch between banks as long as you wanted the entire
bank. Switching to a few shapes from each would be a little more diffucult.

This probably should go elsewhere, but I plan on using Blitz, so I'll ask
here!

I want to write a program that can retrieve the dimensions of as many
graphic image formats as possible. I don't want, or need, to display the
image, just retrieve the dimensions from the image.

Image formats I'd like to be able to get this info on are IFF, GIF, JPG,
PCX, MPG (If possible - Haven't looked closely at this one), BMP, TIFF, and
TGA.

Any help on any or all of these would be much appreciated.

I've got a Picasso II (2Meg) board on my 4000, and the problem happens 
here as well-- the problem is TED is an intensive hardware-hitter for 
text and scrolling, etc. so you will have to force Blitz to use an older 
(compatible) screenmode until TED gets fixed or replaced... 

Sadly, there isn't much you can do to get non-OS compliant programs to 
work correctly on most graphic-board emulation software, no matter what 
you do... With careful programming using the proper OS calls in place of 
the Blitz-library commands that don't seem to work, you may have better 
luck making graphics-board compliant applications yourself.  Now if only 
I could use a 1600x1280 TED screen with a nice 20-point font!

> I want to know how to read what position the gtcycle gadget it at so
> I can do a gosub to the relavant code

You'll have to keep track of the value of EventCode at the time the 
gadget is pressed and stick it in a variable... GadTools doesn't allow 
you to read the value of this gadget prior to 3.x, and Blitz doesn't 
handle it correctly even in 3.x.

EGS and the wonderful world of blitz :)

I have an A2000 with a 40mhz 030 and an egs card
I am having problems with....
blitz promoting to my egs board
the debugger keeps crashing and/or won't go away when its told to
any blitting or graphics intensive coding causes a crash

if anyone out there can help or a least tell me that there is no hope 
of fixing the problems I would appreciate it

ON PROGRAMMING

I want to know how to read what position the gtcycle gadget it at so
I can do a gosub to the relavant code
The manual doesn't explain the gadgets/lists/newtypes and how they interelate
with each other very well. (Well I can't grasp it anyway)

just a small idea...if everyone could write an explaination on their most understood
commands with examples of how they work together in blitz and mail it to this list I
would be willing to put it into an amigaguide or http or just plain ASCII format
as a kind of suppliment manual that could be released on one of the BUM's disks.
If simon is interested it might help him put together a manual the the average comsumer
can understand.

I think the lack of support for blitz and for the amiga in general is the fact the
too many people find it too hard to understand the advantages of using both
Amos has support for beginners intermediate and advanced users. The manual is the 
entry level for any language. I'm not asking ACID to patronise the user but just
to consider the user.

Anyway thats my 2cents worth.

until next time.

to start programming again.

However! There is now also a PC in my house.. before you say anything
it is NOT mine! .. and there is also one of those wizzo Windows/GDI
printers... but thats not really much good if you want to print from
an Amiga!

The question is:

    "Can you successfully use one of these printers on the Amiga?"

Okay.. so here are some details:

o   NEC SuperScript 610+, GDI Laser Printer.

o   Has PCL4 emulation (but I think this is done on the PC).

Does anyone know of some Drivers for this...?

Is anyone willing to try and write a Driver for this.. (brave!)?

    Thanks,

  ...and so am I!

  I'm currently using

      328  - simple shapes
      390  - 6 groups of 65 shapes

      718  - Total shapes

  I _definitely_ need all of them at the same time.  There used to be
  8 of those 65-shape-groups.  There pretty sure will be at least 8 of
  them.  And the other day I was considering to double the amount of
  shapes used in groups...  That would make:

      328  - simple shapes
     1040  - 8 groups of 130 shapes

     1368  - Total shapes

  Am I in trouble?  Deep trouble?  So far can make it without doubling
  65 to 130, but I wanted to have at least 8 65-groups and still some
  more 'simple' shapes.  It is possible to cope with 1024 shapes, yes,
  but it will be tough...

  All of these shapes are pretty small; half of them 14x12, other half
  4x4.  I use only one Cookie for the bigger shapesize and another
  cookie for the smaller shapesize (hacking with blitz's pointers..) -
  Memory usage is 'reasonable' (with 4 bitplanes).

  My project BTW is a light multiplayer turn-by-turn strategygame.
  More about it later perhaps.

  I have some serious trouble with (un)signed variables:

    y.b
  End NEWTYPE

  Dim c.coord (10000)


  This takes some 20000 bytes memory.  I have choosen .b for x and y
  because maximum value for them might be up to 250.

  The real pain starts when I'm comparing coords.  No matter what I
  do, 128 and above is always considered less than 127 or less.

  I can solve the problem in two ways:  Using words, and wasting
  additional 20000 bytes, which _really_ isn't fair.  The other way
  is to use a sort of UnSign -function.  It takes byte parameter and
  returns word.  But that ain't fun either..

  PLEASE someone (Acid?????) fix this for me.

  How about REAL unsigned byte?
  Or 'more' and 'less' operators that do not care about signs?

  to have FTP where I could send them?  Wouldn't that be great?

  Or should I better send my progs for example to
  x2ftp.oulu.fi/pub/amiga/prog/blitz ?
  And what would be the another FTP-site?

  UpLoading to FTP would support only those who have some kind of
  access there - including poor unregistered users.

  Sending stuff to Acid would make things (possibly) appear as part of
  fufure BUM.  But when?  And it would be accessible only to
  subscribers.

  What I've got is .bb2 versions of Minesweeper & Tetris, fully
  documented example sources and some general, practical hints.  And
  then there is a _nasty_ map-editor with sourcecode.

  Interested?  Where should I send them?  Choice is Yours, let me
  know.

Until the signed/unsigned variables thing is taken care of, you won't 
need an "UnSign" function as it is easy to convert already... Just AND 
the byte with 255 to use it like an unsigned byte... Like this:

If (a.b&255)>250 Then Goto Blah

Words can be handled the same way by ANDing with 65535, like so:

If (a.w&65535)>57000 Then Goto Blah

You can always INCBIN 1000 shapes at a time in your program and use 
DECODESHAPES when you need to use another group--- Though this would be 
too slow to do real-time, I hope you don't need to be BLITting all these 
shapes together...

 This is just speculation on my part.. But Just because they have 6400 shapes doesn't
meaN that all of those shapes are in use at once. With that few shapes on screen, you
could free the old shapes and decode the new ones fast enough, I think.

 With a person having a ton of shapes for a project, you shouldn't try to have all of them
allocated at all times. The best thing would be to only keep allocated what you need. 
Otherwise your wasting memory. (Considering that even tho the shapes might be in memory,
each one requires a pointer..)

Ah well.. It's all my opinion anyways.

Steve

Then how did acid do Skidmarks 2, where you can have 8 different
types of car on screen at once.  Each car has 800 different frames,
so consequently, in memory, they have 6400 shapes.

How did they get around it for this?

Hi Everybody :) I am still having no luck in getting the view mode param from the

I am trying to write a term programand am having trouble getting my modem to dial.
The commands I am using are...
	Writeserialstring 0,"+++",1|2   ;go to command state
	ntd="ATDT"+qdial(z)\numb+"\r"   ;parse number from list
	writeserialstring 0,ntd,1|2	;1|2 means I have tried both numbers
Am I doing it wrong ???What would be the syntax to wait for a reply from the other
modem ?? Is 42 still the answer ?? :) Thanks in advance :P

*Could someone please explain what exactly ABC is? Blitz 3.0 RISC or so?
 And why is it called ABC? I'd prefer PowerBLITZ or something like that...

Problems:
* I've got problems to get rid of a copperlist (with ColSplit). I tried
  something like 
   For i=1 to CopLen
     Poke.b Coploc+i,0  ;not sure about the .b-type
   Next
  However, this method doesn't work and tends to crash. Any ideas?? It 
  would be very helpful :)
* Peter S. Giles asked how you can get the VIEWMODE from the Asl-Req-
  I can GET it (if you define the newtype as mentioned in BUM 6 -i think-
  it should be no problem, it's in the viewmode.l-var), but how can I 
  PASS it to the AslReq?
  It's annoying if the ScreenmodeAsl is always set to LoRes when I am
  using a Hires-Screen. Also, the screenheight is set to 200 (NTSC).
  Pleeease someone help!
* GTMX: How can I set a radiobutton to a specific value? (when a Shortcut
  is used) - the GTMX-comand doesn't work right, it does nothing...

Ideas:
* is it not annoying that the compiler stops at every simple syntax-error
  and you have to compile EVERYTHING again? In BLitz-I you could correct
  the line and _go on_.
* What about an 'UnShared' in Statements? I often need only one local var,
  but also the global vars from the mainprogram. At the moment, I have to
  SHARED all vars I need in my statement, and that's uncomfortable:(
  (I know, I'm lazy)

			asmexit

You dont Gregor, you close the window and screen you have opened and use the 
width height (etc) vars to open new a new screen and window.
*sc.screeninfo=ASLRequester(31)
close window 0
close screen 0
wdth=*sc\width:hgt=*sc\height    ;etc
screen 0,0,0,wdth,hgt            ;etc
window 0,0,0,wdth,hgt            ;etc

These params can then be saved and loaded with a condition if statment,user friendlyprefs :) Gregor my problem is that the new type appears to be possition sensitive
if you move a variale name up or down the newtype its vale does not follow it :(
The order for the new type appears to be:
	newtype .screeninfo
		id.l
		width.l
		depth.l
		autoscroll.l
		overscan.l
		bmapwidth.l
		bmapheight.l
	end newtype
I am using WB 2 should the order of the variables make a difference ?
If so where should the viewmode go ?
If not where do i buy a PC ?

If you could spell it right, we'd know what you wanted to be able to 
spell! ;-)

The word is "Adieu" and literally comes from the French "A Dieu", meaning 
"To God" ... saying that you are putting your life (or your health) in 
God's hands as you start on your journey.

Dear All,

Is there a "De-Assembler" out there that will de-assemble Blitz
generated code AND give you "symbols" ie labels in the code relating
to the Blitz Source so that you can tell which bit of the code relates
to which statement and so on. This obviously needs Blitz to have put
such information in the generated code...

So.. what is available?

    Thanks,

Use it like this :

WindowToFront_ (Peek.l(Addr Window(0)))

This will bring window #0 to the front.

Subject: What's up with Blitz?

	I recently decided to investigate changing from programming
in AMOS to Blitz Basic, but I was suprised by the lack of support for
a language which I've heard many people praise.  For example, I was
looking through several Amiga magazines (both Australian and British)
and I couldn't find anyone selling Blitz, yet they all stocked languages
like AMOS, HiSoft Basic 2, DICE, Devpac etc...  Also, none of the magazines
had tutorials on Blitz (which I remember seeing in the past).  So what's
going on?  Is Blitz on the way out?  Is it still in distribution?  I was
seriously considering buying Blitz2 as I think AMOS is too slow and lacks
many features which Blitz2 supports (like structures etc...), but now I'm
not so sure.  I don't want to commit to a language which is no longer
supported.  There is a LOT of support for AMOS on the internet, which
is a good thing and I would have liked to see a similar thing with Blitz.
I hope that I am incorrect in assuming that Blitz is no longer supported
because I could not find it being sold in magazines. 
 
	Any information on this matter would be appreciated.

w.l=EventWindow:address.l=Addr Window(w)
I'm just guessing off the top of my head, but I think that's how I would try
this first. Window's $40000 IDCMP should be addded also. But that will only
work with windows created by Blitz.

I guess I can't be much help here. By the way, is there a way for Blitz2 to
control other things on a public screen? I mean let's say we wanted to
launch and then close another program from within Blitz program.

Launching would be easy using the execute_ command, but what about shutting
it down later?

This does not appear to occur. When I read the serial port a second time I get the same line as before but with
the first character removed ! That is Hello becomes ello then llo etc. This may becaused by the fact that I have
the read serial command in my main program loop:

this is messy but I can see no alternative :(

CreateMsgPort    sounds like Arexx, I'll give it a try when I have some spare time, these bastards at Uni expect

Subject: Triton conversion available for BB2!

Since the latest release of Triton, there is a rude Blitz2 conversion
implemented.

I will finish it completely until the end of the year, a fully useable
conversion should be included in the next release, which will be the
1.4

With this package you will be able to create easily fontsensitive, fully
user-configurable and nice looking GUIs for your programs, a little
bit MUI-alike but not as big in size.

The actual releas 1.3 you can find in the AmiNet/dev/gui

        triton13usr.lha        (216157 b)
        triton13dev.lha        (300620 b)


If you want to know how far the latest bb2-conversion is, eMail me and
I send you a little archive, right now without docs.

I mustn't forget to send a big "thank you very, very much" to Rupert
"HelpApp" Henson, whithout his help the conversion couldn't been
finished in this short time.

C'mon people, give Triton a try - it's easy, small and handy!!

OK, there seems to be still a couple of people alive on this list <G>

If you want to beta test my lib, you should at least have AmiTCP installed
on your system, otherwise it will just sit there staring at you.
You will also need to know what to do with the functions as (at the mo)
there is minimal docs.

For more infomation on what the functions do, get the AmiTCP API archive.

I'll be posting a uuencode msg with the lib as soon as I write some
"minimal docs" <G>

Subject: blitz last version

Help! One of my co-workers bought a copy of Blitz Basic from Safe Harbor
last week, received it yesterday. He has taken a weeks vacation intending
to get his Star Trek compendium finally done.
 
Unforch, the Safe Harbor shipped version is 1.4! On an 030, crash city of
course if you attempt any in-memory compiles.
 
In fairness to Safe Harbor, they are attempting to get a copy from the
last customer whom they KNOW got the current version.  However, that will
take till mid-week, and won't have the new docs with it until they get a
full replacement from Australia.
 
Jimi expected to get 1.9+, paid for it but got 1.4 cause the Harbor had picked
up the remaining stock from another dealer who assured them "Its all the
latest stuff".  Yeah, sure it was.  8:(  In the meantime back at the ranch,
Jimi is learning ever newer ways to twiddle his thumbs.
 
I don't even know how many disks it is, but if somebody would take the time
to DMS 'em, then uuencode, and mail to me, we'ed sure be gratefull. Or better
yet, since I'm out here in West (by God) Virginia on a 2400 baud line,
maybe give me a landline # so's I can call you and get it at full v32.bis
speeds. That obviously isn't an option for international calls.
 
Jimi tells me he might only need the programs disk and the libraries disk.
Can anyone help?
 
Cheers, Gene

If another library needs to access your libraries unique data structure 
or global variable type base or something then your lib can return a 
pointer from it;s initialisation that other library commands can request 
similar to DosBase or somesuch.

They don't do anything. Originally we were hoping to have default load 
save etc. for every object. The use command can be linked to a command 
such as usepalette but I think it's a bad idea. If you have an object 
that goes with a library best to set aside a token for it's name ala 
dumtoke and if need be support the standard Use terminology so your 
commands can operate on that particular used object.

Hmmm, I think acommand can be used both as a command and a function, big 
problem with this is I think you can't tell how user used it so best for 
just succeed or fail type functions which if the user is lazy can simply 
be used as statements. The ustatement and ufunction I have never used, 
maybe something to do with user being able to dictate the type such as 
peek.w peek.q peek.l?


On another note, I haven't had a chance to mess with your socket library. 
If we were able to support slip and ppp net connections with our own code 
ie send and receive IP packets quite happily with dialup connections, 
what sort of TCP support is required to replace amitcp. I personally 
would like to replace AmiTCP with pure shareware version and know it was 
as fast as it could be.

Oh one more question, does anyone know or can find some docs on perorming 
CRC checking (cyclic redundancy checksums?)...

FTP to x2ftp.oulu.fi and go into the DOS programming stuff. I forget exactly
where I found it, I think under "docs" or something... I really can't recall
the directory structure at all as I've only poked around a few times.

There are some articles and demo code in there.

BTW North Americans, there is a mirror of x2ftp.oulu.fi (a site mainly for
game development, which has a blitz subdir) at ftp.infomagic.com somewhere in
pub/mirrors.

Well, they say that everyone in the world has an identical twin. Here's mine.
I almost checked to see who wrote this to make sure I didn't write it in one
of my half-dazed no-sleep-for-a-couple-days marathons.

I'm in the exact same situation, and I thought that I was finally going to be
saved by Richard Elmore, but alas, it does not appear that it will be...

After nearly two years of letter writing and phone calls,
I got in contact with him, and even sent him additional money beyond my
original BUM subscription dollars. He said he'd get my update out real soon,
and I was a happy boy.

And the weeks went by.

So I sent him a letter asking if he'd gotten the money.

And the weeks went by.

So I sent him a letter to find out if he was still alive.

And finally, his typing finger had some sort of post-mortem nervous/gaseous
spasm, and he sent a response saying that he was sorry he didn't get back,
he'd been overworked at his day job and had gotten behind, and that he would
send it out "right away". Evidently, "right away" is a quaint colloquialism
in his regional speech which means about the same as "when hell freezes over"
does in ours. He must still be wiped from that day job, because the weeks have
once again gone by.

Now, from my experience as a professional programmer, I happen to know that
you can mail something between any two points in North America in 6 days, 7
tops -- i.e. not several weeks, but _a_ _single_ week, unless you're talking
about some remote northern icecap.

I've found myself swamped at work before, so I can understand his position,
but really, is there some superhuman factor involved in stuffing an envelope
and licking stamps that requires months to complete? Perhaps Acid requires that
every package have a complicated ritual blessing based upon the lunar cycle 
performed upon it before it can be sent. If so, it doesn't appear to be working
as I still haven't gotten anything.

In fact, I was about to give him another electronic pulse-feel when I read the
message above. I doubt he'll read this for a while though; I notice messages
sent to the list from him have all but disappeared as of late.

Believe it or not, I don't think he's a terrible guy, just a bit lax. But I
tend to get a bit pissed after waiting around for two years for a company to
deliver its product. I can even say that I like him. And he's certainly done a
lot for Blitz. I just wish he'd do what he promised (and was paid) to do for
me.

Subject: Blitz library utility


I just uploaded blitzlibman.lha to x2ftp.oulu.fi .
It's somesort of library utility from Richard Elmore.
I accidentaly deleted the bounced message in which it
came (it was bounced by Majordomo because it was too long),
and don't remember anything more - except it should be quite
selfexplanatory. Oh well.

Richard, did you get my messages ? It's hard to keep a track
of possible errormessages when I receive a mountain/day of them...

About BUMs and Blitz's support: I mailed to Mark Sibly and he
stated that Simon has been busy doing conversion of Skidmarks
for Sega(?). Simon, I don't think it would hurt sales
of BlitzABC, if you handed some of the stuff you have gathered
and would let someone who has time to make BUM8 & release it
as free update - actually, I think that could keep some
of these people within Amiga platform and as possible buyers...
(3D-libraries alone will sell BlitzABC quite good - if they
are so good I like to believe).

Hi,

I am pleased to announce that Version 5 of RIBlitzLibs is due
for imminent release.

There are approx. 6 new libraries plus around 50 new commands.

The libraries are complete, uncrippled. Work is now being done
on the documentation.

Look out for it soon on aminet:  pub/dev/basic/RIBlitzLibsV5.lha

Steve.

To the incoming directory. It will take some time, before it will
be moved to the /pub/amiga/prog/blitz dir, I'm afraid. Should

Subject: TRITON support for TRITON finished

Stefan Zeiger, the programmer of TRITON, told me that the next release
will be on the CD Rom "Meeting Pearls 3" and the deadline will be
around this weekend (12-13. august). So I hurried up and finished the
bb2 conversion *IN MY HOLIDAYS* !!! Just for all you blizzies :)

So I am very proud to announce, that with the great help of Rupert
"HelpApp" Henson, I finished the TRITON conversion to BlitzBasic2. You
are now all able to:

        * create your own, nice looking GUI easy and fast
        * have font sensitive/adaptive and user definable GUIs
          (like MUI, only smaller and easier :))
        * have automatic shortcut and hotkey handling for all menus
          and buttons
        * work with an object oriented system in your procedural
          basic!
        * and much more.

You can get it by three ways:

    1. Wait until the "Meeting Pearls 3" CD Rom is avaiable in a
       shop near your city.

    2. look in your favourite Blitz-FTP-Server in
       x2ftp.oulu.fi/pub/amiga/prog/blitz
       [but give me a week to put it there!]

    3. mail me directly if you really can't get it otherwise.

I really would appreciate it if you'd contact me when you're using
TRITON in your programs. I am open to criticism, ideas, help and
surely will be able to solve your problems.

At the mo the library's 99% up and running with *ALL* the useful
functions. I've completely changed the way it works now and have used my
own token for the FDSET so that waiting for stuff at sockets are quicker
to set up.

To replace AmiTCP would require a lot of work and I don't think many
people are willing to sacrifice their time for such a big project.
I don't think anyone's even written a dial-up program for AmiTCP yet...

Oh shit,

It's August, bloody August. I can't sleep. I'm sitting here
shivering (winter down here no heat wave in sight) in front
of my computer wondering what the hell is going on.

For one, I haven't has a single cigarette for 8 days. A pack
of PallMall filter a day no longer. Why on earth am I doing
this?

Secondly, there are a load of pissed off people out there
and I'm losing sleep over them. Blitz must survive. I AGREE.
I am not giving up on it. We're just finishing the first
ever Sega Megadrive game written in Blitz. I'm kind of pleased
with it, Sibs has given us a wonderful tool. The latest version
of FigZ has arrived which I have payed for so as to include
in BUM8. The wonderful RI debugger has been payed for to be
included in BUM8. Mark has fixed every known parameter passing
bug in v1.95 which is ready for BUM8, and shit there were a
few suprises which made me feel guilty as hell that Blitz was
ever considered a commercial viability (as opposed to liability).

Well, now Blitz is bug free, it has a cheesy online help system
and this weeked it is getting squashed into 880K and an 8 page
magazine. I will be logging on Saturday night, any last minute
contributions (small cool bits of code) that are emailed to me
get BUM8 emailed back to them.

And if I don't finish it? Well I'm not logging back onto the
net after Saturday until it's done that's for sure.

So if you want it emailed to you as soon as it is done, email
me a file under 4K for the groovy_code drawer and if it gets
included you'll get BUM8 even before Guildhall does...

Interesting idea - maybe you could use INCBIN and later a pointer, but I have
not tried out that... if you have BUM7, there's some info about including
data into your own programs. Sorry that I can not give you a better advise,
maybe someone else has more to say :)

A couple of months ago, I sent off my Blitz Basic II registration card to
the address printed on it - Acid Software, PO Box 3172, Hampstead, London,
NW3, England. Then, one month or so later, I got the very same card back with
a 'return to sender' sticker applied to it, on which the box 'gone away' was
ticked.

Therefore, I wonder if someone knows which address I should send my
registration card to. I also wonder what to do to subscribe to BUM - and as I
live in Norway, if that fact would influence the price.

It's still there (alt.sys.amiga.blitz), but for some reason
people have had a lot of problems receiving it.

If you mean the plan to start comp.sys.amiga.blitz -
this has been on halt, because 1) I was lazy 2) when
I finally got accurate info last month from the mailing list, which
should help users in these questions, there wasn't enough 
messages/day that I could have written the RFD (request
for discussion) with good arquments. We are close to
"critical mass" so that we could success - but we
definitely don't have >30 messages/day or 1000 subscribers,
which is considered to be enough in the recommedations.

But I just today came up with an idea, which could solve 
the problem for ALL Amiga programmers, who would see
the messages of some list occasionally, but don't want
to subscribe the list: let's write RFD for 
comp.sys.amiga.programmer.m-l or something like that, which
would be place to forward all programming related mailing-lists'
post. The listservers would add something before the 
original subject (A: for Amos, B: for Blitz E: for E...), 
so that people could read only the messages of which they 
are most interested - but they would see from subjects, 
what is happening with other languages.

I don't know yet, maybe it's silly idea, and we should instead
try to start many separate newsgroups at once - this could
be easier in fact than just advocating for Blitz group...

I disagree with that. You shouldn't put all programming mailinglists
again into a newsgroup. If someone is interested in the language he
will add himself to the mailing list but not for reading everything a
second time in a newsgroup.

btw, this would have the affect that the people instead of adding
themselves to the lists will only write through the newsgroup.

I think the way it is is ok. and, why not use some existing basic
newsgroup like

            COMP.SYS.BASIC

Yep, it's gone awfully quiet all of a sudden.  Probably due to the

This wouldn't be the best idea for the people who want to read off-line.

Sounds silly <G>

I bet once Blitz 3 (or whatever it's called) turns up, it'll start hotting

 I'm having a problem with the BlockScroll command, and just wondering if anyelse

 I seem to be able to scroll on all axis 'cept one. Here's the different ones
I use...

BlockScroll 16,1,288,192,0,1 \ These are for the X-axis. 
BlockScroll 0,1,288,192,16,1 / They work.

BlockScroll 16,32,288,160,16,16 \ This one works
BlockScroll 16,0,288,160,16,16  / This doesn't.

 It doesn't matter how I change the Y values, it always scrolls one line all the
way down the screen. Any suggestions?

I think that's a great idea - people using other lanugages could see
the benefits of Blitz;) and nobody could say we are narrow-minded.
It would be interesting to hear how things are done in other languages
(for example C, which I want to learn).

oldPriority.b = SetTaskPri_( FindTask_(0), newPriority.b )

SetTaskPri takes a task address and the new priority as arguments.
Calling FindTask with a parameter of 0 finds the address of the current (i.e.
your program's) task. You could put the results of FindTask in a long-sized
variable once and then use the variable instead of the call if you plan to 
change the task priority more than once.

Note that the priority is a signed byte (-128 to +127) but you should avoid
setting it to higher than +5 (or lower than -5 ) or so unless you know what 
you're doing.

Setting it to very high values will cause the system to crash and/or lockup as
vital system routines (such as the input.device) are effectively locked out.

Subject: How to create an own task?

I hope that someone can help me:

 For my current project I need a clock, which advances not in real
time but in game time (e.g. an hour in the game are 15 minutes in
reality).

I thought about putting the clock-code into an interrupt but that
doesn't seem to me to be ok - the rest of my program is system
compliant (not in blitz-mode!) and the code takes longer than a 50ths
second...

so I thought about creating an own task who signals every minute or so
- but I just didn't get it how to do that.

I tried to understand how the RKMs tell it - perhaps that will take a
little time :) and I hope someone other can explain it to me easier.

Or is there a way in BB2 which I didn't see?

thanx for your help!

PS: I am very sorry, but Stefan Zeiger still didn't put his TRITON 1.4
on AmiNet. As I don't have direct ftp access myself, you still have to
wait - until next week, hopefully :)

The i-glasses does split a interlaced picture in the even and odd lines
for every eye (don't ask me, which will be for which eye, but this
is a minor problem... :). The resolution of the glasses is Lores-like.
Simon knows that. I have mailed them that 10 days ago.
But i don't know, if they'll include that now on his 3D-lib.

I think for the near future the follow things are more important:
CHEAP Amigas (also bundles).
CD-ROM's for every Amiga.
No more Amigas with no Fastram (2 Megs will give alot of speed
for a A1200) and no Harddisk (40 Megs would be still alot for a
Amiga).
The A1200 should have a HD-floppy like the A4000 has.

...

	I don't think it's actually GTSetAttrs fault...
Try putting the GTScroller command at the start of the GT list, ie give
it an id of 0 and placing it near the top of the subroutine.

I've had the same trouble with sliders, so I think it has to do with the
order that Blitz sets up the GTlist, and having graphical gadgets
(scrollers etc.) at the start of the list.  But anyway that should solve
your problem. Let me know if it doesn't. (cause I've tried your code
segment and have got it to work :')

Clever and simple solution. I guess it's possible to make Amiga
to show every second line from another screen/bitmap and every
second from another (and this would do it, wouldn't it ?) with
interrupts ? Ofcourse the speed will be a problem, as everything
must be calculated twice (some hacks may help here a bit).

Yes, maybe, but I don't think we can make any libs for
these... 8) except that for cd-rom there should be better support.
I guess the bundles which are described in The Amiga Web's pages
are what we will see before Christmas.

Erm... i'm not sure, if i understand you correctly, but i don't think,
this would work...
"interlaced" doesn't work this way. But i'm sure, it is possible
in a similar way with the famous chopper. :)
Does someone else have a simple solution for that?

> interrupts ? Ofcourse the speed will be a problem, as everything

I think the greatest problem is to DRAW every picture twice. The
twice-calculating can't be too hard because in that moment, any
rotations, moving and animation of an 3D-object is done. So you
must simply calculate the scene in two "positions" along the
horizontal-axis,which will give you the distance between the eyes
for 3D.

Yes, I have programmed some demos for red/blue glasses (best
of them with AMOS long time ago) and know how it works. But 
I don't know, how the fact that you only need to calculate
"little different" scene can make the calculation any easier.
Ofcourse the drawing takes time too.

But if you use TRITON you don't need GadTools anymore, no more caring
about fontsensitivity, screens, fonts, and all this ugly stuff. You
just create easily your window with buttons, sliders,
progress-indicators, checkmarks, listviews of any kind, etc... and you
just take care of the incoming messages - react on selected buttons
etc.

Resizing the window or anything else concerning the layout is no more
your task and/or problem - TRITON will do it for you.

btw: the thing is: with TRITON, changing attributes will work *always*
in what order the buttons etc. are ;)

Try x2ftp.oulu.fi for a start. Acid stuff is copyrighted, but
many other libs are free. They don't prevent you from having

I guess they have just now got it to a form, which is affordable (?)

OK guys I've cleaned up the library a bit and it's now in a fully usable
state.  There's still no real docs to it except for the stuff in the
source so have fun and look at the supplied chat server for examples of
use.

I hope to get a full release vers out as soon as I get enuf thumbs up
and maybe a permanent libnum.

Anyway, look forward to receiving BUM8 soon...

 Hey, My mail crashed and I lost your orig. post. If you'd care to re-

thing I've done with gadgets was add a front end to the Protracker library
I'd revamped for Blitz2.

Its okay. It was a weird bug caused by the order of my gtlist.

Yup, it's done and is being tested over the next few days. Contributors 
expect email by Friday, others expect it in your mailbox within 3 weeks 
depending on location etc.

 
1. Stereo glasses, the I-glasses development documentation is available
   on their home page in Word format. For Blitz all you would need to do
   is cludge a bitmap structure to effectively assign different bitmaps for
   odd and even lines, anyone with glasses email me and I'll send you the
   code. The big thing with these glasses is the tracking stuff and I don't
   know if Escom plan on the more expensive variety with tracking included.
   I personally think its a waste of time, as soon as you have tracking
   you need to give the player other cues such as force etc. for it to be
   convincing. There are drivers available for FarkForces and Descent so
   I'm probably talking through a hole in my head as I haven't experienced
   them.

2. Old versions of Blitz crashing on A1200, from what I can remember the 
   problem is with the way Blitz opens its CLI, either use NOCLI which is
   why Insectoids works or remove any shell enhancers you are running that
   may be incompatible with Blitz...

3. GTSetAttrs problem: I have stated over and over again that Gadtools need
   id of 50 and bigger as the dickhead who wrote the version in 2.0 uses 
   user id's lower than this in GTlists etc. If this doesn;t fix it then
   the latest version from RI probably does, I have put the .obj in latest
   blitzlibs but don't have source code (RI-please send) so can't say if
   gtsetattrs ability to reference a gadget from the id passes is better
   worse...

4. Acid publishing... Giles Hunter of GuildhallLeisure has been in NZ 
   this weekend. After pointing out I should stop trying to do 300 things
   at once we have a new strategy for operating the Acid label and getting
   product finished and available. More news soon but the good news is
   people won't have to rely on Acid NZ to get things done (BUM will
   be regular and edited in UK for instance) and opportunities of BB
   users to get things published will be increased.

Stay tuned...

Here's a couple of solutions...

First of all, there is nothing wrong with using interrupts in Amiga mode. The
Amiga provides an interrupt server chain for the vertical blank interrupt,
which in English means that it's fine to have a vblank interrupt as long as
you follow a couple of rules. Blitz happens to do this for you.

So for example, you can slap a simple counter mechanism in a SetInt like this:

DefType .w
DispHz=50 : If NTSC then DispHz=60
frames=0 : realSecs = 0 : gameMins = 0 : gameHours = 0

SetInt 5
  frames+1
  if frames = DispHz
    frames=0 : realSecs+1
    if realSecs = (60*4)  ; 60*4 since 4 real min = 1 game min
      realSecs+1 : gameMins+1
      if gameMins = 60
        gameMins=0 : gameHours + 1
      EndIf
    EndIf
  EndIf
End SetInt

The above is easily extendable for days, etc. as well.  The best part is
that once it's set up you don't have to think about it.  Just use the
gameMins and gameHours variables whenever you need the time.  The only
potential problem is with a line like this:

Print str$(gameHours)+":"+str$(gameMins)

Suppose the time is 2:59, and it changes to 3:00 exactly  when the ":" is being
printed. What you'll get is a jump from "2:59" to "2:00" and then (one frame
later) "3:00". (This won't be a big deal if you are redrawing your frames
a lot and are not too concerned (it would almost never happen), but see below.)

The solution here is to move everything higher than "realSecs" outside the
vblank routine, into a procedure that is called with "realSecs" as an
argument. This will give you a "locked" value for the seconds at the time the
procedure is called.

However, this makes a new problem: several seconds may pass between calls, so
the "if realSecs=60" bit won't work anymore. If you know that no more than one
extra minute will pass (i.e. the time between calls is less than 2 min.) you
can use:

if realSecs>= (60*4)
  gameMins + 1: realSecs = realSecs-(60*4) ; or realSecs mod (60*4)
  etc.

If it might be more, you can use a loop similar to above or use division and
modula arithmetic.

Anyway, you can also use the built in time functions. Store the time when you
start into a variable, then when you want game time, call a procedure that
compares current time with original time, and convert.

Either of these is certainly much less drastic and resource intensive than
launching another task. I hope this solves your problem, and as I said there's
nothing wrong with using vblank routines in Amiga mode.

Hope this helps more than it hurts!

That exactly is the problem: I want this routine "work alone". But I
don't want to put it via

SetInt x : clock{} : End SetInt

in any interrupt but instead doing this system friendly by creating an
own task.

AFAIR a posting by Dr. Peter Kittel (AT), you don't have to calculate
anything more ... the glasses are put on the composite video output of
your amiga and it splits the picture by itself. the resolution should
be smth. like lores interlace. so just code your games as you did all

Sounds nice. Can I change the position of, say, a slider from within my
code? Thats why I'm using gtsetattrs, to make my slider follow keyboard
shortcuts.

I have noticed that too, but I still think that we will piss off
some people, if there will appear 10-30 messages/day conserning
Blitz in comp.sys.amiga.programmer.

That's why I have now come up with a solution, which could
be best for all: comp.sys.amiga.programmer.basic or just
comp.sys.amiga.basic (hmm, the first is a bit long & the
other may just be recognized to be for original Amiga basic -
which one do you folks prefer ?)

This could be the best solution, because:
1) we don't want to piss off all C, E & assembler programmers
in comp.sys.amiga.programmer
2) RFD for comp.sys.amiga.blitz could get many people vouting
against it, as they would think it's too spesific and then
there should be group for each and every language available.
Basic group on the other hand could get'yes' votes from
all programmers (other than basic programmers too).
3) People using other basics would see that Blitz beats
those hands down and could change the language.
4) I don't think linking this list to any of existing
groups is a good idea (again, someone will be angry).
But linking it to the basic group shouldn't be
a problem.

If (and when) Blitz becomes dominant (if it isn't yet)
basic for Amiga, and maybe even dominant dev. package for
Amiga, nothing would prevent starting comp.sys.amiga.blitz.

I will write the RFD today and mail it to this list today
or tomorrow. After that I would like to see as many comments
about it as possible (I usually get 1-5 comments, when I ask
something like this). This is important, as it's important
that RFD is well done - and as you remember, enliungsh verry
secondery langauge to me.

Btw, this doesn't mean, that I would stop blitz-list.
As far as there are people, who will use it, it will
stay. I will look for a chance to make a filter with
"some brain" in it to collect messages concerning blitz
to the list.

I don't know exactly, maybe someone has made a collection

I will look it closer in the evening. Now I'll have to do

either you use the blitz gadgets with

or you use GadTools (avaiable at least in BB2 v1.9)

 GTCycle list,id,x,y,w,h,"This|Cycles|Better",flags,options

Yes, TRITON is freely distributable like ReqTools and MUI.

Mmm... I didn't try that and I would say you can't. But what is the
sense of a Cycle gadget that walks through the window moved by e.g.
the cursor keys?? Or did you mean to change the visible cycle entry??
This is no problem and easily to change!

That's the clou. The latest release of TRITON, numbered 1.4, is not
yet avaiable on aminet. You can get TRITON 1.3 there in dev/gui -
remember, you need this to FDConvert the library!

In TRITON 1.3, the Blitz2 package wasn't complete - now it is. Due to
the fact that I don't have direct ftp access to "put" a file on a ftp
server, I couldn't put the blitz package alone on x2ftp.oulu.fi.

I'd be grateful if someone could do that for me! You will get a free
example of the triton blitz package :-)

Subject: draft of Request For Discussion

This is the draft of RFD, which I promised.
Do _not_ forward this to any public forum.
I will start discussion in comp.sys.amiga.programmer myself -
this is to "soften the ground" for RFD.

Please send me all suggestions for changes.
It's quite welldefined, what should be in these RFDs and
I have tried to follow the guidelines.

If someone has better suggestion for name, please tell that too.
comp.lang.basic.amiga could be possible, but as almost all
other amiga groups start "comp.amiga", this could be confusing.

------------start of rfd----------

                     REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION (RFD)
           unmoderated group comp.sys.amiga.programmer.basic

Summary:             Discussion of basic languages for Amiga computers
Proposed by:         Mikko Makela  <mmmakela@cc.helsinki.fi>

This a formal Request For Discussion concerning the creation of a new
unmoderated newsgroup called comp.sys.amiga.programmer.basic.  
This is not a Call For Votes (CFV).  Please do not vote at this time.  

PROPOSED GROUPS: 

comp.sys.amiga.programmer.basic

RATIONALE:

There currently exists only one newsgroup for Amiga programmers,
named comp.sys.amiga.programmer. This group though has traditionally
been mainly used by programmers of other than basic languages, like
C, E and assembler. This means that many people would find it very
irritating, if suddenly comp.sys.amiga.programmer would be filled
with messages concerning basic languages. There exists atleast
two very active mailinglists for basic languages, so linking these
lists to comp.sys.amiga.programmer would surely irritate "old users"
of the group. 

On the other hand, separation of all languages to their own specific
group would seem to be too much and the volume of most of these 
groups would be low.

CHARTER:

comp.sys.amiga.basic is meant for all basic languages which
are available for Amiga range of computers. Also all mailing-
lists, which specify to same area, would be allowed to link
their messages with the group.   

PROCEDURE:

A Call for Votes will be posted within 7-10 days of this posting, on
approval of the news.announce.newsgroups moderator.  This vote will
be administered by a neutral third party and will follow the rules
outlined in the Newsgroup Creation Guidelines.

DISTRIBUTION:

This RFD is being posted to the following newsgroups: 

comp.sys.amiga.programmer
comp.sys.amiga.misc

Discussion of this RFD will take place on news.groups.  All
follow-up posts should be made to news.groups.

Subject: IncLibrary

 This really should go to Richard Elmore, but I can't find his address, so I'm
sure this will reach him just the same. ;) (maybe someone else can help too?)

 After going in and using the include-tool, I've been trying (and trying..) to
get the IncSound command to work correctly. In the compile options, I set the
number of sounds to 20.

This is what I tried to do:

if IncSound(0,?sfx1)=false then end
if IncSound(1,?sfx2)=false then end  <--- Problem line

 It seems that any number above 0 for a sound number gives back the error
"Value out of maximum range." Is there something I missed?

ok, I got another problem. Since my program can be opened on any
screenmode, I always have to check which screenmode is used. That
would be not as complicated if I weren't using TRITON - because here
the user selects the screen not in the program but in an separate
prefs editor (like MUI).

So I thought about just using another interrupt. I thought about the
CIA ports interrupt (SetInt 3) or the software interrupt (SetInt 2).
Do you know, how I have to count then? How much per minute do these
interrupts come? every 50ths or only every second?

thx for help,

Subject: Triton 1.4 released (fwd)

so, for all you folks. you can get the newest triton incl. the
complete blitz basic 2 package on aminet or, if you have an older
triton already, get the blitz package stand alone on x2ftp.oulu.fi


|-------------------- text of forwarded message follows --------------------|

found in ftp.uni-paderborn.de/aminet/new and should be available at all
AmiNet sites soon.

        Changes since release 1.3:

*****************************************************************************

    Changes for Triton users and developers:
    ========================================

    triton.library asked for diskfont.library v37 which caused problems on
      OS2.0 systems. This is fixed now. triton.library asks for v36 only.
    QuickHelp windows accidentally appeared always on the default public
      screen instead of the screen of their parent window.
    Some gadgets could accidentally be activated by <Return> although they
      were not intended to react on that shortcut.
    Double (string gadget like) borders were not drawn correctly in 'thick'
      mode with OS versions below 3.0.

    Changes for Triton developers only:
    ===================================

    Fixed flaws in the autodoc class documentation.
    Cycle gadgets in MX mode didn't set all necessary IDCMP flags which
      caused MX gadgets not to work properly in some cases.
    Updated BlitzBasic support packet.
    Changing of class_Listview.TRLV_Top was not possible and caused the
      Listview to become disabled when you tried it.

    Internal changes:
    ================

    Added some major new features to the OOP kernel. The message dispatching
      is now a bit faster with even more speed increase expected for the
      next release.

Subject: Triton

 I downloaded all the Triton stuff, wanting to check it out for myself. 
There is a problem with this though, and I thought I'd let everyone know 
about first. (It isn't a big problem, but it did annoy me.)

 Before you use the FDConvert program, make sure you have library #1 free 
to use, or you'll create a conflict between your libraries. (You may use
Richard Elmore's excellent Library Manager to do this with.)

 Ok.. Now on to the bit I'm annoyed about. I wanted to check out the demo
programs, just to see how well blitz interacts with it.. But, if you're 
like me, and you have to use a different library number, they won't work
because they aren't saved in ascii, and blitz won't know about the tokens.

 So, if someone would like to let the author know that he really should save
off those example programs in ASCII format in future releases.

Steve

with FDConvert triton_lib.fd just throws up some error message

    Could someone *please* offer soothing words of advice on how

From: Ben Wyatt <bwyatt@paston.co.uk>
To: blitz-list@helsinki.fi
Subject: Game creator questionnaire

Hello all

I'm not subscribed to this list, but I want some advice/ideas for my current
project, a point and click adventure creator (PACAC :) ). It will hopefully
be able to make graphic adventures equivilant to Monkey Island, Beneath
the Steel Sky and Relics of Deldroneye.

If you're interested in such a program, please fill in the following
questionnaire and return it to me at bwyatt@paston.co.uk. Thanks. You
may also be interested in some demo pics and furthur info on aminet
(dev/misc, PACAC.lha).

1. Would you prefer that there is no programming at all, even if they are
   very simple commands?

2. PACAC will be able to control many characters, as they wander about from
   screen to screen, doing jobs, talking to people, getting distracted, etc.
   (like in Beneath the Steel Sky)
   Do you think that the script for these characters, should be programmed
   or built up using the mouse (takes longer)?

3. At the moment, the system uses variables to hold the current state of the
   game. These are called Var1, Var2, e.t.c. Would you prefer to have
   real names (such as "animstate", "count", "timesmet", etc) instead of the
   above? This would mean quite a bit more programming for me. Otherwise, a
   list of all the var numbers could come up, with their meanings beside
   them and the final game would also execute faster.

4. Complex conversations will be possible, with characters taking actions
   simply because of something you said, and the possibility of giving your
   character a good or bad reputation. To do this, commands will have to be
   built into the conversation. For example, "*T{1} How are you? *T{2}
   I'm very well, *N how about you? *T{1} *C{*O1 I'm great
   *O2 Life stinks and so do you} *T{2} *1{ [IncVar1] That's nice} *2{
   [DecVar1] I know}"

   In the above conversation between you *T(1) and another character *T(2),
   this happened:
         You:How are you?
   Character:I'm very well, (on next line) how about you?
         You:(A choice between "I'm great" and "Life stinks and so do you")
   Character:(If you said "I'm great", then say "That's nice" and
             increase Var1. If you said "Life stinks and so do you", then
              say "I know" and decrease Var1)

   Do you think this is too complicated? If so, can you suggest a better
   approach? Or should I cut it out all together?

5. Music can be played on certain screens, or when a character comes on to
   screen (like in Monkey Island 2). Do you think that PACAC should use
   Tracker files, or its own music editor that isn't compatible with
   anything?

6. The interface will be quite like the one on Beneath the Steel Sky. It
   goes on the principle that there are only two things you can do with an
   object. These being, look at it and use it.
   Anyway, do you prefer this method to the standard method using icons
   along the bottom (Look at, Open, Use, Push, etc) for PACAC games to use?

7. Should the data files be encrypted, so that only the programmer can edit
   them? Or should the files be available to everyone, to look at/change?

8. Should I split the system into three separate parts, Screen Editor,
   Character Editor, Game Editor? Or should I try to keep it all in one
   editor?

9. In the script language that I have created, commands can get quite long.
   For example:

   Character Walk To / Char Walk To

   Animation On / Anim On

   ...and so on, do you prefer the shorter versions, although they make
   it slightly less "readable"?

10.Do you want the game to be controlled by one script, or would you
   prefer that each object in the game contains its own piece of
   programming. For example, imagine this in a game:

      There is a door, that can only be opened if the player turns two
      switches to "on". The two switches start in the "off" position.

      For this example,
         Var1=switch 1 state (0=off, 1=on)
         Var2=switch 2 state
         Var3=both the switches state (2=both on)
         Exit 1 is the door.
         Comments are shown in brackets.

      Switch 1:
         If Use and Var1=0 Then IncVar1 : IncVar3 : Animate (using switch)
         If Use and Var1=1 Then DecVar1 : DecVar3 : Animate

      Switch 2:
         If Use and Var2=0 Then IncVar2 : IncVar3 : Animate
         If Use and Var2=1 Then IncVar2 : DecVar3 : Animate

      Door:
         If Use and Var3=2 Then Animate (door opening) : Exit On 1

   Otherwise. if it were a single script:

      Object 1 is switch 1
      Object 2 is switch 2
      Object 3 is the door

         If Use1 and Var1=0 Then IncVar1 : IncVar3 : Animate (using switch)
         If Use1 and Var1=1 Then DecVar1 : DecVar3 : Animate

         If Use2 and Var2=0 Then IncVar2 : IncVar3 : Animate
         If Use2 and Var2=1 Then IncVar2 : DecVar3 : Animate

         If Use3 and Var3=2 Then Animate (door opening) : Exit On 1

      Notice that the only difference is that the object number is
      specified. Also, this code would be surrounded by the rest of the
      code for the current screen/game.

   Which method do you prefer?

11.PACAC will support some kind of Animation. Which would you prefer this
   to be; Anim5 (Dpaint) or er... PACAC type :)

   PACAC type animations would have extra things which Anim5 doesn't have,
   eg. Fading, sound effects, the outlined text, etc. but it would
   probably be harder to make your animations. Maybe it could import
   Anim5 animations and allow you to edit them. Anyway, which do you
   prefer?

12.Are there any particular tools you'd like to have, when making your
   adventure? e.g. Screen renderer, character generator, e.t.c.

13.Any comments/ideas/suggestions you wish to add or you'd like to
   answer furthur questionnaires, then here's the place for it:

Thanks for your time and help. :)

This program was written by me in order to convert some games that i had written in AMOS(crap!) and see how fast would they run with BlitzII.. I sent a version (1.0b) to Greece's computer mag PIXEL. The liked it and they contacted with me. So, i sent them v1.2. The popularity of the program was big enough to persuade me to write the current version. It was completely rewritten, with my MPInterface and it is tottaly bug-free.... Please, mail me for more info. I will upload the demo version to the official BlitzII ftp site, if i 'ill make to connectt there, that is...
If you want i can uuencode the .lha file and sent it to the list...
Not that big(only 350K :-)

Blitz saves (atleast in my version, 1.9) the compiler options settings
along the program, so just save the program after you have changed
the settings.

 I could be wrong, but I think that Mark Sibly used BLITZ2 to create a 3D 
 modeling program which he then used to design all his game objects.

 He also used BLITZ2 to create other "utilites" which he used to help
 design GLOOM.

 However, I don't think "Guardian" or "Gloom" were coded in BLITZ.

 I may be wrong on this, but I don't think so.

Hi there.

I've just started out with Blitz Basic, and I've encountered some small
problems. I'm making a vote-poller program wich is using GTStrings and
GTListviews. This works fine. But how do I read the text that has been
entered into the GTStrings and store them in a file?

I'm also having some trouble with an About-requester that's supposed to
be in the prog. Currently, I have this code (only part of it ofcourse):

#MOUSEMOVE=$10:#INTUITICKS=$400000
  AddIDCMP #MOUSEMOVE+#INTUITICKS

.main
  Repeat
    ev.l=WaitEvent
    If ev<>#MOUSEMOVE AND ev<>#INTUITICKS Then Gosub addevent
  Until ev=$200
Free Window 0
Free Screen 0
End

.addevent
 If MenuHit=0 AND ItemHit=3 Then Gosub about
Return

.about
  Title$="About"
  BodyText$="Jurassic Pack Pro-Poller V1.0|19(C)95|By KillJoy/BDZ"
  GadgetText$="OK"
  result=Request(Title$,BodyText$,GadgetText$)
Return

Now, when I select About from the menu, and press OK, the About
requester keeps popping up. It disappears and returns again! It just
won't end! What am I doing wrong here?

Please, reply to my email adress, as I am not a member of this mailing-

Ummm, using 2 pass compiling Blitz will make sure all relevant buffers 
are as small as possible except for string workspace which the programmer
has the last say. If your object maximums are being overwritten something 
you are doing something way wrong. The only thing I know that resets 
object maximums is to reloadlibs from compiler menu which I find a 
ginormouse pain in the butt but Mark says no change...

For all those people attempting to get the triton demo proggies working
here is a fixer you can run against each of them to convert the internal

I have avoided anything fancy so it should be ok with all blitz releases.

Firstly, Install triton itself (I think the 'libs:triton.library' file is
required when you run the FDconv program, could be wrong tho.)

Hokey dokey.. here's wot I did..
from the shell
FDconv triton_lib.fd
Then (I think) it says something about a library, enter
triton.library
(remember case is important)
then it asks for a library number from 1-255, if you have no 3rd party
extensions enter 14 here. (if you don't use a 14 you will have probs with
the demo programs.. I'll try and write a library fixer for the demo progs
tonight.
This should create the library OK.
you then need to run the makedeflibs program to (surprisingly) make the
deflibs file (although I do advise you to back up your current deflibs
just in case).

Hope this helps.

A call to the US rep made

For all those, who want it easier ;)

The library ID I used was 14. I sent to Mikko the ascii listings with
a short key to programming-guide. so they will be on x2ftp soon.

[didn't I wrote that already in a mail? I get older ;)

I wonder why nobody encounters that bug, but I have serious probs with it
and it stops me from finishing a game that I have been playing around with
for more than 2 years now (not because of the complexity but more because
of long interruptions through school/university...):

THE BUG: Simply try to use BitmapInput in Blitzmode and then Edit$ to get
a string. It prints the prompt and then halts the system _completly_!
I am confused by the last docs in the BUM-magazine, where it says that
Blitz leaves the Keyboard-Interrupt on and you don't have to use Blitzkeys
anymore (or something like that). I finally got that to work with Blitz1.8,
but now with 1.9 it crashes again:( Any glorious ideas??:)
BTW I still use the old Slice-Lib, because I don't want to rewrite these
routines anymore - I want to finish that game now. Anyway, can this be the
cause for the crash?

ColSplit: I have got no reply to that question yet:(, but could someone ex-
plain me how I can _remove_ a Colsplit? I only want to use one at the end
of a level, and later restore the display to normal. Should I do a ColSplit
with the same rgb-numbers for every line to remove the effect?
Please help..!

 I had this problem with one of my games.  All I did was to save the area
 of memory (in which the ColSplits are stored) into an array at the start
 of the program (ie. before any ColSplits have been used).  Then poke this
 array back again to reset the screen to normal.  It's not a very nice
 was of doing it I admit, but it seems to work OK.

 I'll try to find the bit of code tonight, but it's pretty easy to do
 anyway.

Although, I think the RI CDlib extension also uses 14, so you could get a
clash.

Hi,

today  one  of  our users called me and asked if there exists a list of all
examples  available  for BlitzBasic. Nope, I said, but it's a good idea and
it could be very useful for all.

Therefore  I  ask  you  all  to  send  me all examples you can find on your
harddisks  which  haven't  been  published  yet  in  any way (so don't send
sources which are already one of the BUMs for example :-)))

I will collect them, sort them thematically, build a index file and put the
index file and the archive(s) on the FTP server and on the aminet.

Mikko, is Majordomo able to act like a server for files, e.g. bb2-examples?
That  would  be the easiest way for all I think, as not everbody has access
to  the  FTP or aminet directories. Via this server single sources could be
ordered,  an  index  file  can  be  posted monthly for example. If somebody
searches  for  a  routine how to program a GTListView for example, he might
have  a  look  on  the  index  file and "frequest" it from the BB2 Examples
Server.



Or  does there exist something like this already, and is there somebody who
would help me with this work?


seeya,

Falk
