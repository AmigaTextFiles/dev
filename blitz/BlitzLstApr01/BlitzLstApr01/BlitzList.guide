                          Blitz Mailing List Guide
                          ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

I've got a detokeniser lying around somewhere, works ok.  I'm not sure how
it works with libs that have greater than 127 commands, but there aren't too
many of those.

Subject: @{b}AmiBlitz -> BlitzPC@{ub}

Hi all,

There's a post by Simon Armstrong (Mark Sibly's ACID coding partner on
AmiBlitz etc) on www.blitzbasement.com 's forums asking for help in
translating AmiBlitz source to BlitzPC source, with a view to porting his
old Amiga games written in Blitz (presumably Skidmarks would be one of
them). If anyone is interested in helping, see this post (copy the whole
thing and paste into your browser):

http://www.blitzbasement.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1280&FORUM_ID=4&CAT_I
D=2&Topic_Title=bbami+porting+project&Forum_Title=Coder+Corner

Anyone ever have any luck de-tokenising Amiga Blitz source without having to
use "Save as ASCII"...? I know I didn't figure it out ;)

Maybe if he gets help he can be talked into releasing the Amiga Blitz source
(Sibly's definitely OK with it, just Simon to convince :)

  Well, the easier way, is to write an AmigaASCII to PCBlitz convertor,
as people can use different lib numbers in the tokened source, and any
obscure lib, can still be easily ported across.

That's the idea of what they're gonna do, but I guess all Simon's code 
must be saved with the tokens (doh!) and so they need a detokeniser to 
convert from BB2 -> ASCII.

I'd also guess that they have some obscure libs of their own that were 
used for their games and never released :)

I would like to put small animation inside window. Maybe somebody have

Any other ideas or maybe examples? Speed is not important - even 10 frames

 Try the simpliest method - put all anim frames into shapes and WBlit them
one after another =)

There is no single command to do this, but there is an example of this provided 
with Blitz (either on the "Examples" disk or in the "Examples" drawer on the 
CD. You should look for the source file called mydir.bb or mydir2.bb.

There is also an example on Aminet, and is probably better than those two 
examples:

Initially you open the file:

#FILE_NUMBER = 0
If OpenFile(#FILE_NUMBER, "filename")

Then you must have a fixed (I think) record format. This is how the data will 
be stored in the file.

For example, if we wanted to store a string and number for each record (it 
might help to think of it like a database) we would need to create a couple of 
variables for storing this information and then specify the record format:

DEFTYPE.w some_number
DEFTYPE.s some_string : MaxLen some_string=192
Fields #FILE_NUMBER,some_string,some_number

We need to give all strings used in records a maximum length using the MaxLen 
command. The strings you use with this file can not be longer than the length 
you specify in the MaxLen command. The variables you use in the Fields command 
will be the variables you use to "communicate" with the file. So now that we 
have the file open and the record format set up, we can read and write from the 
file.

First of all the structure of the file in this example will be like this:

Record number  Variable   Variable   .....
   in file       type       type

      1         string      word
      2         string      word
      3         string      word
     ...          ...        ...
      n         string      word

So as you can see, each record in the file has the same types as you specify 
with the Fields command.

Now, to write something to the file, we need to put values in the variables you 
specify in the Fields command (remember, these are the ones you use to 
communicate with the file) and issue the Put command. So, to put something as 
the first entry in the file, we would use:

some_string = "This is the first item in the file!"
some_number = 69
Put #FILE_NUMBER,1

This information will then be stored in the file, at record number 1. You can 
write any number of other records to the file, at any record position, but you 
must set the values to be stored in the variables some_string and some_number.

Now, if we wanted to read a record from the file, you issue the Get command. In 
this example, if you have not written anything else to record 1, it should 
still have the above data in it:

some_string = ""   ; These two are just to prove that the values get read from
some_number = 0    ; the file. You would not normally include these.
Get #FILE_NUMBER,1 ; Read the values from the file
NPrint some_string ; These should show the same data as we originally put
NPrint some_number ; to the file earlier

So now you can do as many Put's or Get's on the file as you want. When finished 
with it, you would simply do:

CloseFile #FILE_NUMBER
EndIf


Basically you tell the commands what variable to communicate through and then 
Put will copy from the variable->file and Get will read from the file into the 
variables you specified. In the case of these files, I do not think you need to 
use FileOutput to redirect the data to the file.

Hope that helps.

 Greets everyone.


 I got a few question if I'm allowed
-------------------------------------


   I wanted to make a little program that was able to:

   ? tell me wich files and dirs that exists in a destination
        This is a big problem. I can't seem to find
        any commands in the manual able to do this.

   ? open a file, to read and write from it at random locations.
        I found the PUT and GET commands in the Manual, even in
        an example. But still I could NOT figure out the logic
        how these commands work.


These problems I encountered more than 6 moths ago. Therefore I
stopped using BlitzII. If anyone can help, I might start
programming again.


Thanks,
 Terje Maurset

Yes James! This I like, working through the OS.
Makes me wondering. Where have you ppl learned how to program
through the OS? The BlitzII manual only got a list of the names.
Do you know where I can get some more educational info?

The versions coming with the BlitzII is buggy. It gives an error
'Duplicated Type'. The Aminet version failed to. Is this a problem
with my version of BB2?

 David,

  HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP!! Please!

  eeeeheeheeeeek :-(


I've read your mail and even gone through the example included with
the BlitzII disks. Basically, I'm still stuck at the EXACT same place
I was 6 months ago. Can you still help me?


I want to open a file and write somehting into it.
It's supposed to be ridiculous simple. But for me it's apparently
NOT, and it drives me crazy!

The example here it taken from the BlitzII disks.



---------- S T A R T     P R O G R A M ----------
;
; Field...Put...Get program example
;


If OpenFile(0,"Ram:Test")
  MaxLen c$ = 16
  Fields 0,c$
  c$="RANDOM ACCESS!"
  Put 0,0
  CloseFile 0
EndIf

MouseWait
End

--------- E N D    P R O G R A M ----------------


When I run this program it would be logically for me to asume :

- the lenght of the file would be the same as the lenght of 'c$',
  and NOT 22 bytes.

- that 'c$' would be printed at the beginning of the file and
  not 4 bytes to the "right"..


Do you got a good source for this?




Regards,
 Terje

It's flickering because you can see the bitmap as it's cleared.

Looks like you want to use two bitmaps and double buffer the display.
Try this -

 WBStartup
 InitPalette 0,32
 InitCopList 0, 44, 256, $10005, 8, 32, 0
 BLITZ
 QAMIGA
 LoadPalette 0,"mc.col"

 Bitmap 1,320,256,6

 CreateDisplay 0
 DisplayPalette 0,0
 Queue 0,1
 Queue 1,1
 QBlitMode CookieMode

 db=0 ; this holds the bitmap to display

 For a=1 To 50
  UnQueue db
  QBlit db,0,0,50
  VWait
  DisplayBitmap 0,db
  db=1-db ;alternate between 1 and 0
 Next a

I haven't tested this code,because I can't see my AGA output at the moment.

Hello!

Yes, me again...I don't know, what I'd do without you ;)

I've got a little problem, I just want to Blit a shape to Bitmap, based on
the DisplayLib. So this is my Source:

WBStartup
InitPalette 0,32
InitCopList 0, 44, 256, $10005, 8, 32, 0
BLITZ

QBlitMode CookieMode
DisplayBitMap 0,0

For a=1 To 50
UnQueue 0
QBlit 0,0,0,50
VWait
Next a

When I start the Programm, the Shape flickers, it disappears every second
frame, I think. I tried the same with a Buffer, but it also flickers. Just
using the Blit Command works, but I want the Shape to be moved. 

Can anyone help me?

Bye,

Subject: @{b}Could anyone write this program@{ub}

Hi,

I am sure a few of you know the feeling when a partition is getting full.

You get anxious and don't want it to get full when you are trying to write a
file to it.

I have a program Volume Watch which is kind of ok, but I had a different
idea.

Could somone write a program that runs in the background (LOW priority) and
either via tool types or text file warns you when a volume gets beyond a
certain fullness?

My first idea is that you have an initial warning, a warning and a "DISC
FULL" notification.

Anyone care to have a go?

p.s.  I think the tooltypes would be better.  :)

Cya!

So you could specify a % full for the initial warning, the % for the
warning. The OS would tell you when the disk is full (when writing to it
fails ;).

See attached.

There are plenty of other things to do to the progrsam still (some proper
error checking in places, although the important things are done) and it
should probably read the device list and report on them all.

There might still be some bugs, although it seemed OK the few times I
tested it. Source included, so the rest of the list can make improvements
(read: fixes ;).

(11k for an exe to do this is pretty bad)

Hi David

I've just realised that I save the source tokenised (ooh! naughty :) so it 
probably won't compile on a lot of people's setup, and if it does it could 
possibly be wrong.

I'm fixing it to read from all devices, and I'll re-send the source as plain

Check out disk/moni/LowDiskSpace.lha it does exactly what you want. It runs
as a commodity and uses the tooltype config you requested :)

Hi Torgeir,

I spent some time and put together a package which shows you how to do a
screenmode-requester, open a screen and then output some doublebuffered
graphics to an intuition-window (only RTG at the moment) with Blitz Basic
and Mildred.

I just now uploaded an update (V1.01) to this package who I hope will arrive
in a day or two. So check V1.01 out when it gets available for download:

dev/basic/JMildred_ScrMd.lha

Hope it helps,

You need to do this before you open your window:

AddIDCMP #LISTVIEW_IDCMP

(and you need amigalibs.res resident).

This is what I have in some old source:

    ...followed by...
AddIDCMP #LISTVIEWIDCMP

You call these before opening the window that holds the listview...

BTW How would that be off-topic? :)

 I'm using NCS commands, to open windows etc. so I do something like that

(...)
   NAddTag #WA_IDCMP, #LISTVIEWIDCMP | (...)
(...)

 in tag list, before opening the window. But then, when I try to move
scroller gadget it can be scrolled smoothly only a bit, and then it refuses
to work properly. Of course I can still scroll it as previous. Any ida
what's going on?

How can i move a shape 135 degrees instead of 90 degrees.
I do this:
repeat
   x=x+1
   y=y+1
   blit shape,x,y
until 0

No matter what I try if i want the shape to move 135 degrees it either
flickers a pixel up and down when I want it to move at same speed as 90
degrees, or it does it smoothly but at twice the speed.

When you say flickers up and down, is that when you say x+1 in one frame and 
then y+1 in the next - so you actually see it move right and then down 
individually instead of right and down at the same time?

It's not actually twice the speed, it's the square root of 2 times the speed 
(about 1.41) when you say x+1:y+1. The only way I can think of to make them 
move at the same speed is to either speed up the shape moving at 90 degrees by 
1.4 or slow down the shape at 135 degrees by 1.4.

This will slow the 135 degrees shape down by a factor of 1.4, but it might not 
be the nicest thing to look at, and it certainly won't be the fastest code. 
Speeding up the 90 degrees shape might be better.

pos.w=0
Repeat
    If pos=0
        x=x+1
        y=y+1
    Else
        If pos MOD 3<>0
            x=x+1
            y=y+1
        EndIf
    EndIf
    Blit shape,x,y

    pos=pos+1
    If pos=7 Then pos=0
Until 0

In that case it's more like 116 degrees, not 135 ;)

Yeah....but if you move it a bigger distance, and maybe stand a few metres away 
from the screen the visual effect should be that it moves at the same speed :)

Sorry, it was the best I can do, and if you are operating at lowres then it'll 
be the best anyone can do. You either have the diagonal directions moving 
faster, or you need skipping/flickering shapes to either slow the diagonals 
down or speed up the horizontal/vertical.

If you could use a high resolution, then you could achieve more accurate 
results with the skipping/flickering.

> <>90 degrees.

It adds 1 to the horizontal and vertical each frame (unless it is one of the 
frames where it skips this). So you'll end up with this position (frame numbers 
written beside the position, position 0,0 is top-left as it is with the 
display):

@NODE "mail_36" " My Bl**dy HDD (Again) "
From: Tony Rolfe <edgewater@...>
Date: 04-30-01 10:42:14
Subject: @{b}My Bl**dy HDD (Again)@{ub}

Sorry if this is off topic, but I'm going potty here.

Can someone explain (in words of one syllable, if possible) how 
one SCSI controller can recognise a hard disk and another SCSI 
controller simply doesn't know that it's there?

Situation...

I have an Oktagon 2008 SCSI controller, a Quantum 540 Meg HDD 
and an IBM 4.3 Gig HDD.   Until recently, all was well.

I bought a GVP A2040 accellerator and the SCSI recognised both 
drives but wouldn't use the PFS2 partitions on the IBM drive,

I used ExpertPrep, supplied with the accellerator to automount the 
partitions, but, since then, the Oktagon hasn't been able to see the 
IBM drive.  It doesn't appear in the early boot screen, in HDToolBox 
(or equivalent - and I've tried most of them) or on the WB Screen.

The GVP board has died and been sent back.

I have borrowed an A2091, which handles the IBM drive OK, but, no 
matter what I do I can't get it recognised by the Oktagon.

The data is no longer required, I've recreated that, I just want to use 
the drive with the Oktagon.    Any ideas anyone?

HELP??

Cheers

Tony

Unfortunately for you, and all the other GVP owners out there, these cards
don't allocate enough filesystem memory for anything but FFS. The memory is
allocated from on baord memory, of which there is only 64K, but it seems to
be split up. PFS, SFS etc are all larger than 24K and as such the onboard
memory isn't large enough to ho;ld the filesystem. The result is a drive
that daoesn't have an FS, and so your only course of action with the GVP is
to use FFS.

I have been told that by using FFS on the boot partition, and then utilising
mount-files for the others  PFS can be used, but I have, so far, had no luck
in doing this. I am using a 4060 G-Force.

Sell it or suck it really, that's what i've had to do

What's this got to do with GetAShape then? ;)

You could try the E clock, but I'm not sure if that is the time since system 
startup or not. Could be though.

NEWTYPE.sixtyfour
    high.l
    low.l
End NEWTYPE

DEFTYPE.sixtyfour e_val
freqeuncy_of_e_clock.l = ReadEClock_(&e_val)
; Number of E clock (based on master frequency of computer, different for
; PAL (709379Hz) and NTSC (715909Hz).

You can therefore get the time in fractions of a second between two ReadEClock_ 
calls by subtracting the first from the second and then dividing by the 
frequency.

Hehe, I had started to ask about that but figured something out as I was
writing that message, so I recycled it to ask about timing..  but I
obviously forgot to change the subject :)

That's ok, I'm only after a way to wait for 25 50ths of a second and stuff
like that.

Hmm, ok, but how would I get the 64 bit value of the eclock?  I guess
maybe only the lower 32 bits are going to change in a second or two
anyway?

Hi John

Should have mentioned this before, but Delay_ from dos.library waits in chunks 
of 50ths of a second (on all machines). e.g. Delay_ x waits for x/50ths of a 
second.

> Hmm, ok, but how would I get the 64 bit value of the eclock?  I guess

Maybe only the lower 32 bits would change, but you'd need to subtract the two 
things different eclock values. Probably easier using the Delay_ :)

Actually, I just went to try the eclock method and found that the ReadEClock_ 
doesn't tokenise here. And ISTR devices being a bit broken in Blitz. Another 
advantage of Delay is that it actually puts the program to sleep in a proper 
multitasking way, whereas if you used the eclock, you'd have to do a busy-wait 
loop to wait for x/50ths of a second.

ISTR there is a field in a structure somewhere with that value, but I

Hi Deftone

Do you mean:

a) You need a screenshot of something running in Blitz mode
b) You need a screenshot of an application written in blitz basic
c) You want to write a blitz basic program which is a screengrabber

For a you need an action replay type thing, or perhaps some low level copper 
ripper? I suppose you could also get as much of the screen as you can and then 
paste the bits together in a paint program (bits - I mean if you have dual 
playfield, or copper displays).

For b, download SGrab from Aminet, it kicks ass :)

For c, I guess you could copy the screen bitmap into a blitz bitmap and then 
save the IFF file. You might get problems if you just do ScreensBitMap, as if 
it is interleaved, blitz gives you a bitmap which is 4* as wide (or somthing), 
so you will actually need to use BltBitMap_ or something. Then just save the 
bitmap as normal. I don't know how you'd manage to grab a copper display type 
of screen though.

If your programm runs in "Amiga" or "Blitz" mode, just insert following lines
in your program, where you want the screenshot get from....


QAMIGA
SAVEBITMAP 0,"Ram:YourFile.iff",1	; 0 = Your Bitmap you want save

BLITZ					; Only if ya prog runs in Blitzmode...

OK, attached is an archive which has two examples. pubscreens.bb2 is an
example of getting a list of public screens on the system and opening and
closing windows on them.

Allscreens is an example screen grabber that can grab any screen on the
system. I think using LockIBase...UnlockIBase stops the screens from
closing, so if you grab the screens between those two calls it is OK. The
same goes for windows, you just need to have another list for windows on
the system and then go through each screen adding the windows to that list
(starting from e.g. *scl\FirstWindow). It does not save the palette (I
don't know how - anyway, got to leave you some work :).

Hi Deftone

You need to include blitzlibs:amigalibs.res in your Compiler Options->Residents 
settings. If you have that and it still gives those errors, change them to 
*scr\_Width and *scr\_Height.

> pubscreens.bb2
> Syntax Error

I don't know what's wrong with that line. It has nothing to do with any missing 
libraries, since there should be no library commands on that line. If 
GetPubScreen shows up as a command on your system (the only thing I can think 
of for now) then change the name of it.

Hi Deftone

Hmm, you maybe also need to change the definition of *scr to be *scr._Screen 
instead of *scr.Screen.

Make sure the amigalibs.res is resident and then go to the View Newtypes item 
in the compiler menu. Type Screen in the box there and press return. It should 
show you what the newtype fields are. If it beeps, try _Screen.

It shows up? You mean it gets highlighted? It doesn't do that for me, so it 
seems you have more/different libraries from me. Just change the name of the 
function in the code from GetPubScreen{... to something else like GPScreen{...

hi.... Check out the Dev on Aminet... There you should find an Archiv called

Have you tried contacting Chris Hodges (hodges@...) who wrote the
MASMPeg.device for the MAS-Player?

If you get any info from him for using his device, please forward a copy 
to me.

I wrote the playlisted program (available from my & dirk conrad's websites).

but would like to access my MAS-Player directly instead of using dirk's shell
programs...
