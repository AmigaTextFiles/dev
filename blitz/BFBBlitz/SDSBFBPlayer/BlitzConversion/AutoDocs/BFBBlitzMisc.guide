@node A2 "About BFB"

        SOME SNIPPETS FROM THE BFB DOCS FOLLOW:

	If you ave anything to ask, suggest or complain on the libraries
	documents or developer material, please don't hesitate to

	Purpose of this player:
	-----------------------

	  Why was this program written. You can see immediately that it	can't
	compete with the current replayer programs that are available as free
	ware. This program has been more like a test tool for me when I've
	been writing the libraries that do the actual replaying. There was no
	need to write a massive player, just a simple program that is small
	and fast. The whole program is written in 100% assembly language, so
	I think I've reached my goal.

	  If this player is not good, then why it was released?? Well, I
	thought that when I finally release the library collection into
	public, I thougt it would be cool to make two packages. One is USER
	package (this is it) and the other is DEVELOPER package. Besides
	some of you might like this tiny replayer. 


	@{b}Notes about the replayers:@{ub}
	--------------------------

	Some small notes about specific replay libraries. Some libs are not
	mentioned here, but that's because they don't have anything to note.

	- @{b}MED / OctaMED		(bfbplayMED!.library)@{ub}
	  The library uses medplayer.library v2 to playback the modules,
	  so make sure that it exist in your LIBS: path. And make sure it's
	  the version 2!!

	- @{b}The Player 6.0a	(bfbplayP60A.library)@{ub}
	  When the module is started, there happens few enforcer hits but
	  then they are gone. I know where the hits are coming from but I
	  don't know why. I'm trying to fix. These hits are not dangerous.

	- @{b}PlaySID		(bfbplayPSID.library)@{ub}
	  bfbplayPSID.library uses playsib.library 1.1 to play the PSID
	  tunes. Make sure it exists in your LIBS: path. Due to a bug in
	  the playsid.library it doesn't work with the KickStart 1.3. That's
	  why the player checks if you're running it on KS1.3 and prevents
	  you from playing the PSID tunes if yes.

	- @{b}ProTracker		(bfbplayPT20.library)@{ub}
	  Used replaycode is from ProTracker 2.2, but although it has been
	  almost completely rewritten, I don't know anything about the
	  possible ProTracker 3.0+ specific commands. So, if there exists any,
	  this replayer most likely isn't capable to play them.

	- @{b}THX sound system	(bfbplayTHXS.library)@{ub}
	  Needs 020+ CPU to play the tunes. The library checks for the CPU,
	  so you cannot start playback if you don't have 020+ CPU. And
	  during the test only one module caused enforcer hits. I dunno
	  if this is a serious problem.
