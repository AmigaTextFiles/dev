FIXED BFBPlayMaster.library FUNCTION DEFINTION FILE
===================================================

We were having some problems with the original FD, due to the
author leaving spaces in the ascii. I also had to change the
definition of the BFBChangeModule command, as it was missing
SongNum. (I still think this doesn`t work, but I`ll test it
better later on ;) )

If you are going to create the library again with this FD,
make sure you use NewFDConvert from aminet dev/basic.
It was the only FD converter we could find that would create
the FD correctly (ta James and Curt ;))..

Cyaz!
