						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

Subject: @{b}AmiDiction bug.@{ub}

Hello Blitzers,
               I'm not sure if this is Blitz problem or not.
But it is regarding my Blitz program AmiDiction.
The bug is as follows:- 

Due to changes in the services of www.dictionary.com, AmiDiction's
workings had to be restructured and unfortunately now contains a bug
which I'm having some difficulty in resolving. Words with large
definitions such as "set" cause AmiDiction to have a premature EOF and
therfore the output definition will be incomplete. If an EOF occurs,
you will be notified of this in the text console. Feedback as to why
this is occuring and ideas on how to go about fixing this problem will
be most appreciated.

It worked fine before the changes in www.dictionary.com. I have set
lots of string buffer in blitz's compiler, 100k infact. So I really
dont know what the problem is, or if it is a Blitz problem or something
I dont know about comms perhaps.

Kind regards

We'd have a job given that BlitzPC uses DirectX and is far more advanced
than AmiBlitz in terms of what it does with the hardware.

That, and of course, the fact that BlitzPC is purely for games.

Cheers,

You can use Stormwizard (fastest to use) or efmui (nicest look many custom

Yes, i know it would be hard. I just dont want
AmiBlitz to remain in the stone age.

Its a shame nobody is trying to make AmiBlitz into the
#1 Basic programming language for Amiga - with the
latest OS 3.9 functionality & GUI capability.

As you are aware AmigaOne will be released soon &
someone is going to provide development software and
make money on it.

I rather it be AmiBlitz.
Couldnt some sort of abstraction layer be built ? that
way Amiblitz could be very portable.

Some good games are being released for BlitzPC
including souce which just fail to compile in
AmiBlitz.

showing off the same game for Amiga 68k, ppc, x86
would be great.

is all hope lost ?

later, asy

isnt that a C developers tool ?
Or is it compatible with Amiblitz ?
Also I need to buy Storm C for that, wouldnt I  ?

Well, maybe.
All AmiBlitz is coded in pure 68k assembly language. Converting it for ppc
would be a very hard task.
Anyway old software (68k native, and clean os programs) will work on
AmigaONE.
Maybe you can use some sort of 68k>PPC assembly conversion (i know that
exists at least one program for this), if you have the assembly source of
your progs.
And you should ask to Acid Software to do that, the good Bernie is doing
this work for free, and the pc blitz is commercial so i don't think they
will allow someone to do an Amiga compatible Blitz2D/3D.

If you need high-level language with compatibility with more os, why not try
PureBasic? When you buy it, they will send you the Amiga, the PC and the
Linux version of the compiler and editor. You can then write a program with
standard commands and it will compile w/o problems on these 3 os, using the
better way (I think, because on win it uses directx for gfx output), and you
still can access os functions. If you are used of AmiBlitz/BlitzBasic, you
should know that PureBasic is a sort of clone, you can find similar or equal
commands on it. And you can produce assembly sources instead of exe's so you
can optimize/translate them.

Berga

Huh? what is the #1 Basic language on the amiga then?

Bernd is doing a great job updating and bugfixing AmiBlitz.
On top of that, he`s doing it in his own time, and releasing it for free.

What extra functionality in 3.9 ;)
Anyway, AmiBlitz can already use it..just run fdconvert on the updated 
library fd files, convert the headers to blitz and away you go.

The trouble here are the userlibs that people use. Some are Amiga hardware 
specific, others depend on 3rd party shared libraries etc etc.
On top of that, many were released without source code which doesnt help the 
porting process to OS4/Morphos or whatever.

Let`s just hope Amiga Inc are quicker at releasing the NDK`s for
OS4 than they were for 3.5 & 3.9 !
I`d love to see Amiblitz continued onto OS4 so I could rewrite /port some of 
my programs to take advantage of the PPC`s speed.

>Some good games are being released for BlitzPC
>including souce which just fail to compile in
>AmiBlitz.

But what about the difference in hardware performance between a PC and the 
Amiga?
DirectX emulation would drain an already overworked CPU.

Why not try the SDL library..available for the amiga, windows, linux (and 
others too), specifically developed to make porting of games between 
different systems easier.

Anyway, since Blitz started off on the Amiga, why not heckle Mark Sibly into 
making the PC version more compatible ;)

There is PPC68k which handles these things even if you don't have
the asm source. (but do have a good disassembler)

I think BlitzPC should be made compatible with AmiBlitz ! I am not
joking (I have bought BlitzPC as well) and both the original BlitzBasic
for Amiga and AmiBlitz are definitely better than BlitzPC. BlitzPC is
fast enough and it has special functions for graphics (using Direct-X),
but it has a sub-set of commands from the BlitzBasic for Amiga. For example
it has no support for OS (in such case Windows) and it uses a runtime.dll
like VisualBasic (though it is linked in the executable... but that's why
.EXEs made by BlitzPC have a very large size). Actually Mark is working on
a new version called BlitzMax for PC, with a real linker and a new improved
compiler... it'll be something like AmiBlitz for Amiga. :)

I think Amiga is still in stoneage (The average CPU's count on AMiga is
030/50)
PPC is sold to low and was therefore crap.Is it shit because it is sold too
low or sold to low because it is shit

Use a PC and BlitzPC thats just the best if you want make 3D games

AB2 support still more as C.With 3D Games you must just go the same way as C
until someone make a lib

With AB2 you can do easy 2d Games on GFX Cards in 16-32bit.
A voodoo3 System get in the blits.ab2 Demo >250 Cookieblittet Balls with
32*32 Pixels in nonrectangular Mode.

You can still use PPC Assembler in AB2 so you can use the PPC stormmesa.  

But i give up PPC because now there are too few Amiga Users out so Developer

get not enough money and maybe OS4 get a simular crap as fusion
PPC/Amigawriter or the other new age Amiga commercial Soft.And someone who
is not able in 5 Years to get AMigaOS working on PPC i have no believe

If they do good work (i dont believe)with the JIT AB2 can reach near 80% of
native Speed
The 2.27 compiler i work should support register vars so speed is increase
also ca 20% so wy i should do the hard job of porting for 20% Speed ???

This is available to all Platforms and i really hate prefer one System.
68k is for me the virtual Language of Classic Amiga.
Only User i not support are those who have no FPU.Because i think a User who
have today no FPU use no Amiga anymore

No it is a gui editor that generate binary files currently you can buy it at
a addon Cd for 10$+shipping by H&P.but i hope sometimes it get free.I think
1.0 is free ?

Commercial Programs that use stormwizard are Arteeffect Turboprint StormC...

Reaction have bad editor (groups should be loaded/save or do you want when
you need a slider+string+text all do step by step)
and i think it is not capable to do large project.Where are big reaction
Programms ?

Adding a guiwin in amiblitz is easy

Here is a simple Program that use a *.wizard file you design with the editor

Acsessing Gadgets is easy do a wzprint "gadget",val[,val...
You need no constantlist include you can choose the gadget name 

AB2 does automatic the right depending what gadget type it use.Just easy as
writing non guiprograms.If your gadget is a pagegad val select of course
the page.No stupid tags are need but possible for nonstandard features if
you for example want diffrent colors in a listview like ped do

Reading data you do with wzinput or wzinputstr

I found this the best solution the sad thing is only that MUI Classes cannot
use only standard amiga Boopsi classes can use.A exmaple how write custom
classes is available.Wy H&P use the Reaction Shit in 3.5 i never
understand.

I think it should sell 3.5 because 3.1 Users cant use it.But this is really
bad praxis Microsoft make direct X Available also for win98.They kno
developers use this technic that is available oin most platforms.If
DirectX8 is not free this result in stop progress because only DirectX5 is
then developed.OS4 make trhe same mistake ...

It is really easy to add to standard Boopsi gadgets shading only to do is
draw lines with diffrent colors if run in 65k Mode.But my priority is
functionality before looking so i have no time to do better look

The stormwizard API with MUI was my dream which i can only do if i maybe get
the stormwizard Source

The reason for not doing it i think is it must simular to Standard
Visualbasic.

If BlitzPC get full language i think Mark get maybe trouble with Microsoft.
Same as ID SOft.They fear noone buy Q3 engines and forbid using the format
in BlitzPC.
If this done in Amiga i think ID Soft have not forbid this

Noone need then C or VisualBasic if BlitzPC support activeX and OCX.Its fast
as C
and komfartabel as VB then you need not choose 1 language support all

There is no technical reason that Basic is slow comfortabel and C fast
uncomfortabel.Its only sell strategy 

A reason wy C is popular in this raw state: 

Programmers dont like learn something maybe better other than standard 

All know this situation:
A drill is unsharp you want to put a hole in steel.

Most spend much time and press the drill hard in the hole

Maybe he is faster with one hole when i sharpen my drill with selfbuild
drillsharper.But if he later have to put more holes i get much more speed
then he

Have tools in optimal state give overall best possible performance.

And all that use GCC ... are in my eyes not very productive and fast and
loose faster the fun to develop.
Look winuae/linux uae.Winuae have lots more features.Seem VisualC motivate
the dev not to early giveup a project before it is finished.If you look on
Linux you see lots of 60% Software.Users think wy does not something other
finish this project ? 
The reasen is simple:Its hard to understand not selfmade C and even C++
Programms.
Thats true but if I use clickjump and the AB2 searchfunctions i get able to
furtherdevelop a unknown program


BTW: If the Amigaone get really sucsess (i dont believe the sellers of
nonstandard Hardware (PS2/Xbox..) need to sell under costs and get money
with games(the reason wy winuae is not allowed for xbox) i maybe add PPC
support if it is usefull

Normaly its not much diffrence if you compile from C to 68k asm and compile
from 68kasm to PPCasm.or compile direct from C to PPC asm.

When you program a PPC in Assembler you get really 3* Speed of X86 (i see it
on my DSP Routines of softsynth) if you manage registers from hand etc.
But if you use C Compilers Speed is same if you have 4 regs X86 or 32 regs
PPC +mulladd Instruction PPC)

Compare in Praxis Raytracing Speed of povray or Cinema4d same MHZ same Speed
on Athlon (realspeed)versus G4 (downscaled Athlons XP because such fast G4
are not available)

You should try PureBasic ..very Blitz like (user created command libraries 
etc), no runtime needed, full Win32 API support...plus it`s a hell of a lot 
cheaper than BlitzPC!

 I also have PureBasic demo for PC and it's very good indeed, but still
for fast 2d (Direct-X) , I think BlitzPC is better. The 2d version of
BlitzPC is much cheaper than PureBasic. BlitzPPC supports external DLLs,
so you can expand its capability. But still AmiBlitz is the best among
PureBasic (Amiga or Windows) and BlitzPC.

 Exactly ! I tried myself with my Voodoo card and it's gorgeous. And
all this with just a 060... On PC (with BlitzPC or other languages) , you
need hundreds of OS libraries (DirectX) to do the same... :)

AmiBlitz is still a lot better than PB for the Amiga, but I prefer PB under Windows. Yes 
BlitzPC supports the use of external DLLs but seems they need to be compiled a bit 
differently to standard DLLs. BlitzMAX sounds like it is going to be PB with all the bells 
and whistles from Blitz2D and Blitz3D. By the time that is finished, PB is supposed to have 
full 2D and 3D capability.

So whatever happens, sure looks like there will be some fun in the future ;)

Well not really true =)
I just got the windoze version when I ordered PB. The Amiga version I won`t use as 
Blitz works satisfactory. Anyways, after asking for it I got the linux version so no 
propblems there. But the linux version is still quite limited. I coded a gui in one 
evening, that is dead easy, but soon got stuck with various issues. No proper message 
handling for gui/window events, no audio, no timer support, no hardware access(serial 
etc), most importantly no linux/posix api support. So until that gets updated I 
guess it`s a just a fun tool for now. I did find a couple of bugs and submitted it. 
I`m not bashing PB for linux btw, I know it`s beta at best.

I test the win demo of purebasic.I switch Debugger chckmark of
The demo say it give slower speed and larger executables.I dont like demos
that say the full version have more speed.I know about one who buy
FXPaint here stand too the full version have more speed he buy this and of
a result jpegs are not load by PPC same as demo(datatypes it not
support).What faster was on the full version he not see


.Here are my results i get

AB2.27 take with a dsp Bench on winuae 1 sec int amithlon of course faster
(seem 0,5 sec)purebasic take over 2 sec with X86 native

Using fpu have same speed on winuae and AB2 is 30% faster on Amithlon
 
For use this testprog with purebasic remove optimize 7 and wbstartup
maybe someone can give me the results of the full version
BTW: Blitz PC Demo is 2* faster than AB2 and comes near VisualC++

Thats the Code

optimize 7

 PB is surely more complete than BlitzPC... and it's great for OS
applications, but then again it all depends from what you have to do.
 For mere 2d applications (and games) BlitzPC gives you something more.

>to be compiled a bit differently to standard DLLs.

 Mmm... no, they are standard DLLs. BlitzPC supports C or Windows
standard conventions. I did myself some DLLs (with lcc-Win32, a C
free C compiler) , it only needs a bit more attention since you
have to pass two Blitz banks as parameter and of course, they are
pointers in C.

 I'm agreed. :) If you stay away from Microsoft products, you can
find something good even for Windows. :)

It already can (PB that is!), there`s an opengl user lib..OK, so it`s a 
little bit beta state at the moment.

If I really wanted to be an anally rententive sod, I could argue the fact 
that since PB supports using 3rd party DLLs, that DirectX and openGL are 
supported too..but I`m not, so I wont ;)

Anyway, AmiBlitz still rules..keep up the hard work Bernd.

>So whatever happens, sure looks like there will be some fun in the >future

Yep, and more flame wars on the BlitzPC and PureBasic forums..

BTW.. since starting coding using the Win32API, I`ve found I no longer curse 
CBM/Amiga/whoever about the Amiga OS and developer docs!

I think you`ve got your wires crossed there.
What the docs said was that enabling the debugger gave slower speed and 
larger exes. It has nothing to do with it being the demo version.

The only difference between full and demo is that quite a few functions have 
been disabled,( just like in the old days when you got crippled shareware).

I just wish I had a working Amiga right now, so I could get back into 
Blitzing about again, all this Win32 stuff is frying my poor little brain.

You shouldn`t have in the first place. i haven`t come across anything like 
it, except maybe qnx devdocs/api. But that`s sadly not yet having a nice

Overall i think i have spend now 200 Hours on AB2 and 400 Hours on winuae.
More than 100 Hours to get a stupid stuff like sound with latency of 20 ms
which can every A500 with 8 MHZ
on winuae 
So you see the right tools give more progress with less time
If you develop as hobby you are free to choose the easiest platform.

I develop winuae only because the PPC developer seem too stupid to do a good
job and make OS4 running on PPC.
But the problem really is that they cannot work together

Hm this mean purebasic is native slower as AB2 on JIT on same PC P3 1 GHZ
The reason for my question is not to blame anything it is because i see that
Purebasic win can create shared libs windows dll.

winuae have a undocumentet feature (broken) to execute native windows dll
Code.
So i can if really need full power use dll.Creating dll from C .. is a
mess 
but if purebasic support this easy and is faster it make sense because
purebasic is simular to AB2

Wy not use winuae ?
start winuae once
then use on your PC Hybernate and you get a running Amiga workbench in 30
sec.
and you never see anything from windows if you not wish

BTW: Wy i realy hate all other os because the windowmanagement pop to front
is
bad.
So developers used docwindows thats a nice feature moving a window you can
not move it fast because doing that maybe it is doced in some confused
way.My 17 Zoll Monitor show not much on VC7 ca 40*15 chars.Higher priority
have safe my eyes so i use only 800*600 on 17 Zoll.1024*768 give also not
much more space 
 
Memprotect take me lots of additional work and help nothing if you do what
you should do write stable programs.On my homesystem i change data only on
1 program at time and here data lost can possible on memprotect too 

One example wy i like Amiga
Bars&Pipes have since 1992 a plugininterface with which you have
acsess to complete Bars&Pipes structure so you can do nearly all with it
acsess to midi/audio sequencer Data plugins etc.Because you can acsess over
4000 Values no Object Orientat Developer give you Methods to all of your
functions.
Normally you write programs because you need a feature you cant buy and are
nonstandard so how should the Method writer know what for methods you
want.He offer you methods for some standard behavior thats it

Cubase the professsional Piece which cost now 600$ have first get a DirectX
interface for audioplugins with bad latency etc.
Later come (1996) special tricky VST Plugins.
Then they find out that audioplugins need acssess to midi timing to set
delay times in BPM.This get V2 1998.
Now we have 2002 and they found out that you can also use midi plugins  have
also acsess to Midi Data so you can for example make midi delays in
realtime nondestructive.Also possible is only >2002 that you can edit your
Synthesizer direct 
without start another program or loopbackdevice because midiports can not
share normaly 
 
The ability to replace sequencers that Bars&Pipes have is still
not in cubase i cannot add here a tracker like step sequencer or so 

For this all i need new cubase Versions.The all in all costs (updates
needed)  belong to min 2000$ to get this acsess i have from beginning in
Bars&Pipes

Look the VST specs in Praxis its a complete mess.THats because someone must
write a api to comuniticate with the host process.If this one is lazy/have
not enough time much usefull is miss.And thats the mainproblem of OO.You
need loots for functional unnecessary work to comunicate between diffrent
programs   

Same is with Photogenics on Amiga or Photoshop on PC.The Plugininterfaces of
Photoshop are very limited.Photogenics plugins have acsess to whole
programs struct so all can acsess if i wish

Only what have usefull plugin Interfaces are M$ Soft but i think no other
than M$ can invest the cost/time and make such a big and complete interface
stuff in OO memprotect way.But i dont use officeapllications at home so
this help me not 

Thats the problems i have in Praxis with memprotect oses

BTW: Steinberg have also designed the first usable realtime (5 ms no
Problem)
Sounddevice called ASIO for PC(macOS9 have this MacOSX 10 not and users not
happy).I look a example prog it look very
complicate
in his 1000 Lines
  
So i stay on AmigaOS this make me more fun i need less time to get usefull
results and since Bernies JIT it can run in the speed i need.
For my own programs it doesnt matter if i emulate it or not only reason for
me is that it can do what i want.Also i dont want complete programs there
are so much 60% solutions out they only must enahnce a few to fit my needs.

AB2 for ex. have in this state only 4000 lines more than BB2 to get the
stuff     
i need so it fit my needs of shared library/plugins/reentrant Code in basic

fast compiletime
need because of missing linker
150000 Lines if a=1 then a=2 take 15 sec on 1 GHZ P3 winuae.

fast execute speed to need no asm or C anymore.
      
comfortabler editor and all what come in future

For non comercial stuff i can choose the easiest and best OS to fit my needs

Do you mean it's slower on compiling or the execution speed of compiled 
program's are slower?

If the compilation speed then one reason is that AB is token based and PB is 
text based multipass compiler. So PB compiles the source to asm and uses 
another compiler to compile the resulting program from the asm (the assembler 
is NASM last time I checked) to the final executable.

Ciao Bernd Roesch,

 You mean AB on Amithlon is faster than PureBasic native on x86 ??

 Anyway... I tested such code:

[...]

optimize 7
cnt.l=0
DEFTYPE .f

NPrint "Inizio"
a=Timer

loop:

r=x1*c1+x2*c2+x3*c3
x3=x2:x2=x1:x1=r

If r > 32768
 r=32768
EndIf

If r < -32768
r=-32768
EndIf

If i2>1000
 If i2>9000000
  Goto out
  EndIf
EndIf

i2+1
Goto loop

out:
b=Timer-a
NPrint b

End

[...]

 with:

1) AB2.26 (on real Amiga with Blizzard-1260@60)

2) BlitzPC full 2d-version (on Celeron@1000)

3) PureBasic-PC demo (on Celeron@1000)

Here they are the results:

1 = 10 s.
2 = 1 s
3 = 2 s.

It seems BlitzPC is two times faster than PB. :) At least in this code.

If your machine was Athlon 1,2 GHz or faster this would mean
that Amithlon with AB2 on the same machine is at least as fast 
as BlitzPC x86 native ;-) (Amithlon with 1,2GHz Athlon is about
10-20 times faster than 68060)

Ups! I didnt see that you wrote Celeron 1000MHz.
So it could be about even speed, AB2 on Amothlon and
BlitzPC on Windows. (If you ignore that it is a celeron,
but this gives only disatvantage to amithlon, a real
athlon or pentium would be better beacuse of cache)

THe cache doesnt matter in this short loop
 
Dont do speculative tests

a 68060/50 overclocked to 10000 GHZ take for the job 0,5 sec is not correct

I only find out some times ago that Blitzpc is simular to VisualC++ Speed
and so 2* faster than AB2.This bench i have not port to blitzPC because its
more work 

So BlitzPC can really called a fast language

Damn! Thanks for the info Amorel.
Actually I'm using PB 3.0 demo to do some little progs on pc, and i'm
continue using Blitz/AmiBlitz on Amiga to do the same, so I didn't know
that.
I'm coding a prog that will remove the debug stuff of compiled progs with
the demo, the funny thing is that all this prog is coded with the PB demo!
:) I need it coz is bad to have a small prog compiled but with that damn
debug window popped up, and because i really don't need the full version,
because i need it only rarely for some really small appz.
And you're right: it's DAMN easy! But too limited at this time...we'll see
the next versions...

I can assure you they are right in this case. I've taken a look on the asm
source generated by pc version of PB and by removing the debug code you
should get a 100/200 % speedup at least. But I'm with you about those who
says "the full version is faster" because most of the times the full ver is
only the demo without nag screens and some small stuff that will not affect
the prog speed.

Hey! I never meant to compare PB with AmiBlitz! AmiBlitz is on another
planet compared with PB, as you can do anything with blitz and only small
things with PB. I've only said that because you can compile PB sources on 3
systems natively, without using an Amiga emulator.
Anyway thanks for the infos, i really like benchmarks :)

With PB v3 and some earlier releases, you cannot switch off the debugger for
the compiled exe's on the demo version. So Bernd is right.

Hey Bernd any chances to have WinUAE running faster in the next releases?
I really like WinUAE because it's really (and easily) configurable. I've
tried AmigaXL but it's damn slow, and Amithlon that is greatly faster but
not configurable at all and you cannot use HD images as WinUAE, but you need
to partition, format in Amiga's way, configure win startup to do dual
boot...etc... You cannot use floppy-images as easily as WinUAE, and you
cannot emulate ALL amiga's (well, it was not built for that). So I really
like it in these days, because it gots good stability and good emulation,
but still it's slow, and it's going to be slower, so you need a fast pc to
do the job, and to have an Amiga that runs only a few times the speed of the
fastest real Amiga (with a very fast pc). I don't mean to get the Amithlon
speed, I know it's impossible coz it runs on a really small'n'fast linux
kernel, but...
Not really a problem, because nowadays you can get a cheap pc and WinUAE
will run times faster than real Amiga, but it will be nice to get it run on
slower (and older) pc's at a reasonable speed (at least 68020, just to try
programs).

No not yet Amithlon have a blockoptimizer so that short branches in integer
compare do not check if the AMithlon minimal chipset should emulate.Since
over 1 Year in my Amiga live I have no need for more winuae speed. 

To get winuae faster set sound to disable but emulate
 
If someone (Bernie) add this stuff to uae then winuae and amithlon seem near
same speed.But most important is a blockoptimizer for FPU branches because
all whats too slow with 1 GHZ use fpu Code (raytracer mp3 coding...)

BTW:The bench i send is very bad for winuae and integer because it use lots
of branches so Amithlon give here double Speed in integer

OK - I thought I saw some timer commands in the AB2 code (which PB only has with external 
libraries).

Anyway, it takes about 1 second to run on my system (judging from my watch). I've got a 
Duron750, Win98, 128Mb.

Can you please send me the blitzPC Bench.
After the results from David that purebasic is fast as BlitzPC i think you
have
forget to use integer vars in the bench (or maybe i have compared speed
wrong).Default is float in Blitz PC.I not
familar to port to blitzPC.On the fast label i get function not found

David:
If you have no timer please increase loopcount to get exacter result
winuae you dont have ?.So you can compare direct

I have a timer bench only for AB2 that run always 1 sec on AB2.

Here i get 10 Millons count per sec on winuae (1 GHZ P3)
On Amithlon i get 17 Million count.If i remove some if thens then winuae
Speed get near amithlon Speed (AMithlon 30% faster).Same as when using FPU
because Amithlon have here no blockoptimizer

On a Athlon 1,3 GHZ (old model) i can remember someone told about 25.This
mean AMD get
with 30% more clock 42% more speed than my lame P3

so the Purebasic result give me no hope that it make sense to use native
Code in winuae  

So i should stay my plan to work on a register optimizer for AB2 which give
faster code to all Amigas most increase is noticed in FPU here

Thats usefull because I have the ok from a very good dsp Engenier to use his
high quality reverb (50 Delays) in AB2 for public.

Here is a standard benchmarking loop maybe usefull to tune timecritical
functions
It show every seconds the loop Count/Million it end if you press long enough

Why have you to do these optimizations? Only for competition against PB?
What I want to say is that you should continue your job as you always done,
and if you want to give AB2 more speed this shouldn't be just for
competition. Just like WinUAE, you know, you all developers of it are doing
a great job, making it more and more stable and compatible, and leaving the
speed problems for the time that WinUAE is finished 100% (like all options
are done and compatibility is 100%). If an emulated Amiga is so fast on a
pc, why bothering you to do these optimizations while there are some more
important things to do (like adding some more features and removing some
known bugs)?
You can do what you want with AB2 (as you know :) but don't leave the most
important things only for competition, I don't want to see a MS-like program
on Amiga (the MS staff takes as first priority task the beautiness of the
os/programs instead of the robustness and functionality), because I use
Amiga to stay away from MS-stuff, and it's related problems...
Having a greater speed in AB2 is really good, we can do progs that can run
better on a real Amiga and even better on an emulated one, but I think is
secondary in front of the bugfixing/improving task.
Please don't take me the wrong way, I'm not judging anyone (but MS :) but I
want only to express my wish in the development of AB2, also if I don't
count more than nothing because I'm not actually using it (well, I don't use
Blitz too ATM), but I will use it when I can have some time to dedicate.
So this is just an opinion, let me know what do you think about, maybe I've
understood you wrongly (probably).

Bye,
Berga

For new features i dont know (noone do suggestions except porting to PPC).
For bugfixes:
Some Users who use AB2 know if they write me a report (program i see the
failure)i fix it in 2-3 Days.But these reports are very rare.My speedtests
for example motived Thilo to use the optimizer he get some bugs with his
code but now i send him a hopefully running version.

Seem that noone New use AB2 because all think a emulatet stuff is not trendy
and can not do the same job that a native thing do.You know the PPC Port
sugestions ?Too much work too less advantages.I notice that there are much
less Blitz users as for 1 Year,David seem also give up AB2.

Fast and stable solutions that run AmigaOS are out too but all leave the
amiga.And these few User that buy a exotic PPC i dont think to motivate
developers to do something on AMiga.
 
So i think it maybe help to show that you loose not much speed when using
emulations and even with a good JIT optimized compiler you can be faster
than other native solutions.BTW:68k JIT is simular to JAVA or .net 

Emulations are in my eyes better than originals.I can use from windows CD as
floppy (UDF) can use sb-live Soundfounts/effects etc.Also winuae hardfiles
are more handy to backup than a whole real drive.files are cached automatic
no need for fda that i remove from my real amiga because of instable
Have better debugging features (winuae buildin debugger ..)   

BTW: adding registervars is just easy if i am not too lazy it take only 5
Hours.
if no problems occur see it next week 
How it should work:

The command addreg add the pointer to the var in a 8 entry table (for 4
regs).and also add a free register num

every time a variable (only local/global vars work (no types)))it look if
the var 
is a register var if so it write the code 

fmove.x fpvarreg,fpreg 

If not it write standard load code

fmove.s var(a5),fpreg.This increase speed on all Amigas but especially on
X86 JIT
because of byteswapping.

I found out that on the portet DSP code 57 regloads (4 vars) of 144
Instructions can safe time.So it give a speedincrease of ca 30% enough to
do the simple job but if maybe a PPC can 30% faster with native Code or X86
with native code thats too much work for the effect.The reached result is
the same but of course not trendy

I only begin developing on Amiga when i am sure that i get needed speed
and hardware availibility (The born of X86 JIT was my born of motivation to
use AMigaOS) 
Because solutions for other platforms i dont like so i stay forever on
AmigaOS
regardless if Amiga is mega out or not.I have all apps i need here and even
better i can enhance as i like

Since noone want release AB2 stuff and if someone need something new for AB2
he can always ask me if i plan this or have already done.Also if he found a
bug.I send then versions only to interestet users

Yes always the same all unecessary Stuff add to a Program but the usefull
stuff is not add.If AB2 is comercial i can say thats strategec to sell
later Version but so i can say comes soon.And soon mean hopefully not the
same as the PPC Guys  mean with soon

I add two tooltyppe for this one when open normal and one when you open when

You get the error because statements and functions use 'local' variables
that are cleared when you exit the statement/function, you must tell the 
statement it can use your dimmed variable with the shared command...

Date: Thursday, 22th August 2002

Hi Blitz2 and AmiBlitz2 users!
I used AmiBlitz 2.23 under WinUAE 0.8.21 Release 4.
Unfortunately when I launched the Help for a token it crashed, so I have downloaded the full AmiBlitz2 version 2.25 package; i have extracted the dir from the archive and I have overwritten the AmiBlitz2 environment into my Blitz2 drawer.
First there are only two libs that clashes at number 50, both are the RiDisAsm.obj, one is placed in the REDBlitzLibs drawer and the other is placed into the TobyLibs drawer: may I delete one of these?
If the answer is yes, which of these can be deleted?
The second problem I have encountered is that if I launch the MenuED prog from Blitz2 or AmiBlitz2 it appears and runs properly, but when I click on Exit MenuED closes and put on my WB a requester with a misunderstandly message: I click on OK to close the requester and the Blitz environment is blocked!
The same behaviour happens if I launch MenuED alone from WB: when I click on Exit the strange requester appears and when I click on OK the workbench is blocked!
I have appreciate the different higlight of the comments but I wish in the further versions of AmiBlitz2 that will come it will be possible to select the colours for the comments: this because I want the tokens in white!
At the moment I have no other bug to report to Bernd.
I want to ask To Bernd why it is impossible to run AmiBlitz2 on an Amiga that hasn't a fpu: will you never develop a non-fpu version of AmiBlitz?
Thanks Bernd for AmiBlitz2 and many greetings from Milan, Italy!

You need here the original file from RWE or newest (from 2.26) RED_HELP
RED_HELP.rx files
copy to blitz2:redhelp.Dont use the fixed version for BB2 on Davids Page !

Dont forget to activate the script bit

Wy not use 2.26:Newer version are better versions

If you have problems use
always the newest version.You need only replace blitz2:ped blitz2:amiblitz2
blitz2:acidlibs blitz2:deflibs and blitz2:dbug/reddebugger to upgrade to
newest if you have no special libs.

If you use special deflibs rename your deflibs to mydeflibs and activate the
tooltype libfile=blitz2:mydeflibs to load your own deflibs that clash with
the default.Notice in right window the deflibsname you load.  

When doing this you can avoid to copy the amiblitz.info file so all newer
versions can work

I think this problem is because in the background there is still a window.
You can switch on the Tooltype backdrop or use a hotkey tool that can switch
windows to background and foreground

From: Tony Rolfe <edgewater@...>
Date: 08-17-02 05:41:32
Subject: @{b}Font-Sensitive GadTools@{ub}

Hi,

Does anyone have any experience with writing  a GadTools interface 
allowing for proportional fonts?

I understand all ablou using TextLength_ to get the length of a string of 
text, but have dificulty implementing it in an elegant way.

For example, I have a Text Gadget which I want to create empty and 
then plug the text into it after creating the gadget list.    I know that there 
will be 10 characters going into it, but don't know what yet.

If I create the text gadget GTText with a size allowing for the maximum 
width of the string (10 x "W") this looks silly because there is a heap of 
white space after the last character.   If I make it smaller than this I run 
the risk of overflowing the actual gadget.

Any thoughts on this area would be appreciated.

Cheers

Tony

Yes, gadtools rule 8-)

You better use TextExtent_ in this way:

TextExtent_ *screenpointer\RastPort,&string$,lengthofstring,textvalues.TextExtent

Where *screenpointer is a pointer to the screen where your app is running, string$ is 
the string to be examined, lengthofstring is the length of the string(or less if you 
want) and the last is where the result of the function will arrive. So after doing 
this textvalues\te_Width contains the width of the string. This does work with 
proportional fonts.

Can`t see any other way to predict the size, the way you do it is fool proof as it 
will at least not write beyond the gadget. Mui gadgets also look like this often, 
lots of space and little text, you can`t have it all ;-) Live with it I`d say.

It's not a limitation of MUI. There are a couple of flags that can be set in MUI
which force resizing of the gadget to the length of the text. eg.

MUISet obj,#MUIA_Text_SetMin,True,#MUIA_Text_SetMax,True

would ensure that your gadget is always the same size as the text it contains.

Better having more space than not enough space. 

Also consider this - who is to say that W is the widest 
character? I thinnk there is some way to get the width 
of the font, which for variable width fonts is the 
width of the widest character. Maybe. 

If you want a look at some code for doing this, have a 
look at my Dir2HTML program. The source is in there, it 
might be useful.

As an aside, is there some way I can dynamically alter the graphic

You could just mean calling your resize routine (copy current gadget contents, free, 
create with new size, restore contents, re-activate gadget) every keypress.

AFAIK there is no way to get the OS to do this automatically.

There should be a function there for setting the value. GTSetNumber or GTSetInteger. And do you mean that the manual says GTSetAttrs does not work (sorry, been so long since I looked at it :) ?

I'm just converting from MenuLib to GTMenuLib

Everything seems OK except that with MenuLib, I could simply toggle 
between a menu showing "Reconcile Mode" and "Edit Mode" by setting 
the menuitem to the appropriate value.

With GTMenuLib this does not change the menu.

Adding a CreateMenuStrip doesn't work eithet and adding 
CreateMenuStrip plus SetMenu gives two items in the menue, one for 
each value.   Looping through adds one menu item each time.

What am I doing wrong??

A trasparent screen is not possible to get, so i advice you to use the ChangeVPBitMap() which works
with viewports and is good for double and triple buffering. See the autodocs...

Cybergraphics can only blit from screen to screen.If a use a only a bitmap
it use not the blitter so its slow.With P96 it work 

If want to play a animation on the wb it must render to the screen and then
if read copy with the blitter to the workbenchwindow

Why not open a super-bitmap which is for example twice the height of your games 
display and then switch the visable area between the two halves in your game-

Subject: @{b}illogical freeze at simple line.@{ub}


this complete open source package 
is my attempt at making a
2d strategy game like civilization,
with as much user friendliness as possible,
ie: without too much work to produce more units.

but recently I get a very illogical freeze
on a very simple line.

the compiler has nothing to say about it,
and runs without problem.

the program cycle does not loop forever,
as most "freezes" do,
  but it just totally stops at that line.
the debugger gets innefective afterwards,
and I can't quit the now "dead" program.

the line position is at the first IF after:
.mov 

the wierd thing is that this line
has always worked before.

before this stopping line is processed,
the game has just highlighted the players first unit
with a bright grey image, so you could search
for 'grey' to follow the program towards the stopping line.

I will be very glad if someone figures out
why this happens, as I was very motivated
in adding features to the game,
untill this thing appeared. :(

also, since it is open source,
you can do whatever you want with it.
look at the readme for details.

Ok, it is a matter of timing, but I have tried at different times over the

Subject: @{b}More of my antics with Blitz.@{ub}

Hi,

Folks, my next project (current?) is not too difficult in theory, but there
are some things I would like to do to "tweak" its working.

Overview:

This program is run.
It reads the ENV() variable.

An ENV() is set/modified by a program.

This program notices the change.
Reads the new data and updates what is needed.

(it is the first part about detecting the change, which I don't know how to
do easily)

Could anyone please help me?

Cya!

Only way I could think of doing it would be to have a timer function
somewhere that gets executed every so often and checks for changes.

I don't know if there is a Blitz command for getting the number of
milliseconds the computer has been switched on or not, but it'd be a
question of storing the millisecs value in a variable, then running a loop
checking to see whether the new millisecs value is higher than the one you
stored plus your interval, for example:

       msecs = getmilliseconds()

       repeat
             msecs2 = getmilliseconds()
       until msecs2 > msecs + 2000

       [code to act on change here]

2000 is 2 seconds (1000 millisecs to a second)

This all depends on there being a getmilliseconds() type command for Blitz.

Cheers,
GazChap.

you could try using file notification, you just put in a check in your main routine and the
system tells your program when the file has been changed, iirc David McMinn told me
how to do it a couple of years ago, try the list archives...

Or you use in your messageloop  case #IDCMP_INTUITICKS that give you 10

Why do you need a ToolsDaemon replacement ? Have you patched your
version of ToolsDaemon to 2.2 ? The patch is available on the aminet.
Just do a ToolsDaemon search. It works fine for me on WinUAE with OS3.9.

I'm not sure about DirWork since I dont use it. But Dopus4.x and
DiskMaster are now freely available.

You have nothing to screw up since it does not work properly at the
moment for you. You should make a back up before patching it. :)

Make sure that any CD is in the drive before you start up WinUAE, then 
you can change CD's and use them like normal.    The only thing is that 
the CD name does not change on the Workbench screen (at least mine 
don't).

To get 3.5 up, create adf files from your 3.1 disks then do the install in 
the normal way, then install 3.5 from the CD.

I dont know if you have the luxury of a cd burner or not. But I just
booted my real amiga's hard drive cd backup from WinUAE. I then
transfered the files from the booted cd to the hard drive file which I
created with WinUAE. I then re-installed P96 with the WinUAE gfx
drivers. I did not use any adf's to set up WinUAE. The hard drive file
I created is 700,000,000 bytes which works out to 667MB. I was then
able to fit it on to 700mb cd with WinUAE on it. It can boot from the
CD. Make sure you have the correct paths in your WinUAE config so that
WinUAE will boot from the HD file on the cd. I made a coaster on my
1st attempt. :)

When you use a 0.8.17 you need run the uaediskchange program.In 0.8.21 all
should work like real amigacd rom with for example amicdfs. that i use

BTW: A new version come soon with fixed Cd-Rom.

If someone with problems with cd-rom and like to test i can give a link so
he can download the stable beta

Thats the mountfile i use

/* AmiCDROM filesystem V1.15 */

 Handler     = SYS:L/cdrom-handler
 Stacksize   = 20000
 Priority    = 5
 GlobVec     = -1

Subject: @{b}MUI Llist & NList@{ub}

Hi there,

I've added both List and NList in the title since the problem is the same with
both (bar the tag name).

If I create a List & Listview (or NList equivalents), whether they be simple
lists or multicolumn lists, and then try and use #MUIM_List_GetEntry the target
string/type is always empty. eg:-

Deftype gl.s

item.l=muiget(list,#MUIA_List_GetEntry_Active)
MuiDoMethod 2,#MUIA_List_GetEntry,item,&gl
NPrint gl

prints an empty string. If I understand the autodocs correctly, gl should be
populated with the contents of the selected list entry.

Similarly, for a 3 column list:-

NewType .glt
    col1.s
    col2.s
    col3.s
End NewType

DefType .glt gl

item.l=muiget(list,#MUIA_List_GetEntry_Active)
MuiDoMethod 2,#MUIA_List_GetEntry,item,&gl
NPrint gl\col1," ",gl\col2," ",gl\col3

just prints empty strings.

What am I doing wrong?

All the best

Maybe you don't have an active entry?

Also, by taking &gl you are getting the address of the start of the string, not the 
address of the string pointer. You probably need to do something like this:

DefType.l gl
item.l=muiget(list,#MUIA_List_GetEntry_Active)
MuiDoMethod 2,#MUIA_List_GetEntry,item,&gl
If gl<>0
    NPrint Peek$(gl)

I've tried that, too. No difference (BTW - I assume you meant Peek$(&gl)).

Actually - there is a difference with that one. If I double click entries
repeatedly, it seems to get filled with random values completely unrelated to
the list. eg. One of the (legible) random outputs was actually the CLI
arguments as passed by Blitz (and not used by this program - it's a carry over
from another program I was working on). In other words, &gl seems to get filled
with random memory areas :o/

No, I really do mean Peek$(gl). But I could easily be wrong.

If you look at the example in the MUI_List.doc autodoc, you can see it uses a pointer 
variable (*fib) and when it gets the item from the list it passes the address of the 
pointer (&fib). So the GetEntry method only returns a pointer to your data, not the 
actual data itself.

This also implies that it might be that you need to make sure that the contents of your 
strings are preserved since the list class is only handling a list of pointers to data 
and not the data itself. I'm not sure about that though.

But I guess both those points are subject to how you put items into the list.

So - how is it you set up and fill the lists?

Hi there, David

On 22-Aug-02, you said:

DM> 
DM> So - how is it you set up and fill the lists?

Well, that's another problem in itself. I would prefer to use MUIs methods to do
this (#MUIM_List_InsertSingle), but if I do this the way the autodocs prescribe
I get the last entry in the list copied to all previous entries (meaning the
identical entry is repeated x number of times). This happens whether I use a
single type or an array, ensuring that each entry is preserved. (nb - this is
for a multi-column list)

As it happens, In my current working example, I'l using the EFMUILib command
MUIInsertSingle to populate the list, which seems to work in what it does, but
also appears to contain a bug, thus:-

Create an MUI List and Listview (NList if you prefer - it doesn't matter).

Create a couple of other objects (perhaps buttons) and arrange them all into a
group(or groups - whatever you please - as long as you end up with one large
group - maybe the one you attach to the window).

OK - now give the final group a Frame with a frame title.

Display the window, and everything is fine. However, populate the list with
MUIInsertSingle (using enough entries to ensure that list needs to be scrolled
to see some of the entries) and all the frame titles are corrupted (you may
need to refresh the window to see this).

Unfortunately, this is the first time I've had to use a multicolumn list, and
whilst I could get around my problem by maintaing an array which matches the
list entry for entry, and simply reading the data from the array using
#MUIA_List_GetEntry_Active (or even #MUIA_List_Active), I really want to avoid
having to use a separate array.

This is part of a bigger project, and I am not responsible for other parts of
the code, so the need to keep shared variables to a minimum (which wouldn't be
possible using arrays) is of paramount importance.

Somewhere, it seems as though MUI data is leaking into other memory.

Having said all that, I would assume that however the list is populated, MUI
will still keep the data in the same format internally, and should feed it back
in the prescribed format.

OK. Is there any way to get access to the internals of a mui list? Then you could see what is 
actually being stored.

Hmm, it could be the same bug. It sounds like the MUI lib is not taking copies of the strings 
or something like that (i.e. it's just copying the pointer), and so if anything is done with 
the temporary string buffer it all dies.

But if you have already tried keeping a copy of the strings in an array, that would seem to 
indicate that wasn't the problem.

Didn't someone update the EFMUILib recently? ISTR it was, but I could be wrong - maybe you 
could try the original version?

Yeah, I thought you would, but if the MUI List class is just a general storage mechanism 
which only stores lists of pointers (which it seems to be from the autodoc, and would also 
make sense - since you only pass pointers to the insert method, not sizes and using pointers 
means the list can store anything it needs) it becomes a bit messy in Blitz (since it does 
most of your memory management for you).

I remember Rob Hutchinson had some awful trouble with multicolumn lists in MUI (using the 
NList) but I think that was because he was using entry and exit hooks to automatically 
allocate the strings he passed (so the list would effectively make it's own copy of the data 
to be stored and then only store the pointer to said data).

At least that's what I remember. And the MUIA_List_ConstructHook looks like it describes that 
too - although it looks like there is a pre-defined one for strings. I don't know enough 
about the EFMUILib to say whether it uses that automatically, or if you have to specify it, 
or if the EFMUILib does the copying - but the list class sounds like it definately only 
stores pointers and there needs to be something extra to manage the memory.

Sorry for not being more help, I guess most of this reply is related to single column stuff. 
The small parts about multicolumn listviews I can find in the autodoc don't explain much 
(such as what structure do you use for the items in a multicolumn listview?).

I spent ages trying to figure out exactly the same "trashed list" and empty 
string problems.
There is an archive on aminet( I think!) that shows how to use multilist MUI 
gadgets.
David hit the nail right on the head..it`s upto the programmer to allocate 
memory and store the string in it, then pass a pointer to that to 
MUI..pointing to a string variable is useless unless you never change the 
contents of that variable !

I get the same problems with List - NList has more functionality, but it comes
at a price. (see reply to next para)

There is a pre-defined DisplayHook for Multicolumn lists, which is used (semi-)
automatically. The ListHook On/Off command enables/disables the display hook
for each list at creation time (meaning that I have to remember to switch it
on/off depending on the type of list I'm using). For MultiColumn lists it is
necessary to use a MUIListHook On command before creation. For single column,
MUIListHook Off. I fell foul of this at first :o)

But regardless of what does the copying (Whether it be EFMUI as I'm using it, or
MUI using an MUIDoMethod (which AFAIK simply passes an MUI argument structure
to MUI - meaning EFMUI actually does very little) - MUI should still manage
it's own memory. Using an MUI method to fill the list should ensure that the
contents can be retrieved the same way.

From my experience, it should be possible to write an entire MUI application in
Blitz with little more than the MUIDoMethod command, but it seems that's
entirely the case. Things are also compilcated further by the inconsistent
approach to MUI classes (some can react to explicit strings, some require
pointers to string, and at least one class that I've used - the cycle gadget -
requires a pointer to a pointer).

And don't I know it. I'm trying to play safe by simply using strings at the
moment, but as I've previously mentioned, even that gets a bit hairy, and
doesn't seem to work as it should (at least not the way I'm interpreting the
autodocs and doing it myself).

Guess I'll have to keep on experimenting (and crashing) until something works.

Perhaps Bernd could take a look at EFMUI when he gets a chance to at least try
and clean it up (or supplement the guide with more detailed help). I believe
the source is available in the archive (but I couldn't swear to it)

Aint it typcial!
I can`t for the life of me remember the archive name, (can`t even remember 
the authors name). My Miggy is still boxed up outta the way whilst I`m 
finishing of some DIY, so I can`t check it right now :(

What I do remember though, is that it was a simple multi column list example 
that showed howto use construct & destruct hooks for MUI, and it fried my 
brain for ages until I saw the light..I even managed to fix the bug in the 
example that bombed the program out on exit !
The only other thing that springs to light is that I maybe got it outta one 
of the mailing list archives off Davids site, can`t see anything on Aminet 
that looks right.
If you still can`t find it, gimme a shout and I`ll unbox the miggy and mail 
it to you.

Nope - I can't see anything on Aminet either. I've searched the BlitzList
archives, and the only thing I can find that looks promising is some examples
posted by Rob Hutchinson circa May 2000, but his attachments aren't included in
the archive.

That said, if you get a minute, and you don't mind, well, y'know - would ya?

Subject: @{b}non draggable screen.@{ub}


I really need a screen to be non dragable
in a game,
 so that when you hold down left mousebutton
on the title bar,
and move your mouse downwards,
it won't drag the screen along.

I saw the screentags command in my manual,
but I only saw a -dragable- option,
and I do not even know how to use
screen tags,
so I decided to annoy you with this
probably easy problem.

I think it's as easy as setting the -dragable- option to FALSE?

Anyone confirm this?

I just reinstalled my blitz archive on my amiga, but when I compile an app with the debugger

I'm not sure of his current address, but if you go to
http://www.blitzbasic.com or http://www.blitzcoder.com the chances are he is
on the members list somewhere.

His current email AFAIK is loki.sd@...

Using your example this is the result I got when I enterd this sentence.
In the morning we will take this computer apart.   ; Input
In the mornng we will take this computer apart.    ; Output

This did not happen before the enforcer hit fix. I tested it with the
previous .obj and it works fine.

hope you don't mind this simple question.

how do you add a version number to your program?
so that the Version dos command displays it.

I tried:

Version$="sillybilly 1.0"

but that doesn't do anything.

Simply set a variable (any name) with the string: "$VER: sillybilly 1.0
(12.08.2002)"
example:
Version$="$VER: sillybilly 1.0 (12.08.2002)"

I tried that too.
didn't work.

when I use the version command,
it always displays this:

BD-GFXLibrary v1.4 (18/12/1997)

and not anything I have set.

maybe a library my exe use
overrides my attempts at setting it,
and displays its own version info only?

Yes, you're right. So you should use the hard way :)
Add the following lines on top of your prog:

Even
Dc.b   "PrgName 1.6 (16.05.2002)",0
Even

But i haven't my amiga in front of me now, so maybe the Dc.b may be
substituted with another assembly instruction, but try it anyway. I'll try
to give you the right solution (if this don't work) just when i can turn on
my amy.

Which works most of the time, but since Blitz stores variables at the end of the
source, and there is at least one lib that inserts its' own version string in
the exe, it doesn't always work.

I asked this a while ago, and the response I got works EVERY time:-

at the top of your code, add:-

JMP strt
Dc.b "$VER: My Prof V1.0 © Me (19/06/02)",0
Even

.strt
Rest of your program.....

I can't remember who it was that gave me this solution, so can't properly
accredit it. Sorry :o/

Yup! Forget my email, this is the right solution! With my code you should
get a great guru!
My memory is getting worst :)

Hi there,

Can someone give me an example of using a listhook for a multi-column list using
MUINList. The docs aren't much help :o/

Thanks.

All the best

It depends on what you want to do with them, but if you want the pen numbers you can do something like this:

(Note I cannot test this so it could be and probably is wrong)

*scr.Screen = Peek.l(Addr Screen(my_screen))
*dri.DrawInfo = GetScreenDrawInfo_(*scr)
background.w = Peek.w(*dri\dri_Pens + #BLOCKPEN * Sizeof.w)
foreground.w = Peek.w(*dri\dri_Pens + #DETAILPEN * Sizeof.w)
FreeScreenDrawInfo_ *scr,*dri


If you just want to open a window with the same colours for your own menus you should be able to use values of -1 and the system will use the default values.

Erm, well sort of...

You can use them but you will be limited to workbench's palette (256 colours)
I would probably be better to get the picasso96 SDK if you want true 16/24 bit

the command WPlot requires x and y position,
and a third color register value.

does true color have about 16000000 color registers?

if so, can I type
WPlot 30,20,7382959
and it will work?

or how else do I use
the color register field with true color?

The w.... Instructions are the amigaos Wraps and AmigaOS support no real 24
bit

Setting the value in the palette entry 128 
and do a wplot 30,20,128

From winuae P96 i know that every 24 bit drawcommand read the  RGB Data from
the palette entry and copy this to GFX Buffer so you can change the value
every time you do a wplot /wline

If you want realy 24 bit you need cybergraphics.library but i think this
have only writepixelarray like  wblit instruction no lines or writepixels

From: Bernd Roesch <berndroesch1@...>
Date: 08-04-02 21:35:28
Subject: @{b}Writetype instruction for writing a type+string@{ub}

I have add a writetype and readtype instruction.
It work only with AB2.27 and above compilers 

but can save you lots of work

If someone find it usefull and want test i can forward a version

Thats new in 2.27

News:
     writetype/readtype command add to load/save a complete Type
     Use only with this compiler Version
     stop commands are ignored in release builds
     No error no crash now
debug of extern programs
     Type DEBUG as first command in your programm and you can debug
     it when you have a plugin or start from WB or cli
     Notes: dont let such a program reach a stop when ped is not run
            Also the source of this program must be visible in ped
            or you see no (wrong Source) in reddebug

BTW:  Ped(AMiblitz) can now debug since this version with reddebug


Fixes: fpu optimizer fix:
       sa.l = a.l-testfunc{Str$("test")}
       does put fpu regs illegal to stack
       (because AB2 think ustr$ use FPU)
                                     Thanks to Steffen Nitz for the example
Code
reddebug 2.53 shows now no enforcer hits (i hope)
              show Programmcounter in dissasembler window
              Changing programcounter update windows
