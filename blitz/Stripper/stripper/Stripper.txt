                    v1.01 - completed 28rd Feb 1997.

So you've got Blitz Basic and you've got the manual and you've got a few
docs,  but what you really want is a list of commands to use, not oodles
of descriptions about what they do, just the basic format, well Stripper
is here to give you just that.

Note:   For  Stripper  to  work, you must have "Blitz2:" assigned to the
correct drawer, otherwise Stripper will not load either of the files.

Stripper will load in either your Acidlibs or Deflibs file and literally
strip  out  all the commands it finds in there.  This means that if your
libs are updated, simply running Stripper will produce a bang up-to-date
list of all the commands in there.

Stripper is CLI only, the syntax is:

                   Stripper <0|1|2> <output filename>

  where 0 specifies Deflibs ROM Commands
        1     "     Deflibs Blitz Commands
  and   2     "     Acidlibs Blitz Commands

<output  filename>  is the name of the text file you wish to create that
contains  the  newly-generated  list.  You'll want to create three files
altogether,  one  for  each  of the modes, and you can always join files
together if you wish.

The  format  of  the  file  is  very simple, on each line (after a brief
header) there's the command, a tab space and the syntax.  To format this
to  something  more  presentable in CygnusEd, simply erase the tabs from
the  left hand side until all the arguments are lined up, then print the
list out to another file, ensuring you have "Tabe to Spaces" highlighted
in the print confirmation requester.
