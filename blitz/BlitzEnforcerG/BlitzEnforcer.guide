  @{b}The Blitz Basic Enforcer Hit Guide@{ub}

  @{i}(Started 25 July 1998 by James L Boyd) @{ui}

  This file is simply a list of things which cause the Enforcer
  tool to register "hits" when using Blitz Basic.

  So far,I've just listed some well-known (among regular Blitz users
  anyway) hits,and I've gone through a couple of the libraries trying
  each command (what fun ;) so this is @{i}not @{ui}a comprehensive list,though
  maybe it'll grow a little if others contribute.

  @{fg shine}@{bg fill}Enforcer@{fg text}@{bg back} is a freely available software development tool by
  Mike Sinz,which keeps a look out for programs accessing memory
  they don't have permission to access.Programs which do this are
  considered system-unfriendly and may even crash the system.These
  illegal accesses are known as "Enforcer hits".

  You can get Enforcer from Aminet.

  Hint : For ease of use if you don't know what you're doing (like me),
  edit the Enforcer's icon tooltypes so that the FILE tooltype reads :

  FILE=CON:0/0/640/100/HIT/AUTO/WAIT

  This will bring up any Enforcer hits in a CLI window.If you just run
  it in the default setup,you just get an inexplicable slowdown whenever
  there's a hit (remember,I don't know what I'm doing ;)

  If you know of, or discover any Enforcer hits not listed
  in this guide, please contact me (James Boyd) at :

    @{fg shine}ohmygolly@hotmail.com@{fg text}

  Please give clear details of how to create the hit!

  I'll reply as soon as possible,but it's a library-based hotmail
  account, so it may take a couple of weeks :(

@node "Debug" "LES Debugger v2.1"

  @{fg shine}@{bg fill}LES Debugger v2.1@{fg text}@{bg back}

For a start,the Debugger itself causes TONS (!!!!!!!!!!) of hits!

Don't have the debugger on when Enforcer's running (or vice-versa!) - it'll
slow things RIGHT down! ("BYTE-READ" and "WORD-READ" hits all over the
place!).

Maybe depends on what your program's doing,but even the tiniest program causes
the debugger to go wild!

I'm using the LES Blitz Debugger v2.1,but a wild guess tells me it won't be
the only one to cause hits!

Actually,thinking about it,it's probably to do with the Debugger having to
read values from your program's memory,so I suppose it can't be avoided...

So probably the best way to do things if you want to use Enforcer @{i}and @{ui}Blitz is
to develop your program with the Debugger ON and Enforcer OFF,then when you're
confident that everything's OK,turn Enforcer ON and compile with the Debugger
OFF...@{i}sigh...@{ui}

@node "TED" "SuperTED 2.24 Prefs"

  @{fg shine}@{bg fill}SuperTED 2.24@{fg text}@{bg back}

In SuperTED 2.24 (from Aminet),calling up the Prefs window causes several hits
("WORD-READ"),as does clicking on the Text and Token colour choice gadgets in
this window ("WORD-READ" and "LONG-READ").
@endnode

@node "Pathreq" "ASLPathRequest$"

  @{fg shine}@{bg fill}ASLPathRequest$@{fg text}@{bg back}

Causes hits when it appears ("LONG-READ" and "BYTE READ"),and also on
exit,unless Cancel was pressed ("BYTE-WRITE" and "LONG-WRITE")!
@endnode

@node "Getstr" "RTEZGetString"

  @{fg shine}@{bg fill}RTEZGetString@{fg text}@{bg back}

Causes a hit if the Cancel gadget is hit,or an empty string returned.

There's a little note in the reqtools Developer autodocs,which mentions this
problem and how to get around it,but I'm guessing that Neil O'Rourke, author
of NeilsReqToolsLib (part of Blitz 2.1) never noticed it...it can probably be
worked around by using the library directly,if you know how to do that
("BYTE-WRITE")...

I'd recommend the hit-free GetString$ from FuzziesReqLib,except that cuts the
last letter off the string and sticks a "T" at the front!
@endnode

@node "Fontreq" "RTEZFontRequest"

  @{fg shine}@{bg fill}RTEZFontRequest@{fg text}@{bg back}

Causes hits ("LONG-READ" and "BYTE-READ") when Cancel is clicked on...
@endnode

@node "Lock" "RTLockWindow / RTUnLockWindow"

  @{fg shine}@{bg fill}RTLockWindow / RTUnLockWindow@{fg text}@{bg back}

Not sure about this one.Using it as detailed in the NeilsReqToolsLib docs,you
get a massive Enforcer hit.The docs for the command to lock the window
(RTLockWindow) say : 

    WinLock=RTLockWindow(Window#)

When you use "RTUnlockWindow 0,winlock" to unlock it,this causes
"LONG-READ","WORD-READ",and "Alert !!" hits.The hits seem NOT to occur when
you make winlock a Long variable,ie :

    WinLock.l=RTLockWindow(Window#)

and @{i}then @{ui}unlock using RT@{b}Un@{ub}lockWindow 0,winlock as above.However,I used these
commands in "BeatBox 2" at one point,and although I never used Enforcer at the
time,Curt Esser (the other  BeatBox 2 guy ;) said that he got an Enforcer hit
(or was it a crash?),yet it worked  without any problems on my setup... and I
can't remember if I used winlock or winlock.l

It looks as if I just used winlock,so maybe this command's OK,but beware -
make sure you make winlock a LONG variable! And then stay paranoid ;)
@endnode

@node "NTSC" "ForceNTSC"

  @{fg shine}@{bg fill}ForceNTSC@{fg text}@{bg back}

Causes "WORD-WRITE" hit.
@endnode

@node "PAL" "ForcePAL"

  @{fg shine}@{bg fill}ForcePAL@{fg text}@{bg back}

Another "WORD-WRITE" hit.
@endnode

@node "Aarons" "AaronsIconLib"

  @{fg shine}@{bg fill}AaronsIconLib@{fg text}@{bg back}

  Wow,just about every command in this library causes an Enforcer hit
  if it doesn't get the info you ask for!

  And it's not hit-related,but check this out,from the docs :

  deftool$.w=IconDefTool$(icon#)

  First of all,we have a string which is also a word - deftool$.w ! Hmm...

  Then the command itself,when tokenised,is displayed as

    "IconDefTool tool$"

  So there's no $ after IconDefTool,and it doesn't want the icon number in
  brackets,it just wants a tool string (though how you can give it a string
  when this command's supposed to @{i}return @{ui}the string giving the default
  tool of the icon,I don't know).

  To finish it all off,it plain doesn't work - it seems that this command
  is trying to return a string,eg "C:ppmore" into a word variable! Oh,how
  I laughed...

  I think I'll be avoiding this library from now on!

  Use RITooltypesLib for icon-reading...though I've still to check it with
  Enforcer ;)
@endnode

@node "Qangle" "QAngle"

  @{fg shine}@{bg fill}QAngle@{fg text}@{bg back}

  Not sure about this - it was reported on the Blitz list that
  this MAY have an Enforcer hit,but for some reason,it won't even
  tokenise in my Blitz setup,so I can't test it...just be aware that
  if you use this command,you should test it (well,you should check
  your whole program,but you see what I mean ;)
