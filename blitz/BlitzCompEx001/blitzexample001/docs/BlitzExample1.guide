 INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

This is the start of a series of Blitz Basic 2 begginers examples,
which will build up a collection of procedures for you to use
in your programs if you wish, with no restrictions.

I hope these are of help to somebody, and I would appreciate
an E-Mail if you find them useful :))) Ta :)

for the Amiga.

What we do: games, music, infomation, utilities, 3D & 2D Images,
+ much more

@NODE "DISTRO" "Distribution"

 DISTRIBUTION
-------------------------

The archive and documentation are Copyright material, but you may
use the examples in anyway you wish. You may also use the includes
in your own programs if you wish, I grant you full right to,
with no restrictions (although a mention wouldn`t go a miss, hehehe).

Allthough I do think that the procedures are more for the Novice,
as using most of them in your code unmodified would be innefficient,
and probably make the Exe sizes bigger than doing certain stuff
manually.. But thats upto you. :)

@NODE "SUPP" "Support"

 SUPPORT
---------------

All the future updates and additions to the series can be found on
AmiNet in dev/basic or on our Home Page:

             http://www.satanicdreams.freeserve.co.uk

I will try and do a few a month, and get them distributed ASAP.

Please mail me with FeedBack,. I will reply,. and I`ll know that
someone is finding use of these examples :) Or sign the guestbook
on our site :)

@NODE "PROC" "Procedure usages"

 USING贩THE贩INCLUDES
-----------------------------------

As should be aparent the includes should only be included once,
at the top of your source code (In most cases).

@{b}ChangeBitMap.BB2@{ub}:

Include: INCDIR <Include_Dir_Path/>:INCLUDE "ChangeBitMap.BB2"
 Syntax: ChangeBitmap{BitMap}
   Type: Statement: Nothing is returned!
   Info: This procedure will switch the bitmap you are using,
         it makes the specified bitmap the currently use one,
         and directs all output to it.

  Usage: BitMap, is the bitmap #Number you wish to switch to,
         it should exist or your program will fail!


@{b}CreateCopL.BB2@{ub}:

Include: INCDIR <Include_Dir_Path/>:INCLUDE "CreateCopL.BB2"
 Syntax: CreateCopL{CopNumber,CopCols,CopType,OffSet,Customs,Others}
   Type: Statement: Nothing is returned!
   Info: This is an EVEN shorter way to open a CopList, it`s sort
         of in-between using: InitCopList CopList#[,type] and the
         full version syntax! It auto creates the depth for the amount
         of colours specified.

  Usage: This procedure has 4 parameters you must pass to it!

         CopNumber, is the CopList# number, this coplist should NOT
         already Exist or your program will fail!.

         CopCols, the amount of colours that you wish your coplist to
         be able to use! This MUST be a ^2 (Power of 2) IE: 
         2,4,8,16,32,64,128 or 256
         
         CopType, here you have a couple of choices:
            
            #CL_TypeA, Creates a LowRes copperlist with 
                       FMode0 in ECS.

            #CL_TypeB, Creates a LowRes copperlist with
                       FMode3 in AGA.

            #CL_TypeC, Creates a HiRes copperlist with
                       FMode3 in AGA.

            #CL_TypeD, Creates a Super copperlist with
                       FMode3 in AGA. I haven`t tested this,
                       and dont even know if it works!

         OffSet, this is how far down the physical screen your
                 coplist will be displayed in pixels.
                 The standard is 44.

            #CL_OffDef=44, set to default, 44 pixels.

         Customs, customs are used for copper `effects', such
                  as rainbows. Different customs should be used
                  for different types of coplists.

            #CL_NoCustoms, create NO customs at all.

            #CL_ECSCustoms, setup normal customs for ECS displays,
                            IE: #CL_TypeA.

            #CL_AGACustoms, setup normal customs for AGA displays,
                            IE: #CL_TypeB, #CL_TypeC or #CL_TypeD.
             
            #CL_SPCCustoms, for special displays with lots of effects.
             
         Others, only one other at the moment.

            #CL_NoSScrolling, disable the Smooth scrolling from your
                              coplist.

            #CL_NoExtras, specify no extras.

  Notes: I suggest you use the InitCopList command properly if you
         have problems with this routine.
             

@{b}CreateCDisplay.BB2@{ub}:

Include: INCDIR <Include_Dir_Path/>:INCLUDE "CreateCDisplay.BB2"
 Syntax: CreateCDisplay{CopLA,BitMapObj,PalObjNum,Others}
   Type: Statement: Nothing is returned!
   Info: This procedure will sort out your INITAL displaying for you!
         INITAL because you need only use it after opening a BitMap
         and using CreateCopL.
         
  Usage: This procedure has 4 parameters you must pass to it.

         CopLA, the coplist number, (IE: CopNumber from above).
                must exist! :)

         BitMapObj, the #Number of the bitmap object to display in
                    your coplist! You should open this yourself!
                    See Examples.

         PalObjNum, the palette #Number you wish to use with the
                    coplist and bitmap. You should initialize one
                    with InitPalette or you could load one with
                    LoadPalette.

         Others, you have 2 options here:

            #CD_DontDisplay, this will not display your coplist
                             after setting it up, and waits for
                             you to use DisplayOn.

            #CD_Display, this will switch your display ON after
                         setup, you wont need to specify 
                         DisplayOn after with this flag set!

(The above routines are due for a revamp already :) ahahaha,..
 check the rest of the series for updated procedures with memory
 checks and other additions.)


@ENDNODE

@NODE "ASCII" "Ascii files."

 THE贩INCLUDED贩ASCII贩FILES
----------------------------------------------

There are included in the archive, ASCII versions of the BB2
code. If for any reason the examples wont compile, try loading
the ASCII versions into the Blitz Editor and saving them over
the BB2 versions as BB2 saves.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "EXAM" "The Examples"

 THE贩EXAMPLES
-------------------------

There are 2 examples included in the package to help you with
the procedures, hopefully they will be good enough to show
you how to use them.

These are NOT commented really, as there is nothing hard to
understand in them. So it seemed useless to comment them at the
moment.

 OpenCopList.BB2, opens a coplist and moves the `Boing' ball shape
                  across it vertically. With bad double-buffering,
                  Ahahahaha! Oh well, more examples or PROPER 
                  double buffering will be released later.

 OpenCopList2.BB2, Hummmmmm!,.. this was just to show the scroll
                   command at work, although these examples were
                   PURELY for the purpose of showing you how to
                   open a coplist, not how the shapes commands
                   work, that will come later!
