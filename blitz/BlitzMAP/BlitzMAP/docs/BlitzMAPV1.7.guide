BlitzMAP is a map editor written for Blitz Basic programmers, for creating
background maps made up from 16*16 pixel tiles.

Any amiga running Workbench 2 or above. Fast RAM is also recommended.
BlitzMAP uses a 6 point font called smfont. It is included in this archive
and should be placed in your Fonts drawer or assign.

@{u}Draw@{uu}


After a shape has been selected from the shapes bank it may be positioned on
the map by clicking on the map screen using either mouse button. The current 
shape that was selected by that mouse button will be drawn.

The last 50 draw operations are stored and may be undone by either clicking 
on the Undo gadget, Right Clicking on the Draw gadget or by using the keyboard 
shortcut DELete key.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Fill" "Fill"
@NEXT "Cut"
@PREV "Draw"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Fill@{uu}


This allows you to drag a "rubberband" over an area of the map. This will then 
be filled by either the current LMB or RMB shape depending on which mouse button 
was held down to create the "rubberband".

The last 5 Fills are stored and may be undone by Right Clicking on the Fill gadget.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Cut" "Cut"
@NEXT "Paste"
@PREV "Fill"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Cut@{uu}


This allows you to grab an area of the map by dragging a "rubberband" over the 
required area with the LMB.

This area may then be @{"Pasted" LINK "Paste"} to another position on the map.


@ENDNODE

@NODE "Paste" "Paste"
@NEXT "Pick"
@PREV "Cut"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Paste@{uu}


This pastes a previously cut out area onto the map with the top left of the cut 
area being placed at the cursor position. Pastes are automatically clipped if 
they go over the edge of the map.

The last 5 paste operations are stored and may be undone by Right Clicking on 
the Paste gadget.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Pick" "Pick"
@NEXT "Zoom"
@PREV "Paste"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Pick@{uu}


This allows you to pick the current tile used for drawing straight from the map 
rather than scrolling through a large shape bank. Smiply click on the required 
tile with the required mouse button to select it.


@ENDNODE

@NODE "Zoom" "Zoom"
@NEXT "Undo"
@PREV "Pick"
@TOC "Features"
 
@{u}Zoom@{uu}


The map display may be reduced to 8*8 pixels or 4*4 pixels to allow more of the 
map to be viewed at any one time. All of the other functions will work in any of 
the zoom modes.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Undo" "Undo"
@NEXT "Resizing the map"
@PREV "Zoom"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Undo@{uu}


This gadget will undo the last 50 draw operations. The last 5 Fill or Paste 
operations are also stored and may be undone by Right Clicking on the 
appropriate gadget.

The three types of undo are independent so for example a fill can be undone 
even if some tiles have been drawn and an area has been pasted since the 
fill was done.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Resizing the map" "Resizing the map"
@NEXT "Clear"
@PREV "Undo"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Resizing the map@{uu}


The size option allows a new size for the map to be entered. Rows are added 
or removed from the bottom or the map, and columns are added or removed from 
the right. This is done without affecting any map data that has already been 
drawn, except for any rows or columns that areremoved, and additional areas 
are filled with the current LMB tile.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Clear" "Clear"
@NEXT "Shift"
@PREV "Resizing the map"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Clear@{uu}


This will clear a map by filling it with the currently selected LMB tile.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Shift" "Shift"
@NEXT "Values"
@PREV "Clear"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Shift@{uu}


This allows for the whole map to be moved in any direction without loss of data. 
This can be useful for centering up previously drawn data after a @{"resizing" LINK "Resizing the map"} 
operation has taken place.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Values" "Values"
@NEXT "Effects"
@PREV "Shift"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Values@{uu}


This allows for each tile to be given a unique number between 0-9999 
regardless of its position on the map. This can be useful for creating walls 
forexample, as any tile that is being used as a wall could be given a value 
of eg. 50. Then as long as the tile had a value of 50 your game would treat 
it as a wall regardless of the shape number of the tile.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Effects" "Effects"
@NEXT "Load"
@PREV "Values"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Effects@{uu}


This works is a similar way to @{"Values" LINK "Values"}, except that this 
allows a number from 0-9999 to be assigned to any position on the map regardless 
of which tile is displayed there. This may be useful for switches, as although 
each switch has the same tile shape, it can be identified by its unique effect 
number.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Load" "Load"
@NEXT "Save"
@PREV "Effects"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Load@{uu}


Either a previously saved map or just a shape bank may be loaded. 

If a previously saved map is loaded then all the associated files are 
automatically loaded as well.

If a shape bank is loaded then you are also asked for a palette file. This 
must be a palette saved from either Blitz or from a paint package such as 
DPaint.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Save" "Save"
@NEXT "Print"
@PREV "Load"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Save@{uu}


When a file is saved all the associated files are saved also. Therefore if 
you had created a map called "mymap" it would save the following files...

      mymap.map         ; the map data
      mymap.map.shp     ; the shapes 
      mymap.map.pal     ; the palette
      mymap.map.val     ; the values (saved even if they are all zero)
      mymap.map.eff     ; the effects (saved even if they are all zero)

Obviously, if your game doesn't require any of the files then they need not 
be used, however BlitzMAP will need all of these to be able to reload the 
map at a later date.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Print" "Print"
@NEXT "Full Screen Mode"
@PREV "Save"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Print@{uu}


The Print option is available from @{"Full Screen Mode" LINK "Full Screen Mode"} and will print 
out the area of the map that is currently being displayed on the screen.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Full Screen Mode" "Full Screen Mode"
@NEXT "Shape Grabber Mode"
@PREV "Print"
@TOC "Feaures"

@{u}Full Screen Mode@{uu}


This allows for a larger area of the map to be viewed and allows for the 
screen to be printed. However the drawing functions don't operate in this mode, 
although the display may be zoomed.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Shape Grabber Mode" "Shape Grabber Mode"
@NEXT "Square Cursor Colour"
@PREV "Full Screen Mode"
@TOC "Features"

@{u}Shape Grabber Mode@{uu}


This allows for a Lowres IFF image to be loaded and 16*16 pixel shapes to 
be grabbed from it.

The LMB creates a "rubberband" over the area to be cut. The shapes are 
added to the end of any shapes that are already loaded.

Note that if there are already some loaded shapes, the palette of the 
IFF image will be ignored as if the shapes are to be added to the current 
shape bank then they will have to share the same palette anyway. :)

Note that the IFF image must have the extension .iff

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Square Cursor Colour" "Square Cursor Colour"
@NEXT "Moving around the map"

@{u}Square Cursor Colour@{uu}


The colour of the Square Cursor may be changed from the Project menu. 
This is allow a suitably contrasting colour to be picked so it can 
easily be seen. :)

@{u}Moving around the map@{uu}


The map display may be scrolled in the following ways...

The map will move one tile at a time using the cursor keys.
When Shift is also held down it will move by one screen at a time,
and when Alt also is held down it will my by a quarter of a page
at a time.

Moving the mouse to the edges of the screen will also scroll the map.

Oh, and let me know how many bugs you can find. :)
