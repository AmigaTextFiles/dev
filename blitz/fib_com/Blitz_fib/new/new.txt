In order to make this code work with the integer optimizer it was necessary
to remove the For/While combination code which generates the main FDC/EDC
tables.

"fib_com_dat.ab2" saves a snapshot of the main FDC/EDC tables to file.

The new "fib_com.ab2" generates the FDC/EDC tables from the IncBin files
"fdc_file1" and "edc_file2".

The new size of "fib_com.exe" is considerabley larger but may now be
possibly considerabley or slightly faster. ;)
