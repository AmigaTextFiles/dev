   This is just to say that AD&D 2nd. Edition is copyrighted by TSR, Inc.,
and that this program is not meant to replace the need to purchase the
game.  In fact, this program is pretty darn useless if you don't own the
game.  If you downloaded this thinking it was CG software, and are just
now deciding it's not, try AD&D - it's a lot of fun! :)  This software
is meant only as a utility to make the life of players and DMs easier.

   See @{"Distribution" link dist} for more info on distribution conditions.

Have fun, and well met.

@node dist "Distribution"
@nextnode intro

   Anyone can give this program to whomever they please, so long as no one
charges for its distribution above and beyond copying costs.  Fred Fish,
of course, has permission to distribute it in his collection, and Walnut
Creek may also include this program on their CD-ROM, which I regard as
an exceptional value.

@node intro "Introduction"
@nextnode @howto

   This program had its beginnings too long time ago...  I decided that
I would take it upon myself to write a character generator for the
AD&D 2nd edition game both as an exercise in learning how to program 
for 2.0 of the OS, and as a utility for myself and some of my friends.
One of these friends pointed out to me that others might find it useful
as well, and this meant it had to be presentable...  Now, much
time later, here it is.

   It's pretty easy to figure out how to use - run it and see.

@endnode

@node howto "How to use this thing..."
@nextnode mainwin

   This program is supposed to be @{u}intuitive@{uu}, so before
reading any further, try the program!

   There, wasn't that easy?

   Now to explain a little of what you saw.

   If you noticed that not all races or classes were presented as
choices, this is because the lists of races and classes you were allowed
to choose from were based upon your stats and race (for class).
   In the beta version of this program, you could only roll the stats
randomly.  However, at the urging of a beta tester and a @{"bug" link bugs},
I've included the ability to alter the randomly rolled stats.  Besides,
I realized that when I create NPCs, I never roll the stats anyway, so being
able to set your own became a must.
   After you have rolled stats and chosen a race and class, you are taken to
the @{"Main" link mainwin} window.

@endnode

@node mainwin "The Main window..."
@nextnode equip

   From the main screen, you can buy @{"Equipment" link equip}, choose @{"Proficiencies" link prof},
start over, save your character, change the sex and alignment of your
character, or quit.

   If you choose to start over, you will be taken back to the stat generation
window.  You will first be asked if you are sure, because you will lose the
current character when you start over.  If you choose to exit the program,
you will also be given the chance to change your mind.

   If you change the sex of your character, the height and weight will be
re-rolled.  If you don't like the values it gives, you can either try
until it gives something more to your liking, or you can simply ignore
it and change it in the saved file.  Note that changing your sex too many
times may result in unsightly scars and/or an identity crisis. :)

   The initial alignment was something chosen by me, but you can change it
to anything you like as long as it is allowed.

   When you save your character, a file requester will pop up so you can
choose exactly where to put it.  Not a whole lot of checking is done yet
while the file is being saved, so popping out disks after choosing to save
to them may give dismal results... so don't... :)

@endnode

@node equip "Buying Equipment"
@nextnode prof

   Just click on what you want to buy.  The weight and cost in
gold are displayed.  To sell an item back, click on it's name in
the 'owned' window.

   The equipment displayed is loaded in from a text file, so if you
wish to disallow certain items in your campaign, or add magic items
to make this more of an NPC generator, you can add them to that file.
Be sure to read @{b}and follow@{ub} the instructions found in that file.

@endnode

@node prof "Choosing Proficiencies"

   When you select this button from the @{"main" link mainwin} window, a new
window will open up that will allow you to select/unselect WP and NWP.
You select a proficiency by clicking on its name in the window on the left,
and it will appear in the window on the right.  The window on the left
contains information about the number of slots a proficiency will take, what
stat it is based upon, and the modifier that is applied to that stat to arrive
at your character's ability with that skill.  WP and NWP are both listed in
this listview gadget, and you will notice that the program knows which is
which.  See the data file caled proficiencies for more information.  This file
may also be modified by the user by following the instructions outlined there.
Currently there is no allowance for specialization in weapons.  A simple
workaround for this would be to add the specializations to the proficiencies
file as seperate entries that cost two slots instead of one.  You could also
add info from certain handbooks for group specializations.  I figured this method
for choosing WP and NWP would be best to allow for the most tailoring to
house rules regarding specializations.
   Note that by selecting NWPs multiple times that are based upon an attribute,
your skill with that NWP will continue to go up as long as you can afford
it.  You can bring them back down by clicking on their entry in the other
listview.
   Note that this system allows you to choose NWP outside your groups for
double cost.
   Pressing D or clicking done will take you back to the @{"Main" link mainwin}
window.

@node bugs "Know bugs"
@nextnode future

   The random number generation is... weird.  I nticed at one point that I
could never seem to get an 18.  Ever!  I even wrote a program to test my
stat generation routines by generating 1000000 stats and counting the 18's.
Zero, zip, nada.  I rewrote them, and the same thing happened.  After
looking a little more closely, it was the random numbers!  That truly bit.
I tried taking every fourth random number, but that didn't seem to help at
all.  So I HAD to add the ability to modify stats.  To those of you who would
rather not have to adjust stats, I'm sorry.  I'm working on it, though.

   Only one other one right now, and it's not really a bug since it doesn't cause
any problems.  I don't know how to just @{i}activate@{ui} a string gadget... :)  Being
a rather poor student, I can't afford the books to tell me how to do all these
things... :(  Thus, on the main window you have to click on the Name string
gadget - just pressing 'N' doesn't work yet.

   Anther strange thing is what taskinfo (part of the most excellent JM
package) says to me about this program when it's running.  It tells me
that my max stack use is a negative number... ???  Last time i looked, it
said max stack was -66000 or so.  I don't get stack overflows, so I don't
know what the problem is...

   Well, as you can see, this program still has lots of places to go from here.
The following are suggestions that have been made by various people:

1)  Allow the loading of characters to be done as well, so that a DM could use
the program to manage his/her NPCs and PCs, by adding/removing items as time
goes by.

2)  Adding the psionics rules.  I omitted this from this version because my
primary goal was to cover the rules in the core books first.

3)  Implementing weapon specialization by multiple selection, in the way NWPs
go up as you multiply select them.

4)  A nice 'about' requester, and a better-looking main screen.

5)  Re-doing the whole thing in C++.  OK, that wasn't an outside suggestion...
When SAS's C++ comes out up here in mid-November, I'll probably start.  The
woman at SAS quoted me a decent educational price on it.  Character generation
seems to me to be a problem that lends itself to an OOP approach very well.

6)  You'll notice the ghosted print button in the main window.  I plan on
having it do some nice printing, but since you can just print out the saved
text file that didn't seem like an important thing to add just yet.

7)  Having graphical depictions of the dice as they are rolled, so you can
see the result of each die.  See @{"bugs" link bugs} for more on this one, though.

8)  A nice icon!  Damnit, I'm an engineer, not an artist...  If you make a nice
one, let me know and perhaps I'll use it in the next release! (see the section
on the @{"author" link me}.

9)  Thief skills and random(?) selection of mage spells.  An omission for now,
yes, but they shouldn't be too hard to add for 1.1... :)

@nextnode me

Although I've put in a lot of late nights on this, there are several people
who made things easier by pointing things out, doing testing for me, or other
things mentioned below.

1)  Jace Schivens, for being a GREAT beta tester.  Thanks for all those bug
reports and short-notice testings...

2)  John Scott, another beta tester.  Thanks for your patience when the first
beta version wouldn't even run on your computer... (address error???? :) )

3)  Everyone who volunteered to do some beta testing but whom I had to turn
down - I never knew so many people were looking for such a program!

4)  To the people with whom I've played AD&D and several other RPGs over
the years:  Steve Wilson, Brent Pemberton, Tony Boyd, Clint Baltzer and Dan
Wilson (also known as Ragnar Quickrang (who's died enough times and in such a
variety of ways that he's a shining example of how @{i}bad@{ui} luck can get... :) ),
Vadaconna (who's only died twice, but in very spectacular ways, and who lends
new meaning to 'power hungry mage' :) ), Demnal (of the one eye, who loves
watching people squirm when he adjusts his eye-patch), Burreau, son of
Burreau (who played the part of a disgusting dwarf to a T, and who could be
counted on to miss most midnight encounters while he struggled into his plate
mail), and ... well... Dan went through a few characters, namely because he
always seemed to end up crossing the party... :) - collectively known as the
Knights of Nee); also Ron Gullon, Jeff MacDonald, Christian Denton, Rebecca
Dickinson (now Rebecca Smith), Greg, Cindy Coffill, Todd Caldwell, Michelle
Brenton, Chris Jones, Todd Horn, Paul 'the movie man' Williams, and anyone I
may have missed.  It was fun...

@endnode

@node me "The author..."

   My name is Bruce Baltzer, and I'm a student taking electrical engineering
with specialization in computers and communications... ya, pretty dry stuff.
I've played AD&D since I was 14 (I'm now 23), and have also dabbled in
Paladium, TMNT, Paranoia, Star Wars, Role Master, CoC, Top Secret/SI, 
and at least a half-dozen others I can't think of offhand.

   I'm still a student, but am on a 16 month work term with IBM in Toronto,
Canada.  When I finish here, it'll be back to TUNS in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to
finish off my degree.  Then... who knows?

   I can be reached at:
      bruceb@vnet.ibm.com   - preferred address until Sept, '94.
      baltzebw@newton.ccs.tuns.ca  - any time before May, '95

   If you use this program and like it, I'd like to hear from you!  No money,
just a note... (or a complete boxed SAS/C 6.50... :) )

   Suggestions and bug reports are also welcome!

   I'm now devoting most of my programming time to finishing a port of
the Vast Tome of Knowledge to the Amiga.  It's a very useful DMing utility
written in Turbo Pascal and 8088 assembly, so it's taking some time... :)

   The early development of CharGen was done on an A500 with a GrandSlam
(FAST!!!!!) 500, a 120 meg hard drive, and 5 megs of RAM.  The later part
(and quite frankly, most of it :) ) was done on an A4000/030 with a 130 Mb
drive, a 245 Mb drive, 6 megs of RAM, and a math co, which I purchased this
summer thanks to this work term... :)
