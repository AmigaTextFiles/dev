 Description: 
--------------

OrionIRC is my idea which will be soon splitting into a couple other
programs as Well as OrionIRC..

A Gadtools IRC.. which is about 20% faster then AmIrc

All Written in BlitzBasic ..

********

WARNING this Doc is a cut and paste and incomplete!!!

This is an official pre-release.. to bolster and hopefully boost support..
with the recent release of BlackIRC, I felt I needed to show my progress..
:)

if you have any questions, please E-mail me.. and I'll answer them or find
me in IRC!

I believe I have the program generally bug free... but I've been known to
be wrong.. please don't shoot me if I am :)

the Config file is generally compatible with Amirc's .. take a look and
edit it to your taste.. and it should work.. :) in the end, it will be 100%
compatible.. (I hope)

Your memory requirements will rise as more random lines and greetings you
have..

----------

Random Text display
Random Sleep timer
Random Greetings
Multi User Access
Text Encryption

--------------
 Legal Stuff:
--------------

	if you run it.. and it blows up your computer.. it's your problem, not
mine.. I designed it to be a simple bot.. not a virus.. don't bother suing
me for any damages.. 

I will attempt to fix any minor problems in my program that may arise from
the use of my program.. 

although there is a runtime debugger included, it does NOT guarantee you
won't guru!

--------------
 Installation
--------------

It needs the TOSFONTS in the FONTS: dir.. otherwise, all the rest of the
files need to reside in the same directory the program is in..

------------------
 Options & Config
------------------

the Program is pretty self sufficient.. and will run by itself without any
files, but there are some config files you may wish to have setup.. 

default: greet.cfg

----
6. This is the file that is a relief to many of my beta testers, and a
   godsend to myself, also.. the multiuser access file.. it contains 3
   simple lines.. 

   Nick 1          . whatever your nick is
   password 1      . your password
   access 2        . anything from 10 to 99 .. it don't care
   nick 2          . a friends nick
   password 2      . his password
   access 2        . his access below 10?
   nick 3
   etc..

   each line set up in a way so that more then one person can access the
   bot and it's abilities..the people you give access to your bot know to
   off "offme" thier access when thier done for the day so other people
   don't log on with thier nick and use thier access.. 

   access levels are hard coded as of this version.. maybe later it'll be
   different.. level 1 to 99.. as shown in the commands menu.. 

** Future Versions will contain IP security .. 

default: access.cfg

----
7. you might wanna leave this file alone.. it can have upto 50 lines of text
   80 characters wide... and have it display any way you wish.. never
   versions will have configureable access levels per command so to keep
   yourself from haveing to re-write thsi file later.. just leave it be.. 
   the longer you make it the longer it takes to display..

** I built a display delay timer into OrionBot to keep it from flooding
   out.. although it can display 50 lines.. I suggest you keep it to
   under 20.. I may lower this in the future anyways..

default: command.menu

----
8. this is the file name that you use for the bot to spit out random
   text.. one liners basicly.. I use an old taglines file, myself..
   the file line limit is 5000 lines.. granting you have enough memory for
   THAT many lines.. 

default: oneline.bot

----
9. your command prefix character.. the program will only read 1 character
   from this line so you can't have multiple command headers.. I.e. $% or
   anything like that, sorry.. 

default: -

----
10. This defines how many line go by in the IRC, that the BOT sees that
    someone with an IP said something, before it splurts out some nonsense
    from it's oneline file.. if you want to turn this option off just put
    a "-1" in this line.. and it won't blurb anything out, but the "random"
    option will still be active.. 

default: 20

----
12. This is an actual Switch that controls 2 functions.. testmode and
    random sleep timer.. it will accept one of three numbers for it's
    arguments.. if it's not one of the three numbers.. it defaults to 0..

    0 turns off sleep timer and test mode
    1 turns on test mode
    2 turns on sleep timer

    0 is self explanitory after 1 and 2 are explained

    1 this is a test mode for the bot, you need not run your TCP stack to
      use this option, as it doesn't access IRC when this is on.. 

      Test mode is something I made for myself, but I figure it might come
      in handy for other people to use if they're encountering a problem
      with orionbot..  it access all the data files on the system, and
      displays what is in them, prompting the for use input on each file
      for verbosity.. you may not want it to display all 200+ lines of your
      random file.. so you can see where potential errors may be on why
      OrionBot is messing up for bug reports.. 

      it also diplays all the colors to oyu can pick which color you want
      displayed in option #13..

    2 if there's no activity in a channel for about 30 seconds the bot will
      pipe up with "random".. maybe to spark someone to talk about the
      funny line that came up and get conversation going.. thus waking up
      "sleepers"..

 Command Menu:
---------------

* future options? (only with support!)

- Level 99 - bye, raw, goto, *set, say, ncrypt

- Level 10 - *addnick, *remnick, op, dop, opme, kick

- Level 1 - say, *tryme, offme

- None - version, VERSION, random, users, commands, pass

raw          . Send raw data to the server <only if you KNOW>
bye          . quit the bot via IRC
set          * change a certain setting on the bot
addnick      * add a person to the access list
remnick      * remove a person form the access list
say          . say something to the channel it's in.. 
goto         . go to a channel
opme         . if the bot is an op.. to have it op you
op <nick>    . " .. to have it op <nick>
dop <nick>   . " .. have it deop <nick>
ncrypt <?>   . have it encrypt text (don't do it if it annoys others)
commands     . menu of available commands
owner <nick> . transfer ownership fo the bot so someone else
random       . do a random oneliner
pass <pass>  . turn on bot access if your on the user list via password 
offme        . turn off your access
tryme        * random oneliner to person then random kick choice
 
I wouldn't suggest using this bot as a channel monitor quite yet.. it COULD
be used as one but, it has flaws..

at current it only uses a nickname as an identifier.. if someone has
your nickname, and password they can access it.. or if you leave the
channel, or ping out of a channel, your access is still acitvated, a person
could easily take over your channel.. it doesn't have a routine to
deactivate a person leaving a channel yet.. my to do list is pretty
extensive, with security procedures at the top.. this is meant as a bot
for fun...

Enjoy!


-----
 GUI
-----

The Gui For the Bot isn't very complex... for futue concepts and ideas, the
bot opens on it's own 16 color screen.. there's a 3 options in the pull
down menu.. CLI, ABOUT, and QUIT.. all I think are self explanitory and
easy to use.. 


--------
 Future
--------

As Stealth put it.. "Frills" ... Games like Trivia.. maybe tic tac toe.. ..
whatever I can find in a "basic" that's text based for me to convert.. 


------------------------------------
 Problems and Bug Reports and IDEAS
------------------------------------

Simply E-mail me with the problem.. but before ya go doing that, be sure to
take a look at the "Bot.log" on your system.. it will have a detailed list
of server to bot activity.. 

be sure to send this file with the bot problem information...
