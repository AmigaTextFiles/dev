MEDFuncs
--------

Functions for Blitz2 for the playback of MED files upto and including 64
channel MED's.

If you use this in a commercial program, you should read the license
information that comes with the developer kit.  For more information on
what everything does, read the MEDFuncs themselves.  Getting the autodocs
would help as well :)
