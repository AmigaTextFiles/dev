                          Blitz Mailing List Guide
                          ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@netsoc.ucd.ie>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@netsoc.ucd.ie>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@host.domain", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@acc.umu.se or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

@NODE "Mail_0" " Alternative Font Directories "
From: Damir Arh <damir.arh@telesat.si>
Date: 08-16-00 18:19:23
Subject: @{b}Alternative Font Directories@{ub}

Hello!

One of the users of a program of mine suggested that he would like to see my
program supporting alternative font directories much in a way as some paint
programs do i.e. that he could choose a different directory with fonts for
use with my program than FONTS:.

I am using an ASL font requester for selecting fonts and I really see no way
to tell it to display contents of a different directory than FONTS:. I'd ne
very glad if I would be proven wrong.

Does anybody know of a way to force ASL font requester to display contents
of another directory with fonts? Is there any other way of providing an
alternative directory for fonts?

Kind regards

Yes, you can, as James suggested, by using the Assign FONTS: ADD method
first.
Then the new fonts directory will appear in the font requester along with
the regular system fonts.

You could ask them for the directory to be added, using a standard ASL path
requester.

Then do something similar to the attached bit of code, snipped from BeatBox2
(by James Boyd and myself)

You can skip the part where it gives your own program an assign, since you
already have the full path to the user's selected font directory.

Later.....

You can do this from within your program if you use AssignAdd_ and RemAssignList_
from dos.library. See the autodocs for how they work, because I've only seen
them in passing.

> Or you can load a font with a direct path I think...?

Course you can, Viewfonts would suck otherwise (well, it sucks anyway).

They'd have to add to their own Fonts: assign with an ADD, eg.

assign FONTS: "c:somewhere/" ADD

Or you can load a font with a direct path I think...?

RemAssignList is a bastard of a command! Don't go there! For your own

@NODE "Mail_5" " bbgtlib / dll bugs "
From: David McMinn <D.Mcminn@eee.rgu.ac.uk>
Date: 08-15-00 11:45:27
Subject: @{b}bbgtlib / dll bugs@{ub}

Hi all,

I think i found another bug in my updated gtlib - it happens when you try to 
use GTGadPtr and GTSetAttrs on GTListview gadgets (the code has no real 
affect). I think it also happens with the original bbgtlib. Anyway, I'll fix 
this tonight.

As for DLL, it looks like the return code for one of the functions has got 
mixed up. This might not apply to most of you, it may only be in the version I 
have and on the b2k site.

Amorel - both of these will mean that the DLL archive I sent you doesn't work 
properly.

Yeah, that was my fault.    Anyone who has the DLL archive needs to
swap the #DLL_True and #DLL_False values in the function

Hi,

is there anyone who happens to have an ADF of the WB3.0 HardDisk diskette?
I've managed to find all my other disks, except this one, which in my memory
was only delivered with the A1200HD package (1200 with harddisk built-in at
	purchase time).

I'd appreciate any pointers/mails/adfs, cos then I can finally get my Ami back
up and running!

Yeah, that was annoying. You don't really need the disk though, as you can boot 
from the WB disk and copy everything onto the HD. If you need the HDToolBox 
(not sure if it was only ever on the Install disk) for partitioning the hard-
drive then you can get HDInstTools (I think) from Aminet, it does the same job.

If you need to format it, just do it from the WB.

Copy everything from the Workbench and Extras disk into the root of the HD. 
Copy the Storage, Locale and Fonts disks into subdirectories called Storage, 
Locale and Fonts.

From CLI (after booting from WB disk):

copy sys:#? dh0: all
copy extras3.0:#? dh0: all
copy storage3.0:#? dh0:Storage all
copy dh0:WBStartup.info dh0:Storage.info
copy locale3.0:#? dh0:Locale all
copy dh0:WBStartup.info dh0:Locale.info
copy fonts3.0:#? dh0:Fonts all

> I'd appreciate any pointers/mails/adfs, cos then I can finally get my Ami back
> up and running!

If you can't get it running without the disk, I think WB3.0 was on the last few 
AF CD's, so I could check them for the install disk.

Ah I have found it! Grand! I just rememebered something though :)
Is there anything else on that Install disk that is important? If not, I think
I probably have HDToolBox on my UAE boot-folder.

I don't think so, although I just checked v3.1 disk and it had:

HDToolBox
HDBackup
and an HDSetup directory (don't know what that prog was for)

That HDSetup directory is for hd toolbox to store different HD specs, I

Actually I think that directory has a bunch of installer scripts for

Oh, ok, I don't know really then because I only have a copy of the disk

I -think- that program was used by the installer to set up a standard two

From: Tony Rolfe <edgewater@shoalhaven.net.au>
Date: 08-20-00 08:48:01
Subject: @{b}Blitz Basic source decoding.@{ub}

A question for any of the Blitz language developers who might be
listening...

Is there a publicly available library (or set of functions etc.) to
read a tokenized source file and break a source line down into
commands, variables, constants etc.?

What I'd like to play around with is a cross reference utility which
can read the source file and cross reference labels, functions,
statements, constants and variables to the source file and line number
where defibed and where used.   (Sort of like the Investigator does
for commands).  

I haven't the faintest how to go about it without some kind of source
interpreter and I really don't want to rewrite the compiler, so I
thought you guys must have the basic code available and if it was
publicly available I'd be halfway there (or at least a quarter).

Regards

The only thing that I can think of is the blitz.library that RWE were writing. 
Its a standard shared library that had commands for doing things like that I 
think. Basically it was the Blitz compiler in a shared lib.

I don't know if it was ever finished, and I know the library was never 
released. However, I'm sure the source (68k ASM) and maybe some docs are on the 
freeblitz site (http://www.ldngedge.demon.co.uk/).

I'm actually just testing it as a potential Blitz Basic site (ie the
official one) -- but I'm talking only if Guildhall want to pay for the
banners removed ($4.95/month). They can host the blitzbasic.com address
properly, hence the choice...seems quite alright (oh, yeah, better tell you
which one it is: www.50megs.com, and don't be put off by the slowness of
their own homepage!)...

Bummer and nope. It doesn't have any of the original full versions of anything
on it. I contacted the guy George Bray thats working with Mark Sibly on PCBB (he
also works for Guildhall) to see if it would be possible to stick everything on
there for free.

Nothing. Sent. In. Private. Though.

You could try www.crosswinds.net
They had some server problems for a while but AFAIK it been sorted out now.
And there are times when the ftp server is a little too busy, but I
still prefer it as there is no need for banners or pop-up windows and
you get unlimited space, all for free. :)

Anyway...

What sort of space do you need?   My ISP really doesn't care how much
space I use.   His basic criterion is that I don't back up my entire
HDD there every week.     If we are talking about a few meg there's no
problems, anything over 10Mb I'd have to go chat with him first.

I tried there before, and yes I don't like them because I haven't been able to 
connect to their ftp server for ages, and when trying to access the few pages I 
did upload, its a random chance whether it works or not.

The site is already 10Mb, with a years worth of list archives it goes up to 
22Mb. And thats still missing some things I want to stick there from Aminet, 
the programming section is missing, etc.

Hi to all,

I just tried to change the Labels of a GTCycle gadget with GTSetAttrs. I did
the following:

    opt$ = "1|2|3"
    gtsetattrs #GLIST,2,#GTCY_Labels,opt$    <--- didn't work
    redraw #GLIST,2

    gtsetattrs #GLIST,2,#GTCY_Labels,&opt$ <--- didn't work, either

Does anyone know, how to use the GTCY_Labels attribut correctly ?

Greets,

Hi Sven

See attached - you need to pass an array of string pointers that has 0 in the 
array to indicate the end of the labels. I might add a GTChangeCycle command in 
the gtlib since no-one would ever figure that out without deciphering the 
autodocs.

Hi all,

another question from me:

Once I had a nice tool, which listed up all the commands in deflibs sorted
by name AND library including the libnumber.
Does anybody have this tool ? Oh, I have "stripper" and "libinfo" but these

I am not sure if yhis is it, but you will find my Library Investigator on my

If I do the "Scan Libs" it starts to print out some libraries (not all !)

Hi Sven

> I tried your Investigator out, but it won't work correctly !?

I think there are three versions of Investigator.

One version (on Aminet as Blitz.I.lha in dev/basic I think) prints all the 
library numbers and commands, which I think is what you asked for originally. 
Maybe, I can't remember since it's been a while since I used it. This was 
version 1.

The other two versions are the same as the one that I think you currently have -
 it scans your source code and tells you what library numbers and commands you 
have use in your source code. v2 is the one on Curt's website, v3 was posted by 
Tony Rolfe a few days ago and has the ability to check (X)INCLUDE'd sources 
files.

I get this happening on UAE, but it works fine on my real Amiga, even though 
both have the same Blitz setup.

Yes, and this one is found on my website with the name "Library
Investigator"

I'm not sure if it is still in Aminet/dev/basic and if it is, what the name
is...

I don't know if it runs under WinUAE, as I can't find my own copy or the
source (DOH!) right now..  I'll have to go download it myself   ;)

Yeah, Investigator2 (by me) and 3 (by Tony) don't run here either on WinUAE.

I'm not sure why  -

Somewhere, in the dim dark recesses of my memory, I seem to recall David
saying that one of the file-handling commands didn't work under WinUAE, but
I don't recall which one(s) it was...

Is it possible that the problem is my use of a console window for the
output?

Or was it something to do with determining the length of a file, or EOF, or
something like that?

It's EOF that doesn't work. You can replace EOF(x) with Loc(x)=Lof(x). However,
I'm not sure that is the problem, as it seems to read a few libs correctly at
first, unless it's freezing after reading the acidlibs file?

@NODE "Mail_40" " CopperWait "
From: Tom Allerton <tomallerton@hotmail.com>
Date: 08-05-00 11:38:49
Subject: @{b}CopperWait@{ub}

Hi,

Does anyone know how to insert a copperwait instruction after line 255? I`ve been told you must wait for the end of line 255 and then wait for line ypos-256, so using the CopperWait command from the RICopperFX library I tried this:

CopperWait 0,255
CopperWait 0,ypos-256

which waited for line 255 and totally ignored the second instruction (although it was inserted into the copperlist).

I then looked at the copperlist and noticed another 2 WAIT instructions waiting for the last line of the display - line 300 in my case (it was at the address just below the custom area). In this the x coordinate of the first instruction was $E0 (=224) so I changed my code to:

CopperWait 224,255
CopperWait 0,ypos-256

This totally corrupted the display and in the copperlist the x coordinate is only $60 (=96) so it seems I can`t have this value over 96, however if I put the value to between 96 and 128 the copperlist still shows $60 but the display isn`t corrupted.

Thanks a lot!

Correct way is to wait the last line last x position ie (127,255)

I'm sure it was John Mason who posted some code for using it here. I think it

> Btw, dynamic (list)arrays, are these possible in Blitz?

Yes, you can either Dim a normal Blitz List array to some really huge silly 
size (although I'm not sure if that allocates the memory or not) or use Dave 
Newton's DLL code (Archives/general section of b2k). There are no docs in the 
archive yet, since none exist AFAIK.

The DLL stuff is the same as normal Blitz commands I think, but totally dynamic 
and it saves you having to do your own routines or mess with pointers :)

Yes, sure =) But I think I already have that. If it is that code which
saves an mpega stream to a wav on disk? I tried that just to see if the
wav would be audible but it was all noise. But that can be caused by my
software not replaying this wav ok. Wav always are troiblesome on Amiga
software. Anyways if you have a way to actually play the mp3 that`d be
great.

Actually the file it makes isn't a wav, it's a raw 16 bit sample.  If you
use Play16, you can hear it properly using these arguments:

 play16 tracks=2 bits=16 freq=44100 dh1:temp/mp3out.pcm2

Geez, you can't work that out on your own?? :)  I tried to make that work
but I couldn't quite get the timing and buffering right..

I think David McMinn knows how to make it work with ListViews.

I've got some routines which use GTScrollers and DLL to simulate them.
You have a lot more flexibility (because you have to do more work),
but I can forward them to you if you want.   Gives fully
font-sensitive multi-column reports.

Yes, it is probably better to use the DLL stuff because, like you said, there 
will always be one person who has a hard drive full of mods. I'll mail it to 
you privately since I added the docs that Tony sent me but I haven't uploaded 
it yet.

I haven't tried it yet, but since the DLL lists are nearly the same internally 
as Blitz ones (and use the correct OS structures for lists), it should be 
fairly straightforward.

The B2k URL is http://come.to/blitz-2000 (if you can put up with a pop-up 
window) or http://www.blitz-2000.freeserve.co.uk.

I found that DLL stuff damn hard to get to grips with. As a last resort, you
could always DIM a new array bigger than what you have and copy it all
over...do the same again later if need be...?

No, it doesn't actually allocate the memory until the items are added (other

Normally there is only one text per line in a GTListview. Multi-column would
mean more than one text per line, but not just separated with spaces, they would
all line up properly, i.e.

You can do it with OS3+ and hooks, but it becomes messy, complicated and really
low-level OS stuff. Tony's routines would be what I'd recommend.

With a Normal GTListView, you build the line to display as a string
variable (Correct me if I'm wrong here)  which means that to get
multi-column reports you have to do things line
Type\String = LSet$(Column1$, Col1Width)+ Rset$(Column2$, Col2Width)+...

Effectively, this means that you can only guarantee that columns line
up with a fixed font.

My routines allow columns to be aligned with proportional fonts,  each
line has it's own column structure (so you can have columns, then some
free-form text, then some different columns)    Each column can be in
a different colour.   Each column can be left, right, decimal or
percentage aligned.

The whole report can be read-only (Clicking makes no difference),
Selectable (double-click one line to select it)  Multi-selectable
(click several lines to select them all)  Multi-line selectable (Click
one line in a group to select them all)  semi-selectable (Only some
lines can be selected)   I've never tried Multi Multi-line
semi-selectable reports, but I think they would work :-)

You can specify buttons and a message line at the bottom, headings
fixed at the top and menus attached to the window.

You can also "Nest" reports by selecting a line in the first, using
that to build a second list.   When you close the first list, you can
go back to the same line in the first.

But they use GTScrollers, not GTListviews.

And they rely on DLL

Unfortunately, there's B-All documentation, since I've been the only
user so far.    If you want them I'll have to spend a day or so
putting summat together.    Finding the time is the problem.

Do you mean run it from within the debugger, or quit the debugger and then run 
it again from the Blitz editor?

If its the first case, then I'm not sure why, since it would be a bit crap if 
you couldn't stop your program to debug it and then start it again. What 
version of the debugger do you have? If you have other debugging tools active 
(i.e. Enforcer) then the debugger might crash (since it causes Enforcer hits).

If it's the second one, thats usually badly written libraries. You can try 
Compile and Run instead of just Run it this case.

  I bought it, and here is my review.  ;)

  Basicly a waste of money.  Didn't really have much in the way
of usefull new information and the command descriptions weren't
much (if any) better than the one which came with BB2.


  I was one of those who were going to work on a new manual, but
then someone else announced that they had one about completed and
the Phoenix project caught my fancy so I dropped it.  The Phoenix
effort fell appart and whoever was supposedly making the manual
shortly dissapeared.

  I would still be interested in working with others on an ebook
manual, say with it being added to command-by-command and always
available to the public for whatever help it could be.  I would
like to start with the screen commands if anyone wants to supply
information/insite...

A long time ago someone in the USA announced a book for Blitz. The
announcment should be in one of the Amiga Report (Jason Compton) issues 
but I couldn't find it now. It was disscused on this list.
I think it was sometime around 1996-1997.

I don't know if someone ever bought it and made a review.

Just a few minutes after I sent the first letter I atleast found
the blitzman project by Fish and Vittori Ferrari (i think).
(this is not the book I wrote about in my previous mail)

http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~fish/HTML/blitzman/

I also found a preposal for the planned Blitz3 compiler

I'd help out I suppose, since I was going to do something like this for the 
Blitz 2000 site. So far I've only got a very crap and overly complicated 
explanation of binary that I'm going to remove.

I'd also like to stick it on the Blitz 2000 website, which I will get around to 
finishing if it kills me!

However, rather than jump in at the Screen commands, I was going to go threough 
the manual from the start and re-write it pretty much, but leave out all the 
obsolete stuff, like Blitz 2 gadgets and Slices. If you'd rather we started in 
the middle (since there probably isn't many newbies left who don't know how to 
use variables etc), then thats reasonable.

That'll be fun for people without monitors and people with GFX cards ;)

> Can anyone provide the correct vmode for the screen command, or tell me how to
> do it? (I only need 4 colours).

The correct viewmode would be (#SUPER72_MONITOR_ID | #SUPERLACE_KEY). You'll 
need to include amigalibs.res in the "Compiler Options" window, but if you 
don't the values are:

#SUPER72_MONITOR_ID		=$81000
#SUPERLACE_KEY			=$8024

If you are able to have a variable sized display, then the best thing would be 
to let the user choose the screenmode and size from an ASL requester.

If you must have it fixed at 800*600, then you might want to try figuring out 
the best viewmode for a particular system (not fixed to shires laced). This 
doesn't always work 100% though, so you'd maybe need to check it out before 
using it:

; Try to figure out best mode given some properties
Dim bmidtags.TagItem(5)
bmidtags(0)\ti_Tag = #BIDTAG_NominalWidth,800
bmidtags(1)\ti_Tag = #BIDTAG_NominalHeight,600
bmidtags(2)\ti_Tag = #BIDTAG_DesiredWidth,800
bmidtags(3)\ti_Tag = #BIDTAG_DesiredHeight,600
bmidtags(4)\ti_Tag = #BIDTAG_Depth,2
bmidtags(5)\ti_Tag = #TAG_DONE
viewmode.l = BestModeIDA_(&bmidatags(0))

; If the system couldn't figure out the screenmode then viewmode will be -1.
; We check for this and set the default (SHIRES-LACE) if we find it.
If viewmode = -1 then viewmode = (#SUPER72_MONITOR_ID | #SUPERLACE_KEY)

; Open screen
Dim scrtags.TagItem(5)
scrtags(0)\ti_Tag = #SA_Width,800
scrtags(1)\ti_Tag = #SA_Height,600
scrtags(2)\ti_Tag = #SA_Depth,2
scrtags(3)\ti_Tag = #SA_DisplayID,viewmode
scrtags(4)\ti_Tag = #TAG_DONE
ScreenTags 0,"blah",&scrtags(0)

Hi to all,

These damned GTListviews have been discussed a million times, but...

I've opened a Window with a Listview in it.
I can select an item and will get the position in the linked list, ok.
I WANT to select an item an WHILST HAVING THE MOUSE PRESSED get the actual
selected item.
I tried it with #IDCMP_GADGETDOWN, but didn't get any message (of course I
set the IDCMP-Flag).
So how can I get the item while the mousebutton is pressed ?

You mean, if you hold the mouse button down and drag it over the listview, 
different items should be selected?

> I tried it with #IDCMP_GADGETDOWN, but didn't get any message (of course I

Not only that, you need to set the GTListview to give IDCMP_GADGETDOWN 
messages. But looking at my autodocs, it doesn't look like you can do that. I 
just tried it too and I can't get any down events for a listview.

> So how can I get the item while the mousebutton is pressed ?

Perhaps this is a good time to investigate custom GTListviews, made up with a 
scroller :)

These routines do use mouse events to select lines, but I've not
tried to implement drag selection yet.

I'll try to get some time to do the docs for DLL and the multi-column
stuff next week.   I can't do it over this weekend (Playing bridge all
Saturday and going to the local food & wine festival Sunday).  If I
don't find any mor bugs in the Motel manager I should get some time
next week.

Recursion is simple, but has a few pitfalls. All it is is that you have a 
function which calls itself. The one thing you MUST make sure of though is that 
anything specific to the current iteration is a local variable.

An example would be counting the number of lines in Blitz source code, but 
using XInclude's - each time you find an xinclude statement the function calls 
itself, but the number of lines in the source code would be a local variable. 
Remember that local variables are completely separate between function calls, 
even when you have nested function calls to the same function.

Another thing to think of is that if you use Blitz's file I/O then you may 
struggle with recursion. Each new nested call to the function must use a 
different file number, or you'd screw up an earlier call to the function. Of 
course, you could pass the file number as a parameter, and when going one level 
deeper, just pass the current file number + 1.

An alternative to recursion might be to scan the files for XInclude's first and 
stick all the filenames of the sources into a list. You could then process the 
list separately, one file at a time. Disadvantage here would be that the source 
would need to be scanned twice, making it a lot slower.

As for detecting the XInclude token, save a program from Blitz that has only 
the line XInclude "blah". Now load it up in a hex editor. The first 2 bytes 
should be the token for XInclude.

Obviously you must also make sure that there is a valid ending condition,
like a loop-counter (which counts how deep you are (how many recusrsions there 
have been), and stops if a certain level is reached). The loop-counter is useful
if the programmer include file B from file A and file A from file B, and decides
to see if your program can cope with this (and yes, I have been known to do 
these things oout of boredom :).

The ending condition should be placed as the first line of your function (at
		least, that's where I would put it :)

*function header*
if (end-condition is met) then function return something;

*rest of function, including the recursive call to this one*

*end function*

What you return on the end-condition thingy is quite important. If you are
counting lines, for example the function could look like this (but don't copy
it, because it is bound to have mistakes in it :)

function count_lines {i, filename}
  linecount=0                   ; guess this one's local
  if i>7 then function return 0	; if there are too many files included (7 here)
																; just return 0 extra lines
  if ReadFile(i, filename)			; try to read the file

As you see it's pretty simple (and even simpler when you remember blitz syntax
		instead of having to look ik up all the time ;). The initial call to the
countlines function will return all the lines of all the files all added to-
gether, so it would look like so:

nprint(count_lines(0,firstfilename))  ; show amount of lines in this file and
                                ;       all files included from it.

Tres simple, no?

Yes, it should be able to do this - it really amounts to just recognizing
another token, then taking a different action if it is found...

Blitz libraries #0 and #1 contain all the compiler tokens, like "If",
"EndIf", "Xinclude", etc...

(No, you won't find 'em in your libraries drawer, or in Acidlibs - they are
built into the compiler itself)

I'd do it like David suggested below...

I think it would actually be handier if it gave you a separate list of the
commands used in each individual Include file?  Anyway, read on, the
following method would work for either way, and no recursion involved (I
don't think, I never got the hang of recursion...)

I would suggest simply having it scan through the main source once, adding
the usual tokens to the list as before, and adding any Xinclude filenames
(and don't forget also plain Include) to
a separate list.

Then, once the first source was completely scanned, it could optionally give
the report for it and clear the list - or simply save the current stats.

Either way, it could then scan through all the Xincluded files and either
give a report on each, or simply a grand total at the end.

This method wouldn't slow things down, would be easier to program (at least
for me...), and would have the advantage that if any of the Xincludes
contained Includes of it's own, these would be processed too  (assuming
Blitz supports this sort of Include "nesting"?)

As I don't have the time right now, I'd be more than happy for anybody to
have a go at it.

As long as I get a copy when it is done   ;)

I think the source was included with the archive, but if not write me and
I'll pass it along.

It's rather a mess, but has lots of comments, so you should be able to
figure out what is going on.

And David, I either missed your posting about how to skip the "internal"
tokens, or possibly didn't understand it.

Would you mind re-posting it?  (Or if you are going to do the modifications
Tony wanted, possibly add it into the code?)

Later.....

Yeah, that would be handy, as would a total. Both being available 
simultaneously would be great.

Yes, I'm not sure how nesting XInclude'd files works since they are only 
supposed to be included in a program once, but I think it would definately be 
possible to nest include's and xinclude's (with different files).

I'll repost it (attached). I don't have enough time to work on it. As for 
skipping the internal tokens, I had figured out the structure of a blitz 
library file and produced an explanation and example of how to get the info 
from them. But for some libraries it doesn't work, so I'm not sure if it does 
actually skip the internal tokens or screws up when it finds them.

Here's my revised version of Curt's Investigator

It will recurse into all included files in the main source.

There is an option to produce a full cross reference from token to
line number within source file or to produce the original simple
number of times used report.

The full report takes MUCH longer, but is able to check for 
a includes b includes a
problems and only examines each included file once.

The short report cannot check for multiple occurences of one included
file and also cannot check for recursive includes.

Please try it out and let me know of bugs.    Praise to Curt, Flames

  Hee, hee, I was a big name dropper and mentioned it on the list, a
couple of months ago :) Cause I'd been in contact with him, asking if
he's be interested in doing a port to QNX RTP (Neutrino- now officially
known as QNX Real Time Platform). 
   I'll have to get back to him on that one- I'm working with a guy from
UK called Bernard Giltrap http://www.ideas2reality.co.uk/ . We're
looking at asking Mark, if he would want to license the PC version of
Blitz to us, so we could make a version on QNX. We'd need to do the
libs, and the GUI for the compiler, not sure on what would be needed
for the debugger- anyone interested in helping?  We're looking at
getting Venture Capital, but if we don't, we would pay by % of the
profits. 
   Also, QSSL (the company's not called QNX as some tend to think :)
will pay a substantial Bounty for completed projects, so you could get
money from that too. So if anyone's interested in porting apps
(including games) over to QNX, give us a yell, and I'll give you the
contact address to see how much of a Bounty they'll pay for your
project.  Note: at this time it may be a bit hard getting a reply at
this time, as they're all working their butts off getting the QNX CD
out! At the moment only C, C++,Java, etc are supported, but if we get a
Basic going, then we could use the Blitz Basic 2 proggies. 

  The QNX RTP CD will be out in about a months time- it will be free to
use for non-commercial purposes. If you want to have a look at it now-
you can join Phoenix and download it- the base archive is 26 Megs,and
apps can be added by FTP as you like (using a system like a
sophisticated version of ADT on Aminet), or you can download the whole
640Meg CD-image if you have a  major connection :) If you want to join
Phoenix send an E-Mail to greenboy:

Yeah, I know :-) I spotted it myself whilst I was going over it. Originally
I thought it was having more than one MUIAddObjsHGroup command for the same
HGroup, and then I realised I wasn't creating them.

I did send a mail here as soon as I found it, but I think the list is

I think thats a floating point error. Don't worry, its normally nothing to do
with your FPU, more like some bad code jumped into random memory and started
executing non-existant instructions.

Does it happen when you turn the debugger off?

Does it happen when you do "Compile and Run" or if you just try to "Run" it?

Hello,

I realise that it's been converted to a function now, which is good, but
every time I try and compile a program with this in, the Debugger shows up
with "GURU! - Line 1111 Emulator"

What is that and is there any way around it?

You need to do something like:

*something.Library=OpenLibrary_ ("blahblah.library")

If *something
    UseTheCommandFromTheLibrary_ (function's parameters)    ; whatever
function you're calling
    CloseLibrary_ *something
Else Request "","Couldn't open blahblah.library","END"
    End
EndIf

I seem to remember something like: OpenDevice_ ("whatever.device", other
parameters?), but I think they return 0 if successful, an error code if
unsuccessful...I don't have my autodocs handy! :(

A quick example (needs amigalibs.res)

*my.Library=OpenLibrary_("my.library",0)
If *my<>0
  NPrint "my.library v",*my\lib_Version,".",*my\lib_Revision
  CloseLibrary_(*my)

I think something like this would work. However, I've never had any success in 
actually using devices.

devname$="ahi.device"

*mp.MsgPort = CreateMsgPort_
if *mp
  ; The docs should tell you what type of structure to allocate
  ; and then you use sizeof to get the size. I think its usually
  ; something like an IOStdRequest structure.
  *ior.IORequest = CreateIORequest_(*mp, sizeof.IORequest)
  if *ior
    if OpenDevice_(&devname$, unit, *ior, flags)=0
      NPrint "device open"
      CloseDevice_ *ior
    end if
    DeleteIORequest_ *ior
  end if
  DeleteMsgPort_ *mp
end if

  No adverse effects that I could detect.  Sped up things for everything a
bit.

>advantages of upgrading to OS3.5?

  I don't remember them all, but some that were usefull to me were:

- standard support for drives and partitions larger than 4 gigabytes

- drivers for recent and current periferals, and improvements to some
of the old ones

- standard CD-rom support

- improved and faster file system, including support for long names

- support for graphic cards

- support for PPC as second processor

- improved utilities of various types

- generally faster and even more stable


  There were many others which don't come to mind right now, many of
which were modernizations and code cleanups, and added support for
various things.  The appearance was also improved, as was the ease
of use further improved in a number of ways.

  Over all, I find it very good and quite satisfying to use.  It still
lacks some of the bells and whistles of windoz and MacOS, but it also
lacks much of the bloat and freeze-ups of those two monsters.

Just a simple guess: Rename_ returns 0 on success, and

I've always had problems passing temporary strings (i.e. ones that are made up 
on the fly during the function call) to OS functions. Its like the string gets 
lost somewhere. Try this:

Fyle2$=FileName$+".Bkp"
If Rename_(&FileName$, &Fyle2$)
...

Correct. According to the autodocs:


    NAME
        Rename -- Rename a directory or file

    SYNOPSIS
        success = Rename( oldName, newName )
        D0                D1       D2

        BOOL Rename(STRPTR, STRPTR)

    FUNCTION
        Rename() attempts to rename the file or directory specified as
        'oldName' with the name 'newName'. If the file or directory
        'newName' exists, Rename() fails and returns an error. Both
        'oldName' and the 'newName' can contain a directory specification.
        In this case, the file will be moved from one directory to another.

        Note: it is impossible to Rename() a file from one volume to
        another.

    INPUTS
        oldName - pointer to a null-terminated string
        newName - pointer to a null-terminated string

    RESULTS
        success - boolean

    SEE ALSO
        Relabel()

Subject: @{b}rubik's cube@{ub}

Does anybody have any idea how to write ablitz program to solve a Rubik's cube. apart from working out that there are 18 possible moves and the total number of positions is in the region of 20 digits long the only thing I can think of is a loop trying it first in one move. However
with this method the total amount of moves goes up by a factor of 18:

Moves     Total number 
1               18
2               324
3               5832
4              104996
5              approx 1.8 million

This leads to the proram slowing down a lot. Prehaps it would be better in C

Perhaps it would be better to re-think how you're going to calculate the 
solution. How many moves (roughly) does it take on average to complete a 
Rubik's cube? 20 sounds like a fairly low estimate, but if we take it as an 
example, you're going to have to evaluate 1.27x10^25 moves. Obviously you know 
the starting state (otherwise you'd have to multiply the number of moves by the 
number of starting states).

C, Blitz or ASM, that's gonna take a long time. Unless it only needs a low 
number of moves (from your table, I'd say low would mean 4, 5 or not much more).

You might want to take a look at mathematical optimisation techniques and 
perhaps some AI stuff. Genetic algorithms could be used, although it might be 
tricky to get right and would still take a while. Expert systems could also be 
used and would probably be quicker (they're based on sets of rules, so if you 
get a Rubik's expert to give you some rules for solving it your program would 
be quite good too).

You can get little books describing how to solve the cube.   I can'r
recall the details now, but IIRC you solve the cross in the middle and
then the corners.   Anyway it is (I think) a three stage process.

I don't think it would be all that hard to program.    The rules as
set out in the book are pretty straight forward.

You might try looking in discount bookshops (or one of the on-line
book or toy shops may have a search facility).

I used to have one here, but goodness only knows where.

I can physically solve one in 90 seconds, if you can write a program to do
it quicker, I'll be impressed. But I will try and help you if I can...

for starters, I solve it layer by layer....

I remember there being a program on the BBC Micro that
could solve a Rubik's Cube. The source for it was in
one of the BBC Micro magazines (either Acorn User or
Micro User).

Sorry I can't much more of a help.

Kind regards,

Francis.

Would I be silly in suggesting a web search? Google turns up three
thousand odd results for "rubik cube solution".

A site that claims to have a solution in 65 moves is:

Get a pointer to intuition base, get pointer to first screen and go through the
list. I'm not sure about the locking method I use here, you might need to add a
forbid/permit:

*ib.IntuitionBase = IntuitionBase
iblock.l = LockIBase_(0)
numscreens.w = 0
*scr.Screen = *ib\FirstScreen
while *scr
    numscreens+1
    *scr = *scr\NextScreen
wend
UnlockIBase_ iblock


> B. Read the title screen information.

if *scr\Title Then NPrint Peek$(*scr\Title)

I have a hook I write for handling ARexx through MUI, but it can cause
enforcer hits.  It appears that MUISet doesn't like being called from
inside it.  I do plan to get this archives together, but I just started
full time work along with a contract job I have, plus I need to make some
updates to SimpleFTP *and* work on the Windows version of SimpleFTP a bit.

I'm not sure of the exact terms that you *should* use to describe it, but I
would say that it's a piece of code you include in your programs that can
be called repeatidly by library functions and such....sort of like an
interrupt except it's software controlled and not hardware controlled.

I really have to get back to writing the bind stuff for that at some point,
and figuring out what it doesn't work on UAE.

Hi Davide

Sorry for the long reply, but you asked for it :)

>    I would like to know how to make an hook !!! Everyone write their own
> hook for list and for other thing...
> 
>    I don't know (in 1st place) what an hook is exactly !! and second I

A hook is simply a function that you have written to extend the abilities of an 
OS function, combined with a Hook newtype which contains information about 
calling the hook function.

Normally, you pass the address of the Hook newtype in a TagList (do you know 
about TagLists?) to the OS function and your function will get called by the OS 
function.

In the Hook newtype you'll find something like this:

NEWTYPE Hook
    h_MinNode.MinNode
	*h_Entry.l
	*h_SubEntry.l
	*h_Data.l
END NEWTYPE


You don't really need to bother about the h_MinNode field.


The h_Entry field is the address of the routine which gets called by the OS 
function. Parameters are passed to this routine in the following registers:
  a0 - pointer to the Hook newtype itself
  a1 - pointer to parameter structure ("message").
  a2 - Hook specific address data ("object").
The use of those last two depend on what OS function you are extending.


Obviously, because we are using a high level language, we want to write our 
hook function in Blitz. The standard way of having the parameters layed out in 
the high level language function is:
    Function{Hook, object, message}
Note the order of parameters - NOT in order a0,a1,a2! This gives us a problem 
since Blitz functions cannot take parameters in address registers. This is what 
the h_SubEntry field is for. You make the h_SubEntry field point to the high 
level language function you have written as the hook function. You then make 
the h_Entry field point to a small assembly language routine which puts the 
parameters in the correct place and calls the routine pointed to by the 
h_SubEntry field.


The h_Data field is for user use and can be anything you want, for example if 
you needed to pass extra data structures to the hook function you could set up 
a pointer to those here.


There are additional problems using hook functions in Blitz. One is that you 
cannot be guarunteed about the contents of the address register that is used to 
access your global variables (a5). This means  that you must store it somewhere 
before calling any hooks, and restore it before you call the Blitz function. 
Another is that the Blitz debugger does not like being used inside functions 
which have been called from a hook, so you need to put RunErrsOff....RunErrsOn 
around the function.


A piece of assembly language which you can use to put the parameters in the 
correct order and call the Blitz function is this (this is what you would make 
the h_Entry field point to):

_hookEntry:
    movem.l d2/a5,-(a7)       ; Preserve non-scratch registers we alter
    move.l  a1,d2             ; Make the message the third parameter
    move.l  a2,d1             ; The object is the second parameter
    move.l  a0,d0             ; The hook is the first parameter
    move.l  globalbase(pc),a5 ; restore our global variable base
    move.l  12(a0),a0         ; get pointer to high level language function
    jsr     6(a0)             ; call the high level language function
    movem.l (a7)+,d2/a5       ; Restore non-scratch registers we altered
    rts
globalbase: Ds.l 1            ; Some space for preserving global variable base

(Scratch registers on the Amiga are registers that have been designated as 
registers that can have their contents changed when calling functions, and are 
not guarunteed to be restored after the function. These registers are d0, d1, 
a0 and a1. This means we can change them and not need to preserve them since 
the piece of code that called our routine should not assume that the contents 
of these register will be the same when we are finished.)

You will be able to use that piece of assembly language for all the h_Entry 
field of all your hooks.

To set up a Hook newtype, you can write some code like this:

DEFTYPE.Hook myhook            ; Define the Hook variable
myhook\h_Entry = ?_hookEntry   ; Make h_Entry point to the ASM routine above
myhook\h_SubEntry = ?hookfunc  ; Make h_SubEntry point to the Blitz function
                               ; we want to use as the hook function
myhook\h_Data = $DEADBEEF      ; This can be anything you want


At the top of your program somewhere you would need to put this line (so that 
the global variable base register is preserved):

move.l a5,globalbase


Finally, you have your Blitz function which you are using as the hook function:

RunErrsOff
hookfunc:        ; This is the label that you use in the h_SubEntry field
                 ; as shown above
Function.l MyHookFunc{*hook.Hook, *object.l, *message.l}
    ; You can of course make the object and message parameters have any type
    ; you want, so that they are more easily used.

    ; Obviously you would do whatever you need in here. Any value that you
    ; return from this function will be the value returned to the OS function
    ; by the hook.
End Function
RunErrsOn


Then, when you call the OS function you are extending, it will normally have a 
tag that you can specify a hook for. You would do that by passing the address 
of the myhook variable in this example (using &myhook).


If you want more than one hook in a program, the easiest think to do is set up 
a few Hook newtype variables and give them all the same h_Entry (the one above 
should be OK for all) and then a different h_SubEntry, calling the appropriate 
function.


The example I put on Aminet (using the ASL screen mode requester) is slightly 
wrong, in that it does not use the parameters for the Blitz function in the 
standard order as I have described in this email, above. However all the rest 
is pretty much the same.

@NODE "Mail_149" " Shape commands size limit? "
From: Damir Arh <damir.arh@telesat.si>
Date: 08-31-00 09:13:18
Subject: @{b}Shape commands size limit?@{ub}

Hello!

Are there by any chance any shape size limits for the shape commands to work
correctly? The CopyShape and Scale commands somehow corrupt the shapes when
they are too big. I've written the following test program:

Print "Filename: "
filename$=Edit$(256)

If Exists(filename$)=0 Then End

ILBMInfo filename$
width.l = ILBMWidth
height.l = ILBMHeight
dept.l = ILBMDepth

InitShape 0,width,height,dept
ShapesBitMap 0,1
LoadBitMap 1,filename$
LoadPalette 1,filename$
MakeCookie 0

Screen 0,0,0,640,512,8,$8004,"",1,1
ScreensBitMap 0,0
Use Palette 1
Cls 0

;CopyShape 0,1
;Scale 0,0.5,0.5
ClipBlit 0,0,0

MouseWait

End

When I try to run any picture with the following program, it gets displayed
correctly but as soon as I use either one of the two commented commands
(when uncommenting CopyShape I also blit the shape 1 instead of  0) the
picture gets corrupted, though that doesn't happen with smaller pictures.
The problem picture has an approximate size of 600x400 but with the sizes of
app. 150x150 none of the problems appear.

Am I missing something or are these commands really buggy when it comes to
bigger pictures? What could I do to solve this problem?

Kind regards

There are limits which are caused by Blitz supporting the OCS blitter. I think 
that limit is 1024x1024 pixels.

It's weird that it cannot handle simply copying the shape. Try putting a 
WaitBlitter (or maybe WaitBlit_) command before the ClipBlit.

Hmmm.. yes.I had this problem,but not with these commands.

It seems to be because the '_allbpmem' entry in the .shape newtype is a word,the size is limited by certain commands which use '_allbpmem'.

The problem I had was with SaveShapes.I've attached by fix for it.
It probably won't help much,though.

Probably because '_allbpmem' doesn't go above 32768 in this case.

All I can think of is to replace the commands with your own routines.Sorry :(

Yes, there is an example in the Blitz section - but it only works for AGA
systems.

Also along the same lines, try my PicScale program - it is in the FreeWare
section on the site.
It uses an improved method (through the OS) which should work on any system.
It also uses datatypes for loading the picture, so it can read any picture
format.

If you think it might be useful, I can send you the source...

There's no OS function for finding the backmost screen, so I doubt there's a 
Blitz function for it.

However, going through the list of screens I have open, the last screen seems 
to be at the end of the list starting from the frontmost screen (FirstScreen in 
intuitionbase). You could do something like this:

Function.l FindBackScreen{}
  *ib.IntuitionBase = IntuitionBase
  iblock.l = LockIBase_(0)
  *fscr.Screen = *ib\FirstScreen
  if *fscr
    while *fscr\NextScreen
      *fscr = *fscr\NextScreen
    wend
  end if
  UnlockIBase_ iblock
  function return *fscr
End Function

*scr.Screen = FindBackScreen{}
ScreenToFront_ *scr

Nothing - the way it works is this:

In order to eleminate a blitz library from being included in your exec
(thereby shrinking the file size) you must eleminate EVERY command that is
contained in that library.

Since you apparently didn't do that, you still have the entire Blitz library
included, plus the additional code to call the OS functions.

I don't recall at the moment, but I think the above commands are all in the
Screen library, so to eliminate it you would have to change all the screen
commands to OS ones.

If you are trying to reduce your exec size, have a look at my Investigator
program, on my website in the Blitz section.

It can examine your source and tell you which Blitz libraries were used, and
(fairly accurately) how many times each command was used.



It will help you decide which libraries you can easily eliminate and which
ones were used so much that it would be pointless...

As this is true, does anyone know how to replace FindScreen and HideScreen

Exactly -- you need to replace all commands in a particular library (the
Blitz Screen library calls in this case), which isn't always possible with
what's in StatsFuncs, so sometimes it'll result in smaller programs,
sometimes not, depending on what other commands you've used in your program.
A lot of it is just meant as examples of how to call OS functions, some of
it's just gimmicky...I was bored... ;)

Right, for the 3rd time in two weeks ;)

See attached for the FindScreen thing (never really tried to actually use it
as a replacement, it was more of an exercise really)...there's a screen-name
and public-name matcher too, which can come in handy for screen library
stuff...

And I did do something that detects the middle mouse...I'll try and dig it
out...yep! Attached!

As for HideScreen, I think "ScreenToBack_ *scr" was the command, where *scr
is a pointer to the screen?

It works pretty well - the only problem is, that some Blitz libraries seem
to have internal "tokens" in them (IE, ones that aren't user commands)  so
it sometimes will return the wrong command name, but always the correct
library that is being used.

I never did figure out how to recognize these  :(

I patched it to work with all the libraries I have, but you might find it
listing commands that you didn't use.

There is also a companion program  on my site called Library Investigator,
which simply gives you a listing of all your available Blitz libraries, and
can send it to your printer, to a file, or simply to it's window - it can
also be set to be called up onto your SuperTed editor's screen - handy for
knowing what library a particular command is coming from...

FindScreen is tricky, but not impossible - you'd first have to get the
pointer to the screen you want to use (there is some stuff in Jame's
StatsFuncts that shows how to do this for the WorkBench)

If you are opening your own screen through the OS functions, you already
have the pointer returned to you by the function.

Then you would copy the information from the OS's screen structure into a
Blitz screen object.

You  have to be careful to return the screen pointer in the Blitz object to
0 before you try to end your program, though - otherwise Blitz would try to
free the screen when it exits...


HideScreen is easy - just use the OS function:

ScreenToBack_()

You only have to give it  the pointer to the screen you want to hide....

I had the same problem, and I had to single step through one of the
Blitz lib programs to figure out the logic... I wrote a C program that
was able to handle the internal tokens, so that should be a lot easier
to understand.  I'll dig up the source for you.

I'm sure I sent an explanation of the blitz library format to the list with an 
example program to read information from it. Its also on B2k. The only problem 
is that I don't think I figured out how to do some types of parameters, such as 
the vararg ones and things because some libraries cause a total brain 
heamorrage of stuff to get printed when it isn't there (the RomulusPrintLib is 
one I think).

I'd also be interested in seeing Julian's C version.

Hey Tony,

The string format in blitz 2.1 seems to be

-8  BufferLen.l        - Length of the allocated space for string to grow
-4  StringLen.l         - Actual Length of string
0    Data                 - String Length Bytes
(StringLen) PAD.b  - Zero end of string

Note: if BufferLen=StringLen and is even (ie / 2) then pad is .w, as
allocated
memory is always even

On top of that you have the allocmem data (-12 is size of allocated memory
for whole structure, -16 is next item in the mem list) in a normally
allocated string.

You could fix a string into a dc statment, and then do something like

*Something.s=?MyString

But I have a feeling blitz does not let you use pointers with it`s basic
types.

Not sure that helps but you could write a machine code routine to point a
real blitz string at your static one, bit messy but I don`t see why it
wouldn`t work.

Good luck,

Dave

LOL

There won't be a finished article, coz I can't get it to work.

I can define the strings properly (thanks to you and Dave), but I
can't persuade Bltz to recognize them as variables.

I was just looking at my initialization code (where I define a couple
of hundred string variables) and discovered that a simple a$ = "a"
type command takes 10 lines of ASM including 2 JSR instructions.  
Seemed like a pretty huge overhead so I was trying to eliminate it.

Can't do it though and I'm not going to waste any more time trying.

Cheers

What that does though is frees the memory for the previous string, allocates
some new memory and copies the string into the memory for the variable. Daves
idea of a "CludgeString" command would be OK as long as you remembered to
unitialise the string before you let Blitz free it.

I understand what it is doing (now that you've explained it), but it
still seems a pretty inefficient way of doing things.    I discovered
that you can set up a string constant

Fred  dc.b "A Constant",0

and then reference it with Peek.s(?Fred), but it doesn't seem
worthwhile.

Pity Blitz doesn't use null terminated strings directly.   How about

DEFTYPE.0 Fred   ;   zero defines a null-terminated string

or DEFTYPE.15   Fred2  ;  non-zero number defines a fixed-length string

An idea for Pure Basic Fred??

Actually there is probably a rather good reason for it being this way. It seems
to me (although I am very not 100% sure :) that they kind of made general code
that could set value for multiple types of object, all in the same way so that
adding an object type isn't going to be difficult later on. 

Not that I have any clue as to what kind of oject that might be mind you :)

Anyway, just my 2 cents, or pennies, or pfennigs or something :)

You're right, it'll copy it into some temporary memory and then pass that to
whatever you are using the string for. If it is being assigned to another string
variable, it will actually copy it *again* from the temporary biuffer to the
actual memory for the string :(

Eh, all strings in Blitz are NULL terminated?

But you can't just define a null-terminated string in a fixed
length area of memory and use it as a variable.    You have to go to
all the overhead associated with variable length memory areas.

I didn't explain the fixed-length bit properly.    I guess that's what
I was hoping MAXLEN would do.    Unfortunately not.

And I would imagine that the same bit of code is used for all the string
declarations in your program, rather than adding it again for each string
you define.  Did you test for that?

Oh, OK. If you use a lot of your own routines and OS routines then you could
possibly use them (fixed, dc.b type strings), since you can make your own routines take longwords (as the address) instead of the string, and all OS routines have to have the address
passed, and not the actual string variable.

    PureBasic use normal string formats, with no size or anything. For
now.... The drawback is string operations which are much slower than Blitz2
one.. But you don't need to use any tricks to declare strings in PB.

    Fred.s = "Hello" is like:

    Fred.s = PeekS(@Fred)

    Fred: DC.b "Hello",0
