Logo was designed to teach children the basics of programing and 
simple mathematical shapes. It uses simple commands to move a cursor 
on the screen in different directions procduceing simple shapes, it 
can also be used as a tool for exploring fractal shapes useing 
recursive programing.

                    Here are the list of commands:
                   --------------------------------
