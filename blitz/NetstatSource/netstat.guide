 @{fg fill}The what's, the why's and the wherefore's...@{fg text}

 Okay, so I started this as a programming exercise.  I wanted to start
 programming again, and I'ld previously  bought Blitz basic 2 on a whim,
 so I thought I'ld start with something simple...

 I wanted a timer program that would not only sense automatically when I
 went on and off line, but could also create and analyse a log file that
 would make sense in terms of the phonebills I recieve.  Most of the
 programs I'ld downloaded from Aminet created logfiles, but it was a tedious
 matter of editing the resulting file by hand, or downloading a third party
 logfile analyser to get something close to what I wanted.  Thus NetStat
 was born.

 Boring really wasn't it :)

 Updates of this program, when I get round to it, can be found on my
 website, at:
 Http://www.so-watts.demon.co.uk/contr.html

 Check in every now and again.

@{b} Xen.font 8@{ub} - Don't flame me!! I'll get round to font sensitivity in a bit.
        In the mean time, it looks nice on my workbench, and the number 
        of programs I've used that are fixed at 11 point are too 
        numerous to mention.  This is my little vendetta!

 No efforts are made to check for the existance of any of these, so if the 
 program won't start, giving funny error messages, then it's something to 
 do with these three things!!  Probably!

 Well, until I get round to writing an installer for this little gem, I'm

 drag the unarchived directory into a suitable place on your hard  drive,
 and add the assign "netstat:" to point at your chosen directory.  I tried
 to avoid having to make an assign, but it was so much easier in the long
 run to make it!  Sorry!

 There are a number of @{"TOOLTYPES" link "tooltypes" 0} or CLI args for
 the main executable, which you may like to set first.  Tooltypes take 
 precedance over any settings in the prefs file.
 
 The first time you use the program you'll see an error message saying 
 that the prefs file couldn't be found.  The default prefs are set to 
 British TeleScam's current time bands and rates @{b}BEFORE@{ub} VAT.  Press
 'LAmiga P' to go to the @{"prefs screen" link "prefs" 0}. Set your prefs and
 remember to save the settings before you leave the screen.
 
 When you go online press 'Start', when you come offline press 'Stop'.

 The plugins feature is still somewhat of a work in progress.  At the 
 moment, just drop a program into the plugins directory and it will appear 
 on the 'External' menu.  It is also possible to place Arexx scripts here (
 but not Dos as yet).
 
 Selecting the plugin from the menu will either run the program as a
 background task, or run the script.  If a script is run,  Netstat will
 appear to have stopped until the script is finished.  This is normal, and 
 is somewhat unavoidable I'm afraid.  Therefore, if you use a script to 
 launch a program, make sure that the script 'RUN's the program (starts a 
 new process.)
 
 N.B.  I think it is quite likely that any program run this way will act 
 as if it was launched from Shell.

 have it appear on your Web Browser screen if you so desire!!
 
 Clicking on the 'Hide Interface' button will cause it to 'iconify'.
 
 Clicking on 'Remove' will log your call (if wanted) and quit the program.
 
 Clicking on the Active/Inactive cycle gadget does sod all!!
 
 It is also possible to set up a hotkey (default is 'CTRL LALT n'), which 
 cycles between the 3 size states, Maximized, Minimized and Iconified.  In 
 a minimized state, a title bar will be displayed with time online and 
 cost.

 The Arexx Port for the first copy launched  is 'NETSTAT.1',  then 
 'NETSTAT.2' and so on.
 
 Only a couple of commands are available at the moment.  It's kind of 
 difficult to imagine the need for any others, although I have considered 
 allowing all the prefs to be changed via arexx.  Might result in some 
 interesting functions.  Let me know what aspects of the program you want 
 to be controllable via Arexx.
 
 At the moment, only Netstat is controllable from arexx.  I'll probably 
 get around to adding arexx to the Analyser at some point.
 
 @{b}The Commands@{ub}
 
 START   -  Do any of these actually need explaining?
 STOP    -  I think not!! :)
 RESET   -  All commands do exactly the same as the menu options.
 QUIT    -  At least, they should :)
 
 EXTERNAL - Launches an external 'plugin'.  EXTERNAL 0 would launch the 
            first plugin on the 'External' Menu.
 SCRIPT - Runs an arexx script from the 'arexx' menu.  Syntax as EXTERNAL.
 SIZE  - This has 3 values.   0=Maximize Window

 When started, the NetAnalyser will automatically scan the logfile as 
 defined in the TOOLTYPE @{"'LOGFILE'" link "tooltypes" 50}.  If this isn't present then it will 
 look in S: for a valid file.  The program will quit if neither is found.
 
 If a valid logfile is found, then the Analyser will build a database of
 calls and costs.  This may take a while if your logfile is particularly
 big.
 
 Once the database is built, a small window will open with a few results 
 displayed.  First call, last call and number of calls.  You will then be 
 given the option of calculating costs from a certain point, either by
 entering the call number, or by clicking on the 'L' gadget and selecting
 a call from the Listview.
 
 It's then just a matter of clicking on the 'GO' button, and NetAnalyser
 will add up all the costs from the point you selected.
 
 At this point you will be given the option of deleting some of the 
 records in you logfile.  Selecting 'maintenance' from the menu will pop 
 up another small window with a single numner and date.  Again the value can
 be entered by either typing a number into the box, or clicking on the 'L'
 gadget and selecting a date from the listview.  This time however, you must
 select the last record you want to delete!  Click on go and your logfile 
 will be ammended.   Cool huh!!
 
 Alternatively, clicking on the 'More' button will pop up another window 
 displaying a couple of graphs and some averages.  Trivial stuff, but fun 
 to know I think :)
 
 
@{fg shine} *New for v1.35*@{fg text}
 
 Leaving NetAnalyser on the first totals screen whilst having NetStat 
 online will dynamically update the totals! (Only if 'UPDATE' @{"tooltype" link "tooltypes" 0} is

 I can't be bothered to write a whole new section for this, so here's the 
 very basic .readme that I wrote for my registered users.
 
 **************************************************************************
 
 
 NetSpeak 1.1 - A *very* experimental plugin for NetStat 1.8 (i.e. use at
 your own risk)


 This one's for you Bablos, you asked for it - you got it :)

 Netspeak will play a sample at a given interval whilst NetStat is running
 and 'Online'.

 When first run it willl analyse the script 'netstat:samples'.  In example
 script is included, but the basic format is:

 1 doh 5 woohoo repeat 10

 This plays the sample named 'doh' on when the online counter reaches 1
 minute, then woohoo at 5 minutes and every subsequent 10 minutes (15,25,35
 etc).

 The samples to be played, must be in the directory 'netstat:sounds' and
 must be in Amiga IFF format.

 *** WARNING ***

 For some unknown reason, NetSpeak has been known to guru the machine if
 quit with Netstat still running.  I have absolutely no idea why it does
this,
 but I'm looking into it.  It exits just fine without Netstat running, so
make
 sure you quit Netstat first.

 I am not to be held responsible if you lose any important information when
 running this program.  You have been warned.

 * Known BUGS/Features *

 Occasionally guru's machine if quit with Netstat running Guru's machine if
 quit while sample is playing Actually plays sample 1 second too late - eek,
 major one this ;)

 No other known bugs (probably means there are loads)

 @{fg shine}The Plugin API@{fg text}
 
 This isn't really a proper API, and I doubt very much whether anyone will 
 ever use it, but I thought I better include it anyway.
 
 Basically, the only way of Netstat giving information to other programs 
 is (potentially) via Arexx and environment variables.  At the moment, 
 there is no way of getting anything via the arexx port, although if it's 
 asked for then I'll include it in a later release.  However, two 
 environment variables are set when Netstat is online, these are 'NetTime' 
 and 'NetCost', giving total time (in seconds) and total cost of calls so 
 far.  There are more variables floating about internally, and again, if
 they are requested I'll include them.  The variables are updated 
 depending on the SETENV tooltype (default is every 1 second).
 
 And that's it.
 
 Boring really!!

 @{i}AmiPPP, PPP and Miami@{ui}
 
 I haven't found a way of autosensing these as yet (Miami is still relying 
 somewhat on me bludgeoning the Blitz list people into explaining 
 Arexx integration!)  In the mean time there is a real kludgy way of 
 achieving the desired results.
 
 Most people use arexx scripts to launch there TCP stacks or whatever, and 
 AmiPPP has a little feature that allows you to execute a script when it 
 goes on and offline.  To utilize autosensing with these types, just 
 ammend your rexx scripts with the following lines:
 
 When going Online (preferably after the modem has connected)
 
 address command
 setenv slip0state Online
 
 And when going offline:
 
 address command
 setenv slip0state Offline
 
 
 Hopefully this should work!
 
 
 Alternatively, you could just use Arexx with the START and STOP commands 
 :)

@node "prefs" "NetStat - Prefs"
@next "tooltypes"
@prev "Hints"
  @{b}Prefs@{ub}
 
 The @{"pref window" system "multiview netstat:docs/prefs.iff"} is split into a number of different sections.
 
 Primarily, there are the three time bands.  Times must be entered from 
 left to right in 24 hour format.  Obviously, time bands must meet and 
 cover the whole 24 hour period.  The error checking for this at the 
 moment is somewhat sketchy.  I think it is possible to set rather odd 
 time bands.  If you do do this, then don't blame me if your harddrive 
 formats itself or something ;) (N.B.  Nowhere in this program is there a 
 routine that formats your harddrive!!!) :)
 
 To the right of the 5 time bands are the prices for each band.  Prices 
 are in pence per minute.  (Very English I'm afraid!)
 
 
 The second section has a number of gadgets.  From top to bottom they are:
 
 @{b}Timeout:@{ub}  NetStat can give you a warning when you have been  online for a
 set period.  The timeout value is set in minutes.  When you readch the 
 timeout period, you will be asked if you want to log off.  If you do then
 the script defined by the tooltypes @{"'SCRIPTFILE'" link "tooltypes" 24} and @{"'ARGS'" link "tooltypes" 27} will be
 executed. To disable the timeout feature, just give it a value of 0!
 
 @{b}Logging:@{ub} A check gadget that decides whether you want your calls to be 
 logged or not.  Calls are logged to the file specified in the logfile 
 string, or by the @{"LOGFILE" link "tooltypes" 21} tooltype.
 
 @{b}Delay:@{ub} This is there because it may take a  little time for the
 autosenseing feature to kick in.  Count the number of  seconds it takes
 from when the remote modem picks up, to the time Netstat  starts, and
 bang the number into the box.
 
 @{b}Crash Logging:@{ub} Check this box if you want a 'to  the nearest minute' 
 log of your call incase of crashes (very useful I find).  Crash logs
 will be analysed and added to the logfile the next time Netstat is
 started. 
 
 @{b}Currency:@{ub} Type in the symbol that your country uses for it's currency.
 
 @{b}Totals:@{ub}  Netstat has three modes of operation. 'Single', 'Session' and 
 'Daily'.  In Single mode, each call will be totalled seperately.  With 
 Session, every call that you make while Netstat is running will be 
 totalled together, giving you a running cost.  Daily is similar to 
 Session, only a small file is written to disk after every call. Netstat 
 can then show your totals even when it has been quit and started again.
 Daily totals are reset at Midnight even if you are still in the same 
 session.  This may change in the future.  See also the tooltype @{"SHOW." link "tooltypes" 32}
 
 @{b}Show Date:@{ub} With this checked Netstat will display the date in the main 
 window.  You can now use Netstat as a complete WBClock replacement :)
 N.B.  Changing this while Netstat is running might have strange side 
 effects to the display.  Best to save the prefs, then quit and restart.
 See also @{"SHOWDATE." link "tooltypes" 40}
 
 @{b}Format:@{ub} This gadget is inactive unless Show Date is selected.  Users have 
 the choice between showing dates as dd/mm/yy or mm/dd/yy.  See also 
 @{"DATEFORMAT." link "tooltypes" 42}
 N.B. Changing this will only have affect after the next hour change.  Wierd
that! :) 
 
 @{b}Hotkey:@{ub} Type in a valid hotkey in the box provided, and at the touch of a
 few buttons you  can have Netstat jumping all over the place :) (See
 @{"Commodities" link "commod" 0}
 
 @{b}Logfile:@{ub} A string gadget to say where you want you logfile kept.  Default 
 is Netstat:data/netstat.log.
 
 @{b}Save:@{ub} Save your prefs!  Wierd!
 
 @{b}Use:@{ub} Use your prefs.  Strange!!

 @{b}NetStat@{ub}
 
 CLI arguments are exactly the same as there TOOLTYPEs.
 
 Settings made with tooltypes take precedance over settings 
 in prefs files.  Bizarrely, at the moment CLI args don't! :/
 
 WINX=x         - Sets the X position of the main window
 WINY=y         - Sets the y position of the main window
 MONITOR=type   - Decides which type of Online monitoring you require.
                  Currently only supports the values 'SLIP', and 'CARRIER'.
                  SLIP is useful for those with AmiTCP and slip device, 
                  whereas CARRIER can be used with all TCP stacks, this
                  method may not work with serial cards though.  Netstat
                  can also be stopped and started via it's @{"Arexx port." link "arexx" 0}

 PREFSFILE=file - Sets the full path to the prefsfile.  Strange that!
                  The default is 'Netstat:data/netstat.prefs'.
 LOGFILE=file   - Sets the full path to the logfile.  It's useful if this is
                  the same as the NetAnalyser tooltype!  
                  The default is 'Netstat:data/netstat.log'.
 STOPSCRIPT=file - This is used in conjunction with the TIMEOUT feature.
                  Netstat can automatically execute a specified script that 
                  will terminate your connection to the internet
 ARGS=args      - Sets the arguments (if any) needed for your STOPSCRIPT
 SETENV=secs    - Number of seconds between ENV: updates (default=1)
 SMALL/S        - Starts the program off minimized to a bar.
 ICONIFY/S      - Starts the program Iconified.
 BARLENGTH=length - Specifies the length of the title bar when minimized.
 SHOW=type      - Can be either 'SESSION' or 'DAILY'.  This affects how 
                  Netstat displays subsequent calls.  It can either, show 
                  a total for the number of calls since you started the 
                  program (session), or the total calls you have made 
                  today (daily).  @{i}N.B.  For daily totalling, a small file 
                  has to be written to your harddrive after every call.  
                  This is unlikely to cause any problems! The default is 
                  to show the totals for just the current call.@{ui}
  SHOWDATE/S    - With this tooltype set, the date will be displayed in the
                  main window.  (See also 'DATEFORMAT')
  DATEFORMAT=n  - Can be either 0, or 1. 0=dd/mm/yy 1=mm/dd/yy.  Pretty
                  irrelevant if SHOWDATE isn't set.  Default is 0.
  STARTDAILY=n  - If you have SHOW=DAILY set, then this will affect what 
                  Netstat considers a day to be.  On previous versions, a day
                  was from 00:00 to 23:59, this can now be set to whatever 
                  you want.  I.e, from 07:00 to 06:59.  Numbers must be in 
                  the range 0 to 23, and only whole hours are excepted.
                  
  
 N.B. All filenames should be outside quotation marks. I.E. 
 LOGFILE=s:netstat.log @{b}NOT@{ub} LOGFILE="s:netstat.log"

 N.B.2.  All though you can have both 'SMALL' and 'ICONIFY' specified, 
 there really is no point.  It won't do any damage though (I think) :)

 LOGFILE=file   - Points at where your log file is kept.  Set this to be the
                  same as the tooltype for NetStat.
 VAT=rate%      - Adds the set percentage VAT to the total cost of your
                  calls.  Remember to only use this if your call prices
                  are set to NOT include VAT in the main prefs.
 DISCOUNT=rate% - Subtracts the set percentage from your call cost total.
                  This is for people who have set there ISP on BT's Family
                  and Friends (10%), or who have Premierline (15%).  I have
                  both for a whopping 25% off, and boy do I need it :)
 BILLFILE=file  - Points to the file you would like the summary reports 
                  outputted to.
 UPDATE/S       - If this tooltype is present and NetStat is currently 
                  running and Online, then the total time and cost will 
                  dynamically update.
 DOLLAR/S       - Show's prices with the '$' sign instead of '£'.

                  'Netstat:samples'
 SAMPLEDIR=dir     - Directory in which all the samples are kept. Default 
                  is 'Netstat:sounds/'

@prev "menus"
 2/3/98

 * Released source code to public domain.  I can't be arse with it any
   more!  Sorry about the state of the code.


 20/8/97

 * Will now allow multiple Arexx ports, and multiple commodities
 * New 'STARTDAILY' tooltype

 ?

 * New progress indicators for NetAnalyser


 5/7/97

 * Made loads of changes to prefs GUI, and to prefs files.  Made prefs file
   convertor to get over change.  Waste of time really!
 * Added a locale of sorts.  User definable currency symbols.
 * Added a date gadget for those that want


 4/7/97

 * Added basis of daily totalling.

 3/7/97

 * Added preliminary carrier detection to Netstat.


 21/6/97 - NetAnalyser V1.38

 * Fixed problem with ?'s appearing in max values and stupidly long log
   files
 * Added scaling to silly stats graphs.  Should stop the graphs 'maxing
   out'.


 17/6/97 - NetAnalyser V1.37

 * Fixed 'stack overflow' problems with large logs
 * Added daily averages to Silly Stats
 * Added progress indicator when building database.  Why won't this work
   when analysing though?

 27/5/97 - V1.8.3 etc

 * Removed 'Holiday' feature.  It's a popular conception that BT charge
   weekend rates on a bank holiday, but upon checking my phone bill from the
   last one, it seems I was wrong.  Whoops!  Sorry :/

 13/5/97

 * Totally changed the way that Crash Logging works - much easier, much
   quicker.  I have no idea why I implimented it the way I did before!

 12/5/97

 * Fixed CrashLog routine again. Whoops
 * New 'BARLENGTH' Tooltype Added

 29/4/97 - V1.8.2/V1.36/V1

 * Fixed a silly little bug in NetAnalyser that calculated dynamic totals
   wrong.  Whoops!
 * Added 'Update' tooltype to Analyser, incase people don't want dynamic
   updates.

 20/4/97
 
 * Discovered I'ld broken the crashlog routine.  Fixed again!
 * Reduced CPU load a little more.  Makes it a bit unresponsive!

 16/4/97

 * Managed to get CPU load down to around 3% when in normal mode

 11/4/97 - V1.8.1/V1.35/V1

 * I'm a bit behind on my history.  V1 of Netspeak done.
 * Added ability to Iconify program
 * Added definable period for Env: settings
 * More tooltypes and arexx commands to reflect these additions

 29/3/97 - V1.8/V1.35
 * Added bank holiday stuff

 20/3/97
 * Added the ability to quit with Ctrl-C from shell.
 * Cleaned up code a bit.
 * Fixed a small bug in Analyser.

 18/3/97
 * Added Arexx control to NetStat!!!!!

 17/3/97
 * Added another 2 time zones in prefs - resulted in yet another change in
   the prefs file.
 * Fixed a rather dramatic bug that caused an infinite loop in the crashlog
   if it held a value greater than an hour.
 * Added a small summary log option in Analyser.  Prints a text file with 
   analysed totals.  Useful for keeping track of your bills.
 * Realised I'm getting lost in my own code.  Need to anotate a bit better.

 12/3/97 - v1.75/v1.33
 * Added Definable Hotkey (minimize/maximize/jump screen)
 * Added Delay factor
 * Changed a bit of internal code, probably created a load of bugs in the
   process!
 * Changed Prefs file format again - sorry!

 10/3/97 - v1.74/v1.33
 * Finally sorted out the problems with the Listviews.  They now behave as
   they should after logfile maintenance!
 * Changed the choice section, so you can now analyse a range of calls.

 9/3/97
 * Analyser now shows daily totals - just looks like a simplified logfile
   really.
 * Fixed some bugs that cropped up in the averages bit.  Switched to
   floating point maths.  Seems to have done the job!
 * Fixed a problem in the plugins section that caused Netstat to seem as if
   it had stopped. However, this is a partial fix, as icon tooltypes in
   plugin are ignored. :/

 6/3/97
 * Added more stats to the NetAnalyser.  Now displays a couple of graphs,
   plus some averages.  Silly stuff really! :)

 4/3/97 - 1.73
 * Added 'plugin' support.  This is more for future stuff as there's no API
   as yet.  Still working on this.
 * Possibly finally got timeout feature working.  Should run both Dos and
   Arexx scripts!
 * Added CLI arguments at last - Now startable from Shell!
 / Unfortunately, for further ease of programming, added the need to make
   the logical assign Netstat:
 * Added 'SMALL' tooltype - Starts the program off minimized

 2/3/97
 * Fixed a small bug in the crash log routine that caused the program to
   write an invalid logfile if the computer crashed when online for less
   than 1 minute!
 * Tooltypes now saved to icon when prefs are saved
 * Finally added a somewhat esoteric commodities exchange interface
 * Reversed the history file as I was bored of scrolling to the bottom to
   add stuff :)

 25/2/97 - 1.72
 - Released a version to Aminet, then realised that there was a small bug.
   Whoops.  Sorry guys :/  Fixed now though!

 23/2/97  - 1.71
 * New Feature (Whooo!!) - Crash Logging.  If selected, a small file is
   written to the hard drive every minute.  This provides a 'to the nearest
   minute' log of your call in the event of a crash!  The crashlog is
   analysed at startup, and a proper log record is made.  Coool!! :)

 20/2/97 - 1.7
 * Changed error message routines so that all errors are reported using
   reqtools requesters.  They don't look as nice, but it's a damned site
   easier to do, and requires less code.  Needs reqtools.library though!
 * Almost got the Timeout feature working now!  Having problems getting
   it to run external scripts though :/
 * Sorted out a couple of gliches in the prefs loading error trapping, and
   the 'save as' routines.  Late night coding has it's drawbacks!
 * Changed the 'About' window to a retools requester.  Took out the stupid
   graphic that was causing me loads of hassle.  Doesn't look quite as nice
   but it's more functional!

 18/2/97
 * Changed Cyclegadgets to Listviews - much much much much nicer :)
 - Discovered that Miami 2 has it's own logging procedure - contemplating
   adding support for analysing this file, but it's in a yicky format, so I
   might stick to basic Miami support (use own timer).  Need to learn
   Blitz/Arexx support to do this.  Haven't I said this before???
 * Added filerequesters to save and load prefs as other than default and
   save the log file to somewhere other than s:netstat.log.  At the moment
   there is only a small amount of error checking to see if the files are
    valid!!

 17/2/97
 * Now possible to delete records from the logfile.
 * Started preliminary timeout warning in main program so you can limit time
   you spend online.

 15/2/97
 * Added DISCOUNT tooltype to NetAnalyser
 * Fixed a little bug that caused the program to rescan if the close gadget
   was selected

 10/2/97
 * Changed billing to per-second. This has created a small flaw in the way
   cost is calculated. Nothing too major, but a little puzzling
 * Moved prefsfile to S: just to be awkward :)

 8/2/97
 * Oh bugger - The midnight bug pops up again - aaaaaaargh!!! Found and
   squashed as quickly - stupid typo.  I must have been tired :)
 - Time zone calculation still seems to be somewhat ary though, I thought
   I'ld sorted that out! :(
 * Neatened up some of the GUI
 * Crossed fingers that  I've sorted out time zone calculations once and for
   all.  I tested a bit more thoroughly this time :)
 * Moved logfile to S: - LOGFILE tooltype added for future

 7/2/97
 * NetAnalyser can now be launched from NetStat (found a working copy of
   ElmoresDosLibrary!!)
 * NetStat constantly monitors for Slip0State.  Automatically starts when
   online detected.  This works with AmiTCP using SLIP device.  If I find out
   ways of detecting other TCP stack status' then I'll hopefully implement
   that. (Works with my setup though!!) :)

 6/2/97
 * Added some stuff to NetAnalyser.  There's strange behaviour when you
   select the last record to analyse from.  Must investigate this!
 * Fixed a stupid error in NetAnalyser!!
 * V1.5 Uploaded to WebSite.

 4/2/97
 * Fixed Logging bug - sheesh, what a hassle
 * I think I've fixed the time band bug
 * Tooltypes now work - yay!! :)
 * Took all VAT calculations out of main program and put them into the
   logfile analyser.  All that bug hunting for nothing - still, much simpler
   this way!
 * Rudimentary NetAnalyser completed

 3/2/97
 * Hopefully fixed the 'midnight' bug
 + Added window position Tooltypes. They don't work though :(
 * Found a really stupid bit of duplicated code - should cut CPU useage
   no-end :)
 + Added a few extra little things
 - Found a bug in the time band procedure
 - Created a new bug in logging procedure - appears to not log VAT :/

 2/2/97
 * Hopefully stopped program from CPU hogging
 * Changed the way time online is calculated (used to miss time under heavy
   cpu load - hopefully this is rectified). This seems to have sorted out the
   strange 'prefs' bug too.  Bonus!!!
 * Theoretically sorted out VAT. VAT should be added to displayed cost and
   logged cost
 * Finally sorted out the Prefs save/load feature.  Doesn't cause a guru
   anymore :)
 + Added a little popup information window - needs a bit of a cosmetic
   overhaul though

 Pre 2/2/97
   Too many changes to list!!

 - I've had a report that NetStat quits with bizarre errors at odd times. 
   I'm afraid this is beyond me at the moment as I am unable to replicate 
   the errors.  I'm working on it though.
 - Apart from being slow to the point of inaccuracy, Netstat dies horribly 
   on my A500 (KS2.04) when opening the prefs screen.  I may look into 
   this if I get any requests!
 - Valid time band checking in the prefs is @{b}still@{ub} a bit ropey.  But if you
   don't enter valid time bands then I guess it's your fault anyway, I mean,
   why screw things up on purpose?

 To all the wonderful helpful people on the Blitz Basic mailing list, 
 without whom this project would be a complete mess and would never have 
 been remotely finished.
 
 And Bablos (bablos@enterprise.net) who's almost been a Beta tester for me,
 and has provided a fair few suggestions!
 
 And Yff (mtibor@elender.hu) for the cool icons.
 
 And to everyone that's written to me with encouraging words!

@node "update" "Updating your prefs"
 @{b}Updating from versions 1.75 to 1.83@{ub}
 
 There's not a lot to do really, however the prefs file has changed again. 
 You can either therefore redo all your prefs from the defaults, or try 
 the little program I've included in this archive.  In the main directory 
 should be a program called 'PrefConv' or something like that.  Just run 
 this from CLI and follow the instructions.
 
 Actually there aren't really any instructions, but all you have to do is 
 select your old prefs file, your log file and then a new prefs file from 
 the three requesters.  Your old prefs file will be copied with a ".bak" 
 extension.
 
 Pretty easy really!

@node "Source" "Source Code Notice"
Regarding the source code...

I've decided to release the source code to Netstat as I no longer have the
time to work on it.  I thought about doing Netstat 2 using my new found C++
skills, however I don't seem to have gotten round to it.  Who knows, it  may
happen yet.

Anyway, this source is released into the public domain with the conditions
that no money is ever made from it.  I released Netstat as freeware, and I
expect any updates if there ever are any to be free too.  Also, I retain  the
copyright to Netstat and any updates should include the notice that it  is
based on my code.

Included in the source distribution:

Netstat 1.8.4 (I worked on 1.8.5 but it's a mess and bits don't work.)
NetAnalyser 1.4 beta 2 - A couple of fixes needed, but hey... NetSpeak 1.1 -
There was only ever one version, does anyone ever actually 
     use this.  It was a quick hack anyway!

This .guide file and probably a readme too :)

I apologise for the state of the code, I never have been one for comments  in
code.  If there is anything in the code that you are unsure of then  feel free
to get in touch with me and I'll try to help out!!
