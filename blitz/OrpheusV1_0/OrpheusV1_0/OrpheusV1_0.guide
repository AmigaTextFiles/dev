ORPHEUS V1.01



Welcome to Orpheus, a programmers tool allowing the creation of AGA
gradient copper effects, for use within the user's BlitzBasic program.

This guide has details on all the features of Orpheus, and is divided
into the following sections:

@NODE Page_1 "Basic usage of Orpheus"

TOP AND BOTTOM COLOURS:

Each copper effect has a 'TOP' and a 'BOTTOM' value, which can be
altered by clicking on a colour on the colour palette, or by entering
the RGB values directly. Orpheus will then blend between the 2 chosen
colours, showing you an example of the copper effect.



PALETTE:

The colour palette can be altered using the following methods:



1>  Selecting one of the 4 default palettes, labelled as follows;

    -              .               ..                ...

2>  By RMB clicking on any colour in the palette - this will give you
    a range of colours from white, to the colour that was selected.

3>  Holding SHIFT and RMB clicking will perform the same function, except
    the range will begin with black.



SAVING:

Once the desired effect has been achieved, this can be saved as
Blitz Basic source code for use within your program, or to be loaded
back into Orpheus at a later date.

Source code is saved as ASCII and should merged into your program at
the relevant place (i.e. after creating the COPLIST display and before
entering BLITZ mode.)

Load "ExampleCopper.bb2" in Blitz Basic, which explains how to include
the source code generated by Orpheus in your program.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:

T     >       Select TOP of copper
B     >       Select BOTTOM of copper
+     >       Increase brightness of copper
-     >       Decrease brightness of copper
U     >       Undo last action to affect copper
R     >       Redo last undo

(All the above actions also have gadgets)

RANDOMIZE     Will select a random colour for the currently
              selected attribute (TOP or BOTTOM).

SWAP          Will exchange colour values between TOP and
              BOTTOM.

RGB VALUES    Allows you to view, or alter the RGB values
              of both TOP and BOTTOM attributes.

START <Y>     This is the horizontal scanline where the
              copper effect will begin. (Y axis)
