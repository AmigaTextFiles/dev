    Whoever heard of second time lucky? Never mind. It's here at last
  scarred but still smiling. A versatile and friendly blitz zone editor.

@NODE INTRO "What's a zone editor?"
  @{FG SHINE}@{U}@{B}What the Hell's a Zone Editor?@{UB}@{UU}@{FG TEXT}
    If you've never used zones in @{B}Blitz Basic@{UB}, you'll probably be at a
  loss as to what this does. If you do use them however, you'll know how
  much effort is involved in setting thier limits.
    Zones are essentially a method of marking out and numbering
  areas on screen. Although not very flexible it is @{B}very fast@{UB}, and
  often very useful.
    This program lets you define both rectangular and circular zones
  using a full amiga GUI, saving them to a @{B}simple text file@{UB}.
    
    What this means is, that your own programs can use a simple bit of    
  @{"code" LINK LOAD} to load the text file, and use the data to define the zones.
    Once that simple task is done, any future changes to your zones are
  @{B}simple@{UB}. Just load the editor, redefine the zones and save them again.
          
    And what makes things easier is the lovely @{"features" LINK FEATURES}.
@ENDNODE

@NODE REQUIREMENTS "Can I run this thing?"
  @{FG SHINE}@{U}@{B}Requirements?@{UB}@{UU}@{FG TEXT}

    To be honest I've no idea what other systems it runs under, because I
  know no-one else who owns an Amiga.

    I know in theory what it @{i}should @{ui} run under.

  @{fg highlight}Operating Systems@{fg text}
    @{B}OS 3.0@{UB} or above is required for the Intuition the program uses.

  @{fg highlight}Memory@{fg text}
    @{B}2MB Chip RAM@{UB} is plenty for most zone editing. Of course it
  doesn't hurt to have a wad of Fast RAM, but at a push I think this could
  run with just 512KB of Chip RAM.

  @{fg highlight}Processor@{fg text}
    It's a very stable program, but not blindingly fast, as is the way
  of all intuition based programs. Vanilla A1200 users will find this
  sluggish so any processor lower than an 68030 requires patience.
    Works fine and dandy on my '040/40mhz though.

    If it works under a system I haven't mentioned here, or indeed
  if you find any bugs, please write and tell @{"me" LINK ME} about it.

@NODE INSTALL "How do I Install this?"
  @{fg highlight}@{B}@{U}Installation@{UU}@{UB}@{fg text}

  Just drag the ZoneED drawer to wherever you want on your harddisk.
    If you want it to run from floppy then format a disk with an
  install bootblock and expand this archive straight into the root of DF0:

  Make sure you install the following libraries, in @{B}LIBS:@{UB}
   @{FG FILL} asl.library
    diskfont.library
    mathtrans.library
    reqtools.library@{FG TEXT}

    These are fairly common, and you should probably own them already.

  After that, you are ready to run.

    To run the ZoneED Either:-

    @{I}* Double click on the Workbench Icon
    * Go the the appropriate CLI drawer and type ZoneED@{UI}

@ENDNODE

@NODE FEATURES "Why's this any good?"
  @{FG SHINE}@{B}@{U}Features...@{UU}@{UB}@{FG TEXT}
    * Everything is Intuition friendly, with Gadtools, ASL and Menus.
    * IFF background can be loaded to help when defining zones
    * Menu's mean novices can get quickly to grips with the ZoneED.
    * Easy definition of zones by mouse dragging.
    * Keyboard shortcuts are included for experienced users.
    * Undo function.
    * Quick and versitile zone selection.
    * Saves your last working directories, allowing to quickly re-access
        the last files you were working on.

@NODE ZNE "The .ZNE file format"
  @{FG SHINE}@{U}@{B}Using the .ZNE format@{UB}@{UU}@{FG TEXT}
    The standard .ZNE format is a fairly simple text file to declare
  details of the file.
    You can use this description to write the @{"code" LINK LOAD} you need to
  load the map data into you're programs.
    Here is a line by line summary of the .ZNE format.

  @{B}* The file begins with a remark declaring the file to be ZoneED file.@{UB}
  @{B}* A remark naming the date created.@{UB}
  @{B}* A remark naming the file and what it's for.@{UB}
  @{B}* A remark naming the game/utility it's intended for.@{UB}
  @{B}* A remark declaring the author of the zone file.@{UB}
  @{FG FILL}If a background is used to define zones...@{FG TEXT}
    @{B}* the IFF background's full AmigaDOS filename@{UB}
    Finally follows the @{I}zne data.@{UI} It's simply a list of a zone number,
  a starting X co-ord and a Y co-ord and an ending X co-ord and a Y co-ord.

    If a negative number is found this means that it's referring to a new
  zonetable. Blitz has 15 zonetables, each of up to 65550+ zones. Make the
  negative a postive to define which zonetable to use. All the data that 
  follows is intended for that zonetable.
    This means -1 is the first number encountered in the zne file.
  (i.e. Zonetable 1)  

    Rather than waffling on here is an @{"example" LINK XAMPLE} of a zne file.

@NODE DISCLAIM "Covering my ass..."
  @{fg highlight}@{B}@{U}Legal Disclaimer@{UU}@{UB}@{fg text}

  To the best of my knowledge, ZoneED is completely OS friendly
and creates perfectly useable zone data, so there should be absolutely
no danger to your Amiga.

  If, however as a result of using ZoneED your Amiga should become
host to a @{I}Candarian Demon@{UI} who taunts you with voices urging you to @{FG FILL}@{B}kill@{UB}@{FG TEXT}
your friends and family I accept no responsibility for this, or anything
else that goes wrong as a result of using this software.

  But of course, everything will be fine. Good Luck and I hope you find
this program at least half as useful as I do.
