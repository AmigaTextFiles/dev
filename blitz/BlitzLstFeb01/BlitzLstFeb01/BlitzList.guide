                          Blitz Mailing List Guide
                          ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

Subject: @{b}@{ub}

I`ve been steadily plodding through the EFMUI lib, and got to the point
where I needed some gfx in a button.
According to the docs, you just specify the object number, and a shape
number.Trouble is, the gfx come out all trashed..well, more like a corrupt
palette.
The same shape file (std blitz shape) displays fine in my program if I
display it using the muishape object, so I know it`s not a corrupt file..
Any ideas guys?

Hello,
For some reason if I do:

    Bitmap 0,320,256,2
    Screen 0,0,0,320,256,2,0,"",1,0,0
It makes blitz crash
But if I change the depth to something like 7 or 8 it works
Does anyone knows what's wrong?

Kind regards

Paul

Strange, I just tried it on UAE and it seemed to work OK.

When does it crash, *exactly*.

On the Screen command
it normally crashs or locks

OK, just tried it. Works fine. Have you updated your libs or done anything
which may have corrupted your Blitz environment?

Yeah, I've heard of that, but I haven't used it myself. Try backing up  your
libs, and re-installing the originals then re-compile to see if that helps.
If it does, then your libraries have become corrupted.

I tried using the original acidlibs & deflibs files but it still crash
I've also tried turn off most the patches but it still doesn't work :-(
it seem like it doesn't crash if the depth is higher than 2.

OK then, my last ditch attempt to help. Go to http://www.blitz-2000.co.uk.
There are various updates etc. to fix some bugs in the original acidlibs
(not to mention a bunch of other stuff) available for D/L which may fix you
problem. I used to get some odd crashes with Blitz until I went there and
started D/L myself. Failing that, Dave McMinn has the original Blitz source
so he may be able to help further.

No, I don't. I want it though :)

I only have some sources, a few of the Acid libs, the RWE libs and the
debugger (oh, and I'm missing some updated Acid libs for compiling this,
if anyone can help), all of which is on the site, and all of which has previously
been available on other websites and FTP sites.

But I tried the crashing screen command things, and I'm stumped. It works
fine here and on UAE.

Dave, I seemed to reach a dead end on this subject, but you might want to
try asking Mark and Simon yourself. Mark was very keen to have the sources
released, Simon was up for it only really for an individual who had
something specific to fix or add...but it would probably be worth trying,
especially if you show out Blitz2000 (I did before, but so they know you're
serious)...

Can't help there, you are better off getting a scandoubler. Tho' I'm
surprised that it's MagicTV to blame. I thought that just played with the
pallette a little to reduce contrast (and therefore flicker), or am I
mistaken :o/

It's the only one I know of that does what it does ;)

Subject: @{b}Can some people test this please@{ub}

Hi,

Could people test a small exe for me please? I have checked it with Virus 
Checker II and it's clean. If anyone wants the source I can mail it to you 
(Blitz 2) to make sure there ain't no bad things in it >)
Obviously if you don't trust me, don't run it, or check it yourself.

You can find it at http://members.nbci.com/david_mcminn/devol or you can mail 
me and I'll send it privately. It's only about 9k.

Run it from a CLI using: devol <volume name>. It should show you the device for 
that volume. Could you try it mainly on CD, floppy, zip, etc drives as someone 
has said it doesn't work, but it works all the time for me. Oh, and could you 
mention what CDFS you use. Report to me privately unless you want to 
artificially increase list traffic ;)

Thanks in advance.

Hi David,

could you send the blitz source, instead of the exe. As 
the debugger will help in finding where the problem is 
(if there is one).
You can send it to me directly.

Thanks.

What's probably happened is that the NBCi server has checked the file for what 
type it is, couldn't figure it out and resorted to the default text/plain MIME 
type. It then tells the browser what type it is, and I guess IE must add the 
default extension of .txt when the file has no extension of it's own.

Thanks for telling me tho James. And cheers for testing it on WinUAE, IIRC 
you're running a newer version than me. The one I have treats the PC CD drive 
as a HDD.

Yeah, err, oops :)

But then I did say that to use it you run it from a CLI. It's a simple test of 
paying attention, not a programming error. Honest.

Subject: @{b}Debugger causing slowdown@{ub}

Hi all,

Some of you might notice a slowdown of your system when using the Blitz 
debugger and a graphics card (or UAE, happens to me in window mode).

This is due to some combinations of graphics subsystem and card, as not all 
support hardware interrupts on vertical blanks. Consequently, WaitTOF_ isn't 
always a good solution to use on graphics cards. Unfortunately, the REDDebugger 
uses this to cause a delay in it's main loop. I've disassembled it (oops :) and 
changed this to Delay_(3), which helps a lot.

Anyone who wants it, go to http://members.nbci.com/david_mcminn/blitz2.html 
(near the bottom of the page) and read the readme for full instructions.

You use the same commands as normal menus - MenuHit, ItemHit etc.
There was a program for creating locales called Olga I think, but I could
never get it to work. There is a link to the webpage for it on the

Attached is a piece of test code - it works fine with me (I can send you the

If there is fastmem available on your computer, AmigaDOS will load the program 
into fastmem - so all the data will be in fastmem also.

This is because Blitz creates executables with a single ADOS hunk in it, and 
AFAIK it never sets the bit for specifying this hunk must be loaded into 
chipmem.

On a more general point, there is no way to control the hunk memory types in 
Blitz (and there is only ever 1 hunk anyway, although I think you can add a 
debug hunk to it) like you can in some C compilers with things like __chip etc.

aehm, but only if section is set to fast mem! Gfx and snd section must be
set to chip!

Yes, i know! BB supports only one kunk (chip) for code,gfx,snd! What about
the idea to copy my incbin stuff to fastmem and after copying, free the
reserved section for my incbin? If the files will be extern, there may be
some ways to put the stuff into fast on bb2...

I am not sure, but when i include asm-compiled-obj-files to be linked in my
programm, it must be possible to set in asm source the section of mem for
my asm replacement or routine... BB dont know it, but my obj file know it..

But with Blitz it all gets put together, and this will get loaded into fast if 
there is enough available. You can't specify section types with Blitz.

> Yes, i know! BB supports only one kunk (chip) for code,gfx,snd! What about

Blitz doesn't specify the hunk in the executable to be chip. This is why if you 
incbin some gfx or sound, you need to use Decodexxxx to put it into a Blitz 
object, in the correct memory type.

That would probably be the best idea, if it is feasible.

Does this work properly with Blitz? I've never tried it, so I don't know. But 
it would be interesting to know if it works.

(!) Ahh... thanks for the very helpfull info, that bb2 will put together all
into fast if available... i will check and experiement with it...

(?) What, when i never use DecodeShapes for example, because i save my gfx
in a special own format, and bb2 will put my gfx (incbin) into fastmem?
When using commands like "Bitmap", bb2 will put this Object automatic into
ChipMem and so i can read my gfx data from FastMem to draw/put it into
ChipMem, or? I do this methode at the moment and it works very fine! ;)
[I am not sure, if the gfx(incbin) will be in Chip or Fast, when it works] 

> Blitz doesn't specify the hunk in the executable to be chip. This is why

(!) Aha, it isnt a ChipHunk? Ok, the idea behind "DecodeXXX" to put the 
data into ChipMem is easy to understand...

(?) What is, when i use a HunkEditor to change the hunk of the BB2 compiled
pogramm and set it to Fast/Public or what ever? It must have any change to
the memory, the program will put in, or? Nice idea, i will try it... 

> That would probably be the best idea, if it is feasible.

(!) If you use extern files it is not such a problem to load the stuff 
into any memory! I dont like one exefile and 1000 of extern files! When, i
would like to put all files into one+ big datafile, it looks much better!
I dont want use a datafile for my program, because it is very small and
it doesnt looks nice, when a progamm (code+gfx+snd+++) have at least about
200-300 KB! So why i should use a extern datafile? ;)

> Does this work properly with Blitz? I've never tried it, so I don't know.
> But it would be interesting to know if it works.

I tried it yesterday and it cant work, because "sections" in asm are no
commands like "rts, move..."! Else it would be possible to write "dc.l
$4E714E75" (NOP,RTS) or what ever and BB2 will check it... Sections will
only set the HunkHeader of a progamm... If someone have the full source
of BB2-Compiler, it should be no big problem to modify the compiler for
future versions to set the memorytype... Does someone have the souce? ;)

many thanks!

I've just bought a GVP A2060 68060/50 board.   This has SCSI on 
board.    This is the NEW system.

I also have two SCSI Hard Drives.  One is a 540 Meg Quantum with 
4 FFS partitions.  the other is a 4.3 GIG IBM with 4 PFS2 
partitions.     This used to be perfect.  All worked well.

Witjhe the new system, the early-boot screen didn't recognise the 
IBM/PFS drive.   HDToolBox did find it, so I assumed that this was 
a problem with PFS2.   I created a FFS partition on it and this was 
recognised, so the PFS disgnosis seemed confirmed.

Much swapping of boards occurred (I can install these things in the 
dark by now!!).   Every time the old system worked OK but the new 
one only recognised FFS partitions.

Now comes the major problem.   I used ExpertPrep, the GVP 
equivalent of HDToolBox, and that said that the PFS partitions 
were not automaount.    Ah ha, I thought, set them to automount 
and all will be well.   Ooops.   Now the new system behaves as 
before - eraly boot doesn't recognise the PFS partitions, but 
HDToolBox does.   The old system - NOTHING recognises the 
HDD at all.   I am stuffed, this is my live Motel data.   I do have 
backups,  but two months old because the machine lost a memory 
board and I couldn't run the CD writing software.

Any ideas would be really appreciated

Regards

Tony

Wild guess says you need some other SCSI controller started at the
beginning, or another SCSI .device/library installed...? Presumably the
Oktagon controller won't have a clue what the new SCSI controller is...

The gvpscsi2.device boards ( most G-Forces) are limited in their
controllers. They will only allocate 32K of memory for the filesystems, and
as PFS2/3, SFS, AFS etc are all larger than that, their isn't enough memory
to start the filesystem. Basically, you cannot run any modern filesystems on
these boards. I think the Guru ROM cured this on the early boards, but the
G-Force doesn't have the same type of ROM. Tough shit :)

Chances are you're f*cked. NEVER NEVER use ExpertPrep, it has some
non-standard RDB 'features' that other HD tools don't/won't like/recognise.

Could you perhaps time it based on serial interrupts? <--- Wild guess here.

Nope, a vertical interrupt depends on what the screenmode of the current screen 
is. And you need to watch out, since not all GFX card/driver/RTG system 
combinations support vertical interrupts.

For example, the Mediator Voodoo drivers only just got that functionality with 
the latest release, and I think UAE suffers from that problem too. I don't know 
about any other GFX cards though.

Without the vertical interrupt, I think they either never occur, or (if you are 
waiting for one), it does a busy-wait loop polling for when the interrupt would 
occur. This is why I posted about a patched REDDebugger - that was the problem 
of it slowing down the system.



What you could do if you are really really wanting to do this in a nice system 
friendly way (which also means a lot of work and heartache when you find out 
Blitz sucks for doing this :) is to set up a separate task for controlling the 
timing and serial port. Then use timer.device for timing the interrupts and 
serial.device for sending the stuff. Don't ask for an example from me, I don't 
have any :)

Hi, I was wondering if anyone has a solution to the following problems..
1. In using a multi-column Nlist, how do you set the titlebar contents..
(I`ve tried the various nlist-examples that have been posted, and   they
all crash the amiga on exiting the program)

2. Is it possible to have an invisible column?
I read in the docs about the #MUIA_NList_Format tag and the use of setting
a maximum width using MAW=0, but the column still shows up.

Hello Ben

You've got several ways to achieve that.
First is to open the "PAR:" device.
But if you want to write to a printer, you'd better use

If WriteFile(2,"PRT:")      ; open printer
  FileOutput 2                   ; Use the file PRT when using commands Print, NPrint
  ... There you print 
  DefaultOutput                ;  Don't use PRT anymore
  CloseFile                         ; Close printer
 Endif

You really should close the file first, then redirect the output back to

A few options would be:

1) Get the STRPortLib (Aminet/B2k)
2) Hit the hardware using pokes/peeks/pointers/assembly (same as above really, 
but not as easy)
3) Use the files as Jean-Marc said
4) Do it the OS way - open up parallel.device and send IORequests and things

I think the best would be to open parallel.device and then use assembler
or pokeing for control (well if the parallel opened).

Hi all,  

There was some problems with the server that the list was on, but the sysadmin 
guy says it should be fixed now. Anyway, on with the Blitz...

What's the best way to combine passing lists to functions with the bbgtlib 
(yes, I should know, but I don't :).  

I'm trying to do something like this:  

Function.l CreateGadgets{a,b}
    GTListview ,,,,b()
    ....
End Function  

CreateGadgets{1,blah()}  

If I can't do that, I know I can get the list pointer using some basic (but 
only if there is an item in the list) - is there already a command for doing 
this though (I'd prefer to use a function or command so I don't need to use any 
other global variables).  

Thanks.

Hi all,

  I'm trying to sort an array of newtypes, and I've got the feeling it's
not going to work. :)  I'm taking the address of the first item in the
array and assuming that the array is just a block of memory that's
(newtype size * number of items) bytes long.  Does anyone know what the
internal structure of a newtype array is like?  I'm wondering if I might
have to account for a previous item and next item pointer that Blitz uses
as well as the actual data in my newtype.  
If anyone has another way of sorting an array like this by one of the
members of the newtype, I'd be interested in hearing about it!

Thanks in advance,

Yep, it's just a block of memory, but the size of the newtype is rounded
up to the nearest even number of bytes.

So if you have:

    NEWTYPE.blah
      a.w
      b.s
    END NEWTYPE

    Dim blah2.blah(10)

You can do:

    *ptr.blah = &blah2(0)
    ; Process some stuff
    *ptr = *ptr + ((Sizeof.blah + 1) AND $FFFFFFFE)

> have to account for a previous item and next item pointer that Blitz

Only if you are using a Blitz List array. In which case you would treat it
like a list and not a block of memory.

> of sorting an array like this by one of the members of the newtype, I'd
> be interested in hearing about it!

You're probably doing it right, although pointers can lead to extra pain
when doing sort routines. If it is just a normal array, couldn't you just
keep it as an array and access it like that? Then when you need to, just
copy the fields between items during the sort.

Hmmm. How are you Dimming your array. If you are using Dim List then you're
out of luck, 'cos all of the pointers are kept internally.

If, however, you are just using a normal Dim for the array, then you could
write a procedure that will, for example, bubble sort the array elements.
Then you don't need to worry about address in memory of the array, just how
many elements it contains.

All the best

Silly question, probably...   but why don't you use the Sort or
SortList commands?    They should do what you want.

As Tony says, you should use the Sort or SortList 
commands.
You just need to add a dummy .w in first position of your 
newtype, to make it work.

NewType .MyNewType
DummySort.w
...
End Newtype

Well, if you don't/can't/won't use some of the pre-existing commands, as Tony 
suggested, you can do this to get pointers to list items:

; Fill in list here
If FirstItem(listname())
    *ln.Node = &listname() - 8
    *lst.List = *ln\ln_Pred
Else
    *lst.List = 0
End If

And now you can do anything you want really, using normal list things. Check 
what the value of *lst is though, because if it's zero, there are no items so 
you wouldn't bother sorting.

Oh, and rather than use the bubble sort, don't swap at every opportunity. Find 
the highest and lowest and then swap them at the end of the iteration. Then, 
search in the remaining unsorted items. Francis Loch told me about that, very 
useful (faster).

I made a asl screenrequest thing which`ll accept no less than 640-400 or
better =)

I`m now stuck with wanting to access serial within a vertical interrupt. I
don`t want any notes dropping when you move a window(which happens if the
serial access is NOT in the interup routine). Timing is critical(I`m making a
midi app if anyone wondered) and if that isn`t working well then nothing will.

Also am I right into thinking that a vertical interrupt is only
dependant(considering the frequency) on the fact if the system is NTSC or PAL.
So a gfx card won`t change that. Converting from pal to ntsc time I already
built in.

Best would be to use CIA timers, because they can be set to any rate you
want.
In the case of blitz it would most likely require HW banging or at least
some
OS + ASM. But on the other hand if you are planning to use serial from
VBI then
you will need to HW bang the serial anyway.

If you want to HW bang the serial, then find HW reference guide
somewhere, it should
have an example how to do it. It is quite easy to do if you know a litle
of asm,
and can be made even without any asm knowledge using pokes and peeks. (I
though
recommend to learn that litle bit of asm skill, that is needed for the
task)

  I have written the code for accessing the CIAs in blitz:
Aminet dev/basic/CIAs_in_Blitz.lha†
   Unfortunately, like the system timers, they vary a bit under system
load too, so VBL, is the only way to go for rock steady timers.
  Problem is, you can test wether the machine is in NTSC or PAL, but it
can be switched from NTSC to PAL and vice-versa, by an app opening a
screen, and I haven't been able to test what screen rate the system is
running at :/

@NODE "mail_66" " Trouble with sequential files "
From: Daniel Dundelski <ditud@...>
Date: 02-03-01 22:08:01
Subject: @{b}Trouble with sequential files@{ub}

Hello,

My programm use random acess file to get informations from
them. But I have nasty problem. I made a random acces file
by this procedure :

MaxLen NAZWISKO$=20
MaxLen UR$=10
MaxLen NICK$=10
MaxLen ULICA$=25
MaxLen MIASTO$=20
MaxLen KOD$=10
MaxLen EMAIL$=25
MaxLen TEL$=15

For x=0 To 99

If OpenFile (0,"Data/Dane.dat")
Fields
0,STAN.b,NAZWISKO$,UR$,NICK$,ULICA$,MIASTO$,KOD$,EMAIL$,TEL$
Put 0,x
CloseFile 0
End If

And then in my main prog I try to get to fields (at the
beginning of programm) by this procedure :

NEWTYPE.Osobnik
Stan.b
Nazwisko.s
Ur.s
Nick.s
Ulica.s
Miasto.s
Kod.s
Email.s
Tel.s
End NEWTYPE

Dim POSTAC.Osobnik(100)

DEFTYPE.b STAN

MaxLen NAZWISKO$=25
MaxLen UR$=10
MaxLen NICK$=10
MaxLen ULICA$=25
MaxLen MIASTO$=20
MaxLen KOD$=10
MaxLen EMAIL$=25
MaxLen TEL$=15

x=0

If ReadFile (0,"Data/Dane.dat")
Fields
0,STAN.b,NAZWISKO$,UR$,NICK$,ULICA$,MIASTO$,KOD$,EMAIL$,TEL$
Repeat
Get 0,x
USEPATH POSTAC(x)
\Stan=STAN
\Nazwisko=NAZWISKO$
\Ur=UR$
\Nick=NICK$
\Ulica=ULICA$
\Miasto=MIASTO$
\Kod=KOD$
\Email=EMAIL$
\Tel=TEL$
x=x+1
Until x=100
CloseFile 0
End If

The problem is that when Get command is executed something
goes wrong and when I'm exiting form prog I get GURU
(Unable to free mem). Does someone had that kind of
problems with fields,put,get commands? HELP!

Kind Redgards

This is your problem.   You do not raed files with a newtype in this
manner.   Simply do a Get filenumber, recordnumber and that will fill
in all the fields for you.   If you look at the file with a hex
editor, you will find that the fields are stored in reverse order for
each record.   FIELDS a.l,b.l,c.l will store c first, then b then a.  
Also strings have a 6-byte overhead (4 byte length at the front and 2
byte pad at the back).

All you need to do to create a new record is to fill the fields and
Put filenumber, recordnumber  where recordnumber is not greater than
the current number of records.    Remeber that the first record is
record zero.

You CAN use NewTypes, but that involves using fileseek and ReadMem \
WriteMem commands.   Also strings have to be inserted with
poke,s and extracted with peek.s

If you need any more help, let me know.  I've done a lot of stuff with
random access files.

Cheers

Does anyone know a way to write to serial WITHIN a vertical interrupt. The
Blitz writeserial causes a crash(cause writeserial uses an interrupt too I
assume).
