@Node _WHATIS. "What is that BlitzGUIGen thing?"

      @{b}BlitzGUIGen@{ub} is the program you've been looking for all this time!.

    If, like me, you're a serious user of Blitz Basic 2 and you do a lot
    of Intuition programming, then, up till now, you've been doing it the
    hard way. I have spent many hours programming Graphic User Interfaces
    manually, compiling the source, moving gadgets one pixel left,
    re-compiling, moving, re-compiling. Get the message!

    Now I do it the easy way, BlitzGUIGen!

    If you've ever used GadToolsBox, you'll know how easy it can be to
    generate professional looking front ends for your programs. To be
    fair, @{" IntuTools " Link IntuToolsCopy} does try to come to some sort of a compromise, but
    just doesn't make it into the 'big league'.
    Having noticed that GadToolsBox generates source for you, I needed
    to do something that will generate source for me in Blitz Basic.
    That's where BlitzGUIGen comes into its own. Everything that is
    supported in GadToolsBox and Blitz Basic has been included,
    even nm_BarLabel menu separators (using the RIGTMenusLib.obj).
    See the @{" Overview " Link _OVERVIEW.} section for details on using BlitzGUIGen.



@Endnode

@Node _REQUIREMENTS. "What requirements do I need?"

            I suppose the main requirement for BlitzGUIGen to be of any
    use to you, is Blitz Basic 2. You will require at least version 1.9
    as this is the version I am currently using and some updated
    commands included in version 1.9 are used. Versions less than 1.9
    may still be used with BlitzGUIGen but some source may be incomplete.

            Secondly, you will need Version 2.0 of GadToolsBox. Lesser
    versions of GadToolsBox will not work with BlitzGUIGen, as files are
    checked for GadToolsBox version number before being converted. Later
    versions may be supported in the future once I upgrade my GadToolsBox
    version.

            You will also need the @{" Decrunch " Link _POWERCOPY} executable that
    accompanies the PowerPacker distribution, if you want to access any
    crunched .gui files made with GadToolsBox.

    Of course, it should go without saying, that GadTools gadgets are only
    available in Kickstarts 2.x and higher. You will need to have at least
    KS2.x up in order to use this software.

    You will also need a copy of Reqtools.library in you're Libs: assign.

    Once these requirements are met, then you are equipped to use BlitzGUIGen.

    One thing that you must make sure is that the directory 'Blitz2' is
    assigned to 'Blitz2:', otherwise BlitzGUIGen will not be able to
    launch Blitz Basic's editor to load in source.

    That's about it for 'what do I need'. See the @{" Overview " Link _OVERVIEW.} section
    for details on using BlitzGUIGen.

@Endnode

@Node _Overview. "An overview on using BlitzGUIGen"

    BlitzGUIGen is extremely easy to use, and has been designed to be
    as simple as possible to operate. A few subjects may need to be
    covered and are explained below:-


    @{b}Installation@{ub}

    If you wanted to do this the easy way, then you could use the
    installation software included in this archive. Alternatively,
    you can install it by hand if you don't trust me!. 
    Start by selecting somewhere to put the software, or create a new
    drawer for it. 
    Next, copy the executable file BlitzGUIGen, and its icon
    BlitzGUIGen.info into your selected destination.

    I have a sub-drawer where I keep all my GUI files called 'GUI-Gen',
    something similar would be a good way of keeping things tidy.

    Should you need it, the 'Decrunch' executable should be placed
    into your C: assign.

    @{b}Set Up@{ub}

    Now you have the option to set up the tooltypes for BlitzGUIGen.
    I would suggest reading the @{" Using ToolTypes " Link tooltypes} section for more
    information and descriptions on achieving this.


    @{b}Installing Key File@{ub}

    Once you have registered your copy, you will receive a @{i}Key File@{ui},
    which should be installed in the same directory as BlitzGUIGen itself.
    The @{i}Key File@{ui} will now unlock your version, and will enable
    the following functions:

        Personalize your copy by showing your name and number in title
        Personalize your copy by showing your details in 'About' requester
        Enable the keyboard shortcuts
        Enable the 'Load New Blitz' button
        Enable the use of @{i}crunched@{ui} gui's
        Remove the automatic 'About' requester on open and close
        Put your name and number in source
        Enable the generation of custom screens
        Enable the creation of menu lists
        Enable the creation of .xtra file
        Enable the use of MAKETOGGLE tooltype
        Enable the use of ACTIVATESTRING tooltype
        Enable the use of FUNCTIONS tooltype

    @{b}Executing@{ub}

    Firstly, after loading up the program by double-clicking its icon,
    or entering BlitzGUIGen (params) from the command line of the CLI,
    you will be presented with a simple GUI. 
    For information on CLI parameters, refer to the section
    @{" Parameter passing from the CLI " Link cliparams} for details of these,
    or @{" Using ToolTypes " Link tooltypes} for info on these.
    (By the way, this GUI was created with BlitzGUIGen and GadToolsBox!).
    If you need to alter any program parameters, you should do so now,
    before converting any .gui files.

    The set of four checkboxes at the top left side of the window are
    to allow you over-ride the default settings.
 
    Starting from the top, is the 'Make Screen Data' gadget. 
    This will allow you to decide, at this point, whether or not to 
    create screen data within your source.
    If this is not selected, then the source will not compile straight
    away from the Blitz 2 editor, but is intended, instead, to be used
    as an include to create your designed GUI.

    Next, working down, is the 'Make Menu Data' gadget. This, being
    similar to the above, will, if you have created menus, allow you to
    create them within your Blitz source.

    The 'Make Source Use WB Screen' gadget comes next, and this will
    force your source to use the Workbench screen as the default screen
    that your window will appear on. De-selecting this will use the front
    most screen instead.
    As of version 1.3 +, this selection will over-ride any screens that
    have been created from within @{i}GadToolsBox@{ui}, and force your window onto
    the Workbench screen.

    Lastly, is the 'Create Event Handler' gadget. This will create an IDCMP
    event handler for you to handle things like gadget hits and menu hits
    etc. The handy thing here, is that if you have made some meaningful
    labels for each of your gadgets, then these labels will be used in
    this loop, which makes it a lot easier to work out which ID number
    goes with which gadget.

    The default DetailPen and BlockPen can be altered from the string
    gadgets over on the top right side.
    Once these are as you want them, you are ready to continue.

    Conversion is a simple button press. The 'Select Source GUI...'
    button allows you to select a @{i}GadToolsBox@{ui} file from a file
    requester for conversion from the selected path. The file requester
    will only show .gui files, which is the format for conversion.

    Once the selected file has been parsed by BlitzGUIGen for correct
    version, the GUI will show what is happening. The software will
    tell you once the source has been created, and you can elect to
    either quit, using the quit gadget or the close gadget, or load
    a new Blitz editor screen with the source ready to view and/or
    compile.
    If the file already exists upon trying to save the source, you will
    be presented with a Save requester which will give you the opportunity
    to rename the saved source's name.


    @{b}Understanding created source@{ub}

    The created source should be straight forward enough to understand
    without too many complications. 
    BlitzGUIGen will define some variables in your source that may appear
    confusing to start with.
    
    First, let us assume you created a project in @{i}GadToolsBox@{ui} with
    the name 'MyGui'. This is the label you give to the project from the
    'Edit Data' item from the 'Window' menu of @{i}GadToolsBox@{ui}. This
    label will be used in creating your Blitz 2 source.
    
    Working from the top of the source, you will see the copyright message
    and version number created by BlitzGUIGen.
    
    Next, if you have elected to create screen code, will come the sub
    section of code that will define the screen. 
    Then a label 'InitialiseVars' will start a block of variable 
    declarations.
    MyGuiWnd = ???, will be the first variable you see. This variable
    will normally have a value of zero, but may be changed later.
    See the 'WINDOWLABEL=' tooltype for info on changing this value.
    This will be the number of your window in your source, which gadgets
    etc. will be attached to. 
    Next will be 'MyGuiGList = 0' which is the gadgetlist number in your 
    source. You can manually change this value in your source, or refer
    to the 'GLISTLABEL=' tooltype to change permantly.
    Lastly, 'MyGuiScr = 0' will be the number of your current screen. This,
    also could be changed manually, if desired, or permantly with the
    'SCREENLABEL=' tooltype.
    
    If you have created any menus, 'MyGuiMList = 0' will be next. This
    defines the number for the menulist. Again this can be changed manually
    later on, or permantly with the 'MENULABEL=' tooltype. Then a
    'Gosub xxxMenu' or 'xxxMenu{}' will follow which will jump to a
    subroutine in you're source which will define your menus.
    
    Next comes your list of gadgets, which are all standard Blitz commands,
    and are described in detail in the Reference Manual that comes with
    Blitz Basic 2. Some gadgets may have attached tags, using the @{b}GTTags@{ub}
    command. This will affect your gadget in a way not directly supported
    in Blitz 2.
    
    Your window is defined next, as again, a standard Blitz command.
    If gadgets have been defined then the 'AttachGTList xxx,yyy'
    command is next, to attach them to your window.
    
    Again, if you have created menus, then these will be attached next
    using the standard @{b}SetMenu@{ub} command.
    A @{b}RastPort@{ub} command may be next, depending on the presence
    of 'IntuiTexts', then, if present, will be rendered.
    
    The main event handler will be next, and this aims to make it as easy
    as possible to test your GUI. You may notice that the only way to
    exit from your GUI once compiled, is to hit gadget number 0, or
    to hit the close gadget, if you have one. At least this way, you will
    be able to test the action of the gadgets without exiting back to
    Blitz 2 straight away. 
    As of version 1.7, a break-out key (ESC) is included. This forms a fool
    proof method of making sure you can get back to TED.
    As mentioned elsewhere, meaningful gadget labels should be used from
    within @{b}GadToolsBox@{ub} as these are used from within the event 
    handler loop. This makes it easier to check for specific response to 
    a gadget rather than referring to only the ID number.
    A similar loop will follow that for the menu event handler, and then
    another similar one for keyboard shortcuts.

    Another subroutine will follow, which forms how you quit. Currently,
    it just quits, but you can expand on this to create custom exits,
    like quit requesters etc.
    
    If menus are present then these will be defined in the following
    subroutine, which, are again, all standard Blitz commands. One
    note here, is that BarLabel menu separators are not created here,
    even if they are present in the GUI file, because the standard
    Blitz menu commands do not, as far as I know, support this function.
    As of Version 1.6+, GadTools Menu's can be created via the library
    'RIGTMenuLib.obj, and as a result, now supports nm_BarLabel separators.

    One final note is that you may notice a small graphics routine right
    at the end of your source. This will be to create a 'GetFile' gadgets
    images, if they have been used. Although this is freely usable by you
    in your source, I wouldn't recommend altering any of the values in it,
    it could lead to unpredictable results, and you are advised to leave
    well alone. I will apologize for this rather 'messy' way of creating
    'GetFile' gadgets, but it seemed an easy way for the time being. Look
    at it as Blitz's way of implementing BOOPSI! ;0)

    As of version 1.7, the ability to create Statements rather than
    subroutines has been implemented, and if this has been selected, these
    routines will be first in the listing rather than after the main loop.
    The @{" FUNCTIONS " link tooltypes} tooltype outlines this further.


@Endnode

@Node _INDEPTH. "An In Depth look at BlitzGUIGen"

    This version of BlitzGUIGen will generate the following types of
    GUI components to V36 (2.04) standards:

    @{b}GetFile@{ub}     These are the gadgets that you may see in a GUI
                that includes choosing a disk path or volume. They are
                actually GTShape gadgets with a little bit of trickery
                involved.

    @{b}GTButton@{ub}    These are the buttons you see all over the place.
                A typical example is the buttons you see on system
                requesters. GadTools buttons allow you to underscore a
                certain character on the face of the gadget to act as .
                a keyboard shortcut

    @{b}GTCheckBox@{ub}  These enable the user to switch some item on or off.
                a small box appears that when clicked on, a small tick
                will show that it has been switched on.

    @{b}GTInteger@{ub}   These are similar to GTString gadgets but accept
                only whole number inputs instead of alpha characters.

    @{b}GTListView@{ub}  These are the gadgets you see that allow you to
                read or enter an amount of different items. A typical
                example here would be the selection of printer you want
                to use in the printer.prefs window.

    @{b}GTMX@{ub}        These are a set of radio buttons of which only
                one can be on at any one time (Mutually eXclusive). They
                allow the user to make a selection from a choice of a few.
                This is just a different way to display a GTCycle gadget.

    @{b}GTNumber@{ub}    This is a read only number gadget, which is used to
                inform the user of some numeric value.

    @{b}GTCycle@{ub}     These are the button gadgets you see that change
                their faces as you click on them. This allows for a selection
                to be made from the gadget.

    @{b}GTPalette@{ub}   This is the colour palette editing gadget that
                you see every where in preferences sections. Its use
                should be fairly obvious.

    @{b}GTScroller@{ub}  These allow the user to scroll through a list
                of items etc. Similar to the slider attached to a
                GTListView gadget.

    @{b}GTSlider@{ub}    This allows your user to set a level of some sort.
                Normally used for volume or intensity of colour etc.

    @{b}GTString@{ub}    These are gadgets that allow you to enter a string
                of characters into the machine. A typical application for
                these is in a database program to enter in details. The
                beauty of these is that an optional label can be assigned
                to the gadget, which can also be underscored.

    @{b}GTText@{ub}      These are similar to the GTString gadgets but are read
                only. You cannot enter text from here. A status display
                would be an ideal example for using these.

    @{b}Screen@{ub}      This will be the screen that your window will open on.
                This could be Public, Custom or even the Workbench screen.

    @{b}Window@{ub}      This one doesn't really need explaining, I hope. All your
                gadgets will be rendered into this window once it has been
                opened.

    @{b}Menus@{ub}       These also shouldn't require explaining. The menus
                that have been created will be attached the window once
                opened. nm_BarLabel menu separators are not supported by
                these 'standard' menus.

    @{b}GTMenus@{ub}     As of Version 1.6, you now have the option to create
                GadTools Menu's. This requires that your 'DefLibs' file
                contains the commands within the RIGTMenuLib.obj. This
                is included in the distribution, and you should refer
                to the 'Install_RIGTMenuLib.readme file. Thanks to
                Steve McNamara of Leading Edge Software for his great
                library.

    @{b}BevelBox@{ub}    These box's are actually borders, similar to the borders
                around button gadgets. They can be used to split up the
                window into certain parts, so that the gadget layout makes
                more sense to the user. The option to recess or dropbox
                these box's is very handy indeed.

    @{b}IntuiText@{ub}   This is text that is rendered into the window once
                it has been opened. Different colours are allowed and
                are supported by BlitzGUIGen.


    Please Note: Custom screens created by @{i}GadToolsBox@{ui} are currently
                not supported by BlitzGUIGen prior to version 1.3, and
                the structure is ignored.


@ENDNODE


@Node tooltypes "Using tooltypes from Workbench"

    So far the supported ToolTypes are:

    @{b}NOMAIN@{ub}
    This is a switch that allows you to turn off the generation of
    the main loop that handles IDCMP events. Please note that with
    this switch set, the code that is generated will not compile
    directly from the Blitz Basic 2 editor, and is now meant to be
    included as a sub-routine.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-e'.

    @{b}NOSCREEN@{ub}
    This switch allows you to turn off the generation of code that
    assigns a screen for your window to open on. Please note that
    with this switch set, the code that is generated will not
    compile directly from the Blitz Basic 2 editor, and is now
    meant to be included as a sub-routine.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-s'.

    @{b}PATH=@{ub}@{i} path@{ui}
    This tooltype will allow you to specify a path for BlitzGUIGen to
    look at when searching for .gui files. @{i}path@{ui} may be any
    legal AmigaDOS path:

    eg. sys:GUI/blitzgui

    When the filerequester opens, it will now be looking into this
    directory for .gui files. @{i}Path@{ui} will also affect the
    path to save source files to. If SAVEPATH= hasn't been defined
    but PATH= has, then source will be saved to the path contained
    in the string following PATH=.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-p'.

    @{b}SCREEN=@{ub}Workbench
    This will allow you to select which screen the source code will
    use once compiled. Leaving this tooltype out will default the
    source to finding the front most screen and using that. This
    option can also be set in the GUI, before you convert any .gui
    files.
    As of V1.3 the ommision of this tooltype will default your source
    to recreating the screen defined in the .gui file.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-w'.

    @{b}WINDOWLABEL=@{ub}@{i}String@{ui} ; new in 1.7
    I have included this really for myself, but somebody else may
    find it useful. Once you have created the source, your window
    will have the value contained in @{i}String@{ui}:
        i.e. WINDOWLABEL=MyWindow
    will have the effect of the source creating the line:
        Window MyWindow,0,0.............
    when you include this source into another program, your window
    will have the value MyWindow instead of 0. If you omit this
    tooltype then the source will give your window a value of zero.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-wl'.

    @{b}SCREENLABEL=@{ub}@{i}String@{ui} ; new in 1.7
    This tooltype will act very similar to WINDOWLABEL accept that
    it will substitute the screen number for the @{i}string@{ui}.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-sl'.

    @{b}GLISTLABEL=@{ub}@{i}String@{ui} ; new in 1.7
    This tooltype will act very similar to WINDOWLABEL accept that
    it will substitute the gadgetlist number for the @{i}string@{ui}.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-gl'.

    @{b}MENULABEL=@{ub}@{i}String@{ui} ; new in 1.7
    This tooltype will act very similar to WINDOWLABEL accept that
    it will substitute the menulist number for the @{i}string@{ui}.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-ml'.

    @{b}TOGGLEGAD@{ub} ; new in 1.7
    This tooltype will add some code to the event handler that will
    highlight the gadget selected by a keyboard shortcut as if it
    was clicked on with the mouse.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-t'.

    @{b}ACTIVATESTRING@{ub} ; new in 1.7
    This tooltype works very similar to the above one, but will
    place code into the keyboard reader so that presing the highlighted
    letter of a 'String' or 'Integer' gadget will automatically activate
    that gadget.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-a'.

    @{b}HIGHLIGHTLABEL@{ub} ; new in 1.7
    This tooltype will allow you to control how the program labels
    appear in the source. By default, the labels are not highlighted,
    but by using this tooltype will place a '.' in front of the labels
    used in the source so that they will appear in the right hand
    column of the Blitz editor.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-h'.

    @{b}DPEN=@{ub}@{i}0 to 16@{ui}
    This will change the default DetailPen colour for your source window.
    The number that follows the tooltype should be in the range that
    corresponds with the amount of colours you are currently using.
    The number is a palette reference not a 'DriPen' number. Colour
    zero usually being the background colour (usually grey), working
    up to the amount of colours in your current palette.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-d'.

    @{b}BPEN=@{ub}@{i}0 to 16@{ui}
    This is the same as the DPEN tooltype, with the exception that it
    sets the current BlockPen for your source window. See above for more
    details on palette colours.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-b'.

    @{b}EXTENSION=@{ub}@{i}String@{ui}
    This tooltype will allow you to change the default appended suffix.
    Normally, BlitzGUIGen will save source files with the extension of
    .BBGui, but the @{i}String@{ui} following EXTENSION= will change this.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-x'.

    @{b}SAVEPATH=@{ub}@{i}Path@{ui}
    This will now allow a different path to save the source files to. By
    default, source files are saved to the same directory that the .gui
    file was found in. By including a valid AmigaDOS path string after
    SAVEPATH= you can override this setting.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-v'.

    @{b}MAKEXTRA@{ub}
    This switch will allow your source to have an associated .xtra
    file. The main benefit of this is that when @{b}GTTags@{ub} are
    created for gadgets, the constant will be used instead of
    the actual hex value. In the 'Compiler Options' menu, you will
    see that 'Blitzlibs:Amigalibs.res' is already displayed in the
    window. Also, 'Make Smallest Code' and 'Runtime Debugger' will
    be switched on.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-X'.

    @{b}GTMENUS@{ub}
    This switch will allow you to create GadTools Menu's. This will need
    the DefLibs file to have been re-created with the RIGTMenuLib.obj
    file present in your userlibs drawer at the time of creation.
    If you don't have this library, I suggest you contact Steve McNamara
    of Leading Edge Software and enquire about collecting it. Enter
    'GTMenus' as a tooltype into the Information window of the
    BlitzGUIGen.info and you're all set.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-g'

    @{b}NOKEYS@{ub}
    This switch will turn off creation of a loop to check for your
    key presses. This is created automatically according to the defined
    key shortcuts in your gadget text. The key immediately after the '_'
    will be used as your key to check for. Case sense is switched to all
    lowercase shortcuts. If you require upper case shortcuts, you'll have
    to change them manually.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-k'

    @{b}NOMENUS@{ub}
    This switch will turn off creation of menu code. Any menus that have
    been defined in the .gui file, will NOT be created. Useful, I
    suppose, if you were composing an 'include' file where you only needed
    some of the gui instead of all of it.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-m'.

    @{b}SELECT@{ub}
    This tooltype will turn on the creation of @{b}Select/Case@{ub} loops
    for gadgethit and key trapping. The main reason for including this is
    because I have had problems with @{b}Gosub@{ub}'s from inside
    @{b}Select/Case@{ub} loops. When the return is executed, Blitz throws
    up the 'Return Without Gosub' error. Using @{b}If/EndIf@{ub} loops
    cures this. Now you have the choice of which one you want to use. I
    since found that the use of 'POP SELECT' before the Gosub cures this.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-c'.

    @{b}FUNCTIONS@{ub}
    This tooltype will now organise the source so that any sub-routines
    will now appear at the top of the outputted code in the form of
    'Statements' or 'Functions'. The calls to these sub-routines has also
    been changed to reflect this. the default option here if this tooltype
    is omitted is that sub-routines are created at the bottom of the source.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-f'.

    @{b}COMMENTS@{ub}
    This tooltype, if present, will cause somewhat detailed commenting of
    the created source code. This can greatly simplify the understanding
    of the code structure to the newcomer. For the more experienced
    @{b}BlitzGUIGen@{ub} user, leaving this tooltype out will supress the
    embedded comments.
    This is the same as the CLI parameter '-l'.

    Registration fees are as follows:

    The cost of a keyfile is now 15 UKP. This can be sent to me as cash
    or in the form of a cheque. Overseas users can opt to send a Euro-Cheque,
    but however the method, the payment should be in Pounds Sterling. If any
    other currency is used, it MUST include a further balance to allow me to
    convert it into English Pounds. If it is found that there are insufficent
    funds to cover the price of the keyfile, you will be notified by you're
    preferred means, and the balance should be forwarded to me as soon as
    possible. In the event that the balance is not recovered, you're keyfile
    WILL NOT be sent to you, and the money will cover the incurred expenses.

    Any subsequent updates and bug fixes will be released via the Aminet
    archive, usually in dev/basic.

    In all correspondence, please quote your full name and address,
    and your current version and revision number. Also specify how you
    would like to receive your keyfile, ie: by Snail Mail, EMail or by

@Node _HISTORY. "History of Releases"

    Below is an up to date list of releases and version
    numbers, and some comments pertaining to each:

        @{b}Version 1.0@{ub}

        Compile date: March 1995
        First official release. Put out to Beta-testers
        and messages posted to AmigaNet Blitz area to
        check out feedback. Uploaded to Waltons
        Mountain BBS, but not complete version. Minor bug
        found in #GTST_String and #GTTX_Text routines, not
        reading the default string properly. Hopefully
        fixed now!.

        Also added the owner routine for release. A crypted
        string embedded in executable, to allow for tracing
        purposes. This allows me to track the coverage of
        different sources of distribution.

        Currently, version 1.0 does not support the creation
        of custom screens, even though you may have created
        one from inside @{i}GadToolsBox@{ui}. This maybe
        something to include in later releases, depending on
        demand and support.
        Also added the BlitzGUIGen.doc. This included for
        people who don't like HyperGuide documents.

        @{b}Version 1.01@{ub}
        Compile date: 14/4/1995
        Added 2 more tooltypes:
        EXTENSION= to allow the changing of default save suffix.
        SAVEPATH=  to redirect saving of source files.
        Updated AmigaGuide + doc (again!).

        @{b}Version 1.1@{ub}
        Compile date: 23/4/1995
        After degrading back to 2.04, it was found after continuous
        use, that there were still crashes just waiting to appear.
        Small code rewrites and a re-compile later, and it seems stable
        again.

        @{b}Version 1.2@{ub}
        Compile date: 18/5/1995
        Owing to a few complaints about supporting old software, I have
        hopefully, allowed @{b}BlitzGUIGen@{ub} to support @{" GadToolsBox V2.0 " Link GadToolsBoxCopy} b or
        V2.0c. V2.0c still hasn't come into my possession due to the fact
        that the 'V2.0c' distribution is actually V2.0b repacked!!!!
        Unfortunately, this means it is, as yet, untested with V2.0c.

        @{b}Version 1.2a@{ub}
        Compile date: 21/5/1995
        This is an interim release as a minor (but inconvenient) bug
        was found in the file verify routine. All fixed in this
        version.

        ---------------Future Updates Only To Registered Users------------

        @{b}Version 1.3@{ub}
        Compile date: 22/5/1995
        Finally, I've supported screens created within @{" GadToolsBox " Link GadToolsBoxCopy}.
        The type of screen is sensed and created appropriately.

        The following screen types are:
        Workbench - Blitz source uses Workbench Screen....Never! :-)
        Public    - Blitz source uses FindScreen to use front most
                    Public Screen.
        Custom    - Blitz source creates screen as defined from GadToolsBox.
                    Yet to support palettes, currently clones workbench
                    palette.

        @{b}Version 1.4@{ub}
        Compile Date: 28/5/1995
        Well this version now supports palettes for custom screens.
        The palette information stored in the .gui file will be converted
        into a set of @{b}RGB@{ub} statements setting the screen colours
        to clone that as described in the @{b}GadToolsBox@{ub} .gui file.

        @{b}Version 1.4a@{ub}
        Compile Date: 12/6/1995
        This upgrade thanks to Dave Dexter (tester). Font sensitivity
        now upgraded to set font in IntuiText. Any IntuiText printed
        into the window will now use the chosen font, instead of using
        the system's default.

        The screen size reading routine also has a problem getting the
        width and height on some gui's, but I am unable to recreate this.

        When no SAVEPATH= tooltype was specified, the source was being
        saved to launched path. Now corrected.

        The routine for checking gui file version was rewritten, and
        now there should be no problems with un-supported @{b}GadToolsBox@{ub}
        versions. Although, @{b}BlitzGUIGen@{ub} is still to be tested
        with Version 2.0c.

        ----------------Released into Public Domain again-------------------

        @{b}Version 1.5@{ub}
        Compile Date: Under Development
        The biggest feature of this release is the fact that it is now
        a key file upgrade. This version is freely distributable, but
        certain functions are unavailable without the key file. More on
        this later. Improvements and enhancements are:

        Screen reading routine now corrected and reads sizes correctly.

        The generated 'Main Event Handler' source now uses '@{b}Select /
        End Select@{ub} block, instead of @{b}If Then@{ub} block. This makes
        the output easier to read.

        A new tooltype has been added, 'MakeXTRA', and if present, this
        will create an ??.xtra file to accompany your source. See the
        @{" Using ToolTypes " Link tooltypes} section for more detailed info.

        The tooltype reading code has been updated and cleaned, as there
        seemed to be problems, which were found during rewrite.

        The version number and owner details are shown in the screen title
        when @{b}BlitzGUIGen@{ub} is running.

        The output source has been updated to include a @{b}GTArrowSize@{ub}
        command to accompany the @{b}GTScroller@{ub} gadgets. The arrow size
        wasn't being converted correctly, but this fixed it.

        Also, support for @{" PowerPacked " Link _POWERCOPY} .gui files has been added
        by request. This needs the @{" DeCrunch " Link _POWERCOPY} executable in your C: drawer.
        An error requester will appear if it can not be found, but it will
        only look for it when needed IE: unpacking crunched gui's.

        Unfortunately, the following functions are disabled without the
        key file:
            Keyboard Shortcuts
            Loading Blitz From BlitzGUIGen
            Crunched gui support
            Creation of Custom Screens in source
            Creation of Menu Lists in source
            Creation of .xtra file

        @{b}Version 1.6@{ub}
        Compile Date: 27/6/1995

        Well here we go again.....

        The most relevant update to this release is the support for
        GadTools Menu's. This come courtesy of Steve McNamara of
        Leading Edge Software. You will need a 'DefLibs' file created
        with the RIGTMenuLib.obj file in your 'userlibs' drawer. This
        will allow the use of the commands, added by this library, to
        create GadTools Menu's. This option can be suppressed, and source
        made to create standard Blitz menu's, by removing the 'GTMenus'
        tooltype from the BlitzGUIGen.info file.

        Also, another tooltype has been added in order to suppress the
        following function. The source can now create a loop to check for
        key presses corresponding to your gadget shortcut's. This is done
        completely automatically, but can be suppressed by adding the
        tooltype 'NOKEYS'. See the @{" Using ToolTypes " Link tooltypes} section
        for more details on these additions.

        You may notice, or not as the case may be, that the tags supplied
        for normal bevelbox's has been changed. This was because of 2 
        Enforcer hits during compiling. Strange error, but filling the
        tags out completely fixed it.

        Also the DetailPen and BlockPen defaults have been changed, as
        GadTools menu's were corrupted by incorrect colours. A DPen
        value of 0 and a BPen value of 1 looks correct, so I suggest
        sticking with this. It also matches the DriPens settings set up
        thro' Intuition.

        Also I'm afraid I've junked the document file as well, to try
        to keep the distribution size down. If you really need it, then
        contact me and I'll pass it up.

        One small note here is that a typing error was found in the CLI
        parameter parser :( and rendered most parameters useless. Needless
        to say, this has now been corrected.

        ----------------------BetaTesters Again------------------

        @{b}Version 1.7a@{ub}
        Compile Date: 3/5/1996

        This release now will handle multiple projects in one .gui file,
        and will output a complete source for each window found in the file.
        The filenames are differed by renaming each source file by inserting
        the number of the window into the source filename.
        If you elect to launch a new Blitz editor, BlitzGUIGen will inform
        you that multiple sources have been created and will show you the
        names of the source filenames. There will be a separate Blitz
        editor window opened for each source, and you can manipulate them
        as you need.

        Also, the font sensitivity has been updated to supply the font
        to the screen as well. Therefore, if you are creating GadTools menus
        the font will be used for them as well. I am yet to work out an
        'easy' way to get the screen title and window title to use the new
        font as well yet, but I'll keep trying. Otherwise it's starting to
        get more like a 'C' source creator :)

        I have also added a few new tooltypes.
        The first one is called 'SELECT', and this will allow us
        to specify using Select/Case loops for checking, instead of
        If/EndIf loops. The 'Select' loops seemed like a good idea to
        start off with, but I have run into a few problems with these
        loops. Mainly, executing a 'Gosub' from within the loop will
        throw up a 'Return Without Gosub' when trying to return. For
        this reason, I decided to go back to If/EndIf loops, but it's
        entirely up to you what you use.

        Next is 'WINDOWLABEL'. All the xxxLABEL parameters have been
        included really for my personal use, but I thought that someone
        else may be able to make use of them as well. I find them invaluable,
        as they make my life considerably easier, but that's my programming
        style. 'WINDOWLABEL=windonum' will force the source to use
        'windonum' as the value assigned to the window. All references to
        the window are now called via 'windonum'.
        The same goes for 'SCREENLABEL','GLISTLABEL' and 'MENULABEL' which
        all apply the same as above.

        The tooltype 'ACTIVATESTRING' has been added as well which will
        cause a small piece of code to be wedged into the keyboard reader
        so that key presses pertaining to 'String' or 'Integer' gadgets
        will be automatically activated.

        Added 'HIGHLIGHTLABEL' for personal use really. This will force the
        source labels to be preceeded by a '.' making them appear in the
        right hand column of the Blitz editor.

        The piece-de-resistance in this release is the tooltype 'TOGGLEGAD'.
        This will force the source to include a short routine at the bottom
        which will make the button react to a keyboard shortcut as though
        it had been clicked on with the mouse. By pressing the underscored
        letter on the button, the button will highlight, wait, and then
        unhighlight. This has been seen in program's such as Reqtools
        and SPOT, to name just a few. Now you can add this 'professional'
        look to your own code automatically.

        Added yet another tooltype. 'FUNCTIONS' now allows you to have
        @{b}BlitzGUIGen@{ub} to create 'Statements' out of the subroutines
        instead of having 'Gosub xxx'. This has been suggested by those of
        you that are heavily into structured (??) programs ;)
        The default setting for this is the absence or to create sub-routines.

        While on the subject of tooltypes, 'COMMENTS' now allows to you
        turn on the creation of embedded comments in the created source.
        By omitting it, this turns the option off.

        Another bug squashed! :) It seems that @{b}GadToolsBox@{ub} doesn't
        save a palette for the custom screen if you haven't editted it.
        Therefore the screen copies the WB palette, but this info is not in
        the .gui file. Consequently, BlitzGUIGen was trying to convert a
        palette that wasn't there :( That problem is sorted out as well now,
        and BlitzGUIGen will now sense if the palette is present, and if not,
        will clone the WB screen's palette.

        Many rewrites of various code sections, formatting of output, and
        optimisation have taken the bulk of the time on this release. The
        main source improvement being the presence of proper menu checking
        loops in source now. Instead of just checking for any menu event and
        then quitting, we now have a full set of 'ItemHit' statements to
        build onto. Comments and labels are, of course, included.

        Yet another improvement has taken place. I have now included the
        code to 'join' a listview to a string. If this option has been
        selected from within @{b}GadToolsBox@{ub}, the source code generated
        will enable your code to be able to highlight the selected item from
        the listview in the string gadget placed underneath it without any
        coding on your behalf.

        Finally ironed out an annoying bug that caused loads of 'hits' and
        a crash when exitting. Strangely enough, while rewriting some
        apparently unrelated code, it righted itself. Wierd!

        Fixed another bug. My fault this one! BlitzGUIGen will look at the
        font used in the .gui file and see if it exists on the system. What
        I did was to scan the Fonts: dir to check, but the default font of
        'topaz.font' size 8 isn't there, it's in the ROM. BlitzGUIGen threw
        up an error saying it couldn't find the font, and was changing the
        font to 'topaz.font 8' ;) Silly I know, but fixed now!

        Also added the ability to assign the gadget ID's to a set of
        constants. This facility, according to my main feature suggester,
        makes the code more easily modified! Thanks Tony!

        Crashing on exit returns <grrrr>. After labouring for ages to find
        it, Paul Juhasz steps in and saves the day. Hurrah!

        Version 1.7a Rev 37.140 finally goes public!
  
  Versions up to 37.143 contain small bug fixes and tidy-ups. Nothing major.

@Node _BUGS. "Oh Dear, I've Found A BUG!!!"

        In the unlikely event you find a bug :( , you should mail me
        a copy of the saved .GUI file to one of the contact addresses given
        above.
        You should, also, never receive any error messages while creating
        source, but you may get an 'Unsupported Tag' error. If you do, please
        send me the .gui file and we can try and sort it out.
