Thilo Koehler's AB2 Sourcecodes 

============================================================

___________________________________________________________

INTRODUCTION:
___________________________________________________________
I decided to put all my sourcecodes (except my commercial products) to
internet for use in your own programs or just for educational reasons. 
You will find here a lot of stuff like AHI, Camd, Game Routines, TCP/IP
and a lot more.
There are ready-to-compile programs and include files to use for your own
programs as well.
Most include files have a build-in demo whenyou run them, that should
give you an idea what the include is about.
Take especially a look at the "Demos" directory if you are interessted in
writing fast, graphicscard compatible 2D games.
