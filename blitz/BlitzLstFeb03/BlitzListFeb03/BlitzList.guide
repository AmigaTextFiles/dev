						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

Subject: @{b}About posting big files.@{ub}

Hi,

I don't really want to take sides.

Bernd has helped me in the past and I fully appreciate his doing so.

I also read that he doesn't have a free home page which makes it difficult
for him to do as someone suggested and just post a link.

I kind of know that feeling myself - though I don't make any programs etc
for public release.

Please don't be too harsh on him for doing it, though I must admit, I did
get a bit worried when it took so long to download my e-mail.  Thought I
was getting an aweful lot of SPAM.  ;-)  (Which is one think none of us
want.)

I haven't used Blitz for a LONG time, which is a shame, but I am glad to see
that some people are keeping the development of some programs alive.

Progorams like Blitz are good, as they allow us to make MORE programs.

Bernd, suggestion:

Aminet

Wouldn't they allow you to upload new versions there?

Cya!

Lets say people shouldnt whine about the occasional binary in an email, how often 
does it happen anyways. Besides its something he worked hard on and which many here 
appreciate to get. In my opinion its perfectly allright to send it to the list and I 
rather have a hard time understanding anyone whining about it.

Yes i can upload it to Aminet,a german amiblitz yahoo list is also there but
it is not open you must register to download files.The reason is that no
spammer can use mailadresses.E-Mail is the fastest way.Packing archives or
uploading costs more time.
 
And the big size of the update is a unique feature which happen not again
maybe 
for the next years.

The update is the step to write with AMiblitz fast graphiccard and AGA games
with
multichannel ahi Sound support.

The sourcecode from Thilo attached is about 399kb of excelent written code
maybe usefull for developers on other platforms too,so i think its
intresting for everyone.

I pay by the second until ADSL has been re installed here, thats how our local calls 
get rated. Still about 1 Euro an hour so a 1.3 mb download would cost probably 30 
euro cents. And that at the most 3 times a year, with mostly smaller updates.

Hello all!

I think the traffic about this topic is exceeding the
original email size of what that point of argue was.

I think the update is the traffic worth.

Big thanks for Bernds great work!

If there is interesst I could host AB2 on my homepage.
I could do a subdomain amiblitz.hd-rec.de and
set up a site for download of the current releases.

Ciao,

Thilo

It doesn't bother me;  I was just pointing out it might bother some.  Mind
you, if I was on 100 lists, and each sent three 1Meg+ d/l's per year, I
might start worrying.   :-)

Yes but you know Amiga is really dead not many use it today, so you can be
really sure you get not from each amigalist 3MB per Year.AB2 is out 1 Year
6 Months the traffic on this list is low this was the first large update.

If you take a look of what you get here you can see that there is no reason
to make another update of this large size 


Only what is really sure you get 3 MB of viruses/spam per year
And that for some Users in the list AB2 is simular like spam i know now

True of Amigas ML's, maybe.  I'm on lists for other software on other OS's
(yes, heretic that I am), as I'm sure, several others here.

Like I said, it doesn't bother me, I don't pay by the minute anymore.

> Only what is really sure you get 3 MB of viruses/spam per year

I used to, but since I changed e-mail address, I get virtually nil.  I don't
suppose it will last, though.  A pity that, here in the UK, few, if any,
ISP's offer server side spam filtering.

Less people, yes.
Dead, no.


Most people stop using amiga
because their friends use pc,
and few would stand up against friendship
to maintain their amiga hobby.

Its like a flood,
and when you are caught in the wave,
its harder to get out of it,
but some have even done that.

I got dragged in by a wave,
and almost drowned,
but then I saw a tree in my waves path.
I grabbed it and climbed up.
 Then it was just to wait till the flood had past,
and at this time, I am 100% Amiga.

It was abit sad that some of my friends went with the flood,
but I got new friends, and its all in the past now.
Im happy for all my choices.

The biggest Problem in Amiga i see is that the stupid PPC Programmer get

They promised since several years A PPC Amiga and PPC OS
Only workable solution is since 2 Years X86

I think only when PPC Delevloper say.
We are to stupid to program a usefull PPC OS 
AmigaUser/Developer make the choose to give up AmigaOS,using old slow
Hardware or using cheap X86 Hardware and fast AmigaOS.

But now rest of User sit and wait most developer give up Amiga they dont
know what to do,the old Hardware is too slow for programs for Audio Video
Imageprocessing in 1600*1200

Maybe if OS4 really come AmigaUser make the choose and developer see for
what they should develop software

But i believe this not

Most Users have a PC or Mac i think not if the quality of OS4 is good enough
that User pay 1000$ for that to get 2 Year old portet Games.
The only way i see for AmigaOS is make it available on all platforms.

For my eyes is Amiblitz AmigaOS UAE simular to JAVA,it is a virtual CPU
System if user like a JAVA Program they use it but none install a full 100%
JAVA System without Linux Windows or MAC   

But Amiblitz have advantage to be 30% slower as C native no interrupt Task
limit....
 
I think if JAVA have simular Features to Amiblitz noone need C windows gone
more and more.....

I was mainly reffering to 68k Amiga.

People who promise things just wants to rise the trust in them.

games and prog's fun and quality is not in the computer,
but in the developers.
 -Thats why I have no urge to drown in the pc flood,
nor surf on the risky ppc waves.
I just enjoy what I have, and how the amiga custom chips
work like a chain with all links equally strong,
unlike modular systems, where the sound can float away,
while the graphic steps.


but Im probably just too excentric and amiga attached...

...allthough I love it. :)

From: amorel <amorel@...>
Date: 02-25-03 18:18:40
Subject: @{b}After high demand ;-) CreateNewProc_@{ub}

There was some talk about starting a new process on this list, in the Summer.
I checked the archives as I had to do this. A full solution wasn`t given, but
from a mix of emails on different subjects(about cia interrupts for example) I
did find a solution:

****************

some code
....
taskend.b=NFalse ;this variable can be set to true to quit the process
taglist.l=0 ;this is the taglist variable

;somewhere before mainloop starts
MOVE.l a5,globbase ;reserve global variable base for new process

NResetTagList #NP_Entry, ?wap
   NAddTag #NP_Name, "Whoppa"
   NAddTag #NP_Priority, 127 ;this is highest priority, I need that but 
                             ;normally you want something lower ;-)
*proces.Process=CreateNewProc_(taglist)
if *process=0 then it$="has failed"
....
more code

;this is the code for the new process, it has name: Whoppa

.wap:
   MOVEM.l a0-a6/d0-d7,-(a7) ;save registers
   MOVE.l globbase(pc),a5 ;global variable base
   sec.l=0
   Repeat
      uselessvar.b=NTrue
      ....
      more code ;probably some delaying code if not anything cpu intensive
                ;needs to be done(an undelayed loop at priority 127 tends
                ;to make your computer very unresponsive ;-)
   until taskend=ntrue ;this will be set to true in the main process
   MOVEM.l (a7)+,a0-a6/d0-d7 ;restore registers
   RTS
   globbase: Ds.l 1
return

****************

Most of this I figured out myself with some pointers found in various 
emails.

The asm code i ripped from an email by David McMinn about how to use blitz
code in an interrupt handler. So this should work with that too and similar
things.

This does work and is far cleaner than using the execute command. Thilo is
using that solution, but then you need an external binary(or maybe incbin`ed?)
and if that has been deleted or whatever, then you have problems.

I gave it priority 127, that makes it certain that the process will always 
run uniterrupted by other things except ofcourse hardware interrupts. I
could make a similar interrupt handler(I think) but interrupt handlers have
the ristriction you can`t do any intuition and i/o stuff etc and in the new
process one can happily use every os and blitz command. Maybe I`ll
give an option to switch from one to the other method. I`ve yet to get this
process to slowed down or so, so it is very "stable" so to say.

Hope this might help anyone.

Here is example of a oldwaytest.ab2 (in thilo_includes)style file.To get ahi
working you need include all this files.

If you not use the distri deflibs i recommend that you make a copy of the
amiblitz2 file maybe to amiblitz2_distrideflibs and rename the distri
deflibs to maybe deflibs_distri

Now set the tooltype in your amiblitz2_distri file
LIBFILE=blitz2:deflibs_distri

Now you can start amiblitz2_distri and load all includes you need and save
it as AB2 format to ram or so.

Now start your standard Amiblitz2 and load this files in and save as bb2
(BB2 is need for include)

The reason wy i not distribute asci include files is simple because there
must always keep two files konsistent the ab2 and bb2 file and risc is high
that 
i forget update 1 file

I recommend to build a .res.This have the advantage that you have help
exithandler you need to know what files to include...

The exithandler is very important if you quit your program in debugger
because the ahidevice or imageinclude need to cleanup gracefully or you get
strange crashes
  
To build your own tklibs.res (for your tokens)you can load in
make_tklibs.include.bb2 compile it and save the resident to maybe
tklibs_own.res

Now you can use all functions if you like.

The remove unused functions feature of AB2.3 work on both ways per include
or per
.res
so program size is always same

optimize 4
#developobject=1   ;This should enable to use it as include at start of
programmain

INCLUDE "error.include.bb2"

Thanks for the explanation but:

If I do this amiblitz crashes(I didn`t copy the amiblitz binary but that wouldn`t 
matter) when I start it. By the way one command "Optimize" 
tokenises to "ReadFolderSpool_" no matter what, what library has Optimize?

Theres also some other commands which may tokenise incorrectly, but its hard to be

You use 217 218 in your program.See davidsdeflibs.txt what libs are reserved
But you can remove optimize commands they are not need if you dont optimize 

Can you look with snoopdos what crashes ?
Maybe you have some libs in blitz2:userlibs/beta ?

The labelwindow show you in windowtitle the used deflibs.

Hm maybe, I`ll check that also, also it crashes the system so I can`t see what

I tried to use another deflib again and now it doesn`t crash but the pointer keeps 
being a waiting pointer. It actually does sometimes work fully but its a hit and miss 
afair and mostly doesnt work. I moved out both patchlibs and beta, don`t know if 
patchlibs should be still there or not. But it has not got much effect. Also when i 
get the other deflib to work the readfolderspool command shows up as ???lib 216 
something :-)

Hello amorel

If you want you can delete all deflibs and acidlibs and
copy all decompiled libs to blitz2:userlibs/..
Then it is very easy to change libs or libnumbers,
just by copying files.
You can even have subdirectories within userlibs/...

I can send the decompiled collection of libs to you.

Hi there,

I just noticed that the latest all.res isn't. I use MUI2.res extensively.
Attempting to compile one of these programs with all.res instead fails on

one or the other, but is there a chance someone could fix it at some point?

Cheers.

Fish disks eh? Doubt many would be on the net, they were around when BBSes ruled the

Any use (I'm guessing it's in C though)?

There might also be an explanation in the RKRM, but I guess you've been through that

The problem is that the image is remapped to 5 or 6 colours, I get a couple more colours if the source
is in jpg format.

I've tried loading the palette and using that before the picture is loaded, it just looks worse but still ony 6 colours :(

It works fine on a 16 bit screen but I need the extra bit of speed from 8 bit, I'm only putting text over the image.
I only need an 8 bit screen and can't see the point of using 16 bit when it's not required :(

Can you send me the image and or a example code ?

Take also a look on dbl_benchmark.It use lots of colors and look also
good on 8 bit screens with only 64 colors

You can try here to load your picture

The guigfx library,render library is used to dither images the render.libary
is now rewritten von Timm maybe here is the bug

I had this problem once too. It was gone when I made the executable.
I have never found out what the reason was. Maybe it has something to do
with the screen tags (an 8bit screen does not necessarly use 256 free pens).

Use the most recent version of image.include and AmiBlitz. Make an
executable
and check if the problem is still there. Then I can have a look at the code.

Ciao,

Amiga seem dead looks like noone use it 
But not Amiblitz on AmigaOS it can live forever on every Hardware

The new AB2.3 Version with many new features for ahi support gaming,thanks
to Thilos includefiles,updatet help.. all in all 3,7 MB new stuff

See the history in the amiblitz.guide for new features 

Please backup your old AB2 install und copy this over it.

This has a beta Compiler (Compiler skip functionsfeature)but i guess it is
stable now.If you notice problems please report and replace it with your old
compiler

Try also the dbl_benchmark

This show that it is possible with a Z2 Amiga with gfx card to write games
that support 640*480 16bit and 20 movable 32*32 Objects and softscrolling 

Also AGA Users can take a look on it.With quality/speedloss you can also use

Daniel has a fair point. I don't particularly agree with being sent
files of this size either (and indeed, back when this list was rather
popular I was given a warning for sending a 100 kB file!)

The only reason I don't complain is that I don't pay for my online time
anyway (other than the flat £13.99 rate) so it makes no difference in
the "long term".

Same here :) I still develop for the Amiga (although not as much, and
very rarely - usually when I can throw the missus off the damn thing)
but a few of the topics discussed on here are relevant in some ways to
other languages and platforms.

Ah so if you have no Amiga OS running you can not use yam.I have configurate
YAM (on my PC winuae) so that it show files larger than 50 kb 
so i need not download the 3-4 128 kb viruses i get all day
  
But i understand now and send no files to list.

But making a homepage i am too lazy does someone know a free service that

Well YAM doesn't even support IMAP so I can't use it anymore. Sadly, 
because I like the light weigthness of it. Have to use KMail now.

Well I need to use IMAP, because I need to keep my mails in one place 
and be able to read from multiple places.

Years ago I used them for a basic site, they had a quick and easy

Or maybe you could setup an Amiblitz group on Yahoo, as that has a simple

Hey, I've got an ADSL connection (i.e. it costs me f#@k all to download it)
and I still can't find a reason to justify sending that amount of data to
people who don't give a flying f#@k about what it is, or more to the point,

Hi all!

I tested the example from Amorel. Thanks for this.

I attached it to this email that you can see my changes.

I have a couple of questions:

1) For some reason I am not allowed to call functions and statements.
Any idea why ? I always get "Out of Stack Space" error when the debugger
is switched on. Maybe it is only a problem of the debugger ?
For some strange reason the debugger is sometimes put into Trace mode.

2) Some blitz commands, like "Request" have problems when they
are called parallel. E.g. Allocmem works or variable handling works.
I think this is a problem of some blitzcommands and this can not be solved.

3) What about the A4 ? Does it has to be installed in the new process
as well ?

4) I think it is not neccessary to backup the registers on start of
the new process. Am I right ?

Thanks for any hints,

Thilo

Well the debugger does not work with the child process and it is advisable to switch 
off the debugger right before the child process code starts. It is hard to debug 
code without it, but there is no other way. Alternatively you can code requesters 
showing vars etc at crucial places where you suspect problems etc.  You should be 
able to use functions etc, but perhaps you may write functions in the child process` 
code instead. And here sometimes the debugger goes into trace mode also, mostly if 
sth triggered it, sth went wrong or whatever. Ignore it, a side effect of using 
multithreading I guess.

It`s best to avoid such a thing anyways, as 2 requests from the same app but in 2 
different processes isn`t a good thing for the user :-) Also if the child process 
does any gui stuff things may become tricky, but thats just a result of multitasking 
and all that. Also I forgot to mention, use semaphores at places where the processes 
use shared variables. It`s best to keep it at a minimum but still so that it prevents 
problems. LockBasic and UnlockBasic does this, it locks the other process so use it 
with care or responsiveness goes bad. It`s quite a tricky afair to do that, but if 
you do it carefully and take time to place those commands at the right spots you 
prevent lots of weird problems.

I tested this and it does not crash if you dont rescue
the registers. But it takes only (8+8)*4 = 64 bytes on stack, so
it does not matter.

I solved this with your help successfully. Thanks for your help!

AB2 since 2.26 allow a way to debug it.

Write at first line in your program DEBUG (must exact written) and compile
this program as a executable with debug on to ram or so.Dont start with
compile and run DEBUG is here ignored 

Ped must show the code where the stop entered our you see wrong source on
stop

Then start the program.When you reach the breakpoint then the debugger will
pop up This work in theory also in librarys but using a hdrec effect
library currently fail.

So if you notice problems in debugging it please make a example so i can fix
it

You mean thin in the direction of the movement of the knob? That size is completely under 
the control of gadtools.library AFAIK (since it automatically calculates the size and 
pixel position given the range and numeric position you specify).

Three possible solutions:

1) Manually alter the range if it gets too big, and maintain a variable for the range 
scale. For example, if the range goes over 16000 you may want to set the range to 8000 
and set your scale value to 2. Any value you read from the slider (for the position) you 
would need to multiply by 2. This would also solve the problem of having a slider which 
needs to take values >32767.

2) Use a GTScroller and keep the visible range large compared to the total range of 
values. Of course, you would then have problems selecting all values in your range unless 
you set the maximum value to be (real_numeric_maximum + visible_range). (This one is 
probably my favourite of the three.)

3) Find some other GUI system or a BOOPSI gadget which allows you to set the knob size.

I mean the size of the knob. In case of the horizontal slider I mean the
width.

If I have a slider with 100 pixel of size in the GUI and it has 100
positions the
slider knob is already so narrow that it looks ugly and is not easy to grab.
Wors is the vertical slider, as it is a relict from 2:1 screens, and the
height
is even half, that means exactly 4 pixels, which is on a 1280x1024 screen
nearly nothing.

I already did this. Problem is that it skips to many steps at once.

Hm... is it possible to mix the gadgets types?
Has someone experience with Reaction ?

Is that only when you click on the areas to the side of the knob, because I think you 
should be able to get single step movements if you grab the knob or use the arrows. You 
could also try forcing it back if you detect a change, but I do not know how well the 
display would work. Something like:

If GadgetHit=scroller_id
    new_pos = EventCode
    old_pos = old_pos + Sgn(new_pos-old_pos)
    GTSetPosition scroller_id, old_pos
EndIf

You should be able to mix them, just give the other gadget an ID which is different 
from all gtlib created gadgets - it should not touch it. Except when you do FreeGTList 
or DetachGTList - it may include it in those calls, but there is nothing I could do 
about that. You would need to manually remove your other gadget from the gadget list 
before calling those commands.

I do not know if Reaction works like gadtools (everything up to user) or MUI (where the 
system can handle most of it) so I do not know if you could mix Reaction gadgets like 
this.

@NODE "mail_63" " Top windows "
From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 02-21-03 01:43:59
Subject: @{b}Top windows@{ub}

Hi there,

OK - firstly I'll tell you what I want to do. I'm trying to detect when a window
that I've opened is covered by another window.

I've got as far as being able to detect if my window is not the frontmost window
on the screen by using the following:-

*mywin.Window =Addr(Window(0))
*Mylayer=*mywin\WLayer
*Myfront=*Mylayer\front

If *Myfront<>0 ;It's the frontmost window
    do stuff
else ;It's not frontmost
    do other stuff
End If

Now this is all well and good, but the routine returns a non zero value whenever
another window is made frontmost on the screen, whether or not it covers my (or
any other) window. I have a routine to detect if any other windows are
occupying any of the same screen area that my window does (meaning that they
are potentially covering it), but I can't find any relationship between the
addresses returned for their layers and the front layer. I've tried recursively
checking *layer\layer until I encounter a zero value (meaning my window) and
then comparing all the higher layers with known windows, but nothing matches.

The autodocs explain nothing about the relationships - so does anyone here know
how layers work and are referenced/cross refernced. I don't want to execute
superfluous code if there's nothing covering my window. At the moment, it
reacts on any change to the front window (such as opening a new window, moving
a window, clicking a windows depth gadget etc.) which is not what I want.

Any ideas?    

All the best



Steve

What you ned is IsUpFrontLayer() or similar. This will tell you the minute
any part of your layer is obscured by another.

P.S. It`s nice to actually see some email on this list.

Can anyone offer an idea here?   It's not specifically Blitz-related, but...

I have a Blitz program which I use daily for financial recording in my 
business.   Once I finish for the day I run a sanity-checker program over 
the data to ensure that it is internally consistent and, if all is OK the 
data is backed up.

I do one particular function once or twice a month.   The last time on 
20th January.   That worked fine.

Last week I had to do it again, but the sanity checker reported a corrupt 
database.   I restored from last backup, did a full sanity check (the daily 
one only checks stuff that changed today) and all was well.   Did just 
that function - corrupt database.

Restored database and went to previous version of program.   Same 
problem.   Repeated "Restore and go back one more version" several 
times until I realised that I'm back to a last October version of the 
program.    Obviously, since I've done this function several times since 
last October, the problem is not with the program.

Next, check the sanity checker to see if this was misreporting the 
problem.   This also was created last October so it was the one in use 
last several successful operations.

OK, so it's not the program, its not the sanity checker and its not a 
preexisting bug in the data.    Any ideas where else I can look?

Thanks

Hello Tony

hmmm, check anything you put in your wbstartup this year, your libraries (some badly written installer scripts put old libraries over newer ones), MUI libs if your progam uses it, any automatic (de)crunchers and any hacks/patches you
installed recently...
