						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

From: Thilo Köhler <koehlerthilo@...>

Subject: @{b}Blitz & Picasso96 problem@{ub}

Hi all !

Does anybody ever experienced this
problem: (and maybe knows a workaround)

I have a big/complex application programm
running on WB Screen.
It runns fine under Cybergraphix, but under
Picasso96 every GUI stuff slows terribly down,
while the CPU load is nearly 0%.
My Blitz programm is waiting with "waitevent" and
needs no CPU cycles, but every GUI operation
of other running programms like the System-Scout
is damn slow, you can watch how the buttons are
drawn line after line.

I also wrote some programms without these problems,
but I can not find out what is the reason.

Anybody an idea ?

Btw: Tried it with Picass96 using Cybervision64 3D and
WinUAE/uaegfx

Ciao,

Thilo

I to have had these problems and have never found a cure. 
Like you have said all works fine under CGX but under Picasso96
you could go and make a cup of tea whilst waiting for the screen to redraw.
I'm using a Cybervision64/3D BTW.

Cybervision64/3D that just about says it all :)

It's a cybervision glitch, the card does not do some things 'properly' and
has caused problems for the developers of picasso96, as fas as I know the 
CV64/3D drivers in P96 are still 'beta' versions and should be treated as such.
I think it had low priority because it already had it's own 'reasonable' software. 

One hint for CV64 users, try to avoid using VWait or WaitTOF_ commands unless
really needed, use Delay_ instead. P96 has to poll CV64 cards to get the 
'top of frame' info.

Something I've started doing since you first mentioned this to me, Nick, and you

And on that note, if you are using the REDDebugger, it uses WaitTOF_. I've 
created a patched version which uses Delay_ instead, which you can get from 
my homepage (url below).

Do you know if the CV64/3D drivers in P96 will ever be updated past this
beta stage? I have tried to contact the developers about this several times
but get no reply. Have you ever successfully contacted them? If not is there
any chance of somebody on this list correcting the problem, maybe David as he
made the fix for the Red Debbugger. Please let me know.

Subject: @{b}Re: Blitz & Picasso96 problem@{ub}

Hi all !

When I posted this problem to the picasso egroup
they told me that it was a problem with the Cybervision.
But it is not because it  is the same under UAEgfx.
Bussy waiting for the vblank seems to be the problem,
but it isn`t because the CPU load is very very low (<5%).
Also I notice this problem only with programms written
in Blitz, other programms just do fine, and I think the
Vblank is popular enough that some other prorgams
might use it. Replacing vwait with delay_ does not
cure this problem. I noticed also that the problem is
there everytime the debugger is on, and when it is 
of only if two programms are running, while the 
first programm that is started runns fine and the
following are slowing down. - Very strange !?

I will try the debugger patch, let`s see what happens.

Ciao,

Hi Jason!

Sorry for delay... Check the following 32k games by "Secretly!", all created
in BlitzBasic with some
inline assembler and hardcore optimizing ;)) They are not Worm clones but
nice to see what will be
possible with the language of BlitzBasic for Amiga ;)

DreamCars
SuperBall

DuzzleDobble

Games can be found on Aminet i think... Have fun...

Hello Blitzers !!

Sorry for my nearly nerve-racking question as this has been discussed
before, but I don't have all the past mails anymore.

I have attached an code section that displays a picture at startup of my
program. It uses datatypes but does not make any remapping. So the picture
is only drawn correctly on 24bit WBScreens. Is there any way to do a
remapping via datatypes ? Or do I have to make it myway ?

Greetings,

You should be able to get the datatypes system to remap the image. IIRC
you specify the screen and it all works nicely.

I haven't looked at your source, but when you create the new datatype
object you should be able to specify a taglist. You should specify tags
for PDTA_Remap,TRUE and PDTA_Screen,Pointer to destination screen.

Hi everybody!

I have a big problem with the "DisplayRGB" command - the AGA version of the
ECS/OCS "ColSplit" command!
I want just for fun open a 320*256*8 AGA Bitmap and draw from left to right
for big filled boxes (like for example
80*120) and every box should have another color! Let us just us color 1 for
box1, color2 for box2 and so on,
looks something like this:

1111111111 2222222222 3333333333 4444444444
1111111111 2222222222 3333333333 4444444444
1111111111 2222222222 3333333333 4444444444

Now i want a coplist efx like in my small old ECS/OCS example for every
box... Every box should have another
coplist efx... On ECS/OCS it is easy but how can i create more then only one
coplist for all boxes on AGA?

I used on my AGA example (not included and don´t work!) the command
"InitCopList 0,44,256,$13018,8,265,-4"
before any coplist playing... On AGA i am only able to create and show one
coplist and not some more ;(

Hope you all can follow me on my problem! I would be very happy if someone
can help me out and send me
an example of how i can do it... many thanks in advance...

IIRC negative numbers for the custom diplay lines means to allocate that 
much space per line. So in your example of -4, you can have 4 copper 
instructions per line.

And also IIRC each colour change needs 4 copper instructions for AGA. So 
you would only be able to make 1 colour change per line unless you multiply 
by the number of changes per line.

Well, here's an example, but it might not be any use as I used 
DisplayPalette instead of DisplayRGB (an old source file :). I think it 
does something similar to what you want and was fairly easy to do. The only 
problem would be that it would use more resources as it loads a new colour 
from the palette on each display line. You'll need to change the path for 
the font at the bottom of the sourec (font in archive), and you'll need the 
RIFNSLib.

Hope it helps.

Subject: @{b}Debugger & Messageports@{ub}

Hi all !

Does anybody noticed this behaviour:

If I set up a messageport with OS functions
the debugger can`t break the running programm 
anymore if at least one message was sent.

Maybe some signal flags are used by the Debugger 
which are overwritten by creating a messageport.

Is there a workaround or am I the only one who has 
this problem ?

Ciao,

Thilo

BTW: How to find out the right processor-type in OS friendly 
way ? (inlcuding the 68060)
The "processor" command gives no 68060 and is maybe
not OS friendly (or not suitable for the future CPU`s).

I've never seen that. The only time the debugger cannot break the program is 
if you have called the Wait_ (or WaitPort_) command from your program - the 
debugger must wait until your program is sent a message so it is not waiting.

>Maybe some signal flags are used by the Debugger
>which are overwritten by creating a messageport.

The debugger runs as a separate program, and doesn't use any signals (IIRC the 
debugger works using exceptions I think - your program has lots of TRAP 
instructions in it).

The proper way to do it is examine the execbase AttnFlags field, which is 
probably what the Processor command does. I don't think there is an easy way 
to be future-proof. For example, the PPC CPU is stored somewhere else 
(ppc.library or powerpc.library IIRC). You could examine the (currently) 
unused bits in the AttnFlags field, but that probably will not work as you 
would need to guess what future CPUs they would put there.

I guess you could use a library such as identify.library, as then when new 
CPUs are available only the identify library needs to be updated and not your 
code (and there's more chance of that happening than BB2 being updated ;).

@NODE "mail_15" " GeoWorld Developer Tool "
From: Andre Beer <AndreBeer@...>
Date: 09-23-01 21:14:52
Subject: @{b}GeoWorld Developer Tool@{ub}

Hi David,

after long time (nearly 3/4 year) I've done again something on 
further development of GeoWorld.

I've done completely german guides for PureBasic - as you should 
have seen - and a great chronic project for my sports club since 
then.

Now I'm writing a developer tool, which does automatically open an 
editor and load the right text from a GeoWorld directory (country - 
politics, City - economy ect.) after the user has choosen it in the 
GUI.

Do you still have the original code of GeoWorld V1.12 ?

It would be nice if you can help me a little bit when implementing 
the loading routines for the alphabetical-sorted city index. (which 
you have written for GeoWorld)

I will send you the sourcecode of the DevTool the next days...

The second problem is:
How does I correctly change the text of a GTMenu?
(Detachxxx command ?? -> GTFreeMenu -> define menu again 
with GTMenuxxx -> GTMenuSet)

Thank you in advance!

Regards

  Andre

Date: 09-20-01 17:10:49
Subject: @{b}GTMenu problems@{ub}

Greetings,

Has anyone come across the following GTMenus 'feature'.

I've got some toggle menus created with:

  GTMenuTitle 0,2,"Prefs"
    GTMenuItem 0,1,2,0,"Shadow"
    GTMenuItem 0,1,2,1,"Dithered"
    GTMenuItem 0,1,2,2,"Scrolling"
    GTMenuItem 0,1,2,3,"Fast Scroll"

  GTSetMenuChecked 0,2,0,shadow
  GTSetMenuChecked 0,2,1,raster
  GTSetMenuChecked 0,2,2,scrolling
  GTSetMenuChecked 0,2,3,fast

The problem is that when I use the menus, the option will
turn on but won't turn off.

This does not happen with magicmenu running, only with standard
workbench menus.

I check the menu status with:

  If MenuHit = 2
    Select ItemHit
    Case 0
      shadow = GTMenuChecked(0,2,0)
      GTMenuState 0,2,1,shadow
    Case 1
      raster = GTMenuChecked(0,2,1)
    Case 2
      scrolling = GTMenuChecked(0,2,2)
      GTMenuState 0,2,3,scrolling
    Case 3
      fast = GTMenuChecked(0,2,3)

Hi Thilo ;)

It´s very easy but we dont want to use the standard blitz commands, because
we want use OS commands
in fact of a much smaller sizze (you will save aobut 9kb of exesizze ;)

I am not really sure of what do you want... Only amounf of full chip and
fast splitted - or? However, here we go:


Function.l    MyFastFree{}
    Function Return AvailMem_($800004)
End Function

print MyFastFree{}
clickmouse
End


If you have 32 mb of fast ram, calculate   32mb * 1024 * 1024 = the result
that blitz will print out ;)
If you just want only the amount of chip mem, replace the $800004 to $800002
for ChipMem
or just try $80000 for TotalMem.... Hope it helps you a bit...

I need the total amount of memory installed, e.g. 128MB if

I want to calculate the percentage of free memory.
so I need the free memory AND the total memory of the system.

Hi Thilo!

My example with the function works very fine... If you would like to check
my small routine, you
will see - it returns the complete memory you have - not only the available
free... Just try my
code again and you see it works... If you want to get the result = 128....
Just calculate the
result/1024/1024 = 128 mb for example of fastram...

bye

IIRC it's because you are trying to access a label from inside a 
statement/function that is outside the statement/function, e.g.

Statement foo{}
  Restore bar
  Read a$,b$
  NPrint a$," ",b$
End Statement

foo{}
End
bar: Data$ "this","sucks"

Or perhaps it only happens if you try to Gosub to a label outside the 
function/statement. Either way, it means you'll need to change the structure 
of your code, or if the label is for some data you could try passing it as a 
pointer to the statement/function.

From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 09-23-01 22:45:36
Subject: @{b}MUI Image remapping@{ub}

Hi there,

I use an Imagebutton in one of my apps. The ILBM data for the image is
IncBin'd into my program, decoded to a bitmap, and grabbed as a shape. It's
fine here, but the palette isn't automatically remapped on other screens.

I've tried using both ObtainBestPenA_ and BDGfx.lib, both of which fail to
correctly remap the palette on 128 col AGA screens.

I tried creating a bitmap using the Bitmap.mui class and remapping using MUI
routines, then creating my own image button using MUINewObject with a
pointer to the remapped MUI Object holding the new image data, but this
screws up my button size (It seems to respect 8 bit boundaries).

So:- Is there a way to copy MUI Object data back to a blitz bitmap after
remapping so that I can grab the new, remapped image as a blitz shape, or:-

Is there anyway to use Newicon.library to grab the image from an icon,
mapped appropriately, into a blitz shape. or:-

Is there any other reliable way get a shape mapped to the current screens
palette before it's displayed. And:-

Why do both other routines fail on the 128 col screen. Is this an AGA bug?

All the best

How do you mean failed? Are the colours completely wrong? Are they all the 
same? Or are they close to what they should be, but just butt ugly?

I think I sent some code for doing this to the list recently (in the last 2-
3 months anyway).

Yep, I've got that, and had a look at it, but I can't figure out how to get

I assume you've tried changing the precision? Apart from that, there's not 
much else you can do with OBP. You could try writing your own colour matching 
routine and then use ObtainPen to lock it.

Well, it just used ObtainBestPen, so you'd probably get the same results with 
my code.

Use the remap routine to remap it and then just alter the NIBDrawImage routine 
so that instead of drawing to a Window, it draws to a rastport. You can easily 
set up a rastport to point to a Blitz bitmap, or even a shape (via 
ShapesBitMap).

InitRastPort_ &rp.RastPort
rp.BitMap = Addr BitMap(0)
; You can now draw to the Blitz bitmap through the rp rastport

Hi all !

does anybody know what the "Qualifier" command 
actually does ?
The result looks like a memory pointer, but
Peek.l(Qualifier) always returns zero.

Ciao,

No, SortList () is for list arrays. Sort() is for standard arrays. It never
crashed here (worked no problem), but it has crashed with some other users of my
program. I don't know why, but the best thing seemed to be to write my own
routine, which as I said, turned out to be a fair bit faster than the Blitz one,
anyway, and only took ½ dozen lines of code.

I take it you only do 2 swaps per loop? I wrote a routine like that, and it 
was about 40% faster than my own bubble sort routine (both written in basic 
- which might have been the problem). I guess they'd be a damn sight faster 
if I used a faster algorithm and converted to ASM, but I can't be bothered. 
Not even sure why I wrote it instead of using the built in functions :)

BTW, I thought Sort() was for lists, but I was only quickly flicking 
through the manual, so perhaps I was wrong. But if it is for lists, that 
would explain why it crashes ;)

  Ok, I know you don't want source- but I have Blitz source for many
sorts- up to Binary Tree- from that commercial Blitz doc/addon- can't
remember the name.
