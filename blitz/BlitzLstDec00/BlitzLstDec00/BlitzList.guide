                          Blitz Mailing List Guide
                          ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@netsoc.ucd.ie>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@netsoc.ucd.ie>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@host.domain", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@acc.umu.se or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

Oops, should have also mentioned, I was hoping to make it a bit like 
RoboSport (old Amiga/PC game), where you have teams of robots with fixed 
abilities, and the objective to kill the other teams.

I'd like to make it fairly simple. Even in a restricted "physical" 
environment, quite decent AI should be able to show up.

Well, hopefully :)

The 3.9 has had some strange random gurus, however now it's running smooth.

That you've confused me? :)

I found the source - it was in the bss source archive on b2k. The source 
for the debugger and all the libraries that RI wrote for it are in there. 
You could compile them (although it seems like the libnums are missing) and 
get the same version of the debugger you currently have. However, it says 
you need some patched Acid libraries which I cannot find :(

The ones that are missing are switchlib, stringfunclib, vallib and 
debuglib. Actually, I just noticed that switchlib and debuglib come with 
the LESDebugger, so that might be those ones.

Anyone got updated stringfunc and val libs?

So is there anything worth buying 3.9 for, apart from the shareware media
players? Any actual OS improvements? :)

Hello James!

Well, as in my case, going from a mix of 3.0/1 up to 3.9 I think it was
worth it, especially in the aspect it being so cheap to support Amiga :)

Besides that, well what can I say. Some patches doesnt have to be used
anymore, like Newicons and whatever patchy software you all run out there
:)

Besides that, Getting a full version of Genesis is by far worth the money I
spent on it because I'm in the need to network my computers.

What more.. well some GUI-improvements, some things to make the world a
better place like a findutil, calculate sizes of dirs/drawer and a _very_
nice implementation for automatic detection of filetypes with datatypes +
automatic unarchiving of files etc. These are especially useful for when a
PC-dude comes and uses my miggy... point-and-click.. I more a keyboard user
with tons of keyboard shortcuts and so on, but hey, this gives a more
'modern' approach if one sees this as being modern =)

I haven't had the chance of trying it as much as I want to, but so far I'm
happy with it altho it had some strange crashes at the beginning, many of
them caused by my own personal hacks (as always ) and also some programs
using MUI.

Anyway, there are more features to it as well, I just noted I was able to
remove my CD and plug a 2nd HD in and then automagically mount it without
removing the CD mount, quite nice.

I do which they put the SDK on the CD. Thats a shame in itself - I'd gladly
pay more for that.

Now that I've tried it for some hours it feels more stable than my hacky old
3.0 setup and I guess I'm even more addicted to the Amiga now than I've
ever been =)

I'm sure there are a some improvements behind the shell, but I havent
spotted many of them, ahh, fontcache is one =)

Well 3.9 has has ultra-wide-scsi support as well, just noted :)

Cancelled it yes, haven't had the time nor lust of putting enforcer to life
today, but i'll check. Regarding the latest version I'm not sure, had a
huge crash some weeks ago and I just installed some old backup i had here.
I can't even bother now to check what version I've got cus I don't have a
shortcut for Blitz so I'll just send thismessage and check when i wake up
on saturday or some other day =)

Yeah, I find OS3.5 a bit flakey with some things (well, actually, it seems
to deadlock with the menus a fair bit, but thats it).

Did you cancel the Eval window? I think someone mentioned on here before
that it causes an Enforcer hit, perhaps that contributed to it's downfall?
Or maybe you weren't running the latest version (the BSS debugger needs a
patch AFAICR)?

Since you have to buy it, you pay more for it already :)
It wouldn't be much use to users, so getting them to pay extra is a bit 
cheeky. H&P haven't decided whether the SDK will simply be a patch to 
download for the OS3.5 one yet, or a new version.

Unfortunately H&P haven't really told anyone what there are, their feature 
list was just the extra programs. But most are stuff that was available on 
Aminet and they've integrated them into the OS. Frankly, I never liked that 
FontCache util, because it only ever worked on the FONTS: assign (in fact, 
I think AvailFonts_ only ever worked on FONTS: also) which sucks.

Besides, ever heard about the buffer overflow bug(I bet there`s more) in
outlook. It makes the goodtimes virus come true(that is it takes effect and
infects while downloading :) Outlook programmers appearantly were dumb enough
to not check the date field size and anything above a certain size causes
overflows and thus makes room for a nice exploit. 

Anyone using outlook should check a doctor ;)

With all respect there are various versions of outlook.
Outlook Express - Latest version 5.x, outlook 97, outlook
2000 etc

I've worked as a COM programmer and outlook 2000
was one of the programs that the company i worked
for developed COM Add-ins for. I've done some
extensive testing with ant outlook2k doesnt seem
to have this problem.

Just saying so, since theres no use in alarming

Someone mumbled...

I did a small test where I had a bitmap, 320*196 and two shapes, 64x80
moving around in realtime, gave me somewhere around 50fps on a A4000/040/25
with CGX.
However, I am not able to test with AGA right now (my TV broke down the last
day) so I donno about how fast it would be with AGA. Look up on the
examples if you've got time or ask me later on if I fixe the TV or someone
else for an example.

Keep in mind that this was only having two fixed sized shapes so when adding
background, sound, different sized shapes and so on it'll drop quite easily.
That's the case with todays Amiga, don't expect any miracles from anything
lower than 030, a 040 is thought as an absolute minimum on todays Amiga,
maybe even a 060 soon.

128 pixels wide, then they'll take up 80% of the display if running at a 320
pixls wide screen, isn't that a little big? The bigger they are, the harder
they fall.. :)

Correct me if I'm wrong here, my memory isnt so good. With the AGA one got
the possibility to use up to 64 pixels wide sprites, is it possible to
attach two of such sprites to create a 128 wide sprite?
I know one can add together two normaly 16 pixels sized spites making them
wider, also having transparency, but what about joining 64 pxl wide ones?

But, if you wanna go for non OS-friendliness, slam that miggy with some
copper, blitter and spritetricks and see how it works.

Mildred can give you this type of display, even parallax scrolling.
Using the MScroll-commands you can offset separate lines in a shape, a
bitmap, a stencil or even a cookie giving it that parallax look. You can
easily make a unlimited amount of scrolling layers, it's all about CPU-time
and some headbanging (:

>> Also does Mildred support

There is something called Tables in Mildred who you can use to make many
kewl effects like making the shape you're blitting brighter, fuzzy,
smoothend and so on, you only need to know how to do it :)

In the case with 256 coloured displays, transparency can be a tough one,
then it's just a matter of a well designed palette when the overlapping
pixels should be replaced into a transparent one. Imagine, you've got your
normal palette, say 128 colours, then the rest 128 colours + some from the
normal 128 will be used to create transparent colours, might be a hard
task.

Hope that gives a hint.

Sounds fine to me, tho I don't know much concerning sprites...  But
what I do know is that you can't use sprites if youo want gfx card
support, which kinds kills the OS friendly upside anyway ;] Well,
except the multitasking...

Back to the easy peasy again =]

Only thing is it might take some mucking around to get these
projectiles blitted in front of the character sprites...  Of course,
you can always poke around a bit and blit the graphic over the actual
sprite data =] But then you're limited to the sprite colours for the
projectiles...

Again, can't be done using Mildred (not with the Displayscroll command

I think it`s best to use AGA only and bang the hardware. AGA has advantages

the chunky to planar version(for gfx card and/or cpu blitting). Also most
people DO have AGA and Paula really DOES sound better than the soundcards
Amiga have, or most pc soundcards. Don`t be fooled by the 8 bit issue. There`s
more to it. A soundcard might add more channels you think, but those are
software channels. Most soundcards have only 2 hardware channels(stereo)
whilst Paula has 4(!). Ah yes, besides there are not so many people with a
soundcard on Amiga afaik.

Actually when using AGA you could surely use the cpu instead of the blitter
for blitting(if the cpu is fast enough).

Hi all,

Thanks for all of opinions on my Amiga Mugen project. After reading all of
your suggestions and carefully considering all of the options I have decided
to go with a Blitz mode display as I think that this would produce a better
game engine in the long run.

I shall be staying with my original ideas on using sprites etc... as stated in
my previous message as they all seem to be feasible and would give the best
speed. I hope that not using an OS friendly method doesn't put anybody off.

Lastly, thanks for the offer of help Amorel. I will try to knock up a small

As I said Blitz mode is not terribly unfriendly. It`ll take you back to the

Subject: @{b}Amiga/ MUGEN Testrun!@{ub}

Hello everyone,

Please have a look at the included testrun of Amiga/ MUGEN.
Although it is obviously based on the crap fighter demo I have managed to
include everything else that I wanted to.

The demo includes the following,

50 frames per second (at the mo!)
32 colour dual playfield background (16 colours each layer)
15 colour sprites (independent of the backgrounds colours)
More colours if needed through the use of rainbows

128 wide 15 colour sprites (wow!) I had my doubts as to wether this would
actually work in practice but it has and it looks amazing. Who'd have thought
that we would see charaters this big on an Amiga moving with such fluidity.
The only drawback was that to enable all 8 sprite channels I had make the
screen width a bit smaller, still you wouldn't notice if you didn't know about
it. God know's how I am going to pull of the projectiles etc...

Two 16-colour playfields. I decided to go with a 32 colour dual-playfield
display instead of the 256 colour single playfield display as it gives a more
3-D layered effect which also looks ace with the displayscrolling on the
floor. The 256 colour one looked good when I tried it but it lacked the depth
that the demo now has. 32 background colours is plenty though I think and a
worth while trade off for the extra layers.  

Anyway, try it out and let me know what you think. Please also remember that
the sprites and background are both dithered down versions of the originals so
they look a little spotty. When I draw some new graphics especially for the
game they will have a much cleaner look.  

Before I go can I just ask a couple of quick questions. 

1. In the demo I have used a displaypalette 0,0,0,$00ee command
    to offset the sprite palette to registers 240-255. I copied this from
    another example I have but fail to see how $00ee gives us 240.
    When conveted $00ee=238 doesn't it. Am I just being dense? 

2. Could someone please give me a quick example of how I would use the excess
      on/off parameter of the blit commands. As I do not fully understand the
      description in the manual ( nothing new there then :)

3. Lastly, in the crap fighter demo, which uses a dual playfield setup, the top
      section of the front playfield stays stationary (the energy bars bit.) No
      matter how hard I looked I couldn't see how this was done. Can anyone fill me
      in? 

Best regards to you all,
Jason ;)

Having to make it that much smaller, you do notice :) Especially if you

No, it's because the last parameter is most likely to be XOR'ed with the 
current value to give you the actual value (in the same way as in 
DisplayControl, or is it DisplayAdjust?).

The default values are $11, but it isn't actually $11 - it is two separate 
values (for odd and even sprites) of $1. This is the high order 4 bits of 
the starting colour from the palette.

So, by default, all sprite colours start at $10 ($1 is the high 4 bits 
remember) which is colour 16.

The value $EE is the same, in that it is two separate values of $E for odd 
and even sprites. So when you XOR $1 and $e (0001 xor 1110) you get $F. 
Thus the colours start at $F0 = 240.

If you have a bitmap which is 5 planes deep, therefore 32 colours and have 
your palette set up. You then create shapes which are 4 planes deep (16 
colours). Now you have 1 excess bitplane. If you had a bitmap with 6 
planes, you would have 2 excess planes.

The easiest way to control the excess parameter is by specifying it in 
binary. The least significant bit in the excess parameter is the value for 
the first excess plane. Bit number 1 is the value for the second excess 
plane and so on. The value you set each excess bit to, will be the value 
that gets set in the corresponding excess bitplane where you blit your 
shape.

For example, you set the excess parameter to %11 (this is using 6 plane 
bitmap and 4 plane shapes) so now, when you blit your shape, all the non-
colour-zero pixels will set bitplanes 4 and 5 of the bitmap to a value of 
1. This has the effect of changing the colours of the shape. Instead of the 
shape colours being in the range 1 to 15 (excluding 0 which is transparent 
normally) the shape will be blitted using colours 49-63.

This is because you are setting bitplane 4 and 5 to 1 - shape colours are 
now %11xxxx where xxxx is the bits from the shae data.

I think CrapFighter doesn't use both playfields as backgrounds. The front 
playfield is used for the energy bars, walls and floor, and the back 
playfield is used for the sunset/hills/water. Using DisplayScroll to scroll 
different areas of one playfield at different speeds is how it gets it's 
effect of depth. I don't think the front playfield moves at all, except for 
the floor tiles, which are scrolled using DisplayScroll. So the front 
bitmap does not actually move at all.

I had to take a look at the PC Mugen to see what you mean. What you're doing

I think there is a way of tricking the copper into showing all 8 sprite
channels and widening the screen at the same time. It's something to do with
shifting the DMA to the right... any suggestions out there?

I'd put the projectiles onto the front front playfield. That would mean setting
up a colour palette that would accomodate the projectiles though.

I've been fiddling around with copperlists and I know a way of emulating 3
parallax arenas, so you can place a playfield in front of the sprites. It's a
trick, by writing a copperlist that changes BPLCON2 which controls what
playfield and sprites are in front of what.

Oh, regarding your palette thing. I think you use DisplayUser to alter the
palette for sprites(?!)

I use these commands to initialise a max overscan ntsc screen(I like ntsc
as it is 60 hz and doesnt flicker on my svga). The displayadjust command
does the overscan. That should do the trick even if you use all 8 sprites.

  InitCopList 0,21,241,$10868,8,256,-8
  DisplayAdjust 0,2,-8,0,-16,0
  DisplayControls 0,0,%0000000000010010,0

I`m using spritemode 1(32 pixels wide sprites) and I use 3 sprites, of 16
colours, thus each one using up 2 sprite channels. I have one sprite
channel left, which I used for a bit too as a test. It all worked great, it
also did with spritemode 2. That means you won`t lose much screenwidth, with
the displayadjust overscan thing. Also the displaycontrols command amongst
other stuff makes it able to display sprites into the border. What this
means is that sprites can go anywehere outside the
resolution/screen/bitmap. I made a big bad boing ball demo which does that
and it`s a huge sprite(all sprites connected) bouncing.

I wonder if anybody created an animated shape - some kind of moving letter

animation (128x128 pixels) to my program (I would like to add animated
drills to learn languages). Animation should be running independent of main
program - so probably it should use VBLK interrupt, but I'm not sure if it
should works properly on GFX card. And what about animation speed on
different screenmodes? Of course I could do all code myself but if anybody
have ready routine I shouldn't lost my time ;-)

Don't worry, everybody here has screwed up at one time or another.

You aren't really an official member of the list until you screw up at least

You need 2 Bitmaps and 2 Bitplanesbitmaps (you could probably just do this

use 2)

See if this example helps.

Would be of use if I were programming the solutions. I want other people to 
do the work for me :)

No, err, what I mean to say is rather than going for traditional programmed 
systems, I want to look at neural nets and things.

There was a student here who does this last year apparently, so I'll have a 
look at what he done.

I think I saw that too..(I once got on the corewar KOTH...honest ;) ) Pretty
interesting, basically he made a blue print for a program, something like
some data, some code, then some more data, fixed sized to start with, and
generated working programs with random code, then some of the top programs
mated with eachother (randomly copied bits out of mated program to make
children for those 2 programs), then threw in a bit change (mutation) every
blue moon, and just ran it many times, nothing really hard there, not
exactly evolution..but close.

 I think the main problems was in creating a good robot interface, giving it
the ability to understand its surroundings, so that it could figure out
things, like where other bots where etc, and how to move around objects. I
guess you could just create a bytecode instruction set, and have some in bot
 data storage, and pretty much duplicate the corewar experiment...could be
fun ;).

 I`ve not switched on my miggy for ages :(...havent had time..come to think
of it..haven`t used winblows much either...got a new job...keeps me toooo
busy! Have I missed anything interesting??

What exactly do you want to know about neural nets? I can explain the basics here:

A neural net works in the same way as a human brain learns. I could explain this better with a diagram but this set-top box doesn't draw pictures. There are inputs on the left (in biological terms the senses in your program whatever the AI has to react to). On the right are various actions that can be taken (in biological terms movement etc) but in your program what you want the AI to do. 

   Initially these are all connected randomly. However over time the probablilty that an instuction will follow the most commonly used pathways is
increased or alternatively the disused pathways can be eliminated or just their probabilty of use reduced.

   Of course the amount you change the probabilty each time affects how quickly it learns to do things and how imaginative it is with finding new ways to do things.

There are other more complicated aspects to consider but that's the basic.

Here's an example (very basic of a neural  net)


Input
2+2    ----2+2=4
       ----2-2=0
       ----2/2=1
       ----2x2=4

To start with pathways one and four would be increased equally in probability as they had given the right answer. However when other additions eg 2+3 the computer would "learn" that the best (most probable) action to do would be to add the two inputs together. However it would still have the ability to be re-trained to multiply, divide and minus numbers from each other. The logical thing would be to have the +,-,x,/ as inputs but let the neural net "decide" which one was which. Of course a more sophisticated system would "learn" the quickest way to do a particular task if time was factored
into its learning as well as accuracy.  

That's the theory - coding neiral nets and AI programming is quite difficult unless you already know exactly what you're trying to acheive. I haven't the time free tonight to write out an example piece of code in BB. 

I suggest you look up fuzzy logic too as this is an easier simpler to understand topic that is like a more basic version of a neural net.

Just thought some people might like to know some more specifics, he wrote a
C++ program which used Genetic Programming (like evolving programs for a
task) to compete in Core Warrior tournaments.

Core Warriors is a simulated computer for these programs to fight it out,
where they have to trash all the other programs running. Each program is
written in a custom assembly language called RedCode.

Anyway, the thing I was suggesting was different from this, as it would be a
simulated environment rather than computer, and using teams of simulated
robots to kill each other, rather than programs trying to overwrite each
other in memory.

Possibly, but if I was going to do that, I'd just run corewars :)

Don't think so. Not Blitz related anyway (you know about the PC version?). 
And PureBasic PR3 for Windows was released a couple of weeks ago.

Are the old posts to the blitz lists available as a download on the web? I remember that Amiga Format used to include a months worth of posts in Amigaguide format on their coverdiscs. 

I ask because my Amiga is offline and my brother insists I delete my e-mails from e-mailing lists after I read them. He's worried about me using up the 2Mb space. :-D It seems a bit selfish  as he gets an e-mail to this address about once every two months! I'm rapidly running out of accounts to forward them to!

They used to be uploaded to Aminet/dev/basic/  every month.   You might try
there, although I'm not sure if it is still being done...

Yes, Aminet in dev/basic (of course :). Also check out http://www.blitz-
2000.redhotant.com as it has direct links to those files (in the 
archives/documents section), you can read them on the web, and you can also 
search the archives (although the search engine I use won't let me have 
enough pages to cover all the archives - I might end up writing my 
own/adapting another CGI script for the searching).

They are still being done, however, it's usually the second week in the 
month that I get a chance to create and upload them (busy busy busy, and 
normally don't have my Amiga connected up much).

The archives for February, March and April of this year are not on Aminet 
because it keeps telling me the archives are LZX, even though I've tried 
different compression options in lha and even getting an old version of lha 
v1.38. I have the archives on mh HDD, I just can't get them onto Aminet :(

Maybe they've been blacklisted or somehting :(

Anyway, the archives for those months are online on the b2k site.

Hi David,

I'm back on this Monday, and found your archive. It seems 
that the problem is not YOUR archive, but the ones 
included in it. In Mail_263 and Mail_268, there are LZX 
archives. Aminet robot is doing recursive dearchiving, 
and rejected all the archive, because of those includes. 
I've just uploaded the new archive only with Lha, I think 
everything is going to be OK, just wait and see ...

Regards,

Maybe:
  gennum = Peek.b(buff+127)
  if gennum < 0 then gennum+256

Or:
  gennum = (Peek.b(buff+127) + 256) & $FF

Greetings,

First of all STOP ADDING HUGE ATTCHMENTS (246808 bytes for 3 emails yesterday) up
to 50k I can live with but not 165k emails. Ok enough ranting...

I am trying to read the tag from an mp3 and am having a problem with the last byte
which is the Genre setting (a range of 0 to 125 and 255 for undefined). The problem
is then when I read the value eg. peek.b(buffer+127) if the data is 255 ($FF) blitz returns
-1 ($FFFFFFFF). Possibly blitz is using a signed byte instread of unsigned?

Is there a quick way to find the value of a single byte, at the moment I'm using 
something like this:

    gennum=Peek.b(buff+127)
    If (gennum<0)|(gennum>125)
      gennum=255
    EndIf
    TAG$+"Genre  : "+Genre(gennum)+rt

I have also tried this:

    TAG$+"Genre  : "+Genre(Val("$"+Right$(Hex$(Peek.l(buff+124)),2)))+rt

Both work but it's a bloody complicated way to find the value of a single byte.

If anybody wants it here's my tag reading routine:

.initalise
  Dim Genre.s(126)
  For i=0 to 126
    Read Genre(i)
  next

.readtags
  tempfile.s=GTGetString(0,50)
  If ReadFile(2,tempfile)
    buff.l=AllocMem(128,65536)
    FileSeek 2,Lof(2)-128
    ReadMem 2,buff,128
    CloseFile 2
  EndIf

Yup, Blitz assumes signed values for everything.
You can do this to get the correct values:
    blah.w = Peek.b(&wherever) & $FFFF

That will get you 0-125 and 255.

Ah! that explains it. Everything is working fine now.

well reorg uses a ram cache that is proportional to the size of defrag
partion. You can try to improve the "security memory level" in advanced
option. 

    If that will not work, I suggest to switch to another defragger... one
is called "disk optimizer" I think it's on aminet and it's shareware...

   There also other optimizer.. Search for "optimize" and "defrag" on
aminet... cya

It is supposed to allocate some new memory I think, but I don't know if it 
does actually do the freeing of the old memory. It should, but you never 
know, after all, strings aren't freed until you exit your program.

> I've come to the nice error message:

This sometimes happens when you either:
    Try to free memory that has already been freed
    Freeing memory but doing it the wrong size

Most of the time (for me anyway) this involves using pointers incorrectly 
and writing over some memory that the thing needs to free it, e.g. the size.

I just tried to dim and then re-dim an array and it worked OK. I'm guessing 
the problem lies with something you've done to the array

How do you make the programs geerated by genetic programming error-free though?

I've thought in the past of doing a simple genetic program but I decided it would take too long to code!

If anyone remembers the Royal Institution 
Christmas Lectures from a few years back they had a program that "showed" how the shape of spider's webs had evolved in order to trap flies more efficiently. Has 
anyone ever combined genetic programmming with a neural net which could result in the new programs having built-in "intincts" before they'd even started to "learn". Mind you I'm starting to question my own sanity by even writing such a strange possibility. 

    It's probably just science-fiction at  
the moment. When will programs write themselves then? It still seems a long way off.

Goes before he gets a reputation for being a little crazy on this list.

You don't (or at least, you can't guaruntee it), unless you specifically 
code it to be error free.

Probably, since instinctive behaviour is a simpler thing to create. Most of 
the time in robotics, this takes the form of reflexes (functionally similar 
to pain reflexes in biology) so that when the robot collides/is about to 
collide with something, it backs away or takes a new trajectory.

> the moment. When will programs write themselves then? It still seems a
> long way off. 

In a way, using GP to create CoreWar warriors is doing just that. Since the 
GP program is effectively writing RedCode ASM programs. OK, probably not 
exactly what you meant :)

Remember that it is possible to 'take-over' the Amiga by setting your
program to a very low priority, thus giving your program more cpu-time. 
Bltz-mode in itself is just a matter of switching off the proper DMA
channels, thus owning a small or huge amount of your Amiga CPU. The
graphics.library has support for things like Sprites, control over the
Blitter and Copper + more so using that in conjunction with prioritie- and
interruptissues might be something...

One could also use CloseWorkBench() to get some more chipmem on AGA.

;--

Keeping things as compatible as possible is better today. You're gonna see
yourself go through a hell with todays different speced Amigas, one who
goes for hardware banging these days is asking for trouble (with
exceptions) :) 

I still, as you guys might have guessed suggest using rather OS-friendly
programming, Blitz-mode is the BEAST and should only be used in things
like.. uhmm.. like what? =) Maybe a few phong-donuts :)

Naw, not that dangerous nor serious lads :) But this is my general idea.

Surely you mean a higher than normal priority?

+127 = highest priority, take over whole machine, and probably cause so
       many deadlocks that nothing ever works ever again :)
 +25 = priority of input.device I think, or maybe it is the task scheduler
 +?? = it's better if you put your priority in this range
   0 = normal
-128 = lowest priority, would probably end up never running :)

Worms uses Blitz mode and didn`t hurt me or many others. AGA hardware and
Paula is what IS as much standard as you can get. You`ll get the whiners who

games(which do both AGA and RTG(gfx card)) ARE faster. Still most people do

I just wanted to point out that I have a standard AGA system, and Worms does
NOT work on it properly.
My system is NTSC,  and to run Worms I have to re-boot directly into PAL
mode using a floppy disk in order to run Worms from my HD.  And even then,
it sometimes falls back into NTSC mode (meaning the bottom of the screen
disappears) when changing screens.

And, I have seen many hardware-hitting games and demos that simply won't run
no matter what on my system, or worse yet cause an instant crash.

The problem with hitting the hardware is that it makes a lot of assumptions
about what hardware is there.

Mark Sibley has even told me (on the BlitzPC list) that Blitz Mode was a bad
idea, and he wouldn't do it again.

I think Blitz-Mode is largely responsible for the bad reputation Blitz has
gotten, for being "unstable"

As Fred pointed out, you can now do everything that could be done in Blitz
Mode through the OS these days, unless you are still using WB 1.3 or
something.

I'm not sure what PC games you are talking about, or what sort of PC you
have seen them on.

But I haven't seen a 2d (or 3d) game on my PC that flickered at all.

Also, all the OS friendly Amiga games run flicker-free on my AGA/030

I agree with Fred, that hitting the hardware only makes sense if you are
programming for an A500.

Ofcourse and matters wouldn`t be any different if the game was OS
friendly. Because OS friendly doesn`t mean it runs on every system
around.

Then either your system had some problems and/or (most likely) the game
was badly coded. Hardware hitting doesn`t need to be bad(hell the OS
does it ;)

It`s not strange to assume AGA is there and Paula(she has been there

Ofcourse it`s a bad idea! I`d go for more friendly approach any day, BUT
it still should allow access to all the features of the gfx system(just
like any decent 3d gfx dev environment does). Problem is, only in Blitz
mode you can access the gfx system fully and even the OS doesn`t allow
full access to the gfx hardware, sadly. So it is both Commodore`s and a
language developer`s fault. This leaves the coder to use the crappy
tools available. Luckily one can bang hardware without much problems to
the whole system, if done correctly.

I don`t know.

I don`t believe that. Since when does an OS generated screen allow full
control of all sprites and other tricks? If that`s possible then that`s
sure new to me. Even so, easy it won`t ever be.

> I'm not sure what PC games you are talking about, or what sort of PC you

Any pc 2d game I saw. That`s a while ago as everything is 3d now, sadly.

> But I haven't seen a 2d (or 3d) game on my PC that flickered at all.

Well, I don`t mean flicker as in interlace or 10 hz or something. But
non pixel perfect and not vertical synced scrolling etc. That`s flicker,
or jerky or whatever. 

> Also, all the OS friendly Amiga games run flicker-free on my AGA/030

But how os friendly are they? Running in multitasking and such doesn`t
guarantee much in itself.

Again I`m all for more friendly programming, but not giving up gfx
power as a result. I want to use BOTH full AGA and the cpu.

I think Curt was meaning more along the lines of the NTSC/PAL issues, which 
then affect screen sizes and timing issues.

> > I think Blitz-Mode is largely responsible for the bad reputation Blitz has

No, I think Blitz had a lot of bugs in the libraries and the language, in 
fact some of the bugs are still kicking around. If you add bad coding by 
the game programmers (and there was plenty of that too in the early days) 
to the bad code in the libraries, you're asking for instability.

It's not Blitz mode's fault (the theory is sound: you can take over the 
system completely as long as you put it back properly), unless there are 
bugs in the related pieces of code.

I'm sure you can. Because you can create custom copperlists for OS screens, 
although it involves you taking over the display I think. Hmm, kind of 
removes the OS screens thing then eh?

There is no RWE site (that supports Blitz anyway).

You've tried what from the CD? Blitz? BSS? The CD is pretty much a mess,
and the install script is broken. There's a fixed one on Aminet (in
dev/basic called ubbinstall.lha I think).

And if it's not that, what doesn't work about it? What error messages are
you getting?

Moorhuhn is a pc based shoot em up game with paralax-scrolling like
in old a500 games like "Shadow of the Beast"! You must shot up some
flying moorhühner (=engl. flying chickens)! The medias are reprorting

Well, I just wanted a still screen, no scrolling but masses of garbage on

You have a valid point, the only trouble is that crap mailer you are using
is including an attached version of the mail you are replying to, hence
wasting even more bandwidth. Then to top it off it is also attaching a MIME

Three more ways (that all worked for me):

1} Cludgy method:  Add spaces to your menu strings until it comes out
right...

2} Best way : Convert to GTMenus (they look so much better anyway, and are
no more difficult to use)

3} Easyest way : Install MagicMenus - then ANY menus will look and work
well...

Hello

Someone would can test this program with a graphic card.

I tried to use MILDRED, but I don't know if it work with a graphic card, and I don't know if it's the best way of making.

If it don't work, someone would can explain me why !!

Besides someone had already use the function of transparency under mildred?

I think you would have to make your own routine to detect a double-click.

I would simply store the itemnumber when the GTListView is clicked, then set
a timer and see if the same item is clicked again within the time period.

If it is, play the song, and if it is not, do whatever you do for a single
click on an item...

Hello,

This is a bit cheeky, but I've been taking a look at the MUI ListView stuff,
and based on the fact that I couldn't even get GT ListView's to work
properly, I'm gonna cop out and see if I can 'recruit' someone! Heheh.

What I'm after is a thingy containing two MUI ListViews. One is a storage
pool, and one is an 'active' pool. The users drag-and-drop items from the
two lists around, to disable them in the output etc. The ones in the
'active' pool being the ones that are enabled.

The users can also click on "Up", "Down", "Top" and "Bottom" buttons on the
'active' pool list, to move items about.

My program would then, when asked, read through the 'active' pool and figure
out which order to do things in. Can anyone help? Code would be great, but
failing that some handy hints would be cool! :-)

I tried looking into this a good while ago, and unfortunatly came to the
conclusion that MUI drag and drop between listviews simply isn't possible
under Blitz.

There's a an example in C in the MUI developer archive, and I don't
understand it that well...but I think that you have to build a 'wrapper'
around your two listviews, then they capture the drag/drop events and deal
with them as appropriate. Like I said though, I never figured it out.

Right. So, if I have two buttons, one to add items to the active list, one
to remove them from the active list, that'd work, right?

Now the problem. When I was trying it with GTListViews I couldn't get it
working correctly. When the items were initially added they all had the
right properties, but when I started moving them about, the values
associated with the items changed to the ones that were held by the previous
owner of that 'slot' in the list. I've not explained that too well.

Basically, if I have a list array of, say, 8 items (Dim List opts(7)), and I
store a string in each one of those items, how would I check through the
list? I know about the commands to do it (or at least I think I do) but
would that return the value in the array for that particular listviewitem,
or just return the position I'm currently at in the listview?

Cheers,
GazChap.

Because there is no such thing (officially) as a shape gadget in the OS. 
What you have to do is create a generic button gadget and supply the 
imagery yourself - normally the imagery is created by the OS from the text 
you supply.

    I've done a little example to use properly (and easely BTW) a shape

do it. There is no problem with coloured shape (more than 8 colours)
so I think that is the old Blitz lib which is bugged. I go to do

I`m trying to use the newcommandset on a new program. It uses a screen on its

least they work nicer than blitz` screen commands. Problem is there is no
shape gadget support in ncs and using blitz` gt commands for that won`t work.
I DO need shapegadgets(gadtools preferably), is there a solution for this?

Maybe I`m going to make my own custom gui. Something like "skins" in
(amiga)amp, but then on its own screen. How should I go doing this and how do
I transparantly use a fixed size screen resolution which`ll work on aga(ecs?)
AND gfx cards. I`ve got a 640-480 resolution in mind. I like ntsc hires laced
overscan best to work in. I`d like to open a screen(using ncs preferably)
which uses that ntsc resolution or similar resolution on gfx card, depending
on what system`s defaults are. The "like workbench" tag does this(I assume,
got no gfx card to test) but will use the wb resolution and making the screen
smaller won`t change that(the work space just gets smaller).

Yes, I remember Fred posting an example of how to do this to the list a long

The only way I can think of would be to open all your windows as borderless,
and then draw on your own borders and gadgets and so on.

The "like workbench" tag actually will make your screen an exact clone of
the user's WB, size, screenmode, colourdepth and all.   It's not much use if
you want a specific size-screenmode.

There is a function called, I think, "BestModeID" where you tell it the
size, mode, and depth you want, and it selects the best match available on
the user's system.  I never tried using this, but maybe David McMinn has an
example?

Another way would be to put up a ScreenMode requester, limiting it to show
only those modes available that match your specs.   There is an example how
to do this in the BeatBox2 prefs program, which is in the archive with the
BeatBox2 source.   This is done using standard OS function calls, not NCS,
but it should be compatable.

If it was sent to the list, it should be in the archives. Use the search on the 
b2k site, it should cover most of the months (although there is only a limited

I have used it before, it doesn't always gives you the best result IIRC. Better 
than nothing, though, I'll see if I can find it.

ForceNTSC

and ForcePAL to switch back. IIRC, they were full of enforcer hits, so
you're better off using the functions from the StatsFuncs.lha archive on
Aminet.

The easiest way is the commands "ForceNTSC" and "ForcePAL"  (if I remember
correctly...)

You might want to use the "NTSC" function first to see if the system already
IS in NTSC (or PAL)

Sorry for the off topic, but I'm tearing my hair out.

Does anyone have a Workbench printer driver for the Epson Stylus
printer range?   If so:
a) can I have a copy if it is PD
b) where can I get it?

I've tried the one on Aminet, but I can't get it to work :-(

Private replies please to

edgewater@shoalhaven.net.au

Thanks

The one in TurboPrint works just fine.

Does anyone else feel that the companies left that supply Amiga hardware (mainly mail order) in the UK are over charging compared to German and American prices fo 
the equivalent hardware just because they supply the Amiga software drivers with it too which are freely downlooadble from the internet/ftp sites anyway?

 Also on a purely litz issue - does ayone have a good example of a piece of code to bubble sort a database. And what's the other type of sorting method used? - I did it years ago but have forgotten since!

Quick sort is the other method, but I don't know how that works. Here's a 
bubble sort for an array (into ascending order), I can send you code for 
doing this in a list if you want.

#SOMESIZE=20
Dim blah.w(#SOMESIZE)
lastblah.w = #SOMESIZE-1
repeat
    found.w=0
    for i.w=0 To lastblah
        if blah(i) > blah(i+1)
            found = 1
            Exchange blah(i),blah(i+1)
        End if
    next
    lastblah-1
until found=0

I think that'll do it. if it fails for some reason, take out the lastblah-1 
line (which is used to shorten the search on successive loops) because I 
can never remember where the correct place for it is :)

There are a lot of sort algorithms out there such as
the alpha sort algorithm and the half-split algorithm.

There is a variation on the bubble-sort algorithm
known as the delayed-replacement algorithm which can
cut your sort times in half. In principal it works in
a similar way to the normal bubble-sort, but it only
swaps numbers at the end of a run.

Suppose you've got four numbers:

   3 7 2 6

The algorithm will look through the list for the
highest number. In this case it's 7. The algorithm
will then swap this number with the last number in the
list to give:

   3 6 2 7

Next it looks for the second highest number which is 6
and will swap this with the second last number:

   3 2 6 7

It keeps doing this until there are no more swaps.

Hope that helps.

Kinds regards,

Francis.

Doh, so simple, so little variable swapping :)

Thanks for the info. BTW, any idea where you can get the alpha and half split

Hello 

So you need to sort an array ?
First, which type of array, standard or List ?
If it's a list array, why don't you use #SortList# ?
If you really want a routine, I've got a fast Shell sort. It's quiet as fast as 'fast sort' on every array, but if the array is almost sorted, the shell sort is really the best.

Better search for qsort it's the fastest in practise even that it's
worst case scenario is O(n^2)
Heap sort is the one that have quaranteed O(nlogn), but it uses so much
memory addressing that it's not so fast as quicksort in practise.

Might I suggest "The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3, Sorting

techniques.

Was there not a Blitz library that featured a QSort?
That vaguely seems to ring a bell.

Failing that, I do some code for the quick sort
routine somewhere.

I'm not sure (never used the NASL ScreenRequest) but I think that tag sets
the minimum height for the ASLrequester itself.

To filter screenmodes, you need to use a callback hook.   David McMinn put
an example for this in Aminet/dev/basic  and it is also probably on the
Blitz2000 site.

This is also shown in the prefs program in the BeatBox2 source archive,
which you will find on my site:
http://members.nbci.com/Curt_Esser/          in the Blitz section.

if it is just simple filtering, such as with only wanting screens bigger than a 
certain height, you can use the tags like MinHeight. Like you say, it could be 
that it is the minimum height of the requester. Daniel, make suer that the y 
position of the requester + 480 is not bigger than your screen.

Or maybe nothing happens because you do not have any GFX card screenmodes set 
up with a bigger height than 480?

Sorry, can't help much more than that, I don't have access to my Amiga ATM.

Hi everybody,

I just wanted to wish you all a Merry Christmas.

James Boyd and I have decided to release the full source code for BeatBox2.

Consider it as a Christmas gift to anybody who wants it.

Even if you aren't interested in the program itself, you might like to raid
it for some of the routines.  Among other things, it shows how to:

* Automatically run the prefs program the first time your main program is
run
* Open Multiview on your program's screen (by making it a Public Screen)
* Run a separate prefs program on your program's screen
* Read RIGHT mouse-clicks on your gadgets, as well as left-clicks (without
removing the menus!)
* Avoid forcing users to copy your custom fonts into their "Fonts:"
directory

and a lot of other stuff I don't remember right now...

Also included is the source for the Prefs program, which shows how to filter
the ScreenMode requester and the Font requester to show only selections that
are usable in your program.

You can find it on my website in the Blitz section:

http://members.nbci.com/curt_esser/

And, David, if you want it, feel free to put it on Blitz2000 as well...

Well, I posted it because somebody told me it didn't work without the
capitals - I suppose it depends on your browser.  Anyway, the one with the
capitals is the correct one.

Hello, Wiremu here.

I can't get Mildred to work (again)! What am I missing? What libraries do I
need? What .res files do I need? WHAT DO I NEED?!!!

I've loaded some Mildred files in and despite me having the latest version of
it, it still packs a major wobbly. ie. tokenises commands to read '??????' yay!
Some of the library commands it has funny ideas about. AND DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT OPENING A F***ING SCREEN! It doesn't know what a viewport newtype is,
doesn't know... well it doesn't know a lot of things.

M'aider.

Besides that, things are fine. Have a Merry Xmas, and a happy new year in 199b.

What examples are you trying to load. Paul changed some of the commands in 
later versions of Mildred because he was running out of space for new 
commands. I don't think all the old demos were updated to use the latest 
version of the library, and so if they were using commands which are no 
longer in the latest version, you will get the "?????" tokens. Also, 
because he had to reduce the number of commands, I think some commands had 
their parameters changed, to include new features which used to be other 
commands. This would be why some tokens in the source look incorrect (or 
the compiler tells you they are).

You're best bet with source like this is to hope that there is an ASCII 
version. You can load this in and then at least check that all the commands 
have been recognised, and figure out why some of them have not. You'll need 
to check the parameters for the commands manually though.

> Some of the library commands it has funny ideas about. AND DON'T TALK TO ME
> ABOUT OPENING A F***ING SCREEN! It doesn't know what a viewport newtype is,

You should put blitzlibs:amigalibs.res in your resident list. If you use 
the second version of this file (AmigaLibsII.res, by Roger Beausoleil) then 
you will probably find that the reason it is complaining is that some 
newtypes in that version have underscores in their names and in the fields, 
i.e. _ViewPort. Perhaps anyway. I recommend you use the one by Fred 
Laboureur, which you can find in the NewCommandSet archive. And make sure 
the types are spelled with the correct case - viewport is different from 
ViewPort.

I'm not sure if there is a Mildred.res, although I seem to remember one. I 
can't find it anywhere, but you never know. Anyone know if there's a 
mildred.res?

You'll probably also need the updated graphics.library1 file, and the 
cybergraphics.library1 file (in the Archives/Mildred section of 
http://www.blitz-2000.redhotant.com). And then run makedeflibs, or whatever 
program you use to compile your libraries.

It doesn't matter now, the free blitz stuff which was once on it is still 
there, but the links are gone, so you'd need to remember the exact file 
names to download them. There never was any compiled versions or docs.

I've emailed Steve Matty a couple of times to clarify what the archives 
were (I'm sure there's only 4 out of 5 on the B2k site), but never got any 
response.

    Nop, Waponez II never exists :). Waponez was written in AMOS is was damn

Initialise your pointers, either by allocating memory, or not using

DEFTYPE.RastPort TempRast
DEFTYPE.RastPort TempRst2
InitRastPort_ &TempRast
etc.
