						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@netsoc.ucd.ie>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@netsoc.ucd.ie>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@host.domain", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@acc.umu.se or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

Subject: @{b}(Fwd) A message you sent has been blocked.@{ub}

Hahah, just got this from BBC about that last message I just sent. Anyone else 
getting these? I start to worry when that pseuocode is interpreted as a virus - 
perhaps the iloveyou guy /did/ create it by accident simply by sending some 
Blitz code round the net :)

------- Forwarded message follows -------
From:               Avadmin NTHLSXU01 <msg-postmaster@bbc.co.uk>

Date sent:          Thu, 25 May 2000 10:52:25 +0100

You recently sent a message with the subject: "Re: Adding GTString gadgets".

This message has been blocked because the text of the message is
nearly-identical to that of a prolific email transported virus which
recently affected the BBC. Therefore, as part of our actions against that
virus, your message hasn't been delivered to the intended recipient within
the BBC but has been quarantined and all the intended recipients notified of
this action.

The message was sent to
blitz-list@netsoc.ucd.ie

If you HAVE NOT just sent a message with a subject line of "Re: Adding
GTString gadgets" then it's likely that your machine is infected with the
virus and therefore you must perform the following steps IMMEDIATELY :-
	1) Log-off and shutdown your machine completely (as this virus runs in
the background while the machine is switched on).
	2) Please contact your normal IT support channels and report to them
that you may have a virus infection.

If you HAVE just sent a genuine message with a subject line of "Re: Adding
GTString gadgets" which you would like to be delivered normally then you
will need to slightly change the text inside the message so that it appears
differently to that text created by the virus. If you require more information
on how to do this please contact your normal IT support channels.


This e-mail, and any attachment, is confidential. If you have received it in
error, please delete it from your system, do not use or disclose the information
in any way, and notify me immediately. The contents of this message may contain
personal views which are not the views of the BBC, unless specifically stated.
------- End of forwarded message -------

I reckon the BBC are totally paranoid. I also think that media hype has made the
loveletter worm appear much worse than it really is. I don't know of anyone
who's got it. I havn't even HEARD of anyone getting it.

What I have done is looked at the source code, and it's crap. The responsability
for the loveletter virus lies with Microsoft. Who else would be stupid enough to
let a program access personal information ?

Okay, i got it about 50 times :) On Unix.. I was laughing at all the stupid

From: Tony Rolfe <edgewater@shoalhaven.net.au>
Date: 05-24-00 21:50:52
Subject: @{b}Adding GTString gadgets@{ub}

I've just hit a small problem.

I need to add a number of GT Gadgets to an existing gadget list, have
them displayed on the window and not lose the data displayed in the
existing gadgets.

Basically, I don't know which gadgets to display until the user has
entered data into one gadget.   I realise that I could break it up
into two displays, but that would be a different 'look and feel' from
the rest of the program.

Is there some sort of system call RefreshGTList_ or something similar,
or do I need to be cleverer than that?

Thanks

The actual problem is that I have an array of "possible gadgets",
which are each only valid within a given date range.    In most cases,
I know the actual date range, so I build the gadget list on the fly
and then display the GTList.

In this particular area, the user has to enter the date range.

What I'm trying to do is read the date range, add the GTStrings to the
GTList and redisplay it.    I guess DetachGTList + Attach GTList would
do it, but I'm not sure whether this would lose the already input
data.   I was rather hoping there might be a AddGadgetsToGTList
command under some alias.

Oh, well, I'll try it out and get back to you.

Hi Tony

OK. As you and James have already mentioned, DetachGTList will lose the 
contents of the gadgets. Or maybe its just Free GTList x that makes it lose the 
contents.

Anyway, you might be able to just do a DetachGTList, add the new gadgets in and 
then AttachGTList. I'm not sure how you'd go about freeing the extra gadgets by 
themselves, you'd probably need to free the whole lot.

It would probably work something like this:

; Pseudocodese
extralist.w=0    ; tells what set of extra gadgets to create
				 ; set it to 0 for only initial gadgets

Function cigl{}
	Create initial gadget list
End Function

Function extra1{}
	create one set of extra gadgets
End Function

Function extra2{}
	create another set of extra gadgets
End Function

Function extra3{}
	create final set of extra gadgets
End Function

cigl{}
select extralist
	case 1:extra1{}
	case 2:extra2{}
	case 3:extra3{}
end select

create window
attachgtlist

; main loop
while not(quit)
	waitevent
	if event=gadgetup and gadgethit=string gadget
		parse contents
		set extralist to appropriate value
		take copy of contents of all gadgets
		detachgtlist
		freegtlist
		cigl{}
		select extralist
			case 1:extra1{}
			case 2:extra2{}
			case 3:extra3{}
		end select
		restore all gadget contents
		attachgtlist
	end if
wend


for processing the events from the extra gadget lists you have two options

1) give each gadget a unique ID number

2) reuse gadget IDs, but when processing them, use a select extralist...end 
select and process the appropriate gagdet events within that for each gagdte 
list.

The best way (that I can find) is to do the following sequence

DetachGTList  ListNo
Free GTList ListNo
WBox                              to blank out the relevant part of the window
rebuild the new version of the GTList (the whole thing)
Attach GTList ListNo, WindowNo


One problem this solves is doing the whole thing more than once (if
they enter a date and then enter it again.

Hope that is of use to someone.

Another option would be to give these "optional" gadgets their own window,
but make it borderless so it looked like it was part of the first window.

Then it could have it's own separate GTlist and the contents of the first
list would never need to be altered or redrawn...

Of course this would become complicated (but not impossible) if you have
several windows open at the same time along with this one, but pretty
simple if only the one window is on the screen.  It depends on the nature
of the program, but might be an option...

Any ideas why setting something like ANIMS to zero might cause this

I've tried doing this too, with the same results...  Or, sometimes, am
instant GURU when the program ends, or even when it starts.

I'm not sure why - maybe some Blitz commands use these objects internally
without you realizing it, or quite possibly it's a bug in the shutdown,
when Blitz tries to free everything when the program ends.

I did find by trial and error that it was only certain objects that caused a
problem if set to 0, and it seemed to be safe to set everything to 1.

I found this problem as well, so I assume its a
problem  with all versions of Blitz. It is a strange
problem, but for some reason this goes away if you set
the objects to 1 instead of 0. It doesn`t seem to save
memory anyway so I would be too fussed about it.

Thats probably badly written libraries. Like you say later, some commands may 
use these objects internally but not check that they have been initialised.

It should be safe to leave them as they are. When you do a "make smallest" 
compile or create an executable Blitz will work out how much memory it needs to 
allocate for objects and use the smallest amount. You can try it by whacking 
them up, it should still use the same amount as the smaller of the two settings.

This is probably good, but it is not as good as a lot of people are
thinking I'd imagine. Even if Blitz itself uses exactly the same
commands, and I can't see that being likely for eg. GUI work, then most
of our source won't be directly transferable because we use either 3rd
party libraries or OS functions. 

Don't get me wrong, this has got to be a good thing. Just don't expect
to translate your programs over to it easily. 

I hope it doesn't suffer as many problems as the amiga version ;)

Well it doesn't even use the same commands AFAICT, so it won't the only reason
he's calling it Blitz IMHO is because he was too lazy to come up with an
original name, like say PureBasic or something :o>

Right, as if anything on the PC has less problems than it's AMiGA equal. (Okay,
so there are a few exceptions such as Photoshop and Acrobat Reader, but
remember, those where originally Macintosh applications :o>)

  The only two that are different out of 60 commands there are:
#Graphics# and #Update# .

  What I thinking, was to write a converter program- if the parameters
of the given commands are the same or similar, it should be easy-
you'll have to do one for PureBasic anyway, so just do another (assuming
the above of course).
  We'll just have to see what commands the PC one uses I suppose.

	PureBasic should be available for PC in few months too. With 100%
compatiable source code with the Amiga version (if using compatiable
commands). Most of the code is ready, and sound, windows, font, 2D graphics
and string functions are working. It's a good news to see the BlitzBasic
back on PC, it will be an (powerful) alternative to PureBasic :*).
	
		Stay tuned !

	:*). Simply as powerful as usual. I'm curious to see if the PureBasic
will be faster than Blitz :). But its should as all has been written in Pure
x86 asm, for optimum speed & compactness. BTW, PureBasic x86 exec are under
6 kb when Delphi 5 one are 187 kb :). Without to mention VB which need an
huge library...

Who is doing the x86 ASM? Not to mention having to understand the Windows API! 
I had a look at both a long time ago and never got into them. If its you Fred,

   Hum, God ? Why not :*). Yes, it'me which does all the x86 ASM stuff and
Windows API call (still in ASM :). Am I mad or what ? I know the 3 most
important ASM langage today: 680x0, PowerPC and x86. Asm Rulez ? 680x0 yes,
x86 doesn't :). About the Windows API, if you have a good doc, it's just
like the AmigaOS (more or less..). Do you know than a button (gadget) on
Windows is a.... Windows ? A bit particular but you use CreateWindowEx() to
create a combobox, a pushbutton... Strange & unoptimized :)

Windows............ Unoptimised......... NOOOOOOO??? Really? :)))))

Personally I like the way MUI lays out for you.. Windows doesn`t

Do you want a Blitz replacement on PC for games? (They don't support WinGUI
yet) Try DarkBasic! I'm using it and I'm impressed! Uses DirectX for all of
its functions, and you can create a 3D game in a day!
(http://www.darkbasic.com)

The main thing I miss from BlitzBasic, are their users.... Darkbasic forums
are infested with "I'm god, you're sucker" kind of guys... There's no other
community like Amigans!

Subject: @{b}Blitz sources@{ub}

Hi to everyone,

I made an update on my site of my program that now include its source
code.
It's a kind of ALife thinggy in which the main goal of individuals is to
produce a sound regulary, the whole system thus producing 'music'. (this
concept being very subjective :) ) The pseudo genes contain the
note/instrument/period information, so supposed to warrant constant
evolving of the music.

I always have been bored by short music constantly repeating in games,
exept may be in Cryo's Extase (in which the music was real time builded
according to events in the game)

It does use MIDI through serial port to output sound but could very
easily be modified to use samples.

http://noospot42.citeweb.net/kSite/ekrams.htm       (in english)
http://noospot42.citeweb.net/kSite/krams.htm        (en français)

I bet you'll probably have a good laugh at that code although I really
don't know... ??

I had quite a lot of problems to imagine a good design for a scheduler,
Interrupts were suggested to me on this list, but I couldn't implement
them (this thing is tough!). Using vblank int. in a little standalone
prog is ok, but as soon as I try it in the real one I get freezings and
gurus. 

Also, this prog doesn't run on UAE, I have no idea why.

Thanks

I had such a problem with newicons too, I guessed it was because of the
sprite that must be used to make them fast and transparents, but
couldn't (and still can't) figure out why *really* ?


Is there somewhere on the net a list of conflicts like those? 

If not, we could try to build one, I think some of us (including me)

I've been using Newicons since about v2, and they've never given me any
problems.  Although the OS3.5 icon system doesn't appear to like whatever
it is Blitz is doing to make AppIcons.

The problem is that some of that stuff is going to depend a lot on the
individual users setup.  It's like MCP all over again.  It works for some
people just fine, but won't for others (even on completely bare systems).

oh, bad luck then.
 
The patches that were running here where newicons v2, mcp and magic
menu,
I ended up setting an alternative system with just mcp & magicmenu for
blitz coding (accessible through a bootmenu) to solve the problem.
So it might be NI+MCP or NI+magicmenu...

Guess we'll never know :)

Hi,

As much as I'd like to do the Windows GUI thing, it's a majorly bigger
mission than it was on the Amiga.

So initially Blitz will be pretty much full-screen apps only (ie:games)

If there's enough demand, and BlitzPC is successful enough, then I'd
seriously consider GUI-izing it.

The compiler/editor window looks nice and simple, and it'd be nice to keep

It would be interesting, but since I am an Amiga developer first and
foremost; it won't affect myself personally, however, I know of plenty of
people who are crying out for a BASIC style language on the PC which is not
so full of clutter!  (Me makes no mention of Visual something of the other
;)  

One last thing, will you be able to check if a command has succeeded? :)) 
Just that sometimes with Blitz on the Amiga it is quite difficult to work
out whether something has worked out; or not.

And do you still own an Amiga? :)  Or more importantly; still use it? :)

Regards

Nick.

That would be a good mix, like Blitz has. Direct access to OS functions if 
you're up to it :)

Hmm, how about some examples of what a set of 'basic' window/gadget commands
would be. If they're basic enough, I'd consider it. My problem here is that
I don't have a lot of experience in GUI programming (anyone who's used the
original TED will verify that!), so I don't really know what people are
after.

I wouldn' bother reading up on DirectX. BlitzPC commands should be simple
enough to make sense on their own, eg:

Graphics 640,480,16
player=LoadImage( "player.bmp" )
Cls
DrawImage player,0,0
Update

> Oh, and when do we start beta (alpha?)-testing? ;)

One thing I'd quite like to do soon is get some small demo executables
together for people to test on their machines. As with anything on the PC,
compatibility is probably gonna be a larger than small problem.

Yeah, that would do (though I guess that's the hard part Mark's talking

Even a small set of GUI commands would be nice, like some basic window

I wonder a thing about tokenisation : does it work the same way ABlitz

Mine too, to start with, probably best to stick with games and then move on
to working on GUI stuff once all there are a wealth of
graphics/sounds/control
commands.

Are you planning to support force-feedback and other devices like mice with
mouse-wheels? What about 3D stuff? Not sure if you have mentioned it on the
site, cant remember, but will there be a proper system for doing easy 3D
stuff?
Would that require a lot of work? Or would it just be a case of using
DirectX?
(I have no idea how far directx goes towards doing 3D, I`m guessing
it just controls all the rendering work?)

Personally, I think a good library system is important. There were some good
ideas in the blitz library system originally, but it always seemed a bit of
a bodge
to me. Limited library numbers does not help.

What is ASM like on the PC mark (to use I mean)? From what I`ve

Is it as easy (pah) to work with?

Ah, now you're asking ;)

I just meant stuff like plain buttons, string gadgets (er, does Windoze call
these things gadgets?!), ability to create windows with various attributes
(eg. resizeable/non-resizeable, etc).

Thinking about it though, if it's not your thing, it's probably best to just
stick to what you know -- only doing GUI stuff in part would probably gain
Blitz a bad reputation, whereas if it's just geared towards games, and does
it well, no-one can complain ;)

I can shift my focus to game-type stuff, since I don't really do anything
/that/ serious ;) -- I suppose Visual Basic is the tool for utils these days
anyway

Mouse wheel support should be in already, a-la DirectInput. There are
MouseX(), MouseY() and MouseZ() functions - mousez is apparently the wheel,
but I don't have a wheeled mouse to try it with.

Force feedback is pretty low on my list at the moment. For one thing, I
don't have a force feedback joystick!

3D Stuff will not be in the first release, but is my first priority for the
second. This should actually be pretty good, as I've done a lot of 3D stuff
since the Amiga days, and have a fairly good idea of how I want to do it.

DirectX can do the transformations and rendering, but in my experience it's
a lot faster to do the transformations yourself. This is what I'll be doing,
but leave the rendering up to DirectX.

The library system in AmiBlitz was awful! The first release of Blitz will
probably not have a library system at all, because I want to spend more time
on this to get it right - probably priority 2 for the second release. One
key thing, I think, is to use an existing file format for the libs -
probably COFF .obj format. This way, you'll be able to write libs in pretty
much any language you want - Blitz included.

PC ASM is not actually all that bad - although not nearly is nice as 68K.
One thing that complicates it immensely is that many assemblers use a really
bizarre syntax, full of crap like 'assume', 'offset', 'dgroup' which are
mainly to do with 16 bit stuff.

If you're interested in getting into x86 ASM, I'd recommend having a look at
the NASM assembler, which has a very sensible, consitant syntax, and doesn't
include although the above confusion. An assembler similar to this will be
built into BlitzPC.

Subject: @{b}Bug in Lof?@{ub}

Hello,

I think I mayhave found a bug in the Lof(File#) command.

I have an MP3 that is 734900 bytes long, and I want to read the ID3 TAG info
from it. I already know that the string "TAG" is present about 128 bytes
back from the END of the file, and this starts the tag definitions.

However, I ReadFile the MP3, then get its length using Lof, FileSeek to that
position minus 128, and then read in a 3char string.

But, it didn't work. So I put in  a debug style line after the Lof to find
ou just exactly what position it was going to....

14004, not 734900.

What's going on?!?!?! :)

Catch ya later,
GazChap.

Two things: make sure your variable storing Lof is a long, and secondly,
remember that the length of the file includes position 0, so the position of
the last byte is Lof-1...

Don't know if that's any use, but something to check anyway...

Hi Gaz.

I don't know if this is applicable or not but if you're using a custom file
system such as SFS of older versions of PFS and AFS, you might have a problem
not totally different from what you're describing.

It seems that in order to make > 2GB (I think it was) partions most non-standard
filesystems use some dynamic block allocation sceme that might feck up AMiGA OS
commands.

I know that back when I was running AFS I was never able to correctly calculate
how much free space was available on my system.

Anyway, it might have something to do with this, it might not, but I thought you
might want to know. If you are using a custom file system, I suggest you try out
the code on a machine that uses FFS or SFS. If you aren't using any third party
file system you can just ignore this mail totally...

OK, thanks m8 it's working now (I made the variable a long)

I thought I'd tried it with that though, obviously I missed it out when I
was trying other vartypes :)

Now all I need is a routine that'll scan through a directory and pick out
all files with a certain extension in it, and then sort them :)

Also, anyone got any ideas why the REDDebugger crashes everytime I try and
run a program? I have to turn it off in Compiler Options now :/

If you have the examples disk from your original Blitz disks/CD then there's a

Make sure it's the latest version, the one from BSS needs a patch too. Try re-
installing it as well, cos they cludged the debugger program that gets run by 
Blitz to run the actual debugger program. Perhaps the cludge program has got 
screwed? I think you also need reqtools.library and some others - which the 
installation doesn't do for you :(

Cool, thanks. There isn't a sort routine as well is there? ;) I'm gonna be

Title. Any ideas how? I'm crap at bubble-sorting and shit, despite how many

I always read the file and insert into the required order as I go.   
No point in inventing a major sort routine unless you need to sort by
different keys according to user whim.

Dave Newton's DLL routines include a sort function so if you were to
load them into DLL Lists it would all be there.

I sometimes had this problem if I had VisualPrefs

any problems since then.

Bubble-sorting is actually quite easy. Do something
like this:

1. Make an array of your data, e.g. 'artist$(maxnum)'
2. Repeat
3.    change_made=FALSE
3.    For i=1 to maxnum-1
4.       If artist$(i)>artist$(i+1)   ; change the >
to
5.          temp$=artist$(i)          ; a < if you
want
6.          artist$(i)=artist$(i+1)   ; it in
descending
7.          artist$(i+1)=temp$        ; order
8.          change_made=TRUE
9.       End if
10.   Next
11.Until change_made=FALSE

By doing this you cause 'higher' letters to be swapped
with 'lower' letters (e.g. 'H' being a 'higher' letter
than 'G') which is further along in the array. This
keeps on going withing the FOR...NEXT loop. If no more
changes can be made the routine exits from the
REPEAT...UNTIL loop.

If you want more (or perhaps I should say clearer)
info on bubble-sorts let me know.

I hope that helps.

Kind regards,

Francis.

I don't use VisualPrefs :///// God knows what the problem is then, but its

have you tried reinstalling the debugger yet?

or running a virus checker over the bugger?

perhaps removing some system patches?

Have you tried not f*cking with the system? :)
Perhaps somewhere you accidentally write over the memory used by the debugger,
which then doesn't know what to do, and the debugger, not your programs causes
the crash?

Have you tried running Enforcer?    Most of my mre spectacular crashes
are due to shoving data into sensitive bits of memory.     I had one
yesterday where I poked a string into the stack rather than into the
address contained in the stack.      Bye Bye.

I might try running Enforcer, but I can't remember the command line to stop
it flashing the LED, because IIRC the Debugger f*cks with memory all the
time, in it's nature. This (also, IIRC) makes Enforcer go crazy, slowing the
whole system down?

Are you running a purely 'clean' system? In other
words are you running without any patches/hacks etc.
e.g. MCP, MultiCX, OxyPatcher, etc..? If not then try
disabling them to see if that cures your problem.

Sometimes enabling certain caches on the '040 or '060
can cause some programs to crash.

Try running SnoopDos and monitor all the system events
to see if you can trace what's causing your machine to
crash.

Kind regards,

Francis.

P.S. I'll get that bubble-sort stuff organised for you
soon. I'm a tad busy with college stuff at the moment,
otherwise I would have had it prepared earlier for you.

Nop,e I'm running a completely clean system. I very rarely boot my Amiga
into its DOpus Magellan 2 environment ;) I seem to prefer the CLI from "Boot
with no Starup-Sequence" for some reason.

Yeah, that would be logical. I'll have to see if there is any difference
when I disable certain cahces.

I've tried that, and SnoopDos doesn't register anything from wht I can tell.
I'll give it anoher shot though, 'cos SnoopDos plays up quite a lot on me
now for some unknown reason. Maybe I'll install Scout...

Simple, just check to see if the items are the same before you sort them, if
they are you check the secondary field. If they be different, then sort them as
normal.

I'm glad that you found that helpful. I wasn't sure if
I had made it clear enough to understand.

What do you mean by a secondary sort? Are you talking
about having two array lists (like a table), e.g.:

   Table 1  ¦ Table 2
   ------------------
	  1     ¦    3
	  3     ¦    2
	etc..

If that's the case you could just use an array like
myArray(x,y) and then sort the x and then sort the y
making sure that if you are sorting by the x that you
swap both the array variables (x & y) and not just the
x and then do the same with the y.

If that's not what you're looking then let me know.

Kind regards,

Francis.

:) it was great thanks. It didn't work at first but I traced that back to
the fact that the MUI shit wasn't working properly. It works fine now ;)

I mean like, say you have four songs by the same artist, e.g.

Chemical Brothers: Hey Boy Hey Girl
Chemical Brothers: Under The Influence
Chemical Brothers: Music - Response
Chemical Brothers: Out Of Control

Now that I have the artists in alpha. order, I would like the titles in
alpha. order too, for each artist.

Sorry for not replying earlier, but I've just had my
appendix removed and I only got back from the hospital
yesterday.

What you could do it is have an array (or two, if you
want) and check the artist's name (after the inital
sort) and make a note of the range that that
particular artist comes at in the array. E.g.


	Array position            Array contents
	==============            ===============
	1                         Blur
	2                         Chemical Bros
	3                         Chemical Bros
	4                         Duran Duran

So you would have a start position of 2 and an end
position of 3. Next you would do your bubble sort for
the song title array, but only in the range of 2 to 3
instead of everything in the array.

I hope that helps

Kind regards,

Francis.

Alternatively, with many sort algorythms, things with the same sort
key stay in the original order when sorted.    In this case, do a sort
on the least significant key first, then work up to the most
important.    In your case, sort on Title first, then Artist.    

I don't know whether this will work with the particular sort used by
Blitz, but it won't take too long to try it out.

Well I have tried various methods of doing it, all ones which I thought up,
and none of them worked. But then I just did the exact same sort procedure
as for the Artist, but for the Title, straight after the Artist sort had
finished. And now it works. THe result is on aminet.

/util/misc/mp3-2-html.lha

Now all I need is a recursive scanner. I came up with the idea of scanning
through, counting the number of subdirs, and storing an array of those
subdirs. Then just scanning through the subdirs using the normal routine.
Would this work? I don't see any reason why it wouldn't, but I ain't got
time to try it at the moment.

Catch ya later,

It WOULD work, but imagine how much memory it would absord if someone
had 15 directories each with 15 subdirs each witch 15 subdirs etc.

If you do it recursively there's only an entry on the stack for each subdir
you enter, instead of a whole array. Just make sure you set your stack to be
large enough for people with (absurdly) large directory structures..

Yes, it would work, but if you're checking the entire contents of a directory 
tree, then you'd need to add each directory in each subdir to the list of 
directories to be scanned and it might end up a bit messy. The best option is a 
recursive scan, really :)

It's a fair point ;) And there is always gonna be someone out there with an
absurd directory structure, it's an unwritten law of the land! I have a

being nice and organised like me, and having them neatly named and stored in
one place, i.e.

AlanisMorrissette_ThankYou.MP3
Yomanda_Sunshine.MP3

etc., he leaves their filenames as he downloads them, and leaves them in the
same place that it downloads. Filenames like this are not uncommon...

yomanda_---_versus_sylvester_-_mighty_real_synth_and_strings_white_label_bootleg1.mp3

my mail program will probably wrap that around, but you get the idea ;)

So, anyone offer any more advice on a recursive directory scan? I'm still
puzzled as to why the mydir2.bb program don't do it properly. I'm sure the
first time I ran it, it did. Now it doesn't. very strange.

Catch ya later,
GazChap.

could you get me the source code to that, in ascii? I haven't got an amiga
to use at the moment, but i can take a look at the code and see if i can find

To make you feel better.

IBM have a program on their MVS (and predecessor OS's all the way back
to the early sixties) systems called IEFBR14 (Don't ask!).

This simply exists because all job steps in IBM JCL have to execute a
program.    The code is simply a return to the caller (RTS in our
terms) which in IBM ASM is    "Branch to the address in R14" or 
" BR   14".

The original version of this program ran for about 10 years until they
realised that it had a BUG!

It didn't set the return code to success and so some JCL strings
started crashing out when a change was made to the underlying OS call.

They had to add a "SR 15,15" instruction to clear Reg 15 before
returning thereby doubling the size of the executable!

So don't worry, if IBM can screw up a one instruction program, what
hope is there for the rest of us??

That algorithm should work, and it's simplier than
what I had suggested (and very probably faster as
well).

For all those looking for true recursive directory scanning, take a browse
at the following source:

And before any of you moan about the use of Goto, it is an absolute
requirement for this kind of routine. In order to make it truely recursive,
the routine has to call itself to go into subdirs, and then returning from
it, although still in itself, steps it up a directory. The source isn't very
well commented, but you'll get the jist of it.

	Is there any command in Blitz that do the same as pressing screen gadget
in right up corner of screen (to switch between others screens)??? I don't
use this gadget, but I want to append this function to my program.

Assuming you have a Blitz screen (eg from FindScreen 0) and want to send it
to the back:

Set up a pointer to your screen:

FindScreen 0,"Workbench"
*scr.Screen=Peek.l(Addr Screen (0))

Put it to the back:

ScreenToBack_ *scr

Or to the front:

ScreenToFront_ *scr

This is all from memory, but I think it'll work.

And alternative would be to use the BRexx commands to record the position of
the pointer,
move it to the top-right of the screen (AbsMouse), then do a button-press
(can't remember!), then move the pointer back where it was...

It's difficult to say because I have never done this.  I think you made need
to close and re-open, rarther like Workbench.

I'd do something like:

Grab Screen Structure
Close Screen
Change values in Screen\Font
Re open screen.

This code is probably wrong because I thing OpenScreen_ needs a NewScreen structure;
not just a Screen structure... :(

--

*scr.Screen=Peek.l(Addr Screen (0)) ; where 0 is the id of the screen you are
fiddling with :)

If *scr
 ; if it's really there
 CloseScreen_ *scr
 font_name$="times.font"
 size.b=13
 *scr\Font\ta_Name=&font_name$
 *scr\Font\ta_YSize=size
 OpenScreen_ *scr
EndIf

--

Like I say, I'm pretty sure that OpenScreen and CloseScreen need a NewScreen
structure, from the old 1.2/1.3 days ;).  Your best bet is to try it, if it
crashes, define a newscreen structure, and copy the values from the Screeen
structure to the NewScreen structure etc.

Hope this helps.  I'm pretty sure that changing the values in the screen structure
would either do nothing until closing it and re-opening it; or it will make
menus look weird or something, just try it is all I say :)

All the best,

Nick.

You could try using Blockscroll as you can specify to copy from 1 bitmap to 
another. This would save 1 copy operation the way you are doing it (1 copy to 
grab the shape and 1 copy to draw the shape).

I don't know about this, but I was getting errors last night when I tried to 
copy a cludged bitmap. It didn't say it didn't exist, just that it couldn't do 
it :(

Check the bitmap object from the debugger menu and check that it has pointers 
and sizes set up correctly. Again, you could also try using the Blockscroll 
command.

Yes. If you open your screen with one of the "tags" type commands, then you can 
specify #SA_Quiet as the tag and true as the data and the screen will be opened 
without a titlebar or depth gadget. I think.

When you click on the WB screen somewhere, your window should be de-activated. 
If you are using IDCMP to get keypresses (which would be the best way) then you 
should not get these messages any more.

Another way would be to check for the #IDCMP_INACTIVEWINDOW IDCMP message, and 
if you get that then your window is not the active one any more and you can 
ignore all inputs. This would also allow you to use non-IDCMP messages for 
input as you could ignore them when your window is inactive.

To restart your program, check for the #IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW message.

Hello...

	I'm writting a disk magazine and I have few techical
questions. What is the best way to speedup writting text into a
window (one line has 40 or 80 characters, it depens of that if the
article has one or two columns)??? To show text I'm doing something like
this. I have two bitmaps. On first (which is behind the other) I'm
writting text (in window) and blitting shapes, then I'm copying the square
(640x184) to the second bitmap (which is in front). The copy process is
doing in that way. I get a shape (640x8) from bitmap 0 and blit it in
bitmap 1 (the visable one). I do that until y position of blitting shape
reach 196 (+/-). Hmm... is there any faster way to do that (change this
square)??? Another thing. To create first bitmap I'm using
CludgeBitmap. And whan I want to copy this bitmap to then second one, the
debbuger shows error that the source bitmap doesn't exist. Why???  What's

	I have another problem. On screen is a picture and in right-up
corner it has depth gadget to change screens. I wonder, if the standart

so far. Any way. Now when I opened a screen (640x256) I'm opening a window
(640x256 too) to shows text. And two bitmaps (640x256). The original
screen depth gadget is hide by the window. I make a zone in right up

command. but there is one main problem. The task of my programm is still
active :(( So even when I'm click on the WB screen (and it becomes the

One thing you can do is something like this:

	active.l = ActiveScreen
	scraddy.l=Peek.l(Addr Screen(#scrnnr))
	if ( active = scraddy)
		...
		screen is active, do something, check for keys pressed, change
textpage etc
		..
	else
		...
		screen is not active, do a freeze, maybe a delay() etc
		...
	endif

Are you using the OS, or is it a Blitz-mode program? WaitEvent() and Event()
are quite nice calls. Also, remember there are a lot of gfxboard users out
there.

Well, I did a diskmag that works both for AGA and RTG. Msg me in private if
you need more information or suggestions/help about this matter.

Not a clue, as I have never been able to get Mildred stuff to work on my
system - maybe it doesn't like NTSC displays, or more likely I'm doing
something wrong.

But I do have an 030/50, and I will be happy to test any example code you'd

BTW, as I understood it, an 030/50 is not recommended for Mildred stuff
anyway?

The CrossFade and NetBlaster binaries both use Mildred AFAIR. They also work

No, I'm using Mildred on my A4k 030/25 mhz and it works fine. Especialy

Subject: @{b}Copper for bending the screen@{ub}

Hello, Wiremu here.

How do you use the copper routines to bend the screen, instead of using 
DisplayScroll(?) I mean using CWait or that mki$($120)+blahablah...

I want to scroll two parts of one playfield.

Hi Wiremu

Most of my explanation will only be valid for AGA, with <AGA you only get 
fetchmode 0 and the lower 8 bits of the BPLCON1 register.

All displayscroll does is set new delay values (BPLCON1) and bitplane modulus 
(BPLxMOD). It sets the modulus before the end of the current line so that the 
next line is fetched from an address which is not directly "under" (in bitmap 
pixel terms) the previous line. The delay is also done before the end of the 
line so that the next line is shifted by a number of pixels to the right.

The distance you can shift pixels with BPLCON1 depends on the fetchmode and 
resolution of your copperlist. Its a really screwy system.

Fetchmode  Number of SHires pixels that can be shifted by
0          64
1          128  \  there's something else strange about these two fmodes
2          128  /  but I can't remember what. maybe they use different bits
3          256     from BPLCON1 or something.

But you have to remember that to shift 1 full pixel in lowres, you need to 
shift by 4 shires pixels and for 1 pixel in hires it is 2 shires pixels.

Not only that, but the format of the BPLCON1 register is this:
 
 +------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------+
 | BIT# | BPLCON1 | DESCRIPTION                                             |

 +------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------+

The lower 8 bits (7-0) are lowres pixel shifts for playfield 1 and playfield 2, 
giving you a possible number of 16 different shift positions. The xH1 and xH0 
bits give you the four possible SHires pixels shifts within one lowres pixel 
position and the xH7 and xH6 bits give you the extra range (64 or 32 pixels) 
for the higher fetchmodes.

If you only have a single playfield, the values for both playfields should be 
the same (in both BPLCON1 and BPLxMOD), unless you want some strange bitplane 
splitting effects.

An alternative would be to set new bitplane pointers, although that might screw 
up the current line as it is being displayed and you may not be able to set all 
the pointers fast enough (would require 16 copper MOVE instructions for an 8 
plane screen).

> I want to scroll two parts of one playfield.

Well, if the two parts are arranged vertically (i.e. you want to scroll the top 
and bottom parts of the playfield) then that should be fairly easy.

You would just set the different modulos at the different lines, something like 
this:

COP$=mki$(#BPLCON1)+mki$(shift value)
COP$+mki$(#BPLMOD1)+mki$(new line modulues)
COP$+mki$(#BPLMOD2)+mki$(new line modulues)

COP2$=mki$(#BPLCON1)+mki$(shift value)
COP2$+mki$(#BPLMOD1)+mki$(new line modulues)
COP2$+mki$(#BPLMOD2)+mki$(new line modulues)

DisplayUser coplist,COP$,yline
DisplayUser coplist,COP2$,yline

I think in my case it was some code I had written not freeing memory properly, 
and perhaps freeing it twice. What's your code doing? Use any obscure/dodgy 
libs?

Did it work on UAE and now you are running on a real Amiga? Or perhaps vice-
versa?

Actually, having sent that mail, it seems that if I make an executable out
of the program a few times instead of running from the editor, then run from
the editor, it works fine.

Nope. Basically, it's doing a lot of messing about with GTLists, attaching,
detaching several times (the user can add and remove gadgets from the
window, you see). I guess it could quite easily be some sort of memory
freeing problem.

Not tried it on UAE, so no. I would, but it's so unbelievably slow here,
that it's not really worth it :) (slow PC :)

Using my dodgy updated gtlib? Anyone else had problems with it?

I remember what caused my problem like that before: i had written some routines 
for plotting pixels, which ended up getting plotted in random places in memory 
:)

But don;t worry, that routine isn;t in the gtlib :)

I wasn't thinking too much about it at the time. I never use GZZ windows, so 
when I was doing the code I ws thinking more like "add the window borders or 
not". So in my case the On represented adding the window borders. Never thought 
about it as showing whether the GZZ flag of the window was open.

Sorry, just to annoy you even more I'll fix that problem :)

I've had a few GT related problems in the past. Most
of  them were down to VisualPrefs, and getting rid of
that was a help. 

Lots of them though were like your problem.
It seemed to fix things when I used the GTdetach
command before freeing a GT list.

Have you given that a go? Just a thought.

I've just put another hard disk in, and I'm without Visual Prefs at the

You need to assign it to another string, or arrange to have it in memory
somewhere and then use *name.b to point to it. If you just do *name.b="ARSE!"
then it will work, but it just uses temporary memory so next time you use a
string you'll lose it.

i.e. use:
jack$="ARSE!"
*name.b=&jack$

Poke.s &variable, "String" (or String$)

Can't use *Name.b coz you can't have pointer to byte.
You need to have pointer to Newtype containing byte

Okay, I'll explain what it is.  MUI provides built-in functions for ARexx. 
But to use it, you need to tell MUI what commands you want to accept.  You
do this by using the MUI_Commands structure, which looks like:

Newtype .MUI_Command
  *mc_Name.b
  *mc_Template.b
  mc_Parameters.l
  *mc_Hook.b
  mc_Reserved.l[5]
End Newtype

I'm using the following code to add an ARexx command:

Dim arexx.MUI_Command(1)
arexx(0)\mc_Name=&msg_connect$,#MC_TEMPLATE_ID,MUIObjLoc(#CONNECT),0
arexx(1)\mc_Name=0,0,0,0
MUISet #APP,#MUIA_Application_Commands,&arexx

The second line, should cause a "connect" command to be created, that when
called will return #CONNECT through the usual MUIEvent/MUIWaitEvent.

However, the list of commands returned by the program, merely contains a
blank line where it should say "CONNECT". Leaving the code out, results in
no blank line...but no command either :/

It's probably something I'm doing wrong...but I just don't know...

PS: You get an MUI applications list of commands by sending a "HELP
RAM:COMMANDS.TXT", it'll create a file, RAM:COMMANDS.TXT containing the
list.

Hmm devices are strange, i remember having trouble with devices...

I tried this once, it was not very handy (this is pseudocode, I couldn't save
		the original for obvious reasons):

dev=GetDevice("input.device");
KillDevice(dev);

The problem was, that obviously there was no more input i could give the 
amiga :). The bigger problem was that kicking the device back up didn't seem
to work properly.. Maybe they've patched it after 2 years, but i doubt it..

Subject: @{b}dualplayfield screens@{ub}

I'm trying to create a screen which will have a dualplayfield with both fields
being different sizes and have different colour bases (both 16 colours). Both
playfields will be scrolled independantly, but so far I'm just trying to scroll
the front.

I've looked at the RKRM example and it shows creating a screen normally for the
front playfield and then adding a second playfield to it afterwards. This is
what I've tried to do, but it doesn't seem to be working properly, as when I
scroll the front playfield sideways the rear playfield jumps to the left and the
right every 16 pixels or so (works fine with UAE in case anyone will try it on
that, but not a real Amiga).

Perhaps a problem with the fetch mode of the display?

Could anyone have a look at the code and tell me where I'm going wrong?

Use intuition.library EasyRequestArgs:

title$="Information"
body$="This is some info."+chr$(10)+"That cool by you?"
gadget$="Yes|No"

DEFTYPE.EasyStruct es
es\es_StructSize = sizeof.EasyStruct
es\es_Flags=0
es\es_Title=&title$
es\es_TextFormat=&body$
es\es_GadgetFormat=&gadget$
gadgetnum.l = EasyRequestArgs_(Peek.l(Addr Window(0)), &es, 0, 0)

The text can be a lot more flexible than this, see the autodocs. You can use it 
like printf from C or RawDoFmt from exec.library. The second 0 in the lib call 
is the same as the arguments after the format string in printf.

Also, that first 0 in the EasyRequestArgs call can be a pointer to a longword 
which holds the IDCMP flags that should cause the requester to quit.

From: Simon Smith <simonisfound@yahoo.co.uk>

Subject: @{b}FTPeeing@{ub}

Hello, Simon here, still I'm struggling with the
FTPeeing of programs to aminet. I read a book on
internet protocols, and what the hell a File Transfer
Protocol is. All I got was some DEEPLY EXCITING
information on TCP/IP.

I'm curious to know what address do you guys usually
use, and is thier certain times of day when the aminet
is not on-line. I usually try between 1:00pm and
2:00pm BST, and the program says. "Contacting host"
and then gives up and retries after 10 seconds. Then
it keeps trying but I get no joy at all. It just says
the host won't respond.

I know it's a bit off topic, but can anyone help.

I've tried using the UK and US ftp sites.

try "de.aminet.net" (the German, and main Aminet site). You can also use 
"ftp.uni-paderborn.de" to access that site. All the major mirrors are online 
24/7 normally, unless they die, which they've been doing quite a bit in the 
last couple of months.

Maybe you've set the timeout in your FTP software too low so that the software 
thinks it cannot reach the host, even though it is because it is just slow and 
didn't respond in time.

The german site is recommended for European users to upload to and the US site 
for US users.

> I know it's a bit off topic, but can anyone help.

Its not off-topic if you're uploading Blitz stuff :)

The "main" aminet site got moved back to us.aminet.net about 4 weeks ago,
when paderborn died, it's only been back up this last week.

Hi Simon,

This is most likely because of a proxy or firewall problem.

You can fix it by making a Rebol/Perl/PHP/whatever gateway between http: and
ftp: and uploading it to your ISP. You might be able to get arround it that way.
Then again, maybe not.

Sounds like a firewall, ask your network administrator for SOCKS details and
then plonk them into your FTP software.

None that I know - the GTMX will report only gadget-down.
As I recall, the GTListView works the same way too, although I'm not sure
about that...

But wouldn't you get a GadgetUp from the string no matter what kind of other
gadget was pressed, since that would cause the string to be automatically
de-activated first?

I can think of a possible solution, but it would require a lot of
trial-and-error (and might not work) by storing all the quequed events in a
list before processing any of them, then looking to see what you have
first...

Can you post a small example of what you are doing?  

Later...

I've fixed the GTMX problem where clicking on the GTMX gadget caused a
gadgetup message on the active string gadget.

The problem was that I had set the immediate flag on all my string
gadgets (with a view to using the gadget down event to allow a
context-sensitive help system).    Taking this away fixed the
problem!

gtmx gadgets only produce gadgetdown messages. you can't avoid the gadgetups
from the string gadget either.

Erm, its only for creating your own custom class dispatcher hooks..
Have you not seen the Class1.BB2 file or whatever it is with the
latest EFMUILib that I posted the URL for ages ago?

Maybe it will help I dont know, but I converted the Class1.c program
to Blitz. It uses the custom class dispatcher command.

Sorry for not saying anything earlier, my Amiga is dead.

Looks like I might start programming in DarkBasic.. It look AWESOME!

Have fun..

It must be something with the RED Debugger then 'cos I turned it off in

--- Forwarded message follows ---


Hello! 

Okay, Im new to this list but not new to blitz programming, I am however
having a bit of trouble with NCS1.90.

Background: I am working on developing a StartBar type program thingy. I
have completed an Acidlibs version (huge filesize, few features missing)
and would now like to convert it to NCS.

Most of the procedures are working but I am having a few problems...

1) IDCMP mouse movements are notified automatically with Acidlibs, but with
NCS, even though I have #IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE and #IDCMP_REPORTMOUSE and
#IDCMP_INTUITICKS set. I only get the and mousemove event once. I have
tried messing with SetMouseQueue_ but this has only a limited effect. How
do you get infinite mouse mouvements reported? Any Ideas?

2) I would like to implement a real-time clock on the StartBar but my
programs mainloop is based on NWaitWindowEvent, how would I get an 1-second
interreupt to update clock without making the program really CPU-hungry?

If you can help it will be much appreciated. Thankyou

Steve

Subject: @{b}New Command Set :-( (aaarrrggggh)@{ub}

Please help...

If you open a window with the blitz libraries and set the IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE
and IDCMP_INTUITICKS, then do a repeat, waitevent, forever loop, you will
get mouse reports continually... great... but...

If you do the same thing using 'New Command Set', you will only get 2 mouse
move messages ever. You can solve this by using a SetMouseQueue_ command
but you have to supply a maximum amount of mouse events to store. i.e
SetMouseQueue_ 255, but what use is this?

Does anyone know wether this is a bug in the 'New Command Set' libraries or
maybe the SetMouseQueue_ command and/or does anyone know of a workaround or
solution?

Please help, Its driving me mad!

Stevie.

SetMouseQueue_ tells intuition how many mouse move events (maximum) you want in 
your queue of window events *waiting* to be processed. So if you have 5 mouse 
move events that you have not done anything with (i.e. you're doing something 
processor intensive and you haven't reached the waitevent command before 5 
mousemoves have been sent) then intuition will not send you any more until you 
take some out of the queue, with a (wait)event type command.

> Does anyone know wether this is a bug in the 'New Command Set' libraries or

I think its a bug in the NCS. I tried opening an NCS window and then using the 
OS commands to process the messages, and it still only gave me 5 mousemoves. 
Changing to opening the window with OS commands gives the correct response - 
mousemoves until you quit.

I don't know any workaround, I thought using OS commands for processing the 
messages would have helped, but it seems not.

Hi Fred

>     This is very strange.

Yes, it is, especially since the OS will always give you mouse move events if 
the queue is has not already reached the maximum. Even when I do the processing 
of the events (uses no NCS commands at all, only OS commands) the queue still 
seems to have the mouse move events stuck there. None of the IDCMP flags gets 
turned off, and the window flags are still the same as when it was reporting 
mouse moves.

ChangeIDCMP doesn't exist, but you can use ModifyIDCMP_ instead.

I don't think it is IDCMP related, as the mouse move events are being reported 
(which is what is wanted), but they stop after the number of mouse moves events 
reaches the limit set by WA_MouseQueue (or SetMouseQueue_). They should not 
stop completely, they should continue after the queue has been dealt with.

Attached is the code I've been using. Set the two constants at the top to 0 for 
the NCS only example and set them to 1 for an OS only example.

	This is very strange. Probably an IDCMP is set by default and shouldn't.
If there is a command called 'ChangeIDCMP()' in the NCS, then use it at it
will change the defautl IDCMP for the window, else no way. Sorry..

Subject: @{b}Newtypes@{ub}

Hi,

I've got a file which declares various newtypes and creates various linked
lists using these newtypes. The file looks a bit like this

-------- types.bb2 ---------

NEWTYPE.set
	blah.s
End NEWTYPE
Dim List settings.set(1) : ResetList settings() : AddItem settings()

NEWTYPE.eve
	blah.s
End NEWTYPE
Dim List ev.eve(1) : ResetList ev() : AddItem ev()

NEWTYPE.comm
	blah.s
End NEWTYPE
Dim List comm.comm(1) : ResetList comm() : AddItem comm()

------------------------------

I Xinclude this file into a program I'm writing. What I want to know, is why
the following works, but the bit after it doesn't.

---------
settings(0)\blah = set_name$
ev(0)\blah = ev_click$

The above works fine. The following line gives the error 'Array not yet
dimmed')

comm(0)\blah = com_name$
----------

And I can't figure out why. Any ideas?

Try naming your list as something other than it's extension. ie:

Just a guess ;)

I've mentioned that my program is taking over six minutes to compile. 
This is not enough time to do much, but far too long to stare blankly
at the screen.

Can anyone recommend a one-player game which has low CPU usage,
doesn't take over the machine and is not time critical.    In short
something to while away the compile time.

Thanks

Hi Tony,

I use SameGame, which is a nice logical wbgame, fully done in asm : the
exe is 8Ko!

It's a clone of ksame/same gnome/etc... but the amiga version is the
best, due to it's size, memory needs and speed :)
It's been coded on a 500 originally, and the last update was two weeks
ago or so  (v2.4)

You'll find it on aminet

The problem with Tetris (and minesweeper) is that it is time critical.
In other words, you can't just leave it and come back.   Although some
do have an auto-pause feature when the screens swap over.    Also, the
versions I've got do slow the compile down quite a bit.    

I'm using a card game called Montana which is a sort of patience
thingy, but gets boring after a while.

Thanks for the help though.

Its a financial management package for small to medium sized motels,
B&B's etc.

The executable is about 640K at the moment (and growing).
The source is held in over 300 includes (varying from 100 to 30,000
bytes) and takes up about 2500 blocks on disk.   1.2 Meg???

It's been 5 years in the making and I'm actually using it for running
my motel.    There's no chance of it being released commercially since
I simply don't have time to support it. (or document it).    But if
someone wants to buy the rights :-)

Thanks for the game thoughts

Umm.. Megaball.. dunno if it's on Aminet?? It is shareware though.. Arkanoid
but it is OS friendly and if you flip from the Megaball screen to another
the game automatically pauses!!

That WBtris game I was on about had a pause function.
I was remembering some old text adventures though. If
you're into something a bit cerebral see if you can
get a hold of the lost treasures of Infocom. There was
some good stuff on that, and no pause key is need.
Plus there is zero CPU use until you press return.

Actually if you like card games, you might check it out.  Although the
sounds and music might slow down your compile time, you can turn them both
off.

And it does multi-task, and pause when you switch screens...

And you might find it less boring than solitare, as you are playing against
a semi-intelligent computer opponent.

It's on my web page, and Aminet/games/think

I'll give it a try.

Thanks for all the suggestions.

I LOVE Mini-Arcanoid, but it does slow things dowbn by 50%.   
SameGame is just what I was looking for.   Interesting enough, without
any noticeable slow-down.

Thanks again...

I've been using that, but when I switched on Enforcer to help debug my

Maybe there's a newer version or something?

I did that (AFCD151 - the very last one) and VCII still does the

Never noticed that before. And I don't have the code here to check. All the 
variables that are used for the scan (directory lock, fileinfoblock, etc) 
should be local to the function, not global variables that have been shared.

You could also have a look at the directory scanning source in my dir2html 
program (http://de.aminet.net/aminetbin/find?dir2html). It does recursive scans 
and it works :)

I wouldn't say shitloads, just one function :) Besides, the ASM is for bubble 
sorting :)

The directory scanning is in the createindex function (which gets called 
recursively if you select to scann all subdirs), but now that you mention it, 
it probably is OTT for an example of recursive directory scanning.

It is in there, hidden under all the crap for sorting out whether you are 
saving to one file or not, and doing the HTML crap. I can extract the dir 
scanning code if you want?

Hell, yeah, way OTT :)

Thanks. I've had a brief look at it and it does appear to be easier to
follow. You and Ralf Berkvens have helped me figure  out why mydir2.bb 
wasn't working. The DEFTYPE .FileInfoBlock bit was outside of the statement
instead of inside it ;)

Have you tried connecting to your REAL IP?
Cos the easy way to get around this would be to check if the user enters
127.0.0.1 or LOCALHOST and then get the real ip with TCPGetOwnHostID()
or whatever its called :)... Provided it works with your IP?

I`ll probably update it soon with the accept, bind, etc highlevel commands
soon.
Maybe. :)

Hi Rob,

>How many of you are using this library?

I am :)  And very good it is too!  I have been working on that e-mail client
which I detailed; but I am still brushing up the basic examples, so that can
be released to those who showed an interest.   Sorry for the delay!

However; the emphasis has changed slightly on the package, in that it is more
than just a single E-Mail client.  It is, in fact, my A-Level Computer Science
project; but I am still releasing it to the Amiga community.

All I can say is that it's an E-Mail 'kernel' and it can handle any skin of
any type; of any structure.  The functions handled by the 'kernel' are minimal
POP/IMAP4/SMTP access and Encoding/Decoding of UUencode and Base64.  It will
use ARexx to communicate to the 'kernel'.  The actual client itself will manage
the e-mail storage, folders, searching, configuration - in other words all the
TCP and Attachments stuff is done by the 'kernel' and the E-Mail application
does /everything/ else.

That's the jist of it.  The aim is to squeeze the kernel into a tiny file size
of about 50Kb and the RAM requirements to 100Kb.  Hopefully. :))  It'll be a
mixture of Blitz and 68K Assembler...

All the best,

Nick Lamburn.

Nope, and I'll tell you why.  You have two interfaces, one is your
"loopback" address and one is your "actual" address.  In the standard
Miami, that's your "lo0" and "mi0" interfaces.  When you connect to the
internet, the TCP/IP stack detects that the address isn't on your machine,
and goes to the external interface (mi0)....when you connect to either your
own mi0 address or the loopback address, it treats them both as loopback
addresses.  It never looks at routers, gateways or DNS servers.  So I would
expect the same result.

But that's a *nasty* way to do it :/

Anyway, if it isn't happening to anyone else, it must be something I've
installed in Blitz :/

I added PILES of stuff.. Though most of it is just crap and for the lazy
people
like me.. It was my plan to rip out the shortcut commands, the NList stuff
(the List stuff that was duplicated for NList) Because it didn`t work
properly.
And add a few notes and examples on how to use NList hooks. So it can
be done properly.. Give me a bell if you manage to figure out a way to
build NList hooks with a command.. I could never figure a way to do it..
Except actually building the hook with ASM instructions in memory
(sort of like the dispatcher hook code but much more complex).

> Anyway, I'll post the current version of the TCP library up on my homepage

There isn`t a page for it..
I just gave out the URLs here.

Though I added commands for IP grabbing, IP converting, host grabbing, etc
etc..
to V2.1 which wasn`t released, but Rick has now.. So will be good if you
could
make some additions to the docs and release V2.1? The commands I`m sure are
highlighted as added to V2.1 somewhere in the code (possibly).

Also Rick, the 2-Way chat program I did that I sent you, has a command for
setting up and binding a socket.. which I was about to convert to ASM and
then release V2.1. But never got round to it :(.. It should be easy enoug
for you
to convert. :)

Have fun.. :)

There were lots of problems.. It was mainly to do with the way hooks were
implemented into the library originally before I started "updating" it. :)

There is no real way to do hooks in the library without building them
manually, and the hook system that was used with MUIList and such
was a bodge.

Page is curretly in the process of a MASSIVE re-write. Seems no point in

Sorry there are few comments in the code. This was the first bit of ASM I
haven`t
commented, cos there was a rush to get the first version out, and it was
written in
less than a week.

There were some problems with the fuctions anyway, didn`t return correctly
because I was just fiddling and didn`t get to finish the routine properly.

If you want to report bugs etc. in these libs, send them to me and not to
Rob.  I'm not too sure what I'm going to do with the EFMUI lib yet, and
know Rob has added some stuff for custom classes to it...but I haven't even

Hi All,

Okay, say I want to use OpenWindow() from the intuition lib,
I will need to allocate a NewWindow structure; or if I used
OpenWindowTagList() I'd need a valid taglist structure.

My question: obviously a structure is actually a segment of
legally allocated memory; and each field is an offset within 
that block of memory.  

But; the only way I can see that I can allocate more than a
LONGWORD is to use Exec's AllocMem(); surely there is some
other way to allocate some memory, since this appears to be
a very clumsy way to handle this.

I did see in some docs about a command called 'blk', but I see
no reference of it being a 68K command (what's the proper
name for it, begins with m, ummmm.... :), and Blitz doesn't
recognise it.  Do I have string together loads of DC-s? :-?

Works like Dc but doesn't initiailise the memory to anything.

Of course, that'll whack it into your program, which may be OK for some things 
and not OK for others. You could use local variables in the function sense of 
the word: create some space on the stack and then use that. For example,

LINK a4,#12  ; creates 12 bytes of space on the stack
; use a4 as the local variable base, with offsets such as -2(a4)
UNLK a4      ; restore the stack to what it was

I would like my program to "know" when a system requester is opened (by any
program, including the WB itself) and also what kind of requester it is.

I'm not trying to alter the requesters or substitute other ones (like ARQ
and ReqTools do), I just want to know that one has been opened.

Anybody know how? 

Later...

Gareth Griffiths's head burst.
All we could scrape off the wall was Re: Bug in Lof?.

Couple of other things you might like to try (obscure but try anyway):

1) Don't compile using the keyboard shortcut (RAmiga-#), use the menu item

2) Use "Compile and run" instead of just "Run"

Apart from that, you tried reinstalling the debugger yet? Or checking it with a
virus checker? I know I keep harping on but you ain't said anything about those
two yet.

Bye

anyone got any examples of how this command works?

I can't seem to set or get the base color offset for the second playfield 
colors and the docs suck.

or anyone ever got this command to work? ;)

Hurrah! Thanks to everyone for the FTP advice. In the
end though I ended up relying on the kindness of
stangers. Or Roger Light to be more precise. 

He's agreed to e-mail my programs, being a decent chap
and all.

He's uploaded my ZoneED program. If you've ever had to
define zones in blitz you'll know it's a pain in the
arse.

This does it in a friendly-like way. It's free so
check it  out. Its in dev/basic in uk aminet.
