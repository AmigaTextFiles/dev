                          Blitz Mailing List Guide
                          ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@netsoc.ucd.ie>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@netsoc.ucd.ie>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@host.domain", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@acc.umu.se or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

Hello Andrew

On 04-Jan-01, you wrote:

AB> folks, I am writing a program and would like to know what is the
AB> chr$() I use to move the cursor up one line?

The easiest way is to write a small program roughly like this:

OpenWindow
InputFromWindow
OutputToWindow
Loop:
asciivalue.w=asc(inkey$)
NPrint asciivalue
Goto Loop

Then you run it, hit the key you want and use the value with Chr$().

But while I'm here, I may as well tell you that what I think you're
looking for doesn't exist.  The Up Arrow key has a value of 28 ($1C)
or 76 if you wanna use RawKey, but if you print that in a stream of
text I don't think it makes the cursor go up a line.  You'll need to
either 1) relocate the cursor by hand or 2) open a console and use
ANSI sequences.

Somebody else can help you here ;]

Kind regards

ESC [ x A  -- moves the cursor up x lines while staying in the same
column.

ESC [ x E  -- moves the cursor up x lines and puts it in column 1.

ESC [ r;c f  -- moves the cursor to row r and column c.

Say I want to print something on this line and then
print something on this line
and something on this line.
now I want to move the cursor back to the top (3 lines) and start to print
again.

Anyone?

You need to use Escape codes (assuming you're in a CLI, right? ;)

See this file for a list of escape codes
(http://us.aminet.net/pub/aminet/dev/misc/AmigaANSI.txt), and also the
TextMode function in StatsFuncs (aminet:dev/basic/StatsFuncs.lha).

The source below is an example, though you'll probably have to experiment
quite a bit to get things just how you want 'em ;)

-----------------------

NPrint "Hello"
NPrint "Above line will change in two secs!"

VWait 100

esc$ = Chr$(27) + "["        ; escape character

Print esc$ + "2A" + "Goodbye" ; 2A is an escape code for moving up 2 lines

MouseWait:End

------------------------

Note that I've just edited this in Outlook, so although it seems fine here,
I might've screwed up some minor point!

Greetings,

Does anyone know how I can get gadtools gadgets to use a font generated 
with Font Converter? I've got a few WB utilities that I'd like to use an 
internal font as a fall back if the user requested font cannot be found (and
to help keep the FONTS: drawer a bit smaller, I hate having to have hundreds
of fonts lurking around because a small utility insists one them), and before 
it's suggested I'm not going to use topaz (I just don't like it :).

I've attached an example output file from Font Converter so those not familar
with it can see what it does.

Cheers

Of course, you can hackyhackyhackhack the font into a Blitz font object.
Something along the lines of:

; Stick this in after you create the font as in the example.

*if.intuifont = Addr IntuiFont(0)
fn$ = "thinpaz8.font"
*if\_fontname = &fn$
*if\_ysize = 8
*if\_font = *thinpaz8Font

Use IntuiFont 0
GTButton ....

; Remember to clear all these fields manually (just set them to 0), so
; Blitz doesn't try to free them

Oh, and in the example code, where Ott sets the value of the font name to
something in the pointer - don't do that, assign a new string and use the
address of that (like the above). Otherwise it'll just be put into temporary string space
and overwritten later.

Actually, that might not work, I think gadtools.library just takes the
pointer to the font name and size and tries to open the font from
disk/memory. Right, what you might want to do, after hacking it into the
IntuiFont is call:

AddFont_(*thinpaz8Font)

and hope that gadtools.library tries to get the font from memory before
disk.

Once you're finished using the font (completely! - freed gadlists and
things) and perhaps before you clear the IntuiFont structure, but that
might not matter:

RemFont(*thinpaz8Font)

> internal font as a fall back if the user requested font cannot be found

Just load the font from your own directory, it's perfectly legal to
specify the full path to the font. The disadvantage of this (and including
it in your code actually) is that the fallback font will not be displayed
in the font requester. However, if you have it as a file on disk, you can
"assign add" the fonts: directory to your one so that your font will also
appear in the requester. I don't think you can do this at all if it is in
your code.

That was what the original code already had, the question was how to use

This works:

It can actually include a font into your executable...the best answer is to
make your app font-sensitive though, and use the user's chosen font.

To do it properly, you'd want to write a function which reads from the
interleaved bitmap and then writes to the shape bitmap.

But to save myself some brain effort, you could try something like this:

; this constant defines a bitmap which is free to be overwritten
; when you are grabbing the shape
#DUMMYBITMAP = 1
Statement ILGetaShape{shp.w, x.w, y.w, w.w, h.w}
    curbmp.w = Used BitMap
    InitShape shp,w,h,Depth(curbmp)
    ShapesBitMap 0,#DUMMYBITMAP

    BltBitMap_ Addr BitMap(curbmp),x,y,Addr BitMap(#DUMMYBITMAP),0,0,w,h,$C0,-1,0
    Use BitMap curbmp
End Statement

WbToScreen 0
ScreensBitMap 0,0
Use BitMap 0 ; the interleaved bitmap

ILGetaShape{0, 0, 0, 32, 32}

; whatever

This probably will not work if your workbench is more than 256 colours
(i.e. on a GFX card and using a high depth).

For some reason 'WBlit' would'nt blit if the shape had a cookie
but it work after that.

The BeatBox program on Curt Esser's site

it was reasonably robust, but then I doubt anyone actually bothered trying
to hack it :)

It might be difficult to change to your own needs though...can't really

Sorry, James - when I arc'd up the BeatBox sources, I forgot to put the
keyfile utilities in...

Anyway, I have atached them here.   I will put them on my site later.

There are two programs - one creates the keyfile (which we had the user put
into the main BeatBox2 directory).   The other one simply checks a keyfile
to make sure it is valid.

To see how the keyfile was actually read by the program, you will want the
BeatBox2 source that James mentioned, which IS on my site   :)

You can use the protracker.library which should be freely available.

Probably. Have you tried the mod player libraries for Blitz? I know 
there's the eml library and also the xbciatracker library. However, I'm 
not sure on what formats are supported by them and what library is the 
best.

Perhaps Amorel can tell you, he's an expert on that stuff :)

I think you can use EHB mode or HAM mode. But if you're going to hit the 
hardware, you should probably take a look at the Display library - it has 
proper (and full) AGA/ECS/OCS abilities.

If you say so, then who am I to deny that ;-)
But the eml library is pretty good and so is xbciatracker. The xbciatracker is

Some people "copy" other programs just as a programming exercise to see if they can achieve the same thing (I know I have in the past). In this case, it may not be a deliberate attempt to plagiarize your creation.

I suppose you could look at it as being a bit of competition for you to improve your own program so that people will use yours as opposed to someone else's.

Kind regards,

Francis.

He didn't. We were watching Hyperion's setup of an A1200 with a G-Rexx
card and two PCI graphics cards driving two monitors. I said it would be
useful to have a program to switch between monitors as the mouse reached
the edge of a screen. A couple of days later he sent me screenswitch.

Had I been carrying an Aminet index in my pocket at the WoA I'd have
checked first, but I wasn't so I didn't.

It's not the same as yours anyway. Yours switches at screen corners,
whereas Simon's switches at the sides of the screen, which is what you'd
want with a dual monitor setup. It's more like Ventriloquist's screen
switching, which was what I has in mind when suggesting it.

Perhaps Simon wanted to code a Screenswitcher just as a way of teaching
himself how to code screen structures (or whatever ;-) and then decided to
release it.

I know that's what I did with NetDOCK-2. The fact that it was full of bugs
meant that most people who hadn't already tried it, just plumped for
ToolManager ;-)

Er, there are *thousands* of programs on Aminet that "do the same thing"!!!
Having the same name is very likely a coincidence (it is kind of an obvious
choice, isn't it?)...

Not necessarily -- I've written plenty of programs that just came from
messing about with function calls, then developed into something I decided
was maybe useful. ScreenSwitch is likely what *I'd* call a program that
switched screens (assuming that's what it does)...also, people often try
something from Aminet that doesn't quite work according to their own
needs/likes, so they write their own, though in that case you would give it
a different name...

I really doubt very strongly that it was "copied"; it's just "one of those
things"...

Arnt you all forgetting the fact that, unless he has directly
taken your executable and "etched" his name in it. He technically
hasn't stolen anything. You cant copyright an idea. If the program
is entirely his own work. He is free to copy your (or whoever
came up with it first) idea as much as he likes. Legally. 
I`d be annoyed if someone beat me to an idea I just spent ages
putting into practice, or went one better, but
theres ferk all you can do about it. Except make yours better
and stop wingeing that there is a little more competition than you
first thought. :)

Just be thankful your not programming for the PC, where theres
300 different programs to do everything! And be thankful that there
are still a few ideas not thought of in the Amiga community :)
(or not as it would seem, HAHA!)

Alternatively, if it was me, and I had seen a program like your ScreenSwitch
and decided to copy the ide I would at least try to make up a distinct name
for it, ie: 'ScreenSelect' of 'RSS' (Ralf's Screen Selector). And if I make
something just as an excercise I'd never ever release it to a place like
aminet, cos my version would either be much worse, or it could do so many
other things other that switching screens (my programs always end up being
		able to play protracker modules :) that i'd have to call it something
else, like 'HyperScreenSwitcher' :) (Anyone remember HyperHelp II?)

I must say I appreciate the support in this matter, but I certainly have no
intention of stealing your program, if I may explain.

While in Cologne last year, it was an idea that was thrown around whilst
watching the Hyperion people demoing something, so when I got home I decided
to throw something together to prove my theories.

This executable was uploaded to the private section of Amigactive
contributors (in particular Neil Bothwick as he was my conversation partner)
and was intended as an internal toy.

In all honesty this is the first I have heard about it being 'released', and
I shall be taking this up with Mr Bothwick ASAP.

My appologies once again for any misleading that may have been presented
(accidentally or not).

No attempt was made to detract anyone from any creation they may have
conjured, programed or invented, in any right or royalties.

In any case, seeing as how this has caused quite a fair amount of
conversation on this list, it must be something which is quite close to your
heart.

If this is the case, wouldn't it have been better to mail me directly about
it, rather than crying about it here, on a totally unconnected list. Even
the AA list would have been better.

You can mail me directly at simon@amigactive.com if you really have to

@NODE "Mail_46" " Reaction gui input "
From: Dave Norris <dave.norris@freenet.co.uk>
Date: 01-20-01 12:21:19
Subject: @{b}Reaction gui input@{ub}

Hi,

New to this list and Blitz programming, sorry if this has been
asked a hundred times before.

I'm attempting to writing a small utility that uses a reaction
gui, I've built the gui (that was the easy part), but I'm
getting in a right mess trying to parse the input from it. :(

Inkey$() works for some parts of the input, but not others,
and it's the same for Edit$(), so I'm using a mixture. 

As I understand it, Edit$() keeps reading until the buffer is
full or an $0a, but it seems to be returning before either
in some cases, this is where it's making a mess of my parsing.

Can anybody point me to some example code to help me? 


Cheers, Dave

Did you add a Forbid_ before the End command ?
You should always do that in Blitz, as the way the 
objects are freed is not very system friendly.
For me it really solved this type of problems.

Hi,

I am using the showbitmap command to do double buffering on an intuition 
screen, using a hires 640*256*6 screen and 2 640*256*6 bitmaps. I am blitting 
using BBlit, and wanted to clip the blits when they go off the right of the 
screen, so I increased the bitmap and screen to 800*256, but when running the 
debugger says the screen and bitmap must be the same size, but they are. 
700*256 works though, is there some kind of size limit on screens/bitmaps, or 
is it because I`m using hires?

I'm sure something like this already exists for the Amiga, since this is
how people discovered the trojan datatypes.library a few years ago. But I
cannot remember what it is called.

It will probably be on Aminet though :)

don't think so :-( I checked aminet but I suppose that people have done
discovery using lan and sniffer proggy on pc.

I would like to know how to get the transaction (in tcp form) of miami or
amitcp. After get a whole chunk of tcp, I can analyze it and take the
worth data.

Could anyone please test this program, especially if you use a gfx card. And
tell me if it works ok et all, a screengrab would also be appreciated. Don`t
mention if fonts outsize gadgets(how can I use fonts anyways in newcommandset,
the nloadfont nusefont thing doesnt seem to do the trick).

The screen loads in NTSC overscan mode, but cgfx and such should promote it, I
reckon. I do load topaz for the sake of it but somehow it`s not used as I
said.

C=Loading it from the shell I get a requester with the message "Specified
C=NWindow object number isn't initialized !".

I guess it encountered an error somewhere and went to the end part where
windows and screen get freed(not really needed but I still do). Cause you
didn`t have any window opened the debugger complained. Ofcourse that should be
done different. But why couldn`t it load a screen and window I wonder. It`s
using all newcommandset commands by the way.

What is your setup? Gfx card?

Someone tried it with a bvision and he said it worked when he used
modepromoter or whatever the name of the utility was. Thus I expect it to work
for you too, this way. Or the attachment is corrupt.

It`s either relying on modepromoting or using an aslscreenreq with filtering
out only certain screens. But the latter I haven`t figured out at all how to
do exactly and screwing around too much that way gives crashes. I do create a
hires ntsc max overscan mode of a given depth. I add a tag to the screen to be
likeworkbench(except overridden settings). 

That`s the least worries for me and I guess it`s acceptable for gfx card
users. Is it? =)

Still if anyone tried, tell me how it worked. And I still don`t know how to
load a font for a given screen and use it there for screen and
windows(newcommandset).

Works here on UAE, but the program doesn't have an icon so perhaps the 
others are running some kind of deficons patch? Or something like that.

Have you got a hardcoded screen ID in the tags you use for opening the 
screen? If someone hasn't got the NTSC monitor driver in devs:monitors, 
then it will not be in the system screenmode database, and so when you try 
to open the screen you'll get an error.

I also got the "NWindow object not specified..." error, but when I ran the 
NTSC monitor driver it worked OK after that. Well, it opened the screen and 
now doesn't appear to do anything. It's not crashed, but there are no 
windows or anything on your screen.

I don't know if p96 has mode promotion stuff built in, I rarely use the 
prefs programs or anything else with it.

No, I installed the NTSC monitor driver, so it opened up an NTSC screen. 
It wasn't promoted.

Subject: @{b}timing@{ub}

Is there a way to write to the serial port in an interrupt handler and if so
how? I made a vblank interrupt based timer and the timing plus the code in
it(blinking the filter to see if it works) works accurate. But the writes to
serial based on the timer crash if put in the interrupt handler. But if the
writes to serial are in the main loop they sometimes don`t happen, say if you
move a window. It means the timer signal from the interrupt has not been
reached by the serial write code(its just an "if this=1 then write to serial"
thing), cause the program(well intuition) was occupied with other things.
Upping priorities and such doesn`t seem to work. I also don`t want to lock
stuff orso. 

Or is there another way to do this timing thing. But it should hardly ever
stock up. Whatever the system load.

Hi fellow coders

Sorry for the O.T. post but I desperately need a graphic artist for my
current and future projects. I'm intending to go commercial with them and so
am giving this opportunity to collaborate with a fellow
coder/artist/designer to make lots of money.

Obviously I can't offer any pay until we have commercial success later this
year but I am offering an EQUAL share in all royalties or profits made.

This is an exciting opportunity for some artist/coder dreaming of getting

think you can draw low-res graphics at the pixel level with the quality of
the Bitmap Brothers or Bullfrog (or even half as good will do, which is half

Hi,

I have probably asked this before.  Sorry.

I am trying to write my own programs but I keep running into problems.

I know that pressing the help button on a command gives you the syntax, but
I am stuck when the syntax is implied more than explained.

openserial() is the example.

I want to open the /serial device /but it is not THE serial device.

It is:  hyperCOM3.device Unit 1 @ 1200 Baud 7 bit, no parity 2 stop and NO
flow control.

the "io_serflags" doesn't mean that much to me and looking through the book
(a little white one) there is no index to the commands.  :-(

Anyone?

Insted of just pressing the help key over the command, you can press RAmiga-
Help and you should get a window pop up with a fuller explanation (usually 
the same one which is in the reference manual). However, this only really 
works for the Acid libraries.

There was supposed to be some other help method with BSS, which included 
*all* the commands. I can't remember how to call it though - I don't seem 
to have all the programs here and pressing and combination of a qualifier 
key with help doesn't bring it up.

I know it's got to do with the red_help scripts, which are in 
blitz2:redhelp/ but I thought that calling them were built into the new 
editor.

If anyone can tell you how to get that working, that's the best thing to 
do. Alternatively, there's a file on Aminet/b2k "bb2guide13" or similar in 
dev/basic. It lists all the commands up to BUM7.

You don't know how to get that working???

Probably some good info to put on your site for newbies David :

OK, provided you have BSS:

First, go into a shell and type:

1.Blitz2:RedHelp> Protect #?rexx +s

Then you -should- be able to press RAmiga+Help, RAlt+Help and
RShift+Help to access all the differant Help types (one uses the
original AcidHelp system to jump to a command's help, one uses the
RedHelp system to jump to a command's help and another uses the
RedHelp system to jump to a library's help index, if you follow me =]
)

Still this system doesn't automagically add help for every command,
you have to have the redhelp.dat file configured to point to an
appropriate .guide file, which has to be written up, and very few
library authors write these sorts of stylised .guides =]

The MUIlib .guide is one, however...

But now I'm just rambling =]

No, I thought it was a keypress, but it doesn't work (here). Now that 
you've explained it (and I had already installed your RedHelpFix) I'm gonna 
go home and check it. Even though I've set the protection flags of some of 
the scripts here, WinUAE doesn't always keep them.

Hmm, need to look into that and update the updated gtlib guide then. Did 
the redhelpfix put any new guides in there?

It just needs you to organise the index and labels for each command in
a specific way I think...  Havn't written one myself so I'm only
half-guessing <grin>

RedHelpFix didn't add any guides but it corrected a heap of spelling
and some spacing mistakes...

I do now :)

The problem was I didn't have the extra Ted menus set up - so I was missing 
the ENV:ted.menus file (or something). This one sets up the shortcuts for 
AltHelp and ShiftHelp to bring up the guide files.

Doh!

You could write a guide file for CatsCrapLib (or was it CatScrapLib ;)

Hmmm, how about having it generate some Enforcer hits for no apparent
reason?   ;)

I have been thinking about that actually ;] But I don't think shoving
in some Enforcer-hit-causing startup or end code would be a good
idea...  Maybe if I did a command that just reads or writes a
longword from a random location or something.  I was also thinking of
doing something that places a random value in A4.  Isn't that the one
that Blitz uses?  ;] Or just increases it by one or something =]

But these just aren't as 'gold' as Crash =] EatMem was a good one... 
Never used that one personally, though =]

Hi Toby

Didn't it do that anyway, the rest of Blitz usually does ;)

> longword from a random location or something.  I was also thinking of

If you want a safe command, just read a longword from 0. It won't crash, 
but it'll cause enforcer hits.

If you want it to crash, try writing a longword to address 4 :)

Blitz uses a4 for local variable space (when you are in 
statements/procedures). a5 is the gloabl variable space (all other 
variables) and a3 is the temporary string buffer. Trashing a3 or a4 could 
easily cause crashes and enforcer hits, trashing a5 would probably cause 
enforcer hits during the program and crashes on exit.

No, they're all .rx. But chances are, if Andrew has the RedHelp directory 
then he will have all the necessary files (he won't if he's stupid like me 
though :).

BSS is on B2k. You'll find them in that. And it should be safe just to 
cancel all requesters when you are installing it, I'll need to update the 
install readme.
