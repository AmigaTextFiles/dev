						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

Subject: @{b}.txt files to strings, and packing.@{ub}


many a time ago,
I tried to read normal .txt files,
so that I could Print the sentences,
or read certain values.

but I never succeded,
and now I need something like it
for "mission text", and other things in a game.
so I would really like some advice,
because I don't want to fill my code with
these texts.

also, to not let files be "free for view"
I pondered about whatever packing methods
is easiest to use when I need to edit
the files frequently.

DIm mission_text.s(100)
If ReadFile(0, "the name of the mission text file")
    FileInput 0
    i = 0
    While Not Eof(0)
        ; This allows up to 256 characters per line. They must be Amiga
        ; style line endings (CR), not Windows style (CRLF)
        mission_text(i) = Edit$(256)
        i=i+1
    Wend
    PopInput
    CloseFile 0
EndIf

The simplest method is to use the Cipher$ command. You would need to save your text files 
using the Cipher$ command (something like this):

DIm mission_text.s(100)
If WriteFile(0, "the name of the plain text mission text file")
    FileOutput 0
    For i=0 To number_of_lines_in_mission_text
		NPrint Cipher$(mission_text(i)
    Next
    PopOutput
    CloseFile 0
EndIf


And now your code to read these texts in could be something like this:

DIm mission_text.s(100)
If ReadFile(0, "the name of the mission text file")
    FileInput 0
    i = 0
    While Not Eof(0)
        ; This allows up to 256 characters per line. They must be Amiga
        ; style line endings (CR), not Windows style (CRLF)
        mission_text(i) = Cipher$(Edit$(256))
        i=i+1
    Wend
    PopInput
    CloseFile 0
EndIf


However, the Cipher$ is not very secure, which you can see from the source code of the 
ElmoreDosLib. It might mean normal users cannot see your text but if someone is determined 
to get it they might work it out. Of course, there is also no compression with Cipher$


Another option would be to use powerpacker (there are some functions on Aminet to show you 
how to use PowerPacker in Blitz) or another compression library (IIRC there were some 
compression libraries that RWE released as part of the Blitz Support Suite). The 
disadvantage here is that the file format will give away the encoding of your files and so 
someone would need to simply use the decompression tool for that format to read your texts.


Obviously you could combine the two methods (encoding and compression) for more security.

Subject: @{b}3D array trouble with writemem or readmem.@{ub}


I use one array that has 3 dimensions in my game,
and It always seemed incorrect
after I had saved and loaded again.

then today I wanted to test if that was true,
and it was.

either the writemem or readmem
creates gaps with 0's, when all should be 1's


----test 3d array saving---------

Dim adimin3d.b(10,10,10)

For n1=1 To 10
 For n2=1 To 10
  For n3=1 To 10
  adimin3d(n1,n2,n3)=1
  Next
 Next
Next

savefile$="ram:3darray"
Gosub save

Dim adimin3d.b(10,10,10)

loadfile$="ram:3darray"
Gosub load

For n1=1 To 10
 For n2=1 To 10
  For n3=1 To 10
  single.b=adimin3d(n1,n2,n3)
  Print single
  VWait 2
  Next
 Next
Next

MouseWait

End

No, the reason is that Blitz's arrays start from an index of 0 and go up to the value you specify 
when you do a Dim.

You should really do this:
	WriteMem 0,&adimin3d.b(0,0,0),11*11*11

To make sure you read and write the entire array. By using the code you wrote, you will always get 
values with 0 since you are going over the end of one array (because you write all bytes in 1 
command) and into the next array which has a 0 at the start.

The values of each item in the array are something like this (in 2D, but is the same principle for 
your 3D array) for array(x,y):

   x
 y 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 ...

So by starting from x,y=1,1 and writing 100 bytes you will read the item with a value of 0 at 
x,y=0,2 because that is in the array memory after x,y=10,1.

A far better approach would be to write each dimension of the array separately. You do not then 
need to guess at the internal structure of Blitz's arrays.

e.g.
    For x=1 To 10
        For y=1 To 10
            WriteMem 0,&admin3d(x,y,1),Sizeof.b*10
            ; --OR--
            ReadMem 0,&admin3d(x,y,1),Sizeof.b*10
        Next
    Next

@NODE "mail_8" " AB2 Questions "
From: Tony Rolfe <edgewater@...>
Date: 10-12-02 07:47:45
Subject: @{b}AB2 Questions@{ub}

Hi, 

I'm trying to use Syntax 2 in my AB2 Program and am getting a 
"Variable declared twice" on 

Deftype.Acc *Account

I've previously defined a newtype of .Acc

I cannot find any previous definition of *Account.   Could there be a 
clash with *Accounts, or Account?

A second thought.   If you write Fred$ = "Fred", I assume that the 
compiler does something like 

dc.b "Fred"

and then generates code to move this to the variable.

Would it be possible to have a Deftype.s Fred$ = Fred so that the 
compiler only has to do

Fred dc.b "Fred"   ;  or whatever, thus saving the move.

This may give problems with variables, but if this was allowed for 
Constants (Read-only strings) there should be no difficulty.   Maybe we 
could have

StringConstant Fred$ = "Fred"  ; rather than Deftype.

What do you think?

Cheers

Adding new dataypes is hard 
AB2 have here a datatypetable where can check convert of types or give error
I found 1 type that seem unnescesary it is the .a type.

Does someone ever here from a BB2 Datatype .a ?
What is this ?

.convtable ds.l 1              ;bytetobyte
.handle_datatypes 
AL_0_E37A: Dc.l AJL_0_95C8     ;bytetoword
AL_0_E37E: Dc.l AJL_0_95CA     ;bytetolong
AL_0_E382: Dc.l AJL_0_95DC     ;bytetoquick
AL_0_E386: Dc.l AJL_0_95FC     ;bytetofloat
AL_0_E38A: Dc.l AJL_0_95CA     ;bytetolong
AL_0_E38E: Dc.l error_convert_types     ;noconerr
AL_0_E392: Dc.l AJL_0_9636     ;wordtobyte

The stringtable look like this:

AL_0_E41A: Dc.l error_convert_types     ;noconerr
AL_0_E41E: Dc.l error_convert_types     ;noconerr
AL_0_E422: Dc.l error_convert_types     ;noconerr
AL_0_E426: Dc.l AJL_0_9764     ;stringtolong
AL_0_E42A: Dc.l error_convert_types     ;noconerr
AL_0_E42E: Dc.l error_convert_types     ;noconerr
AL_0_E432: Dc.l AJL_0_9764     ;stringtolong
   Ds.l 1

I am sure if I add datatypes here it give problems also to nonoptimizer code
and i hear the voices then better use BB2 than AB2 

writeconvertcode:  MOVE.w D3,D1
  SUBQ.w #1,D1
  MULU #$7,D1
  ADD.w D2,D1
  SUBQ.w #1,D1
  LSL.w #2,D1
  LEA convtable,A0
  MOVE.l $0(A0,D1.W),D1
   BEQ.w JL_0_97A2
  MOVEA.l D1,A0
     CMP.b #$ff,d3
     BEQ JL_0_97A2
L_0_97A0: JMP (A0)

>You see all is fixed done using  
> What do you think?
 
AB2 have a constant string optimizer still in but it is deactivate because
the detector if can do a immediate way and use only the pointer of the
string is hard to detect all milliards possible solution  

for ex.

a$="adfgb" is simple and work ok for now you save lots of code and speed

If do a
if a="abcd"          must create the tempstring 
If do a 
a$="abcd"+a$         must create tempstring 
If do a 
a$=val("1234")       can work direct
a$=val("1234"+a$) need tempstring

I think there are other codesolutions out that maybe fail too 
I add the stringoptimizer for a long time now my knowledge about BB2 is
higher.. 

If someone want play with the stringoptimizer change the bra 'l50 to beq
'l50
and activate tst.b or drop me a mail so i can send a version

It also help me if someone send me code that show problem of stringoptimizer
My Programs work with this but i am sure there is much possible that fail

JL_0_ADC0:
  MOVE.l AL_0_E8EE,AL_0_EC4A
  ;TST.b fast ;optistrings
  BRA 'l50

Hi

I am trying to run both AB2 and BB2 on my machine in completely 
separate environments.    However, they both seem to want the Blitz2: 
assign pointing at their own directory.

Would it be possible to add to AB2 a tooltype to allow the user to have 
Blitz2: and BlitzLibs: for BB2 and AmiBlitz2: and AmiBlitzLibs: for AB2?

Or is there something there already?

Thanks

BB2 work too only you need is put BB2 and ted to a clean AB2 install.
Then it should work too.If you want a old deflibs file to use with BB2
change the tooltype in AB2 for example libfile=ab2deflibs.But best is use
the same libfile for AB2 and BB2 to reduce the possibilities of having
diffrences here.
  
If you use both keep in mind dont use BB2 on no real Amigas (Amithlon
Pegasos and AMigaOne) also look that you not make lines larger than 128

I have a BB2 program which I use for financial management for my 
business.    

I want to convert this program from BB2 to AB2, but want to retain the 
ability to make changes to the BB2 version while testing the AB2 
version.

The source compiles fine under BB2 (obviously!).   When I try to 
compile it under AB2 it fails.    Some time ago, Bernd told me that AB2 
loads Acidlibs and deflibs in the opposite order to BB2 so some 
inconsistencies can occur.    Also, he has made some changes to the 
libraries and I need to test these so that I can be sure that there is no 
problem.

What I need to do is create a completely separate AB2 environment, 
with different libs, environment variables etc. so I can keep the 
"Production" program and the "Development" program separate.

Even the program history lists need to be different otherwise I might 
load the wrong version of the program and screw things up.

Once I've converted and tested I can scrap BB2.

Anyway, that's my excuse.

Cheers

Put ped and amiblitz2 files in your BB2 dir and try to compile.Does this
fail ?
If it fail look with the gui libman (bb2libman i think) for clashes.

If there are no clashes in and it still fail please search for the place
where it fail.

If it not fail you can use your old deflibs per Tooltype in AB2

BTW: in C there is standard to write workarounds for bad compilers (winuae
have lots of them)in AB2 this should never hget standard

AB2 and BB2 can use together in same directory also new acidlibs/reddebug 
work with BB2

It compiles fine using PED/AB2 in the Blitz2: directory.   Actually, it 
found a couple of programming errors than BB2 missed!

This is OK, except that I'd like to be able to use the new versions of 
libraries supplied with AB2.   They have some Enforcer hits and other 
bugs fixed, I believe.

I still think it would be a good idea to have separate assigns and env 
vars for the two systems.   People could assign ab2: Blitz2: etc if they 
wanted.

One thing I noticed is that the executable created by AB2 is much 
bigger than BB2. (1667K vs 743K)   I did turn off the debug option in the 
Compiler Options requester, so I'm confused as to why this is so.

Regards

Now try the new acidlibs with both versions.It should work too

For the new deflibsfile(that might the main problem for you i think)
create another amiblitz2 file called amiblitz2_newlibs

Here you set the tooltype to libfile=ab2deflibs

If you like to use also the new deflibs:

Then you can start amiblitz2 save your code with mycode.ab2.This do it in
nontoken form.Same as ascii but you get also all residents you load.Start
amiblitz2_newlibs
and load it in.hopefully you get all instructions.

If not put your fd convertet libs to blitz2:userlibs/beta and do reload all
libs or start amiblitz2 again

Make also sure that the fd libs not clash with new deflibs.See table for
free libnums

Yes you can use if you wish a shellscript useAB2 useBB2 that do that.
Add this as a icon with iconx and you can switch as you like

I spend no work to do that because AB2 and BB2 can work (and i recommend to
do so)in 1 directory
together.

Adding support for this make life harder and make problems because you need
always use 2 dirs 
The first mails i get was like this:

BB2 compile always with smallest possible if you create a file.AB2 use
always the compiler switch.Sense is you can create faster files that
execute extern (important for plugins)but i can add a tooltype if someone
dont like it that way

If you want smaller and faster files try also optimize 1 (only with the
newest 2.27b2)

BTW: I get a long time no optimizer report so it seem now stable in 2.27b2 ?

Hi all!

Any one noticed that executables compiled
with Blitz2 or AB2 are killing audio output
via Paula chip ?

Try to select a paula AHI mode and play someting (e.g. Amplifier).
Then start a program done in Blitz that does not neccessary
use the Paula chip and it will break the audio output.

Anyone an idea what is wrong ? Is is a special
librarie that is causing this behavior ?

Ciao,

hmmm, just tried it here with mpega and eagleplayer and all works fine,
same with Amplifier using AHI, so it's probably a library your using..

I tried running 3 of my blitz progams with each progam...

Hello Nick

OK, I found the bug. It is in the library
where the LoadSound command comes from.
If you use this library it kills the current
Paula output when it is initialisized, you
dont have to execute a command, just
if it is linked in the exe it is enough.

Maybe someone wants to fix this if there is an interesst to
use this blitzlib in a system friendly app.
(I doubt !)

I have already requested that 2 times on this list,
because I always listen to music.

when a blitz program starts,
and it has ANY sound related command compiled in it,
it will kill any other output.

I REALLY want this fixed
as I have made a prog that is ran on
workbench, wich uses some sound related commands,
like Freq and period, but are rarely used,
and because I want users to not get this
output break, I include 2 exe's of it,
with and without sound commands.
( I use the <compile if> stuff )

anyone PLS fix it if you know you can!
(crossing fingers)

btw:
the executable is 350kb
and the source is 200kb

is that a normal differencie?

You cannot share paula sound in sensefull way without using AHI.I spent no
time for lowlevel technic.

Maybe someone else do it ?
Because paula have only 4 channnels and they are most time all used by a
program.All mods have 4 channels....Usefull qualtiy need 14bit++.....

Try using ahi high level mode for playing single samples.MP3 players use
this way too so you can play also other samples 

This way can play as much samples together 
You can play samples like this:

  WriteFile (0,"audio:")
  WriteMem 0,mysound,32768
  CloseFile 0

Start this program and you hear crap noise

Keep in mind your program is block until your sound is played so you need
create a own soundplay highlevel task.You need to add a aiff ? header in
your memspace that show the samplerate/format that it should play.If you
create more tasks you can play more sounds
 
Maybe someone have some usefull ahi functions or wavefunctions available
I can convert it in newobjectformat so it is shown also with shorthelp and
all can find it in the thousands of AB2 functions

Try this in C the source is then ca 1 MB

Paul Burkey wrote some AHI functions, which are available on the Blitz2000 site 
(Archives/System). I think Thilo also produced some AHI functions?

Subject: @{b}Re: Blitz executables kill Paula@{ub}

Hi all!

I have an include file for using AHI in high level, that
means just open the AHI device and make some output.
It has only a few functions for audio doublebuffering,
but it would be no problem to complete it for one shot sounds.

I have also an include file that reads aiff, wav, maud, 8svx, mp3, cdda
and raw audio data and can convert it from any to any format.
e.g. 24bit stereo to 8bit mono. This one is a bit more difficult to handle
and needs quite a lot of other includes made by me. (e.g. file i/o).

I will try to make an AHI replacement for the blitz sound functions
that supports many audio file formats.

Ciao,

Thilo

Yeah, you hear a slight interruption of the music which will continue as soon as a 
sample gets (re)played no big deal, it`s not worthit even mentioning in my 
opinion. Everyone knows, or should know you just can`t play Paula with more than 1 
program normally and expecting any sane sound coming from it. Ok it shouldnt happen 
if you just start a program which is able to use Paula sound, but what the hell, 
there`s worse things to be bothered by.

Hi Folks.

I spotted a strange and highly annoying problem. If I do the following thing:

a$="32.55"
a.f=VAL(a$)
NPrint a

I get 32.54999. Bernd Roesch (thanks, Bernd) told me to use the FORMAT-Command, but this is only shifting to problem to higher values, where it does still exist. I want to enter numbers in GTStringGadgets, extract them with GTGetString for VALing and then calculating with them.

Any ideas?

something like this?

Function.l  Value {input$}
  valu.l=0
  chars.w=StrToLong_(&input$,&valu)
  Function Return valu
End Function

or 

a.f=VAL(a$)+0.00001

not tested but a couple of  ideas to play with :)

That's how floating point numbers work. You will either have to be clever (e.g. work with 
strings and integer values and manually insert the decimal point) or live with it.

Hm... but this looks more like quick type. Floats should not do this as they
are kept as normalized values with an 10^x exponent. Are you sure you
are using floats (and not quicks) ?

Try to avoid Floating point numbers unless you <<REALLY>> need 
them.    Floats are really good if you are going to need huge numbers 
without pin-point accuracy.    If you are going to use small numbers and 
need accuracy then use quicks or longs.

The only time I use floats is if the answer is likely to overflow a long 
word.   You can get a few DP accuracy in a long if you keep track of the 
scaling factor yourself.

Floats are about as bad. They are normalised with an exponent to the base 2. If they used base 
10, there would be no rounding errors in decimal numbers. Here is the value I get out of my C 
compiler on this PC - 32.5499992371

Yes but C is accurat with 7 numbers BB2 print command is acurat with 6
numbers
The reason is that AB2 use too the FFP (fastfloating Point) format in Print
command of the
of the old printlib even if you use in AB2 the FPU.

Try out egjplot3_amiga in the AB2 example dir with FPU or without.

You see here too that the FPU have higher accuracy  

If i change the printlib to use real IEEE FPU values in optimize 2 you can
reach 1 more number.Also i can do is change the printcommand that it round
automatic to 7 numbers.Other numbers are then cut.But does this help ?
Also you cannot use old data that are saved in FFP Format without writing a
conversion routine to convert FFP to IEEE.


AB2 printcommand is exact with 0,001 % and C is acurat with 0,0001 %

But if someone insert a value of 100000.34 in your stringdad this value is
print out as 100000.3 in C and 100000.00 in AB2 

More is not possible with 32 bit FPU.

You need then 64 bit FPU which AB2 only support in assembler.
Of course you need then a print command that support this

I plan not to support 64 bit in basic because 3D Chips use 32 bit FPU for
audio its enough to use 32 bit.And for money i think its enough in praxis
to loose 0.001% of your income 

This mean in Praxis:

AB2 FFP
12345678.9 All after number 6 is then crap 

With IEEE Format you get: 24 bit Mantisse 7 bit exponent  

12345678.9 All after the number 7 is then crap

With the number David print you see that you must use the 8. place to round
the value 

A trick in AB2 you can still do is change the format command for example
like this:
format ###########.## 
if val>99999 then format ###############  

This look professionel because in praxis with values over 99999 you add no
pennys

My point was that either using C or Blitz, you will never really be able to store the exact 
value 32.55. I do not think you need to give yourself more work writing some extra floating 
point code, but that users must be made aware of the problems with floats.

It depends on your application. I'm sure the tax collector would wonder where that 0.001% went

Hi together

First thanks for your mental work. With the FORMAT-Command "###'###'###.##" 32.55 remains 32.55. This works up to around 65000.55. With 66000.55 you'll get 66000.54. And the funniest of all, with 100000.55 you'll get 100000.5.

That's pretty confusing. You're all right, I should choose the Quick-Type. Problem's only, I want to make a software to control (my) bank accounts. I really don't want to pretend something, but I really need the possibility to work with numbers that are greater than 32768. Is it really impossible to create something that's able to control that matter? In that case I'll have to cancel the whole work here and get a PC with a professional software. And don't tell me, that they make the same mistakes. This would have global consequences :)

Hello Ivo

Why dont you use just long vars and count everything in pennies ?
Only to make the values visible you can write a function like this:

function.s mymoney2string {pennievalue.l}
function return str$(int(pennievalue /100))+"."+str$(penniemoney mod 100)
end function

This will avoid all your problems and there will be still enough headroom
if you should win a lotterie ;-)

It is possible but much work to add 64 bit FPU and since Amiga is MEGAOUT
(maybe people sit and wait for PPC
maybe they give complete up)and last time i do something that i not need
(the image_blitmask command to allow very fast graphiccard games) and noone
use or do some suggestions to it i think its better to only add features i
need too.

If you need a feature and you dont know if i plan to add this of course feel
free to ask

Purebasic support no 64 bit floats 
BlitzbasicPC also dont support this.

Only you can do is use C and maybe VisualBasic (does someone know this ?)

I think like Thilo that money software calc in pennys and only split the
numberstring and add a dot in it.

I check the theory with AMigaMoney and it fail when i add 3 times 9 Millions
9000000.00

The Limit of long is +/- 21 474 836.48 so maximum is here 21 Millions

Toooooo few for Bill Gates so i think Visual Basic support 64 bit

@NODE "mail_40" " CPU usage "

Subject: @{b}CPU usage@{ub}

Hi there,

I'm after a function that will let me measure CPU usage. I've found a small C
example on Aminet - but I usually have to battle through C source code, and
then crash a lot whilst trying to convert it.

Does anyone have a hand made example of doing this, or can you at least point me
in the right direction.

Thanks.

All the best

Scout has a cpu measure feature where it continuously(well, in some seconds 
intervals) updates the list of tasks and cpu usage etc in %. It uses a "cheat task" 
at the lowest priority which I assume is just looping as fast as possible, it won`t 
hog the system at lowest priority ofcourse. Though the docs say it patches some 
system functions also. Do some creative thinking ;-)

I`ve got vague memories of a value hidden somewhere in a structure that was 
returned from an Exec library call that was something to do with the CPU`s 
idle time.

I did fudge about a bit with it, apparently my 040/40 was only 42% idle when 
OS3.9 was sitting there doing bugger all ! (I do remember it was from a bit 
of C code that I recoded to blitz..maybe the same source you mention)

To be honest, I was starting to think that (most) CPU usage programs were doing
something similar. Even the C example that I found, as far as I can tell, has
to access th task list.

So - it's possible to time a loop and see how many iterations of the loop are
performed in a given timeframe, but I still don't know how I would convert this
to a percentage of the CPU in total. I'd need a frame of reference that would
work on all CPU's (obviously, an '020 is going to be under consideable more
load than an '060 doing the same tasks).

I'll have a think....

I think scout do something wrong because i use softints for my synth.System
get really slow down with much voices but scout show only 5% CPU load.

This way work:

Use the benchcode i post to the list.Do a disable the first time store the
mips then.Set taskpriority then to -99 and calculate the mips you get.

If you get 4,7 Mips with disable and 0.47 Mips with enable you know that you
have 90 % CPU load.

But keep in mind if you do that you prevent the CPU to go into idle mode and
save power.So do it best every second for about 2/50 to safe the CPU 's
life.060 get hotter if you do it always

hi, I was wondering if ab2 could get a feature,
where you select a color to be used on comments.

those lines you either put
to the right of,
above,
or beneath your lines of code
with the ";" character. 

I would like this,
because my code would be much easier to read.

my choice in color, would be grey
comments in contrast to ie: white code.

maybe there already is such a feature

It's already there, but as a tooltype, try these (the number is the pen to use):

NEWCOLORMODE
RemarkForg=9

@NODE "mail_47" " Does REDDebugger work under WinUAE? "
From: Paul Richer <paul@...>

Subject: @{b}Does REDDebugger work under WinUAE?@{ub}

Hi there!

It's been a long time since I wrote to the list ; doesn't mean I've stopped
working with BlitzBasic. I never stopped using it since the first version
with the dongle. Our company ( www.PhotogramTechnologies.com ) even won
PIA's 2002 Premier Printing Award in the P.O.P. category, with a 3D
lenticular poster encoded with softwares I wrote with BlitzBasic2.

For the first time, I have a bug that resists me more than 2 days ; so I
tried to start REDDebugger. All I could achieve is a small window bar with
"RED Debugger V2.5" as title, and could do nothing else than close it. No
menus, no nothing. Does it open on a screen invisible to WinUAE? Should I go
back to my old A4000/PPC, or to my A3000 were I last seen Blitz debugger
work 'fine'?

Btw, I heard of AmiBlitz. Anything to do with BlitzBasic2? Any better?
Bigger? Double precision FP support?

thanks!

Paul Richer

BB2 is the best.It is impossible that Developers (except me so i develop it)
need more features than BB2 have since 1994;) 

Maybe you try a short look in the amiblitzhistory.txt to see the lots and
unusual news 

AB2 have lots new features depends what you want do with it.
My goal was make it comfortable and with no Limits and fast as C so i no and
never need C.

except for developing winuae i need C.
AB2 is only develop with winuae and should work here     

64bit i not need but AB2 32 bit FPU is more acurat as BB2 ffp.See in AB2.26

Wow, you obviously really don't get many bugs ;p

You don't start the debugger, and that window you got is just a small tool that sits and waits 
for messages from the real debugger so that only one copy runs at any time (IIRC).

You should just be able to write some code like this:

Stop
End

Run it and the debugger should appear. If not, it could be something like screenmode too small 
for the debugger windows or perhaps missing libraries. Run Snoopdos to check for missing libs.

It works fine on WinUAE here.

Hi Bernd

Is 64bit FFP support very long to implement?

It is very useful in scientific computation such as what my software has to
perform. I would even welcome 80bit ffp (or even 'slow' floating point)
support.

I'm in Québec, Canada ; where should I buy AmiBlitz?

Hi David

Thanks a lot, it finally open and work 'fine'.

All I had to do is add a "Stop" command to 'start' the debugger.

So I guess you suggest me to switch to AmiBlitz. I'll put an eye on it.

It take some time for something i not need.So i plan this not 

You see for the existing Users (i guess most have give up Amiga)old BB2
precision is still good enough).You wrote last mail you win the first price
with BB2 ffp.Try out AB2 10* increased accuracy in worst case maybe this
help.If you do code like this:

a=b*c+x+sin(20)
x=a+v-c+q

The result a stay in 64bit FPU register which also can increase acuracy by
more than 10* in some situations.Also AB2 use still 64 bit constants 

Only Thilo and of course I need fpu/optimizer

winuae Amithlon only do 64 bit.The only Basiclanguage support 64bit is
VisualBasic.(PureBasic Blitzpc support 32bit)
For counting Bill Gates income VisualBasic have a special 15 Byte decimal
format.

Isn`t there some 64 bit maths in the OS maths libraries?
( I don`t have the OS Dev docs here at the moment, so I can`t check)

LMAO ;)

Isn`t that just a simple routine that counts the days since 1980 then 
multiplies by $1 million ?

Yes, but they are only support functions IIRC for the 64bit fp. Putting them into variables is also 
a pain in the ass (since Blitz does not support an atomic 64 bit data type) and what are you going 
to do with them afterwards. There is no way to display them AFAICS. Which is fine if you don't need 
to, but I guess more people would need that than don;t.

Using that is not very comfortable.If a term is very complex it take lots
time
to split the formular.

Also the most important stuff is a str$ and val that print out the result.

If someone use winuae he can easy check accuracy of FPU in 32bit and 64 bit.

If set CPU to 020/881 all calcs are rounded to 32 bit.If set a 040 all calcs
are 64 bit.

Its a bug of winuae but i fix it not because its usefull to check if a
program need higher precision so you can choose fastest speed.Using 64bit
FPU instructions is slower on AMithlon and winuae because of X86
byteswapping

But i check programs like cinema3d Monzoom (Raytracer)and i found no
diffrence between 64 bit and 32 bit.so i see no need for 99.8% of apps to
use 64 bit

I will certainly switch to AB2 right after I am finished debugging and
testing my last prototype (I promised it going to test 2 weeks ago).

For now, I use my own 32bit fix point routines. Now that I have done 3 of
them, I realize I should have taken the time to write 64bit/80bit FFP Str$()
and Val() ; even though I realize I'm probably the only one in such a need
for heavy scientific calculations.

What do you think of VisualBasic? I'm not sure I would become a traitor and

FFP Format is only 32bit.You can use only the IEEE Format which support
32/64 bit by libs or direct in 881 FPU in 80 bit. 

If you have done that it should be not too much work to use a optimize 8
that use 64 bit fpu
because only the loadfpu and savefpu routines and the typesize need
change.And the type size of course.

It have 64 bit support but can only use if you need no fast
speed.Calculating Speed is about 020/14 MHZ enough for sql server frontend

To have real 80 bit you need to stay on a real Amiga with 68k FPU no PPC no

Grrr.. seems that I lost control over my own source. What did you change ?
I saw only NFalse instead of False from the first view.

Hey you released it without limitations and I didn`t release it as "official" or

It means it wasn`t bug ridden but had some problems. There was one bug though afaik, 
read the comments, it`s about the text string in the error function. And further it`s 
fixed so I can use it as I don`t use blitz` window and screen lib. Also I changed 
variables with .s into $ except in newtypes, iirc it`s bad to use .s .And 
cause I bet there may be others whoneed the same I figured it`d be best to share it.

I could change the comments to make it more clear it`s NOT "official" etc.

A theory of programming ungary Notation which windows recommend say that you
should always the type of your vars for ex a window handle

HWND HWND_window

So you see all the time that this is a var with type hwnd.

Of course this take additional typing so near noeone do this.But with
string$ you have only one char overhead and see with first look that it is
a string.

This is a matter of taste if you use this or this but i think if you do
share programming it is easier to understand a non self written program

In C++ such a behavior is very nice 

name.open

Only the writer knows what name for a object is.Others must use classbrowser
which work excelent if you develop under Linux;)

A
 openimage(name,imgaenum,sizex,sizey)

is clear for everyone and allow also lots additional parameters

But its nice to see that someone do something for AB2

But some Tipps i have still for this:

1.I see you use winpointer and screenpointer for it.

Since AB2.26 it is possible in newsyntaxmode that you leave of paramters
that are 0 to be compatible with old syntax of image_blit.

This mean in praxis if someone do a image_blit {1,10,10} the  parameter
winpointer or screnpointer is then 0.

You should test if winpointer/screenpointer is 0 and use then the
old way with used screen and used window.So this function can then work with
less code.It is not comfortable to always add screenpointer or winpointer
because most time you do all following actions in one window.Only if you use
AmigaOS direct this is necessary and work here too 

2.You enhance a really old one.

The image_blitmask Instruction is missed (Important to allow GFX Card Games)
See AB2.26 distri in graphiccardexamples image_include.bb2 for practice use
of objects

 
I explain the advantage of using macros:

David it is nice when it is possible to add this to AB2 docu (i dont know if
my english is understandable so feel free to port it in more readable form)
 

Normaly in C this is named as Object.You have here a object declarationblock

For AB2 i am too lazy to do a object command that do really the same as
macros which have the only effect that it sound more standard or more
professionel.Ok i do a handy macro for this in AB2.27

!object comment

!endobject 

Every function need then 2 extra lines of course but advantage you get is:

You can find instructions with the instructionhelper,get paramterhelp with
help
can do online help with shift help.

In praxis there is no diffrence to real BB2 libs but you can use basic
instructions and link dynamic.

If you use usepath instructions like the imageinclude do you need every time
you change the path a uselastpath to store the path to the same as before
the call.
This is need because if the calling program use a path the program work then
with the wrong path if you not restore the path
 

Using such a object is then like this:

You can build a resident.res file or just include it in the old way.
Best is you build a testprogram for developing this lib and include it in
old way.
So you need not create all the time a resident file.


A ex: !image_include do initializing stuff (same as import in JAVA or C)also
some values can support here.(imageimclude support here maximages)
Also it is a good idea to include often used functions in this macro
(Object)
!image_load:!image_blitmask:!image_free:!image_blit.
This give some comfort to the user he must not import this functions manuel 

User can then add every other instruction with ex: !image_setdither 

This give you the feature that only the code you need is add to the program

For lazy programers (like me) i recommend a command ex: !inage_all for lib
builders
This include all functions to your code but result in larger code

You can add also many functions to a macro (object)

The disadvantage is that then help cannot work.(i dont like functions with
paramter help)  

And last: 

If someone have some ideas to make it more handy please let me know

I can send you my tcp.include. It provides some
easy to understand high-level functions to send/receive
TCP IP packets. You can send any data to any ip adress with it.
Only problem you will get is how to exchange the ip adresses
of the two (or more) players.
If you have a web-server or some webspace you
can send your own ip adress to this webserver and collect
ip adresses that are already "logged in". But your
game will be unusable if this webspace is closed.

Maybe I should make the tcp.include public anyway, seems that
people liked the image.include.

Writetype can only write newtypes to disk.
If you write a single string you need fields and put
but best is make a newtype of all your vars you need and save it with
writetype.
The newtype can increase later loading a old file give new entrys 0.


This work:

newtype .gamevars
string1.s
string2.s
string3.s 
string4.s 
val.l
val.l
.......
endf newtype


myvars.gamevars\string1="hello"
...........................

writetype 0,myvars

I don't know if you could do this using ReadMem and WriteMem (should
be able to, theoretically) but try writing a string such as this to a
savefile character by character:

PLAYERNAME=GazChap

So you'd write each character in turn and then a line feed (Chr$(10))
to the file.

Then you can read in, character by character, everything up to a line
feed and you'd have the string.

Now you just have to extract the bit before the equals (in this case
PLAYERNAME) and the bit after the equals (GazChap), compare the bit
before (PLAYERNAME) to your list of variables to find out where it
goes, and then set that variable to the bit after (GazChap).

That sounded a lot more complicated than I intended. Unfortunately I
don't have any examples to hand, nor can I remember enough Blitz to
just write an example here. Never mind, I'm sure you can work it out.

Cheers,
GazChap.

Sounds like the assembly code that Blitz creates to calculate the address of an object is 
broken for this case:

shape number * sizeof.shape = 1024 * 32 = 32768

It seems likely that the Blitz code would use a word offset from an address register to 
calculate the address of the shape object. This word offset would be treated as a negative 
value by the CPU, causing the wrong address to be passed to GetAShape and would mean 
getashape would overwrite some memory that it should not.

Nothing you can do about that unless Bernd fixes it. If that really is the problem :)

Well, we still do not know if what I described was the real problem. InitShape before 
GetAShape is useless because GetAShape will initialise the shape objects.

The problem I described is within the code for Blitz, something which affects *all* 
objects in every library (if they are big enough or you use too many). The only way to 
fix it is to change the code that Blitz generates from word sized offsets to longword 
sized offsets.

As for the image include, I have not seen the code for it, but if it uses OS bitmaps then 
transparency should be no problem (since it would be easy enough to generate a mask and 
then use the OS functions for blitting with a mask - transparency).

You just need to convince someone to do the coding for it :)

There is a newer version that is probably released
soon with more features including transparency
for whatever color you want up to 24bit. Advantage to
Blitzshapes is that you dont have to take care
about the colourdepth. You can just load any
image (jpg, gif, iff) you want and blit it into a window.
Transparency is done but telling which colour should
be transparent, e.g.
load_imagem{0,"Myimage.jpg",$ff00ff}
would make $ff00ff transparent.

> is there a way to make them transparent?
> maybe when converting to blitz shape?
You can also convert them into blitzshape,
but you will have the same limited-number-problem.
there is a command 
image_loadshape{BlitzShapeNr.l,filename.s,transparent_rgb.l}
which can be used as direct replacement for "loadshape".
All needed colours will be allocated on the current screen
and the shape will be remapped if necessary.

BTW: Do you need them all simultaneously ?

Maybe people from the list can help you more
if you tell us for what purpose you need the
shapes. If it is a game on RTG screen the
image.include will be far better and FASTER than Blitshapes.
24bit is supported too.
If you need sound via AHI there is a new include replacing
the "sound statements" with sound via AHI,
e.g. AHI_loadsound {0,"mysound.aiff"}
AHI_playsound {0}
AHI_setpan {0,.3}; AHI_setvolume {0,.8}; AHI_setfreq {0,44100} etc.

Take a look at my HP (http://www.hd-rec.de/others.html) and
download ArTKanoid to see what is possible with the image/AHI.include.
You can try this game on WBscreen with any colourdepth. (16/24 bit
is the best of course) and on any AHI soundcard.

Problem so far i know with image include is that image_blitmask not work on
AGA/Chipset Screens only P96/CFX 

The Problem here is that for CGX every Mask bit is a pixel.Thats what guigfx
generate

But AGA need for every pixel and bitplane a mask bit so this seem a bug of
GUIGFX

So for 8 bitplanes you need read the maskbits that guigfx generate and make
8 bits out of it or better fix guigfx

I take a look of the guigfx SOurce.

After a long search i found a function call extractalphachannel
but i found no function in the Source How can this compile ?

Maybe someone who is familar with Amiga C can help here ?

C Source with his many files is a real mess and need a real profi to
understand Source

Hi Bernd,

The problem seems to be there is no way to specify to the CreatePictureMask_() 
function what the destination of you blit will be. So there is no way for it to 
know whether to create a mask bitplane which is suitable for interleaved bitmaps or 
not.

It would seem to be a lot easier to change the image_include code to check for 
interleaved screens and then create an interleaved mask from the guigfx bitmap or 
mask, than to change the guigfx source.

It is a function in the render.library

With the drawhandle it should be possible to create the alphamask its a
missed feature the reason is that the createpicturebitmap knows what bitmap
should be create so the createPictureMask can this know too.

Are you sure ? Blitzshapes (designed for OCS/AGA) use a mask (=cookie)
of only one bitplane.

Interleaved bitmaps (default type allocated on OS3.0) are different.

If you do not know, they are allocated so that the layout of the bitmap looks like this (for a 
bitmap with 3 bitplanes and 4 lines):

Plane 0 Line 0
Plane 1 Line 0
Plane 2 Line 0
Plane 0 Line 1
Plane 1 Line 1
Plane 2 Line 1
Plane 0 Line 2
Plane 1 Line 2
Plane 2 Line 2
Plane 0 Line 3
Plane 1 Line 3
Plane 2 Line 3

A normal bitmap looks like this BTW:

Plane 0 Line 0
Plane 0 Line 1
Plane 0 Line 2
Plane 0 Line 3
Plane 1 Line 0
Plane 1 Line 1
Plane 1 Line 2
Plane 1 Line 3
Plane 2 Line 0
Plane 2 Line 1
Plane 2 Line 2
Plane 2 Line 3

Normally you can create a 1 bitplane mask, which has the same size as a single bitplane from 
the bitmap, and apply it to the three separate blits of planes 0, 1 and 2. However, with 
interleaved bitmaps you cannot create the same single bitplane mask (or if you do, you must 
stretch it by the depth). This allows you to blit an image using one blit instead of one for 
each plane.

If someone would take a look at this and is willing to
do some changes I have a whish:
Images with a small height (<13 pixels) are not remapped
in colour, only gray. I dont know what causes this behavour
and I was not able do a workaround for this.
As the image.include if affected by this "bug" it can
be interesting not only for me.

Yes the blits.ab2 in examples dir of AB2.26 work only with correct mask if
chooses a AGA 2 color Screen.With 4 colors the mask is halfed. 

I look renderlib source maybe there is source in to do that maybe i can use
routines from the bitmap create routines.

I use AGA for all stuff where 256 colors are enough.Music Programming
workbench
The reason wy i use this are draggable screens i cannot miss it when
developing
When i single step a program i must see the program output and the
debugoutput.
Also to debug Interrupts or execeptions need in my Softsynth or reddebug the
hrtmon only run with AGA  
Also topaz 8 fonts are hard to read on non 704*280 screens 
ALso read text when scrolling is possible due to real vsync


In Facts:
To use all time CGX 3 Points i miss
1. Draggable Screen
2. Possible 704*280 resolution with 100 hz and 1280*1024 virtuel
3. hrtmon (Aminet)must run
4. Text must readable when scroll

Because AGA have this advantages i use it.In winuae AGA is 6* faster on 1GHZ
have 8MB Chipram.A 704*566 Bitmap with 256 colors and draw every frame
scroll with 23
fps
The displayroutines take always ca 500MHZ then.So if double CPU Power from 1
GHZ to 2 GHZ subtract the 500 MHZ from 2 GHZ you get 1,5 ghz CPU Power for
rest of UAE.A Athlon XP 2000+ is really 2*faster than my 1 GHZ p3

This mean in praxis that the 23 fps are then 69 fps

If i choose draw every second frame my 1 GHZ CPU scroll with 60 frames.Only
disadvantages is that a Mousepointer with 25 hz (same as mroocheck on real
AMiga)is not very smooth for my taste.

Also winuae have no hz Limit so only i do in CGX is imageprocessing 

Because I am a lazy boy i dont want switch resolutions all the time and its
good for health if use 85*30 Character Screens  

I not like that all newer systems anounced have so much feature losses even
if there is a open Source AGA Emulation out that is on nearly all systems
faster than real AGA have more ram and no refreshrate limits

Good idea: Here it is in new object format.Best is add it as first line in
your code
The macro i add then in the all.res in the next release so it is available
in instructionhelp and shorthelp too.

Macro version ;{version} add a standard amiga Version String
BRA __version
Dc.b "$VER:"
Dc.b `1,0
Even
__version
End Macro 

!version {"myproggy 1.12"}

I dont know why, but using "BRA __version" gave me an Guru sometimes.
I used "JMP __version" instead and things were working fine.
Maybe it was a mistake by me, but using JMP is save in any case.

I have no idea wy.I had a crash too first because i forget wbstartup.
Does the crash happen when you execute a plugin program main program or when
you execute the version command ?

I dont remember, it was some time ago. I did not try

I've used the following syntax at the beginning of my programs with success.

version$    = "$VER: blabla 1.13b (2002-02-02"

I remember someone maybe had problems with doing because some other library
had version-strings and made this call obsolete, or am I wrong?

The problem is that string constants are not inserted at
th beginning of the executable even if
you type them at the begining. The librarie
code is inserted first. So if one of the
blitz libraries contains a version string this one will
be found instead of yours. This also means
your version string is found slower in larger executables,
but of course this works too if you dont use such a library.

Ciao,

Thilo

If a library have a version string let me know the lib.

Yes this is ok too if you know the trick.But with the !version macro you
need not know internals.I for ex. have develop the macro in 20
sec.Searching for the correct Version string syntax take me over 4 min

The new lib have lots of usefull function and there is a docu for it

I have try out.I use the example code in the attached docu and it dont work
with this enhance version

Example attached as test.ab2

Have someone a actual e-Mail of elmore ?

Please check this example.Make sure you use in *.ab2 format because libs
have diffrent tokens.It work on current 2.26 distri lib  but fail on the
new enhanced lib

Moreentries always terminate the loop

@NODE "mail_105" " Printing Problems - solved "
From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 02-07-14 11:58:37
Subject: @{b}Printing Problems - solved@{ub}

Hi there,

If anyone has followed the thread regarding my printing problems - I've solved
it, and thought I'd share.

To recap - I recently installed a Micronik Z2 board and CV64/3D. Since then,
Wordworth and Drawstudion have produced printouts that appeared "Smeared",
although other applications have printed fine.

Additional information:- The CV64/3D has no scandoubler. This appears to be
significant. Since I have no scandoubler, then at the moment, the Video slot
enabler on the Micronik board is redundant. As a last ditch attempt at solving
this, I removed it. Printing problems solved.

I don't know why only a couple of applications should have been affected, but
that's Amiga life.

I dare say that, as and when I get a scandoubler, th problem may recur (tho'
since I will have further H/W it may not), but I'll quit worrying about it 'til
then.

Thanks to those who replied with the various suggestions. In the end, I win the
prize :o)

All the best

In the latest version of ElmoreDosLib you will find the "Exec"
command, however for reasons stated by Dave it is not included in the
latest blitz distribution. I think its on the aminet. It is fairly
straight forward to use when you refer to the ElmoreDosLib.doc.
You could also try the OS lib "Execute" command. 
eg.

your_file$="file.exe"
Execute_ &your_file$, Peek.l(Addr File(0)),0

I have found a problem with that the entrycode entrydir tokens are on
diffrent place than all other elmoredoslib.So all my programs fail
wizard.bb2 in exmaple dir in distri fail too  

We also dont know what new commands it have no docu no source so we give it
up.
Have you docu for new instructions or source from it so we can merge the new
features to the existing source ?

first I tried execute_ com$,0,0 (without the &)

but &com$,0,0 works like a charm, thanks.

what is the & anyway?

& get the adress of com$ instead creating a temporary string code

This is a old BB2 problem maybe only & should allowed in OS Funktions others
give compiler error

Os Call Rename_ ("name1","name2") compile crap because temporal string space
is overwritten by the second string 

Rename_(a$,b$) compile also crap 

only 

Rename_(&a$,&b$) work

So in OS Functions only use & for acessing strings

Try:

DefType.TextExtent TE
char.l=TextFit_(rp,&text$,textlen,&TE,0,1,width,fontheight)

TextFit fills in that text extent, so you obviously need to give it some space to store the result. 
Since you need to provide the space, you must create a variable for it, not point elsewhere.

(General advice)
Remember that things that are pointed to should match up. Even if you were using the second 
TextExtent (the on you set to 0), which is the one where you can specify a size into which the text 
must fit, it is a pointer to a TextExtent not a RastPort.

Date: 10-22-02 22:01:57
Subject: @{b}textlength_ problems@{ub}

Greetings,

I'm writing a text reader that uses proportional fonts and have a problem with the following function:

Function.l fittext {rp.l,text$,width.w}  ; rp = rastport of window, text$ er, obvious, width = maximum width in pixels
  textlen.l=Peek.l(&text$-4) ;get length of text$ in chars
  value.l=textlen ;return value if text < width
  If TextLength_(rp,text$,textlen) > width 
    For i=0 To textlen ; scan entire line
      If Peek.b(&text$+i) = $20 ;look for spaces
        If TextLength_(rp,text$,i) <= width ;if space found and is within the width limit
          spacex=i ;store its position 
        Else
          value=spacex ;set return value, should be last space before text exceeds displayable width... 
          i=textlen ;exit for/next loop
        EndIf
      EndIf
    Next
  EndIf
  Function Return value
End Function

sometimes (usually if there is only 1 word left at the end of text$ after the calculation) it
returns a value that is longer than 'width', eg, when the string is displayed it over writes the 
window border...

This is the main display loop in the program:

  For i=1 To maxlines
    temp$=PeekTo$(filebuff+current,$0A) ;grab next line from the ram buffer
    len2.l=Peek.l(&temp$-4) ;get length

    If len2=0 ;deal with empty line...
      current+1
      If Peek.b(filebuff+current)<>$0A Then i-1 ;avoid double spacing...
      If i=1 AND Peek.b(filebuff+current)=$0A Then i-1 ;ignore empty lines at top of page...
    Else
      JSR tab2space ; quick destroy tabs routine, needs work :(

      endofline.l = fittext {rp,temp$,cwidth}

      If column=0 ;text is displayed like a book, in 2 columns...
        Move_ rp,10,barh+10+(fontheight*i)
      Else
        Move_ rp,410,barh+10+(fontheight*i)
      EndIf
      Text_ rp,temp$,endofline 

      current + endofline+1 set start point for next line...

    EndIf

    If current>=filelen Then i=maxlines:last=pnum ;check EOF
  Next

If anyone wants the entire source (beware, it's ugly atm) to look at, I'll email it privatly...

OK, not a solution (I can't see what's wrong :) but why don;t you use TextFit_ as the basis for 
your first calculation (to tell you how many charatcers fit into the width) and then cut it back 
to the nearest space?

It should be a lot quicker.
