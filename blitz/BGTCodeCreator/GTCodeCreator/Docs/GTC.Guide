@NODE readmefirst "***** Read Me First *****"

This is a very early  BETA version of the Gadtools Source Code Creator for Blitz Basic
v2.1.  Its still in the early stages with lots of functions still to be added .(See
@{"To Do List" LINK "updates"})

All fucntions should work on thier own except for the requesters.  They require the
Reqtools.library to be copied to @{i}sys:Libs@{ui}. (Use installation script)

@ENDNODE

@NODE introduction "Introduction"

A while ago now when I was first learning blitz 2.1 I realised how tedious it was to
get the exact positions for the Gadgets in the windows.  So i thought 'wouldn't it be
great if you could use the mouse to create a GUI?'

I then started work on the very first version of this program for use for myself.
It was only designed to get the poistions for me and all tags and extras could be added
afterwards.

Not long afterwards I thought other people could benefit from this program so I
started work on adding extras to the program itself.  A next version was created for
release into the Public Domain as freeware.

@NODE information "Information"

This version of GT Code Creator is BETA and has been tested on the following computers: -

@{i}68030, 40MHz FPU, 16mb FAST RAM, 2.1 GB HDD, WB 3.1, AGA
68030, 40MHz, 2mb FAST RAM, 2.1 GB HDD, AGA
Windoze PC running WinUAE <---Had problems!@{ui}

I need your help if GT Code Creator is going to continue development.  I need people
to get registered.  To be registered all you need to do is do some testing for me.  Just
use the program and tell me what you think.  If you find any bugs please tell me through
@{"e-mail" LINK address} or through a letter (see @{"Address" LINK address}.  You will
then get a registration code from me ok.  Just put this in the registration code box in
the registration program.  You will then be able to get rid of the information window,
when you first load the program, through the tooltype located in the icon.

Their are a few errors known so far that I am currently fixing.  For more information
go to the @{"errors" LINK errors} page.

Their are still lots of functions to be added to the program.  Any registered user will
automatically get free updates from the aminet.  For more information go to the
