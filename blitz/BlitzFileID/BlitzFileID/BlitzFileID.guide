  BlitzFileID is a conversion of Oliver @{i}"Bloodrock" @{ui}Lange's
  FileID.library for use in @{b}@{fg shine}Blitz Basic@{ub}@{fg text}.

  Everything you need to perform file identification
  is in this archive (except for the fileid.library itself,
  which is on Aminet in @{fg shine}util/libs/FIDLib80.lha@{fg text}).

  Now you won't have to find awkward ways of telling if a
  particular file is of the type you need - you just
  include some simple functions which will tell your
  program what type of file you're trying to use.

@node "install" "Installation"

  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Installation@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  You'll need the FileID.library installed to start with.
  Get it on Aminet in @{fg shine}util/libs/FIDLib80.lha@{fg text}.

  Then just copy the @{"FileID.library1" link "contents" 0} file into your
  Blitzlibs:amigalibs/ drawer.

  A word of @{fg shine}warning@{fg text} : the library's ID number is set
  to 213.

  You may find that the source won't tokenise (change
  the @{fg fill}colour@{fg text} of the commands Blitz understands) on your
  particular setup. If this happens, get @{fg shine}BlitzLibMan@{fg text}
  from Aminet in dev/basic/ . It will tell you which
  other library is numbered 213 and allow you to change
  one of them to a different number (make sure you read
  the guide supplied with it first!).

  Otherwise, just backup (important!) and remake your
  deflibs file. This can be done either with the
  @{fg shine}makedeflibs.bb2@{fg text} program supplied with Blitz, or using
  the aforementioned BlitzLibMan.

  Then you can run Blitz and load up the @{"BlitzFileID.bb2" link "contents" 0}
  program.

  @{i}Make sure you read the instructions in the source!

@node "use" "Usage"

  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Usage@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  Well, most of this is covered in the @{fg shine}BlitzFileID.bb2@{fg text}
  source file, so there won't be much detail here ;)

  Here are the functions (and a statement) available in
  this release (taken straight from source file, so it'll
  make more sense to read it in there ;)

  @{fg shine}CheckLib {}@{fg text}         - Checks availability of any library.

  @{fg shine}RecTypes {}@{fg text}         - Number of file types known by the
                        fileid.library.

  @{fg shine}AllocFileInfo {}@{fg text}    - Allocates FI_FileInfo structure, ie.
                        set library up to examine file(s).

  @{fg shine}ExamineFile {}@{fg text}      - Examines file (duh)...will return
                        an error code if something's wrong.

  @{fg shine}GetError {}@{fg text}         - Returns FileID's built-in error string,
                        using the value from ExamineFile {}.

  @{fg shine}GetCustomError {}@{fg text}   - Returns programmer's own error string,
                        using the value from ExamineFile {}.

  @{fg shine}FileTypeNumber {}@{fg text}   - File type ID number, eg. #FID_LHA,
                        which is 71 - an LHA archive. The values
                        are listed in BlitzFileIDIncs.bb2.

  @{fg shine}FileTypeName {}@{fg text}    - File type name, eg. "ZIP archive".

  @{fg shine}TypeFromNumber {}@{fg text}  - Returns file type string from number.
                       You supply a valid fileid.library
                       ID number, and it'll return the file
                       type string.

  @{fg shine}FreeFileInfo {}@{fg text}    - Free FI_FileInfo structure allocated
                       by AllocFileInfo {}. MUST be called
                       before program ends!

  @{i}Make sure you read the instructions in the source!

  If you have any questions or comments, write to
  me at :

  @{fg shine}jamesboyd@all-hail.freeserve.co.uk@{fg text}

  The link below will run @{b}@{fg shine}YAM@{ub}@{fg text} and set it up with
  my address :) - don't click if YAM's already
  running though ;)

  @{"jamesboyd@all-hail.freeserve.co.uk" system "yam:yam MAILTO jamesboyd@all-hail.freeserve.co.uk SUBJECT BlitzFileID.lha"}

  If FileID.library doesn't recognise a particular
  type of file, contact @{fg shine}Oliver Lange@{fg text} (see the FID80.lha archive
  on Aminet for contact details), and maybe he'll add it to FileID.library.
  I can't do anything about unrecognised files!
