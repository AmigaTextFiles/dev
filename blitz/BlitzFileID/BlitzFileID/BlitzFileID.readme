Short:    File identification for Blitz Basic
Author:   James L Boyd
Uploader: jamesboyd@all-hail.freeserve.co.uk
Type:     dev/basic
Requires: Blitz Basic (duh), FileID.library

This archive contains (nearly) all you need to
perform file identification using fileid.library
in Blitz Basic.

You'll need to have FileID.library on your system
to use it - get it from Aminet in util/libs/FIDLib80.lha.

(Note that if the version changes, the number in that filename 
will probably change slightly!)
