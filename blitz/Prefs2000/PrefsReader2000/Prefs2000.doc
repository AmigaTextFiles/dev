PREFS READER 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program is a preference file reader, modifier and saver
for Blitz Basic.. The main guts consist of 5 statements and
functions.. 

Disclaimer
~~~~~~~~~~
I`m not resposible for any data-loss, dead pets or world takerovers
this program may cause... Fuck the legal shit!. You heard it all before!
The pregram should be ok anyway,.. but use it at your own risk!

What it does
~~~~~~~~~~~~
It allows you to read in a prefs file, and search for a prefs
variable (any line),.. It allows you to comment that code and
not lose the comments when the prefs are saved,.. And all this
VERY VERY easily. Note: all commented code (`;') in the prefs
file will be ignored at all areas!

Structure
~~~~~~~~~
The best way to use this system is to:

 1, Read in prefs file (ReadPrefs{})
 2, Search for your values (SearchPrefs{})
 3, Modify your valuse (ReplaceEntry{})
 4, Save your prefs (SavePrefs{})

Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~
FUNCTION: ReadPrefs{PrefsFileLoc$}
 RETURNS: False if prefs couldn`t be read, Otherwise True.
    INFO: Loads in a preference file to: Prefs().
          Also the `BaseCount' variable will hold the amount of lines
          in the loaded preference file after you use this Function.
          PrefsFileLoc$ is the location on disk of the prefs file!
 EXAMPLE: If ReadPrefs{"Work:Prefs.prefs"}=True Then


FUNCTION: SearchPrefs{SearchString$}
 RETURNS: This function returns a the value of your searched string!
    INFO: SearchString$ is the name of the section you want to search
          for in the previously read preferences!
          NOTE: If a value could not be obtained for the section
                you specify, then this function will return ""
                (an empty string, [Nothing])
 EXAMPLE: GameSpeed=Val(SearchPrefs{"Game Speed"})


STATEMENT: ReplaceEntry{SearchString$,Value$}
     INFO: SearchString$ is the section you wish to search for,..
           Value$ is the value you want to change it to.
           This will change an entry in the prefs.
  EXAMPLE: ReplaceEntry{"Game Speed",Str$(GameSpeed)}
     NOTE: This Statement should really be a function and should
           return a fail or success, but I`m too lazy :)


FUNCTION: SavePrefs{PrefsFileLoc$}
 RETURNS: False if couldn`t be saved, True otherwise.
    INFO: PrefsFileLoc$ is the file to save as.
          Saves your prefs to disk!
 EXAMPLE: If SavePrefs{"Work:Prefs.prefs"}=True Then 


STATEMENT: NukePrefs{}
     INFO: This clears the current prefs, (Just for novelty :) ).
  EXAMPLE: NukePrefs{}
