						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

@NODE "mail_0" " Arexx "
From: Steven Croy <Steven@...>

Subject: @{b}Arexx@{ub}

Hello blitzers

I'm having a few difficulties with the RWE Arexx lib and I wondered if
anybody could help.  I've managed to set up my arexx port and can recieve
messages. The problem is when I try to send messages to another arexx port.
(ie the mp3 player Amplifier) When I use 

RXSendCommand "AMPLIFIER.1","PLAY" everything is ok.

When I use 
OriginalVol$ = RXSendCommand ("AMPLIFIER.1","VOLUME")
I get the volume in OriginalVol$. But the problem is setting the volume. At
a shell I would use:
rx "ADDRESS AMPLIFIER.1 VOLUME 20"

But when in Blitz I try
a$=RXSendCommand ("AMPLIFIER.1","VOLUME 20")

or even

rexxmsg.l = RXCreateMsg
RXSetArg rexxmsg,1,"VOLUME"
RXSetArg rexxmsg,2,"30"
RXSendMsg rexxmsg,"AMPLIFIER.1"

My program just locks up. I can still use my computer but my Arexx port
won't respond anymore. Can anyone help?

Thanks
Steven Croy

First off, dump the RWE Arexx...It`s buggy and has caused me many lock ups 
and crashes, I`ve since reverted back to the old Acid Arexx lib and although 
it`s not as neat as using the RWE one, it`s stable (apart from typos in the 
code I write..ahem)

simple..(well, using the acid rexx lib)..send the whole lot as a "string 
file"..ie, as an Arexx one liner

s=sendrexxcommand rexxmsg,"VOLUME 20",#RXFF_RESULT|#RXFF_STRING|#RXCOMM

then the usual wait for reply routine.

Thanks for the advice, I've got my code converted to the original Blitz lib
and it's all working now.

Hi,

Theres a LotanArray Lib which can be used to replace blitz arrays

@NODE "mail_4" " Arrays "
From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 08-26-01 02:57:24
Subject: @{b}Arrays@{ub}

Hello all,

Just a quickie. Is there a maximum size for arrays in Blitz (standard and list
arrays).

eg. Would Dim array(1000000) or Dim List array(1000000) work . I want to set
4 arrays in a program whose maximum size is determined by the user
(each of the four will be the same size) via tooltypes, but I want to know what
level to set my error checking at.

It is quite feasible that some users would wish to define a very large maximum
(perhaps not a million, yet, but they could at some point in the future)

All the best
 

Steve

Well I`m sure it would work, though I reckon the limit would be the size of a
long type. But in an earlier thread it has been found out that if you dim an
array greater than a word the debugger gives an error, so switch it off
before(like runerrsoff code.... runerrson).

C=4 arrays in a program whose maximum size is determined by the user
C=(each of the four will be the same size) via tooltypes, but I want to know
C=what
C=level to set my error checking at.

The size of a long type I`d say.

You might try using the DLL stuff, it`s a bunch of code to make dynamic linked
lists(dynamic list array). It`s a bit of work to get into but after that it`s
easy to use.

@NODE "mail_6" " AslPathRequest$ "
From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 08-11-01 16:13:57
Subject: @{b}AslPathRequest$@{ub}

Hello all,

Just a quicky:-

When I call AslPathRequest$ for a second time in a program, the path buffer
doesn't seem to have been flushed, so the previous result is added.

eg

Maxlen aslpath$=192
maxlen a$=192

a$=AslPathRequest$("Choose a path",aslpath$)

----------
    DH0: selected, result a$="DH0:"
----------

a$=""
a$=AslPathRequest$("Choose a path",aslpath$)

---------
    DH1: selected, result a$="DH0:DH1"
---------

Even if I add aslpath$="", it doesn't help.

Is this a bug, and is there a fix, or am I doing something obviously wrong?

Obviously, I can't strip the previous result from a$, since this could destroy
an expanded path. eg, if DH0: is selected the first time, and DH0:prefs is
selected the secind time, there is a chance that the second path would be
reduced to "prefs", IYSWIM.

All the best



Steve.

I had the exact same problem and I can't remember for the life of me what I
did to get around it.

I think there MIGHT be a flag for the normal ASL File Requester that makes
it drawers only, but I think I might have just used RTEZPathRequest
(reqtools.library required).

If you move the code to a separate procedure (statement or function), and call
that procedure each time you need to get input, it seems to work. Not ideal, but
what the hell, it gets the job done :o)

That's because the strings are local variables and are created/destroyed 
each time you call the function. Nice hack :)

I'd watch out for Enforcer hits though - IIRC the ASL library is a bit 
dodgy (as you've already seen).

Yeah, I'd figured out that was why it worked, but I still assume that the
command itself must have a buffer, that whilst it is treated as local to the
procedure, should be cleared each time it is called anyway, and apparently isn't being.

If it was down to a bug in ASL library, I'd expect to have seen the same behaviour in
other apps before. I can only assume it's a bug in the blitz handling of the
library.

>DM I'd watch out for Enforcer hits though - IIRC the ASL library is a bit

Hmmm. Well, I use MagicASL here, which patches the ASL library anyway, and you'd
assume should clear up any bugs. In any event, I don't check for ENforcer hits
with my code. I trust Blitz...........some people (me) are so trusting it
beggars belief :o)

Besides, although up to 5000 calls to AslPathRequest are a /possibility/ in the
util, I wouldn't expect more than 1 or 2 in normal use.

From: MadGun68 <madgun68@...>
Date: 08-22-01 12:19:38
Subject: @{b}Bizarre compiling problem@{ub}

Hi all!

I finally got some of my source code moved over to the new machine, and I was starting off with compiling my library. Instant road block.

Creating the object seems to work just fine, but that is where the problems begin. If I attempt to use one of the commands in the module, I get a syntax error (which it shouldn't be doing.) I've also noticed that, while there are over 40 commands in the library, it's only letting the first 8 be used.

If I use the library tool from Richard Elmore, it shows 40 commands (even if I compile in more.. They never appear.) Using my own library tool, I only show the 8 I have access to.

Anyone seen anything like this before?

Thanks,
Steve

Do you have the library compiled into the deflibs file or are you using 
the userlibs directory in the Blitz2: assign? It sounds like it's got 
confused between two different copies of the library, or other libraries 
with the same libnumber.

In my experience the blitz2:userlibs directory never worked properly, I 
always had to remake the deflibs file when trying out new versions of 
libraries I had written.

Also, are you using WinUAE? Some versions have some real stupid problems 
with the filesystem, writing files to random locations, or not over-
writing files (thats in directory mode, not hardfiles).

I've compiled the deflibs, and I've tried it with/without the blitzlibs:
assign. No dice.

Yeah, I did remake it. Both with my tool and the other. I tried using the
older one, but it crashed during the process.

Nope. This is a A1200/040. Strangely enough, this actually works under
WinUAE. I've almost got the impression that it isn't compiling the library
properly. (If I add/remove commands from the library, the filesize stays the
same.)

Perhaps the blitz I've got is boogered up. I didn't install my floppies, I
found a newer setup in my travels and downloaded it.

In that case, the obvious question: have you tried deleting the library 
and then re-compiling?

You sure it isn't a demo version that you have installed then? The demos 
don't actually create executables.

I don't use in that resolution, but you could try Helvetica13 (might be a 
bit thin though). If you like that, try downloading XHelvetica, it is a 
bit nicer looking.

Or get a decent sized monitor ;)

Well the gadgets and text and things all default to topaz8 and I don't 
think there is any way to change it. I've been trying to get all the bits 
I need to recompile the debugger source, but RWE made some additions to 
some acidlibs and didn't include them anywhere. And of course the source 
is saved tokenised, so I can't figure out what some of the ????? commands 
should be.

Hello !

I think topaz 8 for the sourcecode is just fine.
I use 1200x900 resolution, and it is great because
I don`t have to scroll horizontal even with .xxx labels.
The moe text yu have at once, the fast you can code.
I ywould try to get as much text on the screen as possible.
I don` know what monitor siez you use, I use 19" and it
is just find. 1024x768 should work nice under a 17".

I have "fixed" the debugger problem using thinpaz 8
as my system standard font . It looks much nicer than
topaz 8 and the debugger doesn`t get confused.
(For the source I prefer topaz 8)

But I think everybody has another opiniton because
it is a bit an esthetik question.

Skidmarks! (and SuperSkidmarks, etc). Bubble Heroes (the recent game) was 
too I think. Or perhaps it was Bust-A-Move (or is that something else?)? 
Oh, and that Charlie Chimp crap that won the Amiga Format game competition 
(instead of Worms - hahahahahahah!!!). Foundation was too. There have been 
a few others, but I don't think it's something people normally let on about 
and I can't remember any others.

You could include the Blitz PD disks, I mean they weren't huge, but some of 
the games were good fun. And I guess if you have any back copies of Amiga 
Format, the Readers Wives (or was that Games? ;) section normally mentioned 
what each game was written in. Curt Esser put a lot of effort into Crazy8's 
(his card game in Blitz) and it's a good quality piece of software.

IIRC Mark Sibly used Blitz to prototype Gloom and Guardian, but then wrote 
the actual games in ASM once he got the basic thing working.

Pagan were using Blitz to write Dafel, but I reckon they're not using it 
any more. Counterstrike (from BlueBlack) also started in Blitz but again, 
they're not using it any more.

There's also a slew of promising but unfinished games on Aminet dev/basic. 
And I guess you could check out the Blitz Developer site at 
http://home.freiepresse.de/jubee/BBLIST_E.HTM and see if any of those 
projects are still going on.

BlitzBombers
Star Woids (I think I have the name correct.. The Lucas folks did not
approve.)

I got to about 90% on my game before I dropped out. I'm going to finish it,
but I doubt I'll bother releasing it (Old arcade game.. With mame being out,

Subject: @{b}BlitzPC question (I know its to the wrong list!)@{ub}

Hi,

First of all, how do I sub to the main BlitzPC list? The official site
appears to be gone, redirecting me to blitz3d.co.uk (which looks damn
interesting! :)

Secondly, I can't seem to get the following code to do anything:

-----------------------------------------------
Const Grav#=0.1
YSpeed=0 : X=320 : Y=240

If KeyDown(208) ;208 being the down arrow key
  YSpeed=YSpeed-Grav
Endif

Y=Y+YSpeed
DrawImage ply,X,Y
-----------------------------------------------

(cropped a bit to save space, the relevant Graphics/Flip/LoadImage commands
etc. are all there)

Everything works if I change Grav to a number higher than 0.5 (0.501 even)
and when I press the down arrow, the image moves down the screen.

But as soon as I set it to 0.5 or lower, or even set it to 1 and tell it to
do Yspeed=Yspeed-(Grav/2) it refuses to work, and just sits there on the
screen.

I've also just noticed after putting a bit of info at the top of the screen
to tell me the values of the various X/Y things, that the minimum it will
take away is an integer value - is it possible to do the maths with values
below 1?!?! Surely it is!

Cheers,
GazChap.

Get the Executive archive. There's a small util provided with it (you don't need
to register or install Executive) called Kill, which works like break, but lets
you specify a name rather than a CLI number. (I use it a lot to stop MPega
started as a default viewer using NIL: - eg. Kill Mpega.

alternatively, something like XOpa will let you see, remove etc. all tasks and
give the appropriate CLI numbers.

The CLI command "status" will do that, but I cannot remember exactly how it 
used to work.

I think it is "status process <option>" but I cannot remember the option :(

BTW, is this CLI command started by execute_() started by the same program 
you are using to break the command? If it is, you must be using run in the 
CLI command so that execute_ does not stop your program. And the run 
command will usually give you the CLI number (although it might require you 
to use the output filehandle of the execute_ command).

Well, from the CLI you can do this:  break `status com=<processname>`
I don't know if that will work properly inside of the Execute_ function
though, you might have to use the status command separately to get the
process ID and then use that with the break command.

Hope this helps,

Hi all,

Anyone noticed this before?

If you poke $7FFFFF0 into a quick variable and print it, you get 
2047.9998 but if you poke in $7FFFFFF you get 2047 exactly? Even fiddling 
with the format string doesn't help. So is this just a rounding problem 
in Blitz's printing commands?

Hi all !

Does anyone know a how to print a Text into
a window while the text can be clipped on the left & right
side (maybe from top and bottom too).

I have a cerain rectangle on my window and I want
to print someting in it, but the result should be
only visible in the defined rectangle and not overwrite
some stuff that lies outside this rectangle.


     _________________
     |
     |
xxx | yyy     - Text
     |
     |________________  - Rectangle

Only yyy should be visible, but the command sould look
like clipprint {"xxxyyy",x.l,y.l,rec_x.l,rec_y.l,rec_width.l,rec_height.l}

Remember that letters should be splitted pixelwise too, not
only complete letters.

Ciao,

You need to use layers.library. Here's a piece of code from my Viewfonts 
program which does it:

DEFTYPE.Rectangle myrect ; Bounds of a rectangle which encloses preview
DEFTYPE.Region *new_region, *old_region ; Two regions, used for clipping
                                        ; the text to the Rectangle
DEFTYPE._RastPort *mycliprp ; The rastport with the clipping region set

; Address of rastport in window, I suppose you could use RastPort(x)
*mycliprp = *e\_window\RPort

; Set up boundaries for clip region, taking origin from top left
; of window.
myrect\MinX = *e\_window\BorderLeft + 4
myrect\MinY = *e\_window\BorderTop + y1
myrect\MaxX = *e\_window\Width - *e\_window\BorderRight - 4
myrect\MaxY = myrect\MinY + y2 - y1

; Create a new region, and if successfully created, set the bounds of it
; (from rectangle)
*new_region = NewRegion_
If *new_region
  ; I think this creates the mask for the clipping
  If OrRectRegion_(*new_region, &myrect)
    *old_region = InstallClipRegion_(*e\_window\WLayer, *new_region)

    ; ALL graphics.library COMMANDS ARE NOW CLIPPED!!
    ; I used graphics.library things to print my text just to make sure,
    ; for example:
    ;SetRast_ *mycliprp,..... ; to clear the clipped area of the rastport
    ;Move_ *mycliprp,x,y  ; Move graphics cursor to position
    ;Text_ *mycliprp,&text$,Len(text$) ; Draw text

    ; Restore old clipping region and free the newer one.
    *new_region = InstallClipRegion_(*e\_window\WLayer, *old_region)
    FreeScreenDrawInfo_ *e\_screen,*sdi:*sdi=0
  End If
  DisposeRegion_ *new_region
  *new_region = 0

I don't remember anything that severe in the RKRMs but I could be wrong :)

Anyway, I made a mistake in the original posting, you only actually use 
InstallClipRegion from layers.library, which makes use of regions 
(created using graphics.library) and are separate from dealing with 
layers (although you need an existing layer, such as what a window has, 
to use it). AFAIK that's the only way to do clipped graphics through the 
OS.

Hello amorel

I tried it and this metod is very fast. No speed loss
compared to a simple NPrint. I see no other
solution to do this except my old way:
Printing to a bitmap and move only the
part I wantred to the window rastport. But
that was 10 times slower than this solution
(at least on my system) because of c2p conversions.

I have looked up the bit of text I meant:

Warning:
--------

Layers may not be created or used directly with intuition screens. Intuition
windows are the only supported method of adding layers to Intuition screens.
Only the layer locking and unlocking functions are safe to use with Intuition.
An application must create and manage its own view if it will be creating
layers directly on the display.

End quote.

My interpretation of this is that ione can/may only create layers by creating
windows, thus indirectly. Though as I read it now I think it might mean that u
can/may only create layers through your window. But what about only using
lokcing and unlocking functions?

Why this warning had been written I don`t know though.

Ahh, I seen that, but didn't think it was what you meant :)

Yes, you can create layers over your own windows as much as you like, but 
to add a layer to a screen you should open a window. So you are doing it 
indirectly for screens, but you can do it directly for windows.

I guess the warning is like that because screens need to be shared 
between different programs, and so intuition needs to take care of 
redrawing the screens. Windows are generally owned by your own program 
(and normally only one program) so you can do anything you like to them.

Locking and unlocking layers I'm not sure about, but they don't create 
any layers. They only make sure that only one task is writing to a layer 
at any time (which I guess helps in some possible race/deadlock 
situations, although I'm not sure what they'd be).

But it doesn't really matter, it was only the clipping area of the layer 
I was changing, not creating any layers :)

Subject: @{b}Crashing - Help Needed@{ub}

Hi There...

I've just got around to reinstalling Blitz Basic after a long time away
from it, and it's misbehaving.  Well, Ted is misbehaving.

I've installed everything, and when I ran BB, everything was fine -
only problem was that I had a Ted which was somewhat basic, and didn't
support 'save as ASCII'.  Along came Ted 2.23 from BUM10, I installed it,
and it worked fine.  I reset, and ever since it hasn't worked.  I can
replace it with the old Ted 1.1, and it's fine, but Ted 2.23 just doesn't
want to work.

I've tried deleting the Ted prefs, but that doesn't make any
difference.

Can anyone help me out?  I can't figure out what's going wrong!  The
crashes vary - sometimes nothing happens, sometimes I see a black
screen, sometimes I see some screen corruption, but lots of time I
just get a reboot.


Bablos.

It is, but not on that site, and that archive is only an update for the 
BSS SuperTed :)

Bablos, you can either get SuperTed2.24 from Aminet or http://www.blitz-
2000.co.uk or you can download the BSS from 
http://www.gmcminn.btinternet.co.uk/archives/software/bss.lha (1.3Mb!!) 
and then the patch from 
http://www.gmcminn.btinternet.co.uk/archives/patches/superted252.lha.

I think I might upload the new site design tonight, so at least people 
don't need to keep guessing at the actual site behind the blitz-
2000.co.uk domain :)

The installer for BSS isn't nice - it gets up to creating acidlibs and
then completely crashes - multi coloured interference on screen.  When
I check what's going on in SnoopDOS, it's doing the rounds of my Blitz2:
subdirectories at the time, for some reason.

Any ideas what's up with it this time?

Not sure. I just copied all the BSS stuff off the CD, the install script 
worked for me OK. And I had checked it by using the files in the archive, 
and that was OK too.

* You have already got a working Blitz setup with Blitz2: and Blitzlibs: 
assigns?
* Before you ran the installer script for BSS did you assign BSS1, BSS2 
and BSS3 to the three BSS directories?
* And when asked to insert the BlitzCD you cancelled each time (should 
only appear 3 times at the start of the script)?

What options did you choose as you were installing it?

Does it crash after it tells you that it is installing the REDBlitzLibs?

Or is it after the debugger is installed, and it runs makedfelibs? If you 
have mildred installed, then it could be that and you should copy the 
makedeflibs from the Mildred archive (it should be on the b2k site 
separately) over the BSS makedeflibs.

I just tried it again on my system here and it all went OK. If you can 
answer some of the questions above, we might be able to narrow it down a 
bit more.

Hex$ converts a decimal number to a string containing the 
equivalent value in Hex digits e.g.  255 -> "FF"

To convert Hex C2 to the decimal equivalent do a.l = $C2

The leading $ means that the number following is in hex.  % means 
binary (a.l = %11000010 would do the same as a.l = $C2)

Ok, now I got a new problem.
How would I use the resulting string in a command which doesn`t accept
strings. Like: putserial output$

Putserial $3c for example does work. How do I put the string in a form which
will be accepted? Putserial $output$ doesn`t work, for example.

Well, midi messages are mainly written in hex codes. Thus it`s handiest to

If you just want to transmit the *numeric* *value*, just send the number. 
You don't need to convert it to hex. A number is the same no matter what 
base it is in.

If you do actually have to send a *string* with the hex representation of 
a number in it, you'll need to use whatever command there is for sending 
strings, or send it one character at a time manually if there isn't one 
(which I doubt).

What if you use this: 144+midi(1)\channel  ? Will that work?

Better way of looking at it: 90 + 1 is not the same as 9+1.

putserial $9+midi(1)\channel won't work because $9 is 9 decimal. However,
putserial $90+midi(1)\channel might work. Then again, you can convert $90 to
144 and go from there.

Blitz does seem to allow the mixing of hex and decimal on the same line, so
I guess it would work wither way. Give it a shot.

I know, sorry, bit-heads who think in binary tend to forget that

Have you tried this with small sample files? I don't think Blitz has a

Perhaps the limit is 64k, although this seems like a bit of a strange size 
for the way I am thinking the arrays could be accessed in ASM.

I remember seeing an email to do with problems with Dim List in my Blitz 
folder at university, I'll check it tomorrow to see if it is relevant to 
this.

Hmm, I'm really stumped about this :(

Yeah me too. I tested it with dim and dim list of various sizes and types and
it sure complained at >64k. That`s just very lame. I can`t imagine why the
heck this can`t be limited by memory instead of 64k. 

I tried the dll and it did not complain but also drew an empty sample window.
Don`t know if it`s related. But dll is so freaking slow(I`d say 100 times as
slow as normal array), I gotta fill the array with the sounddata in a loop and
cant use copymem_ afaik.

You're right, I just checked. If you Dim and array which is >=65536 items 
(NB items, not bytes), you get an error saying "Array Dimension out of 
Range". If you dim an array with 65535 and try to access the first item, 
you get an "array subscript out of range".

I wrote a small test program and disassembled it. The way the Blitz 
executables work, there does not need to be a limit to the size of arrays 
because it uses a longword for the index (shifted left to get the correct 
size for each item) and adds that to the address of the array (using an 
ADD instruction, not an addressing mode).

Actually, I've just tested another exe, with a newtype, and it uses the 
68k multiplication instructions to work out the position in the array. 
And these only multiply a word by a word to get a longword result, so the 
maximum index you can use with newtype arrays is 65535. However, it 
should have been written a bit better than than (i.e. allow you large 
arrays for 2^n sized types and only 65535 for strange sized arrays).

You could get around this by making up a big newtype. So that would give 
you more range for your 65535 items, i.e.

NEWTYPE.sixteen
    values.b[16]   
END NEWTYPE

Dim mysample.sixteen(60000) ; <- can store 60000*16 bytes
CopyMem_ *mysound\_data,&mysample(0),*mysound\_length*2
for i=0 to *mysound\_length*2 ; OK, I couldn't remember your original 
loop :)
    idx2 = i mod sizeof.sixteen
    idx1 = i / sizeof.sixteen
    NPrint mysample(idx1)\values[idx2]
next

Alternatively you could allocate some memory and peeking from it to get 
the sample values to draw. Or perhaps one of the 3rd party libraries that 
have maths or matrix commands in it would be capable of doing this.

Yep, it's got to be slow because it's all written in basic. And you're 
right about copying in a loop.

I guess because of the newtype arrays using the multiplication instructions 
- that means with a newtype array you can only get 65535 items. I guess 
they either just made everything the same, or it's a mistake that simple 
arrays have this limit.

It might not actually be a limit. Remember, you'll only get this error when 
the debugger is enabled. When disabled, it should just go on and do it, but 
in this case it's not actually an error and so it will work :)

However, it might be good to get a hold of the source for this library and 
fix it. I wonder if it came with the BSS source...

Yes and no. If you have an "If" without an "EndIf", or the "EndIf" outside the
function (same with While-Wend,Repeat-Until,Select-Case-End Select etc.) then an
error will be produced of the type you are getting. Make sure that your "End
Select" occurs /before/ your "End Function"

This can also happen if you have something like:-

If /condition/

/    /Select /variable/
        Case 1

        Case 2
    EndIf

End Select

(EndIf and End Select reversed).

Check for any similar abnormalities in your code.

OK, if my_function really is a function, you need to call it with
a=my_function{}.


Otherwise, I'm stumped. If it had been a compile time error then it should be easy
enough, but I've just tried a couple of things to re-produce the error here, but
I couldn't.

Do you get the same problem using:

If
    a=my_function{}
else

etc.

If it's a blitz statement, there is a bug when passing 3 parameters. There's a

I replaced the Select with If (because I use only 1 case yet)
and the error did not occure.
Now I tracked the error down to the call of the Statement 
(it is not a function in the Blitz manner).

The Statement does nothing, it is the calculation of the
parameters which confuses Blitz. Must be an internal error
in blitz. Very strange...

I`ll check it out and post it when I have found the real
reason.

Yes I know and Ive installed.
But thats not the problem.

The problem is too "complex" calcultion when calling a statement.



The original piece of code that producted the bug:

draw_midi_refresh_a
{win,0,time1,yseek,time1,yseek+temp\view_midi[0-#v_note]+temp\view_midi[0-#v_vel]
-1}



and the code that produces no bug:

y2.l = yseek+temp\view_midi[0-#v_note]+temp\view_midi[0-#v_vel] -1
draw_midi_refresh_a {win,0,time1,yseek,time1,y2}


Btw. the statement does nothing.

I think this is one of the non-explainable Blitz Bugs, for that I hate
Blitz.

Thanks for your advice anyway,

Ciao,

It sounds like some kind of stack problem (although don't ask me why, it 
just does). It could be that Blitz stacks some registers to perform the 
calculation and then doesn't remove them afterwards.

I suppose it could also be a problem with some of the debugging code in 
one of the libraries, as with the array problem that Amorel had recently.

Disassembling the exe it creates for that kind of error, it looks like it 
gets the calculation completely wrong. Reads the array element from 
completely the wrong address (most likely a low memory address - hmm, 
that could be a problem I was having with some code). It does also look 
like it puts 4 longwords on the stack but only removes 2 of them.

From: Thilo Köhler <koehlerthilo@...>
Date: 08-17-01 19:23:26
Subject: @{b}GTScroller resolution@{ub}

I wonder if there is a bug/insufficency in the GTScroller
because of this behaviour(s):


1. Big values (>>64000) will confuse the
Scroller, it shows wrong sizes.
I guess there is a limit because uword was
used.


2. If I set e.g. visible to 1 and total to 8 and
top to 0, then the container shrinks to the
minimum size and you can not move it
when you click into the empty space below it.
You can only move it when clicking on the container
and move the mousepointer.
Is it because i have set top to 0 ?
Does the GTScroller count from zero or from 1 ?

Btw. I have installed the GTGadget fix.

Well, Blitz cannot use unsigned variables properly. The commands will treat 
numbers as unsigned, but if you try to print them using the Print command, 
you will see the negative number. Performing comparisons on variables also 
treats them as unsigned.

I will have a look at making the values for top, total and visible into 
longwords - it should be OK, as I think the OS uses tham as longwords.

It's because you have visible set to 1. I just tried it using nothing but 
the OS directly and it does the same thing, so that is not a bug in the 
Blitz library.

Not that I know of. I didn't change the GTScroller command at all (well, I

No, it is not possible. I just checked the gadtools autodocs, and the top, 
total and visible are all used as WORD's, so it is the gadtools.library 
which is limiting you to the range -32768 to +32767 (or maybe even only 0

I don't know. It doesn't seem to want to work by showing only 1 visible at 
each time. I'll write another test program in C and make sure it is not 
some problem with Blitz - I do not see why there should be any restriction 
like that.

But if I have the elements

0 - 1 - 2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7

Not for direct use with gadtools.library (since that is what GTCheckBox 
gadgets are for). And I do not think there is anything specific for the 
Blitz GTLib - all the flags I could find are in the updated guide file

Hi,

I am starting to delv into coding and with help have this bit of code.

I can see how "functions" are grouped together at the start and are not
invoked until called in the main routine.

However, I am confused at how to define one.

I am 99% sure that I am getting my priorities and terms wrong here but here
goes.

My piece of code doesn't really do much appart from print, so I guess it
could be left in the main piece of the code, but for the sake of the
excercise, how is it done?

.printtime
?????????    <----  What goes here?

  h = Hours
  m = Mins
  s = Secs

  Print "Logging data at time ",h, ":", m, ":", s
  Print " with time interval of ",tdelay.l," Seconds"

End ???????  <----- and here?



I just want this piece of code in the list.


During the discussion time was mentioned and I wanted to get the current
time from the machine.

The systemdate command was mentioned but WHERE do I find the listing of it
to even think about using it.

I have the ORIGINAL blitz2 books and the CD somewhere but I find it
pointless looking there as I don't understand the way they explain the
commands.  Or have I got it wrong?

(I am not having a go at you Budda - incase you are reading this)


Anyway, I sorted that part out and am happy with what I did, I just thought
I would keep up the way the program was written and put in a "function" to
pring the time.

Hi Andrew

> .printtime

This is called a label (you can also have them without the "." in front 
or a colon afterwards). You do not need one of these for a function. You 
would use a label for a subroutine, and use either Goto or Gosub to call 
it.

> ?????????    <----  What goes here?

If this is supposed to be the start of your procedure (procedure meaning 
either a statement or a function) then you either have:

Statement NameOfStatement{paramater list}

 -OR-

Function.type NameOfFunction{parameter list}

You use a statement when you do not need to return any value to wherever 
you called it (i.e. jumped to perform the code). A function will return a 
value with the type you specify (can be any of the simple types, i.e. .b, 
.w, .l, .q, .f or $/.s). This would be the result of your function. For 
example, say you had some mathematical forumla that you had to put in a 
function - you would obviously return the result of the calculation.

The name can be any unique name for it you want (i.e not the same as a 
command, variable, label or another procedure).

The parameter list is where you put variables to catch the values that 
are passed when the procedure is called. You specify a variable name and 
type for each parameter (you can have up to 6 parameters I think) 
separated by commas.

In the case for your code, you are only printing something out, so you 
are not returning anything. So you'd use a statement. It also looks like 
you would only need 1 paramete, but I'll stick some more in to make an 
example :)

Statement ShowTime{tdelay.l, foo.b, ar.w}
>   h = Hours
>   m = Mins
>   s = Secs
> 
>   Print "Logging data at time ",h, ":", m, ":", s
>   Print " with time interval of ",tdelay.l," Seconds"
> 
> End ???????  <----- and here?

The same as with your first line of your procedure, in this case it would 
be End Statement. If you had made this a function, it would be End 
Function.

Also with functions, you are returning a value, so you need to put 
"Function Return ..." where ... is replaced by the value you want to 
return as the result of this function.

Now, you would call your statement from your program by doing this:

  ShowTime{x, y, z}

This would jump to your procedure, run the code inside it and go back to 
the main program to after where you called the procedure. x,y,z are the 
values you want to pass. Those values of x,y,z will be available in the 
function by using the variables tdelay,foo,ar respectively.

If you were using a function, calling it would look like this:

  a=ShowTime{x,y,z}

x,y,z are the same as before, but when a function is called like this, 
the result of the function gets stored in the variable a.

It seems to be a Blitz command so I guess it should be in the manual 
somewhere (although I'm not sure about the original/first versions of the 
manuals). You're probably right about the way they explain things in the 
manuals though - normally very badly.

If you have the Blitz Support Suite, you can try pressing Right Alt + 
Help when the cursor is over the SystemDate command and you should get an 
AmigaGuide document explaining it. Alternatively you can try pressing 
Right Amiga + Help to get the original explanation (which would be the 
same as the one in the manual).

This depends on what you want to do.

There are two types of "functions" in Blitz; statements and functions. Both
do exactly the same job, except that functions can return a value.

End Statement

If you want to use functions. Then use Function and End Function. To make a
function return a value, use "function return <value>"

Is relly is that simple. To call the statement, use "statementname{}".
Functions will require you to give a varible for the return value. Something
like "b=functionname{}" will do.

Hope this helps.

Hi all,

I`m having trouble with creating displays using the display library commands. 
The trouble is with the flags field of the initdisplay command. I`m using 
#8bitplanes #smoothscrolling #dualplayfield #hires and #agacolours, but I 
don`t know which fetchmode value to use. What exactly does it mean and how 
will it affect the display?

The fetchmode was something introduced with the AGA chipset IIRC (or 
perhaps ECS). It changes the way data is accessed by the custom chips. 
Fetchmode 0 (the default, and the one in the OCS) accesses everything in 
sets of 2 bytes. Fetchmode 1 and 2 access things in blocks of 4 bytes, 
although there's a slight difference between the way they work. Fetchmode 
3 accesses everything in blocks of 8 bytes.

It should not affect the display too much if you do everything via the 
display library - all fetchmode calculations are taken care of by it.

The higher the fetchmode, the more bandwidth is given to the custom 
chips, so you'd want to use as high a fetchmode as possible. For example, 
with fetchmode 0, you'd need to use a narrow display with all 8 sprites 
enabled, but you'd get the full display with using fetchmode 3. I think.

Subject: @{b}Interesting TCP problem@{ub}

Hi Blitzers !!

I have an interesting problem, I can`t solve:

Entering this URL into an browser brings a file with a stock-number and some
datas:
"http://de.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?f=sl1d1t1c1ghpv&e=.csv&s=531200.DE
"

I wrote a little program to make this without any browser. It returns a file
too that is almost the same as with the browser but instead of the
stock-number there is a stock-symbol.

I cannot imagine where the difference between the two methods is !!!!!!!!!!

BTW: the bb2-code worked for a long time, until now. Can anybody show me,
what I made wrong ????

Hello Sven

I noticed that with some URLs (especially those
that have parameters with a "?" appended)
it is necessary to provide more information
about yourself than the HTTP-GET command.

A complete HTTP GET should look like this:

"GET "+doc.s
"HTTP/1.0"
"User-Agent: MyBlitzBrowser"
"Accept: */*;q=1"
"Host: "+host.s
"Pragma: no-cache"
"Referer: "+doc.s

Where every line has $0d$0a as return code.

Hope this helps,

Thilo

Keep in mind that the Event Message can be some

The command Qualifiers tells you which qualifier keys were pressed for 
the last event, but I'm not sure if this covers all types of event (i.e. 
it may only work for keypresses). But you can try it.

> Is there any posibility to get the

EMouseX and EMouseY should do that. (E stands for Event in those command 
names).

I triedQualifiers, but it gives a memory pointer back.
Maybe I have todo
qualif.l = Peek.l(Qualifier)

... but:

Before that I tried this, but I`m not shure if this is correct.
After I noticed an IDCMP Event with
"ev.l = WaitEvent" I do ...

  *win.Window = Peek.l(Addr Window(EventWindow))
  mx.l           = *win\MessageKey\MouseX
  my.l           = *win\MessageKey\MouseY
  qualif.l        = *win\MessageKey\Qualifier

But I`m not sure if this data belongs to the
IDCMP Event I read out with the Blitzcommand "WaitEvent"
Maybe Blitz reads out all pending IDCMP Events and queues them.
Then the above data may belong to one of the next IDMP Events ...

Any comment if this above is a good idea ?

Are you sure? I thought it was a longword which had bits set depending on 
the qualifiers. But I've just checked the help and it says Qualifier only 
deals with the key press events :/

IIRC there was an error with some of the Intuition commands, they were 
described wrongly in some of the help texts, and I'm sure there was one 
which was supposed to return a pointer but didn't or vice versa.

Probably not a good idea.

The WaitEvent command will do a Wait() and then GetMsg() to wait for a 
new intuition message and then remove it from the queue. I guess it then 
stores the important fields of the message (so that you can then use 
EventCode, GadgetHit, EventWindow etc) and then replies the message.

You could deal with the window messages using OS commands directly. It 
isn't that difficult.

I guess if it doesn't work by detaching the menus from the window (I 
can't remember how) and then setting them again, then you will have to re-
create the menu strip. It probably calls LayoutMenuItem_() for each menu 
item you create rather than just calling LoyoutMenus_() once when you 
attach them to a window.

Depends on what you mean. The MUI lib allows you to create all the MUI
object and set up notification code that allows your program to react to
button being pressed etc.

Using it you can even use custom classes (I think).

Look at the MUI demos in the user archive. I think most of them are do-able
in EFMUI

Hope this helps

AFAIK, MUI doesnt do screens or menus. All the examples I`ve seen in 
Blitz/MUI using menus uses the RIGTMenu lib.
MUI does have the gubbins to allow arexx and commodities, but I hurt my head 
trying to understand the docs for these..they seem a lot longer winded to 
code for compared to Blitz`s arexx and commoditity stuff.

But on the plus side, doing an MUI interface is a damn sight quicker and 
more flexible than the horrible gadtools way.

You sure it doesn't do screens? Wouldn't that break the whole point of 
being able to select public screens in the MUI settings for programs? I 
guess it could just be that you don't get to choose a screen in your 
code, but MUI handles it internally. Or the Blitz lib sucks :)

Hmm,I dug out the EFMUI guide,checked all the commands.. no sign of anything 
screen wise in there.
But, I have to hang my head low and grovel for forgiveness, cos there are 
indeedy some menu commands in that lib (although they are plain GTMenus 
according to the docs)

I just checked the proper MUI docs, and the only mention of screens in there 
are for things like a list of public screens etc, nothing to actually create 
screens for MUI to display on

>Only if your gadtools coding skills suck - I've got it down to a fine art

Nah, it`s gadtools that sucks, not my coding..(ahem)

OK, having read the other replies, and putting the finishing touches to an MUI
app in Blitz, EFMUI library gives you some access to the various MUI functions
found in standard MUI apps (ie, no custom classes).

However - and this is a big one. If you get the MUI developer docs (and those
for any custom classes that you want to use) you can use EFMUI as a gateway to
the whole of the MUI system. It is possible to create your own objects, if they
are not directly supported by EFMUI, and therefore, all the screens
functionality of MUI is also available.

MUI is basically based around a set of tags and classes. For any unsupported
features of MUI that you need, access is through MUISet and MUIAddTags (and to a
lesser extent, MUIAddApplicationTags).

For full access, you really do need the developer docs handy.

Once you get to grips with it, you can forget about precise layout and
notification. You simply set the events that you want to trap, and set your own
return code, and test only for what you need.

I found out to my cost that ALL MUI applications are created as a commodity, so
you can forget about making your programs commodities in your code. Again, a
simple tag stops this behaviour if you don't want your app or whatever to be a
commodity.

If you want to know more, Dave, mail me off list and let me know what else you
want to know.

Hello all,

I'm trying to set up a multi select MUIList. The list is initialised, and allows
multi select, but I can't read the #MUIM_List_NextSelected tag. I'm using:-

lst.l=MUIGet (5,#MUIV_List_NextSelected_Start)

    While  lst<>MUIGet (5,#MUIM_List_NextSelected_End)
        
       --- Bits of code here ---

        MUIDoMethod 5,#MUIM_List_NextSelected,&lst
        
       --- And here ---

    Wend

lst.l is always 0 at the start. #MUIM_List_NextSelected_End is always 0, and the
MUIDoMethod puts either "1" or the value of the last selected item in lst. I
can bypass the #MUIM_List_NextSelected_End by testing for False instead (which
seems to work), but I still need to get at all selected items.

What am I doing wrong?

Hello all,

I want to define an active MUI object in a window when the window opens, which
requires a cyclechain to be defined first. The CycleChain tag doesn't co-operate
with what I want to do, so I tried to set the cyclechain with:-

MUIDoMethod mywin,#MUIM_Window_SetCycleChain,57,0,1,2,3,60,4,21,Null

but I get a compile error. I've tried several permutations:-

Null(57,0.....21), (57,0,.....21,Null)  etc. I've also tried:-

InitTagList 1,10
Taglist 1,#MUIM_WIndow_SetCycleChain,57,0,1, etc.

but that doesn't work, either.

The compiler accepts the first version without the "Null", but the list has to
be Null terminated. How do I Null terminate a list of numbers (and not strings)?

Ermmm. Why are you using that?!

Create a cycle gadget (even after the window has opened), you just simply
have to use MUICycle. If it complains about the fact you are using numbers
(which I suspect is the case), then just use Str$("34"). And use MUISet
command to change which one is selected.

You are, it's a different thing altogether. MUICycle will create a cycle object.
#MUIM_Window_SetCycleChain groups objects in a window together for keyboard
control (so that you can tab and activate objects without the mouse).

This can be done with #MUIA_CycleChain, but that doesn't seem to work with
#MUIA_Window_ActiveObject.

I asked the same question a while back. And got this response from David
McMinn:
"
Oh, and are you sure that's how MUICycles work? I'm sure someone asked a 
similar question a few weeks ago, and you need to supply an array of 
string pointers terminated with a NULL pointer, i.e.:

Dim strings.s(10)
strings(0)="blah"
strings(1)="balaaah"
strings(2)="foo"
...
strings(10)="bar"

Dim strptr.l(11)  ; Notice -> 1 bigger than the string array
for i.w=0 to 10
    strptr(i)=&strings(i)
next
strptr(11)=0

MUICycle #selector,&strptr(0)
"

It fixed my problem and worked very well. It's a shame the EFMui
documentation lacked things like that.

Well, looking at the autodoc, it's an array of STRPTRs, terminated by a 
NULL. So you have to do this:

Dim strptr$(x)
Dim array.l(x+1)
; Put things in strings
For i.w=0 To x
    array(i)=&strptr$(i)
Next
array(x+1)=0
MUIAddTags cyclegadget,#MUIA_Cycle_Entries,&array(0)

I guess instead of copying all the pointers, you could poke 0 into the 
end of the string array, but you might get problems with string memory 
not being freed until the end of the program.

> the contents of the cycle may change during the course of the program, so
> I need to be able to reset the list in the same way.

Can you add and remove items individually from a MUICycle, or does it 
always have to be done with the array? If you can, use DLL to store items 
and add and remove them as required.

If it always has to be the array, I guess you could allocate the arrays 
like pooled memory. That is, allocate them in blocks of, say 50 items, 
and then shuffle items around as you add/remove. When you need to display 
it, just copy the pointers again, as shown above (although obviously it 
would get slower the more items you have).

Oh, you could do this:

CopyMem_ &strptr(0),&array(0),Sizeof.l*x
array(x+1)=0

And it would be a bit quicker than using the For loop. But the quickest 
way would obviously be to simply poke 0 into the strptr array and notdo 
any copying, but you might get problems if Blitz assumes things about 
strings.

The manual sucks, and it doesn't explain any of the OS commands. You need 
to get the RKRMs and the OS Autodocs (well, Includes & Autodocs) for the 
full set of documentation.

They're the input and output file handles for the program. For example, 
you could open up a new shell window for the program you are going to 
execute, you would then pass the file handle for that shell window to the 
Execute_ command.

        Hmm, i might need to look into this.  Normally i can just
double click the icon & it'll start [the icon is selected to start
from shell], automagically opening a shell window.  So i'll need to
do this manually in using the execute_ command?  The execute_ alone

You just need to call the command for making the rainbow again, but using 
either a different starting y position, or by changing your palette that 
the rainbow is created from.

Hi,
    It seems ReadFile returns true even if the file is

so is there a way to tell if a file is read protected?

I don't know about checking the protection bits of a file, but you could set the
protection bit before opening the file.

cmd$="C:Protect "+file$+" -r ADD"
Execute_ &cmd$,0,0
If ReadFile (1,file$)
The rest of your code....

Whoops!

IIRC - You can't.The slot pointers for the modules are internal and not
blitz objects. You could probably load the sid module seperately and use the
decode function (SSDecodeSidSong) to bring it in to the routine. Since the
operation is manual, you'd have the pointers when you brought it in.

Guess what! I happen to have one of those! I need to take a look at the lib
and see what state I left it in, but it should function okay. Only downside
is that it isn't an official lib, and probably conflicts with another lib #.

It works similar to the SS/CiaTracker libs using slots for items. (I believe
there are 24 total available.) Once loaded, there are commands to return
both the memory address and the size of the file.

I'll take a peek at it later and see how it looks.

From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>

Subject: @{b}sort and sortlist@{ub}

Hello all,

I'm trying to sort a dynamically changing array:-

I use a list array initially. I can either:-

1)
Pass the list array to a statement, where a standard array of the same size is
declared, the list array copied into it, and the standard array sorted. Then
copy the elements back to the list array.

This works if I do it in the main code, but as soon as I try it on a local array
in a statement, the Sort command crashes, and I have to reboot. Any idea why.

(I want a local array so that if the size of the array shrinks, I don't have to
clear out all the garbage I'll get in the first elements after a sort - it would
be freed when the statement exits). Alternatively, is there any way to free a
standard array so that it can be re-dimmed once it's been declared?

2)
Sort the list array. I've been playing with the Sortlist command, but it doesn't
work on strings, and all elements of my array are strings. Is there any way to
do this.

3) Write my own sort routine - something I'm loathe to do. Besides, I've only
ever done a bubble sort, and I'm sure it could be done quicker.

The List array may contain up to 5000 items.

All the best

Hi Steve,

I'm trying to sort a dynamically changing array:-
Sort the list array. I've been playing with the Sortlist command, but it doesn't
work on strings, and all elements of my array are strings. Is there any way to
do this.

I came up with a way of doing this just recently -- I added a .b to the
beginning of the newtype (hopefully you're talking about a list of
newtypes) and when I added items to the list I also added the integer
value of the first character of the string into this .b.  Then use
SortList to sort by that value.  This works, but it doesn't sort past the
first character of the string.  I suppose you could add the remaining
characters as values 1/10th the values for the first character, ie:

sortvalue = asc(1stchar)
sortvalue + asc(2ndchar/10)
sortvalue + asc(3rdchar/100)

or,

for x=1 to len(string)
  sortvalue + ( asc(mid$(string,1,1)) / (10 exp x) )
next x

Hope this helps...

I'd been experimenting with something along those lines, but I didn't think of
dividing the results of each successive character. (I also tried using the Cvl
command, but failed miserably)

I'll have to retry again using the divide by method to see if I can get
anywhere.

Well, after coming up with that idea, I had to try it and it doesn't quite
work...  I guess the problem is that since character values are greater
than 10, they would have to be divided by more than that otherwise they
would end u affecting thte previous decimal place (if you follow that)...
Maybe I can come up with something tomorrow, it's too late and got to do
any prolonged thinking right now :)

It's actually a fairly slow sort. Its efficiency drops off extremely
fast once you get more than a few elements in the list.

If one item at a time is being added, a tree would probably be a lot
more efficient, but it's going to involve using pointers in some
fashion to accomplish the task.

The best reference I've got on the subject is Sorting and Searching by
Knuth. It's Volume III of a set called The Art of Computer
Programming.

And my array has a theoretical maximum of 5000 elements (though I've only used
about 300 of them personally), and if there's any demand, that could go up. (The
program is GHelp, a global help system, and the array holds the filename of all
AmigaGuides on your system - I assume no-one has more than 5000 ATM)

I'm not familiar with this method. When I was at college training in COBOL, we
did a few different sort routines, but that was nearly 20 years ago, and I
can't remeber a thing - Ahh, those hazy, crazy, lazy, high and drunk days of
college. I'd love to know what I've forgotton :o)

Wait a minute. You're using a List, and you've limited the number of items 
and you want a fast sort routine? Why don't you use DLL? It's compatible 
with the Blitz lists (in terms of list structure), it supports unlimited 
items and you get fast sorting routines thrown in for free (I can't 
remember the name, but it's the fastest one where you split the list in 
half - is that the QuickSort?).

Also if you must write a sort routine yourself, you can get a faster search 
than the bubble sort quite easily by only swapping the items once per loop 
(i.e. find the smallest, largest and stick them at either end of the list). 
The code is quite similar to the bubble sort. And if you do do this, and 
you are using strings, grab a copy of the asm string compare routines from 
Aminet that I wrote - they're bucketloads faster than doinf "if a$>b$".

I think you should use a variable to dim the array and make that variable

Hello Steve

You can sort Lists with strings !!!
You just have to follow these rules :

Put a dummy .w in first place of your array type
Then simply use :
StringSort ArrayName(),SizeOf.TypeOfArray,Offset of the string you want to sort

Ex: Assume you want to sort an array using Generic type on NamGen field which is in 2nd place.
NEWTYPE .Generic
  IdxGen.w            ; Index          Generic
  NamGen.s            ; Name           Generic
  NatGen.s            ; Nationality    Generic
  DBiGen.l            ; Birth Date     Generic
  DKiGen.l            ; Death Date     Generic
End NEWTYPE

 Dim List LstGen.Generic(100)

 StringSort LstGen(),SizeOf.Generic,2

    You should take a look to NCS, there is 2 sort routines for Array

    Better use the NCS sort routine (they don't crash) and are very fast.. I
guess you even can't beat them :). Event original ACID sort routines are
fast (Quicksort based I guess). The only way to beat NCS one is to use
another algorythm (I think than using the RADIX sort algo will be even
faster for small arrays (less than 256 elements)).

I'll check them out. My own routine is sort of based on a bubble algorithm, but
it sorts from both ends of the array at the same time, and quits when no swaps
are made.

By  working from both ends I reduced a sort of a 192k textfile index from 58 secs on my
'060, to just 7 secs. 

For interested parties, there is quite a good explanation of various sort
algorithms, together with details of their efficiency in different situations at 

http://www.sparknotes.com/cs/sorting/.dir

The speakers notes are where the information is (and not in the algorithms
sections as you'd expect).

There is also a test for you to try out your knowledge (I didn't do too bad, 75%
on my first go, and it's been 20 years since I studied sorting algorithms :o)

There's Sort arrayname(), SortUp and SortDown for standard arrays, SortUp and
SortDown determine the sorting order.

Beware, though. I was using the Sort command in a program of mine which crashed
on some systems. I wound up writing my own (faster) routine.

Hello All,

How do I set a programs stack from within the program once it's running. I've
hit a prob with a couple ofpeople, which I'm sure is down to an insufficient
stack, but I'm stumped.

I know that the BB2MUIUpdate is supposed to include a couple of macros to do
this, but they are not in the archive that I have.

I have tried

deftype .StackSwapStruct stk
stk\stk_Upper= SwapStack_ (10000) 

at the start of the prog, and

SwapStack_(stk\stk_Upper)

at the end, but it doesn't work :o/

All the best

Get the second version of the MUI lib - it has all the stuff from the MUI 
update and more. Although I'm sure both of them have the stack changing 
macros, the MUI update should have it as source, and both have it in the 
MUI2.res file.

Can't help you with the code, don't have my autodocs here.

There are several utilities on Aminet that detect mousekeys during bootup, which
could be utilised for this sort of thing.

As for keypresses, since you've posted this to the Blitz list, I assume that you
do a bit of coding, why not write one :o)

It'd probably only take 5 mins, and only needs to return true or false, then
your startup-sequence could test keypresses and take action accordingly.

There's a command called keycheck in the cd32 emulator archive that comes 
with IDE-Fix that will do what you want eg.

keycheck {rawhexcode of key}
if warn
    ;do nothing
else
    run birdie
endif 

If you havn't got keycheck, email me privately (it's only 500 bytes)

You'll need to use Dave Newton's End command hack which allows you to 
return a value, that I re-posted recently.

And for the rawkey codes that Nick mentioned, you'll get them in your Blitz

IIRC It has this:
    Blitz2.1
    Blitz Support Suite
    Blitz User International (all issues I think)
    BUM1 - 10 (or maybe 6-10)
    Most of the libraries they could scrounge off Aminet
    Anything else Blitz related they could get off Aminet

Nick mentioned Weird Science and somewhere else that you could try. There's 
also been a couple of guys on Amibench (http://www.amibench.org) trying to 
sell the CDs for a while. There's a list of suppliers on the blitz-2000

Yeah.. hehe.. I kind of threw that library together quickly.. I used to use
my own mod player, and I wanted it to play a few other formats.

Hmm. I *might* have some somewhere, but my Amiga won't be here for probably
another two weeks. (I do still have an old WinUAE setup from the old CME
project.) Best I can do is check the library with library master and see how
it should work for now.)

SSLoadModule (0,"filename")
status=SSInitSidLibrary (Returns true if successful)
SSPlaySidSong(0,0)

That really should be all there is to it.

How big (in bytes) is the version of the library you have?

Weird Science doesn't have it. When you go to the product page, it says
discontinued. (No way to order.) The other just has the 2.1 on cd (Unless it
has more than it implies, it seems like a waste of time/money imo.) I'll
scan ebay and amibench from time to time.. I think I'll eventually run
across one.

In the mean time, anything going on with Free Blitz? If they're going to
release the full sources, why not just release blitz2 itself as public
domain? (I've tried looking over past blitzlist archives to see if it's been
discussed.. Think lha will work properly on a pc? HA!)

AFAIK there was only ever one CD made with Blitz and that was the Ultimate 
Blitz Basic CD with all the other stuff. I'm sure if you got them to get 
the correct name of the package you'd know for sure (but it sounds like 
they might need a while to read the name ;).

Well, the FreeBlitz stuff has nothing to do with Blitz - only the BSS. 
Which I already have permission for and is one my site, but I think the 
HTML might be missing the links.

Releasing Blitz has been discussed with Simon Armstrong and Mark Sibly, and 
while they are semi-keen on the idea, they'd rathe rnot release it open 
source, but have someone or a group I guess, to look after the code, update

Hmm. I suppose it is possible, but I doubt it. That library is different
from most of the other sound libraries in that it has no built-in play
routines at all. The SSInit[Module] actually calls a real library for access
(this is why there is also a DeInit.. To close the library once you are done
with it.) If there is a problem with the player, it's in the amiga-dos
library. Somehow I wonder if I goofed something with the SS library.. I
don't remember ever having that problem before though.

It is possible that I have a newer one than what was released.. Same thing
with the Tracker library.. What is sitting on my hd is WAY different than
what everyone else has. (I put in a bunch of commands I never thought anyone
else would find a use for..)

Can you check on the bytesize of the SS library you have? I'll compare it to
what I have.

> Though what does prevent the sid from playing?

Does the init return true? If not, it's failing the first time it tries to
open the library. Other than that, maybe the volume is low when you try to
play the first time? Otherwise, I'm not sure at this time what else it could
be.

Okay. Definately an init problem either in my lib or something has changed
in the sidplay library. (Possible.. The SS library is roughly 5 years old
now.)

Probably something on my end.

Same as I have. Although I'm not sure why the xbaudiolib was even released.
As far as I can remember, there wasn't really anything different in it from
the standard library. I had planned to make some changes, but they never
took place.

I'll definately pull the library apart and see what is going on once I get
things set up here on my end. Might take me a bit to get back up to speed on
Blitz2 again, but not long.

As a side note, has anyone checked out Blitz on the PC? I downloaded a
couple of projects. One of them was a half-way kart game. Too bad the thing
locked up while I was playing.. Then my keyboard froze and I had to reboot.
Might be able to move over some of the code stuffs from the PC to Amiga.
(Just a thought anyways.)

How do I get the right Coordinates for

when I want to set it with 

move_ rastport.l,x.l,y.l ?

If I use same Coordinates than
for WLocate it goes wrong.
I know that Wlocate uses the inner
Coordinates as 0:0, but even
if I compensate this it is not right.

It has something to do with the baseline of the font
I guess ...

Yes, ISTR that is the case (or something like that anyway). Try this:

*tf.TextFont=Peek.l(Addr Intuifont(0)+8)
Move_ &rp,x,y-*tf\tf_Baseline

Send me the ASM source and I'll have a look at it. But it should be the 
same in Blitz as it is in DevPac.

Do you use anything like Blitz mode when you are trying to play the

I've not used the NCS tooltype library before, but from the reference 
guide, it looks more useful. IIRC there were a lot of problems when 
trying to write tooltypes in the RI library (perhaps because it was never 
explained properly).

ok, here's a routine that reads tooltype info, grabbed from stats&funcs
at least it will get you started while you're deciding what library to
use.

; Function : ToolString { icon, tooltype }

; Author : James L Boyd - jamesboyd@...
; - adapted from someone else's source!

; Returns tooltype's contents (if any)...
; or "NotFound" if not found :) - added by Nick Clover 

Function.s ToolString {icon$,tool$}

If Right$(icon$,5)=".info" Then icon$=Left$(icon$,Len(icon$)-5)

*Icon.DiskObject=GetDiskObject_(&icon$)

; *Icon.DiskObject=GetDiskObjectNew_(&icon$)
; ^ this uses the default-type icon if there isn't one...

a$="NotFound"

If *Icon
  a.l=FindToolType_(*Icon\do_ToolTypes,&tool$)
  If a
    a$=Peek$(a)
  Else a$=""
  EndIf
  FreeDiskObject_ *Icon
Else Function Return ""
EndIf

Function Return a$
End Function

; demo :

; NOTE - you'll need to change this to something
; on your system!

; NPrint ToolString {"SYS:Tools/HDToolBox","SCSI_DEVICE_NAME"}

; MouseWait
; End

Subject: @{b}Windows and fonts and stuff like that.@{ub}

I have one screen - Screen 0.    There are two windows attached to 
the screen.   Window 0 is borderless, backdrop and always open.   
Window 1 gets opened and closed as needed.

The order of things happening is Open Screen 0, Open Window 0, 
open and close window 1 as needed.

I have a function TextLength{Text} which looks like:

Function.w TextLength{Text$}

*rp.RastPort = RastPort (Used Window)

Function Return TextLength_(*rp, &Text$, Len(Text$))

End Function

When Window 0 is active, *rp\Font\tf_XSize is 11 (which is correct)
When Window 1 is active, *rp\Font\tf_XSize is 8 (which aint!)

Anybody got any ideas why this should be so?

Have you specifically told window 1 to use the same font as window 0?

eg. windowfont 0, just after the window is opened. Using 'Use IntuiFont 0'
won't work with all windows...

or use

*rp.RastPort = RastPort (0)

but It seems to me to be a waste of time creating a function for a 1 line
command. Just do it directly with:

rp.l=RastPort(0);just after you open window 0

result.l=TextLength_(rp,&text$,Peek.l(&text$)-4)

Hmm, I don't think so.   I thought that a window took the screen's

I was doing a very bodgy thing to get the text length a long time 
ago, before I discovered TextLength_ so I created a function then.   
When I discovered how to do it properly, I simply had to change the 
function.    Used too many places to fix now :-(

Thanks for that, although I probably should have mentioned in the mail 
that I've been giving the site a major makeover recently, and I have 
fixed a lot of things like broken links, but I haven't updated the pages. 
I will try to do it soon as I'm almost finished - just a couple of

So you don't need to report broken links, chances are I will have got 
them in this cleanup. The webring might be a fair bit broken though, but
