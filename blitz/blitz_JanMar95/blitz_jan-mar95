Hi all,

everyone told about new libs ?!?! GTLib with a DetachGTList-command ie.

Where are this libs published ? Is there an ftp-site to get this libs ?!?!

My old GTLib works fine with OS3.0  .. with OS2.x it will crash ?!?!

Please  let  me  now,  where  I  can  get the new versions, or, if
possible send it to me UUEncoded.

If  you  know  the  screentitle,  there  is an easy way to get the
Screen-Structure

Findscreen 0,title$
*scr.Screen=peek.l(addr screen(0))
s_left.w=*scr\LeftEdge

s_width.w=*scr\Width

Hmm.. you will find

vpmodes.w=*scr\ViewPort\Modes

is it that, what you are looking for?

With >=OS2.0 you can  use

vpmodes.w=GetVPModeID_(&*scr\ViewPort)

Use AutoDocs and/or RKRM to get information about vpmodes.

Mmm... loading a library with IncBin won't work very well, I think...
Best way ist to get the .fd of the library and convert it via
FDConvert (This assumes that Teijo included the .fd with the OctaMED,
what I don't believe ;)

For playing Protracker correctly try the CIATracker.lib by Neils (is
is right? I just guessed ;)

The BlitColl command allows you to do this. Assuming You've got your mask 
Bitmap on, say, bitmap 3, you'd do something like this:

Use Bitmap 3
If BlitColl(shape,X,Y)
	;
	;shape overlaps mask here!
	;
Endif

As for the big nasty tanks, how about making them sprites and including a 
collision colour in the background?

I take it your doing something like this:

a$="$VER...."

In this case, the actual text gets stored near the end of the 
executable...so the other $VER is probably getting found first. Try this:

Goto SkipVer
Dc.b "$VER...."
Even
SkipVer

This should work...

If anyone is interested, this is the routine I've been using, yet
it doesn't solve my problem of knowing the lastshape num is to begin
with. (NB, the bb2objtypes.res must be loaded).


    Repeat
      *shapes.shape = Addr Shape(shpno)
      If *shapes\_depth > maxplanes Then maxplanes = *shapes\_depth
      shpno = shpno + 1
    Until (*shapes\_pixwidth = 0)

    lasttile = shpno - 1

there is a register that allows u to change the display freq..
can`t remeber off hand wot it is, but if u slow the refresh

therefore the distance across the screen for the cooper to change
colour is smaller

i had a c2p display which f

illed the whole screen, changing the frq
causeed the whole display to be squashed up to the top left of
the screen..

i haven`t tried increasing the colour changes across the screen
as i`ve only had a brief look at it, but i don`t see how it should be
a problem getting more than 100 colour chnages per line

only one disadvantage... doesn`t work on all tv`s, should work
better on monitors , my scart connection seems to handle it ok,
composite connection isn`t as good, and i dunno about RF.

the tv also brightens, and makes a high pitched wine, obviously
the tunning circuits, and it takes about 3 seconds for the tv to
synch.. the synching process creates some wonderful screen 
displays !

his name.. i`ll find out

there ya go

I think the tag you want is somelike: GTLV_Selected.  This can be used to 
make the listview put the text of the selected item automatically into a 
string gadget (data would be GtGadPtr(mygadlist,mygadget) or if used as 
-1 it switches on the highlight bar (I think - my docs are at home!).

I do know that in the source for the gadtools library, the listview has 
this tag commented out - so that you have to use the GTTags command to 
add your tag to the listview (by making it available to all gadgets when 
they are initialised).

  
Hope this works,
Steve Mc.

I'll reply to myself and say that the tag might actually be 
GTLV_ShowSelected rather than GTLV_Selected.  You'd have to read the docs 
to find out which it is.

I tried values of $80080054 and $80080055, as they are supposed to be the
values for the above two tags. I could not get them to work for either
GTSetAttrs or GTGetAttrs so something must be up.

Thanks for your help, I'll have another look tonight.  I might be able to
find the docs somewhere!

Use the tags with the GTTag command *before* you open your listview, it 
should then open with the correct options.
 
GtSetAttrs just modifies existing information - you cannot change the 
view info for a listview using this command (I think).

I realise that Blitz has so much more to offer than AMOS (Pointers, Data Types

If I were to swap each line in my AMOS code for the equivelant line in Blitz
(i.e. Bob ..... => Blit ......   etc), how much faster would my program run?

Or is it the case that the extra speed that can be squeezed out of Blitz is due
to the greater control over the Amiga that Blitz gives you.

I have this problem too - nothing I compile in Blitz will run on under 
KS1.3 (on a A500 or using ReloKick on my 1200)! Does Blitz use some dodgy

First of all it's for Windows :-)

But the most special part is probably that all coding of the GUI is done
visually - that is you "draw" your GUI, your windows, buttons etc. and then
you attach code-fragments to these. For instance you have a code-sequence
for a button-click, a button-doubleclick, a window-resize etc.

Heh - I tried this, but there is a 'small' problem - The Blitter cannot
be usedin QAMIGA - thus, no animations While loading.  Well - that I know
of anyway - Hopefully someone can prove me wrong....

And the reason for the thing not working without a Read statement is
because it cannot find a "." so willnever end.

So how many points do i get for that????  ;}

Simon - can you shed any light?  It would appear that Blitz is getting stressed
on 1.3 machines when some programs are compiled on a 3.0 machine?  Does blitz
decide what version of a library it should open at runtime, or in compilation?
IE: is my program asking for asl.library V39 all the time just cos i compiled 
on a 3.0 machine (or because i used a V39 function which is actually not used
if my program recognises its on a 1.3 system).  I would have thought Blitz 
should just open any version of a library it can get its hands on, and then its
up to us programmers to do...

OpenLibrary_("asl.library",39)   (or whatever it is)

and have our own routines to check we ghave the right version.  Maybe this is 
what already happens and im barking up the wrong tree here.  But anyway - 
If Blitz decides to open a specific lib and CANT, couldnt we have some protection in blitz to say that the user doesnt have that library?

Subject: Shape Rotation


Dear All,

Probably the third or fourth time I've tried to post a question in
this but here goes......

The shape rotation function provided in Blitz changes the size of a
shape even if the rotation is through 90 degrees. This is rather
annoying as I wanted to use the function in a "Graphics Manager"
application.

The question is: "Does anyone have a shape rotation function that
rotates shapes through 90 degrees AND keeps them the same size?

    Thanks in advance,

    	Colin.

If I'm not mistaken, the "a" I have highlighted is the same as the "a$" you
have defined above.  I think a variable can only have one type, i.e. you could
not have "a.w", "a.l", "a.s" and "a$" all in the same program (albeit, the last
two are synonymous).

Sorry, afraid I can't see what you are trying to do, it appears that
you are copying a file of one format into another file in exactly the
same format! from this example (? a typo or two?). But even so I cannot
get it to crash as it is. If you want to check the code and send a
version directly to me, and a description of what your attempting I'll
have a look at it for you.
As a guess though, if you are trying to move part of a string into another
I'd possibly try something like the following.
  maxlen a$=100
  maxlen a1$=51

... read record etc

  a1$=left$(a$,50)

The reasoning is that Blitz uses 0 terminated strings, therefore the
space to hold it may require the extra byte to hold this 0. This is
only a guess though, I'll be able to try it when you've checked the code.

OTOH, if you are really just trying to copy a file then there is a
CopyFile command supplied with one of the Libraries (Elmore I think) which
is probably faster.

All the best.

Actually, I think a.s and a$ aren't synonymous. I haven't got my amiga right
here right now, so I can't check, but I think it would be possible to have 
both a.s and a$ in a program, but you can't mix the "dot-something" types.

Have you got your workbench sprites in highres mode?  That caused the old

You shouldn't really use self-modifying code, because it will crash

I think this is because you are using a 640x256 display. When you rotate the
shape, an extra pixel is added to every pixel across. 

To get round this I think you will have to write a routine that preserves
the aspect ratio when the shape is rotated, or use a lo-res display.

I haven't seen a routine for this yet, but if you find one please foward it
to me.

Regards

The Blitz compiler has calls to the exec flush cahce command all over the

Okay kids, just when I thought everything was going great, an old bug 
rears it's ugly head. My strange gadget hits are back. I've almost 
located the problem, when I step through it with the new and improved 
debugger, and after applying the normal conditions, it freezes on the line

ev.l = WaitEvent

So, I do a variable trace on ev.l. Its stays around 8, 32, and such, and 
then >BOOMF< it hits 524228 and freezes. Now, when stepping through it 
with debugger, I never actually get my strange gadget hits, it just 
stops, UNTIL I flip screens back to my program, and activate the screen 
with the mouse. When I return back to the debugger, its on a completely 
different line of program, and work as normal, for a while...

So, if anyone with a bit of patience and a strong stomach would volunteer 
to look at my code (although I don't think its my fault, the problem 
comes and goes with no help from me....) I would be eternally grateful. 
The source code is pretty big, but the main loop is pretty small, and 
everything is basically structured nice...

Thanks again again again again

As I recall the original serial library for blitz used self modifying 
code to set a branch address for another command.  tut tut tut Simon.

If you are going to use self modifying, either switch off caches (in 
Blitz mode only though since you'll degrade multitasking), or make sure 
you do loads of flushes before the code is executed.  :)

The WaitEvent command puts your program to sleep until an intuition event 
is sent to it.  The debugger when stepping this command will not return 
UNTIL this command has finished, e.g. you have pressed the mouse on your 
screen or moved something etc.

Your strange gadget hit looks like a window deselected event (or is that 
selected? :) ).

Yes, well that library didn't even use the vbr for the vector base so it 
was not the most A4000 friendly library in the world. Gosh My A4000 is

While we are on the subject of no offence to ACID. Where are the bits

Anyhow, ACID can expect a version of my game on Monday, if I at least

BTW. WHAT about the bug in gadgets taking up memory, any fix to it.

I spoke too soon (silly me) well yea there some nasty bug while using

Trying to make a filedirectory reader which reads names to a

memory but you'll have to allocmem first that not so great.

WAY1. You''ll see that the string doesen't work att all.
but using entrysize (now long) it works fine(Needs some changes).

NEWTYPE.item
 name.s
End NEWTYPE

DEFTYPE.item files

InitList 1,files : MaxLen files\name=20

ChDir("df1:")

While MoreEntries

AddListItem 1 : files\name=EntryName$ : SetListItem 1,files
files\name="TT" : GetListItem 1,files : NPrint files\name

Wend

End
MouseWait

WAY2. Runs out of memory by the setlistitem command

DEFTYPE.s name

initlist 1,name :  MaxLen name=20

ChDir("df1:")

While MoreEntries

addlistitem 1 : name=EntryName$ : setlistitem 1,name

Wend

in BUM7 is for AGA. But well I'll look for it

2) Does R.ELMORE have e-mail address I've sent register payment before

   BUM7:s INCLUDE UTIL MAKER doesn't work in OCS machine why ? or
   MAKEDEFLIBS ?!

5) Is there working version of CIA module player with wait event and
   masking abilitys.

Well BUM7:s NEILCIA lib, doesen't support masking or events. SO anyone
to sent me the newest one. BTW. THAT works in OS1.3 TOO

   How to unmask the channel in really OLD med player ?.
   How to inline assembler to use the octamedplayer.library
   or possible some other multichannel things ?

7) How to check collisions with two shapes when the other shape is
   background and the player is inside of the background shape.

I know that it's easy to use sprites and shapes but without sprites ?
I mean that youll have a background block and over it a player shape.
One way could be by point command ???

AND SOME HARDWARE THINGS ?

3) A NON DOS diskette. How to put the loader to bootlock or something
   similar so you can load things from tracks/blocks directly.

Hi All,

Today I was playing around with Blitz and came across a problem. I was
trying to launch a command from within Blitz, and I had code like this:

cmd$="LhA a DH4:Store USER:~(#?.IFF|#?.GIF)

but when i went to compile it, I got 'Unknown constant' (or similar). So
how would I go about using this string? I could add in CHR$(x) for the #
symbol, but thats a bit of a pain.

Any other ideas?

Subject: CLI usage

Hallo All,

After a time searching for a good way to run programs from Blitz i find a way
that could help many people i think. I did see there are many people having
troubles finding there way in a good solution for running external programs
from inside your own program. This will do the job in all cases. Except i think
it will only work on OS2.0+ Amiga's.

Tips and trics :

;making a new var for setting tags
NEWTYPE.tags
  a.l:b.l
  c.l:d.l
  e.l:f.l
  g.l:h.l
  i.l:j.l
  k.l:l.l

End NEWTYPE

;define some constanten

#SYS_Dummy     =#TAG_USER+32
#SYS_Input     =#SYS_Dummy+1
#SYS_Output    =#SYS_Dummy+2
#SYS_Asynch    =#SYS_Dummy+3
#NP_Dummy      =#TAG_USER+1000
#NP_Error      =#NP_Dummy+8
#NP_StackSize  =#NP_Dummy+11
#TAG_DONE      =0

;Define a output device in a string

output.l=Open_(&clisize$,1004)
If output.l=0
  ;could not open device so whe could end
  End
EndIf

;com$=what are we going to do ?
com$="Dir dh0:"+Chr$(10)

;How many stack we are going to need ?
#stack=20000

;running (not assyn.=0) otherwise we can't close the device anymore

tags.tags\a=#SYS_Asynch  ,0
tags.tags\c=#SYS_Input   ,output.l
tags.tags\e=#SYS_Output  ,0
tags.tags\g=#NP_Error    ,output.l
tags.tags\i=#NP_StackSize,#stack
tags.tags\m=#TAG_DONE
error.l=SystemTagList_(com$,&tags.tags)

;if the cli is opened whe can close it
If output.l<>0 Then dumb.b=Close_(output.l)

End

the advantage of this system is :

- that we get the return code of the external program if it can't be runned, or
everything else that is going wrong.

- We can specified the stack of the program

- We can even run assy. using the external amigados run command (com$="Run Dir
dh0:"+Chr$(10)) but then we lose the return codes from the external program whe
running with run. But it will be a save way to close our cli and quit the
progran even there is still a task running on. The Cli will stay open untill
our last task has finished using it. Thats why i don't use
#SYS_Asynch,1.

If you choose to use #SYS_Asynch,1 the cli will be closed automaticly you could
then choose some tag to let the cli open. BUT ! if you close then the cli
before the external task is finished you will have a crash. In this case whe
have to wait for some code at a own port whe have created. Thats why i find
using #SYS_Asynch,0 and the external program run a beter and easyer way of
doing what i wanna do.

Hiya, the problem here is the '~' character, not the '#'! This weird 
character assumes there to be a constant name coming up, and replaces the 
constant name with the value of the constant...I'm not sure exactly 
why...it was stuck in there in the 'early days' of Blitz.

I'll say this quietly, just in case anyone flames me for releasing bugged 
libraries the last time :)

A library update, RIBlitzLibsV4_1.lha is being uploaded to the usual 
places.  This archive replaces V4, and fixes loads of bugs and problems 
with it.  The new archive also contains some new libraries:

	RISortLib     - sort linked lists based on strings.
	RILinkListLib - Dynamic linked lists - ALPHATEST stage - please 
                        report any suggestions/problems.
	RICopperFXLib - Some simple copper commands for use with the
			display library.
	RICompactDisklib- library for controlling the cd.device - allows
			playing of cd tracks straight from the cd drive.
			*ZAPPO COMPATIBLE :)*

There is also a Jurgen Valks style command guide containing all the 
separate library docs.  Although it wasn't created by Jurgen (it was 
created by a blitz program), he does deserve credit for the original 
Blitz2Guide which was very useful.

Archive contains: 18 libraries with (I think) 208 commands in total.

Thank you for your attention,
Steve Mc.

I need to do some fairly accurate timing stuff in my sample editor.
What's the best way to do timing like this from blitz. CAn you use CIA-B? 

How's it done?

General,

    >> editor.  What's the best way to do timing like this from
    >> blitz. CAn you use CIA-B?

    >> How's it done?

I did so-e timing for the game I'm writing so it works for "short
periods"...

I set up an array of words (should have just used allocmem_ but didn't
know of it then).

    Dim TimeInfo.w (12)

Then just inserted something like this at the check points:

    TimeInfo (1) = VPos()

    .... stuff to time ....

    TimeInfo (2) = VPos()

Syntax is likely to be wrong but you get the idea.

This gives accuracy of 256 intervals / 50th second which is pretty
accurate. But it only really works if the stuff being timed is less
than 50th second (or if code has VWait in it then 25th ie 2
frames...).

Any use?

    Colin.

Yo!

I've posted about the Advanced Programmer's Kit before and got zilcho!
So...

Does it exist?

If yes, what is it?

And how much is it?

I get the impression it would tell you how to develop your own
libraries and other exciting things!

Any info appreciated!

    Thanks,

Subject: Enforcer Hits with debugger

Just a quick question here:

I've just got a 68030 with mmu accelerator for my A1200 and have hence 
got enforcer (which I'm not really sure how to use properly yet) and when 
you run ANY Blitz Basic program with the debugger, it produces enforcer 
hits. It is my understanding that this should not happen with any program 
at all. So WHY does it happen, and has anybody else noticed it?

I'm on the latest version of BB2 (bum7) with the LES Debugger V1.21 and 
the RIlibsV4 - should anyone need to know that info to figure out why...

Terry.

Let's think about this shall we Terry? What generally causes an 
enforcer hit? Memory access to a location not owned by the task. What
does a debugger have to do? Oh yes, access the memory owned by another
task. 

Hum, what _could_ be causing all those hits.

Your right really no program _should_ generate enforcer hits, but in the
case of a debugger, this is almost unavoidable. All Steve should check
is that the _only_ enforcer hits are those where the debugger has acessed
other areas of memory deliberatly.

Yes, thanks! :)
Unfortunately though, this still won't be quite good enough. :(
According to my quick calculations, this will give me a maximum 
frequency of 12.8Khz, and as I am writing some sampling software at the 
moment, I will want at least 28Khz - if possible even higher.
Thanks for the code though, this looks useful, I will save this message I 
think.

Some guy told me yesterday that there was some source for using the CIA 
timers on the blitz-ftp site.
However, I appear to have lost the address, and for some reason it's not 
in my ncftp history.

Could someone repost it for me?

homepage (see the sig at the bottom of this mail), so go check it out and mail 
me any contributions.  Ill be convrting it to guide form soon enough.  

SPECIAL NOTE:  Anyone who asks a question and gets the reply DIRECT rather than
through the list, can they PLEASE forward a summary of the solution/suggestions to me.  This would help loads.

SIMON:  PLEASE!  Can i have the addresses for distribution sites?  I have the uk
        one at home, so i have that, but i wnat the others.  If anyone else can
        help out then thanks - Im not really expecting simon to reply.

Blitz Project Report:  Whats happened?  is it no more Jurgen?  I have set it up
on my homepage, so if anyone wants to check out what is there now, and get it changed, or make an addition,  WRITE TO ME!   Please?

I think thats it.

Bye for now.    Mark Tiffany

Subject: TextGadgets and StringGadgets


Helloooo!

Okay.. I'm writing a little "Graphics Manager" program to manage the
graphics (never! - ED) for my game. The main screen has 4 rows of 8
shapes (24x24) with a 2 digit stringGadget below to display the number
of the shape above.

Well .. I used to be able to Toggle the stringGadgets to get a border
around it to show if a given shape was "selected"... until I changed
to v1.80 and suddenly the text is highlighted and no border :-(

So I read the manual... stringGadgets are meant to have a
cursor.. ok.. so what do I do?

I want to be able to

    o	display a number
    o	change the number as many times as I want (for showing
    	different shapes)
    o	and detect a hit on that number.. well the "shape" in some
    	sense.

At the moment I have a messy hack that works.. but is there a nice way
to do this.. As I see it textGadgets are no use because you can't
change the string :-(

Any ideas?! .. gratefully received!

    Thanks in advance,

    	Colin.

  HELP!!!!!!!!

  I have just upgraded my Amiga to a 4000/030,  when I compile/run
a program, it compiles fine, then I get either:
  A) Software Failure!
  B) The debugger window appears but it appers as green and black
       garbage.

  I am cuurently using the DBLPAL:Hires No Flicker and
MULTISCAN:Productivity screen modes.

  Does anyone know why this is happening,  I seem to remember
reading in a BUM that this would occur, and it could be avoided by 
adding something to the start of you programs, but I can't check this
as I left the BUM's at home in Boston - no good to me there when
I'm in Newcastle are they :(

  I would appreciate it if someone could tell me the solution to this
as I'm currently in the middle of writing a 'SPECIAL' program (no
details will be disclosed - yet).

   With the Shareware text editor EdWord this would be possible.  It is 
geared around programming and allows external DOS commands to be 
performed on the current text in the editor.  I had it set up with 
an external spell checker available at the press of a "<R-Amiga> 1".  
   Another cool feature of the editor is that it can format your code 
for you if you tell it all of a languages keywords and delimiters etc...
  eg 
Capitalise/Uppercase/Lowercase your variables of reserve words

ps.  I use version 3 but its up to version 5 I think, so God knows

There ya go. Blitz hates that. Drop back to a 15khz mode like 640x256.

Dear Everyone...

Here's a bit of code...


NEWTYPE shapeData
    selectedIDs.b[200]
    endList.b
End NewType

...

Statement ShiftIDsUp{start.b}

    SHARED shapeData
    USEPATH shapeData

    FOR i = start TO (\endList - 1) STEP 1
    	\selectedIDs[i + 1] = \selectedIDs[i]
    	i + 1
    NEXT

Ens Statement


The question is... does the use of "\endList - 1" and "[i + 1]" change
the actual variables? It "should" just change the value used as the
index or end of the FOR NEXT loop...

Its hard to express the possible problem.. example time

Okay..  i is equal to 3.... so 

    \selectedIDs[i + 1] = \selectedIDs[i]

Will be the same as...

    \selectedIDs[4] = \selectedIDs[3]

BUT will i still be 3 or will it have been incremented to 4 by this
line?

    Thanks,

    	Colin.

Makedeflibs is there somewhere ( I think it has been included with

Well, very easy, You have to known that every character you use in a text could
be different of size (pixel). So you have to see how many pixels there are in
every character or directly in a hole string. This could be done by next
function using the amigalib comand IntuiTextLength_. IntuiTextLength_ expect a
IntuiText structure. So you have to include the Amigalibs.res or define it by
youself as a newtype.

;NEWTYPE.Screen
;The screen structure will hold 
;your font type and size in his
;.TextAttr structure
;NEWTYPE .TextAttr
;this structure will hold the font that
;is been used by your screen
;NEWTYPE.IntuiText
;this structure will hold the textstring and ;the .TextAttr (fontsize) So whe
can calculate ;the totale size

Function.w pixel{tekst$}

;get the adres of our screen wich
;holds everything whe need, the font !

  *myscreen2.Screen=Peek.l(Addr Screen(0))
  intui.IntuiText\FrontPen=0
  intui.IntuiText\BackPen=1
  intui.IntuiText\DrawMode=2
  intui.IntuiText\LeftEdge=6
  intui.IntuiText\TopEdge=3

;look at our screen wich font it use
;and give it to our IntuiText structure
;Font(.TextAttr)

  intui.IntuiText\ITextFont=*myscreen2.Screen\Font

;Place the text whe wanna known the size of

  intui.IntuiText\IText=&tekst$
  intui.IntuiText\NextText=0

;ok.l will hold the size in pixels needed for ;the give text.

  ok.l=IntuiTextLength_(intui.IntuiText)
  Function Return ok.l
End Function

WBToScreen 0
sizeoftext.w=pixel{"This is a fontsensitivity test"}
NPrint "Whe do need ",sizeoftext.w," pixels."

Now you have to check every string used in a gadget so you can decide the
gadget's size and position like you wanna have it, this is posible since you
known the size of text in pixles. You will even know that it will fitt on your
window so you can decide to use the default font (Topaz 8) are not.

	node_ptr = ^node

	node = record
		element:element_type;
		next:node_ptr;
	end;

	LIST = node_ptr;

The problem whit Blitz is, that I don't know, how to define a pointer
to the NEWTYPE.node _in_ the newtype ie. I can't do this:

DEFTYPE *node_ptr.node

NEWTYPE .node
 element.element_type
 next_node.*node_ptr
END NEWTYPE

Can anyone give me nice solution for this ? (well, a hack could do also...)

OK, why the 'i+1' before the 'next'? This is what 'next' is for (the next 
will also increment i). If you're trying to do what I think you're 
trying to do, there's also a subtler problem here. let's say i is 3...so:

\selectedIDs[4] = \selectedIDs[3]

fine. but what happens on the next pass of the loop?

\selectedIDs[5] = \selectedIDs[4]

Not so fine. By now, selectedIDs[4] contains selectedIDs[3], not what it 
used to contain! You'll end up simply copying the 'start' selectedID into all 
further ones! The trick here is to loop backwards...

for i=\endlist-1 to start step -1
selectedIDs[i+1] = selectedIDs[i]
next

Subject: Double Buffering A Portion Of A Window


Hi there people,
		I have an interesting little problem in the my current
game. I have a large window (640x400) and there is a portion of it
300x300 in size that I wish to be double buffered as it has animation
it that flickers a bit (obviously). At the moment I am rendering
the gfx in a bitmap and then doing a BitmapToWindow command to blit
it in...

Is there a better was to do this? I suppose I could have a seperate
window for this portion, even then I don`t know how to double buffer that
window 8) The BUM5 window command has a bitmap parameter... Hum.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

If you include an array C[n} in a newtype then C[0] is indeed valid, but
C{n} is not. The number in square brackets at the array declaration
gives the number of elements, not the maximum index. The maximun index
you can use is C[n-1}

Errr, i think that if that code frag. is not a typo, then the change you need
is....

next_node.*nope_ptr
becomes
*next_node.node_ptr

Or am I being silly?  I dont really know what youre trying to do here, so its 
just a guess...

But you can still write to C[n] and even C[n+1] as if that array was 
that large. While on the subject of arrays, I got something really 
weird. I had a NEWTYPE which contained two arrays of some other 
NEWTYPES. The variable had 8 elements and the second had 12. 
Each element in those arrays was a word. 
There was a conflict when tried to write to last two elements of 
first array. I had to increase index by another two elements (words) 
which would never be used. 
Oh well,

Best to consider not double buffering. If your animations are in a list I 
would use a loop that selected which animation to change next with the 
position of the vertical beam (and bitmap display offset). This way if 
videbeam is at top you would start by updating anim objects at bottom of 
screen and vica versa.

I'm willing to help if you can publish some source to build on.

Regards,

Simon

where to send message for getting them in uuc. messages.

In to matter.

OS1.3 gadgets are giving me a trouble.

a use a screen, window and doublebuffered screen.
Window in bordeles, only for the gadget and inkey$ selection.
When I do manually colourfade (fadepalette only for BLITZ mode ???)
then the gadget go away. Well yea. But when using a another bitmap the
gadgets won't show. Only in that bitmap which is screensbitmap.

One solution could be that using 3 bitmaps. 1 for the screen and so
and the 2 for the double buffering.

And some problems with the colourslit it woun't work now. It always reports
that no currently object. SO ?

You probably can't send events to intuition, but you should be able to 
send them to tasks...as long as you can find the correct signal bit in 
the tasks window...although it probably says somewhere not to do this!

 GRAPHICS: handmade, raytraysed, animation... only OCS resolutions.
 SFX: sampling soundus, like explosions and so.

Subject: ABOUT BUM8

IS anyone get this yet. OR is it out yet.
I've just wondering about that is there änything new in that ?

I've heard that V2.0 will have all PD librarys so, if you have thise librarys
is there anyting new.

BTW: ACID. Could you add same kind of features to TED as the AMOS has so you
could delete files, copyfiles and so on. And in debugger do those too...
You'll allways have to use somekind of own filemaster program...

Any text file for all the ACID:s librarys. What commands does every basic
files have. About 50% of the libs are always just for there. Nothing to do
with them.

When is the MED player going to be updated ?

Any documents for using assembler in blitz for beginners. How to put
data to registers and so. Just for how it is done from blitz.
And how to get blitz variable a status from memory addresses or registers.

Thanks...

After opening your screen, do a ScreensBitmap to grab your screen as a 
bitmap, then use GetAShape - remember to calculate the position to grab 
from with regards to the screen, not the window.  Eg.

		ScreensBitmap 0,0
		Use Window MYWINDOW
		x=WindowX + MYXOFF
		y=WindowY + MYYOFF
		GetAShape NUM,x,y,WIDTH,HEIGHT

Subject: Arrays working..


Dear All,

I managed to get the sorted list in an array working.. thanks to the
advice that x[0] IS dodgy for arrays in NewTypes despite what some
have said..!??

I gave up on TextGadgets and StringGadgets .. trying to get them to
show if "associated" shape (NOT a Shapegadget) is selected. The toggle
was okay BUT I have the ability to show a different 32 shapes in the
32 boxes so the indication of selection has to "move" with the
shapes. Manually toggling textGadgets gave yucky redraw errors.. so in
the end I just did this:

    o	Turned toggle off on the textGadgets (and BoxSelect ?).

    o	Draw a Gadget Border to create a small "indicator".

    o	Handled the Hits on the textGadgets and then indicated
    	selection by filling the indicator with an appropriate colour.

Looks quite nifty BUT what a hassle! It is now really easy to "move"
the shapes and so the selection indication thereof.

Oh well... it works!

    Ta ta,

    	Colin.

Hi there Mark,
		Right well I use arrays in newtypes a hell of a lot, and
basically if you had,

NewType.Wibble
	messages.s[400]
End Newtype

You can access elements 0-399. I have never had any trouble accessing the
0 element, I see no reason why you should. It is all as documented in the
Blitz User Guide.

I meant to mail you Mark, there are some problems with Virtual Worlds on my
machine, like, it doesn't 8( I have a little bug report which I keep 
meaning to send to you... Sorry. I'll to sort something out about those papers
as well... Maybe into my home page...

You can get the RI libraries or the LES debugger off me if you like.  I 
think you've said you can't get through to us here though.  Are you using 
something like:

Subject: Blitcoll and Statements

	Can anyone tell me why Blitcoll won't work in statements when I'm in
Blitz mode. BBlit won't work right either. On compiling I get an error
saying these commands are only available in Amiga mode . It's only when I
put these commands in their own statement in an effort to keep things tidy.
	Also , I reqd somewhere that statements can be slow. Am I better using
Gosubs? This would solve the above prob but I think statement are easier to
keep track of.

Subject: Help! No time left.

	Hi again, CoverdiskMan here :)
	The prob this time is a serious one. I've run out of Rastertime (C64
speak that). All I've got running at the mo are;

2 slices , One 320x199 at ypos 44 and one at 320x56 at 200.
2 bitmaps , to put in the above. 320x200 and 320x56ish
2 tanks BBlitting into the top bitmap 16x16 32 colour.

All bitmaps are 32 colour. Plus I'm doing a wee bit of fancy collision so
that you can slide up walls (not in yet) if pushing vertically. The
collision code is only about 30 lines of IF THEN's for each tanks and I
think would take up little time compared to the firing routines which have
tp implemented (even simple ones).
	I must be doing something seriously wrong here. What? How do I know I'm
running out of time? Because everytime I add bit more, the spooky border
coloured fog at the top of the screen jumps down another 20 pixels to
swallow up my little tanks.

	 Help mucho appreciated.

Bri,

Subject: Hello

Dear Blitz people,

Although I bought Blitz II almost two years ago, I've only just started
having the time to use it - and I love it.  AMOS has been consigned to the
bottom of the toybox!

However, I have a question or two I'd be grateful if you'd answer.

1) I've subscribed to BUM and have disks to issues 6 and 7.  The upgrade
DEFLIBS files seem to have got smaller from issue 6 to 7 and some of the
commands I used from the issue 6 file were not recognised when I updated
it to the issue 7 deflibs.  I presume the latter doesn't include all of the
formers commands.  Is there anyway to merge the two, or am I just being
stupid?

2) Can TED accept longer lines horizontally - it can be a bit limiting at
times.

3) Can you run Blitz on any other screen modes other than PAL Hires/
Interlace?  I have a Microvitec and it crashes when run from my DBLpal
Workbench.

4) Where can I keep in touch with Blitz upgrades?  (Fido, Usernet etc)

5) Where do I send money to, to continue getting BUM??

Thanks for your help - I've written two small WB utilities using Blitz
(Remdate_wb and National Lottery Manager) and I'm falling in love with it.
If I can help in any way with Blitz's promotion etc, please let me know.

With best wishes,

Instead of going microsofts way and debugging my listserver with
the help of the users, I decided to put it on hold again, until
I  1) find a way to test it better than I seem have done (any 
volunteers there to receive lot of junk mail ?) 2) get my
postmaster to install Majordomo or some other throughly tested
server (this isn't going to success before they get bigger, better
and faster machine for handling mail) 3) find some throughly tested
software, which I can install myself (and which isn't resourcehungry).

I now know why some of the difficulties occurred, but I don't want
to cause another catastrophe, so I'll wait until some of 1-3 come
true.

My deepest apologies for all, I really thougth that it worked
(famous last words).

If someone with better resources wants to take over the list,
let me know. (but be warned, it will take some time to admin it,
even with something like Mojordomo)

I had dificulties with it too...but finaly I managed to make it 
work...1st...as far as I remeber it wants the Pattern # as 
parameter (not the position # which would be more obvious in my 
oppinion). 2nd I had to put the jump to position X 
command (in med or PT) at the end of the pattern I wanted to 
jump...sounds stupid but it works.

An Example:

Pos Pat
0    0 - Song 1
1    1 - Song 1
2    3 - Song 2
3    4 - Song 2
4    5 - Song 2

Now if I want to Jump to Position 2 I have to do JumpMed 3 (!) and
pattern 3 (in module) must have a 'jump to position' command in last 
row (B if I remember correctly in ProTracker) so in our case B3 - 
otherwise it will ONLY play the pattern you specified in JumpMed
Hmm...hope that helps (it worked in Roketz ;). CU!

  I don't know if there's a RAD function to convert degrees to radians
  [try Sin(Rad(angle_in_degrees)) ]

  otherwise you can convert it yourself by dividing by 360/2*pi, or 57.3
  near enough.

I think there is a OS call named GetProgramName_ - try this out.  you 
might even be interested in GetPRogramDir_.  I think that these`commands 
require a lock on your program - which can be obtained with another 
command (which I can't remember!).  Look in the autodocs/includes for 
more information.

You could try using the LikeWorkbench tag item - this opens your screen 
to exactly the same size/depth as the workbench screen.  You also get 
WB's default palette and pens.

Hmmmm..... public screens huh?  When I tried to do public screens all I 
kept on getting gurus when the program ended.  Maybe I'll have a scan 
through your code myself :)

Yeah, that might be it, actually! :-)

Anyway, what I'm trying to do, is emulate a C construct called a union. In
short, a union is several variables sharing the same dataspace - so you
could have a byte and a word and according to what you'd need, you would use
the particular variable. As in the example above, where union1 and union2
has the same address.

Hey, maybe I need to use EVEN alignment too?

But thanks for sorting out the label error

Subject: Stack full error

	Hi all, Here's a peculiar problem that everyone probably knows the
answer to but me.
	When my game runs for any length of time I get stack full errors.
I'm jumping to a statement to move my tanky that contains the joystick
routines and it seems to get a stack full at this point. It seems ok when
you drive around but leave it alone for 3 mins and it errors.
	Any ideas? Increasing stack obviously only delays the prob.

I could increase stack to about 1meg ;) and put a time limit in the game.

Cheers,

Subject: Cheapo Blitz user

Hi all,
	If these questions appear more than once I  am sorry, but first time I possible sent them to the wrong address, so I'll try again.

	I am using the version of Blitz2 that was given away on Amiga Format (Cheapo blitz user). My Amiga is 100 miles away so I may have gotten mixed up about a few things. 8)

	1: What can anyone tell me about Blitz 3, when is it due out? (and is it worth me buying blitz2 now, or waiting for blitz3)

	2: Bitmaps saved in blitz load OK in DpaintIV but not in DpaintIII, not really a problem, but any ideas why?

	3: List are great, but is there a way of finding the internal pointer value for the list (ie. if the list is on item 3, is there a command that returns the value 3?)

	4: Using the Toggle command on a gadget leaves an 'inversed' boarder around it. This boarder is only removed when the gadget is toggled again. Any idea how to stop this boarder appearing?

	5: Is there a limit as to how many gadetlists you can have. In a program I am writing I have 4 or 5 gadgetlist but whenever I try an add another I get a error. Is it Blitz or am I just crap?

	6: Anyone got any ideas what to do with a copy of Amos Pro (brought before Blitz 2 was around 8(  )

thanks in advance

Try changing the number of objects of that type in the comiler options window.

There's no real way to do unions 'properly' in Blitz Basic. However, you 
can do a kludge in NEWTYPEs to sort of do them. Arrays in newtypes can be 
made to have '0' elements, allowing you to assign the same field to 
different names...

NEWTYPE.demo
a.w[0]
b.w
END NEWTYPE

Blitz allows you to access and array element without the braces 
('[',']')...allowing you to use the same field as either 'a' or 'b'...

d.demo\a=10
d.demo\b=20
Nprint d.demo\a

will both alter the same field of the d.demo, so the above will print '20'.

Hope this is helpful...

I've had fun with Toggle recently too.. I think I just set the flags
for the textgadget I was creating to 0 so had no toggle or box
select. The gadget still flashes when hit but doesn't have the naff
border. 

    Hope that helps...

Can't you just use the various forms of peek and poke to get these
results?

e.g.

a.l=10
b.q=peek.q(&a)

It's not as clean as a C union (or a Fortran equivalence), but it does
the job. (Or does it?)

BTW: Why do you want to do this?

It's because your using the like WB tag,  this tag requires OS 3.0+ to work.  I think
you need to find the DisplayID for the WB screen then use the #SA_DisplayID tag to open
your screen with it.

I might be a tad goofy, because I haven't done a heck of a lot with 
joystick routines, but with windows, it remembers things that happened 
for you, so you cant miss your subroutine with the gdaget pushes... There 
is a command to flush this "queue", maybe theres something like that that 
you need. I sure hope that made sence....

Subject: VAL() Troubles

Hello Acid Software,

                    Is it not possible to dessign a val() command without any
calculation errors because it designed to used for floates. I use a ASCII
config file and the long vars from Monitor_ID's are very high longs. something
like this decimal 1073872900. I use Nprint to write it to config. But ! When i
try to use edit() or val(edit$()) then number loaded and placed in a long is
not exactly like writen in the config. A value lost of -4 (decimal)

I use now the hex$ and hex# to write and get the value. It's not anymore a
decimal value but how cares. Could val() not be fixt or could you not create a
new command for future blitz releases ? Otherwise whe are never able to get any
high long vars from ASCII files. I know MKL$ could be a solution but gives
problems for making it accesable for ASCII editors and a little difficult to
read dont you think. ;-)

Please look at my earleyer posted message (code) of "Re: Screen Troubles,
Public screens" to Hang for the WBWitdh and WBHight bug, please check it out if
you find some time. ;-)

Stack errors usually occur when you exit out of a 'For/Next' loop or 
'Gosub' with a 'Goto' instead of the usual 'Next' or 'Return'. If you 
need to 'Goto' out of a for/next loop...use 'Pop For' before the goto. 
With goubs, use 'Pop Gosub'. Same with 'Select'...use 'Pop Select' if you 
want to Goto out of a Case/Default...

Ok.  Heres a  prob for someone to solve - How do I get a mouse pointer in

Anyone got this to work and fancy sending me some example code?

To do a mouse pointer you'd have to use the Mouse/MouseX/MouseY commands 
to get the status/position of the mouse, then use DisplaySprite to redraw 
the onscreen position.  Depending on how fast your main loop runs, you 
could have this under interrupt, or you could just run it inside a main loop.
Use something like this (plz ignore any obvious errors!) inside your program:

		Mouse On
		Repeat
			VWait
			x=MouseX
			y=MouseY
			DisplaySprite mydisp,x,y,mychannel
		Until Joyb(0)

If you have two displays and want the pointer to 'travel' across both of 
them, you'll have to have to DisplaySprite commands, and correct the 
pointer position to be correct on both displays.

Subject: Clouds and including shape in binary

Hi to everone on the BlitzList.

  This is my first mail to the Blitz-List, and for a change I though I
would'nt start with a question.  The questions come towards the end:)
First I thought I would include a new version of the Clouds.bb program
that came with BUM7.  As the Blitz Cycle command doesn't work (correct
me if I'm wrong), I wrote a little routine to do a single palette cycle.
While I was at it I also fixed a little bug so electrical works, and
made a bit of a speed increase.

Thanks go to LES, as I probably wouldn't have bothered with the
assembler if it wasn't for the brilliant new debugger!


Now for the question.  I wanted to include a shape into an executable.
I have tried using the Cludge and Decode commands for both bitmaps and
shapes, but with very little success.  The cludge commands seem to
always crash on my machine (or my code!), and the decode commands don't
seem to initialise the objects properly. ie after decoding, a
Use Bitmap 0 causes a Bimap not intialised error.  If anyone could post
an example onto Blitz-list, I for one would find it extremely useful.


Thanks in advance

That would be great. And Simon what do you think ?

Subject: Home made Libraries!

 Hello People,
 
 Questions about Developers Library Tutorial
 
1)  Could someone tell me what !ufunction,!ustatement,!acommnad,!putargs
     !args,!repargs,!putlibs,!libs and !dumtoke are used for?
   
2)  What does the $1380 and $1102 mean in the following !libs{} macro
   
     !astatement
     !args{#word,#word,#word,#word,#word,#word,#string,#long}
     !libs{#mygadtoolslib,$1380,#intuifontlib,#la0,#screenslib,$1102}
     !subs{_gtbutton+1,0,0}
     !name{"GTButton","GTList#,id,x,y,w,h,Text$,flags"}

3)  Do you have to save A3 register (Used to build temp. strings) if
     your function is not going to return a string?

4)  When !afunction returns a string does
                          D0=string length (not including NULL),
                          A3=Points to last letter of string?
     I think this is correct because it seems to work.

5)  How do u specify an optional prameter in a !afunction or !astatement?

     e.g.
        !astatement
        !args{#word,#word,#word}
        !libs{#graphicslib,#la6}
        !subs{_Draw_Line,Error_Check_Draw_Line,0}
        !name{"MY_Line","X,Y,[Colour]"}

	When compiling a program that uses MY_Line blitz will only
	compile it if all three prameters are specified else I get
	a Syntax Error
	i.e.
		MY_Line 10,20,3		- Compiles Ok.
		MY_Line 10,20		- Does not Compile (Syntax Error)

6)  Is there a way of acquaring a pointer, to the data stucker of the currently
     active window, from within a library.
     

  Any information on the above question would be muchly appreciated.
  
    Regards

1) I launched alt.sys.amiga.blitz again in order to try to
make it more widespread. This time it's unmoderated.

2) I have been in laserkirurgy and my rigth eye have been 
operated, that's why I haven't replied to all messages which
have been posted to me (the operation was nothing serious, I just
want to see better without glasses).

Being no stranger to operations myself over the past few months, can I say, on behalf of all subscribers, that I hope everything is now tickety boo.

Anyone know how to write catalogs and support them - is there some kind of
standard way they should be constructed, or could i just make a sequential
file and read the texts from that?
Anyone know/Have access to any info on it?

Subject: GadTools

Hello ppl,
	I've been doing some messing around with gadtools and have come 
across a big problem.  I seem to have an old version of the library 
source that has a listview GTSetAttrs problem.  You cannot set any 
details for the listview in my version.  Simon - any chance of some 
updated source so I can move my command updates/fixes into the latest 
version for distribution?

	New commands added are:

		DetachGTList - detach a list from a window - cool :)
		GTGimmeCludge- gadget position cludge for GimmeZeroZero windows

I've also added runtime error code for the AttachGTList so that it won't 
let you attach the same list to a window twice.....

My VS-Includes have a new routine that detaches and adds normal Blitz 
gadgets to/from windows.  Its on the ftp site and aminet, and you can mail me
for it.  If anyone wants to convert it to libraies then go ahead.
BUT - Im not entirely sure that this works too well under WB1.3
Anyone wanna confirm/deny this?

Subject: Gadtools again

Hello ppl,
	well I've managed to track down the bug in my version of the gt 
library after only 3 or 4 hours.  My version now works fully (hopefully!) 
with listviews (big bug in GTSetAttrs).  Although I'm curious about what 
happens when you create a listview.  From the code, I assume that two 
gadgets are created - 1 for the selection, the other for the scroll/drag 
bar.  Anybody know whether this is true?

	Anyway, if ppl want an updated library with the following 
commands added then just give us a mail:

		DetachGTList
		GTGimmeCludge
		GTSetSelect - listview command, sets selected number + 
moves the list view so that this number is visible.

I use always a program for that, EasyCatalog, works great. Creating your own

Please email me everything I need to know about the "blitz-list", I've got 
no idea what it is and how to take part... My email address is a german 
ZConnect BBS and I've access to the internet through a gateway at the

Every line of text in the list view is ALSO a gadget and in 2.0 they have 
id of 1,2,3,4,5... which is why you get the conflict with blitz when it 
searches through the gadgetlists comparing user id's (would have though 
the fact they call them user id's would mean the deadheads would not use 
the field for internal/os gadgets...)

Matt,
  Remember that you have to do a CatchDosErrs after opening a
window on your screen.  I don't know, however, if you can do it
without opening a window on your screen (ie, is it possible to do a
RTEZLoadfile after opening a screen, but no windows??).

I hope that at least this little bit of info helps,
Dave

Hello ppl,
	loads have requested the GTLib update, I'll be getting it off to 
people later today.  Theres also yet another command added to it: 
GTFreeGadget - frees up a gadget on a gtlist (handles multi-gadget 
GadTools gadgets like listviews).  This command can only be called whilst 
ther GTList is unattached (e.g. before AttachGTList or after a 
DetachGTList).  Also gadget imagery must be removed manually from the 
window (the library does not do this for you).  This applies to 
DetachGTList as well as GTFreeGadget.

it currently contains 4 commands ....

	TimerReset			; was ResetTimer which was never

	GetDeviceList(flags)		; lock the DOS list
	NextDevice
	FreeDeviceList

(I forget who suggested the DOS list stuff but its in there)

Subject: AutoScroll (from Neil's Reqlib), and Screen Aspect ratios

G'day all,
  Just two quick quest)ons today 8-).

  First of all, how do you tell if the AutoScroll gadget is
selected with /Neil's Screen Requester??  For me, it just seems to
return a 0 all of the time, thus not allowing AutoScroll.

  Secondly, can someone tell me how to work out what the aspect
ratio of the currently selected screen is (ie, is it 1:1, or 2:1
(or is that 1:2))??  Is there some flag in a system structure, or
do you have to work it out by hand, and if so how??

Thanks in advance,
Dave

In this case, open a backdrop window on the screen.  This uses no extra 
bitplane memory.

I've tried without success to get the autoscroll flag to come up with the 
correct information.  Like you, all I get back is 0.  All I can suggest 
is that you have a look at the source (which is on x2ftp I think) and 
then get loads of information about Reqtools to find out what structure 
it returns from the screenmode requester.

Subject: General BLitz Problems

Hi Everyone,

I'm having a few problems with my old Blitz programming and
I was wondering if anyone could perhaps point me in the right
directions.

1) In AMIGA mode I've been using GetAShape to grab parts of a
   bitmap. I have then used both Blit and Wblit (on separate
   occasions) to restore those parts of the bitmap. However,
   all works fine until the size of the rectangle to be grabbed
   gets to about 3/4 the size of the screen (working at 640x512).
   When the image gets restored, it is fairly corrupted and won't
   restore correctly. As I mentioned earlier I have tried both
   Blit and WBlit and they both give the same result so I think
   the problem lies within GetAShape. Anybody encountered similar?

2) No matter how many times I try I cannot manage to get the
   Super-Hires example to work using the Screen command as detailed
   in the Blitz User Mags 1-5 (in the user guide). Any ideas?

3) I want the do some serial communications and I want to be able to
   set up an interrupt to process the bytes of info as they arrive.
   I would like to know if I could use SetInt to monitor a particular
   data byte to identify whether or not to process the info or not.
   I've had a little experience of interrupts through assembler
   directly, but not a lot. Any help would be much appreciated.

4) Any ideas on when BUM 8 is due out?

5) Is it possible to modify the graphics of a ShapeGadget once it
   setup on the screen without having to recreate the gadget list
   from scratch?

6) Is there any way to use fonts of any type and size on a bitmap
   without having to open a full-size borderless window to achieve
   the same effect?

7) Is there a complete set of Screen modes, window flags and IDCMP
   flags defined anywhere? The manuals aren't an exhaustive list.

8) When Blit-ting is it possible to get it to blit all the shapes
   pixels even if they are not set. E.G if an image exists and the
   shape to be blitted contains some background colour pixels, the
   original image shows through. E.G.

    Note: the numbers represent the colours

9) Is it possible to get anything other that Lores or Hires Slices?
   E.G Interlace, AGA, etc...


Well I think that's about it for the time being. No doubt that I will
think of something just after I post this message.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Cheers.

G'day all,
  I am in desparate need of this info, so if anyone can tell me how
it is done, I would be greatly appreciative.

  Anyway, what I would like to know, is how to legally determine
whether an intuition screen is using LowRes.  I've tried to
comprehend what the RKM Libraries says, but I just can't work it
out.  (I'm using at least KS2, so 1.3 compatability is not a
concern).

Subject: GetFile Gadget in GadTools - How???

G'day all,
  Yet another question which I require an urgent answer to ( 8-) ).

  How do I create a proper getfile gadget, often seen in Wb2+
progs, by using gadtools??

  What I've done so far, is create an image of the getfile icon,
including border, and then using GTShape.  This works, except, when
it is selected, the highlighting isn't consistant with gadtools -
ie, the background doesn't become the normal colour of a selected
gad, and the main image of the gad, doesn't remain its original
colour.  What is happening, is as far as I can tell, just a direct
colour inversion, using OR.  

  If anyone can tell me how to do it correctly, I would be very
apprecative.  If you don't know what type of gad I'm looking for,
take a look at BUM5/BlitzBlank.  Its used for the path selection.
I've tried using the source for this prog, but it is extremely
cludgy, and if possible, I'd like a neater solution  (plus I don't
really understand what the author's done 8-)  ).

Thanks in advance (again),
Dave

Have two shapes, and use the GTShape with two shape numbers.  The second 
should be the first with an inverted border and filled in inside.  Then 
when the user clicks the gadget you'll get a nice gadtools look to it.

GetAShape has massive cache problems on anything higher than an 020 - 
this might be what you're getting.  Try switching off your caches to see 
what happens.

If you're using the screentags command to open the screen (OS2.0+) then 
you can use the #Quiet tag (I think).  This tag stops intuition doing any 
rendering to your screen - and should stop it drawing a title bar.

I'm not sure - I know all the blit commands in blitz check to see if 
they're in amiga mode and then own/disown blitter if they are.  Not sure 
about WBlit though - it might go through the OS (and probably does 
actually to get the window clipping).

There is no free list command in blitz, since blitz lists are not proper

Theoretically this should work okay, sounds strange that it doesn't.  
Anyway, you really shouldn't be trying to setup an interrupt inside there 
anyway.

This is illegal, since it negates the benefits of having statements - 
inside a statement, there should be no code visible from the main program 
when inside a statement or function.  There should (will) be no variables 
visible from the main program either (unless they're shared).  If you 
want to branch outside, then use a subroutine instead of a statement.

Blitz doesn't support this - its probably the same reason why you can't 
have an interrupt inside a statement.

Because youve defined a already in line [1] as just a word, so you wont be
able to redefine it as a list.  delete lkine [1] and change line [2] to

Dim List a.w(20)

(I _think_ this is the probolem)
You may well get stack errors - im not sure - you need to free the list (like
your question asked which i dont know how to do.  there may be some cludgy 
poking around you could do....

And you cant do it inside a repeat loop.  This _IS_ annoying, but maybe its a
system thang (doubt it).  I agree that this is a BUG.

How on earth did you expect that to work?  That is severely shit coding anyway!
Why the hell not do another subroutine???

Well, maybe it is possible....try pop statement before it for each statement 
you have called through to get back to the subroutines level.  This might do
the trick.  It wouldnt return nicely though (AFAIK)

Maybe, but this is Blitz.  If you want C++ then go and get it and use that!
And isnt this good enough....

statement b{}

end statement

statement a{}

Dont know - discovered this myself 2 nights ago, but havent tried to get 
round it.  I suspect when the gadget is created theres some pointer stored in
the gadget object type to the gfx required (explaining why you must have the 
shape in memory before you can define the gadget).  You can probably just 'sneak into' the gadget data and change the pointer for the gfx to the new gfx.

Maybe something like.... (off the top of my head, and i dont know the gadget
newtype)....

*gl.gadgetlist=peek.l(addr gadgetlist (l))   ; get gadgetlist l info
*g.gadget=*gl\gadget[n]                      ; get specific gadget n info
*g\image=addr shape(s)                       ; chaange the address for image.

This might be about right - youll need the appropriate newtype stuff for it
though from amigalibs.res/back of manual.  If its possible, itll be along those
lines.  ;}

yup - blit with excess on (or should that be off - i can never remember)  ;}

Blit shape,x,y,ExcessOn/Off  -> eg:  Blit 7,100,50,on

But surely we should be able to do a setint from inside a statement or a 
repeat loop?  It is rather annoying that i have to do all setints outside of 
a repeat loop, and turn the code on/off by a variable...

setint 5
  if INTON
	...
  endif
end setint

so i turn it on/off as i need it.  It works but is annoying.

To get a shape to blit all its pixels, even the cookie-less ones, set
BlitMode or whatever manually. Appendix 2 (?) in the Blitz manual
describes how to set up a minterms code for the blitter. What you want
is that in all cases dest=input channel pointing to the shape source.
I don't have my manual on me, but I think its pretty easy to work out.

There is an IDCMP flag table (I think) and Windows flag (I think) in

I understand... but I don't know how to help.. :-(  If the shapes you
are blitting don't use all the colours available in the mode you are
in eg 32 in lores then you need to reserve 0.. but that might not be
suitable and I guess you wouldn't have asked if it was.

At a guess it will be related to Blitter stuff and the Cookie Cut - if
you can make the cookiecut the WHOLE of the shape then you're
sorted..! .. I'm guessing as you may have noticed (yup! - ED).

Oh well.. not much help was I!?

    Byeee...

Despite there being no free list command, it is posslible to redim the array
with a new size.  If the array is dimmed with a size of zero then this will
effectively be the same as a FREE command.  This is done by just calling the 
DIM command with the same variable name.  (This isn`t too clear from the
documentation.  I only found out about it by reading the previous messages
sent to the blitz list, a copy of which can be found on aminet)

I think the reason for this is that the maximum size of a shape is a lot
smaller than that for a bitmap.  I`m not exactly sure what the maximum size
is, but from the shape object structure I think the maximum size is 64K.
That should be enough to hold 640x512 in one bitplane, but with more bitplanes
it would exceed this limit.  (640x512 in 1 bitplane is about 40k, in 2
bitplanes about 80k etc.)  Is there any need to do this anyway?  There are
commands for copying bitmaps and showing bitmaps, so do you need to use shapes?
If you do, you could split the screen up into a number of smaller chunks.


I hope this was of some use.

I thought that the "Excess On/Off" stuff was related to "spare
bitplanes" not colours etc. In other words if your shape onlu uses
colours 0..15 then the fifth bitplane is undefined.. always 0.. so
should it be 0 or 1 when blitted... then again I may be wrong!

you`re right.  Whoops.
I think the command needed is to do with Jam modes.  like WJam.  i think the
one for blits is just jam.  There are several settings (4 i think) that can
force the colours to be overlaid.

Maybe i got it right this time.  ;}

I assumed that most ppl wouldn't be interested in the source and that it 
would not be much us to them.  Obviously, though, there will be ppl like 
yourself who'd like it.  I'll try and arrange to get it sent off to you, 
okay? :)

Well the way I do it is rip the gadget from workbench (with a screen grabber)
then i get it into brilliance (or pain program) MAKE SURE YOU RIP BOTH THE
SCREEN WHEN THE GADGET IS IN UNSELECTED AS WELL AS SELECTED MODE...
hence two images. Then in brilliance get the two images and do whatever you
do to make them shapes....
In your blitz2 program after you initialize the shapes(load or
incbin/decode)... 
 
USE ShapeGadget (not GTshapegadget) 
 
Syntax: ShapeGadget GadgetList#,X,Y,Flags,Id,Shape#,Shape#
                                             ------ ------ 
         #of shape ofgadget in unselcted state__|      |
                                                       |
         #of shape ofgadget in selected  state  _______

 If you want I can UUencode a picture with imagery ... Hope this helps

 What do you mean...You can have anyfont. Do you mean sensing like

Yes.. sounds right(ish) .. I've never used it for shapes..

I think you'll need mode 0 (or 1) .. modes 0 and 1 do:

    o   background and foreground printed

    o   just foreground printed so background transparent

Check in the manual..

I'd not thought of using it for shapes.. interesting!

No, I can do that easily.  The problem seems to be the spacing of
the menus (ie, the inversed selection box in the title bar of the
screen of the currently selected menu).  Another problem I've
faced, is when using proportional fonts in menus (probably
shouldn't use 'em, but they look nice 8-)).  With these, its hard
to work out the proper spacing for the keyboard shortcuts.

Normally, for the shortcut problem, you just have spaces in there
to pad out the menu, but, with prop fonts, the space char is of
variable size, so consequently, the amiga key gad, sometimes
overwrites the menu item's text.

Hope you can all understand that 8-).

Thanks Steve and Tom.
  However, what I'd really like, is a font sensative gadget - ie,
one which changes size according to the size of the font.

Currently, I've got around it, by creating a gadget with the word
"GET" in it, but I much prefer to have the nice little piccy in
there 8-).

Thanks again,
Dave

G'day all,
  I think I've come across another bug 8-(.

  When using WindowFont with the normal WindowOpen command,
everything works fine and dandy, however, if I use it with a window
opened with WindowTags, the debugger kicks in with a "Guru!!
Illegal"  (or something to that affect).

  Is it possible that this command can be updated to allow the
setting of a windows font??

Thanks in advance,

also try another makecookie on the shape once it is got. There is a

OK, instead of a vwait, you wait for an interupt routine to count up to

What you can do is use the blitz scale command to actually resize the 
shape imagery before you render it.  A better way, though, would be to 
hold the image as a series of coordinates, and then draw the image from 
scratch.  This way your image would never become blocky.

I presume they are not Intuition Window objects but something else..

And why does no-one answer my questions about the "Advanced
Programmers Kit"? :-( .. Simon!? .. if it doesn't exist then
fine.. just tell me!!

Whats a good PD "file manager" program for A500s .. I could get CU
Amiga as that has (had) Opus on the front.

Just thought I would ask...

    Thanks,

        Colin.

I have put in a GTFreeGadget to the Gadtools library - it should be 
fairly easy to do the same for the standard gadgets.

Ooooo bugger :)

At the moment, with my updated gadtools library the first image connected 
to a GTShape gadget will stay unique, but the second WILL get corrupted - 
I'll fix this as soon as poss.

As for gadtools, perhaps you should brush up on the amiga operating

tools who wanted to write fancy applications hence the word gadtools:)

Subject: Troubles with Changing Gadtools gad on open window

G'day all (specifally Steve),
  I am currently having problems changing the size etc of my
gadtools gadgets on open wins (used for font sensitivity).

  currently, what I am doing is this:
  ; Previously, gadtool list 2 has been set up
  ; containing gadgets with id's 30-36.

  DetachGTList 2
  GTFreeGadget 2,30
  GTFreeGadget 2,31
  GTFreeGadget 2,32
  GTFreeGadget 2,33
  GTFreeGadget 2,34
  GTFreeGadget 2,25
  GTFreeGadget 2,36

  ;I then re-define the gads
  ; .. and then
  
  InnerCls : AttachGTList 2,#prefwin

When the "AttachGTList" is executed, I end up getting two of every
gadget!!  However, I had been able to change the gads in one other
win, BUT, I could only change n-1 gads, else the computer just spat
the dummy (ie, I did the following previous to the above code)

  ; Previously, gadtool list 0 has been set up
  ;  containing gadgets with id's 10-13

  DetachGTList 0
  GTFreeGadget 0,10
  GTFreeGadget 0,11
  GTFreeGadget 0,12
  GTFreeGadget 0,13

  ; then redefinition of gads,
  ; .. and finally

  Use Window #coordwin : InnerCls : AttachGTList 0,#coordwin
  Use Window #prefwin

This makes the machine die.  If I remove the line "GTFreeGadget
0,13", however, the previous gads (10-12), are altered correctly,
and only appear once on the window (as they should).

If someone can help me sort out my problem, I would be EXTREMELY
greatful, as I need it desparately, as I wish to submit my prog to
Acid for inclusion in the new version of Blitz 8-).

Thanks in advance,
Dave

 I think I've worked out what was going wrong, so I might as well
let everyone know (and show what a fool I am 8-).
  Anyway, each time I was jumping into these particular statements,
I was redefining the gtlist, without first free the current gads.
Consequently, it appears that you can create as many gadgets as you
want in the same list, with the same gadId, and therefore when
trying to remove a gad, I gather you only remove the latest version
that was created (leaving all the previous ones untouched).

  I still haven't worked out this problem though (maybe in another
1/2 hours time 8-).

Subject: Another update

Hello ppl,
	I've done another update to gadtools that fixes completely and 
utterly all GTShape related problems (I hope :) ).  They now setup 
properly, CAN have unique shape imagery and free properly.  New update is 
available from me if ppl want it - inside the archive received is the 
complete source code for the library.

	Onto OS2.0 listview + redrawing problems....  Errrmmmm well god 
knows why listviews don't redraw properly after a GTChangelist -  I'll be 
looking into it though :)


thank you for your attention,
Steve Mc.

PS: Uploading my map editor to simon and aminet today if anybody is 
interested....... :)

Subject: Debugger

To those interested,
	the debugger now understands the amiga includes file call 
structure.offsets.  This means now that you can open a window and specify 
a type from this file to put into the window.  An example would be Gadget 
- open the window with this type, point it at the address of your gadget 
(GadPtr(list,id)) and the look at all those luvly helpful values the 
debugger puts up.  These windows would exactly the same as the object 
windows currently in the debugger but have the advantage in that they are 
defined independant of the debugger.  Thus this file can be updated (with 
your own structures if you like) in the future without recompiling the 
debugger source.

Anyway, just thought I'd share that with you guys.... You know, just in 
case anyone was interested (and was having grief programming using OS 
structures).... :)

  Yes I do!

  Oh, you want to know??? ;)

  Use GetDisplayInfoData_ , after calling FindDisplayInfo_ and possibly 
NextDisplayInfo_

  I haven't actually used these yet, but I am planning to VERY soon, so 
if you need a more in-depth description of how to use these calls, just 
let me know, and I'll get back to you as quickly as possible!

  Hi there,

     Don't mean to bug you, but would it be possible for to you to give 
the Debugger a ScreenMode requester?  I like to mode-promote it DBLNTSC, 
and while it works, the windows still only size to a 640x200 size, 
because that's how big they THINK the screen is, although I've promoted 
it to 680x450... 

     It's no big deal, it would just make more code visible at once... an 
easier way for you might be to Clone the WB...

Failing this, is there a way I could place a blank cover over the gadgets

You know, I was thinking about similiar things, like making gadgets all 
different colors, and although I haven't tried it, I bet you could use 
the copper for an easy(ish) fix... Either for just vertical changes, like 
the listview, or horizontal changes too, they can do it for copper 
screens, right? 

Or maybe not.

At the moment all debugger windows are limited to 640x256.  This is 
nothing to do with the screen size, rather it is a size I selected near 
the start of the project.  You see, all windows use a buffer bitmap that 
gets rendered to and then BitmapToWindow'ed into the relevant window.  I 
could increase the size of this buffer (thus making mem usage go up) 
which would allow you to have bigger windows.

Screen mode requester is on the list of things I should have put in by 
now :)

Take a look at Virtual Worlds (its on aminet), and see what i did - if you some

  Most of the above is best done using direct acces to the library (which 
isn't very hard)... I believe there's a third party MED lib that might 
help you out (forgot the name)...

  But octaplayer.library is easy to use... just download the developer's 
kit that was just posted to AmiNet, convert the fd file, and you're there!

  You must open a window to legally remove or change the pointer.  
Without a window, you can't do much in a screen anyway... why not just 
open a borderless window?

POINTERS ON SCREENS
-------------------

In a word, no.  A pointer must be attached to a window.  However, it is quite
simple to create an invisible screen-sized dummy window and put it on that;
just open the window without any system gadgets (sizing gadget, etc.) and
use the BORDERLESS flag.  If you are planning on opening other windows on this
screen, and of those windows will have depth gadgets, you should also use the
BACKDROP flag. Example:

; Open a Dummy Window to Give Screen a Pointer
#BACKDROP=$100
#BORDERLESS=$800
#ACTIVATE=$1000
LoadShape "PointerShape",0
Screen 0,0,0,640,200,2,$8000,"Example Screen",2,1
Window 0,0,0,640,200,#BACKDROP|#ACTIVATE|#BORDERLESS,"",2,1
WPointer 0
MouseWait

OTHER STUFF ON POINTERS
-----------------------

(I apologize if the below is covered elsewhere, but as I explain below I seemed
destined never to get any BUMs, and so use a very old (1.40 or something)
version.)

While I'm on the subject, here are a few other useful things to know about
pointers.  The bug applies to the (old) version of BB2 that I use; a new
version may correct this.  I couldn't tell you since I've never gotten any of
the BUMs I've paid for (the support for U.S./Canada went from ignoring
me to non-existent recently):

(1) Getting the original mouse pointer back.
    After you set a pointer for a window to a custom shape, how do you get
    the original default pointer back in that window?  Use this:

    ClearPointer_(Peek.l(Addr Window(WINDOW_NUMBER)))

    Where WINDOW_NUMBER is the number of the window whose pointer you wish
    to restore.

(2) "Handle" Bug.
    How do you set the "Hot Spot" of a custom pointer?
    The Handle command expects handles to be offsets from the upper-left
    corner of the shape, but Intuition expects the reverse.  Therefore,
    you must feed the negative of the number you would normally use to get
    the result you expect.  For example, to set the pointer's hot spot at
    6,5 (using shape 0) you need to use Handle 0,-6,-5.


  If you make a brush called "Wait.pointer" of the 2.0+ wait pointer, you
 would use the following:

; Init Wait Pointer
LoadShape 0,"Wait.pointer"
Handle 0,-7,-7

; blah blah blah...

; Busy... put up pointer
WPointer 0

Hope this helps.

Subject: Exists() doesn't unlock file!!

G'day all,
  Just about finished a proper first version of my prog, and have

The problem is Exists().  It gets a lock on a file, but doesn't
unlock it, thus preventing deletion etc.

Any chance of a fix, or some other way around this?  I'm going to
try Lock_() and Unlock_(), and if that doesn't work Open_() and
Close_().

Any other suggestions?

I feel a public apology is in order 8-).

The lock on my file was not to do with Exists(), but rather
something I had done a little earlier tonight.  
After I had had problems with no unlocking, I reset my machine (to
clear the lock), but it wasn't cleared.  I then usd Snoopdos, and
saw that there was no Unlocking, and fails on deletion.  However, I
neglected to realise that I didn't reboot my file server (I'm using
parnet), and as a consequence, the filelock ws never released.

Sorry if I caused any undue stress to anyone 8-).

Yes, Brian, printing things takes a _very_ long time.  First I'll briefly try
to explain why, then I'll try to be helpful and offer some suggestions on
speeding your code up.

Suppose I want to do this:

BitmapOutput 0
Print "Score: "+str$(Score)

What does this involve?

First, the string to be printed must be generated.  Basically this involves:

(1) Get the first bit ("Score: ")
(2) Use a routine that converts the variable (Score) into a string of
    characters that represents the value of the variable.  For example, the
    number 10 would be converted from $0A to $31 $30 $00.
(3) Create a third string by tacking the string from (2) to the end of the
    string from (1).

Now that it knows what to print, it has to print it.  This involves:

(1) Start at the first character of the string to print
(2) Is this the end of the string?  If yes, then quit.
(3) Use the ASCII code of the current character to look up what shape we are
    supposed to plot (using the current font).
(4) Use the blitter to blast the character onto the screen at the current
    cursor position, being careful not to draw outside of the actual screen.
(5) Increment the cursor position and get the next character in the string.
(6) Go to step (2) and continue until the print is finished.

As you can see, that's a LOT of steps to go through for each Print you use.

How can you ease the situation?

Here are strategies you can use alone or in combination to speed up the
printing routine:

[1] Only print what you have to; print constant strings _once_.
    For example, if you are using code like this:

    .main
     Repeat
       Gosub Update
     Forever

     Update:
       Locate X,Y
       NPrint "Player One: "+str$(Score(0))
       Print  "Player Two: "+str$(Score(1))
     Return

     Change your code to this:

    Locate X,Y
    NPrint "Player One: "
    Print  "Player Two: "
    .main
    Repeat
      Gosub Update
    Forever

    Update:
      Locate X+12,Y  :Print str$(Score(0))
      Locate X+12,Y+1:Print str$(Score(1))
    Return

[2] Only print things _when_ they change.
    Use copies of variables to detect when they have changed.  For
    example, if you use code like this:

    ...
    If HitTarget Then Score+100  ; 100 points for hitting target
    ...
    Print str$(Score)

    Change your code to this:

    ...
    If HitTarget Then Score+100  ; 100 points for hitting target
    ...
    If OldScore<>Score Then Print str$(Score):OldScore=Score

[3] Don't print everything every time through.
    If you intend to update the screen at 25 frames per second or so,
    you don't need to update _scores_ that often!  Every 1/6 second or
    thereabouts is usually more than adequate.  Divide your screen updates
    into a number of subjobs, and only do one subjob each time the Update
    routine is called.  For example, if you have code like this:

    Update:
      Print str$(Score(0)) ; Update player 1's score
      Print str$(Score(1)) ; Update player 2's score
    Return

    Change it to look like this:

    Update:
      UpdateFlag=1-UpdateFlag ; this var will toggle between 0`and 1
      If UpdateFlag
        Print str$(Score(0))  ; Update player 1's score
      Else
        Locate X,Y+1
        Print str$(Score(1))  ; Update player 2's score
      EndIf
    Return

(Of course, the above could be written as:
    If UpdateFlag then Locate X,Y+1
    Print str$(Score(UpdateFlag))
 But that would have made the example more confusing)

    For more than two subgroups, of course, use a normal counter:
    n=n+1:if n>#NUMBER_OF_SUBGROUPS_PLUS_ONE then n=0

If you use the above tri#k to get a vaule for a two-player game (as in
Score(0) and Score(1)), and you have to update a LOT (and I mean a LOT) of
things in arrays (eg. X(0/1), Y(0/1), TimeLeft(0/1), etc., etc.), then it will
be faster to use the following:

.main
Repeat
  Player=1-Player
  if Player=0 
    Gosub HandlePlayerOne
  else
    Gosub HandlePlayerTwo
  endif
Forever

HandlePlayerOne:
  Print Score(0):Return

HandlePlayerTwo:
  Print Score(1):Return

Again, this is only an economical tradeoff between speed and code size when
you are updating a LOT of things.

Hope you find the above useful.

WELL... I guess the best advice is (in my opinion) GET AWAY FROM GT AS MUCH

So.... It you want uniformity (and are using GadTools for lotsa stuff) then

But.. if you want something thats not there ... FAKE IT! (shapegadgets)

Seems to work fine. This is great news as x2ftp is little slow
usually. If it's alrigth with you, I will add this to the 
welcoming message. Do you know if there are some limitations
with your server like who can upload and how much, how long
will the files be there and so on ?

I've worked out how its done (if anyone is interested).

*mytask.Task = FindTask_(0)
progname$ = Peek$(*mytask\tc_Node|ln_Name)  ; gets prog's name
a = Reserve(3,255)
l = NameFromLock_(GetProgramDir_,Start(3),255)
progdir$ = Peek$(Start(3))                  ; gets prog's dir
Erase 1

PS.  You could use AllocMem_ etc, but Banks are nicer to use.

Subject: FNS, if anyone is interested.....

There is now an extra library that allows you to use FNS printing as the 
standard output (like using BitmapOutput to get blitz font printing onto 
a bitmap).  The command FNSBitmapOutput selects a bitmap to use, from 
then onwards all commands like:

	Print "Hello"
	Print 10*320
	NPrint "Hello","Hi there"

will have their result printed on the selected bitmap.  The library also 
supports coordinates, so you can use the FNSLocate command to move the 
cursor around (this command is almost compatible with the blitz Locate 
command).

The lib is available if anyone is interested..... I'll get it onto our 
site tomorrow.

Subject: MenuColour


Dear All,

Last night I "discovered" the MenuColour command which means I can now
see my menus!!

In my Graphics Manager the first colours (0..15) are used as the
palette for the shapes that are loaded in. The top 16 colours (16..31)
are then free for the Graphics Manager. So that means I can only
"change" the top half of the palette.

Right, before I found menucolour, the problem was this. Before loading
in the shape palette's I could always see the menu items. But when the
shape's palette was loaded they "vanished" until they were
highlighted.. a bit annoying.

So I used menucolour 24... fine I can see them now.

I then noticed that the highlight colour is (32 - x) where x is the
colour given to menucolour. This is still a problem as it means the
highlight colour is "at the mercy" of the shapes' palette.

Is there anyway to change the way that the highlight colour is chosen?

I could use menucolour 16 but then you'd not know when something was
highlighted!

... got there eventually...

    Thanks in advance,

        colin.

 Dear All,
 	I shall try uploading the new version of ShapeZ to here tomorrow, it
 will only be a beta-release but I think you will find it to be a damn sight
 more powerful than anyother shape tool. Here is a list of features in the
 version for tomorrow:
 
 	o Requires >OS 2.0
 	o Super Fast Auto Scan/Grab for shapes in an IFF
 	o Standard drag box shape cutting from an IFF
 	o Load multiple shape files and apend them to each other.
 	o Fully featured Shape _EDITOR_ with the following drawing/editing 
 	  tools:
 		- Free Hand
 		- Line
 		- Circle
 		- Box
 		- Fill
 		- Spray Can
 		- Undo/Redo
 		- Resize/Rescale
 		- Edit Palette
 		- Flip and Rotate (of course!)
 	o All wrapped up an a nice OS and user friendly interface!
 
 For those of you who are fimiliar with myself and the lads from Leading Edge
 (used to be R.I.) We got together a few weeks ago and have decided to
 join forces for futre projects. Through this and further discussions, I shall> be adding extra functionality to Shapez before the final release, in other
 words, another list of things to be added.
 
 	o Arexx port. This is mainly to facilitate communication between
 	the Map Editor and Shapes but will also allow arexx scripts to be
 	run from a click of the button...
 
 	o Dump a shapes file to an IFF ready for editing in Dpaint or
 	whatever help the changeover to ShapeZ.
 
 	o Remap a shape/all shapes to a new palette, not just changing
 	colours be real dpaint like remapping.
 
 To all those people I owe stuff to, I hope to be sorting out my life this
 week, but please give me time, as I have a PhD, a job and a game
 to write!
 
 	Thanks for your support and patience,
 
 	Nigel Hughes

I guess this maybe too late for Blitz ABC, but there's still the old
bug with BitmapOutput: characters with ascii value >159 will not
be printed (and I think that there are some problems with characters
with ascii value >127 as well).

Or is this because of blitz's default font ?

Anyway, when printing the listing of program, the same problem
occurs - all scandinavian alphapets will disappear.

Another annoying thing is that TED handles ä (a with dots) and ö (o with dots)
in a non-standard way, and some chars you can't write at all in TED.
(Like the second char in my Last name, an a with a circle on top.)

I would have thought that the print command would print the "Score: "

Wouldn't it be quicker to first get the length of the output string and

Yes. And you forgot such niceties as allocating ram for the strings etc.

A good suggestion. Although I did some testing on this theory with GFABasic

Would it not be more logical to have the printing code branch to only when
you need to update the scores. Ie there must be code to detect a collision
or some other event which causes the score to be increased. It makes sence
to update the score in this routine.

 LJ> Hope you find the above useful.

Some good advice. Being primarily a BBS programmer, I do LOTS of work with
strings, and I spend many hours trying to speed up my programs by reducing
the text output. This is required for the poor souls who have 2400 baud or
less.

Don't know if this was meant in your question:

I think there is another way to access the dir your program was launched
from, on OS2+ you can use PROGDIR: as device name in your program.

and  also  the german ones, "ß" (ASCII 225) is still not accepted, and
Edit$()  is  unable  to read these characters! This means that you are
unable to write e.g. a simple text editor using blitz2 commands.

This MUST be fixed in ABC, otherwise all german (and other non-english
users) will bite off my head, as they can't get Simon's ;-))

And  throw  TED  in  the  trashcan,  please  ...  What's  about  an ED

okay,  I  will  send  Simon  a  detailed bug list the next days again,

There is a command StringSort in our libraries that will sort a linked 
list based on one item in the newtype for the list.  This item must be a 
string (the acid command sortlist has to my knowledge never supported 
strings).

Hi All,

Just wondering wether its worth the effort working direct with
gadtools.library instead of Blitz's inbuilt GT handling in order to create
a smaller executable?

I have just been doing some tests, and it appears that certain functions
really bloat a program.

Sortlist is not useable for my purpose because i have to sort about 4000 string
variables with a length of 50 characters. sortlist can as far as i know sort
only nummeric variables, or am I wrong?

Subject: Making routines into user libraries

Hi again,

I've been trying to turn the TextEntry routines (from Mark Tiffany) into a user
library.  I added the lib macros to the beginning of the source (like in the
libsdev examples) did some renaming of the routines to accomodate the change,
but when I compile the whole thing it always blows up with "constant not
defined" (or something very similar) on the last !subs statement.  If I comment
out that block of macros, the error moves to the next-to-last !subs statement.
I comment out that block, the error moves up, etc., until I've commented every
lib macro out.

Anyone have any ideas?  I've followed the examples to the tee (the user manual
appears to be incorrect).

I think the problem with the sortlist command is that most BASIC programers
still use standard issue array's.

Subject: Problem with RI's cd.lib

G'day all (especially the boys from RI),
  I've been messing around with the cd commands on my cd32+sx-1,
and have come across a problem, which seems like it may be a bug.

  It concerns the use of CDUpdateInfo.

WBToScreen 0
Window 0,100,100,200,30,$8,"CDPlayer",1,0
t.l = 0
ResetTimer

If OpenCD
  CDReadTOC
  CDPlayTrack 9,1

  Repeat
    VWait
    ev.l = Event

    If Timer-t >= 50
      t = 0
      ResetTimer
      CDUpdateInfo
      WLocate 0,0
      Format "00"
      Print CDTrackMins,":",CDTrackSecs
    EndIf
  Until ev = $200
  CDStop
  VWait 50
  CloseCD
EndIf

If this program is run, for the first time, the display in the
window doesn't updates correctly, and if the close gadget is
selected, nothing happens, and when the song has finished playing,
the machine resets.  However, if I comment out the CDUpdateInfo
line, the prog works as required (apart from updating the time
info).

Am I doing somthing wrong, or is there a bug in that command??

I have been able to get CDUpdateInfo to work, but when it does, the
window will close, but the cd isn't stopped, and the second time it
is run, when the song is finished, the machine resets.

Anyway, thanks for any info,
Dave

You probably need the 'libmacs.res' file...this should be entered into 
the compiler options/resident files field.

I've noticed programs bloating up myself - but when you think of the size 
of some of the blitz libraries anyway (windowslib - 12k odd) then you see 
why things start getting bigger.

What'd be *incredibly* useful would be a button on blitz that after 
compiling gave you a list of libraries that were included in your 
program.  That way you could cut down on the use of commands and write 
simple replacements that cut out the need to large libraries to be 
included (there's no point in including a 10k lib in a program if it only 
uses 100bytes of code from it).

is not used.

Is this already known about Simon, and can it be fixed soon.

I've noticed programs bloating up myself - but when you think of the size 
of some of the blitz libraries anyway (windowslib - 12k odd) then you see 
why things start getting bigger.

What'd be *incredibly* useful would be a button on blitz that after 
compiling gave you a list of libraries that were included in your 
program.  That way you could cut down on the use of commands and write 
simple replacements that cut out the need to large libraries to be 
included (there's no point in including a 10k lib in a program if it only 
uses 100bytes of code from it).

I always thought ClearList completely clears a list out so by that it 
points to the beginning of a list. 

I have my doubts though about the list being completely cleared. If I 
delete nodes from the list using clearlist and then add new nodes 
using  additem, the data field (in my case a string) of the old nodes 
is present in newly added nodes. 

Do I really have to go through the whole list and clear each string 
by hand? Or am I doing something wrong?

Yup, list handling was implemented in Blitz to be as fast as possible, 
unfortunately this means you need to initialise new items yourself.

Subject: FileRequest$ being silly...


Hello All...

Okay.. so I was happily programming away for my Graphics Manager last
night.. all was "hunky dory".. and I made "one last change" before
calling it a day... but then weird things started happening....

    o   I use FileRequest$ to get the name of a .sha file

    o   And I use FileRequest$ to get the name of a .iff file for the
        palette of the shapes.

Last night, my final addition had nothing to do with the file system
_BUT_ when I try to use FileRequest$ to get the .iff (after .sha file
loaded) it returns immediately _without_ showing the file requester,
and so has the empty string as the returned string.. very odd!

Some hints/ideas..

    o   When I tried to load a large shapes file it ran out of memory!
        This has never happened before and the avail mem was far lower
        than normal ie 150k lower.

        To load a file I "scan" the file to count the number of shape
        using a small (32 bytes) block of allocated memory which is
        freed, and then load it in. 

    o   This addition necessitated a 150% increase.. but not when I
        reloaded BB2 and recompiled.

    o   The addition performed a XFlip on the selected shapes and so
        had nothing to do with files... ie the shapes are loaded when
        you use it.. well try to.

Thats all I can think of.. _ANY_ ideas..????

    Thanks,

        Colin.

Subject: Problems with Pointers, Newtypes & Statements.

Hi everyone,

I hope someone can help me I'm all out of ideas.

I'm trying to make use of a list of Newtype structures that is freely
extensible (I can add to the list as much as I want).

The Newtype looks simiar to this :-

Newtype .MyType
  a.w
  b.w
  c.w
  txt.s
  prev.l
  next.l
End Newtype

What I am trying to achieve (in more detail if I can explain it) is to
set up each of the variable in the type using a dummy type then I assign
a pointer to the type and pass that as a parameter to a AddToList statement
because you can't pass NewTypes as parameters.
E.G


UsePath dummy.MyType
\a=1
\b=2
\c=3
\txt="Hello World"
\prev=0
\next=0
*ptr.MyType=dummy
AddToList{*ptr}

The AddToList statement goes something like this:-
(The initial pointers to the various list is stored in a shared array)

New Statement AddToList{*ptr.MyType}

  Shared listarray(),listnum

  Deftype .MyType list

  if listarray(listnum)=-1   ; Empty list
    listarray(listnum)=AllocMem_(Sizeof .MyType)
    *list=listarray(listnum)    ; point pointer to allocmem area for type
    *list\a=*ptr\a    ; Transfer the old vars
    *list\b=*ptr\b    ; to the list area
    *list\c=*ptr\c
    *list\txt=*ptr\txt
    *list\prev=-1
    *list\next=-1
  else
    ; do similare for a non empty list just change the prev & next
    ; list links

  endif
    ..
    ..
End Statement

When ran all compiles O.K. but fails when it executes. Using the Leading
Edge Software Debugger (which is great) I can see that the types get
set up correctly apart from the string fields which seem to be causing
all the problems. When trying to view 'dummy\txt' as a string I either
get 'Variable Not Found' or just a blank line instead of 'Hello World'.
However I can see the find the string in memory if I follow the string
pointer *ptr as a long, count the bytes through to the \txt pointer and go
from there. So the string gets assigned. When it goes into the AddToList
statement again all seems to work OK apart from the \txt which came up
with the error 'Unable to free memory' (????? bizarre). And then my
machine gradually dies off....

I'm stuck basically cos this is fundamental to my proggy in several places.
Does the Blitz Lists (that you have to define the number of) automatically
allocate a specific amount of memory when the array list is declared. If not
I might be able to use this method as the lists are of a very undefined
length and so pre-allocation of length would waste huge amounts of RAM
otherwise. That's why I chose this method.

Is there any special thing I should do when fiddling with Statements,
pointers and newtype structures (with strings).

HELP...Any suggestions would be tremendously appreciated..


Cheers in advance

Greg.

Hmmm. I know that Filerequest$ wont open if it can't allocate 
memory...How big is your .sha file? You might want to stick a 'Print 
AvailMem_(2<<16) somewhere to check on memory size, or have you already 
done this. The availmem before you load a .sha file should reduce by 
about the size of the .sha file after it's loaded...

Also, try setting the 'make smallest' option and re-compiling...This is 
done automatically for executables but not for compile/runs. The idea of 
increase 150% is that it only has to be done 'now and then', allowing 
Blitz to do a one pass compile most of the time during development. When 
your prog starts getting too big, it's best just to leave 'make smallest' on.

Good luck!

I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a way to convert
interleaved bitplane bitmaps to blitz bitmaps...

The problem...

I rip (using os calls) the Workbench screen. Now in 3.0 +
the screen's bitmap is Interleves bitplanes... I want to do that
cool aga dissolve effect which requires me to put the 16 colour
workbench bitmap into the upper 4 bitplanes (sequencially) and 
another pic (16 cols) into the lowere 4 bitplanes..hence 8 bitplane
bitmap... SO I cant work with the Interleaved Bitmap that the 
workbench screen is in...

Can anyone help with the conversion or suggest an alternate way
of ripping the workbench screen so that its a regular bitmap
(AGA and in variable screen modes...?)

Thanx in advance!

P.S. Who ever helps me gets a free registered version of my new awesome 
boot screen util like you never seen it EVER... If you want some info
on this util, ask me. I will send you a .guide file for it....
I need this last peace to finish it and release it!!! Thanks!

Since when is it Simon's list?  ;)

Tom wrote:

The way I understand interleaved bitmaps is, you have a line of bytes for plane
0, then a line of bytes for plane 1, a line of bytes for plane 2... etc... and
then, you move to the next line, starting at plane 1.  So, the organisation in
memory is something like this.

With ordinary sequential bitmaps:

	plane 0, line 0  (where line is, for example, 40 bytes for 320 pixels)
	plane 0, line 1
	plane 0, line 2
		.
		.
	plane 0, line 255 (assuming PAL screen)
	plane 1, line 0
	plane 1, line 1
		.
		.
	plane 1, line 255
	plane 2, line 0
		etc...

With interleaved bitmap:

	plane 0, line 0
	plane 1, line 0
	plane 2, line 0
		.
		.
	plane 7, line 0 (assuming 256 colours, 8 bitplanes)
	plane 0, line 1
	plane 1, line 1
	plane 2, line 1
		.
		.
	plane 7, line 1
	plane 0, line 2
		etc...

So, to convert from interleaved bitmap to sequential bitmap, all you need to do
is know the width of the screen in bytes.  You set aside an area of memory for
your sequential bitmaps, then work out the start of each of them.  Then just go
through the interleaved bitmap copying one line at a time to each of your
sequential bitmaps.

There is probably a way to do it with the blitter too.  You could set the
modulo of the source (interleaved bitmaps) to the screen width in bytes times
the number of planes in the interleaved bitmap (eg 40x8=320 for a 320 pixel,
256 colour screen), set the height to the height of the screen (eg 256 for
PAL), and width to the width of the screen.  Set the destination blitter modulo
to the screen width (40x1 because you only want the destination to advance one
line at a time).  Set the source to point at P0L0 in the interleaved bitmap,
then the destination to P0L0 in your destination bitmap.  Repeat this for each
plane.

So you've got something like this happening:  A, B, C are the bitplanes, 0 and
1 are the lines...  This is one a very small scale of course.

	A0		A0		|
        B0              A1              |
	C0     --->     B0              | Memory
	A1              B1              |
	B1              C0              |
	C1              C1              V

Sorry if my blittering is a bit rusty.  It's been too long since I did any
programming...  :)

Greg,

Re: Proper Dynamic lists in BB II


I had a (very) similar problem a while back where I was passing in a
NewType's pointer to a statement and trying to set/view a string
field. I had the same message: "unable to free memory".

What I found worked was to scrap passing pointers in as args and just
use SHARED instead, and hey presto it works...

Looks to me like theres something a bit dodgy with parameter passing
in BB II, but global variables won't move (in memory) and so work -
just a guess!  .. Simon?

Anyway... how to fix your bug.... try yhe above "general approach"  -
BUT hang on a minute.. how are you creating new instances of your
newtype structure at runtime???? ... okay found the AllocMem_ ;-)
Right then.. just try:

    Statement AddToList{}                       <<< no ptr arg

        SHARED listarray(),listnum,dummy        <<< shared dummy
      
        ....

            *list\a = dummy\a                   <<< change like this

    End Statement


Can't guarantee anything.. like to know if you do get it
working.. REAL lists would be nice!!

It might be worth checking that AllocMem_ is allocating memory - I
think it returns a special value if it can't so check for that too.

    Have fun ;-D

        Colin.

I had trouble adding menus to the default output from IntuiTools 2,

Yes the list is still alive (if not a little quiet) and the ftp site you 
want is x2ftp where there is a folder somewhere called blitz.  In here 
you'll find quite a few little blitz goodies......

Subject: Where Oh where has my debugger gone?

Hello fellow Blitzers
     I enstalled blitz2 on my hard drive, using the original disks supplied
with the manual, everything worked fine.

Now this is where things went wrong...

     Next I used the BUM7 disks, to remake the deflibs on the hard drive so
that I could use the cool AGA stuff.  Unfortunatly now I can not call the
debugger, with either Ctrl-Alt+C or by placing a 'Stop' in my code.

       I have read the readme file 'Newstuff' on BUM disk 7.2 but to no avail.

What I would like to know is What do I need to do to get the debugger back?
>From my limited knowledge, I presume that the debugger is nothing to do with
the deflibs file.

Any help would be gratefully recieved, I am severly limited as to what I can do
now without it.  Perhaps I will actually have to do some planning instead :)

You have got the folder blitz2:dbug haven't you?  If you haven't then you 
need to copy this folder and the contents off of your bum disks.

Okay, heres how to install ALL the blitz basic 2 libraries:
1) Delete ALL the old ones (apart from maybe any userlibs that aren't in the
   new distribution)
2) Copy ALL the new libraries into the relevant directories
   These directories are:
   i) BlitzLibs:system/
  ii) BlitzLibs:basic/
 iii) BlitzLibs:user/
      [or something like that]
3) Backup your old deflibs file :)
4) Run makedeflibs to create a new deflibs file

How to solve any problems:
1) Did you do the above procedure?
2) If you get a library error like the one stated - thats a missing system
   library or something, recomile deflibs with ALL libraries.
3) Libaries conflicting
   i) Run the listlib program as supplied with bum8? and compare the library
      numbers to those given in libnums.bb2 (another file floating around in
      each BUM.
  ii) If there are libraries with the same number - check the names - often
      libraries are renamed and old ones creep into the archives!
 iii) If all else fails - rename the user library directory and remake the
      deflibs file (eliminating 3rd party libaries), then add them one by one
  iv) If it still don't work - SCREAM!
4) Tokenisation problems - swap the deflibs files (using rename!) and load up
   the offending program with your old deflib file - then save it out in ascii
   go back to the new file and reload the program. (this works fine as long as
   the command names aren't changed (which sometimes they are))

Well, thats all I can think off of the top of my head...

Generally it is a full link list handler, including loading, saving,
searching as well as a few other useful items, including ordered lists
etc. Generally it can be used as (almost) a direct replacement for
List arrays, but without any limitations on number of entries (apart from
available memory).

These lists can also be used to hold data for a GTlistview gadget with a
bit of planning.

Hi Dag,

Subject: Re: Interleaved BitPlanes

As far as I am aware nearly most (nice language huh?) of blitz2's 
graphics commands work with interleaved bitmaps. If you want an 
initbitmap command that creates them the other way simply do:

bitmap 0,320,256,8 ;8 bitplane lores

;blitz allocates 320*256 bytes 
; unlike the os which will allocate 8 blocks of 320*256/8

;then weorganise the bitplane pointers

bp.l=addr bitmap(0)+8
a.l=peek.l(bp)
for i=0 to 7           ;could be 1 to 7 but keeps it tidy
  poke.l bp+i*4,a+i*40
next

then you need to poke two other values in the bitplane structure which is 
where I will probably stop temporarily (no sign of a reference manual 
beneath the mess)

the offsets would be the line modulo

poke.w bp,40*8  ;use to be 40 to get to next line now it is 40*8

and I think there is one other that is the size to get from one bitplane 
to the next, and a flag to state that the bitplane is interleaved.

Anyway if anyone replies to this I will finish this code off and you can 
let me know which graphics routines won't work with such a bitmap. 

The big problem with interleaved blitting is of course the cookie, if you 
want to blit 8 bitplane shapes in one blit your cookie has to be 8 
bitplanes also which means a large memory loss, this is the reason blitz
went the otherway to blitz1 which used an interleaved system.

  Huh?  I've been using interleaved bitmaps for quite a while, and all of 
Blitz's graphics commands have worked fine... are you saying that blitz 
has been allocating 8-bitplane cookies for my IL bitmaps?

  I used ScreenTags to allocate an IL-BitMap screen (and it did give me 
one, I could tell because multi-colored window text scrolled with no 
flicker, where it always flickers with a standard bitmap)... anyway, then 
I used ScreensBitmap to have blitz recognize the bitmap, and it worked 
great...

  I would reaaly love an AllocILBitMap command, so I can stop allocating 
a bunch of attached screens to get IL bitmaps...

  Oh yeah, on another note... I have Amiga-mode hardware scrolling code, 
if anyone wants it... also hi-res pointer, eliminating the 
pointer-dead-area between screens, attached screens, etc... oh yeah, and 
GadTools code that works under 2.x... any of these sound interesting?

  What I'd like to see is some kind of better way for blitz to deal with 
libraries it can't find, instead of just freezing... perhaps something 
--- a command called LibFail, which you give a label as its only 
argument... so if Blitz can't find a library, it jumps to this label, and 
executes the code underneath the label, until hitting End LibFail...

  Any possibility of this happening, so I don't have to open libraries 
myself?

Subject: Using pointers

Hello all....
     I am writing a two player game and have arranged the data for the players
in a newtype, called player funnily enough, and arranged the players in an
indexed array....

Dim players.player(1)

     In the game I will use various statements to do specific tasks on each
player, by calling the statements and passing the player I wish to work on.
eg..

Statement tedium_ad_finitum{player_number}

SHARED players()

....do stuff on   players(player_number)\data

End Statement


What I would like to know is if I use a pointer to point to the player being
worked on, at the top of each statement, will I save much time?
     Also is this the most efficient way to organise my data?

Thanks in advance

Laurie

No its just the blit routines will still be doing 8 separate blits for a 
shape instead of one big one which interleaved bitmaps give you the 
option of doing. With 020 systems I doubt the overhead is bad, the main 
gain is many many small blits being attempted per frame.

As of BUM7 libraries created with the new convertfd program would not

FALK: (he says in a loud voice) can you ask Andre about the programming
required to ensure an Amiga library used by a Blitz program is available?

Subject: System Borders & Gadgets....

I'm currently writing a little "patch" in Blitz which will eventually
replace the standard System Borders & Gadgets supplied by Intuition
Eg. With "X-Windows" style Gadgets & Window Borders, or whatever you choose
to design...

The idea is that this patch is run before any Screens or Windows have been
opened - so that any Screens or Windows that open after the patch make use
of the custom gadgets. Great so far.

The trouble is I can't find a "system friendly" way of obtaining a pointer to
the attributes of any of the system gadgets. If I open a Window, I can use the
GadgetList in the Window Structure to find pointers to the Gadget Images that
Intuition is using - but I still don't know where intuition finds the other 
info needed to define a gadget ie, size, position, type, activation 
flags etc...

After looking through an old (rev 1.3) copy of C='s Includes & Autodocs,
I found that there is a pointer to this Gadget info stored in the PRIVATE 
area of the IntuitionBase Structure, which it clearly states should never
be referenced by a program as the structure will be changed. As this
was for Kickstart 1.3 it would be fair to assume that this structure has
changed - and the later Includes & Autodocs no longer mention this PRIVATE
area.

So I'm stuck! - As I see it I have two choices:-

    1) 	Mess around with the private area in the IntuitionBase Structure
	until I find the correct pointers (if their still there!).

    2)	Dissassemble the OpenWindow command and try and find out how/
	where Intuition copies the info from when it opens a window.

Does anyone on the Blitz List have any suggestions???? Otherwise
option 2 it is (for now) - Any help would be gratefully received.

Subject: Acid, Shapes and ShapeZ


Dear All,
	I have been working on my ShapeZ program, a shape editor and
grabber, and now have far too many features! 

	One of the things that has always bugged me is the inability
of Blitz to store a palette with a shapes file. Well over the weekend
I worked out a neat way to do it! I have a couple of options


	1) Ask Acid for their ShapesLib source code and let the load
	and save shapes commands turn into

		LoadShapes Shape#,[Shape#,]filename$,palette#
		SaveShapes Shape#,Shape#,filename$[,palette#]

	2) Add these commands into the RIShapesLib

	3) Just bang out some blitz code statements to do the job.

I would prefer 1 as I think the shapes library should be able to do this.

The addition of palette to the shape file is transparent to the current
Blitz shape commands though.

Further Features To ShapeZ!

	1) Graphics card friendly, boy does it fly on my SD-64 8)
	2) Animation Support now in.
	3) Cut and paint with brushes.

Options to be added real soon now!

	4) Save as 24bit raw images for EGS Icons etc
	5) Save as Icons

I have speeded up all the zoom features in the editor window and given more
flexibility.


Not sure if Steve's put a version on their ftp site, but I shall ask them to 
put a new version there tomorrow (Tuesday)

Yes.. I noticed this annoying restriction on the length of the list of

Dear All,

Mailed recently re FileRequest$ function returning without showing the
requester and so returns "". I checked Simon's suggestion of AvailMem
being the problem - that is approx 80k when I call the FileRequest$
function....

It seems to me to do this on the second time I try to use it. So if I
load some shapes in first then it will not let be load in a .iff file
for the palette, but if I load in the palette it stops the .sha file
being chosen.

Now interestingly... I may be mistaken but just before I turned the
computer off on Friday it seemed to work on the 3rd go.. and
4th.. having worked on the 1st but not worked on the 2nd. All seperate
runs of the program are after recompile.

Any more ideas..?

I've found that usually Blitz programs that seem to be lacking a library 
when boot from a floppy need the diskfont.library, as a lot of blitz 
libraries like to open up a font (windowslib for example)

The easiest way to find the libraries an executeable is trying to open is 
by entering from the shell:

Search MyProg .library

Several lines will be printed to the shell window, usually containing a 
library name such as intuition.library, etc.  just pick the ones that are 
not resident in rom from the list and you have found the culprit.

Dear All,

Simon was right... "FileRequest$ won't open if there isn't enough
memory for it"... so I checked.. BUT there is 80k here.... so that
_can't_ be the problem... then I did my sums... a bitmap for a file
requester would take.... 80k !!! .. silly me!

So I'm stuck.... I'm using a 1Mb A500 - don't laugh please - and I've
run out of space to develop my program.. just a simple utility program
not the game!! I haven't yet tried using the "Make Smallest"
option... which might give me a bit of breathing space but are there
any other ways of freeing up some space...? Would I benefit from
putting part of the program as an INCLUDE file?

On the other hand.. has anyone out there got some memory for an A500?

    Thanks,

        Colin.

Hi there Colin
I too have a A500 1Mb, and have run into the problem you describe,
usually after compile. A good way of getting a bit of breathing space is
to close the Workbench Screen (left menu on Ted), and yes, use the Make
Smallest option. The way I`ve been devloping FigZ, the ray tracer, has
been pretty extreme.
Make Smallest, no debugger, compile to disk as an executable with the WB
closed, then run the executable. It's not great, but you can compile
pretty massive things this way.

Subject: NEED tech help on QBLITS - somebody



   Hi ,
	well I'm back from summer holiday ( as though you noticed :-))

	anyway I have spent a lot of time on a horizontal shootem up
	with parallax scrolling full screen snazzy!! intelligent gun turretts
	like in DHero and heaps of other stuff, mega weapons from Armalyte 
	on the c64 and inspiration from IO as well.

	PROBLEM:
		I want to use a combination of BBLITS and QBLITS in the 
	game. However to do the scrolling I use the technique where I 
	move the bitmap by 16 pixels and then adjust the bitmap pointers
	by 2 bytes and slowly move the bitmap into memory I have allocated
	beside it.
		The BBLITS work fine but the QBLITS do not work properly
	because:
		The case were I qblit and then adjust the bitplane pointers
	and then unqueue it erases the wrong section of the bitmap because
	the values of were to erase have being precalculated before the 
	bitplane pointers were adjusted.
	So basically I just have to go through the entire queue myself
	and recalculate the new erase position. 
		So I know how to get at the queue but what calculations do
	I have to remake  to allow for the bitplanes pointers having 2 added
	to them so the correct section will be erased?

			any help will be great  thanks in advance
