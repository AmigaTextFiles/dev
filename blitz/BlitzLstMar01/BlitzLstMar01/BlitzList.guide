						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

As  someone of you read on my old mail...  My program don't works
on  a friends A4000...  I drived to another guy with an A4000 and
tested it personaly to see what will be happen...

When  i  personaly  tested it on A4000 it works up to my Interupt
Part...   My  program  hang  up (speed:  2-4 frames) ;(((((( Pics
which  will normaly shown about 2 seconds was displayed about 3-5
minutes...  My prog slow down...  ;(( (32Bit Fast)

I phoned with my other friend, who told me that my prog dont work
on  his  A4000...   The  prog  will be loaded into memory and the
first check, if the needed libs are available (OpenLibrary_) dont
workds...   Argh, what that?  Why does this first lines dont work
and no requester or anything else will be displayed? (16Bit Fast)

My  friends FastMem on Board don't work, so he insert a old A2000
2MB  Fast  expension...  The only fact is, the 2 MB Fast are only
16  Bit...  Very crazy, isn't it?  Could this be the prob, why my
prog don't work (no sound, nothing...) on his computer...????

If  you  have  and idea of the prob or how to fix it, please tell
me!  I really can't understand it...

Many thanks to all...

Subject: @{b}Re: A4000 - 16Bit Prob?@{ub}

I have also experienced trouble when it comes to getting blitz basic 
programs to work on some a4000 configurations, i think it was an a4000 with 
a 060 card.  Also experienced trouble on getting programs to work on a1200's 
when kickstart 3.1 was mapped into ram:

I did not use any interrupts.  I'm not sure, but i think the problem mainly 
concerned programs running in amiga mode, not those switching to blitz mode. 
  I'm going to do some more checks on this soon, if i still don't get it to 
work you'll probably be hearing more from me.

Subject.....:   "A4000 - SetInt Prob?

I use in my programm "SetInt" and "End SetInt", as someone of you
may  know,  there  is  a litte Interupt Bug on A4000!  That's why
some demos and games don't work on A4000 but on any A1200 ;( !

I  think  the BlitzCommand "SetInt" have this bug inside and so i
think   to   you   the   OS-Commands   like   "SetIntVector"  and
"RemIntServer_" for my code...

My Old Code:

	SetInt 5
	   SomeBlitzComands...
	End SetInt

How to do it by using OS-Commands? 



In asm i know, how to fix this litte problem. But i don't really know
how to use it in Blitz...


.noVBI  move.w  #$20,$9c(a6)        ; for A4040/A4060
	move.w  #$20,$9c(a6)        ; compatibility
	movem.l (a7)+,d0-a6 
	nop
	nop
	rte
	nop
	nop


On  A4000  you  must  call  it two times...  and don't forget the
nops...  This will fix the small A4000 bug... ;)

If you have any idea, how to rewrite my old code working by using
the OS-Commands...  thanks...

Many thanks to all...

I  use  in  my program the "player61.library" to play P61 tunes in Blitz by
using commands like P61_Play_ and other...  It works all very good but when
i  exit  the  programm  the needed memory for the library will not be given
free  from  my  compiled  file!   There  are some CLI commands arround like
"VTFlush3"  to  flash  not needed libs in memory!  How can i close and free
this with my own code in my program?  CloseLibrary_ doenst work !? ;(

OK, this is a small CLI util that flushes a named library (note you can
alter it for devices and other things). Below that is a program that does
the same as Avail Flush, which should free unused libs, devices, fonts, etc,
but see the warning given.

---------

; Flush specific library. easily adapted for devices, tasks (!),
; ports, etc.

; No way to check it's worked or not unless you check through 'em
; all again...RemLibrary, etc don't return values.

a$=Peek.s(GetArgStr_())       ; from CLI
a$=Left$(a$,Peek.l(&a$-4)-1)  ; strip newline or whatever

; comment out above two lines and make a$="xxxxx.library" if you
; want to try it from here...

If a$

  *exec.ExecBase=Peek.l(4)
  *mylist.List=*exec\LibList  ; replace LibList with DeviceList, etc...

	Forbid_
	  *libnode.Node=FindName_ (*mylist,&a$)
	  If *libnode
		RemLibrary_ *libnode  ; replace RemLibrary with RemDevice, etc.
	  EndIf
	Permit_

EndIf

End

-------------


The Avail Flush equivalent:
--------------
	For a=1 To 10
	  AllocMem_ $7ffffff0,#MEMF_PUBLIC            ; flush ten times :
	Next a                                        ; this is how "avail
												  ; flush" does it...
---------------

The only problem with that last one is that if certain programs are running,
they'll crash (especially Internet MUI apps for some reason) -- but they do
the same with Avail Flush!

See ya,

Heh, 
and me still using my own bit of code for player 6.1 library use.

It might actually be smaller to use own code (you only need to include the
		functions you need, not any others).

The code seems to be on BUM10, dir usercode1, file p61_player.bb2

Does not much except play the file though.

My  litte  program works fine on AGA machine (only A1200) with at
least  some FastRam!  As you can see, it don't work in BLITZ mode
to get the feeling of real Multitask!

A  friend  told me, that my program will be loaded and crash then
on his A4000/030 with 2MB FastMem (16Bit)... Due why?

He  get  no  TitlePicture  or something else...  I use in my Code
SetInt5,  and  as  i know there is a small bug in the Interupt in
A4000...  Does it works, when i set the Interupt two times...!?

Or is there any other command who is buggy on A4000?  Please help
me, because i am going very demotivated ;( !!



I added some lines of my program, so you can see what i do



	BitMap 0,640,256,8
	BitMap 1,640,256,8
	;
	; some code...
	;
	Screen 0,0,0,640,256,8,$8000,"Works on CGfx?",0,0    ; Crash on A4000 ?
	;
	; some code...
	;
	Use BitMap 0
	;
	; some code
	;
	ShowBitMap 0        ; Show TitlePicture
	;
	; some code
	;
	Use BitMap 1
	;
	; some code
	;
	CopyBitMap 1,0      ; Could this crash on CGfx?
	;
	; some code
	;
Repeat
	ShowBitMap db:VWait
	;
	; some code     ; Main
	;
Until


I  really  don't understand why this program crash on A4000..  Do
you  have any idea?  Could it be, that "Screen" command dont work
on A4000?

Many thanks to all...

Thorsten



Update:

Ok, i drived to a friend with an A4000/040/OS3.0/16MB.... It works up to 
mainpart.... then my prog will hang on.... Could really be the SetInt Command,
i think... cant check it more at mom.... must drive back to home and compile
again without interupt.... then again back to the friend and check it 
again... if you have any ideas, please tell me.... ;)

Does  someone  have  any  docs and examples for the "CrmDecrunch"
Command? Maybe you can help me...



At the moment i use following in my program:

	adr.l=Addr BitMap(1)            ; Get Address of Bitmap(1)
	NPokeL ?bpladr,adr              ; Replace GetReg/PutReg

	LEA GfxData,a2                  ; Read Label of GfxData



I  use  three  labels...  Any Incbin of Label is unpacked exactly
163.840 bytes...

Now  i want to pack any of this three incbins with CrunchMania...
There  is  a  Command  to  decrunch the stuff...  But how does it
works?   Do  you  have an example for my code which will decrunch
the  data  of  label  to any buffer and after that...  I read the
next  label  and  put  this  decrunched  data  again  in  the old
buffer...!? Hope u understand what i mean...


Many thanks to all...

I've never used it specifically,but there are docs for it in the 'BB2 library
guide v1.3'.I've attached the page on CrMDecrunch.

Here's roughly how I would use it on a compressed bitmap:

---
 Size.l=Peek.l(?INCBINLABEL+6) ;size of unpacked file - see file header.

 add.l=Allocmem(Size.l,#CHIP|#CLEAR)

 CrMDecrunch ?INCBINLABEL,add.l

 Cludgebitmap 0,width,height,depth,add.l


INCBINLABEL:
 IncBin "crmfile.crm"
---

Is that any good?

Hi Dave,

  I've been away for 3 months due to problems with getting my E-mail
freezing up YAM (some stupid junk mail breaking the rules), and
meanwhile all of the Blitz-List messages were building up in my
mailbox at my server.  I believe I have them all.  In fact since I
save them, I think I have them all for the last 4 years!
I can get them to you, but how do I tell what the message numbers are
and how far back do you need?


cacha later,

I'm not sure if someone has already sent them (I had three offers, turned
two down, and it turns out the guy who sent me the mails, just sent me the
YAM files which were compressed :( ).

Anyway, if you are willing to send them, just forward all the mails which
you received/were sent from (or around) 1st Feb to 15th Feb (inclusive).

Thanks.

  Oh oh!  I am terribly sorry and embarassed, but I went to get together
the files you need and discovered to my chigrin that I have an even
bigger hole in my archives than you do.  I have been just reading the
messages and not paying attention to the dates on them but now I
discover that I recieved nothing (from anywhere) between Dec 28 and
Feb 19.  :(

  As I said before, I was unable to get my Email for 3 months.
I don't know what happened on my server in the mean time... the whole
thing was very wierd.

  Sorry...

This is too obvious, but just in case:

Can you undo whatever you did to make the PFS partitions "automount"?  That
is, set it back the way it was?
Then re-try it with the "old" system setup?   If it works, back everything
up and then go back to the "new" system and re-format and restore the
backed-up stuff...

Also, another thing to try would be to attempt mounting the partitions
manually (however you do this in PFS - I am unfamiliar with it)

You need to open your screen with some tags, so use ScreenTags if you are not 
using the NewCommandSet.

The tag you need to add is a pointer to another taglist for use by 
graphics.library/VideoControl(). You will need OS3+ and amigalibs.res for this 
to work. The code might look something like this:

Dim screentags.TagItem(10)
Dim vctags.TagItem(2)

vctags(0)\ti_Tag = #VTAG_SPRITERESN_SET,#SPRITERESN_70NS
; In case the #SPRITERESN_70NS constant doesn't work, it's
; value is 2. For other tags, see the OS includes graphics/view.h
vctags(1)\ti_Tag = #TAG_DONE

screentags(0)\ti_Tag = #SA_VideoControl,&vctags(0)
... ; Rest of tags for opening screen here
ScreenTags 0,"Screen title",&screentags(0)

I  coded  a small routine to print text with diferent Fonts (8x8 and 16x16)
in  any  color on Bitmap...  It works but it is really to slow and the code
doesnt  looks great, because of the "Goto Loop1" ;((( I dont have any ideas
how to fix the "Goto Loop1" (Pop If, is missing!) and how to speed it up...

The  text  will  be printed on a 640x256*8 Bitmap...  I use the "%" sign to
check what kind of font or color i must print out the next charset...


	Statement MyShowText{adr.l}     ; y and x are pos of TextPrint

I use following Stuff for FNSPrint....


	InstallFNS 0,?Font1     ; Init our 8*8 Font
	InstallFNS 1,?Font2     ; Init our x*16 Font (x is not ever the same)

	FNSPrefs 0,25           ; 25 = Color
	FNSOutput db,1          ; db = Print to DoubleBuffering Bitmap


Is  there  any  way  to  optimize my Statement and add some more of the FNS

If you cannot avoid it, then using Goto to escape from an If...EndIf is OK. In 
most cases, you should be able to re-write the code to use a different loop 
structure to remove the Goto.

As for optimisation, the problem lies with the fact that you are storing the 
string to print as a string, and working with strings. Consider the line:

a$=a$+NChr$(NPeekB(mem.l+adr.l))  

What this line must do is this:
Add two longwords together [mem.l+adr.l]
Read a byte from memory [NPeekB(mem.l+adr.l)]
Convert to a character [NChr$(NPeekB(mem.l+adr.l))]
Allocate memory for a new string, which is 1 byte longer
Copy memory from old string to new string [a$=a$]
Copy character onto end of string [a$=a$+NChr$(NPeekB(mem.l+adr.l))]
Free memory for old string

This is probably the single area which makes your statement slow. It would be 
much better if you were able to use a buffer of a fixed size. Also, using 
b$=NLeft$(a$, i-1) to remove a single character is a waste, when you could have 
easily done that in the loop.

Also, reading from memory lots (NPeekB) in one loop is useless if it is reading 
the same piece of memory each time.

Setting the types of variables to be words speeds things up as well. When you 
define y=0 then it uses the default type which is .q, and is quite slow (unless 
you have a DEFTYPE.w somwhere in your program).

Where do you reset the a$ variable? Or is there some reason that you do not do 
this? If you do not clear this string, you will print out what you have 
previously printed before, as well as the current line.

I've changed your statement so that it uses a buffer instead of a string. I 
hope this works, but you'll need to test it.


Statement MyShowText{adr.l} ; y and x are pos of TextPrint
  y=0:x=0:txtc=255          ; txtc is the color of Font

Download the BSS from http://www.blitz-2000.co.uk (in the Archives/Software 
page), you will get the full FNS package and docs from there. Alternatively, 
the FNS package was given away on one of the BUMs I think, and the docs will be 
in there. It was also given away with the free version of the RIBlitzLibs which 
is on Aminet.

ARG! Sorry, I completely forgot there was a command called str$.
Obviously, you want to replace all these strings in my code with a
variable of a different name. Also, there might be a few occaisions where
I put $str by mistake, sorry about that. It should have been str$, but
you'll have to change it anyway :)

I've been playing around and the original code I sent will not work. In fact it

Subject: @{b}Memorylocation reference question + Intuifont incbining@{ub}

when using reference to a memorylocation ?beginfile, ?endoffile
etc, i was wondering if it's possible to do this in a way using variables, 
so you can use a for-next sentence instead of writing this over and over for 
dozens of files.  ?

but after the ? character there seems to be a problem when the text isn't an 
actual memoryreference.

I'm incbin'ing text files, and then write them to ram: and then read them 
into arrays.

Also I want to incbin intuifonts and write these to ram: and then load them, 
but the loading command seems to only read in the fonts: dir.  Is there any 
way to get around this?

Do you want to include a huge number of files via a for-loop when you
program is running? If so it is not possible because the call to Incbin is
done by the compiler upon compile-time, not during run-time.

If you want to get hold of the adresses of the included files you could use
a macro, check the example attached.

You could do something like:

  cmd.s= "Assign Fonts: Ram: ADD"
  Execute_ cmd,0,0

and have your fontfile copied there, at the end of your program or when
the font has been read you could remove your added assign in a similar way
if you feel like it :)

You could probably do it with a macro. I've attached what I came up with, but I 
don't use macros much in Blitz, and I can't remember how to use the ~ operator 
in macros. So you'll find that the code attached will not work, but I'm sure 
it's the right idea if someone can fix it.

Macro GetLabel
	?label~1~

You can probably do this easier if you don't write to a file in RAM: first. If 
they are just plain text files which you have included, then you can just read 
straight from the memory location into the array.

However, if it is e.g. files of numbers which you want to read in as numbers 
rather than just a sequence of characters, then writing to a file then reading 
from a file probably is the best solution.

> Also I want to incbin intuifonts and write these to ram: and then load them, but

You should be able to specify the full path to the font file. However, if the 
font is already resident in memory, that will be used. Also, in the .font file 
the path to the actual font bitmaps is stored. If these are hardcoded to use 
fonts: then it will always load them (they mostly/should only have relative 
pathnames though).

This is in my StatsFuncs file on Aminet, if you want to avoid running stuff
via Execute_ () -- I always did! I haven't tested this since I wrote it, so
no guarantees ;)

-----------------

; Function : OSAssign { assign name, path, type }

; Author : James L Boyd - thesurfaces@...

; This function creates an assign and returns True if
; successful, false if not.

; The parameters are the assign name (eg. "MyAss:"), the
; path which this assign refers to (eg. "Work:Gfx/Pics"),
; and the type of assign - True (-1) for Path, or False (0)
; for a Late assign.

; Path assigns are activated immediately, Late assigns
; only activate when you try to use them (saves clogging
; up file/path requesters for a start :)

; I've called it OSAssign to avoid confusion with the BSS command
; Assign.

; Also, the function checks for the existence of the path
; you specify, since you CAN assign a name to a non-existent
; drawer! It returns False (0) if the path doesn't exist.

; Sore Point : Don't know how to remove it, except for :

;   Execute_ "run >NIL: assign <assign> REMOVE",0,0

Function.b OSAssign {name$,path$,PathOrLate.b}

If Exists(path$)

  Select PathOrLate

	Case 0 ; LATE assign...starts when accessed.

	  If AssignLate_(&name$,&path$)
		Function Return -1
	  Else Function Return 0
	  EndIf

	Case -1 ; PATH assign...starts immediately.

	  If AssignPath_(&name$,&path$)
		Function Return -1
	  Else Function Return 0
	  EndIf

  Default
	  Function Return 0
  End Select

Else Function Return 0
EndIf

End Function

; demo :

;; NOTE : To remove the assign after testing, go to the CLI and
;; type "assign MyAss: REMOVE" (without the quotes!).

; If OSAssign {"MyAss","SYS:C/",-1} ; -1=path assign...
;   Request "","Success! MyAss: is assigned to the SYS:C/ drawer!","OK"

@NODE "mail_31" " Mildred Trouble "
From: George Davis <geo@...>
Date: 03-12-01 21:32:28
Subject: @{b}Mildred Trouble@{ub}

Hello,

Is there any reason why the Mc2p command should mess up when used in Blitz mode?
Specifically on a display with 2 coplists.

The coplists are identical,apart from vertical size,but for some reason the
larger one screws up (the bitplanes seems to be aligned wrongly on the c2p
output).It works OK if I do the create display with only the larger coplist.

It's my first try at using mildred,so if anyone can point out things that can
interfere with it,it would be a big help.

Bye.

Yep,I know.I need a 10 pixel gap normally (with fetchmode 3 and some rainbows)
but even with 20 pixels the c2p still messes up.

I'm afraid so - the bitmaps are the same size.The code is a bit like this -

Mc2pWindow 0,320,143
Mc2p 0,(Mbitmapptr(0,0,2)),addressofbitmap1.l

although 
 Musebitmap 2
 Mc2p addressofbitmap1.l

give the same result.

Shape files normally have no palette information, so you'll need to have a 
palette saved from your paint program, which you can load in with "LoadPalette 
palette_number, palette_filename$".

If you are loading a Brush or AnimBrush, then you can grab the palette from 
those files with the command you load the brush with (I can't remember what it 
is now), or you can simply call LoadPalette on these files too.

After you have created your coplist and things (are you still using a coplist?) 
you can use the "DisplayPalette coplist_number, palette_number" to display the 
correct palette.

Well, thats actually the problem: I've loaded the palette from the 
brush. I've even tried to create a palette file and load this palette 
and I've created a pic with the same palette, and load the pic first. 
But nothing works...

Are you sure? Check out the attached (change the path to the brush file), it works here.

I didn't even know there was a German version. You could try using the
BSS, with it's new editor and help files and things. You can get it from
http://www.blitz-2000.co.uk in the Archives/Software section.

If you decide to try it, I recommend backing up your Blitz installation,
or installing it to another directory first. Just in case the German
version of Blitz is strange.

Has anyone got a source that can alter a pictures palette and then remap the

I have many pictures i want to remap the colours on, 128 colour iff brushes

It's a heavy process to do this manually in dpaint.  Thanks in advance!

I've written a similiar procedure in assembler: effect you want is similiar
to my last proggy. Leaving lower 64 colours are eqal to set all bits in the
highest bitplane number to 1. I've piece of my own machine code to do it.
I've used it in my eTeacher lately ;-)
Unfortunatelly actual code works only with one size pictures - don't support
any parameters but i don't think taht it is a problem.
To get 64 only colours pictures you have to use ImageFX AutoFX option to get
all pictures with the same palette - just lock unused colours and remap all
of them.

*** Written by Andy Finkel on Tuesday 27-Feb-01 at 23:24:37 ***
 *** Originally from... (maybe? :-) ***

Hi:

I'm looking for programmers interested in porting old Amiga games to our
system running CaOS. (Amiga games should port fairly easily, as long as they
were not too hardware dependent, and didn't play deep games with the OS,
since we use similar concepts, but are not compatible (nor did we make any
attempt to be)) At the moment, I'm putting together a list of programmers,
so I know who is available, with what skills.

On a related issue:

I've been contacting some of the bigger game companies that did Amiga work;
in some cases, they are interested, but have lost track of their source code
years ago. (programmers left company, company gave them copies of source for
variety of reasons, etc).  If anyone has old Amiga game source (to good
games, naturally  :-) )  I'd be interested;  I could contact those companies
in particular.  And, if anyone has source and the rights to the source, I'd
love to talk to you especially.
(due to the nature of the Amiga game industry I suspect there are a bunch of
former Amiga game programmers with the rights to their own work, strange as
that may sound to people in the PC world :-) )

Thanks,

Andy Finkel

Attached is an example for the NCS of using a screen mode requester and then 
opening a screen and doing some drawing to it. It is not a fast way of doing 
double buffering on a GFX card though.

In the above you do not need to use ScreensBitMap - you have already created 2 
bitmaps for drawing onto, which then get copied to the screen bitmap. So you do 
not want to grab the screen's bitmap as bitmap 0.

If you need to copy the data from the screen bitmap onto a bitmap used for 
drawing using the NCS, you can do something like:

*scr.Screen = NScreenID
*rp.RastPort = NBitMapRastPort
BltBitMapRastPort_ *scr\RastPort\BitMap,0,0,*rp,0,0,*scr\Width,*scr\Height,$C0

(assuming the bitmap and screen are the same size)

I know this is not the same as what ScreensBitMap does - that command fills in 
a BitMap object with the information about the bitmap of the screen. As I have 
said, you did not need to do this with this program. However, if you really 
want to do this with the NCS, what you need to do is create the bitmaps BEFORE 
you open the screen, and pass the extra Tag (to the NScreen command) 
#SA_BitMap,NBitMapID.

And if it`s any help, I`ll be willing to test any updates to destruction.

Also, on the subject of the tcp&bsd lib, the bsd docs mention the hton and 
ntoh commands for getting the correct byte order. I take it that the amiga`s 
byte order is correct for networks, as I can`t get these commands recognised 
in Blitz

Yep, the Amiga's byte order is correct. If you were writing in a portable 
language, like C, you'd probably want to call the functions anyway no matter 
what platform you were compiling for.

But like you say, those commands aren't available in Blitz :)

If you press RAmiga-Help over InitCopList you get an extended description of 
the command. Most Acid commands will have some information, and most commands 
which have some flags (in this case the type parameter) will include a 
description of the flags.

If you have the BSS, you can also get help on more commands using Shift-Help 
(this is the default shortcut).

@NODE "mail_61" " Variable problem. "
From: Gareth Griffiths <mail@...>
Date: 03-11-01 16:19:31
Subject: @{b}Variable problem.@{ub}

Hi all,

I've got a bit of a problem with my code. Its really strange though, and
I'm positive it shouldn't be happening!

A snippet of the code follows:

tmp$=""
If req=0
  tmp$=ASLPathRequest$("Select input directory...",p$)
  If tmp$<>""
	If NOT Exists(tmp$)
	  MUIRequest #MAINWIN,0,"Error","OK",tmp$+": Does not exist."
	Else
	  If Right$(tmp$,1)=":" OR Right$(tmp$,1)="/"
		dir$=tmp$
	  Else
		tmp$=tmp$+"/"
		dir$=tmp$
	  EndIf
	EndIf
  EndIf
EndIf

The tmp$+ bit in the MUIRequest command is just for debugging purposes, to
find out whats going on. Basically, the first time the program is run, I
select a directory and tmp$ equals (for example) "MP3:A" which when the
code is executed is put into dir$ and changed to "MP3:A/"

The second time I do it, and select "MP3:" as the directory in the
requester, tmp$ equals "MP3:MP3:A/" (so its adding the old contents of tmp$
on to it, and therefore the MUIRequest code is executed.

Surely this shouldn't be happening if there is a tmp$="" line at the very
top?

I'm probably overlooking something really obvious, but I can't find
anything wrong. Please help!

Did you not get my reply to this when you sent something like this a while ago?

This kind of screen should have nothing to do with CGFX, since it's AGA only. 
Make sure whoever is using your program has the PAL or NTSC monitor drivers in 
devs:monitors/ or use ScreenTags or the NCS and an ASL requester to get the 
DisplayID.

Or does CGFX have automatic mode promotion?

This might be the problem, try using:

*scr.Screen = peek.l(addr screen(0))
BltBitMapRastPort_ Addr BitMap(0),0,0,*scr\RastPort,0,0,w,h,$C0
; where w is width of bitmap and h is height of bitmap

>     CopyBitMap 1,0      ; Could this crash on CGfx?

No, again, this should have nothing to do with CGFX so it should not crash. It 
will all work internally on Blitz bitmaps.

VWait bangs the hardware in Blitz mode, and I think it uses WaitTOF_ in Amiga 
mode. NVWait always uses WaitTOF_.

I sent this using the NCS last time you asked a question like this. And there 
is an example of ASL requesters and hooks (although I doubt whether you'd need 
to use a hook) in Aminet dev/basic called hookfunc.lha (or maybe hook.lha). 
Curt Esser has another example of ASL screenmode selecters
