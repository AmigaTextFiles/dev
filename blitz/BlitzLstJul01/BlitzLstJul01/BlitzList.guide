                          Blitz Mailing List Guide
                          ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

@NODE "mail_1" " .h files "
From: Richard Brooklyn <richbrooklyn@...>
Date: 07-14-01 20:46:31
Subject: @{b}.h files@{ub}

Hello,

I'll get straight to the point (I know you want me to!). Say that I have
some files. Anything will do, let's call it iamstupid.library. To use that
library, I will need the iamstupid.fd iamstupid.library and finally the
iamstupid.h file.

I have worked out how to use the other two okay. But it's the iamstupid.h
file that has stumped me. From what I cam tell, it contains a load of
constants:

#define ONE 23
#define TWO 34

This is call well and good, as I can simply write into my program:

#ONE=23
#TWO=34

But it's when the lines read:

#define THREE 0x0A
#define FOUR 0x0F 

That I get confused! If I copy these in my source code, then Blitz doesn't
want to know.

Any idea?

Many Thanks.
-Richard

Hi,

'0x' is C lingo for '$'

so those lines read:

In Blitz:

#THREE=$0A
#FOUR=$0F

Cheers Henry. That worked fine!

This is gonna confuse ya though. What about this?:

#define FIVE 16
#define SIX 16
#define SEVEN 17

#define FIVE (1<<16)
#define SIXA (1<<17)  <-- not a typo
#define SEVEN (1<<17)

Now, THAT is confuseing! Is the above do-able in Blitz??

Hi Richard

You're sure it's done like that? That's pretty lame, redefining the 
define like that. Normally, you'd get something like this:

#define FIVEB	16
#define FIVEF	(1 << FIVEB)

(B meaning Bit, F meaning Full). Anyway, minor rant over :)

#FIVEB = 16
#FIVEF = (1 LSL #FIVEB) ; LSL is logical shift left

Oh, and if you did it like the guy and redefined #FIVE, Blitz would use 
whatever the current definition of #FIVE was when it's compiling. i.e.

#FIVE = 16
; #FIVE is 16 here
#FIVE = (1 LSL 16)
; #FIVE is 1 LSL 16 here

I Totaly agree with David, Blitz takes the current definition, so it's handy

hmm. It thought it was a bit silly as well (defineing the same thing twice).
But I wasn't sure!

Hi all,

  Does anyone have any info on the 3.5 Workbench's ARexx interface?  I'm
hoping there's a command for leaving out an icon on the backdrop.

I'm sure there's a doc somewhere on the DevCD2.1 which describes all the 
WB3.5 ARexx commands (I've seen one, but I can't remember where)...or 
maybe it was the OS3.5 CD. Does it need to be ARexx? IIRC, a lot of the 
icon menu commands were put into the workbench.library, so "Leave out" 
might also be there.

No, if there are commands in the workbench.library then that would be even
better -- but again I would need to know the commands and I guess I'd need
a newer .fd file for the workbench library.  Does anyone have the 2.1 dev
CD?

I do, but I'd need to find it to check for the ARexx stuff (since I never 
use ARexx). But I checked the autodocs and I was wrong about the "leave 
out" thing - what you can do is make an appicon respond to e.g. "Leave 
out", but you cannot call the functions themselves.

Sorry about the hassle.

I think you can make it backdrop simply adding line to ":.backdrop",
where you put the path + name of your program. (should work on 3.1 but
don't know if 3.5 uses the same method) I don't remember if the WB
checks modifications to this file on the fly, so it may not work until
reboot or leave out of another icon.

The ".backdrop" file where you need to add the line, have to be in the
same partition where your program is.

So this for example should work. I can't remember was it with .icon or
without, but I think you can test it by yourself :)
echo "path_to_proggy/my_program_in_floppy_0" >df0:.backdrop
and when this disk is inserted the program icon will appear in WB
screen.

Yes, it is without the .info, but if you are going to use echo to test 
it, better to use >> so you don't overwrite any backdrop file you already 
have :)

You might be able to use Workbench menu->Update all or Redraw all to get 
it to appear, rather than reboot.

Well my example uses floppy and I couldn't remember how Amy handled the

@NODE "mail_15" " AHI library again "
From: Thilo Köhler <koehlerthilo@...>
Date: 07-04-01 02:00:13
Subject: @{b}AHI library again@{ub}

Hi all !

I am hanging with my AHI library again. Unfortunately 
the sourcecode that might contain a bug is too big to 
post here.
The problem:
I try to use AHI via the library functions.
Everything runns well like opening the
ahi.device, choose a AHI mode and allocate
the audiohardware. But if I try to play a
sound everything stays quiet. I know that
is not very precise, but that`s all I can say.
I`ve tried lots of things like setting volume, frequency
but there is still no noise. There is also no
Guru or Debugger error - only silence like
I would not have called the "SetSound" function.
I can install a "PlayerFunc" and it works well,
its only the "SetSound" function that does
nothing. A SoundFunc is installed but it is
NOT called.

The examples in C don`t help, as I can not
find differences that could cause this behaviour.

If someone has any experience in AHI with
the library functions please help !

Ciao,

Thilo

Is there an example for this in the AHI developer archive? If there is an 
executable version, have you tried that to see if the AHI functions are 
working properly?

That` right, I will have to check this.
But I remember some Applications that
use the library functions of AHI and they
work wit my configuration, so there
must be a bug in my sourcecode
or I have forgotten to initialisize something ...

Have you tried using Paul Burkey's AHI suite?  I did the low level part,
like the blit AHI device library (which opens the device and lets you call
the functions from the device) as well as the AHI library.

I was looking for this the last time Thilo asked about AHI, but I 
couldn't find it. AFAIK Paul's site was the only which had it and it 
doesn't appear to be there any more.

I don't suppose you've still got a copy?

I've put up an archive on my site, it might not be the most recent one but
the low-level stuff didn't change much IIRC.  I assume it still works ;)

From: Demon Hell <demonhell_@...>

Subject: @{b}Another prob with Arexx@{ub}

Grrrr, it`s one of those days..
I was doing some final testing on my MHI player, before I release it to
the great unclean masses..
Programs stable etc etc, so i decided to check it for memory leaks..and was 
I in for a suprise..!
Every time I run it, I`m left with a 360Kb deficit in available 
ram!!(according to Memleak).
I tracked it down to one function which sends a message to Arexx to add an 
item to the cliplist (called about 30 times in all). If I comment out the 
sendmessage command, it doesnt loose any memory..but thats hardly a fix :(
According to the Blitz manual, the isrexxevent(port) command should 
automatically free up /delete the returning result as long as the message 
address is the same as the sentmessage address
But, as always, adding some debug code to my prog shows that the address of 
the result message isnt the same..it also shows that the "reply" from Arexx 
is a command message,not a reply, with a command of "1".
I dunno what to do, if I reply to this message it bombs cos it isnt 
expecting a reply, So does anyone have any ideas howto stop this leak?#

Maybe it is the same as with ASLFileRequest$ where you have to set the 
maximum length of the string first?

e.g

MaxLen path.s=192
> path.s = *ASLPathRequest$*("Select dir",path.s,x,y,width,height)

I thought you only have to set the argument strings with maxlen,
but not the result string as blitz copies it for you. In the
real programm the result string and the default path string is
not the same like in this example.
It looks more like this:
resultpath.s = *ASLPathRequest$*("Select
dir",defaultpath.s,x,y,width,height)

Get yourself a copy of 'NeilsReqTools.library' then use:

path.s = RTEZPathRequest(title$)

it does not suffer from the 'features' that ASL does, and I
should think 99.9% of users have ReqTools in their libs:

Can anyone help me making some audio functions ? I
need these audio functions but i have too problems
(too gurus) making it:

1) An audio routine that play a big audio sample from
fast ram (like "diskplay" but from ram and with no
resource lock as the original "diskplay" of blitz!).
2) An audio routine that can control the volume of the
longsample playing (for crossfading the sample playing
by the routine at point 1.
3) An audio routine that stop playing the routine 1 in
any moment.

For making this routine i try using the Autovector Lv4
IRQ that control the correct audio playing exchanging
the 2 temporary 128K chip buffer with the rest of the
sample located in fast ram, but i code this routine in
devpac and function very good, but when i try to make
it in blitz asm i have found a lot of problems, so i
need the help of anyone, if anyone can make me these
simple routine in blitz asm mode like our knowledge, i
can make a good audio library :)
I send to you some of the original devpac asm code :)

Are you sure Blitz is able to open the library correctly - try checking 
with SnoopDos when your program runs.

Also, is that the correct library for that FD file? Shouldn't you have a 
cybergraphics.library1 file which is created by NewFDConvert?

Isn't it DPMS? Anyway, I think (not sure), but there might be something

There`s a couple of things I can think of..
1. It must be a SCSI command,so I assume it`ll be documented
  somewhere(I`ll check my RKM hardware stuff tonight)

2. How would you know the drive(s) aren`t being written to when you    issue 
the powerdown command?

3. Don`t assume that the HD is on scsi.device..you`ll have to check to
   see what volumes are mounted and then from that find out what device
they use.

4. This will come in bloody handy for my latest ongoing project. It`s a 
simple PIC circuit that connects to joyport2 and the MMKB thing from aminet, 
which controls an ATX PSU that powers the 1200, so it can do software power 
off and also on/off from a PC keyboard!

Subject: @{b}Drawing a sample@{ub}

I am using this subroutine to draw a sample into a window(with 620
innerwidth). *w0 is a pointer to window 0. I calculate stapint so I can show
the whole sample into the window, thus it will only show every stapint byte. I
have tried everything I can think of, but I can`t get this routine to draw the
"whole"(it`s not really whole as it steps throught the data, but you get the
point) sample. As in from beginning to end. It somehow stops 3/4 from the end.
I just can`t understand why this hapens. 

Anyone give me a clue? Thanks =)

Hello amorel

I guess it is an overflow problem if your sound is
long or the a problem that you only use integer accuracy if
you have a short sample.
Try to define stapibt..l to Longword.
If the sample is very short you have to be more accurate.
(use foating point for teller and stapint)

Hi amorel

How big is your sample (the raw data of it I mean)? If it's more than 32k 
then chances are the Blitz sound object will not store it correctly (or 
at least, using the length with Blitz maths will be incorrect).

Try this:

  xsam.w=*w20\BorderLeft+1:ysam.w=(256/2)+*w20\BorderTop
  mylen.l=*mysound\_length & $FFFF
  stapint.l=mylen/620
  teller.l=0
  Repeat
    If teller<=mylen
      NLine xsam,ysam,xsam,ysam+(soundarr(teller))
      xsam=xsam+1
    EndIf
    teller=teller+stapint
  Until (xsam>*w20\BorderLeft+620) OR (teller>mylen)

If you print out the values of xsam and teller after the loop has finished 
what are their values (and what are they like in comparison to 620 and the 
length of the sample)?

I was also just wondering....are samples ever stored as words on the Amiga? 
You know, something like 1 byte for left channel and then 1 byte for right 
channel? Hmm, maybe not, I don't remember too many samples that use >1 
channel.

Either 620(for xsam) and/or not far less(for teller). As the sample gets drawn
to the right inner edge of the window.

The length is given in words in the sound structure, but that`s just to be
able to put larger numbers in there I`d say. And the bytes I read in appear to
be within 0-255.

I`m still at a loss. I might just reside to using numbers instead, but how can
I be sure the whole sample is there if I can`t get it drawn fully.

So they do actually reach their values, you're not just saying what's 
supposed to happen? ;)

If the length is given in words then you might need to try multiplying 
the length by 2 (to get the actual size in bytes) to get the correct size 
for the array, the correct number of samples to draw etc.

It's usually because you are trying to access a position in the array 
bigger than you dimmed it, or negative. Did you multiply the length of the 
sample by 2 everywhere?

And what line is it that gives you that problem? Have you tried printing 
the value of the position you are trying to access the array with?

I know you got it sorted, but here's a tip for anyone using NewFDConvert. 
If the library is not on disk, just leave the drawer blank and put the 
library name in the filename gadget (so you are only entering for example 
cybergraphics.library). It should read the library out of ROM/RAM/wherever.

Also, if you want to cancel the fdconvert, leave both strings blank (IIRC).

I cannot find anything in the autodocs for removing a border from a
GTButton. And since gadtools.library creates the images for the gadgets, I
don't think there would be a (non-hacky) way to remove the borders after it was
created.

> I need it to do pages like in MUI, maybe there
> is another way to do this.

Perhaps the simplest thing would be to create a shape of the correct size
and render the correct font into it and use a GTShape.

Something like:

; Assuming you already have font loaded as #0 for gadgets
*scr.Screen = Peek.l(Addr Screen(Used Screen))
*di.DrawInfo = GetScreenDrawInfo(*scr)

DEFTYPE.RastPort rp
InitRastPort_ &rp
SetFont_ &rp,Peek.l(Addr IntuitFont(0)+8) ; Get TextFont structure
SetAPen_ &rp,Peek.w(*di\dri_Pens + #TEXTPEN * Sizeof.w)
SetDrMd_ &rp,#JAM1

; Example text and sizes of gadget
gad_text$="A Button"
gad_width.w=100
gad_height.w=14

; This is not what gadtools.library does - it simply overwrites the edges
; of the gadget (I think) or at least it increases the size of the gadget
; to hold the imagery correctly.
numchars.w = TextFit_(&rp, &gad_text$, Len(gad_text$), &te.TextExtent, 0,
1, gad_width, gad_height)

InitShape 0,gad_width,gad_height,*scr\Depth
ShapesBitMap 0,0
rp\BitMap = Addr BitMap 0

Move_ &rp,0,0    ; Not sure if this is correct - it may need
                 ; to be &rp,0,font height
Text_ &rp,&gad_text$,numchars

@NODE "mail_56" " GetVar_ "
From: Richard Brooklyn <richbrooklyn@...>
Date: 07-03-01 10:15:33
Subject: @{b}GetVar_@{ub}

Hello,

I have been trying to use the "GetVar_" command in Blitz. With little
success. How do I use it?

I have tried the following:

print GetVar_("IAmStupid",65536,5,0)

But all I get is a number like 4 or 5. Or -1 if I make up the varible (like
above). So I can tell if the varible exists, but nothing else. I need to get
hold of the value. Can you help me??

Thanks in advance.

Regards

Something like this might work:

#BUFSIZE=256
Dim buff.b(#BUFSIZE) ; some buffer memory for the variable to be stored in
varname$="IAMSTUPID" ; better to have a variable for the name
reslen.l=GetVar_(&varname$, &buff(0), #BUFSIZE, 0)
If reslen=-1
  If IoErr_=#ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND
    NPrint "Variable not set"
  EndIf
Else
  NPrint varname$," = ",Peek$(&buff(0))
EndIf

From: Pekka Nissinen <pekka.nissinen@...>

Subject: @{b}GFX cards...@{ub}

Hi!

I've done some little proggys (MUI gui's and stuff) with Blitz over the years. A year ago I bought myself
a GFX card (BVision) and now I would like to make some of my proggys work with BVision too.
I don't have scandoubler and my TV which I used to display native PAL/NTSC screens is broken. :(

I know I'm a beginner and don't have much experience in programming (bla..bla..bla...) but still it would 
be nice to learn some new stuff... Ok! Here goes...

Example 1:
--------------------
WBStartup

 Screen 0,5
 ScreensBitMap 0,0

   LoadBitMap 0,"Data/titlepic",0 ;background pic
   LoadShape 0,"Data/SelectPoint" ;Example shape

 Use Palette 0

Blit 0,120,162 ;and some blitting...
--------------------

Is it possible to do this in a way that it uses the GFX card/CGFX screen? 
I know that I can open CGFX screen using ScreenTags like this....

Example 2:
--------------------
WBStartup

  Dim SCRtags.TagItem(4)
  SCRtags(0)\ti_Tag=#SA_DisplayID,1086455811 ;this is the ID for BVision 320x256 8bit
  SCRtags(1)\ti_Tag=#SA_Depth,8
  SCRtags(2)\ti_Tag=#SA_Width,320
  SCRtags(3)\ti_Tag=#SA_Height,256

  ScreenTags 0,"",& SCRtags(0)    ;open the test screen

  ShowScreen 0
--------------------

 ....but if I add the following lines (from the 1st example) to the code above...

 ScreensBitMap 0,0
   LoadBitMap 0,"Data/titlepic",0 
   LoadShape 0,"Data/SelectPoint" 
 Use Palette 0
Blit 0,120,162 

...nothing happens, or dosent have any effect?

Since nothing seemed to work I though that I need a new strategy. After reading the 
examples from the NewCommandSet package I managed to open CGFX screen and 
load/display the background picture succesfully (Hurrah! :)) using the NewCommandSet 
replacement commands. But then I found out that (I might be wrong about this though...) 
I can't blit anything to the opened screen (like in the 1st example) 'cos I didn't find any 
replacement blitting commands from the NewCommandSet quide. I can draw lines, circles 
etc. using the NewCommandSet commands but I can't blit shapes to that screen, or can I?

Is there a way doing those things in a system friendly way that it works with both native 
and CGFX/P96 screenmodes?

I hope that someone can help me! :)

Yours,
Pekka Nissinen

Hello Pekka

You can use the WBlit command. It works on Cybergraphix/Picasso96
and native Screens. It clips the shape system friendly
and converts it automatically from planar to chunky if neccesary.
With the Jam command you can set if it should have color 0 
transparent or not.

But you will get into trouble when you mix this with the 
newcommandset, as it has its own Objects. You have to
"fake" a Blitz window with pokeing into the 
Blitz-Window Structure (which is only a longword with 
the pointer to the intuition Window-Structure)
like this:

poke.l addr window(n),NWindowID

(But don`t forget to set this to zero again before you exit)

Disadvantages:
This solution is not very fast and its not easy to
restore the background of the shape if it should move.

But otherwise you have to go deep into the graphics.library.

Ok. I tried it like this: (correct me if I've done something the wrong way)

------------
WBStartup
NoCli
 
 Dim SCRtags.TagItem(4)
 SCRtags(0)\ti_Tag=#SA_DisplayID,1086455811 ;this is the ID for BVision 320x256
 SCRtags(1)\ti_Tag=#SA_Depth,8 
 SCRtags(2)\ti_Tag=#SA_Width,320
 SCRtags(3)\ti_Tag=#SA_Height,256

LoadShape 0,"data/testshape.iff" ;Load a test shape
 
 ScreenTags 0,"",& SCRtags(0)    ;open the 320x256x8Bit screen
 ShowScreen 0 

WBlit 0,160,128 ;Blit the shape
--------------

Doh! It still does nothing. :( It opens the screen ok but I can't see no shape on the screen.
Have I done something wrong? 
BTW, I thought that WBlit command was used to blit shapes to the windows and not to 
the screens? 

And then there is another problem:
When I open a screen using ScreenTags command (just like above), how do I load a 
bitmap and display it on the opened screen? 
Using the native display modes I've done it like this:

-----------
Screen 0,8
ScreensBitMap 0,0
 
 LoadBitMap 0,"data/titlepic",0 
 Use Palette 0
------------

But that doesn't work with CGFX though, not even with a ModePromoter! 
And if I open the screen using ScreenTags (like in the 1st exaple) instead of that 
"Screen 0,8" line, all what seems to happen is a lot of garbage appearing to the screen. :( 
 
I can pretty much the same using the NewCommandSet commands and that works with CGFX
screen too, but 'cos they seem to cause problems with the rest of the code, I would like to use 
something else instead, if possible?

So, what I would like to do is: 

1. Open a screen that works with both native and CGFX/Picasso96. (that is VERY important)
2. Load a bitmap (for example as a background picture etc.) and display it to the opened screen.
3. Load a shape and and bilt it to the same screen and perhaps move it a little. :)

I can do all those things (exept CGFX/P96 part) using the native screenmodes, but what I would 
like to know is that is it possible to do all those things like I would want to?
If anyone can help me then PLEASE do so. Show me an example code or something to get me started.

Yours, 
Pekka Nissinen

Oh sorry, I forgot that you didn`t open a window. For WBlit, as the "W"
says,
you have to open a window.
 
[...]

OK, I see your problem.
On Amiga native screens the bitmaps are
organized in "planar" bytes, on most graphiccards
they are organized in "cunky" bytes.
So you can not blit or manipulate bitmaps directly
as you don`t know its structure. (That`s why there was
only trash when you used the old hacky blitzcommands
that rely on a "planar" bitmap)
And that`s because Cybergrapics and Picass96 exist. 
They provide an interface between your application and the
graphiccards. If you want to manipulate a bitmap
you have to use their functions. Most of the
functions are found in the graphics.library,
some additional functions in the cgxsystem.library.
Check out their functions. But be warned,
it is not so easy especially if you have not
much experience with intuition and graohic.library.

btw. opening a backdropwindow with the full screensize
(except the title bar, otherwise you can not cycle the screen
anymore !) can solve many problems, because most
of the blitzcommands are for use with windows.

I use RTLockWindow and it's never crashed. What is it you ae doing, 
something like this:

RTLockWindow ...
ASLFileRequest$...

There might be a problem with that, since RTLockWindow would open up an 
invisible requester on your window. And since the ASL is also a 
requester, perhaps you cannot open 2 at the same time??

But that's just a guess :)

Not sure. I can't remember ever seeing that problem, but I don't think I 
put up the two requesters before.

It might be something they broke in asl.library for OS3.1 and then fixed 
again in OS3.5? I dunno, it sounds strange. I just tried this program on 
OS3.1 and it seemed to work OK - it sounds similar code to what you have.

WBStartup

Yeah, I got the LockWindow{} and UnlockWindow{} functions from 
StatsFuncs. I stuck those two functions in a program with your one and 
then this bit at the bottom:

WBToScreen 0
Window 0,0,0,400,300,$100f,"ddd",-1,-1
NPrint aslfilerequest{"blah","","","",0,0}
While WaitEvent<>$200
Wend
End

And it didn't crash (that was under OS3.1). Are you able to run your 
program with the debugger? I can't really see anything wrong in the code.

I can only guess that it might be something like a window has been closed 
meaning you have no currently used window (although I'm not sure if this 
can actually happen?). That would probably kick up an error because of 
the "Used Window" call, or if it returns -1 (or something else weird) the 
LockWindow peeking into that window would break.

Oh, another thing you might want to try is changing the AllocMem_ line in 
the LockWindow function to be
    lock.l=AllocMem_(SizeOf.Requester, #MEMF_PUBLIC|#MEMF_CLEAR)

Developer CD? in the NDK_3.5/Include/Include/intuition/intuition.h file.

Or try looking at either the NCS reference guide for the NWindows lib, or
even the PureBasic reference guide for the window library in that. IIRC,
both of those contain all the window flags, so I guess the IDCMP ones are
there somewhere too.

the

links to the next page(using clever bash scripts) and all. It was readable but
far from being a good formatted "ebook". I also doubt the legalitty and I
can`t find the archive on the internet again at the moment. I lost it afaik as
a hd crashed and in my efforts to grab a hd out of my pc and put it into my
Amiga I didn`t back up everything(well, what wasn`t valuable to me). If anyone
knows where it is or has this archive(amiga guru book in electronic format)
please send or tell me. Might be illegal, just don`t tell anyone ;-)

I`d buy the damn book any day if it was available, which it is NOT.

I have never seen a laced mpointer on AGA screens.
I think it is not possible because it is a hardware sprite,
and they are not laced.

> If i open an rtg screen, can i change the mousepointer

On an RTG screen the Mpointer is changed the same
way like on AGA screens. *Wpointer* should work fine.
The pointer will lace automatically under Cybergraphics
on laced screens, under Picasso 96 I don`t know.

Hope this helps,

There used to be a program years ago called "lacepointer" that would
display an interlaced pointer by alternating back and forth between two
pointer images...  it worked, but looked a little funny.  I suppose you
could do this :)

Ok, here's some info for you, a hires pointer is displayed in a 
1x1 aspect ratio instead of 2x1, so the pointer is actually twice
as WIDE not twice as high. So a hires pointer is 32x32 pixels instead
of 16x32...

Hope this helps.

Same on Picasso96 as CGX.

If you'd asked about a hires pointer last time I could have told you :)

This will only work for AGA I think, and only changes the horizontal
resolution of the pointer. As Thilo and Nick have already said, the
mousepointer in RTG is displayed in the size depending on the resolution
of the screen.

You need to use the VideoControl_ OS command. Something like this:

; Get pointer to currently used screen OS structure
*scr.Screen = Peek.l(Addr Screen(Used Screen))
Dim vtags.TagItem(2)
vtags(0)\ti_Tag = #VTAG_SPRITERESN_SET, #SPRITERESN_70NS
vtags(1)\ti_Tag = #TAG_DONE
VideoControl_ *scr\ViewPort\ColorMap, &vtags(0)

That should give you a hires pointer. Other values you can use are:

#SPRITERESN_ECS = 0
#SPRITERESN_140NS = 1 ; Lowres
#SPRITERESN_70NS = 2 ; Hires
#SPRITERESN_35NS = 3 ; Super hires
#SPRITERESN_DEFAULT = -1 ; default

Blitz might have some trouble with those constants because there is a
number in the middle, so you may need to use the value directly.

Hm I think so, but other AGA screenmodes with a more VGA like frequency can
show a proper hires pointer.

You can only change the horizontal resolution of sprites, i.e. lowres, 
hires and superhires. You cannot change the vertical display.

Instead of MUIAddTags #whatever,#MUIM_ShortHelp,"This is help text." use:

MUIAddTags #whatever,#MUIM_ShortHelp,Null("This is help text.")

That should work.

It would probably be better to assign the string to a variable and then 
pass the address of the string variable to the MUI command. I think the 
problem is that when you pass a string directly it is only put into the 
temporary string buffer (and overwritten later - which is why all the 
bubbles are empty).

Null(xxx) just allocates a new string in memory and returns a pointer to 
it. It won't be freed until the program exits. Plus you can't change the 
strings as easiyl without using a variable (*cough* localisation *cough*).

Hello all,

I'm converting a util I've written to MUI,and I'm having a little trouble with a
MUIList object.

I Initialise the list as follows:-

MUIListHook Off
MUIAddTags 20,#MUIA_Frame, #MUIV_Frame_InputList,#MUIA_List_SourceArray,mguidelist
MUINewObject 20,"List.mui",0
MUIListView 21,20

And I fill it with:-

MUIChangeList 20,mguidelist$(),#MUIV_List_Insert_Bottom

However, the list is filled with two lines of garbage and one "correct" line for
each entry. mguidelist() is created using a Dim List statement, and I've checked
the contents, which don't seem to be corrupt in anyway.

I get the same result creating my MUIList object with the standard MUIList
command.

Any ideas? 

All the best

Hi!

I recently updated my EFMUIlib v1.5 to v2 and discovered few problems...

Ok, take a look at this small example:

   End Select

This example worked fine with version v1.5 but crashes with v2!! A bug maybe?
I think it has something to do with those MUILabel's and MUIString's 'cos if I 
delete almost all of them and leave there just a few (1 or 2) like this:
--------------------
MUILabel 3,"Name",1        
  MUIString 4,name$,32
   
             MUIAddObjsHGroup 13,3,4
             MUIAddTags 13,#MUIA_Group_Columns,2
             MUIAddTags 13,#MUIA_Frame,9
             MUICreateHGroup 13
---------------------
...and then it works ok! Strange?
Is there a solution to this or do I just have to stick with the good old v1.5?

BTW! I was wondering that where I could get my hands on SuperTED v2.5? I have v2.24 but I haven't been able to
find the newer one...

The only thing I can see staring me in the face at the moment is that you`ve 
missed out the open and close stack macros..
Maybe thats why it worked when you cut down the example..cos it needed a 
smaller stack space.
There should be some commented examples in the EFMUI lib that mention this..

@NODE "mail_95" " MUICycle "
From: Richard Brooklyn <richbrooklyn@...>
Date: 07-19-01 10:03:36
Subject: @{b}MUICycle@{ub}

Hello again!

Right, a MUI question this time!

How can I make an array be the MUICycle gadgets input?

I have tried the following code, but the window does not open:
--
dim list cyclelist(3)
cyclelist(0)="one"
cyclelist(1)="Two"
cyclelist(2)="Three"
cyclelist(3)="Four"

muicycle #selector,cyclelist()
--

It always throws up the error "Not currently used list item" or something
along those lines. Using ResetList cyclist() does not help.

Where am I going wrong?

Thanks.

You are confusing lists with arrays. When you do "Dim List" you are 
creating a list structure, not an array. You therefore cannot access the 
items in the list using an index value (the number in the brackets).

You can only access the current item in a list (although there are 
obviously commands for moving between items in the list). You must also 
use AddItem to create items in your list.

Apart from that, you were trying to assign a string value to a word type 
list item (unless you done DEFTYPE.s at the top of your program, which 
probably isn't a good idea).

Oh, and are you sure that's how MUICycles work? I'm sure someone asked a 
similar question a few weeks ago, and you need to supply an array of 
string pointers terminated with a NULL pointer, i.e.:

Dim strings.s(10)
strings(0)="blah"
strings(1)="balaaah"
strings(2)="foo"
...
strings(10)="bar"

Dim strptr.l(11)  ; Notice -> 1 bigger than the string array
for i.w=0 to 10
    strptr(i)=&strings(i)
next
strptr(11)=0

MUICycle #selector,&strptr(0)

Just as a complete red herring, I always have DEFTYPE .s at the 
top of my programs.   Since most of my variables are numeric, it 
helps the compiler pick up my (numerous) spelling mistakes!

From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 07-28-01 07:36:57
Subject: @{b}MUIList prob (2)@{ub}

Hello again,

OK, after having sat up all night (again - I hate coding sometimes) I`ve come to
the conlusion that the MUIList command doesn't work with List Arrays.

So...I've recoded using a standard array. However, my MUIList will change on a
number of occasions during the course of the program. Setting up the list the
first time there's no problem. However, if the list shrinks, simply using a
MUIChangeList command leaves me with remnants from the old list, presumably
picked up from the array. If I go through clearing the array entries to "" then
I get blank entries in the list from the end of the new list to the original
size.

I have worked around this using MUI methods to delete surplus entries after the
list is recreated, but I'd like to know if there is any way to Null terminate my
array at any point I choose. (BTW, it's a string array).

When it is first initialised, the array must have termination in each cell,
otherwise it would overrun to it's max size each time. So how do I restore this
once a cell is no longer required.

All the best


Steve.

I had similar problems like that, it you`re hell bent on used lists ( I take 
it you really mean an array of strings? as in dim mymuilist$(30) )
then to remove an item from the list, you have two choices..
1. move all the strings down a slot
  eg ;##remove string 3
      for a=3 to numstrings
        mymuilist$(a)=mymuilist$(a+1)
      next

  This has tidies up the list, but you`ll be left with blank entries at the 
bottom ..since you`ve already predefined the number of entries. You could 
modify the above, by using 2 arrays and freeing and dimming them to the 
right size as required, then telling MUI to use the newer array.

2. The cleaner way is to use the insert and remove commands for 
Muilist/Muinlist.. it saves on having to define arrays and it tidies up 
after itself. Docs for doing this are in the EFMui docs.

OK, well as long as I know. I finally got it working at about 08:30 this
morning. I still use the array, but them use the MuiDoMethod to remove the
unwanted blank entries before redisplaying the list.

At least I haven't wasted my time then :o)

Hello David

Try *execute*_ "...",0,0.
It will execute any command including its arguments
like you would type this in a dos shell.

Say you want to start the tool "mytool" in "sys:tools" with
the arguments "abc" and "def".
Then try

*execute*_ "sys:tools/mytool abc def",0,0

Your GUI programm will be blocked until "mytool" has finished.
(e.g. you can set a busy-pointer, call the tool and then
set back to the normal pointer).

Or use

*execute*_ "run >NIL: sys:tools/mytool abc def",0,0

if you don`t want that your GUI programm is blocked.

Hope this helps,

Thilo

        OOh, this is a crucial point.  The program i am interfacing
[DNetC] takes weeks to return.  It runs in the background, saving its
progress just prior to shutting down the computer.  So ya, i'll have to
run it...

Look in the back of the Blitz manual, under Appendix2:Operating system 
calls. (1/2 mine has fallen out and got lost, so I cant be more specific)
Unfortunatly, this part of the manual just lists all functions from the main 
OS libraries, and doesnt specify the arguement types that the functions 
need.
Try getting hold of the Rom Kernal Reference Manual (aka RKRM`s or 
RKM`s)...a quick search on google often finds these..or buy the amiga 
developer CD2.1.
These go into a lot more detail about the workings of them, and they aren`t 
as scary or hard to use as they seem.

For teller.l=0 To soundsize

But I expected it to not work, which it doesn`t. I was thinking that upping
the offset by one is the same as going one byte up. And so peeking in it reads
one byte into the array. The error I get is data offset too large. 

I`m sure it`s easy, but what should I do to get it to work?

Try "for teller = 0 to soundsize-1" -- since you're starting at 0,
the last byte in the sample will be numbered one less than the actual
length of the file (hopefully :) )..

Also, you'd use 1/4 the amount of RAM if you dim soundarr.l as soundarr.b
since your sample is (I'm assuming) only 8 bit and not 32 bit.

Hope this helps!

Fair enough, but shouldn't it be:

soundarr.l(teller-1)=xbpeeksound(soundnr,teller-1)?

Unless that was just a typo...

Unless you try and play it like that, I can't see it being much of a
problem, I guess.

Not necessarily, because when you do "Dim soundarr.l(soundsize)" in 
Blitz, you are allowed to access items in the array between 0 and teller 
(inclusive).

C=Fair enough, but shouldn't it be:

Thgat wouldn`t matter much.
I`ve been trying with a smaller value into soundsize(more or less random try
outs), like soundzie/2(6 7 8) and soundsize-3000 etc. And it appeared dividng
by 2 got rid of the error, so did minus 3000, but NOT minus 10. I am kinda
lost as I don`t see a pattern here.

I tried to use the length stored in the sound structure this way:

*mysound.sound=Addr XBSound(soundnr)
Dim soundarr.w(*mysound\_length)
For teller.l=0 To *mysound\_length
  soundarr(teller)=XBPeekSound(soundnr,teller)
Next

Which did work and after trying a crude drawing of the array in a window it
seems to show the sample. I`d like to know if this is the right way then.

Well if would if the maximum of your array was teller-1, but it isn't :)

Can you send me your code?  I don't know why this wouldn't work and I
can't get my head around it just by looking at it...

Looks right.  Is there a pointerin the sound structure to the sound data?
If so you could just copymem_ instead of using a for loop to copy the
sample.

I could just use the original data for stuff like displaying, which doesn`t

Say I do this:

*mysound.sound=addr xbsound(soundnr)
*soundpointer.l=*mysound\_data 

How to access any byte of that data?

Wow, first time I've heard that! :)  That would have come in handy in that
past, many times.  I don't seem to have that file though.

Something like this:

soundbyte.b = peek.b(*soundpointer+offset)

would get you the byte at that offset (0 being the first one obviously)...

If you wanted a copy of your own to play with though you'd need to do
something like:

dim soundcopy.b(soundsize)
copymem_ addr xbsound(soundnr), &soundcopy(0), size

Or, you could allocmem instead, but the array of bytes should work just as
well.  

Hope this helps,

Dave (Newton??) sent a hack to be able to do this to the list ages ago, 
although it may not work on all versions of Blitz. When you run the 
program (exe is rc, source is rc.asc) it should give you a command not 
found error (thats what the return code of -1 does). Try compiling the 
source to see if it works with your compiler.

Oh, and there was some disclaimer about not his fault if your house burnt 
down :)

Greetings,

I'm trying to add a shadow to a window, I've been using the following routine
to draw it:

    *Windo.Window = Peek.l(Addr Window(WindoID.w))
    USEPATH *Windo

         WLeft - WLeftOff

       EndIf

       \RPort\AreaPtSz = 0                           ;Put it back to 0
    Statement Return
    BackFill:
    Dc.w %0101010101010101 ; first line...
    Dc.w %1010101010101010 ; next line...
    ;   ;%----------------   ...and repeats all down the window...
    ; These 0's and 1's control the pattern -

    ;          crash the machine!!!!!
    ;          Use the -'s as a guide :)
  End Statement

Is there anyway I can get it to draw just the '1's and not the '0's as
I want the background of the window to show through to give a proper shadow
effect.

The window background is a BltBitMapRastPort from the workbench screen.

What I would really like to do is a shadow similar to magicmenu's but I haven't
got a clue how to do that.

Either use a drawmode of 0 (#JAM1) which "jams" 1 colour into the 
rastport. Alternatively (and more effort) is to use the mask parameter of 
the BltPattern (just set it to the same as the backfill and use 2 for the 
byte count).

You could have just used "ILBMInfo f$ : picmode = ILBMViewMode" ;)

But that would probably give the same results as you are getting. I don't 
think it is the full screenmode of the picture (after all, people with 
P96 and CGFX won't have the same mode ID's for the same screenmodes) and 
those screenmodes would not have been thought of when ILBM was created. I 
think the only info it stores is hires, ham, laced and halfbright and 
things like that.

The bitmap you use has only 1 bitplane. If you
want to remap color 1 to - let`s say - color 5, you would need
at least 3 bitplanes (2^3 = 8 colors).
Try **

*Bitmap* 0,99,29,x 
...

instead where x is the number of desired bitplanes.

the program, that if I ran and quit the program 5 or 6 times in a row, it 
would just bomb out with a guru on the next start :(

  After a checking my code to make sure everything was open/closed or freed 
in the right order, I figured that the RIArexx stuff must still be buggy, so 
I changed it all back to the old Acid Arexx commands..and guess what, it 
doesnt bomb.
Only trouble is, I now can`t set anything in Rexx`s cliplist (apart from 
doing it the long way using execute_(rx "setclip(`myvar`,10)",0,0)!
Which takes a long time to set 15 variables..
  Anyone got any ideas? I noticed in the Arexx.bb file there is are 
constants that refers to adding/removing items in the clip list, but nothing 
on how to use it..:((

Subject: @{b}Screenmode Changing and Birdie@{ub}

Hi all,

In regards to my problem that I was having with changing screenmodes from WB
and getting a "Shut all windows, trying to change screenmode" requestor, I
found that Birdie was to blame so I have had to disable it for now. Does
anyone else use Birdie (2001 I think) with OS3.9 and Blitz without problems?
If anyone does use it without problems can you please tell me where abouts you
start it from your user-startup and with what command as it's one of my
favourite programs. (OK then, hacks)

Thanks,
Jason.

@NODE "mail_134" " Screwy Library "
From: David Lowe <doctorj@...>

Subject: @{b}Screwy Library@{ub}

Hello out there!

        I have been lurking this list for some time via the digests
that have been placed in AmiNet.  But i'm stumped, so that finally
prodded me to show myself.  I am a hobby programmer, though someday
i hope to go pro-am...

        Me: full-time husband/father/postal worker, part-time college
student.  I am experienced @ ANSI basic & ARexx, dabbled in AmOs
[don't use it any more, though it did cause the prettiest crashes],
Pascal, recently took a course that required VisualBasic [yech!].  I
have a fair understanding of structured programming, etc., but am
still learning graphics.

        My problem: i cannot get my gadgets on the screen.  Here are
the 1st few lines of source:

                ; from the book, pages 79 - 81

                WBStartup

                FindScreen 0

        When i try to compile this, it highlights the "findscreen"
line & gives me the following error: "Library not Found : $00FF."
What library is it i need?  I looked up the command description in
TFM, no mention of any library is given...

        I installed everything from the Ultimate Blitz CD, & a
smattering of things from AmiNet; mostly NewCommandSet & DefLibMan...
However, i find a lot of duplication amongst the various sub
directories in Blitz2:, which is not helped by the lack of version
strings!  Is it possible something is incorrectly
installed/configured?

                Advance Thanks,

Hi David

Sounds like your deflibs file is either missing or corrupt. The library 
in question is blitzlibs:amigalibs/intuition.library1 so make sure you 
have that and then remake your deflibs file. I think deflibman can do 
that, but if not, you should be able to download the command makedeflibs 
from the Blitz2000 site (http://www.blitz-2000.co.uk) and then run that 
from a CLI.

There shouldn't be that much duplication (in fact, there shouldn't be 
any). Generally speaking, your directory structure should look similar to 
this (these are only the main files and probably don't need to be 
duplicated):

Blitz2:
 |
 |- Main programs (Blitz2, Ted, Help, Help.dat, defaultdbug)
 |- dbug/
 |   |-REDDebugger
 |   '-structure.lookup
 |- acidlibs (all the Acid commands, Blitz v1.9+)
 |- deflibs (all 3rd party libraries compiled into 1 file from the files
 |           in the subdirectories of Blitzlibs:)
 |- userlibs/ (should normally be empty, used for testing libraries
 |             you are writing)
 '- Blitzlibs: (may or may not be under the Blitz2 directory)
     |- amigalibs.res (OS resident)
     |- bb2objtypes.res (Blitz object types)
     |- amigalibs/
     |   '- #?.library? (library files for OS)
     |- userlibs/
     |   '- #?.obj (3rd Party libraries)
     |- otherlibs/ (possible different name for the above directory)
     |- NLibs/
     |   '- #?.obj (NCS libraries, but can easily be put in userlibs)
     |- basic/ (Blitz basic keywords libraries, only for Blitz < v1.9)
     '- system/ (as above)

If you have installed the Blitz Support Suite, you'll have a few more 
directories in the Blitz2: directory, for that. Things like Startup, 
RedHelp, Plugins and SupportSuite.

??? None of the NLibs I have have numbers lower than 100. RIMiscLib has 
some fairly useful commands in it. dbaselib.obj was a library that came 
with BUM9 or 10 which was used in a guy's example database program. IIRC 
it was originally libnum #10. But I'd say your safe enough to delete it 
(or move it to somewhere outside blitzlibs: if you want to keep it, but 
don't want it in your deflibs).

Don't renumber dbase, either delete it or move it elsewhere (as above). 
You shouldn't need to renumber either of the NLibs or the RIMiscLib since 
their number do not clash (and I'm sure I have the latest versions). You 
could try downloading the NLibs again, as it sounds like somthing strange.

AFAIK (I've never checked) only the BSS debugger uses it. And probably 
only if you go to the menu item for Structures (or Newtypes or whatever 
it is).

OK O`wise ones, here`s something I`ve been pondering..

Considering Blitz can use the AmigaOS libraries, I was interested in the 
function that created a separate task from inside the running program (cant 
remember the function right now,it`s late and my brains fried..probably 
something obvious like CreateTask_ !).As usual, there`s a but....
But, how do I label part of my code(the bit I want as a task) so I can find 
it`s address and pass this location to the function?
Secondly,I read that normally a new task cannot read the global variables 
created by it`s parent,although compilers insert code when requested that 
takes care of this. Since Blitz isnt a C compiler, I take it that it wont do 
this, so does anyone know howto do it?

Either:

my_new_proc:
; Do stuff here
Return ; Ends new process

Then use ?my_new_proc as the label. Or you could do this:

my_new_proc:
Function.l somecrap{blah.w}
; blah!
Function Return rc
End Function

And then use ?my_new_proc+6 as the label. But you might also need to put 
RunErrsOff...RunErrsOn round the function, otherwise the debugger might 
have a heart attack (it does when you use this kind of method with hooks).

Well, for a start you'll want to create a new Process, not a Task. Tasks 
are not allowed to do any (disk?) IO, so they'd probably be pretty 
useless in Blitz (unless you know for sure you want to use a task).

Your main problem will be in the way Blitz programs work. All commands in 
Blitz (including the OS commands) expect to have had their libraries 
initialised on program startup. When you start a new process this 
initialisation does not take place, it just jumps straight to the code, 
so it will only work if the new code is using the memory locations for 
the main program startup. And because of this you cannot quit your main 
program until all your sub-tasks have exited, or they'll be accessing 
random gibberish in memory. This might work perfectly well, assuming all 
the commands use the original addresses.

To get access to the global variables, you'll need to restore a5 once you 
get into the new process. There should be a UserData field that you can 
use when you create your new process - make this point to an area of 
memory that you can share between the two processes, and then you can 
stick anything in the area and then retrieve it in your new task (i.e. 
the value from a5). Maybe need to use assembly until you get a5 restored. 
Oh, and a3 (being used as a temporary string storage) might completely 
screw your program if one process is using the buffer, you get a task 
switch and the other starts poking around in it. Could be problems there.

RWE developed a threadlib which might be useful here. However, AFAIK it 
only exists in source and I don't even know if it is complete.

Subject: @{b}Re: Spawning tasks@{ub}

Hello !

I have a solution which is quite a bit rough
but it works. I run my programm like normal
and then run a second with *execute_*.
As an CLI argument I give a pointer to my
variable base. Then I use signals to controll
my "Subtask" and tell it when to exit.
It is not very pretty I know, but you can use the debugger
on both tasks.

Restrictions:
- Don`t write strings within the subtask, read only 
- You have to put a forbid_ / permit_ pair around
the access of those variables, as I guess the
access of varaibles is not an atomic operation.

It looks like this:


____________________________ main:
*NewType* my_vars
x.l
y.l
blabla.l
*End* *NewType*

*Deftype*.my_vars my_varbase

*execute*_ "run subtask.exe"+*str*$(&my_varbase),0,0
...
my_varbase\blabla = 1234567
...
*END*

____________________________ subtask
*NewType* my_vars
x.l
y.l
blabla.l
*End* *NewType*

*my_varbase.my_vars = *val*(*par*$(1))
...
*my_varbase\blabla = *my_varbase\blabla +1
...
*END*


It works quite well if yu have not much variables to share,
only some pointers or a counter.

Ciao,

Hi all,

Just subscribed to this list after getting back into Blitz following an
absence from the Amiga of 4 and a half years!

My question is, is there any program or way of converting Blitz sprites
(made with the Shapesmaker tool) into shapes? I can't put the sprites on a
bitmap and save it out to re-cut them as shapes. ShapeZ from the Support
Suite refuses to load the sprites in. I am at a loss.

Why I need to do this is because I am updating a game I wrote all that time
ago, but only have the sprites as a sprites file - so I can't edit them. Any
help would be much appreciated!

Has anybody noticed this yet:

Sometimes if I invoke a function and I don`t

main:
dummy.l = my_fun*x*tion {x.l,y.l}
*END*

There is also a bug if you forget *Function* *Return*
the function is looped infinite times and never exits

Is this normal or mabye something wrong with my

Very strange - I would have thought you would get a "Procedure not found" 
error. That's what I get here.

That definately should not happen. If you leave out "Function Return" the 
function should return the value which is in d0 when it gets to the "End 
Function" line (I think I sometimes this feature with asm functions). Or 
maybe it returns 0 all the time (I just tried it).

There are hardly any examples in the thing - you are not missing 
anything. In fact, the examples which are there are only copies of the 
example code which was in the reference manual.

There is no standard requester for doing this. The only requester I have 
seen for this is by using reqtools.library and NeilsReqToolsLib (I think).

You are using *win\UserPort\mp_SigTask to get the task pointer? It should
be the same as getting your own task name after that (watch out for BPTRs

Well, here's what I've got at the moment:

Yeah, but do all the tasks have their names stored in that field? Have 
you tried this (will only work for things started from CLI - I can't 
remember how to get the task name for WB progs if it's not inthe 
task\ln_Name field):

      taskname.s = Peek$(*cli\cli_CommandName LSL 2 + 1)
    EndIf
  Else
    ; Program started from WB, not sure about task name
  EndIf
Else
  ; Not a process, so it must be a task. I guess just use your method?
  If *wintask\tc_Node\ln_Name
    taskname.s = Peek$(*wintask\tc_Node\ln_Name)

Is this after running any programs, or immediately after you boot? If it is 
immediately after you boot, then it could be some patch in your startup 
seuqence or a program in your WBStartup is locking the Workbench screen 
with intentions of opening a window on it, but not actually unlocking the 
screen when the window gets closed.

It could be a similar program if it occurs after running some programs.

And to bring it back on topic, I've seen a few Blitz programs which are 
badly behaved when it comes to public screens ;)

Hey all,

Just a few simple questions for ya:

What is an unsigned byte table? 
And how can I process them? 
Am I making any sense at all?

Thanks!

An array of unsigned bytes I guess. You do know how binary -> decmal 
conversion works? OK, in case you don't, in a byte each bit has a weight. 
As you look at the binary number written normally, the weightings (for an 
unsigned number) are this:

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

To convert from binary -> decimal, just add up all the weights where you 
have a 1 in your binary number, so 11001101 would be 128+64+8+4+1=205.

However, Blitz always uses signed numbers (stored in two's complement 
format). All this basically is that instead of the weight for the highest 
bit being 128, it is -128. Same rules apply for conversion, but now you 
can store numbers between -128 and +127 instead of 0 to 255.

> And how can I process them? 

It depends what you want to do with them. I used to have a nice trick 
with newtypes which let you access arrays as arrays via a pointer, but I 
recently found it doesn't work properly with bytes :(

You'll probably need to Peek the memory locations. For example, you will 
have the address of this table (say addr.l). To access a byte in the 
table, you simply add the number of the byte you want to access (starting 
from 0) multiplied by the size of each item in the table (in this case, 
each item is a byte, which obviously has a size of 1 byte, so you don't 
need to multiply here). After that, you need to convert it to the range 0 
to 255.

For example, if you wanted to read the 5th item from the table (starts 
from 0!) you could do something l;ike this:

; read byte from table
value.b = Peek.b(addr + 4)

; Store in word so we can access correct range
; We AND the value with $FF so that the value is not sign-extended to
; the size of a word, and gives us the value in the range 0 to 255.
realval.w = value & $FF

would BestModeIDA_ combined with screentags do this?

Yes, supposedly, although it sometimes doesn't actually return the best 
mode from a user point of view. It will give you a mode which matches your 
tags as best it can, but that might be an AGA screenmode while you really 
want it on your GFX card. Or at least that's what I've read posted about it 
here.

Dim tags.TagItem(however_many_tags_you_want)
tags(0)\ti_Tag = #TAG_VALUE, somevalue ; set tag and data
; the autodocs will tell you the available tags and what to
; pass as the data value
tags(last_tag)\ti_Tag = #TAG_DONE ; End of taglist

Can someone help with a silly problem.

The attached code works on a real A2000 with an 030, but fails on 
a PC under WinUAE.

I've attached 3 files, the code, the real output and the WinUAE 
output.   Note that the WinUAE output does odd things at the 1000 
and -1000 entries.

The code is supposed to convert a number of cents to a 
displayable dollars and cents string.

Thanks

I'm wondering if the problem might involve 16 bits vs 32 bits.

Possibly, although the 32 bit would be more accurate rather than 
less?

It might also be OS 3.5 (WinUAE) vs 3.1 (Real Amiga) libraries?

No, Blitz is Blitz on any Amiga (real or emulated). The code it produces 
is exactly the same on all systems. Remember that it was written for 
68000 only systems, so the processor doesn't affect anything - anything 
more advanced than the 68000 handles in hardware is done in software 
(i.e. 32 bit multiplication).

> It might also be OS 3.5 (WinUAE) vs 3.1 (Real Amiga) libraries?

Nope Blitz runs fine on OS3.5. And there is no difference between running 
OS3.5 on an Amiga or UAE.

I get the same output on my OS3.5 WinUAE as your real Amiga. Perhaps a 
broken Blitz installation? Some dodgy CLI? Are the programs /really/ the 
same on both your systems? Have you tried stepping through the code with 
the debugger and checking with that what the results would be?

Broken Blitz installation?  Possibly.  It's been yonks since I 
installed Blitz on the real machine.   All I did to reinstall under 
WinUAE was to copy my Blitz HDD backup and then frig any 
missing libraries.    If I go back to the original BSS floppies, do I 
need to do anything else?

Dodgy CLI?   Don't think so.

Programs the same?   Yep, definitely.   I created the test prog on 
the A2K, ran it, copied it to floppy and recompiled under WinUAE.   
Maybe the executable should be transferred as a test.

Stepping through with the debugger gives different results.   Good 
ones on the A2K and bad on the PC.

Another couple of oddities under WinUAE:   ToolsDaemon and 
NewDefTool don't want to work every time.    Sometimes TD just 
hangs the machine.   Wierd, back to the drawing board I guess.

Cheers

Hmm, normally works if you just copy the files, there shouldn't be anything 
magical that you need to do. If you got bak to the BSS floppies, remember 
to install Blitz too :)

Very strange. Have you tried to look at the results without the Format 
command (I know you need to use it, but just to check that Blitz on UAE is 
calculating ti correctly)? Oh, and do you use the JIT versions of WinAUE? 
Perhaps this is one of the situations where JIT causes bugs in teh Amiga 
programs.

Doesn;t ToolsDaemon need a patch to run under OS3.9? Also, there are some 
programs which just plain refuse to work under WinUAE for some weird 
reason, MultiCX being one (and typically, one that I use :/ ).

I always use Ustr$(thingy) in the debugger so I get real values.

Hmm..   I'm just trying to migrate the Motel Manager to WinUAE 
so I don't have to spend money on the Amiga any more.   Had a 
dealer sell me an 040 board which didn't work and he's refused to 
refund.   What with needing a new monitor and graphics board for 
thr miggy, WinUAE seemed the way to go.   I'll probably rewrite the 
code to avoid the Log10 command (make it more readable anyway).

OK, something very weird going on then.

OK, if you haven't heard of it, then that won't be causing the problems 
because you probably don't have that version of UAE :)
JIT stands for Just In Time, what it does is converts a whole chunk of 68k 
machine code into x86 machine code so the programs run natively on the 
processor instead of having to be emulated. It allows UAE to run faster 
than emulating every instruction individually.

Hmm, nasty. I know what you mean about switching to UAE, I would probably 
have done it full time if I had a lesser specced Amiga.

It must be something wrong with your Blitz installation, because the code 
worked fine for me on UAE. Perhaps the acidlibs file has become corrupted, 
or some other library is clashing with the one which Print or Format is in? 
What to do is copy the current Blitz setup somewhere else, reinstall Blitz 
(just Blitz for now) and try that small test program again.
